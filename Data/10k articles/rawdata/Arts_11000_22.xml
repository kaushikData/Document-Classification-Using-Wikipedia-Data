'''''Alma Mater''''' is a bronze sculpture of the goddess [[Athena]] by [[Daniel Chester French]] which is located on the steps leading to the [[Low Memorial Library]] on the [[Morningside Heights]] campus of [[Columbia University]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Using [[Audrey Munson]] as a model,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.llnyc.com/43144-meet-the-most-popular-model-in-new-york-youve-never-heard-of|title=Meet the most popular model in New York you've never heard of|date=2016-03-07|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://untappedcities.com/2016/04/15/audrey-munson-the-most-visible-new-york-woman-you-dont-know/|title=Untapped Cities|date=2016-04-15|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; French designed the statue in 1901 and installed it in September, 1903.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.cul.columbia.edu/outdoorsculpture/2014/07/15/unveiling-alma-mater/|title=Unveiling Alma Mater {{!}} Public Outdoor Sculpture at Columbia|website=blogs.cul.columbia.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was donated in memory of alumnus [[Robert Goelet]] of the Class of 1860 by his wife, Harriette W. Goelet.&lt;ref name=Richman&gt;Richman, Michael. ''Daniel Chester French: An American Sculptor'' (The Preservation Press, 1976, reprinted 1983), pp.&amp;nbsp;90–96: discussion of the commission, creation and installation of the sculpture.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alma Mater'' has become a symbol of the university.

An owl, a symbol of knowledge and learning,&lt;ref name=Richman /&gt; is hidden in the folds of ''Alma Mater'''s cloak near her left leg&lt;ref&gt;Durante, Dianne. ''Outdoor Monuments of Manhattan: A Historical Guide'' (New York University Press, 2007), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;  and college superstition has it that the first member of the incoming class to find the owl will become class [[valedictorian]]. The legend at another time was that any Columbia student who found the owl on his first try would marry a girl from [[Barnard College|Barnard]].

When the statue was originally installed it was gilded in gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/gutenberg.org/3/8/2/6/38267/38267-h/38267-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenburg ebook of International Congress of Arts and Science, 1906, Volume 1, edited by Howard J. Rogers.|last=|first=|date=|website=www.mirrorservice.org|publisher=|language=en|access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Over time, the original gilding wore off and the few remaining flakes were removed in 1950.&lt;ref name="20th"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.columbia.edu/locations"/cuarchives/resources/almaearly/alma20cent.html|title=Alma Mater: In the 20th Century|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1962, the University made the decision to have the gilding reapplied; however, the new gilding was removed after protests.&lt;ref name="aia"&gt;{{cite aia5}}, p. 497.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early morning hours of May 17, 1970, a bomb was planted on the statue. The resulting explosion caused significant damage to ''Alma Mater's'' throne.  The damage remained until 1978, when the statue was removed from Columbia.  The throne was recast and the sculpture was cleaned, refinished with a new patina, and returned to the Low steps.&lt;ref name="20th" /&gt;

'''Arcane Collective''' is a [[contemporary dance]] production company, producing and presenting work from a [[cooperative]] of international artists from different backgrounds. It was founded in 2011 by [[Morleigh Steinberg]], a dancer and [[choreographer]] and [[Oguri]], a dancer and choreographer from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/17/entertainment/la-et-cm-cold-dream-colour-review-20120516 | title=Review: Striking visuals lift 'Cold Dream Colour' at REDCAT | work=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=June 5, 2013 | last=Bleiberg | first=Laura | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their performance ''Cold Dream Colour'' was presented in 2012, as a homage to the important Irish artist [[Louis le Brocquy]], the performance being inspired by his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lhpublicity.ie/arts-culture/cold-dream-colour/ |title=Cold Dream Colour |work=Lindsey Holmes Publicity |accessdate=June 5, 2013 |year=2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235835/http://www.lhpublicity.ie/arts-culture/cold-dream-colour/ |archivedate=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morleigh explained "He so often pays homage to different painters, and I thought, for his birthday we could pay homage to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.u2.com/news/article/6337 | title=Cold Dream Colour, US Premiere | work=U2 | accessdate=7 June 2013 | year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The music was composed by [[Paul Chavez]] and performed by [[U2]]'s [[The Edge]] with choreography by Liz Roche&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/calendar-and-events/2013/05/12/arcane-collective-cold-dream-colour/1365 |title=Arcane Collective: Cold Dream Colour |first= |last= |work=guggenheim.org |year=2013 |accessdate=June 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510044312/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/calendar-and-events/2013/05/12/arcane-collective-cold-dream-colour/1365 |archivedate=May 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinberg, the artistic director of the piece staged a solo dance as well as a duet with her sister Roxanne, wife of Oguri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hotpress.com/politics/frontlines/7258734.html? |title=For A Dancer |first=Adrienne |last=Murphy |work=hotpress.com |year=2013 |accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Excerpts from ''Cold Dream Colour'' were performed at the [[Solomon R.

Early '''architectural photographers''' include [[Roger Fenton]], [[Francis Frith]] (Middle East and Britain), [[Samuel Bourne]] (India) and [[Albert Levy (photographer)|Albert Levy]] (United States and Europe). They paved the way for the modern speciality of [[architectural photography]]. Later architectural photography had practitioners such as [[Ezra Stoller]] and [[Julius Shulman]]. Stoller worked mainly on the east coast of America, having graduated with a degree in architecture in the 1930s. Shulman, who was based on the West Coast, became an architectural photographer after some images that he had taken of one of [[Richard Neutra]]'s houses in California made their way onto the architect's desk.

'''Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art''' (1969-1985) was a [[magazine]] published by the [[conceptual art]]ists of [[Art &amp; Language]]. Involving more than 20 artists, in the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], and covering almost 20 years production, it is one of the most extensive artworks of conceptual art, and is regarded as an important influence on both conceptual art and [[contemporary art]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't understand quite a good deal of what is said by Art-Language, but I admire the investigatory energies, the tireless spade-work (not calling one one), the full commitment to the reestablishment of a valid language by which to discuss art and the occasional humour in their writings. The chaos in their reasons fascinates me, but it is also irritating to be unequipped to evaluate their work. - ''Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object'', [[Lucy R. Lippard]], 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?redir_esc=y&amp;hl=fr&amp;id=t2nwiTwd6fwC&amp;q=Art-Language#v=snippet&amp;q=Art-Language&amp;f=false ''Six Years: The Dematerialisation of the Art Object'' - Lucy R. Lippard, New York Praeger, 1973, p151]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==
{{Main article|Art &amp; Language}}
The name Art &amp; Language is derived form the journal Art-Language that was published by Art &amp; Language Press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/culture/stories/2003/04/art-and-language.shtml ''Paying Hommage to Art &amp; Language revolutionaries'', BBC, 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nts.live/artists/65770-art-language NTS Live, Art &amp; Language]&lt;/ref&gt; Art &amp; Language Press had been created in 1968 to give a publication arm to the ongoing conversation between the four founders of Art &amp; Language (Michael Baldwin, Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Harold Hurrell), and also between Art &amp; Language and other artists in America or other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt8489r9cw/entire_text/ Art &amp; Language New York Archives, The Getty Museum, Los Angeles]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/11494/1/ETD_Template_Robert__Bailey.pdf ''Art &amp; Language'', Robert Bailey, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Strong connections have been made over time between the British artists of Art &amp; Language and American artists, in 1966, Michael Baldwin who has just been rewarded a Prize from the ''Northern Young Contemporaries'', spent the money on a trip to New York, to meet and discuss with [[Donald Judd]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], and [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]]. In November 1967, thanks to [[Robert Smithson]], ''arts magazine'', a New York-based magazine, published for the first time a text-work of Art &amp; Language (before the foundation of the group) titled ''Remarks on Air-Conditioning, an Extravaganza of Blandness'' written by Michael Baldwin. It is interesting to note Michael Baldwin is presented as an English writer and an artist concerned with the non-exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;''Remarks on Air-Conditioning An Extravaganza of Blandness'', Michael Baldwin, arts magazine, November 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=P1gqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT153&amp;lpg=PT153&amp;dq=Art-Language+journal+of+conceptual+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ATzAqpYGKQ&amp;sig=iUEjz5feOk8mlWwmeC3Fsl5hgyI&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjChMDNjZrdAhWMCsAKHajNB6w4PBDoATACegQIBxAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Art-Language%20journal%20of%20conceptual%20art&amp;f=false ''Art &amp; Language International'', Robert Bailey, 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, ''Art Press'',  was produced in New York by Ian Burn and Mel Ramsden. In it they published their own text-works as well as items by [[Adrian Piper]], [[Sol LeWitt]] and [[Stephen Kaltenbach]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leftmatrix.com/july69lewitt.html ''July 1969'' - Ian Burn, Mel Ramsden, Art Press, The Society for Theoretical Art and Analyses, New York, July 1969]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Art-Language===
Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art was published by [[Art &amp; Language|Art &amp; Language Press]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibliothequekandinsky.centrepompidou.fr/clientBookline/service/reference.asp?INSTANCE=INCIPIO&amp;OUTPUT=PORTAL&amp;DOCID=0468760&amp;DOCBASE=CGPP ''Art-Language'', Centre Pompidou.]&lt;/ref&gt; it is regarded as an important influence on both conceptual art and contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flashartonline.com/article/art-language/ ''Art &amp; Language The Unfinished Legacy'', Fernando Frances, Flash Art, February 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.artspace.com/magazine/art_101/art_market/6-most-important-artist-run-magazines-53346 6 most important artist run magazines, Maya Harakawa, December 2015, artspace.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arthist.net/archive/16167  Looking at Art_Language]&lt;/ref&gt; Art &amp; Language Press was founded at the same time as an art practice under the name Art &amp; Language in 1968 by four artists, Michael Baldwin, Terry Atkinson, Harold Hurrell, and David Bainbridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicagoartmagazine.com/2010/02/art-language-comes-to-rhona-hoffman-gallery/ Art &amp; Language comes to Rhona Hoffman]&lt;/ref&gt; They were also the editors of the first volume published in May 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[https://edcat.net/item/art-language-vol-1-no-1-may-1969/  Art-Language Vol.1 Nr.1]&lt;/ref&gt;
Terry Atkinson spent the summer of 1969 with Joseph Kosuth in New York, and in August of that year, Joseph Kosuth became the American editor of Art-Language.&lt;ref&gt;''Status and priority'' - Michael Baldwin, Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Harold Hurrell, Studio International 179, January 1970&lt;/ref&gt; From the second volume, the journal was edited both in the [[United Kingdom]] and in the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/509748?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|title= Reflections on conceptual art Voices Off, Critical Inquiry]&lt;/ref&gt; Essays by members of Art &amp; Language appeared regularly in Studio International, and in February 1970, the general editor and art critic [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]] published an article titled ''Notes Towards Art Work'', arguing that ″The only alternative to criticism is art″.&lt;ref&gt;''Notes Towards Art Work'' - Charles Harrison, Studio International 180, February 1970&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, having resigned from Studio International, he became the general editor of Art-Language. In 1971, Terry Atkinson had also met Ian Burn and Mel Ramsden in New York in 1969 and, having published a number of text-works as the ''Society for Theoretical Art and Analyses'', they joined with Art-Language that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leftmatrix.com/artlanguage.html ''Art &amp; Language'', leftmatrix.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''We are cell arent we?: Art &amp; Language and the Documenta Index - William Wood, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, October 1992&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time in Coventry, David Rushton, Philip Pilkington and Graham Howard, three ''Art Theory'' students of Baldwin, Bainbridge and Atkinson began to work under the name of Art &amp; Language. In that year ''Coventry College of Art'' was transformed into the ''Faculty of Art and Design'', part of ''Lanchester Polytechnic''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/gallery/coventry-university-celebrates-175th-birthday-14690150 ''Coventry University celebrates 175th Birthday'', Laura Hartley, Coventry telegraph, May 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; The new dean of the faculty, saw it as his task to bring an end to the ''Art-Theory'' course.&lt;blockquote&gt;In the summer of 1971, the Art-Theory course was dismantled by arbitrary exercise of power and Baldwin and Bainbridge dismissed along with some other members of the part-time staff. Atkinson remained. His presence enabled ther authorities in charge to claim some credibility for the ruins ... Art &amp; Language found itself in exile from any official academic or educational context … Art &amp; Language work in all its forms was addressed first and foremost to ‘art’ as discourse, rather than to the enlargement of the extensive category of art objects - &lt;ref&gt;''A Provisional History of Art &amp; Language'', Charles Harrison and Fred Orton, Editions E. Fabre, Paris 1982, pp. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Michael Baldwin and Terry Atkinson wrote an extensive 25 pages critical essay on Art education in an article titled ''Art Teaching'' and published it in Art-Language Volume 1 Number 4. In 1973, Atkinson eventually resigned.&lt;blockquote&gt;In virtue of this prototype of present art-school sensibility, William Morris and his followers have helped spawn the resolute craftsmanship bias in British art education in the earlier part of the century. Of course this is not to say that Morris' influence stopped at Lowestoft and the Wash; the Bauhaus founders had a good look at Morris -and there may yet be a case for looking at the Bauhaus as the definitive example in showing how ″fine art″ and ″design″ do diverge.&lt;ref&gt;''Art Teaching'', Terry Atkinson and Michael Baldwin, Art-Language Volume 1 Number 4, November 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  While, in 1972, the activity of Art &amp; Language was exclusively textual and its identity somehow confounded with Art-Language, the production of the ''Index 01'', for the [[Documenta 5]], under the name of ''The Art &amp; Language Institute'' marked a shift.&lt;ref&gt;''We are cell aren't we?: Art &amp; Language and the Documenta Index - William Wood, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, October 1992&lt;/ref&gt; From Art-Language Volume 2 Number 3, the journal became anonymous and the authorship of the texts weren't given anymore to individuals. The journal continued to be published until 1985, and the implications of the indexes of 1972-3 persisted in bearing in various ways – and to a greater and lesser extent upon its content.
A new series appeared in 1994, continuing for 3 issues until 1999. Apart from Baldwin, Ramsden and Harrison, into whose hands the work of Art &amp; Language had been taken by 1976, its contributors included Philip Pilkington and Paul Wood.
&lt;ref&gt;''Further Essays on Art &amp; Language'', Charles Harrison , The MIT Press, Cambridge Massachusetts, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editors===
The first number was edited by Art &amp; Language, Joseph Kosuth became the American editor from August 1969 until 1972, and Art &amp; Language remained the English editors. In 1971, Charles Harrison became the general editor of Art-Language, and he remained so until the last volume.

===Distributors===      
* United Kingdom: Art &amp; Language, [[Lisson Gallery]], Robert Self Publications, Arts Bibliographic.
* United States of America: Joseph Kosuth, Ian Burn, Mel Ramsden, [[Kathryn Bigelow]], [[Printed Matter, Inc.]].

==Complete list and contributors==
The authors of the articles are named in the first 7 issues of the journal, and from 1974, all texts are collectively attributed to Art &amp; Language. But, since during the internal problems that the group encountered between 1975 and 1976, the name Art &amp; Language remained in the hands of Michael Baldwin, Mel Ramsden and Charles Harrison, it is logical to give them the authorship of the texts from Volume 3 Number 4.

==Critical review==
*Daniel Buren: &lt;blockquote&gt;To lend support to their pseudo-cultural references and to their bluffing games, with a complacent display of questionable scholarship, certain artists attempt to explain what conceptual art would be, could be  or should be -thus making a conceptual work. There is no lack of vulgarity in pretense. In place of unpretentious inquiry we are subjected to a hodgepodge of explanations and justifications which serve as obfuscation in the attempt to convince us of the existence of thought. For these, conceptual art has become ''verbiage art''. They are no longer living in the twentieth century but wish to revive the eighteenth.&lt;ref&gt;''Art Conceptuel Formes Conceptuelles'' - Christian Schlatter, Galerie 1900-2000, Paris, 1990, p410-433&lt;/ref&gt;

* Jeff Wall: &lt;blockquote&gt;By putting forward its forgotten card-files and print-outs (its caskets of information) conceptualism recapitulates a kind of Mallarméan aesthetic: social subjects are presented as enigmatic hieroglyphs and given the authority of the crypt. The identification of bureaucracy, publicity and academicism with cryptic utterances expresses an awareness of the participation of universities and bureaucracies in a corporate death-machine, an awareness which of course animated the student movement. - Jeff Wall, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;''A Draft for Dan Graham's Kammerspiel'', Jeff Wall, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Lucy Lippard: &lt;blockquote&gt;I don't understand quite a good deal of what is said by Art-Language, but I admire the investigatory energies, the tireless spade-work (not calling one one), the full commitment to the reestablishment of a valid language by which to discuss art and the occasional humour in their writings. The chaos in their reasons fascinates me, but it is also irritating to be unequipped to evaluate their work. I don't know how it is or if it is evaluated by adepts in philosophy as philosophy, but I find it infuriating to have to take them on faith. - ''Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object'', [[Lucy R. Lippard]], 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?redir_esc=y&amp;hl=fr&amp;id=t2nwiTwd6fwC&amp;q=Art-Language#v=snippet&amp;q=Art-Language&amp;f=false ''Six Years: The Dematerialisation of the Art Object'' - Lucy R.

[[Image:Andrea Mantegna 054.jpg|thumb|right|The "Court Scene".]]

The '''Camera degli Sposi''' ("bridal chamber"), sometimes known as the '''Camera picta''' ("painted chamber"), is a room [[fresco]]ed with [[illusionistic painting]]s by [[Andrea Mantegna]] in the [[Ducal Palace, Mantua]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="radke"&gt;{{cite book|first=John T.|last=Paoletti|author2=Gary M. Radke|title=Art, Power, and Patronage in Renaissance Italy|location=[[Upper Saddle River]]|publisher=[[Pearson PLC|Pearson]]/[[Prentice Hall]] |year=2005|pages=356–359}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;{{cite book|first= Laurie |last=Schneider Adams|title=Italian Renaissance Art|location=[[Boulder]]|publisher=[[Westview Press]]|year=2001|pages=262–267}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was painted between 1465 and 1474 and commissioned by [[Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua|Ludovico III Gonzaga]], and is notable for the use of ''[[trompe l'oeil]]'' details and its ''[[di sotto in sù]]'' ceiling.
[[Image:Andrea Mantegna 080.jpg|thumb|left|The "Meeting Scene".]]

The chronological sequence of the paintings has been recently discovered: the painter started from the vault by dry painting in the background small bits particularly those of the oculus and the wreath surrounding it. Then he moved on to the ‘Court scene’ where he used a mysterious oily tempera dry laid out on the surface. The east and south walls followed, with the traditional fresco technique representing heavy curtains. Finally the ‘Meeting scene’ on the west wall was painted, always ‘a fresco’ but in very small bits which confirms an almost ten-year period of work on that part of the chamber.&lt;ref name="guidemantova"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://guideturistichemantova.it/English/?p=34 |title=Mantua Tourist Guide, The Bridal Chamber |accessdate=4 April 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The walls==
The "Court Scene" on the north wall shows Ludovico Gonzaga, dressed informally, with his wife [[Barbara of Brandenburg, Marquise of Mantua|Barbara of Brandenburg]]. They are seated with their relatives, while a group of [[courtier]]s fill the rest of the wall. The figures are interacting in an illusionistically expanded space.

On the west wall is the "Meeting scene". This fresco shows Ludovico in official robes in an ideal meeting with his son, Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga, the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] and [[Christian I of Denmark]].

The commission is far from being explained by scholars. The traditional interpretation sees the frescos as linked to the election as Cardinal of Ludovico's son Francesco Gonzaga, which took place on January 1, 1462: the Court scene should then represent the Marquis receiving the news, and the Meeting Scene should see father and son reunited in the happy event.&lt;ref name="guidemantova"/&gt;

The mature and strongly-built figure of Francesco though, doesn’t seem to match with his age in 1461, which was only 17 (an early portrait held today in Naples confirms this). For this reason, these frescos could refer to a later visit of Cardinal Francesco to Mantua, perhaps on August 1472 when he was given the title of St. Andrew.&lt;ref name="guidemantova"/&gt;

==The ceiling==
Mantegna's playful ceiling presents an [[oculus]] that illusionistically opens into a blue sky, with foreshortened [[putti]] playfully frolicking around a balustrade. This was one of the earliest [[di sotto in sù]] ceiling paintings.

'''Cerebral achromatopsia''' is a type of color-blindness caused by damage to the [[cerebral cortex]] of the brain, rather than abnormalities in the cells of the eye's [[retina]]. It is often confused with congenital [[achromatopsia]]&lt;ref name=Fulton&gt;Briefing from 2008 Achromatopsia Conference by James Fulton&lt;/ref&gt; but underlying physiological deficits of the disorders are completely distinct. A similar, but distinct, deficit called '''color agnosia''' exists in which a person has intact color perception (as measured by a matching task) but has deficits in color recognition, such as knowing which color they are looking at.

==Signs and symptoms==

Patients with cerebral achromatopsia deny having any experience of color when asked and fail standard clinical assessments like the [[Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test|Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test]] (a test of color ordering with no naming requirements). Patients may often [[Anosognosia|not notice their loss of color vision]] and merely describe the world they see as being "drab". Most describe seeing the world in "shades of gray".&lt;ref name=Jaeger/&gt; This observation notes a key difference between cerebral and congenital achromatopsia, as those born with achromatopsia have never had an experience of color or gray.

==Pathophysiology==

Cerebral achromatopsia differs from other forms of color blindness in subtle but important ways. It is a consequence of cortical damage that arises through [[ischemia]] or [[infarction]] of a specific area in the ventral occipitotemporal cortex of humans.&lt;ref  name=Jaeger&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jaeger W, Krastel H, Braun S |title=[Cerebral achromatopsia (symptoms, course, differential diagnosis and strategy of the study). I] |language=German |journal=Klin Monbl Augenheilkd |volume=193 |issue=6 |pages=627–34 |date=December 1988 |pmid=3265459 |doi=10.1055/s-2008-1050309 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This damage is almost always the result of injury or illness.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt;

===Classification===
A 2005 study examined 92 case studies since 1970 in which cerebral lesions affected color vision.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt; The severity and size of the visual field affected in cerebral achromatopsiacs vary from patient to patient.

====Bilateral and hemifield====

The majority of cases in the 2005 study were the result of bilateral lesions in the ventral occipital cortex.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt; It is unknown whether this was the result of bilateral lesions being more likely to produce color-loss symptoms, or if it was a sampling effect of patients with more severe brain trauma more often being admitted for treatment. In many of the cases examined, patients reported only partial loss of color vision. The locations of color vision loss can be restricted to one hemisphere or one quarter of the visual field. The term "hemiachromatopsia" has been used to denote patients who experience loss of color in only one hemisphere of the visual field. However, as applied to achromatopia resulting from brain trauma, the term is incomplete in characterizing the often-complex nature of the vision loss.

====Transient====

In still rarer cases, temporary ischemia of the associated ventral occipital cortex can result in transient achromatopsia. The condition has thus far been characterized only in stroke patients and provides further support for a color processing area.

In one case, a 78-year-old stroke victim had lost the ability to identify color, but was unaware of his deficit until doctors performed color discretion tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=von Arx SW, Müri RM, Heinemann D, Hess CW, Nyffeler T |title=Anosognosia for cerebral achromatopsia--a longitudinal case study |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=970–7 |date=March 2010 |pmid=19944708 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.11.018 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even when presented with this information, the patient believed he had retained his ability to perceive color even though the world around him appeared grey. He attributed this achromatism to "poor lighting" and it took several weeks for the patient to fully appreciate the extent of his disability. In addition, the characteristic comorbidity of prosopagnosia was present. After two months and frequent sessions with doctors, tests indicated his color had fully returned. The ischemia caused by lesions on the posterior cerebral arteries had subsided and follow up MRI scans indicated that blood flow had once again returned to the VOC.

===Co-occurrence with other deficits===
The most common disorder seen alongside cerebral achromatopsia is [[prosopagnosia]], the inability to recognize or recall faces. In some studies, the comorbidity is seen as high as 72%.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt; This significance has not been overlooked and is a subject of ongoing research. See {{section link||Difference from congenital achromatopsia}} below.

Cerebral achromatopsiacs often have poor spatial acuity.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==

The most common tests perform to diagnose cerebral achromatopsia are the [[Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test]], the [[Ishihara plate]] test, and the color-naming test.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt; Testing and diagnosis for cerebral achromatopsia is often incomplete and misdiagnosed in doctor’s offices.&lt;ref name=Fulton/&gt;

Remarkably, almost 50% of tested patients diagnosed with cerebral achromatopsia are able to perform normally on the color-naming test. However, these results are somewhat in question because of the sources from which many of these reports come.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt; Only 29% of cerebral achromatopsia patients successfully pass the Ishihara plate test, which is a more accepted and more standardized test for color blindness.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt;

===Difference from congenital achromatopsia===
The most apparent distinguishing characteristic between congenital achromatopsia and cerebral achromatopsia is the sudden onset of color vision loss following a severe head injury or damage to the occipital lobe following a stroke or similar ischemic event.&lt;ref name=Jaeger/&gt;  Non-invasive imaging techniques can be the most helpful in determining whether the area of damage following a traumatic event is an correlated with color-vision processing. Simple diagnostic tools can also be used to determine whether a patient is a likely candidate for further testing, as advancing imaging procedures can often prove expensive and unnecessary.

Co-morbid factors can be valuable indicators of the likelihood of cerebral achromatoptsia. One disorder often seen alongside cerebral achromatopsia is prosopagnosia, the inability to recall or recognize faces. The correlation is still the subject of ongoing research, but the most telltale clue in this association is the close proximity of brain lesions seen in prosopagnosics and cerebral achromatopsiacs without prosopagnosia.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt; Figure 1 illustrates overlap of brain lesions compiled from numerous case reports of both disorders. A common area of damage associated with both disorders can be seen in the right occipital lobe.

==Treatment==

No current treatment is known for the disorder.
==History==

The number of reported cases of cerebral achromatopsia are relatively few compared with other forms of color-vision loss. In addition, the severity of the color perception deficits along with other psychological effects vary between patients.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bouvier SE, Engel SA |title=Behavioral deficits and cortical damage loci in cerebral achromatopsia |journal=Cereb. Cortex |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=183–91 |date=February 2006 |pmid=15858161 |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhi096 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==

Based on the knowledge gained from cerebral achromatopsia case studies, current research is focusing on learning more about the cortical area involved in color processing.

A recent study provided some of the first direct evidence of color-specific processing in the ventral occipital cortex. A subject with a history of seizure activity was examined using fMRI and electrode implantation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murphey DK, Yoshor D, Beauchamp MS |title=Perception matches selectivity in the human anterior color center |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=216–20 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18258428 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.01.013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the fMRI, researchers examined the areas of blood oxygenation in the occipital lobe as the subject viewed various color-specific stimuli. The result of the experiment was the identification of an area in the subject, slightly anterior to the lesioned area in cerebral achromatic patients, that responded to variance in color stimulation. The resolution of the MRI was a limiting factor in identifying areas corresponding to specific colors. The next portion of the study used an electrode implanted in the right hemisphere in the location identified by the fMRI scan as pertaining to color processing. It was found the electrical activity of the area increased when the subject was presented with blue stimuli. The next, and most significant finding of the study, was that when the electrode was used to present an electrical stimulus in the subject’s brain, the subject reported the perception of the color blue. Such a result is consistent with other reports of electrical stimulation in visual field maps eliciting perception of phosphines in subjects’ visual field.

The color stimulus presented is not the only factor in determining the involvement of the VOC in color processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beauchamp MS, Haxby JV, Jennings JE, DeYoe EA |title=An fMRI version of the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue test reveals multiple color-selective areas in human ventral occipitotemporal cortex |journal=Cereb. Cortex |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=257–63 |year=1999 |pmid=10355906 |doi=10.1093/cercor/9.3.257 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of attention and the type of object also affect the activiation of the VOC. It has been noted that this area of the occipital lobe may not be a processing center but rather a pathway that is a critical intersection of several cortical areas involved in color perception.

==Society and culture==

The disorder is often presented as evidence of our incomplete knowledge of color processing. Color vision research is a well-studied field of modern neuroscience and the underlying anatomical processing in the retina have been well categorized. The presence of another factor in the perception of color by humans illustrates the need for more research.

===The case of the colorblind painter===

The most famous instance of cerebral achromatopsia is that of "Jonathan I." immortalized in a case study by [[Oliver Sacks]] and Robert Wasserman, and published as "The Case of the Colorblind Painter".&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, Oliver. "The Case of the Colorblind Painter". ''An Anthropologist on Mars''. New York: Random House, 1995. 3-41.&lt;/ref&gt; The essay tracks Johnathan I.'s experience with cerebral achromatopsia from the point where an injury to his occipital lobe leaves him without the ability to perceive color, through his subsequent struggles to adapt to a black, white and gray world, and finally to his acceptance and even gratitude for his condition. Especially pertinent is the analysis of how cerebral achromatopsia affects his practice as a painter and artist. Descriptions of cerebral achromatopsia's effects on his psychological health and visual perception are especially striking. For instance, in recounting Mr. I.'s descriptions of flesh and foods, the authors write:

{{quote|Mr. I. could hardly bear the changed appearances of people ("like animated gray statues") any more than he could bear his own changed appearance in the mirror: he shunned social intercourse and found sexual intercourse impossible. He saw people's flesh, his wife's flesh, his own flesh, as an abhorrent gray; "flesh-colored" now appeared "rat-colored" to him. This was so even when he closed his eyes, for his preternaturally vivid ("eidetic") visual imagery was preserved but now without color, and forced on him images, forced him to "see" but see internally with the wrongness of his achromatopsia. He found foods disgusting in their grayish, dead appearance and had to close his eyes to eat. But this did not help very much, for the mental image of a tomato was as black as its appearance.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5720">'''Cherie Bennett''' (born 1960 in [[Buffalo, New York]]) is an American novelist, actress, director, playwright, newspaper columnist, singer, and television writer on the [[CBS Daytime]] [[soap opera]] ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''.

==Biography==
Writing was not Bennett's early focus. Sometimes known as the "Big and Tall Barbie Doll", she attended [[Wayne State University]], and then the [[University of Michigan]] in the early 1980s, as a musical theater major. She worked frequently as an actress, doing national musical tours, regional theater productions including [[Mark Medoff|Mark Medoff's]] ''When You Comin' Back, Red Ryder?'' and a well-reviewed turn in the [[off-Broadway]] revival of [[Tennessee Williams|Tennessee Williams']] ''Twenty-Seven Wagons Full of Cotton''. She headed her own [[Improvisational theatre|improv]] comedy trio, Zaniac, and performed as a vocalist, singing backup for [[John Mellencamp]] and in her play, ''Honk Tonk Angels''.

Bennett's favorite non-writing activities are reading ([[memoir]]s, medical mysteries, and show-biz stories), film, theater, cooking, politics, and [[Internet]] shopping. She lives in [[Los Angeles]] with her son.

Her pseudonyms are C.J. Anders, and [[Carrie Austen]]. For many years, she wrote frequently with [[Jeff Gottesfeld]], with whom she shared the [[Zoey Dean]] pseudonym.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/contributor/zoey-dean Biography: Zoey Dean]. [[Scholastic Corporation]] (accessed September 20, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Her father was a writer for such shows as ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'', and [[Sid Caesar|Sid Caesar's]] ''Your Show of Shows''.

Since June 2011, she's been the [[Creative Director|Artistic Director]] at Amusings Productions in [[Sherman Oaks]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10582">The '''classical unities''', '''Aristotelian unities''', or '''three unities''' are rules for [[drama]] derived from a passage in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. In their [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] form they are as follows:

#''unity of action'': a play should have one action that it follows, with minimal subplots.
#''unity of time'': the action in a play should occur over a period of no more than 24 hours.
#''unity of place'': a play should exist in a single physical space and should not attempt to compress geography, nor should the stage represent more than one place.

==Aristotle's unities==
Aristotle dealt with the unity of action in some detail, under the general subject of "definition of tragedy", where he wrote: "serious, complete in itself and of a certain magnitude". 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, according to our definition, Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is complete, and whole, and of a certain magnitude&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/ari/poe/poe08.htm Aristotle's ''Poetics'', VII].&lt;/ref&gt; … As therefore, in the other imitative arts, the imitation is one when the object imitated is one, so the plot, being an imitation of an action, must imitate one action and that a whole, the structural union of the parts being such that, if any one of them is displaced or removed, the whole will be disjointed and disturbed. For a thing whose presence or absence makes no visible difference, is not an organic part of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/ari/poe/poe09.htm Aristotle's ''Poetics'', VIII].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His only reference to the time in the fictive world is in a distinction between the [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[tragedy|tragic]] forms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Epic poetry agrees with Tragedy in so far as it is an imitation in [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] of characters of a higher type. They differ, in that Epic poetry admits but one kind of metre, and is narrative in form. They differ, again, in their length: for Tragedy endeavours, as far as possible, to confine itself to a single revolution of the sun, or but slightly to exceed this limit; whereas the Epic action has no limits of time.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle's ''Poetics'', V.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike his prescriptive attitude regarding the plot (unity of action), Aristotle here merely remarks on the typical duration of a tragedy's action, and does not suggest any kind of imperative that it always ought to be so. He was writing after the golden age of [[Greek drama]], and many [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] playwrights wrote plays that do not fit within these conventions.

Aristotle does not actually mention the neoclassical unity of place at all. However, the prevalent interpretation of his ''Poetics'' during the Middle Ages inclined toward interpreting his comment on time as another "unity".

==European literature==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
[[Italy|Italian]] critics of the 16th century, from [[Lodovico Castelvetro]] onwards, and then [[French literature of the 17th century|17th-century French]] critics, proponents of the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] movement, both expanded Aristotle's descriptions. The result was to make them into prescriptions for structuring plays.  French drama of the 17th century, particularly that of [[Molière]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]], was highly regular, and [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]] incurred harsh criticism for departing from the unities in ''[[Le Cid]]''. The [[England|English]] dramatists writing for the [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan and Jacobean stage]] were largely unaware of these structures.

By the later 17th century, however, English dramatists (under the influence of French criticism picked up by those in exile during the [[English Interregnum]]) did begin to assess their own plays according to these rules. Thus, [[John Dryden]], among many others, compares the "irregular" [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] (only two of Shakespeare's plays conform to the unities – ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'' and ''[[The Tempest]]'') with the "regular" [[Dryden]] in his ''[[Essay of Dramatick Poesie]]'' (1668), and makes use of the unity of time in this passage criticizing [[Shakespearean histories|Shakespeare's history plays]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;... if you consider the Historical Playes of Shakespeare, they are rather so many Chronicles of Kings, or the business many times of thirty or forty years, crampt into a representation of two hours and a half, which is not to imitate or paint Nature, but rather to draw her in miniature, to take her in little; to look upon her through the wrong end of a Perspective, and receive her Images not onely much less, but infinitely more imperfect then the life: this instead of making a Play delightful, renders it ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, ''An Essay of Dramatick Poesie'' (1668), para. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Dryden declared Shakespeare "incomparable" because of his disregard for convention:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... in most of the irregular Playes of Shakespeare or [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher]] (for Ben Johnson's are for the most part regular) there is a more masculine fancy and greater spirit in all the writing, then[sic] there is in any of the French.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, ''An Essay of Dramatick Poesie'' (1668), para. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Alexander Pope]] criticizes the violation of the unities in his ''[[Dunciad]]''.  In the 1728 version of the poem, the goddess Dulness notes that "Time himself stands still at her command,/ Realms shift their place, and Ocean turns to land" (''Dunciad'' 1728, i, 69&amp;ndash;70).  Additionally, he notes a violation of unity of action, as tragedy and comedy were mixed.

[[Samuel Johnson]], too, applied the unities to drama in his ''Prefaces to Shakespeare''. He was well aware that Aristotle had only recommended the unity of action, and knew that rules must serve drama, not vice versa:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whether Shakespeare knew the unities, and rejected them by design, or deviated from them by happy ignorance, it is, I think, impossible to decide, and useless to inquire. We may reasonably suppose, that, when he rose to notice, he did not want the counsels and admonitions of scholars and critics, and that he at last deliberately persisted in a practice, which he might have begun by chance. As nothing is essential to the fable, but unity of action, and as the unities of time and place arise evidently from false assumptions, and, by circumscribing the extent of the drama, lessen its variety, I cannot think it much to be lamented, that they were not known by him, or not observed: Nor, if such another poet could arise, should I very vehemently reproach him, that his first act passed at Venice, and his next in Cyprus. Such violations of rules merely positive, become the comprehensive genius of Shakespeare…&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''Preface to his Edition of Shakespeare's Plays (1765),'' ff. a7r&amp;ndash;a7v, para. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Pitcher]], in his [[Arden Shakespeare]] Third Series edition of ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' (2010), argues that Shakespeare was familiar with the unities due to an English translation of ''Poetics'' that became popular around 1608, and that &lt;i&gt;The Winter's Tale&lt;/i&gt; is intentionally breaking all the rules.

The classical unities were influential in dramatic criticism until [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'' (1830); one of the things that made that play controversial at its debut was its violation of these rules of [[classicism]]. In the Spanish theatrical tradition, there is [[Lope de Vega]]'s ''Arte nuevo de hacer comedias'' of 1609, which is a defense of the new form for writing and representation of [[Spanish Golden Age|Golden Age]] Spanish theatre. Lope's ''Arte nuevo'' is a 389 verse poem which explicitly defends his and other dramaturges, distancing from Aristotelian unities of theatre.

James Plucknett formed a partnership with Frederick Collier in the 1860s, with a showroom in [[Leamington Spa]], and workshops in Warwick where [[Ambrose Heal]] was an apprentice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrustcollections.org.uk/object/10615.1|title=Cylinder bureau|publisher=[[National Trust]]|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm advertised themselves as:&lt;ref name=Bonhams/&gt;
{{cquote|Collier and Plucknett: upholsterers, cabinet-makers and decorators by appointment to Her Majesty, and Manufacturers of rich carved furniture in the peculiar styles characteristic of the Gothic, Tudor and Elizabethan ages}}
From adverts in trade directories the firm gained a wider reputation across the [[United Kingdom]], with national commissions supplementing work from local families. Their best known works were for [[William Gibbs (businessman)|William Gibbs]], who commissioned [[John Norton (architect)|John Norton]] to remodel his country house, [[Tyntesfield]]. [[William Cubitt|William Cubitt &amp; Co.]] were the sub-contracted builders, whose formeman was George Plucknett, a relative of James Plucknett.&lt;ref name=Bonhams/&gt; Today, Tyntesfield is a [[National Trust]] property, and as well as items of furniture visitors can view the fully fitted Collier and Plucknett bathroom of Matilda Blanche Gibbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntprints.com/image.php?imgref=127927|title=Matilda Blanche Gibb's new bathroom, refitted by the cabinetmakers Collier &amp; Plucknett at Tyntesfield|publisher=[[National Trust]]|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Collier retired and the old firm was dissolved in January 1880,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://http |title=Dissolution of Collier and Plucknett Ltd |publisher=[[London Gazette]] |date=31 December 1880 |accessdate=3 April 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114075411/http://http// |archivedate=14 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plucknett went into partnership with James Steevens and they traded as Plucknett and Steevens. The partnership lasted six years and included the 1884 commission for the Town Hall in Leamington Spa. Plucknett traded independently from 1886 and in 1892 provided the furnishings for The Royal Pavilion at the Royal Agricultural Show.&lt;ref name=Bonhams/&gt;

The firm ceased trading in 1908 and the remaining stock was auctioned off.&lt;ref name=Bonhams&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/16879/lot/206/|title=Victorian carved oak Overmantel Mirror|publisher=[[Bonhams]]|date=18 Nov 2009|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''conservation scientist''' is a museum professional who works in the field of [[Conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]] and whose focus is on the research of [[cultural heritage]] (e.g. art, artifacts, buildings, and monuments) through scientific inquiry. Conservation scientists conduct applied scientific research and techniques to determine the material, chemical, and technical aspects of cultural heritage. The technical information conservation scientists gather is then used by [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] and [[curators]] to decide the most suitable [[conservation-restoration|conservation]] treatments for the examined object and/or adds to our knowledge about the object by providing answers about the material composition, fabrication, authenticity, and previous restoration treatments.

==Responsibilities and duties==
The main responsibility of a conservation scientist is to provide analytical and technical support for the preservation and restoration of cultural objects using scientific analysis and techniques.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Whitmore, P. (Eds.). (2005). [http://mac.mellon.org/NSF-MellonWorkshop/Whitmore%20White%20paper.pdf Conservation Science Research: Activities, Needs, and Funding Opportunities]. (A Report to the National Science Foundation). Retrieved April 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  These tasks are accomplished primarily in four ways: 1.) the identification of materials and fabrication of an object, 2.) studying the degradation mechanisms of the objects, 3.) developing and testing conservation-restoration treatments, and 4.) developing and testing new analytical techniques and equipment. Each task is properly documented by conservation scientists with such information as composition, condition, history, and suggested treatments.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  Additionally, many of these tasks require conservation scientists to collaborate with other museum professionals and industrial/mainstream scientists in order to properly accomplish them, in particular with conservators and curators (see Related positions).

===Identification===
[[File:IMA Conservation Scientist using Raman spectroscopy 1.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Conservation scientist using [[Raman spectroscopy]] at the Indianapolis Museum of Art.]]
The identification of an object’s component materials is the most basic of conservation science tasks.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  This is typically accomplished using non-destructive examination techniques or, if necessary, destructive analytical techniques designed for small samples (see Instruments and uses). The information yielded about the object’s material composition aids in the development of preventive conservation measures- such as lighting and humidity controls-and the selection of appropriate restoration treatments. The analysis of materials can also lead to discoveries about the object’s origin and fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. (2013). [http://www.mfah.org/research/conservation/conservation-science/ Conservation Science]. Retrieved April 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such studies, called technical art history, can provide insight into the time period of an object, its authenticity, the artist, and previous restoration treatments. In addition to leading to new interpretations, this information impacts the selection of treatments by conservators and conservation scientists.

===Degradation===
Another key focus of conservation science is studying the degradation or deterioration mechanism of objects. Using chemical analysis, conservation scientists can determine the underlying material processes (i.e. aging and chemical reactions), risk factors, and environmental conditions causing the objects to degrade.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;The Getty Conservation Institute. (2013) [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/about/science/ Science Department]. Retrieved April 13, 2104.&lt;/ref&gt;  This information can then be used by conservation scientists, in collaboration with conservators, to develop appropriate treatments for objects, in particular treatments that can provide long-term stability and preservation for the examined object.

===Development of conservation-restoration treatments===
The continuing development of new conservation materials (e.g. cleaning solvents) and techniques is an essential aspect of the conservation of cultural heritage. This research ensures the continued existence of cultural heritage in the best condition possible considering their age and degradation. Conservators often rely on conservation scientists for their scientific knowledge and skills in the development of these materials and treatments. Conservation scientists are asked to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of current materials and treatments, to improve those material/techniques, and to devise new materials and techniques.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  The goal is to develop conservation treatments and materials that can slow the degradation of materials and further damage effectively and without harming the object.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Development of new analytical techniques and equipment===
In addition to developing conservation treatments and materials, conservation scientists collaborate with industrial scientists and instrument manufactures in the development of new analytical techniques and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Indianapolis Museum of Art. (n.d.). [http://www.imamuseum.org/research/conservation-science Conservation Science]. Retrieved April 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservation scientists are constantly looking for and developing new techniques and instruments that improve the condition and treatment of objects. To this end, scientists are developing new techniques and instruments to: decrease and eliminate the need for sampling objects to minimize collateral damage, better analyze materials, document results, improve ease (e.g. portability), improve environmental monitoring.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===Education===
In addition to their scientific responsibilities, conservation scientists have a duty to help educate new conservations scientists, the conservation field, and the public as part of their ethical code.&lt;ref&gt;(AIC. (1994). [http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core-documents/code-of-ethics#.U1WY6I1OUeE Core Documents: Code of Ethics]. Retrieved April 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  To ensure the continuation and quality of their profession, conservation scientists are involved in the training of new conservation scientists as members in academic conservation departments, adjunct faculty, and as mentors to those in fellowships, internships, and entry-level jobs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  Conservation scientists also help educate the conservation community at large by disseminating their research to promote the growth and use of the best conservation practices and materials. Lastly, conservation scientists educate the public about conservation science to promote awareness of about the field and its importance to the preservation of our cultural heritage.

==Knowledge, abilities, and skills==
The basic knowledge, skills, and abilities needed by conservation scientists are:
*advance knowledge in a physical or applied science discipline (e.g. physics, chemistry, material science, biology, engineering, and geology)
*basic knowledge of conservation and relevant humanities disciplines (e.g. art history, archaeology, anthropology, history, fine arts, etc.)
*critical thinking and creative problem solving
*the ability to formulate and carry out research&lt;ref&gt;EPISCON. (1999). [http://www.episcon.scienze.unibo.it/episcon/ Bologna document] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140421220515/http://www.episcon.scienze.unibo.it/episcon/ |date=2014-04-21 }}. Retrieved April 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
*experience using a broad range of analytical techniques and equipment (see Instrumentation and uses)
*the ability to collaborate and work in a team
*the ability to communicate effectively

==Instrumentation and uses==
[[File:IMA Conservation Science Lab.JPG|thumb|right|500px|Indianapolis Museum of Art Conservation Science Laboratory.]]
Conservation scientists use a variety of microscopic, spectroscopic, chromatographic, and other scientific techniques and instruments to physically and chemically examine objects.&lt;ref&gt;Indianapolis Museum of Art. (n.d.). [http://www.imamuseum.org/research/conservation-science/instrumentation Instrumentation]. Retrieved April 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-destructive techniques are favored by conservation scientists so to preserve the originality, integrity, and current state of the object as much as possible. Such non-destructive methods include visual examination, advanced imaging techniques, and X-rays.&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. (n.d.). [http://www.mfah.org/research/conservation/conservation-science/ Conservation Science]. Retrieved April 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes, sampling an object is unavoidable. In these cases, microscopic fragments are removed from the object- rarely visible to the naked eye- and their original location is documented. The scientific and ethical demands of a conservation scientist require a variety of instruments- taken from mainstream science and slightly modified- in order to conduct their research properly. Listed below are some of the most commonly used instruments in museum laboratories today and how they are used by conservation scientists.

==Education and training==
There is much discussion and debate in the field of conservation science about the amount and type of education and training that should be required for people entering the field. Currently, there is no one set path to becoming a conservation scientist. A 2013 survey conducted by the International Center for the Study of Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property ([[ICCROM]]) on the education and training paths for conservation scientists worldwide concluded that:

{{quotation | the largest categories of recommend qualifications are the combinations BA+MA (24%) in conservation and BSc+MA in Conservation (23%). The majority, 87%, thinks you need both science and conservation qualifications. 44% of the respondents thing you should have 0-2 years of working experience, and 41% think you need 3 years or more.&lt;ref&gt;ICCROM. (2013). [http://forum2013.iccrom.org/background-research/ Survey of Conservation Education Programes] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140413211840/http://forum2013.iccrom.org/background-research/ |date=2014-04-13 }}. Retrieved April 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This survey demonstrates that there is no worldwide consensus on the type and amount of education and training needed to become a conservation scientist, resulting in regional and institutional variations.

In the United States, the most common route taken is an advanced degree in a physical, natural, or applied science discipline such as physics, chemistry, material science, biology, engineering, and geology.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Trentelman, K. (Summer 2005). [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/20_2/news_in_cons1.html Training and Education in Conservation Science]. GCI Newsletter, 20.2. Retrieved April 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Master’s degrees are acceptable, but most conservation scientists have their PhD. In fact, a doctoral degree is becoming an increasingly common requirement for even entry-level conservation science positions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;  A basic knowledge of conservation theory and practice, art history, and/or other relevant humanities disciplines (e.g. archaeology, anthropology, fine arts, history, etc.) is also essential. Scientists seeking to enter the field typically gain this experience and knowledge through postdoctoral fellowships. There are several postdoctoral programs in particular for scientists to receive specialized training in conservation science, including those at the [[National Gallery of Art]] (the Charles Culpepper Fellowships), Harvard University Art Museum, and the [[Getty Conservation Institute]]. Numerous museums and cultural institutions also have individual advanced training fellowships in conservation science through such organizations as the Kress Foundation and the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;  The Northwestern University-Art Institute of Chicago Center for Scientific Studies (NU-ACCESS) is one example of an Andrew W. Mellon funded fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;Northwestern University. (2013).

In Europe, there are two common routes taken to become a conservation scientist.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;EPISCON. (1999). [http://www.episcon.scienze.unibo.it/episcon/bologna-document Bologna document] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140420015519/http://www.episcon.scienze.unibo.it/episcon/bologna-document |date=2014-04-20 }}. Retrieved April 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first path is a postgraduate course in conservation science that includes training, research, and practice/experience with practicing conservators-restorers. The European PhD in Science for Conservation (EPISCON), which is a three-year fellowship program at ten participating institutions, is an example of such a program.

Retrieved April 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The second pathway is on the job training on a conservation science team combined with continuous professional development.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==Professional organizations==
As a unique mixture of academic disciplines, conservation scientists may join an assortment of professional organizations to suit their varied needs and specializations. These organizations may include those dedicated solely to conservation science, conservation, or a related science field. Many of the general conservation and related science organizations, in fact, have specialized groups for conservation science. The [[American Ceramic Society]], for example, has an Art, Archaeology, and Conservation Science division devoted to advancing the scientific study of ceramics and their preservation.&lt;ref&gt;The American Ceramic Society. (2013). [http://ceramics.org/divisions/art-division Art, Archaeology and Conservation Science Division.] Retrieved April 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved April 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the similar nature of their duties, they most frequently work with conservators (i.e. [[conservator-restorer]] and [[object conservator]]) and [[curators]] to complete technical studies on the objects in their museum’s collection to determine the materials used, the artist’s techniques, the authenticity of the work, and previous conservation treatments. These three professions also collaborate to determine conservation treatment goals and the ideal environmental conditions ([[preventive conservation]]) for the objects. [[Exhibition designers]], [[architects]], and [[collection managers]] also consult with conservation scientists to ensure that environmental conditions are suitable for the objects while either in storage or on display.

Industrial scientists are also consulted by conservation scientists about object materials and chemical studies. The two groups of scientists, along with instrument manufactures, also collaborate “to develop and adapt new non-invasive analytical techniques.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

'''''Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia''''' (Hodder &amp; Stoughton. {{ISBN|0-340-66637-4}}) is a 1988 autobiographical crime book written by [[Joseph D. Pistone]] (assisted by Richard Woodley) about his story as an [[FBI agent]] going undercover and infiltrating the [[American mafia|Mafia]]. In 1997, the book was made into a feature film titled ''[[Donnie Brasco (film)|Donnie Brasco]]'', starring [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Al Pacino]]. Louis DiGiaimo, a casting director who worked on ''[[The Godfather]]'' and a childhood friend of Pistone, consulted on the book and film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.moviefone.com/2012/02/27/donnie-brasco-15th-anniversary "''Donnie Brasco'' 15th Anniversary: 25 Things You Didn't Know About Johnny Depp's Classic Mob Movie"]. ''The Moviefone Blog''.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was re-released in a second edition the same year the film was released.

== Plot ==

Pistone becomes an [[FBI agent]] after spending time working for [[Naval Intelligence]]. He first goes undercover to infiltrate a [[theft]] ring. The operation pays off when the FBI arrests one of the largest and most profitable theft rings in history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/06/0610_050610_tv_mafia.html "FBI Agent ''Donnie Brasco'' Recalls Life in the Mafia"] ''National Geographic News'', June 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the success of the operation, the FBI and Pistone consider going undercover and infiltrating [[truck hijacking]] gangs and the [[American mafia|Mafia]]. After months of preparation, the FBI erases Pistone's personal history and he goes undercover as Donald Brasco, an expert jewel thief from [[Miami, Florida]]. Hanging out at known crime spots, such as bars and social clubs, he eventually befriends a bartender and joins a crime gang.

He moves on to Jilly Greca's crew, who are associates in the [[Colombo crime family]]. The crew are involved in truck hijacking and selling stolen merchandise. Brasco meets [[Anthony Mirra]] and the two begin hanging out. Mirra is a soldier in the [[Bonanno crime family]] and is a lot better connected, respected and feared than Greca's crew. Brasco decides it would be a better choice for the operation to go with Mirra, so he starts hanging out more with Mirra.

Through Mirra, Brasco meets another Bonanno soldier called [[Benjamin "Lefty" Ruggiero]]. When Mirra is sent back to prison, Brasco and Lefty become close friends. Brasco gains the reputation of being a trustworthy and good earner. He is responsible for several lucrative business ventures, including the ''Kings Court Bottle Club'' in Florida, which begins a good relationship with the Bonannos and [[Santo Trafficante, Jr.|Santo Trafficante]].

The Bonannos, particularly captain [[Dominick "Sonny Black" Napolitano]], are happy with Brasco's work and are prepared to sponsor him for membership into the mafia. Brasco struggles in his personal life because he does not see his real family often, spending months without seeing his wife and three daughters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/26/nyregion/inside-the-mob-agent-recalls-game-of-wits.html "Inside the Mob: Agent Recalls 'Game of Wits'"]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; A family dispute breaks out over who "[[own]]s" Donnie Brasco. Mirra claims he owns him since he brought him in, Lefty says he owns him because he was the first to put a claim on him, and Sonny Black as the captain says Brasco belongs to him.

After six years undercover, the operation becomes increasingly dangerous. Three powerful captains are murdered; gunned down by fellow Bonanno family members. The FBI want to pull the plug on the operation due to the danger of Brasco getting killed. Pistone wants to stay at least until he gets "[[Made man|made]]", in order to prove that the mafia is not invincible. A date is set when Brasco is ordered to come out of the operation. There are six weeks left until Brasco is revealed to be an FBI agent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120722035630/http://www.biography.com/notorious/crimefiles.do?catId=259452&amp;action=view&amp;profileId=262890&amp;selectedIndex=1&amp;sectionName=Biography "True Story – ''Donnie Brasco''"] . ''Biography.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

To become a made man, Brasco is ordered to kill [[Anthony "Bruno" Indelicato]], although Bruno has fled New York. FBI agents eventually reveal to Sonny Black that their associate is actually an agent. Although Sonny Black and others consider it hard to believe that Brasco is an agent, he informs his superiors. The men responsible for bringing Brasco into the family are ordered to be murdered. Sonny Black and Mirra are murdered, while Lefty escapes death when he is arrested before he arrives at a meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mafianewsreport.com/bonanno-mobster-bruno-indelicato-files-for-release-from-prison "Bonanno mobster Bruno Indelicato files for release from prison"]. ''Mafia News Report'', July 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pistone's work is not complete yet as he has to testify at trials all over America. Operation Donnie Brasco leads to more than 200 indictments and over 100 convictions of mafia members.

The '''''Eufemiavisorna''''' are a group of three medieval romances translated into [[Old Swedish|medieval Swedish]]: ''[[Ywain|Herr Ivan lejonriddaren]]'' (1303), ''[[Hertig Fredrik av Normandie]]'' (1301 or 1308), and ''[[Floris and Blancheflour|Flores och Blanzeflor]]'' (probably 1312). They are known in Swedish (and generally in English) as the ''Eufemiavisorna'', 'the Euphemia poems' (or, without the definite article, the ''Eufemiavisor'') or, less commonly, ''Eufemiaromanerna'', 'the Euphemia romances'; they are known in Norwegian ([[bokmål]]) as the ''Eufemiavisene''. The romances are an early example of the poetic form known as [[Knittelvers]]; are the first known Scandinavian renderings of Continental European [[chivalric romance]] in verse; and are one of the first major works of literature in Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 172-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and content==

Scandinavian translations of Continental European romance began with [[Chivalric sagas|prose translations]] in the Norwegian court. The ''Eufemiavisorna'' represent a further stage of adaptation of Romance, using verse. They are named after Norway's Queen [[Euphemia of Rügen]] (1270–1312): in the fullest manuscript attestations, there is a colophon at the end of each romance indicating that she commissioned the translations. The translations are thought to represent Euphemia's effort to bring Continental courtly culture to the royal court of Sweden.

It is not known who translated the poems, but scholarly consensus supports the idea that there was one, clerical translator, intimately familiar with German ''Knittel'' forms.&lt;ref&gt;Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 171-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Herr Ivan'' ===
According to [[Peter Andreas Munch]]'s generally accepted theory, the translation of Chrétien de Troyes's ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion|Yvain]]'' as ''Herr Ivan lejonriddaren'' celebrated the betrothal of Euphemia's daughter [[Ingeborg of Norway|Ingeborg]]'s abortive betrothal to [[Magnus Birgerson]] in 1302. ''Herr Ivan'' is 6,645 lines and, in the assessment of Gösta Holm,

: It is generally maintained that the Swedish translator used MSS both of the Old French ''Yvain'' and of the Old Norwegian ''Íven(t)''. The end of the poem states that it was translated ''af valske tungo'' ("from the French language"). The translator deals freely with his originals; he shortens, revises, and makes additions. The narration is more expansive in the latter part. The additions are often mechanical and especially frequent in rhyme position.&lt;ref&gt;Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 171-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Hertig Fredrik'' ===
The reason for the 3,310-line translation of ''Hertig Fredrik av Normandie'' (1308) is not known, and it may not originally have belonged to the ''Eufemiavisorna''. 'On the whole, it is more artistic than its Swedish forerunner, ''Herr Ivan''.' No direct source for this romance survives, but 'the end of the poem states that it was first translated ''aff walsko j tytzt mall'' ("from French into German"), at the instance of [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto]]. This information is generally accepted by scholars, although no German text is known'.&lt;ref&gt;Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 171-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Flores och Blanzeflor'' ===
The translation of the anonymous Old French ''[[Floris and Blancheflour]]'' as the 2,192-line ''Flores och Blanzeflor'' seems to have been composed in 1312&lt;ref&gt;Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 171-73.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Munch's theory may have marked Ingeborg's successful marriage in 1312 to [[Eric, Duke of Södermanland]]. The translation is based on the Norwegian translation of the French.

=== Danish translation ===
The ''Eufemiavisorna'' were translated into Danish at the beginning of the sixteenth century; there are two other independent Danish versions of ''[[Ywain]]''.

==Form==

According to Gösta Holm, 'The style, rhyme technique, and vocabulary of the ''Eufemiavisorna'' are to a great extent influenced by German patterns; the translator(s) must have been acquainted with the culture of the South. Thus, French originals have had a surprisingly insignificant influence on the form of the ''Eufemiavisorna''.'

: Like the English adapters of the 13th and 14th centuries, the author of the ''Eufemiavisorna'' possessed a weak sensitivity to the subtle and refined aspects of courtly romance. The intricate analysis of the emotional life of characters, especially women, in the best French romances, was foreign to the author of the ''Eufemiavisorna''. Instead, he was very font of manly sports, ''torney'', ''dyost'' ("tournaments, jousts"), and the like, fights, grand assemblies, and vivid scenes in the knights' castles. In short, the main themes of the ''Eufemiavisorna'' are adventures, fights, and love.&lt;ref&gt;Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 171-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==

The Danish translations of the Swedish ''Eufemiavisorna'' derive from lost manuscripts closer to the archetypes than our surviving Swedish ones, and therefore have an independent text-critical value for reconstructing the Swedish translations.&lt;ref&gt;Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 171-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Government College of Art &amp; Craft''' in [[Kolkata]] is one of the oldest Art colleges in India. It was founded on August 16, 1854 at Garanhata, [[Chitpur]], "with the purpose of establishing an institution for teaching the youth of all classes, industrial art based on scientific methods." as the School of Industrial Art. The institute was later renamed as the Government School of Art and in 1951 it became the Government College of Art &amp; Craft.&lt;ref name=bagal&gt;Bagal, Jogesh Chandra (1966). ''History of the Govt. College of Art and Craft'' in the ''Centenary: Government College of Art &amp; Craft, Calcutta'', Calcutta: Government College of Art &amp; Craft, pp. 1–58&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The school opened on August 16, 1854 at Garanhata as a private art school. The school was shifted to the building of [[Mutty Lall Seal]] in Colootola in November, 1854. In 1859, Garick joined as Head Teacher. In 1864, it was taken over by the government and on June 29, 1864 [[Henry Hover Locke]] joined as its principal. It was soon renamed as the Government School of Art. Locke made a comprehensive scheme of Curriculum of studies for the institution. The venue of the school was shifted to 166, Bowbazar Street in the 1880s. After the death of Locke on December 25, 1885 M. Schaumburg became the new principal. A new post of an Assistant Principal was created and on January 29, 1886 an Italian artist O. Ghilardi joined the post. In February, 1892 the institute was shifted to its present site adjacent to the [[Indian Museum]].

===Havell, Brown and Abanindranath===
[[Ernest Binfield Havel]] was the principal from 1896 to 1905. He attempted to reform teaching to emphasise Indian traditions, leading to the emergence of the style known as the [[Bengal school of art]]. [[Percy Brown (scholar)|Percy Brown]] was the next principal, who took over from the officiating Principal Abanindranath Tagore on January 12, 1909. He served as Principal up to 1927.&lt;ref name=bagal/&gt; From August 15, 1905 to 1915, [[Abanindranath Tagore]] was the Vice-Principal of the college, and worked towards developing an ''Indian style of Art'', which gave birth to the [[Bengal school of art]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080624035401/http://www.indiaeducation.ernet.in/insitutions/PROFILE.ASP?no=U00336 Govt. College of Art and Craft]. indiaeducation.ernet.in&lt;/ref&gt; an agenda that was to be pursued at the [[Kala Bhavan]], [[Shantiniketan]].

"'''Hey Kid, Catch!'''" was a [[television advertisement|television commercial]] for [[Coca-Cola]] starring [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] defensive tackle [[Joe Greene|"Mean" Joe Greene]].   The commercial debuted on October 1, 1979, and was re-aired multiple times, most notably during [[Super Bowl XIV]] in 1980. The 60-second commercial won a [[Clio Award]] for being one of the best television commercials of 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-10-best-award-winning-tv-ads-everyone-must-see-2011-1?op=1|title=The 10 Best Award-Winning TV Ads Everyone Must See|date=January 18, 2011|website=Business Insider|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its planning and filming stages, [[McCann Erickson]], the advertising agency that created the commercial, used the working title "Mean Joe Greene".  The commercial was a part of Coca-Cola's "Have a Coke and a Smile" ad campaign of the late 1970s.  The commercial's set-up and payoff is classic simple advertising.

==The Commercial==
After sustaining an injury during a football game, Greene is limping alone into the tunnel toward the Steelers' locker room when a young boy (played by Tommy Okon) comes up behind him offering his help, which Greene declines.  After telling Greene that he still thinks he's the best, the boy offers him his bottle of Coke, which Greene refuses at first, but the boy wants him to have it; Greene sheepishly accepts it with thanks and drinks the entire bottle as the boy quietly says "See ya 'round" and slowly walks away.  When Greene finishes the Coke he turns back to the boy and says "Hey, Kid..  Catch,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xffOCZYX6F8|title=Coca-Cola Classic ad: Mean Joe Greene [Full Version] (1979)|date=July 17, 2007|website=YouTube|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; tossing his jersey (slung over his shoulder) to the surprised boy who happily says "Wow!  Thanks, Mean Joe!".  Greene casts a smile toward the boy before continuing his trek to the locker room.

The commercial has been listed as one of the top ads of all time by multiple sources, including ''[[TV Guide]]''. The ad later received worldwide acclaim when it was re-filmed in various countries using indigenous sports figures in each version.  

The campaign's art director was Roger Mosconi, the writer was Penny Hawkey, and the singers of the "Coke and a Smile" jingle were Jim Campbell, Don Thomas, Liz Corrigan, Shellie Littman, Arlene Martell, and [[Linda November]]. The footage was shot in May 1979 at a small stadium in [[Mount Vernon, New York]], and the commercial first aired on October 1, 1979 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', though its airing during Super Bowl XIV in 1980 brought it the most attention due to the program's enormous audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=December 17, 1979|last=Isaacs|first=Stan|title=Mean Joe: Goliath plays Othello|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1126412/1/index.htm|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=At the request of the singers in the audience, Arlene sang "A Coke and a Smile", a classic jingle with Mean Joe Green which has played every year for a decade on ''Super Bowl's Greatest Commercials'', and in 2009 was voted into the Super Bowl Hall of Fame. Singers on the commercial are Jim Campbell, Don Thomas, Liz Corrigan, Shellie Littman, Arlene Martell, and Linda November|title=Singers' Seminar explores steps to success|url=http://www.aftra.org/documents/FALL2010_STAND_FINAL%281%29.pdf|format=pdf|date=Fall 2010|volume=43|number=2|website=[[AFTRA]]|location=New York|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greene later recalled that in filming the commercial, it took several takes to get his final line in the commercial in without burping. "Between me belching and going to the men's room, it took three days to film it," Greene recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fowler|first1=Scott|title=Mean Joe Greene's biggest hit was also his most memorable 'catch'|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-03-01/sports/1992061149_1_joe-greene-okon-coke|accessdate=January 3, 2017|work=Baltimore Sun|date=March 1, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the commercial was also shown during the 2004 film [[Miracle (2004 film)|Miracle]] when the USA vs. USSR hockey game was on a commercial break.

==Parodies and homages==
*In 1983, the television show "Newhart" paid homage to the commercial in the first season episode "A View from the Bench" when a limping Celtics player throws his basketball shoes to Bob Newhart on his way to the locker room.

* During [[Super Bowl XLIII]] in 2009, Coca-Cola aired a parody to the ad to promote its [[Coca-Cola Zero]] brand, starring former Steelers player [[Troy Polamalu]] in Greene's role. Continuing an ongoing theme in promotion for the beverage, the ad is interrupted by Coca-Cola "brand managers" who accuse Polamalu of "stealing" their commercial, prompting the [[safety (gridiron football position)|safety]] to tackle one of them and give the child their shirt.&lt;ref name=freep-09ads&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinds|first=Julie|title=Super Bowl ads deliver big laughs|url=http://archive.freep.com/article/20090202/ENT03/902020367/Super-Bowl-ads-deliver-big-laughs|website=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=March 20, 2015|date=February 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abchron-meanjoezero&gt;{{cite web|title=Coke to reprise 'Mean Joe' commercial for Super Bowl|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2009/01/26/daily11.html|website=Atlanta Business Chronicle|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2011, an episode of ''[[SportsNation (TV series)|SportsNation]]'' on [[ESPN2]] briefly parodied this commercial which featured sportscaster [[Michelle Beadle]] in Greene's role. In the commercial, after finishing the soda, instead of the jersey, she "accidentally" throws the empty soda bottle back to the child as it breaks on the wall at the end and then apologizes after that "mishap". In addition, the commercial tried to look like the late 70s/early 80s font titles with the words "Facebook.com/SportsNation" and "Have Some ''"SportsNation"'' and a smile" and "Sports is Life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Davis | first=Glenn | url=http://www.sportsgrid/com/real-sport/nfl/videos-espns-Michelle-beadle-shoots-some-super-bowl-commercials/ |title=ESPN'S Michelle Beadle Shoots Some Super Bowl Commercials (Mean Joe Greene is mentioned in the article)| date=January 31, 2011 | accessdate=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An advertisement for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television drama series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', first aired during [[Super Bowl XLV]], parodies the original commercial with a similar scene in which Dr. Gregory House, played by [[Hugh Laurie]], throws his cane to a young fan played by [[Preston Bailey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailyastorian.com/news/free/article_f4a618f2-2fe8-11e0-a807-001cc4c002e0.html | title=Former Seaside boy set to appear in Super Bowl commercial Sunday | date=February 4, 2011 | website=The Daily Astorian | accessdate=February 7, 2011 | location=Astoria, Oregon | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206235639/http://www.dailyastorian.com/news/free/article_f4a618f2-2fe8-11e0-a807-001cc4c002e0.html | archivedate=February 6, 2011 | df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2012, Greene reprised his role in a [[Downy]] Unstopables ad for [[Super Bowl XLVI]] entitled "Stinky", where [[Amy Sedaris]] rejects Greene's jersey because it smelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=McManis | first=Andrew |  url=http://adweeek.com/brand-marketing/cokes-classic-super-bowl-ad-gets-stinky-137882 | title=Coke's Classic Super Bowl Ad Gets 'Stinky' | date=January 31, 2012 | accessdate=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hong Kong Ballet''' (香港芭蕾舞團) is a classical ballet company founded in 1979.

== History ==

The Company was created in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.luxury-insider.com/luxury-news/2009/06/hong-kong-ballet-dances-through-the-galaxy|title=Hong Kong Ballet Dances Through The Galaxy|website=Luxury-insider.com|date=24 June 2009|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1997, The Hong Kong Ballet has concluded more than 30 tours to 10 countries in North and South America, Europe and Asia.

In January 2010, Faye Leung, the Company's former top ballerina, revealed in a book that she was sacked from the HK Ballet on suspicious that she was dividing dancers and organizing a strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/article/704083/i-was-sacked-splitting-hk-ballet-dancer-writes|title=I was sacked for splitting HK Ballet, dancer writes|website=Scmp.com|date=19 January 2010|author=Olga Wong|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, the Company took part in Expo 2010 Shanghai, presenting a mixed bill production and performing as part of Festive Hong Kong Celebration.  The Hong Kong Ballet’s dancers also performed at the 4th and 5th International Dance Festivals held in Cali, Colombia; the 50th Anniversary International Gala in Brisbane, Australia; and the International Ballettgala XI in Dortmund, Germany. Most recently, the Company presented ''Firecracker'' in Macau in January 2012. In the summer of 2012, The Hong Kong Ballet toured the United States and Canada with a mixed bill featuring two specially commissioned contemporary ballets. The Company made its debut appearance at [[Jacob’s Pillow]] Dance Festival and then performed in Aspen, Montreal and Santa Fe.

In June 2017, Septime Webre, of Cuban-American origins, previously the artistic director of [[The Washington Ballet]] for 17 years, was named Artistic Director of the Ballet. For 2018, he planned a contemporary program which featured the music of the [[Beatles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hk.asiatatler.com/life/why-septime-webre-believes-the-beatles-and-the-ballet-are-a-perfect-match|title=Why Septime Webre Believes The Beatles And The Ballet Are A Perfect Match|website=Asiatatler.com|date=26 February 2018|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also organized ''Ballet in the City'', outdoors dancing events in different art galleries of the city, and a series of other events "to insert the company and its dancers into the social fabric of the city".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zolimacitymag.com/septime-webre-has-three-years-to-make-ballet-relevant-to-hong-kong-heres-how-hell-do-it/|title=Septime Webre has 3 years to make ballet relevant to Hong Kong: here's how he'll do it|website=Zolimacitymag.com|date=9 November 2017|author=Simon Cartledge|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Great Mosque of Kairouan, prayer hall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Hypostyle prayer hall of the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]], in Tunisia.]]

In [[architecture]], a '''hypostyle''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|p|ə|ˌ|s|t|aɪ|l|,_|ˈ|h|ɪ|p|ə|-}}) [[hall]] has a roof which is supported by columns.

==Etymology==
The word ''hypostyle'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ὑπόστυλος ''hypóstȳlos'' meaning "under columns" (where ὑπό ''hypó'' means below or underneath and στῦλος ''stŷlos'' means column).&lt;ref name=""&gt;"Hypostyle", Random House Dictionary (unabridged) 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical options==
The roof may be constructed of with bridging [[lintels]] of stone, wood or other rigid material such as cast iron, steel or reinforced concrete. There may be a ceiling. The columns may be all the same height or, as in the case of the [[Great Hypostyle Hall]] at [[Karnak]], the columns flanking the central space may be of greater height rather than those of the side aisles, allowing openings in the wall above the smaller columns, through which light is admitted over the aisle roof, through [[clerestory]] windows. 

===Applications===
The architectural form has many applications, occurring in the [[cella]] of [[Architecture of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] temples and in many Asian buildings, particularly of wood construction.

===Mosques===
With a combination of columns and [[arch]]es, the hypostyle hall became one of the two main types of [[mosque]] construction. In many mosques, especially the early congregational mosques, the prayer hall has the hypostyle form.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.tn/books?id=IJrN8rDirxkC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;dq=hypostyle+early+congregational+mosques&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=A3ZeTdnSHIGDOtr6-PUN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=hypostyle%20early%20congregational%20mosques&amp;f=false Fred S. Kleiner, ''Gardner's art through the ages : the western perspective'', Cengage Learning, 2010, p. 265]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the finest examples of the hypostyle-plan mosques is the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] (also called the Mosque of Uqba) in the city of [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.tn/books?id=IJrN8rDirxkC&amp;pg=PA267&amp;dq=Gardner%27s+art+mosque+of+kairouan&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=2XleTezUM8fpOd2jjMAN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fred S.

{{Indigenous music of North America}}
'''Indigenous music of North America''', which includes '''American Indian music''' or '''Native American music''', is the 
[[music]] that is used, created or performed by [[Indigenous peoples of North America]], including [[Native Americans in the United States]] and [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]], [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico]], and other [[North America]]n countries—especially traditional [[tribe (American Indian)|tribal]] music, such as [[Pueblo music]] and [[Inuit music]]. In addition to the traditional music of the Native American groups, there now exist [[pan-Indianism|pan-tribal]] and intertribal [[genre (music)|genres]] as well as distinct Native American [[subgenre]]s of [[popular music]] including: [[rock and roll|rock]], [[blues]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[classical music|classical]], [[film music]], and [[reggae]], as well as unique popular styles like [[chicken scratch]] and [[New Mexico music]].

[[Singing]] and [[percussion]] are the most important aspects of traditional Native American music. Vocalization takes many forms, ranging from solo and choral song to responsorial, unison and multipart singing. Percussion, especially drums and rattles, are common accompaniment to keep the rhythm steady for the singers, who generally use their native language or non-lexical [[vocable]]s (nonsense syllables). Traditional music usually begins with slow and steady beats that grow gradually faster and more emphatic, while various flourishes like drum and rattle [[tremolo]]s, shouts and accented patterns add variety and signal changes in performance for [[singer]]s and [[dancer]]s.&lt;ref name="Overview367-368"&gt;Heth, Charlotte, "Overview" in ''[[The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music]]'', pp. 367–368&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Song texts and sources ===
Native American song texts include both public pieces and secret songs, said to be "ancient and unchanging", which are used for only sacred and ceremonial purposes. There are also public sacred songs, as well as ritual speeches that are sometimes perceived as musical because of their use of rhythm and melody. These ritual speeches often directly describe the events of a ceremony, and the reasons and ramifications of the night.&lt;ref&gt;Heth, pp. 368–370&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vocable]]s, or lexically meaningless syllables, are a common part of many kinds of Native American songs. They frequently mark the beginning and end of phrases, sections or songs themselves. Often songs make frequent use of vocables and other untranslatable elements. Songs that are translatable include historical songs, like the Navajo "[[Shi' naasha']], which celebrates the end of Navajo internment in [[Fort Sumner, New Mexico]] in 1868. Tribal flag songs and national anthems are also a major part of the Native American musical corpus, and are a frequent starter to public ceremonies, especially [[powwow]]s. Native American music also includes a range of [[courtship]] songs, dancing songs and popular American or Canadian tunes like "[[Amazing Grace]], "[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]", "[[Jambalaya (song)|Jambalaya]]" and "[[Sugar Time]]". Many songs celebrate harvest, planting season or other important times of year.&lt;ref&gt;Heth, pg. 368-369&lt;/ref&gt;

== Societal role ==
[[File:UIATF Pow Wow 2007 - drummers 05A.jpg|thumb|300px|United Indians of All Tribes Foundation drummers at the Seafair Indian Days [[Pow Wow]], [[Daybreak Star Cultural Center]], [[Seattle, Washington]]]]
Native American music plays a vital role in history and education, with ceremonies and stories orally passing on ancestral customs to new generations. Native American ceremonial music is traditionally said to originate from deities or spirits, or from particularly respected individuals. Rituals are shaped by every aspect of song, dance and costuming, and each aspect informs about the "makers, wearers and symbols important to the nation, tribe, village, clan, family, or individual".&lt;ref&gt;Overview 367–368&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans perform stories through song, music and dance, and the historical facts thus propagated are an integral part of Native American beliefs. Epic legends and stories about culture heroes are a part of tribal music traditions, and these tales are often an iconic part of local culture.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; They can vary slightly from year to year, with leaders recombining and introducing slight variations. The [[Pueblo]] compose a number of new songs each year in a committee which uses dreams and visions.&lt;ref&gt;Herndon, pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

The styles and purposes of music vary greatly between and among each Native American tribe. However, a common concept amongst many indigenous groups is a conflation of music and power. For example, the [[Pima people|Pima]] people feel many of their songs were given in the beginning and sung by the Creator. It was believed that some people then have more of an inclination to musical talent than others because of an individual's peculiar power.&lt;ref&gt;Herndon 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender ===
[[File:SE turtle shackles 1920s OHS.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Southeast women's turtleshell leg rattles, ca. 1920, collection of the [[Oklahoma History Center]]]]
Within various Native American communities, gender plays an important role in music. Men and women play sex-specific roles in many musical activities. Instruments, songs and dances are often peculiar to one or the other sex, and many musical settings are strictly controlled by sex. In modern powwows, women play a vital role as backup singers and dancers.&lt;ref name="Gender"&gt;Heth, "Overview" in the ''Garland Encyclopaedia of World Music'', pp. 370–372&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cherokee]] people, for example, hold dances before [[Stickball (Native American)|stickball]] games. At these pre-game events, men and women perform separate dances and follow separate regulations. Men will dance in a circle around a fire, while women dance in place. Men sing their own songs, while women have their songs sung for them by an [[American Indian elder|elder]]. Whereas the men's songs invoke power, the women's songs draw power away from the opposing stickball team.&lt;ref name="Herndon124"&gt;Herndon, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; In some societies, there are customs where certain ceremonial drums are to be played by men only. For the Southern Plains Indians, it is believed that the first drum was given to a woman by the Great Spirit, who instructed her to share it with all women of native nations. However, there also exist prohibitions against women sitting at the Beg Drum.&lt;ref name="Herndon124"/&gt;

Many tribal music cultures have a relative paucity of traditional women's songs and dances, especially in the Northeast and Southeast regions. The Southeast is, however, home to a prominent women's musical tradition in the use of leg rattles for ceremonial [[stomp dance|stomp]] and friendship dances, and the women's singing during [[Horse and Ball Game]] contests. The West Coast tribes of North America tend to more prominence in women's music, with special women's [[love song]]s, [[medicine song]]s and [[handgame]] songs; the Southwest is particularly diverse in women's musical offerings, with major ceremonial, instrumental and social roles in dances. Women also play a vital ceremonial role in the [[Sun Dance]] of the Great Plains and Great Basin, and sing during social dances. [[Shoshone]] women still sang the songs of the [[Ghost Dance]] into the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Gender"/&gt;

== History ==
Music and [[oral history|history]] are tightly interwoven in Native American life. A tribe's history is constantly told and retold through music, which keeps alive an oral narrative of history. These historical narratives vary widely from tribe to tribe and are an integral part of tribal identity. However, their historical authenticity cannot be verified; aside from supposition and some archaeological evidence, the earliest documentation of Native American music came with the arrival of European explorers.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, p. 3 Crawford refers to the "historical knowledge valuable to a Native musician" as falling "more readily into the category of myth than of fact".&lt;/ref&gt; Musical instruments and pictographs depicting music and dance have been dated as far back as the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Heth, Charlotte, "Overview" in ''The Garland Encyclopaedia of World Music'', p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruno Nettl refers to the style of the Great Basin area as the oldest style and common throughout the entire continent before [[Mesoamerica]] but continued in only the Great Basin and in the lullaby, gambling, and tale genres around the continent. A style featuring relaxed vocal technique and the rise may have originated in Mesoamerican Mexico and spread northward, particularly into the California-Yuman and Eastern music areas. According to Nettl, these styles also feature "relative" rhythmic simplicity in drumming and percussion, with isometric material and pentatonic scales in the singing, and motives created from shorter sections into longer ones.&lt;ref name="Nettl56118118"&gt;Nettl, 1956, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

While this process occurred, three Asian styles may have influenced North American music across the Bering Strait, all featuring pulsating vocal technique and possibly evident in recent Paleo-Siberian tribes such as Chuckchee, Yukaghir, Koryak. Also, these may have influenced the Plains-Pueblo, Athabascan, and Inuit-Northwest Coast areas. According to Nettl, the boundary between these southward and the above northward influences are the areas of greatest musical complexity: the Northwest Coast, Pueblo music, and Navajo music. Evidence of influences between the Northwest Coast and Mexico are indicated, for example, by bird-shaped whistles.&lt;ref name="Nettl56118118"/&gt; The Plains-Pueblo area has influenced and continues to influence the surrounding cultures, with contemporary musicians of all tribes learning Plains-Pueblo-influenced pantribal genres such as Peyote songs.&lt;ref name="Nettl56118118"/&gt;

== Music areas ==
{{see also|First Nations music}}
Nettl uses the following music areas which approximately coincide with Wissler, Kroeber, and Driver's [[cultural area]]s: Inuit-Northwest coast, Great Basin, California-Yuman, Plains-Pueblo, Athabascan, and Eastern.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, 1956, p.107-116&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apachefiddler.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Chasi, a [[Warm Springs Apache]] musician playing the Apache fiddle, 1886, photo by A. Frank Randall&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siarchives&amp;uri=full=3100001~!33821~!0#focus "Portrait of Chasi, Bonito's Son..."] ''National Anthropological Archives.'' (retrieved 29 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Native Americans of the [[Southwestern United States]] were limited to [[idiophone]]s and [[aerophone]]s as mediums to sound production beginning date in the seventh century. The applicable idiophones included: plank resonators, [[footed drum]]s, [[percussion stone]]s, [[shaken idiophone]]s, [[vessel rattle]]s, and copper and clay [[bell (instrument)|bells]]. The applicable aerophones included [[bullroarer]]s, decomposable [[whistle]]s and [[flute]]s, clay resonator whistles, [[shell trumpet]]s and prehistoric [[reed instrument]]s. The wood flute was of particular significance. 

Arid [[American Southwest]] is home to two broad groupings of closely related cultures, the [[Pueblo]] and [[Athabaskan]]. The Southern Athabaskan [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] and [[Apache]] tribes sing in Plains-style [[Nasalization|nasal vocals]] with unblended monophony, while the Pueblos emphasize a relaxed, low range and highly blended monophonic style. Athabaskan songs are swift and use drums or [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s, as well as an instrument unique to this area, the [[Apache fiddle]], or "Tsii'edo'a'tl" meaning "wood that sings" in the [[Apache language]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Pueblo songs are complex and meticulously detailed, usually with five sections divided into four or more phrases characterized by detailed introductory and cadential formulas. They are much slower in tempo than Athabaskan songs, and use various [[percussion instrument]]s as accompaniment.
[[File:PiuteGamblingSong.ogg|left|thumb|Piute Game Song intended to accompany the action of the game being played.]]
Nettl describes Pueblo music, including [[Hopi]], [[Zuni people|Zuni]], [[Taos Pueblo]], [[San Ildefonso Pueblo]], [[Santo Domingo Pueblo]], and many others, as one of the most complex on the continent, featuring increased length and number of scale tones ([[hexatonic scale|hexatonic]] and [[heptatonic scale|heptatonic]] common), variety of form, melodic contour, and percussive accompaniment, ranges between an octave and a twelfth, with rhythmic complexity equal to the Plains sub-area. He sites the [[Kachina]] dance songs as the most complex songs and Hopi and Zuni material as the most complex of the Pueblo, while [[Tanoan languages|Tanoan]] and [[Keres language|Keresan]] music is simpler and intermediate between the Plains and western Pueblos. The music of the [[Pima people|Pima]] and [[Tohono O'odham]] is intermediary between the Plains-Pueblo and the California-Yuman music areas, with melodic movement of the Yuman, though including the [[Melodic motion|rise]], and the form and rhythm of the Pueblo.&lt;ref name="Nettl1956112114"&gt;Nettl, 1956, pp. 112–114&lt;/ref&gt;

He describes Southern Athabascan music, that of the Apache and Navajo, as the simplest next to the Great Basin style, featuring [[strophic form]], tense vocals using [[pulse (music)|pulsation]] and [[falsetto]], [[tritonic scale|tritonic]] and [[tetratonic scale|tetratonic]] scales in [[triad (music)|triad]] formation, simple rhythms and values of limited duration (usually only two per song), arc-type melodic contours, and large melodic intervals with a predominance of [[major third|major]] and [[minor third|minor thirds]] and [[perfect fourth|perfect fourths]] and [[perfect fifth|fifths]] with [[octave]] leaps not rare. [[Peyote song]]s share characteristics of Apache music and Plains-Pueblo music having been promoted among the Plains by the Apache people.&lt;ref name="Nettl1956112114"/&gt;

He describes the structural characteristics of California-Yuman music, including that of Pomo, Miwak, Luiseno, Catalineno, and Gabrielino, and the Yuman tribes, including, Mohave, Yuman, Havasupai, Maricopa, as using the rise in almost all songs, a relaxed nonpulsating vocal technique (like European classical music), a relatively large amount of isorhythmic material, some isorhythmic tendencies, simple rhythms, pentatonic scales without semitones, an average melodic range of an octave, [[sequence (music)|sequence]], and [[syncopation|syncopated]] figures such as a sixteenth-note, eight-note, sixteenth-note figure. The form of rise used varies throughout the area, usually being rhythmically related to the preceding non-rise section but differing in melodic material or pitch. The rise may be no higher than the highest pitch of the original section, but will contain a much larger number of higher pitches. In California the non-rise is usually one reiterate phrase, the rise being the phrase transposed an octave higher, the Yumans use a non-rise of long repeated sections each consisting of several phrases, the rise being three to five phrases performed only once, and in southern California the previous two and progressive forms are found.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, 1956, pp.109–110&lt;/ref&gt; A distinctively Californian instrument is the [[clapper stick]], a percussion instrument made by splitting an elderberry branch used to accompany singers and dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keeling |first1=Richard |title=Music and Culture Areas of Native California |journal=Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology |date=1992 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=6-7, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Woodlands===
[[File:Cwy turtleshell rattle.jpg|thumb|360px|Men's turtleshell rattle, made by [[Tommy Wildcat]] ([[Cherokee]]-[[Muscogee (Creek)|Muscogee]]-[[Natchez Nation|Natchez]]]]
Inhabiting a wide swath of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Eastern Woodlands]], according to Nettl, can be distinguished by [[antiphon]]y ([[call and response (music)|call and response]] style singing), which does not occur in other areas. Their territory includes [[Maritime Canada]], [[New England]], [[Mid-Atlantic States|U.S. Mid-Atlantic]], [[Great Lakes (North America)|Great Lakes]] and [[United States Southeast|Southeast]] regions. Songs are rhythmically complex, characterized by frequent metric changes and a close relationship to [[ritual dance]]. Flutes and whistles are solo instruments, and a wide variety of drums, rattles and striking sticks are played. Nettl describes the Eastern music area as the region between the [[Mississippi river]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. The most complex styles are that of the Southeastern Creek, [[Yuchi]], Cherokee, [[Choctaw]], [[Iroquois]] and their language group, with the simpler style being that of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language group including [[Lenape|Delaware]] and [[Penobscot]]. The Algonquian-speaking [[Shawnee]] have a relatively complex style influenced by the nearby southeastern tribes.&lt;ref name="Nettl1956114115"&gt;Nettl, 1956, pp.114–115&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of this entire area include short iterative phrases; reverting relationships; shouts before, during, and after singing [[Anhemitonic scale|anhemitonic pentatonic scales]]; simple rhythms and meter and, according to Nettl, antiphonal or responsorial techniques including "rudimentary imitative [[polyphony]]". Melodic movement tends to be gradually descending throughout the area and vocals include a moderate amount of tension and pulsation.&lt;ref name="Nettl1956114115"/&gt;

===Plains===
&lt;!--[[Plains Indian music]] redirects directly here--&gt;
Extending across the [[American Midwest]] into Canada, [[Great Plains|Plains]]-area music is [[Nasalization|nasal]], with high pitches and frequent [[falsetto]]s, with a [[terraced descent]] (a step-by-step descent down an [[octave]]) in an unblended [[monophony]]. [[Strophe]]s use [[incomplete repetition]], meaning that songs are divided into two parts, the second of which is always repeated before returning to the beginning.

Large double-sided skin drums are characteristic of the Plains tribes, and solo [[end-blown flute]]s (flageolet) are also common.

Nettl describes the central [[Plains Indians]], from Canada to Texas: Blackfoot, Crow, Dakota, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, and Comanche, as the most typical and simple sub-area of the Plains-Pueblo music area. This area's music is characterized by extreme vocal tension, pulsation, melodic preference for perfect fourths and a range averring a tenth, rhythmic complexity, and increased frequency of [[Musical scale|tetratonic scale]]s. The musics of the Arapaho and Cheyenne intensify these characteristics, while the northern tribes, especially [[Blackfoot music]], feature simpler material, smaller melodic ranges, and fewer scale tones.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, 1956, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Nettl [[Arapaho music]] includes ceremonial and secular songs, such as the ritualistic [[Sun Dance]], performed in the summer when the various bands of the Arapaho people would come together. Arapaho traditional songs consist of two sections exhibiting terraced descent, with a range greater than an octave and scales between four and six tones. Other ceremonial songs were received in visions, or taught as part of a man's initiations into a society for his age group. Secular songs include a number of social dances, such as the triple meter [[round dance]]s and songs to inspire warriors or recent exploits. There are also songs said to be taught by a guardian spirit, which should be sung only when the recipient is near death.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, 1965, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Basin===
Music of the [[Great Basin]] is simple, discreet and ornate, characterized by short melodies with a range smaller than an [[octave]], moderately-blended [[monophony]], relaxed and open vocals and, most unusually, paired-phrase structure, in which a melodic [[phrase (music theory)|phrase]], repeated twice, is alternated with one to two additional phrases. A song of this type might be diagrammed as follows: AA BB CC AA BB CC, etc.

Nettl describes the music of the sparsely settled Great Basin, including most of desert Utah and Nevada (Paiute, Ute, Shoshoni) and some of southern Oregon (Modoc and Klamath), as "extremely simple," featuring melodic ranges averaging just over a perfect fifth, many tetratonic scales, and short forms. The majority of songs are iterative with each phrase repeated once, though occasional songs with multiple repetitions are found. Many Modoc and Klamath songs contain only one repeated phrase and many of their scales only two to three notes (ditonic or tritonic). This style was carried to the Great Plains by the [[Ghost Dance religion]] which originated among the Paiute, and very frequently features paired-phrase patterns and a relaxed nonpulsating vocal style. Herzog attributes the similarly simple lullabies, song-stories, and gambling songs found all over the continent historically to the music of the Great Basin which was preserved through relative cultural isolation and low population.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, 1956, p. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northwest Coast===
Open vocals with [[monophony]] are common in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[British Columbia]], though [[polyphony]] also occurs (this is the only area of North America with native polyphony). Chromatic intervals accompanying long melodies are also characteristic, and rhythms are complex and declamatory, deriving from speech. Instrumentation is more diverse than in the rest of North America, and includes a wide variety of whistles, flutes, horns and percussion instruments.

Nettl describes the music of the [[Kwakwaka'wakw]], [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nuu-chah-nulth]], [[Tsimshian]], [[Makah people|Makah]], and Quileute as some of the most complex on the continent, with the music of the Salish nations ([[Nlaka'pamux]], [[Nuxalk Nation|Nuxálk]], and [[Sliammon]], and others directly east of the Northwest tribes) as being intermediary between these Northwest Coast tribes and Inuit music. The music of the Salish tribes, and even more so the Northwest coast, intensifies the significant features of Inuit music, see below, however their melodic movement is often pendulum-type ("leaping in broad intervals from one limit of the range to the other"). The Northwest coast music also "is among the most complicated on the continent, especially in regard to rhythmic structure," featuring intricate rhythmic patterns distinct from but related to the vocal melody and rigid percussion. He also reports unrecorded use of incipient polyphony in the form of drones or parallel intervals in addition to antiphonal and responorial forms. Vocals are extremely tense, producing dynamic contrast, ornamentation, and pulsation, and also often using multiple sudden accents in one held tone.&lt;ref name="Nettl1956108108"&gt;Nettl, 1956, p. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arctic===
[[File:Inupiat drummers at Eskimo dance.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Inupiaq]] drummers in [[Utqiagvik, Alaska]]]]
{{main|Inuit music}}
The [[Inuit]] of [[Alaska]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Yukon Territory]], [[Nunavut]] and [[Greenland]] are well known for their [[Inuit throat singing|throat-singing]], an unusual method of vocalizing found only in a few cultures worldwide. Throat-singing is used as the basis for a game among the Inuit. Narrow-ranged melodies and declamatory effects are common, as in the Northwest. Repeated notes mark the ends of phrases. [[Box drums]], which are found elsewhere, are common, as is a [[tambourine]]-like [[hand drum]]. Nettl describes "Eskimo" music as some of the simplest on the continent, listing characteristics including recitative-like singing, complex rhythmic organization, relatively small melodic range averaging about a sixth, prominence of major thirds and minor seconds melodically, with undulating melodic movement.&lt;ref name="Nettl1956108108"/&gt;

==Academic study==
Archaeological evidence of Native American music dates as far back as the 7th century. However, the earliest written documentation comes from the arrival of European explorers on the American continent, and the earliest academic research comes from the late 19th century. During that period, early musicologists and folklorists collected and studied Native American music, and propounded theories about indigenous styles. In the early 20th century, more systematic research began led by comparative musicologists like [[Frances Densmore]], [[Natalie Curtis]], [[George Herzog (ethnomusicologist)|George Herzog]] and [[Helen Heffron Roberts]]. Densmore was the most prolific of the era, publishing more than one hundred works on Native American music. Most recently, since the 1950s, Native American music has been a part of ethnomusicological research, studied by [[Bruno Nettl]], [[William Powers (ethnomusicologist)|William Powers]] and [[David P. McAllester|David McAllester]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Heth, Charlotte, "Overview" in ''The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music'', pg. 367&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intertribal music==
[[File:Wake singers oglala.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The Wake Singers, band of Oglala Lakota musicians]]
Many music genres span multiple tribes. Pan-tribalism is the syncretic adoption of traditions from foreign communities. Since the rise of the United States and Canada, Native Americans have forged a common identity, and invented pan-Indian music, most famously including [[powwow]]s, [[peyote song]]s, and the [[Ghost Dance]].

The Ghost Dance spread throughout the Plains tribes in the 1890s and many songs are sung today. They are characterized by relaxed vocals and a narrow range. [[Apache Tribe|Apache]]-derived peyote songs, [[prayer]]s in the [[Native American Church]], use a descending melody and monophony. [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|Rattle]]s and [[water drum]]s are used, in a swift tempo. The [[Sun Dance]] and [[Grass Dance]] of the plains are the roots of intertribal powwows, which feature music with [[terraced descent]] and nasal vocals, both Plains characteristic features.

An example of an intertribal song is the [[AIM Song]], which uses meaningless [[vocables]] to make it accessible to people of all tribes. However, because of its origins from the Lakota and Ojibwe people, it still retains some Northern Plains and Great Lakes characteristics.

[[John Trudell]] ([[Santee Dakota]]) launched a new genre of [[spoken word]] poetry in the 1980s, beginning with ''[[Aka Graffiti Man]]'' (1986). The next decade saw further innovations in Native American popular music, including [[Robbie Robertson]] (of [[The Band]]) releasing a [[soundtrack]] for a [[documentary film|documentary]], ''[[Music for the Native Americans]]'', that saw limited mainstream success, as well as [[Verdell Primeaux]] and [[Johnny Mike]]'s modernized [[peyote song]]s, which they began experimenting with on ''[[Sacred Path: Healing Songs of the Native American Church]]''.

Waila (or chicken scratch music of the [[Tohono O'odham]]) has gained performers like the [[Joaquin Brothers]] fame across Native American communities, while [[hip hop music|hip hop]] crews like [[WithOut Rezervation]] and [[Robby Bee &amp; the Boyz From the Rez]] (''[[Reservation of Education]]'') have a distinctively Native American flourish to hip hop. In the 21st century the leading light of contemporary Native American music has been [[Martha Redbone]] whose award winning albums ''[[Home of the Brave (2002)]]'' and ''[[Skintalk (2005)]]'' have incorporated both traditional song and culture references into a brew of soul, funk, rock and jazz that has reached audiences across Europe and Japan as well as into the urban communities of the US. Meanwhile, young Native musicians such as [[Red Earth (band)|Red Earth]] (see [["Zia Soul" (2003)]] ), [[DJ Abel]], [[Derek Miller]], [[Ethnic DeGeneration]], [[War Water]], and [[DJ Casper|Casper]] are producing outstanding underground music (ranging from hip-hop to funk to reggae to metal) defying stereotypes of Native people (without label support).

[[American Indian opera]] is an intertribal music tradition, created when [[Gertrude Bonnin]], a [[Yankton Dakota]] activist collaborated with a classical composer William Hanson to create the opera, ''Sun Dance'' in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kstrom.net/isk/stories/authors/bonnin.html "Gertrude Bonnin, Zitkala Sha, Yankton Nakota."] ''Native Authors.'' (retrieved 12 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cherokee Nation]] [[mezzo-soprano]] opera singer, [[Barbara McAlister (opera singer)|Barbara McAlister]] has performed in many opera troupes and has sung at New York's [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160811134726/http://www.cnec-edu.org/McAlister_Barbara.php "CAiR- Cherokee Artist in Residency: Barbara McAlister."] ''Cherokee Nation Education Corporation.''

===Native American flute===
[[File:Yuchiflute.png|thumb|350px|A traditional [[Yuchi]] flute.&lt;ref&gt;Speck, Frank G. ''Ethnology of the Yuchi Indians.'' Philadelphia: University Museum, 1909. p. 154. Pl. VII.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|Native American flute}}
The Native American flute has achieved some measure of fame for its distinctive sound, used in a variety of [[New-age music|new age]] and [[world music]] recordings. Its music was used in [[courtship]], [[healing]], meditation, and spiritual rituals.

The late 1960s saw a [[roots revival]] centered around the flute, with a new wave of flautists and artisans like [[Doc Tate Nevaquaya]] ([[Comanche]]) and [[Carl Running Deer]]. Notable and award winning Native American flautists include: [[Mary Youngblood]], [[Kevin Locke (musician)|Kevin Locke]], [[Charles Littleleaf]], [[Jay Red Eagle]], [[Robert Tree Cody]], [[Robert Mirabal]], [[Joseph Firecrow]], and [[Jeff Ball (musician)|Jeff Ball]]. [[Tommy Wildcat]] is a contemporary flutist, who makes traditional Cherokee [[river cane]] flutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powersource.com/gallery/wildcat/default.htm Tommy Wildcat.] ''Powersource.'' 1997 (retrieved 28 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Of special importance is [[R. Carlos Nakai]] (''[[Changes (R. Carlos Nakai album)|Changes]]'', 1983), who has achieved Gold record status and mainstream credibility for his mixture of the flute with other contemporary genres.

The Native American flute is the only flute in the world constructed with two air chambers - there is a wall inside the flute between the top (slow) air chamber and the bottom chamber which has the whistle and finger holes. The top chamber also serves as a secondary resonator, which gives the flute its distinctive sound. There is a hole at the bottom of the "slow" air chamber and a (generally) square hole at the top of the playing chamber. A block (or "bird") with a spacer is tied on top of the flute to form a thin, flat airstream for the whistle hole (or "window"). Some more modern flutes use an undercut either in the block or the flute to eliminate the need for a spacer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://Flutopedia.com/anatomy.htm ''Anatomy of the Native American Flute'', Clint Goss]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "traditional" Native American flute was constructed using measurements based on the body - the length of the flute would be the distance from armpit to wrist, the length of the top air chamber would be one fist-width, the distance from the whistle to the first hole also a fist-width, the distance between holes would be one thumb-width, and the distance from the last hole to the end would generally be one fist-width. Unlike Western music, traditional American Indian music had no standard pitch reference such as [[A440 (pitch standard)|A440]], so flutes were not standardized for pitch.

Historic Native American flutes are generally tuned to a variation of the minor pentatonic scale (such as you would get playing the black keys on a piano), which gives the instrument its distinctive plaintive sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flutopedia.com/scale_PentatonicMinor.htm ''NAF Scale: Pentatonic Minor'', Clint Goss]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently some makers have begun experimenting with different scales, giving players new melodic options.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flutopedia.com/scales.htm ''NAF Scales for the Native American Flute'', Clint Goss]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, modern flutes are generally tuned in concert keys (such as A or D) so that they can be easily played with other instruments. The root keys of modern Native American flutes span a range of about three and a half octaves, from C2 to A5.

Native American flutes most commonly have either 5 or 6 holes, but instruments can have anything from no holes to seven (including a thumb hole). Various makers employ different scales and fingerings for their flutes.

Some modern Native American flutes are called "drone" flutes, and are two (or more) flutes built together. Generally, the drone chamber plays a fixed note which the other flute can play against in harmony.

===Drums===
[[File:MIM PHX 2011-04-26 0197 edited.jpg|thumb|Drum and drumsticks at rest]]
Drums are highly influential in American Indian music. Different tribes have different traditions about their drums and how to play them. For larger dance or powwow type drums, the basic construction is very similar in most tribes: a wooden frame or a carved and hollowed-out log, with rawhide buckskin or elk skin stretched out across the opening by sinew thongs. Traditionally American Indian drums are large, two to three feet in diameter, and they are played communally by groups of singers who sit around them in a circle. For smaller single-sided hand drums, a thinner frame or shell is used, and a rawhide surface is strung onto only one side, with lacing across the other. Other types include two basic styles of water drums: the Iroquois type and the Yaqui type. The Iroquois water drum is a small cup-shaped wooden vessel, with water inside it, and a moistened tanned hide stretched across the top opening; the wetness and tightness of the tanned hide produce changes in pitch as the water drum is played over time. The Yaqui type of water drum is actually a half gourd, large in size, that floats in a tub of water like a bubble on the surface; the outer round surface of the gourd is struck with a drum stick, and the vibrations are amplified using the tub of water as a resonator.

Another type of drum called a [[foot drum]] have been found in several southwestern and central-Californian Native American archaeological sites inhabited, or formally inhabited, by the [[Miwok]], [[Maidu]], [[Nahua people|Nahua]], and [[Hopi]] Indian tribes. These drums were often semicircle cross-sectioned hollow logs laid over wood covered 'resonating' pits positioned according to custom in [[kivas]] or dance houses. The foot drums were played by stomping on top of the hollow log with the structure's poles used for steadying.

===Awards===
The dedicated [[Native American Music Awards]], which successfully proposed the Grammy Award for Best Native American Music Album, was launched in 1998 and continues to be held annually. The Native American Music Awards or N.A.M.A. was the first national awards program for Native American music in North America. The awards were born out of a need for greater recognition for Native American music initiatives and remains the largest professional membership based organization in the world.

From 2001 to 2011, the American [[Grammy Awards]] presented an annual award for [[Grammy Award for Best Native American Music Album|Best Native American Music Album]], and the Canadian [[Juno Awards]] present an annual award for [[Juno Award for Aboriginal Recording of the Year|Aboriginal Recording of the Year]]. On April 6, 2011, it was announced that the Grammy Award for Best Native American Music Album would be merged with the [[Grammy Award for Best Hawaiian Music Album|Best Hawaiian Music Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album|Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album]] categories into a new category, [[Best Regional Roots Music Album]]. This change was part of a massive restructuring of Grammy categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement|title=GRAMMY Awards Category Restructuring|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AQXlzopI?url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement|archivedate=2012-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement/explanation-for-category-restructuring|title=Explanation for Category Restructuring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Samples==
*[[Media:Bice'waan Song.ogg]] is a recording from the [[Library of Congress]], collected by Alice Cunningham Fletcher and Francis La Flesche and published in 1897. The singer is George Miller, who was probably born in about 1852. It was described as: "The true love-song, called by the Omaha Bethae waan, an old designation and not a descriptive name, is sung generally in the early morning, when the lover is keeping his tryst and watching for the maiden to emerge from the tent and go to the spring. They belong to the secret courtship and are sometimes called Me-the-g'thun wa-an - courting songs. . . . They were sung without drum, bell or rattle, to accent the rhythm, in which these songs is subordinated to tonality and is felt only in the musical phrases. . . . Vibrations for the purpose of giving greater expression were not only affected by the tremolo of the voice, but they were enhanced by waving the hand, or a spray of artemesia before the lips, while the body often swayed gently to the rhythm of the song (Fletcher, 1894, p.&amp;nbsp;156)."
*[[Media:PiuteGamblingSong.ogg|Download recording]] [[Ghost Dance]] and [[gambling]] song from the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] and [[Arapaho]] Native Americans from the Library of Congress' ''Emile Berliner and the Birth of the Recording Industry Collection''; performed by James Mooney (possibly along with Charles Mooney; neither are believed to be [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]) on July 5, 1894

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7474">'''Information art''' (also '''data art''' or '''informatism''') is an emerging field of [[electronic art]] that synthesizes [[computer science]], [[information technology]], and more classical forms of art, including [[performance art]], [[visual art]], [[new media art]] and [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]] has argued that little scholarship has explored the relationship between technology and [[conceptual art]]. He also claimed that there was an art-historical impetus to artificially distinguish information art from conceptual art. [[Edward A. Shanken]], 'Art in the Information Age: Technology and Conceptual Art,' in [[Michael Corris]] (ed.), Conceptual Art: Theory, Myth and Practice Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Information Art often includes [[interaction]] with [[computer]]s that generate artistic content based on the processing of large amounts of data.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Charlie Gere]] ''Art, Time and Technology: Histories of the Disappearing Body'' (Berg, 2005). {{ISBN|978-1-84520-135-7}} This text concerns artistic and theoretical responses to the increasing speed of technological development and operation, especially in terms of  draws on the ideas of [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], and looks at the work of [[Samuel Morse]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Kasimir Malevich]], among others.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[Image:Info1970.jpg|thumb|150px|Kynaston McShine's "Information"]]
Informatism follows on the 1970 exhibition organized by [[Kynaston McShine]] called  "Information", held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City - a show  that formally established [[conceptual art]] as a leading tendency in the United States. Conceptual art had emerged simultaneously in dozens of international locations around 1966.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lucy R. Lippard]], ''Six Years: the Dematerialization of the Art Object From 1966 to 1972'' (1973. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time arose the activities of [[Experiments in Art and Technology]] known as E.A.T.&lt;ref&gt;E.A.T. followed from the event Nine Evenings: Theatre and Engineering, organised by [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Billy Klüver]] at the Armoury Building, New York City, 13–22 October 1966 to promote the collaboration between artists and engineers. They also organised the Pepsi Pavilion at the World's Fair, [[Osaka]], in 1970. For a detailed discussion of the project see Bijvoet, Art as Inquiry, ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic practice ==
Information art [[data]] can be manifested using [[photograph]]s, [[census]] data, micropayments, personal profiles and expressions, [[video]] clips, [[search engine]] results, [[digital painting]], network signals, and [[prose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McKeough, Tim|title=Frame That Spam!

{{Intellectual property}}
Layout designs (topographies) of [[integrated circuit]]s are a field in the protection of [[intellectual property]].

In [[United States]] intellectual property law, a "mask work" is a two or three-dimensional layout or topography of an [[integrated circuit]] (IC or "chip"), i.e. the arrangement on a chip of [[semiconductor devices]] such as [[transistor]]s and passive [[electronics|electronic]] components such as [[resistor]]s and interconnections. The layout is called a ''mask'' work because, in [[photolithography|photolithographic]] processes, the multiple etched layers within actual ICs are each created using a mask, called the [[photomask]], to permit or block the light at specific locations, sometimes for hundreds of chips on a [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] simultaneously.

Because of the functional nature of the mask geometry, the designs cannot be effectively protected under [[copyright]] law (except perhaps as decorative art). Similarly, because individual lithographic mask works are not clearly protectable subject matter, they also cannot be effectively protected under [[patent]] law, although any processes implemented in the work may be patentable. So since the 1990s, national governments have been granting copyright-like exclusive rights conferring time-limited exclusivity to reproduction of a particular layout. Term of integrated circuit rights are usually shorter than copyrights applicable on pictures.

== International law ==

A diplomatic conference was held at [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1989, which adopted a [[Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits]], also called the Washington Treaty or IPIC Treaty. The Treaty, signed at Washington on May 26, 1989, is open to States Members of [[WIPO]] or the [[United Nations]] and to intergovernmental organizations meeting certain criteria. The Treaty has been incorporated by reference into the [[TRIPS Agreement]] of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), subject to the following modifications: the term of protection is at least 10 (rather than eight) years from the date of filing an application or of the first commercial exploitation in the world, but Members may provide a term of protection of 15 years from the creation of the layout-design; the exclusive right of the right-holder extends also to articles incorporating integrated circuits in which a protected layout-design is incorporated, in so far as it continues to contain an unlawfully reproduced layout-design; the circumstances in which layout-designs may be used without the consent of right-holders are more restricted; certain acts engaged in unknowingly will not constitute infringement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.int/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm#6 TRIPS Articles]&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPIC Treaty is currently not in force, but was partially integrated into the TRIPS agreement.

Article 35 of TRIPS in Relation to the IPIC Treaty states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Members agree to provide protection to the layout-designs (topographies) of integrated circuits (referred to in this Agreement as "layout-designs") in accordance with Articles 2 through 7 (other than paragraph 3 of Article 6), Article 12 and paragraph 3 of Article 16 of the Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits and, in addition, to comply with the following provisions.[http://www.wto.int/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm#6 TRIPS Document]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 2 of the IPIC Treaty gives the following definitions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(i) 'integrated circuit' means a product, in its final form or an intermediate form, in which the elements, at least one of which is an active element, and some or all of the inter-connections are integrally formed in and/or on a piece of material and which is intended to perform an electronic function,

(ii) 'layout-design (topography)' means the three-dimensional disposition, however expressed, of the elements, at least one of which is an active element, and of some or all of the interconnections of an integrated circuit, or such a three-dimensional disposition prepared for an integrated circuit intended for manufacture ...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under the IPIC Treaty, each Contracting Party is obliged to secure, throughout its territory, exclusive rights in layout-designs (topographies) of integrated circuits, whether or not the integrated circuit concerned is incorporated in an article. Such obligation applies to layout-designs that are original in the sense that they are the result of their creators' own intellectual effort and are not commonplace among creators of layout designs and manufacturers of integrated circuits at the time of their creation.

The Contracting Parties must, as a minimum, consider the following acts to be unlawful if performed without the authorization of the holder of the right: the reproduction of the lay-out design, and the importation, sale or other distribution for commercial purposes of the layout-design or an integrated circuit in which the layout-design is incorporated. However, certain acts may be freely performed for private purposes or for the sole purpose of evaluation, analysis, research or teaching.

== National laws ==

=== United States ===

The United States Code (USC) defines a mask work as "a series of related images, however fixed or encoded, having or representing the predetermined, three-dimensional pattern of metallic, insulating, or semiconductor material present or removed from the layers of a semiconductor chip product, and in which the relation of the images to one another is such that each image has the pattern of the surface of one form of the semiconductor chip product" [(17 U.S.C. § 901(a)(2))]. Mask work exclusive rights were first granted in the US by the [[Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984]].

According to {{UnitedStatesCode|17|904}}, rights in semiconductor mask works last 10 years. This contrasts with a [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act|term of 95 years]] for modern copyrighted works with a corporate authorship; alleged infringement of mask work rights are also not protected by a statutory [[fair use]] defense, nor by the typical [[backup]] copy exemptions that {{UnitedStatesCode|17|117}} provides for [[computer software]]. Nevertheless, as fair use in copyrighted works was originally recognized by the judiciary over a century before being codified in the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], it is possible that the courts might likewise find a similar defense applies to mask work.

The non-obligatory symbol used in a mask work protection notice is Ⓜ ([[M]] enclosed in a circle; [[Unicode]] code point &lt;code&gt;U+24C2&lt;/code&gt; or [[Unicode and HTML|HTML numeric character entity]] &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#9410;&lt;/code&gt;) or *M*.

The exclusive rights in a mask work are somewhat like those of [[copyright]]: the right to reproduce the mask work or (initially) distribute an IC made using the mask work. Like the [[first sale doctrine]], a lawful owner of an authorized IC containing a mask work may freely import, distribute or use, but not reproduce the chip (or the mask). Mask work protection is characterized as a ''[[sui generis]]'' right, i.e., one created to protect specific rights where other (more general) laws were inadequate or inappropriate.

Note that the exclusive rights granted to mask work owners are more limited than those granted to copyright or patent holders. For instance, modification (derivative works) is not an exclusive right of mask work owners. Similarly, the exclusive right of a patentee to "use" an invention would not prohibit an independently created mask work of identical geometry. Furthermore, reproduction for [[reverse engineering]] of a mask work is specifically permitted by the law. As with copyright, mask work rights exist when they are created, regardless of registration, unlike patents, which only confer rights after application, examination and issuance.

Mask work rights have more in common with copyrights than with other [[exclusive right]]s such as [[patent]]s or [[trademark]]s. On the other hand, they are used alongside copyright to protect a [[read-only memory]] (ROM) component that is encoded to contain computer software.

The publisher of software for a cartridge-based [[video game console]] may seek simultaneous protection of its property under several legal constructs:

* A trademark registration on the game's title and possibly other marks such as fanciful names of worlds and characters used in the game (e.g., PAC-MAN®);
* A copyright registration on the program as a literary work or on the audiovisual displays generated by the work; and
* A mask work registration on the ROM that contains the binary.

Ordinary copyright law applies to the underlying software (source, binary) and original characters and art.
But the expiration date for the term of ''additional'' exclusive rights in a work distributed in the form of a mask ROM would depend on an {{as of|2010|alt=as yet}} untested interpretation of the originality requirement of § 902(b):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(b) Protection under this chapter (i.e., as a mask work) shall not be available for a mask work that—
:(1) is not original; or
:(2) consists of designs that are staple, commonplace, or familiar in the semiconductor industry, or variations of such designs, combined in a way that, considered as a whole, is not original
({{UnitedStatesCode|17|902}}, {{As of|2010|11|lc=y}}).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under one interpretation, a mask work containing a given game title is either entirely unoriginal, as mask ROM in general is likely a familiar design, or a minor variation of the mask work for any of the [[launch title|first titles released for the console]] in the region.

=== Other countries ===

Equivalent legislation exists in [[Australia]], [[India]] and [[Hong Kong]].

Australian law refers to mask works as "eligible layouts" or ELs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|584|1992|litigants=Re Centronics Systems Pty Ltd; Maurice Latin; Tiberio Salice and Fabrizio Latin v Nintendo Company Ltd |parallelcite=(1992) 39 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 147 |date=1 December 1992 |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court (Full Court)]] |juris=Australia}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]] these rights are protected under the [Integrated Circuit Topography Act (1990, c. 37)].

In the [[European Union]], a ''sui generis'' design right protecting the design of materials was introduced by the [[Directive 87/54/EEC]] which is transposed in all member states.

[[India]] has the Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Layout Design Act, 2000 for the similar protection.

[[Japan]] relies on "The Act Concerning the Circuit Layout of a Semiconductor Integrated Circuit".

[[Brazil]] has enacted Law No. 11484, of 2007, to regulate the protection and registration of integrated circuit topography.

The '''International Sculpture Symposium''' movement was spearheaded by [[Karl Prantl (sculptor)|Karl Prantl]] in [[Austria]] in 1959.
This initiative grew from the need to facilitate communication and exchange between members of the international sculpture community. It was also rooted in [[Cold War]] tensions, which lent a particular urgency to the need for cross-cultural dialogue on a person-to-person basis.
The first international sculpture symposium took place in an abandoned stone quarry in [[Sankt Margarethen im Burgenland]]. 

Sculptors from around the world joined together to produce a permanent public artwork from local stone, a dynamic which would provide the model for many symposia to follow. 

Since then international sculpture symposia have been held in numerous towns and cities around the world, including [[Lindabrunn, Austria]] and [[Hagi, Yamaguchi|Hagi]], [[Japan]] (a town known for its [[Japanese pottery|pottery]]). The first international sculpture symposia in the United States (and the first on a college campus) was in 1965 on the [[California State University, Long Beach]] campus in [[Long Beach, California]].

The first International Sculpture Symposium ([[Vermont International Sculpture Symposium]]) in the United States was held in [[Proctor]], [[Vermont]] in 1986 under the joint sponsorship of Vermont Marble Company, [[National Endowment for the Arts]], and Vermont Council on the Arts. Participating sculptors were from the United States, Austria, Japan, Germany, and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="Vermont symposium-NCA"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Sculptors Symposium|url=http://www.ncmodernist.org/NCARCHITECT/1968-10.pdf|website=North Carolina Architect|publisher=The North Carolina chapter of the American Institute of Architects|accessdate=5 August 2018|pages=17–18|date=October 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first Sculpture Symposium in Australia was held at Wondabyne near Gosford in New South Wales in 1986. 
It was followed by the Barossa International Sculpture Symposium in Mengler Hill near Tanunda in the Barossa in South Australia in 1988. Nine sculptures in Marble and Granite were carved by sculptors from France, the United States, Japan and Australia. The site is now the Barossa Sculpture Park.

As part of the program in 2001, the [[Republic of South Africa]] War Memorial ''Reconciliation'' by sculptor [[Strijdom van der Merwe]] was created for the sculpture park at the [[United Nations Memorial Cemetery]] in [[Busan, South Korea]].&lt;ref name="southafrica-embassy"&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Sculpture Park|url=http://southafrica-embassy.or.kr/eng/sankorea/korean_war(UNMCK).php|work=UNMCK|publisher=Republic of South Africa Embassy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jewish [[folklore]]''' are [[legend]]s, [[music]], [[oral history]], [[proverb]]s, [[joke]]s, [[popular belief]]s, [[fairy tales]], [[narrative|stories]], [[tall tales]], and [[Folkways (sociology)|customs]] that are the [[tradition]]s of Judaism. [[Folklore|Folktales]] are characterized by the presence of unusual personages, by the sudden transformation of men into beasts and vice versa, or by other unnatural incidents. A number of [[Aggadah|haggadic stories]] bear folktale characteristics, especially those relating to [[Og]], King of Bashan, which have the same exaggerations as have the ''lügenmärchen'' of modern German folktales.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dennis, "Og," ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Myth, Magic, and Mysticism''&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Middle Ages==
There is considerable evidence of Jewish people bringing and helping the spread of Eastern folktales in Europe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Joseph Jacobs, "Folk-Tales", ''Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; Besides these tales from foreign sources, Jews either collected or composed others which were told throughout the European [[ghetto]]s, and were collected in Yiddish in the "Maasebücher".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Numbers of the folktales contained in these collections were also published separately.&lt;ref&gt;See the earlier ones given by Moritz Steinschneider in ''Hebrew Books in the Bodleian Library, Oxford (Catalogus Librorum Hebræorum in Bibliotheca Bodleiana)'', Berlin, 1852-60)'', Nos. 3869-3942&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, difficult to call many of them folktales in the sense given above, since nothing fairy-like or supernormal occurs in them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Legends==
[[File:Golem and Loew.jpg|thumb|''[[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Rabi Loew]] and [[Golem]]'' by [[Mikolas Ales]] (1899).]]

There are a few definitely Jewish legends of the Middle Ages which partake of the character of folktales, such as those of [[Jewish pope Andreas|the Jewish pope Andreas]] and of the [[golem]], or that relating to the wall of the Rashi chapel, which moved backward in order to save the life of a poor woman who was in danger of being crushed by a passing carriage in the narrow way. Several of these legends were collected by {{Interlanguage link multi|Abraham Moses Tendlau|de|3=Abraham Tendlau}} (''Sagen und Legenden der Jüdischen Vorzeit'').&lt;ref&gt;Frankfurt a.M.: Kauffman, 1873&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century many folk-tales were gathered among Jews or published from Hebrew manuscripts by {{Interlanguage link multi|Israël Lévi|fr}} in the ''Revue des Etudes Juives'', in the ''Revue des Traditions Populaires'', and in ''Melusine''; by [[Moses Gaster]] in ''Folk-Lore'' and in the reports of [[Montefiore College]]; and by [[Max Grunwald]] in ''Mitteilungen der Gesellschaft für Jüdische Volkskunde'';&lt;ref&gt;see Index to part vi., s.v. "Erzählungen"&lt;/ref&gt; by [[L. Wiener]] in the same periodical; and by [[Friedrich Salomon Krauss|F. S. Krauss]] in ''Urquell'', both series.

==Aggadah and folklore compilations==
* ''[[Legends of the Jews|The Legends of the Jews]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/default.htm |title=The Legends of the Jews by Louis Ginzberg |publisher=Philologos.org |date=2001-04-13 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Rabbi [[Louis Ginzberg]], is an original synthesis of a vast amount of aggadah from the [[Mishnah]], the two Talmuds and [[Midrash]]. Ginzberg had an encyclopedic knowledge of all rabbinic literature, and his masterwork included a massive array of aggadot. However he did not create an anthology which showed these aggadot distinctly.  Rather, he paraphrased them and rewrote them into one continuous narrative that covered five volumes, followed by two volumes of footnotes that give specific sources.
*The ''[[Ein Yaakov]]'' is a compilation of the aggadic material in the Babylonian Talmud together with commentary.
*''Sefer Ha-Aggadah'', "The Book of Legends" is a classic compilation of aggadah from the Mishnah, the two Talmuds and the Midrash literature. It was edited by [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]] and [[Yehoshua Hana Ravnitzky]]. Bialik and Ravnitzky worked to compile a comprehensive and representative overview of aggadah; they spent three years compiling their work. When they found the same aggadah in multiple versions, from multiple sources, they usually selected the later form, the one found in the Babylonian Talmud. However they also presented a great some aggadot sequentially, giving the early form from the Jerusalem Talmud, and later versions from the Babylonian Talmud, and from a classic midrash compilation. In each case each every aggadah is given with its original source. In their original edition, they translated the Aramaic aggadot into modern Hebrew. Sefer Ha-Aggadah was first published in 1908-11 in [[Odessa]], Russia, then reprinted numerous times in [[Israel]]. In 1992 it was translated into English as "The Book of Legends", by William G, Braude.
* ''Mimekor Yisrael'', by [[Micha Josef Berdyczewski|Micha Josef (bin Gorion) Berdyczewski]]. Berdyczewski was interested in compiling the folklore and legends of the Jewish people, from the earliest times up until the dawn of the modern era. His collection included a large array of aggadot, although they were limited to those he considered within the domain of folklore.

'''Kopel Gurwin''' ({{lang-he|קופל גורבין}}) (1923–1990) was an [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[wall hanging]] artist, painter and graphic artist.

==Family and youth==
Kopel (Kopke') Gurwin (Gurwitz) was born and raised in [[Vilna]], the capital of [[Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;Shosh Moran, Yedioth Ahronoth Weekly "Netanya Hadera", Issue No. 400, June 1988, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; His father Mordechai worked as a shoemaker and his mother Malka as a housekeeper. Kopel and his siblings, Moshe (Meshke') who was two and a half years his elder, and Chava (Chavale’) who was four years younger, spoke [[Yiddish]] at home, but simultaneously studied Hebrew at their school which was part of the [[Tarbut]] educational network. 
&lt;ref&gt;Art Exhibition at Aaron", American Jewish World, Minneapolis Minn, May 28, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kopel was active in the [[Hashomer Hatzair]] youth movement. In the 1930s, as a teenager, Kopel helped his parents with the home finances by working in a suit workshop, there he first encountered the art of sewing.
&lt;ref&gt;"Foundation Sponsors Works by Kopel Gurwin", [[Jewish Standard]], N.J., June 11, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] and the German invasion of Vilna, the Jews were imprisoned in camps and [[ghetto]]s. Kopel and his brother Moshe were separated from their parents and were put to work in [[Coal mining|coal mines]] and [[peat]]. Kopel's parents were taken to the [[Stutthof concentration camp]] where they died of [[typhus]] within a month of each other. Kopel's 12-year-old sister Chava was turned over to the Germans by a Polish family and murdered.

The brothers were arrested by the Germans, but were saved thanks to the connections of Nina Gerstein, Kopel's drama teacher. They hid in an attic until they were discovered, fled and moved to [[Riga]], where they were caught and sent to the Stutthof concentration camp where they were imprisoned until the end of the war. They were put to work maintaining and cleaning trains and took part in one of the [[death marches]].

In July 1946, Kopel and Moshe sailed to [[Helsingborg]], Sweden, as part of operation "[[Folke Bernadotte]]", in which Sweden took in ill survivors for rehabilitation. Once he recovered, Kopel worked in a publishing house and later was appointed director of the local branch of the [[HeHalutz|Halutz]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ohad, "The Eyes of Saul, David's Pedigree and Jacob's Ladder", [[Haaretz]], 22 September 1967, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An interview with Kopel Gurwin, "Kopel captures the spirit of life", Outlook Women's League, vol. 59. No. 2, winter 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 Kopel and Moshe made [[aliyah]] to Israel. Kopel worked as a survey for the Survey of Israel Company. In 1951, he enlisted to the Communication Corps and served as a military [[Technical drawing|draftsman]]. There he won first prize for the design of the front cover of the Communication Corps bulletin.&lt;ref&gt;Kopel Gurwin: The artist and his creation 1990-1923, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning of artistic career==
With his discharge from the army at 29 he started studying drawing and graphics at the [[Bezalel]] Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem. Among his teachers were [[Isidor Ascheim]], Shlomo Vitkin, Yossi Stern and [[Jacob Steinhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;Shosh Moran, [[Yedioth Ahronoth]] Weekly "Netanya Hadera", Issue No. 400, June 1988, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ohad, "The Eyes of Saul, David's Pedigree and Jacob's Ladder", Haaretz, 22 September 1967, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of his first year of study, Kopel won the Reuben and Sarah Lif Excellence Award in written studies. During his studies he also won additional prizes: In 1956 he won first prize from the Lethem Foundation in California for poster design. Later the same year, Kopel won the Herman Shtruk prize for his drawing on the theme of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;"Coffee Colored", [[Ma'ariv]], 27 January 1960, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shosh Moran, Yedioth Ahronoth Weekly "Netanya Hadera", Issue No. 400, June 1988, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ohad, "The Eyes of Saul, David's Pedigree and Jacob's Ladder", Haaretz, 22 September 1967, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 he won an additional first prize from the Lethem Foundation and second place from the printing company Ortzel for a drawing for a [[Rosh Hashanah|Jewish New Year]] [[greeting card]]. In 1958 he won first prize in a competition to design a poster for Tel Aviv's jubilee.&lt;ref&gt;"Coffee Colored", Ma'ariv, 27 January 1960, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ohad, "The Eyes of Saul, David's Pedigree and Jacob's Ladder", Haaretz, 22 September 1967, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later he won three other awards: First and third prize for designing a poster for Israel Independence Day, celebrating 12 years of the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;"Two won the Independence Day poster competition", [[Davar]], 26 January 1960, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Three graphic artists won prizes totaling 2100 Israeli Pounds for Independence Day posters", [[Herut (newspaper)|Herut]], 1 February 1960, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Individuals and Institutions", Ma'ariv, 26 January 1960, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Coffee Colored", Ma'ariv, 27 January 1960, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also that year Kopel won first prize for a poster to mark the 25th [[World Zionist Congress|Zionist Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ohad, "The Eyes of Saul, David's Pedigree and Jacob's Ladder", Haaretz, 22 September 1967, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 he entered the [[Independence Day (Israel)|Independence Day]] poster competition on the theme of [[aliyah]] and won first and second prize. 
&lt;ref&gt;"A menorah under a ship and rising figures – an Independence Day poster", Davar, 30 January 1964, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"An Independence Day poster was chosen", Ma'ariv, 30 January 1964, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davar, 31 January 1964, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Independence Day poster prize", Haaretz, 30 January 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ohad, "The Eyes of Saul, David's Pedigree and Jacob's Ladder", Haaretz, 22 September 1967, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
Four years later he again entered the competition on the theme of 20 years of Israel's independence and won first prize. The poster was styled like a Holy Ark curtain with two lions and a menorah at its centre. This poster appeared on the cover of Jewish Art and Civilization, edited by Geoffrey Wigoder,&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Vigoder (ed.), Jewish art and civilization, Walker and company, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Frankenstein, Jewish art… and a freak show", S.F. Sunday Examiner &amp; Chronicle, December 10, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nissim Mevorah, "Carpets in Flames", Haaretz, 15 August 1975, p. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the record Voices of 20 Years, 1948-1968, edited by Yossi Godard. In April 1971 he won first prize in the Independence Day poster competition for the fourth time.&lt;ref&gt;"Prizes for excellence in the Ministry of Communications", Ma'ariv, 12 February 1971, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Baruch]], "A Poster for Every Occasion", Haaretz, 9 April 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wall hangings==
[[File:Kopel_Tapestry_of_Jerusalem_1968.jpg|right|160px|thumb|Kopel's tapestry that won the Israeli Independence Day Poster Contest in 1968]]
With the completion of his studies at [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design|Bezalel]] Kopel moved to Tel Aviv and was hired by Shmuel Grundman's graphics and design studio. Grundman took him to Europe with him to design and supervise the construction of Israeli exhibition pavilions.&lt;ref&gt;Shosh Moran, Yedioth Ahronoth Weekly "Netanya Hadera", Issue No. 400, June 1988, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at Grundman's he discovered the fibrous felt from which he produced most of his wall hangings.&lt;ref&gt;Shosh Moran, Yedioth Ahronoth Weekly "Netanya Hadera", Issue No. 400, June 1988, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1964 [[Levant Fair]] exhibition he used felt stuck onto wooden panels for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ohad, "The Eyes of Saul, David's Pedigree and Jacob's Ladder", Haaretz, 22 September 1967, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first felt wall hanging that Kopel produced was intended for the American Cultural Centre in Jerusalem and its theme was the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. The wall hanging, which measured 2.85 X 1.85 meters, was stuck on a wooden panel. Kopel ordered rolls of felt from France and began work on wall hangings based on bible stories. He used a needle, hand sewing small even stitches with black embroidery thread which framed and highlighted every detail in the work, as well as using [[appliqué]]. Each wall hanging was constructed of three elements: the main motif/ story, the decoration (ornamentation) and the Hebrew text which usually framed the work. The lettering was designed in a square font contrary to the accepted biblical [[calligraphy]].&lt;ref&gt;Pnina Silberstein, "Color, Marble and Felt Cuttings", Our Country, Issue 2, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An interview with Kopel Gurwin, "Kopel captures the spirit of life", Outlook Women's League, vol. 59. No. 2, winter 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ohad, "The Eyes of Saul, David's Pedigree and Jacob's Ladder", Haaretz, 22 September 1967, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The interior designer, Alufa Koljer-Elem, introduced him to [[Ruth Dayan]] who managed the shop Maskit and initiated the establishment of the Maskit 6 gallery. On the 10th September 1967 he opened his first solo exhibition at the Maskit 6 gallery, in which 12 wall hangings were displayed.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ohad, "The Eyes of Saul, David's Pedigree and Jacob's Ladder", Haaretz, 22 September 1967, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shosh Moran, Yedioth Ahronoth Weekly "Netanya Hadera", Issue No. 400, June 1988, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art Exhibition at Aaron", American Jewish World, Minneapolis Minn, May 28, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An interview with Kopel Gurwin, "Kopel captures the spirit of life", Outlook Women's League, vol. 59.

In light of the exhibition at Maskit 6, Meira Gera, the director of artistic activity at the [[America-Israel Cultural Foundation]], organized an additional exhibition of his works at the foundation's exhibition hall in [[New York City]]. The exhibition sparked immense press interest,&lt;ref&gt;"Gurwin works to be shown", American examiner, June 10, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art Exhibition at Aaron", American Jewish World, Minneapolis Minn, May 28, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Kopel Gurwin art will be displayed soon", Jewish transcript, June 17, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American examiner, June 24, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Survivor's art on display", Jews New, June 11, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Foundation shows works by artist Kopel Gurwin", Jews Chronicle, June 11, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;
and was also displayed for a few months at the [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|New York Jewish Museum]], from where it travelled throughout the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Louisa Kreisberg, "'Musing' in Manhattan: see kites and banners flies", The Daily Item, Port Chester N.Y., June 24, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ann Robison, "On the go", Jewish Standard N.J., June 18, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Sanctuary exhibit", The Minneapolis Star.

Vernon N.Y., June 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the exhibition at the Delson-Richter gallery in Old Jaffa,&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Ben-Shaul, "Carpets of Beauty", Ma'ariv, 21 August 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Decorative Wall Hangings", Davar, 29 August 1975, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delson-Richter Gallery, Evening Evening, 10 August 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; which was later also exhibited at the Jerusalem Theatre,&lt;ref&gt;"Kopel Gurwin at the Jerusalem Theatre", Yedioth Ahronoth, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miriam Tal, "Kopel Gurwin at the Jerusalem Theatre, Yedioth Ahronoth, 17 October 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art Exhibition at Aaron", American Jewish World, Minneapolis Minn, May 28, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; the journalist Nissim Mevorah wrote:
:"The black color connecting the felt to the upholstery fabric (through hand stitching) highlights the contours. The aforementioned process repeats itself several times since every [[tapestry]] is composed of at least three layers. Color attracts color, until the completion of the work. Thanks to this technique, his work goes beyond purely technical art and borders on artistic action. The colorfulness inherent in the felt is luscious and rich. This is the reason Gurwin selected this material for his works. He has a highly developed sense of color and thanks to this his works look as though they are being engulfed by red and blue flames. The [[biblical]] characters filling Gurwin's wall hangings are inspired by the [[Jewish art]]istic [[folklore]] of Eastern Europe. Around the biblical verse which adorns the characters like a crown, appear oriental decorative motifs based on the rhythm of repetitive forms. By contrast, even contemporary graphic styles, among them the works of great artists such as [[Paul Klee]], are among the influences on these wall hangings. At times of heavenly mercy Gurwin prepared works based on psalms of thanksgiving. His romantic moods resulted in tapestries dedicated to the Song of Songs."&lt;ref&gt;Nissim Mevorah, "Carpets in Flames", Haaretz, 15 August 1975, p. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 Kopel was approached by the women of the Beth Shalom Congregation (Sisterhood) in [[Kansas City]], USA, with a request to design a wall hanging 5.40 X 2.70 meters in size. The intention was for a tapestry that the community women could be involved in its production. Kopel designed the work in all its detail and sent precise execution instructions for the wall hanging which was designed as a tapestry around the theme of the [[Garden of Eden]]. Following approval of the sketch, Kopel received 50 pieces of special canvas for tapestry embroidery, as well as a catalogue of wool thread with 200 shades. He connected the pieces into a large tapestry, enlarged his sketch and prepared precise instructions for each embroiderer. He then dismantled the tapestry into pieces and sent the pieces of fabric to the women congregants. 70 women took part in sewing the tapestry and completed together 2 million stitches over two years. 
&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Fredman, Israeli artist Kopel Gurwin is known for creative tapestry", St. Louis Jewish Light, May 6, 1981, p, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shosh Moran, Yedioth Ahronoth Weekly "Netanya Hadera", Issue No. 400, June 1988, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jaekel Miller, The Kansas City star, "Needlepoint Tapestry a Co-operative Project", Section c, People, January 30, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article about the project, Barbara Jaekel Miller, previously editor at [[The Times]], wrote:
:"Kopel's genius is in his colors. To think that the huge tapestry was designed from a catalogue of wool threads without the artist being able to see the stages of construction. The final product is perfect, almost unimaginable." &lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jaekel Miller, The Kansas City star, "Needlepoint Tapestry a Co-operative Project", Section c, People, January 30, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional appliqué, 4.0 X 2.0 meters in size, hangs in the Church of the Good Samaritan in Miami. The subject of the tapestry was the seven days of creation. All the days of creation were written in English apart from the seventh day which Kopel ended with the word "Halleluiah" in Hebrew.

Kopel's tapestry "The Time for Singing has Arrived" was printed on a [[UNICEF]] greeting card in 1978 and again in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Fredman, Israeli artist Kopel Gurwin is known for creative tapestry", St. Louis Jewish Light, May 6, 1981, p, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 the company Kol Ha’Tor LTD, whose main goal was to deal with manufacture, marketing and sale of "artistic works from fabric", was established. 
 
The Israeli [[Philatelic]] Service issued three stamps based on three of Kopel's holy arc curtains and one stamp based on an [[Independence Day (Israel)|Independence Day]] poster he designed.

Kopel's creations decorate a large number of synagogues, public buildings, hotels and private collections which were purchased in Israel and around the world. They have decorated, among others, the walls of the [[King David Hotel]] in Jerusalem, the [[VIP]] room at [[Ben Gurion Airport]], the Kfar Saba theatre and the Plaza Hotel in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref&gt;Shosh Moran, Yedioth Ahronoth Weekly "Netanya Hadera", Issue No. 400, June 1988, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
At the end of the 1960s Kopel met Hannah Brooks, who worked in [[textile]] design for industry and wove artistic cloths for [[fashion designers]]. The two participated in artistic projects for hotels and public buildings. In September 1974 they wed. in 1980 they moved to [[Beit Yanai]].

Kopel Gurwin passed away at the age of 67 as a result of [[heart disease]]. He was survived by his wife, Hannah and their two children, Boaz and Shira.&lt;ref&gt;Kopel Gurwin: The artist and his creation 1990-1923, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois''' -- also known as '''Landmarks Illinois''' -- is a [[not-for-profit organization]] founded in 1971 to prevent the demolition of the [[Dankmar Adler]] and [[Louis Sullivan]] designed [[Chicago Stock Exchange#History|Chicago Stock Exchange Building]].  Although this effort failed the organization has grown to become a 2000-member statewide voice for historic preservation.

The founding mission was "to stop the demolition of significant buildings in downtown Chicago."  The LPCI has broadened its scope and geography "to embrace architecturally and historically significant archeological sites, structures, and historic districts in all the cities, towns and rural areas of Illinois."  Today LPCI holds conservation easements on 341 properties.  Among the historic buildings they have saved are the [[Marquette Building (Chicago)|Marquette Building]] and the [[Reliance Building]].

Landmarks Illinois was involved in a highly publicized preservation effort to save Mies van der Rohe's [[Farnsworth House (Plano, Illinois)|Farnsworth House]] from being dismantled and relocated from its original site along the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]].  Modern architecture enthusiasts from around the globe answered the call to donate funds, and the house was purchased at auction from Sotheby's on December 12, 2003.  A rare example of freestanding single family design by van der Rohe, the house is now operated by Landmarks Illinois and open to the public for tours.

In addition to preserving buildings, Landmarks Illinois has since 2007 also held an annual gala to acknowledge "Legendary Landmarks", described as "citizens who have made contributions to the civic and cultural life of Chicago and Illinois."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Cultural stalwarts gain legendary status | work = Chicago Sun Times | date = March 7, 2007 | last = Lenoir | first = Lisa | page = 49 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origin===
German immigrant Walter Landor and his wife Josephine (the original "associate") founded the company in 1941.&lt;ref name=Ken&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Ken and Rick Clogher|title=The Ultimate Image Maker|newspaper=San Francisco Focus|date=August 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Landor intended to "...concentrate on designing everyday products that would make life more pleasant and more beautiful."&lt;ref name=Ken /&gt;

Some of Landor's earliest designs were beer company logos that earned awards from the Brewers Association of America and the Small Brewers Association.&lt;ref name=Pioneer&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallagher|first=Bernie|title=Walter Landor: Portrait of a Pioneer|url=http://landor.com/#!/about/history/walter-landor|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Arrowhead, Landor created a tilt bottle with two flat sides that could be poured without being lifted from the table.&lt;ref name="WL bio" /&gt; This unique design won several awards, drew media attention, and brought additional business to the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=So What's New about Water|journal=Good Packaging|date=n.d.|series=Landor Archive Project, Landor Design Collection, Archives Center, National Museum of American History}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also selected by the U.S. Department of Commerce to appear in three International Trade Fairs.&lt;ref name="WL bio" /&gt;

Walter Landor favored what he felt was a client-driven approach. He was one of the first to apply consumer research to package design, and relied heavily on observing consumers in real-life situations—even soliciting in-store feedback from shoppers regarding label design.&lt;ref name=Founder&gt;{{cite web|last=Malherek|first=Joseph|title=Walter Landor: Graphic designer and founder of an influential corporate image consultancy|url=http://www.transatlanticperspectives.org/entry.php?rec=125|publisher=German Historical Institute|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Walter Landor's philosophy, "The package itself must do the talking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Unknown|title=Packages Must Speak for Themselves|newspaper=San Francisco News-Call Bulletin|date=23 November 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Landor's reputation grew, the company's client list expanded to encompass airlines, financial institutions, government agencies, hospitality services, and technology firms.&lt;ref name="Founder"/&gt; Over time, Landor broadened its consulting services to offer corporate and product naming, brand positioning and architecture, retail environment design, copywriting, internal brand engagement, digital branding, and BrandAsset Valuator analysis, corporate identity, and package design.&lt;ref name="Pioneer"/&gt;

'''Laura Victoria Albert''' (born November 2, 1965) is an American author of writings that include works credited to the [[literary persona]] [[JT LeRoy]], whom Albert described as an "[[avatar]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Albert|first=Laura|title=Laura Albert at The Moth "My Avatar &amp; Me"|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxAHHXE0HOw|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying she was able to write things as LeRoy that she could not have said as Laura Albert. Albert was born and raised in [[Brooklyn]].  She has also used the names Emily Frasier and Speedie, and published other works as Laura Victoria and Gluttenberg. Albert was sued for fraud when she signed a film option contract with her pseudonym; a jury found against her. The damages to be paid to the film company were settled out of court.

==Writing and other activities==
During her youth, Albert was associated with [[punk rock]] and [[skinhead]] movements. She worked for several years as a [[phone sex]] operator, and reviewing sex sites and products on the Web. During the 1990s, she achieved some degree of fame as a freelance [[sexpert]], under the alias ''Laura Victoria''. At the same time, she started writing stories - using the pen name ''Terminator'' - in the voice of a young boy telling about his difficult childhood and life in the streets. ''Baby Doll'', JT LeRoy's first published story, appeared under the byline "Terminator" in a September 1997 anthology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2006/03/08/albert_3/ She is JT LeRoy], ''Salon.com'', 8 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert published three books under the JT LeRoy pseudonym – [[Sarah (LeRoy novel)|''Sarah'']]'' ''(2000),'' [[The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things (novel)|The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things]]'' (2001), and ''Harold's End'' (2004).

According to ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''Sarah'' was the second book Albert wrote but the first one published. The narrator is an adolescent among a group of [[lot lizard]]s, teen male prostitutes at truck stops. Each wears a signature raccoon penis bone necklace. The narrator aspires to be like his mother, Sarah, to move higher in the ranks of prostitutes. The book is by JT LeRoy but LeRoy's character is never directly named. The nom de lizard is 'Cherry Vanilla' or, more regularly he is called Sarah, after his mother. The writing is evocative of a folksy magical realism, vivid, colorful phrases to describe the unconventional and gritty reality of a young boy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Osgood |first=Kelsey |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/136715/jt-leroys-fiction-good |title=Is JT Leroy's Fiction Any Good? |publisher=New Republic |date=2016-09-12 |accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SF Weekly's literary critic described ''The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things'' as "essentially the prequel to ''Sarah''." This novel is a collection of ten stories that describe a "chaotic, nomadic, and abuse-filled childhood." In the opening story,  "Disappearances," a young boy named Jeremiah leaves a stable foster home to reunite with his biological mother, Sarah, an 18-year-old drug addict. The stories begin in Appalachia and follow the characters to California.  Jeremiah's grandfather beats him while invoking judgmental Christian dogma. The abuse is the most consistent form of physical touch Jeremiah knows, and he comes to interpret it as a form of love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bachtold |first=Beth |url=http://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/the-heart-is-deceitful-above-all-things/Content?oid=2142804 |title=The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things &amp;#124; Books &amp;#124; San Francisco &amp;#124; San Francisco News and Events &amp;#124; SF Weekly |website=Archives.sfweekly.com |date=2001-08-29 |accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert wrote "Dreams of Levitation," Sharif Hamza's short film for [[NOWNESS]], and has also written for the acclaimed television series ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]''. The film "Radiance," which she also wrote, was made an Official Selection of the 2015 Bokeh South African International Fashion Film Festival. She collaborated with director and playwright [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] for the international exhibition of his VOOM video portraits, and with the catalog for his "Frontiers: Visions of the Frontier" at [[Institut Valencià d'Art Modern]] (IVAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=JT LEROY Writer, 2006 Music by Lou Reed |url=http://www.dissidentusa.com/robert-wilson/subjects/jt-leroy/ |title=Jt Leroy |publisher=Dissident USA |date= |accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 she served on the juries of the first Brasilia International Film Festival and the Sapporo International Short Film Festival; she also attended Brazil's international book fair, Bienal Brasil do Livro e da Leitura, where she and [[Alice Walker]] were the U.S. representatives. Brazil's Geração Editorial has re-released the JT LeRoy books in a boxset under Laura Albert's name, and she and JT are the subjects of the hit Brazilian rock musical JT, Um Conto de Fadas Punk ("JT, A Punk Fairy Tale"). On March 11, 2014, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/garchik/article/Long-lost-Ukrainian-uncle-has-left-you-5-million-5304867.php|title=Long-lost Ukrainian uncle has left you $5 million|publisher=|accessdate=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Academy of Friends Oscar Party in San Francisco invited JT LeRoy – played by gender-fluid fashion model Rain Dove Dubilewski – to walk the runway&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGd-Czhqk6I|title=JT LeRoy Lives at  lauraalbert.org|first=|last=Jasmin Lim|date=March 11, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=August 22, 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of its HIV/AIDS fundraiser.

In 2016, Laura Albert starred in a documentary about JT LeRoy that premiered at Sundance, titled ''Author: The JT LeRoy Story'' directed by [[Jeff Feuerzeig]].

Albert has taught at [[Dave Eggers]]' [[826 Valencia]] and the [[California College of the Arts]] in San Francisco, and has lectured with artist Jasmin Lim at [[Artists' Television Access]] with SF Camerawork's Chuck Mobley, in conjunction with a window [[Installation art|installation]] about her work. A spokeswoman for the successful "Heart for Eye" campaign to raise funds for [[restorative eye surgery|eye surgery]] for children,  Albert hosted a television segment and was both an interviewee and an interviewer of inspirational women such as Anastasia Barbieri and [[Anh Duong]]. She was photographed by [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]] for ''QVEST'' magazine and by Kai Regan for his "Reckless Endangerment" at ALIFE; she has also done fashion shoots for [[Christian Lacroix]] and [[John Galliano]]. Albert profiled [[Juergen Teller]] for the 2003 Citibank Photography Prize catalogue; and published her reminiscence of [[Lou Reed]] in [[The Forward]]. She was a catalog contributor for the "Blind Cut" exhibition at New York's [[Marlborough Chelsea]] and collaborated with Williamsburg band [[Japanther]], releasing a limited-edition cassette under the name ''True Love in a Large Room'', with original artwork by [[Winston Smith]].  She has also written for dot429, the world's largest LGBTA professional network, and been an invited speaker at their annual conferences in New York.

==Pseudonym==
As a teen, Albert called suicide hotlines for help. She felt more comfortable speaking with strangers as a boy because of the sexual abuse and degradation she'd suffered that seemed, in her world, relatively common as a female. She found counselors to be sympathetic when she called as a male.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Calling a suicide hotline in the 1990s, she reached Terrence Owens, a psychologist with the McAuley Adolescent Psychiatric Program at [[St. Mary's Medical Center (San Francisco)|St. Mary's Medical Center]] in San Francisco. Owens did not know her as Laura Albert at the time, but as Terminator. She explored this role in their conversations. Owens is credited with encouraging Terminator, who later became known as JT LeRoy, to write during their phone therapy sessions.&lt;ref name="sfgate1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Soul-baring-fiction-author-J-T-LeRoy-plays-with-2556606.php |title=Soul-baring fiction author J.T. LeRoy plays with gender - and identity. Does it really matter who he is? |publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle|SFGate]] |date=2005-12-17 |accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2017}}  Laura Albert explained the circumstances of JT's existence in a Fall 2006 ''[[Paris Review]]'' interview with Nathaniel Rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/miscellaneous/5664/being-jt-leroy-nathaniel-rich|title=Being JT LeRoy|first=Nathaniel|last=Rich|date=|work=theparisreview.org|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attested that she could not have written from raw emotion without the right to be presented to the world via JT LeRoy, whom she calls her "phantom limb." "I had survived sexual and physical abuse and found a way to turn it into art," she later wrote in [[The Forward]]. "Having struggled with issues of gender fluidity when there was no language for it, I created a character both on and off the page who modeled this as yet to be named state of being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://forward.com/culture/351569/how-to-kill-a-butterfly-like-elena-ferrante-or-jt-leroy/?attribution=home-hero-item-text-4 |title=How To Kill a Butterfly Like Elena Ferrante or JT Leroy - Culture – |website=Forward.com |date=2016-10-10 |accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert went on to pursue literary conversations under the guise of JT Leroy, or as his friend Speedie. According to author Mary Gaitskill, at a dinner date in which she and LeRoy were to meet, instead, JT's friend, Speedie, sat down, and she and Gaitskill had a long conversation. "She struck me as very bright and very young," recalled Gaitskill.&lt;ref name="newyorkmetro1"/&gt;

Some accused Albert of intentionally manipulating people with a sympathetic persona such as LeRoy's in order to gain access and publication that she would not otherwise have been able to achieve as Laura Albert. According to the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', "Whether the hoax was a performance-art lark or a cynical Ponzi scheme has been hotly debated. Those who defend the work argue that the stories -- no matter the source -- have touched people, furnishing their minds as literature does. And, they note, the books have always been labeled fiction." &lt;ref name="sfgate1"/&gt;  Said Gaitskill in one interview, "It's occurred to me that the whole thing with Jeremy is a hoax, but I felt that even if it turned out to be a hoax, it's a very enjoyable one. And a hoax that exposes things about people, the confusion between love and art and publicity. A hoax that would be delightful and if people are made fools of, it would be okay—in fact, it would be useful."&lt;ref name="newyorkmetro1"/&gt;  What is not debated is that there was a demand for JT LeRoy to appear in public. ''San Francisco Chronicle'' commented that, "The permeable membrane between author and subject was tantalizing."&lt;ref name="sfgate1"/&gt; LeRoy was known to avoid the spotlight and refused to be labelled permanently male or female. His edgy work, as well as his elusiveness, drew attention from the media and developed a cult-like following, with praise from celebrities including [[Winona Ryder]], [[Courtney Love]], and [[Bono]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} The publisher and marketers capitalized on this fascination to provide further opportunities to expose the books. ''The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things'' was described in the Publisher's Comments as "The extraordinary stories that brought the author a cult following at the age of sixteen," and "loosely edited autobiographical stories" for the persona of JT LeRoy.

Instead of discarding her pseudonym and exposing herself in order to remind the public that LeRoy's story, though published as fiction, was not in fact, a memoir, Laura Albert chose her sister-in-law, Savannah Knoop, a 25-year-old aspiring clothes designer, to embody the pseudonym in public. In 2001, a person claiming to be LeRoy began appearing in public, usually decked out in wigs and sunglasses".&lt;ref name="newyorkmetro1"/&gt; Thereafter, the persona of JT LeRoy took on a public life of its own with a backstory that echoed the settings and events described in the books. Savannah Knoop as JT LeRoy, wore wigs and sunglasses, and was often accompanied by Laura Albert as her roommate, called Speedie/Emily Frasier, and Geoffrey Knoop, called Astor.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

A friend, Steve O'Connor, said that he knew Laura Albert had written the books. Star photographer [[Mary Ellen Mark]] claimed that when she photographed Savannah Knoop for a ''Vanity Fair'' shoot she was certain that Savannah Knoop was a woman and recalled the costumed JT LeRoy persona as "a masquerade that a lot of fancy people fell for...A put-on that didn't harm anybody." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/living/article/IDENTITY-CRISIS-How-former-sex-writer-Laura-2501521.php |title=IDENTITY CRISIS / How former sex writer Laura Albert and her extended family became 'JT LeRoy,' pulling off one of the strangest literary hoaxes of our time |publisher=[[SFGate]] |date=2006-03-19 |accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Stephen Beachy]] published an article in 2005 to imply that Laura Albert wrote the stories,&lt;ref name="newyorkmetro1"/&gt; and later the ''[[New York Times]]'' confirmed that JT LeRoy was the invention of Speedie/Emily, whose real name is Laura Albert. ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' also publicly announced that Laura Albert wrote all of J.T.'s books, articles, and stories, corresponded as J.T. by e-mail, and spoke as him on the phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2006/04/jtleroy200604|title=The Boy Who Cried Author|publisher=''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''|date= |accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savannah Knoop stopped making public appearances as JT LeRoy. The media's attention shifted from a fascination with the persona of JT LeRoy and the writing, to a castigation of Laura Albert. Laura Albert did not publish writing as JT LeRoy again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3756484/|title=The Cult of JT LeRoy|author=|date=November 14, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=April 22, 2017|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/culture/2006/01/09/revealed-jt-leroy-is-merely-a-figment-of-your-imagination/|title=Revealed!

Over the next decade, without the pseudonym, Albert gradually became more publicly expressive. Writing for ''The New York Times'' in 2016, Albert noted, "I meet a lot of young people and they're shocked that it was an issue to even have an avatar. Because they've grown up where you have multiple fully formed avatars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/01/t-magazine/entertainment/author-jt-leroy-story-documentary-laura-albert.html|title=Ten Years Later, the 'Real' JT LeRoy Tells All|date=August 1, 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media discussion about Albert's creation of the JT LeRoy pseudonym and public persona continues to this day. "Looking back, Laura Albert anticipated just about all of it," commented author Adam Langer. "Long before we had split our personas into the lives we truly live and the ones that we choose to create on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and everywhere else, Albert created her own avatar." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/laura-albert/ |title=Laura Albert - Page |publisher=Interview Magazine |date=2015-11-19 |accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxAHHXE0HOw|title=Laura Albert at The Moth "My Avatar &amp; Me"|first=|last=Jasmin Lim|date=November 24, 2010|publisher=|accessdate=April 22, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGd-Czhqk6I|title=JT LeRoy Lives at  lauraalbert.org|first=|last=Jasmin Lim|date=March 11, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=April 22, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/12/movies/asia-argento-and-others-are-angry-about-being-in-jt-leroy-documentary.html|title=Asia Argento and Others Are Angry About Being in JT LeRoy Documentary|first=Colin|last=Moynihan|date=September 11, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=April 22, 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/136715/jt-leroys-fiction-good|title=Is JT Leroy's Fiction Any Good?|author=|date=September 12, 2016|work=newrepublic.com|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://decider.com/2017/02/17/author-jt-leroy-story-review-amazon-prime/|title='Author: The JT Leroy Story' Turns The Page On The Greatest Literary Hoax Of The 21st Century|author=|date=February 17, 2017|work=decider.com|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers have had prolific careers with hundreds of their works being published.  While some [[list of best-selling fiction authors|best-selling author]]s have written a small number of books that have sold millions of copies, others have had lengthy careers and maintained a high level of output year after year. [[Dame Agatha Christie]], the most-published novelist in history, is estimated to have sold 4 billion books, having written 69 novels and 19 plays.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Michael. [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117776459?refCatId=3 Agatha Christie gets a clue for filmmakers]. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. 14 February 2000. Accessed 23 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Her works were published between 1920 and 1976, equating to around three publications every two years. [[Dame Barbara Cartland]] has also sold millions of copies of her books but wrote many more than Christie.  She spent 80 years as a novelist with 722 books published, averaging one book released every 40 days of her career.&lt;ref name="Womack"&gt;Womack, Philip. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/8080503/Being-a-prolific-author-isnt-a-bad-thing.html Being a prolific author isn't a bad thing]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''. 25 October 2010. Accessed 22 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; While Cartland wrote a significant number of full-length novels, other authors have been published many more times but have specialised in short stories. Spanish author Corín Tellado wrote over 4,000 novellas, selling 400 million copies of her books.&lt;ref name="Tellado"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6114908.ece |title=Corín Tellado: Spanish romantic writer |work=The Sunday Times |date=18 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524074821/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6114908.ece |archive-date=24 May 2010 |access-date=20 January 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all authors work alone. Groups of writers, sometimes led by one central figure, have published under shared pseudonyms.  The [[Stratemeyer Syndicate]], started by [[Edward Stratemeyer]] in 1905, created [[List of Stratemeyer Syndicate series|numerous book series]] including 190 volumes of ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'' and 175 volumes of ''[[Nancy Drew]]''.  More than 1,300 books were published by the group, and although Edward L. Stratemeyer wrote several hundred, he also employed [[ghostwriter]]s to keep up with the demand.  These writers were given storylines and strict guidelines to follow to ensure a level of consistency within each series.  Amongst the writing team was [[Howard R. Garis]], who contributed several hundred books to the collection, one of the most active authors.  Sales were estimated at over two hundred million copies before the syndicate was sold to [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Woodmansee, Martha. Osteen, Mark. ''The new economic criticism: studies at the intersection of literature and economics''. Routledge. 1999. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most authors carefully craft their work, writing and rewriting several times before publication.  Some authors simply use pen and paper, while others such as [[Isaac Asimov]] spent hours at a stretch working at a [[typewriter]].&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Lewis. [https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/23/lifetimes/asi-v-profile.html Isaac Asimov: Man of 7,560,000 Words]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. 3 August 1969. Accessed 22 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip M. Parker]], by one measure the world's most prolific author, has an entirely different approach.  Parker has over 200,000 titles listed on [[Amazon.com]], having developed an algorithm to gather publicly available data and compile it into book form.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Cohen, Noam. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/14/business/media/14link.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all He Wrote 200,000 Books (but Computers Did Some of the Work)]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. 14 April 2008. Accessed 22 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PW"&gt;Rosen, Judith. [http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/47019-david-slavitt-joins-the-100-club-at-76.html David Slavitt Joins the 100 Club at 76]. 29 August 2011. Accessed 23 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The computer-generated nature of the books is not detailed on the sales page and the books are printed only when ordered.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muneer_Ahmed_Badini http://www.thenews.com.pk/print.asp?id=72382 http://www.geo.tv/3-23-2009/38013.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The original bronze cast from 1921 is on display in the [[Statens Museum for Kunst|Danish National Gallery]] while another cast was installed at [[Christians Brygge]] outside the [[Black Diamond (library)|Royal Danish Library]] in [[Copenhagen]] in 2009. The original plaster model is owned by the [[Carl Nielsen Museum]] and is on display in the [[Funen Art Museum]] in [[Odense]]. Carl-Nielsen depicts her mermaid in a more dramatic pose than that of [[Edvard Eriksen]]'s far more famous and nine years older [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|''Little Mermaid'']] at Copenhagen's [[Langelinie]] prommendade.

==History==
[[File:Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen with Mermaid sculpture.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen with the plaster model]]
Little is known about the creation of the sculpture. One of Carl-Nielsen's sketchbooks contains some sketches of mermaids but it is not known when they were made or if it was in connection with the creation of the mermaid sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcandersen-homepage.dk/?page_id=52797|title=Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen: Skitser af havfruer (2)|website=H.

The plaster model was created by Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen in 1921. The work was exhibited at [[Den Frie Udstilling]] in [[Copenhagen]] in 1921 and the [[Statens Museum for Kunst|Danish National Gallery]] subsequently purchased the bronze cast for [[Danish krone|DLL]] 4,500.&lt;ref name=Mermaid&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mermaidsofearth.com/mermaid-statues-mermaid-sculptures/public/the-smaller-mermaid/|title=Mermaid|website=Mermaids of Earth|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture was placed in [[Østre Anlæg]] to the rear of the museum but was put on storage in 1970&lt;ref name=Berlingske&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b.dk/kultur/en-havfrue-gaar-i-land|title=En havfrue går i land|language=Danish||publisher=Berlingske|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Mermaid by Anne Marie Carl Nielsen - Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen - DSC08224.JPG|thumb|120px|left|Detail]]
Carl-Nielsen's mermaid is, with her projecting fins, flat nose and fish-like mouth, more creature and less human than [[Edvard Eriksen]]'s nine years older [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|''Little Mermaid'']]. She is also depicted in a more dynamic pose and with a more dramatic expression than that of Eriksen's more famous mermaid: She has a terrified look in her eyes and appears to have just come out of the water, gasping for breath and with hair dripping with water. The Carl Nielsen specialist John Fellow has suggested that the mermaid's tormented facial expression is Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen's comment to her difficult marriage and her husband's repeated infidelity. He  has pointed out that the mermaid sculpture was the only work that she created during this difficult period that was not a commission created out of economic necessity.&lt;ref name=Berlingske/&gt; It has also been suggested that the sculpture symbolizes the transition from girl to woman.&lt;ref name=Berlingske/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/ECE704576/redaktoer-ny-havfrue-er-stoerre-kunst-end-den-gamle/52268|title=Redaktør: Ny havfrue er større kunst end den gamle|language=Danish|website=Politiken|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mexican handcrafted fireworks''' production is mostly concentrated in the [[State of Mexico]] in central [[Mexico]]. The self-declared fireworks capital of Mexico is [[Tultepec]], just north of [[Mexico City]]. Although the main ingredient for fireworks, gunpowder, was brought by the [[conquistador]]s in the 16th century, fireworks became popular in Mexico in the 19th century. Today, it is Latin America’s second largest producer, almost entirely for domestic use, with products ranging from small firecrackers to large shells and frames for pyrotechnics called “castillos” (castles) and “toritos” (little bulls). The industry is artisanal, with production concentrated in family-owned workshops and small factories with a number operating illegally. The relatively informal production and sales of fireworks have made it dangerous with a number of notable accidents in from the late 1990s to the present, despite attempts to safety regulations.

==History==
[[File:BullFrameMAPDF.JPG|thumb|A "torito" or bull frame for fireworks on display at the [[Museo de Arte Popular]] in Mexico City]]
Although pre Hispanic cultures had ways of manipulating fire for ceremonial purposes, the popularity of fireworks came to Mexico late, in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="popularte"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=399 |title=Juegos Pirotécnicos, cohetes y pólvora |publisher=Universidad Veracruzana |location=Veracruz |language=Spanish |trans-title=Pyrotechnic sets, rockets and powder |accessdate=June 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016064326/http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=399 |archivedate=October 16, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elgrito"&gt;{{cite news |title= REPORTAJE /EL GRITO ENTRE FUEGOS |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2003/09/15/02an1cul.php?origen=cultura.php&amp;fly=1  |newspaper= La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=September 15, 2003 |accessdate=June 8, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Special report/The cry among fireworks }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fireworks were invented by the Chinese,  and for ceremonial and religious use, which is their main use today in Mexico.&lt;ref name="lasredes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Los fuegos artificiales |author=Conti González Báez |url=http://radioredam.mx/grc/redam.nsf/vwALL/XPAO-6RSLZV |newspaper=Radio Red AM |location=Mexico City |date=July 15, 2006 |accessdate=June 8, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Fireworks |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130221035330/http://radioredam.mx/grc/redam.nsf/vwALL/XPAO-6RSLZV |archivedate=February 21, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fireworks production and use came to Mexico through Europe. The main ingredient for them, gunpowder, came with the conquistadors but for military purposes. The first place to start gunpowder manufacture was Tultepec, which during the colonial period was separate from Mexico City and had an abundance of saltpeter, from which the chemicals could be extracted.&lt;ref name="sustento"&gt;{{cite news |title=Pirotecnia: El sustento de un pueblo |author=Alicia Rivera |url=http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/impreso/9024568 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128171900/http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/impreso/9024568 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 28, 2013 |newspaper=Milenio Edomex |location=Toluca |date=September 12, 2011 |accessdate=June 8, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Pyrotechics: The sustenance of a town }}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of fireworks begin in the 19th century, after Mexico’s independence.&lt;ref name="elgrito"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sustento"/&gt; Fireworks production, sale and handling is covered by the federal Armas, Municiones, Explosivas y Pirotecnia law, with the aim of reducing the risk associated with the product.&lt;ref name="lasredes"/&gt; This law was enacted in 1963, more geared towards the military. Recent efforts to update the law have included providing training and other measures to extend legal status to irregular manufacturers.&lt;ref name="elgrito"/&gt; Fireworks are a main staple of Mexican religious festivals, especially those for patron saints. However, the main occasion for fireworks use are the celebrations surrounding Mexican Independence, which begins with the reenactment of [[Father Hidalgo]]’s cry against the Spanish at 11pm on September 15, 1810. The fireworks are ignited just after the reenactment.&lt;ref name="elgrito"/&gt;

==Manufacture==

In Latin America, Mexico is the second largest producer of fireworks, after [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name="elgrito"/&gt; There are over 50,000 families in Mexico which manufacture fireworks, many illegally,&lt;ref name="elgrito"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lasredes"/&gt;  with 40,000 families in sixty municipalities in the State of Mexico alone.&lt;ref name="arriesgan"&gt;{{cite news |title=Artesanos pirotécnicos arriesgan la vida |author=Kristian Villaseñor |url=http://www.hoyestado.com/nota.php?id=1635 |newspaper=Hoy Estado de Mexico |location=Toluca |date=February 8, 2012 |accessdate=June 8, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Pyrotechnic artisans risk their lives |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130125165948/http://www.hoyestado.com/nota.php?id=1635 |archivedate=January 25, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these artisans are located in the municipalities of [[Almoloya de Juárez]], [[Axapusco]], [[Tianguistenco]], [[Tenancingo, State of Mexico|Tenancingo]], [[Tenango del Valle]], [[Otumba, State of Mexico|Otumba]], [[Capulhuac]], [[Coyotepec]], [[Tecámac]] and [[Texcoco, State of Mexico|Texcoco]], along with the community of San Mateo Otzacatipan.&lt;ref name="sustento"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ramas"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://portal2.edomex.gob.mx/edomex/estado/identidadmexiquense/artesanias/ramasartesanales/EDOMEX_025671 |title= Pirotecnia |publisher=State of Mexico |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Pyrotechnics |accessdate=June 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the biggest producer is the municipality of Tultepec, located just north of Mexico City, which accounts for 25% of all the fireworks produced in Mexico.&lt;ref name="elgrito"/&gt;

There are three internationally recognized pyrotechnic enterprises in Mexico. Lux Pirotecnia is located in [[Zumpango, State of Mexico|Zumpango]], known for its rigorous manufacturing methods and participation in international competitions in Europe and Canada.&lt;ref name="elgrito"/&gt; Pirotecnia Reyes won first place at the International Fireworks Competition in [[Hannover]], Germany in 2011 with a fireworks and music show lasting 25 minutes. This enterprise was founded by Manues Reyes Arias who received the 1996 [[Premio Nacional de las Artes]] .&lt;ref name="concurso"&gt;{{cite news |title= Artesanos de Tultepec ganan concurso de pirotecnia en Alemania |url= http://mx.noticias.yahoo.com/artesanos-tultepec-ganan-concurso-pirotecnia-alemania-214200963.html |newspaper= El Universal /Yahoo noticias |location=Mexico |date=September 28, 2011 |accessdate=June 8, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Artisans of Tultepec win pyrotechnics competition in Germany }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most artisans are trained by their elders with no formal training or formal degrees in chemistry or engineering, although some have abroad for training as well to promote products.&lt;ref name="arriesgan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="preservar"&gt;{{cite news |title= Tultepec: artesanos de la pirotecnia buscan preservar una tradición de casi 200 años |author= Silvia Chávez González |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/09/15/index.php?section=estados&amp;article=035n1est |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=September 15, 2008 |accessdate=June 8, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Tultepec: Pyrotechnic artisans look to preserve an almost 200-year-old tradition }}&lt;/ref&gt; Artisans buy ingredients in local chemical supply shops and local markets, which are then mixed by hand in family owned workshops and small factories. Everything is made from scratch, with cartridges made of packing tape and scrap paper purchased in bulk. Often, the fireworks are packaged in nothing but old cornmeal and dog food bags.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mexican fireworks pack too much pow |author=Chris Hawley |url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-07-01-mexicofireworks_N.htm |newspaper= USA TODAY |date=July 1, 2009 |accessdate=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most artisans are not formal employees, but rather work in the family business. The formulas used by each workshop are individual and guarded by the families that own them.&lt;ref name="preservar"/&gt; Workshops are ranked with the best artisans receiving the “maestro” (master) title, able to produce elaborate products such as castillos, bombas, toritos and synchronized fireworks/light/music shows.&lt;ref name="preservar"/&gt;

Mexican firework production include a number of explosive objects such as “rocas” (rocks, a kind of powerful firecracker), “vampiros” (vampires), “patas de mula” (mule hooves) and “bombas” (large rockets) as well as frames with pyrotechnics called “castillos” (castles), “toritos” (little bulls), “canastillas” (little baskets) and [[Burning of Judas|Judas figures]] .&lt;ref name="ramas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt;  Castillos are generally large wooden frames covered with brilliant flares, which can cost between 20,000 to 250,000 pesos depending on size and complexity.&lt;ref name="preservar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt; These are most often made to honor patron saints or Mexico’s patriot heroes.&lt;ref name="preservar"/&gt; Toritos are smaller frames in the shape of a bull, designed to be worn or carried by a person as they are lit, chasing passers-by in the street during festivals.&lt;ref name="elgrito"/&gt; A version of the torito is designed to released candy when set off, which as the effect of having children run toward it, instead of running away. Toritos run about 800 pesos in the market.&lt;ref name="preservar"/&gt;

The most elaborate product is called a “piromusical” (pyro-musical) a set of fireworks synchronized to music and sometimes lights, with an average commercial price of about 10,000 pesos a minute, usually lasting about fourteen minutes.&lt;ref name="preservar"/&gt;

==Tultepec==
[[File:FireworksVirginDoc2.JPG|thumb|Setting off cohetones or rockets during a religious festival in [[Colonia Doctores]] in Mexico City]]
Most fireworks in Mexico are produced in the State of Mexico, especially the municipality of Tultepec just north of Mexico City, which has declared itself to be the “pyrotechnics capital of Mexico.”&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="recorre"&gt;{{cite news |title= México recorre su Historia con fuegos artificiales a un paso del Bicentenario |url= http://www.elperiodicodemexico.com/nota.php?id=292936&amp;sec=Nacional-Poblacion |newspaper=El Periodico de Mexico |location=Mexico City |date=September 18, 2009 |accessdate=June 8, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexico revisits its history with fireworks during its Bicentennial }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This area has a two-hundred year tradition of making fireworks, with, about 65 percent of the population of the municipality is involved directly or indirectly in fireworks production.&lt;ref name="sustento"/&gt;&lt;ref name="preservar"/&gt; In Tultepec, all fireworks are made by hand, including decoration and wrapping, mostly in small factories or workshops that produce everything from small firecrackers to twelve-inch shells for professional shows.&lt;ref name="sustento"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt;  Tultepec is also one of the main suppliers of ingredients needed to make fireworks.&lt;ref name="ramas"/&gt;

Most fireworks  production in the municipality is crowded into an area called the La Saucera pyrotechnic zone, located outside the town of Tultepec near the communities of Xahuento and Lomas.&lt;ref name="arriesgan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="preservar"/&gt; Originally, all of the fireworks production was scattered around the municipality, but after the [[Mexico City fireworks disaster|explosion and fire]] of fireworks stands at the [[La Merced Market, Mexico City|La Merced Market in Mexico City]] in 1988, authorities decided to force artisans into one area away from residential areas and with security precautions such as special warehouses for finished products and to store chemicals.&lt;ref name="preservar"/&gt;

The State of Mexico’s largest fireworks market is located here as well, called the Mercado de San Pablito, constructed by the state which spent nine million pesos to construct 300 study block stalls.&lt;ref name="concurso"/&gt;&lt;ref name="preservar"/&gt; However, this market suffered major explosions in 2005 and 2006, reducing most of the stalls to rubble on both occasions. The market also has problems with regulations on how much they can store and sell in the market, as well as the harassment of customers leaving the market by police.&lt;ref name="preservar"/&gt; This has led to a fifty percent reduction in sales volume, with sales shifting to other, often clandestine, outlets in the municipality.&lt;ref name="preservar"/&gt;

The [[National Pyrotechnic Festival|Feria Nacional de la Pirotecnia (National Pyrotechnics Festival)]] occurs each year in March in Tultepec, featuring a national competition of castillos.&lt;ref name="arriesgan"/&gt; Most attendance for the event is for the piromusicales competition, which draws about 10,000 spectators. There are also competitions for toritos and castillos.&lt;ref name="reseña"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.soymexiquense.com/es/edomex/tultepec/125-resena-feria-nacional-de-la-pirotecnia-2012 |title= Reseña Feria nacional de la Pirotecnia 2012 |publisher=State of Mexico |location=Mexico |date=March 10, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Overview of the Feria nacional de la Pirotecnia 2012 |accessdate=June 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Danger==
[[File:Fatotonilco.jpg|thumb|Fireworks exploding over church in [[Atotonilco de Tula]] Mexico]]
The industry is a dangerous one, mostly due to lack of enforcement of existing safety laws and regulation and lack of professional training.&lt;ref name="preservar"/&gt; A Tultepec mural shows townspeople, some lacking hands, lighting powder kegs and among castillos.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt;  In the State of Mexico alone, there are about 500 artisans who make fireworks illegally, without the proper training or facilities and without permission from authorities. According to the Instituto Mexiquense de la Pirotecnia, the main reason for this is that their manufacture is mostly done in families, rather than in factories.&lt;ref name="existen500"&gt;{{cite news |title= Existen 500 artesanos de la pirotecnia irregulares en Edomex |url= http://www.oem.com.mx/laprensa/notas/n2490879.htm |newspaper= El Sol de Toluca |location=Toluca, Mexico |date=April 2, 2012 |accessdate=June 8, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=There are 500 unlicensed pyrotechnic artisans in the State of Mexico }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most accidents have happened in Tultepec, with 46 explosions in the municipality in 2002 alone, with a total of twelve dead and dozens hurt.&lt;ref name="elgrito"/&gt; In 2011, there were fourteen explosions in La Saucera, none of which were fatal, and one in a clandestine shop that left four people dead.&lt;ref name="arriesgan"/&gt;

There have been a number of notable accidents related to the manufacture and sale of fireworks in Mexico. In 1998, an explosion in a workshop in the Barrio de San Agustín neighborhood in Tultepec affected over one hundred houses and killed ten neighbors.&lt;ref name="preservar"/&gt; In 1999, [[Celaya fireworks disaster|an explosion]] in [[Celaya]] left 56 dead and 350 hurt.&lt;ref name="elgrito"/&gt; In 2003, there was an explosion at the Miguel Hidalgo Market in [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], which started at a clandestine fireworks warehouse that resulted in 28 dead, 35 hurt and 52 missing.&lt;ref name="elgrito"/&gt; In 2006, an explosion at the San Pablito market was attributed to a product called a “cerillo” (match), which consists of a colored stick with chemicals on both ends which produces sparks when scraped on a surface. This led to a yearlong ban on the product so its safety could be reevaluated.&lt;ref name="preservar"/&gt; The last major accident in Tultepec was in 2016 when a [[2016 San Pablito Market fireworks explosion|major fireworks explosion in San Pablito]] killed at least 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/metropoli/cdmx/2016/12/21/suman-32-muertes-por-explosion-en-tultepec|title=Suman 32 muertes por explosión en Tultepec|newspaper=El Universal|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sales==

In Mexico, fireworks, especially large rockets called “cohetones” are a staple of patron-saint festivals.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt; Religious festivals even in the smallest towns have fireworks, which can include images of the patron saint on a frame outlined in pyrotechnics. This is particularly true to large pilgrimage sites such as that of [[Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos]].&lt;ref name="elgrito"/&gt; The biggest day for fireworks sales is [[Mexico’s independence day]]. For [[Celebration of Mexican political anniversaries in 2010|Mexico’s Bicentennial celebration]] at the Zocalo or main square in Mexico City, over 2,400 shells composed the multimedia spectacular which begins by a reenactment of Father [[Miguel Hidalgo]]’s call for troops at 11 pm September 15, 1810.&lt;ref name="recorre"/&gt;

There are three markets specializing in fireworks, San Pablito in Tultepec, one in [[Chimalhuacán]] and the other in Zumpango, with San Pablito being the most important in the country.&lt;ref name="arriesgan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="concurso"/&gt;

National sales of fireworks fluctuates between 800,000 and 1,700,000 [[Mexican peso|pesos]] per year.&lt;ref name="exportaran"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://poderedomex.com/notas.asp?id=75595 |title= Juegos pirotécnicos hechos por manos mexiquenses se exportarán al país vecino del norte |publisher=State of Mexico |location=Mexico |date=April 25, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Pyrotechnic sets made by Mexican hands to be exported to neighboring country |accessdate=June 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only thirteen Mexican enterprises export abroad, mostly because they do not meet the standards for fireworks set by the United States, the closest major international market.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="exportaran"/&gt; Mexican fireworks tend to be more powerful than mass-produced Chinese ones, which account for most of legal sales in the United States, which tempts many Americans to try and bring them across the border for [[Fourth of July]] celebrations.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt;

Mexican fireworks are mostly promoted by the State of Mexico’s Instituto Mexiquense de Pirotecnia, which sponsors events such as art exhibits with a pyrotechnic theme and puppet shows on fireworks safety for children.&lt;ref name="neza"&gt;{{cite news |title= Exponen pirotecnia en Neza |author= Héctor Ledezma |url=  http://www.eluniversaledomex.mx/nezahualcoyo/nota4415.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Toluca |date=June 29, 2010 |accessdate=June 8, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Exhibit pyrotechnics in Ciudad Nezahuacoyotl }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry for Culture and Heritage''' ('''MCH''') ([[Māori language|Māori]]: ''Manatū Taonga'') is the public service department of New Zealand charged with advising the [[Government of New Zealand|government]] on policies and issues involving the [[Creative New Zealand|arts]], [[Culture of New Zealand|culture]], [[New Zealand Historic Places Trust|heritage]], [[Sport New Zealand|sport and recreation]], and [[Public broadcasting in New Zealand|broadcasting]] sectors, and participating in functions that advance or promote those sectors.

==History==
The Ministry was founded in 1999 with the merger of the former Ministry of Cultural Affairs and the history and heritage functions of the [[Department of Internal Affairs (New Zealand)|Department of Internal Affairs]], as well as some functions from the [[Department of Conservation]] and [[Ministry of Commerce (New Zealand)|Ministry of Commerce]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/about-ministry/overview/history-government-involvement-culture|title=History of Government involvement in culture|website=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;{{cite press release|author=Marie Hasler|date=28 July 1999|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/cultural-and-heritage-sector-some-relevant-questions-and-answers|title=Cultural and Heritage sector – some relevant questions and answers|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the merger of functions and departments was to create a coherent, non-fragmented overview of the cultural and heritage sector, rather than spreading services and functions across several departments.&lt;ref name="PR"/&gt;

Minister for Cultural Affairs [[Marie Hasler]] oversaw the transition of functions into the new agency.&lt;ref name="PR"/&gt; Opposition Labour MP [[Judith Tizard]], who would later serve as an Associate Minister for the ministry in the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand]], accused the restructure of being "all hype, no substance," lacking the funding and human resource necessary to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|author=Judith Tizard|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA9907/S00546/all-hype-no-substance.htm|title=All hype, no substance|date=28 July 1999|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Cultural Affairs had been created in 1991; prior to this, the Department of Internal Affairs had provided oversight and support for arts and culture functions.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

At the time of its establishment, the responsible minister for the ministry was the Minister for Culture and Heritage. This position is now titled the [[Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage]].

== Functions ==
The ministry advises the government on policies and issues relating to the arts, culture, heritage, sport and recreation, and broadcasting sectors. It funds 17 other agencies which also support these sectors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/funding-nz-culture/agencies-we-fund|title=Agencies we fund|website=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; looks after monuments and war graves throughout New Zealand and is involved in a number of projects promoting and documenting New Zealand history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/what-we-do/our-projects|title=Our projects|website=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guardianship===
In 2014 the ministry became the guardian of the [[Television New Zealand Archive|TVNZ Archive]] collection on behalf of the crown.&lt;ref name="govt-press-release-budget-2014"&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Budget 2014: Better access to NZ’s TV heritage|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/budget-2014-better-access-nz’s-tv-heritage|publisher=New Zealand Government|date=May 21, 2014|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appointed [[Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision]] as the initial archive manager. The TVNZ Archive collection contains over 600,000 hours of television spanning almost 55 years of New Zealand's public television history.&lt;ref name="craig-foss-transfer-speech"&gt;{{cite speech|title=Draft speech|first=Craig|last=Foss|event=Function to mark the transfer of responsibility for the TVNZ Archives to the New Zealand Film Archive|location=Wellington, New Zealand|date=July 31, 2014|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/6578/response/22258/attach/4/Joss%20J%20OIA%20documents%20for%20release.pdf|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes iconic New Zealand content such as documentaries, dramas, sports programmes&lt;ref name="mch-briefing-2014-36"&gt;{{cite report|author=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|date=February 14, 2013|title=TVNZ Archive - Update on IP issues (briefing 2014/36)|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/6578/response/22258/attach/4/Joss%20J%20OIA%20documents%20for%20release.pdf|page=11|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and every TVNZ news broadcast from December 1986 to 2014.&lt;ref name="ntsv-tvnz-collection-video"&gt;{{cite web|title=Video: Preserving the TVNZ Collection|url=https://ngataonga.org.nz/preservation/our-preservation-work/video-preserving-the-tvnz-collection|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oia-5402-fyi-release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Information Act request (5402)|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/5402-avalon-archive-facility-follow-up-information-requested|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 briefing to Minister [[Craig Foss]], the ministry noted that the long-term preservation of the TVNZ Archive collection did not align with the broadcaster's business needs and that transferring the collection to the crown would allow for the proper preservation of the collection.&lt;ref name="mch-briefing-2014-017"&gt;{{cite report|author=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|date=March 21, 2014|title=TVNZ Archive transfer - update (briefing 2014/107)|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/6578/response/22258/attach/4/Joss%20J%20OIA%20documents%20for%20release.pdf|page=16|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the ministry and TVNZ explicitly wanted to ensure the archive was preserved and that it was made increasingly available for re-use through online streaming and other means.&lt;ref name="mou-access-to-tvnz-archive-collection"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fyi.org.nz/request/4927/response/17172/attach/4/MOU%20Access%20to%20TVNZ%20Archive%20Collection%20new%20scan.pdf|title=Memorandum of Understanding - Access to TVNZ Archive Collection, between the Ministry for Culture and Heritage and the Department of Internal Affairs|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History and heritage===
The ministry supports research into and promotion of [[New Zealand history]]. This includes publication of New Zealand history books and e-books, and a number of websites. The ministry's managed sites include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/what-we-do/websites-we-run|title=Websites we run|website=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Dictionary of New Zealand Biography]]
* '''[https://ngatapuwae.govt.nz/ Ngā Tapuwae trails]'''

* '''Landmarks Whenua Tohunga'''
David Green, a historian working for the ministry, discovered that significantly more New Zealand personnel were engaged in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] than had been recorded in [[Fred Waite (politician)|Fred Waite]]'s official history, ''The New Zealanders at Gallipoli''. Waite's number of some 8,500 men was corrected to approximately 13,000 in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New research: How many New Zealanders served on Gallipoli? |url= http://www.gallipoli2015.govt.nz/new-research-how-many-new-zealanders-served-on-gallipoli |publisher=[[New Zealand Defence Force]] |date=3 September 2013|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landmarks Whenua Tohunga is a partnership between the Ministry, the [[Department of Conservation Te Papa Atawhai]], [[Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga]] and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. The programme promotes and encourages people to visit New Zealand’s historically and culturally important places.  Landmarks has been launched so far in Northland and Otago.

== History ==

MCBA was established in 1983. Two years later, it moved to the first floor of the McKesson building, at 24 North Third Street, in the [[North Loop, Minneapolis|Warehouse District]] of Minneapolis. In this space, MCBA established educational, artistic, and community programs to introduce book arts to the public and promote appreciation of artists' books, fine-press publications, broadsides and other artworks created using book art techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Amy. "Made by Hand". ''Format'', January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, MCBA joined [[The Loft Literary Center]] and [[Milkweed Editions]] in establishing [[Open Book Minneapolis|Open Book]], a center for literary and visual arts, in downtown Minneapolis.

The '''Monifieth Sculptured Stones''' are a series of five class II and III standing [[Pictish stones]] from the [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|early Medieval period]] found in or around St Regulus' church in [[Monifieth]], [[Angus, Scotland]]. Uncovered during the demolition of a pre-Reformation church and its kirkyard wall in the 19th and 20th centuries, the stones are now housed in the collection of the [[Museum of Scotland]].

==Location==
Stones located at [[St Regulus]]' (St Rule's) Church, [[Monifieth]], [[Angus, Scotland]] ({{gbmapping|NO49533235}}) until 1870 (the stones known as Monifieth 1, 2, 3 and 4) or 1928 (Monifieth 5). Monifieth 4 was possibly originally located at [[Brigid of Kildare|St Bride's]] Ring, Kingennie ({{gbmapping|NO47463536}}) and moved to Monifieth in pre-Reformation times. All five are now housed in the collection of the [[Museum of Scotland]], [[Edinburgh]] ({{gbmapping|NT257732}}).

==History==
[[File:Monifieth1 rear.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Monifieth 1, rear face]]
The church and lands of Monifieth were originally possessions of the ascetic [[Culdee|Céli Dé]] [[monastic order]]. The church was endowed to the recently founded [[Arbroath Abbey]] by [[Gille Críst, Earl of Angus]] around 1201–1207, and the lands to the south of the Church (now much reduced in size due to erosion) in 1242–1243 by [[Matilda, Countess of Angus]].&lt;ref name="Warden"&gt;

The materials of the Culdee buildings were apparently recycled when a new church building was erected at some point before the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. This building was, in turn, demolished to make way for a new church in 1812. During the demolitions, "remains of the Culdee edifice" were found dating from before the church's acquisition by Arbroath Abbey.&lt;ref name="NSA"&gt;{{citation

According to Samuel Miller, minister at Monifieth during the time of the [[Statistical Accounts of Scotland|Second Statistical Account]], this had been appropriated from a site several miles to the North at Kingennie, known as St Bride's Ring, the remains of a circular stone structure 30 metres in diameter, with walls 2 metres thick and 0.5 metres high. ({{gbmapping|NO47463536}}). Miller's account refers to a large socketed boulder, some yards to north that once held the cross.&lt;ref name="NSA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Description==
===Monifieth 1===
[[File:Monifieth1 front.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Monifeith 1 front]]The stone is an upright slab of grey sandstone, 0.72 metres tall, 0.36 metres wide and 0.15 metres thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

  | accessdate = July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is dressed, with designs carved in relief including both [[Christian]] and [[Picts|Pictish]] [[symbols]], defining it as a Class II cross slab under [[J. Romilly Allen]] and Joseph Anderson's classification system.&lt;ref name="ECM"&gt;{{citation

  | first1 = J.R.
  | last2 = Anderson

  | year = 1903
  | title = Early Christian Monuments of Scotland
  | publisher = Pinkfoot Press (1993 facsimile)
  | location = Balgavies, Angus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The front face of the stone bears a notched [[Quadrate (heraldry)|Quadrate cross]] decorated with keywork designs, surrounded by a thick border around the edge of the stone. The rear face is unique in having [[Double disc (Pictish symbol)|double disc symbols]] ''both'' with and without Z-rod ornamentation. The unornamented double disc lies horizontally at the top and is decorated with spiral designs. The double disc and Z-rod lies vertically on the right hand side of the face and is decorated with concentric circles. On the left of the face is a comb symbol and, lying between the comb and double disc and Z-rod, is an area of damage, where a long rectangular section had been removed when the stone was incorporated into the fabric of St Regulas' Church. The lower portion of the rear face is heavily damaged, but a portion of the edge of a circular symbol remains. Given the presence of a comb symbol, this may have originally represented a mirror, typical of the relatively common [[Mirror and comb (Pictish symbol)|mirror and comb]] pairing. This face also features a heavy border around the edge.

===Monifieth 2===
[[File:Monifieth2 rear.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Monifeith 2 rear]]
Monifieth 2 is another class II cross slab of grey sandstone, 0.45 metres tall by 0.3 metres wide by 0.08 metres thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
  | title= Monifieth Cross Slab (Monifieth 2)
  | url = http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/33409/details/monifieth/
  | work = Canmore, Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland
  | accessdate = July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has substantial areas of wear to the rear.

The front again features a notched quadrate cross, with the central section featuring an angular knotwork design. The arms also have knotworks, whereas the shaft features a spiral design above a small keywork and the head has a further spiral design. On the rear face there are a variety of symbols. There are bird headed creatures incorporated into the upper border of the slab. The upper half of the slab holds two designs: on the left, a long-necked creature similar to that on one of the sides of Monifieth 4; on the right, a deer's head similar to that on the Class I stone at [[Dunachton]] and the Class II Glamis Manse stone. The lower right quadrant of the slab has a [[Crescent (Pictish symbol)|crescent and v-rod]] design and the lower left holds a worn figure, cloaked and bearing a halo, recently identified as the virgin Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

{{-}}

===Monifieth 3===
Another type II cross slab, Monifieth 3 is 0.45 metres by 0.58 metres by 0.08 metres. The front face features a defaced cross shaft with birds and animals at the sides. The rear features a figure on horseback, a crescent symbol, dog, fish monster, a dog chasing a stag and a pair of biting heads.&lt;ref&gt;The Canmore record is at odds with Neish's account of the donation, stating that Monifieth 3 was also found in the church foundations and incorporated into the 1812 building.&lt;br&gt;{{citation

  | work = Canmore, Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland
  | accessdate = July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monifieth 4===
[[File:Monifieth4front.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Monifeith 4 front]]
The largest stone is a fragment of a free-standing [[high cross]], 1.16 metres by 0.28 metres wide by 0.18 metres thick, once built into the front of St Regulus' Church and possibly originally from St Bride's Ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
  | title= Monifieth Cross (Monifieth 4)

  | work = Canmore, Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland
  | accessdate = July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it features [[Celts|Celtic]] Christian imagery, it has no idiomatic Pictish symbols, defining it as Class III.&lt;ref name="ECM"/&gt; The cross is broken at bottom of intersection with the arms. The upper portion of the front face is a [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] scene, with the portion of the [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] figure above the waist missing. Flanking his legs are two human figures. Below the crucifixion scene are two robed figures holding unidentifiable objects. Below them are a further two figures holding drinking horns and the bottom of the cross has a seated harpist, similar to that on the [[Dupplin Cross]].

The rear face features a ringed knotwork design above a back-biting creature. The sides of the cross also feature knotwork designs, above phantasmogorical creatures.

===Monifieth 5===
Monifieth 5 is another class III high cross fragment, broken under the arms. It measures 0.5 metres long, 0.2 metres wide and 0.1 metres thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
  | title= Monifieth Cross (Monifieth 5)
  | url = http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/33412/details/monifieth/
  | work = Canmore, Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland
  | accessdate = July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front again features part of a crucifixion scene, with the Christ figure broken off at the waist. Flanking his legs are two figures. The lower part of the cross shaft is worn and any decoration has been worn away. The rear of the cross shaft is also too worn to interpret.&lt;ref name="Donations to the Museum"/&gt;

The '''No Show Museum''' is an [[art museum]], established in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] in 2015, devoted to [[nothing]] and its various manifestations throughout the [[history of art]]. It claims to be the first of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;cf.: Art in Berlin: "[http://www.art-in-berlin.de/incbmeld.php?id=3672 Dem Nichts Raum geben]"&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by Swiss conceptual artist and curator [[Andreas Heusser]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.andreasheusser.com/ | title=Andreas Heusser }}&lt;/ref&gt; the museum's collection today includes around 500 works and documents from over 150 international artists of the 20th and 21st centuries.

==Virtual collection==
The museum's collection is freely accessible online and displays works, documents, and artifacts from conceptual art, minimalist art, performance art, and painting, as well as from photography, literature, theatre,  film, and music. In all, the collection extends over four  ours, each with two wings, and with various tracts that are thematically dedicated to different way of approaching nothing:
* Nothing as Refusal: The Art of Doing Nothing
* Nothing as Annihilation: The Art of Destruction
* Nothing as Emptiness: The Art of Absence
* Nothing as Invisibility: The Art of The Imperceptible, The Unseen, and The Hidden 
* Nothing as Reduction: The Art of Minimalism
* Nothing as Lacuna: The Art of Omission
* Nothing as Statement: The Art of Saying Nothing Nothing as Notion: The Art of Pure Imagination

The museum also provides background information in German, Spanish and English about all the works and artists. In addition, there is library that provides texts, publications, and exhibition catalogues for further research on nothing in art and other disciplines (philosophy, science, literature, music, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Nana Adusei-Poku: [http://www.e-flux.com/journal/80/101727/on-being-present-where-you-wish-to-disappear/ On Being Present Where You Wish to Disappear]. In: Journal #80 - March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile museum==
=== Converted bus ===
Since 2015, the No Show Museum has been on a world tour with a converted bus. Inside, the mobile museum is a futuristic white cube (4 m long, 2 m wide, 2.10 m high), in which the current special exhibition is shown. It also offers access to the virtual collection via ipad stations and houses the museum shop with a limited selection of souvenirs such as the BUY NOTHING CARD® (personal credit card to buy nothing) or ART FREE AIR® (medicine for allergy sufferers). The matt black painted exterior of the bus serves as a moving blackboard, which can be labeled with announcements and information about the current exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Laura B. Villalta: [http://americanosfera.org/2017/11/museo-de-la-nada-en-marte/ Museo de la Nada en MARTE]. Americanosfera, 16.11.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thematic special exhibitions ===
The special exhibitions in the Mobile Museum each illuminate certain aspects, variants and themes of nothingness in art: '' INVISIBLE ARTWORKS '' (2015) presented 24 intangible and invisible works of conceptual art. The show '' NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE ''(2016) focused on works of art that do not exist and can not possibly exist (eg because it simply exceeds the possibilities of producing the artwork, or because trying to realize it leads to unsolvable conceptual and logical contradictions.) The special exhibition '' ¡NO FALTA NADA! '' (2017) was about the art of nothing as an absence, eg because the artwork has been lost or irrevocably destroyed, or because it has never existed.&lt;ref&gt;Arnulfo Agüero: [https://www.laprensa.com.ni/2017/12/11/cultura/2345136-viaje-espectacular-del-arte-las-regiones-la-nada Un viaje espectacular del arte a las regiones de la nada]. La Prensa, 12.11.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nothing world tour==
The No Show Museum has committed itself to the mission to spread nothing all over the globe. For this reason, the museum is touring year after year from continent to continent.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrix Dargel: [http://www.deutsches-museum.de/fileadmin/Content/010_DM/060_Verlag/060_KuT/2018/KT1-2018/Dargel.pdf Nichts zu sehen!] In: Deutsches Museum (Ed.): Kultur &amp; Technik. Nichts, Edition 1/2018. Munich.&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage of the World Tour started in Zurich in July 2015 and led through 20 countries of Central and Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Carina Pérez: [http://www.nvinoticias.com/nota/76607/llega-el-no-show-museum-al-maco Llega el No Show Museum al MACO]. NVI Noticias, 18.11.2017&lt;/ref&gt; It included around 30 exhibitions in [[museums]] and empty [[Art museum|galleries]] in [[public spaces]] and remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;See: Documentation on [http://www.facebook.com/noshowmuseum www.facebook.com/noshowmuseum] or on [http://www.noshowmuseum.com www.noshowmuseum.com], section "Archive/Past Exhibitions"&lt;/ref&gt; The tour ended in October 2015 with an exhibition and presentation of nothing in [[Venice]] where the No Show Museum was invited by Pro Helvetia's Salon Suisse as an official participant of the [[Biennale di Venezia|56th Art Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Juri; Zweifel, Stefan: "[https://biennials.ch/home/EventDetail.aspx?EventId=73 Pro Helvetia's platform to present the Swiss contributions to the Venice Biennials]"&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2016, the mobile museum was shipped from Europe to America with the mission to spread nothing in the New World: The 80-day exhibition tour led from New York to Canada, then to the West Coast of the U.S., and finally down to Baja California Sur, Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Yale University Radio WYBCX: [http://museumofnonvisibleart.com/interviews/andreas-heusser/ The Art World Demystified]. Hosted by Brainard Carey&lt;/ref&gt;
The third stage took place from November 2017 to January 2018 and led from Baja California in Mexico through the countries of Central America (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama) to Colombia, with numerous exhibitions in public space and in collaboration with museums and local galleries.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Moreno: [https://elperiodico.com.gt/oculta/2017/11/28/el-arte-en-la-ausencia/ El arte en la ausencia]. El Periodico, 28.11.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual background==

===Nothing as an aesthetic category ===
In the course of the 20th century, [[nothing]] has become as distinctive an aesthetic category as “the beautiful”, “the ugly” or "the absurd".&lt;ref&gt;cf. Lucy R. Lippard, Six Years: "The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972". New York, Praeger, 1973, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic examination of the (non) [[phenomenon]] "nothing" has led artists and critics to question the traditional practices of art production and open up new possibilities of spatial, temporal and material interpretation. Nothing is usually understood as the [[negation]] of being and figuration, but strictly speaking, it is impossible to define nothing.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Lütkehaus, Ludger: "Nichts", Haffmans Verlag, Zürich 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Every attempt to describe, represent or materialize nothing is doomed to fail, and it is this very fact that has inspired many artists of the [[20th century]] to work intensively with [[nothing]] and the [[paradoxes]] of its (re)presentation.
The result is a large number of artistic strategies and works on nothing.&lt;ref&gt;See the following exhibition catalogues on nothing:
* Armleder, John; Copeland, Matthieu; Le Bon, Laurent; Metzger, Gustav; Perret, MaiThu; Phillpot, Clive and Pirotte, Philippe (eds): "Voids: A Retrospective", Zürich : JRP Ringier, 2009
* Hollein, Max, Weinhart, Martina: "Nichts – Nothing", Ostfildern : Hatje Cantz, 2006
* Rugoff, Ralph: "Art about the Unseen", 1957-2012, London: Hayward Publishing, 2012
* Varnedoe, Kirk: "Pictures of Nothing. Abstract Art since Pollock", Princeton/Oxford : Princeton University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nothing as a ready-made===
Already in 1913, [[Marcel Duchamp]] demonstrated with his first [[ready-mades]] how any object can be converted into art by removing it from the sphere of ordinary life and placing it in a gallery or [[museum]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. Dorothee Fauth: "Kunstlexikon: Readymade". Hatje Cantz 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This move from one context to another changes the way spectators view an object: in the context of art, it is no longer perceived as a mere object, but instead as placeholder of an idea or of an artistic intention. The result of such attributions is that the formerly ordinary object is transformed into a [[work of art]].
The same principle can be applied to [[nothing]], and [[nothing]] can equally acquire “the dignity of a work of art by the mere choice of the artist” (André Breton).&lt;ref&gt;Hector Olbak: "[http://www.toutfait.com/issues/issue_2/Articles/obalk.html The Unfindable Readymade]"&lt;/ref&gt; The No Show Museum is an attempt to create such an [[institutional framework]] for ensuring in the long run that nothing is art.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.rts.ch/audio/la-1ere/programmes/forum/6397057-le-no-show-museum-le-musee-qui-n-a-rien-a-montrer-26-12-2014.html La musée qui n'a rien à montrer]". RTS.ch (2014-12-26)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The museum as a mobile art context===
Although the museum’s collection is [[virtuality|virtual]], the museum does have a physical space for presentations setup in a restored and customized post bus.  Thus, the museum provides a moving art context that can either be attached to established institutions are function autonomously.  Moreover, the mobile museum offers the opportunity to discover new regions and spaces for the contexts of nothing, and it serves as a marker to indicate any place as an exhibition area.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/bellevue/Das-Nichts-ist-unser-aller-Horizont/story/25033531 Das Nichts ist unser aller Horizont]".

}}

Pacific Green designs and manufactures furniture and architectural products. It is most recognised for its development of '''Palmwood''', a sustainable substitute for tropical [[hardwood]]. Pacific Green products are distributed internationally.

==History==
Post &amp; Rail Furniture was started by Bruce Dowse and Peter Ryan in 1973 in Sydney, Australia. As it expanded internationally in the late 1980s, the company rebranded as Pacific Green. Its purpose was to create a viable substitute for tropical hardwoods by recycling plantation [[coconut|coconut palms]]. Although palms are extremely hard and durable, their unique properties made them difficult to work using conventional techniques. At [[Sigatoka]] in the Fijian Islands, Pacific Green set up the world’s first factory - Pacific Green Industries (Fiji) Limited - dedicated to the research and development of coconut palms.

Palmwood was chosen as the sustainable exterior wood for [[Masdar City|Masdar]], the world's first 'eco-city' in Abu Dhabi, including gates, screens and doors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenprophet.com/2011/02/pacific-green-masdar-gates/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of hardwood substitutes==
Palmwood was the name Pacific Green gave to the finished ‘hardwood’ material it developed. Process breakthroughs had created a durable consumer-oriented product that was suitable in a variety of climates and resilient to wood-boring insects. Palmwood is an ecologically sustainable timber alternative.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/resources/links/deforestation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenous design==
The designs of the furniture - by Bruce Dowse and his Australian design team - are inspired by the artefacts and tools of traditional societies, using natural materials sourced from around the World. Each piece is handcrafted by artisans using traditional techniques and is designed to give a sense of its global ethnic origins.

==Socially responsible manufacturing==
Pacific Green pioneered the creation of a socially responsible industry for the Pacific region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/pubdocs/1998/64/en/1/ef9864en.pdf|title=Design for Sustainable Development|publisher=European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions}}&lt;/ref&gt; By recycling unproductive coconut palms, old plantation land was returned to the local villages to replant with young fruit-bearing palms and other cash crops. The factory was built in consultation with the surrounding villages, and the land used was leased from the villagers to respect local ownership. Pacific Green Industries (Fiji) Limited is listed on the [[South Pacific Stock Exchange]] and its majority owners are the Fijian people.

Manufacturing processes use no toxins or chemicals and by-products are reused. In 2001, Pacific Green addressed the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) on the social responsibility of manufacturing companies. Pacific Green also advised the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] on its study on Coconut Palm Stems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/ag335e/AG335E03.htm#ch2&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid-1990s to early-2000s, actor [[Pierce Brosnan]] was the company's Environmental Spokesperson.

As a result, Pacific Green was invited to participate at the [[Expo 2010|World Expo 2010]] within the Pacific Pavilion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010expo/2010-08/20/content_11180648_2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacific Green unveiled the Indigenous Masterpieces concept at its debut in Milan's [[Salone del Mobile]] in 2011.

'''RefME''' was a free [[Reference management software|citation management tool]] available on web, [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. It offered a functionality that allowed users to scan book and journal [[barcode]]s with a [[mobile device]] and generate citations automatically.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Click{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b06bbm1g/click-05092015|title=BBC Click 5th September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was compatible with other citation management tools such as [[Mendeley]], [[Zotero]], [[RefWorks]], and [[EndNote]] and enables exporting in over 7000 citation styles.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferhicks/2015/04/12/uk-edtech-company-to-simplify-academic-referencing/|title=GUK EdTech Company To Simplify Academic Referencing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, the company released a Chrome plug-in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Aaron|title=Exam Revision, Dissertations and Deadlines – FIVE of the BEST apps for students|url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/576634/Productivity-Apps-iPhone-Mac-App-Store-Windows-5-Students-Revision|date=May 12, 2015|publisher=Sunday Express|accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow for direct clipping of web sources, which was followed in August 2015 by a similar iOS extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McClellan|first1=Craig|title=RefMe Adds iOS Share Extension|url=http://www.theclassnerd.com/blog/2015/8/25/refme-adds-ios-share-extension|website=The Class Nerd|accessdate=7 February 2016|date=August 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; RefME was shut down on March 7, 2017, after being acquired by the education company [[Chegg, Inc.]].

==History==
RefME was founded 2014 by Tom Hatton,&lt;ref&gt;Startups.co.uk{{cite web|url=http://startups.co.uk/the-highs-and-lows-of-life-as-a-young-entrepreneur/|title=The Highs and Lows of Life as a Young Entrepreneur}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Forshew, and Tom Gardiner&lt;ref&gt;The Huffington Post{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/12/18/young-entrepreneur-week-meet-creators-referencing-tool-refme_n_6346784.html|title=Young Entrepreneur Of The Week: Meet The Creators Of The Student Referencing Tool RefME}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based in London and had over a million registered users.

'''Ruth Fowler''' (also '''Aitken''') is a fictional character from the popular British [[BBC]] soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Caroline Paterson]] from 1994 to 1999. Ruth is [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]])'s second wife and she is far more comfortable with his HIV status than many of his other girlfriends. However, their marriage eventually disintegrates due to Mark's habit of shutting her out and his inability to give Ruth a child. They split and she strays with Mark's cousin, [[Conor Flaherty]] ([[Seán Gleeson]]). Her betrayal deeply hurts Mark but it also gives her the chance to be a mother as she becomes pregnant with Conor's child.

==Storylines==
Ruth, who is from [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], comes from a strict [[Presbyterian]] family headed by a minister father. She comes to London with her friend Anna, because she does not want to comply with her father's ideals. Anna contracts HIV, and Ruth is first seen in July 1994, visiting her at a hospice. There, she meets [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]), who has HIV.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters_cast/characters/character_ruth_f.shtml Ruth Fowler character profile (see Arrival)]", BBC. Retrieved 3 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; She and Mark bond, and he comforts her when Anna dies.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://archives.walford.net/1007.htm ''EastEnders'' THU 28-JUL-94 episode description]", Walford.net. Retrieved 3 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They start a relationship and she becomes a childminder.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://archives.walford.net/1035.htm ''EastEnders'' MON 03-OCT-94 episode description]", Walford.net. Retrieved 3 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, they get engaged, and Ruth's father insists that they marry in Scotland but her family are not welcoming when they discover Mark's HIV status. They respond with trepidation and ignorance, refusing to distinguish between AIDS and HIV, despite Mark's best efforts to explain. Believing he is contagious, they do not let him stay in their home, suggesting that he represents everything they have spent their lives battling. Ultimately, Ruth and Mark marry without her parents' blessing.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://archives.walford.net/1123.htm ''EastEnders'' THU 20-APR-95 episode description]", Walford.net. Retrieved 3 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

They soon start to argue because Ruth although she tells Mark she is happy about not having children, this is not true. They visit a counsellor who tells them their options, and they decide to be [[foster parents]]. They are given their first foster child, 6-year-old [[Jessie Moore]] (Chelsey Paden), whose mother is in prison on remand. Jessie refuses to speak and wets the bed. Mark and Ruth try to get her to engage with them and they eventually make progress. Ruth returns to Scotland to visit her father, who has had a stroke. While she is away, Jessie receives a letter from her mother, saying she will be released from prison. When Ruth returns after her father's death, she is furious that Jessie has visited her mother in prison and will probably be returning to her mother soon. Ruth and Mark argue and Ruth grows closer to Mark's cousin, [[Conor Flaherty]] ([[Seán Gleeson]]), who is staying with them. Jessie's mother, Nicole, visits and tells them she is taking steps to get Jessie back.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://archives.walford.net/1572.htm ''EastEnders'' TUE 03-FEB-98 episode description]", Walford.net. Retrieved 3 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; When Mark and Ruth try contesting Nicole's decision, they are told that fostering is about reuniting children with their parents. Both become depressed and Mark's jealousy over Ruth's relationship with Conor makes things worse. When Jessie returns to Nicole, Mark and Ruth's relationship declines swiftly. Amidst constant arguing and jealousy, Mark moves out. Ruth gets drunk and tries to seduce Conor but he turns her down, admitting to finding her attractive but he says he cannot have sex with someone whose previous partner is HIV positive and berates her for being irresponsible. Ruth is deeply offended, and when Mark finds out what has happened, he declares that their marriage is over.

Ruth spends much time partying, clubbing, and enjoying her freedom. Her wild behaviour attracts barman [[Huw Edwards (EastEnders)|Huw Edwards]] ([[Richard Elis]]), but she rebuffs his advances. Eventually, Ruth's partying and neglect of her property means she cannot pay her bills. Mark's mother, [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]), gives her money hoping that she and Mark will reconcile but it becomes clear that this will not happen. Ruth begins an affair with Conor, but after they have sex, he worries that Ruth will get pregnant and insists she take the [[morning-after pill]]. Ruth protests and eventually lies that she has taken it. The affair ends but she is pregnant. When Conor's daughter [[Mary Flaherty (EastEnders)|Mary Flaherty]] ([[Melanie Clark Pullen]]) accidentally tells Mark this, he is furious and beats Conor up and informs him of the pregnancy. Conor suggests he and Ruth resume their relationship and bring up the child together but she refuses, choosing to be a single parent and returns to Scotland, rejecting Mark and Conor as she leaves.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://archives.walford.net/1740.htm ''EastEnders'' THU 11-FEB-99 episode description]", Walford.net. Retrieved 3 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Conor and Mary leave Walford, looking for Ruth.

==Development==
Ruth was introduced in 1994 by Series Producer [[Barbara Emile]] as a love-interest for [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]), who was HIV positive in the serial. Her storyline focused upon the marriage of the couple, and in particular the difficulties that they faced due to Mark's HIV status (Ruth was HIV negative).&lt;ref name="hiv"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MY+ESCAPE+FROM+A+DRUGS+HELL%3b+Former+EastEnders+star+Caroline+Paterson...-a099062380| title=MY ESCAPE FROM A DRUGS HELL.| work = [[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|date=22 March 2003| accessdate = 30 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 1998, executive producer [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]] axed a large number of characters from ''EastEnders'', among them Ruth Fowler. An ''EastEnders'' spokeswoman said, "In any long-running drama there are going to be changes from time to time. We have some powerful storylines coming up this autumn, and some characters will not have a role in them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BBC+axe+falls+on+ten+top+EastEnders.-a060783470| title=BBC axe falls on ten top EastEnders.| work = [[The Birmingham Post]]|date=27 June 1998| accessdate = 30 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth's exit storyline surrounded the break-up of her marriage to [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Musical+Martine+aims+for+the+top%3b+Martine+McCutcheon+has+left+the+Vic...-a060363915| title=Musical Martine aims for the top| work = [[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|date=9 January 1999| accessdate = 30 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the storyline, Ruth had an affair with Mark's cousin [[Connor Flaherty]] ([[Seán Gleeson|Sean Gleeson]]), which left her pregnant.&lt;ref name="fulton"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fulton's+Vision%3b+Final+fling+for+whining+Ruth.-a060944484| title=Final fling for whining Ruth.| work = [[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|date=17 October 1998| accessdate = 30 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The character departed in February 1999 to be a single mother, with Paterson saying she was relieved to be leaving. At the time she commented, "I was doing EastEnders and being a mother.

You had to deal with the media and your social life was non-existent because you were so busy. I left because of my son. He made me realise the type of life I was leading.

==Reception==
In 1998, ''EastEnders'' featured a storyline where several of its characters visited France as part of a World Cup storyline. In the storyline, the character [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St Clement]]) was dressed in clothing with "[[Scotland]]" printed on it, to signify her support of the Scottish football team's participation in the tournament. An ''EastEnders'' spokeswoman said, "Pam is not Scottish but thinks she is descended from the Scots. She asked to wear the Scotland top and will be supporting Scotland." However, the use of Pat, a [[cockney]] character, as the Scottish supporter in this storyline instead of Ruth, whose actress is Scottish, provoked criticism from the media and the [[Tartan Army]] (a name given to fans of the Scotland national football team).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/PAMMED+OFF%3b+Tartan+Army+mock+EastEnders+stunt.-a060566070| title=PAMMED OFF; Tartan Army mock EastEnders stunt| work = [[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|date=3 June 1998| accessdate = 30 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rick Fulton of the ''Daily Record'' was critical of the character. He stated, "Unfortunately, because she's a Scottish actress in a prime-time soap, no one likes or cares about Ruth. She's a moaning pinched-faced bore whose voice can grate the neighbour's cheese. [...] She is the one character in British soap who is annoying for all the wrong reasons. She is no [[Nell Mangel|Mrs Mangel]] [from ''[[Neighbours]]]'' or Mrs Mack [from ''[[Take the High Road]]''], characters we love to hate. We just hate poor Ruth." He suggested that Ruth had very few "strong" storylines. He called for the character to be killed off so that she would not return again and stated that like viewers, Ruth's husband Mark "deserves a break, a nicer woman who doesn't make us Scots sound like moaning minnies."&lt;ref name="fulton"/&gt;

Actress Caroline Paterson was also critical of her character upon leaving, denouncing her as dreary and saying "Good riddance, Ruth."&lt;ref name="glad"/&gt;

The school grants bachelor's degrees in [[fine art]] and [[sculpture]], and [[Master's degree]]s in fine art.

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy.png|thumb|[[Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy]] and his Chinese secretary (1783–1859) portrait at the Sir J. J. School of Art]]

The School was founded in March 1857, named after [[Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy]], a businessman and philanthropist, who donated Rs. 100,000 for its endowment. Operations were managed by a committee headed by the Chief Justice of Bombay. The School's first class was in drawing, and began on 2 March 1857. Classes were held at the [[Elphinstone Institution]]. [[John Griffiths (artist)|John Griffiths]] became Principal of the School in 1865. He later became famous for copying the murals in the [[Ajanta Caves]] temple complex, a project which lasted from 1872 to 1891, and which the School's students assisted in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=224832 Art heritage, saved by sunshine law]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[Indian Express]]'', 2 March 2007. "...when the Public Works Department took up repainting of the building, the paintings had been shifted to the terrace and may have been washed out after the 26/7 deluge two years ago.(2005)"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, management of the school was taken over by the Government of India. Also in 1866, [[John Lockwood Kipling|Lockwood Kipling]], who had become a professor of the School in 1865, established three ''[[Wikt:atelier|ateliers]]'' for (i) Decorative Paintings, (ii) Modelling; and (iii) Ornamental Wrought Iron Work, and became its first dean. He was the father of the author [[Rudyard Kipling]], who was born on the School's campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-10-05/mumbai/27989345_1_kipling-house-bungalow-jsw-foundation Kipling house to become museum] ''[[Times of India]]', Oct 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, the school moved to its own building, where it is currently situated. The building was designed by architect George Twigge Molecey,&lt;ref name=bre&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-11-07/mumbai/27946139_1_stone-walls-restoration-heritage-buildings After years, Sir JJ School of Art begins to BREATHE] ''[[Times of India]]'', Nov 7, 2008. "Kipling House (Dean's Bungalow)The original cottage was brought down in the early 1900s and a new house built on the same spot."&lt;/ref&gt; in  [[neo Gothic]] architecture.&lt;ref name=tt&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-03-03/mumbai/27877604_1_art-world-bronze-bust-clay Celebrating 150 years] ''[[Times of India]]', 3 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The School campus, including the Kipling House, better known as the Dean's Bungalow, is classified as Grade II heritage structure by the Government of Maharashtra, and underwent a restoration in 2002-2006, and again in 2008.&lt;ref name=bre/&gt;

Drawing instruction as a subject was introduced in 1879 and a programme for training drawing teachers was started in 1893. In 1891 the Lord Reay Art Workshops (now known as the Department of Art-Crafts) were established.

===1900s===
The School had an important tradition in [[architecture]]. In 1900. the School offered its first course in architecture, taught by [[John Begg]], later Consulting Architect of Bombay and of the Government of India. A complete 4-year programme was established in 1908 under Begg's assistant [[George Wittet]]. In 1917, architect [[Claude Batley]] became a visiting professor; he was Principal of the School from 1923 to 1943, and is commemorated in the Claude Batley Architectural Gallery for architectural exhibitions, opened in 1996.

In 1896, the Draughtsman's classes, the nucleus of the Department of Architecture, were added. This Department was later organised for a 3 years Diploma Course which was duly recognised by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects|R.I.B.A. Board]].

In 1910, the [[George Clarke, 1st Baron Sydenham of Combe|Sir George Clarke]] Studies and Laboratories were built for the advanced study of crafts, pottery being the first craft taken up for study. In 1929, the head of the School was renamed "Director", and in 1935, the Department of Commercial Art was also started.

In 1937 [[M.R. Acharekar]] was appointed deputy director and continued his tenure till 1939. Shri. V. S. Adurkar was the first Indian head of the school, succeeding [[Claude Batley]] as Director in 1943.

===Post-independence===
In 1958, the school was divided, with the Departments of Architecture and Applied Art becoming the [[Sir J. J. College of Architecture]] and [[Sir J.J. Institute of Applied Art]] respectively.

In 1981, the School became affiliated with the [[University of Mumbai]].

'''Timurid art''' is a style of art originating during the rule of the [[Timurid Empire]] (1370-1507). Timurid art was noted for its usage of both [[Persian art|Persian]] and [[Chinese art|Chinese]] styles, as well as for taking influence from the art of other civilizations in [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/timu/hd_timu.htm|title=The Art of the Timurid Period (ca. 1370–1507) {{!}} Essay {{!}} Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|last=Komaroff|first=Authors: Suzan Yalman, Linda|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the decline of the Timurid Empire, the art of the civilization continued to influence other cultures in [[Western Asia|West]] and Central Asia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== History ==
The Timurid Empire was established by [[Timor the Lame]] in 1370 after the conquest of the various [[Ilkhanate]] successor states. After conquering a city, the Timurids commonly spared the lives of the local artisans and deported them to the Timurid capital of [[Samarkand]]. After the Timurids conquered [[Persia]] in the early 15th century, many Persian artistic traits became interwoven with existing [[Mongol art]]. Timor the Lame's conversion to [[Islam]] later in life made Samarkand one of the centers of [[Islamic art]]. In the mid 15th century the empire moved its capital to [[Herat]], which became a focal point for Timurid art. As with Samarkand, Persian artisans and intellectuals soon established Herat as a center for arts and culture. Soon, many of the Timurids adopted [[Persian Culture|Persian culture]] as their own.&lt;ref&gt;B.F. Manz; W.M. Thackston; D.J. Roxburgh; L. Golombek; L. Komaroff; R.E. Darley-Doran (2007). "Timurids". Encyclopedia of Islam, online edition. &lt;q&gt;During the Timurid period, three languages, Persian, Turkish, and Arabic were in use. The major language of the period was Persian, the native language of the Tajik (Persian) component of society and the language of learning acquired by all literate and/or urban Turks. Persian served as the language of administration, history, belles lettres, and poetry.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illustration ===
Timurid art absorbed and improved upon the traditional Persian concept of the "Arts of the Book". The new, Timurid-inflected works of art saw illustrated [[paper]] (as opposed to [[parchment]]) manuscripts produced by the empire's artists. These illustrations were notable for their rich colors and elaborate designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artarena.force9.co.uk/timurid.htm|title=Iransaga - Persian Art, The Timurids|website=www.artarena.force9.co.uk|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the quality of the miniature paintings found in these manuscripts, [[Suzan Yalman]] of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] noted that "the Herat school [of manuscript painting] is often regarded as the [[apogee]] of Persian painting."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Painting was not limited to manuscripts, as many Timurid artists also created intricate [[Mural|wall paintings]]. Many of these wall paintings depicted landscapes derived from both Persian and Chinese artistic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;"Timurids" ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'' (Sixth ed.). New York City: [[Columbia University]]. Retrieved 2006-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt; While the subject matter of these paintings was borrowed from other cultures, Timurid wall paintings were eventually refined into their own, unique style.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, W. Thomas. ''Dynastic Imagery in Early Timurid Wall Paintings''. Los Angeles Museum of Art.

Pelican History of Art, {{ISBN|0300064659}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metalwork, ceramics, and carving ===
The Timurid Empire also produced quality pieces of metalwork. [[Steel]], [[iron]], [[brass]], and [[bronze]] were commonly used as mediums.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/metalwork|title=METALWORK – Encyclopaedia Iranica|last=electricpulp.com|website=www.iranicaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timurid silver-[[Inlay|inlaid]] steel is often being cited as being of particularly high quality.&lt;ref&gt;The Caspian Sea Journal ISSN: 1578-7899 Volume 10, Issue 1, Supplement 3 (2016) 127-132 The Compilation of One Object of Timurid Metalwork (12th Century) in the National Museum of Iran with Two Objects in National Museum of Yerevan-Armenia.

URL: http://csjonline.org/CSJ/2016/Supp3/127-132.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Following the collapse of the Timurid Empire, several Iranian and Mesopotamian cultures co-opted Timurid metalwork.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Chinese-style [[Pottery|ceramics]] were produced by Timurid artisans. [[Jade|Jade carving]] also had some presence in Timurid art.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Legacy ===
Following the decline of the Timurid Empire in the late 15th century, the [[Ottomans]], [[Safavid dynasty]], and [[Mughal Empire]] co-opted Timurid artistic traditions into their own.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.davidmus.dk/en/collections/islamic/dynasties/timurids-and-turkmen|title=The Timurids and the Turkmen - The David Collection|website=www.davidmus.dk|language=en|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Tokyo Junior Orchestra Society''' (東京ジュニアオーケストラソサエティー) was established in April 1994 by Fuminori “Maro” Shinozaki, the Principal Concertmaster of the [[NHK Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bunkyocivichall.jp/play_detail?id=1032 |title=東京ジュニアオーケストラソサエティ第15回定期演奏会 &amp;#124; 公演･イベント情報 &amp;#124; 響きの森文京公会堂 文京シビックホール |publisher=Bunkyocivichall.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tjos.jp/file/aboutus.html |title=東京ジュニアオーケストラとは |publisher=Tjos.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orchestra members are instructed by members of professional orchestras and university instructors, including some former members of TJOS.

Most members are currently enrolled in pre-collegiate music programs, contributing to its reputation as one of the most selective youth orchestras in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = 音楽で猛暑を涼しく|last = |first = |date = |work = Tokyo Shinbun Newspaper|access-date = |via = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = 東京ジュニアオーケストラソサエティー|last = |first = |date = |journal = サラサーテ |volume=24 |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = 時代を超えて音楽を継承していくために|last = |first = |date = |work = フンカ|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prospective members must pass auditions held throughout the year.

Past performances include a performance of Chopin’s Piano Concerto no.1 with [[Aimi Kobayashi]] which was broadcast on television in 2010, joint concerts with the [[NHK Symphony Orchestra]], were also broadcast on television, and the [[California Youth Symphony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.to-on.com/artistpromotion/news/20101220174831/ |title=NHK BS番組「みんなのショパン」再放送決定！（小林愛実）｜アーティスト・プロモーション事業部｜株式会社東音企画 |publisher=To-on.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its motto is "interplay", in which members interact to form a tightly knit ensemble and "society", which is reflected in its name.

Tokyo Junior Orchestra Society was accredited by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government as an endorsed NPO in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.npo-homepage.go.jp/Portal/corpDetail!show.action?no=013007903|title = ＮＰＯ法人の詳細情報|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.npo-homepage.go.jp/about/houjin-info/shokatsunintei-meibo/pref-tokyo|title = 認定・仮認定NPO法人名簿(東京都)|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been awarded a Distinguished Visiting Professorship by Shanghai Municipality in Shanghai.

==Biography==
Cohen's education consists of a M.A. from the [[University of Chicago]] in [[Comparative Literature]] and a Ph.D. from [[Yale University]] in Comparative Literature. Thus Cohen’s work began in [[literary theory]] and cultural politics but he has then explored as a [[philosopher]] areas of [[critical theory]], cinema studies, [[digital media]] and [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albany.edu/english/cohen_t.php] Tom Cohen – Cultural and Media Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10255">'''Website localization''' is the process of adapting an existing website to local language and culture in the [[target market]].&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2004/10/08/culture-and-website-localization|title=Culture and Website Localization|last=Payne|first=Neil|date=8 October 2004|work=[[WebProNews]]|accessdate=29 November 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uaaxzK3s|archivedate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the process of adapting a website into a different linguistic and cultural context&lt;ref name=SANDRINI&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sandrini|first=Peter|title=Website Localization and Translation|journal=MuTra 2005 – Challenges of Multidimensional Translation: Conference Proceedings|series=EU-High-Level Scientific Conference Series|issue=131-138|url=http://www.translationconcepts.org/pdf/MuTra_2005_Proceedings.pdf#page=135|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;— involving much more than the simple translation of text. This modification process must reflect specific language and cultural preferences in the content, images and overall design and requirements of the site – all while maintaining the integrity of the website.  Culturally adapted web sites reduce the amount of required cognitive efforts from visitors of the site to process information, making navigation easier and attitudes toward the web site more favorable.&lt;ref name="Shneor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shneor|first=Rotem|date=2014-02-28|title=Influences of culture, geography, and infrastructure on website localization|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1034102170?accountid=14667|journal=Cross Cultural Management|volume=19|issue=3|pages=352–374|access-date=2017-12-06|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modification of the website must additionally take into consideration the stated purpose of the new website with a focus on the targeted audience/market in the new locale.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI/&gt; Website localization aims to customize a website so that it seems "natural", to its viewers despite cultural differences between the creators and the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shneor|first=Rodem|title=Influences of culture, geography and infrastructure on website localization decisions|journal=Cross Cultural Management: An International Journal|date=2012|volume=19|issue=3|pages=352–374|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=17047475|accessdate=19 March 2014|doi=10.1108/13527601211247099}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two factors are involved—programming expertise and linguistic/cultural knowledge.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt;

The proliferation of website localization is the result of the popularity of computer and Internet users. People all over the world treat the Internet as their main location for information and services. These people do not all speak the same language. As a result, website localization has become one of the primary tools for business global expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Website Localization|url=https://asianabsolute.co.uk/website-localization|publisher=Asian Absolute|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to website communication across multiple cultures for multiple needs, the Internet has given way to non professional translation practices. Because website localization involves mixed strategies, organizations tend to maintain a global image while using website localization to appeal to local users.&lt;ref name="Pym"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199239306.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199239306-e-028|title = Oxford Handbooks|last=Pym|first=Anthony|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge of website localization has become even more important as websites increasingly have the potential to both supplement and replace presence in foreign markets.  As web design becomes more congruent with national culture, it will foster online consumer purchasing.&lt;ref name="Shneor"/&gt; Creators take into account the "language, education level, belief and value systems, [and] traditions and habits" of the target culture in order to optimize results.&lt;ref name=Shneor /&gt;

==Process==
Website localization is more than mere [[translation]].&lt;ref name="Tan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-08-06/business/0108060190_1_localization-translation-web-sites|title=Translators go beyond language as Web sites cross borders|last=Tan|first=Shannon|date=6 August 2001|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|accessdate=29 November 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uabN4muG|archivedate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translating only solves partial language problems. Measurement units must be converted; images and text are modified to appeal to the target culture.&lt;ref name="Tan"/&gt;

The process of website localization is complex and involves three different levels of adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Localization?|url=http://www.gx-localizations.com/about.asp|publisher=GX Localizations|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First is translation. Website localization involves adapting any text being used into the language of the country. It is important that translation of information be “clear and understandable” to avoid cultural misunderstanding or offense.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt; In order to translate, the "target culture" must be known.&lt;ref name="Stanley 1999 127–129"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=John|title=SIGDOC '99 Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Computer documentation|year=1999|publisher=ACM|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-58113-072-4|pages=127–129|url=http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/320000/318569/p127-stanley.pdf?ip=141.213.236.110&amp;id=318569&amp;acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&amp;key=B5D9E165A72B697C%2E0A17827594E6F2C8%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&amp;CFID=419590667&amp;CFTOKEN=40207095&amp;__acm__=1394480330_f23b71ce60f010c26de5d84eebbfbb5b}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Second is the actual localization, which includes translation but also involves all other efforts and activities to ensure that the adaptation of textual materials, visual displays, illustrations and graphics are “linguistically and culturally appropriate for the target locale.” &lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt; Target locale is understood as the “[[Market segmentation|market segment]] defined by criteria including language, currency, and perhaps educational level or income bracket.” &lt;ref name=PYM&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pym|first=Anthony|title=Website localization|year=2011|url=http://usuaris.tinet.cat/apym/on-line/translation/2009_website_localization.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many technical elements which can be localized are: date and time formats, currency formats, number formats, address and telephone number formats, units of measure and connection speed.&lt;ref name=PYM /&gt; In order to ensure effective communication during the localization process, it is important to consider the following items: [[information architecture]], theme and navigation, [[graphics]], photographs, audio, and visual.&lt;ref name="Stanley 1999 127–129"/&gt; Third is [[Internationalization and localization|internationalization]], which involves making sure that the software being used is fully compatible with the technology of the country in question.

There are two important considerations to keep in mind during the process of website localization. The first is to focus on the demands of the user.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt; The readers of the “localized version of the website” want to be able to read and understand the pages in a way that makes sense to them.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt;  A second consideration is to take into account the goals of the client, whether an institution, government or individual, for example.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt;

==Backend localization==
Many elements of a website that are different according to the locale of the client need only minor manual changes by a localizer, or none at all. For example, the system on which the website is created should automatically produce the correct currency symbol based on the country in which the client is located.&lt;ref name=LAKO&gt;{{cite web|last=Lako|first=Cristian|title=The Elements of the Website Localizations Process|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1321921734/abstract?accountid=14667|work=Studia Universitatis Petru Major. Philogia|publisher=Universitatea Petru Maior|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Website Analytics Software:&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt; This software can be created once generally, and then applied to each of the localized domains.
* Site Search: Results can be reviewed using an algorithm that sifts through possible results using [[metadata]]. For example, a consumer who makes a query in the United States should not be shown a good that can only be purchased in Portugal.&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt;
* Testimonials: Comments and feedback are often a vital part of a website. Localization efforts usually only include censorship. This can be done largely by software, however human review is sometimes necessary.&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt;
* Information Storage: [[Databases]] are often used to store large amounts of information. They can be used to store generic data, like product information, as well as more specific information pertaining to certain locales.&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt;

==The business of website localization==
Using website localization to its best advantage is vital to any business seeking to move into international markets. With more and more companies seeking to tap into these lucrative markets, website localization has become quite profitable.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt;  The business side involves global and local coordination; production and operations, including finance; sales and marketing; language translation, including technology and linguistic coordination; software engineering, as well as design.&lt;ref name=PYM /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wandrianne|first=Dias|title=The Business Behind Translation|url=http://www.ccaps.net/blog/the-business-behind-translation/|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The higher the technological abilities of the target culture, the more likely it is for website localization to be implemented and used effectively.&lt;ref name=Shneor /&gt;
