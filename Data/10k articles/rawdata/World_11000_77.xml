The '''1960s in Angola''' were marked by the [[Angolan War of Independence|War of Independence]] (1961–1975). Portuguese police arrested [[Agostinho Neto]] of the MPLA and future President of Angola (1975–1979) in 1960 for the third time.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite book|last=Jessup|first=John E.|year=1998|title=An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Conflict and Conflict Resolution, 1945-1996|pages=518–519}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates discussed [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]]'s [[self-determination]] in relation to Angola at the 4th Commission of the [[United Nations]] on [[Decolonization]] in [[New York City|New York]] in 1962. Cabinda became a member of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) as the 39th colonized country in 1964.&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite book|last=Mullen|first=J. Atticus Ryan|author2=Christopher A.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Angola}}
Angola's industries grew by an annual average rate of 17% in the 1960s as ethnic Europeans seized natives' lands and increased mineral production. Mineral exports doubled between 1965 and 1970 to 170 million pounds. In the district of [[Huambo]], between 1968 and 1970 white-owned land more than doubled from 249,039 hectares to 526,270 hectares. Native-owned land decreased by 36.5%. The average African farm's gross income declined between 1964 and 1970 from $98.00 to $35.00&lt;ref name=c&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Desmond J.|year=1975|title=The Cambridge History of Africa|pages=772}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[petroleum]]-production began in [[Congo basin]] in the 1960s, and in the [[exclave]] of Cabinda in 1968. Now the [[petroleum industry]] is the engine of the [[Angolan economy]].&lt;ref name=d&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Angola/pdf.pdf Angola] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926035705/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Angola/pdf.pdf |date=2007-09-26 }} Energy Information Administration&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=e&gt;{{cite book|last=Tvedten|first=Inge|year=1997|title=Angola: Struggle for Peace and Reconstruction|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Date With Luyu''''' (also spelled '''''A Date With Lu Yu''''') ({{zh|s=鲁豫有约|t=魯豫有約|p=Lǔyù Yǒu Yuē}}) is a popular [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] television [[talk show]] that airs on [[Phoenix Television]]. Because the show emulates the success and format of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', its host and creator, [[Chen Luyu]], has been called "China's Oprah". The show includes a studio audience of about 300. The show covers a wide range of issues: interviewees range from artists and musicians such as [[Li Yundi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoenixtv-distribution.com/products/detail/92/92/10/pcategory:10/lang:eng Li Yundi, The Pianist Legend] Phoenix website&lt;/ref&gt; business leaders such as [[Robin Li]], diplomatic figures such as Gary Locke (the first U.S. Ambassador to China of Chinese ancestry)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoenixtv-distribution.com/products/detail/305/305/10/pcategory:10/lang:eng Mr. &amp; Mrs. Locke - The China Dream of the U.S Ambassador to China] Phoenix TV Website&lt;/ref&gt; academics such as Prof Michael Dobson&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/edacs/departments/shakespeare/news/2012/Shakespeare-Institute-has-A-Date-with-Lu-Yu.aspx Shakespeare Institute has 'A Date with Lu Yu'] Shakespeare Institute website 5-July-2012&lt;/ref&gt; and sports figures such as [[Shane Battier]].  She is also willing to address controversial subjects.

It is noted that some interviews are conducted in English, with Chinese subtitles, as was the cases when Lu Yu interviewed [[Wentworth Miller]], [[Nick Vujicic]], and [[Hillary Clinton]] with [[Timothy Geithner]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2010/05/25/clinton-and-geithner-on-a-date-with-luyu/ WSJ Blog ]&lt;/ref&gt; Audience members are required to understand English in these instances, because Lu Yu has warned about problems with interviews being done entirely in a single language, i.e. [[Mandarin Chinese]]

Luyu averages 140 million viewers per show.

'''Atlantic Bird''' was a series of satellites operated by [[Eutelsat]] over the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. In 2012 the series was merged into Eutelsat's main fleet as part of the company's rebranding. 

Two of the original three satellites replaced the [[France Telecom]] [[Telecom 2]] satellites which Eutelsat had acquired in 1999. Five satellites were in operation as of 2006:
*[[Atlantic Bird 1]], operating at 12.5°W
*[[Atlantic Bird 2]], operating at 8°W (Replaced [[Telecom 2A]])
*[[Eutelsat 5 West A|Atlantic Bird 3]], a [[Spacebus]] 3000B3, operating at 5°W (Replaced [[Telecom 2C]])
*[[Atlantic Bird 4]], operated at 7°W (Formerly [[Hot Bird]] 4, also known as [[Nilesat]] 103)
*[[Atlantic Bird 7]], operating at 7°W

'''Barbara Wienecke''' {{postnominals|country=AUS|AAM}} is a Senior Research Scientist with the [[Australian Antarctic Division]]. She is a [[seabird]] ecologist who uses satellite tracking to investigate seabird [[population dynamics]] and [[ecology]]. Wienecke has played a key role in enhancing the quality of, and overseeing the implementation of, a number of [[Antarctic Specially Protected Area]] management plans for wildlife concentrations in [[East Antarctica]].

==Early life and education==
Wienecke was born in [[Namibia]] but graduated from high school in [[Germany]]. After travelling and living in a number of different countries, including [[Israel]] and the [[Netherlands]], she moved to [[Australia]] to begin her bachelor's degree.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/magazine/2011-2015/issue-25-december-2013/science/penguin-barb|title=Penguin Barb|website=www.antarctica.gov.au|language=en-au|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has a Bachelor of Science degree from [[Murdoch University]], where she completed an honours thesis on the penguins of [[Penguin Island (Western Australia)|Penguin Island]], Western Australia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This research led into a PhD from [[Murdoch University]] in Perth, Australia, which she completed in 1993.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Career and impact==
Wienecke is a seabird ecologist at the [[Australian Antarctic Division]] (AAD), where she has worked since 1993.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/australia-in-antarctica/australian-antarctic-medal/recipients/2013/barbara-wienecke|title=Barbara Wienecke Antarctic Medal recipient|date=2013|website=www.antarctica.gov.au|language=en-au|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been studying penguins and other seabirds for over twenty-five years,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; participating in over fifteen expeditions to [[Antarctica]] and the [[Subantarctic|sub-Antarctic islands]]. Her first expedition was an overwintering expedition to Australia's [[Mawson Station]] in 1994, during which she was employed as a seabird ecologist conducting a field program on emperor penguins at [[Auster Glacier|Auster]] and [[Taylor Glacier]] for fourteen months.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Wienecke is primarily interested in the foraging ecology and population dynamics of seabirds, using satellite tracking to conduct research geared toward protecting seabirds and their habitat from humans and climate change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-02/studies-of-ancient-penguin-populations-concern-climate-change/6273412|title=Study of ancient emperor penguin colonies stokes climate change fears|date=2015-03-02|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also has collaborated on research mitigating the incidental bycatch of seabirds in commercial longline fisheries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This work has directly contributed to the [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources|Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] (CCAMLR) conservation measures,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/news/2013/science-and-the-sea-capture-2013-antarctic-medals|title=Science and the sea capture 2013 Antarctic medals|website=www.antarctica.gov.au|language=en-au|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to a major reduction of bycatch in pelagic long-line fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/magazine/2011-2015/issue-27-december-2014/science/instant-sinking-hooks-will-save-seabirds-in-tuna-longline-fisheries/a-life-dedicated-to-saving-seabirds|title=A life dedicated to saving seabirds|website=www.antarctica.gov.au|language=en-au|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barthelmarktzelt2005gross.jpg|thumb|Beer tent]]
The '''Barthelmarkt''' is an annual [[Volksfest]] ([[beer festival]] and [[travelling funfair]]) in [[Manching]], near [[Ingolstadt]], [[Germany]]. It is held on the last weekend of August and lasts four days. Every year, about 250.000 people visit it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.onetz.de/deutschland-und-die-welt-r/lokales/geselligkeitsclub-hogerer-knuepfen-kontakte-bei-audi-und-am-barthelmarkt-mit-eslarner-showband-im-hotel-d30189.html|title=Geselligkeitsclub "Hogerer" knüpfen Kontakte - Bei Audi und am Barthelmarkt: Mit "Eslarner Showband" im Hotel|last=Tag|first=Medienhaus Der Neue|website=onetz.de|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though first mentioned in 1354, its roots can be traced back as early as to the 1st century BC, when the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] established a cattle market in the area.

The name "Barthelmarkt" stems from [[St. Bartholomew]], the patron saint of the local church.&lt;ref&gt;Donaukurier.de Newsjournal, 08.26.2015: [http://www.donaukurier.de/themen/barthelmarkt/art351906,3113920 ''Warum der Barthelmarkt "Barthelmarkt" heißt]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brandenburgisches Landeshauptarchiv - Logografie.png|thumb|Logo of the BLHA]]
The '''Brandenburgisches Landeshauptarchiv''' (Brandenburgian State Main Archive; acronym BLHA) is the central state archive for the State (Land) of [[Brandenburg]]. It is located in [[Potsdam]].

Records cover the Land of Brandenburg and its predecessors, back to the 10th century.

==History==
[[File:Potsdamer Orangerie.jpg|thumb|The [[Orangery Palace]], eastern wing, where the BLHA used premises between 1949 and 2010.]] It was founded as the Brandenburgian Provincial Archive (Brandenburgisches Provinzialarchiv) in 1883. The then [[Province of Brandenburg]] was the only [[Provinces of Prussia|Prussian province]] without a provincial archive, since the [[Prussian Privy State Archives]] fulfilled the task of archivation for Brandenburg, being the core province of Prussia. The provincial archive was renamed as ''State Archive for the Province of Brandenburg and the Reich Capital Berlin'' (Staatsarchiv für die Provinz Brandenburg und die Reichshauptstadt Berlin) in 1931, reflecting the fact, that formerly Brandenburgian Berlin formed as [[Greater Berlin]] a province-like political and territorial entity separate of Brandenburg.

On 21 June 1949 Brandenburg's minister of the interior, {{ill|Bruno Lentzsch|de}}, again renamed the archive as the ''State Archive of Brandenburg'' (Landesarchiv Brandenburg), with divided Berlin running separate archives. The archive received its current name in 1951, however after the dissolution of the State of Brandenburg in 1952, along with all the states in East Germany, the term Brandenburg was skipped from its name to ''Potsdam State Archive'' (Staatsarchiv Potsdam) for the years 1965 to 1991, since being known again as the BLHA. Since the Archive's premises in the [[Orangery Palace]] were too small, the holdings were sparsed over several other places too, until they were all united in the Archive's new building in the quarter of [[Golm (Potsdam)|Golm]], opening on 1 March 2016 its gates to the users.

The '''Brnjica culture''' ({{lang-sr|Брњица}}, full name: '''''Donja Brnjica-Gornja Stražava cultural group''''') is an archaeological culture in present-day [[Serbia]] dating from 1400 BC.&lt;ref name=SCIN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0350-0241/2006/0350-02410656073S.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723055300/http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0350-0241/2006/0350-02410656073S.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural group formed out of this culture are the '''[[Moesi]]''', a [[Daco]]-[[Thracian]] tribe formed in the [[Roman province]] of [[Moesia]] (ethnonym) of present-day central Serbia.&lt;ref name=SCIN/&gt; It is also the non-[[Illyrians|Illyrian]] component in the [[Dardani]]an ethnogenesis.&lt;ref name=SCIN/&gt;

The culture is characterized by several groups:&lt;ref name=SCIN/&gt;
* Kosovo with Raska and Pester
* South and West Morava confluence zone
* Leskovac-Nis
* South Morava-Pcinja-Upper Vardar

Brnjica type pottery has been found in Blageovgrad, Plovdiv, and a number of sites in [[Pelagonia]], Lower Vardar, the island of Thasos and [[Thessaly]] dating to 13th and 12th century BC.&lt;ref name=SCIN/&gt;

==Sites==

===Hisar===
{{main|Hisar Hill}}
Hisar is a multi-periodal settlement.

Traces of life of the Brnjica culture (8th century BC) is seen in the plateau that was protected by a deep moat with a palisade on its inner side, a fortification similar to that of another fortification on the Gradac site in Lanište in the [[Velika Morava]] basin.&lt;ref&gt;Stojic 1986, 61–62. YU&lt;/ref&gt;

A later Iron Age settlement existed at Hisar dating from the 6th century BC until the 4th century BC. Besides Greek fibulae and pottery, [[Triballi]] (Thracian) tombs have been excavated in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2005&amp;mm=07&amp;dd=26&amp;nav_id=173384&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cabbage roll''' is a dish consisting of cooked [[cabbage]] leaves wrapped around a variety of [[stuffing|fillings]]. It is common to the cuisines of the [[Balkans]], [[Central Europe|Central]], [[Northern Europe|Northern]], [[Eastern Europe]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Iran]], as well as [[West Asia]] and [[Northern China]].

[[Meat]] fillings are traditional in Europe, often [[beef]], [[lamb (food)|lamb]], or [[pork]] seasoned with [[garlic]], [[onion]], and [[spice]]s. [[Cereal|Grains]] such as [[rice]] and [[barley]], [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[edible mushroom|mushrooms]], and [[vegetable]]s are often included. Pickled cabbage leaves are often used for wrapping, particularly in Southeastern Europe. In Asia, seafoods, tofu, and [[shiitake mushroom]] may also be used.  [[Chinese cabbage]] is often used as a wrapping.

Cabbage leaves are stuffed with the filling which are then [[baking|baked]], [[simmering|simmered]], or [[steaming|steamed]] in a covered pot and generally eaten warm, often accompanied with a [[sauce]]. The sauce varies widely by cuisine. Always in Sweden and sometimes in Finland, stuffed cabbage is served with [[lingonberry jam]], which is both sweet and tart. In Eastern Europe, [[tomato]]-based sauces or plain sour cream are typical. In Lebanon, it is a popular plate, where the cabbage is stuffed with rice and minced meat and only rolled to the size of cigar. It is usually served with a side of [[yogurt]] and a type of lemon and olive oil [[vinaigrette]] seasoned with garlic and dried mint.

Popular among Europeans, and traditionally served among the Jewish on [[Simchat Torah]], stuffed cabbage is described by [[Gil Marks]] to have entered Jewish cooking some 2,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Lavine"&gt;{{cite news|author=Eileen M.

====Azerbaijan====
[[File:Kalam dolmasi Azerbaijan.jpg|thumb|right| Azerbaijani Cabbage roll, {{lang-az|Kələm dolması }}]]
Stuffed cabbage leaves ({{lang-az|Kələm dolması }}) are popular all year round in Azerbaijan, but especially in the winter months when other vegetables are less available. The stuffing usually consists of rice and herbs such as coriander, mint and dill, onions and meat, although there is a variation – yalanchi (fake) [[dolma]], which is meat-free.&lt;ref&gt;Azerbaijani Cuisine — National Tourism Promotion Bureau, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Romania and Moldova====

[[File:Sarmale în dovleac (crude).jpg|thumb|Romanian sarmale cooked inside a pumpkin]]
Sarmale are Romanian stuffed cabbage rolls traditionally served on [[Christmas]] and [[New Year's Eve]] but also served throughout the year at weddings, baptism parties, and other large celebrations. Ground pork is mixed with sauteed caramelized onions and rice stuffed in a cabbage leaf, pickled sauerkraut leaf or grape leaf. For flavor, they usually consist of layers with smoked pork fat, smoked ribs, or smoked sausage.

The Romanian [[sarmale]] is a versatile dish, and the best way of consuming is reheated the next day. The flavor is different with an enhanced flavor. It can be prepared with a tomato base, dill base or combination. Sweet shredded cabbage layers in between the rolls of pickled cabbage leaves or [[sauerkraut]] layers in between of sweet cabbage leaves. The taste is significant different but  still a great dish.

====Poland====
{{main|Gołąbki}}
Stuffed cabbage rolls are the epitome of Polish nourishment. Pork and beef mixed with rice or barley are nestled in a cabbage leaf and cooked in the oven or on the stove until tender.

[[File:00101 Rindfleisch - Kohlroulade, Podkarpackie.JPG|thumb|Gołąbki in tomato sauce]]

Poles call them ''gołąbki'', which literally means "little pigeons". For Czechs and Slovaks, it's holubky, while Serbs and Croatians refer to them as sarma. Usually, the sauce is what sets them apart.
There's also a less popular version called ''leniwe gołąbki'' (lazy cabbage rolls) in which ingredients are chopped, combined together and baked or fried.

====Ukraine====
[[File:Golubtci 025.jpg|thumb|Holubtsi stuffed with buckwheat groats, served with [[Smetana (dairy product)|smetana]]]]
[[File:Golubci8.jpg|thumb|Holubtsi stuffed with rice and meat mixture]]
[[File:כרוב ממולא.jpg|thumb|Jewish ''holishkes'' are similar to Ukrainian ''holubtsi'' and Polish ''gołąbki'']]
In Ukraine, the filling of ''holubtsi'' varies throughout the country. In the [[Carpathian]] region corn grits are used, whereas in the [[Poltava]] area [[buckwheat]] groats are preferred. The cereal is lightly cooked, mixed with fried [[onions]], shkvarky ([[pork cracklings]]) or raw minced meat. The mixture is combined with spices and seasonings, and is then used as the filling for steamed fresh or pickled cabbage leaves. In spring cabbage leaves are often replaced with fresh [[beetroot]] leaves, and in the southwest – with fresh young grape leaves. The ''holubtsi'' are lightly fried and then stewed with tomato, mushroom sour cream or some other sauce. During Lenten periods this might be water mixed with kvas, while at other times it might be a meat broth.

In [[Left Bank Ukraine]] and in the south, ''holubtsi'' are usually big, made from the entire cabbage leaf, while in the [[Dniester]] region and the [[Carpathians]] the cabbage leaf is divided into several pieces. In the latter regions, cooks who made large holubtsi were considered lazy. In Poltava cooks preferred the large holubtsi because they were juicier. In most of Ukraine holubtsi were an everyday dish, but in most of [[Right Bank Ukraine]], with the exception of [[Polissia]], they were also included in holiday meals.   Beginning in the 1920s, holubtsi began to be stuffed with a rice-meat mixture, and, instead of kvas, they began to be cooked in tomato juice, sauce or paste. This is the most common way they are prepared nowadays.

Holubtsi are a popular dish for both everyday meal and as special occasion treat. For [[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecheria]] (Christmas Eve Supper) in many regions of Ukraine holubtsi constitute one of the twelve traditional dishes served on the night. Only Lenten ingredients are used in this case.&lt;ref&gt;Yakovenko, Svitlana 2016, '''''[http://sovabooks.com.au/tradition-on-a-plate-ukrainian-christmas-eve-supper/ Ukrainian Christmas Eve Supper: Traditional village recipes for Sviata Vecheria']'''', Sova Books, Sydney&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faryna, Natalka (Ed.) 1976, '''''Ukrainian Canadiana''''', Ukrainian Women's Association of Canada, Edmonton&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion of [[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecheria]], Boykos and Transcarpathians make Holubtsi from "kryzhavky" (pickled whole heads of cabbage). Into these "pickled" holubtsi they put a stuffing of rice and mushrooms. Carpathian-style holubtsi are usually made from fresh cabbage and stuffed with corn grits, or with grated raw potato (Vorokhta, Verkhovyna, Kvasy). These are best served with mushroom gravy.  To differentiate the different types of holubtsi, they are wrapped into different shapes: corn-filled ones are made into the shape of envelopes, with the edges folded in, potato-filled are simply rolled up. A classic Halychan (Galician) dish Sviat Vechir dish is holubtsi stuffed with grated potato and served with a mushroom machanka (dipping sauce).

==== Hungary====

The traditional Hungarian cabbage roll (töltött káposzta) can be made from pickled cabbage leaves, filled with minced pork meat. The Hungarian version often contains minced pepper ([[paprika]]) and is served with [[sour cream]] on top. Hungarians serve this food during the periods of time near Christmas and New Year's, but stuffed cabbage also belongs to the traditional pig slaughter.

====Nordics====
[[File:Kåldolmar.jpg|thumb|Kåldolmar]]
[[File:Wirsingroulade.jpg|thumb|German ''Wirsingrouladen'' made using [[savoy cabbage]] leaves]]
Kåldolmar are [[Swedish cuisine|Swedish]] cabbage rolls filled with minced [[pork]] and in some cases [[rice]]. They are usually eaten with boiled or mashed [[potato]]es, [[gravy]], and [[lingonberry]] jam. Kåldolmar are also popular in Denmark and in [[Finland]], where they are known in Finnish as kaalikääryle (plural kaalikääryleet).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntu-comenius.se/Sweden%20Html%20files/kaldolmar.htm Kåldolmar recipe], Nature Teaches Us: A Comenius Project&lt;/ref&gt;

The dish is considered a variety of the [[dolma]], common in Eastern [[Mediterranean]] countries. After losing the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709 [[Charles XII of Sweden]] fled to the city of [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]], in [[Moldavia]], then controlled by his ally, the Sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Charles XII spent more than five years in the Ottoman Empire, trying to convince the Sultan to help him defeat the Russians. When he finally returned to Sweden in 1715, he was followed by some of the Ottoman creditors from whom he had borrowed money to finance his wars. The creditors lived in [[Stockholm]] until 1732, and during this time it is most likely that the dolma was introduced in Sweden.

The first known Swedish recipe for Oriental dolmas was included in a famous Swedish [[cookbook]] written by [[Cajsa Warg]], in 1765. At the end of the recipe, Ms Warg suggested that those who could not afford vine leaves could use preboiled cabbage leaves in their place.

In Sweden "Kåldolmens dag" (Day of the Cabbage Roll) is celebrated on November 30, the day of the death of [[Charles XII of Sweden]]. It was instated in 2010 as a reaction to the recent rise in anti-immigration views by showing the purported long history of a multifaceted Swedish cultural heritage, involving national symbols with international background. It is arranged by "Kåldolmens vänner" (Friends of the Cabbage Roll).

Nowadays, frozen "Kåldolmar" are sold in most big food stores.

====Russia====
The Russian version of cabbage rolls usually consists of mincemeat mixed with cooked rice or  buckwheat wrapped in cabbage leaves and stewed in a mixture of sour cream and tomato sauce. In order to save time there is another variation of that dish called ''lenivye golubtsy'' (lazy cabbage rolls). In that case, the cabbage is chopped and mixed with mincemeat and rice so there is no need to wrap every meatball in a cabbage leaf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rbth.ru/articles/2009/10/28/281009_golubtsy.html The ultimate Russian comfort food], October 28, 2009, [[Russia Beyond the Headlines]]e&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia====
{{main|Sarma (food)|l1=Sarma}}
Cabbage rolls are a staple diet of the population in [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]]. Leaves of brined cabbage stuffed with ground beef with rice is a favorite during Christmastime and other non fasting holy days, while meat is omitted or substituted with crushed walnuts on fasting holy days. Traditionally cabbage rolls are simmered long in a paprika based sauce with chunks of smoked bacon.

===The Levant===
In the [[Levant]], namely [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and [[Jordan]], cabbage rolls are called محشي ملفوف Malfoof mahshi. Traditionally the cabbage rolls consist of meat and rice but have vegetarian variants oftentimes cooked as part of a [[Lenten]] menu. Local traditions vary between cooking the rolls in a tomato sauce or in a lemon brine.

===North Africa===

====Egypt====
[[File:Mahshi koromb.jpg|thumb|Mahshi koromb (Egyptian-style cabbage rolls). Note how the ends are not folded in.]]
In [[Egyptian cuisine]], cabbage rolls are called محشي كرمب, pronounced ''maḥshī kromb'' or ''maḥshī koronb'' (as Standard Arabic [m] often turns to [n] in proximity to [b] in Egyptian Arabic), literally translating to "stuffed cabbage". The leaves are fresh and commonly cut into smaller pieces and partially pre-cooked. The most common filling is a mixture of rice, onion, tomato, herbs, and spices (most typically including mint, dill, and cumin); meat is rarely used in Egyptian stuffed cabbage. The rolls are arranged in a pot and boiled in broth or tomato-based sauce, also including the herbs and spices.&lt;ref name = "Egyptian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Egyptian style stuffed cabbage leaves|url=http://www.food.com/recipe/egyptian-style-stuffed-cabbage-leaves-mashy-crump-194768|publisher=Food.com|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the pieces of cabbage and therefore the rolls are small, the leaves are usually simply rolled around the filling almost like a small cigar, and are left open at the ends rather than folded around the filling to produce a completely enclosed package.&lt;ref name = "Egyptian" /&gt;

=== Americas ===

[[File:Stuffed Cabbage Golomki.jpg|thumb|Polish-style ''gołąbki'' served in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]]]

====United States====
In regions heavily influenced by Polish immigrants, such as Chicago which claims the largest Polish population outside of Poland, Detroit, Pennsylvania, the southern tier of New York, and [[Northeast Ohio|northeastern Ohio]], the term usually refers instead to stuffed cabbage rolls, such as the Polish [[gołąbki]]. In some places these are known as ''pigs in a blanket''. [[Jewish]] immigrants from Eastern Europe popularized the dish in [[New York City]], where they became known as "Jewish Cabbage".&lt;ref name="Lavine"/&gt;

Cabbage rolls also feature prominently in the cuisines of [[Cajuns]] and [[Louisiana Creoles]] of southern Louisiana, where they usually take the form of ground pork mixed with rice and chopped vegetables stuffed into parboiled cabbage leaves and cooked in a [[tomato sauce]]-based liquid.

'''Dzūkian dialect''', known in academic works as '''Southern Aukštaitian dialect''', is one of the three main sub-dialects of the [[Aukštaitian dialect]] of [[Lithuanian language]]. Dzūkian dialect is spoken in [[Dzūkija]], southern [[Lithuania]]. Its most distinctive feature is replacing ''t'', ''d'' before ''i'', ''į'', ''y'', ''ie'' and ''č'', ''dž'' with ''c'' and ''dz'' (''cik'' instead of ''tik'' – just, ''dzidumas'' instead of ''didumas'' – size, ''pync'' instead of ''pinti'' – to braid, ''sveciai'' instead of ''svečiai'' – guests). Since the region borders [[Slavs|Slavic]] lands, the dialect has many Slavic [[loanword]]s and [[barbarism (linguistics)|barbarism]]s.

'''Euronews''' is a European pay television [[news broadcasting|news]] network, headquartered in [[Lyon]], France. The network began broadcasting on 1 January 1993, and aimed to cover world news from a [[Pan-European identity|pan-European]] perspective.

It is jointly owned by several European and [[North Africa]]n state broadcasting organisations, and since 2015 majority owned (53%) by Media Globe Networks led by Egyptian billionaire [[Naguib Sawiris]] who is chairman of the supervisory board.

==History and organisation==
[[File:Euronews_HQ_©euronews_photo_Stéphane_Audras_2015.10.15_(169).JPG|thumb|Euronews headquarters in Lyon]]

===General===
In 1992, following the [[Gulf War|First Persian Gulf War]], during which [[CNN]]'s position as the preeminent source of [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour news]] programming was cemented, the [[European Broadcasting Union]] decided to establish Euronews to present information from a European perspective. The channel's first broadcast was on 1 January 1993 from Lyon. An additional broadcast studio was set up in London in 1996. It was founded by a group of ten European public broadcasters:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Richard|title=From Satellite to Single Market: New Communication Technology and European Public Service Television | publisher = Routledge |year=1998|location=London|pages=130|isbn=9780415179706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[France Télévisions]]
*[[RAI]], Italy
*[[RTBF]], Belgium
*[[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal|RTP]], Portugal
*[[RTVE]], Spain (former shareholder)
*[[Télé Monte Carlo|TMC]], Monaco (former shareholder)
*[[Yleisradio|YLE]], Finland
*[[ERTU]], Egypt

In 1997, the British news broadcaster [[ITN]] purchased a 49 percent share of Euronews for £5.1&amp;nbsp;million from [[Alcatel-Alsthom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ITN Acquires 49% Euronews Stake |date=1 December 1997|url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/itn-acquires-49-euronews-stake--124079 |work=Telecom Paper|accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ITN supplies the content of the channel along with the remaining shareholders, which are represented by the '''SOCEMIE''' ({{lang-fr|Société éditrice de la chaîne européenne multilingue d'information Euronews}}) [[consortium]]. Euronews SA is the operating company that produces the channel and holds the broadcasting licence. It is co-owned by the ten founders and:

*[[All-Russia State Television and Radio Company|VGTRK]], Russia
*[[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|TRT]], Turkey
*[[Česká televize|ČT]], Czech Republic
*[[Public Broadcasting Services|PBS]], Malta
*[[Société Nationale de Radiodiffusion et de Télévision|SNRT]], Morocco
*[[Radiotelevizija Slovenija|RTVSLO]], Slovenia
*[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]], Ireland
*[[UA:PBC]], Ukraine
*[[SRG SSR|SRG-SSR]], Switzerland
*[[Televiziunea Română|TVR]], Romania
*[[Sveriges Television|SVT]]/[[Modern Times Group|MTG]], Sweden
*[[Établissement de la Radiodiffusion-Télévision Tunisienne|ERTT]], Tunisia
*[[Entreprise nationale de télévision|ENTV]], Algeria

The broadcast switched from solely [[Analog transmission|analogue]] to mainly [[Digital data|digital]] transmission in 1999. In the same year, the Portuguese audio track was added. The Russian audio track appeared in 2001.

In 2003, ITN sold its stake in Euronews as part of its drive to streamline operations and focus on news-gathering rather than channel management.&lt;ref name="BroadcastMagazine"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/multi-platform/news/itn-drops-out-of-euronews-channel/1116586.article|title=ITN Drops Out of Euronews Channel|newspaper=[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 February 2006, Ukrainian public broadcaster [[National Television Company of Ukraine|Natsionalna Telekompanya Ukraïny (NTU)]] purchased a one percent interest in SOCEMIE.&lt;ref name="digitalspy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a28857/ntu-becomes-20th-euronews-shareholder.html|title=NTU Becomes 20th EuroNews Shareholder|date=5 February 2006|publisher=[[DigitalSpy]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 May 2008, Spanish public broadcaster [[RTVE]] decided to leave Euronews to promote its international channel TVE Internacional. It also cited legal requirements to maintain low debt levels through careful spending as a factor influencing its decision to leave.&lt;ref name="elmundo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/06/05/comunicacion/1212656729.html|title=TVE abandona EuroNews| language=Spanish|date=5 February 2006|newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, the Turkish public broadcaster [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|TRT]] became a shareholder in the channel, and joined its supervisory board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkey's TRT joins Euronews supervisory board|date=15 September 2009|url= http://www.worldbulletin.net/?aType=haberArchive&amp;ArticleID=47271|work=World Bulletin|accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; TRT purchased 15.70% of the channel's shares and became the fourth main partner after France Télévisions (23.93%), RAI (21.54%), and [[All-Russia State Television and Radio Company|VGTRK]] (16.94%).

In February 2015, the channel's executive board approved a bid by Media Globe Networks, owned by Egyptian telecom magnate [[Naguib Sawiris]], to acquire a 53% controlling stake in the media outlet. The deal raised questions over Euronews's future editorial posture and independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptian Mogul Plans to Buy Controlling Stake in Europe's Answer to CNN|date=27 February 2015|url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/egyptian-mogul-sawiris-buy-euronews-778229|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Controversial ventures pose questions for Euronews|date=24 March 2015|url= https://euobserver.com/news/128098|work=EU Observer|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Euronews investor Naguib Sawiris: we will resist state interference|date=27 February 2015|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/27/euronews-investor-naguib-sawiris-we-will-resist-state-interference|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio service===
In 2 October 2012, Euronews launched Euronews Radio. The service was designed for viewers who "watching news is not an option" by providing a direct simulcast to the TV channel, with "No Comment" segment being replaced by music. The music of the bulletin openings are also transmitted on Euronews Radio. Weather reports are read by a female announcer.

===Africanews===
{{main|Africanews}}

On 20 April 2016, the French subsidiary of Euronews launched an African version of their news service called Africanews in French and English.

===Partnership with NBC===
In November 2016, the channel's executive board was in talks with [[NBCUniversal]], parent company of [[NBC News]], for a "strategic partnership". NBCU would acquire 15 to 30% ownership of the Euronews network, would contribute to Euronews content, and facilitate NBC News' expanded operations in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC News, Euronews in Talks for Strategic Partnership|date=11 November 2016|url= https://variety.com/2016/tv/global/nbc-news-euronews-talks-strategic-partnership-1201915855|work=Variety Media|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After successful negotiations with the [[European Commission]], who feared that the partnership would result on an ''Americanization'' of Euronews, the NBCUniversal News Group finally purchased a 25% stake in Euronews in February 2017 for $30&amp;nbsp;million. NBC News president [[Deborah Turness]] was appointed to head up international operations, and incumbent Euronews CEO Michael Peters, which has lead it since 2004, became CEO of the new partnership. Both report directly to NBC News chairman [[Andrew Lack (executive)|Andy Lack]]. The resulting partnership became known as Euronews NBC. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Palmeri|first1=Christopher|title=NBC Acquires Stake in Euronews, Taps U.S. News Chief to Lead It|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-14/nbc-acquires-stake-in-euronews-taps-u-s-news-chief-to-lead-it|accessdate=17 February 2017|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although Sawiris and NBC News have the largest stakes in Euronews, editorial control by SOCEMIE members has been assured, with the broadcasters having seven slots in the editorial board, as opposed to Sawiris' company (which has three slots) and NBC News, which only has one, thereby reducing rumours of an ''Americanization'' of Euronews' values. Editorial control is fully handled by Euronews' teams, with NBC only focusing on planning and coordinating tasks. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-eco/2017/05/31/97002-20170531FILWWW00300-euronews-le-rapprochement-avec-nbc-finalise.php|title=Euronews: le rapprochement avec NBC finalisé (in French)|date=31 May 2017|work=Le Figaro|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the formation of the partnership, video reports from NBC News' properties began to appear frequently on the TV channel and reports from [[NBCNews.com]] began to be distributed on its digital platforms. 

On 9 May 2017, Euronews split its service into 12 language-specific editions, of which nine have a linear TV channel with its own language voiceover, but now including contents, on-air graphics (except for some segments) and its lower-third news ticker in the language. The ''glocal'' strategy allows the language editorial teams to personalise the content and presentation of their channel, not only by sharing own-produced content with other languages, but by producing content that is relevant to local audiences, and allowing local reporters and presenters to appear on camera in all its language editions. The splitting process finished on 24 May 2017. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.panoramaaudiovisual.com/2017/05/10/euronews-reinventa-su-oferta-de-difusion-y-digital/|title=Euronews reinventa su oferta de difusión y digital (in Spanish)|last=|first=|date=10 May 2017|website=Panorama Audiovisual|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the major language split, satellite distribution for the German, Spanish, Portuguese and Turkish channels was discontinued, now being only available via fiber-optic IP uplink.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the discontinuation of the German-language channel from satellite distribution generated outcry from many German satellite TV owners, resulting on the restoration of the German-language channel on the [[Astra 1L]] satellite on 25 July 2017, via an unencrypted SD feed sitting alongside the French-language channel. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2017/07/26/euronews-puts-german-channel-back-on-satellite/|title=Euronews puts German channel back on satellite|last=Krieger|first=Jörn|date=26 July 2017|work=Broadband TV News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Arabic and Persian language editions became available only on Euronews' website and apps, with the TV channels being discontinued, and the Ukrainian edition was discontinued outright, due to lack of funding from the Ukrainian government. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telesatellite.com/actu/49612-fin-de-la-version-ukrainienne-euronews.html|title=Fin de la version ukrainienne d'Euronews (in French)|date=23 May 2017|work=Télé Satellite et Numérique|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the Euronews channel in English became known as the ''World'' edition, and distribution to premises in the American continent via fiber-optic IP uplink is set to begin later in 2018. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These changes caused the elimination of 43 staff positions, mainly from the Ukrainian edition, causing major layoffs and production staff having more flexible roles. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/actualites/1/actualite-economique/euronews-43-departs-a-l-issue-du-plan-de-sauvegarde_1911482.html|title=Euronews: 43 départs à l'issue du plan de sauvegarde (in French)|date=24 May 2017|work=L'Express-L'Expansion|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Euronews' English-language channel began to gradually revamp its programming schedule, with the roll-out of a new slate of presenter-led programming to compliment its already existing shows, a move that was reported earlier in the year, after the success of its presenter-led special reports and weekly programming introduced in recent years. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.a516digital.com/2018/01/big-changes-for-euronews-in-2018.html|title=Big changes for Euronews in 2018|date=2 January 2018|work=a516digital|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside conventional rolling news shows, debate programming, talk shows and new presenter-led shows will be offered during the weekly schedule, and throughout programmes, Euronews reporters from different nationalities will be offering context on stories close to their respective home nationalities. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2017/05/11/euronews-overhauls-its-broadcasting-strategy-bid-become-the-unrivalled-chronicler|title=Euronews overhauls its broadcasting strategy in bid to become the unrivalled chronicler of Europe|last=Burrell|first=Ian|date=11 May 2017|work=The Drum|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The roll-out began on 22 May, when Euronews debuted the first of these new shows, ''Good Morning Europe'', a five-hour morning show which airs every weekday morning from 7am. It was first anchored by former [[RT (TV network)|RT]] correspondent Tesa Arcilla, which anchored it in a temporary basis. Some weeks later, former [[France 24]] presenter Belle Donati began presenting the show, alternating with Arcilla; after she moved to [[Brussels]] in September, she became the main anchor of the slot. Two months later, on 17 July, Euronews debuted a six-hour breaking news show, ''Euronews Now'', anchored by Tokunbo Salako, covering the dayside and afternoon slots. On 3 September, the new evening programme lineup was launched, starting with a politics-focused show, ''Raw Politics'', hosted by Tesa Arcilla, and featuring former [[Sky News]] reporter Darren McCaffrey from [[Brussels]]. Two weeks later, on 17 September, the full roll-out was completed with the introduction of a 5-hour evening rolling news show, ''Euronews Tonight'', presented by former [[Sky News]] and [[BBC News]] presenter Sam Naz.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2018/08/09/inside-euronews-nbc-fresh-rolling-news-channel-striving-help-save-united-europe|title=Inside Euronews NBC: a fresh rolling news channel striving to help save united Europe|last=Burrell|first=Ian|date=9 August 2018|work=The Drum|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional pre-produced blocks of video content still remains on late nights and weekends. Most overnights now repeat the previous day's edition (either full or half length) of ''Euronews Now''.

New weekly programming is also being produced, including the weekly interview series ''Uncut'', which feature conversations from political leaders and newsmakers worldwide with minimum to no editing. The first episodes feature German-French politician [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] interviewing former [[UKIP]] leader [[Nigel Farage]] and former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] about the [[Brexit]] uprising. Additionally, a new social media unit was created, with journalists with a background on digital news verification leading it. The newly-created team help to produce ''The Cube'', a social media segment during rolling news shows, focusing on analysis on treatment and reactions about news headlines on social media, with special attention at the major stories of the day. ''No Comment'', a long-standing element of Euronews' programming, remains on the channels' schedule, and it's being gradually integrated into the rolling news shows on the English-language channel. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Additionally, a major investment in mobile reporting via [[iPhone]] devices helped Euronews gain a major [[Scoop (news)|scoop]], becoming the only TV news outlet worldwide to broadcast live coverage from the [[Aquarius (NGO ship)|MV Aquarius]], with Paris correspondent Annelise Borges (formerly with [[France 24]]) on assignment. Borges broadcast live during 10 days as the new Italian far-right government denied the Aquarius access to Italian ports. The coverage made headlines on many news outlets worldwide, and helped Euronews boost its credibility and its audience.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The new Euronews also hired new correspondents in London, Berlin, Moscow, Rome, Madrid and Washington D.C., and gained access to NBC News' large network of correspondents worldwide.

As of September 2018, the other language editions are unaffected, with the pre-produced blocks of video content remaining at all times, although there are plans to introduce presenter-led programming during the morning slots on these other channels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After the takeover of [[Sky plc]] by NBCUniversal's parent company [[Comcast]] on 22 September 2018, EuronewsNBC will increase its worldwide reach, as it plans to closely integrate its operations (and those of NBC News) with those of [[Sky News]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/card/what-s-so-great-about-sky-n890601|title=What's so great about Sky?|last=Atkinson|first=Claire|date=11 July 2018|work=NBCNews.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Broadcast==
The channel is available in 430&amp;nbsp;million households in 166 countries worldwide. It reaches more than 170&amp;nbsp;million European households by [[cable television|cable]], [[satellite television|satellite]] and [[terrestrial television|terrestrial]]. It also began to secure availability on [[multimedia]] platforms such as [[IPTV]] and digital media.&lt;ref name="MediaPressPack"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.euronews.net/media/the-station/mediapackpress_EN.pdf|title=Euronews Media Presspack|accessdate=27 June 2010| newspaper=Euronews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Euronews launched an application for mobile devices ([[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iPhone]], and [[iPad]]) which is called "Euronews Live". The application is free of charge and is available on Google Play and the App Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/services/euronews-live-app/|title=euronews live apllication|accessdate=20 August 2011|newspaper=Euronews|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308144516/http://www.euronews.com/services/euronews-live-app/|archivedate=8 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This app was later shut down quietly.

The following countries also broadcast Euronews through terrestrial channels for a limited amount of time:

The channel's programmes are also available by [[podcast]], and it has also maintained a YouTube channel since October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="No Comment" sur YouTube ?

In 2012, the largest Belarusian state network MTIS stopped broadcasting Euronews for unknown reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://naviny.by/rubrics/society/2012/01/01/ic_news_116_383897/|script-title=ru:В сети МТИС прекращена трансляция канала "Евроньюс"|accessdate=5 June 2012|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Naviny|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euroradio.fm/ru/report/v-minske-otklyuchayut-euronews-87163|title=В Минске отключают Euronews|accessdate=5 June 2012|date=31 December 2011|publisher=Euroradio| language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the new commercial channel Planet TV started broadcasting Euronews dubbed in Slovenian after Antenna TV SL purchased a major stake in the company. Euronews airs after closedown (or sign-off) of Planet TV, but both call sign logos are displayed.

In September 2016, Euronews disappeared from the [[Freesat]] channel list in the UK, in a move made by Sawiris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a516digital.com/2016/09/satellite-update-sky-q-by-default.html |title=Satellite Update: SkyQ by default, Freesat withdrawals |date=26 September 2016 |website=a516digital |access-date=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HD===
[[High-definition television|High-definition]] (HD) broadcasting was started on 2 November 2016 via satellite using [[Hot Bird]]-capacities (English audio only). Regarding the audio codec, Euronews used the [[Dolby Digital|AC3]] format at the beginning here, changing to the [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] codec in March 2017, and changing it again to the MPEG codec in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=digitalbitrate|url=http://www.digitalbitrate.com/files/s21/S21_11565_801_a.png?v=1493887506|publisher=digitalbitrate.com|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Euronews logo is the fifth. From 1 January 1993 to February 1999 the logo was in the lower right corner of the screen, from February 1999 to June 2008 it was in the upper left corner of the screen, from June 2008 to May 2016 it was in the upper right corner of the screen, and from May 2016 to present it has been in the lower left corner of the screen.

The current design of the '''flag of [[Johannesburg]]''' was adopted on 16 May 1997, replacing a previous version of the flag that had been in service since 20 October 1970.

The design is a [[white]]-[[fimbriated]] vertical [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] of [[blue]], [[green]], and [[red]]. The new coat of arms of the city of Johannesburg is displayed in the centre of the flag on a green panel in the centre of a heraldic [[fret (heraldry)|fret]] on a white disk on a [[black]] background. The flag clearly alludes to the colours of the [[Flag of South Africa|new national flag of South Africa]] and the central panel alludes to the city's coat of arms.

The previous design was approved by the [[Mayor of Johannesburg]] in 1970. The flag comprised a green field that had a horizontal [[gold (color)|gold]] stripe running through the centre, above which were two golden [[Seal (device)|stamps]] and one gold stamp below. The golden stamps were taken from the previous coat of arms.

The '''Gbaran tribe''' of the [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] people lives along Taylor Creek ("Gbarantoru") in central [[Bayelsa State]], [[Nigeria]]. Gbaran settlements include: Okotiama, Poloaku, Obinagha, Ogboloma, Nedugo, Agbia, Ibiaye (Ebiyai), and  Koroama. Okotiama is the senior community. The close proximity of Gbaran villages along Taylor Creek has helped them maintain their shared cultural traditions. The clan god is Gbaran Ziba.&lt;ref&gt;Alagoa, Ebiegberi Joe (2005). ''A History of the Niger Delta'', Port Harcourt: Onyoma Research Publications. {{ISBN|978-37314-5-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gbarain is actually a clan occupying the villages mentioned above. The Gbarain people are part of the Izon (Ijaw) ethnic nationality. Gbarain was founded by a man called Gbarainowei, son of Oporoza the son of Izon. Gbarainowei's brothers are Kumbowei and Kabowei in Sagbama Local Government Area of Bayelsa State in Nigeria. The Gbarain people speak a dialect Izon. Their occupations, like other of Izon groups, include fishing, farming, canoe-carving and [[palm oil production]].&lt;ref&gt;Tuaweri, J.O.

==Significant events==
* 11 April 2008: Youths from Gbaran clan in Yenagoa disrupted operations at the Etelebou flow station owned by the [[Shell Petroleum Development Company]] (SPDC). The action followed alleged non-implementation of a Global Memorandum of Understanding (GMOU) the company entered into with the host communities. The youths stormed the flow station and chased out the oil workers including the expatriate workers.&lt;ref&gt;"Bayelsa youths disrupt Shell operations", The Tide, 16 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the book's title is given by the author in the introduction:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/15914/37945/1/CamillaCB_Hungrvaka_2013.pdf|title=Hungrvaka|last=Basset|first=Camilla|publisher=Háskóli Íslands (MA thesis)|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=3|archive-url=http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/15914/37945/1/CamillaCB_Hungrvaka_2013.pdf|archive-date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text=‘Bœkling þenna kalla ek Hungrvǫku, af því at svá mun mǫrgum mǫnnum ófróðum ok þó óvitrum gefit vera, þeim er hann hafa yfir farit, at miklu myndu gørr vilja vita upprás ok ævi þeira merkismanna er hér verðr fátt frá sagt á þessi skrá.’

The '''World Political Forum''' (also called '''Istanbul Forum''') is a [[non-profit]] [[foundation (non-profit)|foundation]], based in [[Turkey]], best known for its annual meeting in [[Istanbul]]. The forum takes place with the participation of statesmen, CEOs, opinion leaders, bureaucrats and the business elite as well as renowned figures from reputable universities.

==History==
{{Multiple image|align=left|image1=Kofi Annan.jpg|width1=149|image2=Al Gore.jpg|width2=133|footer=Nobel Peace Prize recipients Kofi Annan and Al Gore were among the speakers of the 2011 summit.}}

Ahmet Eyüp Özgüç is the current President of the Foundation which originally started the preparations for the summit in 2010 and sought to broaden its vision further to include providing a platform for resolving international conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A model for the Arab World |first= |last= |url=http://www.euronews.net/2011/03/25/turkey-a-model-for-the-arab-world/ |newspaper=[[Euronews]] |place= |date=23 March 2011 |accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first was held on 13–14 March, 2011, in Istanbul and was hosted by the Turkish Foundation and supported by the Turkish Prime Ministry. The theme was “Changing to meet, meeting to change”, emphasizing the radical changes in policymakers’ thinking now taking place and the importance of sharing new ideas to address the urgent problems facing particularly the Middle East.
The summit was the first of what Turkish Foundation President Ahmet Eyüp Özgüç planned to be an annual forum supported by the Turkish Foundation. Just as the G8 is losing out to a more representative G20 in global economic decision-making, the Turkish organizers intend that such summits provide a more democratic platform for voices of change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Summit: ‘Meeting to Change’ |first=Eric |last=Walberg |url=http://ericwalberg.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=322:turkish-summit-meeting-to-change&amp;catid=41:culture-and-religion&amp;Itemid=94 |newspaper=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] |place= |date=23 March 2011 |accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second World Political Forum was held on May 17-18, 2012, with the theme of "Building a New World".

Third summit is to be held in June 2013 with the theme "A New and Righteous World Order".

==Participants==
The two-day event called the “Leaders of Change Summit” opened March 13, 2011. It consisted of nearly 100 speakers:

== History ==
During the Democratic Kampuchea days, the 68,000-member Khmer Rouge-dominated [[Military history of Cambodia#Khmer Rouge Armed Forces|CPNLAF]] (Cambodian People's National Liberation Armed Forces) force, which completed its conquest of Phnom Penh, Cambodia in April 1975, was renamed the RAK (Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea). This name dated back to the peasant uprising that broke out in the [[Samlot district]] of [[Battambang Province]] in 1967. Under its long-time commander and then Minister of Defense [[Son Sen]], the RAK had 230 battalions in 35 to 40 regiments and in 12 to 14 brigades. The command structure in units was based on three-person committees in which the political commissar ranked higher than the military commander and his deputy.

Cambodia was divided into zones and special sectors by the RAK, the boundaries of which changed slightly over the years. Within these areas, the RAK's first task was the peremptory execution of former [[Khmer National Armed Forces]] (FANK) officers and of their families, without trial or fanfare to eliminate KR enemies. The RAK's next priority was to consolidate into a national army the separate forces that were operating more or less autonomously in the various zones. The Khmer Rouge units were commanded by zonal secretaries who were simultaneously party and military officers, some of whom were said to have manifested "[[warlord]] characteristics". Troops from one zone frequently were sent to another zone to enforce discipline. These efforts to discipline zonal secretaries and their dissident or ideologically impure cadres gave rise to the purges that were to decimate RAK ranks, to undermine the morale of the victorious army, and to generate the seeds of rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=When the War Was over: Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge Revolution|last=Becker|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1986|isbn=0-671-41787-8|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the KR used the RAK to sustain and fuel its violent campaign. The Air Force of the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army was formed in 1977 and disband in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;The Vietnamese invasion of 1979 resulted in the forcible disbandment of the AFKLA; formation of a successor force did not begin until 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Konso''' (Komso, Khonso, also ''Af Kareti, Afa Karatti, Conso, Gato, Karate, Kareti'') is a [[Lowland East Cushitic languages|Lowland East Cushitic language]] spoken in southwest [[Ethiopia]]. [[First language|Native speakers]] of '''Konso''' number about 200,000 (SIL 2005).  Konso is closely related to [[Dirasha language|Dirasha]] (also known as Gidole), and serves as a "trade language"—or ''[[lingua franca]]''—beyond the area of the [[Konso]] people. Blench (2006) considers purported dialects Gato and Turo to be separate languages.&lt;ref&gt;Blench, 2006. [http://rogerblench.info/Language/Afroasiatic/General/AALIST.pdf The Afro-Asiatic Languages: Classification and Reference List] (ms)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grammar of Konso was first described by Hellenthal (2004), and later, in more detail, by Ongaye (2013). The New Testament was published in the Konso language in 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3550">'''Kudu dung-spitting''' ('''Bokdrol Spoeg''' in [[Afrikaans]]) is a [[sport]] practiced by the Afrikaner community in South Africa.  In the competition small, hard pellets of [[manure|dung]] from the [[Greater kudu|kudu]] [[antelope]], are [[spitting|spat]], with the farthest distance reached being the winner.

Kudu dung-spitting is popular enough to have an annual world championship competition, with the formal sport beginning in 1994. Contests are held at some community bazaars, game festivals or tourism shows in the [[bushveld]], [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal]] and [[Eastern Cape]].&lt;ref name=wfz&gt;{{cite web|title=Koedoedrol Verspoeg Kompetisie |url=http://www.wildsfees.co.za/events/koedoedrol-verspoeg-kompetisie/ |website=wildsfees.co.za |publisher=Kirkwood Wildsfees |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=beeld1&gt;{{cite news |title=Bekvol vir dié kompetisie |url=http://152.111.1.88/argief/berigte/beeld/2004/05/25/B1/11/02.html |accessdate=30 July 2015 |agency=Beeld |date=25 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=beeld2&gt;{{cite news|last1=de Wet |first1=Christopher |title=Fees gaan wilder as die wildtuin wees |url=http://152.111.1.88/argief/berigte/beeld/2007/04/19/KA/2/tzcdwfees.html |accessdate=30 July 2015 |agency=Beeld |date=19 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many similar sports, the distance is measured from the marker to the place the dung pellet comes to rest, rather than where it initially hit the ground.&lt;ref name=skin&gt;{{cite web |last1=Skinner |first1=Rod |title=Spoeg sport pret |url=http://ladysmithgazette.co.za/17250/spoeg-sport-pret/ |website=ladysmithgazette.co.za |publisher=Ladysmith Gazette |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==

The bank dates back to 1955 when Lombard North Central (now known as [[Lombard Direct]]) of the [[United Kingdom]] started taking deposits in Malta through a number of agents.

*1958: [[National Provincial Bank]] Ltd. (now [[National Westminster Bank]] Plc) acquires North Central Finance Ltd. (now Lombard North Central Plc).
*1969: Lombard North Central established Lombard Bank (Malta), (now Lombard Bank Malta).
*1975: The Maltese government purchases 25% of Lombard Bank Malta.
*1981: The Maltese government purchases 35% of Lombard Bank Malta.
*1988: NatWest, unable to find a buyer, sold its remaining shares to the government.
*1990: In April 1990 the Bank became a [[Public Limited Company]] and offered equity to the public. The issue was five times oversubscribed and the government subsequently totally divested its shareholding.
*1994: Lombard Bank Malta listed on the Malta stock exchange. The Government sold 21% of the shares (Lombard North Central’s remaining stake) to Malaysian entrepreneur Robert Tan Hua Choon.
*1998: CCF Holdings (Suisse) acquired Tan’s 21%.
*2000: [[HSBC Holdings]] acquires [[Credit Commercial de France]] and with it the stake in Lombard Malta.
*2002: HSBC sells its shares in Lombard Bank Malta to Swiss-based [[BSI Ltd|Banca Unione di Credito]], which now owns 26%.
*2006: Lombard Bank Malta acquired Transend Worldwide's 35 per cent shareholding in [[Malta Post|Maltapost]] Plc. Transend Worldwide, a New Zealand company, was instrumental in restructuring Maltapost over the past four years.
*2006: [[BSI Ltd|Banca della Svizzera Italiana]] (BSI) acquired [[Banca Unione di Credito]].
*2007: [[Cyprus Popular Bank]] (formerly Marfin Popular Bank) acquired 43% of the share capital from BSI and other international investors for €48 million.
*2018: The Government of Malta through the National Development and Social Fund (NDSF) acquires 49.1% of the issued share capital from Cyprus Popular Bank.

[[File:Road 4 to Sihanouk.JPG|thumb|right|200px|National Highway 4 in Chbar Mon in [[Phnom Penh]].]] 
'''National Highway 4''' or National Road No.4 (10004) (in [[Khmer language|Khmer]] ផ្លូវជាតិលេខ ៤) is one of the national [[highway]]s of [[Cambodia]]. With a length of {{convert|230|km|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;Discovering Sihanoukville Municipality, p. 665, in "Cambodia in the Early 21st Century", Phnom Penh, 2004, {{ISBN|2-9513524-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; it connects the capital of [[Phnom Penh]] with [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]] in the south-west.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060825003757/http://www.cambodiaportal.com/index.php?mymenu=destinations&amp;submenu=nationalroadnetwork&amp;ext=Y&amp;submenutitle=National%20Road%20Network Cambodian national road network]&lt;/ref&gt; Sihanoukville is the only international sea port of Cambodia. Consequently, NH4 is one of the most important highways of the country for economical purposes. The road was built in the 1950s coinciding with the construction of the port.&lt;ref&gt;Discovering Sihanoukville Municipality, p. 665, in "Cambodia in the Early 21st Century", Phnom Penh, 2004, {{ISBN|2-9513524-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The road was built especially for the transport of merchandise between the capital and the port by heavy trucks and containers. Portions of NH4 was considered a [[toll road]] with three stations to collect fees. All toll stations have now been removed, the road is now toll free.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/national-road-4-toll-fees-nixed
&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered the most dangerous road of Cambodia due to several traffic accidents and little control by authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Real Travel: [http://realtravel.com/sihanoukville-cambodia-travel-guide-d658440-1.2344218.html Travel Guide for Sihanoukville], Link retrieved on 5th Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The road begins at the junction of [[Pochentong Avenue]] and [[National Highway 3 (Cambodia)|National Highway 3]]. The junction, located in western [[Phnom Penh]] near the [[Phnom Penh International Airport]], is in the [[Sangkat]] Chaom Chau &amp;ndash; [[Dangkor District]]. The road initially heads westerly then curves toward the south west.

After the first toll station, NH4 enters [[Kandal Province]]. It then crosses [[Kampong Speu Province|Kampong Speu]], [[Koh Kong Province|Koh Kong]] and [[Sihanoukville Province|Sihanoukville]] provinces. In the territory of Koh Kong, at Chamkar Luong, National Road 48 branches off west toward Koh Kong town and the [[Thailand|Thai]] border. The junction with NH3, which leads to [[Kampot (city)|Kampot]] to the east beyond to the [[Vietnam]]ese border is in the territory of Sihanoukville, at [[Prey Nob]] District.

The '''Palazzo Dall’Armi Marescalchi'''  is a [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style palace  in central [[Bologna]].

The palace was initially constructed in 1466, and rebuilt in 1613 by [[Floriano Ambrosini]]. The Marescalchi name was added when Eleonora D’Armi married Senator Vincenzo Marescalchi.

In the 1700s, further lands and gardens added. In the 19th century further reconstruction was pursued. The scientist [[Guglielmo Marconi]] was born in the palace. In 1961 it was acquired by the Ministry of the Treasury, and converted to house the ''Soprintendenza per i Beni Ambientali e Architettonici'' of the Province of Emilia. Some of the rooms on the main floor retain frescoes by [[Ludovico Carracci]] and [[Guido Reni]]. The large oval hall was frescoed by [[Felice Giani]] in 1780.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arte.it/guida-arte/bologna/da-vedere/monumento/palazzo-dall-armi-marescalchi-2251 Arte.it] website on palace.&lt;/ref&gt; The palace suffered during the bombardments of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memoriadibologna.comune.bologna.it/palazzo-dallarmi-marescalchi-1323-luogo Memoria di Bologna] entry on palace, by Silvia Benati.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was constructed in the Willis's Plateau area on the upper northern slopes of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]]. Formerly called [[Catalan Battery]], it was renamed after [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover]], the wife of King [[Frederick I of Prussia]], who was the brother of King [[George I of Great Britain]]. The battery saw service in the [[Thirteenth Siege of Gibraltar]] in 1727 and inflicted substantial damage on the attacking Spanish forces. By 1773 it had two 12-pdr guns. Its armament was upgraded to four 24-pdrs in 1834, and from 1885–9 it mounted two 64-pdr [[rifled muzzle loader]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hughes|Hughes &amp; Migos]], p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Roman Catholic Diocese of Myitkyina''' (Lat: ''Dioecesis Myitkyinaensis'') is a [[diocese]] of the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Burma]]. Erected in 1939 as the Apostolic Prefecture of Bhamo, the prefecture was created from territory in the Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Burma. In 1961, the Prefecture was elevated to a full diocese, suffragan to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mandalay|Archdiocese of Mandalay]]. The current bishop is [[Francis Daw Tang]], appointed in 2004. Currently the Diocese manages numerous churches, schools and clinics throughout [[Kachin State]].

==Pre-History==
Before the Diocese was fully established, the first footprints of Catholicism in [[Myitkyina]] were set in 1856, when French Bishop [[Paul Bigandet]] [[Paris Foreign Missions Society|M.E.P.]] visited the northern region of [[Myanmar|Burma]]. Seventeen years later, in 1873, a trio of priests were dispatched to begin the early works of the Diocese. According to internal historical records, three decades of extreme sicknesses caused by [[malaria]] brought the work to a stand-still.&lt;ref name=conference&gt;Pg. 184, para 1. ''Official Catholic Directory 2016'', The Catholic Bishops' Conference of Myanmar, Yangon 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the years 1873 to 1901, 14 priests either died or returned wrecked in health.&lt;ref name=conference /&gt; The mission was slow to spread throughout Kachin populations in the early 20th Century until the arrival of the first [[Columban Missionaries]] from Ireland in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;''Official Catholic Directory 2016'', at para 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
With "Divine Providence" re-instated in the architects of Catholicism in Kachin State, evangelization was resumed with "renewed vigour and fresh hopes" and by 1965 and 1966, the diocese was handed over to the local clergy.

Throughout the 1960s and to this day, the Diocese of Myitkyina has been bringing gospel and aid to isolated and hazardous locations in Northern Myanmar.

==Ordinaries==
*Patrizio Usher, [[S.S.C.M.E.]] † (7 Jan 1939 Appointed - 1958 Died) 
*John James Howe, S.S.C.M.E. † (18 Jul 1959 Appointed - 9 Dec 1976 Resigned) 
*Paul Zingtung Grawng (9 Dec 1976 Appointed - 24 May 2003 Appointed, Archbishop of Mandalay) Grawng is credited as being the first Kachin priest to be ordained as priest in 1965.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13033">'''Satellite subcarrier audio''' is audio transmitted by way of [[communications satellite|satellite]] that utilizes a separate [[analog signal|analog]] or [[Digital broadcasting|digital]] signal carried on a main radio transmission (usually [[video]]) on a specific satellite [[Transponder (satellite communications)|transponder]]. More technically, it is an already-modulated signal, which is then modulated into another signal of higher frequency and bandwidth. In a more general sense, satellite subcarrier audio is an early form of [[satellite radio]] not intended for the consumer market but was initially [[encryption|unencrypted]], thus receivable to satellite hobbyists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Beckerdite |first=Susan |year=1992 |title=Satellite Audio |magazine=Satellite TV 1992 Buyer's Guide |pages=70, 72 |publisher=Fortuna Communications Corp. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Original analog video only has one channel per transponder, with [[subcarrier]]s for audio and automatic transmission identification service [[Automatic Transmitter Identification System (television)|ATIS]]. Non-multiplexed [[radio broadcasting|radio station]]s can also travel in [[single channel per carrier]] (SCPC) mode, with multiple carriers (analog or digital) per transponder. This allows each station to transmit directly to the satellite, rather than paying for a whole transponder, or using [[landline]]s to send it to an [[ground station|earth station]] for multiplexing with other stations.

==Analog subcarriers==
Satellite subcarrier audio was initially transmitted in analog form. This method of audio transmission was first employed by [[Fujitsu]] in 1973 as part of a data line between the United States and Spain.&lt;ref name="fujitsu-sub"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/plus/history/episode4/history.html|title=4. A Wave of International Standardization (1970-1979) : Chronology|work=A Quick History of Fujitsu|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1980s, the use of analog subcarriers for radio network distribution had become well-established.

===Standard subcarrier audio===
Initially, satellite subcarrier audio was tuned using commercial receivers or consumer-grade [[Television receive-only|TVRO]] "big dish" satellite receivers. The audio ranged in frequency from 5.0 to 8.5 [[Hertz|MHz]] for both left and right audio channels. Fine tuning options included monaural and discrete stereo tuning with three bandwidth modes: narrow (130&amp;nbsp;kHz), normal (280&amp;nbsp;kHz) and wide (500&amp;nbsp;kHz).&lt;ref name="chap-faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myweb.accessus.net/~090/monty.html#1.5|title=1.5 MONTEREY SPECIFICATIONS|last=Haukap|first=Anthony W.|date=15 May 2007|work=AWH: Chaparral Monterey Receivers FAQ|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Beckerdite |first=Susan |year=1992 |title=Satellite Audio |magazine=Satellite TV 1992 Buyer's Guide |pages=72 |publisher=Fortuna Communications Corp. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single channel per carrier (analog SCPC)===
'''Single channel per carrier''' ('''SCPC''') refers to using a single [[Signaling (telecommunications)|signal]] at a given [[frequency]] and [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. Most often, this is used on [[List of satellites in geosynchronous orbit|broadcast satellite]]s to indicate that [[radio broadcasting|radio station]]s are not [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] as [[subcarrier]]s onto a single [[video]] [[carrier wave|carrier]], but instead independently share a [[transponder]]. It may also be used on other [[communications satellite]]s, or occasionally on non-satellite [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]]s. In an SCPC system, satellite bandwidth is dedicated to a single source.

Analog SCPC subcarrier audio is received using dedicated satellite receivers. SCPC audio receivers tune a frequency range of 50 to 90&amp;nbsp;MHz with both wide and narrow bandwidth options.&lt;ref name="rcdist-scpc200"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcdistributing.com/scpc200.html|title=Universal SCPC-200 page|work=R.C. Distributing|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Receivers in the hobbyist price range included the Heil SC-One and the Universal Electronics SCPC-100 and SCPC-200.&lt;ref name="rcdist-scpc200"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rvst-faq96"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/Satellite-TV/FAQ/|title=Frequently Asked Questions list|last=Bourgois|first=Gary|date=13 February 1996|work=rec.video.satellite / HOMESAT-L|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FM Squared (FM²)===
The FM Squared satellite audio format was developed in 1986 by Wegener Communications and Subcarrier Systems (later SpaceCom Systems, Inc.).&lt;ref name="bw-space-04_05-00"&gt;{{cite news|date=5 April 2000|title=SpaceCom Upgrades Founding Technology |publisher=Business Wire|location=New York, San Francisco|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/electronics/computer-electronics-manufacturing/6454400-1.html|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FM Squared is a method of transmitting analog satellite audio where video would normally be transmitted on a satellite transponder. FM Squared was once used to distribute [[Muzak]] and similar "business" music (sometimes referred to as [[Muzak#Elevator music|elevator music]]) to retailers.&lt;ref name="networld-6_25-90"&gt;{{cite news |last=Herbst |first=Kris |date=25 June 1990 |title=Networks that Make Sweet Music |newspaper=Network World  |location=Framingham, Massachusetts |volume=7 |issue=26 |page=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=phsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39#v=onepage |accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; FM Squared audio receivers tune a frequency range of 100&amp;nbsp;kHz to 9&amp;nbsp;MHz. Receivers that fell within the hobbyist price range included the Universal Electronics SC-50.&lt;ref name="univradio-sc50"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universal-radio.com/catalog/spcialty/3590.html|title=Universal Electronics SC-50 receiver page|work=Universal Radio Inc.|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital subcarriers==
Although not widely used until the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], digital subcarrier audio has existed almost as long as its analog technology counterpart. In 1972, the [[BBC]] deployed a digital audio transmission system linking their broadcast center to their remote transmitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aes.org/aeshc/pdf/fine_dawn-of-digital.pdf |accessdate=2011-05-23 |work=ARSC Journal |year=2008 |publisher=Ted P. Sheldon |editor=Barry R. Ashpole |first=Thomas |last=Fine |title=The Dawn of Commercial Digital Recording}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology wasn't applied to satellite communications, however, until the early 1980s.

===DATS and SEDAT===
The first widespread digital satellite audio distribution system was Digital Audio Transmission System (DATS).&lt;ref name="networld-6_25-90"/&gt; DATS was developed in 1982 by [[Scientific Atlanta]]. The DATS distribution system was first used by the largest U.S. radio networks such as [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]], [[Cumulus Media Networks|ABC Radio Networks]] and [[NBC]].&lt;ref name="networld-4_24-89"&gt;{{cite news|last=Herbst|first=Kris|date=24 April 1989|title=Networking the Networks|newspaper=Network World|publisher=IDG Communications|location=Framingham, Massachusetts|volume=6|issue=16|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DATS system transmitted 15&amp;nbsp;kHz-wide audio subcarriers at a data rate of 1.544 [[Data rate units#Megabit per second|Mbps]] using [[Phase-shift keying#Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK)|BPSK]] digital modulation.&lt;ref name="nmsu-tij97"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Sepmeier|first=Bill|year=1996|title=Satellite Audio Networks...Bits of History|magazine=The Technology Interface Journal|publisher=New Mexico State University|location=Las Cruces, New Mexico|issue=Winter 1997|accessdate=23 May 2011|url=http://et.nmsu.edu/~etti/winter97/communications/audio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DATS was later superseded by the Spectrum Efficient Digital Audio Transmission (SEDAT) satellite audio distribution system. SEDAT allows more audio channels to be carried in the same frequency range as DATS. SEDAT, also developed by Scientific Atlanta, was primarily used by ABC Radio Networks. SEDAT transmissions ended in 2001.&lt;ref name="radiomag01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radiomagonline.com/infrastructure/satellite/radio_sunset_sedat/|title=Sunset on SEDAT|last=Scherer|first=Chriss (editor)|date=1 August 2001|work=Radio|publisher=NewBay Media, LLC|accessdate=23 May 2011|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital SCPC and MCPC===
As digital subcarrier audio encoding and modulation methods have matured, less-expensive "standard" systems of satellite audio distribution have developed. This trend started with the emergence of [[Very-small-aperture terminal|VSAT]] technology in 1986&lt;ref name="nmsu-tij97"/&gt; and was further supplanted by leased space on [[direct-broadcast satellite|DBS]] systems such as [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]].&lt;ref name="muzak-prglist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muzakmidwest.com/content/download/161/538/file/Echo%20Program%20List.pdf|title=Echostar Programs|publisher=Muzak|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lyngsat-muzak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lyngsat-address.com/ln/Muzak.html|title=Muzak page|work=Lyngsat Address|publisher=Lyngemark Satellite|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two ''de facto'' methods for digital satellite audio transmission are digital [[single channel per carrier]] and [[Multiplexing#Digital_broadcasting|multiple channel per carrier]] [[multiplexing]].

In digital radio systems, several variable bit-rate data streams are multiplexed together to a fixed bitrate transport stream by means of statistical multiplexing. This makes it possible to transfer several video and audio channels simultaneously over the same frequency channel, together with various services. On communications satellites which carry broadcast television networks and radio networks, this is known as '''multiple channel per carrier''' or '''MCPC'''. Where multiplexing is not practical (such as where there are different sources using a single transponder), '''single channel per carrier''' mode (SCPC) is used. Digital SCPC differs from the older analog SCPC transmission method in that a digital SCPC signal carries more than just a single audio channel (two are used) but also coding and decoding information, ancillary and control data, and network identification data.&lt;ref name="nmsu-tij97"/&gt; Digital SCPC and MCPC subcarrier transmissions use satellite broadcast standards such as [[DVB-S]] and its successor [[DVB-S2]] along with [[MPEG-2]] and [[MPEG-4]] compression formats, respectively. BPSK modulation has been replaced with newer modulation schemes such as [[Phase-shift keying|QPSK]] (quadrature phase-shift keying).

===StarGuide===
StarGuide was the second-generation system of digital audio distribution via satellite. Many of the largest U.S. radio networks upgraded from or supplanted DATS/SEDAT audio feeds with StarGuide II and III audio receivers. The StarGuide platform is a proprietary MCPC digital audio distribution system that uses proprietary MX3 multiplexing technology. The StarGuide II receiver handles data rates from 512 kbit/s to 6.144 Mbit/s (in MX3 mode) and up to 8.192 Mbit/s in normal mode. The StarGuide III receiver can handle data rates up to 25 Mbit/s and is capable of a larger number of data and code rates than its predecessor. Both the StarGuide II and III receivers can utilize proprietary StarGuide Service Module expansion cards, including the ability to interface with [[local area network]]s (LAN) using [[Ethernet physical layer|10/100Base-T]] [[Ethernet]] connections.&lt;ref name="starguide01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starguidedigital.com/ie2/internal/products.htm|title=StarGuide Products|year=2003|work=StarGuide Digital Networks, Inc.|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Digital (XDS) format===
The X-Digital Systems format is (as of 2011) the newest generation of digital satellite subcarrier audio technology used by the large radio networks in the United States. In 2007, X-Digital Systems acquired specific assets and patent licensing of StarGuide Digital Networks technology from DG FastChannel, Inc.&lt;ref name="xdigitalsystems01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xdscorp.com/pages.asp?ID=1511|title=X-Digital Systems Inc.

'''Serge Latouche''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|t|uː|ʃ}}; {{IPA-fr|latuʃ|lang}}; born January 12, 1940) is a [[French people|French]] [[emeritus]] [[professor]] of [[economics]] at the [[University of Paris-Sud]]. He holds a degree in [[political sciences]], in [[philosophy]] and in economy.

==Work==
Latouche is a specialist in North-South economic and cultural relations, and in the epistemology of the social sciences. He has developed a critical theory towards economic orthodoxy. He denounces [[economism]], [[utilitarianism]] in social sciences, [[Consumerism|consumer society]] and the notion of [[sustainable development]]. He particularly criticizes the notions of [[economic efficiency]] and [[economic rationalism]]. He is one of the thinkers and most renowned partisans of the [[Degrowth|degrowth theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solutionslocales-lefilm.com/en/characters/serge-latouche] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426085712/http://www.solutionslocales-lefilm.com/en/characters/serge-latouche |date=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Latouche has also published in the ''[[Mouvement Anti-Utilitariste dans les Sciences Sociales|Revue du Mauss]]'', a French anti-utilitarian journal.

'''The Upuaut Project''' was a scientific exploration of the so-called "air shafts" of the [[Great Pyramid of Cheops]] at the [[Giza]] Plateau, which was built as a tomb for [[Fourth Dynasty]] pharaoh [[Khufu]]. It was managed by [[Rudolf Gantenbrink]] during three campaigns (two in 1992 and one in 1993). It involved sending a miniature mobile robot up the two shafts.

The Upuaut Project was the subject of a television documentary.

The project resulted in the finding of a "sealed block" at the end of the air shaft.

The research at the Great Pyramid is currently continued by the [[Djedi Project]] managed by experts of the [[Leeds University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drhawass.com/blog/djedi-team-robot Blog of] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103122844/http://www.drhawass.com/blog/djedi-team-robot |date=2014-11-03 }} dr.

The '''Three Towers of San Marino''' are a group of towers located in [[San Marino]]. Located on the three peaks of [[Monte Titano]] in the capital, also called [[San Marino, San Marino|San Marino]], they are depicted on both the [[Flag of San Marino|national flag]] and [[Coat of Arms of San Marino|coat of arms]]. 

== First Tower ==
The '''[[Guaita]]''' is the oldest of the three towers, and the most famous. It was constructed in the 11th century and served briefly as a prison.  It was rebuilt numerous times and reached its current form in the 15th century during the war fought between San Marino and the [[House of Malatesta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Tower (Guaita)|url=http://www.visitsanmarino.com/on-line/en/home/experience/arts-and-culture/scheda31097700.html|website=www.visitsanmarino.com|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second Tower ==
The '''[[Cesta]]'''  is located on the highest of Monte Titano's summits. A museum to honour [[Saint Marinus]], created in 1956, is located in this tower and showcases over 1,550 weapons dating from the Medieval Era to the modern day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of Historical Weapons|url=http://www.zainoo.com/en/italy/emilia-romagna/san-marino/museum-of-historical-weapons|website=www.zainoo.com|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was constructed in the 13th century on the remains of an older Roman fort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Tower (Cesta)|url=http://www.visitsanmarino.com/on-line/en/home/experience/arts-and-culture/scheda31097701.html|website=www.visitsanmarino.com|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third Tower ==
[[File:Montale.JPG|thumb|Montale]]
The '''[[Montale (San Marino)|Montale]]''' is located on the smallest of Monte Titano's summits. Unlike the other towers, this one is not open to the public. It was constructed in the 14th century. It is thought to have been constructed to give protection against the increasing power of the [[House of Malatesta|Malatesta]] family in that region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Montale (Third Tower)|url=http://www.zainoo.com/en/italy/emilia-romagna/san-marino/montale|website=www.zainoo.com|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also used as a prison, and accordingly, the only entrance to the tower is a door about seven metres from ground level, which was common for prison architecture of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terza Torre (Montale)|url=http://www.visitsanmarino.com/on-line/en/home/experience/arts-and-culture/scheda31097705.html|website=www.visitsanmarino.com|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31902">{{Nihongo|'''Tokyo International Conference on African Development''' (TICAD)|アフリカ開発会議|Afurika Kaihatsukaigi}} is a conference held regularly with the objective "to promote high-level policy dialogue between African leaders and development partners."  Japan is a co-host of these conferences.  Other  co-organizers of TICAD are the [[United Nations]] [[Office of the Special Advisor on Africa]] (UN-OSSA) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).&lt;ref name="mof1"&gt;Japan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs: 
[http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/africa/ticad/what.html What is TICAD?]&lt;/ref&gt;  The series has included: TICAD I (1993); TICAD II (1998); TICAD III (2003); TICAD IV (2008); TICAD V (2013). The next conference is scheduled for Kenya in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Kenya-to-host-Ticad/-/1056/2791492/-/b8wbgw/-/index.html Kenya to host TICAD July 16, 2015] ''[[Daily Nation]]'' Retrieved January 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It will be the first time the event will be held in Africa, previous conferences were all held in Japan.

TICAD has been an evolving element in Japan's long-term commitment to fostering peace and stability in Africa through [[collaborative partnerships]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1966/09/14/archives/japan-to-increase-asianafrican-aid.html?sq=Tokyo+International+Conference+on+African+Development+&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p  "Japan to Increase Asian-African Aid,"] 'New York Times.'' September 14, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, Japan has stressed the importance of "Africa's ownership" of its development as well as of the "partnership" between Africa and the international community.&lt;ref name="mof1"/&gt; The exchange of views amongst the conference delegates serves to underscore the case for more, not less assistance from the major world economies.&lt;ref name="dailymail29"&gt;Attah, Haruna.

May 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conference chronology==
The TICAD conferences were intended to help to promote high-level policy dialogue amongst African leaders and their development partners. It emerged in 1993 after the end of the Cold War in an era of 'aid fatigue' among donor countries, and was critical in regenerating strong donor interest in Africa.&lt;ref name="odi1"&gt;Tembo, Fletcher (2008) [http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/background-notes/0805-where-next-for-TICAD.pdf "Where next for TICAD: Building lasting partnerships"], London: Overseas Development Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; TICAD has evolved into a major global forum to promote development on the continent under the principles of African "ownership" and international "partnership."  These concepts became essential factors in the launch of the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development|New Economic Partnership for Africa's Development]] ([[NEPAD]]), a strategy for development designed by Africans themselves.&lt;ref name="ndn2008"&gt;Adisa, Banji.  [http://ndn.nigeriadailynews.com/templates/default.aspx?a=15183&amp;template=print-article.htm  "Japan to promote Africa's growth at Tokyo confab,"] ''Nigeria Daily News.'' March 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier TICAD meetings have also resulted in key outcomes, in particular when Japan is hosting the G8, as it is in 2008. In 2000, for example, Japan hosted the Okinawa G8 Summit and invited leaders from several African countries to attend. Ideas proposed at TICAD II were also taken up by the G8 in the creation of the [[Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]].&lt;ref name="odi1"/&gt;

==TICAD-I==
TICAD I was held in 1993. African countries and their development partners discussed strategies for steps toward greater African prosperity.&lt;ref name="mof1"/&gt;  TICAD was formed at a time when the international community’s interest in Africa was starting to wane, and donor fatigue was setting in.&lt;ref&gt;Blay, Gina. [http://www.modernghana.com/news/167140/1/japan-african-forum-begins.html  "Japan-African Forum Begins,"] ''Daily Guide'' (Accra). May 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  This conference produced the "Tokyo Declaration on African Development."&lt;ref&gt;Juma, Monica Kathina ''et al.'' (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=mjtcCyGjm1wC&amp;pg=PA491&amp;dq=TICAD&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=cWcy2XlgXHKXmUR7QmgCEgJrpXs#PPA491,M1  ''Compendium of Key Documents Relating to Peace and Security in Africa,'' p. 491]-505.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|TICAD-I Delegations}}
Delegations from 48 African nations participated in the conference, including four heads of state:&lt;ref&gt;Japan, MOFA: [http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/africa/ticad/list/africa.html  28 African nations]&lt;/ref&gt;  Twelve other nations sent delegations; and a number of international organizations also attended as delegates and as observers.

===Analysis===
The conference was considered promising, but prospects remained uncertain.  In the decades since that beginning, TICAD's quality has evolved in both complexity and quality.  The emphasis has shifted from TICAD-I's relatively simple issues of direct aid to more multi-faceted and inter-related topics which combine in sustainable development programs.&lt;ref name="cazzaniga1"&gt;Cazzaniga, Pino. [http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=12406&amp;size=A  "From TICAD IV, a new model for fostering African development,"] ''Asia News'' (PIME -- Pontificio Istituto Missioni Estere, Rome). June 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==TICAD-II==
TICAD II in 1998. African countries and their development partners agreed on the "Tokyo Agenda for Action" (TAA), which was intended to become a commonly understood strategic- and action-oriented set of guidelines.  Poverty reduction in Africa and Africa's fuller integration into the global economy were recognized a fundamental goals.&lt;ref name="mof1"/&gt;   Following the TICAD II, a 2001 ministerial conference provided opportunity to discuss NEPAD.&lt;ref name="ndn2008"/&gt;

{{Main article|TICAD-II Delegations}}
Invitations were extended to a number of African countries and others.  Some heads of state decided to attend; and a range of government ministers and others were amongst the participants in the conference.

===Analysis===
The agreement on an agenda was only considered a first step.

==TICAD-III==
TICAD III was held in 2003, bringing together over 1000 delegates, including 23 heads of state and the Chairperson of the [[African Union]].&lt;ref name="ndn2008"/&gt;  African countries and their development partners reviewed the achievements of the ten-year TICAD process, and there was discussion about future direction TICAD should take.&lt;ref name="mof1"/&gt; 
 
{{Main article|TICAD-III Delegations}}
Invitations were extended to a number of African countries and others.  Some heads of state decided to attend; and a range of government ministers and others were amongst the participants in the conference.

===Analysis===
The increase in numbers of heads of state attending signaled the modest acceptance of the forum as a potentially effective venue. Participants reaffirmed the contributions of the TICAD process to African development, noting its role in mobilizing the international community's interest and commitment to African development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200806030990.html  "Africa: TICAD Participants Resolve to Improve Food Security, Economic Growth,"] ''The News'' (Monrovia).

TICAD IV (May 2008) was convened in [[Yokohama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/africa/ticad/ticad4/index.html Japan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs]&lt;/ref&gt;   In its 15-year history, this was the first time the conference was convened in a city other than Tokyo. Yokohama was preparing to mark the 150th anniversary of the opening of the port and the 120th anniversary of the commencement of the City Administration. In this context, TICAD IV and the slogan, ''Yokohama Meets Africa'' were intended to underscore the international character of the port and city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japancorp.net/Article.Asp?Art_ID=18341  "Fourth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD IV) Sets Agenda for Hope and Opportunity,"] ''JCNnetwork'' (Japan's Corporate News). May 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|TICAD-IV Delegations}}
This was the most heavily attended of the four TICAD events.  Responding to the invitation were 51 African nations (all except Somalia), 17 African organisations, 12 Asian nations, 22 donor nations, and 55 international organizations, with a total of about 2,500 delegates.  These included 40 presidents or prime ministers of African countries, twice the number of those present at TICAD III (2003).&lt;ref name="cazzaniga1"/&gt;  Also in Yokohama were organizers associated with "official side events" and other participants in the conference.

TICAD IV consisted of plenary sessions and twenty-four "thematic" sessions.&lt;ref&gt;SANGONet: [http://www.sangonet.org.za/portal/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=9467&amp;Itemid=1  "NGOs Frustration at TICAD IV in Japan."] May 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  TICAD focused on strategies for better mobilizing the knowledge and resources of the international community in the core areas of: (a) economic growth; (b) human security, including achieving the UN's [[Millennium Development Goals]]; and (c) environment/climate change issues.  In addition, TICAD IV tried to identify possible inter-linkages within the context of the [[G8]] [[34th G8 summit|Hokkaidō Tōyako Summit]] in July 2008.&lt;ref name="mof2"&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/economy/summit/2008/info/theme.html main themes of G* summit]&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, World Bank and International Monetary Fund Development Committee Executive Secretary, [[Kiyoshi Kodera]], spoke at a pre-event meeting in which he argued that everyone needs to "accept the harsh reality" that [[sub-Saharan Africa]]n countries will remain heavily dependent on foreign aid until they find a new growth path.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,date:2008-05-27~menuPK:34461~pagePK:34392~piPK:64256810~theSitePK:4607,00.html  "Fukuda begins marathon talks with African leaders ahead of TICAD,"] World Bank ''News &amp; Broadcast.'' May 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attending the conference were representatives of the [[World Bank]], the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), a number of donor countries, [[non-governmental organisations]] (NGOs) and other relevant agencies.&lt;ref name="ndn2008"/&gt; The shared perspectives of the conference delegates served to underscore the case for immediate assistance to help Africa’s vulnerable economies to weather the global food and fuel crisis.&lt;ref name="dailymail29"/&gt;  Participants agreed that emergency food aid was necessary, but it was also necessary to carry out medium-to-long-term interventions, with special attention on the division of roles and complementarity among various development agencies.&lt;ref name=
"AfDB1"&gt;[http://www.afdb.org/portal/page?_pageid=293,174339&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL&amp;press_item=30732271&amp;press_lang=us  "Bank Group Participates in TICAD IV,"] African Development Bank (Tunis). June 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller scale projects were also included in the TICAD agenda. The Japanese introduced a projected JICA investment in replicating the "[[One Village One Product movement]]" ([[OVOP]]) in African contexts.  In this context, the President of Malawi's visit to Japan also included a visit to OVOP headquarters in Osaka.&lt;ref&gt;Khunga, Suzgo.  [http://www.dailytimes.bppmw.com/article.asp?ArticleID=9675  "Malawi could be OVOP headquarters,"] ''Daily Times'' (Lilongwe, Malawi). May 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Making a difference===
In a speech delivered at TICAD-IV, Japanese Prime Minister [[Yasuo Fukuda]] committed the government to extending yen-denominated loans worth up to ¥415-billion (US$4-billion) and financial assistance totalling about ¥260-billion (US$2.5-billion) over the next five years.  Fukuda also committed the government to establishing a fund at the [[Japan Bank for International Cooperation]] aimed at doubling investment in Africa. The financial assistance would be provided through the fund over the next five years to help develop road networks and other traffic infrastructure.  The Japanese Prime Minister also announced plans to deploy a "water defense force" tasked with providing instruction in water management.  Moreover, Fukuda explained that his government aimed to help foster as many as 100,000 experts in the health and medicine fields.&lt;ref name="ys1"&gt;[http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20080525TDY01304.htm  "Fukuda to promise aid, loan package for Africa,"] ''Yomiuri Shimbun.'' May 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fukuda's announcement that Japan would extend generous assistance to African countries in spite of its tight financial condition is aimed at burnishing Japan's credentials in the international community.&lt;ref name="ys1"/&gt;  Prime Minister Fukuda's speech was designed to strengthen Japan's leadership as host of the G-8 meeting because aid to Africa would be an important item on the meeting's agenda. Another reason for the government's magnanimity is that Japan is trying to strengthen its relations with African countries to win their support for its bid to gain a permanent seat on the UN [[Security Council]].  The Japanese government learned a lesson from the failure of its 2005 campaign for permanent membership at the Security Council: Support from African countries, which account for one-fourth of U.N. membership, is construed as indispensable if Japan is to succeed in its bid.  In his speech, Fukuda said, "Japan would like to work on U.N. Security Council reform in cooperation with its African friends." &lt;ref name="ys1"/&gt;

Fukuda's actions during TICAD attracted media attention for what some journalists called the "marathon of mini-summits."  In two days, the 71-year-old Prime Minister of Japan met one by one with 40 leaders of African nations, dedicating approximately twenty minutes to each one;&lt;ref name="cazzaniga1"/&gt; and he also met with seven private sector Africa supporters.&lt;ref name="k31"&gt;Kawakami, Osamu. [http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/world/20080531TDY04305.htm  "China rivalry marks TICAD IV; Government seeks African support on climate change, UN Security Council membership,"] ''Daily Yomiuri.'' May 31, 1008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the Economy, Trade and Industry Minister, Akira Amari, met with African leaders in an effort to work towards developing closer relationships with countries participating in the conference.&lt;ref name="yomiuri30"&gt;Tabuch, Hideharu. [http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/business/20080530TDY04304.htm  "Government securing future resources; Fukuda, Amari meet with African leaders to shore up ties for procurement,"] ''Yomiuri Shimbun.'' May 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; During TICAD week, Amari met with the leaders of Angola, Gabon and Uganda on Tuesday and Wednesday (May 27–28).  Amari met with the leaders of Madagascar, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa and Namibia on Thursday (May 29); and he met on Friday (May 30) with the leader of Nigeria.  These Africa leaders are mainly exporters of resources necessary for manufacturers in Japan. For example, Nigeria is the biggest oil producer in Africa, and Angola has promising oil reserves. South Africa produces [[zirconium]] that is used for nuclear fuel rods, while the Democratic Republic of Congo produces [[cobalt]], which is used by many industries for various purposes.&lt;ref name="yomiuri30"/&gt;

===Analysis===

Japan has long used aid as a key diplomatic tool. It was the world's top donor in 1991, but its overall assistance has been slipping as its debts increased. As China and India seeking to forge closer ties with the African continent, the conference is a key opportunity for Japan to maintain its diplomatic clout.  According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Africa accounts for 89 percent of the world's total reserves of platinum, 60 percent of its diamonds, 53 percent of the cobalt, 37 percent of the zirconium and 34 percent of the chrome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2008/05/25/3464646.htm  "Opportunity to knock on Japan's door at TICAD, Gabon envoy says,"] ''Japan Times.'' May 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The African continent remains a potential markets for Japan; and both China and India recognized an urgent need to secure commodities to fuel their economic booms.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC): [http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200805/s2254943.htm?tab=latest  "Japan to host African conference,"] May 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, the [[Forum on China-Africa Cooperation]] (FOCAC) in 2006 can be said to have marked a watershed for Africa’s economic relations.&lt;ref name="k31"/&gt;  The summit re-awakened the world’s major powers not only to China’s growing strategic influence in Africa but also highlighted Africa’s increasing importance.&lt;ref&gt;Munyi, Elijah. [http://politics.nationmedia.com/inner.asp?sid=1881  "Summits and the myth of one Africa,"] ''Kenya Today.'' May 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, China has been providing large-scale assistance to African countries with the aim of securing a stake in the rich natural resources in the African continent; and India has been doing the same.&lt;ref name="ys1"/&gt;

The conference provided a venue for non-governmental entities to expand a range of high-level contacts.  In addition to the World Bank, an [[African Development Bank]] (AfDB) group delegation led by the institution's president, [[Donald Kaberuka]], attended TICAD-IV.  Also amongst the 2,500 attendees were academics, such as the president of [[Tsukuba University]] in Japan and Nobel laureate [[Joseph Stiglitz]] of [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=
"AfDB1"/&gt;

There were instances when the conference did not go as Japan expected.  For instance, the Japanese government planned to include a statement in the Yokohama Declaration to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent from current levels by 2050. However, the government withdrew this provision after encountering fierce opposition from South Africa, a major polluter.&lt;ref name="k31"/&gt;

TICAD summits underscore the importance Asian economic and political competitors place in getting on the right side of African leaders - many of whom are sitting on huge mineral, oil and other resources. Africa is also emerging as a last frontier for financial investors. The continent also offers a growing market for low-end manufactured goods that are no longer exportable to the developed countries of Europe and America.&lt;ref name="allafrica.com"&gt;Wa Ngai, Mbatau. [http://allafrica.com/stories/200806030298.html  "Africa: Continent Should Negotiate Jointly With Asians,"] ''The Monitor'' (Kampala). June 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''African perspective'''&lt;br&gt;
African delegates arrived in Yokohama with a number of their own well-thought out agendas. Some voices argued that it would be better if Africa attended TICAD-V (2013) with a continental-wide agenda which could then be broken up into country-specific strategies which could be more fully explored during the subsequent bilateral meetings.  Drawing up a common agenda detailing the trade and investment issues would seem a plausible strategy because the nations of the continent are grappling with similar challenge which include poor infrastructure and trade terms that are weighted heavily against Africa.&lt;ref name="allafrica.com"/&gt;  In a sense, Thabo Mbeki embraced this continental strategy as he suggested that Africa's future economic growth should happen through trade and not aid. Mbeki said, "Without discounting the importance of aid, improved terms of trade for Africa are critical to ensure its full integration into the global economy."&lt;ref&gt;Gomes, Vijay.

May 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also observed that "market access alone does not always translate in the ability for the developing countries to penetrate competitive world markets."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=4425647  "Japanese prime minister pledges billions to Africa,"] ''The Star'' (Johannesburg).

===Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize===
The two initial [[Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize]]s were conferred in conjunction with TICAD IV.  This prize was created in honor of [[Hideyo Noguchi]], a prominent Japanese [[bacteriologist]] who discovered the agent of [[syphilis]] in 1911,&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Julius H. and A. Levinson. [https://books.google.com/books?id=bjgSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=hideyo+noguchi&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a "Clinic of Drs. Julius H. Hess and A. Levinson; The Luetin Test," ''International Clinics: A Quarterly.'' Vol.3, No. 28 (1918), p. 89]-95.&lt;/ref&gt; and who died in Africa while working towards the development of a vaccine for virulent [[yellow fever]].&lt;ref&gt;National Diet Library: [http://www.ndl.go.jp/portrait/e/datas/312.html?c=26 Noguchi bio and image]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first awards of the [[Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize]] were planned to coincide with TICAD IV;&lt;ref&gt;Japan, Cabinet Office: [http://www.cao.go.jp/noguchisho/english/keii/keii.html Noguchi Prize, chronology]&lt;/ref&gt; and the conference venue was moved from Tokyo to Yokohama as another way of honoring the man after whom the prize was named.  In 1899, Dr. Noguchi worked at the Yokohama Port Quarantine Office as an assistant quarantine doctor.&lt;ref&gt;Hideyo Noguchi Memorial Museum: [http://www.town.inawashiro.fukushima.jp/eng/main_eng_noguchi.html Noguchi, life events] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824071844/http://www.town.inawashiro.fukushima.jp/eng/main_eng_noguchi.html |date=2010-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first laureates of the Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize, like Noguchi himself, are both medical doctors with a career-long interest in epidemiology and public health. They are Dr. [[Brian Greenwood]] and Dr. [[Miriam Were]].&lt;ref&gt;Japan, Cabinet Office: [http://www.cao.go.jp/noguchisho/gaiyo-e.html  Noguchi Prize, fact sheet.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506064444/http://www.cao.go.jp/noguchisho/gaiyo-e.html |date=2008-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the honorees, the Prize represents both an acknowledgement of their past accomplishments and an investment in their prospective contributions in the years ahead.  Japanese Prime Minister, Yasuo Fukuda, made the actual award presentation; and the Emperor and Empress were present at the 2008 ceremony along with a large number of African heads of state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uzimafoundation.org/main/2008/05/29/mama-miriam-receives-the-hideyo-noguchi-prize/  "Mama Miriam receives the Hideyo Noguchi Prize,"] UZIMA Foundation News. May 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

With significantly large money prizes attending this award, the Noguchi Prize already rivals the major established scientific awards.&lt;ref&gt;Japan, Cabinet Office: [http://www.cao.go.jp/noguchisho/makgoba-comment-e.pdf  Noguchi Prize, analysis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327071502/http://www.cao.go.jp/noguchisho/makgoba-comment-e.pdf |date=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the outset, the 2008 Noguchi Prizes—consisting of a citation, a medal and an honorarium of 100 million yen (US$843,668) -- were only intended to be the first in a continuing series; and subsequent prizes are expected to be awarded every five years.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.afro.who.int/press/2007/pr20070430.html  Noguchi Prize, WHO/AFRO involved] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130024613/http://www.afro.who.int/press/2007/pr20070430.html |date=2010-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The prize, officially named "The Prize in Recognition of Outstanding Achievements in the Fields of Medical Research and Medical Services in Africa Awarded in Memory of Dr. Hideyo Noguchi," is managed by [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]] (JICA).&lt;ref name="ndn2008"/&gt;

==TICAD-V==
As TICAD-IV ended, plans were already being formulated for TICAD-V in June 2013.  Prime Minister Fukuda Announced told delegates at TICAD-IV, "I pledge that by 2012-five years from now-Japan will have doubled its official development assistance (ODA) to Africa, increasing it gradually over these years."  At the same time, Fukuda said his government would double its grand aid and technical cooperation for Africa by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Manalo, Komfie. [http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7011088567  "Japan Doubles Loans To Africa To $4 Billion,"] AHN News. May 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

TICAD-V was held in [[Yokohama]] 1–3 June 2013&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ticad.net/ticadv/&lt;/ref&gt; and forty-one African heads of state, along with UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki Moon]] and World Bank President [[Jim Yong Kim]], attended. Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]] opened the conference by announcing a five-year $32 billion package to support infrastructure development and boost economic growth in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphic.com.gh/General-News/32bn-japanese-pledge-as-ticad-v-opens.html $32bn Japanese pledge as TICAD V opens], Graphic Online, 2 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis===
The conference ended as one of the largest summit meetings ever held in Japan with the participants totaling more than 4,500, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Minister for Foreign Affairs Fumio Kishida, as well as representatives from 51 African countries including 39 heads of state and government, delegates from 31 development partner countries and Asian nations, 72 international and regional organizations, the private sector, NGOs and civil society. In addition, a variety of side events were held with much attendance from the public. TICAD V upheld the core message of "Hand in Hand with a More Dynamic Africa." Under the concept, active discussions were conducted on the future of African development, centering on the main themes of TICAD V, namely "Robust and Sustainable Economy," "Inclusive and Resilient Society," and "Peace and Stability."As an outcome, TICAD V adopted two outcome documents, namely, "Yokohama Declaration 2013," presenting a future direction for African development, and "Yokohama Action Plan 2013–2017," a road map for the TICAD Process over the next five years with specific measures.

Since TICAD V, Japan has actively deployed its diplomacy toward Africa in order to maintain the momentum and to steadily implement its pledges. For example, the Japan–African Regional Economic Communities (RECs) Summit Roundtable was held in New York on the margins of the UN General Assembly on September 26, 2013, chaired by Prime Minister Abe. In the roundtable, participants exchanged views on agricultural development and food security. In addition, from November 24 to December 5, 2013, Japan dispatched a Public and Private Sector Joint Mission for Promoting Trade and Investment for Africa to the Republic of the Congo, the Gabonese Republic, and Côte d'Ivoire. Thus, Japan hopes to further develop its relations with Africa through such follow-up measures to TICAD V. Furthermore, Prime Minister Abe visited three African countries in January 2014, fulfilling his promise at TICAD V to visit Africa in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/other/bluebook/2014/html/chapter2/cp2_sf2.html Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan]&lt;/ref&gt;

TICAD VI will be the first TICAD to be held in Africa. Kenya and Gambia had bid for the chance to hold it, but Gambia withdrew to allow Kenya to win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Kenya-to-host-major-Japanese-investment-forum-TICAD/-/539546/2791480/-/95ih07z/-/index.html Kenya to host 2016 Tokyo meet on African development July 16, 2015] ''[[Business Daily Africa]]'' Retrieved January 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201508310999.html Africa: Kenya Will Host the First Ticad Meeting in Africa in 2016 August 31, 2015] ''[[AllAfrica.com]]'' Retrieved January 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It will be held in Nairobi and 5,000 delegates are expected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.co.ke/business/5-000-delegates-expected-in-Nairobi-for-Tokyo-global-forum/-/996/2841472/-/v2skl2/-/index.html 5,000 delegates expected in Nairobi for Tokyo global forum August 21, 2015] ''[[Daily Nation]]'' Retrieved January 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
