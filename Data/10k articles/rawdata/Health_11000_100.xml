      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19339">The '''1950 Wynder and Graham Study''' was conducted by [[Ernst Wynder|Ernest Wynder]] and [[Evarts Ambrose Graham|Evarts Graham]] and was entitled "Tobacco Smoking as a Possible Etiologic Factor in Bronchiogenic Carcinoma: A Study of Six Hundred and Eighty-Four Proved Cases". It was published on May 27, 1950.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;''Tobacco Smoking As A Possible Etiologic Factor In Bronchiogenic Carcinoma''. 4th ed., vol. 143, The Journal of the American Medical Association, pp. 329–336, ''Tobacco Smoking As A Possible Etiologic Factor In Bronchiogenic Carcinoma'', www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2623809/pdf/15744408.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a [[case-control study]] to determine the relationship between various external factors and the development of [[bronchogenic carcinoma]].  The study concluded that long-term [[tobacco]] usage contributes to the onset of [[lung cancer]], as an overwhelming majority (96.5%) of the men with the disease were classified as moderate to heavy smokers for an extended period of time, compared to a lower percentage of the general hospital population control group.

== Context ==
Studies conducted before smoking and lung cancer were scientifically related connected a higher rate of smoking to lung cancer incidence, and eventually mortality 20 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wynder|first=Ernst L.|date=1988|title=Tobacco and Health: A Review of the History and Suggestions for Public Health Policy|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1477945/pdf/pubhealthrep00172-0010.pdf|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=103|issue=1|pages=8–17|pmc=1477945}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1775, [[Percivall Pott]]’s discovery of the high incidence of [[scrotum|scrotal]] cancer in [[chimney sweep]]s demonstrated that charred organic substances were [[carcinogenic]].  Wynder used Pott’s research as a foundation for his argument that his hypothesis that smoking leads to the development of lung cancer was biologically valid.&lt;ref&gt;Wynder, E. L. “Tobacco as a Cause of Lung Cancer: Some Reflections.” ''American Journal of Epidemiology'', vol. 146, no. 9, Jan. 1997, pp. 687–694., doi:10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009342.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1912, Isaac Adler connected the rise in primary lung cancer to consumption of cigarettes because of the different smoking habits of men and women.  Men experienced higher incidences of lung cancer and also smoked much more than women.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;“Historical Perspective: Tobacco and Cancer.” ''AACR'', American Association for Cancer Research, www.aacr.org/AdvocacyPolicy/GovernmentAffairs/Documents/Historical_Perspective_Tobacco_and_Cancer___E086A2.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other early researchers include: Joseph Bloodgood (1921) who demonstrated a link between [[tongue cancer]] and tobacco, founder of the [[American Cancer Society]] Frederick Hoffman (1924) who proved excessive smoking caused cancer development in the mouth and lungs, and Morton Lenvin (1950) who analyzed hospital data to show the positive correlation between tobacco and lung cancer (1950).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Despite this growing evidence linking tobacco usage to lung cancer, in 1950 the scientific consensus was that lung cancer was caused by industrial and automotive polluters.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Lopez, A D. “Measuring the health hazards of tobacco: Commentary.” Review of ''Smoking and Carcinoma of the Lung''. ''World Health Organization: Public Health Classics'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Richard Doll]], a prominent scientist who conducted the [[British Doctors Study]] with [[Austin Bradford Hill]] in 1951, theorized that smoking was not considered an obvious factor because everyone participated in it, yet not everyone developed lung cancer.  Scientists believed many other factors were responsible for the development of lung cancer, such as [[automobile exhaust]], [[coal]] fumes, infectious diseases, race, and better diagnostic technologies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Rigdon RH, Kirchoff H: Cancer of the lung from 1900 to 1930. Surg Gynecol Obstet 107::105,1958-118|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, it was deemed unlikely that a single preventable factor, such as smoking, could alone cause such a complicated outcome like cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Mukherjee, Siddhartha. ''Emperor of all maladies: a biography of cancer''. Thorndike Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fifty years leading up to the Wynder and Graham study, lung cancer was observed to have risen dramatically and disproportionately in comparison to other cancers. From the 1920s to 1950, the year of the study's publication, deaths from lung cancer had quadrupled so now it was the leading cancer found in men.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wynder|first=E L|date=1988|title=Tobacco and health: a review of the history and suggestions for public health policy.|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=103|issue=1|pages=8–18|issn=0033-3549|pmc=1477945|pmid=3124202}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This follows the upward trend of smoking that peaked 20 years prior due to its social pervasiveness, global association with glamour and camaraderie, and the heavy influence of the [[Tobacco industry|Tobacco Industry]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Brandt, Allan M. ''The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product That Defined America''. Basic Books, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ernst Wynder was a medical student when he came up with the idea to link smoking with cancer when he witnessed the blackened lungs of a man with lung cancer and later learned that he was a heavy smoker.  Wynder sought the assistance of Evarts Graham, a [[thoracic surgeon]] and head of the surgery department.  Although Graham did not believe in the increased risk of lung cancer from smoking, as he smoked excessively, he enabled Wynder to conduct a case-control study by providing subjects with lung cancer to interview.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Thun, Michael J. ''&lt;nowiki&gt;Http://Www.princeton.edu/~Sswang/WHO_lung-Cancer-Smoking-History.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;''. World Health Organization, 2005, pp. 144–145, ''&lt;nowiki&gt;Http://Www.princeton.edu/~Sswang/WHO_lung-Cancer-Smoking-History.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1948, Wynder began distributing questionnaires at Bellevue Hospital asking individual habits, such as smoking, and by 1949 he had data from over 200 patients that proved smoking and lung cancer were correlated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  When these findings were presented at the American Cancer Society 1949 national meeting, the lack of audience response reflected a dismissal of smoking as a causal factor for lung cancer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The 1950 Wynder and Graham Study was the first large-scale study to investigate link between smoking and cancer.  It differed from previous studies because of the size of the test group, and clear, statistically-significant results.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4843bx.htm|title=Ernst L. Wynder, M.D.|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The objective of this research was to design a clinical study to assess multiple external factors in the onset of bronchogenic carcinoma, and which activities or predisposed determinants increase risk for lung cancer.

== Study Design ==
This study was a retrospective, case-control study that compared smoking habits of 684 individuals with bronchogenic carcinoma to those without the condition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The survey included questions about smoking: starting age, 20 year tobacco consumption, brands used; as well as inquires about exposure to hazardous agents in the workplace, alcohol use, and causes of death for family members.  Researchers obtained information through “special interviews” with patients from hospitals across the nation.  Since hospital records provided insufficient information for the scope of this study, trained staff interviewed 634 patients, and the remaining subjects were either mailed the survey or had a close contact answer on their behalf.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  In addition to current smoking habits, surveys asked about patients' smoking habits for the last 20 years due to the hypothesis of delayed emergence of cancer in smokers.  Below is a list of the questions on the etiologic survey:&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;
# Have you ever had a lung diseases?  If so, state time, duration and site of disease.
# Do you or did you ever smoke?
# At what age did you begin to smoke? 
# At what age did you stop smoking?
# How much tobacco did you average per day during the past 20 years of your smoking? (Cigarettes . . . Cigars . . . Pipes . . .)
# Do you inhale the smoke? 
# Do you have a chronic cough which you attribute to your smoking, especially upon first smoking in the morning?  If so, for how long? 
# Do you smoke before or after breakfast?
# Name the brand(s) and dates if any given brand has been smoked exclusively for more than five years.
# What kind of jobs have you held? Have you been exposed to dust or fumes while working there?
# Have you ever been exposed to irritative dusts or fumes outside of your job? In particular have you ever used insecticide spray excessively? If so, state time and duration.
# How much alcohol do you or have you averaged per day? State time and duration in years (Whiskey . . . Beer . . . Wine . . .)
# Where were you born and where have you lived most of your life? State the approximate time span you have lived in a certain locality. Up to what grade did you attend school?
# State the cause of death of your parents, and of brothers and sisters if any.
# Site of lesion, microscopic diagnosis, papanicolaou class, etiological class
(Note: questions above were reproduced from Table 1: "Etiologic Survey" of Wynder and Graham's study)

Subjects were classified into two categories: cases, those with [[bronchogenic carcinoma]], and controls, those without the condition.  There were 605 microscopic confirmations of the disease.  The "general hospital population" group consisted of 780 men and 552 women without cancer.  Furthermore, control studies were added to minimize bias from interviewers, and the compare the incidence of lung cancer with exposure to other factors among the different groups.  Control study 1 included 100 men with lung cancer and 186 with other chest diseases, and its interviewers were not affiliated with the hospitals and did not know patients' diagnoses.  Control study II involved 83 individuals with lung cancer and involved a similar survey administered by doctors who were not under the oversight of these researchers.  Finally, the researchers equated the age distributions of lung cancer and non-cancer groups.  The total percentage of patients with cancer in a particular age group was used as a benchmark to adjust the percentages of nonsmokers.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

To organize the data, smokers were classified as nonsmokers, light, moderately heavy, heavy, excessive, and chain.  Individuals in the study were evaluated based on average daily consumption of cigarettes, age, history of disease, and occupation - the latter two to avoid confounding variables.  Researchers wondered if there was a connection between an increased consumption of cigarettes for a longer period of time and a higher prevalence of lung cancer in these individuals, excluding [[adenocarcinoma]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=77(1)82.pdf|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/77(1)82.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wynder and Graham study was significant due to the segmentation of risk groups by quantity smoked and the period of tobacco usage.  Also, this study sought to reduce [[confounding variables]] and [[selection bias]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Results and Major Findings ==
The key finding of the study was that of the men in the study, men with lung cancer were more likely to be long-term smokers than those without the disease.  Thus, researchers concluded that smoking is responsible for the onset of bronchogenic carcinoma, but did not establish a causal relationship between smoking cigarettes and developing lung cancer.  There was also an evident dose-response relationship: as average daily cigarette consumption increased, so did the amount of people with lung cancer as opposed to ones without the disease.  Additionally, cigarette usage was shown to contribute to the development of other forms of cancer and heart disease&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bach|first=Peter B.|date=2009-02-04|title=Smoking as a Factor in Causing Lung Cancer|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/183306|journal=JAMA|language=en|volume=301|issue=5|pages=539–41|doi=10.1001/jama.2009.57|pmid=19190320|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the control studies conducted by "third party" physicians exhibit corresponding results to the data gathered by researchers.

Concerning age distributions, 2.3% with lung cancer were younger than 40 years of age, meanwhile 79.3% were older than 50.  In the general hospital population, 14.6% were nonsmokers, but there were only 1.3% nonsmokers within the lung cancer group.  Likewise, 54.7% in the general hospital group classify themselves as heavy and chain smokers, whereas 86.4% in the lung cancer group smoke the same amount.  Also, when focusing on the excessive smokers subset, there is a 32.1% difference in excessive smokers in the lung cancer group and general hospital group.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Researchers assessed different methods of smoking, such as cigarette, pipe, and cigar.  They found that almost all smokers consumed cigarettes, 4% smoked pipes, and 3.5% smoked cigars.  When polling for inhalation, they discovered cigarette smoke is inhaled more often than that of cigars or pipes.  Also, women smoke a lot less than men, and there was not enough data to link smoking to lung cancer in these cases.  Therefore, Wynder conducted separate study on women in 1956.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Final Conclusions ==
The study concluded that 96.5% of men with bronchogenic carcinoma were heavy to chain smokers, compared to 73.7% of the general population.  Statistically, it was rare to find cases of epidermoid or undifferentiated carcinoma in males who haven’t been heavy smokers.  Moreover, 96.1% of people with lung cancer smoked for over 20 years, which leads the researchers to hypothesize a 10-year or more lag time between starting smoking and exhibiting the first signs of cancer.  Since the overwhelming majority of smokers smoked cigarettes and more cigarette users inhale, this was thought to be a factor in developing lung cancer at a higher rate.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Most importantly, the study proved a [[Dose–response relationship|dose-dependent]] relationship.  Subjects who developed lung cancer smoked more excessively and for a more prolonged period of time than individuals who did not develop the disease.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Impact ==
The Wynder and Graham 1950 study was able to conclude that "smoking was an important factor in the production of bronchogenic carcinoma," but smoking wasn't established as a causal factor until four years later, when Wynder published another paper entitled, "Tobacco as a Cause of Lung Cancer"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The same year Wynder and Graham published their findings, Doll and Hill conducted their own case-control study that reaffirmed smoking raises the chance of developing lung cancer.  Several major studies were published three quarters of a year apart in 1950 that reached the same conclusion: smoking is related to lung cancer.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Public outrage immediately following these papers was underwhelming.  In fact, both the scientific and medical sectors cast doubt on the findings, characterizing these study results as controversial.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Doll theorized that this state of denial was due to the ubiquity of smoking, and consequently, the public dismissed the dangers of cigarettes since not everyone who smoked developed lung cancer.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Additionally, the tobacco industry obscured and distorted these scientific conclusions to dissuade public recognition of the harmful results of smoking, and denied causal link between cigarettes and lung cancer.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  The tobacco industry appealed to people's desire for freedom and opposition to paternalism.  It conveyed the message that the decision to smoke should be left to each individual: in America the government does not have the authority to dictate each person's lifestyle choices.

In 1962, the Surgeon General Luther Terry assembled a task force to review the evidence.  Two years later, he released the 1964 ''[[Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the United States]],'' which stated that smoking is a definitive causal factor for lung cancer in men and a probable cause in women.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  As a result, statistics indicate that the public took notice of this health advisory, since smoking decreased by 5% several months following the report.&lt;ref&gt;Warner KE.Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Congressional action followed during the next several years with the Federal [[Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act]] of 1965 and the [[Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act]] of 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080305012949/http://tobaccodocuments.org/atc/71066088.html “Tobacco Documents Online.” ''Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969'', 23 Nov. 1998, web.archive.org/web/20080305012949/http://tobaccodocuments.org/atc/71066088.html.]&lt;/ref&gt;  This legislation resulted in health warnings on cigarette boxes, and prevention of broadcast cigarette advertisements.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Additionally, in 1983 the federal cigarette tax doubled (the last cigarette tax increase occurred over 30 years earlier to support the Korean War).&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Preventing Nicotine Addiction in Children and Youths. “TOBACCO TAXATION IN THE UNITED STATES.” ''Growing up Tobacco Free: Preventing Nicotine Addiction in Children and Youths.'', U.S. National Library of Medicine, 1 Jan. 1994, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236771/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Irish pork crisis of 2008''' was a [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxin]] contamination incident in Ireland that led to an international recall of pork products from Ireland produced between September and early December of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aol.com.au/news/story/Ireland-warns-public-not-to-eat-Irish-pork/1405671/index.html |title=Ireland warns public not to eat Irish pork |date=7 December 2008 |accessdate=6 December 2008 |publisher=[[AOL|AOL Australia]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214163443/http://www.aol.com.au/news/story/Ireland-warns-public-not-to-eat-Irish-pork/1405671/index.html |archivedate=14 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was disclosed in early December 2008 that contaminated [[compound feed|animal feed]] supplied by one Irish manufacturer to thirty-seven beef farms and nine pig farms across [[Republic of Ireland]], and eight beef farms and one dairy farm in [[Northern Ireland]], had caused the contamination of pork with between 80 and 200 times the [[European Union|EU]]'s recommended limit for [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]] and dioxin-like [[polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] ''i.e.'' 0.2 [[Nanogram#SI multiples|ng]]/g [[Toxic equivalency factor#TEQ|TEQ]] fat (0.2 [[Parts per billion|ppb]]).&lt;ref name="EFSA PDF"/&gt; The [[Food Safety Authority of Ireland]] moved on 6 December to recall from the market all Irish pork products dating from 1 September 2008 to that date. The contaminated feed that was supplied to forty-five beef farms across the island was judged to have caused no significant public health risk, accordingly no recall of beef was ordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1209/breaking67.htm |title=Farmers urge consumers to continue buying beef – The Irish Times – Tue, Dec 09, 2008 |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date= 12 December 2008|accessdate=12 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also affected was a dairy farm in Northern Ireland; some milk supplies were withdrawn from circulation.

Within days thousands of jobs were either lost or under threat at pig processing plants across the country, as processors refused to resume slaughter of pigs until they received financial compensation.

On the evening of 6 December, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland ordered the recall, withdrawal and destruction of all Irish pork products dating back to 1 September. It was announced that "dioxins &amp; dioxin like PCBs", a group of highly toxic synthetic [[halogenated]] organic compounds, had been discovered in pork at levels between 80 and 200 times the [[European Union|EU]]'s recommended safety limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/national-news/recall-of-all-pork-in-public-health-alert-1566236.html|title=Recall of all pork in public health alert|date=6 December 2008|accessdate=6 December 2008|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv3.ie/article.php?article_id=4739&amp;locID=1.2.&amp;pagename=news |title=Irish pork recalled over contamination fears |date=7 December 2008 |accessdate=7 December 2008 |publisher=[[TV3 Ireland]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115210816/http://www.tv3.ie/article.php?article_id=4739&amp;locID=1.2.&amp;pagename=news |archivedate=15 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This contamination, which was first realised on 1 December, came about as a result of contamination of pig feed. The positive results for dioxins and dioxin like PCBs were confirmed on the afternoon of 6 December and announced within hours. The Irish general public were advised to destroy all their purchased pork products as Ireland's [[Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine|Department of Agriculture]] and the Food Safety Authority had initiated an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1206/breaking38.html |title=Investigation after toxic substance found in pigs |author=Conor Pope |work=The Irish Times |date=6 December 2008 |accessdate=7 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009125507/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1206/breaking38.html |archivedate=9 October 2012 }} and {{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/national-news/farm-contaminant-alert-1566196.html|title=Farm contaminant alert|date=6 December 2008|accessdate=6 December 2008|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; who describe the clinical manifestations of two extremely severe (and probably [[History of poison|criminal]]) dioxin poisoning cases.

Much of the hazard posed by dioxins and PCBs comes from their [[Persistent organic pollutant|environmental persistence]] and their [[lipophilic]] nature, resulting their propensity to accumulate in the [[food chain]], particularity in the fat of animals. About 80% of human exposure to dioxins and PCBs comes from animal derived foods ''e.g.'' poultry, beef and dairy.&lt;ref name="Europa"/&gt; However, the health effects and risks of long-term, low-level exposure to the general public cannot be observed directly, and are highly controversial. It is not known if the [[Dose-response relationship|dose response]] relationship at low-levels of exposure is sub-linear or [[Linear no-threshold model|linear]], or has a [[Threshold model|threshold]] ''i.e.'' harmless at very low levels.&lt;ref name="NationalAcademies"/&gt; Risk assessments are further complicated by the observation that contamination typically involves a complex mixture of [[PCB Congener List|related chemicals]], the toxicity of each varies and has to be factored according to its Toxic Equivalency Factor (TEF) (where [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|TCDD]] = 1). The product of TEF is the [[Toxic equivalency factor#TEQ|Toxic Equivalent Quantity]] (TEQ), and it is this value that is used in risk assessments (an on-line [http://www.gcisolutions.com/teq.html Toxic Equivalency Quantity Calculator]).

The [[European Union]] (EU) uses a [[Linear no-threshold model|linear]] dose response curve at low-levels of exposure, below the point where there are [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] data. In other words, the EU assumes there is ''no'' safe level of dioxins and PCBs.&lt;ref name="Europa"/&gt; Accordingly, the European Union sets extremely stringent limits for dioxin and dioxin like PCBs in food, set just above the usual background levels found in various food categories ''e.g.'' fish, poultry, beef, pork etc. The limit set for dioxins in pork fat and meat is 1 [[Kilogram#SI multiples|pg]]/g TEQ ''i.e.'' 1 [[Parts-per notation|parts per trillion (ppt)]] (see swimming pool illustration). The maximum dioxin contamination measured in Irish pork was 0.2 [[Kilogram#SI multiples|ng]]/g TEQ fat (200 [[Parts per trillion|ppt]]),&lt;ref name="EFSA PDF"/&gt; equivalent to dispersing 10 drops of [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|TCDD]] throughout a 2.5 million litre [[Long course|Olympic sized]] swimming pool.

===The Irish pork industry===
The pork industry is the fourth biggest in Ireland's agriculture sector, worth around €400 million per year to the Irish economy. The country's farms produce over 3 million pigs per annum, almost 50% of which are consumed within the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/world/europe/07pork.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|title=Ireland Investigating Tainted Pork|date=7 December 2008|accessdate=7 December 2008|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder is exported, heavily to the neighbouring territories of Northern Ireland and [[Great Britain|Britain]], but it also features in grocery stores and processed meats throughout two continents – Europe and Asia. In 2007, Ireland exported 113,000 [[Tonne|tons]] of pig meat, nearly half of which went to the United Kingdom. Over 500,000 live pigs were also shipped to the UK for slaughter and processing in that country. Ireland's other major customers of its pork are Germany, the buyer of 9,000&amp;nbsp;tons in 2007; France, Italy and several countries within the boundaries of Eastern Europe, which together purchased over 20,000&amp;nbsp;tons, Russia, the buyer of 6,600&amp;nbsp;tons, and China, which came into the ownership of 1,100&amp;nbsp;tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/28086026|title=Ireland warns public not to eat Irish pork|date=6 December 2008|accessdate=6 December 2008|publisher=[[CNBC]]}}{{Dead link|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within hours a number of local newspapers in Ireland including the ''[[Longford Leader]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longfordleader.ie/latest-irish-news/All-Irish-pork-recalled.4769236.jp |title=All Irish pork recalled |date=7 December 2008 |accessdate=7 December 2008 |publisher=[[Longford Leader]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211080107/http://www.longfordleader.ie/latest-irish-news/All-Irish-pork-recalled.4769236.jp |archivedate=11 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Leitrim Observer]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leitrimobserver.ie/latest-irish-news/All-Irish-pork-recalled.4769236.jp |title=All Irish pork recalled |date=7 December 2008 |accessdate=7 December 2008 |publisher=[[Leitrim Observer]] }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; had reproduced copies of the same Press Association article.

====National reactions====
The Food Safety Authority of Ireland moved immediately to reassure the general public of Ireland. Speaking on [[RTÉ Radio]] on the morning after the initial announcement, Deputy chief executive of the FSAI, Alan Reilly said it was "necessary as a precautionary measure" to remove all pork products from within the country. He said he "expected" pork products to be available again before the busy Christmas period got underway and is scheduled to meet government officials and retailers within hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1207/pork.html|title=Food authority moves to allay consumer fears|date=7 December 2008|accessdate=7 December 2008|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish hotels and guesthouses were immediately notified of the unfolding situation and asked to dispose of all their pork products by the [[Irish Hotels Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/national-news/hotels-and-guesthouse-cooperating-after-pork-recallihf-1566676.html|title=Hotels and guesthouse 'co-operating' after pork recall-IHF|date=7 December 2008|accessdate=7 December 2008|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Tesco]] outlets initially only gave refunds for their own branded pork produce but have since begun issuing refunds to all affected Irish products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1208/breaking25.html?via=rel|title=Tesco reassures customers after refunds confusion|date=8 December 2008|accessdate=9 December 2008|publisher=[[The Irish Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Superquinn]] however gave full refunds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/money/2008/1208/pork.html |title=Information on Irish pork recall |date=8 December 2008 |accessdate=12 December 2008 |publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ Money]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108155525/http://www.rte.ie/money/2008/1208/pork.html |archivedate=8 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A helpline set up by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland had received 3,000 calls within 72 hours of the outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1209/breaking45.html?via=rel|title=Food safety helpline receives over 3,000 calls|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=9 December 2008|publisher=[[The Irish Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====International reactions====
{{update section|date=May 2017}}
The UK's [[Food Standards Agency]] has said it does not believe its country's consumers face "significant risk" but it is still awaiting confirmation from the Irish authorities that the affected products had not been exported to its neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7769391.stm|title=Irish Republic recalls all pork|date=6 December 2008|accessdate=6 December 2008|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Scientist Andrew Wadge stated on his FSA blog that because dioxins remain in the body for approximately 30 years, exceeding regulatory limits for a few days has an "insignificant" effect on the individual consumer. The [[Tolerable Daily Intake]] standard sets a level that is without appreciable risk to health over a prolonged period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsascience.net/2008/12/08/safety_limits_and_health_risks |title=Safety limits and health risks |date=8 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220182024/http://www.fsascience.net/2008/12/08/safety_limits_and_health_risks |archivedate=20 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, South Korea has banned imports and advised retailers to stop selling Irish produce, Singapore is following suit, whilst China has "provisionally" stopped importation. Japan has also said it may recall Irish pork products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hocI0jilPER7uTKJp90cDaJgNmXA|title=Countries ban Irish pork in toxin scare|date=8 December 2008|accessdate=8 December 2008|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Press=====
Within twelve hours of the pork recall announcement, the international press was carrying the story and within thirty-six hours there were over 1,700 newspaper articles on the crisis globally.&lt;ref name="irishtimes-wordpressfieldday"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1208/breaking55.html |title=World press has field day with Irish pork crisis |author=Conor Pope |date=8 December 2008 |work=The Irish Times |accessdate=9 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tabloid ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' announced the story as "Toxic Irish pork is swept off shelves" whilst the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' opted for "Poison pork panic: Irish pigs were fed on plastic bags". ''[[Daily Express]]'' ran the story under the banner headline "Shoppers told: Don't eat toxic Irish pork" and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' went with the headline "British shoppers 'may not be able to tell whether they have Irish poison pork in their fridge'". ''[[The Times]]'' had the headline "Shops rush to take Irish pork off shelves", warning that EU labelling laws meant pork originating in Ireland could have been labelled as British. ''[[Le Monde]]'' had the top-five most e-mailed website headline "Dioxin alert in Irish pork" and ''[[The Straits Times]]'' website had the crisis as its second most popular story. ''[[El País]]'' reported its concern that contaminated meat might have arrived in Spain via France and Portugal. ''[[The New York Times]]'', under the headline "Ireland investigating tainted pork" and ''[[The Washington Post]]'', under the headline "Ireland recalls pork products after dioxin test", covered the story in their own short ways. [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] had the headline "Ireland scrambles to contain pork cancer scare" and the [[Xinhua News Agency]] was one of the earliest news agencies to follow the story with headlines including "Irish police to investigate pork contamination". [[CNN]] tagged the story as "another red flag being waved over dinner tables this week with warnings from the Irish government not to eat its pork products", comparing the crisis to [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]], [[H5N1|bird flu]] and the [[2008 Chinese milk scandal]].&lt;ref name="irishtimes-wordpressfieldday" /&gt;

===Return to shelves===
[[Superquinn]] has said it will have Irish pork, traceable to one farm in [[County Kilkenny]] on shelves by 11 December, becoming the first Irish supermarket chain to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/1210/1228849742627.html|title=Superquinn to reintroduce Irish pork products|date=10 December 2008|accessdate=10 December 2008|publisher=[[The Irish Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as early as 7pm on 10 December Irish retailer Dunnes had approved Galtee ham back on shelves for sale.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==Other affected foods==

===Beef===
Twenty one cattle farms in the Republic were discovered to have used the contaminated pig feed, whilst eight cattle farms used it in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="AP-HiBeef"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1209/breaking23.html?via=rel|title=Contaminated feed used on eight NI cattle farms|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=9 December 2008|publisher=[[The Irish Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was disclosed on 18 December 2008 that beef samples from the affected farms had dioxin levels between 100 and 400 times above the legal limit.&lt;ref name="AP-HiBeef"/&gt; The Irish authorities went to great lengths to insist that the threat to public health from Irish beef products, despite the extremely high dioxin levels, was insignificant.&lt;ref name="AP-HiBeef"/&gt; It was noted that the official announcement made no reference to the dioxin levels being 100 to 400 times the legal limit.&lt;ref name="AP-HiBeef"/&gt; In a statement the FSAI recommended "that cattle which are locked down from these 21 farms should now be slaughtered and not allowed enter the food chain".&lt;ref name="FSAI-18Dec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsai.ie/news/press/pr_08/pr20081218.asp |title=FSAI Updates on Dioxin Tests, 18 December 2008 |accessdate=19 December 2008 |publisher=Food Safety Authority of Ireland |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221001101/http://www.fsai.ie/news/press/pr_08/pr20081218.asp |archivedate=21 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is to be no public recall of Irish beef.

However, 3,000 animals from these herds have been slaughtered and have already entered the food chain since September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/1210/1228864618799.html|title=Sample cattle testing to continue on all farms|date=10 December 2008|accessdate=10 December 2008|publisher=[[The Irish Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's Food Standards Agency is conducting tests to assess the level of dioxins present in Northern Irish cattle herds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/1210/1228849742590.html|title=Watchdog talks down risk for several herds of North cattle|date=10 December 2008|accessdate=10 December 2008|publisher=[[The Irish Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milk===
One farm in Northern Ireland has been identified as having fed contaminated animal feed to dairy cattle. Northern Ireland's [[Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety]], [[Michael McGimpsey]] has announced restrictions on milk supplies in the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/1210/1228849742621.html|title=Milk supplies restricted due to feed scare, says McGimpsey|date=10 December 2008|accessdate=10 December 2008|publisher=[[The Irish Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Food Safety Authority's statement==
In its statement issued on 10 December 2008, The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) considered that the levels of [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] &amp; dioxin like [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] in Irish pork, before the contaminated pork was withdrawn, posed no risk to health.&lt;ref name="RTE News-1"&gt;{{Cite news

| work = RTÉ News
| accessdate = 10 December 2008
| date = 10 December 2008
| url = http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1210/pork.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EFSA calculated a number of different exposure scenarios, and they found that if a consumer ate Irish pork each day over the 90-day period, 10% of which was contaminated, the "increase in the [[body burden]] [would be] of no concern for this single event".  In the "very extreme case" of eating large amounts of 100% contaminated Irish pork every day over the 90-day period in question, the EFSA considered that "this unlikely scenario would reduce protection, but not necessarily lead to adverse health effects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/health/latest-news/eu-food-watchdog-says-its-safe-to-eat-irish-pork-1570547.html|title=EU food watchdog says it's safe to eat Irish pork|date=11 December 2008|accessdate=12 December 2008|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]|first=Eilish|last=O'Regan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the EFSA warns that its calculations are "Based on the very limited new data related to the current contamination incident of pork, which were made available to EFSA"&lt;ref name="EFSA PDF"&gt;[http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/Statement/contam_ej_911_dioxins%20rev1.pdf?ssbinary=true ''Statement of EFSA on the risks for public health due to the presence of dioxins in pork from Ireland]{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (Question No EFSA-Q-2008-777), Issued on 10 December 2008'' The EFSA Journal (2008) 911, 1 of 15&lt;/ref&gt; and concludes its statement with the "EFSA based this statement on a limited data set".&lt;ref name="EFSA PDF"/&gt; It also makes clear that its calculations assumed that exposure at these high levels only began in September 2008. If it is found that the animal feed had been contaminated prior to September 2008 then it will have to re-evaluate its findings.&lt;ref name="EFSA PDF"/&gt; The statement did not address the issue of contaminated beef.

==Criminal investigation==
{{update section|date=May 2017}}
A criminal investigation commenced in December 2008 and on 6 March 2010 it was reported in the [[Irish Times]] that a criminal prosecution will be taken in relation to the incident.&lt;ref name="IT20100306"&gt;{{cite news|title=Garda to seek prosecutions in pig-feed investigation |first=Mary |last=Carolan |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=6 March 2010 |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0306/1224265704944.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5o1cFhbjI?url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0306/1224265704944.html |archivedate= 6 March 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil case==
Millstream Recycling Ltd. has taken a civil case against Gerard Tierney of [[Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]], and against his company Newtown Lodge Ltd.

'''Angak''' is a [[Hopi]] [[kachina]] spirit, represented by spirit dancers and a corresponding kachina doll figure, known to non-hopis as ''Longhair''.

==Spirit character==
Angak represents a healing and protective male figure.

==Dance representation==
The dance of this figure is slow.

==Figure representation==
The figure will have waist length black hair and a black beard to mid chest, and when represented as a carving will usually be taller than other kachinas by the same artist. The figure wears a full length white cape, showing only his right hand, which contains an evergreen bough, representative of his home in the sacred [[San Francisco Peaks]]. On the cape are symbols for rainclouds.

==Headdress==
The forward part of the headdress over the brow consists of yellow feathers, while the rear part contains a long pendant of feathers terminating in a raincloud symbol. (Feathers in the doll are carved.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19111">'''Benzene in soft drinks''' is of potential concern due to the [[carcinogen]]ic nature of the [[benzene]] molecule. This contamination is a [[public health]] concern and has caused significant outcry among environmental and health advocates. Benzene levels are regulated in drinking water nationally and internationally, and in bottled water in the United States, but only informally in soft drinks. The benzene forms from [[decarboxylation]] of the [[preservative]] [[benzoic acid]] in the presence of [[ascorbic acid]] (vitamin C) and metal ions (iron and copper) that act as [[catalyst]]s, especially under heat and light.

== Formation in soft drinks ==

The major cause of benzene in soft drinks is the [[decarboxylation]] of [[benzoic acid]] in the presence of [[ascorbic acid]] (vitamin C, E300) or [[erythorbic acid]] (a [[diastereomer]] of ascorbic acid, E315). [[Benzoic acid]] is often added to drinks as a [[preservative]] in the form of its salts [[sodium benzoate]] (E211), [[potassium benzoate]] (E 212), or [[calcium benzoate]] (E 213).&lt;ref name="GardnerLawrence1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gardner |first1=L.K. |last2=Lawrence |first2=G.D. |date=May 1993 |title=Benzene Production from Decarboxylation of Benzoic Acid in the Presence of Ascorbic Acid and a Transition-Metal Catalyst  |journal=[[J. Agric. Food Chem.]] |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=693–695 |doi=10.1021/jf00029a001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Citric acid]] is not thought to induce significant benzene production in combination with benzoic acid, but some evidence suggests that in the presence of [[ascorbic]] or [[erythorbic acid]] and benzoic acid, citric acid may accelerate the production of benzene.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The proposed mechanism begins with [[hydrogen abstraction]] by the [[hydroxyl radical]], which itself is produced by the [[copper|Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]]-catalysed reduction of [[dioxygen]] by ascorbic acid:&lt;ref name="GardnerLawrence1993"/&gt;

[[File:Benzoic acid decarboxylation landscape.svg|1000px]]

Other factors that affect the formation of benzene are heat and light. Storing soft drinks in warm conditions speeds up the formation of benzene.

Calcium disodium [[EDTA]] and sugars have been shown to inhibit benzene production in soft drinks.&lt;ref name="benzqa"/&gt;

The International Council of Beverages Associations (ICBA) has produced advice to prevent or minimize benzene formation.&lt;ref&gt;International Council of Beverages Associations [http://www.icba-net.org/files/resources/icba-benzene-guidance-english.pdf ''ICBA Guidance Document to Mitigate the Potential for Benzene Formation in Beverages''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417213634/http://www.icba-net.org/files/resources/icba-benzene-guidance-english.pdf |date=April 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limit standards in drinking water ==
Various authorities have set limits on benzene content in drinking water. The following limits are given in [[parts per billion]] (ppb; [[microgram|μg]]/kg).

* [[World Health Organization]] (WHO): 10 ppb (WHO notes that benzene should be avoided whenever technically feasible.)
* Republic of Korea ([[South Korea]]): 10 ppb&lt;ref name="rokfda"&gt;[http://www.beveragedaily.com/news/ng.asp?id=67104-benzene-vitamin-c-drinks "South Korea urges recall of benzene-containing drinks"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411152003/http://www.beveragedaily.com/news/ng.asp?id=67104-benzene-vitamin-c-drinks |date=April 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[European Union]]: 1 ppb&lt;ref&gt;''[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/pri/en/oj/dat/1998/l_330/l_33019981205en00320054.pdf Council Directive 98/83/EC of 3 November 1998 on the quality of water intended for human consumption]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'' (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;
* State limits within the United States: [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Florida]]: 1 ppb

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] and [[California]] have set public health goals for benzene of 0 ppb and 0.15 ppb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/safewater/dwh/c-voc/benzene.html Consumer Factsheet on Benzene] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060413152606/http://www.epa.gov/safewater/dwh/c-voc/benzene.html |date=April 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental exposure to benzene ==
{{See also|Benzene#Exposure to benzene}}
Benzene in soft drinks has to be seen in the context of other environmental exposure. Taking the worst example found to date of a soft drink containing 87.9 ppb benzene,&lt;ref name="rokfda" /&gt; someone drinking a 350 ml (12&amp;nbsp;oz) can would ingest 31 μg (micrograms) of benzene, almost equivalent to the benzene inhaled by a motorist refilling a fuel tank for three minutes. While there are alternatives to using sodium benzoate as a preservative, the casual consumption of such a drink is unlikely to pose a significant health hazard to a particular individual (see, for example, the EPA IRIS document on benzene&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Protection Agency. [http://www.epa.gov/iris/subst/0276.htm Integrated Risk Information System: Benzene] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914072352/http://www.epa.gov/iris/subst/0276.htm |date=September 14, 2015 }} Accessed on November 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;).

The UK Food Standards Agency has stated that people would need to drink at least 20 litres (5.5 gal) per day of a drink containing benzene at 10 μg to equal the amount of benzene they would breathe from city air every day.&lt;ref name="kiwi"&gt;New Zealand Food Safety Authority / Te Pou Oranga kai O Aotearoa [http://www.nzfsa.govt.nz/consumers/food-safety-topics/chemicals-in-food/benzene/index.htm Benzene in flavoured drinks] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423173956/http://www.nzfsa.govt.nz/consumers/food-safety-topics/chemicals-in-food/benzene/index.htm |date=April 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Daily personal exposure to benzene is determined by adding exposure from all sources.

* Air: A European study found that people breathe in 220 μg of benzene every day due to general atmospheric pollution. A motorist refilling a fuel tank for three minutes would inhale a further 32 μg.&lt;ref name="fsasurvey"&gt;[[Food Standards Agency]], March 2006, ''[http://www.food.gov.uk/science/research/surveillance/food-surveys/fsisbranch2006/fsis0606"Survey of Benzene in Soft Drinks] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009045332/http://www.food.gov.uk/science/research/surveillance/food-surveys/fsisbranch2006/fsis0606 |date=October 9, 2014 }}'' (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Commission Joint Research Centre, ''[http://www.jrc.cec.eu.int/pce/documentation/eur_reports/report_EUR21501en2005.pdf ''HEXPOC Human Exposure Characterization of chemical substances; quantification of exposure routes'']{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', pp36–59, 2005, EU 21501 EN&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated daily exposure from "automobile-related activities" is 49 μg and for driving for one hour is 40 μg.&lt;ref name="kiwi"/&gt;
* Smoking: For smokers, cigarette smoking is the main source of exposure to benzene. Estimates are 7900 μg per day (smoking 20 cigarettes per day),&lt;ref name="fsasurvey"/&gt; 1820 μg/day, and 1800&amp;nbsp;µg/day.&lt;ref name="kiwi" /&gt;
* [[Passive smoking]]: Benzene intake from passive smoking is estimated at 63 μg/day (Canada) and 50&amp;nbsp;µg/day.&lt;ref name="kiwi" /&gt;
* Diet and drinking water: 0.2 to 3.1 μg per day.&lt;ref name="kiwi" /&gt;

== History ==

=== 1990s ===
In 1990, a study reported having found [[benzene]] in bottles of [[Perrier]] for sale in the United States, resulting in a voluntary product recall.&lt;ref&gt;George James [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7D61F39F933A25751C0A966958260&amp;sec=health&amp;pagewanted=1 Perrier Recalls Its Water in U.S. After Benzene Is Found in Bottles] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418002843/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7D61F39F933A25751C0A966958260&amp;sec=health&amp;pagewanted=1 |date=April 18, 2008 }} ''The New York Times'' February 10, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Public Health Service, Department of Health and Human Services [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929145842/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ENFORCE/ENF00080.html FDA Enforcement Report] February 28, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, the soft drink industry initially approached [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] with concerns about [[benzene]] formation in soft drinks. Following testing, FDA asked manufacturers to voluntarily reformulate. By 1993, FDA determined that most drinks had little [[benzene]] contamination.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080326000123/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/benzltr.html Letter Regarding Benzene Levels in Soft Drinks]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, research showed how benzene can form from benzoic acid in the presence of vitamin C.&lt;ref name="GardnerLawrence1993" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4763528.stm |title=Cancer chemical found in drinks |date=1 March 2006 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1998, a number of well known soft drinks manufacturers had to withdraw large quantities of their products from sale after benzene contamination in some production plants was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lighterfootstep.com/coca-cola-agrees-to-take-carcinogenic-benzene-out-of-soda.html Coca-Cola agrees to take carcinogenic benzene out of soda] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723113355/http://lighterfootstep.com/coca-cola-agrees-to-take-carcinogenic-benzene-out-of-soda.html |date=July 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2005 ===
In November 2005, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] received test results conducted by private citizens that benzene was forming at low levels in several types of beverages.&lt;ref name="FDABenz"&gt;FDA. May 19, 2006, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080326000150/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/benzdata.html "Data on Benzene in Soft Drinks and Other Beverages"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, [[Germany]]'s Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (''Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung'') published a review of benzene's possible formation in foods and drinks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfr.bund.de/cm/245/indications_of_the_possible_formation_of_benzene_from_benzoic_acid_in_foods.pdf Indications of the possible formation of benzene from benzoic acid in foods] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719145632/http://www.bfr.bund.de/cm/245/indications_of_the_possible_formation_of_benzene_from_benzoic_acid_in_foods.pdf |date=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2006 ===
In February 2006, an unnamed former [[chemist]] at the FDA publicly revealed that [[benzene]] may be created as part of a chemical reaction during production of [[soft drink]]s, particularly those having an [[orange (fruit)|orange]] flavor.&lt;ref name="Mercer"&gt;Mercer, Chris. ''Food Production Daily'', February 15, 2006, [http://www.foodproductiondaily-usa.com/news/ng.asp?n=65840-soft-drinks-fda-benzene "FDA re-opens probe into benzene contamination of soft drinks"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927143639/http://www.foodproductiondaily-usa.com/news/ng.asp?n=65840-soft-drinks-fda-benzene |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Full-scale investigations immediately started at the [[Food Standards Agency]] ([[United Kingdom|UK]]) and in [[Germany]] to reveal exactly which amounts of benzene, if any, were present, with several other organizations awaiting their findings.&lt;ref name="Mercer2"&gt;Mercer, Chris. ''Food Production Daily'', February 20, 2006, [http://www.foodproductiondaily-usa.com/news/ng.asp?n=65933-benzene-soft-drinks-food-safety "UK, Germany checking soft drinks for benzene"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927143655/http://www.foodproductiondaily-usa.com/news/ng.asp?n=65933-benzene-soft-drinks-food-safety |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Food Standards Agency]] released results on March 31, 2006 for 150 beverages.&lt;ref name="fsasurvey" /&gt; Its results showed 43 beverages contained benzene, four of which contained levels above the [[World Health Organization]] drinking water standards (10 [[Parts per billion|ppb]]). These four were withdrawn from sale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2006/mar/benzenesurvey "Survey of benzene levels in soft drinks"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204060101/http://www.food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2006/mar/benzenesurvey |date=February 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Valerie, ''[[The Times]]'', April 1, 2006, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2113695,00.html "Soft drinks pulled from shelves over cancer fear"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907045232/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C2-2113695%2C00.html |date=September 7, 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, the [[Korea Food &amp; Drug Administration]] (KFDA) announced that it had detected benzene in 27 out of 30 (90%) vitamin-enriched drinks on sale in [[South Korea]]. It said the detected amount of benzene – ranging from 5.7 to 87.8 ppb – was not harmful to humans but advised manufacturers of beverages containing more than 10 ppb of benzene to voluntarily recall their products.&lt;ref name="rokfda" /&gt;

The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] released preliminary results&lt;ref name="FDABenz" /&gt; in May 2006 for 100 beverages showing that many soft drinks contained low levels of benzene (less than 5 [[Parts per billion|ppb]], the federal drinking water limit) while four drinks contained amounts above the standard. Two of these drinks contained amounts 15-18 times above the drinking water standard. Many of the products showed large variations in the amount of benzene they contained. The FDA stated that it is working with manufacturers to reformulate products that contain benzene above the federal drinking water standard.

These test results are both lower and more accurate than a previous long-term study by the FDA. In the Total Diet Study&lt;ref&gt;[[Food and Drug Administration]] (US FDA) [https://web.archive.org/web/20071221105722/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~comm/tds-toc.html "Total Diet Study"]&lt;/ref&gt; that FDA conducted from 1996 - 2001 to determine the amounts of [[volatile organic compounds]] in various foods, FDA used an [[analytical technique|analytical]] procedure that caused more benzene to form in the drinks during the test.&lt;ref&gt;[[Food and Drug Administration]] (US FDA). April 13, 2006, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080116060645/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2006/NEW01355.html "FDA Statement: Benzene in Soft Drinks"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hildeman, Bette. "Dispute Over Benzene In Drinks", Chemical and Engineering News, April 24, [2006], Vol. 84, pg 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] emphasized that most beverages contain levels below 5 [[Parts per billion|ppb]] and pose no risk to consumers. Furthermore, there are no standards for beverages beyond drinking and bottled water. A watchdog organization, the [[Environmental Working Group]], had previously called on the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] to release its results. The [[Environmental Working Group|EWG]] also criticized the FDA for not acting on the Total Diet Study results showing the nearly 80% of the diet soft drinks exceeded the federal drinking water standards.

On 9 June 2006, [[Health Canada]] released its study results of benzene levels in beverages. Four products out of 118 had levels above the Canadian guideline of five micrograms per liter for benzene in drinking water (average range 6.0 to 23.0&amp;nbsp;µg/L). The follow up study the next year found only three samples with marginally higher levels and concluded the average levels were quite low.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130111054033/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/alt_formats/hpfb-dgpsa/pdf/securit/benzene_follow_hra-ers-eng.pdf A Follow up survey of benzene in soft drinks and other products], 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/securit/chem-chim/food-aliment/benzene/index-eng.php Benzene in Soft Drinks and other Beverage Products] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202224334/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/securit/chem-chim/food-aliment/benzene/index-eng.php |date=December 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 August 2006, two soft drink manufacturers agreed to settle a [[class-action]] lawsuit that had been filed by a group of parents in the [[Superior Court of the District of Columbia]]. The two companies, Zone Brands Inc., maker of "BellyWashers" products, and TalkingRain Beverage Co., denied that their products were harmful, but agreed to change the ingredients in their drinks.&lt;ref&gt;LIBBY QUAID [http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/630686/soft_drink_companies_settle_benzene_case/index.html Soft Drink Companies Settle Benzene Case] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114071220/http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/630686/soft_drink_companies_settle_benzene_case/index.html |date=January 14, 2009 }}, August 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Cannabis]] in [[Burundi]]''' is illegal.

==History==
A 1977 United States Congressional report noted that cannabis in Burundi was illegal, with cultivation, transport, or possession punishable by fines of 100-100,000 francs, though rarely enforced. It noted too that cannabis was sometimes called ''chanvre a fumer'' in regional French by older and poorer elements of the population.&lt;ref name="Control1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States.

'''Conjugal love''' refers to love in a conjugal relationship, that is, in a [[marriage]], since the word "conjugal" is defined as related to the relationship between married partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/conjugal%7Cpublisher=www.oxforddictionaries.com|title=conjugal {{!}} Definition of conjugal in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage does not necessarily involve love between the partners.  [[Christian views on marriage]] involve love as being central to the marriage relationship, just as Christianity views love as central to human life and human relationship to God (as illustration, the statement from the New Testament that "...God is love."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-8.htm|title=1 John 4:8 Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  The Christian expectation is that the physical act of making love in marriage will be integrated into a complete love between the two partners.

The Catholic Church, like the Orthodox Church, views marriage as a [[sacrament]].  The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] devotes a section to the topic of "conjugal love" (paragraphs 1643-1654).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/catechism/index.cfm?recnum=4816|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|website=www.catholicculture.org|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first paragraph of that section states, "Conjugal love involves a totality, in which all the elements of the person enter - appeal of the body and instinct, power of feeling and affectivity, aspiration of the spirit and of will. It aims at a deeply personal unity, a unity that, beyond union in one flesh, leads to forming one heart and soul; it demands indissolubility and faithfulness in definitive mutual giving; and it is open to fertility. In a word it is a question of the normal characteristics of all natural conjugal love, but with a new significance which not only purifies and strengthens them, but raises them to the extent of making them the expression of specifically Christian values."

In the Old Testament book "The [[Song of Songs]]", a physical love affair between a man and a woman is described; Christians have generally taken this book as showing a picture of the love from God to people, and their responding love for God.  This interpretation implies there is a strong connection between physical love in a marriage and the love between God and human beings.

The '''corn cyst nematode''' (CCN) ''Heterodera zeae'' is a plant parasitic nematode that feeds on [[corn]] ''Zea mays''. The CCN has a limited economic impact worldwide due to its high soil temperature requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hashmi|first=S.|author2=L. R. Krusberg |author3=S. Sardanelli |title=Reproduction of ''Heterodera zeae'' and its suppression of corn plant growth as affected by temperature.|journal=Journal of Nematology|year=1993|volume=25|pages=55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

CCN was first described from a population in India in 1970. It was later reported in Egypt and Pakistan. In India the CCN is considered to be one of the four economically important cyst nematodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koshy|first=P.K.|author2=G. Swarup|title=Distribution of ''Heterodera avenue'', ''H. zeae'', ''H. cajani'', and ''Anguina tritici''. in India.|journal=Indian Journal of Nematology|year=1971|volume=1|pages=106–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first report of the species in the Western hemisphere came in 1981 from four colonies in Maryland, Harford, Cecil, Kent, and Queen Anne’s counties. These four counties were placed under quarantine. The nematode was later identified from Cumberland Co., VA, over 170 miles from the nearest known infested field in Maryland. In Virginia the nematode was restricted to a 3 by 2.5 mile strip of land along the Appomattox River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenback|first=J.D.|author2=E. Traut|title=The final report of the corn cyst nematode survey in Virginia.|year=1994|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The cysts of CCN are light brown in color and lemon shaped. The cysts also have a zig-zag pattern on the cyst wall with four prominent finger-like bullae below the underbridge. The juveniles have an average stylet length of 20 μm and have a thin finely pointed tail. Females have a vulva slit of approximately 33 μm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Golden|first=A.M.|author2=R.H. Mulvey|title=Morphological and diagnostic features of ''Heterodera zeae'', the corn cyst nematode.|journal=Journal of Nematology|year=1982|volume=14|page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution and economic importance ==

The CCN has been found in India, Pakistan, Egypt, and the United States. In India and Egypt it is considered to be of economic importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aboul-Eid|first=H.Z.|author2=A.I. Ghorab|title=The occurrence of ''Heterodera zeae'' in maize fields in Egypt.|journal=Egyptian Journal of Phytopathology|year=1981|volume=13|pages=51–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The species of certain plants in India that were hosts of the corn cyst nematode differed from those found in the United States&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States it is not considered to be of economic importance due to its limited distribution and high soil temperature requirements for reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koenning|first=S.R.|author2=C. Overstreet |author3=J. W. Noling |author4=P. A. Donald |author5=J. O. Becker |author6=B. A. Fortnum |title=Survey of crop losses in response to phytoparasitic nematodes in the United States for 1994.|journal=Journal of Nematology|year=1999|volume=31|pages=587–618}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys have found the nematode in four Maryland counties and one county in Virginia. However, extensive surveys from 2004 to 2011 failed to identify ''H. zeae'' from New Jersey, Florida, Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Idaho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Agricultural Pest Information System (NAPIS)|title=Survey Status of Corn Cyst Nematode (CCN) - ''Heterodera zeae'' (All Years).|url=http://pest.ceris.purdue.edu/map.php?code=NEFBCBG&amp;year=alltime|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=2013-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reproduction &amp; Life Cycle ==

The life cycle of the CCN is similar to other cyst nematodes in the genus ''[[Heterodera]]''. Individuals begin as eggs contained within a cyst, the hardened body of a dead female. Juveniles complete the molt from first stage to second stage within the egg, and it is the second stage juvenile or J2, which hatches from the egg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hashmi|first=S.|author2=L. R. Krusberg |author3=S. Sardanelli |title=Reproduction of ''Heterodera zeae'' and its suppression of corn plant growth as affected by temperature.|journal=Journal of Nematology|year=1993|volume=25|pages=55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The J2 will seek out the roots of a suitable host plant and penetrate the root in search of a feeding site. The J2 will establish a permanent feeding site known as a syncytium and progress to adulthood. Males have not been described, but are assumed to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Golden|first=A. M.|author2=R. H. Mulvey|title=Morphological and diagnostic features of Heterodera zeae, the corn cyst nematode.|journal=Journal of Nematology|year=1982|volume=14|page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female development is highly temperature dependent with development being minimal at 75&amp;nbsp;°F and steadily increasing in rate from 80&amp;nbsp;°F to 97&amp;nbsp;°F. The optimal developmental temperature is ≥ 97&amp;nbsp;°F, which is considered high for cyst nematodes. In the greenhouse females will produce around 150 eggs when developing on corn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hashmi|first=S.|author2=L. R. Krusberg |author3=S. Sardanelli |title=Reproduction of ''Heterodera zeae'' and its suppression of corn plant growth as affected by temperature.|journal=Journal of Nematology|year=1993|volume=25|pages=55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion of their life adult females will darken in color and become hardened forming protective cysts, which contain their eggs.

== Host Parasite Relationship ==

The CCN is known to be capable of parasitizing and reproducing on 42 different members of the [[Poaceae]] family of plants. These include the economically important crops of [[oat]], [[barley]], [[rice]], [[sorghum]], and [[wheat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ringer|first=C. E.|author2=S. Sardanelli |author3=L. R. Krusberg |title=Investigations of the host range of the corn cyst nematode, ''Heterodera zeae'', from Maryland.|journal=Annals of Applied Nematology|year=1987|volume=1|pages=97–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corn is the preferred host with reproduction on corn far exceeding the other crops.

The CCN is a sedentary endoparasitic nematode, establishing feeding sites in the roots of host plants near the vascular tissue. Like other cyst nematodes, CCN feeds from a specialized feeding site known as a [[syncytium]]. This feeding site is formed by the deterioration of cell walls of adjoining plant cells in response to elicitors delivered through the nematode’s stylet. This cell wall deterioration leads to the formation of a single multi-nucleated feeding cell. Through the diversion of nutrients to the syncytium, CCN can stunt corn plant growth and reduce yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hashmi|first=S.|author2=L. R. Krusberg |author3=S. Sardanelli |title=Reproduction of ''Heterodera zeae'' and its suppression of corn plant growth as affected by temperature.|journal=Journal of Nematology|year=1993|volume=25|pages=55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krusberg|first=L. R.|author2=S. Sardanelli |author3=A. P. Grybauskas |title=Damage potential of ''Heterodera zeae'' to ''Zea mays'' as affected by edaphic factors.|journal=Fundamentals of Applied Nematology|year=1997|volume=20|pages=593–599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==

The CCN is currently not considered an economically important pest of corn in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koenning|first=S. R.|author2=C. Overstreet |author3=J. W. Noling |author4=P. A. Donald |author5=J. O. Becker |author6=B. A. Fortnum |title=Survey of crop losses in response to phytoparasitic nematodes in the United States for 1994.|journal=Journal of Nematology|year=1999|volume=31|pages=587–618}}&lt;/ref&gt; If CCN reaches damaging levels crop rotation to non-host crops would be a viable management option as the CCN’s host range is limited to grasses and its non-hosts include [[soybean]], [[alfalfa]], and [[cotton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ringer|first=C. E.|author2=S. Sardanelli |author3=L. R. Krusberg |title=Investigations of the host range of the corn cyst nematode, ''Heterodera zeae'', from Maryland.|journal=Annals of Applied Nematology|year=1987|volume=1|pages=97–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Host plant resistant corn lines have been found and could be used to develop resistant hybrids if needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hashmi|first=S.|author2=L. R. Krusberg |author3=R. N. Huettel |title=Resistance in ''Zea mays'' to ''Heterodera zeae''.|journal=Journal of Nematology|year=1993|volume=25|pages=820–823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3501">A '''cyst of Montgomery''' is a [[benign]] breast mass, usually found in [[adolescent]] girls. Typically, it resolves spontaneously by itself.&lt;ref&gt;Breast disorders in the pediatric and adolescent patient. Templeman C, Hertweck SP. Obstet Gynecol Clin North Am. 2000;27(1):19–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==

A cyst of Montgomery may be [[asymptomatic]]. Yet, a cyst of Montgomery usually is diagnosed when a female patient, 10–20 years of age, complains to a healthcare professional of breast pain ([[mastalgia]]), inflammation or a palpable nodule in the breast. The diagnosis is made clinically, when a palpable nodule is felt in the retroareolar area.&lt;ref&gt;Disorders of the breast in children and adolescents, Part 2: breast masses. De Silva NK, Brandt ML. J Pediatr Adolesc Gynecol. 2006 Dec;19(6):415-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==

The periareolar glands of Montgomery in the breast are also called Montgomery tubercles or Morgagni tubercles. These periareolar glands are small, papular tissue projections at the edge of the [[areola]] (nipple).Obstruction of the Montgomery tubercles may result in an acute inflammation, a clear or light brownish fluid may drain out of the areola ([[nipple discharge]]), and an subareolar mass may develop, the cyst of Montgomery.&lt;ref&gt;Nipple discharge and breast lump related to Montgomery's tubercles in adolescent females. Watkins F, Giacomantonio M, Salisbury S. J Pediatr Surg. 1988;23(8):718-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis can be confirmed with [[ultrasonography]], frequently showing a simple cyst in the retroareolar area. In some patients, multiple cysts or bilateral cysts may exist. Cysts of Montgomery may have liquid content with an echogenic or calcific sediment.&lt;ref&gt; Breast US in children and adolescents. García CJ, Espinoza A, Dinamarca V, Navarro O, Daneman A, García H, Cattani A. Radiographics. 2000 Nov–Dec;20(6):1605–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment and prognosis==

The clinical management of a cyst of Montgomery depends upon the symptoms of the patient.

If there are no signs of infection, a cyst of Montgomery can be observed, because more than 80% resolve spontaneously, over only a few months. However, in some cases, spontaneous resolution may take up two years. In such cases, a repeat ultrasonography may become necessary. If, however, the patient has signs of an infection, for example reddening ([[erythema]]), warmth, pain and tenderness, a treatment for mastitis can be initiated, which may include [[antibiotics]] and [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs). With treatment, inflammatory changes usually disappear quickly. In rare cases, drainage may become necessary. A surgical treatment of a cyst of Montgomery, i.e. a [[Segmental resection|resection]], may become necessary only if a cyst of Montgomery persists, or the diagnosis is questioned clinically.&lt;ref&gt;Overview of breast masses in children and adolescents. Banikarim C, De Silva NK. In: UpToDate [Textbook of Medicine]. Basow D (Ed). Massachusetts Medical Society, and Wolters Kluwer publishers. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prognosis seems to be excellent. In one series, all adolescent patients with a cyst of Montgomery had a favourable outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Retroareolar cysts in the adolescent. Huneeus A, Schilling A, Horvath E, Pinochet M, Carrasco O. J Pediatr Adolesc Gynecol. 2003 Feb;16(1):45-9.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Synonym==

Cyst of Montgomery is also called '''retroareolar cyst'''.

'''Erotic sexual denial''', also known as '''orgasm denial''', is a sexual practice or sex play in which a person is kept in a heightened state of [[sexual arousal]] for an extended length of time without [[orgasm]], and is commonly practiced in association with [[BDSM]] and [[sexual bondage]]. Erotic sexual denial can be another name for or variant of [[Edging (sexual practice)|orgasm control]].

One form of erotic sexual denial is the reduction or deprivation of all [[genital stimulation]]. To ensure a complete absence of genital stimulation, a [[chastity belt (BDSM)|chastity device]] may be used as a physical barrier to genital touch or full erection.

==Denial practices==
===Tie and tease===
To be able to control an orgasm of a partner in such sex games, [[Bondage (BDSM)|physical restraints]] are commonly used. Situations involving bondage are typically called "tie and tease" and can be thought of as extended tease and denial games. This practice is often an integral part of erotic denial. It is notable that in discussions between [[BDSM]] partners, [[Negotiation (BDSM)|negotiation]] usually focuses on the activities which may or may not be agreed to, rather than the emotions generated by said activities (unless at an unacceptable level). Tie and tease activities are physically as well as psychologically intense, because the strong feelings of [[sexual frustration]] are escalated by the sensation of helplessness induced by bondage.

===Tease and denial===
Tease and denial is a situation where a person is [[sexual stimulation|stimulated]] until they are close to orgasm, then stimulation is stopped, keeping the person on the brink of orgasm. It is sometimes referred to as "edging", or "edge play". This is similar to orgasm control, but without the promise of orgasm at the end.

If orgasm still occurs after removal of stimulation, it typically brings less pleasure than usual, and is considered a "ruined orgasm", as opposed to being a "denied orgasm" (sometimes known in men as "[[blue balls]]"). Alternatively (for men), the release of semen during the [[Ejaculation#Emission|emission phase]] of ejaculation might be prevented by some sort of constriction ("blocked orgasm"). Depending on the relationship, subjects might be repeatedly teased to the point of orgasm several times, but without actual orgasm, causing feelings of intense arousal and psychological need.

=== Total denial ===
The practice of total sexual denial usually includes total avoidance of genital stimulation to the penis or vulva. This often involves the use of a physical barrier or device such as a [[chastity belt (BDSM)|chastity belt]]. Chastity belts or similar locking devices are available for both men and women. Depending on the situation, sexual arousal may still be possible regardless of physical barriers to genital stimulation. This, however, depends on the belt used.

=== Male strap-on harness ===
A [[strap-on dildo]] may be worn by a male to still allow penetrative vaginal sex to the female while denying the male partner the ability to orgasm, and the male then may also wear a chastity belt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tickleberry.co.uk/male-chastity/dildo-harnesses-for-men/ Male Dildo Harness - A guide for Men how to wear a strap-on]&lt;/ref&gt; This is distinct from [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]], as the strap-on in this case replaces the penis of the male. This can be seen as a form of total denial if the strap-on replaces the penis throughout the whole duration of the play, or as a form of teasing if the strap-on is only used during foreplay. In the last case, the strap-on can be used to prolong penetrative sex and thus sexually satisfy the female partner in case the male suffers from [[premature ejaculation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://thegrittywoman.com/beginners-guide-purchasing-your-first-strap-on-harness/ Beginners Guide: Purchasing Your First Strap-On Harness | Gritty Woman]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/06/02/25185409/savage-love-letter-of-the-day-hes-perfect-but-a-premie Savage Love Letter of the Day: He's Perfect, But a Premie - Slog - The Stranger]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.purepleasureshop.com/blogs/ask-amy/15152581-rose-answers-premature-ejaculation-101 Rose Answers: Premature Ejaculation 101 – Pure Pleasure Shop]&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a form of control==
Erotic sexual denial, in various forms, is sometimes associated with creating a state of sexual need leading to a more pliable or agreeable outlook by the denied party.

Orgasm denial practices can allow dominant lovers to exercise control and training over highly intimate and psychologically significant aspects of their submissive lovers' lives. This can extend to tolerance of increased stimulation and training both to hold back orgasm, or to orgasm on command. Dominant lovers can use this practice to experience enjoyable and sometimes intensely craved feelings of sexual control and erotic power. Submissive lovers can use this practice to help them experience enjoyable and sometimes intensely craved feelings of erotic submission, sexualised objectification and erotic loss of control.

Orgasm denial as a way of [[Edging (sexual practice)|orgasm control]] is a widely practiced activity within erotic [[Feminization (activity)|feminization]]. The dom will often deny the submissive (BDSM) sexual release to maintain their heightened state of sexual arousal, as a way to satisfy their desires for erotic humiliation, or as a way to satisfy the dominant's own desires to erotically humiliate.

The '''European Community Urgent Radiological Information Exchange (ECURIE)''' is the European early [[Warning system|notification system]] in the event of a [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|radiological or nuclear emergency]].

The ECURIE system has two message types: an ''ECURIE Alert message'', which implies an emergency notification under [[Euratom]] and an ''ECURIE Information message'', which is a voluntary notification of smaller events and incidents. The possibility of sending ECURIE Information messages was introduced by the [[European Commission|Commission]] in 2001. Since then, there have been more than 20 information messages.&lt;ref&gt;Answer of [[Andris Piebalgs]] to written question of [[Rebecca Harms]] of the [[European Parliament]], [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=P-2008-3513&amp;language=EN]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the [[European Council]] mandated an early notification and information exchange system&lt;ref&gt;Council Decision of 14 December 1987 on Community arrangements for the early exchange of information in the event of a radiological emergency. [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:22003A0429(01):EN:HTML|Official Journal L 371 , 30 December 1987 P. 0076 – 0078].&lt;/ref&gt; that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
requires from the ECURIE Member States that they promptly notify the European Commission (EC) and all the Member States potentially affected when they intend to take counter-measures in order to protect their population against the effects of a radiological or nuclear accident. The EC will immediately forward this notification to all Member States. Following this first notification, all Member States are required to inform the Commission at appropriate intervals about the measures they take and the radioactivity levels they have measured.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All 28 [[Member State of the European Union|EU Member States]] have signed the ECURIE agreement, as well as Switzerland and the Republic of Macedonia. Turkey and Iceland have also been invited.&lt;ref&gt;Agreement between the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) and non-member States of the European Union on the participation of the latter in the Community arrangements for the early exchange of information in the event of radiological emergency (Ecurie) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:22003A0429(01):EN:HTML|Official Journal C 102 , 29 April 2003 P. 0002 – 0005]&lt;/ref&gt;

ECURIE is operated by the DG ENER of the European Commission with the Joint Research Centre responsible for technical development.

==Usage==
* The first ever activation of the ECURIE (European Community Urgent Radiological Information Exchange) system was after a [[loss-of-coolant accident]] (LOCA) in the [[Krško Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Slovenia]] on 4 June 2008. The power plant was safely shut down to a secure mode after a leak in the cooling circuit. According to the Slovenian Nuclear Safety Administration (the country's nuclear watchdog agency), no radioactive release into the environment occurred and none was expected. The event did not affect employees, the nearby population or the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ursjv.gov.si/en/ Slovenian Nuclear Safety Administration website]&lt;/ref&gt; Slovenian authorities immediately notified the proper international institutions, including the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and ECURIE. The EU then notified (through ECURIE) the remaining EU member states, issuing an EU-wide alert. Several news agencies around the world then reported on the incident.&lt;ref&gt;EU issues radiation alert after incident at Slovenian nuclear plant – [http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gN3DS-Btuoa7GDuN9cJ6tWXIdNiw AFP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606223243/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gN3DS-Btuoa7GDuN9cJ6tWXIdNiw |date=6 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Greenpeace]] such an EU-wide alert is very unusual.&lt;ref&gt;EU löst Atom-Alarm nach Zwischenfall in Slowenien aus – [http://www.afp.com/deutsch/news/stories/newsmlmmd.1cda3591ee83226b8588f42e3c5af148.381.html AFP (german)]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, the [[Croatia]]n authorities were not directly informed about the incident, although Croatia ''is'' part of the ECURIE system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rem.jrc.ec.europa.eu/40.html European Community Urgent Radiological Information Exchange (ECURIE)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817194220/http://rem.jrc.ec.europa.eu/40.html |date=17 August 2009 }} at the [[Joint Research Centre|JRC]]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Croatians heard the news first through foreign media and expatriates.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bellona Foundation|Bellona]]: [http://www.bellona.org/articles/articles_2008/croatia_indark Croatia complains it was kept in the dark after Slovenian reactor incident, while others were told leak was an ‘exercise’] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807061649/http://www.bellona.org/articles/articles_2008/croatia_indark |date=7 August 2011 }}, 05/06-2008&lt;/ref&gt; Krško is located a mere 15&amp;nbsp;km from the Croatian border.

An '''eye chart''' is a chart used to measure [[visual acuity]]. Eye charts are often used by health care professionals, such as [[optometrist]]s, [[physician]]s or [[Nursing|nurses]], to screen persons for [[Visual impairment|vision impairment]]. [[Ophthalmology|Ophthalmologists]], physicians who specialize in the eye, also use eye charts to monitor the visual acuity of their [[patient]]s in response to various therapies such as [[Eye drop|medications]] or [[Eye surgery|surgery]].

The chart is placed at a standardized distance away from the person whose vision is being tested. The person then attempts to identify the symbols on the chart, starting with the larger symbols and continuing with progressively smaller symbols until the person cannot identify the symbols. The smallest symbols that can be reliably identified is considered the person's visual acuity.

The [[Snellen chart]] is the most widely used. Alternative types of eye charts include the [[logMAR chart]], [[Landolt C]], [[E chart]], [[Lea test]], [[Golovin–Sivtsev table]], the Rosenbaum chart, and the [[Jaeger chart]].

==Procedure==
Charts display several rows of optotypes, which are standardized symbols for testing [[Visual perception|vision]]. Optotypes are usually letters, numbers, or geometric symbols. Each row of the chart depicts optotypes of a different size. Typically the largest optotypes are in the top row.  The optotypes become progressively smaller towards the bottom of the chart.

The person removes any glasses or contact lenses, and stands or sits a standardized distance from the chart (e.g., 20 feet for the Snellen chart).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003396.htm|title = Medline Plus, Visual Acuity Test|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The person is then asked to identify the optotypes on the chart, starting with large rows and continuing to smaller rows until the optotypes cannot be reliably identified any more. The row in which the person can reliably identify symbols defines the visual acuity.

One eye is tested at a time.  Practically, this is accomplished by covering the other eye with a hand, piece of paper, or a small paddle. After testing without glasses or contact lenses, testing is repeated while the person wears them, if applicable. Often, the use of such [[Refractive error|refractive lenses]] will correct visual acuity to normal. Refractive error can be corrected using a [[pinhole occluder]]. If the visual acuity improves with the use of pinholes, refractive lenses can be utilized to improve visual acuity. [[:wikt:squint|Squinting]] can achieve the same effect as a pinhole occluder.

With the Snellen chart, the visual acuity is recorded as a fraction with 20 in the [[numerator]] (top number) and values ranging from 10 to 600 in the [[denominator]] (bottom number). The denominator indicates the distance in feet at which a person with normal vision could stand to correctly identify the same symbols identified by the person tested. For example, a visual acuity of 20/20 is considered normal.

==Variations==
Numerous types of eye charts exist and are used in various situations. For example, the Snellen chart is designed for use at 6 meters or 20 feet, and is thus appropriate for testing distance vision. There is often also a need to test a subject's vision at near or occupational tasks (such as reading or computer use). For these situations, a Rosenbaum chart or Jaeger chart can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home vision tests: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003446.htm|website = www.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Snellen chart remains the default, some authors have argued that the logMAR chart is superior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Changing from Snellen to LogMAR: debate or delay? – Hussain – 2006 – Clinical &amp; Experimental Ophthalmology – Wiley Online Library|journal = Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology|volume = 34|issue = 1|pages = 6–8|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com|doi = 10.1111/j.1442-9071.2006.01135.x|pmid = 16451251|year = 2006|last1 = Hussain|first1 = Badrul|last2 = Saleh|first2 = George M|last3 = Sivaprasad|first3 = Sobha|last4 = Hammond|first4 = Christopher J}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The logMAR chart presents the same number of symbols on each line, uses a font with letters that are equally legible at various sizes, and by varying the symbol size logarithmically, it is easier to use at nonstandard distances. As a consequence of these improvements, the logMAR chart has been proposed as a more reliable tool for measuring visual acuity. However, the logMAR chart has not yet been widely adopted.

It can be difficult to measure visual acuity in infants, young children, and illiterate adults. Special eye charts can be used. One version uses simple pictures or patters. Others are printed with the block letter "E" turned in different orientations, the so-called Tumbling E. The patient simply indicates which direction each "E" is facing. The [[Landolt C]] chart is similar: rows have circles with different segments missing, and the test-taker describes where each broken piece is located. The last two kinds of charts also reduce the possibility of the patient guessing the images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Vision screening in infants, children and youth|journal = Paediatrics &amp; Child Health|date = April 2009|issn = 1205-7088|pmc = 2690539|pmid = 20357924|pages = 246–248|volume = 14|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
Computer-based semi-automatic alternatives to the eye chart have been developed, but are not very common. They have several potential advantages, such as a more precise measurement and less examiner-induced bias.

If the person, particularly a young child, is unable to cooperate with visual acuity testing via an eye chart, practitioners can be alerted to possible deficits in visual acuity by asking parents whether the child appears to see well. A clue is that the child may hold objects close to the face when attempting to focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Futures: Guidelines for Health Supervision|last = Hagan|first = JF|publisher = Elk Grove|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Refractive error can be estimated via photography, a technique called photoscreening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Photoscreening – EyeWiki|url = http://eyewiki.aao.org/Photoscreening|website = eyewiki.aao.org|accessdate = 2015-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical details==
===Optotype Crowding===
Research has shown that optotype "crowding" reduces visual acuity at the fovea (as opposed to ''eccentric'' visual acuity) once the [[optotype]] characters are closer than 4.4 bar widths apart. This is referred to as the "critical spacing" for optotype letters at the fovea. For periphery visual acuity, the critical spacing is much greater, such that optotype characters closer than 15-20 bar widths apart negatively affect visual acuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc = 3837536|year = 2013|last1 = Coates|first1 = D.

'''Fairburn Ings Nature Reserve''' is a [[protected area]] in [[Yorkshire]], [[England]], which is noted for its avian [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lnr.naturalengland.org.uk/special/lnr/lnr_details.asp?C=0&amp;N=Fairburn%20Ings&amp;ID=150 |title=Fairburn Ings |series=Local Nature Reserves |publisher=Natural England |accessdate=23 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051609/http://www.lnr.naturalengland.org.uk/special/lnr/lnr_details.asp?C=0&amp;N=Fairburn%20Ings&amp;ID=150 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reserve has recorded around 280 bird species, remarkable for an inland site in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="YP"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This is explained by the site being on [[Flyway|migration route]]s as well as the diversity of [[habitat]]s.

==History==
It was designated a [[Local Nature Reserve]] in 1957 under the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949|National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act (1949)]].&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s it has been managed by the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] on behalf of the local naturalists who set it up.&lt;ref name="YP"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/reserve-welcomes-its-flying-visitors-1-2324449 |title=Reserve welcomes its flying visitors |last=Ratcliffe |first=R |date=7 November 2008 |newspaper=[[The Yorkshire Post]]|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Geography==
The reserve is situated in the Lower [[River Aire |Aire Valley]], to the south and west of [[Fairburn, North Yorkshire|Fairburn]], near [[Castleford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?startTopic=Designations&amp;activelayer=lnrIndex&amp;query=REF_CODE%3D%271008888%27 |title=Map of Fairburn Ings|series=Local Nature Reserves|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the whole of Fairburn &amp; Newton Ings [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|SSSI]].&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fairburn and Newton Ings|url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1004115.pdf|website=Natural England|accessdate=31 May 2016|page=1|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a Statutory [[Bird Sanctuary]] (one of only 10 in England) with a focus mainly on wildfowl and [[wader]]s, although many other birds can be seen. 

The word "[[ings]]" (singular "ing") is of Old Norse origin and means "damp or marshy land that floods", a reference to the area being flooded regularly by the [[River Aire]].
Lying alongside the River Aire, the {{convert|1000|acre}} nature reserve includes a large lake and a number of smaller lakes, ponds and dikes. The area has been the scene of industrial and mining operations for 150&amp;nbsp;years,&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; and, although the valley floods naturally, the permanent water bodies are the result of subsidence of former coal-mine workings, up to {{convert|600|m}} underground, providing habitats for [[wildfowl]] and many other birds.

The site is bordered by predominantly arable farmland to the north and east, and urban environments to the south and west. 
One third of the site has been developed from 26 million cubic metres&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/lifestyle/taleisuredaysout/10635394.Fairburn_Ings___A_nature_lover_s_paradise/ |title=Fairburn Ings - a nature lover's paradise |last=Mead |first=Helen |date=27 August 2013 |newspaper=[[Telegraph &amp; Argus]] |access-date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of colliery spoil which have been landscaped to create a large complex of herb rich grassland, wetlands and woodland.

Habitats at Fairburn Ings include flood meadows, wet fenland, marsh and [[reed bed]], woodland and scrub. 
Listed in terms of the [[United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan]], the reserve contains: 
* UK BAP habitats:
**[[Mesotrophic lake#Mesotrophic|mesotrophic lakes]],
**reedbed, 
**lowland meadow. 
* BAP species of these habitats include: [[grey partridge]] (''Perdix perdix''), [[European turtle dove|turtle dove]] (''Streptopelia turtur''), [[skylark]] (''Alauda arvense''), [[song thrush]] (''Turdus philatelist''), [[tree sparrow]] (''Passer montanus''), [[linnet]] (''Carduelis cannabina''), [[bullfinch]] (''Pyrrhula pyorrhoea''), [[reed bunting]] (''Emberiza schoeniclus''), [[corn bunting]] (''Milaria calandra''), [[European water vole|water vole]] (''Arvicola terrestris'' ) and [[pipistrelle bat]] (''Pipistrellus pippistrellus'').

Birds of conservation concern of these habitats include: the [[black-necked grebe]] (''Podiceps nigrocollis''), [[garganey]] (''Anas querquedula''), [[Common redshank|redshank]] (''Tringa totanus''), [[whooper swan]] (''Cygnus cygnus'') and [[golden plover]] (''Pluvialis apricalia'').

==Visitor facilities==
There is a visitor centre and five [[Bird hide|hide]]s.  Entrance to the reserve is free but there is a charge for car parking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Fairburn Ings|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/seenature/reserves/guide/f/fairburnings/about.aspx|website=RSPB|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18917">The domestic [[ferret]] is known to be affected by several distinct '''ferret health''' problems. Among the most common are cancers affecting the [[adrenal glands]], [[pancreas]], and [[Lymphoma in animals#Lymphoma in ferrets|lymphatic system]].  Viral diseases include [[canine distemper]] and influenza.  Certain health problems have also been linked to ferrets being neutered before sexual maturity was reached.{{Citation needed|reason=This is anecdotally popular in the ferret community  but needs a source to verify veracity|date=April 2014}}  Certain colors of ferret may also carry a genetic defect known as [[Waardenburg syndrome]].  Similar to domestic [[cat]]s, ferrets may also be affected by hairballs, or dental problems.

==Adrenal disease==
[[File:Megan the ferret has adrenal disease.jpg|thumb|right|Ferret with adrenal disease]]Adrenal disease, a growth of the [[adrenal glands]] that can be either [[hyperplasia]] or cancer, is most often diagnosed by signs like unusual hair loss, increased aggression, constant grooming of owner or other ferrets as well as themselves, difficulty urinating (caused by an enlarged prostate) or defecating, or agitation when urinating, and (in the case of females) an enlarged vulva. Signs of an enlarged prostate should be considered an emergency; even if the growth is benign, it can still cause a hormonal imbalance which can have devastating effects on the ferret's health.

Treatment options include surgery or cryosurgery to excise the affected glands, [[melatonin]] or deslorelin implants, which treat the symptoms but not the disease itself, and/or hormone therapy. The causes of adrenal disease are as yet uncertain, but speculated triggers include unnatural light cycles, diets based around processed ferret foods, and prepubescent neutering. It has also been suggested that there may be a hereditary component to adrenal disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |last=Johnson-Delaney |first=Cathy A |title=Proceedings of the Association of Exotic Mammal Veterinarians |publisher=AEMV 
 |year=2006 |url=http://www.aemv.org/Documents/2006_AEMV_proceedings_10.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-03-03 |deadurl=yes 
 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629140225/http://www.aemv.org/Documents/2006_AEMV_proceedings_10.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adrenal disease is usually detected during the spring or fall, as it affects the hormones that make the fur grow. When affected ferrets shed their winter coat, the fur does not grow back. The hair loss pattern is usually very specific for adrenal disease. It begins at the base of the tail and then continues up the back. Ferrets treated for adrenal disease may temporarily have severe hair loss as their bodies recover from the disease.

==Insulinoma==
[[Insulinoma]], a type of cancer of the [[islet cell]]s of the [[pancreas]], is the most common form of cancer in ferrets.&lt;ref name="Bakthavatchalu 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bakthavatchalu|first1=V|last2=Muthupalani|first2=S|last3=Marini|first3=RP|last4=Fox|first4=JG|title=Endocrinopathy and Aging in Ferrets.|journal=Veterinary pathology|date=March 2016|volume=53|issue=2|pages=349–65|doi=10.1177/0300985815623621|pmid=26936751|pmc=5397995}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most common in ferrets between the ages of 4 and 5 years but may also occur in younger ferrets. The growth of cancerous nodules on the lobes of the pancreas sometimes, but not always, leads to an increase in the production of [[insulin]], which regulates the rate at which the ferret's body metabolizes blood [[glucose]]. Too much insulin causes blood sugar to drop, resulting in lethargy, seizures, and ultimately death. Symptoms of an insulinoma attack include episodes of lethargy, drooling, pawing or foaming at the mouth, high pitched screams, staring "blankly" into space, and seizures.

The exact cause of insulinoma is unknown. It is speculated that the diets of domestic ferrets are too far removed from the natural diets of their polecat ancestors, and include too much sugar or simple carbohydrates.

Treatment for insulinoma may include surgical excision of the cancerous lobes, pharmaceutical treatment with steroids that suppress the production of insulin, supplemental changes in diet (most often poultry-based baby food), or a combination thereof. Unfortunately, the growth of the tumors cannot always be completely stopped, and the ferret will sometimes have a recurrence of symptoms. In an insulinoma attack, a temporary remedy to stabilize the ferret is any kind of a sugary syrup, such as corn syrup or honey.

==Lymphoma==
'''[[Lymphoma in animals#Lymphoma in ferrets|Lymphoma]]/lymphosarcoma''' is the most common [[malignancy]] in ferrets. Ferret lymphosarcoma occurs in two forms -- ''juvenile lymphosarcoma'', a fast-growing type that affects ferrets younger than two years, and ''adult lymphosarcoma'', a slower-growing form that affects ferrets four to seven years old.

In juvenile ferret lymphosarcoma, large, immature [[lymphocytes]] (lymphoblasts) rapidly invade the [[thymus]] or the organs of the abdominal cavity, particularly the [[liver]] and [[spleen]]. In '''adult ferret lymphosarcoma''', the lymph nodes in the limbs and abdominal cavity become swollen early on due to invasion by small, mature lymphocytes. Invasion of organs, such as the liver, kidney, lungs, and spleen, occurs later on, and the disease may be far advanced before symptoms are noticeable.

As in humans, ferret lymphosarcoma can be treated surgically, with radiation therapy, chemotherapy or a combination thereof. The long-term prognosis is rarely bright, however, and this treatment is intended to improve quality of life with the disease.

==Viral diseases==
===Epizootic catarrhal enteritis===
Epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE) is a viral disease that first appeared in the northeastern US in 1994, is an inflammation of the mucous membranes in the intestine. The condition manifests itself as severe diarrhea (often of a bright green color), loss of appetite, and severe weight loss. The virus can be passed via fluids and indirectly between humans. Although it was often fatal when first discovered, ECE is less of a threat today.

===Ferret systemic coronavirus (FSC)===
The [[coronavirus]] which causes ECE has a counterpart strain that has more systemic effects with a higher mortality rate. This systemic syndrome has been compared to [[Feline infectious peritonitis]] in cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Aleutian disease virus===
[[Aleutian disease|Aleutian disease virus]] (ADV) is a [[parvovirus]] discovered among [[mink]] in the [[Aleutian Islands]] in the early 20th century. In ferrets, the virus affects the immune system (causing it to produce non-neutralizing [[antibody|antibodies]]) and many internal organs, particularly the [[kidney]]s. There is no cure or vaccine for the disease, and ferrets may carry the virus for months or years without any signs.

===Canine distemper===
[[Canine distemper]] (CD) is an extremely contagious virus that is considered always fatal. Being strict indoor pets does not necessarily protect ferrets, as owners may bring the virus home on their clothes or their shoes. The distemper virus is very short-lived in hot, dry weather, but may persist on hands or surfaces for much longer in cool, damp weather. The only protection against the virus is vaccination, but that is not without controversy as there have been reports, particularly from the US, of ferrets going into [[anaphylactic shock]] after being vaccinated against CD. There is some anecdotal evidence that occurrence of a vaccine reaction is related to a low blood sugar level, and that feeding the ferret a sweet paste-type nutritional supplement shortly before the vaccination to raise the blood glucose has reduced the incidence of reactions.

A ferret with partial immunity to distemper can be exposed to canine distemper and go through an incubation period of up to six weeks before showing signs of infection, as compared to a few days in an unvaccinated animal. Signs can include runny nose, discharge from the eyes, fever, up to {{convert|107|F|C}}, and severe malaise, followed by development of changes in the skin including discoloration and thickening of the nose (a pink nose will develop an orange coloration), measles-like sores on the chin and belly, and thick crusting of the pads of the feet (hyperkeratosis). The discharge is highly contagious to other unvaccinated ferrets and canines. If the ferret survives the initial acute phase of the disease, they will die within a few weeks from a progressive and incurable neurological infection, progressing to severe epileptic seizures and death.

===Influenza===
Influenza, essentially the same disease and same agent that occur in humans, is caused by an [[Orthomyxoviridae|othomyxovirus]] that can be passed from ferrets to humans and from humans to ferrets. Ferrets have served as experimental animal models in the study of influenza virus. Smith, Andrews, Laidlaw (1933) inoculated ferrets intra-nasally with human naso-pharyngeal washes, which produced a form of influenza that spread to other cage mates. The human influenza virus ([[Influenza A virus|Influenza type A]]) was transmitted from an infected ferret to a junior investigator, from whom it was subsequently re-isolated. The virus usually affects the nasal epithelium but can cause pneumonia. Signs include anorexia, fever, sneezing, nasal and ocular discharges and usually spontaneous recovery in 4 days or less. Antibiotic use can prevent complicating secondary bacterial infections .

==Foot rot==
A common ailment which can be fatal in ferrets is foot rot, a form of fungal infection which attacks the feet and sometimes spreads to the tail. It initially appears as a small, yellow, scab-like infection. If untreated, it can cover the feet, and later the entire body.  Foot rot is normally caused by poor cage hygiene, i.e., excessive feces accumulation.

==Neutering==
Like [[Carnivora|many other carnivores]], ferrets have scent glands near their anuses, the secretions from which are used in [[Spraying (animal behavior)|scent marking]].  Ferrets recognize other individuals from these anal gland secretions, as well as the sex of unfamiliar individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Males, if not neutered, are extremely musky. It is considered preferable to delay neutering until sexual maturity has been reached, at approximately six to eight months old, after the full descent of the testicles. Neutering the male will reduce the smell to almost nothing. The same applies for females, but spaying them is also important for their own health. Unless they are going to be used for [[Selective breeding|breeding]] purposes, female ferrets will go into extended [[Estrous cycle|heat]]. A female that does not mate can die of [[aplastic anemia]] without medical intervention. It is possible to use a vasectomised male to take a female out of heat.

Due to speculation on the possible effects of the [[photoperiod]] effect on the ferret's adrenal gland, some owners prefer to house their pets outdoors in sheds, and not indoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pettribune.net/2001/090101/exotic.html |title=Pet Tribune Online. Possible Effects of the Photoperiod on the Adrenal Gland of the Ferret.  Retrieved on 10-27-2007. |access-date=2010-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824084455/http://pettribune.net/2001/090101/exotic.html |archive-date=2011-08-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male ferrets may be chemically [[castrated]] using a [[deslorelin]] implant, which lasts for at least a year.&lt;ref name="Jekl 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jekl|first1=V|last2=Hauptman|first2=K|title=Reproductive Medicine in Ferrets|journal=The veterinary clinics of North America. Exotic animal practice|date=May 2017|volume=20|issue=2|pages=629–663|doi=10.1016/j.cvex.2016.11.016|pmid=28340892}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males with a  deslorelin implant are less aggressive to other males compared to males castrated surgically.&lt;ref name="Jekl 2017"/&gt;

==Congenital sensorineural deafness==
A high proportion of ferrets with white markings which form coat patterns known as a blaze, badger, or panda coat, such as a stripe extending from their face down the back of their head to their shoulder blades, or a fully white head, have a congenital deafness (partial or total) which is similar to [[Waardenburg syndrome]] in humans.&lt;ref name="Strain 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strain|first1=GM|title=The genetics of deafness in domestic animals|journal=Frontiers in Veterinary Science|date=2015|volume=2|pages=29|doi=10.3389/fvets.2015.00029|pmid=26664958|pmc=4672198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrets without white markings, but with premature graying of the coat, are also more likely to have some deafness than ferrets with solid coat colors which do not show this trait.&lt;ref name="Piazza 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piazza|first1=S|last2=Abitbol|first2=M|last3=Gnirs|first3=K|last4=Huynh|first4=M|last5=Cauzinille|first5=L|title=Prevalence of deafness and association with coat variations in client-owned ferrets|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|date=1 May 2014|volume=244|issue=9|pages=1047–52|doi=10.2460/javma.244.9.1047|pmid=24739114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most albino ferrets are not deaf; if deafness does occur in an albino ferret, this may be due to an underlying white coat pattern which is obscured by the albinism.&lt;ref name="Strain 2015"/&gt;

In humans, Waardenburg syndrome leads to higher instances of reproductive disorders and a reduced life expectancy; these phenomena have been reported by some ferret owners, but {{as of|2016|lc=y}}, there is no scientific evidence correlating these findings with congenital sensorineural deafness.&lt;ref name="Piazza 2014"/&gt; Except for albinism, the genetics of coat color in ferrets is not known, and the genes that cause deafness have not been identified.&lt;ref name="Strain 2015"/&gt;

Owners may not easily identify deafness in their ferret; affected ferrets may have behavioral or training problems, or may have greater than usual social conflict with other ferrets.&lt;ref name="Piazza 2014"/&gt; A ferret's hearing can be tested by a [[Brainstem auditory evoked potential|brainstem auditory evoked response test]], with the ferret under [[General anaesthesia|general anesthesia]].&lt;ref name="Piazza 2014"/&gt;

==Hairballs==
Hairballs can occur in ferrets, but are not readily expelled by vomiting like the way cats deal with them. One or more hairballs in a ferret may lead to loss of appetite and subsequent weight loss. A hairball may enter the intestine and cause a life-threatening obstruction. Ferrets typically replace their coats twice a year, and at that time require brushing to remove loose hairs before they can be ingested, and possibly administration of a hairball remedy as a preventive. Artificial lighting or administration of certain medications may alter the normal spring and fall seasonal coat changes in the ferret.

==Tartar and dental abrasion==
[[Image:buffy teeth.jpg|thumb|A ferret with white healthy teeth and pink gums]]
[[Calculus (dental)|Dental calculus]] (tartar) is a hard substance formed on the teeth from the mineralization of plaque.  Dental tartar primarily comes from wet food which gets stuck to the teeth for extended periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weaselwords.com/page/ferret_art008.php Owners guide to ferret grooming]&lt;/ref&gt;  Tartar can be avoided by ferrets eating raw meat, bones and preferably whole prey. The biomechanics of consuming meat and bones will keep the teeth clean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishferretclub.co.uk/feedingferrets.htm British Ferret club - Feeding Ferrets]&lt;/ref&gt;  Left to itself, tartar may lead to gingivitis which in turn can lead to a dental abscess, bone loss, infections which may spread bacteria through the bloodstream to internal organs and lead to death if not treated.  Tartar can be removed either mechanical or by ultrasound at a veterinarian (this usually involves anesthesia), a small toothbrush can also be used as a preventive measure if one is unable to feed the animal with raw meat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2ndchance.info/ferretteeth.htm Caring for your ferret's Teeth]&lt;/ref&gt;  Tartar can be prevented by feeding raw food or giving specially made gelatin treats for ferrets.

[[Abrasion (dental)|Dental abrasion]] or tooth wear is common in ferrets, and is caused by mechanical wear of the teeth.  Eating manufactured dry food (kibble) will erode (due to the hard and extremely dry kibble) the carnassial teeth of the ferret{{Citation needed|reason=Is there any evidence for this?|date=April 2018}} , the wear from the eating kibble can become significant with old age (after three to five years). If teeth are overly ground down, a ferret cannot use them as scissors to eat raw meat. Tooth erosion eventually affects a ferret's ability to eat solid food.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivis.org/journals/exoticDVM/9-2/Church.pdf The Impact of Diet on the Dentition of the Domesticated Ferret]&lt;/ref&gt; Dental abrasion can also be caused by excessive chewing on fabrics or toys, and cage biting. If the ferret engages in these activities a lot, it might be a sign of boredom, and more stimulating activities (such as play) should rectify the situation.

Due to [[lawsuit]]s, [[publicity]], and other actions against the corporations responsible for the pollution, as well as the creation of the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Environmental Agency]] in 1971, increased public awareness, and changes in industrial practices, the incidence of these kinds of diseases declined after the 1970s. These cases also set precedents for private tort law and civil law in issues of compensation for technology-related mass damage which continue to have repercussions in legal cases in Japan today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kawamura|first=Hiroki|date=2018|title=The relation between law and technology in Japan: liability for technology-related mass damage in the cases of Minamata disease, asbestos, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|journal=Contemporary Japan|volume=30|issue=1|pages=3–27|doi=10.1080/18692729.2018.1423459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Itai-itai disease ==
Itai-itai disease first occurred in 1912 within [[Toyama Prefecture]]. This disease was given the name "itai-itai" because this was the phrase victims would frequently cry out; it translates into "it-hurts it-hurts disease".

=== Cause of itai-itai ===
The cause of itai-itai disease was determined to be [[cadmium poisoning]] in the [[drinking water]] from the [[Jinzū River]] basin. The source of cadmium was discovered to be from [[Mitsui Mining and Smelting Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wound Left by the Sharp Knife of Industrial Pollution|url=http://www1.wlsh.tyc.edu.tw/~globalschoolnet/a6.html|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitsui Mining began to discharge cadmium into the Jinzū River in 1910. The cadmium poisoned the river, thus poisoning locals' source of water. Any person who drank that water or ate food that was grown with the contaminated water, such as rice, would be likely to show signs of itai-itai disease.

=== Symptoms of itai-itai ===
The first symptoms were spine and leg pain. However, as the disease progresses symptoms include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Joshua W.|title=What is ouch ouch or Itai itai disease?|url=http://www.accessscience.com/studycenter.aspx?main=9&amp;questionID=4978|publisher=McGraw Hill Education|accessdate=10 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113021200/http://www.accessscience.com/studycenter.aspx?main=9&amp;questionID=4978|archivedate=13 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*debilitating [[pain]]
*[[bone fractures]] from mild traumas or activities (e.g., coughing or walking)
*skeletal deformities
*[[anemia]]
*[[kidney disorders]]

=== Aftermath of itai-itai ===
Most victims of itai-itai disease were confined to bed because walking caused severe pain. Residents of the surrounding area that were harmed by this disease filed a lawsuit against Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting Company in 1968. Residents won this lawsuit and began to conduct negotiations. Mitsui Mining formally admitted that itai-itai disease was caused by their discharge of cadmium into the Jinzū River. Mitsui Mining was also obliged to pay recovery costs for the land. This meant that they had to ensure the poisoned land was returned to a safe and cultivable state.

== Minamata disease ==
The first report of [[Minamata disease]] originated in [[Minamata]] in [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] in the year 1956. Many of the earliest patients became insane from the symptoms and in some cases died within a month of being afflicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Things to know about Minamata Disease|url=http://soshisha.org/english/10tishiki_e/10chishiki_e.htm|publisher=The Minamata Environmental Creation Development Project Steering Committee|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an extensive investigation, the Minamata disease was identified as a heavy metal poisoning, specifically [[mercury poisoning|methylmercury poisoning]], transmitted by the ingestion of contaminated fish from [[Minamata Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minamata Disease The History and Measures|url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/chemi/hs/minamata2002/index.html|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[methylmercury]] inside the contaminated fish attacked the afflicted patient’s [[central nervous system]], which caused a variety of symptoms.

=== Symptoms of Minamata disease===
*numbing in the arms and legs
*impairment of balance
*fatigue
*[[ringing in the ears]]
*[[tunnel vision]]
*[[loss of hearing]]
*decrease in communication skills (slurred speech)
Most patients exhibited combinations of symptoms and did not show all symptoms.
[[Taiji dolphin drive hunt#Health risks|National-institute-for-minamata-disease says 182 taiji-residents have extremely-high-mercury-level but do not display any symptoms of mercury-poisoning.]]

=== Chisso Corporation ===
The cause of this contamination in Minamata bay was then traced back to [[Chisso Corporation]]’s dumping of [[methylmercury]] into Minamata Bay. Chisso Corporation produced [[acetaldehyde]] using [[water]], [[acetylene]], [[mercury(II) sulfate]] as a catalyst and [[manganese dioxide]] or since August 1951, [[ferric sulfide]] as a co-catalyst. [[Acetaldehyde]] reacts with [[acetic anhydride]] in order to produce [[ethylidene diacetate]], which is heated to produce [[vinyl acetate]]. [[Acetaldehyde]] was also used to produce [[acetic acid]] by oxidizing acetaldehyde and [[vinyl chloride]], 
which is [[polymerized]] to make [[PVC]]; however, the use of ferric sulfide had a downside: methylmercury (or organic mercury) was a by-product in the making of these chemicals due to its use. The methylmercury was then dumped into Minamata Bay as chemical waste. Chisso decided not to stop the use of the mentioned catalysts or the dumping of their byproducts into the bay until 1966. Today, Chisso makes compensation payments to all certified (recognized) patients of Minamata disease. Over 50 hectares of the bay were reclaimed, using the contaminated sludge from the bottom of the bay with a non-contaminated layer of soil on top.

=== Aftermath of Minamata disease ===
In 1970, the [[Japanese Water Pollution Control Act]], which states that all factories are required by law to regulate disposal of dangerous chemicals, was enacted. In 1977, the Japanese government took on the task of cleaning Minamata Bay by vacuuming out 1.5&amp;nbsp;million cubic metres of methylmercury-contaminated sludge from the bottom of the bay and using them to reclaim over 50 hectares of the bay along with non-contaminated soil on top. Then in 1997, after fourteen years and $359&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griesbauer|first=Laura|title=The Minamata Bay Incident|url=http://www.csa.com/discoveryguides/mercury/review5.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Governor of Kumamoto Prefecture deemed Minamata Bay safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pollack|first=Andrew|title=Japan Call Mercury-Poisoned Bay Safe Now|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/30/world/japan-calls-mercury-poisoned-bay-safe-now.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Niigata Minamata disease ==
In 1965, a number of patients in [[Niigata Prefecture]] exhibited signs of Minamata disease. Niigata Minamata was caused by [[methylmercury]] poisoning in the Agano River basin. However, this second outbreak of Minamata disease was discovered early on. The degree of this outbreak was minimal{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=April 2014}} compared to that of the first Minamata disease that took place in [[Kumamoto prefecture]]. Investigation of the cause of the disease was given to the [[Niigata University]] medical department. There were a number of factors that could be the cause of this outbreak. Along the Agano River basin there were several plants that used mercury in production, agricultural chemicals were widely used in the area, and the last possible cause of the outbreak was said to be the cause of an earthquake that took place a year before the disease was discovered in Niigata.

=== Symptoms of Niigata Minamata disease ===
As the name implies, Niigata Minamata disease is similar to Minamata disease; they both share the similar symptoms:
* numbness in the arms and legs
* impairment of balance
* fatigue
* ringing in the ears
* tunnel vision
* loss of hearing
* decrease in communication skills

=== Showa Denko ===
In the spring of 1966, the research team determined the most likely cause to the dumping of methylmercury from [[Showa Denko]] Corporation factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/uu35ie/uu35ie0d.htm|title=VII. Rediscovery of the Minamata disease in Niigata|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Showa Denko was located upstream on the Agano River and, just like the Chisso corporation, produced methylmercury as a by-product and then dumped it into the Agano river. Much like Chisso corporation, Showa Denko declined all charges that they were at fault for the Niigata Minamata outbreak.

=== Aftermath of Niigata Minamata disease ===
After much controversy, Showa Denko was found guilty of negligence and was then forced to pay compensation payments to all victims of Niigata Minamata disease. In the year that Niigata Minamata was discovered, 26 people were designated disease patients, and five died as a result of the methylmercury poisoning.

== Yokkaichi asthma==
[[Yokkaichi]] is a city in the center of Japan in [[Mie Prefecture]]; known as the "town of petroleum" as it produces almost a quarter of the total petroleum in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIR POLLUTION IN YOKKAICHI AREA WITH SPECIAL REGARDS TO THE PROBLEM OF "YOKKAICHI -ASTHMA|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/indhealth1963/2/2/2_2_87/_pdf|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the first oil refinery in this area first began in 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIR POLLUTION IN YOKKAICHI AREA WITH SPECIAL REGARDS TO THE PROBLEM OF "YOKKAICHI -ASTHMA"|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/indhealth1963/2/2/2_2_87/_pdf|publisher=Department of Public Health, School of Medicine, Mie Prefectural University, Torii-cho, Tsu, Mie-Ken}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and after construction many respiratory diseases emerged within the city and among neighboring districts.

=== Cause of Yokkaichi asthma ===
In the middle of this city was the largest heavy oil-fired power station and refinery in Japan during this time period. Unfortunately, this refinery was not equipped with machines that could lower the [[sulfur dioxide]] emissions before releasing them into the air. In the early 1960s, respiratory diseases began to emerge in the general population of Yokkaichi and even in some neighboring districts. This increase in respiratory problems was then specified as [[Yokkaichi asthma]]. This form of asthma was prevalent within Yokkaichi — 5–10% of inhabitants aged 40 in Yokkaichi were reported to suffer from chronic bronchitis, whereas less than 3% suffered from the same disease in non-polluted areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Mortality and life expectancy of Yokkaichi Asthma patients, Japan:   Late effects of air pollution in 1960–70s|journal=Environmental Health|volume=7|pages=8|doi=10.1186/1476-069X-7-8|pmid=18302742|pmc=2311286|year=2008|last1=Guo|first1=Peng|last2=Yokoyama|first2=Kazuhito|last3=Suenaga|first3=Masami|last4=Kida|first4=Hirotaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yokkaichi asthma relief system ===
To offer support for many of the victims of this disease, a public release system for air pollution was established in 1965. This set forth that all people in the Yokkaichi area who met the following criteria were paid by the program:
#Specific diseases such as bronchial  asthma, chronic  bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, and their complications.
#In specific areas where the prevalence of that disease has increased.
#Three years of residence within the specified area.
Today, there are many laws regulating the amount of sulfur dioxide a factory can release into the air. These laws help keep the disaster of Yokkaichi Asthma from happening once again within Japan's borders.

[[File:Cholera bacteria SEM.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Scanning electron microscope]] image of ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]''. This is the bacterium that causes [[cholera]].]]

The '''germ theory of disease''' is the currently accepted [[scientific theory]] of disease. It states that many [[disease]]s are caused by [[microorganism]]s. These small organisms, too small to see without magnification, invade humans, animals, and other living hosts. Their growth and reproduction within their hosts can cause a disease. "Germ" may refer to not just a [[bacterium]] but to any type of microorganism, especially one which causes disease, such as [[protists]], [[fungi]], [[viruses]], [[prions]], or [[viroids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/germ|title=germ – definition of germ in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microorganisms that cause disease are called [[pathogen]]s, and the diseases they cause are called [[infectious disease]]s. Even when a pathogen is the principal cause of a disease, environmental and hereditary factors often influence the severity of the disease, and whether a potential host individual becomes infected when exposed to the pathogen.

The germ theory was proposed by [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] in 1546, and expanded upon by [[Marcus von Plenciz]] in 1762. Such views were held in disdain, however, and [[Galen|Galen's]] [[miasma theory]] remained dominant among scientists and doctors. The nature of this doctrine prevented them from understanding how diseases actually progressed, with predictable consequences. By the early nineteenth century, [[smallpox vaccination]] was commonplace in Europe, though doctors were unaware of how it worked or how to extend the principle to other diseases. Similar treatments had been prevalent in India from just before AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7294/|last1=Henderson|first1=Donald A|last2=Moss|first2=Bernard|title=Smallpox and Vaccinia, Vaccines|year=1999|publisher=W. B. Saunders Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{#tag:ref| In a 1767 report to the College of Physicians in London, John Zephaniah Holwell mentions the practice of Smallpox vaccinations by Ayurvedic doctors and their explanations of the cause of the disease.|group=N}} A transitional period began in the late 1850s with the work of [[Louis Pasteur]].  This work was later extended by [[Robert Koch]] in the 1880s. By the end of the 1880s the miasma theory was struggling to compete with the germ theory of disease. Eventually, a "golden era" of [[bacteriology]] ensued, during which the theory quickly led to the identification of the actual organisms that cause many diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/cholera_prevailingtheories_a2.html|title=BRIEF HISTORY DURING THE SNOW ERA|work=ucla.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/3035/Germ-Theory.html|title=Germ Theory|work=jrank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Viruses were discovered in the 1890s.

== Miasma theory ==
[[File:Cholera art.jpg|thumb|A representation by [[Robert Seymour (illustrator)|Robert Seymour]] of the cholera epidemic depicts the spread of the disease in the form of poisonous air.]]
{{Main article|Miasma theory}}

The miasma theory was the predominant theory of disease transmission before the germ theory took hold towards the end of the 19th century. It held that diseases such as [[cholera]], [[chlamydia infection]], or the [[Black Death]] were caused by a ''[[Miasma theory|miasma]]'' (μίασμα, [[Ancient Greek]]: "pollution"), a noxious form of "bad air" emanating from rotting organic matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution="miasma theory" |title=A Dictionary of Public Health |editor=John M. Last |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |location=Westminster College, Pennsylvania |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t235.e2851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miasma was considered to be a poisonous vapor or mist filled with particles from decomposed matter (miasmata) that was identifiable by its foul smell. The theory posited that diseases were the product of environmental factors such as contaminated water, foul air, and poor hygienic conditions. Such infections, according to the theory, were not passed between individuals but would affect those within a locale that gave rise to such vapors.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

== Development ==

=== Pre-19th century ===

In [[Age of the Earth|Antiquity]], the Greek historian [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 – c. 400 BC) was the first person to state, in his account of the [[plague of Athens]], that diseases could spread from an infected person to others.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Charles and Dorothea (1917) "The scientific position of Girolamo Fracastoro [1478?–1553] with especial reference to the source, character and influence of his theory of infection," ''Annals of Medical History'', '''1''' :  1–34 ; [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015016778261;view=1up;seq=28 see p. 14.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides with Richard Crawley, trans., ''History of the Peloponnesian War'' (London, England:  J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1910), Book III, § 51, [https://archive.org/stream/pelocrawleyr00thucuoft#page/130/mode/2up pp. 131–132.]  From pp. 131–132:  " … there was the awful spectacle of men dying like sheep, through having caught the infection in nursing each other.  This caused the greatest mortality.  On the one hand, if they were afraid to visit each other, they perished from neglect; indeed many houses were emptied of their inmates for want of a nurse: on the other, if they ventured to do so, death was the consequence."&lt;/ref&gt;  One theory of the spread of contagious diseases that were not spread by direct contact was that they were spread by "seeds" (Latin:  ''semina'') that were present in the air.  In his poem, ''De rerum natura'' (On the Nature of Things, ca. 56 BC), the Roman poet [[Lucretius]] (ca. 99 BC – ca. 55 BC) stated that the world contained various "seeds", some of which could sicken a person if they were inhaled or if they contaminated his food.&lt;ref&gt;Nutton, Vivian (1983) "The seeds of disease: an explanation of contagion and infection from the Greeks to the Renaissance," ''Medical History'', '''27''' (1) :  1–34 ; see p. 10. Available at:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1139262/?page=23 U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius with Rev. John S. Watson, trans., ''On the Nature of Things'' (London, England:  Henry G. Bohn, 1851), Book VI, lines 1093–1130, pp. 291–292 ; [https://archive.org/stream/onnaturethingsd00carugoog#page/n320/mode/2up see especially p. 292.]  From p. 292:  "This new malady and pest, therefore, either suddenly falls into the water, or penetrates into the very corn, or into other food of men and cattle.  Or even, as may be the case, the infection remains suspended in the air itself; and when, as we breathe, we inhale the air mingled with it, we must necessarily absorb those ''seeds of disease'' into our body."&lt;/ref&gt;  The Roman statesman [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] (116–27 BC) wrote, in his ''Rerum rusticarum libri III'' (Three Books on Agriculture, 36 BC): "Precautions must also be taken in the neighborhood of swamps […] because there are bred certain minute creatures which cannot be seen by the eyes, which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and there cause serious diseases."&lt;ref&gt;Varro, Marcus Terentius with Lloyd Storr-Best, trans., ''Varro On Farming'' (London, England:  G. Bell and Sons, Ltd., 1912), Book 1, Ch. XII, [https://archive.org/stream/onfarmingmterent00varruoft#page/38/mode/2up/search/diseases p. 39.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Greek physician Galen (AD 129 – ca. 200/ca. 216) speculated in his ''On Initial Causes'' (ca. AD 175) that some patients might have "seeds of fever".&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''On the Different Types of Fever'' (ca. AD 175), Galen speculated that plagues were spread by "certain seeds of plague", which were present in the air.&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  And in his ''Epidemics'' (ca. AD 176–178), Galen explained that patients might relapse during recovery from a fever because some "seed of the disease" lurked in their bodies, which would cause a recurrence of the disease if the patients didn't follow a physician's therapeutic regimen.&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, [[Isidore of Seville]] (ca. 560 – 636) mentioned "plague-bearing seeds" (''pestifera semina'') in his ''On the Nature of Things'' (ca. AD 613).&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in 1345, [[Tommaso del Garbo]] (ca. 1305–1370) of Bologna, Italy mentioned Galen's "seeds of plague" in his work ''Commentaria non parum utilia in libros Galeni'' (Helpful commentaries on the books of Galen).&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian scholar and physician Girolamo Fracastoro proposed in 1546 in his book ''De Contagione et Contagiosis Morbis'' that epidemic diseases are caused by transferable seed-like entities (''seminaria morbi'') that transmit infection by direct or indirect contact, or even without contact over long distances. The diseases were categorised based on how they were transmitted, and how long they could lie dormant.

Italian physician [[Francesco Redi]] provided early evidence against [[spontaneous generation]]. He devised an experiment in 1668 in which he used three jars. He placed a [[meatloaf]] and egg in each of the three jars. He had one of the jars open, another one tightly sealed, and the last one covered with gauze. After a few days, he observed that the meatloaf in the open jar was covered by maggots, and the jar covered with gauze had maggots on the surface of the gauze. However, the tightly sealed jar had no maggots inside or outside it. He also noticed that the maggots were found only on surfaces that were accessible by flies. From this he concluded that spontaneous generation is not a plausible theory.

Microorganisms are said to have been first directly observed in the 1670s by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], an early pioneer in [[microbiology]]. Yet [[Athanasius Kircher]] may have done so prior. When Rome was struck by the bubonic plague in 1656, Kircher spent days on end caring for the sick. Searching for a cure, Kircher observed microorganisms under the microscope and invented the germ theory of disease, which he outlined in his ''Scrutinium pestis physico-medicum'' (Rome 1658).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mjt.org/exhibits/kircher.html|title=The Life and Work of Athanaseus Kircher, S.J.|work=mjt.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building on Leeuwenhoek's work, physician [[Nicolas Andry]] argued in 1700 that microorganisms he called "worms" were responsible for [[smallpox]] and other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The History of the Germ Theory|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume= 1 |year=1888|page=312 |issue= 1415 | url = https://archive.org/stream/britishmedicaljo11888brit#page/312/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1720, [[Richard Bradley (botanist)|Richard Bradley]] theorised that the plague and 'all pestilential distempers' were caused by 'poisonous insects', living creatures viewable only with the help of microscopes.&lt;ref name=Santer&gt;Melvin Santer, ‘Richard Bradley: A Unified, Living Agent Theory of the Cause of Infectious Diseases of Plants, Animals, and Humans in the First Decades of the 18th Century’, in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, Volume 52, Number 4, Autumn, 2009, pp. 566-578&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1762, the Austrian physician Marcus Antonius von Plenciz (1705-1786) published a book titled ''Opera medico-physica''. It outlined a theory of contagion stating that specific 'animalculae' in the soil and the air were responsible for causing specific diseases. Von Plenciz noted the distinction between diseases which are both epidemic and contagious (like measles and dysentry), and diseases which are contagious but not epidemic (like rabies and leprosy).&lt;ref&gt;Winslow, Charles-Edward Amory (1967). Conquest of Epidemic Disease: A Chapter in the History of Ideas. Hafner Publishing Co Ltd. {{ISBN|978-0028548807}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The book cites Anton van Leeuwenhoek to show how ubiquitous such animalculae are, and was unique for describing the presence of germs in ulcerating wounds. Ultimately, the theory espoused by von Plenciz was not accepted by the scientific community.

=== Agostino Bassi ===
The Italian [[Agostino Bassi]] was the first person to prove that a disease was caused by a microorganism when he conducted a series of experiments between 1808 and 1813, demonstrating that a "vegetable parasite" caused a disease in silkworms known as ''calcinaccio''{{mdash}}this disease was devastating the French silk industry at the time. The "vegetable parasite" is now known to be a fungus pathogenic to insects called ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'' (named after Bassi).

=== Ignaz Semmelweis ===
[[Ignaz Semmelweis]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[obstetrician]] working at the [[Vienna General Hospital]] (''Allgemeines Krankenhaus'') in 1847, noticed the dramatically high maternal mortality from [[puerperal fever]] following births assisted by doctors and medical students. However, those attended by midwives were relatively safe. Investigating further, Semmelweis made the connection between puerperal fever and examinations of delivering women by doctors, and further realized that these physicians had usually come directly from autopsies. Asserting that puerperal fever was a [[Contagious disease|contagious]] disease and that matter from autopsies were implicated in its development, Semmelweis made doctors wash their hands with chlorinated lime water before examining pregnant women.  He then documented a sudden reduction in the mortality rate from 18% to 2.2% over a period of a year.  Despite this evidence, he and his theories were [[Contemporary reaction to Ignaz Semmelweis|rejected]] by most of the contemporary medical establishment.

=== Gideon Mantell ===

[[Gideon Mantell]], the Sussex doctor more famous for discovering [[dinosaur fossils]], spent time with his microscope, and speculated in his ''Thoughts On Animalcules'' (1850) that perhaps "many of the most serious maladies which afflict humanity, are produced by peculiar states of invisible animalcular life".&lt;ref&gt;Pg. 90 of "The invisible world revealed by the microscope or, thoughts on animalcules.", second edition, 1850 (May have appeared in first edition, too. (Revise date in article to 1846, if so.))&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Snow ===
{{Main article|1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak}}
[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Original map by John Snow showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of cholera cases in the London epidemic of 1854]]
[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] was a skeptic of the then-dominant [[miasma theory of disease|miasma theory]]. Even though the germ theory of disease pioneered by Girolamo Fracastoro had not yet achieved full development or widespread currency,  Snow demonstrated a clear understanding of germ theory in his writings.  He first published his theory in an 1849 essay ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera,''  in which he correctly suggested that the fecal-oral route was the mode of communication, and that the disease replicated itself in the lower intestines.  He even proposed in his 1855 edition of the work, that the structure of cholera was that of a cell.

{{bquote|Having rejected effluvia and the poisoning of the blood in the first instance, and being led to the conclusion that'' ''the disease is something that acts directly on the alimentary canal, the excretions of the sick at once suggest themselves as containing some material which being accidentally swallowed might attach itself to the mucous membrane of the small intestines, and there multiply itself by appropriation of surrounding matter, in virtue of molecular changes going on within it, or capable of going on, as soon as it is placed in congenial circumstances.||John Snow (1849)}}

{{bquote|For the morbid matter of cholera having the property of reproducing its own kind, must necessarily have some sort of structure, most likely that of a cell.  It is no objection to this view that the structure of the cholera poison cannot be recognized by the microscope, for the matter of smallpox and of chancre can only be recognized by their effects, and not by their physical properties.||John Snow (1855)}}

Snow's 1849 recommendation that water be "filtered and boiled before it is used" is one of the first practical applications of germ theory in the area of public health and is the antecedent to the modern [[boil-water advisory]].

In 1855 he published a second edition of his article, documenting his more elaborate investigation of the effect of the water supply in the [[Soho]], London epidemic of 1854.

By talking to local residents, he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street (now [[Broadwick Street]]). Although Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the [[Broad Street pump]] did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle. This action has been commonly credited as ending the outbreak, but Snow observed that the epidemic may have already been in rapid decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Snow |title=On the Mode of Communication of Cholera |location=London |publisher=J. Churchill |year=1849 |url=http://resource.nlm.nih.gov/0050707 |quote=There is no doubt that the mortality was much diminished, as I said before, by the flight of the population, which commenced soon after the outbreak; but the attacks had so far diminished before the use of the water was stopped, that it is impossible to decide whether the well still contained the cholera poison in an active state, or whether, from some cause, the water had become free from it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow later used a [[dot distribution map|dot map]] to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump. He also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. He showed that the [[Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company]] was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the [[Thames]] and delivering the water to homes, leading to an increased incidence of cholera. Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography. It is regarded as one of the founding events of the science of [[epidemiology]].

Later, researchers discovered that this public well had been dug only three feet from an old [[cesspit]], which had begun to leak fecal bacteria.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The diapers of a baby, who had contracted cholera from another source, had been washed into this cesspit. Its opening was originally under a nearby house, which had been rebuilt farther away after a fire. The city had widened the street and the cesspit was lost. It was common at the time to have a cesspit under most homes. Most families tried to have their raw sewage collected and dumped in the Thames to prevent their cesspit from filling faster than the sewage could decompose into the soil.

After the cholera epidemic had subsided, government officials replaced the handle on the Broad Street pump. They had responded only to the urgent threat posed to the population, and afterward they rejected Snow's theory. To accept his proposal would have meant accepting the fecal-oral method transmission of disease, which they dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Chapelle |chapter=Ch. 5: Hidden Life, Hidden Death |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGVzCQgjEIC&amp;pg=PA82 |title=Wellsprings |location=New Brunswick NJ |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8135-3614-9 |pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Louis Pasteur ===
[[File:Louis Pasteur Experiment.svg|thumb|Louis Pasteur’s pasteurization experiment illustrates the fact that the spoilage of liquid was caused by particles in the air rather than the air itself. These experiments were important pieces of evidence supporting the idea of germ theory of disease.]]
The more formal experiments on the relationship between germ and disease were conducted by Louis Pasteur between the year 1860 and 1864. He discovered the pathology of the puerperal fever&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/pasteur/louis/exgerm/complete.html |chapter=(translated from French) |trans-chapter=On the extension of the germ theory to the etiology of certain common diseases |first=Louis |last=Pasteur |others=Ernst, H.C. (trans) |year=1880 |origyear=May 1880 |title=Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences |volume=XC |pages=1033–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the pyogenic vibrio in the blood, and suggested using [[boric acid]] to kill these microorganisms before and after confinement.

Pasteur further demonstrated between 1860 and 1864 that [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] and the growth of microorganisms in [[nutrient broth]]s did not proceed by spontaneous generation. He exposed freshly boiled broth to air in vessels that contained a filter to stop all particles passing through to the growth medium, and even with no filter at all, with air being admitted via a long tortuous tube that would not pass dust particles. Nothing grew in the broths: therefore the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, as spores on dust, rather than being generated within the broth.

Pasteur discovered that another serious disease of silkworms, ''[[pébrine]]'', was caused by a small microscopic organism now known as ''[[Nosema bombycis]]'' (1870). Pasteur saved France's silk industry by developing a method to screen silkworms eggs for those that were not infected, a method that is still used today to control this and other silkworm diseases.

=== Robert Koch ===
Robert Koch is known for developing four basic criteria (known as [[Koch's postulates]]) for demonstrating, in a scientifically sound manner, that a disease is caused by a particular organism. These postulates grew out of his seminal work with [[anthrax]] using purified cultures of the pathogen that had been isolated from diseased animals.

Koch's postulates were developed in the 19th century as general guidelines to identify pathogens that could be isolated with the techniques of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walker L, Levine H, Jucker M | title = Koch's postulates and infectious proteins | journal = Acta Neuropathologica | volume = 112 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16703338 | doi = 10.1007/s00401-006-0072-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in Koch's time, it was recognized that some infectious agents were clearly responsible for disease even though they did not fulfill all of the postulates.&lt;ref name=Koch1884 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koch 1893"/&gt; Attempts to rigidly apply Koch's postulates to the diagnosis of viral diseases in the late 19th century, at a time when viruses could not be seen or isolated in culture, may have impeded the early development of the field of [[virology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Robert Koch: a life in medicine and bacteriology |author=[[Thomas D. Brock|Brock TD]] |year=1999 |publisher=American Society of Microbiology Press |location=Washington DC |isbn=1-55581-143-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Evans AS |title=Causation and disease: the Henle-Koch postulates revisited |journal=Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=175–95 |date=May 1976 |pmid=782050 |pmc=2595276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, a number of infectious agents are accepted as the cause of disease despite their not fulfilling all of Koch's postulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacomo V, Kelly P, Raoult D |title=Natural history of ''Bartonella'' infections (an exception to Koch's postulate) |journal=Clinical and Diagnostic Laboratory Immunology |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=8–18 |year=2002 |pmid=11777823 |doi=10.1128/CDLI.9.1.8-18.2002 |pmc=119901}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, while Koch's postulates retain historical importance and continue to inform the approach to microbiologic diagnosis, fulfillment of all four postulates is not required to demonstrate causality.

Koch's postulates have also influenced scientists who examine microbial pathogenesis from a molecular point of view. In the 1980s, a [[molecular Koch's postulates|molecular version]] of Koch's postulates was developed to guide the identification of microbial genes encoding [[virulence]] factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Falkow S |title=Molecular Koch's postulates applied to microbial pathogenicity |journal=Reviews of Infectious Diseases |volume=10 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=S274–6 |year=1988 |pmid=3055197 |doi=10.1093/cid/10.Supplement_2.S274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Koch's postulates:'''
# The microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease, but should not be found in healthy organisms.
# The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure [[cell culture|culture]].
# The cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy organism.
# The microorganism must be reisolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.

However, Koch abandoned the universalist requirement of the first postulate altogether when he discovered asymptomatic carriers of cholera&lt;ref name="Koch 1893"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Koch Robert |title=Über den augenblicklichen Stand der bakteriologischen Choleradiagnose |language=German |journal=Zeitschrift für Hygiene und Infektionskrankheiten |year=1893 |volume=14 |pages=319–333 |doi=10.1007/BF02284324}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, later, of [[typhoid fever]]. [[Asymptomatic]] or [[subclinical infection]] carriers are now known to be a common feature of many infectious diseases, especially viruses such as [[polio]], [[herpes simplex]], [[HIV]], and [[hepatitis C]]. As a specific example, all doctors and virologists agree that [[poliovirus]] causes paralysis in just a few infected subjects, and the success of the [[polio vaccine]] in preventing disease supports the conviction that the poliovirus is the causative agent.

The third postulate specifies "should", not "must", because as Koch himself proved in regard to both [[tuberculosis]] and cholera,&lt;ref name=Koch1884&gt;{{cite book |author=Koch Robert |year=1884 |title=Mittheilungen aus dem Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamte |chapter=Die Aetiologie der Tuberkulose |volume=2 |pages=1–88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- see also: Conferenz zur Erörterung der Cholerafrage im Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamt [Conference to discuss the matter of cholera at the Imperial Health Office]. ''Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift'' 10 (1884), pages 499-507, 519-532 --&gt; not all organisms exposed to an infectious agent will acquire the infection. Noninfection may be due to such factors as general health and proper immune functioning; acquired immunity from previous exposure or vaccination; or genetic immunity, as with the resistance to malaria conferred by possessing at least one sickle cell allele.

The second postulate may also be suspended for certain microorganisms or entities that cannot (at the present time) be grown in pure culture, such as prions responsible for [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Inglis TJ |title=Principia aetiologica: taking causality beyond Koch's postulates |journal=Journal of Medical Microbiology |volume=56 |issue=Pt 11 |pages=1419–22 |date=November 2007 |pmid=17965339 |doi=10.1099/jmm.0.47179-0 |url=http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/56/11/1419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In summary, a body of evidence that satisfies Koch's postulates is sufficient but not necessary to establish causation.

== Sanitation ==
In the 1870s, [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] was instrumental in developing practical applications of the germ theory of disease with respect to sanitation in medical settings and aseptic surgical techniques—partly through the use of carbolic acid ([[phenol]]) as an antiseptic.

In 2008, 4.7 million people in [[Asia]] were living with [[HIV]] according to the [[United Nations]] (UN).&lt;ref name="unaids.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/CountryResponses/Regions/default.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702230305/http://www.unaids.org/en/CountryResponses/Regions/default.asp |archivedate=2010-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN believes that Asia's epidemic peaked in the mid-1990s, and annual HIV incidence has subsequently declined by more than half.&lt;ref name="unaids.org"/&gt; Regionally, the epidemic has remained somewhat stable since 2000.&lt;ref name="unaids.org"/&gt;

==East Asia==

[[Image:People living with HIV AIDS world map.PNG|thumb|400px|People living with HIV/AIDS ([[World Factbook|CIA]]), in absolute numbers. Large numbers of people live with HIV even in countries with relatively low HIV prevalence levels.]]
Compared with other regions, notably Africa and the Americas, the national HIV prevalence levels in [[East Asia]] are very low (0.1% in the adult (15-49) group). However, due to the large populations of many East Asian nations, this low national HIV prevalence still means that large numbers of people are living with HIV.

===China===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in the People's Republic of China}}
[[File:ChinaHIVAIDSmap.svg|thumb||Cases of HIV in Chinese provinces by December 2005; high number of cases near Eastern and Western borders.]]
The picture in this region is dominated by the [[People's Republic of China]]. Much of the current spread of HIV in China is through intravenous [[drug abuse]] and [[paid sex]]. The number was estimated at between 430,000 and 1.5 million by independent researchers, with some estimates going much higher. In the rural areas, especially in [[Henan]] province, large numbers of farmers participated in contaminated [[blood transfusion]]s; estimates of those infected are in the tens of thousands.

===Japan===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Japan}}

Independent research has suggested that actual infection rates may be much higher, especially amongst the young.

===South Korea===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in South Korea}}
South Korea cumulative ''reported'' cases of HIV surpassed 6,000, and 797 reported in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?DR_ID=56908 KaiserNetwork: Korea cases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623135428/http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?DR_ID=56908 |date=2009-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'', the prevalence of '''[[HIV]] in South Korea''' is rising. The first case of HIV was in 1985 &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4482066|title=Spectrum of Opportunistic Infections and Malignancies in Patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection in South Korea|last=Oh|first=Myoung-don|date=December 1999}}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the number of people diagnosed with HIV was 219, and has risen to 797 diagnoses in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-10-411|title=Increasing Late Diagnosis in Hiv Infection in South Korea: 2000-2007|last=Lee|first=Jin-Hee|date=December 2009|website=BIO MED CENTRAL|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of diagnoses were confirmed after routine check-ups, and males were found to have a much higher infection rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-10-411|title=Increasing Late Diagnosis in Hiv Infection in South Korea: 2000-2007|last=Lee|first=Jin-Hee|date=December 2009|website=BIO MED CENTRAL|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevent Korean women from contracting HIV, HIV positive males should be detected early on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=40542225|title=Epidemiological Characteristics of HIV-Infected Women in the Republic of Korea: A Low HIV Prevalence Country|last=Lee|first=Jin-Hee|date=September 2009}}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common transmission mode in South Korea is through heterosexual sexual contacts, because homosexuality is uncommon and socially unacceptable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Due to the lower prevalence of HIV in South Korea, the Korean media has represented HIV as a disease brought to Korea by foreigners from other countries.&lt;ref name="Cheng 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4065354|title=Interrogating the Absence of HIV/AIDS Interventions for Migrant Sex Workers in South Korea|last=Cheng|first=Sealing|date=2004}}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Korean government has created policies to incorporate these ideas. Any foreigners who plan to stay in South Korea must test for HIV, and if results show they are positive they are no longer able to stay in the country for any reason.&lt;ref name="Cheng 2004"/&gt; This may be a problem for foreigners who want to work in South Korea. The Korean government has also provided financial funding in order to reduce, and to assist those already living with the immunodeficiency virus for Korean citizens. Public Health organizations have created opportunities of assistance such as free treatment services, and anonymous testing locations.

===Taiwan===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Taiwan}}
As of March 2016, there are 31,620 reported cases of Taiwanese nationals testing positive for HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov.tw/downloadfile.aspx?fid=40CE068DC7A0F111 |title=HIV月報105-03(更新) |publisher=Centers for Disease Control, R.O.C (Taiwan) |format=PDF |access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently HIV/AIDS patients who are Taiwanese nationals can enjoy free medical care (including HAART therapies), with the state covering the cost. Non-governmental organizations have set up "AIDS Half-Way Houses" for homeless patients. The ratio of patients of drug users increases rapidly, which has led the authority to promote a harm reduction program.

==South and South-East Asia==
The HIV prevalence rate across this region is less than .35 percent. Due to the population size this brings the total of HIV infections to 4.2 - 4.7 million adults and children. More AIDS deaths (480,000) occur in this region than any other region except sub-Saharan Africa. This sprawling region is not just vast but diverse, with the nature, pace and severity of HIV epidemics differing across the region. The AIDS picture in South Asia is dominated by the epidemic in [[India]], but new data released by UNAIDS shows that India as of 2007 has a relatively low Aids prevalence rate. With an estimated 2-3.1 million infections, India has the third largest number of people with aids after South Africa and Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.unaids.org/pub/PressRelease/2007/070706_indiapressrelease_en.pdf |title=2.5 million people in India living with HIV, according to new estimates |publisher=UNAids |accessdate=2007-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930225845/http://data.unaids.org/pub/PressRelease/2007/070706_indiapressrelease_en.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South and [[Southeast Asia]], the HIV epidemic remains largely concentrated in [[injecting drug user]]s, [[men who have sex with men]], [[sex workers]], and clients of sex workers and their immediate sexual partners. New infections are occurring in Thailand, Myanmar, and Cambodia at a steady rate. Prevention strategies in these populations are, for the most part, inadequate.

===Bhutan===

According to reports by [[Bhutan]] Ministry of Health, Bhutan had 246 reported cases of HIV/AIDS through August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/ministry-health-detected/ |title=The Ministry of Health has Detected… |publisher=Bhutan Observer online |date=2011-08-01 |accessdate=2011-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028154713/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/ministry-health-detected/ |archivedate=2011-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Myanmar===

===Pakistan===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Pakistan}}
HIV is not currently a dominant epidemic in Pakistan. However, the number of cases is growing. Moderately high drug use and lack of acceptance that non-marital sex is common in the society have allowed the AIDS epidemic to take hold in Pakistan, mainly among injection drug users, some male sex workers and repatriated migrant workers. AIDS may yet become a major health issue. The National AIDS Control Programme’s latest figures show that over 4,000 HIV cases have so far been reported since 1986, but UN and government estimates put the number of HIV/AIDS cases around 97,000 (range 46,000 to 210,000).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aids.gov.br/data/documents/storedDocuments/%7BB8EF5DAF-23AE-4891-AD36-1903553A3174%7D/%7BFD4B5F2E-FB97-4749-BDA2-1C2360F59870%7D/2007_epiupdate_en.pdf UNAIDS Epidemic update 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002144331/http://www.aids.gov.br/data/documents/storedDocuments/%7BB8EF5DAF-23AE-4891-AD36-1903553A3174%7D/%7BFD4B5F2E-FB97-4749-BDA2-1C2360F59870%7D/2007_epiupdate_en.pdf |date=2008-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More realistic estimates that are based on actual surveillance figures, however, suggest that this number may be closer to 40,000 - 45,000. The overall prevalence of HIV infection in adults aged 15 to 49 is 0.1%&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130204012945/http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/S1473-3099(08)70054-9/fulltext New government in Pakistan faces old challenges]&lt;/ref&gt; (and Shah ''et al.'' under review) (0.05% if one accepts the lower estimates).

The national response to HIV started focusing on Most At Risk Groups in 2004 and so far included 9 cities where injection drug users and sex workers receive prevention and harm reduction services and 12 HIV care centers where nearly 1000 patients receive antiretroviral drugs.

===Philippines===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in the Philippines}}

The Philippines has a relatively low incidence of HIV/AIDS. There have been about 2800 reported cases since 1984, but independent estimates put the number of cases closer to 12000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youandaids.org/asia%20pacific%20at%20a%20glance/philippines/index.asp HIV and AIDS in Philippines,HIV in Philippines,AIDS in Philippines,social Indicators,social statistics, HIV Estimates,Figures,HIV situation in Philippines&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510215242/http://www.youandaids.org/Asia%20Pacific%20at%20a%20Glance/Philippines/index.asp |date=2008-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/92012/RP-HIV/AIDS-situation-alarming-undocumented-cases-at-11000---solon   GMA NEWS.TV, RP HIV/AIDS situation alarming; undocumented cases at 11,000 - solon]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority (70-75%) of carriers are male, 25-39, and the predominant mode of transmission is through sexual intercourse.

Although national incidence remains to be relatively low, an independent HIV surveillance study conducted in 2010 by Dr. [[Louie Mar Gangcuangco]] and colleagues from the [[University of the Philippines]]-[[Philippine General Hospital]] showed that out of 406 men having sex with men tested for HIV in Metro Manila, HIV prevalence was 11.8% (95% confidence interval: 8.7- 15.0).&lt;ref&gt;Gangcuangco, et al.

===Sri Lanka===

AIDS was first reported in Sri Lanka in 1986. First indigenous transmission was in 1989. As of March 2013, 1693 persons were diagnosed with the virus. Over 4200 persons are estimated to be infected with the virus. Most common mode of transmission is heterosexual followed by homosexual.

Sex workers are considered most at risk. Number of partners per sex worker is comparatively low (4 per week) compared with other countries (Bangladesh 18-36 per week). There condom use rate is relatively high (67.6). Blood transfusion service is mostly state run and is considered safe. Of the 35,000 drug users less than 1% are thought to be injecting drug users.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7947">==Prevalence==
With less than 1 [[percent]] of the adult population estimated to be [[HIV]]-positive, [[Guatemala]] is considered to have a concentrated [[epidemic]]. However, Guatemala – [[Central America]]’s largest country – accounts for nearly one-sixth of Central America’s HIV-infected population. Since the country’s first case of HIV was reported in 1984, infections have occurred primarily among [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) and [[sex workers]]. According to the [[National AIDS Program]] (NAP) in the Ministry of Health (MOH), as of April 2007, Guatemala had 10,304 officially reported cases of HIV/[[AIDS]]. [[UNAIDS]] estimates that 61,000 people are living with HIV in Guatemala and 2,700 deaths have occurred due to AIDS.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

Guatemala’s HIV-infected population lives primarily in urban areas along major transportation routes. According to Guatemala’s 2007 National Epidemiological Center report, more than 77 percent of reported HIV/AIDS cases occurred in seven departments: [[Suchitepéquez]], [[Guatemala]], [[Izabal Department|Izabal]], [[Escuintla]], [[Retalhuleu]], [[San Marcos department|San Marcos]], and [[Quetzaltenango]]. The NAP estimates that 80 percent of reported HIV cases have occurred among 15- to 49-year-olds, with 20- to 34-year-olds accounting for more than 51 percent of all cases. National HIV prevalence among sex workers is 4 percent, and among street-based female sex workers prevalence is as high as 12 percent. National HIV prevalence among [[Men who have sex with men|MSM]] is 10 percent, but in Guatemala City, 18 percent of MSM were HIV-positive in 2006, according to baseline data collected for a [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] project. A 2002 study published by UNAIDS in 2007 showed that infection levels among MSM in Guatemala is 10 times higher than in the adult general population. Other vulnerable populations include prison inmates, with a reported prevalence of 3.2 percent, and at-risk youth and street children, with HIV prevalence at 3.3 percent. According to the MOH, no cases of infection have been reported among injecting drug users or through blood or blood products. Available data indicate that HIV has affected mainly [[urban area|urban]] and [[Ladino people|Ladino]] (mixed [[Amerindian]]-[[Spanish people]]s) populations; however, preliminary data indicate that the indigenous population (primarily [[Mayans]]) potentially could be experiencing increasing HIV infections. The data are insufficient, however, to determine the extent of the epidemic within this population.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

Several risk factors contribute to Guatemala’s epidemic, including migration and tourism. While in transit, migrants may participate in high-risk sexual behavior, increasing their chances of becoming infected with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The Garifuna population, which shares cultural and ethnic characteristics with the Caribbean countries, is more at risk than the general population. The effects of HIV/AIDS are exacerbated by high levels of poverty and limited access to health care, particularly among [[rural]] populations.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

The rate of HIV co-infection with [[tuberculosis]] (TB) is growing. The current rate of new TB infections is 34 per 100,000 people and a 2006 study cited by UNAIDS found that HIV prevalence among new TB patients in Quetzaltenango tripled from 4.2 to 12 percent between 1995 and 2002. TB is the most frequent opportunistic infection associated with HIV/AIDS in Guatemala.&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/lac/guatemala_profile.pdf "Health Profile: Guatemala"]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (June 2008). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National response==
According to the 2003 AIDS Program Effort Index, a tool developed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to measure the collective effort put into an effective HIV/AIDS response by individuals and domestic and international organizations, Guatemala had a score of 52, which is an improvement from the score in 1996 but still slightly lower than the average score of 55 for [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean region]]. It ranked highest in the areas of political support and prevention programs.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

The NAP has been responsible for surveillance of the epidemic since 1984. However, sentinel surveillance was not established until 1998. Over the past several years, the [[Guatemalan government]] has taken concrete steps to address the HIV/AIDS [[epidemic]]. A national strategic plan was produced for 1999 to 2003. At the end of 2005, Guatemala adopted a new national HIV/AIDS policy, along with a new strategic plan for 2006 to 2010. The plan charges the NAP with coordinating national responses, including those from civil society. UNAIDS works with the NAP, and USAID provides technical assistance to implement the national strategic plan and establish key universal access targets. Decentralization of AIDS care and prevention services throughout the country is an important priority.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

In recent years, the NAP has improved communication with civil society and other institutions to coordinate national efforts. This has resulted in the establishment of NAP-led technical committees with multisectoral participation to address such issues as standardizing diagnosis, treatment, and care. Moreover, the Country Coordination Mechanism serves as an inter-institutional coordinating body, aimed at better implementing Global Fund projects. Guatemala is also implementing the Regional HIV/STI Plan for the Health Sector 2006–2015 of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The Plan is designed to assist health services and systems in the Americas to more effectively respond to the HIV epidemic and prevent STIs.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

[[Antiretroviral treatment]] (ART) coverage has expanded over the years, and currently, 76 percent of identified HIV-infected men and women who need treatment receive ART, according to the NAP. The recent [[WHO]]/[[UNAIDS]]/[[UNICEF]] report [[Towards Universal Access]] estimates that 52 percent of HIV-infected people who need treatment receive ART. However, because the expansion and decentralization of services has been slow, people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) must travel long distances to obtain treatment, imposing cost burdens on them. There are major challenges in extending both prevention and care coverage outside the capital and other main cities. Furthermore, discrimination against PLWHA and vulnerable groups such as commercial sex workers and MSM remains a significant barrier to a more effective AIDS response in Guatemala. USAID has supported a national campaign focusing on the diversity of PLWHA to help break down barriers of stigma and discrimination (S&amp;D) and promote respect for [[human rights]] related to HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

Guatemala receives significant support from the Global Fund to expand prevention, care, and treatment activities among vulnerable groups and in priority geographic areas of the country. The objectives of the Global Fund are to expand prevention activities and ART services from the capital city to regions with the highest HIV incidence; to improve coordination among civil society organizations working in HIV/AIDS; and to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV by expanding voluntary screening and counseling for pregnant women. Bilateral donors, including USAID and [[Europe]]an countries, also provide support for prevention, treatment, care, and health system improvement initiatives.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

'''Herefossfjorden''' is a [[lake]] in the municipality of [[Birkenes]] in [[Aust-Agder]] county, [[Norway]].  The {{convert|3.7|km2|adj=on}} lake is about {{convert|9|km}} long and it is part of the [[Tovdalselva]] river.  The [[Gauslåfjorden]] and [[Uldalsåna]] lakes flow into Herefossfjorden near the village of [[Herefoss]] at the northern end of the lake.  The Uldalsåna lake is held back by a [[dam]] and the Gauslåfjorden flows over a [[waterfall]] (called the ''Herefossen'') into the Herefossfjorden.&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://snl.no/Herefossfjorden|title=Herefossfjorden|editor-first=Geir|editor-last=Thorsnæs|accessdate=2017-06-09|date=2009-03-17|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=[[Kunnskapsforlaget]]|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Norwegian National Road 41]] runs along the eastern shore.  The village of [[Herefoss]] lies on the northern edge of the lake and the village of [[Søre Herefoss]] lies at the southern end of the fjord.  The old municipality of [[Herefoss (municipality)|Herefoss]] existed from 1838 until 1967 and it included all the land surrounding the lake.

The word "nurse" originally came from the Latin word "nutrire", meaning to suckle, referring to a [[wet-nurse]]; only in the late 16th century did it attain its modern meaning of a person who cares for the infirm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.uottawa.ca/sim/data/Physician_e.htm http://www.med.uottawa.ca/sim/data/Physician_e.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the earliest times most cultures produced a stream of nurses dedicated to service on religious principles. Both Christendom and the Muslim World generated a stream of dedicated nurses from their earliest days. In Europe before the foundation of modern nursing, Catholic [[nun]]s and the military often provided nursing-like services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/history/crimea/florrie.html Florence Nightingale (1820–1910)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It took until the 19th century for nursing to become a secular profession.

==Ancient history ==
The early history of nurses suffers from a lack of source material, but nursing in general has long been an extension of the [[wet-nurse]] function of women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/historyofnursing011935nutt/historyofnursing011935nutt_djvu.txt ''A history of nursing; the evolution of nursing systems from the earliest times to the foundation of the first English and American training schools for nurses'', by Adelaide Nutting and Lavinia L. Dock, G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1907]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/A_History_of_Nursing_from_Ancient_to_Mod.html?id=v0k0AAAAIAAJ ''A History of Nursing, from Ancient to Modern Times: A World View'' by Isabel Maitland Stewart, Anne L. Austin, 1962]&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist Indian ruler (268 B.C.E. to 232 B.C.E.) [[Ashoka]] erected a series of [[Pillars of Ashoka|pillars]], which included an edict ordering hospitals to be built along the routes of travelers, and that they be
"well provided with instruments and medicine, consisting of mineral and vegetable drugs, with roots and fruits"; "Whenever there is no provision of drugs, medical roots, and herbs, they are to be supplied, and skilful physicians appointed at the expense of the state to administer them." The system of public hospitals continued until the fall of Buddhism in India ca. 750 C.E.

About 100 B.C.E. the ''[[Charaka Samhita]]'' was written in India, stating that good medical practice requires a patient, physician, nurse, and medicines, with the nurse required to be knowledgeable, skilled at preparing formulations and dosage, sympathetic towards everyone, and clean.

The first known Christian nurse, [[Phoebe (Bible)|Phoebe]], is mentioned in Romans 16:1. During the early years of the [[Christian Church]] (ca. 50 C.E.), [[St. Paul]] sent a deaconess named Phoebe to Rome as the first visiting nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeWit|first=Susan|title=Fundamental Concepts And Skills for Nursing|year=2009|publisher=Saunders Elsevier|location=Missouri|isbn=9781416052289|page=964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its earliest days, following the edicts of [[Jesus]], [[Christianity]] encouraged its devotees to tend the sick. Priests were often also physicians. According to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], while pagan religions seldom offered help to the infirm, the early Christians were willing to nurse the sick and take food to them, notably during the smallpox epidemic of AD 165-180 and the measles outbreak of around AD 250; "In nursing the sick and dying, regardless of religion, the Christians won friends and sympathisers".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 AD, Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, leading to an expansion of the provision of care. Among the earliest were those built ca. 370 by [[Basil of Caesarea|St. Basil the Great]], bishop of [[Caesarea Mazaca]] in [[Cappadocia]] in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey), by [[Saint Fabiola]] in Rome ca. 390, and by the physician-priest [[Sampson the Hospitable|Saint Sampson]] (d. 530) in [[Constantinople]], Called the Basiliad, St. Basil's hospital resembled a city, and included housing for doctors and nurses and separate buildings for various classes of patients.&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Encyclopedia'' - ''[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07480a.htm]'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; There was a separate section for lepers.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick E. McGrew, ''Encyclopedia of Medical History'' (1985), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually construction of a hospital in every [[cathedral]] town was begun.

Christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals after the end of the persecution of the early church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07480a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Hospitals]. Newadvent.org (1910-06-01). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient church leaders like St. [[Benedict of Nursia]] (480-547) emphasized medicine as an aid to the provision of hospitality.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10122a.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: History of Medicine]. Newadvent.org (1911-10-01). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; 12th century Roman Catholic orders like the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and [[Carmelite]]s have long lived in religious communities that work for the care of the sick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.op.org/en/index.php/eng/about-us/sisters ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326202047/http://curia.op.org/en/index.php/eng/about-us/sisters |date=March 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some hospitals maintained libraries and training programs, and doctors compiled their medical and pharmacological studies in manuscripts. Thus in-patient medical care in the sense of what we today consider a hospital, was an invention driven by Christian mercy and Byzantine innovation.&lt;ref&gt;James Edward McClellan and Harold Dorn, ''Science and Technology in World History: An Introduction'' (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006), p.99,101.&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantine hospital staff included the [[Chief Physician]] (archiatroi), professional nurses (hypourgoi) and orderlies (hyperetai). By the twelfth century, Constantinople had two well-organized hospitals, staffed by doctors who were both male and female. Facilities included systematic treatment procedures and specialized wards for various diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Byzantine medicine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 7th century, Rufaidah bint Sa’ad (also known as Rufaida Al-Aslamia) became what is now described as the first [[Nursing in Islam|Muslim nurse]]. A contemporary of Muhammad, she hailed from the Bani Aslam tribe in Medina and learned her medical skills from her father, a traditional healer. After she had lead a group of women to treat injured fighters on the battlefield, Muhammad gave her permission to set up a tent near the Medina mosque to provide treatment and care for the ill and the needy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.nurserecruiter.com/many-centuries-before-florence-nightingale-this-muslim-woman-introduced-nursing-to-the-arabic-world/ "Many centuries before Florence Nightingale, this Muslim woman introduced nursing to the Arabic world"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval Europe==
Medieval hospitals in Europe followed a similar pattern to the [[Byzantine medicine|Byzantine]]. They were religious communities, with care provided by [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s. (An old French term for hospital is ''hôtel-Dieu'', "hostel of God.") Some were attached to monasteries; others were independent and had their own endowments, usually of property, which provided income for their support. Some hospitals were multi-functional while others were founded for specific purposes such as leper hospitals, or as refuges for the poor, or for [[pilgrim]]s: not all cared for the sick. The first Spanish hospital, founded by the Catholic [[Visigoth]] bishop [[Masona]] in 580AD at [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]], was a ''[[xenodochium]]'' designed as an inn for travellers (mostly pilgrims to the shrine of [[Eulalia of Mérida]]) as well as a hospital for citizens and local farmers. The hospital's endowment consisted of farms to feed its patients and guests. From the account given by Paul the Deacon we learn that this hospital was supplied with physicians and nurses, whose mission included the care the sick wherever they were found, "slave or free, Christian or Jew." &lt;ref&gt;See Florez, "Espana Sagrada", XIII, 539; Heusinger, "Ein Beitrag", etc. in "Janus", 1846, I.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 700s and early 800s, Emperor Charlemagne decreed that those hospitals which had been well conducted before his time and had fallen into decay should be restored in accordance with the needs of the time.&lt;ref name="duplex803_iii"&gt;Capitulary Duplex, 803, chapter iii&lt;/ref&gt; He further ordered that a hospital should be attached to each cathedral and monastery.&lt;ref name="duplex803_iii"/&gt;

During the tenth century the monasteries became a dominant factor in hospital work. The famous Benedictine Abbey of Cluny, founded in 910, set the example which was widely imitated throughout France and Germany. Besides its infirmary for the religious, each monastery had a hospital in which externs were cared for. These were in charge of the ''eleemosynarius'', whose duties, carefully prescribed by the rule, included every sort of service that the visitor or patient could require.

As the eleemosynarius was obliged to seek out the sick and needy in the neighborhood, each monastery became a center for the relief of suffering. Among the monasteries notable in this respect were those of the Benedictines at Corbie in Picardy, Hirschau, Braunweiler, Deutz, Ilsenburg, Liesborn, Pram, and Fulda; those of the Cistercians at Arnsberg, Baumgarten, Eberbach, Himmenrode, Herrnalb, Volkenrode, and Walkenried.

No less efficient was the work done by the diocesan clergy in accordance with the disciplinary enactments of the councils of Aachen (817, 836), which prescribed that a hospital should be maintained in connection with each collegiate church. The canons were obliged to contribute towards the support of the hospital, and one of their number had charge of the inmates. As these hospitals were located in cities, more numerous demands were made upon them than upon those attached to the monasteries. In this movement the bishop naturally took the lead, hence the hospitals founded by Heribert (died 1021) in Cologne, Godard (died 1038) in Hildesheim, Conrad (died 975) in Constance, and Ulrich (died 973) in Augsburg. But similar provision was made by the other churches; thus at Trier the hospitals of St. Maximin, St. Matthew, St. Simeon, and St. James took their names from the churches to which they were attached. During the period 1207–1577 no less than 155 hospitals were founded in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Virchow in "Gesch. Abhandl.", II&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ospedale Maggiore]], traditionally named Ca' Granda (i.e. Big House), in [[Milan]], northern Italy, was constructed to house one of the first community hospitals, the largest such undertaking of the fifteenth century. Commissioned by Francesco Sforza in 1456 and designed by Antonio Filarete it is among the first examples of Renaissance architecture in Lombardy.

The Normans brought their hospital system along when they conquered England in 1066. By merging with traditional land-tenure and customs, the new charitable houses became popular and were distinct from both English monasteries and French hospitals. They dispensed alms and some medicine, and were generously endowed by the nobility and gentry who counted on them for spiritual rewards after death.&lt;ref&gt;Sethina Watson, "The Origins of the English Hospital," ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Sixth Series'' (2006) 16:75-94 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25593861 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Geoffrey Blainey, the Catholic Church in Europe provided many of the services of a welfare state: "It conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young; hospices for the sick of all ages; places for the lepers; and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal". It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; ''A Short History of Christianity'' (Penguin Viking; 2011); pp 214-215.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roles for women===
Catholic women played large roles in health and healing in medieval and early modern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Mary E. Fissell, "Introduction: Women, Health, and Healing in Early Modern Europe," ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' (2008) 82#1 pp&amp;nbsp;1–17&lt;/ref&gt; A life as a nun was a prestigious role; wealthy families provided dowries for their daughters, and these funded the convents, while the nuns provided free nursing care for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Monica Green, "Women's Medical Practice and Health Care in Medieval Europe," in ''Sisters and Workers in the Middle Ages,'' ed. J. M. Bennett et al. (University of Chicago Press, 1989), pp. 39–78&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in Catholic lands such as France, rich families continued to fund convents and monasteries, and enrolled their daughters as nuns who provided free health services to the poor. Nursing was a religious role for the nurse, and there was little call for science.&lt;ref name="McHugh"&gt;Tim McHugh, "Expanding Women's Rural Medical Work in Early Modern Brittany: The Daughters of the Holy Spirit," ''Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences'' (2012) 67#3 pp&amp;nbsp;428–456. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_history_of_medicine_and_allied_sciences/v067/67.3.mchugh.html#f10 in project MJUSE]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] had established many hospitals in the [[middle east]], but following the rise of [[Islam]] from the 7th century, [[Arabic medicine]] developed in this region, where a number of important advances were made and an [[Nursing in Islam|Islamic tradition of nursing]] begun. Arab ideas were later influential in Europe. The famous [[Knights Hospitaller]] arose as a group of individuals associated with an Amalfitan hospital in Jerusalem, which was built to provide care for poor, sick or injured Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land. Following the capture of the city by Crusaders, the order became a military as well as infirmarian order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07477a.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Knights of Malta]. Newadvent.org (1910-06-01). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholic orders such as the [[Franciscan]]s stressed tending the sick, especially during the devastating plagues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13100c.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Roch]. Newadvent.org (1912-02-01). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic Europe===
{{see also|Catholic Church and health care}}
The Catholic elites provided hospital services because of their theology of salvation that good works were the route to heaven. The same theology holds strong into the 21st century. In Catholic areas, the tradition of nursing sisters continued uninterrupted. Several orders of nuns provided nursing services in hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Jones, ''The Charitable Imperative. Hospitals and Nursing in Ancien Regimé and Revolutionary France'' (Routledge, 1989), pp 89–205.&lt;/ref&gt; A leadership role was taken by the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul]], founded in France in 1633.&lt;ref&gt;Susan E. Dinan, ''Women and Poor Relief in Seventeenth-Century France. The Early History of the Daughters of Charity'' (Ashgate, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; New orders of Catholic nuns expanded the range of activities and reached new areas. For example, in rural [[Brittany]] in France, the [[Daughters of the Holy Spirit]], created in 1706, played a central role. New opportunity for nuns as charitable practitioners were created by devout nobles on their own estates. The nuns provided comprehensive care for the sick poor on their patrons' estates, acting not only as nurses, but took on expanded roles as physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries. The French Catholics in [[New France]] (Canada) and New Orleans continued these traditions. During the French Revolution, most of the orders of nurses were shut down and there was no organized nursing care to replace them.&lt;ref name="McHugh"/&gt; However the demand for their nursing services remained strong, and after 1800 the sisters reappeared and resumed their work in hospitals and on rural estates. They were tolerated by officials because they had widespread support and were the link between elite physicians and distrustful peasants who needed help.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Léonard, "Femmes, Religion et Médecine: Les Religieuses qui Soignent, en France au XIXe Siècle," ''Annales: Economies, Societes, Civilisations'' (1977) 32#5 pp 887-907&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism closes the hospitals===
The Protestant reformers, led by [[Martin Luther]], rejected the notion that rich men could gain God's grace through good works—and thereby escape purgatory—by providing cash endowments to charitable institutions. They also rejected the Catholic idea that the poor patients earned grace and salvation through their suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C. Scott Dixon|title=Living With Religious Diversity in Early-Modern Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l9fVJYNd61oC&amp;pg=PA129|year= 2009|publisher=Ashgate |pages=128–30|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protestants generally closed all the convents&lt;ref name="Leonard_237_254"&gt;Amy E. Leonard, "Female Religious Orders," in R. Po-chia Hsia, ed., ''A Companion to the Reformation World'' (2004) pp&amp;nbsp;237–254&lt;/ref&gt; and most of the hospitals, sending women home to become housewives, often against their will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Cunningham|author2=Ole Peter Grell|title=Health Care and Poor Relief in Protestant Europe 1500–1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dd-44kXLh1QC&amp;pg=PA130|year= 2002|publisher=Routledge|pages=130–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, local officials recognized the public value of hospitals, and some were continued in Protestant lands, but without monks or nuns and in the control of local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Virpi Mäkinen|title=Lutheran Reformation And the Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Dkk1CDZ1UsC&amp;pg=PA227|year=2006|publisher=BRILL|pages=227–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In London, the crown allowed two hospitals to continue their charitable work, under nonreligious control of city officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Keir Waddington|title=Medical Education at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, 1123–1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mi5cV5D0SkAC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2003|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convents were all shut down but Harkness finds that women—some of them former nuns—were part of a new system that delivered essential medical services to people outside their family. They were employed by parishes and hospitals, as well as by private families, and provided nursing care as well as some medical, pharmaceutical, and surgical services.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah E. Harkness, "A View from the Streets: Women and Medical Work in Elizabethan London," ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' (2008) 82#1 pp&amp;nbsp;52–85&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, Protestant reformers shut down the monasteries and convents, though they allowed a few to continue in operation. Those nuns who had been serving as nurses were given pensions or told to get married and stay home.&lt;ref name="Leonard_237_254"/&gt; Between 1600 and 1800, Protestant Europe had a few noticeable hospitals, but no regular system of nursing. The weakened public role of women left female practitioners restricted to assisting neighbors and family in an unpaid and unrecognized capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Merry E. Wiesner-Hanks, ''Women and Gender in Early Modern Europe'' (Cambridge U.P., 1993), pp 84, 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern==
Modern nursing began in the 19th century in Germany and Britain, and spread worldwide by 1900.

===Deaconess===
{{main|Deaconess}}
Phoebe, the nurse mentioned in the New Testament, was a deaconess. The role had virtually died out centuries before, but was revived in Germany in 1836 when [[Theodor Fliedner]] and his wife Friederike Münster opened the first deaconess motherhouse in [[Kaiserswerth]] on the Rhine. The diaconate was soon brought to England and Scandinavia, Kaiserswerth model. The women obligated themselves for 5 years of service, receiving room, board, uniforms, pocket money, and lifelong care. The uniform was the usual dress of the married woman. There were variations, such as an emphasis on preparing women for marriage through training in nursing, child care, social work and housework. In the Anglican Church, the diaconate was an auxiliary to the pastorate, and there were no mother houses. By 1890 there were over 5,000 deaconesses in Protestant Europe, chiefly Germany Scandinavia and England. In World War II, diaconates in war zones sustained heavy damage. As eastern Europe fell to communism, most diaconates were shut down, and 7000 deaconesses became refugees in West Germany. By 1957, in Germany there were 46,000 deaconesses and 10,000 associates. Other countries reported a total of 14,000 deaconesses, most of them Lutherans. In the United States and Canada 1550 women were counted, half of them in the Methodist Church.&lt;ref&gt;Sister Mildred Winter, "Deaconess," in Julius Bodensieck, ed. ''The Encyclopedia of the Lutheran Church'' (Minneapolis: 1965) 659-64&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Passavant]] in 1849 brought the first four deaconesses to [[Pittsburgh]], after visiting Kaiserswerth. They worked at the Pittsburgh Infirmary (now Passavant Hospital).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gerberding|first1=GH|title=Life and Letters of W. A. Passavant, D. D.|date=1909|publisher=Young Lutheran Co.|location=Greenville, PA|pages=176, 180|url=https://archive.org/details/lifelettersofwap00gerb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1880 and 1915, 62 training schools were opened in the United States. The lack of training had weakened Passavant's programs. However recruiting became increasingly difficult after 1910 as women preferred graduate nursing schools or the social work curriculum offered by state universities.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia A. Jurisson, "The Deaconess Movement," in Rosemary Skinner Keller et al., eds.

=== Nightingale's Britain===
{{main|History of Nursing in the United Kingdom}}
The [[Crimean War]] was a significant development in nursing history when English nurse [[Florence Nightingale]] laid the foundations of professional nursing with the principles summarised in the book ''[[Notes on Nursing]]''. A fund was set up in 1855 by members of the public to raise money for [[Florence Nightingale]] and her nurses' work&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/nursing/About-the-Faculty/history.aspx History of Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing &amp; Midwifery]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1856, [[Pound sterling|£]]44,039 (equivalent to roughly over £2 million today) was pooled and with this Nightingale decided to use the money to lay the foundations for a training school at [[St Thomas' Hospital]]. In 1860, the training for the first batch of nurses began; upon graduation from the school, these nurses used to be called 'Nightingales'.&lt;ref name="The School for Nurses"&gt;[http://www.countryjoe.com/nightingale/school.htm The School for Nurses]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nightingale's revelation of the abysmal nursing care afforded soldiers in the Crimean War energized reformers. Queen Victoria in 1860 ordered a hospital to be built to train Army nurses and surgeons, the [[Netley Hospital|Royal Victoria Hospital]]. The hospital opened in 1863 in [[Netley]] and admitted and cared for military patients. Beginning in 1866, nurses were formally appointed to Military General Hospitals. The [[Army Nursing Service]] (ANS) oversaw the work of the nurses starting in 1881. These military nurses were sent overseas beginning with the [[First Boer War]] (often called Zulu War) from 1879 to 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/army-medical-services/qaranc/9910.aspx|publisher=British Army Website|accessdate=31 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028190846/http://www.army.mod.uk/army-medical-services/qaranc/9910.aspx|archivedate=28 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also dispatched to serve during the [[Egyptian Campaign]] in 1882 and the Sudan War of 1883 to 1884. During the Sudan War members of the Army Nursing Service nursed in hospital ships on the Nile as well as the Citadel in Cairo. Almost 2000 nurses served during the second [[Boer War]], the Anglo-Boer War of 1899 to 1902, alongside nurses who were part of the colonial armies of Australia, Canada and New Zealand. They served in tented field hospitals. 23 Army Nursing sisters from Britain lost their lives from disease outbreaks.&lt;ref name="qaranc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=QAIMNS World War I Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service QAIMNS Nurses|url=http://www.qaranc.co.uk/qaimns.php|publisher=qaranc.co.uk|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
New Zealand was the first country to regulate nurses nationally, with adoption of the [[Nurses Registration Act 1901|Nurses Registration Act]] on the 12 September 1901. It was here in New Zealand that [[Ellen Dougherty]] became the first [[registered nurse]].&lt;ref&gt;Crisp, J., &amp; Taylor, C.

Canadian nursing dates all the way back to 1639 in [[Quebec]] with the Augustine nuns. These nuns were trying to open up a mission that cared for the spiritual and physical needs of patients. The establishment of this mission created the first nursing apprenticeship training in North America.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.cna-nurses.ca/CNA/nursing/certification/specialties/default_e.aspx Link text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229233442/http://www.cna-nurses.ca/cna/nursing/certification/specialties/default_e.aspx |date=2011-12-29 }}, additional text.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century there were some Catholic orders of nursing that were trying to spread their message across Canada. These women had only an occasional consultations with a physician. Towards the end of the nineteenth century hospital care and medical services had been improved and expanded. Much of this was due to the Nightingale model, which prevailed in English Canada. In 1874 the first formal nursing training program was started at the General and Marine Hospital in St. Catharines in [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name="test" /&gt; Many programs popped up in hospitals across Canada after this one was established. Graduates and teachers from these programs began to fight for licensing legislation, nursing journals, university training for nurses, and for professional organizations for nurses.

The first instance of Canadian nurses and the military was in 1885 with the [[Northwest Rebellion]]. Some nurses came out to aid the wounded. In 1901 Canadian nurses were officially part of the [[Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps]].&lt;ref name="test" /&gt; [[Georgina Fane Pope]] and [[Margaret C. MacDonald]] were the first nurses officially recognized as military nurses.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

Canadian [[missionary nurses]] were also of great importance in Henan, China as a part of the North China Mission starting in 1888.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries women made inroads into various professions including teaching, journalism, social work, and public health. These advances included the establishment of a Women's Medical College in Toronto (and in Kingston, Ontario) in 1883, attributed in part to the persistence of [[Emily Stowe]], the first female doctor to practice in Canada. Stowe's daughter, [[Augusta Stowe-Gullen]], became the first woman to graduate from a Canadian medical school.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Prentice, ''Canadian Women: A History'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from a token few, women were outsiders to the male-dominated medical profession. As physicians became better organized, they successfully had laws passed to control the practice of medicine and pharmacy and banning marginal and traditional practitioners. Midwifery—practiced along traditional lines by women—was restricted and practically died out by 1900.&lt;ref&gt;C. Lesley Biggs, "The Case of the Missing Midwives: A History of Midwifery in Ontario from 1795–1900," ''Ontario History,'' (1983) 75#1 pp 21-35&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the great majority of childbirths took pace at home until the 1920s, when hospitals became preferred, especially by women who were better educated, more modern, and more trusting in modern medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Oppenheimer, "Childbirth in Ontario: The Transition from Home to Hospital in the Early Twentieth Century," ''Ontario History,'' (1983) 75#1 pp 36-60&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prairie provinces====
In the Prairie provinces, the first homesteaders relied on themselves for medical services. Poverty and geographic isolation empowered women to learn and practice medical care with the herbs, roots, and berries that worked for their mothers. They prayed for divine intervention but also practiced supernatural magic that provided as much psychological as physical relief. The reliance on homeopathic remedies continued as trained nurses and doctors and how-to manuals slowly reached the homesteaders in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Woywitka, "Pioneers In Sickness and in Health." ''Alberta History'' 2001 49(1): 16-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1900 medicine and especially nursing modernized and became well organized.

The Lethbridge Nursing Mission in Alberta was a representative Canadian voluntary mission. It was founded, independent of the Victorian Order of Nurses, in 1909 by Jessie Turnbull Robinson. A former nurse, Robinson was elected as president of the Lethbridge Relief Society and began district nursing services aimed at poor women and children. The mission was governed by a volunteer board of women directors and began by raising money for its first year of service through charitable donations and payments from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. The mission also blended social work with nursing, becoming the dispenser of unemployment relief.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Richardson, "Women's Enterprise: Establishing The Lethbridge Nursing Mission, 1909-1919." ''Nursing History Review'' 1997 5: 105-130. 1062-8061&lt;/ref&gt;

Richardson (1998) examines the social, political, economic, class, and professional factors that contributed to ideological and practical differences between leaders of the Alberta Association of Graduate Nurses (AAGN), established in 1916, and the United Farm Women of Alberta (UFWA), founded in 1915, regarding the promotion and acceptance of midwifery as a recognized subspecialty of registered nurses. Accusing the AAGN of ignoring the medical needs of rural Alberta women, the leaders of the UFWA worked to improve economic and living conditions of women farmers. Irene Parlby, the UFWA's first president, lobbied for the establishment of a provincial Department of Public Health, government-provided hospitals and doctors, and passage of a law to permit nurses to qualify as registered midwives. The AAGN leadership opposed midwife certification, arguing that nursing curricula left no room for midwife study, and thus nurses were not qualified to participate in home births. In 1919 the AAGN compromised with the UFWA, and they worked together for the passage of the Public Health Nurses Act that allowed nurses to serve as midwives in regions without doctors. Thus, Alberta's District Nursing Service, created in 1919 to coordinate the province's women's health resources, resulted chiefly from the organized, persistent political activism of UFWA members and only minimally from the actions of professional nursing groups clearly uninterested in rural Canadians' medical needs.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Richardson, "Political Women, Professional Nurses, and the Creation of Alberta's District Nursing Service, 1919-1925." ''Nursing History Review'' 1998 6: 25-50. 1062-8061&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alberta District Nursing Service administered health care in the predominantly rural and impoverished areas of Alberta in the first half of the 20th century. Founded in 1919 to meet maternal and emergency medical needs by the United Farm Women (UFWA), the Nursing Service treated prairie settlers living in primitive areas lacking doctors and hospitals. Nurses provided prenatal care, worked as midwives, performed minor surgery, conducted medical inspections of schoolchildren, and sponsored immunization programs. The post-Second World War discovery of large oil and gas reserves resulted in economic prosperity and the expansion of local medical services. The passage of provincial health and universal hospital insurance in 1957 precipitated the eventual phasing out of the obsolete District Nursing Service in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Richardson, "Frontier Health Care: Alberta's District and Municipal Nursing Services, 1919 to 1976." ''Alberta History'' 1998 46(1): 2-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recent trends====
After World War II, the health care system expanded and was nationalized with medicare. Currently there are 260,000 nurses in Canada but they face the same difficulties as most countries, as technology advances and the aging population requires more nursing care.

===Mexico===
[[File:Elena Arizmendi Neutral White Cross.PNG|thumb|[[Elena Arizmendi Mejia]] and volunteers of the Mexican [[Neutral White Cross]], 1911]]
During most of Mexico's wars in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, [[camp followers]] known as [[soldaderas]] nursed soldiers wounded in warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Katz, ''The Life and Times of Pancho Villa''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1998, 291.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910-1920) care of soldiers in northern Mexico was also undertaken by the [[Neutral White Cross]], founded by [[Elena Arizmendi Mejia]] after the Mexican Red Cross refused to treat revolutionary soldiers. The Neutral White Cross treated soldiers regardless of their faction.

===France===
Professionalization of nursing in France came in the late 19th and early 20th century. In 1870 France's 1,500 hospitals were operated by 11,000 Catholic sisters; by 1911 there were 15,000 nuns representing over 200 religious orders. Government policy after 1900 was to secularize public institutions, and diminish the role the Catholic Church. The lay staff was enlarged from 14,000 in 1890 to 95,000 in 1911. This political goal came in conflict with the need to maintain better quality of medical care in antiquated facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Katrin. Schultheiss, "Gender and the Limits of Anti-Clericalism: The Secularization of Hospital Nursing in France, 1880–1914," ''French History'' (1998) 12#3 pp 229-245&lt;/ref&gt; Many doctors, while personally anti-clerical, realized their dependence on the Catholic sisters. Most lay nurses came from peasant or working-class families and were poorly trained. Faced with the long hours and low pay, many soon married and left the field, while the Catholic sisters had renounced marriage and saw nursing as their God-given vocation. New government-operated nursing schools turned out nonreligous nurses who were slated for supervisory roles. During the World War, an outpouring of patriotic volunteers brought large numbers of untrained middle-class women into the military hospitals. They left when the war ended but the long-term effect was to heighten the prestige of nursing. In 1922 the government issued a national diploma for nursing.&lt;ref&gt;Katrin Schultheiss, ''Bodies and Souls: politics and the professionalization of nursing in France, 1880–1922'' (2001), pp 3-11, 99, 116&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|History of nursing in the United States}}
[[File:Lillian Wald - William Valentine Schevill.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Lillian Wald]], pioneer of [[public health nursing]], by William Valentine Schevill, [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
[[File:Mother Marianne Cope in her youth.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint [[Marianne Cope]] was among many Catholic nuns to influence the development of modern hospitals and nursing.]]
[[File:Armynursecorps.jpg|thumb|upright|World War II Recruiting poster for the [[United States Army Nurse Corps]] (founded 1901)]]

Nursing professionalized rapidly in the late 19th century as larger hospitals set
up nursing schools that attracted ambitious women from middle- and working-class backgrounds. [[Agnes Elizabeth Jones]] and [[Linda Richards]] established quality [[nursing schools]] in the U.S. and Japan; [[Linda Richards]] was officially America's first professionally trained nurse, having been trained at [[Nightingale School of Nursing|Florence Nightingale's training school]], and subsequently graduating in 1873 from the ''[[New England Hospital for Women and Children]]'' in Boston

In the early 1900s, the autonomous, nursing-controlled, Nightingale-era schools came to an end. Despite the establishment of university-affiliated nursing schools, such as Columbia and Yale, hospital training programs were dominant. Formal "book learning" was discouraged in favor of clinical experience through an apprenticeship. In order to meet a growing demand, hospitals used student nurses as cheap labor at the expense of quality formal education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barker|first1=Anne M.|title=Advanced practice nursing: essential knowledge for the profession|date=2009|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|location=Sudbury, Mass.|isbn=978-0763748999|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hospitals====
The number of hospitals grew from 149 in 1873 to 4,400 in 1910 (with 420,000 beds)&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States'' (1976) p 78&lt;/ref&gt; to 6,300 in 1933, primarily because the public trusted hospitals more and could afford more intensive and professional care.&lt;ref&gt;Kalisch and Kalisch, ''The Advance of American Nursing'' (1978) p 360&lt;/ref&gt;

They were operated by city, state and federal agencies, by churches, by stand-alone non-profits, and by [[for-profit hospital|for-profit]] enterprises run by a local doctor. All the major denominations built hospitals; in 1915, the Catholic Church ran 541, staffed primarily by unpaid nuns.&lt;ref&gt;Bernadette McCauley, ''Who shall take care of our sick?: Roman Catholic sisters and the development of Catholic hospitals in New York City'' (Johns Hopkins UP, 2005)
&lt;/ref&gt; The others sometimes had a small cadre of [[deaconesses]] as staff. Most larger hospitals operated a school of nursing, which provided training to young women, who in turn did much of the staffing on an unpaid basis. The number of active graduate nurses rose rapidly from 51,000 in 1910 to 375,000 in 1940 and 700,000 in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Statistics of the United States'' (1976) p 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protestant churches reentered the health field, especially by setting up orders of women, called deaconesses who dedicated themselves to nursing services.

The modern deaconess movement began in Germany in 1836 when [[Theodor Fliedner]] and his wife opened the first deaconess motherhouse in [[Kaiserswerth]] on the Rhine. It became a model and within a half century were over 5,000 deaconesses in Europe. The Chursh of England named its first deaconess in 1862. The North London Deaconess Institution trained deaconesses for other dioceses and some served overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henrietta Blackmore|title=The beginning of women's ministry: the revival of the deaconess in the nineteenth-century Church of England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8LQxO03zXygC&amp;pg=PA131|publisher=Boydell Press|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Passavant]] in 1849 brought the first four deaconesses to Pittsburgh, in the United States, after visiting Kaiserswerth. They worked at the Pittsburgh Infirmary (now Passavant Hospital).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.oefgroup.com/34.html Christ Lutheran Church of Baden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007222534/http://www.oefgroup.com/34.html |date=2009-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Methodists – the largest Protestant denomination—engaged in large-scale missionary activity in Asia and elsewhere in the world, making medical services a priority as early as the 1850s. Methodists in America took note, and began opening their own charitable institutions such as orphanages and old people's homes after 1860. In the 1880s, Methodists began opening hospitals in the United States, which served people of all religious backgrounds beliefs. By 1895 13 hospitals were in operation in major cities. well &lt;ref&gt;Wade Crawford Berkeley, ''History of Methodist Missions: The Methodist Episcopal Church 1845–1939'' (1957) pp 82, 192-93 482&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, U.S. Lutherans, particularly [[John D. Lankenau]], brought seven sisters from Germany to run the [[Lankenau Medical Center|German Hospital]] in Philadelphia.

By 1963, the [[Lutheran Church in America]] had centers for deaconess work in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Omaha.&lt;ref&gt;C.D. Naumann, ''In The Footsteps of Phoebe'' (Concordia Publishing House, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public health====
{{see also|Public health#History}}{{dead link|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Drawing_by_Marguerite_Martyn_of_a_visiting_nurse_with_medicine_and_four_babies,_1918.jpg|thumb|left|February 1918 drawing by [[Marguerite Martyn]] of a public-health nurse in St. Louis, Missouri, with medicine and babies]]
In the U.S., the role of public health nurse began in Los Angeles in 1898, by 1924 there were 12,000 public health nurses, half of them in the 100 largest cities. Their average annual salary in larger cities was $1,390. In addition, there were thousands of nurses employed by private agencies handling similar work. Public health nurses supervised health issues in the public and parochial schools, to prenatal and infant care, handled communicable diseases and tuberculosis and dealt with an aerial diseases.&lt;ref&gt;United States Public Health Service, ''Municipal Health Department Practice for the Year 1923'' (Public Health Bulletin # 164, July 1926), pp. 348, 357, 364&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898, medical conditions in the tropical war zone were dangerous, with yellow fever and malaria endemic. The United States government called for women to volunteer as nurses. Thousands did so, but few were professionally trained. Among the latter were 250 Catholic nurses, most of them from the [[Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes Graf, "Band Of Angels: Sister Nurses in the Spanish–American War," ''Prologue'' (2002) 34#3 pp 196–209. [https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2002/fall/band-of-angels-1.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nursing schools====
Sporadic progress was made on several continents, where medical pioneers established formal nursing schools. But even as late as the 1870s, "women working in North American urban hospitals typically were untrained, working class, and accorded lowly status by both the medical profession they supported and society at large". Nursing had the same status in Great Britain and continental Europe before World War I.&lt;ref name="Quinn"&gt;{{cite web|last=Quinn|first=Shawna M.|title=Agnes Warner and the Nursing Sisters of the Great War|url=http://www.gooselane.com/media/741.pdf|publisher=Goose Lane editions and the New Brunswick Military Heritage Project|year=2010|isbn= 978-0-86492-633-3|accessdate=28 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123140521/http://gooselane.com/media/741.pdf|archivedate=23 November 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hospital nursing schools in the United States and Canada took the lead in applying Nightingale's model to their training programmers:
{{quote|text=standards of classroom and on-the-job training had risen sharply in the 1880s and 1890s, and along with them the expectation of decorous and professional conduct&lt;ref name="Quinn"/&gt;}}
In late the 1920s, the women's specialties in health care included 294,000 trained nurses, 150,000 untrained nurses, 47,000 midwives, and 550,000 other hospital workers (most of them women).&lt;ref&gt;Harry H. Moore, "Health and Medical Practice" in President's Research Committee on Social Trends, ''Recent Social Trends in the United States'' (1933) p1064&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades, professionalization has moved [[Nurse education|nursing degrees]] out of RN-oriented hospital schools and into community colleges and universities. Specialization has brought numerous [[nursing journal|journals]] to broaden the knowledge base of the profession.

===World War I===

====Britain====
By the beginning of World War I, military nursing still had only a small role for women in Britain; 10,500 nurses enrolled in [[Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service]] (QAIMNS) and the [[Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service]]. These services dated to 1902 and 1918, and enjoyed royal sponsorship. There also were [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] (VAD) nurses who had been enrolled by the Red Cross.&lt;ref&gt;Brenda McBride, ''Quiet Heroines: Story of the Nurses of the Second World War'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; The ranks that were created for the new nursing services were Matron-in-Chief, Principal Matron, Sister and Staff Nurses. Women joined steadily throughout the War. At the end of 1914, there were 2,223 regular and reserve members of the QAIMNS and when the war ended there were 10,404 trained nurses in the QAIMNS.&lt;ref name="qaranc.co.uk"/&gt;

Grace McDougall (1887–1963) was the energetic commandant of the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), which had formed in 1907 as an auxiliary to the home guard in Britain. McDougall at one point was captured by the Germans but escaped. The British army wanted nothing to do with them so they drove ambulances and ran hospitals and casualty clearing stations for the Belgian and French armies.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Terry, "McDougall, Grace Alexandra (1887–1963)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (2004); online edn, May 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/59610, accessed 6 March 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janet Lee, "A Nurse and a Soldier: Gender, Class and National Identity in the First World War Adventures of Grace McDougall and Flora Sandes," ''[[Women's History Review]]'' (2006) 15#1 pp 83-103; Janet Lee, ''War girls: the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry in the First World War'' (Manchester University Press, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
When Canadian nurses volunteered to serve during World War I, they were made commissioned officers by the [[Canadian Army]] before being sent overseas,&lt;ref name="Nurses Canadian Military"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nurses (Canadian Military)|url=http://www.cmhg.gc.ca/flash/gl-ga/index-eng.asp?letter=N&amp;page=2|publisher=Canadian Military History Gateway|accessdate=28 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120050616/http://www.cmhg.gc.ca/flash/gl-ga/index-eng.asp?letter=N&amp;page=2|archive-date=20 January 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; a move that would grant them some authority in the ranks, so that enlisted patients and orderlies would have to comply with their direction. Canada was the first country in the world to grant women this privilege. At the beginning of the War, nurses were not dispatched to the casualty clearing stations near the front lines, where they would be exposed to shell fire. They were initially assigned to hospitals a safe distance away from the front lines. As the war continued, however, nurses were assigned to casualty clearing stations. They were exposed to shelling, and caring for soldiers with "[[shell shock]]" and casualties suffering the effects of new weapons such as poisonous gas, as Katherine Wilson-Sammie recollects in ''Lights Out! A Canadian Nursing Sister’s Tale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson-Sammie|first=Katherine M.|title=Lights Out! A Canadian Nursing Sister's Tale|year=1981|publisher=Mikey|ISBN= 9780919303515|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; World War I was also the first war in which a clearly marked hospital ship evacuating the wounded was targeted and sunk by an enemy submarine or torpedo boat, an act that had previously been considered unthinkable, but which happened repeatedly (see [[List of hospital ships sunk in World War I]]). Nurses were among the casualties.

Canadian women volunteering to serve overseas as nurses overwhelmed the army with applications.&lt;ref name="Quinn"/&gt; A total of 3,141 Canadian "nursing sisters" served in the [[Canadian Army Medical Corps]] and 2,504 of those served overseas in England, France and the Eastern Mediterranean at Gallipoli, Alexandria and Salonika. By the end of the First World War, 46 Canadian Nursing Sisters had died&lt;ref name="Nurses Canadian Military"/&gt; In addition to these nurses serving overseas with the military, others volunteered and paid their own way over with organizations such as the [[Canadian Red Cross]], the [[Victorian Order of Nurses]], and [[St. John Ambulance]]. The sacrifices made by these nurses during the War in fact gave a boost to the women's suffrage movement in many of the countries that fought in the war. The Canadian Army nursing sisters were among the first women in the world to win the right to vote in a federal election; the Military Voters Act of 1917 extended the vote to women in the service such as Nursing Sisters.

====Australia====

[[Image:Grace Wilson on Lemnos.jpg|thumb|right|Sister [[Grace Wilson]] of the 3rd Australian General Hospital on [[Lemnos]]. She sailed from Sydney, New South Wales on board RMS ''Mooltan'' on 15 May 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au/showUnit?unitCode=MED26.67.3AGH3 ''3rd Australian General Hospital'']. The [[First Australian Imperial Force|AIF]] Project.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Australian nurses served in the war as part of the [[List of Australian Army medical units in World War I#Australian General Hospital|Australian General Hospital]]. Australia established two hospitals at [[Lemnos]] and Heliopolis Islands to support the Dardanelles campaign at Gallipoli. Nursing recruitment was sporadic, with some reserve nurses sent with the advance parties to set up the transport ship HMAS ''Gascoyne'' while others simply fronted to Barracks and were accepted, while still others were expected to pay for their passage in steerage. Australian nurses from this period became known as "grey ghosts" because of their drab uniforms with starched collar and cuffs.

During the course of the war, Australian nurses were granted their own administration rather than working under medical officers. Australian Nurses hold the record for the maximum number of triage cases processed by a casualty station in a twenty-four-hour period during the [[battle of Passchendale]]. Their work routinely included administering ether during haemostatic surgery and managing and training medical assistants (orderlies).&lt;ref&gt;Guns and Brooches: Australian Army Nursing Boer - Gulf War by Jan Bassett&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 560 Australian army nurses served in India during the war, where they had to overcome a debilitating climate, outbreaks of disease, insufficient numbers, overwork and hostile British Army officers.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Rae, "Reading between Unwritten Lines: Australian Army Nurses in India, 1916–19", '' Journal of the Australian War Memorial'' (2001), #36 pp 1+&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interwar===
Surveys in the U.S. showed that nurses often got married a few years after graduation and quit work; other waited 5 to 10 years for marriage; careerists some never married. By the 1920s increasing numbers of married nurses continued to work. The high turnover meant that advanvcement could be rapid; the average age of a nursing supervisor in a hospital was only 26 years. Wages for private duty nurses were high in the 1920s—$1,300 a year when working full-time in patients' homes or at their private rooms in hospitals. This was more than double what a woman could earn as a teacher or in office work. Rates fell sharply when the Great Depression came in 1929, and continuous work was much harder to find.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Reverby, ''Ordered to Care'', pp 98, 103, 105&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===

====Canada====
Over 4000 women served as nurses in uniform in the Canadian Armed Forces during the Second World War. They were called "Nursing Sisters" and had already been professionally trained in civilian life. However, in military service they achieved an elite status well above what they had experienced as civilians. The Nursing Sisters had much more responsibility and autonomy, and had more opportunity to use their expertise, then civilian nurses. They were often close to the front lines, and the military doctors – all men – delegated significant responsibility to the nurses because of the high level of casualties, the shortages of physicians, and extreme working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Toman, "Front Lines and Frontiers: War as Legitimate Work for Nurses, 1939–1945," ''Social History / Histoire Sociale'' (2007) 40#79 pp 45-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Toman, ''An Officer and a Lady: Canadian Military Nursing and the Second World War'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, sixty five front line nurses from the General Hospital Division in British Singapore were ordered aboard the Vyner Brook and Empire Star for evacuation, rather than caring for wounded. The ships were strafed with machine gun fire by Japanese planes. Sisters Vera Torney and Margaret Anderson were awarded medals when they could find nothing else on the crowded deck and covered their patients with their own bodies. A version of this action was honoured in the film [[Paradise Road (1997 film)|''Paradise Road'']]. The Vyner Brook was bombed and sank quickly in shallow water of the Sumatra Strait and all but twenty-one were lost at sea, presumed drowned. The remaining nurses swam ashore at Mentok, [[Sumatra]]. The twenty-one nurses and some British and Australian troops were marched into the sea and killed with machine gun fire in the [[Banka Island massacre]]. Sister [[Vivian Bullwinkel]] was the only survivor. She became Australia's premier nursing war hero when she nursed wounded British soldiers in the jungle for three weeks, despite her own flesh wound. She survived on the charity provided by Indonesian locals, but eventually hunger and the privations of hiding in mangrove swamp forced her to surrender. She remained imprisoned for the remainder of the war.

At around the same time, another group of twelve nurses stationed at the Rabaul mission in New Guinea were captured along with missionaries by invading Japanese troops and interred at their camp for two years. They cared for a number of British, Australian and American wounded. Toward the end of the war, they were transferred to a concentration camp in Kyoto and imprisoned under freezing conditions and forced into hard labour.

====United States====

As Campbell (1984) shows, the nursing profession was transformed by World War Two. Army and Navy nursing was highly attractive and a larger proportion of nurses volunteered for service higher than any other occupation in American society.&lt;ref&gt;Deann Campbell, ''Women at War with America: Private Lives in a Patriotic Era'' (1984) ch 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip A. Kalisch and Beatrice J. Kalisch, ''American Nursing: A History'' (4th ed. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

The public image of the nurses was highly favorable during the war, as the simplified by such Hollywood films as "Cry 'Havoc'" which made the selfless nurses heroes under enemy fire. Some nurses were captured by the Japanese,&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Norman, '' We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; but in practice they were kept out of harm's way, with the great majority stationed on the home front. However, 77 were stationed in the jungles of the Pacific, where their uniform consisted of "khaki slacks, mud, shirts, mud, field shoes, mud, and fatigues."&lt;ref&gt;Mary T. Sarnecky, ''A history of the U.S. Army Nurse Corps'' (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=maGqQnddNpkC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22khaki+slacks,+mud,+shirts,+mud,+field+shoes,+mud,+and+fatigues.%22+%28%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6VA2TvmFH4bhiALg3om6CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22khaki%20slacks%2C%20mud%2C%20shirts%2C%20mud%2C%20field%20shoes%2C%20mud%2C%20and%20fatigues.%22%20%28%22&amp;f=false p. 199 online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Udin|first=Zaf|title=Nursing Uniforms of the Past and Present|url=http://www.pulseuniform.com/nursing/nursing-uniforms.asp?pg=2|publisher=Pulse Uniform}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical services were large operations, with over 600,000 soldiers, and ten enlisted men for every nurse. Nearly all the doctors were men, with women doctors allowed only to examine the WAC.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1984"&gt;Campbell, ''Women at War with America'' (1984) ch 2&lt;/ref&gt;

President Franklin D. Roosevelt hailed the service of nurses in the war effort in his final "Fireside Chat" of January 6, 1945. Expecting heavy casualties in the invasion of Japan, he called for a compulsory draft of nurses. The casualties never happened and there was never a draft of American nurses.&lt;ref&gt;see [https://archive.org/details/1945RadioNews 1945 Radio News : WA4CZD : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Britain====
During [[World War II]], nurses belonged to [[Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps|Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service]] (QAIMNS), as they had during World War I, and as they remain today. (Nurses belonging to the QAIMNS are informally called "QA"s.) Members of the Army Nursing Service served in every overseas British military campaign during World War II, as well as at military hospitals in Britain. At the beginning of World War II, nurses held officer status with equivalent rank, but were not commissioned officers. In 1941, emergency commissions and a rank structure were created, conforming with the structure used in the rest of the British Army. Nurses were given rank badges and were now able to be promoted to ranks from Lieutenant through to Brigadier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=QA World War Two Nursing|url=http://www.qaranc.co.uk/qa_world_war_two_nursing.php|publisher=qaranc.co.uk|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nurses were exposed to all dangers during the War, and some were captured and became prisoners of war.

====Germany====
Germany had a very large and well organized nursing service, with three main organizations, one for Catholics, one for Protestants, and the DRK (Red Cross). In 1934 the Nazis set up their own nursing unit, the Brown Nurses, absorbing one of the smaller groups, bringing it up to 40,000 members. It set up kindergartens, hoping to seize control of the minds of the younger Germans, in competition with the other nursing organizations. Civilian psychiatric nurses who were Nazi party members participated in the killings of invalids, although the process was shrouded in euphemisms and denials.&lt;ref&gt;Bronny Rebekah McFarland-Icky, ''Nurses in Nazi Germany'' (Princeton University Press, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Military nursing was primarily handled by the DRK, which came under partial Nazi control. Front line medical services were provided by male medics and doctors. Red Cross nurses served widely within the military medical services, staffing the hospitals that perforce were close to the front lines and at risk of bombing attacks. Two dozen were awarded the highly prestigious Iron Cross for heroism under fire. They are among the 470,000 German women who served with the military.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Williamson, ''World War II German Women's Auxiliary Services'' (2003) pp 34–36&lt;/ref

'''Ida Pauline Rolf''' (May 19, 1896 – March 19, 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rolfguild.org/about/ida-p-rolf-phd|title=Guild for Structural Integration: Ida P. Rolf, Ph.D. - Ida P. Rolf Method training and information|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a biochemist and the creator of [[Structural Integration]] or "[[Rolfing]]".

==Early life and education==
Rolf was born in [[New York City]] in the [[Bronx]] on May 19, 1896. An only child, her father, Bernard Rolf, was a civil engineer who built docks and piers on the east coast.

Rolf graduated from [[Barnard College]] in 1916 with a bachelor's degree. She was in the Mathematics Club, German Club, Vice President of the class of 1916, a member of the Young Women's Christian Assn., was the alternate for the Graduate Fellowship while working at the Rockefeller Foundation, Business Manager of The Barnard Bulletin, and a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. She received Departmental Honours in Chemistry at graduation. In 1917 she began her doctoral studies at [[Columbia University]] and, concurrently, Rolf also began work at the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] as a chemical research worker. She was invited back to Barnard College in 1918 to speak to students about "work experiences".

In 1920, Rolf earned her PhD in [[biochemistry|biological chemistry]] under the supervision of [[Phoebus Aaron Theodore Levene]], of Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. Her dissertation was entitled; "Three Contributions to the Chemistry of the Unsaturated Phosphatides", originally printed in three separate issues of "The Journal of Biological Chemistry", it was again printed in its entirety as a bound book in late 1922,  "[[Phosphatidate|Phosphatides]]".

Throughout the decade, she was studying yoga and tantra with [[Pierre Bernard (yogi)|Pierre Bernard]].

==Career==
After graduating, Rolf continued to work with Levene at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City. In 1918 she was promoted to assistant in the chemistry lab.

In 1922, two years after having received her PhD from Columbia, Rolf was raised to associate, then the highest non-tenured position for a scientist at Rockefeller.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Sam|title=Ida Rolf and the Two Paradigms|journal=International Association of Structural Integrators (IASI) Yearbook|date=2007|url=http://www.samjohnsonrolfing.com/reading/ida-rolf-and-the-two-paradigms/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1919 to 1927 she published 16 scholarly journal papers, mostly in the ''[[Journal of Biological Chemistry]]''. Her research was primarily laboratory studies on biochemical compounds [[lecithin]] and [[phosphatidylethanolamine|cephalin]]. With the exception of her doctoral dissertation, all of her published work was co-authored with Levene.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

In 1926, Rolf left her academic work in New York, to study mathematics and atomic physics at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] in Zurich and also biochemistry at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in France.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

Rolf later developed [[Structural Integration]]. In addition to her 16 academic papers published from 1919 to 1927, she would later publish two papers in scholarly journals on structural integration. She had an [[h-index]] of 10 with a total number of 299 [[citation]]s (February, 2007).

==Structural Integration (Rolfing)==
{{main|Rolfing}}
Structural Integration (or Rolfing) is a type of [[manual therapy]] that aims to improve human biomechanical functioning as a whole rather than to treat particular symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Eric: ''The Journal of alternative and complementary medicine''. Volume 17, Number 9, 2011, p.775.&lt;/ref&gt; Rolf began developing her system in the 1940s. Her main goal was to organize the human bodily structure in relation to [[gravity]]. Rolf called her method "[[Structural Integration]]", now also commonly known by the trademark "[[Rolfing]]".&lt;ref name= "Salvo"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Salvo |first1= Susan G. |year= 2012 |title= Massage Therapy: Principles and Practice |publisher= Elsevier Saunders |page= 423] |edition= 4 |isbn= 1437719775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural integration is a pseudoscience and its claimed benefits are not substantiated by medical evidence.&lt;ref name=pop&gt;{{cite book |author=Cordón, LA |work=Popular Psychology: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uy1gmwcAgg4C&amp;pg=PA218 |date=January 2005 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-32457-4 |pages=217–218 |title=Rolfing }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aus17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/0E9129B3574FCA53CA257BF0001ACD11/$File/Natural%20Therapies%20Overview%20Report%20Final%20with%20copyright%2011%20March.pdf |publisher=Australian Government &amp;ndash; Department of Health |format=PDF |author=Baggoley C |title=Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Therapies for Private Health Insurance |year=2015 |laysummary=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/australian-review-finds-no-benefit-to-17-natural-therapies |lay-source=Gavura, S. Australian review finds no benefit to 17 natural therapies. Science-Based Medicine. |lay-date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rolf's second son, Richard, helped her to continue developing and refining Structural Integration, as well as assisting in preliminary studies of the healing effects of structural integration. They taught Structural Integration classes at locations around the United States from the 1960s thru the late 1970s. Auditor and practitioner classes were taught in California, Florida, and Glassboro NJ. Based for many years in New York City where they shared office and work space, they worked together to advance the practice and to make the general public aware of the practice and benefits of Structural Integration.&lt;ref name="Demmerle"&gt;Demmerle, Richard, DC (Dec 2007). [http://www.somatics.de/DemmerleR_memories.pdf "Memories of an Exceptional Pioneer"]. ''Structural Integration''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1960s she began teaching at [[Esalen Institute]], where she created a loyal following of students and practitioners.&lt;ref name=Stillerman&gt;{{cite book |last= Stillerman |first= Elaine |year= 2009 |title= Modalities for Massage and Bodywork |publisher= [[Mosby (publisher)|Mosby]] |pages= 152, 157, 329–345 |isbn= 032305255X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esalen was the epicenter of the [[Human Potential Movement]], allowing Rolf to exchange ideas with many contemporary visionaries, including [[Fritz Perls]].&lt;ref name=Claire&gt;{{cite book |last= Claire |first= Thomas |year= 1995 |title= Bodywork: What Type of Massage to Get and How to Make the Most of It |publisher= [[William Morrow and Co.]] |pages= 40–56 |isbn= 9781591202325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perls|first1=Frederick|title=In and Out of the Garbage Pail|date=1969|publisher=Real People Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ux4pAQAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Esalen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Rolf´s teaching activities were consolidated under the Rolf Institute of Structural Integration (RISI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kepler.sos.ca.gov |title= Business Search (search for 'Rolf Institute') |publisher= Secretary of State, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zenpioneer"&gt;Stirling, Isabel. ''Zen Pioneer: The Life &amp; Works of Ruth Fuller Sasaki'' (2006) Shoemaker &amp; Hoard. {{ISBN|978-1-59376-110-3}} p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The school has been based in Boulder, Colorado since 1972. As of 2010, the RISI had graduated 1536 practitioners, including some trained in Germany, Brazil, Japan and Australia. In 1990, a group of senior RISI faculty split to found the Guild of Structural Integration, which had 628 graduates as of 2010. Currently there are nearly two dozen schools teaching Structural Integration.&lt;ref name="Jacobson, Eric 2011, p. 778"&gt;Jacobson, Eric: ''The Journal of alternative and complementary medicine''. Volume 17, Number 9, 2011, p. 778.&lt;/ref&gt; Standards are maintained by a professional membership organization, the International Association of Structural Integration.&lt;ref name = Myers/&gt;

In addition to the proliferation of practitioners and training institutes that are devoted specifically to Structural Integration, Rolf's concepts and methods have influenced a wide range of other contemporary manual therapies. A growing number of organizations offer training in "structural bodywork" or in techniques of fascial manipulation that are clearly derivative but lack the holistic perspective of Structural Integration, instead focusing only on the treatment of specific symptoms (i.e. massage therapists, chiropractors or physical therapists).&lt;ref name="Jacobson, Eric 2011, p. 778"/&gt;&lt;ref name = Myers&gt;Myers, Tom: ''Structural Integration. Developments in Ida Rolf´s recipe''. I. J Bodywork Movement Ther 2004, pp. 131-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research foundation==
In 2007, the Ida P. Rolf Fascia Research Foundation was formed to encourage and support evidence-based studies of Structural Integration's effects and its implications for conventional and complementary health care. It was introduced at the First International Fascia Research Congress (FRC) at the Harvard Medical Center. The foundation is dedicated to growing a symbiotic relationship between science and therapeutic practice.  These events bring scientists and clinicians together to share their ideas and encourage collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rolfresearchfoundation.org|title=Ida P. Rolf Research Foundation - Charting the Science of Structural Integration|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fasciacongress.org|title=Fourth International Fascia Research Congress, Washington, D.C., September 18-20, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascia Research Congress occurred again in 2009 in Amsterdam, 2012 in Vancouver, BC, and in 2015 in Virginia, US.

==Personal life==
Ida Rolf was married to Walter Frederick Demmerle, an electrical and mechanical engineer who held patents for heating thermostats, and traveled abroad frequently with his work. They resided in [[Stony Brook, New York]], and [[Manhasset]], NY while raising a family. They had two sons, Alan Michael Demmerle and Richard Rolf Demmerle. Richard was a chiropractor and also a Rolfing instructor and practitioner who was involved in, and helped refine and develop his mother's Rolfing project and continued her work after Ida's death. 
Richard has three sons, Rolf Walter, Jean-Pierre, and Michael Richard. Richard moved to Switzerland in 1979 with Brigitte Waldmeier Demmerle, his wife, and their youngest son Michael Richard Demmerle.

The '''Intersex Campaign for Equality''' ('''IC4E''') is a [[NGO|non-governmental organization]] that advocates for the [[intersex human rights|human rights of intersex people]].&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Mission|url=http://www.intersexequality.com/mission/|website= Intersex Campaign for Equality |accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formerly the US affiliate of [[Organisation Intersex International]].&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite web|title = New Mission and Independent Status for IC4E as Viloria resigns from post as OII Chair | url = http://www.intersexequality.com/new-mission-and-independent-status-for-ic4e-as-viloria-resigns-from-post-as-oii-chair/ |date = November 8, 2017 | author = Intersex Campaign for Equality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and staff==
The Intersex Campaign for Equality was founded as an affiliate of [[Organisation Intersex International]] in February 2011.&lt;ref name="mission" /&gt; The founder and director is author and activist [[Hida Viloria]].&lt;ref name="mission" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpo-jun2013"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hida Viloria|title=Op-ed: Intersex, the Final Coming-Out Frontier|url=http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2013/06/12/op-ed-intersex-final-coming-out-frontier|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dana Zzyym]] has been the associate director since February 19, 2015, when intersex activists Dr. Dani Lee Harris, Hida Viloria, and Zzyym re-branded the Intersex Campaign for Equality (IC4E).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intersexequality.com/mission/directors/|title=Who We Are|accessdate=December 17, 2017|website=IC4E}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, the Campaign announced their departure from [[Organisation Intersex International]].&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;

==Mission==
IC4E aims to campaign for the human rights of [[intersex]] people, particularly rights to self-determination and bodily integrity. It also aims to support intersex individuals, and provide information on the actual life experiences of people with intersex variations to professionals working providing services to them, including medical personnel, psychological experts, sexologists, sociologists and academics.

The Intersex Campaign for Equality is a multi-gendered, multi-orientation, multi-racial NGO founded by and for intersex people.{{cn|date=December 2017}} The Intersex Campaign for Equality's mission is to attain human rights—particularly the rights to bodily integrity, self-determination, legal recognition, and de-pathologization—for all intersex people regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ability or class, recognizing that some intersex individuals, particularly those with [[nonbinary]] gender identities, remain marginalized even within the intersex community.&lt;ref name="mission" /&gt;

==Advocacy==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
IC4E advocates for human rights for intersex people in the United States via personal communication, consulting, public speaking, publishing, and lobbying. The organization also provides peer support, news updates, information, and educational events and lectures. They have lobbied extensively in the press and in print against intersex genital mutilation, aka medically unnecessary "normalizing" genital [[intersex medical interventions|surgeries and hormone treatments]] of intersex infants and minors, and against discriminatory regulations for intersex female athletes.

In 2011, founder and director Hida Viloria lobbied the [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] for inclusion of intersex people, as the "I" in "LGBTI", in LGBT anti-discrimination policies.

=== Physical integrity and bodily autonomy ===
Attaining the right to physical integrity and bodily determination through an end to the practice of nonconsensual medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex infants and minors--a.k.a. Intersex Genital Mutilation (IGM)--is one of IC4E's founding goals and a primary focus of our education and advocacy work. In 2012, IC4E called for an end to IGM as participants of the Second [[International Intersex Forum]] in Stockholm. In addition, upon suggestion of our participating representative [[Hida Viloria]], Forum participants called for IGM to be framed as human rights issue. This was done in an open letter authored by Viloria&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/Attachments/hrd_2012_-_intersex_forum_-_un_navil_pillay_letter.pdf Open Letter: A Call for the Inclusion of Human Rights for Intersex People], ILGA Europe, 10 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; signed by participants of the Forum and delivered to [[United Nations]] [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]], [[Navi Pillay]]. In 2013, Viloria served as the sole American co-organizer of the Third [[International Intersex Forum]] in Malta, which culminated in the creation of the [[Malta declaration (International Intersex Forum)]], the most widely agreed upon list of human rights demands--including an end to IGM--by the global intersex community.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

In addition, IC4E team members have been advocating individually, since for IC4E's founding, for an end to IGM. Southesstern Regional Rep. Dr. Dani Lee Harris, of Atlanta, has been educating and advocating for an end to IGM for years via lectures in his Southern Baptist community, and did so in the 2012 intersex documentary ''Intersexion''. Associate Director Dana Zzyym has been advocating against IGM for many years as a college lecturer, and also in the mainstream media,  including interviews on ABC NEWS, since filing their groundbreaking lawsuit for a non-binary U.S. passport on [[Intersex Awareness Day]], October 26, 2015, with [[Lambda Legal]] as their legal representative. (The case is still pending as of December, 2017.){{cn|date=December 2017}}

Founding E.D. Hida Viloria has been advocating against IGM since 1996 via numerous television, film and radio interviews. S/he has also published extensively on the issue, discussing opposition to IGM in the majority of her numerous published essays,&lt;ref name="Hida Viloria Bibliography"&gt;[http://hidaviloria.com/wp-content/uploads/Hida-Viloria-Bibliography-3.pdf Hida Viloria Bibliography], HidaViloria.com. Retrieved 13 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as specifically in essays in the ''[[Narrative Inquiry in Bioethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://narrativebioethics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Voices_2016_INTERSEX_FINAL.pdf Promoting Health and Social Progress by Accepting and Depathologizing Benign Intersex Traits], ''Narrative Inquiry in Bioethics'',''VOICES: Personal Stories from the Pages of NIB'', "Normalizing Intersex," Issue 2, 2016, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]],''&lt;ref name="advocate-sep2013"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hida Viloria|title=Op-ed: Why We Must Protect Intersex Babies|url=http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2013/09/27/op-ed-why-we-must-protect-intersex-babies|website=The Advocate|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=September 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[CNN]].com.''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/09/18/hida.viloria.intersex.athlete/index.html Commentary: My Life as a Mighty Hermaphrodite], ''CNN.com'', 18 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Viloria provided expert testimony, in Spanish, in 2013 for the Spanish language television court show ''[[Caso Cerrado]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgRRWC4i28o|title=Bebé intersexual #700 (3 3) Caso Cerrado|author=justices1989|date=October 15, 2013|accessdate=January 12, 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was interviewed on ''[[BBC World Service]]'' radio twice: in May, regarding the ground-breaking U.S. lawsuit by the parents of an intersex child against the doctors that operated on him as an infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0188d3z|title=Newshour, Dealing with Syria|publisher=BBC World Service|date=May 16, 2013|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ending IGM is a primary topic of he/r memoir, ''Born Both: An Intersex Life'', the first book by an openly intersex person to be published by a [[Big Five (publishers)|Big Five]] publishing house, [[Hachette Book Group]], in 2017.

=== Third Gender Identification documents ===
On [[Intersex Awareness Day]], October 26, 2015, Associate Director Dana Zzyym made history by announcing that they, along with their legal representatives from [[Lambda Legal]], the U.S.'s oldest LGBT legal rights organization, are suing the [[United States Department of State]] for legal gender recognition on their passport as someone who is neither male nor female. Zzyym was born intersex and identifies as non-binary and is seeking accurate federal gender recognition.

The lawsuit received extensive coverage in national venues such as ''[[The Washington Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/10/27/intersex-applicants-face-passport-discrimination-says-lawsuit-seeking-option-other-than-m-or-f/|title=Intersex applicants face passport discrimination, says lawsuit seeking option other than ‘M’ or ‘F’|author=Lisa Rein|publisher=The Washington Post|date=October 27, 2015|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Huffington Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/intersex-veteran-passport_us_562f8076e4b0c66bae5962e1|title=Intersex Navy Veteran Sues State Department For Denying Passport|author=Keith Coffman|date=October 27, 2015|publisher=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''CNN.com'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/23/us/veteran-intersex-passport-lawsuit/index.html|title=Intersex veteran sues over passport denial|author=Salim Essaid|publisher=CNN|date=July 23, 2016|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/07/22/intersex-person-dana-zzyym-denied-passport-sues-u-s-government/|title=Intersex person Dana Zzyym denied passport, sues U.S. government|date=July 22, 2016|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-intersex-lawsuit-20160720-snap-story.html|title=Intersex person who was denied a passport over gender designation sues U.S. government|author=Hailey Branson-Potts|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|date=July 20, 2016|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Advocate'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/travel/2015/10/27/intersex-veteran-denied-passport-refusing-choose-gender-files-lawsuit|title=Intersex Veteran Denied Passport For Refusing to Choose Gender, Files Lawsuit|author=Elizabeth Daley|date=October 27, 2015|publisher=The Advocate|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many more, bringing widespread mainstream attention to the existence of, and the need for equal rights for, intersex people.

===Access to sport===
Hida Viloria has experience in advising the International Olympic Committee on intersex perspectives in access to sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oii.org.au/7291/bay-area-reporter-iocs-unkind-cuts/ The IOC's unkind cuts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212231103/http://oii.org.au/7291/bay-area-reporter-iocs-unkind-cuts/ |date=2013-12-12 }}, Roger Brigham, [[Bay Area Reporter]], March 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hida Patricia Viloria|author2=Maria Jose Martínez-Patino|title=Reexamining Rationales of "Fairness": An Athlete and Insider's Perspective on the New Policies on Hyperandrogenism in Elite Female Athletes|date=2012|volume=12|issue=7|pages=17–19|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2012.680543|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theglobalherald.com/opinion-gender-rules-in-sport-leveling-the-playing-field-or-reversed-doping/14837/ Gender Rules in Sport – Leveling The Playing Field, Or Reversed Doping?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514122301/http://theglobalherald.com/opinion-gender-rules-in-sport-leveling-the-playing-field-or-reversed-doping/14837/ |date=2013-05-14 }}, Hida Viloria, The Global Herald, April 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; With Spanish hurdler Maria José Martínez-Patiño,&lt;ref name="si-sep2009"&gt;{{cite web|author1=David Epstein|title=Well, Is She Or Isn't She?|url=https://www.si.com/vault/2009/09/07/105854299/well-is-she-or-isnt-she|website=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viloria has argued that Olympic sex testing is applied in a way that targets only "[[butch and femme|butch]]" women, those who are "masculine looking".&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt; On International Human Rights Day 2013, Hida Vilora spoke as director of IC4E at the [[United Nations]] event, "Sport Comes Out Against Homophobia".&lt;ref name="untv-dec2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sport Comes Out Against Homophobia|url=http://webtv.un.org/watch/sport-comes-out-against-homophobia/2920436290001/#full-text|website=UN Web TV|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unnews-dec2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=At UN human rights event, Navratilova and Collins decry homophobic violence|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=46706&amp;Cr=homophobia&amp;Cr1=#.WHgmD5KSNrV|website=UN News Centre|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Human Rights Day]] 2013, Viloria spoke at the United Nations, educating about the human rights violations intersex people face and the need for legal protection from discrimination at the event, "Sport Comes Out Against Homophobia".&lt;ref name="outright-dec2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Human Rights Day 2013: Sport Comes Out Against Homophobia|url=https://www.outrightinternational.org/content/international-human-rights-day-2013-sport-comes-out-against-homophobia|website=[[OutRight Action International]]|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pr-dec2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/1645169|title=Free &amp;amp; Equal Releases Video of Landmark Event Featuring United Nations Leaders, Sports Stars and LGBT and Intersex Activists|publisher=Digital Journal|date=December 17, 2013|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, in early 2010, before founding the organization, Viloria lobbied the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) for equal treatment of intersex female athletes after the gender verification testing of South African track star [[Caster Semenya]]. This resulted in h/er participating, by invitation, at the IOC 's 2010 meeting of experts in Lausanne, Switzerland, where s/he lobbied that intersex female athletes be allowed to compete as is, without having to undergo unnecessary medical treatments, and that the use of the pathologizing term "disorders of sex development"/DSD to describe these athletes be discontinued.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In 2014, Viloria spoke about discrimination against intersex female athletes on [[Aljazeera]]'s ''[[The Stream]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/201409031709-0024124|title=No games for women with 'too much' testosterone|date=September 2, 2014|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media and visibility work===
Founder and Director Hida Viloria is one of the first individuals in the world to come out publicly as intersex, via numerous television, film and radio interviews beginning in 1996. He/r media and visibility work includes appearances on such high-profile television programs as ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''20/20'', and ''[[The Tyra Banks Show]]'', reaching an estimated 100 million viewers via broadcast and additional [[YouTube]] views.

Since founding the organization in 2011, Viloria has published extensively on intersex issues, in publications such as

In 2015, on October 26, Intersex Awareness Day, IC4E Associate Director Dana Zzyym announced the filing of their groundbreaking lawsuit for a non-binary U.S. passport. The case has garnered widespread attention by the mainstream media, including ''ABC News, The Washington Post, The Washington Blade,'' and many others, and is expected to continue to as it develops (case still pending as of December 2017).

In March, 2017, E.D. Viloria became the first openly intersex author to be published by one of the [[Big Five (publishers)|Big Five]] publishers, [[Hatchette Book Group]], with the release of he/r memoir, ''Born Both: An Intersex Life''.&lt;ref name="bornboth-hachette"&gt;{{cite web|title=Born Both |url=https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/hida-viloria/born-both/9780316347846/ |website=Hachette Book Group |accessdate=January 12, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204004719/https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/hida-viloria/born-both/9780316347846/ |archivedate=February 4, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; S/he has subsequently been featured in interviews in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Psychology Today]]'', and [[NPR]]. The memoir has garnered widespread attention by the mainstream media, including praise in the ''[[New York Times]], [[The Washington Post]]'', and numerous other venues, and selections by ''[[People Magazine]]'' as one of six Best New Books,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intersexequality.com/intersex-memoir-praised-in-the-new-york-times-washington-post-more/ Intersex memoir praised in the New York Times, Washington post, and more], Intersex Campaign for Equality, 31 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; [[School Library Journal]] as one of ten best adult books for teens,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slj.com/2017/09/collection-development/adult-books-for-teens/physics-fears-female-empowerment-adult-books-4-teens/#_Physcism Fears, &amp; Female Empowerment: Adult Books 4 Teens], ''School Library Journal'', 13 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and more.

=== Publications ===
On [[Intersex Awareness Day]], October 26, 2012, the organization published the free educational resource ''Brief Guidelines for Intersex Allies''.&lt;ref name="allies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief Guidelines for Intersex Allies|url=http://www.intersexequality.com/information-intersex-allies/|website=IC4E|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, IC4E published ''Your Beautiful Child: Information for Parents'', a resource of non-stigmatizing information for parents, authored by Viloria, which includes links to unbiased medical studies regarding medically unnecessary surgeries for intersex people,&lt;ref name="child"&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Beautiful Child: Information for Parents|url=http://www.intersexequality.com/information-for-parents-2/|website=IC4E|accessdate=December 17, 2017|date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is being utilized by health care providers around the world.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In 2015, IC4E assisted{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} the [[United Nations Free &amp; Equal|United Nations Free &amp; Equal Campaign]] in drafting their resource, the Intersex Fact Sheet,&lt;ref name="un-lgbtrights"&gt;{{cite web|title=LGBT Rights: Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://unfe-uploads-production.s3.amazonaws.com/unfe-7-UN_Fact_Sheets_v6_-_FAQ.pdf|website=Free &amp; Equal|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016, Viloria's essay, "What's in A Name: Intersex and identity", which calls for a non-stigmatizing, equality based linguistic approach to discussing intersex people, was published in the college curriculum textbook, ''Queer: A Reader for Writers'', by [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;ref name="oxford-queer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Queer: A Reader for Writers|url=http://www.oxfordpresents.com/readers/book_detail.php?isbn13=9780190277109|website=Oxford University Press|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International work ===
IC4E has also been heavily involved in the international intersex human rights movement. On [[Human Rights Day]], December 10, 2012, founder and director Hida Viloria spearheaded a global call for human rights by and for intersex people, via the "Open Letter: A Call for the Inclusion of Human Rights for Intersex People",&lt;ref name="ilga-dec2012"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hida Viloria|title=Open Letter: A Call for the Inclusion of Human Rights for Intersex People|url=http://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/hrd_2012_-_intersex_forum_-_un_navil_pillay_letter_2012.pdf|website=ILGA Europe|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which s/he authored and delivered to the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] with participants of the 2nd [[International Intersex Forum]] in Stockholm signing on in support. The following year, Viloria served as one of three intersex participants chosen by [[ILGA-Europe]] to co-organize the third [[International Intersex Forum]], in Malta, which led to the creation of the Malta Declaration, an internationally agreed declaration of the demands and human rights goals of the international intersex community.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[File:Rithal_village_hariyana_rohtak_0080.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Johad at Rithal village of [[Rohtak district]] of [[Haryana]]]]
A '''johad''' ({{Lang-hi|जोहड}}) is a community-owned traditional [[Rainwater harvesting|harvested rainwater]] [[storage tank|storage]] [[wetland]] principally used for [[Water resources in India|effectively harnessing water resources]] in the state of [[Harayana]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Punjab]], western [[Uttar Pradesh]] of [[North India]], that collects and stores water throughout the year, to be used for the purpose of [[Groundwater recharge|recharging the groundwater]] in the nearby [[water well]]s, washing, bathing and [[Water supply and sanitation in India|drinking by humans and cattle]].&lt;ref name=Joh1&gt;Haruka Yanagisawa, 2015, [https://books.google.com.sg/books?isbn=9971698536 Community, Commons and Natural Resource Management in Asia:]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Joh2&gt;[https://scroll.in/article/715676/video-how-indias-water-man-first-revived-a-river-and-a-village-in-rajasthan Video: How India's 'Water Man' first revived a river and a village in Rajasthan], Scroll.in, 23 Mar 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Joh3&gt;Amanda Suutari and Gerry Marten, [http://www.ecotippingpoints.org/our-stories/indepth/india-rajasthan-rainwater-harvest-restoration-groundwater-johad.html Water Warriors: Rainwater Harvesting to Replenish Underground Water (Rajasthan, India)], Jun 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Joh4&gt;Margaret Robertson, 2007, [https://books.google.com.sg/books?isbn=0864314388 Sustainable Futures: Teaching and Learning: a Case Study Approach].&lt;/ref&gt; Some johads also have bricked or stones masonry and cemented [[ghat]] (series of steps and/or ramp).&lt;ref name=Joh1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Joh2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Joh4/&gt; 

Johads also cater to resident and seasonal [[Bird migration|migrant birds]] as well as wildlife from the nearby [[Forest|bani]] (forest). [[Fishery Survey of India|State fisheries departments]] also promote the use of these johads for [[Fisheries management|raising fishes]] on contract basis for [[Fishing in India|commercial fishing]]. Johads are often seen surrounded by embankment, with water well and trees around them. In many parts, [[Climate of Rajasthan|specially in dry state of Rajasthan]], the annual rainfall is very low (between 450 and 600&amp;nbsp;mm) and the water can be unpleasant to drink. Rainfall during July and August is stored in johads and used throughout the year. Johad in [[Haryanvi language]] and [[Rajasthani language]] are also called ''sarovar'', ''taal'' and ''talab'' in [[Hindi Language|Hindi language]], and water pond or lake in English. Johads are called as ''khadin'' in [[Jaisalmer district]]. Over 4,500 working johads in [[Alwar district]] and surrounding districts Rajasthan were revived by the NGO [[Tarun Bharat Sangh]] by [[Rajendra Singh]]. Haryana formed the Haryana State Waterbody Management Board to rejuvenate and manage 14,000 ponds in the state, including the development of 60 lakes in Delhi NCR falling within the state.&lt;ref name=HarWater1/&gt;&lt;ref name=HarWater2/&gt;

Smaller cemented [[water tank]]s called ''tanki'' or ''tanka'' in parts of Rajasthan are also sometimes mistakenly referred to as johad. Concretised rain-fed ''tanka'' and canal-fed ''diggi'' are different from the johads.

==Johad wetlands==
===Construction===
Johads can be of several types, such as dug out in areas to which rainwater can be easily channeled. Alternatively, simple mud and rubble barrier [[check dam]]s may be built across the contour of a slope with a high embankment on the three sides while the fourth side is left open for the rainwater to enter. These catch and conserve rainwater, leading to improved percolation and groundwater recharge. They are very common in most villages of states of [[Haryana]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and the [[Thar desert]] of Rajasthan in India.&lt;ref name=Joh1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Joh2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Joh3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Joh4/&gt;

===Haryana Johads rejuvenation===
[[File:Rithal village hariyana rohtak 0002.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Johad at Rithal village of [[Rohtak district]] of [[Haryana]]]]

In 2007, [[Haryana Irrigation Department]] spent INR435.26 crore (INR4.3 billion or US$7 million) to renovate and restore water bodies in the state for the conservation of water, recharging of ground water, preservation of environment and enhancement of tourism.&lt;ref name=har1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20070507/haryana.htm|title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Haryana|website=www.tribuneindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the [[Panjab University]] found 60 fish species of 19 families, 11 commercial and 6 exotic species, in the water bodies of Haryana.&lt;ref name=har2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060908/haryana.htm#5|title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Haryana|website=www.tribuneindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water bodies remain under risk from encroachment, shrinking of catchment area and pollution.&lt;ref name=har3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20100730/harplus.htm|title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Haryana Plus|website=www.tribuneindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, India's first ever [[diatom]] data basing was done in ten different water bodies at ten different stations in Haryana.&lt;ref name=har4&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lap-publishing.com/catalog/details//store/ru/book/978-3-659-21699-2/diatoms-atlas-of-fresh-waters-bodies-from-haryana-india|title=Diatoms Atlas of Fresh Waters Bodies from Haryana (India) / 978-3-659-21699-2 / 9783659216992 / 3659216992|website=www.lap-publishing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study of 24 water bodies of Haryana, found 39 morphologically different types of diatoms.&lt;ref name=har5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anilaggrawal.com/ij/vol_017_no_001/papers/paper002/Paper.pdf|title=MORPHOLOGICAL STUDY OF DIATOMS IN 24 DIFFERENT WATER BODIES OF HARYANA, INDIA, Journal of Forensic and Texicology, Saini and Kushwaha, 2016, vol 16, number 1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016, the [[Government of Haryana]] announced a plan to map the district-wise map of water flow and to create a database of all water bodies within the state.&lt;ref name=har6&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/haryana-plans-district-wise-maps-of-water-flow-116010600631_1.html|title=Haryana plans district-wise maps of water flow|first=Press Trust of|last=India|date=6 January 2016|publisher=|via=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; These water bodies have contributed to the economic development through fisheries in the landlocked state of Haryana. Haryana ranks second in India in terms of the average annual fish production per unit area in the country with 7000&amp;nbsp;kg per hectare average annual fish production.&lt;ref name=har7&gt;[harfish.gov.in/development-fisheries.htm Haryana fisheries annual production average, July 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Fish production has increased from 600 tonne in 1966-67 at the time of formation of Haryana to 121000 tonnes of fish during the year 2015-16, providing a livelihood to over 30000 families in fisheries sector.&lt;ref name=har8&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harfish.gov.in/haryana-fisheries.htm|title=Haryana fisheries, July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 November 2017, [[Chief Minister of Haryana]] [[Manohar Lal Khattar]] announced that [[Government of Haryana]] will form the [[Haryana State Waterbody Management Board]] &lt;!-- NOTE: Per wiki guidelines, retain limited number of REDLINKS to encourage creation --&gt; to rejuvenate and manage 14,000 ponds in Haryana by digging the silt out every year. This includes development of 50 to 60 lakes in [[National Capital Region (India)|National Capital Region]] falling within the Haryana state.&lt;ref name=HarWater1&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/chandigarh/haryana-to-develop-50-60-small-lakes-water-bodies-in-ncr-manohar-lal-khattar-4918316/ "Haryana to develop 50-60 small lakes, water bodies in NCR: Manohar Lal Khattar"], [[Indian Express]], 1 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HarWater2&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/haryana-to-constitute-pond-management-authority-117110101271_1.html "Haryana to constitute pond management authority "], [[Business Standard]], 1 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rajasthan Johads rejuvenation===
[[File:Rajendra_Singh_interacting_with_Teri_University_Students.JPG|thumb|left|[[Rajendra Singh]], founder of [[Tarun Bharat Sangh]] NGO explaining the use of Johad to the students of [[TERI University]] in [[Alwar district]] of [[Rajasthan]]]]

There was a severe drought in [[Alwar district]] in Rajasthan during 1985-86. In 1985, volunteers from the [[Tarun Bharat Sangh]] (TBS), a voluntary organization led by [[Rajendra Singh]], came to [[Alwar]]. The Alwar District had once thrived, but logging, mining, and other industrial activities resulted in land degradation that intensified flooding and droughts. The traditional water management system using Johads was abandoned. TBS revived the tradition of building Johads, an example of traditional technology that provided water for use and recharging ground water. Now smaller cemented Johads are popularly known as Tankas in most parts of the arid state of Rajasthan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=50 people who could save the planet |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jan/05/activists.ethicalliving |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=January 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unquiet flows the water in this village  |url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/04/15/stories/2005041509000500.htm |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=Apr 15, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The water revolution spread by tanki and johads in the Alwar district has spread far and wide. Now there are around 5,000 johads all over Rajasthan and this has greatly helped in reducing water shortage and improving water quality.

==Similar water bodies==
[[Image:Johad.JPG|thumb|right|View of a ''tanki'' in [[Thathawata]] village in [[Rajasthan]]]]

Following are similar to the Johads but are still distinct types of water bodies with specific differentiating features.

===Tanka===
'''Tanka''' or '''Tanki''' is a rain-fed water storage in the arid areas of the [[Indian subcontinent]], such as [[Rajasthan]], specially in the [[bagar tract]]. 

===Diggi===
'''Diggi''' is a canal-fed [[Waterworks (disambiguation)|water works]] for rural drinking water supply.&lt;ref name=brink1&gt;August 2010, [http://www.indiawaterportal.org/sites/indiawaterportal.org/files/On%20The%20Brink_Water%20Governance_Yamuna%20River%20Basin_Haryana_PEACE_SPWD_2010.pdf On The brink: Water governance in the Yamuna river basin in Haryana], Society for Promotion of Wastelands Development, [http://www.peaceinst.org PEACE Institute Charitable Trust], page vi.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually a purpose-dug open pond, smaller than the typical johad, often concretised to prevent the water loss.

He created the group as "he felt the city needed a [[A Bold Stroke for a Wife#Simon Pure|simon-pure]], amateur gourmet society".{{sfn|Sutton|1953|pp=150-152}} At the black-tie dinners, he functioned as "a cross between a benevolent dictator and a kindly father".
The society was known for its wine stock and for its elaborate dinners,{{sfn|Lang|2005|p=153}}{{sfn|New York Media, LLC|1972|p=71}} initially only for men, but later including the Ladies Dinner.{{sfn|University of Texas at Austin|1995|p=201}} For $250 per year, a member could attend five lavish dinners,{{sfn|University of Texas at Austin|1995|p=201}} and these dinners were attended by some of the wealthiest and most notable men in the world.{{sfn|Avery|2004|p=45}}

The Lucullus Circle dinners brought about a "new golden age of gastronomy", attracting some of the wealthiest businessmen in the world at the time to feast on some "six to eight food courses and two wines with each course".{{Sfn|Avery|2004|p=45}}{{Sfn|Jacobson|2008|p=159}} The third dinner occurred on 10 March 1952 in honor of the Iranian ambassador.{{sfn|University of Texas at Austin|1995|p=201}} At one dinner guests dined on gold dishes with gold knives and forks, while at another, the room was adorned with ''objets d'art'' from important collections.{{sfn|Hines|1955|p=40}} Members came from the arts, business, politics as well as other professions.{{sfn|Heublein, Inc.|1981|p=88}} Many of the members resided at the Waldorf Towers. "Lucullans" were characterized as the "most sensitive and cultivated palates in New York, a sometimes questionable center of civilization and sophistication".{{sfn|Atlantic Monthly Company|1977|p=26}} Numbering approximately 50 gentlemen at a time, the dinner attendees were prohibited from conversing about business, politics, and religion.{{sfn|Lang|2005|p=153}} After the first year, the Lucullus Circle lost only two members, one who died and the other who resigned due to his health.{{sfn|Sutton|1953|pp=150-152}}

By 1972, however the dinners had begun to lose their appeal. ''[[New York Magazine]]'' noted that the dinners were still appreciated for their "enormous stocks of wine". but that it no longer seemed to "have the appeal of the other groups".&lt;ref name="LLC1972"&gt;{{cite book|title=New York Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HecCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA71|date=23 October 1972|publisher=New York Media, LLC|page=71|issn=0028-7369}}&lt;/ref&gt; They nonetheless continued. After Philippe's death, his wife, Helga, took over planning the gentlemen's dinners, as well as coordinating the wines and greeting the attendees; she was the only woman present at these events.{{sfn|Avery|2004|p=45}}

==Abuse==
Michele suffered multiple injuries to the chest and back, a broken nose, burns on her skin, and a broken arm before the age of four at the hands of her stepmother, Mary Rae. These led to over 20 visits to a hospital, including one in which she was hospitalized for a month.&lt;ref name="HeraldScotland"&gt;{{cite news|title=Step-daughter died in 1961 Scots motheradmits killing child|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12250369.Step_daughter_died_in_1961_Scots_motheradmits_killing_child/|accessdate=14 April 2017|work=HeraldScotland|publisher=Herald &amp; Times Group|date=29 October 1998|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
On August 9, 1961, Mary held Michele under water and stomped her violently, believing that the child had lied about something. These actions were seen by Michele's older brother, George. At dinner, Michele threw up [[blood clot]]s.&lt;ref name="Seattle Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stepmother Charged In 1961 Death {{!}} Seattle Times Newspaper|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19961208&amp;slug=2363605|accessdate=14 April 2017|work=Associated Press|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=8 December 1996|location=BELLEVILLE, Ill.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day she died of her internal injuries. An autopsy was conducted by the pathologist at the [[army base]] where the Morgans lived, and the cause of death was found to be massive trauma to the chest.

The autopsy report was not completed until 15 years later, when the coroner listed the cause of death as [[pneumonia]].

The local prosecutor never pursued the case.

==Disclosure==
In 1996, George Morgan (Michele's older brother) was serving time in prison for [[rape]]. That year, he decided to research his family [[genealogy]] and was surprised when he saw his sister's [[death certificate]]. He recalled the circumstances surrounding her death and was certain that it was not caused by pneumonia — and that it had occurred in 1961, not in 1976.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman Charged in 1961 Slaying of 4-Year-Old Stepdaughter|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1996/Woman-Charged-in-1961-Slaying-of-4-Year-Old-Stepdaughter/id-81af734ab5404dc091e709a71f94b036|accessdate=14 April 2017|work=www.apnewsarchive.com|publisher=Associated Press|date=21 October 1998|location=BELLEVILLE, ILL|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan then corresponded with County [[Coroner]] Rick Stone and disclosed to him how Michele's death really occurred. Stone subsequently reopened the case and Michele's body was [[Exhumation|exhumed]]. Though the body had been buried for over 30 years, it still showed the marks of brutal child abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=HUNDSDORFER|first1=BETH|title=Rick Stone, St. Clair County coroner since 1984, dies {{!}} Belleville News-Democrat|url=http://www.bnd.com/news/local/article114375528.html|accessdate=14 April 2017|work=www.bnd.com|date=12 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators discovered the original autopsy report and Michele's hospital record, which showed multiple visits.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune 1"&gt;{{cite news|title=After 35 Years, Stepmother Charged In Murder Of Girl, 4|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-12-08/news/9612080221_1_stepmother-mary-morgan-exhumed|accessdate=14 April 2017|work=From Tribune News Services.|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=8 December 1996|location=BELLEVILLE, ILLINOIS|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Morgan's claims were thus substantiated.

==Prosecution==
Mary Morgan was tracked down in [[West Columbia, Texas]], and initially denied the allegations leveled against her. She then attempted to flee the country but was caught and placed under arrest. She eventually pleaded guilty to [[involuntary manslaughter]] and was sentenced to five years in prison and was released in 2001.

In the years after Michele's death, Mary raised four children. Hospital records showed that the four of them had collectively visited the hospital over 150 times for medical care before the age of five.

== Personal life==
Murray Jarvik was born in [[New York City]] on June 1, 1923.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He was the son of Minnie (Haas) and Jacob Jarvik, an [[upholsterer]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?n=murray-e-jarvik&amp;pid=109390365|title=Murray E. Jarvik's Obituary on Los Angeles Times|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jarvik suffered from lifelong heart problems, which began with a severe case of [[rheumatic fever]] when he was twelve years old.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He later developed [[polio]] at the age of 28 and was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] in 1992, which was cured.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He was never a [[Smoking|smoker]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Jarvik received his undergraduate [[bachelor's degree]] at the [[City College of New York]] before earning his [[master's degree]] in science at [[U.C.L.A.]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He received his [[doctorate]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and his [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]] from the [[University of California, San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

He was married to his wife, Dr. Lissy Feingold Jarvik, for 53 years, and the couple had two sons.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news |first=Thomas|last=Maugh II|title=Dr. Murray E. Jarvik, 84; UCLA pharmacologist invented nicotine patch

Roosevelt Administration|Roosevelt Administration]] during the time of the [[Holocaust]]. His nephew [[Robert Jarvik]] developed an [[artificial heart]] called [[Jarvik-7]].&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

== Nicotine patch ==
Murray Jarvik began research into the [[absorption (skin)|absorption]] of [[tobacco]] contents through the [[Human skin|skin]] and its effects on the [[human body]].&lt;ref name=iht/&gt; His initial exploration into this field began by studying [[farmers]] and [[farmhand]]s in the [[American South]] who harvest tobacco by hand for a living.&lt;ref name=iht/&gt;

However, Jarvik and his colleague, then UCLA [[postdoctoral]] [[fellow]] [[Jed Rose (scientist)|Jed Rose]], could not get approval to conduct their research into tobacco absorption through the skin on human subjects.&lt;ref name=iht/&gt; Instead, Jarvik and Rose began testing the effects of absorption of tobacco contents on themselves.&lt;ref name=iht/&gt; The effects of the tobacco was immediately measurable. In an interview with [[UCLA Magazine]], Jarvik remembered, "We put the tobacco on our skin and waited to see what would happen. Our [[heart rate]]s increased, [[adrenaline]] began pumping, all the things that happen to smokers."&lt;ref name=iht/&gt;

Jarvik and Rose's research led to their invention of the [[nicotine patch]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=iht/&gt; The nicotine patch is a [[transdermal patch]] that delivers [[nicotine]] directly through the [[Human skin|skin]] and into the body to alleviate the urge to smoke and, hopefully, ultimately [[quit smoking]].&lt;ref name=iht/&gt; (Rose now serves as the [[Board of directors|director]] of the Center for Nicotine and Smoking Cessation Research at [[Duke University]].)&lt;ref name=iht/&gt;

The nicotine patch became available by [[Medical prescription|prescription]] for [[smoking cessation]] in the [[United States]] in 1992.&lt;ref name=iht/&gt; The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved its sale as an [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] treatment in 1996.&lt;ref name=iht/&gt;

'''Occupational epidemiology''' is a subdiscipline of [[epidemiology]] that focuses on investigations of workers and the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/occupationalepidemiology/index.html|title=Occupational Epidemiology|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Research Methods in Occupational Epidemiology|last=Checkoway|first=Harvey|last2=Pearce|first2=Neil|last3=Kriebel|first3=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-19-509242-2|location=New York, NY|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational epidemiologic studies examine health outcomes among workers, and their potential association with conditions in the workplace including noise, chemicals, heat, or radiation, or work organization such as schedules.

The need for evidence to inform occupational safety regulations, [[workers' compensation]] programs, and safety legislation motivated the development of public health policy, occupational epidemiology methods, and surveillance mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halperin|first=William|last2=Howard|first2=John|date=2011-10-07|title=Occupational Epidemiology and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6004a15.htm|journal=[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]]|publisher=U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|volume=60|pages=97–103|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Occupational epidemiological research can inform [[risk assessment]]s; development of standards and other risk management activities; and estimates of the co-benefits and co-harms of policies designed to reduce risk factors or conditions that can affect human health. Occupational epidemiology methods are common to methods used in [[environmental epidemiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pell|first=S.|date=May 1993|title=Epidemiologists in industry. Past achievements, unexplored opportunities, and future needs|journal=Journal of Occupational Medicine|volume=35|issue=5|pages=485–492|issn=0096-1736|pmid=8515320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Occupational hazard]]s have long been recognized. For example, [[Hippocrates]] recommended other physicians consider patients' vocational backgrounds when diagnosing and treating disease, and [[Bernardino Ramazzini]] in 1700 outlined many occupational diseases in his book ''De Morbis Artificum''.  There are several examples from the 19th century onwards of hazard recognition proceeding to systematic epidemiology studies.  In one example, premature mortality was reported among gold and silver miners in the [[Ore Mountains|Erz Mountains]] in Germany as early as the 16th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It was initially though to be the result of [[Tuberculosis|consumption]], but it was subsequently determined to be [[silicosis]], and studies from 1879 through the 1930s uncovered the association of miners' deaths with [[lung cancer]] and nonmalignant [[respiratory disease]]s.  Other examples include cancer among chimney sweeps, [[asbestos]]-related diseases, and the variety of occupational diseases found among factory workers in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Occupational health risks were initially observed by [[case series]] reports of apparent disease excesses or [[Disease cluster|clusters]].  Although the [[case series]] approach provided a good indicator of [[occupational hazard]]s, they are not adequate on their own to assess a wide spectrum of health outcomes that may not be closely related to workplace exposure. The development of retrospective, [[Cohort study|cohort design]] allowed for a more comprehensive study of the cases. Desire to improve the cost-efficiency of studies led to the use of [[Case-control study|case-control studies]]. Other methods later used in occupational epidemiology include [[Cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]] and [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/610965808|title=Research methods in occupational epidemiology|last=Checkoway|first=Harvey|last2=Pearce|first2=Neil|last3=Crawford-Brown|first3=Douglas J.|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=|year=1989|isbn=9780195092424|location=New York|pages=5–8, 59, 61, 66, 72, 331|oclc=610965808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of studies ==

=== Case series ===
Typically occupational epidemiological investigations begin with the observation of an unusual number of cases of disease among a group of workers. When the investigation does not go further than what is referred to as identifying a [[disease cluster]], the study is referred to as a [[case series]] report.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Cohort studies ===
In a [[Cohort study|cohort design study]], a [[Population (statistics)|population]], or cohort, of workers is compared to a [[Treatment and control groups|control group]] that was not exposed to the [[Occupational hazard|workplace hazards]] being investigated. This type of study is the most accepted in the [[scientific community]] because it most closely follows experimental strategy and observes the entire population rather than a sample. In a prospective cohort study, the group examined at the time of the study is compared to a follow up with the same group in the future. The historical cohort study design begins with defining a cohort at a time in the past and following the cohort over historical time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agius.com/hew/resource/occepi.htm|title=Occupational Epidemiology|last=Agius|first=Raymond|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Case-control studies ===
Case-control studies compare the past exposure of cases with the disease to the past exposure of cases that did not have the disease. Because [[Cohort study|cohort studies]] require the entire [[Population (statistics)|population]], [[Case-control study|case-control studies]] are a more cost-effective approach, using only the sample of workers with the disease to compare to a control.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Cross-sectional studies ===
A typical [[cross-sectional study]] involves the comparison of varying degrees of exposure and the prevalence of disease, symptoms, or physiological status. The main advantage of cross-sectional studies is that they allow collection of data on conditions which would not be recorded normally because other study designs focus on severe states of disease. This is also the biggest shortcoming of this study type because by using prevalence rather than incidence it cannot be used to make a causal inference.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Application ==
By contributing to reduction in exposure, occupational epidemiology helps reduce health risks among workers. Using occupational epidemiological methods can also have benefits for society at large. For example, recommendations for [[Occupational exposure limit|exposure limits]] to [[benzene]] developed by the [[Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards]] were based on occupational epidemiology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Using [[meta-analysis]], many occupational epidemiology studies can be synthesized in order to help set [[occupational exposure limit]]s and make other kinds of policy decisions. This can also can be applied in health [[risk assessment]]s, which is a method of predicting health risk based on hypothetical exposure conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and the Improvement of Mental Health Care'''  ('''MI Principles''') were adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1991. They provide agreed but non-legally-binding basic standards that mental health systems should meet and rights that people diagnosed with [[mental disorder]] should have. Although the document underwent extensive drafting for 20 years and remains the international human rights agreement most specifically concerned with mental health, it has been criticised{{by whom|date=September 2017}} for not offering stronger protections in some areas. It should now be read in the context of the United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalmentalhealth.org/resources/principles-protection-persons-mental-illness-mi-principles&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 25 principles:
* Fundamental freedoms and basic rights
* Protection of minors
* Life in the community
* Determination of mental illness
* Medical examination
* Confidentiality
* Role of community and culture
* Standards of care
* Treatment
* Medication
* Consent to treatment
* Notice of rights
* Rights and conditions in mental health facilities
* Resources for mental health facilities
* Admission principles
* Involuntary admission
* Review body
* Procedural safeguards
* Access to information
* Criminal offenders
* Complaints
* Monitoring and remedies
* Implementation
* Scope of principles relating to mental health facilities
* Saving of existing rights

The PRR will typically be calculated using a surveillance database in which reports of adverse events from a variety of drugs are recorded.
  
A PRR greater than 1 suggests that the adverse event is more commonly reported for individuals taking the drug of interest, relative to the comparison drugs.  This could indicate that the adverse event is caused by the drug of interest and therefore a "side effect", although a PRR exceeding 1 could also reflect sampling variation in the data, reporting errors, biased reporting, multiple reports of the same case or the same patient, or a number of other causes.

The PRR is defined as the ratio between the frequency with which a specific adverse event is reported for the drug of interest (relative to all adverse events reported for the drug) and the frequency with which the same adverse event is reported for all drugs in the comparison group (relative to all adverse events for drugs in the comparison group).  For example, suppose that [[nausea]] was reported 83 times for a given drug of interest, out of 1356 adverse events reported for the drug.  Thus the proportion of adverse events of nausea for this drug is 83/1356 = 0.061.  Suppose that we wish to compare the drug of interest to a class of drugs, for which nausea was reported as an adverse event 1489 times, out of 53789 total adverse events reported for drugs in the class.  Thus, nausea was reported with proportion 1489 / 53789 = 0.028 for the class of drugs.  The PRR in this case is 0.061 / 0.028 = 2.18.  This tells us that nausea was reported more than twice as frequently (among all adverse event reports) for the drug of interest compared to drugs in the comparison group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17160">A '''rectal microbicide''' is a [[microbicide]] for [[Rectum|rectal]] use.  Most commonly such a product would be a [[topical]] gel inserted into the [[anus]] so that it make act as protection against the contract of a [[sexually transmitted infection]] during [[anal sex]].

Along with [[vaginal microbicide]]s, rectal microbicides are currently the subject of medical research on [[microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases]] to determine the circumstances under which and the extent to which they provide protection against infection.

Less commonly, rectal microbicides can have other purposes also; for example, they could be used to treat certain medical conditions as a [[suppository]] would.

==History==
Early development of topical microbicides starting around 1998 focused on preventing of HIV transmission during vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref name="newfocus"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McGowan | first1 = I. | title = Rectal microbicides: A new focus for HIV prevention | doi = 10.1136/sti.2008.031328 | journal = Sexually Transmitted Infections | volume = 84 | issue = 6 | pages = 413–417 | year = 2008 | pmid =  19028937| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The entire field lacks a [[proof of concept]] that a vaginal microbicide exists.&lt;ref name="newfocus"/&gt;  As of 2008, 16 topical microbicides entered phase I or II [[clinical trial]] and 7 advanced to an additional trial.&lt;ref name="newfocus"/&gt; Previous studies both showed promise in new areas of research and gave disappointing results from the first generation products, as surfactants like [[nonoxynol-9]] and entry inhibitors like [[carrageenan]] showed no efficacy in preventing HIV and were associated with risk of inflammation which raised the risk of contracting HIV in some circumstances.&lt;ref name="newfocus"/&gt;

In 1998 researchers noted that gay men using products containing nonoxynol-9 as part of their infection prevention strategy despite lack of evidence of efficacy or any safety data for that practice.&lt;ref name="needed"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Michael Gross |author2=Susan Buchbinder |author3=Connie Celum |author4=Patrick Heagerty |author5=George R. Seage III|title=Rectal Microbicides for U.S. Gay Men: Are Clinical Trials Needed? Are They Feasible?|journal=Sexually Transmitted Diseases:|date=July 1998|volume=25|issue=6|pages=296–302|doi=10.1097/00007435-199807000-00005|authorlink2=Susan Buchbinder }}&lt;/ref&gt;   At the time, the drug was under evaluation as a vaginal microbicide.&lt;ref name="needed"/&gt;

Because of expected similarities between the efficacy of vaginal and rectal microbicides, some researchers have called for all vaginal microbicides to be tested for efficacy when used rectally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McGowan | first1 = I. | last2 = Anton | first2 = P. | doi = 10.1097/COH.0b013e32830891cf | title = Rectal microbicides | journal = Current Opinion in HIV and AIDS | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 593–598 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19373027 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
There are two fundamental reasons to research and develop rectal microbicides for HIV prevention:
	
*Anal intercourse is a normal human behavior and is practiced the world over by an estimated five to ten percent of men, women, and transgender people with both heterosexual and same-sex partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Microbicide Trials Network |title=Rectal Microbicides: Fact Sheet |url=http://www.mtnstopshiv.org/node/2864 |location=Pittsburgh, PA |publisher=Microbicide Trials Network |accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An act of unprotected anal intercourse is ten to twenty times more likely to result in HIV infection compared to an act of unprotected vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Heterosexual Transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus: Variability of Infectivity Throughout the Course of Infection |journal=American Journal of Epidemiology |year=1998 |volume=148 |series=European Study Group on Heterosexual Transmission of HIV |issue=1 |pages=88–96 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009564 |pmid=9663408 |last1=Leynaert |first1=B. |last2=Downs |first2=A. M. |last3=de Vincenzi |first3=I.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Per-Contact Risk of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Transmission Between Male Sexual Partners |journal=American Journal of Epidemiology |year=1999 |volume=150 |issue=3 |pages=306–311 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a010003 |pmid=10430236 |last1=Vitinghoff |first1=E. |last2=Douglas |first2=J. |last3=Judon |first3=F. |last4=McKiman |first4=D. |last5=MacQueen |first5=K. |last6=Buchinder |first6=S. P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that unprotected anal intercourse plays a significant role in the HIV pandemic.
	
Concerted advocacy for the research and development of safe, effective, acceptable and accessible rectal microbicides began in 2005, when [[International Rectal Microbicide Advocates]] was founded with colleagues representing the [[AIDS Foundation of Chicago]], the [[Canadian AIDS Society]], the [[Community HIV/AIDS Mobilization Program]], and the [[Global Campaign for Microbicides]].

The political and sociocultural context reinforced the dismissal of rectal microbicides. Pervasive homophobia across the globe has resulted in a lack of adequate attention and resources devoted to gay men and other men who have sex with men (MSM) despite the disproportional HIV burden borne by this population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authors=amfAR and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health |title=Achieving an AIDS-Free Generation for Gay Men and Other MSM: Financing and Implementation of HIV Programs Targeting MSM |url=http://www.amfar.org/uploadedFiles/_amfar.org/In_The_Community/Publications/MSM-GlobalRept2012.pdf |accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few knew, or acknowledged, that anal intercourse is a widespread practice among heterosexuals, both men and women, gay men and other MSM, as well as transgender people. Thus, evidence-free assumptions relegated the rectal portion of the microbicide field to a small, dark corner.
	
The field has moved from simply being an adjunct to vaginal studies to a force in its own right. This is due to a handful of visionary, passionate, and dogged scientists; funding from the United States (which has supported approximately 97% of all rectal microbicide research); and growing community engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=IRMA |title=Safety of Lubricants for Rectal Use: Questions &amp; Answers for HIV Educators and Advocates |url=http://www.rectalmicrobicides.org/docs/Lube%20safety%20Q&amp;A%20FINAL%20Oct%2013.pdf |accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

===Preclinical testing===
Preclinical testing for rectal microbicides has been conducted in [[macaques]] to get a nonhuman primate model of drug behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Patton | first1 = D. L. | last2 = Sweeney | first2 = Y. T. C. | last3 = Paul | first3 = K. J. | doi = 10.1097/OLQ.0b013e318195c31a | title = A Summary of Preclinical Topical Microbicide Rectal Safety and Efficacy Evaluations in a Pigtailed Macaque Model | journal = Sexually Transmitted Diseases | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 350–356 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19556929 | pmc =2749653 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UC-781 trial===
Scientists working on the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA's) Microbicide Development Program initiated the first Phase I RM safety trial, investing the safety and acceptability of UC-781, in December 2006. Rectal application of UC-781 gel, a potent antiretroviral (ARV) drug, was shown to be safe and acceptable to the 36 men and women in the trial. Phase I trials normally focus solely on safety and acceptability, but researchers used a novel approach in this trial: taking rectal tissue biopsies from participants and exposing them to HIV ex vivo in the laboratory. The drug significantly reduced HIV transmission in these essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anton, Saunders, Elliot, Khanukhova|title=First Phase 1 Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Rectal Microbicide Trial Using UC781 Gel with a Novel Index of Ex Vivo Efficacy|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2011|volume=6|issue=9|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023243 |displayauthors=etal|pages=e23243|pmid=21969851|pmc=3182160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RMP-02/MTN-006===
RMP-02/MTN-006 Tested the same vaginal formulation of tenofovir gel that reduced HIV acquisition by an estimated 39 percent overall in the CAPRISA (Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research) 004 trial that was conducted in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karim, Karim, Frohlich, Grobler|title=Effectiveness and Safety of Tenofovir Gel, an Antiretroviral Microbicide, for the Prevention of HIV Infection in Women|journal=Science|year=2010|volume=329|issue=5996|pages=1168–1174|doi=10.1126/science.1193748|pmid=20643915|pmc=3001187|displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, 18 men and women began enrolling in the trial, which was sponsored by the Microbicide Trials Network (MTN) and UCLA’s Microbicide Development Program. The study tested the safety and acceptability of single- and multiple-day rectal applications of tenofovir, a single oral dose of tenofovir, and a placebo.
	
Laboratory tests showed that HIV was significantly inhibited in rectal tissue samples from participants who applied tenofovir gel to their rectums daily for one week compared to tissue from those who used a placebo gel. Although a slight anti-HIV effect was noted in tissue from participants who applied a single dose of tenofovir gel, the finding was not statistically significant. The single dose of oral tenofovir did not provide any protection against HIV in rectal tissue samples. The study also discovered that only 25 percent of the participants liked tenofovir gel, compared to 50 percent who had used the placebo gel. Some individuals who used tenofovir gel experienced gastrointestinal distress, cramps, and diarrhea. Results were presented at the 18th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, or CROI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Anton and McGowan|title=RMP-02/MTN-006: A Phase 1 Placebo-controlled Trial of Rectally Applied 1% Vaginal TFV Gel with Comparison to Oral TDF|conference=18th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MTN-007===
MTN-007 studied a reformulated version of the tenofovir gel. Researchers retained the same concentration of tenofovir (one percent), but reduced the glycerin in the gel in an attempt to make it more acceptable and “rectal friendly.” This Phase I safety and acceptability study, launched in October 2011, included 65 men and women from three sites in the United States. Results were presented at the 19th CROI in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=McGowan, Hoesley, Janocko|title=MTN-007: A Phase 1 Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Rectal Safety and Acceptability Study of Tenofovir 1% Gel|conference=19th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reduced glycerin formulation of 1 percent tenofovir gel was found to be safe and acceptable. Researchers recommended advancing this candidate to Phase II.

MTN-017, the follow-up to MTN-007, represented a major milestone: the first Phase II expanded safety and acceptability study of an RM. The trial was officially launched in October 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title = Researchers Launch First-Ever Phase II Safety Study of a Rectal Microbicide to Prevent HIV|publisher = Microbicide Trials Network|date = 2 October 2013|url = http://www.mtnstopshiv.org/node/5193|access-date = 15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at sites in the United States, Peru, Thailand, and South Africa. The 195 gay men, other MSM, and transgender women recruited into MTN-017 more than doubled the total number of human beings who have participated in RM clinical trials to date, and the trial was also the first to include participants from countries outside of the United States.
	
The study investigated the safety and acceptability of the reduced glycerin tenofovir gel and directly compared acceptability and adherence to daily oral [[Emtricitabine/tenofovir|Truvada]]. MTN-017 featured an open-label, crossover design in which each individual followed three different regimens, each lasting eight weeks. One regimen consisted of the participant applying the gel to the rectum daily. A second regimen asked participants to apply the gel rectally before and after anal intercourse. In the third regimen, participants took oral Truvada every day. The order in which participants followed the study regimens was assigned randomly, with a break between each regimen.
	
The procedures carried out as part of MTN-017 determined how much of each drug is absorbed in blood, rectal fluid, and tissue, and also assessed any changes in cells or tissue. Study participants were asked about any side effects, what they liked and disliked about using the gel either daily or with sex, and whether they would consider using the gel in the future. Gel acceptability and adherence were directly compared to oral Truvada, which has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition in a number of studies among different populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant, Lama, Anderson, McMahan|title=Preexposure Chemoprophylaxis for HIV Prevention in Men Who Have Sex with Men|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|year=2010|volume=363|issue=27|pages=2587–2599|doi=10.1056/nejmoa1011205|pmid=21091279|author2=and others|displayauthors=1|first1=Robert M.|last3=Anderson|first3=Peter L.|last4=McMahan|first4=Vanessa|last5=Liu|first5=Albert Y.|last6=Vargas|first6=Lorena|last7=Goicochea|first7=Pedro|last8=Casapía|first8=Martín|last9=Guanira-Carranza|first9=Juan Vicente|last10=Ramirez-Cardich|first10=Maria E.|last11=Montoya-Herrera|first11=Orlando|last12=Fernández|first12=Telmo|last13=Veloso|first13=Valdilea G.|last14=Buchbinder|first14=Susan P.|last15=Chariyalertsak|first15=Suwat|last16=Schechter|first16=Mauro|last17=Bekker|first17=Linda-Gail|last18=Mayer|first18=Kenneth H.|last19=Kallás|first19=Esper Georges|last20=Amico|first20=K.

==Use==
Rectal microbicides can reduce the risk of transmission of HIV during anal intercourse, particularly during sex when condoms are not used.&lt;ref name="newfocus"/&gt;

==Culture==
Research into rectal microbicides and funding for exploring their use as public health tools has faced barriers historically because of the [[taboo]] in discussing anal health and anal sex.&lt;ref name="POZ2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Straube|first=Trenton|title=The Anal Dialogues|journal=[[POZ (magazine)|POZ]]| date=July–August 2011 |url=http://www.poz.com/articles/Microbicides_Anal_HIV_2634_20673.shtml|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Researchers have reported feeling disinclined to request funding for "anal research" because of biases against anything to do with an anus, and public policy writers have at times faced opposition to promoting discussion on anal topics.&lt;ref name="POZ2011"/&gt;

==Future==
Scientists at the Population Council are trying to develop a microbicide that would be both safe and effective in either the vagina or the rectum. They have conducted early work on a combination product containing MIV-150 (an investigational ARV), zinc acetate, and carrageenan gel. Further evaluation of this combination is dependent on funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pickett|first=Jim|title=Ready, Set, Rectal Microbicides: An Update on Rectal Microbicide Research and Advocacy|journal=AIDSTAR-One Spotlight on Prevention|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education has been identified as a common social vaccine against contracting HIV, resulting in the more educated less likely to be infected. Accurate information of health risks suggests a negative linear relationship between years of education and HIV infection rate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Baker, David Multiple Effects of Education on Disease: The Intriguing Case of HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] Director-General made a statement during 2011 [[World AIDS Day]], identifying education as one of the three primary concerns, and urging for it to become a full-fledged priority. By implementing educational policies, UNESCO aims to make sure all individuals, in and out of formal education, have access to comprehensive HIV education.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/resources/online-materials/single-view/news/flying_the_flag_for_hiv_and_aids_education/#.UyITMvldUuc&lt;/ref&gt; Improving the education of HIV/AIDS has become a growing concern, with 1 in 4 students aged 16 and above stating they had learned nothing about HIV/AIDS in school during a Sex Education Forum survey in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncb.org.uk/media/333229/young_people_experiences_of_hiv_and_aids.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207183451/http://www.ncb.org.uk/media/333229/young_people_experiences_of_hiv_and_aids.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concerns are further stressed since learning about sexually transmitted diseases is the only aspect of sex education that is compulsory for all secondary schools in England and Wales.

==Availability of information==

Education is a strong factor in improving population health by building in individuals the capacity to process and understand risks related to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Adversely, poor information hinders individuals from analyzing their behavioural choices by masking potential health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pop.psu.edu/news/2012/the-causal-effect-of-education-on-population-dynamics |title=Population Research Institute |publisher=Pop.psu.edu |date=2017-08-10 |accessdate=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inadequate information becomes a risk factor for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. The mischaracterization of HIV/AIDS as a homosexual disease has led higher status heterosexuals that participate in risky sexual behaviour to continue without considering the risk of infection.&lt;ref&gt;Glover, Ryan; Wiseman, Alexander: The Impact of HIV/AIDS on Education Worldwide&lt;/ref&gt; Education is important in the growth of adolescent reasoning, as having less prior knowledge shows a compulsion to construct reality based on recent experiences.

Data analysis collected in Sydney, Australia in 2007 found that within 236 adults, age 20 to 65, respondents were concerned about risks of HIV/AIDS transmitted through casual contact, leading to disapproval of homosexuality and drug use. In contrast, highly educated respondents were shown to be less likely to overestimate the possibility of HIV transmission through casual contact compared to respondents with a lower level education.&lt;ref&gt;Hosseinzadeh, Hassan: Functional Analysis of HIV/AIDS Stigma: Consensus or Divergence?&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudinal changes==

Negative attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS stem from misconceptions regarding the disease. Georgian sex workers were found to be highly lacking knowledge, with only 61% knowing that a healthy-looking person can be infected, and 44% thinking one can get HIV from a mosquito bite. Only 64% think that using condoms for every sexual act can reduce the risk of HIV.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;The World Bank: Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behavior Related To HIV/AIDS Among Transport Sector Workers: A Case Study of Georgia.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sex workers in Georgia who were interviewed regarding people living with HIV/AIDS were found to have negative attitudes towards infected individuals. Only 25% thought a teacher who is HIV-positive should be allowed to continue teaching, and only 25% would buy food from an infected vendor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Stigma associated with those who have HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa prevents many from getting tested. The relation predicts, as formal education continues to change attitudes towards those living with HIV/AIDS, the reduction of stigma enhances prevention techniques.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Cognitive abilities==

As cognitive abilities are built, individuals become more motivated and develop a capacity to absorb more accurate information. Over half of English students agree that teaching about HIV/AIDS should start between 11 and 13 years old, while just under one third believe between 14 and 16 is the best age to learn about sexual education.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the introduction of partially accurate information in Sub-Saharan Africa led to a decline in HIV rates among more educated, suggesting they may have the greater cognitive skill required to sift through the various levels of accuracy and mount a more effective response.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Increased motivation needed to analyze personal risks and behavioural choices were increased by cognitive abilities enhanced by formal education, suggesting a direct correlation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Africa ==
The result in a shortage of teaching materials and inadequate capacities in the teaching of HIV and AIDS and life skills education.In addition, it was found that HIV and AIDS are highly stigmatized, colleges are ill equipped with health facilities, and national policies on condom use are ambiguous. The report presents a discussion of these and other issues, and makes policy and programmatic recommendations for strengthening the response of teacher training colleges to HIV and AIDS.
HIV/AIDS affects the economics of both individuals and countries.The gross domestic product of the most affected countries has decreased due to the lack of human capital.Without proper nutrition, health care and medicine, large numbers of people die from AIDS-related complications. They will not only be unable to work, but will also require significant medical care. It is estimated that as of 2007 there where 12 million Many are cared for by elderly grandparents.
By affecting mainly young adults, AIDS reduces the taxable population, in turn reducing the resources available for public expenditures such as education and health services not related to AIDS resulting in increasing pressure for the state's finances and slower growth of the economy. This causes a slower growth of the tax base, an effect that is reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating the sick, training (to replace sick workers), sick pay and caring for AIDS orphans. This is especially true if the sharp increase in adult mortality shifts the responsibility and blame from the family to the government in caring for these orphans.
At the household level, AIDS results in both the loss of income but also increased spending on healthcare. A study in [[Côte d'Ivoire]] showed that households with an [[HIV/AIDS]] patient, spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households.&lt;ref name="WBank"&gt;{{

 journal=The World Bank | year=1992

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This additional expenditure also leaves less income to spend on education and other personal or family investment.

==Critique==

Studies of the effectiveness of HIV education programs often rely on self-reported information about knowledge and behavior, leading to a possible social desirability bias if subjects report what they think the interviewer wants to think&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 
Encouraging Kenyan students to write essays on way of protecting oneself against HIV/AIDS led to increased self-reported use of condoms without an increase in self-reported sexual activity. There is no evidence to determine whether an increase in condom use by students corresponds to actual reduction in HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Early findings adversely identified formal education as a risk factor (with the more educated individuals being most likely to be infected). As wealthier individuals are usually more educated, the risk of many of these individuals was accompanied by the presence of formal wealth as a risk factor. Twenty years into the pandemic, education began to shift from risk factor to social vaccine.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The '''Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012''' (Republic Act No. 10354), informally known as the '''Reproductive Health Law''' or '''RH Law''', is a [[law]] in the [[Philippines]], which guarantees universal access to methods on [[contraception]], fertility control, [[sexual education]], and maternal care.

While there is general agreement about its provisions on maternal and child health, there is great debate on its mandate that the Philippine government and the private sector will fund and undertake widespread distribution of family planning devices such as [[condoms]], [[birth control pill]]s, and [[IUD]]s, as the government continues to disseminate information on their use through all health care centers.

Passage of the legislation was controversial and highly divisive, with tambays, academics, religious institutions, and major political figures declaring their support or opposition while it was pending in the legislature. Heated debates and rallies both supporting and opposing the RH Bill took place nationwide.

The Supreme Court delayed implementation of the law in March 2013 in response to challenges. On April 3,2014, the Court ruled that the law was "not unconstitutional" but struck down eight provisions partially or in full.&lt;ref name="Rappler1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/54946-supreme-court-rh-law-constitutional | title=SC declares RH law constitutional | work=[[Rappler]] | date=April 8, 2014 | accessdate=April 8, 2014 | author=Bernal, Buena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate Policy Brief titled "Promoting Reproductive Health", the history of reproductive health in the Philippines dates back to 1967 when leaders of 12 countries including the Philippines' [[Ferdinand Marcos]] signed the Declaration on Population.&lt;ref name="declaration" /&gt;&lt;ref name=delosreyes02 /&gt; The Philippines agreed that the population problem should be considered as the principal element for long-term economic development. Thus, the Population Commission was created to push for a lower family size norm and provide information and services to lower fertility rates.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

Starting 1967, the [[USAID]] began shouldering 80% of the total family planning commodities (contraceptives) of the country, which amounted to $3 million annually. In 1975, the United States adopted as its policy the [[National Security Study Memorandum 200]]: Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests (NSSM200). The policy gives "paramount importance" to population control measures and the promotion of contraception among 13 populous countries, including the Philippines to control rapid population growth which they deem to be inimical to the sociopolitical national interests of the United States, since the "U.S. economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad", and these countries can produce destabilizing opposition forces against the United States. It recommends the U.S. leadership to "influence national leaders" and that "improved world-wide support for population-related efforts should be sought through increased emphasis on mass media and other population education and motivation programs by the UN, USIA, and USAID.&lt;ref name=nssm200 /&gt;

Different presidents had different points of emphasis. President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] pushed for a systematic distribution of contraceptives all over the country, a policy that was called "coercive", by its leading administrator.&lt;ref name=delosreyes02 /&gt; The [[Cory Aquino|Corazon Aquino]] administration focused on giving couples the right to have the number of children they prefer, while [[Fidel V. Ramos]] shifted from population control to population management. [[Joseph Estrada]] used mixed methods of reducing fertility rates, while [[Rvee Jude A. Olandsca]] focused on mainstreaming [[natural family planning]], while stating that contraceptives are openly sold in the country.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

In 1989, the Philippine Legislators’ Committee on Population and Development (PLCPD) was established, "dedicated to the formulation of viable public policies requiring legislation on population management and socio-economic development".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} In 2000, the Philippines signed the [[Millennium Declaration]] and committed to attain the MDGs by 2015, including promoting [[gender equality]] and health. In 2003 USAID started its phase out of a 33-year-old program by which free contraceptives were given to the country. Aid recipients such as the Philippines faced the challenge to fund its own contraception program. In 2004 the Department of Health introduced the Philippines Contraceptive Self-Reliance Strategy, arranging for the replacement of these donations with domestically provided contraceptives.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

In August 2010, the government announced a collaborative work with the USAID in implementing a comprehensive marketing and communications strategy in favor of family planning called ''May Plano Sila''.

==== Summary of major provisions ====
The bill mandates the government to "promote, without biases, all effective natural and modern methods of family planning that are medically safe and legal."&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://politics.inquirer.net/politics/view/20110131-317656/RH-bill-OKd-at-House-committee-level |title=RH bill OK’d at House committee level |last1=Dalangin-Fernandez |first1=Lira |date=1 February 2011 |work=politics.inquirer.net |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although abortion is recognized as illegal and punishable by law, the bill states that “the government shall ensure that all women needing care for post-abortion complications shall be treated and counseled in a humane, non-judgmental and compassionate manner”.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

The bill calls for a "multi-dimensional approach" integrates a component of family planning and responsible parenthood into all government anti-poverty programs.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt; Age-appropriate reproductive health and sexuality education is required from grade five to fourth year high school using "life-skills and other approaches."&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

The bill also mandates the [[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|Department of Labor and Employment]] to guarantee the reproductive health rights of its female employees. Companies with fewer than 200 workers are required to enter into partnership with health care providers in their area for the delivery of reproductive health services.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

Employers with more than 200 employees shall provide reproductive health services to all employees in their own respective health facilities. Those with fewer than 200 workers shall enter into partnerships with health professionals for the delivery of reproductive health services. Employers shall inform employees of the availability of family planning. They are also obliged to monitor pregnant working employees among their workforce and ensure they are provided paid half-day prenatal medical leaves for each month of the pregnancy period that they are employed.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

The national government and local governments will ensure the availability of reproductive health care services like family planning and [[prenatal care]].&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

Any person or public official who prohibits or restricts the delivery of legal and medically safe reproductive health care services will be meted penalty by imprisonment or a fine.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

== Support ==

Free choice regarding reproductive health enables people, especially the poor, to have the number of children they want and can feasibly care and provide for. There are several studies cited by those who support the bill:
*Economic studies, especially the experience in Asia,&lt;ref name="SOE2008" /&gt; show that rapid population growth and high fertility rates, especially among the poor, exacerbate poverty and make it harder for the government to address it.&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=adb2004 /&gt;
*Poverty incidence is higher among big families.&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=orbeta2003 /&gt; Smaller families and wider birth intervals could allow families to invest more in each child’s education, health, nutrition and eventually reduce poverty and hunger at the household level&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;
*Studies show that 44% of the pregnancies in the poorest [[Quantile|quintile]] are unanticipated, and among the poorest women who would like to avoid pregnancy, at least 41% do not use any contraceptive method because of lack of information or access&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt; and "among the poorest families, 22% of married women of reproductive age express a desire to avoid pregnancies but are still not using any family planning method"&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;
*Use of contraception, which the [[World Health Organization]] has listed as [[essential medicine]]s,&lt;ref name=Angsioco2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=essentialmed2010 /&gt; will lower the rate of abortions as it has done in other parts of the world, according to the [[Guttmacher Institute]]&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt;
*An SWS survey of 2008 showed that 71% of the respondents are in favor of the bill&lt;ref name=sws2008 /&gt;

== Criticism ==

Opponents of the bill argue that:

*People's freedom to access contraceptives is not restricted by any opposing law, being available in family planning NGOs, stores, etc. The country is not a [[welfare state]]: taxpayer's money should not be used for personal practices that are harmful and immoral; it can be used to inform people of the harm of BCPs.
*The penal provisions constitute a violation of free choice and conscience, and establishes [[religious persecution]]&lt;ref name=ocampo&gt;{{Cite news

President Aquino stated he was not an author of the bill. He also stated that he gives full support to a firm population policy, educating parents to be responsible, providing contraceptives to those who ask for them, but he refuses to promote contraceptive use. He said that his position "is more aptly called responsible parenthood rather than reproductive health".&lt;ref name=pdivarious /&gt;&lt;ref name=tubeza /&gt;

== Economic and demographic premises ==

The Philippines is the 39th most densely populated country, with a density over 335 per square kilometer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/rankings/geography/population_density_persons_per_sq_km_2011_0.html |title=Population density - Persons per sq km 2011 country ranks, By Rank |publisher=Photius.com |date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the population growth rate is 1.9% (2010 Census),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://census.gov.ph/data/pressrelease/2012/pr1227tx.html |title=THE 2010 CENSUS OF POPULATION AND HOUSING REVEALS THE PHILIPPINE POPULATION AT 92.34 MILLION |publisher=Census.gov.ph |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1.957% (2010 est. by [[CIA World Factbook]]), or 1.85% (2005–2010 high variant estimate by the UN Population Division, ''World Population Prospects: The 2008 Revision'') coming from 3.1 in 1960.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The 2013 [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) is 3.20 births per woman, from a TFR of 7 in 1960.&lt;ref name=factbook&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html | title= The World Factbook – Philippines | publisher=U.S. Central Intelligence Agency &lt;!-- | accessdate=2013 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the total fertility rate for the richest quintile of the population is 2.0, which is about one third the TFR of the poorest quintile (5.9 children per woman). The TFR for women with college education is 2.3, about half that of women with only an elementary education (4.5 children per woman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=643267&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=63 |title=EU hopes Congress will approve RH bill |last1=Lee Brago |first1=Pia |date=28 December 2010 |publisher=Philippine Star |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressman Lagman states that the bill "recognizes the verifiable link between a huge population and poverty. Unbridled population growth stunts socioeconomic development and aggravates poverty".&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt;

The [[University of the Philippines]] School of Economics presented two papers in support of the bill:  ''Population and Poverty: the Real Score'' (2004), and ''Population, Poverty, Politics and the Reproductive Health Bill'' (2008). According to these economists, which include [[Solita Monsod]], [[Gerardo Sicat]], Cayetano Paderanga, Ernesto M. Pernia, and Stella Alabastro-Quimbo, "rapid population growth and high fertility rates, especially among the poor, do exacerbate poverty and make it harder for the government to address it", while at the same time clarifying that it would be "extreme" to view "population growth as the principal cause of poverty that would justify the government resorting to draconian and coercive measures to deal with the problem (e.g., denial of basic services and subsidies to families with more than two children)". They illustrate the connection between rapid population growth and poverty by comparing the economic growth and population growth rates of Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines, wherein the first two grew more rapidly than the Philippines due to lower population growth rates.&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt; They stressed that "the experience from across Asia indicates that a population policy cum government-funded [family planning] program has been a critical complement to sound economic policy and poverty reduction".&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;

In ''Population and Poverty'', Aniceto Orbeta, Jr., showed that poverty incidence is higher among big families: 57.3% of Filipino families with seven children are in poverty while only 23.8% of families who have two children live below the poverty threshold.&lt;ref name=orbeta2003 /&gt;
[[File:Philippines poverty.png|thumb|right|150px|Percentage of population living below poverty line (2003). Darker areas mean more poverty.]]
Proponents argue that smaller families and wider birth intervals resulting from the use of contraceptives allow families to invest more in each child’s education, health, nutrition and eventually reduce poverty and hunger at the household level.&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt; At the national level, fertility reduction cuts the cost of social services with fewer people attending school or seeking medical care and as demand eases for housing, transportation, jobs, water, food, and other natural resources.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt; The [[Asian Development Bank]] in 2004 also listed a large population as one of the major causes of poverty in the country, together with weak macroeconomic management, employment issues, an underperforming agricultural sector and an unfinished land reform agenda, governance issues including corruption.&lt;ref name=adb2004 /&gt;

=== Criticism of premises ===

Opponents refer to a 2003 study of [[Rand Corporation]], which concluded that "there is little cross-country evidence that population growth impedes or promotes economic growth...population neutralism has in fact been the predominant school in thinking among academics about population growth for the last half-century". For example, the 1992 study of [[Ross Levine]] and David Renelt, which covered 119 countries over 30 years (versus a [[University of the Philippines]] study of 3 countries over a few years). The RAND study also said that a large population can promote growth given the right fundamentals.&lt;ref name=rand2003 /&gt; Thus, they refer to the [[HSBC]] 2012 projection for 2050 that the Philippines will be 16th largest economy due to its large growing population, and those whose populations are decreasing will suffer decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsbcnet.com/gbm/global-insights/insights/2012/wider-world-in-2050.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent development, two authors of the Reproductive Health Bill changed their stand on the provisions of the bill regarding population and development. Reps. Emerciana de Jesus and [[Luzviminda Ilagan]] wanted to delete three provisions which state that "gender equality and women empowerment are central elements of reproductive health and population and development", which integrate responsible parenthood and family planning programs into anti-poverty initiatives, and which name the Population Commission as a coordinating body. The two party-list representatives strongly state that poverty is not due to over-population but because of inequality and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calonzo|first=Andreo|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/222199/nation/2-rh-authors-want-population-control-provisions-scrapped|title=2 RH authors want population control provisions scrapped|publisher=GMA News Online|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' in July 2012 said that Aquino's "promotion of a 'reproductive health' bill is jarring" since it could lead to "a demographic trap of too few workers. The Philippines doesn't have too many people, it has too few pro-growth policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443570904577544542963426800 |title=Review &amp; Outlook: Keeping the Philippine Dream Alive - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposing the bill, Former Finance Secretary [[Roberto de Ocampo]] wrote that it is "truly disingenuous for anyone to proceed on the premise that the poor are to blame for the nation’s poverty:. He emphasized that the government should apply the principle of first things first and focus on the root causes of the poverty (e.g., poor governance, corruption) and apply many other alternatives to solve the problem (e.g., giving up [[pork barrel]], raising tax collection efficiency).&lt;ref name=ocampo /&gt;

== Maternal health and deaths ==
Maternal deaths in the Philippines, according to the [[World Health Organization]], is at 5.7 per day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/49029/studies-show-maternal-deaths-in-philippines-in-decline |title=Studies show maternal deaths in Philippines in decline &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-08-28 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; not 10–11 deaths a day, as per the proponents who repeated these numbers "to drive home the point".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CBCP for Life |url=http://cbcpforlife.com/?p=5375 |title=Year-ender report: The crusade for a culture of life, Part 2 |publisher=Cbcpforlife.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=784230&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=64 |title=Pass the RH bill now - FROM THE STANDS By Domini M. Torrevillas - The Philippine Star » News » Opinion |publisher=Philstar.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proponents state that the passage of the RH Bill would mean:
*Access to information on natural and modern family planning
*Improvement of maternal, infant, and child health and nutrition
*Promotion of breast feeding
*Prevention of abortion and management of post-abortion complications
*Improvement of adolescent and youth health
*Prevention and management of reproductive tract infections, HIV/AIDS and other STDs
*Elimination of violence against women
*Counseling on sexuality and sexual and reproductive health
*Treatment of breast and reproductive tract cancers
*Male involvement and participation in reproductive health issues
*Prevention and treatment of infertility
*Reproductive health education for the youth

The Department of Health states that family planning can reduce maternal mortality by about 32%.&lt;ref name=Angsioco2008 /&gt; The bill is "meant to prevent maternal deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth", said Clara Padilla of Engender Rights. She reported that every day, "there are 11 women dying while giving birth in the Philippines. These preventable deaths could have been avoided if more Filipino women have access to reproductive health information and healthcare".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The key to solving maternal deaths, according to the ''Senate Policy Brief'' on reproductive health, is the establishment of [[birthing center]]s.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

The [[Philippine Medical Association]] (PMA) stated in their Position Paper that the goal of reducing the rise of maternal and child deaths "could be attained by improving maternal and child health care without the necessity of distributing contraceptives. The millions of funds intended for the contraceptive devices may just well be applied in improving the skills of our health workers in reducing maternal and child mortality in the Philippines".&lt;ref name="pmapp" /&gt;

=== Magna Carta for Women ===

Senator Majority Floor Leader [[Tito Sotto]] said that the RH Bill is redundant to a 2009 law referred to as the Magna Carta for Women, which contains reproductive health provisions, asking the Senate to drop the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/230182/news/nation/sotto-asks-senate-to-scrap-redundant-rh-bill |title=Sotto asks Senate to scrap ‘redundant’ RH bill &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; GMA News Online &amp;#124; The Go-To Site for Filipinos Everywhere |publisher=Gmanetwork.com |date=2011-08-22 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unmet need ===

Using data from the 2008 National Demographic and Health Survey, Lagman stated that "Twenty-two percent of married Filipino women have an unmet need for family planning services, an increase by more than one-third since the 2003 National Demographic and Housing Survey". "Our women are having more children than they desire, as seen in the gap between desired fertility (2.5 children) and actual fertility (3.5 children), implying a significant unmet need for reproductive health services", state some [[Ateneo de Manila University]] professors. The Bill provides that "the State shall assist couples, parents and individuals to achieve their desired family size within the context of responsible parenthood for sustainable development and encourage them to have two children as the ideal family size."&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

Writing against the bill, [[Bernardo Villegas]] wrote about the ''Myth of Unmet Family Planning Needs'', citing development economist [[Lant Pritchett]] who said that the term "unmet need" is an elitist construct, an imposition of a need on the poor, disrespectful of their real preferences. Pritchett said that it is "based on a discrepancy...identified by the analyst through the comparison of responses to items in separate blocks of the questionnaire" and is "an inference on the part of the researcher, not a condition reported by the respondents themselves". Pritchett argued this term is applied to women who are not sexually active, are infecund, whose husband is absent, etc., thus bloating the numbers to favor the pharmaceutical companies and those with a population control agenda. Villegas stressed: "Because [the poor] have been deprived of the infrastructures they need, such as farm-to-market roads, [[irrigation]] systems, post-harvest facilities and other support services that the State neglected to provide them, the only economic resources they have are their children". He also challenged that he is willing to bet that if the government will provide cash money to the poor to buy condoms, the poor will use the cash for food and basic needs, thus exploding the myth.&lt;ref name=villegasunmet /&gt;

=== Access ===

One of the main concerns of the proponents is the perceived lack of access to family planning devices such as contraceptives and sterilization. The bill intends to provide universal access through government funding, complementing thus private sector initiatives for family planning services, such as those offered by the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] (IPPF) which supports the Family Planning Organizations of the Philippines and the 97 organizations of the Philippine NGO Council.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[File:Pilule contraceptive.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Combined oral contraceptive pill|Birth control pill]]]]
The UP School of Economics argues, in contrast, that there is lack of access especially for poor people, because contraceptive use is extremely low among them and "among the poorest families, 22% of married women of reproductive age express a desire to avoid pregnancies but are still not using any family planning method".&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt; They say that lack of access leads to a number of serious problems which demand attention: (1) "too many and too {{sic|hide=y|closely|-}}spaced children raises the risk of illness and premature deaths (for mother and child alike)," (2) "the health risks associated with mistimed and unwanted pregnancies are higher for adolescent mothers, as they are more likely to have complications during labor," (3) women who have mistimed pregnancies are "constrained to rely more on public education and health services and other publicly provided goods and services", further complicating limited public resources, (4) families are not able to achieve their desired family size. Thus the UP economists "strongly and unequivocally support" the thrust of the bill to enable "couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information and means to carry out their decisions”.&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt; Proponents argue that government-funded access is the key to breaking the inter-generational poverty that many people are trapped in.&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

=== Natural family planning ===

Proponents of the bill contend that "natural family planning methods have not proven to be as reliable as artificial means of birth control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plcpd.com/rh-in-the-news/rh-bill-authors-agree-to-make-sex-education-optional/ |title=RH bill authors agree to make sex education optional &amp;#124; Philippine Legislators Committee on Population and Development Foundation, Inc |publisher=Plcpd.com |date=2011-03-23 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abortion ==

=== Abortifacient issue ===

According to the RH bill, one of its components is "prevention of abortion and management of post-abortion complications". It provides that "the government shall ensure that all women needing care for post-abortion complications shall be treated and counseled in a humane, non-judgmental and compassionate manner". It also states that "abortion remains a crime and is punishable", as the Constitution declares that “the State shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from [[Fertilisation|conception]]”.&lt;ref name=jlp-law /&gt;

The position of the [[Philippine Medical Association]] (PMA) "is founded strongly on the principle that 'life or conception begins at fertilization' at that moment where there is fusion or union of the sperm and the egg and thus a human person or human being already does exist at the moment of fertilization". The PMA condemns abortifacients that "destroys the fertilized egg or the embryo" and "abhors any procedure...or medication that will interrupt any stage of fertilization and prevents its normal, physiological, uninterrupted growth to adulthood".&lt;ref name="pmapp" /&gt;

Jo Imbong, founder of the Abay Pamilya Foundation, reported that "Lagman said in a House hearing that the bill would protect human life 'from implantation' ",&lt;ref name=Imbong2008 /&gt; and not from fertilization, noting at the same time that the Records of the Constitutional Commission state that “Human life begins at fertilization”.&lt;ref name=Imbong2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CC1986 /&gt;

[[File:Blastocyst, day 5.JPG|thumb|5-day old human embryo called a [[blastocyst]], which comprises 70–100 cells.]]

=== Contraception and abortion relationship ===

Proponents argue that research by the [[Guttmacher Institute]], involved in advancing international reproductive health, reveals that the use of contraceptives can reduce abortion rates by 85%. Proponents such as 14 [[Ateneo de Manila University]] professors, argued thus: "Studies show that the majority of women who go for an abortion are married or in a consensual union (91%), the mother of three or more children (57%), and poor (68%) (Juarez, Cabigon, and Singh 2005). For these women, terminating a pregnancy is an anguished choice they make in the face of severe constraints. When women who had attempted an abortion were asked their reasons for doing so, their top three responses were: they could not afford the economic cost of raising another child (72%); their pregnancy occurred too soon after the last one (57%); and they already have enough children (54%). One in ten women (13%) who had attempted an abortion revealed that this was because her pregnancy resulted from forced sex (ibid.). Thus, for these women, abortion has become a family planning method, in the absence of information on and access to any reliable means to prevent an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy".&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

The bill, said Clara Padilla of EnGender Rights Inc, will "help reduce the number of abortions by providing increased access to information and services on modern contraceptive methods, that in turn will reduce the number of unwanted—and often aborted—pregnancies".&lt;ref name=Padilla2010 /&gt;

Both sides of the debate accuse the other side of deception and misleading the public. The pro-RH people accuse the anti-RH group of misleading the public by calling the bill an abortion bill, when the bill states that abortion remains a crime and is punishable. The anti-RH advocates accuse the RH supporters of hiding from the public the international population control agenda which includes abortion and they refer to U.S. Secretary Hillary Clinton who said that RH includes abortion.&lt;ref name=clintonrep /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=730979&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=64 |title=Jose Sison, Opposing something wrong, Philippine Star |work=The Philippine Star |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fr.

== Contraceptives ==

=== Morality and social effects ===

{{POV section|date=January 2013}}

Fourteen professors from [[Ateneo de Manila University]], a prominent Catholic University, considering the empirical evidence of the dire socioeconomic conditions of the Filipino poor, urged that the bill be passed to help them. They argued: "As Catholics and Filipinos, we share the hope and mission of building a Church of the Poor. We are thus deeply disturbed and saddened by calls made by some members of the Catholic Church to reject a proposed legislation that promises to improve the wellbeing of Filipino families, especially the lives of women, children, adolescents, and the poor". They announced that "Catholic social teachings recognize the primacy of the well-formed conscience over wooden compliance to directives from political and religious authorities", urging Catholic authorities to withdraw their opposition the bill.&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt; Citing Catholic documents and scientific studies, they reasoned that "the RH Bill is pro-life, pro-women, pro-poor, pro-youth, and pro-informed choice". They emphasized that the bill "promotes quality of life, by enabling couples, especially the poor, to bring into the world only the number of children they believe they can care for and nurture to become healthy and productive members of our society".&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt; Thus, they called their paper "Catholics Can Support the RH Bill in Good Conscience".&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

In response, the Ateneo administration announced its unity with Catholic teaching and that it had "serious objections to the present bill".&lt;ref name=Ateneoadmin /&gt;

Proponents such as Lagman also stressed that official Catholic teaching itself, expressed in the Encyclical ''Humanae Vitae'' issued only forty years ago in 1964, is not infallible.&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt; He said that the Papal Commission on Birth Control, which included ranking prelates and theologians, recommended that the Church change its teaching on contraception as it concluded that “the regulation of conception appears necessary for many couples who wish to achieve a responsible, open and reasonable parenthood in today’s circumstances”. The editorial of the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'', moreover, stated that Catholic teaching is "only" a religious teaching and should not be imposed with intolerance on a secular state.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Opponents argue that misery is not the result of the church which they say is the largest charitable organization in the world, but of a breakdown in moral sense that gives order to society, nor does misery come from parents who bring up children in faithfulness, discipline, love and respect for life, but from those who strip human beings of moral dignity and responsibility, by treating them as mere machines, which they believe contraception does.&lt;ref name=ratzinger /&gt;

=== Health reasons ===

Stating that contraception is a lie and "against the beginning of new life", the [[Philippine Medical Association]] also stressed that the "health risks of contraception to women are considerable; the list of side effects is long, and includes high blood pressure, strokes, increased incidence of some forms of cancer".&lt;ref name="pmapp" /&gt;
	 	
[[File:Flag of WHO.svg|thumb|right|170px|While the [[World Health Organization]] acknowledges the possible negative side effects of the pill, it still defines it as an [[essential medicine]].]]

Proponents such as E. Ansioco of Democratic Socialist Women of the Philippines argued that "The World Health Organization (WHO) includes contraceptives in its Model Lists of Essential Drugs" and thus are safe medicines.&lt;ref name=Angsioco2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=essentialmed2010 /&gt; "Medical and scientific evidence," says the main proponent, "shows that all the possible medical risks connected with contraceptives are infinitely lower than the risks of an actual pregnancy and everyday activities...The risk of dying within a year of using pills is 1 in 200,000. The risk of dying from a vasectomy is 1 in 1 million and the risk of dying from using an IUD is 1 in 10 million...But the risk of dying from a pregnancy is 1 in 10,000."&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt;

=== HIV/AIDS ===

The RH bill provides for "prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS and other, STIs/STDs", especially since the number of HIV cases among the young nearly tripled from 41 in 2007 to 110 in 2008.&lt;ref name=Padilla2010 /&gt; Proponents emphasized that RH will help in stemming the AIDS epidemic that is worsening in the Philippines. Lagman explained that "Globally, the new number of reported cases of HIV infections and deaths has dropped by nearly 20 percent. It is therefore both ironic and tragic that the Philippines’ trajectory is towards the other direction. Our country’s HIV/AIDS statistics have increased by 30 percent!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edcellagman.com.ph/speeches/house/271-world-aids-celebration.html |title=World AIDS Celebration |publisher=Edcellagman.com.ph |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary among the means is distribution of condoms. The proponents applauded government efforts last February 2010 when it distributed condoms in some areas of Manila.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Opinion polls and TV debates ==

Proponents refer to many surveys conducted by two prominent locally based organizations (SWS and Pulse Asia) which show majority support for the bill. A survey conducted in 2008 by the [[Social Weather Stations]], commissioned by the Forum for Family Planning and Development (FFPD), a non-government advocacy group, showed that 68 percent of Filipinos agree that there should be a law requiring government to distribute legal contraceptives.&lt;ref name=Sisante2008 /&gt; SWS President and RH Bill proponent, ''Mahar Mangahas'' reported that the "survey found 71 percent in favor [of the RH Bill], 21 percent undecided, and a mere 8 percent opposed. Among those who originally knew of the bill, the score is 84 percent in favor, and 6 percent opposed. Among those who learned of the bill for the first time because of the survey, the score is 59 percent in favor, versus 11 percent opposed.&lt;ref name=sws2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sisante2008 /&gt; Pulse Asia reported that in an October 2008 survey "most Filipinos are aware of the reproductive health bill pending at the House of Representatives (68%) and are in favor of the bill (63%)".&lt;ref name=pulseasia2008 /&gt; In December 2010, Pulse Asia announced based on the results of an October 2010 survey, 69% of the Filipinos are in favor of the bill.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

President of Prolife Philippines, [[Lito Atienza]], said that the surveys conducted by SWS and Pulse Asia were misleading, because the participants were not fully informed of the bill, were merely aware of it, and informed that it was about health and "modern methods". Instead he referred to the Filipino Family survey of December 2009 conducted by the HB&amp;A International (an affiliate of [[Louis Harris &amp; Associates]]) together with the personnel of Asia Research Organization (the Philippine affiliate of [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup International]]). The survey concluded that 92% of people in metropolitan Manila rejected the bill, "85 percent are not aware that once passed the RH bill would allow teenagers to secure 'abortifacient devices and substances' without their parents’ knowledge and consent....90 percent do not agree that Congress should appropriate P2 billion to the detriment of other essential medicines for free children’s vaccinations, treatment of dreaded diseases and other more important health and medical concerns."&lt;ref name=standard2010 /&gt; Mangahas acknowledged that the SWS surveys did not include the penalties.&lt;ref name=compromise /&gt;

A TV Debate was also hosted by [[ABS-CBN Network|ABS-CBN]] last May 2011. Leaders of both sides, including Rep. Lagman and Rep. Golez were present. According to the ABS-CBN news which reported on the results: "In the SMS poll, 69.58% of votes cast reject the RH bill while 30.42% support it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malig |first=Jojo |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/05/08/11/philippines-still-divided-reproductive-health-bill |title=Philippines still divided on reproductive health bill &amp;#124; ABS-CBN News &amp;#124; Latest Philippine Headlines, Breaking News, Video, Analysis, Features |publisher=ABS-CBN News |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the separate online poll held on the Harapan microsite that livestreamed the debate, majority voted against the bill at the very end of the debate.{{Dubious|date=August 2012}}

On TV5's Debate ''Hamon sa Pagbabago'' on August 21, 2011, the studio audience voted 100% against the bill, while 58.7% of the viewers voted against the RH Bill via text messaging, versus 41.3% in favor.&lt;ref&gt;TV5 Debate, Hamon sa Pagbabago, 21 August 2011, hosted by Ricardo "Dong" Puno and Luchi Cruz-Valdez.&lt;/ref&gt;

The online poll conducted by the ''[[Philippine Star]]'' published on May 18, 2011, showed that 56% were against the RH Bill, while 44% were in favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/article.aspx?publicationsubcategoryid=522&amp;articleid=687349 |title=Philstar poll on RH Bill » Nation » News &amp;#124; Philippine News |publisher=philstar.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rallies ==

Beginning in late 2010, there were rallies for and against the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/probinsiya/669859/2-dakma-sa-p1m-botya|title=2 dakma sa P.1M botya|first=Ni Boy|last=Cruz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- Uploaded by noli --&gt; by |url=http://www.remate.ph/2011/03/santo-papa-umapela-sa-mga-pinoy-na-ipagtanggol-ang-buhay/ |title=Santo Papa umapela sa mga Pinoy na ipagtanggol ang buhay &amp;#124; Remate |publisher=Remate.ph |date=26 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/bacolod/local-news/20000-join-rally-vs-rh-bill |title=20,000 join rally vs RH bill |publisher=Sun.Star |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=656684 |title=Thousands join anti-RH Bill rally – The Freeman » The Freeman Sections » Cebu News |work=The Philippine Star |date=12 February 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20110328-328023/7-Bataan-%20%20barangays-follow-Ayala-Alabang-pass-own-RH-laws |title=7 Bataan barangays follow Ayala Alabang, pass own RH laws – INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012005912/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20110328-328023/7-Bataan-%20%20barangays-follow-Ayala-Alabang-pass-own-RH-laws# |archive-date=2012-10-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inquirer1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20110313-325287/Thousands-in-Laguna-Quezon-Leyte-march-vs-RH-bill |title=Thousands in Laguna, Quezon, Leyte march vs RH bill – INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iloilonewstoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1002:we-need-to-debate-on-rh-bill-says-garin&amp;catid=98:local-news |title=We need to debate on RH Bill, says Garin &amp;#124; The News Today |publisher=Iloilonewstoday.com |date=31 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/02/16/11/rh-bill-activists-hold-rally-house-oks-rh-budget |title=RH bill activists hold rally; House OKs RH budget &amp;#124; ABS-CBN News &amp;#124; Latest Philippine Headlines, Breaking News, Video, Analysis, Features |publisher=ABS-CBN News |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/110157/1000-women-march-to-mendiola-for-reproductive-health-bill |title=1,000 women march to Mendiola for Reproductive Health bill &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-12-13 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsinfo.inquirer.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/103857/no-delay-but-rh-bill-won%E2%80%99t-be-passed-this-year%E2%80%94enrile |title=No delay but RH bill won’t be passed this year—Enrile &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-12-02 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Penalties ==

There is mandatory sexuality education starting grade 5, and "malicious disinformation" is penalized.&lt;ref name="bills" /&gt; All health care service providers which provide reproductive health services, including faith-based hospital administrators, may be imprisoned or fined if they refuse to provide family planning services such as [[tubal ligation]] and [[vasectomy]]. The same may happen to employers who do not provide free services to employees.&lt;ref name="bills" /&gt; Imprisonment ranges from one to six months or a fine ranging from ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) to fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00).&lt;ref name="bills" /&gt; Former Finance Secretary [[Roberto de Ocampo]] stated that these punitive provisions "are tantamount to an affront to civil liberties and smack of religious persecution".&lt;ref name=ocampo /&gt;

Defending the bill, [[Felipe Medalla]], former dean of the [[University of the Philippines School of Economics]], said that "although the poor’s access to family planning services can be improved even without the law, the absence of the law makes it easier to block the program".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Separation of church and state ==

The head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the [[Philippines]], [[Archbishop]] [[Luis Antonio Tagle]] opposes the Reproductive Health Bill, along with [[abortion]] and [[contraception]]. Because 81% of Filipinos are Catholics, the Catholic Church exerts a strong influence in public and moral life. Its staunch opposition to the bill has drawn the controversy among non-Catholics and Catholics alike who support the bill whereby many invoke the principle of [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name="CAS2" /&gt;

Fr. Joaquin Bernas, S.J, one of the drafters of the [[Philippine Constitution]] and a prominent lawyer and writer, explained that the concept of separation of church and state is directed towards the state, rather than the church, as it is a political concept. Technically it means "non-establishment of religion," as the Constitution states, "No law shall be passed respecting an establishment of religion." It means that the state should be guided by the principle that it should support no specific religion and so government funding should not be allocated for building churches or mosques and not favor any particular religion. It does not prevent the church, parents, supervisors, teachers and other moral educators from expressing their views and educating their wards on the morality of their personal and social actions. The Catholic Church also states that their stand is based on secular reasons and natural law that are both acceptable to non-Catholics as well. Proponents, on the other hand, state that the church should not meddle in matters of the state and should focus on religious matters, not political matters.&lt;ref name="CAS" /&gt;

== Culture war and its implications ==

[[File:UN-millenium-goals.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Millennium Development Goals at the UN]]
The national debate is seen as part of a wider [[culture war]].&lt;ref name=carrol2009 /&gt; Passing it or not passing it of the bill has negative implications depending on the views. Proponents state that the not passing the bill will make the Philippines no longer be a backward state and unable to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goal]]s, especially the points on poverty alleviation and maternal health. It will mean reneging on international commitments and will slow down modernization. Also, the poor will not have free access to family planning support that many have want, and thus will have more children than they can care for and will not have the money to invest in education to break the intergenerational poverty they are trapped in. Proponents also accuse the Catholic Church of holding the Philippines "hostage" and violating the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name="quiros" /&gt; They argue that a decreased population growth will lead to improved [[quality of life]] and economic development.

== Financials ==

Department of Health is proposing 13.7 billion pesos to be fund the RH Bill if it is passed in 2012, according to Senator [[Pia Cayetano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/70387/%E2%80%98doh-proposed-nearly-p14-billion-to-fund-rh-bill-in-2012%E2%80%99 |title=‘DOH proposed nearly P14 billion to fund RH bill in 2012’ &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-10-04 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filipinos for Life, an anti-abortion organization, claimed that the bill was funded by foreign population control groups, a claim that Rep. [[Edcel Lagman]] denied as "an old yarn which is destitute of factual basis", saying that the lobby opposing the bill was the one which was backed by the "wealthy Catholic hierarchy with the aid of dozens of lay organizations”.&lt;ref name="interaksyon.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dalangin |first=Lira |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/18863/no-foreign-funding-for-rh-lobby----lagman |title=No foreign funding for RH lobby - Lagman |publisher=InterAksyon.com |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young Nine Legislators (Y9L)—including Aliah Dimaporo, [[Lucy Torres-Gomez]], Karlo Alexei Nograles—said that “The proposed P3 billion appropriation for the RH bill, if put towards education, can help secure the future of young Filipinos. That amount can build 4,644 new classrooms…or it can subsidize the college education of 300,000 scholars—a chance for underprivileged student achievers to earn their diploma”.&lt;ref name="tdz" /&gt;

Lagman on the other hand said that both these priorities are important but with a burgeoning population the budget will become even tighter, thus population growth is a major issue.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== International reactions ==

=== European Union ===

[[European Union]] Ambassador to the Philippines Alistair MacDonald said "We have all seen the figures on illegal abortion a year in the Philippines and I very much hope that both Houses of Congress will take these issues into account in producing a reproductive health legislation which will really help people make their own choices and to provide for their families".&lt;ref name=EU /&gt;

MacDonald said that lack of effective access to reproductive health services in the Philippines was "antithetical" to the country’s struggle against poverty and "It seems to me extremely unlikely that the Philippines will be able to meet its commitment under the MDGs under the present policy".&lt;ref name=EU /&gt; MacDonald noted that the [[total fertility rate]] for the richest quintile of the population is 2.0, while the total fertility rate of the poorest quintile is 5.9. The total fertility rate for women with a college education is 2.3, about half that of women with only elementary education (4.5). He mentioned that the lack of access to RH services is anti-women, citing the slow decline in the maternal mortality ratio in the Philippines. He also said surveys suggest that the total wanted fertility rate for the Philippines is 2.4 children, or below the actual TFR of 3.3 children.&lt;ref name=EU /&gt;

== Status ==

=== Legislature ===
On January 31, 2011, six different bills were consolidated into a single RH Bill which was then unanimously approved for plenary debate by the House Committee on Population and Family Relations. On February 7, 2011, the bill was scheduled to go before the House Appropriations Committee. On February 16, 2011, the bill was endorsed by the House Appropriations Committee with amendment and referred back to the Population Committee for finalizing the language.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== President and Cabinet ===
&lt;!-- [[File:Noynoy Aquino.jpg|thumb|right|150px|President [[Noynoy Aquino]] before the elections: "I will not promote it". He is strongly pushing for the passage of the RH Bill.{{Weasel-inline|date=August 2012}}]] --&gt;
President [[Noynoy Aquino]] during the presidential campaign said that it confounds him why he is always associated with the RH Bill and reiterated that he is neither an author nor a co-author and did not sign the committee report regarding the bill. He said that "he will fully support the crafting of a firm policy that will address the serious problem on population"&lt;ref name=pdivarious /&gt; At the same time, Aquino said that "artificial contraception was a matter of choice and conscience and that health professionals who fool people into using artificial contraceptives should be penalized. As a Catholic, Aquino said he himself was not promoting artificial contraception but believes that the government should be able to provide it to Filipinos who ask for it". Aquino stressed, "I’m a Catholic, I'm not promoting it. My position is more aptly called responsible parenthood rather than reproductive health."&lt;ref name=tubeza /&gt;

According to [[Rina Jimenez David]] who is pro-RH, during the “Women Deliver Philippines” Conference held September 2010, [[Dinky Soliman]], Aquino's Secretary of Social Welfare and Development, said that "choice and access” constituted the keystone of the Aquino government’s policy, reiterating the administration’s support for the pending reproductive health bills.&lt;ref name=jimenezsept10 /&gt;

On December 2010, the Cabinet and the CBCP agreed to have a joint campaign providing full information on the advantages and risks of contraceptives, natural and artificial family planning and responsible parenthood. They have established a technical working group for this purpose. They also agreed that government will not be an "instrument to enforce or violate the conscience of the people about these issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- Uploaded by remate.tonight --&gt; by |url=http://www.remate.ph/2010/12/cbcp-palace-to-launch-info-drive-on-family-planning/ |title=CBCP, Palace to launch info drive on family planning&amp;#124; Remate |publisher=Remate.ph |date=2010-12-15 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by April 2011 Aquino has given his full support to the entire RH Bill in a speech at the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] and promised to push for its passage even at the "risk of excommunication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mogato |first=Manuel |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/04/17/11/aquino-risks-church-ire-reproductive-health-bill |title=Aquino risks Church ire on reproductive health bill |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compromise and alternatives ===
Senate President [[Juan Ponce Enrile]], Congressman [[Roilo Golez]] and Buhay party-list separately filed bills that seek to restrict abortion and birth control use. These bills have been seen either as a nullification of the RH Bill, its alternative, or as a way of achieving unity among the populace, since the RH Bill proponents have stated their concern in preventing abortion.

Presidential candidate [[Gilbert Teodoro]] or Gibo suggested a cash transfer from the government to individuals wanting access to family planning methods, whether natural or artificial. The individuals can then make use of the cash they receive to purchase birth control devices they may choose, thus guaranteeing freedom of choice.&lt;ref name="villegas0410" /&gt;

The Loyola School of Theology and the John J. Carroll Institute on State and Church Issues issued nine talking points on the RH Bill. Among other points, they proposed a study on the meaning of conception in the Constitution, and if it means fertilization, abortifacients "are to be banned even now and regardless of whether the RH Bill is passed". They also proposed "parallel programs for providing information and training, one for Natural Family Planning (NFP) and another for artificial methods of family planning".&lt;ref name="LST" /&gt; Columnist Jose Sison of the ''[[Philippine Star]]'' criticized that "a Catholic School of theology has actually proposed in public, the use of tax payers’ money to train Filipinos to employ methods that are objectively and intrinsically evil" and cites "empirical evidence and scientific proofs confirming the harmful and evil effects of contraceptives to individuals and to society."&lt;ref name=Sagalosison /&gt;

=== Other events 2010–2012 ===
In September 2010, Aquino, during this visit to the United States, reiterated his stand that he is in favor of responsible parenthood and respects the decision of each couple as to the number of children they want, and if they need the government support for contraception, the government will provide it. This statement has created a furor as Catholic church leaders say that Aquino has sold out the Filipino soul in exchange for some "measly" aid from the United States. The President of the Catholic Bishops Conference said that there could be an excommunication of the President if he continues his stance. Pro-RH Bill snators encouraged the President to be steadfast to do his duties towards the state. The President's spokesperson [[Edwin Lacierda]] explained that the President "has not changed his stand" and is reaching out to the prelates and said that he has not made any decision in support of the Reproductive Health Bill as he was still studying the document. Lacierda said that the Executive Branch "is not involved in the passage of the RH bill, saying the measure's fate rests solely on the legislative branch."

[[Filipino Freethinkers]], an association of agnostics, atheists, progressives, etc., very active in the fight in favor of the RH bill, stepped up the pressure, creating more controversy that fired up renewed interest in the bill on both sides. On September 30, 2010, one of the freethinkers, Carlos Celdran staged a protest action against the Catholic Church, holding a sign which read "DAMASO," a reference to the villainous, corrupt clergyman [[Father Dámaso]] of the novel ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' by Filipino revolutionary writer [[Jose Rizal]], and shouting "stop getting involved in politics!" A fan page, Free Carlos Celdran was created in [[Facebook]], which generated 23,808 fans in 24 hours. Francisco Montalvan of the ''Inquirer'' said that in the end the Damasos are the scheming, corrupt and deceptive people, implying that the "pro-death advocates" are these, while the Cardinal Rosales who started a nationwide fund for the poor is very far from Damaso. Meanwhile, the [[Imam]] Council of the Philippines, the top leaders of the Moslem population which at 4.5 million constitutes 5% of the Philippine population, declared that they are against contraceptives since using them "underestimates God" and "makes one lose morality in the process."

During the first public hearing on 24 Nov, the chair of the Committee on Population handling the bill said that there is no instruction from the Speaker of the House to expedite the bill. Upon the call of anti-RH congressmen, the Committee Chair decided to refer the bill also to the Committee on Health since the bill is about Reproductive Health. Leader of the pro-RH group, Elizabeth Ansioco, said that the bill is doomed if it is referred to the Committee on Health. Anti-RH Deputy Speaker Congressman Pablo Garcia said the members of the Committee on Health knew of the WHO announcement on the carcinogenicity of combined estrogen-progestogen oral contraceptives.

House Speaker Belmonte said that Congress is not likely to rush the legislation of the bill and will tackle it in plenary early next year. Belmonte said it is better that highly contentious bills be given more attention.

On 3 December, the Senate cut the proposed budget of P 880M for contraceptives down to P 8M for condoms since other contraceptives violated the Constitution's ban on abortifacients, and Senator Tito Sotto III said that his constituents never asked for contraceptives.

On 27 July 2012, the Speaker of the House decided to put to a vote, by August 7, 2012, on whether the debates have to be terminated.  Meanwhile, six co-authors of the bill withdrew support, with the head of the minority group of the house declaring that eight of their group are withdrawing their previous support for the bill.&lt;ref name="philstar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/article.aspx?publicationsubcategoryid=200&amp;articleid=832879 |title=House minority group no longer supports RH bill » Nation » News &amp;#124; Philippine News |publisher=philstar.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congressional approval and presidential assent ===
At 3 in the morning on December 13, 2012, the House of Representatives voted on second reading in favor of the bill with 113–109 while five representatives abstained. In the upper house, the Senate voted, on December 18, 2012, to pass the bill on second reading with 13–8, while Senators [[Sergio Osmeña, III|Sergio Osmeña III]] and [[Lito Lapid]] were absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/326013/congress-passes-rh-bill |title=Congress passes RH Bill |author1=Cathy C.

On the same day, both houses passed the bill on the third and final reading. Members of the House of Representatives voted 133–79, while seven representatives abstained. The Senate registered 13–8, the same result as the second reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2012/12/17/congress-passes-rh-bill-258805 |title=House, Senate approve reproductive health bill on final reading |date=December 17, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |work=Sun.Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 19, 2012, both versions of the bill were passed to the Bicameral Committee to produce a final version to be signed by the President Aquino. The committee quickly passed the bill in just one session. It was transmitted back to the House of Representatives and the Senate, which both ratified the bill, with the Senate voting 11–5 in favor of ratification, and the House of Representatives voting via [[voice vote]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/326881/rh-bill-passes-bicam |title=RH Bill passes bicam |author=Maila Ager |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=December 19, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/50815/senate-ratifies-bicam-report-on-rh-bill-by-a-vote-of-11-5 |title=Senate, House ratify bicameral panel version of RH Bill |author1=Karl John Reyes |author2=Lira Dalangin Fernandez |publisher=InterAKSYON |work=[[Associated Broadcasting Company|TV5]] |date=December 19, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222043804/http://www.interaksyon.com/article/50815/senate-ratifies-bicam-report-on-rh-bill-by-a-vote-of-11-5 |archivedate=December 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 2012, President Aquino signed the bill into law, codifying the bill as Republic Act No. 10354, otherwise known as the "Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012". News of the signing was announced by House Majority Leader [[Neptali Gonzales II]] on December 28, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/18728-aquino-signs-rh-bill-into-law |title=President Aquino signs RH bill into law |author=Angela Casauay |publisher=Rappler.com |work=Rappler |date=December 28, 2012 |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supreme Court challenge and delay of implementation ===
In response to petitions challenging the law's constitutionality, the Supreme Court voted 10-5 on March 19, 2013 to issue a status quo ante order halting the implementation of the law for four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

During oral arguments, several justices indicated that the court "does not seem to be the right forum–at least for now." Ir could not settle medical issues, such as whether any contraceptives to be made available were actually abortifacients. Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno said the court might have no choice but to exercise "judicial restraint" on the 15 petitions opposing the law.&lt;ref name=sc-july-9-2013&gt;

On July 16, the justices voted 8-7 to extend the status quo ante order, which would have expired the next day "until further orders effective immediately."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Supreme Court extends order stopping RH law|date = July 16, 2013|url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/317652/news/nation/supreme-court-extends-order-stopping-rh-law|accessdate = August 18, 2013|work = GMA News Online|author=Mark Merueñas}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Oral arguments concluded on August 27, with the petitioners against and for the law being instructed to submit memorandums within 60 days.&lt;ref&gt;

On April 8, 2014, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law. The justices, however, struck down eight provisions of the law partially or in full.&lt;ref name="Rappler1" /&gt;

In 2015, the Supreme Court's issued a temporary restraining order on certain provisions of the law, forbidding the distribution of contraceptive implants.&lt;ref name="ap-2017-01-11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/philippines-intensify-drive-offering-free-contraceptives-081710742.html|title=Philippines to offer free contraceptives to 6 million women|author=[[Associated Press]]|website=yahoo.com|date=11 January 2017|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the restraining order on certain methods of contraception, in September 2018, President Duterte decided to ensure, within 2018, free contraception for 6 million women with unmet needs for modern family planning - in 2018, for 2 million women identified as poor, and later for further 4 million women.&lt;ref name="ap-2017-01-11"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2636">'''Rurality''' is used as an expression of different [[rural]] areas as not being [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneously]] defined. Many authors involved in [[mental health]] research in rural areas, stress the importance of steering clear of inflexible blanket definitions of rurality {{harv|Philo|Parr|Burns|2003}}, and to instead "select definitions of rurality that are appropriate to the study being conducted" {{harv|Cloke|1977}}. One of the simplest, but clearest definition of rurality is that one that expresses rurality as "a condition of place-based homeliness shared by people with common ancestry or heritage and who inhabit traditional, culturally defined areas or places statutorily recognized to be rural" {{harv|Chigbu|2013|p=815}}.

The index {{harvcoltxt|Cloke|1977}} developed categorises all areas of England and Wales into four criteria: extreme rural, intermediate rural, intermediate non-rural and extreme non-rural; as well as urban areas. He used 16 different ways of drawing the conclusions for his model, all of which led to the measure of an area's rurality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5555">A '''shipping container clinic''' is a type of [[shipping container architecture]] using [[intermodal container]]s (shipping containers) as the structural element of a medical clinic that can be easily deployed to remote regions of the world. Shipping containers are ideal because of their inherent strength, wide availability and relatively low cost. In addition, and most relevant, shipping containers can be deployed anywhere in the world with the clinic already assembled within the container. This means pop-up clinics can be operational within days after deployment.

==History==
Several organizations have developed the concept of shipping container clinics:
* In 2005, Hospitals of Hope produced a "Clinic In A Can" in a 45-foot trailer that was sent to [[Les Cayes]], [[Haiti]] to provide medical relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hospitalsofhope.org/images/stories/Documents/news/aapa7-30-05.pdf|title=International Humanitarian of the Year|publisher=Hospitalsofhope.org|format=PDF|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 45 foot trailer is converted into five medical rooms, with each one being approximately 70 square feet. The container has since helped Hospitals of Hope provide care to over 30,000 residents of Haiti.
* In 2006, [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning author, [[Laurie Garrett]], worked with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to create a prototype "Doc In A Box" based on Garrett's conceptual framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/projects/world/doc-in-a-box-project/pr1247|title=Doc-in-a-Box Project|work=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lauriegarrett.com/index.php/en/progress/2542/ |accessdate=September 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004170956/http://www.lauriegarrett.com/index.php/en/progress/2542/ |archivedate=October 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 2010, Hospitals of Hope sent two "Clinic In A Cans" to Haiti in partnership with Heart to Heart International in response to the earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1 = Deb|last1 = Gruver |title = Hospitals for Hope converts shipping containers into clinics|url = http://www.kansas.com/news/local/article1021575.html|date = 26 January 2010|newspaper = The Wichita Eagle |accessdate = 2014-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The containers were both 40 foot long and cost around $12,000 to build.
* In November 2010, Containers 2 Clinics sent a prototype clinic to be used on site at Grace Children's Hospital in [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://containers2clinics.org/documents/AC-MSH-C2C-GCH%20PR%20Nov%201.pdf|title=The Power of Partnership:  Working Together to Restore Maternal and Pediatric Health in Haiti |publisher=Containers2clinics.org|format=PDF|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://containers2clinics.org/|title=Care 2 Communities|work=Care 2 Communities|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2011, a three-unit Clinic In A Can was shipped to Haiti in partnership with Aslan Youth Ministries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clinicinacan.org/container-hospital-headed-for-haiti/|title=Container Clinic Headed for Haiti!|work=Clinic In A Can|accessdate=13 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018082032/http://www.clinicinacan.org/container-hospital-headed-for-haiti/|archivedate=18 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This small hospital will be operated by Aslan Youth Ministries, an organization working in the north-east of Haiti. With a fault line running right under where they work, steel shipping containers are much safer than a concrete structure.
* In August 2012, Clinics4All established its Global Clinic Donation Program (GCDP) to provide MEDICAL CLINICS free of charge to third-world Governments through their respective departments or Ministries of Health – as a means of assisting developing country Governments in improving access to healthcare in medically under-served and remote areas, particularly for children and women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070031/http://www.clinics4all.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=43&amp;Itemid=186] &lt;/ref&gt;
* In March 2013, Clinic In A Can shipped a solar powered clinic to [[Mirebalais]], [[Haiti]] in partnernship with Global Vision Citadelle Ministries, as well as a radiology Clinic In A Can to [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansas.com/2013/03/12/2712596/local-nonprofit-to-send-2-clinic.html|title=Local nonprofit to send 2 ‘Clinic in a Can’ facilities overseas|work=kansas|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/news/2013/03/12/wichita-nonprofit-shipping-two.html|title=Wichita nonprofit shipping two portable medical clinics overseas|date=12 March 2013|work=Wichita Business Journal|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In July 2013, Arkitainer opened its doors as a UK based company specialising in the use of shipping containers for various community based projects. A recent proposal for a residential community complete with clinics, schooling and vocational training for Cape Town is currently underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkitainer.com|title=Arkitainer - Shipping Container Architecture - Arkitainer - Shipping Container Architecture|publisher=Arkitainer.com|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[dentistry]], a '''typodont''' is a model of the oral cavity, including [[teeth]], [[gingiva]], and the [[palate]].

A typodont is an educational tool for dental and hygienist students, allowing them to practice certain dental procedures on the plastic teeth of a model before actually performing the procedures on live patients.  Generally, typodonts have replaceable, screw-in teeth that are composed of materials that allow students to drill cavity preparations and fill them with restorative material, such as [[Amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]] or [[Dental_composite|composite]], or prepare the plastic teeth for [[Crown (dentistry)|crowns]] and [[bridge (dentistry)|bridges]].

Public '''water supply and sanitation in the United Kingdom''' is characterised by universal access and generally good [[service quality]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. A salient feature of the sector in the [[United Kingdom]] compared to other developed countries is the diversity of institutional arrangements between the constituting parts of the UK ([[Water supply and sanitation in England and Wales|England and Wales]]; [[Water supply and sanitation in Scotland|Scotland]]; and [[Northern Ireland Water|Northern Ireland]]), which are each described in separate articles, while this article is devoted to some common issues across the United Kingdom.

== Access ==

Access to improved [[water supply]] and sanitation in the UK is universal. In 2015, 100% of the population had access to improved water supply and 99% of the population had access to "[[Improved sanitation|improved" sanitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://washwatch.org/en/countries/united-kingdom/summary/statistics/|title=WASHwatch.org -      United Kingdom|website=washwatch.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;WHO/UNICEF (2015) [https://www.wssinfo.org/documents/ Progress on sanitation and drinking water - 2015 update and MDG assessment], Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation&lt;/ref&gt;

== Water sources ==
According to the Environment Agency, total water abstraction for public water supply in the UK was 16,406 [[megalitre]]s per day in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/library/data/112185.aspx Environment Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; Groundwater contributes 30 per cent of public supply water in England. In Wales and Scotland groundwater provides about five per cent of public supply. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bgs.ac.uk/research/groundwater/waterResources/GroundwaterInUK/2015.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  The majority of the UK's abstraction of surface water is from reservoirs, where rainwater is transported via rivers and streams and contained in an artificial or natural lake until it's required.  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.water.org.uk/about-water-uk/water-supply&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibility for water supply and sanitation ==

=== Policy and regulation ===

In England and Wales the economic regulator of water companies is the [[Water Services Regulation Authority]] (Ofwat). The [[Environment Agency]] is responsible for environmental regulation, and the [[Drinking Water Inspectorate]] for regulating drinking water quality. The economic water industry regulator in [[Scotland]] is the [http://www.watercommission.co.uk/ Water Industry Commission for Scotland] and the environmental regulator is the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]].  Drinking water standards and wastewater discharge standards in the UK, as in other countries of the [[European Union]], are determined by the EU (see [[Water supply and sanitation in the European Union]]).

=== Service provision ===

{{details|United Kingdom water companies}}

In '''England and Wales''' water and sewerage services are provided by 10 private regional water and sewerage companies and 13 mostly smaller private "water only" companies. In '''Scotland''' water and sewerage services are provided by a single public company, [[Scottish Water]]. In '''Northern Ireland''' water and sewerage services are also provided by a single public entity, [[Northern Ireland Water]].

[[Image:Uk-map.svg|200px|right|thumb|''Source'': [[CIA World Factbook]]]]

== Employment ==
Total employment by UK water companies amounted to 41,000 [[full-time equivalent]] jobs in 2012/13, according to an analysis by the consulting firm [[Deloitte]]. In addition, 86,000 jobs were supported indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tapping into growth: economic impact report|url=http://www.water.org.uk/publications/reports/tapping-growth-economic-impact-report|publisher=Water UK|accessdate=1 September 2014|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial aspects ==

=== Tariffs ===

According to a 2006 survey by NUS consulting the average water tariff (price) without sewerage in the U.K. for large consumers was the equivalent of US$1.90 per cubic metre. This was the third-highest tariff among the 14 mostly OECD countries covered by the report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nusconsulting.com/downloads/2006WaterSurvey.pdf NUS Consulting]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metering ==

A particularity of water tariffs in the U.K. is the low share of metering. Most users are not billed on a volumetric basis and have no financial incentive for water conservation. Since the 1990s efforts have been made to increase the share of household metering, which reached 33% in 2008.&lt;ref name="Water UK"/&gt; The Environment Agency would like to see 75% of households metered by 2025. The Fairness on Tap coalition (including [[National Trust]], [[The Waterwise Project|Waterwise]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and [[RSPB]]) is calling for the government to set out a strategy to install water meters in at least 80% of England where there is the greatest pressure on the freshwater environment and people's pockets, by 2020. Studies show that water meters lead to a 5-15% reduction in household water use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/subjects/waterres/286587/1466399/?lang=_e Environment Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;
