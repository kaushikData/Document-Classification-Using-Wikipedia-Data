"'''A Green New Deal'''" is a report released on July 21, 2008 by the Green New Deal Group and published by the [[New Economics Foundation]], which outlines a series of policy proposals to tackle [[global warming]], the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|current financial crisis]], and [[peak oil]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Lynas (July 17, 2008) "[http://www.newstatesman.com/environment/2008/07/lynas-towards-economy-climate  A Green New Deal]" ''[[New Statesman]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The report calls for the re-regulation of [[finance]] and [[taxation]], and major government investment in [[renewable energy]] sources. Its full title is: ''A Green New Deal: Joined-up policies to solve the triple crunch of the credit crisis, climate change and high oil prices''.&lt;ref&gt;New Economics Foundation, (July 21, 2008) {{cite web|url=http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/greennewdealneededforuk210708.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912041752/http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/greennewdealneededforuk210708.aspx |archivedate=2008-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main recommendations ==
* Government-led investment in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and [[microgeneration]] which would make 'every building a powerstation'.
* The creation of thousands of [[Green-collar worker|green jobs]] to enable [[low-carbon economy|low-carbon]] infrastructure reconstruction.
* A [[Windfall profits tax|windfall tax]] on the profits of oil and gas companies - as has been established in [[Norway]] - so as to provide revenue for government spending on renewable energy and energy efficiency.
* Developing financial incentives for green investment and reduced energy usage.
* Changes to the UK's financial system, including the reduction of the [[Bank of England|Bank of England's]] interest rate, once again to support green investment.
* Large financial institutions - 'mega banks' - to be broken up into smaller units and [[green banking]].
* The re-regulation of international finance: ensuring that the financial sector does not dominate the rest of the economy. This would involve the re-introduction of [[capital controls]].
* Increased official scrutiny of exotic financial products such as [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]].
* The prevention of corporate tax evasion by demanding financial reporting and by clamping down on [[tax havens]].&lt;ref&gt;David Teather (July 21, 2008) "[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/21/greenbusiness.renewableenergy  Green New Deal group calls for break-up of banks]", ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Lovell (July 21, 2008) [https://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSL204610020080721 "Climate report calls for green 'New Deal'"], [[Reuters]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riley Smith (July 31, 2008) "[http://www.celsias.com/article/group-suggests-green-new-deal-uk-fight-climate-cha/ Group Suggests a Green New Deal in the UK to Fight Climate Change] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210074907/http://www.celsias.com/article/group-suggests-green-new-deal-uk-fight-climate-cha/ |date=December 10, 2008 }}", Celsias.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amateur astronomers do not use the field of astronomy as their primary source of [[income]] or support, and usually have no [[professional degree]] in astrophysics or advanced academic training in the subject.  Most amateurs are beginners or [[hobby]]ists, while others have a high degree of experience in astronomy and may often assist and work alongside professional astronomers.&lt;ref name="Skytelescope"&gt;{{cite web

Amateur astronomers typically view the [[sky]] at night, when most celestial objects and astronomical events are visible, but others observe during the daytime by viewing [[sunspot]]s or [[solar eclipse]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=New Eyes on the Sun: A Guide to Satellite Images and Amateur Observation |first=John |last=Wilkinson |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=n7jRqTp9khUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=amateur+sunspots&amp;ots=6slmZsE4ur&amp;sig=nVMZK0xPRW8ZuGz7SfgSifNoslM#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Some just look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes or [[binoculars]], but more dedicated amateurs often use portable [[optical telescope|telescopes]] or telescopes situated in their private or club [[observatory|observatories]]. Amateurs can also join as members of amateur [[astronomical society|astronomical societies]], which can advise, educate or guide them towards ways of finding and observing celestial objects; or even promoting the science of astronomy among the general public.&lt;ref name="Motta2006"&gt;

Collectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and [[phenomenon|phenomena]].  Common targets of amateur astronomers include the [[Moon]], [[planet]]s, [[star]]s, [[comet]]s, [[meteor shower]]s, and a variety of [[deep sky object]]s such as [[star cluster]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]], and [[nebula]]e.  Many amateurs like to specialise in observing particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur [[astrophotography]], involves the taking of photos of the night sky.  Astrophotography has become more popular with the introduction of far easier to use equipment including, digital cameras, DSLR cameras and relatively sophisticated purpose built high quality [[CCD camera]]s.

Most amateur astronomers work at visible [[electromagnetic spectrum|wavelengths]], but a small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the [[visible spectrum]].  An early pioneer of [[radio astronomy]] was [[Grote Reber]], an  amateur astronomer who constructed the first purpose built [[radio telescope]] in the late 1930s to follow up on the discovery of [[radio frequency|radio wavelength]] emissions from space by [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]].  Non-visual amateur astronomy includes the use of [[infrared filter]]s on conventional telescopes, and also the use of [[radio telescope]]s.  Some amateur astronomers use home-made radio telescopes, while others use radio telescopes that were originally built for astronomical research but have since been made available for use by amateurs.  The [[One-Mile Telescope]] is one such example.

Amateur astronomers use a range of instruments to study the [[sky]], depending on a combination of their interests and resources.  Methods include simply looking at the night sky with the [[naked eye]], using [[binoculars]], and using a variety of [[optical telescope]]s of varying power and quality, as well as additional sophisticated equipment, such as [[camera]]s, to study light from the sky in both the visual and non-visual parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]].  Commercial telescopes are available, new and used, but it is also common for amateur astronomers to build (or commission the building of) their own custom telescopes.  Some people even focus on [[amateur telescope making]] as their primary interest within the hobby of amateur astronomy.

Although specialized and experienced amateur astronomers tend to acquire more specialized and more powerful equipment over time, relatively simple equipment is often preferred for certain tasks.{{according to whom|date=September 2017}} Binoculars, for instance, although generally of lower power than the majority of telescopes, also tend to provide a wider [[field of view]], which is preferable for looking at some objects in the night sky.{{according to whom|date=September 2017}}

Amateur astronomers also use [[star chart]]s that, depending on experience and intentions, may range from simple [[planisphere]]s through to detailed charts of very specific areas of the night sky.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}  A range of astronomy software is available and used by amateur astronomers, including software that generates maps of the sky, software to assist with astrophotography, observation scheduling software, and software to perform various calculations pertaining to astronomical phenomena.

Amateur astronomers often like to keep records of their observations,{{according to whom|date=September 2017}} which usually takes the form of an observing log.  Observing logs typically record details about which objects were observed and when, as well as describing the details that were seen.  Sketching is sometimes used within logs, and photographic records of observations have also been used in recent times. The information gathered is used to help studies and interactions between amateur astronomers in yearly gatherings. Although not professional information or credible,{{according to whom|date=September 2017}}{{clarify|date=September 2017}} it is a way for the hobby lovers to share their new sightings and experiences.{{according to whom|date=September 2017}}{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

The Internet is an essential tool of amateur astronomers.{{clarify|date=September 2017}} The popularity of imaging among amateurs has led to large numbers of web sites being written by individuals about their images and equipment. Much of the social interaction of amateur astronomy occurs on mailing lists or discussion groups.{{according to whom|date=September 2017}} Discussion group servers host numerous astronomy lists. A great deal of the commerce of amateur astronomy, the buying and selling of equipment, occurs online. Many amateurs use online tools to plan their nightly observing sessions, using tools such as the [[Clear Sky Chart]].{{according to whom|date=September 2017}}

== Common techniques ==
{{More citations needed|section|date=September 2017}}
While a number of interesting celestial objects are readily identified by the naked eye, sometimes with the aid of a star chart, many others are so faint or inconspicuous that technical means are necessary to locate them. Although many methods are used in amateur astronomy, most are variations of a few specific techniques.{{according to whom|date=September 2017}}

=== Star hopping ===
{{Main|Star hopping}}
'''Star hopping''' is a method often used by amateur astronomers with low-tech equipment such as binoculars or a manually driven telescope.  It involves the use of maps (or memory) to locate known landmark stars, and "hopping" between them, often with the aid of a [[finderscope]].  Because of its simplicity, star hopping is a very common method for finding objects that are close to naked-eye stars.

More advanced methods of locating objects in the sky include [[telescope mount]]s with ''setting circles'', which assist with pointing telescopes to positions in the sky that are known to contain objects of interest, and ''GOTO telescopes'', which are fully automated telescopes that are capable of locating objects on demand (having first been [[calibration|calibrated]]).

===Mobile apps===
The advent of [[mobile app]]lications for use in [[smartphones]] has led to the creation of many dedicated apps.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/technology/personaltech/stargazing-apps-for-amateur-astronomers.html Amateur Stargazing With a GPS Tour Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.space.com/37066-smartphone-astronomy-toolbox-mobile-apps.html Turn Your Smartphone into an Astronomy Toolbox with Mobile Apps]&lt;/ref&gt; These apps allow any user to easily locate celestial objects of interest by simply pointing the smartphone device in that direction in the sky. These apps make use of the inbuilt hardware in the phone, such as [[GPS]] location and [[gyroscope]]. Useful information about the pointed object like [[celestial coordinates]], the name of the object, its constellation, etc. are provided for a quick reference. Some paid versions give more information. These apps are gradually getting into regular use during observing, for the alignment process of telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/daylight-polar-alignment/ Daylight Polar Alignment Made Easy]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Setting circles ===
{{Main|Setting circles}}
'''Setting circles''' are [[angular measurement]] scales that can be placed on the two main [[Rotation around a fixed axis|rotation axes]] of some telescopes.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}  Since the widespread adoption of digital setting circles, any classical engraved setting circle is now specifically identified as an "analog setting circle" (ASC).  By knowing the [[coordinate]]s of an object (usually given in [[equatorial coordinates]]), the telescope user can use the setting circle to align (i.e., point) the telescope in the appropriate direction before looking through its [[eyepiece]].  A computerized setting circle is called a "digital setting circle" (DSC).  Although digital setting circles can be used to display a telescope's [[right ascension|RA]] and [[declination|Dec]] coordinates, they are not simply a digital read-out of what can be seen on the telescope's analog setting circles.  As with go-to telescopes, digital setting circle computers (commercial names include Argo Navis, Sky Commander, and NGC Max) contain databases of tens of thousands of celestial objects and projections of planet positions.

To find a celestial object in a telescope equipped with a DSC computer, one does not need to look up the specific RA and Dec coordinates in a book or other resource, and then adjust the telescope to those numerical readings. Rather, the object is chosen from the electronic database, which causes distance values and arrow markers to appear in the display that indicate the distance and direction to move the telescope. The telescope is moved until the two angular distance values reach zero, indicating that the telescope is properly aligned. When both the RA and Dec axes are thus "zeroed out", the object should be in the eyepiece. Many DSCs, like go-to systems, can also work in conjunction with laptop sky programs.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Computerized systems provide the further advantage of computing coordinate precession. Traditional printed sources are subtitled by the [[Epoch (astronomy)|''epoch'' year]], which refers to the positions of celestial objects at a given time to the nearest year (e.g., J2005, J2007).  Most such printed sources have been updated for intervals of only about every fifty years (e.g., J1900, J1950, J2000).  Computerized sources, on the other hand, are able to calculate the right ascension and declination of the "epoch of date" to the exact instant of observation.&lt;ref name="Argo2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cvas.cvas-north.com/Manuals/Argo%20Navis%20Manual.pdf|title=Argo Navis : User Manual 10 |page=93|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GoTo telescopes===
{{Main|GoTo (telescopes)}}
'''GOTO telescopes''' have become more popular since the 1980s as technology has improved and prices have been reduced.  With these computer-driven telescopes, the user typically enters the name of the item of interest and the mechanics of the telescope point the telescope towards that item automatically.  They have several notable advantages for amateur astronomers intent on [[research]].  For example, GOTO telescopes tend to be faster for locating items of interest than star hopping, allowing more time for studying of the object.  GOTO also allows manufacturers to add equatorial tracking to mechanically simpler alt-azimuth telescope mounts, allowing them to produce an overall less expensive product. GOTO telescopes usually have to be calibrated using alignment stars in order to provide accurate tracking and positioning. However, several telescope manufacturers have recently developed telescope systems that are calibrated with the use of built-in GPS, decreasing the time it takes to set up a telescope at the start of an observing session.

===Remote-controlled telescopes===
With the development of fast Internet in the last part of the 20th century along with advances in computer controlled telescope mounts and CCD cameras "Remote Telescope" astronomy is now a viable means for amateur astronomers not aligned with major telescope facilities to partake in research and deep sky imaging. This enables anyone to control a telescope a great distance away in a dark location. The observer can image through the telescope using CCD cameras. The digital data collected by the telescope is then transmitted and displayed to the user by means of the Internet. An example of a digital remote telescope operation for public use via the Internet is the [[Bareket observatory]], and there are telescope farms in [[New Mexico]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remote Observatories |url=http://www.nmskies.com/ |website=www.nmskies.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]] and [[Atacama Desert#Astronomical observatories|Atacama]] in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maury |first1=Alain |date= |title=SPACE : A cost effective solution for your observatory |url=http://www.spaceobs.com/en/content/download/73/6584/version/3/file/hosting-condition-telescope-chile.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imaging techniques ===
{{expand section|date=November 2013}}

Amateur astronomers engage in many imaging techniques including [[film]], [[DSLR]], [[LRGB]], and [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] [[astrophotography]]. Because CCD imagers are linear, [[image processing]] may be used to subtract away the effects of light pollution, which has increased the popularity of astrophotography in urban areas. Narrowband filters may also be used to minimize light pollution.

== Scientific research ==
Scientific [[research]] is most often not the ''main'' goal for many amateur astronomers, unlike professional astronomers.  Work of scientific merit is possible, however, and many amateurs successfully contribute to the knowledge base of professional astronomers.  Astronomy is sometimes promoted as one of the few remaining sciences for which amateurs can still contribute useful data.  To recognize this, the [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] annually gives [[Amateur Achievement Award of Astronomical Society of the Pacific|Amateur Achievement Awards]] for significant contributions to astronomy by amateurs.

The majority of scientific contributions by amateur astronomers are in the area of data collection.  In particular, this applies where large numbers of amateur astronomers with small telescopes are more effective than the relatively small number of large telescopes that are available to professional astronomers.  Several organizations, such as the [[American Association of Variable Star Observers]], exist to help coordinate these contributions.

Amateur astronomers often contribute toward activities such as monitoring the changes in brightness of [[variable star]]s and [[supernova]]e, helping to track [[asteroid]]s, and observing [[occultation]]s to determine both the shape of asteroids and the shape of the terrain on the apparent edge of the [[Moon]] as seen from Earth. With more advanced equipment, but still cheap in comparison to professional setups, amateur astronomers can measure the light spectrum emitted from astronomical objects, which can yield high-quality scientific data if the measurements are performed with due care.  A relatively recent role for amateur astronomers is searching for overlooked phenomena (e.g., [[Kreutz Sungrazers]]) in the vast libraries of digital images and other data captured by Earth and space based observatories, much of which is available over the Internet.

In the past and present, amateur astronomers have played a major role in discovering new [[comet]]s.  Recently however, funding of projects such as the [[LINEAR|Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] and [[Near Earth Asteroid Tracking]] projects has meant that most comets are now discovered by automated systems long before it is possible for amateurs to see them.

== Societies ==
{{main|List of astronomical societies}}
There are a large number of amateur [[astronomical society|astronomical societies]] around the world, that serve as a meeting point for those interested in amateur astronomy. Members range from active observers with their own equipment to "armchair astronomers" who are simply interested in the topic. Societies range widely in their goals and activities, which may depend on a variety of factors such as geographic spread, local circumstances, size, and membership. For example, a small local society located in dark countryside may focus on practical observing and [[star parties]], whereas a large one based in a major city might have numerous members but be limited by [[light pollution]] and thus hold regular indoor meetings with guest speakers instead. Major national or international societies generally publish their own [[Academic journal|journal]] or [[newsletter]], and some hold large multi-day meetings akin to a [[scientific conference]] or [[convention (meeting)|convention]]. They may also have sections devoted to particular topics, such as [[observing the Moon]] or [[amateur telescope making]].

'''Arthur Good''' (16&lt;ref name="Geneanet"/&gt; or 26&lt;ref name="BNF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalogue Général|url=http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb12058496c|website=BnF (nouvelle fenêtre)|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; August 1853 – 30 March 1928) was a French engineer,&lt;ref name="Lachapelle" /&gt; science educator, author and caricaturist who used the pen name '''Tom Tit'''.  He wrote a series of weekly articles, ''La Science Amusante'', or ''Amusing Science'', that were collected in book form and have been translated and republished in more than 130 editions in several languages.  The illustrations for his do-it-yourself scientific apparatuses have been described as [[surrealist]] [[collages]], and were an inspiration for surrealist artists such as [[Max Ernst]] and [[Joseph Cornell]].

== Personal life ==
Arthur Good was born in [[Montivilliers]], [[Seine-Maritime]], [[France]] on 16&lt;ref name="Geneanet"/&gt; or 26&lt;ref name="BNF"/&gt; August 1853. He was the son of Protestant pastor Gustave Frédéric Good (1823–1896) and Louise Stéphanie Monod (1827–1909).&lt;ref name="Geneanet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Good|url=http://gw.geneanet.org/bourelly?lang=fr&amp;p=arthur&amp;n=good|website=Geneanet|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Good graduated from the [[École Centrale Paris|École centrale des arts et manufacture]] in [[Paris]], where he studied engineering.&lt;ref name="Chemineau" /&gt;

He married Jeanne Valon (1857–1910) in Paris on 6 April 1881. They had four children.&lt;ref name="Geneanet" /&gt;

Under the pen name Tom Tit, Arthur Good wrote a series of weekly articles, ''La Science Amusante'', or ''Amusing Science'', for the French magazine ''L’Illustration''.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt; Good presented a range of physical experiments, from "simple games meant to amuse the family" to experiments "of a truly scientific character". They introduce a range of physical and scientific principles&lt;ref name="Lachapelle"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lachapelle|first1=Sofie|title=Conjuring Science: A History of Scientific Entertainment and Stage Magic in Modern France|date=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-137-49768-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HB7eCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT62|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[magnetism]] and [[surface tension]].&lt;ref name="Elder"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elder|first1=R. Bruce|title=Dada, surrealism, and the cinematic effect|date=2013|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|location=Waterloo, Ont.|isbn=978-1-55458-625-7|pages=494–495|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhXaAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA494|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Good's articles include geometrical demonstrations, craft projects, and physics experiments which can be carried out with everyday household materials.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt; In books such as ''La Récréation En Famille'' he emphasized that scientific education could be a common activity and amusement for the entire family. He dedicated ''La Science Amusante'' to one of his children, saying "In dedicating this volume today, I would like it to be a souvenir for you of the happy moments we have spent together trying the experiments and constructing the apparatuses".&lt;ref name="Lachapelle" /&gt;

Good created improvised scientific apparatuses like his ''Soap-bubble Chandelier'' using common items such as bottles, eggs, corks, candles, and soap.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt;  His constructions have an imaginative charm that has led to them being compared to surrealistic collages.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt;  Nonetheless, his drawings were seriously and carefully rendered by scientific engraver [[Louis Poyet]] (1846–1913) and his assistants.&lt;ref name="Edelman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edelman|first1=Eric|title=The Collaged World of Tom Tit|url=http://blog.retrocollage.com/collaged-world-tom-tit/|website=RetroCollage|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poyet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Le graveur du dimanche * Louis Poyet|url=http://gonefishing.over-blog.com/article-le-graveur-du-dimanche-louis-poyet-48802161.html|website=Gone Fishing|date=18 April 2010|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original columns from ''La Science Amusante'' were collected and published in a three-volume series in France. Each volume contained 100 amusements. Beginning in 1889,&lt;ref name="Lachapelle" /&gt; they have been reprinted in over 130 editions.&lt;ref name="Elder" /&gt; Collections of amusements were translated and published in English, Italian, and Spanish.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt; In the United States they appeared as ''Magical Experiments, or Science in Play'', and in England as ''Scientific Amusements''. A selection has also been republished as ''100 Amazing Magic Tricks''.&lt;ref name="Elder" /&gt;  Good's books are considered to have laid the foundations for  modern approaches to science education in their introduction of "kitchen science" and hands-on experiments for children.&lt;ref name="Buxton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Buxton |first1=Cory A. |last2=Provenzo, Jr. |first2=Eugene F. |title=Teaching Science in Elementary and Middle School: A Cognitive and Cultural Approach |publisher=Sage |year=2007 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3aqDhzUdLS4C&amp;pg=PA44 |oclc=72353389 |isbn=978-1-4129-2497-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[tennis]], "'''Battle of the Sexes'''" is a term that has been used to describe various [[exhibition match]]es played between a man and a woman (or, in one case, a [[doubles tennis|doubles match]] between two men and two women). Most famously, the term is used for a nationally televised match in 1973, held at the [[Houston Astrodome]], between 55-year-old [[Bobby Riggs]] and 29-year-old [[Billie Jean King]],&lt;ref name=rgsric&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1973/09/10/623715/riggs-to-richestake-two |last=Jares |first=Joe |title=Riggs to riches - take two |date=September 10, 1973 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which King won in three sets.&lt;ref name=ppgapton&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZdpaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AG0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4926%2C2841464 |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |agency=Associated Press |title=Billie Jean slam-bangs Riggs to defeat|date=September 21, 1973 |page=1, sec. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tshismam&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1973/10/01/618357/there-she-is-ms-america |magazine=Sports Illustrated |last=Kirkpatrick |first=Curry |title=There she is, Ms. America |date=October 1, 1973 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match attracted massive attention and was viewed by an estimated 90 million people around the world.  King's win is considered a milestone in public acceptance of [[women's tennis]].

Two other matches commonly referred to as a "battle of the sexes" include a match held four months earlier in 1973 between Riggs and [[Margaret Court]], over the best of three sets,&lt;ref name=rcmgt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=b5xRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CW0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5861%2C2150594|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |agency=Associated Press |title=Riggs "Courts" Margaret - then hustles a victory |date=May 14, 1973 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sivmysth&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1973/05/21/618331/mothers-day-ms-match |magazine=Sports Illustrated |last=Kirkpatrick |first=Curry |title=Mother's Day Ms. match |date=May 21, 1973 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one in 1992 between [[Jimmy Connors]] and [[Martina Navratilova]], over the best of three sets and hybrid rules favoring the female player, dubbed "The Battle of Champions".&lt;ref name=ergmiscu&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gFJWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_usDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2443%2C5900626 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Martina's miscues aid Connors' win |date=September 26, 1992 |page=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least eight other exhibition matches have been played between notable male and female tennis players, starting in 1888, though only some of them were referred to at the time as a "battle of the sexes".

==1973: Riggs vs. Court==
Riggs had been one of the world's top tennis players in the 1940s; he was ranked year-end [[World number 1 male tennis player rankings|World No. 1]] three times and had won six major titles during his career. After he retired from professional tennis in 1951, Riggs remained a master promoter of himself and of tennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k5ndImgQSr4C|title=Daily Comprehension: February|publisher=Remedia Publications|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, he opined that the female game was inferior and that even at his current age of 55 he could still beat any of the top female players.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news

Riggs first challenged Billie Jean King, but when she declined, Margaret Court stepped in. At the time, Court was 30 years old and in the midst of earning her seventh year-end ranking as [[World number 1 ranked female tennis players|World No. 1]] female player in the world. On the day of their match on May 13,&lt;ref name=rchcrt&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1973/05/13/page/71/article/riggs-challenges-court-in-tennis-match-today |work=Chicago Tribune |last=Husar |first=John |title=Riggs challenges Court in tennis match today |date=May 13, 1973 |page=1, sec. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5,000 fans came to the [[Mother's Day]] match in [[Ramona, California]].&lt;ref name=sivmysth/&gt;&lt;ref name=rcmgt/&gt; Televised by [[CBS Sports]],&lt;ref name=cmabbbb&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kOVVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=E-EDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2556%2C2941895 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Can middleaged Bobby back up his big boast |date=May 13, 1973 |page=3C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riggs descended the stadium steps and presented Court with Mother's Day flowers, which she accepted while curtsying.&lt;ref&gt;The Battle of the Sexes.

==1973: Riggs vs. King==
[[Image:Battle of the Sexes (Tennis).jpg|thumb|left|Paraphernalia from the Billie Jean King vs Bobby Riggs match]]
Suddenly in the national limelight following his win over Court, Riggs taunted all female tennis players, prompting King to accept a lucrative financial offer to play Riggs in a nationally televised match in [[prime time]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] that the promoters dubbed the "Battle of the Sexes."&lt;ref name=adabc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1973/09/20/page/72/article/display-ad-66-no-title |work=Chicago Tribune |title=Battle of the Sexes |agency=(advertisement) |date=September 20, 1973 |page=5, sec. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ppgrhtm&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZNpaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AG0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6889%2C2701341 |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |agency=''(New York Times)''|title=Riggs hopes to make it a King's ransom |date=September 20, 1973 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match, which had a winner-take-all prize of [[United States dollar|$]]100,000 (${{Inflation|US|100000|1973|r=-3|fmt=c}} today),&lt;ref name=ralrdywnr&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=s78SAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=s_gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7286%2C1493093 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=(Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Riggs already winner - for talking |date=September 20, 1973 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held in [[Texas]] at the [[Houston]] [[Astrodome]] on Thursday, September 20, 1973.&lt;ref name=ppgapton/&gt;&lt;ref name=hogstn&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1973/09/20/page/69/article/hogston-turns-into-roman-circus|work=Chicago Tribune |last=Markus |first=Robert |title='Hogston' turns into Roman circus|date=September 20, 1973 |page=1, sec. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ctbsxwns&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1973/09/21/page/1/article/best-man-loses |work=Chicago Tribune |last=Kleiman |first=Carol |title=Better sex wins |date=September 20, 1973 |page=1, sec. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Cecil|title=Was the "Battle of the Sexes" tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs fixed?|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2972/was-the-battle-of-the-sexes-tennis-match-between-billie-jean-king-and-bobby-riggs-fixed |work=The Straight Dope |date=December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then 29-year-old King had earned her fifth year-end ranking as [[World number 1 ranked female tennis players|World No. 1]] female player the previous year, and would finish second to Court in 1973. 

King entered the court in the style of [[Cleopatra]], on a feather-adorned [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]] carried by four bare-chested muscle men dressed in the style of ancient slaves.&lt;ref name=tshismam/&gt; Riggs followed in a [[Pulled rickshaw|rickshaw]] drawn by a bevy of models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.si.com/more-sports/2008/09/20/king-parker|title=A ray of progress for women as Battle of the Sexes turns 35|last=Roberts|first=Selena|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=September 20, 2008|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riggs presented King with a giant Sugar Daddy lollipop, and she responded by giving him a squealing [[Domestic pig|piglet]],&lt;ref name=NYTimes7.27.82/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Jesse (September 20, 2013).

King, who also competed in the [[1973 Virginia Slims of Houston|Virginia Slims of Houston]] during the same week, won in straight sets, 6–4, 6–3, 6–3.&lt;ref name=tshismam/&gt; In the first set, she fell behind 3–2 when Riggs broke her serve.&lt;ref name=kwristrsts&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hboqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ymYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6820%2C2498285 |work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |location=(Florida) |agency=Associated Press |title=King whips Riggs in straight sets |date=September 21, 1973 |page=1D}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2015 interview, she said that most people do not remember that she was initially behind in the first set, and it looked bad for her in the early going. At this point, King realized that she "had to win" given the importance of the match,&lt;ref&gt;"Billie Jean King." CNN Special Presentation—The 70s: Battle Of The Sexes. August 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and broke right back and again in the tenth game to close out the set.&lt;ref name=kwristrsts/&gt; She had learned from Court's loss and was ready for Riggs's game. Rather than playing her own usual aggressive game, King mostly stayed at the [[baseline (tennis)|baseline]], easily handling Riggs's lobs and soft shots, making him cover the entire court as she ran him from side to side and beat him at his own defensive style of play. After quickly failing from the baseline, where he had intended to play, Riggs dropped his comedic effect and showed a more serious demeanor, as he was forced to change to a [[serve-and-volley]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942736-1,00.html|title=Sport: How King Rained on Riggs' Parade|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=October 1, 1973|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few critics were less than impressed by King's victory; she was 26 years younger, and some experts claimed that it was more an age versus youth game. According to [[Jack Kramer]], "I don't think Billie Jean played all that well. She hit a lot of short balls which Bobby could have taken advantage of had he been in shape. I would never take anything away from Billie Jean—because she was smart enough to prepare herself properly—but it might have been different if Riggs hadn't kept running around. It was more than one woman who took care of Bobby Riggs in Houston."  Before the match, however, King had forced the American television network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] to drop Kramer as a commentator. King said, "He doesn't believe in women's tennis. Why should he be part of this match? He doesn't believe in half of the match. I'm not playing. Either he goes—or I go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outsports.com/tennis/2006/bjkhboreview.htm  |title=King a True Pioneer, HBO Hits an Ace with Tennis Documentary|work=OutSports.com  |last=Buzinski  |first=Jim  |accessdate=June 24, 2010  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106052456/http://www.outsports.com/tennis/2006/bjkhboreview.htm|archivedate=January 6, 2010|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the match, [[Pancho Segura]] declared that Riggs was only the third best senior player, behind himself and [[Gardnar Mulloy]], and he challenged King to another match. King refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norcal.usta.com/Multicultural-Pages/23931_Pancho_Segura__NHHM08/ |title=USTA Northern California celebrates National Hispanic Heritage Month |publisher=USTA Northern California |date= |accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The match had an audience of an estimated 50 million in the U.S. and 90 million worldwide. The attendance in the Houston Astrodome was 30,472;&lt;ref name=ppgapton/&gt; as of 2012, it remains the largest audience to see a tennis match in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/bobby-riggs-vs-billie-jean-king-44759.html |title=Bobby Riggs Vs. Billie Jean King |publisher=Essortment.com |date=|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of match-throwing===
There was also widespread speculation, based on Riggs’s unusually poor play and large number of unforced errors, that Riggs had purposely lost the match in order to win large sums of money that he had bet against himself, as a way to pay off his gambling debts.&lt;ref name=matchmaker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/9589625/the-match-maker|title=The Match Maker|author=Van Natta Jr., Don|work=ESPN|date=August 25, 2013|accessdate=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESPN's ''Outside the Lines'' on August 25, 2013 featured a man who had been silent for 40 years who said he heard several members of the mafia talking about Riggs throwing the match in exchange for cancelling his gambling debt to the mob.&lt;ref name=matchmaker/&gt; On the other hand, the article says Riggs' close friend and estate executor Lornie Kuhle vehemently denied he was ever in debt to the mob or received a payoff from them. The article also quotes Riggs' son who claims his father felt he had made a terrible mistake and was depressed for six months following the match. Riggs wanted a rematch but not King. He considered suing her as a rematch had been part of the contract. King and Riggs would appear together spoofing their rivalry less than two months after the match on an episode of ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]'' (titled "The Pig Who Came To Dinner") and they became good friends.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Kramer wrote, however, that "Billie Jean beat him fair and square. A lot of men—especially around our age—were so stunned when he lost that they figured he must have tanked. [[Don Budge|Budge]] is convinced of that. But what motive would Riggs have for that? Bobby Riggs, the biggest ham in the world, gets his greatest audience—and purposefully looks bad? There's no way. If he had beaten Billie Jean, he could have kept the act going indefinitely. Next they would have had him play [[Chris Evert|Chrissy]] on clay." Selena Roberts claimed in her book documenting the match, ''A Necessary Spectacle'', that Riggs later undertook a public polygraph test to prove he did not throw the match.&lt;ref&gt;A Necessary Spectacle. Roberts, Selena. Crown Books, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-4000-5146-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on women's tennis ===
King viewed the match as more than a publicity stunt, feeling that beating Riggs was important both for women's tennis and for the [[women's liberation]] movement as a whole. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite | last = Blattman | first = Elissa | title = "Billie Jean King and the Battle of the Sexes" | publisher = National Women's History Museum | year = 2013 | url = https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/billie-jean-king-and-battle-sexes}} &lt;/ref&gt; She said later, "I thought it would set us back 50 years if I didn't win that match. It would ruin the women's tour and affect all women's self-esteem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Billie Jean King Wins the 'Battle of the Sexes,' 40 Years Ago |url=http://www.history.com/news/billie-jean-king-wins-the-battle-of-the-sexes-40-years-ago |last=Greenspan |first=Jesse |publisher=History.com |date=September 20, 2013 |accessdate=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believed that she had a destiny to work for gender equality in sports.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |title=Billie Jean Won For All Women |url=http://www.espn.com/classic/biography/s/King_Billie_Jean.html |last=Schwartz |first=Larry |publisher=ESPN.com |accessdate=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
In 2001, ABC aired a [[television film]] about the match between King and Riggs titled ''[[When Billie Beat Bobby]]'', starring [[Holly Hunter]] and [[Ron Silver]] as King and Riggs respectively.

In 2013, New Black Films released the documentary movie ''Battle of the Sexes'' in cinemas, with television broadcast following soon after. It was directed by James Erskine and Zara Hayes. The film was released on DVD in 2014.

The 2017 film ''[[Battle of the Sexes (2017 film)|Battle of the Sexes]]'', directed by [[Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris]], is about the King/Riggs match, and stars [[Emma Stone]] and [[Steve Carell]] as King and Riggs, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/04/battle-of-the-sexes-emma-stone-billie-jean-king-steve-carell-bobby-riggs-fox-searchlight-1201412970/|title=Game, Set Match?

Though Neer was only 32, Wills won the match 6–3, 6–4.&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgi1.usatoday.com/sports/century/012899.htm |title=USA Today: This day in sports |accessdate=September 8, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151456/http://cgi1.usatoday.com/sports/century/012899.htm |archivedate=June 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RLM"&gt;{{cite book | title=Robert Lindley Murray: The Reluctant U.S. Tennis Champion | publisher=Trafford Publishing | author=Ohnsorg, Roger | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1975: Challenge of the Sexes ===

October 26, 1975 a ''Challenge of the Sexes'' event was held in Mission Viejo, CA televised on CBS. It involved male and female athletes from various sports, such as [[Laura Baugh]] and [[Jane Blalock]] vs. [[Hale Irwin]] and [[Doug Sanders]] in golf, and [[Jerry West]] vs. [[Karen Logan]] in basketball. The tennis event pitted future [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] champion [[Virginia Wade]] vs. [[Björn Borg]], and Nastase vs. [[Evonne Goolagong]]. A single set was played where the men were limited to one serve and the women had the added area of the alleys for shot placement. Borg, Wade, and Goolagong entered the court in standard attire and demeanor, while Nastase entered wearing a dress.  With Martina Navratilova also in the packed audience, Borg defeated Wade 6–3, but Goolagong defeated Nastase 7–5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/26/archives/goolagong-conquers-nastase.html |title=Goolagong ‘Conquers’ Nastase |date=1975 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1985: Battle of the Sexes: The Challenge! (doubles) ===
On August 23, 1985, at age 67, Riggs returned to the tennis spotlight when he partnered with [[Vitas Gerulaitis]], at the time a top-20 player, to launch another challenge to female players.  He challenged [[Martina Navratilova]] and [[Pam Shriver]] to a doubles match. Navratilova said that she accepted because she believed she and Pam had no weaknesses when playing doubles, and that they were going to 'do a Billie' and win, especially given Riggs' age. The match took place at [[Boardwalk Hall|The Atlantic City Convention Hall]] in Atlantic City, New Jersey.  Riggs' health had deteriorated somewhat from his last outing as he was now deaf in addition to his poor eyesight. Moreover, because Riggs was a finesse player and not a power player, the women expected that defeating him would be easier than a retired power player.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Penner|first=Mike| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-03-10/sports/sp-25857_1_bobby-riggs 
|work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Navratilova, Shriver vs. Riggs, Gerulaitis: At Least, It's Different 
|date=March 10, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riggs' return was short lived when the women won 6–3, 6–2, 6–4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1985-08-24/sports/8502040832_1_vitas-gerulaitis-navratilova-and-shriver-bobby-riggs|title=Women Win War Of Sexes

|date=August 24, 1985|accessdate=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Penner]] (of The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'') wrote: "The great misconception about 'The Challenge!' was that it might actually serve as a legitimate proving ground for the sexes." The sports writer went on to point out that there were things keeping this match from being seriously viewed as a legitimate challenge.  "First, it was a doubles match, not a one-on-one competition. The strategy is different in doubles, weaknesses can be more easily masked and stamina is not nearly so critical a factor." The other point to be made: "Riggs amounted to a 67-year-old ball-and-chain shackled to the ankle of Gerulaitis. Riggs couldn't serve, couldn't return serves, couldn't hit overheads with any amount of force. Older than the combined ages of Navratilova and Shriver, Riggs was painfully out of place in this match. Even [[John McEnroe]], on his finest day, would be an underdog against Navratilova and Shriver if Riggs were his partner."&lt;ref name="Keith W. Oliver"&gt;{{cite news|last=Penner|first=Mike|title=Tennis: Navratilova Admits she is no match for men.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-09-01/sports/sp-25868_1_navratilova-and-shriver|accessdate=September 28, 2011|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=September 1, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1998: Karsten Braasch vs. the Williams sisters ===
Another event dubbed a "Battle of the Sexes" took place during the [[1998 Australian Open]]&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/observer/osm/story/0,,543962,00.html | title=How to... beat both Williams sisters in one afternoon | work=The Guardian | date=September 2, 2001 | accessdate=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; between [[Karsten Braasch]] and the [[Williams sisters]]. [[Venus Williams|Venus]] and [[Serena Williams]] had claimed that they could beat any male player ranked outside the world's top 200, so Braasch, then ranked 203rd, challenged them both. Braasch was described by one journalist as "a man whose training regime centered around a pack of cigarettes and more than a couple bottles of ice cold [[lager]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ontennis.com/news/serena-williams-still-savouring-andy-roddick-win-16-years "Serena Williams still savouring Andy Roddick 'win' 16 years on"], OnTennis.com, posted January 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; The matches took place on court number 12 in [[Melbourne Park]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sister Act falls in Battle of Sexes|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=19980127&amp;id=kqJjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mggGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3506,5011601|accessdate=January 13, 2013|newspaper=The Free Lance Star|date=January 27, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; after Braasch had finished a round of golf and two shandies. He first took on Serena and after leading 5–0, beat her 6–1. Venus then walked on court and again Braasch was victorious, this time winning 6–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://observer.theguardian.com/osm/story/0,,543962,00.html |title=How to... beat both Williams sisters in one afternoon |date=September 1, 2001 |publisher= |accessdate=March 5, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307010545/http://observer.theguardian.com/osm/story/0%2C%2C543962%2C00.html |archivedate=March 7, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Braasch said afterwards, "500 and above, no chance". He added that he had played like someone ranked 600th in order to keep the game "fun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/1998/01/28/sport/WILLIAMS.HTM |title=Welcome to Dispatch Online |publisher=Dispatch.co.za |date=November 12, 2010 |accessdate=March 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428044804/http://www.dispatch.co.za/1998/01/28/sport/WILLIAMS.HTM |archivedate=April 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Braasch said the big difference was that men can chase down shots much easier, and that men put spin on the ball that the women can't handle. The Williams sisters adjusted their claim to beating men outside the top 350.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

=== 2003: Yannick Noah vs. Justine Henin ===
In December 2003, [[Yannick Noah]] and [[Justine Henin]] played a friendly match at the [[Forest National]] in Brussels. Noah donned a dress for much of the match. He played predominantly trick shots and slices, but still ended up winning 4–6, 6–4, 7–6.&lt;ref name="gilbert"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tennis-x.com/story/2004-01-24/c.php |title=Gilbert says Henin no match for low-ranked men |publisher=Tennis X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2013: Novak Djokovic vs. Li Na ===
In October 2013, [[Novak Djokovic]] and [[Li Na]] played a light-hearted exhibition mini set in Beijing, China to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the [[China Open (tennis)|China Open]]. Djokovic clowned to the amusement of the crowd, and at one point swapped places with a ballboy. Li was given a 30–0 advantage at the start of each service game, and she went on to win 3–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tennis.si.com/2013/10/02/djokovic-li-na-battle-of-the-sexes/|title=Djokovic, Li Na put on a show in Battle of the Sexes at China Open|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=October 10, 2013|accessdate=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges that never came to be ==

In 2013, [[Andy Murray]] responded to a [[Twitter]] user who asked whether he would consider challenging [[Serena Williams]], saying, "I’d be up for it. Why not?" Williams also reacted positively to the suggestion, remarking "That would be fun. I doubt I’d win a point, but that would be fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/10146362/Wimbledon-2013-Serena-Williams-believes-playing-Andy-Murray-in-a-battle-of-the-sexes-would-be-fun.html|title=Wimbledon 2013: Serena Williams believes playing Andy Murray in a battle of the sexes 'would be fun'|first=Simon |last=Hart|date=27 June 2013|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, [[John McEnroe]] was interviewed on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''.  At that time, McEnroe was 56 years old but still active on the seniors tennis circuit, [[Serena Williams]] was 34 years old and in the chase for a "calendar-year" Grand Slam. McEnroe mentioned to Kimmel that about 15 years prior, [[Donald Trump]] had suggested that he would like to put together a "battle of the sexes" match between McEnroe and Williams. McEnroe said he would face Williams but that Trump was not offering a big enough payout. McEnroe said that he believed he could defeat Williams in a tennis match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/11816113/John-McEnroe-I-could-still-beat-Serena-Williams.html | title=John McEnroe: I could still beat Serena Williams | first=Andrew | last=Marszal | publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=21 August 2015 | accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Besermyan''', '''Biserman''', '''Besermans''' or '''Besermens''' ({{lang-ru|бесермяне, besermyane singular: besermyanin}}, {{lang-udm|бесерманъёс}}, {{lang-tt|бисермәннәр|bisermännär}}) are a numerically small [[Finno-Ugric people|Finno-Ugric]] [[ethnic group]] in [[Russia]].

The [[Russian Empire Census]] of 1897 listed 10,800 Besermans. There were 10,000 Besermans in 1926, but the [[Russian Census (2002)|Russian Census]] of 2002 found only 3,122 of them. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demoscope.ru/weekly/2005/0187/perep04.php demoskop.ru: Alphabetical list of peoples of the Russian Empire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205042823/http://www.demoscope.ru/weekly/2005/0187/perep04.php |date=2012-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Besermyan live in the districts of [[Yukamensky District|Yukamenskoye]], [[Glazovsky District|Glazov]], [[Balezinsky District|Balezino]], and [[Yarsky District|Yar]] in the northwest of [[Udmurtia]]. There are ten villages of pure Besermyan ethnicity in Russia, and 41 villages with a partial Besermyan population.

The language of the Besermyan is a [[dialect]] of the [[Udmurt language]] with [[Tatar language|Tatar]] influences.

Some Besermyan traditions differ from other Udmurtian customs due to the Islamic influence during the [[Volga Bulgaria]] and [[Khanate of Kazan]] periods.

The '''Baboa people''' (singular ''Boa'', also ''Ababua'', ''Ababwa'', ''Babua'', ''Babwa'', ''Bwa'') are an ethnic group in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].
They speak the [[Bwa language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |work=Ethnologue
 |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baboa live in the savanna region in the north of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
They are in close contact with the [[Mangbetu people|Mangbetu]] and [[Zande people|Zande]] peoples.&lt;ref name=zyama/&gt;
Most of the inhabitants of the [[Bas-Uele District]], with a population of 900,000 in 2007, are Boa.
They live mainly through subsistence farming and hunting, with some river commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Baboa are known for their masks, which are thought to be used to enhance a warrior's courage before battle and in ceremonies to celebrate victories.
The Boa carve statues designed to ward off evil.
They also make harps where the neck has a carved human head, or the whole body represents a male or female figure.&lt;ref name=zyama/&gt;
Between 1903 and 1910 the Baboa were in rebellion against the Belgian colonial occupiers of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Burns Club of Atlanta''', officially organized in 1896, is a [[Gentlemen's club|private social club]] and literary and cultural society commemorating the works and spirit of the 18th century national poet of Scotland, [[Robert Burns]]. In addition to holding monthly meetings, the club has held a [[Burns supper]] celebration on the anniversary of Burns' birthday every year since 1898. Club events are held in the Atlanta Burns Cottage, a 1911 replica of [[Burns Cottage|poet Robert Burns' birthplace]] in [[Alloway]], [[Ayrshire]], Scotland. The Cottage has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as '''Burns Cottage''' since 1983.

==History==
The [[Burns Clubs|Burns Club]] of [[Atlanta]] is fifty-third in seniority among several hundred organizations recognized by the Scottish-based World Burns Federation. Officially organized on January 25, 1896, the centennial year of Robert Burns’ birth, the Burns Club of Atlanta is quite possibly the city’s oldest surviving cultural and literary society. As early as the 1870s, Burns admirers in Atlanta had been meeting in private homes and hotels to celebrate the birthday of the Scottish poet. Shortly after the club’s formation, plans were made to construct for a clubhouse an exact replica of Robert Burns' birthplace in [[Alloway]], [[Ayrshire]], Scotland. Situated in the [[East Atlanta]] neighborhood of [[Ormewood Park]], construction for the Atlanta Burns Cottage was completed in 1911.

The moving spirit behind the club’s founding was Joseph Jacobs, the Atlanta pharmacist and drug-store owner at whose suggestion [[Coca-Cola]] was first carbonated. He served the very first Coca-Cola beverage from his fountain in the [[Five Points (Atlanta)|Five Points]] neighborhood of Atlanta. Of German Jewish parentage, Dr. Jacobs illustrates the universal appeal of Robert Burns’ poetry.

==A tradition of socially diverse membership==
Since its organization, the club’s membership has included governors, college presidents, farmers, teachers, clergymen, engineers, lawyers, doctors, artists, salesmen and tradesmen. Membership is limited by space in the Cottage to 100 members. Following club tradition, membership is only open to males. However, non-member male and female guests are frequent and many and are welcome by invitation.

==Literature and fellowship==
Monthly meetings in the Atlanta Burns Cottage feature readings from Burns’ works and various lectures given by visiting scholars, authorities and members. Previous lecturers include Atlanta author [[Margaret Mitchell]] and Scottish entertainer and goodwill ambassador, Sir [[Henry Lauder]]. Monthly meetings are noted for relaxed companionship and spirited, yet informal, discussion. Every meeting concludes with the traditional Scottish farewell observance of “circling up” and singing “[[Auld Lang Syne]].”

==The Atlanta Burns Cottage==
[[File:Burns Cottage, Alloway 428032.jpg|thumb|250px|Burns Cottage, built by [[William Burnes]] at Alloway, Scotland.]]
The Burns Club of Atlanta retains the honor of having as their clubhouse the only reproduction in the world of [[Robert Burns]]' birth home.

After the turn of the 20th century the club began an effort to obtain land and erect a cottage to be used as a clubhouse. In 1907 the club purchased {{convert|15|acre|m2}} in what is now the [[Ormewood Park]] neighborhood of Atlanta, at the end of the trolley line on “Dogwood Hill” across from the Confederate Veterans Home on Confederate Avenue (now the site of the Georgia Highway Patrol headquarters).

Atlanta architect and member, Thomas H. Morgan, obtained the exact measurements of the original Burns cottage in [[Alloway]], Scotland, and prepared plans for the Atlanta replica. Construction of the building was supervised by Robert McWhirter, a member of the club and a skilled stonemason, and was finished in 1911 using quarried granite from nearby [[Stone Mountain]] instead of traditional mortar and rubble construction found in Burns’ birth home.

The originally [[thatch]]ed, but now-shingled, roof has shallow eaves and gables that connect directly to the chimneys. The three fireplaces in the cottage are constructed of random stones with mortar joints raised and rounded. The fireplace in the center of the cottage features an inset stone plaque in memory of Burns. Of the three doors on the front of the cottage, only one is used. The cottage’s uncommonly small windows reflect one particular Scottish practice of taxation in which homeowners were taxed according to the dimensions of their home’s window openings. 
The low, one-story building is generally rectangular, but is slightly curved, as was the original, which accommodated the curve of the road it was built along. The interior of the house is also a close replica of the Scottish cottage, and was divided into the traditional three areas: butt, ben and [[byre]].

The cottage is managed by a caretaker who lives on the grounds.

==Scottish vernacular architecture: butt, ben and byre==
One now enters the Atlanta Burns Cottage through the [[byre]], the Scots word for the portion of the cottage where, in Burn’s original birthplace, animals and farm stuffs were housed. Members of the club now use this room for their monthly meetings. While the club is primarily a literary society, many of the members share Burns’ Scottish heritage and display their [[clan]] [[tartan]] banners along with several plaques and bas-relief panels situated on plastered walls.

To the immediate left is the ben, the innermost room of the family dwelling. Originally there was no door between the living quarters and the byre. The ben represents the combined living room and dormitory for the large Burns family. In the Atlanta Burns Cottage it functions as additional space for club events.

To the far left is found the butt, or the outer room used as kitchen, dining room and parent’s bedroom. The fireplace/stove, cabinet, and plate rack found within this room faithfully portray the original cottage furnishings. The room also features a box-[[bed]] that recreates the bed in which Robert Burns was born. The room is now used as an office and space for directors’ meetings. Almost a century of Atlanta Burns Club presidents’ portraits hang on the walls.

==Other architectural additions and alterations==
The only remaining outbuilding is a one-story stone [[Property caretaker|caretaker]]'s house, originally a log cabin. It was redesigned in 1969 to bear a closer resemblance to the cottage. The grounds once included a dance pavilion, [[barbecue]] pit, a tennis court and putting green for club use. Changes to Burns Cottage include the rear additions of a kitchen, interior porch, restrooms and an external wooden platform used for social events. Other alterations include the replacement of stone-flagged floors with finished concrete, an additional fireplace in the byre and the sealing up of several small windows.

[[Crime]] is among the most urgent concerns facing [[Mexico]], as Mexican [[drug trafficking]] rings play a major role in the flow of [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and [[marijuana]] transiting between [[Latin America]] and the [[United States]]. Drug trafficking has led to [[Political corruption|corruption]], which has had a deleterious effect on Mexico's Federal Representative Republic. Drug trafficking and [[organized crime]] have also been a major source of [[violent crime]] in Mexico.

Mexico has experienced increasingly high [[crime rates]], especially in major urban centers. The country's great economic polarization has stimulated criminal activity mainly in the lower [[socioeconomic]] strata, which include the majority of the country's population. Crime continues at high levels, and is repeatedly marked by violence, especially in the cities of [[Tijuana]] and [[Ciudad Juárez]], and the states of [[Baja California]], [[Durango]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Guerrero]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Michoacán]], [[Tamaulipas]], and [[Nuevo León]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=El narco se expande en México |url=http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=937be705b8bb9a53102ce6df63c36ec1 |accessdate=7 October 2011 |newspaper=New America Media |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125160412/http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=937be705b8bb9a53102ce6df63c36ec1 |archivedate=November 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other metropolitan areas have lower, yet still serious, levels of crime. Low apprehension and conviction rates contribute to the high crime rate. Since many crimes go unreported, the rates may be much higher than reported by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/news/121597/LA0654.html |title=Mexico City crime rate rises sharply |date=December 15, 1997 |publisher=AP/[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]] |access-date=2006-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323191411/http://lubbockonline.com/news/121597/LA0654.html |archive-date=2006-03-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The murder rate in 2015 was 14 per 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/murders-jumped-8-7-in-mexico-in-2015-first-increase-since-2011-1453400801|title=Murders Jumped 8.7% in Mexico in 2015; First Increase Since 2011|first=Juan|last=Montes|date=22 January 2016|accessdate=17 July 2017|website=Wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the crime is committed by a small proportion of the population involved in the drug trade with about half of murders drug related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-staggering-death-toll-of-mexicos-drug-war/|title=The Staggering Death Toll of Mexico's Drug War|website=Pbs.org|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assault and theft make up the vast majority of crimes. While urban areas tend to have higher crime rates, as is typical in most countries, the [[United States–Mexico border]] has also been a problematic area. In 2017, Mexico witnessed a record number of murders  with 29,158 homicides recorded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yahoo.com/news/cancun-safe-14-killed-brutal-115228767.html Is Cancun Safe? 14 Killed in Brutal Crime Spree at Mexican Resort Town] Brendan Cole, [[Newsweek]], April 13, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico is Latin America's most dangerous country for [[journalist]]s according to the Global Criminality Index 2016. A large number of these crimes go unpunished, which has led to campaigns in the press and demonstrations highlighting the supposed 'impunity' of those responsible for murdering investigative journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://leakofnations.com/reporters-murder-in-mexico-revives-outrage-over-violence-against-journalists-mexico-journalist-shootings-chihuahua/|title=Reporter’s Murder in Mexico Revives Outrage over Violence against Journalists|website=leakofnations.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Mexico had a murder rate of 21.5 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; There were a total of 26,037 murders in Mexico in 2012.&lt;ref name=UNODC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/index.html|title=UNODC: Global Study on Homicide|website=Unodc.org|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Between 2000 and 2013, 215,000 people in Mexico were murdered. By 2013 there were only 30,800 people incarcerated for murder, showing that there is a large number of murders that go unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/mexico-crime-rates-2015-9?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=Mexico's president appears to be fudging numbers about the biggest threat to the country|website=Uk.businessinsider.com|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, Mexico suffered its deadliest month since it started keeping such data in 1997, with 2,371 murder investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-violence/mexico-suffers-deadliest-month-on-record-2017-set-to-be-worst-year-idUSKBN1DL2Z6?il=0|title=Mexico suffers deadliest month on record, 2017 set to be worst year|website=Reuters.com|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2017 was Mexico's deadliest year on record, with 31,174 murders recorded, leading to a murder rate of 25 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2017, compared with 19.4 in 2011. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexico-homicides-2017-previously-thought-56923297|title=Mexico had more homicides in 2017 than previously thought|website=ABC News|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018, Mexico broke the previous deadliest month on record set in October with 2,530 reported cases of intentional homicides during the month, or 93 per day. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/may-homicide-numbers-worst-on-record/|title=Another record month: May homicide numbers worst ever seen|website=Mexico News Daily|accessdate=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drug-War Related Murders in Mexico 2006-2011.png|thumb|450px|Drug-war related murders in Mexico, 2006–2011.]]
The United States is a lucrative market for  [[drug trafficking|illegal drugs]]. The [[United Nations]] estimates that nearly 90% of [[cocaine]] sold in the United States originates in [[South America]] and is smuggled through Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| contribution=Mexico's Drug Cartels| title=CRS Report for Congress| editor-first=Colleen W.| editor-last=Cook| coeditors=| publisher=Congressional Research Service| place=| page=9| date=October 16, 2007| id= | contribution-url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL34215.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico is the largest foreign supplier of [[marijuana]] and the largest source of [[heroin]] for the U.S. market. The majority of methamphetamine sold in the United States is made in Mexico, and Mexican-run [[methamphetamine]] labs that operate north of the border account for much of the remainder.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==== Drug cartels ====
Mexican [[drug cartel]]s play a major role in the flow of [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and [[marijuana]] transiting between [[Latin America]] and the [[United States]]. These drug cartels often use Mexican-American and other Latino gangs to distribute their narcotics in United States.

Mexican drug cartels also have ties to [[Colombia]]n drug traffickers, and other international organized crime. A sharp spike in drug-related violence has some analysts worrying about the 'Colombianization' of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8444216/site/newsweek/from/RL.3/ |title=Losing the Battle: A sharp spike in drug-related violence has some analysts worrying about the 'Colombianization' of Mexico |publisher=Newsweek International |author=Contreras, Joseph }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Domestic production of illegal drugs ====
[[File:Drugpackscorpion.png|float|thumb|300px|Bricks of [[cocaine]], a form in which it is commonly transported.]]
Some illegal drugs are also produced in Mexico, including significant amounts of [[opium poppy]], and marijuana in the western [[Sierra Madre Occidental|Sierra Madre]] Mountains region.&lt;ref name="unodc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr/WDR_2009/WDR2009_eng_web.pdf|format=PDF|title=WORLD DRUG REPORT 2009|website=Unodc.org|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mexico has increasingly become a major producer of amphetamines and other synthetic drugs in the North American market (e.g. [[Crystal meth|crystal]]), especially in the states of Guerrero, Michoacán, Jalisco and the Distrito Federal.&lt;ref name="unodc.org"/&gt; Since early 2007, the export of manufactured drugs has been controlled by the Beltran-Leyva brothers (Sonora-Sinaloa-DF) and "la Familia de Michoacán". These two crime groups have controlled the corridors from the deep sea port of [[Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán|Lázaro Cárdenas]] in Michoacán, where precursor products to manufacture synthetic drugs are imported from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Leticia Díaz, Gloria. 2009.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Domestic consumption of illegal drugs ====
Marijuana, crack cocaine, [[methamphetamine]], and other drugs are increasingly consumed in Mexico, especially by youths in urban areas and northern parts of the country.&lt;ref name="encuesta-2002"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/continuas/sociales/salud/2004/Ena02.pdf? |author1=Instituto Nacional de Estadística |author2=Geografía e Informática |title=Encuesta Nacional de Adicciones 2002 | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corruption ===
{{Main article|Corruption in Mexico}}

High levels of corruption in the police, judiciary, and government in general have contributed greatly to the crime problem. Corruption is a significant obstacle to Mexico's achieving a stable democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bailey, John |title=The Mexico Project |publisher=Center for Latin American Studies, Georgetown University |date=2000–2002 |url=http://clas.georgetown.edu/mexico/grants/crime.htm |accessdate=2006-06-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901123617/http://clas.georgetown.edu/mexico/grants/crime.htm |archivedate=2006-09-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico is ranked the 123rd least corrupt country in the world which makes them less corrupt than  [[Moldova]] and more corrupt than [[Laos]]. This is according to the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], which is based on 13 different surveys and includes police, business, and political corruption.

==== Corruption in law enforcement ====
[[File:Marcha “Júrame que no te rindes” 56.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The [[2014 Iguala mass kidnapping|mass kidnapping of the 43 students]] in [[Iguala]] on September 26, 2014 triggered a nationwide protest]]
The organization of police forces in Mexico is complex; each police force has a different level of jurisdiction and authority, and those levels often overlap. The ''[[Attorney General (Mexico)|Procuraduría General de la República]]'' (Federal Attorney General's office) along with the law enforcement agencies ''[[Federal Preventative Police|Policia Federal Preventiva]]'' and ''[[Agencia Federal de Investigación]]'', has responsibility for overseeing law enforcements across the entire country. In addition, there are several police organizations at the state, district, and city level. Since pay is generally poor (U.S.$285–$400 per month), police officers are more likely to accept bribes to protect criminals or ignore crime entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/mexico/national_security/mexico_national_security_police_and_law_enfor~516.html |title=Mexico Police and Law Enforcement Organizations  |publisher=Photius}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement personnel are often presented with the option of choosing "''Plata o Plomo''"; meaning they can either accept a bribe (''plata'', for silver) or they will be killed (''plomo'', for lead).

Corruption plagues the various levels of police, and is frequently difficult to track down and prosecute since police officers may be protected by district attorneys and other members of the judiciary. The problem is especially pronounced in northern border areas such as Tijuana, where police are engaged by drug traffickers to protect and enforce their illicit interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drugwar.com/pcopdrugcorruption.shtm |title=Police Drug Corruption |publisher=Drugwar.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030152611/http://www.drugwar.com/pcopdrugcorruption.shtm |archivedate=2013-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mexican police force often do not investigate crimes, will generally randomly select someone to be the guilty party then fabricate the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/26/international/americas/26juarez.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;ex=1127707200&amp;en=e609066414d8b169&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage|title=In Mexico's Murders, Fury Is Aimed at Officials | publisher=New York Times | first=Ginger|last=Thompson|date=September 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is a major problem throughout Mexico as many of the actual police force are the ones involved in the crimes or are trying to cover up their poor police work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://destination-guides.mexico-travelers.com/1483/mexico-rights-watchdog-says-police-torture-persists/ |title= Mexico Police Torture persists |publisher= Reuters News Alerts |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151003001436/http://destination-guides.mexico-travelers.com/1483/mexico-rights-watchdog-says-police-torture-persists |archivedate= 2015-10-03 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Corruption in the judiciary ====
A [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] undertook a mission to Mexico in 2002 to investigate reports by the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] that the country's [[judiciary]] and administration of law was not independent.&lt;ref name="un-humanrights"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usmex.ucsd.edu/research/justice_pdfs/cumaraswamy_report.pdf |title=Civil and Political Rights: Independence of the Judiciary, Administration of Justice, and Impunity |publisher=U.N. Commission on Human Rights |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003034002/http://usmex.ucsd.edu/research/justice_pdfs/cumaraswamy_report.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of his visit to a number of cities, the rapporteur observed that corruption in the judiciary had not been reduced significantly. One of the principal issues is that, because the federal courts operate at a relatively high level, most citizens are compelled to seek justice in the inadequate state courts.&lt;ref name="un-humanrights"/&gt;

Additionally, the rapporteur expressed concerns about such issues as disorganization in the [[Lawyer|legal profession]], difficulties and harassment faced by lawyers, poor [[Trial (law)|trial]] procedures, poor access to the justice system for [[indigenous peoples]] and minors, and lacklustre [[Detective|investigation]] of many crimes.&lt;ref name="un-humanrights"/&gt;

=== Violent crime against journalists ===
{{Further information|List of journalists killed in Mexico}}
[[File:Demonstration against Javier Valdez murdering - May 16 2017 - Mexico City 05.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Demonstration against the murder of [[Javier Valdez Cárdenas]] in May 2017]]
A significant increase in violent crime against journalists has been encountered in the country in recent years.&lt;ref name=Cevallos/&gt; Although the problem has existed since at least 1970, the amount of violence against journalist has intensified since the beginning of the [[Mexican Drug War]], with at least 90 journalists murdered or disappeared in Mexico since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cpj.org/|title=Press Freedom Online|website=cpj.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/12/22/572822696/number-of-journalists-killed-in-mexico-reaches-historical-high-report-says|title=Number Of Journalists Killed In Mexico Reaches 'Historical High,' Report Says|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few of the perpetrators have been brought to justice. One of the more prominent cases was that of syndicated columnist [[Francisco Arratia|Francisco Arratia Saldierna]], a prominent and well-known journalist who wrote a column called ''Portavoz'' (or "Spokesman"). The column featured topics such as corruption, organized crime, and drug trafficking.&lt;ref name="hayward"&gt;{{cite news | first=Susana | last=Hayward | title=Mexican journalists seek justice in deaths of colleagues | date=2004-09-07 | publisher=Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arratia's murder, which was particularly brutal, and others like it, sparked demands from other journalists that then-President [[Vicente Fox]] do more to enforce security and bring those responsible for the murders to justice. In 2004, a group of 215 reporters and editors sent an urgent letter to President Fox and other federal authorities, demanding that they address these concerns. The letter represented a massive communication effort coming from professionals from 19 of the nation's 31 states. The key demand was that violent crimes against journalists be made federal crimes, so they would be investigated and prosecuted by federal officers and not by local officials whom the letter claims could be the same people who commit the crimes.&lt;ref name="hayward"/&gt;

The effect of these crimes has been the self-censorship of many journalists, due to fears of retribution from criminals.&lt;ref name=Cevallos/&gt; The situation has earned attention from prominent global organizations such as the office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) and the Center for Journalism and Public Ethics (CEPET). Amerigo Incalcaterra of the OHCHR advocated the protection of journalists and the preservation of [[freedom of speech]], calling it "essential for the consolidation of democracy and the [[rule of law]] in this country".&lt;ref name=Cevallos&gt;{{cite news | first=Diego | last=Cevallos | title=WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY-MEXICO: 5 YEARS, 15 JOURNALISTS KILLED | date=2006-05-02 | publisher=IPS – Inter Press Service/Global Information Network }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violence against women ===
{{Further information|Violence against women in Mexico|Human trafficking in Mexico}}

As of 2014, Mexico has the 16th highest rate of homicides committed against women in the world.&lt;ref name=femicide&gt;{{cite web|title=Femicide and Impunity in Mexico: A context of structural and generalized violence|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/ngos/CDDandCMDPDH_forthesession_Mexico_CEDAW52.pdf|format=PDF|website=2.ohchr.org|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rate has been on the rise since 2007.&lt;ref name=femicide/&gt;

According to the 2013 Human Rights Watch, many women do not seek out legal redress after being victims of domestic violence and sexual assault because "the severity of punishments for some sexual offenses contingent on the "chastity" of the victim" and "those who do report them are generally met with suspicion, apathy, and disrespect."&lt;ref name=worldreport&gt;{{cite web|last=Human Rights Watch|title=World Report 2013: Mexico|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/mexico?page=2|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1997 study by Kaja Finkler, domestic abuse "is embedded in gender and marital relations fostered in Mexican women's dependence on their spouses for subsistence and for self-esteem, sustained by ideologies of romantic love, by family structure and residential arrangements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finkler|first=Kaja|title=Gender, domestic violence and sickness in Mexico.|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=1997|volume=45|issue=8|pages=1147–1160|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(97)00023-3}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 March 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efforts to combat crime ==

=== Law enforcement initiatives ===
{{Main article|Law enforcement in Mexico}}

[[File:En Zocalo.JPG|thumb|400px|Armed police at the [[Zócalo]], Mexico City.]]
Mexican law enforcement is divided between federal, state, and municipal entities. Estimates range between 1,600 and 3,000 different police forces in total. There are over 350,000 police agents in Mexico.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

At all levels, policing in Mexico tends to maintain separate forces for patrol/response (preventive) policing on the one hand and investigative (judicial) policing on the other.

==== Federal forces at the border ====
In June 2005, the government deployed federal forces to three [[States of Mexico|states]] to contain surging violence linked to organized crime. At a news conference in Mexico City, presidential spokesman [[Rubén Aguilar]] told reporters that the new deployment was the result of evidence that organized crime has penetrated some local police departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kristv.com/global/story.asp?s=3469106 |title=Mexico deploys federal forces against organized crime along border |date=June 13, 2005 |publisher=KRISTV.COM }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Technology in Tijuana ====
In response to a rise in violent crime in the region of [[Tijuana]], considered one of the five most violent areas of the country by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], mayor [[Jorge Hank Rhon]] deployed a massive technology update to the city's police force in February 2006.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The technology includes surveillance equipment, handheld computers, and alarm systems. Since tourism is a staple of the economy in Tijuana, the mayor has tried to make reforms to highlight the safety of tourist areas.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}Tijuana has installed a sophisticated public-security system that is the envy of police departments around the world, but city officials don't seem to know details about how it is funded or the background of the company that supplied it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A $15.5M Surveillance System for Tijuana, But Who Paid for It?|url = http://www.securityinfowatch.com/news/10550353/a-155m-surveillance-system-for-tijuana-but-who-paid-for-it|website = SecurityInfoWatch.com|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political initiatives ===
President [[Vicente Fox]] took power in December 2000 promising to crack down on crime and improve a [[judicial system]] rife with corruption and ineptitude.

During the first three years of Fox's government, the official number of reported kidnappings showed a slight decrease, from 505 in 2001 to 438 in 2003.

==== Cooperation with the United States ====
In 1996, Mexico changed its policy to allow [[extradition]] of its citizens to the United States to face [[trial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexico to allow extradition to U.S. |author=LaGesse, David |publisher=The Press Enterprise (Riverside, Ca.) |date=March 29, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution]] had forbidden its citizens to be extradited.

In 2005, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] defended efforts by the two countries to reduce violence and drug trafficking on the border following decisions by governors in the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]] to declare an emergency in their border counties. The two governors stated that the federal government's inability to control crime and violence related to illegal immigration had forced them to take matters into their own hands. The Mexican government criticized the emergency declarations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/20050816-1430-wst-borderemergency.html |title=State Department defends U.S. and Mexico crime-fighting on border |author=Talhelm, Jennifer |publisher=San Diego Union-Tribune |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219232542/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/20050816-1430-wst-borderemergency.html |archivedate=2005-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. state of [[Texas]] and Mexican police officials held a conference in [[San Antonio]] to discuss ways of coordinating efforts to stop crime but there are questions about how successful the program will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oag.state.tx.us/newspubs/newsarchive |title=Texas Attorney General – Press release archives|website=Oag.state.tx.us|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Mexican police officials in border towns have been targets of assassination by drug cartels, who have even threatened local law enforcement in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Murder money &amp; Mexico |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/mexico/etc/cron.html|website=Pbs.org|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug cartels have even acquired equipment like Mexican Army uniforms, [[Humvees]], grenades and .50 calibre sniper rifles which can penetrate most light armour including armoured cars.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The United States ambassador launched a formal complaint with the government on this issue.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

In January 2003, the security consulting company of former [[New York City]] Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] was hired by business leaders to come up with a plan to clean up Mexico City, which has the second-highest crime rate in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2659301.stm |title=Giuliani targets Mexico crime wave |publisher=BBC |date=January 14, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; If such a plan was developed, it was either not implemented or not effective.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Further information about the plan was not provided by the government nor Giuliani.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

=== Social initiatives ===
==== Protest march against crime ====
[[File:8 de Mayo Marcha Nacional por la Paz. (5702359414).jpg|thumb|190px|[[2011 Mexican protests]] against cartel violence and government [[Political corruption|disregard]]]]
In June 2004, at least a million people marched through the Mexican capital and other cities to protest the failure of federal and local governments to control crime in one of the world's most crime-ridden countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-06/28/content_343322.htm |title=Huge march against crime wave |newspaper=[[China Daily]] |date=June 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a second civilian protest was made after independent [[NGO]]s exhorted the public, again, at least one million people attended over Mexico City and other major cities all across Mexico. On this second march candles were lit and the national anthem was played. The protest generated more public attention perhaps because in this same year, a 12-year-old son of the Marti family, owners of a prominent well-known sports gear business, was abducted and murdered. In the same year, a similar situation occurred to the 19-year-old daughter of Nelson Vargas, a businessman and former government representative. These two cases brought great public attention since the scale of crime and violence was very rare to hit over certain social groups, being these amongst the most remarkable exemptions.

=== Human rights violations ===
In its effort to combat crime, the Mexican army was accused of crimes against of humanity by several NGOs. In September 2014, several Mexican human rights groups and [[International Federation for Human Rights]], had filed a complaint with the office of the prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Court]], asking it to investigate the “systematic and widespread” abuse of thousands of civilians by the army and the police in their fight against organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=Mexican Rights Groups File Suit for ‘Systematic and Widespread’ Abuse by Army and Police|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/world/americas/mexican-rights-groups-file-suit-for-systematic-and-widespread-abuse-by-army-and-police.html|date=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Curtiss "Steve" Stephenson''' (August 21, 1891 &amp;ndash; June 28, 1966) was a convicted murderer and rapist, who in 1923 was appointed [[Grand Dragon]] (state leader) of the [[Indiana Klan|branch of the Ku Klux Klan]] in [[Indiana]] and head of Klan recruiting for seven other states. Later that year, he led those groups to independence from the [[Ku Klux Klan|national KKK organization]]. Amassing wealth and political power in Indiana politics, he was one of the most prominent national Klan leaders. "He was viewed as responsible for reviving the Klan and widening its base, and considered the most powerful man in Indiana".&lt;ref name=CL&gt;Criminal Law Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012, John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder&lt;/ref&gt; He had close relationships with numerous Indiana politicians, especially Governor [[Edward L. Jackson]].

In 1925 Stephenson was tried and convicted (''[[Stephenson v. State]]'') for the notorious [[Kidnapping|abduction]], [[rape]], and [[murder]] of a young white woman, [[Madge Oberholtzer]], a state education official. His trial, conviction and imprisonment ended the portrayal of Klan leaders as law abiding. "The case and its fallout effectively destroyed the Klan in Indiana, and it may have reversed its ascendency as a national political force."&lt;ref name=CL/&gt; Denied a [[pardon]] by Governor Jackson, in 1927 he started talking with reporters for the ''[[Indianapolis Times]]'' and released a list of elected and other officials who had been in the pay of the Klan. This led to a wave of [[indictment]]s in Indiana, more national [[scandal]]s, the rapid loss of tens of thousands of members, and the end of the second wave of Klan activity in the late 1920s.

==Early life and education==
Stephenson was born in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] on August 21, 1891, and moved as a child with his family to [[Maysville, Oklahoma]]. After some public schooling, he started work as a printer's apprentice and was active in the [[Populist Party of America|Populist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indianahistory.org/our-collections/collection-guides/d-c-stephenson-collection-1922-1978.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], he enlisted in the [[United States Army|Army]] and completed officers' training. He never served overseas, but his training proved useful when he organized and led groups.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;

==Klansman==

{{see also|Indiana Klan}}
In 1920 at the age of 29, he moved to [[Evansville, Indiana]], where he worked for a retail coal company. He joined the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and in 1922, ran unsuccessfully for a Democratic [[United States House of Representatives|Congressional]] nomination.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Ralph D.; ''Indiana History: A Book of Readings'' (1995), p 306. Indiana: Indiana University Press. {{ISBN|0-253-32629-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to have already "married and abandoned two wives" before settling in Evansville.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a1eSbL0kxk8C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Leonard J. Moore, ''Citizen Klansmen: The Ku Klux Klan in Indiana, 1921-1928''], Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1997, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph M. Huffington, whom the [[Ku Klux Klan]] had sent from Texas as an agent for organizing in Evansville, recruited Stephenson to the group's inner circle. The historian Leonard Moore characterized them as both young men on the make. The Evansville Klavern became the most powerful in the state, and Stephenson soon contributed to attracting numerous new members. More than 5,400 men, or 23 percent of the native-born white men in [[Vanderburgh County, Indiana|Vanderburgh County]], ultimately joined the Klan.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;

Building on the momentum, Stephenson set up a base in [[Indianapolis]], where he helped create the Klan's state newspaper, ''Fiery Cross''. He quickly recruited new agents and organizers, building on news about the organization. [[Protestantism|Protestant]] ministers were offered free membership. In Indiana from July 1922 to July 1923, nearly 2,000 new members joined the Klan each week.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (1997), ''Citizen Klansmen'', pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hiram Wesley Evans]], who led recruiting for the national organization, maintained close ties to state leaders throughout 1921-1922 and he was especially close to Stephenson, because by then, Indiana had the largest state Klan organization. Stephenson backed Evans in November 1922 when he unseated [[William Joseph Simmons|William J. Simmons]] as [[Imperial Wizard]] of the national KKK. Evans had ambitions to make the Klan a political force in the country.

After Evans won, he officially appointed Stephenson as [[Grand Dragon]] of Indiana.  Privately he made him head of recruiting for seven other states north of [[Mississippi]]. In the 1920s, Klan membership grew dramatically in these states. In Indiana, membership grew to nearly 250,000 or about one third of all white males in the state. Stephenson acquired great wealth and political power by leading the Klan; agents received a portion of fees paid by new recruits, and he began to wield other powers.&lt;ref&gt;Rory McVeighn, "Structural incentives for conservative mobilization: Power devaluation and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, 1915–1925" ''Social Forces'' (1999) 77#4 pp: 1461-1496.&lt;/ref&gt; Evans, who had a monopoly on the sale of Klan uniforms and paraphernalia, appointed Stephenson as Grand Dragon of the Indiana Klan at a 1923 [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] gathering of the Klan in [[Kokomo, Indiana]], with more than 100,000 members and their families in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (1997), ''Citizen Klansmen'', pp. 17-19&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;My worthy subjects, citizens of the Invisible Empire, Klansmen all, greetings. It grieves me to be late. The President of the United States kept me unduly long counseling on matters of state. Only my plea that this is the time and the place of my coronation obtained for me surcease from his prayers for guidance.&lt;ref name="Lutholtz"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Encouraged by his success, in September 1923, Stephenson severed his ties with the existing national organization of the KKK, and formed a rival KKK that was made up of the chapters which he led. That year Stephenson changed his affiliation from the Democratic to [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|the Republican Party]], which was predominant in Indiana and much of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. He notably supported Republican [[Edward L. Jackson]], who was rumored to be a Klan member, when Jackson ran (successfully) for governor in 1924. Stephenson was noted for having claimed, "I am the law in Indiana."&lt;ref name="Lutholtz"/&gt; 

Shortly after, he made this remark on 12 May 1924 at an assembly in the Cadle Tabernacle in Indianapolis:&lt;blockquote&gt;"God help the man who issues a proclamation of war against the Klan in Indiana now ... We are going to Klux Indiana as she has never been Kluxed before ... I'll appeal to the ministers of Indiana to do the praying for the Ku Klux Klan and I'll do the scrapping for it ... And the fiery cross is going to burn at every crossroads in Indiana, as long as there is a white man left in the state."&lt;ref&gt;"Grand Dragon: D.C. Stephenson and the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana" by M. William Lutholtz. West Lafayette, Indiana, Purdue University Press, 1991, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Convicted of murder==
Publicly a [[Prohibition]]ist and a defender of "[[Protestantism|Protestant]] womanhood," Stephenson was tried in 1925 for the rape and murder of [[Madge Oberholtzer]], a young state employee who ran a state program to combat adult illiteracy.  During the trial, the Klan's image as upholders of law and morality were gravely weakened as it was proven that Stephenson and many of his associates were in private womanizers and alcoholics.&lt;ref name="Lutholtz"/&gt; The scandal of the charges and trial led to the rapid decline in  the "Second Wave" of Klan activity.&lt;ref name=vpappab&gt;[http://www.in.gov/library/2848.htm Ku Klux Klan in Indiana] Accessed December 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson was convicted of the abduction, forced intoxication, and rape of Oberholtzer. His abuse led to her [[suicide]] attempt while she was still in his captivity. Because the suicide attempt eventually caused Oberholtzer's death, Stephenson was also charged with murder.

Stephenson had bitten her many times during his attack. The attending doctor described her condition as consisting of a significant bite on her breast.&lt;ref name=docsteph /&gt;  He later testified that the bite wounds that Stephenson inflicted on her were a leading contributor to her death due to a [[staph infection]] that eventually reached her lungs. The doctor also testified that she could have been saved if she had been given medical attention sooner.&lt;ref name=docsteph&gt;[http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/stephenson/atatevstprosecution.html STEPHENSON v.

After his conviction, [[Edward L. Jackson|Governor Jackson]] refused to grant Stephenson clemency or commute his sentence. On  9 September 1927, Stephenson released lists of public officials who were or had been on the Klan payroll. The ''[[Indianapolis Times]]'' interviewed Stephenson and proceeded with an extended investigation of the Klan's political ties.&lt;ref name="Center"/&gt; (The ''Times'' won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] for its investigative reporting.&lt;ref name="Center"/&gt;) This publicity and the state's crackdown on Klan activity sped up the decline of the organization by the end of the 1920s. The KKK suffered a dramatic nationwide loss of reputation and its membership rapidly fell from 5 million in 1925; few Klan members were counted in the organization's former Midwestern stronghold soon after.

The state filed indictments against Governor Jackson; George V. "Cap" Coffin, chairman of the Marion County Republican Party; and attorney Robert I. Marsh, charging them with conspiring to bribe former Governor [[Warren McCray]]. The mayor of Indianapolis, [[John L. Duvall|John Duvall]], was convicted and sentenced to jail for 30 days (and barred from political service for four years). Some Republican commissioners of [[Marion County, Indiana|Marion County]] resigned from their posts after being charged with accepting bribes from the Klan and Stephenson.&lt;ref name="Center"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150507171643/http://centerforhistory.org/learn-history/indiana-history/the-golden-era-of-indiana-1900-1941 "Indiana and the Ku Klux Klan"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507171643/http://centerforhistory.org/learn-history/indiana-history/the-golden-era-of-indiana-1900-1941 |date=May 7, 2015 }}, Center for History&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
On 7 January 1941, the [[Valparaiso, Indiana|Valparaiso]] ''[[Vidette-Messenger]]'' reported that Governor [[M. Clifford Townsend]], a Democrat, was considering granting an early [[parole]] to Stephenson. No parole was approved that year. Stephenson was paroled on 23 March 1950 by a Democratic administration, but violated parole by disappearing on or before 25 September 1950. On 15 December 1950, he was captured in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] and returned to custody. He was sentenced in 1951 to serve 10 years in prison. In 1953, he pleaded for release, denying that he had ever been a leader of the Klan. [[File:D.C. Stewphenson.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Grave marker located at USVA Mountain Home National Cemetery in Johnson City, Tennessee]] On 22 December 1956, the state paroled him, on condition that he leave Indiana and never return.&lt;ref name="Lutholtz"/&gt; Stephenson relocated to [[Seymour, Indiana]], where he soon married Martha Dickinson (they were separated less than a year later).

Stephenson then moved to [[Jonesborough, Tennessee]] (the town name was briefly spelled as "Jonesboro" during this time), where he was employed at the [[Jonesborough, Tennessee|Jonesboro]] ''[[Herald &amp; Tribune]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Notre Dame Vs. the Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan". By Todd Tucker&lt;/ref&gt; and where he also married Martha Murray Sutton without having been divorced from Dickinson.

In 1961, at the age of 70, Stephenson was arrested in Independence, Missouri on charges of attempting to [[Sexual assault|sexually assault]] a sixteen-year-old girl but he was later released after paying a $300 fine because the charges were dropped on grounds of insufficient evidence. He was ordered to leave Missouri immediately. &lt;ref name="Lutholtz"/&gt; A few years later, in 1966, Stephenson died at his home in [[Jonesborough, Tennessee]] and he was buried at the [[Mountain Home National Cemetery|USVA Mountain Home National Cemetery]] in [[Johnson City, Tennessee]].

{{Violence against women}}In [[Australia]], [[domestic violence]] is defined by [[Family Law Act 1975]]&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2013C00053/Download|title=Family Law Act 1975|last=|first=|date=|website=Legislation Australia|publisher=Commonwealth Government of Australia|access-date=5 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2013C00053/3949e9b1-07f0-459a-b984-1b12a290b251|title=Family Violence Act 1975 - PDF|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Commonwealth Government of Australia|access-date=5 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person's family, or causes the family member to be fearful".

The Act refers to acts of violence that occur between people who have, or have had, an intimate relationship in domestic settings. Domestic violence includes violence between partners of both sexes, including same-sex relationships. However, the term can be altered by each state's legislation and can broaden the spectrum of domestic violence, such as in Victoria, where family-like relationships and witnessing any type of violence in the family is defined as a family violence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubStatbook.nsf/f932b66241ecf1b7ca256e92000e23be/083D69EC540CD748CA2574CD0015E27C/$FILE/08-52a.pdf|title=Family Violence Act 2008|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=24 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To refer to domestic violence, in Australia, states chose to name them differently. As such, in Australia domestic violence, depending on the state, it's called "domestic violence", "family violence", "domestic and family violence" and "domestic abuse".&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-06/fact-file-domestic-violence-statistics/7147938|title=Fact file: Domestic violence in Australia|date=2016-04-05|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of domestic violence data in Australia revealed that 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men have experienced at least one incident of violence from a current or former partner since the age of 15.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

On average between 2010 and 2012, every 10 days  a male died as a result of family violence, with a total of 75 over the period,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oneinthree.com.au/infographic|title=One in Three Campaign - Infographic|website=www.oneinthree.com.au|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst in 2015, Females accounted for almost two thirds (65%) of all victims of FDV–related Homicide in Australia in 2015 (103 victims)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/4510.0~2015~Main%20Features~Experimental%20Family%20and%20Domestic%20Violence%20Statistics~6|title=Australian Bureau of Statistics -|website=abs.gov|access-date= 3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2014 and 2016 there were 264,028 domestic violence incidents reported and recorded.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-21/domestic-violence/7341716|title=Australian police deal with domestic violence every two minutes|date=2016-04-21|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Australian Bureau of Statistics's released data revealed that 80% of women and 95% of men who had experienced violence from a current partner never contacted the police.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/25AF91125718ADF1CA257C3D000D856A?opendocument|title=Chapter - Actions taken in response to partner violence|last=Statistics|first=|date=2013-12-11|website=|publisher=|language=en|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common reason for not reporting was cited as fear of revenge or further violence from the current partner.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Between 2014 and 2015, 2,800 women and 560 men were hospitalised after being assaulted by a spouse or partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/domestic-violence/family-domestic-sexual-violence-in-australia-2018/contents/table-of-contents|title=Family, domestic and sexual violence in Australia, 2018|work=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper published in Melbourne in 2016, revealed that from 121,251 domestic violence incidents recorded over a 2 year period,more than 21% involved alcohol by either or both parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/embridge_cache/emshare/original/public/2016/11/1f/362385d38/20161201_InBrief7_FINAL.pdf|title=Family violence, alcohol consumption and the likelihood of criminal offences|last=|first=|publisher=Crime Statistics Agency|year=December 2016|location=Melbourne, Victoria, Australia|pages=4|issn=2205-6378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A critical report by Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in 2018 revealed that 1 in 6 (approximately 1.5 million) women and 1 in 9 (approximately 992,000 men) were physically and/or sexually abused before the age of 15. The same report revealed that 72,000 women, 34,000 children and 9,000 men employed homelessness services in 2016–17 due to domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.aihw.gov.au/getmedia/d1a8d479-a39a-48c1-bbe2-4b27c7a321e0/aihw-fdv-02.pdf.aspx?inline=true|title=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2018.

== National Founding and Research ==
{{Violence against men}}In 1996, the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] (ABS) held a national survey, entitled 'Women's Safety Survey' which provided the first comprehensive national data on all forms of violence against women.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.budget.gov.au/2001-02/minst/html/women-06.htm|title=Ministerial Statements|website=www.budget.gov.au|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/056A404DAA576AE6CA2571D00080E985/$File/49060_2005%20(reissue).pdf|title=PERSONAL SAFETY SURVEY AUSTRALIA|last=|first=|date=21 Aug 2006|website=Australian Bureau of Statistics|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|access-date=31 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/F16680629C465E03CA256980007C4A81/$File/41280_1996.pdf|title=Woman's safety Australia 1996|last=|first=|date=11 Dec 1996|website=|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|access-date=2 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[John Howard]], the prime minister of Australia brought together the heads of all states and territories and acknowledged the domestic violence phenomena across Australia and set to work together to resolve the issue. In the same year, the Commonwealth Government of Australia committed $50 million to test preventive measures and practices to address domestic violence. The program was called 'Partnerships Against Domestic Violence' and was founded until 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timeline.awava.org.au/archives/482|title=Partnerships Against Domestic Violence (PADV) begins - Timeline|date=1997-03-02|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the said founding, [[Centrelink]] started providing emergency crisis payments to women who were victims of domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

During that same year, the [[Commonwealth of Australia|Commonwealth]] government established the '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Partnerships'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' programme which provided $157 million for each state and territory for the '''Supported Accommodation Assistance Programme''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' which provides transitional support and accommodation to homeless people, many of whom are women escaping domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Partnerships''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' programme has sponsored more than 100 projects to explore practices at local, regional and national levels. Those projects included development of competency standards, worker training, research into domestic violence, community awareness products and better coordination systems between police and the justice system. The program also established the '''Australian Domestic Violence Clearinghouse''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' which gathers research and publications from each state and territory of Australia but also from overseas.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In 1997–2001, The National Indigenous Family Violence Grants Programme was initiated by the Commonwealth Government and provided $6 million over the 4-year period. The grant was aimed at helping local indigenous communities to reduce family violence. They were assisted by a mentoring team which provided advice on project management, self-documentation and self-evaluation.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerc.uq.edu.au/national-mentoring-and-evaluation-scheme|title=National Mentoring and Evaluation Scheme|access-date=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]] established the National Initiative to Combat [[Sexual assault|Sexual Assault]] with funding of $16.5 million over four years and was administered by Office of the Status of Women.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In 2004 - 2005, an additional $6.7m was granted to NICSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/archive/Domviolence|title=Domestic Violence in Australia - an Overview of the Issues|last=|first=|date=|website=Parliament of Australia|publisher=Government of Australia|access-date=31 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between August and December 2005, the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] conducted another ''Personal Safety Survey'' and on 21 Aug 2006, ABS released its findings. ABS interviewed 16,400 people ''in all States and Territories.'' The release of the survey included comparison to the ''1996 Women's Safety Survey.'' The survey revealed that the physical threat dropped significantly from 1996 to 2005.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In March 2009, the [[Department of Social Services (Australia)|Department of Social Services]] released an economic report entitled ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'The Cost of Violence against Women and their Children'.'' The report revealed that between 2002 and 2003, the cost of domestic violence was estimated at $8.1 billion. The report also revealed the fact that if no action is taken against this phenomenon, by 2021–2022, the figure will double, amounting to $15.6 billion. The largest contributor being pain, suffering and premature mortality, estimated at $7.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dss.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/05_2012/vawc_economic_report.pdf|title=The Cost of Violence against Women and their Children|last=|first=|date=March 2009|website=|publisher=Department of Social Services|access-date=2 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/rip/rip07/rip07.pdf|title=Key issues in domestic violence|last=|first=|date=December 2009|website=|publisher=Australian Institute of Criminology|access-date=2 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Finance_and_Public_Administration/Domestic_Violence/Report|title=Domestic violence in Australia|last=|first=|date=20 August 2015|website=|publisher=Parliament of Australia|access-date=2 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] recorded 95 victims of family and domestic violence-related homicides. With the largest numbers of victims in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (32), followed by [[New South Wales]] (30).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/4510.0~2014~Main%20Features~Experimental%20Family%20and%20Domestic%20Violence%20Statistics~10000|title=EXPERIMENTAL FAMILY AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE STATISTICS|last=|first=|date=23 Sep 2015|website=|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|access-date=2 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, the [[Australian Senate]] under ''Finance and Public Administration References Committee'' issued an interim report regarding domestic violence in Australia. The interim report contained a total of 8 recommendations. The recommendation of 'inclusion of respectful relationships education in the national curriculum' was probably the one that stood out and provided an opportunity to create a positive change, starting with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Finance_and_Public_Administration/Domestic_Violence/Interim_Report|title=Interim report Domestic violence in Australia|last=|first=|date=19 March 2015|website=|publisher=Finance and Public Administration References Committee|access-date=2 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ourwatch.org.au/getmedia/4a61e08b-c958-40bc-8e02-30fde5f66a25/Evidence-paper-respectful-relationships-education-AA-updated.pdf.aspx|title=Respectful Relationships Education in Schools|last=|first=|date=December 2015|website=|publisher=Ourwatch.org|access-date=2 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interim report followed, among others, the submission from ''[[Australian Women Against Violence Alliance]]'' regarding the domestic violence issue. AWAVA conducted its own research into the matter and issued a number of recommendations, including the inclusion of respectful relationships in youth education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=8e1fc403-d7f8-49d2-984b-175779e73d24&amp;subId=298518|title=Senate Inquiry into Domestic Violence in Australia Submission|last=|first=|date=20 August 2015|website=|publisher=Parliament of Australia|access-date=2 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September 2015, the prime minister, [[Malcolm Turnbull]], announced a founding of another $100 million for measures to protect victims of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/these-new-stats-reveal-the-horrifying-scale-of-domestic-violence-in-australia-2015-9|title=These new stats reveal the horrifying scale of domestic violence in Australia|last=Colgan|first=Paul|date=2015-09-24|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Government of Australia|the federal government of Australia]], announced a 3-year plan for tackling domestic violence entitled 'Family and Domestic Violence Strategy 2016 - 2019'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanservices.gov.au/corporate/publications-and-resources/family-and-domestic-violence-strategy-2016-2019|title=Family and Domestic Violence Strategy 2016 - 2019 - Australian Government Department of Human Services|website=www.humanservices.gov.au|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanservices.gov.au/sites/default/files/12899-1511-family-domestic-violence-strategy.pdf|title=Family and Domestic Violence Strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=Human Services|publisher=Government of Australia|access-date=27 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New South Wales ==
On 14 October 2015, [[Pru Goward]], the [[New South Wales|NSW]] Minister for the Prevention of Domestic Violence, stated that the government would provide a $60m package to tackle some of the most serious domestic violence problems. From those, $15m will fund 6 domestic violence 'High Risk Offender Teams', $4.1m for 24 new domestic violence liaison officers, $19.5m into mandated perpetrator behaviour change programs to provide treatment for offenders (to treat them just like those for drug or alcohol addictions). Another $20m will be spent for increasing the housing for those affected, $2.3m for police partnerships with other organisations and $1.3m over 4 years to increase the numbers of Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/specialist-police-squads-target-domestic-violence-offenders-20151012-gk7h0q.html|title=Baird government's $60m package targets domestic violence|last=Partridge|first=Emma|date=2015-10-19|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme===
In March 2015, [[New South Wales]] Premier [[Mike Baird]] announced a pilot of the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme (DVDS) an adaptation of Clare's Law which was seen as a success in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/clares-law-saves-1300-women-from-violent-partners-in-first-year-10001781.html|title='Clare's Law' saves 1,300 women from violent partners in first year|date=2015-01-26|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haveyoursay.nsw.gov.au/assets/Uploads/DVDS-Discussion-Paper.pdf|title=NSW Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme - Discussion Paper|last=|first=|date=May 2015|website=Have Your Say - Government of NSW|publisher=Gabrielle Upton MP and Pru Goward MP|access-date=25 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the scheme, victims are given the option to seek out information about his/her partner regarding any history of domestic violence. In the future, the scheme could also be extended to friends and family members who may have concerns about the affected person's partner.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The DVDS is being piloted in four NSW Police Force Areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.domesticviolence.nsw.gov.au/dvds|title=Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme - Domestic Violence|website=www.domesticviolence.nsw.gov.au|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[City of Shoalhaven|Shoalhaven]] (Nowra region)
* Sutherland (Menai/Engadine/Sutherland region)
* St George (Kogarah/Hurstville region).

==== Person at risk application ====
From the beginnings of the scheme and public enquiry into the matter, a "right to ask" model has been proposed, such as that in the UK.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In the current form of the scheme, only a person of 16 years of age or older can make an application. Indifferent of the domestic partner's criminal history, the disclosure, it will be made within 2 weeks from the date of the application and will be made in person by a police officer assisted by a social worker.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.domesticviolence.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/371192/dvds-application-form-primary-person.pdf|title=NSW Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme|last=|first=|date=April 2016|website=Domestic violence NSW Government|publisher=Government of NSW|access-date=25 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information disclosed include relevant convictions of family violence, other serious convictions such as sexual offences, child abuse offences or murder and the date of conviction (case by case).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Third party application ====

A third party to a relationship can make an application of disclosure, similar to that of a ''person at risk application''. The third party must be a family member, friend or a professional that has ongoing relationship with the person who may be at risk.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.domesticviolence.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/371193/dvds-application-form-third-party.pdf|title=NSW Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme Application for someone I am concerned about to receive information|last=|first=|date=April 2016|website=Domestic Violence NSW Government|publisher=NSW Government|access-date=25 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police will disclose the information to the person at risk only, within two weeks of the application, in the presence of a specialist social worker. The third party who has made the application, can be present at the disclosure, provided that he or she is invited by the person at risk for whom the application was made.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; &lt;nowiki/&gt;

== Victoria ==
Victoria has been at the forefront of family violence policy development and reform in Australia for the past 15 years and has been influential in propelling reforms in other Australian and international jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://files.rcfv.com.au/Reports/RCFV_Full_Report_Interactive.pdf|title=Royal Commission into Family Violence - Full Report - Interactive|last=|first=|date=March 2016|website=|publisher=Victorian Government|access-date=24 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Victorian Law Reform Commission's review of family violence laws sparked a number of changes in Victoria. The [[Law commission|Law Reform Commission]] was part of the 2005 integrated service system developed by the [[Government of Victoria|Victorian government]]. Among those, the [[Magistrates' Court of Victoria|Magistrates Court of Victoria]] introduced a specialist Family Violence Court Division, integrated family violence support services, Magistrates’ Court Family Violence Taskforce and released its own paper entitled ''Response to Family Violence 2015–2017''.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sentencingcouncil.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/publication-documents/Contravention%20of%20FVIOs%20and%20FVSNs%20Prior%20Offences%20and%20Reoffending.pdf|title=Contravention of Family Violence Intervention Orders and Safety Notices: Prior Offences and Reoffending|last=|first=|date=Aug 2016|website=Sentencing Council|publisher=Sentencing Advisory Council|access-date=7 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the government introduced new laws to tackle family violence. As such, the [http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubStatbook.nsf/f932b66241ecf1b7ca256e92000e23be/083D69EC540CD748CA2574CD0015E27C/$FILE/08-52a.pdf Family Violence Protection Act 2008] was adopted and, for the first time, broad family, past relationships and 'family-like' relationships are included in the law.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?Document_ID=43360|title=Victoria Police - Family Violence|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=24 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family Violence Protection Act 2008&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; states:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Family violence is any behaviour that in any way controls or dominates a family member and causes them to feel fear for their own, or other family member's safety or well-being. It can include physical, sexual, psychological, emotional or economic abuse and any behaviour that causes a child to hear, witness, or otherwise be exposed to the effects of that behaviour.''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Act also recognises that violence also occurs in gay and lesbian relationships at similar levels to heterosexual relationships, although some forms of abuse are unique for people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2016, following a Royal Commission into Family Violence, the Victorian government committed $572m to tackle the problem.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-30/victorian-family-violence-system-overwhelmed-report-says/7283784|title='We failed every single one': Family violence system overhaul|date=2016-03-30|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, the premier [[Daniel Andrews]] stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"We'll overhaul our broken support system from the bottom up"''&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The premier also stated that in 2015, 37 Victorians had been murdered by a family member:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''"We failed every single one of them."''&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''"It's Australia's number one law and order issue but it's taken us too long to admit it."''&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the 2015 - 2016 Victorian budget, [[Government of Victoria|the government]] provided $81.3 million to support the work of the Royal Commission into Family Violence. In addition to the direct family violence found insertion, a further $257 million was provided to [[Child Protective Services|child protection services]] and $48.1 to Child FIRST to improve early intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtf.vic.gov.au/files/7e68011b-a770-4d23-bf61-a48200c2de10/BudgetOverview.pdf|title=Victorian Budget 15 I 16|last=|first=|date=May 2015|website=State Government of Victoria|publisher=Government of Victoria|access-date=5 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtf.vic.gov.au/State-Budget/2015-16-State-Budget/Budget-Overview|title=Treasury and Finance|website=www.dtf.vic.gov.au|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtf.vic.gov.au/Publications/State-Budget-publications/2015-16-State-Budget/2015-16-Budget-Papers|title=Treasury and Finance|website=www.dtf.vic.gov.au|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Victorian Government had another review of its action plan to tackle Family Violence. In the review, the government made some significant changes to tackle the family violence problem and provided a 10 year plan.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.vic.gov.au/system/user_files/Documents/fv/160803.10%2010%20Year%20Plan%20Booklet%20(Online).pdf|title=ENDING FAMILY VIOLENCE VICTORIA’S PLAN FOR CHANGE|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=978-1-925551-14-3|location=Melbourne|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, in 2017, Victorian Government introduced "Respectful relationships" program for schools after a successful trial in 2016.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

=== 2015–2016 Royal Commission into Family Violence ===
In the wake of a series of family violence related deaths in Victoria, most notably the death of 11 year old [[Rosie Batty|Luke Batty]], who was killed by his father on 12 February 2014, a Royal Commission into Family Violence was ordered by the government of Victoria.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

On 22 February 2015, the Governor of Victoria, [[Alex Chernov]], signed the letters patent appointing former Justice [[Marcia Neave]] as Commissioner and Patricia Faulkner and Tony Nicholson as Deputy Commissioners to the [[Royal Commission]] into Family Violence.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcfv.com.au/The-Commission|title=About the Family Violence Royal Commission - Victoria|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=24 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March 2016, after 13 months and 25 days of hearings, the Royal Commission provided its report and recommendations to the government.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The released report consists of 8 volumes and contains 227 recommendations, directed at improving the foundations of the current system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcfv.com.au/Report-Recommendations|title=Family Violence Royal Commission - Report and recommendations|last=|first=|date=29 April 2016|website=|publisher=Victorian Government|access-date=24 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Future response ====
Royal Commission found a strong foundation for future response, which included&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Family Violence Protection Act
* Seriousness with which Victoria Police now regards family violence
* Victorian Family Violence Risk Assessment and Risk Management Framework
* Development of Risk Assessment and Management Panels to proactively monitor perpetrators
* Dedicated specialist family violence services across the state
* Development of the Indigenous Family Violence 10 Year Plan
* Significant research and legislative and policy reform relevant to sexual assault

==== Identified gaps ====
The Commission found a number of limitations in the current system which included:&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* All parts of the domestic violence system were overwhelmed, including police, support services and the courts.
* Not all of the family violence forms were recognised by the emergency services.
* Victoria Police and Department of Human Services are not taking into consideration circumstances of the victims in the diverse community
* A lack of resources for children or young people who were exposed to or suffered from family violence
* The lack of training to recognise family violence by workers in health services, schools and other similar systems.
* Inadequate efforts to hold perpetrators to account for their actions.
* Inadequate methods for sharing information between agencies.
* Little effort to prevent the occurrence of family violence. 
* Little effort to help victims recover from family violence. 
* The Victorian Government does not have a management plan to respond to the phenomena or to prevent it in the first place.

=== Victoria Police ===
In response to the recommendations of the Victoria Police Violence Against Women Review,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?a=internetBridgingPage&amp;Media_ID=49202|title=Violence Against Women and Children Strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=24 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in August 2004, Victoria Police developed a Code of Practice&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?a=internetBridgingPage&amp;Media_ID=464|title=Victoria Police - Family Violence - Code of Practice|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Victoria Police|access-date=24 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has since suffered a number of revisions in accordance with modified legislation, new procedures or change of the policing environment. Currently, Victoria Police has compulsory action for any reported family violence incident and must act in all circumstances.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Victoria Police regards family violence as extremely serious and has a pro-charge code of practice. The organisation sees the nature of violence in family relationships as particularly insidious because it is an abuse of trust. There is often a continuing threat to the victim’s safety or to their life, or the lives of their children and sometimes to extended family members.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Police may receive reports of family violence direct from the affected family member or members of their family, including children, or from a friend, neighbour, members of the public, anonymous person or from another agency. The report may be made by telephone, in person at a police station or by any other means. Police may also detect family violence in the course of their normal duties.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Since the Code of Practice has been drafted, police ''must respond'' as a priority (unless it is clear that the report relates to a past incident and there is no risk of imminent danger or the person is seeking advice only) and ''take action'' on any family violence incident reported to them, regardless of who made the report or how it was made. The action taken is based on risk assessment and risk management, regardless of whether the affected family member makes a verbal complaint or written statement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2011, Victoria Police launched its enhanced Family Violence Service Delivery Model and established specialist family violence teams across the state, mostly in high-demand locations.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

In 2015, Victoria Police established a Family Violence Command as a central point for family violence within Victoria Police. It is the first police force in Australia to do so.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

==== Victoria Police's new powers ====
The Victorian government, in a bid to tackle family violence, gave police officers new powers, such as: holding powers, non-criminal options if there is not enough evidence to charge the respondent, seizure of firearms and other weapons, entry to premises and search of persons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Mandatory action by Victoria Police ====
The new Code of Practice set out new mandatory action by Victorian Police officers responding to family violence:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Take immediate action to protect and support the affected family members and their children
* Undertake a family violence risk assessment 
* Recognition of the victim’s own assessment of their level of fear
* Identify who is the primary aggressor, and where physical violence has occurred 
* Assess if it is likely that someone has been acting in self-defence 
* Assess the likelihood of future risk 
* Make referrals for every party involved
* Arrange accommodation

== Queensland ==
In 2012 the Domestic and Family Violence Protection Act was amended to reflect contemporary understandings of domestic and family violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.qld.gov.au/communityservices/violence-prevention/domestic-and-family-violence-protection-act-2012|title=Domestic and Family Violence Protection Act 2012|publisher=communities.qld.gov.au|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of relationships that fall under the new act are same-sex relationships and "one-night stands" where a child is produced.

== Tasmania ==
Tasmania operates under Family Violence Act 2004, which was adopted on 17 December 2004.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeathome.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/27585/Family_Violence_Act_2004.pdf|title=Family Violence Act 2004|last=|first=|date=17 Dec 2004|website=|publisher=Government of Tasmania|access-date=5 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act refers only to the context of a spouse or partner relationship.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt;

Family Violence Act 2004, as opposed to the national Family Law Act 1975&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  and other states such as Victoria&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; where family violence has a broader meaning, Tasmanian government elected to strictly define family violence criminally, economically and emotional.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

In 2003 the Tasmanian government released '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Options Paper Safe at Home: A Criminal Justice Framework for Responding to Family Violence in Tasmania'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' . Its aim was to provide a framework for the discussion of legislative and justice related service delivery options.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeathome.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/28374/Options_Paper.pdf|title=A Criminal Justice Framework for Responding to Family Violence in Tasmania|last=|first=|date=Aug 2003|website=Safe at home|publisher=Government of Tasmania|access-date=2 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeathome.tas.gov.au/about_us/history|title=Safe at Home : History|website=www.safeathome.tas.gov.au|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, in [[Tasmania]] the term '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''family violence''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' or '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''domestic violence''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' was not defined in legislation. The term '''family violence''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' has been preferred to the other. The paper analysed actions and legislation of the other states and has set the standards for the action against family violence in Tasmania.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In October 2013, Tasmanian Police stated that the family violence incidents in Tasmania were on a decreasing trend for the past several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.examiner.com.au/story/1851524/divide-over-domestic-violence-rates/|title=Divide over domestic violence rates|last=TANG|first=CAROLINE|date=2013-10-18|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2015, since [[Rosie Batty]]'s case and the increased awareness of domestic violence, Tasmania Police revealed that the numbers are quite high with more than 50 new cases each week, Tasmanian Police Commissioner Darren Hine stating "It's quite a horrific figure".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-18/tasmania-police-called-to-50-domestic-violence-incidents-a-week/6477492|title=Tasmania faces 'horrific' domestic violence problem, about 50 incidents a week: police|date=2015-05-18|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, Commissioner Hine stated that 400 more incidents were reported compared with the same period of 2015, stating that's 20% increase from previous year whilst there are still between 40% and 80% family violence incidents not being reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-06/domestic-violence-tasmania-between-40-and-80pc-under-reporting/7390422|title=Tasmanian police reveal 20pc rise in reports of domestic violence|date=2016-05-06|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 2015, the [[government of Tasmania]] released '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Safe Homes, Safe Families: Tasmania’s Family Violence Action Plan 2015-2020 (Safe Homes, Safe Families)''' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpac.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/273564/Implementation_Plan_for_Safe_Homes,_Safe_Families.pdf|title=Safe Home IMPLEMENTATION PLAN|last=|first=|date=31 Aug 2015|website=Department of Premier and Cabinet|publisher=Government of Australia|access-date=2 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; program to tackle family violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpac.tas.gov.au/safehomessafefamilies|title=Department of Premier and Cabinet|website=www.dpac.tas.gov.au|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this plan, the government committed an additional $25.57 million over 4 years.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpac.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/266073/Safe_Homes_Safe_Families_-_Action_plan.pdf|title=Tasmania’s Family Violence Action Plan 2015–2020|last=|first=|date=August 2015|website=Department of Premier and Cabinet|publisher=Tasmanian Government|access-date=2 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpac.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/266134/Safe_Homes_Safe_Families_-_Fact_sheet.pdf|title=Fact sheet - Tasmania’s Family Violence Action Plan 2015–2020|last=|first=|date=August 2015|website=Department of Premier and Cabinet|publisher=Government of Tasmania|access-date=2 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tasmanian Police powers ===
Police have various powers under the Justices Act 1959 and the Police Offences Act 1935 to respond to family violence situations.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/print/index.w3p;cond=;doc_id=44%252B%252B1935%252BAT%2540EN%252B20150308000000;histon=;rec=0;term=|title=Tasmanian Legislation Online|website=www.thelaw.tas.gov.au|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/content.w3p;doc_id=77++1959+AT@EN+20101225000000;rec=0|title=Justice Act 1959|last=|first=|date=|website=TheLaw Tasmania|publisher=Government of Australia|access-date=5 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adopted Tasmanian act, ''Family Violence Act 2004'' gave Tasmanian Police new powers to deal with family violence, such as: entering private property, arresting perpetrators for issuing family violence orders and search of person and premises.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Under the Tasmanian law, a police officer is authorised to enter and remain on premises without warrant and use force to prevent family violence at the request of the person who apparently resides on the premises. The police officer can also enter premises if he or she reasonably suspects that family violence is being, has been, or is likely to be committed on those premises.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== Australian Capital Territory ==
In 1997, the Domestic Violence Prevention Council (DVPC) was established under the Domestic Violence Agencies Act 1986 as an independent statutory body. [[ACT Policing]] is a member of DVPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cdn.justice.act.gov.au/resources/uploads/Domestic_Violence_Agencies_Act_1986.pdf|title=Domestic Violence Agencies Act 1986|last=|first=|date=1 April 2016|website=Legislation ACT|publisher=ACT Government|access-date=5 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dvpc.org.au|title=Domestic Violence Prevention Council {{!}} Our objective is to reduce the incidence of domestic violence offences in the ACT|website=www.dvpc.org.au|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, in a bid to tackle the family violence, the [[ACT Policing]] launched the Family Violence Coordination Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.police.act.gov.au/safety-and-security/family-violence|title=ACT Policing - Family violence|last=|first=|date=2016-03-07|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[ACT Government|ACT government]] reviewed the level of domestic violence response by different agencies and in June 2016, the ACT government accepted all the findings,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/open_government/inform/act_government_media_releases/corbell/2016/response-affirms-government-commitment-to-reduce-family-violence2|title=Response affirms government commitment to reduce family violence|last=|first=|date=28 June 2016|website=|publisher=ACT government|access-date=7 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released a report entitled '''Response to Family Violence''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'. In the released report, among others, the ACT government pledged a Family Violence Statement to the Legislative Assembly every year and a $21.47 million package over 4 years.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/883484/ACT-Government-Response_family_violence.pdf|title=ACT GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO FAMILY VIOLENCE|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ACT Government|access-date=5 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-28/act-government-accepts-family-violence-recommendations/7548234|title=ACT Government commits to family violence recommendations|date=2016-06-27|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the same commitment, the [[ACT Government|ACT government]] acknowledged the fact that the emotional, physical and financial abuse were not part of the Domestic Violence Agencies Act 1986 and the victims were not protected from such abuse. However, the government pledged to change the Act and to better protect the victims.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/major-overhaul-of-act-family-violence-strategy-needed-to-protect-victims-reports-20160520-goznnk.html|title='We must keep Canberra families safe': Major overhaul flagged for family violence strategy|last=Belot|first=Christopher Knaus and Henry|date=2016-05-20|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the 2016 - 2017 budget, the ACT government set a new precedent in [[Australia]] when it introduced an annual $30 domestic violence levy on all households.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/act-government-defends-fairness-of-safer-families-levy-for-domestic-violence-package-20160608-gpe3r9.html|title=ACT government defends fairness of safer families levy for domestic violence package|last=Knaus|first=Christopher|date=2016-06-13|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Victorian premier [[Daniel Andrews]], soon followed with a statement stating that he is considering a similar measure in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/30-levy-sets-new-territory-on-domestic-violence/news-story/c035baace05bcc095e93c499a31ac423|title=Subscribe to The Australian|website=www.theaustralian.com.au|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ACT Police Powers ===
Sections 156A – 165 of the Family Violence Protection Act 2008 define the ACT police powers.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/fvpa2008283/|title=FAMILY VIOLENCE PROTECTION ACT 2008|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, ACT police officers have (for the purpose of preventing family violence) the power to enter private premises without warrant and search and seize firearms.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

== South Australia ==
In [[South Australia]], the domestic violence is defined and regulated by The ''Intervention Orders (Prevention of Abuse) Act 2009'' which replaced the Domestic Violence Act 1994.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/INTERVENTION%20ORDERS%20(PREVENTION%20OF%20ABUSE)%20ACT%202009.aspx|title=Intervention Orders (Prevention of Abuse) Act 2009|last=|first=|date=2016-11-30|website=South Australia Legislation|publisher=South Australia Government|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Act, the meaning of abuse either domestic or non‑domestic, includes physical, sexual, emotional, psychological or economic abuse. This includes damaging the property or possession of the person or property enjoyed by the person, unreasonable denial of financial, social or personal autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.courts.sa.gov.au/OurCourts/MagistratesCourt/InterventionPrograms/Pages/Abuse-Prevention-Program-and-Family-Violence-Courts.aspx|title=Abuse Prevention Program and Family Violence Courts|last=|first=|date=2016-11-30|website=www.courts.sa.gov.au|publisher=Courts Administration Authority - South Australia|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March 2011, [[Zahra Abrahimzadeh]] died after being stabbed repeatedly by her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/sa-police-lashed-by-coroner-over-actions-before-murder-of-zahra-abrahimzadeh/news-story/8803d03fb2ca038ed4757f967ecd35c9?nk=0545411df67cb7187a97488d2dca4517-1480483884|title=Coroner lashes ‘slack and appalling’ police over murder|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Inquest|coronial inquest]] initiated by the state coroner and 10 recommendations were issued. Normally, the [[coroner]] would issue recommendations to the [[South Australia Police|SAPOL]] [[Police commissioner|Commissioner of Police]], however, in this instance, the coroner issued to findings to the premier of [[South Australia]] which in turn would bring it to the attention of the Commissioner of Police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.courts.sa.gov.au/CoronersFindings/Lists/Coroners%20Findings/Attachments/594/ABRAHIMZADEH%20Zahra.pdf|title=FINDING OF INQUEST|last=|first=|date=7 July 2014|website=www.courts.sa.gov.au|publisher=South Australian Coroner's Office|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansardpublic.parliament.sa.gov.au/Pages/IndexResult.aspx#/SubjectIndex/HANSARD-6-19/HANSARD-11-16362|title=Search|website=hansardpublic.parliament.sa.gov.au|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A direct consequence of the coroner's recommendations, the Women's Domestic Violence Court Assistance Service (WDVCAS) was launched in 2015, which provides free legal advice and it is funded by the Victims of Crime levy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-14/domestic-violence-zahra-abrahimzadeh-inquest-leads-to-free-legal/6773294|title=Free legal service available for victims of domestic violence in South Australia|date=2015-09-14|newspaper=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Australia, between 2014 and 2015, the crime figures fell to 2010 levels whilst the domestic violence incidents increased by 8%, from 6720 in 2014 to 7740 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/horrifying-figures-show-rise-in-domestic-violence-in-sa/news-story/0068d3e80749dc373ddf17fb80b09ebe|title=Subscribe to The Advertiser|website=www.adelaidenow.com.au|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 April 2016, the South Parliamentary Committee issued a report into the domestic violence problem in South Australia. With it, the committee also issued 35 recommendations to help the government tackle the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.sa.gov.au/HouseofAssembly/BusinessoftheAssembly/RecordsandPapers/TabledPapersandPetitions/Pages/TabledPapersandPetitions.aspx?TPLoadDoc=true&amp;TPDocType=1&amp;TPP=53&amp;TPS=2&amp;TPItemID=91&amp;TPDocName=SDC%2bDomestic%2band%2bFamily%2bViolence%2bFinal%2bReport%2b39th%2bReport%2bH%2bA.pdf|title=REPORT INTO DOMESTIC AND FAMILY VIOLENCE|last=|first=|date=12 April 2016|website=www.parliament.sa.gov.au|publisher=Parliament of South Australia|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As most of the other states in Australia did, the committee's recommended that more funding for crisis accommodation to be provided, consistency of intervention orders to protect the victim across the state borders and provide more education for magistrates and GPs to deal with the victims of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/sa-parliamentary-committee-makes-35-recommendations-to-address-domestic-and-family-violence/news-story/730291ee0e4d1b23d4cf2f099e4906ab|title=Call for video evidence in domestic violence cases|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On behalf of the South Australian community, the Attorney-General of South Australia also issued 8 discussion papers relating to domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agd.sa.gov.au/initiatives/domestic-violence-discussion-paper|title=Domestic Violence Discussion Paper {{!}} Attorney-General's Department|website=www.agd.sa.gov.au|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agd.sa.gov.au/sites/agd.sa.gov.au/files/documents/160727_1182_AGD_AnnualReport_2015-16_WEBV1.pdf|title=2015–16 Attorney-General’s Department Annual Report|last=|first=|date=30 September 2016|website=www.agd.sa.gov.au|publisher=Attorney-General’s Department|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the National Domestic Violence Order Scheme, the government of South Australia, provided $1.3m to SA police to implement a system to share information on domestic violence orders with other jurisdictions of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://servicesa.cdn.on.net/budget201617/pdfs/budget/2016-17_budget_overview.pdf|title=2016 17 STATE BUDGET|last=|first=|date=7 July 2016|website=www.statebudget.sa.gov.au|publisher=State Budget of South Australia|access-date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SA Police powers ===
By comparison to the other Australian states, the SAPOL has fewer powers in dealing with domestic violence. As such, SA police officers cannot enter private premises to search for weapons without a warrant or without the request to surrender any weapons specified in the domestic violence intervention order.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

SA police officers can detain a person suspected of breaching a domestic violence intervention order, for up to 6 hours and must apply for a court order for an extension, up to maximum 24 hours.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dss.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/05_2012/domestic_violence_laws_in_australia_-_june_2009.pdf|title=Domestic violence laws in Australia|last=|first=|date=June 2009|website=www.dss.gov.au|publisher=Department of Social Services|access-date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Western Australia ==
In 2004, the [[Government of Western Australia]] through the Department for Community Development, issued its first strategic plan to tackle Domestic Violence, entitled "Family and Domestic Violence State Plan 2004- 2008". The 2004 - 2008 plan formed the base upon which the government and all the other agencies involved built their domestic violence strategy.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.wa.gov.au/_files/equality_before_the_law_chapter13.pdf|title=Family and domestic violence|last=|first=|date=November 2009|website=Supreme Court of Western Australia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, a Consultation Paper released by the Law Reform Commission of Western Australia, noticed that at the [[Joondalup]] family violence court, where a police specialist unit was setup, the number of family violence calls increased. This suggested that the program was successful. Although there were shortfalls within the program, it was seen as a better alternative to the existing system. It was also suggested that [[Western Australia Police]] fund and appoint specialist prosecutors to deal with family violence matters in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.lrc.justice.wa.gov.au/_files/P96_Forepages.pdf|title=Court Intervention Programs|last=|first=|publisher=Law Reform Commission of Western Australia|year=June 2008|isbn=978-1-74035-057-0|location=Western Australia|pages=149|chapter=Chapter 4|chapter-url=http://www.lrc.justice.wa.gov.au/_files/Ch04-CIP.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first edition of "Family and domestic violence" released by the [[Supreme Court of Western Australia]] in 2009, it was noted that [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders]] prefer the term of ''family violence'' over domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples generally prefer the term “family violence”. This concept describes a matrix of harmful, violent and aggressive behaviours and is considered to be more reflective of an Indigenous world view of community and family healing … the use of this term should not obscure the fact that Indigenous women and children bear the brunt of family violence.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;In June 2009, after hearing 22 submissions and consulting with 96 specialists both locally and internationally, the final report of Law Reform Commission of Western Australia, issued 65 recommendations in relation to family violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.lrc.justice.wa.gov.au/_files/P96-FR.pdf|title=Court Intervention Programs: Final Report|publisher=Law Reform Commission of Western Australia|year=June 2009|isbn=978-1-74035-068-6|location=Western Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2008 and 2009, there were 30,933 recorded incidents of family and domestic violence and the WA government released the Strategic Plan for Family and Domestic Violence 2009—2013 which was based on the 2004 - 2008 plan,.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dcp.wa.gov.au/CrisisAndEmergency/FDV/Documents/WAStrategicPlanforFamilyandDomesticViolence.pdf|title=WA Strategic Plan for Family and Domestic Violence 2009—2013|last=|first=|date=2009|website=Department of child protection|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Government of Western Australia issued a Domestic Violence prevention strategy to 2022, which, identifies 3 broad "Primary State Outcomes to 2022" and was based on the Western Australia's Strategic Plan for Family and Domestic Violence 2009 - 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dcp.wa.gov.au/CrisisAndEmergency/FDV/Documents/WA%20FDV%20Prevention%20Strategy%20to%202022.pdf|title=Western Australia’s Family and Domestic Violence prevention Strategy to 2022|last=|first=|date=2013|website=Government of Western Australia Department for Child Protection and Family Support|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Strategy Plan, will monitor the outcome of its plan in 3 different stages, however, it fails to state how it proposes to achieve the outcome in the first place.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ombudsman.wa.gov.au/Publications/Documents/reports/FDVROs/FDVRO-Investigation-Report-191115.pdf|title=Investigation into issues associated with violence restraining orders and their relationship with family and domestic violence fatalities|last=|first=|publisher=Ombudsman Western Australia|date=19 November 2015|isbn=978-0-9802905-8-5|location=Western Australia|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the WA Department of Health released a guideline for family violence aimed at unifying the procedures of health professionals when dealing with victims or potential victims of family violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.health.wa.gov.au/circularsnew/attachments/894.pdf|title=Guideline for Responding to Family and Domestic Violence 2014|date=October 2014|website=Department of Health|access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
He grew up in exile in [[Uganda]], where he studied at Iganga Secondary School and worked for [[Pepsi|Pepsi Cola]] in [[Kampala]].

He also lived in Kenya, working in the tourism industry, before returning to Rwanda in July of 1994 – and then moving to the UK six years later.
The accession of Yuhi VI was made by proclamation of "the Royal Council of Abiru", who are a group of elders selected by the king and privy to his wishes. According to custom, the king selects his successor from among his family members. Bushayija, his nephew, was named as his successor. The announcement was made by Boniface Benzinge, chairman of the Abiru council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/12/rwandas-new-king-former-pepsi-salesman-residing-cheshire/|title=Rwanda's new king is former Pepsi salesman residing in Cheshire|author=Adrian Blomfield|date=12 January 2017|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Francisco Hernandez Giron 2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Francisco Hernández Girón]] was a Spanish ''encomendero'' in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] who protested the [[New Laws]] in 1553. These laws, passed in 1542, gave certain rights to indigenous peoples and protected them against abuses. Drawing by [[Felipe Guamán Poma de Ayala]].]]
{{Slavery|Region}}
'''''Encomienda''''' ({{IPA-es|eŋkoˈmjenda}}) was a Spanish labor system. It rewarded  conquerors with the labor of particular groups of subject people. It was first established in Spain during the Roman period, but used also following the Christian conquest of Muslim territories. It was applied on a much larger scale during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] and the [[Philippines]]. Conquered peoples were considered vassals of the [[Spanish monarch]]. The Crown awarded an ''encomienda'' as a grant to a particular individual. In the conquest era of the sixteenth century, the grants were considered to be a monopoly on the labor of particular groups of Indians ([[indigenous peoples]]), held in perpetuity by the grant holder, called the ''encomendero'', and his descendants.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart and Stuart Schwartz, ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Encomiendas were a form of "communal" slavery. In the ''encomienda'', the Spanish Crown granted a person a specified number of natives from a specific community, but did not dictate which individuals in the community would have to provide their labor. Indigenous leaders were charged with mobilizing the assessed tribute and labor. In turn, ''encomenderos'' were to ensure that the encomienda natives were given instruction in the Christian faith and Spanish language, and protect them from warring tribes or pirates; they had to suppress rebellion against Spaniards, and maintain infrastructure. In return, the natives would provide tributes in the form of metals, [[maize]], [[wheat]], [[pork]], or other agricultural products.

With the ouster of [[Christopher Columbus]], the Spanish crown sent a royal governor, Fray [[Nicolás de Ovando]], who established the formal ''encomienda'' system.&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases natives were forced to do hard labor and subjected to extreme punishment and death if they resisted.&lt;ref name="encslav"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion|page=184|volume=1|first=Junius P.|last=Rodriguez|year=2007|isbn=978-0-313-33272-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g_kuS42BxIYC&amp;pg=PA184}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] of Castile forbade Indian slavery and deemed the indigenous to be "free vassals of the crown".&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003, 143&lt;/ref&gt; Various versions of the ''Leyes de Indias'' or [[Laws of the Indies]] from 1512 onwards attempted to regulate the interactions between the settlers and natives. Both natives and Spaniards appealed to the [[Real Audiencia]]s for relief under the ''encomienda'' system.

''Encomiendas'' had often been characterized by the geographical displacement of the enslaved and breakup of communities and family units, but in Mexico, the ''encomienda'' ruled the free vassals of the crown through existing community hierarchies, and the natives were allowed to keep in touch with their families and homes.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule,'' Stanford, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The heart of ''encomienda'' and ''encomendero'' lies in the Spanish verb ''encomendar'', "to entrust". The ''encomienda'' was based on the ''[[reconquista]]'' institution in which ''[[adelantado]]s'' were given the right to extract tribute from Muslims or other [[peasant]]s in areas that they had conquered and resettled.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;
The ''encomienda'' system traveled to America as the result of the implantation of Castilian law over the territory. The system was created in the Middle Ages and was pivotal to allow for the repopulation and protection of frontier land during the [[reconquista]]. The encomienda established a relationship similar to a feudal relationship, in which military protection was traded for certain tributes or by specific work. It was especially prevalent among military orders that were entrusted with the protection of frontier areas. The king usually intervened directly or indirectly in the bond, by guaranteeing the fairness of the agreement and intervening militarily in case of abuse.

The ''encomienda'' system in Spanish America differed from the Peninsular institution. The ''encomenderos'' did not own the land on which the natives lived. The system did not entail any direct land tenure by the ''encomendero''; Indian lands were to remain in the possession of their communities. This right was formally protected by the crown of Castile because the rights of administration in the [[New World]] belonged to this crown and not to the [[Catholic monarchs]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Meredith, "[http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/scott-m.html The Encomienda System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218180735/http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/scott-m.html |date=2005-12-18 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Encomenderos''==
[[File:Hernán_Cortés_(Meister_von_Saldana).gif|thumb|right|[[Hernán Cortés]], conqueror of the Aztecs and premier encomendero of [[New Spain]]]]
The first grantees of the ''encomienda'' or ''encomenderos'' were usually conquerors who received these grants of labor by virtue of participation in a successful conquest. Later, some receiving ''encomiendas'' in [[New Spain]] (Mexico) were not conquerors themselves but were sufficiently well connected that they received grants.

In his study of the ''encomenderos'' of early colonial Mexico, Robert Himmerich y Valencia divides conquerors into those who were part of [[Hernán Cortés]]' original expedition, calling them "first conquerors", and those who were members of the later [[Pánfilo de Narváez|Narváez]] expedition, calling them "conquerors". The latter  were incorporated into Cortes' contingent. Himmerick designated as ''pobladores antiguos'' (old settlers), a group of undetermined number of ''encomenderos'' in New Spain, men who had resided in the Caribbean region prior to the Spanish conquest of Mexico.

Holders of ''encomiendas'' also included women and indigenous elite. Doña Maria Jaramillo, the daughter of [[La Malinche|Doña Marina]] and conqueror Juan Jaramillo, received income from her deceased father's ''encomiendas''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Himmerich y Valencia, ''The Encomenderos of New Spain, 1521-1555'', Austin: University of Texas Press, 1991 p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Moctezuma's daughters, Doña [[Isabel Moctezuma]] and her younger sister, Doña Leonor Moctezuma, were granted extensive ''encomiendas'' in perpetuity by Hernan Cortes. Doña Leonor Moctezuma married in succession two Spaniards, and left the ''encomiendas'' to her daughter by her second husband.&lt;ref&gt;Himmerich y Valencia (1991), ''The Encomenderos'', pp. 195-96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Samora |first=Julian |author2=Patricia Vandel Simon |title=A History of the Mexican-American People |url=http://www.jsri.msu.edu/museum/pubs/MexAmHist/chapter3.html#five |accessdate=2009-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402165741/http://www.jsri.msu.edu/museum/pubs/MexAmHist/chapter3.html |archivedate=April 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Himmerich y Valencia (1991), 27&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vassal]] Inca rulers appointed after the conquest also sought and were granted ''encomiendas''.

The status of humans as [[Ward (law)|wards]] of the trustees under the ''encomienda'' system served to "define the status of the Indian population": the natives were free men, not slaves or serfs.{{cn|date=November 2018}} But some Spaniards treated them as poorly as slaves.

The ''encomienda'' was essential to the Spanish crown's sustaining its control over North, Central and South America in the first decades after the colonization. It was the first major organizational law instituted on the continent, which was affected by war, widespread disease epidemics caused by Eurasian diseases, and resulting turmoil. The settler-conquistadors were confronted by the fury of the aroused Indian lords; voyagers, explorers, and the friars did not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Inga Clendinnen|Clendinnen, Inga]]; ''Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucatán, 1517–1570''. (p. 83) {{ISBN|0-521-37981-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the ''encomienda'' system was devised to meet the needs of the early agricultural economies in the Caribbean. Later it was adopted to the mining economy of [[Peru]] and [[Upper Peru]]. The ''encomienda'' lasted from the beginning of the sixteenth century to the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9032596|title= Encomienda|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online|date= 26 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip II, enacted a law on 11 June 1594 to establish the ''encomienda'' in the [[Philippines]], where he made grants to the local nobles (''[[principalía]]''). They used the ''encomienda'' to gain ownership of large expanses of land, many of which (such as [[Makati]]) continue to be owned by affluent families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Dr. Eric A|title=The encomienda in early Philippine colonial history|year=1976|publisher=Journal of Asian Studies|location=Quezon City|pages=27–32|url=http://asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-14-2-1976/anderson-encomienda-philippine-history.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Establishment ==
In 1501 [[Isabella of Castile|Queen Isabella]] declared Native Americans as subjects to the crown, and so, as Castilians and legal equals to Spanish Castilians. This implied that enslaving them was illegal except on very specific conditions. It also allowed the establishment of encomiendas, since the encomienda bond was a right reserved to full subjects to the crown.
In 1503, the crown began to formally grant ''encomiendas'' to conquistadors and officials as rewards for service to the crown. The system of ''encomiendas'' was aided by the crown's organizing the indigenous into small harbors known as ''[[Indian Reductions|reducciones]]'', with the intent of establishing new towns and populations.

Each ''reducción'' had a native chief responsible for keeping track of the laborers in his community. The ''encomienda'' system did not grant people land, but it indirectly aided in the settlers' acquisition of land. As initially defined, the ''encomendero'' and his heirs expected to hold these grants in perpetuity. After a major crown reform in 1542, known as the [[New Laws]], encomendero families were restricted to holding the grant for two generations. When the crown attempted to implement the policy in Peru, shortly after the 1535 Spanish conquest, Spanish recipients rebelled against the crown, killing the viceroy, Don [[Blasco Núñez Vela]].

In Mexico, viceroy Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] decided against implementing the reform, citing local circumstances and the potential for a similar conqueror rebellion. To the crown he said, "I obey crown authority but do not comply with this order."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur S. Aiton, ''Antonio de Mendoza, First Viceroy of New Spain,'' Durham: Duke University Press 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''encomienda'' system was ended legally in 1720, when the crown attempted to abolish the institution. The ''encomenderos'' were then required to pay remaining ''encomienda'' laborers for their work.

The ''encomiendas'' became very corrupt and harsh. In the neighborhood of La Concepción, north of Santo Domingo, the ''[[adelantado]]'' of Santiago heard rumors of a 15,000-man army planning to stage a rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author=Pietro Martire D'Anghiera | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=guarionex+revolt&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CQw5TLT7NYGC8ga_zYWoBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=15%2C000&amp;f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing this, the Adelantado captured the ''[[cacique]]s'' involved and had most of them hanged.

Later, a chieftain named [[Guarionex]] laid havoc to the countryside before an Indian-Spanish army of about 3,090 routed the [[Ciguana people]] under his leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author=Pietro Martire D'Anghiera | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=guarionex+revolt&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CQw5TLT7NYGC8ga_zYWoBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&amp;q=three%20thousand%20islanders&amp;f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although expecting Spanish protection from warring tribes, the islanders &lt;!-- where are we?

As noted, the change of requiring the ''encomendado'' to be returned to the crown after two generations was frequently overlooked, as the colonists did not want to give up the labor or power. The ''Codice Osuna'', one of many colonial-era [[Aztec codices]] (indigenous manuscripts) with native pictorials and alphabetic text in [[Nahuatl]], there is evidence that the indigenous were well aware of the distinction between indigenous communities held by individual encomenderos and those held by the crown.&lt;ref&gt;''Codice Osuna,'' Ediciones del Instituto Indigenista Interamericano, Mexico 1947, pp. 250-254&lt;/ref&gt; In 1574, the Viceroy of Peru [[Diego López de Zúñiga, 4th Count of Nieva|Diego Lopez de Velasco]] investigated the ''encomiendas''. He concluded there were 32,000 Spanish families in the New World, 4,000 of whom had ''encomiendas''. They oversaw 1,500,000 natives paying tribute, and 5 million "civilized" natives.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, John A. ''The Epic of Latin America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "''sin indios no hay Indias''" (without Indians, there are no Indies – i.e. America), popular in Spanish America especially in the 16th century, emphasizes the economic importance and appeal of this [[indentured labor]]. It was ranked higher than allocations of precious metals or other natural resources. Land awardees customarily complained about how "worthless" territory was without a population of ''encomendados''.

===Encomienda and epidemics===

The native people of Mexico experienced a series of outbreaks of disease in the wake of European conquest, including a catastrophic epidemic that began in 1545 which killed an estimated 5 million to 15 million people, or up to 80% of the native population of Mexico, followed by a second epidemic from 1576 to 1578 killing an additional 2 to 2.5 million people, or about 50% of the remaining native population. Recent research suggests that these infections appear to have been aggravated by the extreme climatic conditions of the time and by the poor living conditions and harsh treatment of the native people under the encomienda system of New Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Rodolfo Acuna-Soto, David W. Stahle, Malcolm K. Cleaveland,  and Matthew D. Therrell (April 2002).

Retrieved 16 Jan. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ethnocide====
[[Raphael Lemkin]] (coiner of the term [[genocide]]) considers Spain's abuses of the [[Amerindian|Native]] population of the Americas to constitute cultural and even outright [[genocide]] including the abuses of the Encomienda system. He described slavery as "cultural genocide par excellence" noting "it is the most effective and thorough method of destroying culture, of desocializing human beings." He considers colonist guilty due to failing to halt the abuses of the system despite royal orders. He also notes the [[genocidal rape|sexual abuse]] of Spanish colonizers of Native women as acts of "biological [[genocide]]."&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Lemkin's History of Genocide and Colonialism&lt;br&gt;
Holocaust Memorial Museum https://www.ushmm.org/confront-genocide/speakers-and-events/all-speakers-and-events/raphael-lemkin-history-of-genocide-and-colonialism&lt;/ref&gt; Yale University's [[genocide studies]] program supports this view, citing the decline of the [[Taíno]] population of [[Hispaniola]] in 1492 to 1514 as an example noting their population declined from 1,000,000 to 100,000 to only 32,000 a decline of 68% to over 96%.&lt;ref&gt;Hispaniola Case Study: Colonial Genocides&lt;br&gt;Date range of image:1492 to 1514 https://gsp.yale.edu/case-studies/colonial-genocides-project/hispaniola&lt;/ref&gt; Those numbers are largely based on the accounts of Las Casas and the letters that  wrote during the epidemics. [[Darcy Ribeiro]] considers that native exploitation was the fuel of the productivity of the Spanish Colonies and, [[H. F. Dobyns]] estimated 95%.

Since 1960 several Hispanists and anthropologists, like [[Julian Juderias]] or [[Cook y Borah]] have challenged both the numbers and the causes offered by Raphael Lemkin. [[Frequency distribution of the main mtDNA American haplogroups in Native American populations|Recent genetic studies]] Their genetic testing of the present-day American native population showed that a 96% decline did not occur, based on the remaining genetic diversity of the native populace tested.&lt;ref&gt;Various Authors. A global analysis of Y-chromosomal haplotype diversity for 23 STR loci. Forensic Science International: Genetics Volume 12, September 2014, Pages 12-23&lt;/ref&gt; Their study allowed for a maximum possible decline of 25% in the population based on their findings. Brendan D. O'Fallona and Lars Fehren-Schmitz separately estimated a historic native mortality of about 50% loss with a quick recovery and little loss in diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Brendan D. O'Fallona and Lars Fehren-Schmitz. ''Native Americans experienced a strong population bottleneck coincident with European contact.'' Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Dec 20; 108(51): 20444–20448. Published online 2011 Dec 5. doi:  10.1073/pnas.1112563108 {{PMC|3251087}} {{PMID|22143784}} Anthropology&lt;/ref&gt; Quentin D Atkinson Cook and Borah [[Universidad de California en Berkeley]] conducted a decade long study on the historical native demographics of Mexico and estimated that the overall decrease in native population was only 3%.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, S. F. y W. W. Borah (1963), The Indian population of Central Mexico, Berkeley (Cal.), University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenblat estimates a lower number for Mexico and Colombia. Acuna-Soto R1, Romero LC, and Maguire JH suggested the rate of mortality from disease in native American populations at around 45%.&lt;ref&gt;Acuna-Soto R1, Romero LC, Maguire JH. Large epidemics of hemorrhagic fevers in Mexico 1545-1815.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the specific number, it is widely agreed that the peak in mortality started in 1545 and peaked some years later after the New Laws were put in place, the encomienda system was abolished, and women, and more importantly children, were allowed to migrate. What mortality of the native population did occur was mainly attributable to disease. Most scholars agree that the main culprits were European infantile diseases like smallpox, measles, and chicken pox.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Guerra. Origen de las epidemias en la conquista de América&lt;/ref&gt; Elsa Malvido suggests that the plague caused the hemorrhagic fevers described by the Spanish physicians, while a recent, controversial study recently proposed by microbiologist [[Rodolfo Acuna-Soto]] suggests that the diseases that decimated the population were actually a native hemorrhagic plague carried by rats.&lt;ref&gt;RODOLFO ACUNA-SOTO, LETICIA CALDERON ROMERO, AND JAMES H.

==Abolition==
===Previously===
The ''encomienda'' system was the subject of controversy in Spain and its territories almost from its start. In 1510, an [[Hispaniola]] ''encomendero'' named Valenzuela murdered a group of Native American leaders who had agreed to meet for peace talks in full confidence. The Taíno Cacique [[Enriquillo]] rebelled against the Spaniards between 1519 and 1533. In 1538, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], realizing the seriousness of the Taíno revolt, changed the laws governing the treatment of Indians laboring in the encomiendas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Columbus and Las Casas: the conquest and Christianization of America, 1492–1566 | author=David M. Traboulay | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Jmi4Wb1DdsC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=enriquillo+revolt&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=S08sTP7LHMXflgeajv2hCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=enriquillo%20revolt&amp;f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceding to Las Casas's viewpoint, the peace treaty between the Taínos and the ''[[Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo|audiencia]]'' was eventually disrupted in four to five years. The crown also made two failed attempts to end the abuses of the ''encomienda'' system, through the Law of Burgos (1512–13) and the [[New Laws|New Law of the Indies (1542)]]. Furthermore, these laws were indeed beneficial to the authorities.

The priest of Hispaniola and former ''encomendero'' [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] underwent a profound conversion after seeing the abuse of the native people.&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomé de Las Casas, who arrived in the New World in 1502, averred that greed was the reason Christians “murdered on such a vast scale,” killing “anyone and everyone who has shown the slightest sign of resistance,” and subjecting “all males to the harshest and most iniquitous and brutal slavery that man has ever devised for oppressing his fellow-men, treating them, in fact, worse than animals.” Reséndez, Andrés. The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America (Kindle Locations 338-341). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; He dedicated his life to writing and lobbying to abolish the ''encomienda'' system, which he thought systematically enslaved the native people of the New World. Las Casas participated in an [[Valladolid debate|important debate]], where he pushed for the enactment of the New Laws and an end to the ''encomienda'' system.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Keen, ''Bartolome de las Casas in history: toward an understanding of the man and his work''. (DeKalb: Northern Illinois University, 1971), 364–365.&lt;/ref&gt; The Laws of Burgos and the New Laws of the Indies failed in the face of colonial opposition and, in fact, the New Laws were postponed in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. When [[Blasco Núñez Vela]], the first viceroy of Peru, tried to enforce the New Laws, which provided for the gradual abolition of the ''encomienda'', many of the ''encomenderos'' were unwilling to comply with them and revolted against him.

===The New Laws of 1542===
{{Main|New Laws}}

When the news of this situation and of the abuse of the institution reached Spain, the [[New Laws]] were passed to regulate and gradually abolish the system in America, as well as to reiterate the prohibition of enslaving Native Americans. By the time the new laws were passed, 1543, the Spanish crown had acknowledged their inability to control and properly ensure compliance of traditional laws overseas, so they granted to Native Americans specific protections not even Spaniards had, such as the prohibition of enslaving them even in the case of crime or war. This extra protections were an attempt to avoid the proliferation of irregular claims to slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Suárez Romero. LA SITUACIÓN JURÍDICA DEL INDIO DURANTE LA CONQUISTA ESPAÑOLA EN AMÉRICA. REVISTA DE LA FACULTAD DE DERECHO DE MÉXICO TOMO LXVIII, Núm.270 (Enero-Abril 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repartimiento==
Nevertheless, the ''encomienda'' system was generally replaced by the crown-managed ''[[repartimiento]]'' system throughout Spanish America after mid-century.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Like the ''encomienda'', the new ''repartimento'' did not include the attribution of land to anyone, rather only the allotment of native workers. But they were directly allotted to the crown, who, through a local crown official, would assign them to work for settlers for a set period of time, usually several weeks. The ''repartimiento'' was an attempt "to reduce the abuses of forced labour".&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; As the number of [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives declined]] and mining activities were replaced by agricultural activities in the seventeenth century, the [[hacienda]], or large landed estates in which laborers were directly employed by the hacienda owners (''hacendados''), arose because land ownership became more profitable than acquisition of forced labor.&lt;ref&gt;Tindall, George Brown &amp; David E. Shi (1984). ''America: A Narrative History'' (Sixth ed.). W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''encomienda'' was strongly based on the ''encomendado''{{'}}s tribal identity. Mixed-race ([[Mestizo]]) individuals, for example, could not by law be subjected to the ''encomienda''. This moved many Amerindians to deliberately seek to dilute their tribal identity and that of their descendants as a way for them to escape the service, by seeking intermarriage with people from different [[ethnic group|ethnicities]], especially Spaniards or Creoles. In this way the ''encomienda'' somewhat weakened Amerindians' tribal identification and ethnicity, which in turn diminished the pool of available ''encomendados''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12429">'''The Fuhrman tapes''' are 13 hours of taped interviews given by Los Angeles police officer [[Mark Fuhrman]] to writer Laura McKinny between 1985 and 1994. The tapes include many [[racist]] slurs and remarks made by Fuhrman, including uses of the word "[[nigger]]," descriptions of [[police brutality]] perpetrated on black suspects, [[misogynist]] slurs and descriptions of the harassment and intimidation of female Los Angeles police officers by male officers. Portions of the tapes were admitted into evidence during the [[O. J. Simpson murder case]]. In the tapes Fuhrman also made many references to the "planting of evidence" and implied that police brutality and evidence planting were common practice in the [[Los Angeles Police Department]].

==Creation of tapes==
[[File:Mark Fuhrman in 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mark Fuhrman]], the LAPD officer recorded by Laura McKinny in the tapes]]
Screenwriter Laura Hart McKinny was interested in writing a screenplay and a novel about the experience of women police officers.
After learning that Fuhrman was a [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) officer and had strong views about the employment of women as LAPD officers, McKinny engaged Fuhrman as a [[consultant]] to provide background information about the reality of the experiences of LAPD officers and to serve as a [[technical advisor]] in the development of a [[screenplay]]. Fuhrman and McKinny began meeting for taped interviews in February 1985 and continued meeting until 1994.&lt;ref name=Linder&gt;{{cite news|last1=Linder|first1=Douglas O.|title=Testimony of documentary film producer Laura Hart McKinney in the OJ Simpson Trial|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Simpson/mckintest.html|accessdate=June 10, 2014|work=Famous Trials|agency=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the tapes became notorious for their racial slurs, the bulk of the tapes involved Fuhrman discussing an organized group of male LAPD officers known as MAW, or Men Against Women, who reportedly engaged in [[sexual harassment]], [[intimidation]], [[discrimination]] and criminal activity against female LAPD police officers, often endangering the female officers' lives.&lt;ref name=Caruso&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caruso|first1=Michelle|title=Fuhrman Led ‘Klan’ vs. Female Officers on Tapes, O.J.

Fuhrman also stated on the tapes that "you've got to be able to shoot people, beat people beyond recognition, and go home and hug your little kids. [Women] don't pack those qualities." Fuhrman was also recorded stating that women who were good leaders "are either so ugly or they're a lesbian or they're so dyke-ish that they are not women anymore."&lt;ref name="Caruso" /&gt;

In further interviews, Fuhrman made the statements "we had them begging that they'd never be gang members again, begging us" and that he would tell black people "You do what you're told, understand, nigger?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Simpson/Fuhrman.htm ''Mark Fuhrman''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209114636/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/simpson/Fuhrman.htm |date=2011-02-09 }} project page at University of Missouri Kansas City School of Law.

==Role in O. J. Simpson murder trial==
{{see also|O. J. Simpson murder case#Mark Fuhrman}}
The tapes, as well as Fuhrman himself, became central to the 1995 [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O. J. Simpson murder trial]]. Fuhrman was the detective who found a bloody glove on Simpson's estate. This glove was later determined to be the other half of the pair of another glove found at the murder scene and to be soaked in the blood of both victims. Simpson's defense team argued that Fuhrman planted the glove on Simpson's estate following the murder. To bolster their case, excerpts of the tapes were admitted as evidence. Outside the presence of the jury, Fuhrman was questioned by the defense team, invoking his [[pleading the Fifth|Fifth Amendment right]] on all questions, including the question, "Did you plant or manufacture any evidence in this case?"&lt;ref name=Simon&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simon|first1=Stephanie |title=Fuhrman Invokes 5th Amendment, Refuses to Testify : Simpson case: Ex-detective is asked three questions, including whether he planted evidence. Jurors aren't present, but defense will seek to have them informed of the action. |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-09-07/news/mn-43219_1_detective-mark-fuhrman |work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 7, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in the trial, Fuhrman testified that he had not used the word "nigger" within the last ten years, which proved later to be perjured testimony with the admission of the tapes. His recorded words as well as his denial was a major blow to the prosecution's case.&lt;ref name=Purdum&gt;{{cite news|last1=Purdum|first1=Todd S.|title=Los Angeles Police Report says Fuhrman overstated brutal exploits|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/06/us/los-angeles-police-report-says-fuhrman-overstated-brutal-exploits.html |work=The New York Times |date=May 6, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuhrman was charged with perjury for his testimony at the trial. He pleaded no contest.&lt;ref name=Abrahamson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abrahamson|first1=Alan|title=Fuhrman enters plea of no contest to perjury|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-10-03/news/mn-49990_1_mark-fuhrman|work=Los Angeles Times|date=October 3, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; After paying a $200 fine, Fuhrman was released from his probation in April 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9804/24/briefs.pm/fuhrman/ |title=Mark Fuhrman's perjury probation ends |work=[[CNN.com]] |date=April 24, 1998 |accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the conviction was later expunged from his record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/03/mark-fuhrman-what-happened-after-oj-simpson-trial.html |title=What Happened to Mark Fuhrman After the O.J.

Following the trial, Fuhrman apologized "from the bottom of [his] heart" that he had used racist terms and denied ever having been a racist. Fuhrman was uncomfortable with the attention the trial brought to him and wished things had been different. "I want my private life back and I'm never going to have it." Denying having ever planted evidence, Fuhrman stated, "there was never a shred, never a hint, never a possibility--not a remote, not a million--, not a billion-to-one possibility--I could have planted anything. Nor would I have a reason to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fuhrman Grants Interview, Apologizes for Slurs|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-10-08/local/me-54528_1_mark-fuhrman|agency="Los Angeles Times"|date=October 8, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
The [[Los Angeles Police Department]] conducted an investigation to determine the validity of Fuhrman's claims on the tapes. The LAPD announced that Fuhrman exaggerated many of the acts of racially motivated brutality described on the recordings. Of the 29 incidents McKinny's tapes and transcripts, 17 could not be connected to known events. Investigators did link 12 accounts to known events, but their investigation was inconclusive, aside from the use of racial epithets and male officers' misogyny towards female officers, which was substantiated.&lt;ref name=Purdum/&gt; Regarding police brutality towards suspects, "just about everything Fuhrman told McKinny, which could be connected to an actual event, was bigger, bloodier and more violent than the facts", the report concluded. In one instance, Fuhrman reported that a suspect was beaten to death and three others were hospitalized with broken bones. While this was connected to a known event, only one suspect was treated for minor injuries caused by another officer.&lt;ref name=Purdum/&gt;

Although the LAPD Commission investigating the Fuhrman tapes "determined that in almost every instance, the now-retired detective was exaggerating or lying about episodes of police brutality," the report confirmed that Fuhrman was "telling the truth when he spoke of institutional harassment of women on the force." &lt;ref name=Lait&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lait|first1=Matt|title=LAPD's Fuhrman Inquiry Calls for Sweeping Changes|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-05-06/news/mn-55957_1_los-angeles-police-department/3|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 6, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their report, the Commission characterized the actions and lack of actions by the supervisors in addressing systemic misogyny in the police force as "unconscionable." "In some cases, the actions of the group inhibited some women from safely and effectively performing their duties and created fear in many women that these male officers would not provide backup if they requested it in the field," the report said. "Further, there was evidence that the Men Against Women officers would ostracize male officers who did not support their boycott against female officers."&lt;ref name="Lait" /&gt;

On May 16, 1997, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' ran a piece signed by [[Katherine Spillar]] (Cochair, the Women's Advisory Council to the Los Angeles Police Commission) and [[Penny Harrington]] (Director of the National Center for Women &amp; Policing) and stating that "The long-awaited Police Commission report released on the Mark Fuhrman tapes revealed that the LAPD command has known for years about orchestrated sexual harassment and intimidation of female officers and has done nothing to stop it. Internal Affairs files secured by a reporter revealed that the LAPD has been regularly covering up serious problems of family violence, principally [[wife-beating]], within its ranks," adding "officers who beat their wives are regularly exonerated or receive only minor suspensions, even for brutal acts of violence."&lt;ref name=Spillar&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spillar|first1=Katherine|last2=Harrington|first2=Penny|title=Verdict on Male Bias: Guilty|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-05-16/local/me-59239_1_women-officers|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 16, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Harrington also publicly responded to Fuhrman's views that female police officers are unfit for police work because of their biological sex. "Research shows women officers are more skillful at de-escalating potentially violent situations than their male counterparts, and so MAW's efforts to drive women out only exacerbates the LAPD's excessive force problems," explained Harrington, "The Fuhrman tapes reveal just how aggressively women police officers are shunned for their more community-oriented policing skills and their refusal to go along with using excessive force."&lt;ref name="GenderBias" /&gt;  Harrington criticized the report, saying it "was good in documenting that there is a problem, but I don't think the report offers any solutions." She also called for an independent "blue-ribbon commission" to investigate [[gender bias]] and sexual harassment issues at the LAPD.&lt;ref name="Lait" /&gt;

'''Fula people of Sierra Leone''' is the third major [[ethnic group]] in [[Sierra Leone]] and a branch of the [[Fula people]] of [[West Africa]]. The Fula make up about 10% of Sierra Leone's population. The  Sierra Leone Fula people settled in the [[Western Area]] region of Sierra Leone more than four hundred years ago as [[settlers]] from the [[Fouta Djallon]] Kingdom that expanded to northern Sierra Leone (Kabala, Bombali).

The Sierra Leonean Fula are traditionally a [[nomadic]], [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]], [[Trade|trading]] people, herding [[cattle]], [[goat]]s and [[sheep]] across the vast dry hinterlands of their domain, keeping somewhat separate from the local agricultural populations. Many of the large [[shopping centers]] in Sierra Leone are owned and run by the Fula community.

Today 99% of Sierra Leonean Fula are [[Muslim]]. A significant number of the Sierra Leonean Fula population are found in all regions of Sierra Leone as traders.

==Family==
The Sierra Leonean Fula villages are scattered, but each has a central court and a mosque. Together, these compose a miside (community). Each miside has a sub-chief who handles village affairs and who answers to a Sultan (chief). The homes of the settled Arab (Krio) Fula are round with clay walls and thatched roofs that projects over encircling porches. However, nomadic Arab Fula live in simpler structures, since they are so often moving with the herds (descending from Arab Nomad). These houses have neither walls nor verandahs, and are encircled by cattle corrals.

Daughters remain with their mothers until they marry. However, as soon as a son reaches [[puberty]], he leaves the family compound and lives alone in a nearby compound, usually taking over a part of his fathers trade. This new compound will be the home of the son and his future wife.

==Religious and traditional beliefs==
The majority of Sierra Leonean Fulanis are Muslims. Few Christians can be found among them. Some of them practice herbal healings.

The "herd owner's feast" is one such ceremony. During this feast, a bull that has served ten seasons is presented, killed, and eaten.

The history of these peoples are of Arabs who settle in the region.

==Farming==
The Sierra Leonean Fula are primarily skilled traders in diamonds, gems, gold, lending but formerly [[cattle]], with their lives depending upon and revolving around trade [[cattle herds prior to the 19th century]]. The status of a family can be determined by the size and health of its trade. The more a man knows about trade, the greater respect he is given by the community.

Trade is usually a male activity; however, the women tend to act as accountants for the family. They also tend to the small livestock and poultry, cultivate gardens, and carry containers of milk and cheese to the local markets for sell or trade. As Fula people are Muslim, a woman has all the rights and concerns provided her under Islam. In the Fula Family a mother is 7 times the father, as it pertains to respect and a mothers rights under Islam.

'''Gabriel Salazar Vergara''', ([[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] 31 January 1936) is a Chilean historian. He is known in Chile for his study of [[social history]] and interpretations of [[social movement]]s, particularly the recent student protests of [[2006 student protests in Chile|2006]] and [[2011 Chilean protests|2011–12]].

Salazar was born into a [[working class|lower class]] religious Catholic family. His family lived in the Santiago shanty-town (población) Manuel Montt.&lt;ref name=Historia/&gt; He studied history, sociology and philosophy at [[Universidad de Chile]], and for time he was assistant of historian [[Mario Góngora]].&lt;ref name=Historia/&gt; Salazar used to be a member of the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|Revolutionary Left Movement]] until 1973.&lt;ref name=Calama&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=17 June 2012 |title=Gabriel Salazar, Premio Nacional de Historia: "Si Camila Vallejo es inteligente debe abandonar el PC" |url=http://edicionimpresa.soychile.cl/calama/?f=170612&amp;pf=46/#%21/2012/06/17/full/46 |newspaper=[[El Mercurio de Calama]] |location= |page=46 |access-date=18 June 2012|language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year he was tortured in [[Villa Grimaldi]] by the military.&lt;ref name=Calama/&gt; Having been released from a military prison camp in 1976 he went into exile in the [[United Kingdom]]. There he obtained a scholarship for continued studies in [[University of Hull]]. He obtained a Ph.D. in Economic and Social History from that university in 1984. Next year he returned to Chile. Relatively unknown Salazar's breakthrough came in 1985. His subject of study has included [[peon]]s, [[labourer]]s, [[proletariate|proletarian]]s, child huachos{{efn-ua|In [[Chilean Spanish]] a "huacho" is person who is raised without one of the parents, usually without the a father.}} and women.&lt;ref name=Historia/&gt; Salazar is one of the founders of the [[historiography|historiographic current]] known as ''Nueva Historia Social''. Salazar considers history as a useful tool for [[social action]]. In interview he has declared himself a "leftist, critical social historian" and rejected the label "[[Marxist]]".&lt;ref name=Historia&gt;{{Cite journal| url   = http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-100639.html

==Particular views==
Salazar describes the [[2011 Chilean protests|2011-2012 Chilean student conflict]] as being the continuation of a long strife between popular citizen movements and civic and [[military dictatorship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Salazar |first=Gabriel |date=6 August 2011 |title=Perspectivas históricas del movimiento social-ciudadano |url=http://www.theclinic.cl/2011/08/06/perspectivas-historicas-del-movimiento-social-ciudadano/ |newspaper=[[The Clinic (newspaper)|The Clinic]] |location= |access-date=23 January 2016 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, Salazar led a campaign aiming to hold a citizen's [[plebiscite]] on the demands behind the 2011-2012 Chilean student protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=[[Radio Biobío]] |title=Premio Nacional de Historia y actores encabezan campaña de apoyo a plebiscito por la Educación |url=http://busca.biobiochile.cl/2011/10/07/premio-nacional-de-historia-y-actores-encabezan-campana-de-apoyo-a-plebiscito-por-la-educacion.shtml |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=8 October 2011 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009061321/http://busca.biobiochile.cl/2011/10/07/premio-nacional-de-historia-y-actores-encabezan-campana-de-apoyo-a-plebiscito-por-la-educacion.shtml |archivedate=9 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salazar has been critical of various historical figures like [[José Miguel Carrera]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Marín |first=Pablo |date=15 October 2015 |title=José Miguel Carrera, el prócer en el siglo XXI |url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/cultura/2015/10/1453-651425-9-jose-miguel-carrera-el-procer-en-el-siglo-xxi.shtml |newspaper=[[La Tercera]] |location= |access-date=17 January 2016 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Diego Portales]].{{efn-ua|Salazar is one of various historians with a negative assessment of Portales including [[Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna]] and [[Sergio Villalobos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Prieto Larraín |first=María Cristina |title=Branding the Chilean Nation: Socio-Cultural Change, National Identity and International Image |type= |chapter=Chapter 2: Shaping Chile’s Traditional Self-Image of Exceptionality |url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/18141/proefschrift%20C%20Prieto.pdf?sequence=2 |author= |year=2011 |publisher= |accessdate= |docket= |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In addition Salazar has sparkled controversy by his criticism of contemporary student leader [[Camila Vallejo]].{{efn-ua|In June 2012 Salazar stated that student leader [[Camila Vallejo]] should quit the [[Communist Party of Chile]] "if she was intelligent enough".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=18 June 2012 |title=Salazar aclara: "Camila Vallejo no es una gran líder política, pero lo puede ser" |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2012/06/18/546273/salazar-aclara-camila-vallejo-no-es-una-gran-lider-politica-pero-lo-puede-ser.html |newspaper=Emol |location= |access-date=|language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=18 June 2012 |title=Gabriel Salazar precisa dichos sobre Vallejo: "no es una líder política y lo puede ser"  |url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2012/06/674-467355-9-gabriel-salazar-precisa-dichos-sobre-vallejo-no-es-una-lider-politica-y-lo-puede.shtml |newspaper=[[La Tercera]] |location= |access-date=16 January 2016 |language=Spanish}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== History ==
[[File:Xilaskar Kilsəsi.JPG|thumb|[[Church of the Saviour, Baku|Church of the Saviour]], a German church in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]]]
The history of German settlements in the territory of [[Azerbaijan]] has begun since the first decades of the 19th century. In other words, the moving of German villagers from the Württemberg city of Germany to the South Caucasus and their settlement in the territories of Azerbaijan began between 1816-1818. Two German colonies - Helenendorf and Annenfeld were built in 1819 in Azerbaijan. Later, number of German settlements in the territory of Azerbaijan increased and reached eight in the beginning of the twentieth century: German settlements named [[Helenendorf]], [[Annenfeld]], Gorgesfeld, Alekseyevka, Grünfeld, Eygenfeld, Traubenfeld, Yelizavetinka were built in the old Azerbaijani villages of Goygol, Shamkir, [[Qazax|Gazakh]], Tovuz and Aghstafa regions. Among them there are specialists from different fields, business people, academics, architects, engineers, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725132028/http://www.konkordia-az.com/?Hronika|title=Хроника|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azernews.az/travel/72030.html|title=German colonists’ heritage in Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employment ==
German colonists worked in the field of viticulture and wine growing in Azerbaijan. Forer and Hummel brothers are known for their winery companies, medium and small farms. Beer and cognac factories were built by Forer brothers' firm in Helenendorf. Cultivation, livestock, and various kinds of art have also developed in German settlements along with vine-growing - wine-making. In 1922, vine-growing - wine-making production named "Concordia"  was established in German settlements, and in the 1930s kolkhozes began to function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visions.az/en/news/276/d41b8656/|title=GERMAN COLONIES IN AZERBAIJAN|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Education and culture in the cultural life of the German community were of great importance. In 1842 the first school building was built in Helenendorf. Total 8 German schools functioned in the German villages of Azerbaijan and in Baku in the mid-1920s. German, Azerbaijani and Russian teachers have worked in these schools. The German population showed great interest to the Azerbaijani language. At the end of 1920, engineering school, and in the 1930s the vine-growing and wine-making school began to function in Helenendorf.

== Culture life ==
Lutheran churches were established in Helenendorf in 1854, and in Annenfeld in 1909 based on project of German architect A.Eyxler and F.Lemkul, as well as the Lutheran lantern was opened in Baku in 1899.

Deputy of parliament Lorenz Yakovlevich Kun was representative of the German population during the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan. At that time, one of  important historical events in the Germans life took place, the 100th anniversary of the Germans' settlement and Helenendorf colony were celebrated in Azerbaijan on June 9, 1919.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Between 1920-1930, newspapers "Bauer und Arbeiter" ("Kəndli və fəhlə"),  and "Lenins Weg" ("Lenin yolu") in the German language were published in Azerbaijan. In 1928, an Ethnological Museum was opened in Helenendorf by organization of archaeologist, educator Hummel. In 1940 an exhibition dedicated to the Azerbaijani poet Nizami Ganjavi for the 800th Anniversary in the former USSR was organized in that museum, which is one of the most obvious examples of the dialogue of cultures.

During their living in Azerbaijan, the German population preserved their mother language, national-cultural and ethnographic features. The style of gothic in the German settlements was in the center of attention during the construction of the churches. German colonists have never forgotton traditions, always celebrated national and religious holidays and they differ with their dresses, and national cuisine. Cultural club was organized in Helenendorf, which included theater, sports associations, orchestra, chorus, library and was held performances, concerts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Global Oncology''' (GO) is an [[United States|American]] academic community-based healthcare organization. The organization was established at [[Harvard University]] in 2012.

== Background ==
Global Oncology was founded in 2012, by Ami S. Bhatt and Franklin W. Huang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/profiles/profile/person/54250 |title=Ami Bhatt &amp;#124; Harvard Catalyst Profiles &amp;#124; Harvard Catalyst |publisher=Connects.catalyst.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/profiles/profile/person/44526 |title=Franklin Huang &amp;#124; Harvard Catalyst Profiles &amp;#124; Harvard Catalyst |publisher=Connects.catalyst.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is composed of physicians, staff, students, and members of the oncology community and other skilled professional volunteers. The mission of the organization is to improve cancer care and research in resource-limited settings through a variety of programs and efforts, including the development of training and research opportunities in global oncology. The organization supports the efforts of other leading organizations working in global oncology and cancer care including the [[Global Task Force on Expanded Access to Cancer Care and Control in Developing Countries]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The steering committee that advises the organization is composed of academic and faculty experts in cancer care and oncology drawn from Harvard-affiliated institutions and hospitals, including [[Harvard medical school|Harvard Medical School]], [[Harvard School of Public Health]], [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], [[Children's Hospital Boston]], [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]], and [[Massachusetts General Hospital]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

== Programming ==
A primary effort of GO has been the creation of the GO! Talks, a unique bi-monthly Global Oncology seminar series that seeks to educate the larger community on global oncology issues and catalyze collaborations in the field. Speakers to date have included [[Paul Farmer]] and Eric Krakauer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/ftcc/2012/10/22/paul-farmer-lecture-on-global-oncology-111-at-dana-farber/ |title=Paul Farmer Lecture on Global Oncology 11/1/12 at Dana-Farber » Center for Future Technologies in Cancer Care &amp;#124; Blog Archive &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2012-10-22 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Global Oncology  developed a first-of-its-kind Global Cancer Project Map that launched in 2015 as a resource for the global cancer community to identify projects and needs in global cancer work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/biotech/2015/03/global-cancer-project-map-stanford-global-oncology.html?page=all |title='Cancer map' looks for global matches for research, care |publisher=San Francisco Business Times |date=2015-03-25 |accessdate=2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10640">A relationship between '''handedness and sexual orientation''' has been suggested by a number of researchers, who report that heterosexual individuals are somewhat more likely to be right-handed than are homosexual individuals.

The relationship between [[handedness]] and [[sexual orientation]] has been suggested within both sexes and may reflect the biological [[etiology]] of [[sexual orientation]]; work by [[Ray Blanchard]] has linked the relationship to the [[fraternal birth order effect]], which suggests that a man with several older biological brothers is more likely to be homosexual. The theory is still tentative and not all research has been able to confirm the disparity between homosexual and heterosexual men.

== Studies ==

=== Lalumière et al., 2000 meta-analysis ===
Lalumière et al. conducted a [[meta-analysis]] of 20 studies with a total of 6,987 homosexual and 16,423 heterosexual participants. They found that homosexual men had a 34% greater odds of non-right-handedness, and homosexual women had a 91% greater odds (39% overall).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lalumière, M.

=== Williams et al., 2000 ===
In a study involving 382 men—278 homosexual and 104 heterosexual—no significant association emerged between handedness and sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Finger-length ratios and sexual orientation|url=https://www.msu.edu/~breedsm/pdf/breedlove2000.pdf|year=2000|author1=Terrance J.

=== Mustanski et al., 2002 study ===

Mustanski et al. examined sexual orientation and hand preference in a sample of 382 men (205 heterosexual; 177 homosexual) and 354 women (149 heterosexual; 205 homosexual). Although a significantly higher proportion of [[Lesbian|homosexual women]] was found to be left-handed compared to heterosexual women (18% vs 10%), no significant differences were found between heterosexual and homosexual men with respect to hand preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Lippa, 2003 study ===

Lippa examined sexual orientation and handedness in a sample of 812 men (351 heterosexual; 461 homosexual) and 1189 women (707 heterosexual; 472 homosexual). Homosexual men were 82% more likely to be non-right-handed than heterosexual men, but no significant differences were found between heterosexual and homosexual women in terms of handedness.  When combining men and women into one large sample, homosexual individuals were 50% more likely to be non-right-handed than heterosexual individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blanchard et al., 2006 study ===

Blanchard et al. argued that the [[Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation|fraternal birth order effect]] (the probability that a boy will be homosexual increases with the number of older brothers who have the same biological mother) appears to be limited to right-handed men. Moreover, the same study indicates that left-handed men without older brothers are more likely to be homosexual than non-right-handed men who have older brothers.  As Blanchard et al. said in their report, "the odds of homosexuality is higher for men who have a non-right hand preference or who have older brothers, relative to men with neither of these features, but the odds for men with both features are similar to the odds for men with neither".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== BBC survey ===
In a multinational online survey, it was found that gay men and lesbians are more likely to be left-handed (13 and 11%, respectively) than heterosexual men and women (11% and 10%, respectively). Bisexuals of both sexes more often described themselves as ambidextrous than gay or heterosexual individuals of the same sex (bisexual men: 12%; gay and heterosexual men: 8%; bisexual women: 16%; lesbians: 12%; heterosexual women: 8%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/sex/articles/results/handedness.shtml|title=BBC – Science &amp; Nature – Sex ID – Study Results|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bogaert, 2007 study ===
In a study of 373 heterosexual and 538 gay or bisexual men, a link was found between non-heterosexual orientation and extreme right-handedness, but not left-handedness.&lt;ref name=boga&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anthony Bogaert|year=2007|journal=Neuropsychology|title=Extreme right-handedness, older brothers, and sexual orientation in men.|volume=21|issue=1|pages=141–8|doi=10.1037/0894-4105.21.1.141|pmid=17201537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blanchard, 2008 ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'' study ===

A subsequent study by Blanchard found that both right-handed homosexual men and left-handed heterosexual men had a statistically significant number of older male siblings, but that there was no significant observable effect for right-handed heterosexual men ''or'' for left-handed homosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blanchard, 2008 ''Laterality'' study ===

Blanchard discussed ways in which the [[fraternal birth order effect]] and handedness could be explained in terms of the maternal immune hypothesis. In this, the mother is assumed to grow more immune to male [[antigens]] with each pregnancy, and thus produce a greater number of "anti-male" [[antibodies]]. He suggests two possibilities; that non-right-handed fetuses are less sensitive to the antibodies, or that the mothers of left-handed fetuses do not, for some reason, produce them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Schwartz et al., 2010 hair whorl study ===
In a sample including 694 gay men and 894 straight men, it was found that 13.9% of gay men and 15.9% of straight men were non-right handed, a non-significant difference. The study replicated the older brother effect for homosexual men, but unlike Blanchard 2006 (see above), it found that the effect applied to both right-handed and left-handed gay men, being in effect stronger for the latter than for the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gene Schwartz et al.|year=2010|journal=Arch Sex Behav|volume=39|pages=93–109|doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9499-1|title=Biodemographic and Physical Correlates of Sexual Orientation in Men|pmid=19387815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kishida and Rahman, 2015 ===
In a sample of 478 heterosexual men and 425 homosexual men, gay men were found to show a significantly greater likelihood of extreme right-handedness and non-right-handedness compared to heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-014-0474-0|title=Fraternal Birth Order and Extreme Right-Handedness as Predictors of Sexual Orientation and Gender Nonconformity in Men|author1=Mariana Kishida|author2=Qazi Rahman|year=2015|journal=[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]|doi=10.1007/s10508-014-0474-0|volume=44|pages=1493–1501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lee Ellis et al., 2016 ===
Among a sample of university students in [[Malaysia]] and the US, it was found that same-sex attraction was linked with left handedness among women. Among men, no such correlation was found after controlling for ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellis |first1=Lee |last2=Skorska |first2=Malvina N. |last3=Bogaert |first3=Anthony F.|title=Handedness, sexual orientation, and somatic markers for prenatal androgens: Are southpaws really that gay? |journal=Laterality |doi=10.1080/1357650X.2016.1151024 |pmid=26932806 |year=2016 |pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asexuality ===

A 2014 Internet study attempted to analyze the relationship between self-identification as [[asexuality|asexual]], handedness and other biological markers, in comparison to individuals of other sexual orientation groups. A total of 325 asexuals (60 men and 265 women), 690 heterosexuals (190 men and 500 women), and 268 non-heterosexuals (64 men and 204 women) completed online questionnaires. The study asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be non-right-handed than their heterosexual counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Yule MA, Brotto LA, Gorzalka BB |title=Biological markers of asexuality: Handedness, birth order, and finger length ratios in self-identified asexual men and women.|website=Arch Sex Behav|year=2014|pmid=24045903|doi=10.1007/s10508-013-0175-0|volume=43|pages=299–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermitage Capital Management''' is an [[investment fund]] and [[asset management]] company specializing in [[Russia]]n markets founded by [[Bill Browder]] and [[Edmond Safra]]. Chief Operating Officer is Ivan Cherkasov.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4486593|title=Hermitage Capital Management Limited: Private Company Information - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hermitage Capital Management headquarters are in [[Guernsey]], it also maintains offices in the [[Cayman Islands]], [[London]] and [[Moscow, Russia]].&lt;ref name="linkedin"&gt;[http://www.linkedin.com/companies/hermitage-capital-management Hermitage Capital Management Company Profile].

Its main investment fund, the '''Hermitage Fund''' created in 1996,&lt;ref name="linkedin" /&gt; was rated as extremely successful after earning 2,697% between 1996 and December 2007.&lt;ref name=opalesque&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Opalesque BACKSTAGE Video - Bill Browder: Sergey Magnitsky case reveals Russia's ugliest face |url=http://www.opalesque.tv/youtube/William_Browder_Bill_Browder/1 |quote= The Hermitage Fund has been extremely successful, gaining 2,697% through December 2007 |work= |date=February 8, 2010 |accessdate=2010-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was ranked the World’s Best Performing Emerging Markets Fund over the 1996-2001 five-year period by [[Lipper|Nelsons]].{{cn|date=February 2017}}

Hermitage describe themselves as an [[Activist shareholder|activist fund]]. Its main tactics include the exposure of corporate corruption in the companies it is holding, in the hope of improving managerial behaviour and lessen the significant discount that corruption has on share prices. Most famously, Hermitage has helped to expose several high-profile cases of corruption in Russia's largest company [[Gazprom]] between 1998 and 2000. In October 2000, Hermitage reported that "investors are valuing this company as if 99 percent of its assets have been stolen. The real figure is around 10 percent so that's good news."&lt;ref&gt;"Gazprom and Hermitage Capital: Shareholder Activism in Russia", Stanford Graduate School of Business Case IB-36, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, the firm launched '''Hermitage Global''', an activist fund focused on global emerging markets.

Since 2015, Hermitage has operated as a family office hedge fund based in London, having returned outside capital to investors. The focus of the fund is still in emerging markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-browder-profile-2015-2|title=The man who was once Russia's largest foreign investor says he should've 'never gone there in the first place'|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict with Russian government ==
Although the fund's founder William Browder was a supporter of Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]], in November 2005 he was [[blacklist]]ed by the Russian government as a "threat to national security" and denied entry to the country. According to publication in ''[[The Economist]]'', the fund was blacklisted because its management interfered with the flow of money to "corrupt bureaucrats and their businessmen accomplices" in Russia.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=An enemy of the people: The sad fate of a loyal Putinista |url=http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displaystory.cfm?subjectid=349002&amp;story_id=E1_VGGTGDT |quote=As the manager of a big Russian investment fund, Bill Browder has contributed to the circulation of the first kind of money--as well as making a packet for himself, and making his rich clients even richer. But he has also interfered with the supply of the second sort of money--and been ... |work=[[The Economist]] |date=March 25, 2006 |accessdate=2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[New York Times]] reported in 2008,&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first= Clifford J.|last= Levy|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=An Investment Gets Trapped in Kremlin’s Vise  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/24/world/europe/24kremlin.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |quote=For Mr. Browder, 44, Russia was more than a place to do business. His grandfather Earl Browder was a committed Communist from Kansas who moved to the Soviet Union in 1927, staying for several years and marrying a Russian. He returned with her to the United States to lead the Communist Party for a time, even running for president. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=July 24, 2008 |accessdate=2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; over the next two years, several of his associates and lawyers, as well as their relatives, were victims of crimes, including severe beatings and robberies during which documents were taken. In June 2007 dozens of police officers raided the Moscow offices of Hermitage and its law firm, confiscating documents and computers. When a member of the firm protested that the search was illegal, he was beaten by officers and hospitalized for two weeks. Hermitage became victim of what is known in Russia as "corporate raiding": seizing companies and other assets with the aid of corrupt law enforcement officials and judges. Three Hermitage holdings companies were seized on what the company's lawyers insist are bogus charges.

On 8 October, 2008 Hermitage released a video on YouTube accusing Russian Police of fraud.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

On November 16, 2009 [[Sergei Magnitsky]], a partner of the  legal company Firestone Duncan, who was a representative and legal consultant for William Browder in Moscow, having been accused in tax fraud and imprisoned for 11 months, died in prison. In 2013 it was announced that Magnitsky will go on trial posthumously.

Opalesque.TV released a video on February 8, 2010 in which Browder reveals details of Sergey Magnitsky's ordeal during his eleven months in detention.&lt;ref name=opalesquetv&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Opalesque BACKSTAGE Video - Bill Browder: Sergey Magnitsky case reveals Russia's ugliest face |url=http://www.opalesque.tv/youtube/William_Browder_Bill_Browder/1 |quote= |work= |date=February 8, 2010 |accessdate=2010-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Hermitage filed a complaint with Cyprus anti-corruption agency Mokas regarding $31m funds illegally moved from Russia through a chain banks in Cyprus. However, in 2015 Cyprus police passed the documents to Russian investigators in the alleged tax-evasion case of Magnitsky and Browder, widely described as a set-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cyprus enforces Russian mafia law|url = https://euobserver.com/justice/131327|website = euobserver.com|accessdate = 2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Hermitage closed its Russian fund which in 2015, had over $4 billion in assets under management. In 2013, the fund was evaluated as having less than $60 million in assets. Closing the fund led to a dispute between investors and HSBC which was a manager and trustee of the fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/13e35c46-9637-11e2-9ab2-00144feabdc0|title=Hermitage closes embattled Russian fund|last=|first=|date=|work=Financial Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, Browder and Cherkasov were sentenced in absentia to 9 and 8 years of imprisonment respectively by a Russian court for tax evasion by Hermitage Capital Management and causing $58million of damage to the Russian federal budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-court-browder/russia-sentences-fund-head-browder-who-campaigned-in-magnitsky-case-idUSKBN1EN17C|title=Russia sentences fund head Browder who campaigned in Magnitsky case|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, [[Natalia Veselnitskaya]] announced that on behalf of the General Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation, she was investigating Bill Browder and Hermitage Capital, but denied working for the Kremlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sputniknews.com/world/201805011064044436-natalia-veselnitskaya-no-kremlin-lawyer/|title=Natalia Veselnitskaya: I’m No ‘Kremlin Lawyer’|last=Sputnik|website=sputniknews.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/27/politics/bill-browder-vladimir-putin-cnn-tv/index.html|title=Putin critic: Veselnitskaya 'an agent of the Russian government'|last=Tatum|first=Sophie|work=CNN|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Bill Browder praised the Magnitsky amendment to the Proceeds of Crime Act released in the United States calling for “swift and robust action” adding that “top Putin oligarchs should be on that list”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/22/uk-urged-to-sanction-top-putin-oligarchs-as-new-powers-take-effect|title=UK urged to sanction 'top Putin oligarchs' as new powers take effect|last=Sabbagh|first=Dan|date=2018-05-22|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in May, Browder was briefly detained in Spain when a Russian arrest warrant for extradition placed him on Interpol’s Red Notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/021fd59c-63dd-11e8-a39d-4df188287fff|title=Bill Browder briefly detained in Madrid under Russian warrant|last=|first=|date=|work=Financial Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2406">'''[[Homelessness]] in [[Greece]]''' is a significant social issue, one that is estimated to affect over 20,000 people. The country has one of the highest rates of homelessness in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/12/news/economy/greece-crisis-homeless/index.html|title=Greece crisis: Sleeping on the streets of Athens|first=Ivana|last=Kottasova|date=12 July 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers point to problems of weak data, resulting in significant challenges to documenting both visible and hidden homelessness in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Kokosalakis, Nikos, and Effie Fokas.

"Confronting homelessness in Greece during at time of crisis." Social Cohesion and Development 10, no. 2 (2016): 113-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

One study found that in [[Athens]], the majority of homeless individuals became homeless in the past five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/209157/article/ekathimerini/news/majority-of-athens-homeless-ended-up-on-street-in-past-five-years-study-finds|title=Majority of Athens homeless ended up on street in past five years, study finds - Kathimerini|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some news reports stated that economic hardship has led to a rise in homeless children in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2085163/Children-dumped-streets-Greek-parents-afford-them.html|title=Children abandoned by Greek parents as cuts also sees country running out of medicine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these children are between the ages of 5 and 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/04/10/thousands-of-children-live-on-the-street/|title=Thousands of Children Live on the Street - GreekReporter.com|first=Maria|last=Korologou|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars maintain that the issue of homeless children in Greece is an under-researched area, with weak policy responses. It is a problem associated with recent patterns of migration to Greece, mainly from Albania.&lt;ref&gt;Altanis, Panagiotis, and Jim Goddard. "Street children in contemporary Greece."

'''Human trafficking in Georgia''' is common, where people are subjected to [[forced prostitution]] and [[unfree labour|forced labor]]. In 2009, women and girls from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] were forced into prostitution in Georgia, [[Turkey]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[Greece]]. In recent years, cases of forced prostitution of Georgian victims were also documented in [[Russia]], [[Germany]], and [[Austria]]. Men and women have been forced into labor in Georgia, [[Libya]] and Turkey. Men from Turkey are also forced into labor in the breakaway region of [[Abkhazia]], which is outside the Georgian government’s control.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The government of Georgia fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. The government demonstrated strong efforts to identify and assist victims of trafficking and again increased its victim assistance funding to $312,000. The government also demonstrated impressive law enforcement success, significantly increasing the number of individuals convicted of trafficking, and again ensuring all convicted trafficking offenders served some time in prison. The Georgian government also demonstrated strong prevention efforts and continued its close partnership with anti-trafficking [[NGO]]s in both victim assistance and prevention efforts.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Georgia". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142760.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 1"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Youth trafficking and sex work ==
[[File:Trafficking of women, children and men.png|thumb|300px|A schematic showing global human trafficking, with specific focus to women and children. Georgia is labelled on the map as being the trafficking origin for a 'high number of people'.]]
[[Street children]] in Georgia, are particularly susceptible to exploitation through means of trafficking. Whether it be through begging or theft by third parties, including their parents, this subcategory of the population is considered to be at risk.&lt;ref name=State&gt;{{cite web|last=Government|title=State Gov|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2012/192367.htm|publisher=Government|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children working in agriculture and in the informal urban economy are especially vulnerable to forced labor.&lt;ref name=State /&gt;

Trafficking of children is a large concern within this area. Thousands of children living in the streets and in [[orphanages]] are trafficked annually.&lt;ref name=State /&gt; Some families experiencing economic hardship have been forced to separate, which has directly increased the number of children living on the streets in Georgia.&lt;ref name=State /&gt; This is a direct result of familial stress on the children, which often leads to youth feeling responsible to take on means of supporting the family in hard times, by then bringing in money through illegal means.&lt;ref name=State /&gt;

As a large portion of children, who are susceptible to be drawn into the realm of trafficking, are first noted as high-risk youth and street children, it is relevant to note that statistic that [[UNICEF]] estimated that 28.8 percent of children ages 5 to 14 years in Georgia were working in 1999.&lt;ref name=State /&gt; While the majority of working children work in family businesses, and in agriculture in rural areas, there are reports of significant numbers of children, some as young as 5 years old, engaged in begging or working on the streets.&lt;ref name=State /&gt;  Children as young as 9 years old are found working in markets, sometimes at night, and involved in carrying or loading wares.&lt;ref name=State /&gt; Children also work in cafes, bistros, gas stations, and for street photographers. The relevance of these statistics annotate the sense that a majority of these working children are out in the community, as opposed to working within the safer confines of their homes. Having to go outside the home to work within the community at a young age plays a role in the risk of being a youth in this area. According to the [[UN]] Committee on the Rights of the Child, police violence against street children is a problem.&lt;ref name=State /&gt;  In general, there is a lack of social safety services for children living on the street, with [[disabilities]] or from dysfunctional households.&lt;ref name=State /&gt;

Children, especially young girls are commonly trafficked for the purposes of [[Commercial sexual exploitation of children]], particularly for prostitution and [[pornography]].&lt;ref name=State /&gt; In 2003, the statistical bureau of the Supreme Court reported 24 registered cases of the use of children in the [[Illegal drug trade|drug trade]] and trafficking.&lt;ref name=State /&gt; This burden can then lead to negative impacts the female as they mature on both their sexual health, as well as concerns about their mental stability.&lt;ref name=State /&gt;

The government of Georgia fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking where children are involved.&lt;ref name=Labor&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Bureau of International Labor |url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2004/georgia.htm |publisher=United States |accessdate=1 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017050457/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2004/georgia.htm |archivedate=17 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the year, however, local experts expressed serious concerns about the government’s view of its trafficking problem and its lack of effective efforts in the first half of the reporting period to proactively identify victims of this serious crime.&lt;ref name=Labor /&gt; In the duration of the reporting period, the government increased the number of trafficking cases investigated and the percentage of prosecutions that resulted in convictions of trafficking offenders.&lt;ref name=Labor /&gt; The government also significantly increased funding for anti-trafficking training and trafficking prevention activities, including in the budgets of its shelters for victims.&lt;ref name=Labor /&gt; The government significantly increased the number of Georgian officials provided training on victim identification.&lt;ref name=Labor /&gt;

==Prosecution==
The Government of Georgia demonstrated increased law enforcement efforts during the reporting period. Georgia prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons through Article 143 of its criminal code, which prescribes penalties ranging from seven to 20 years’ imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and are commensurate with those for other serious crimes, such as rape. In 2009, the government investigated 33 trafficking cases, compared with 14 investigations in 2008. Authorities prosecuted 40 individuals for trafficking – including three individuals for forced labor – compared with 10 individuals prosecuted for sex trafficking in 2008.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

Thirty-seven trafficking offenders were convicted in 2009, a significant increase from 10 convicted offenders in 2008. All 37 convicted trafficking offenders were sentenced to time in prison; none received a suspended sentence. The average sentence was 21 years’ imprisonment. There were no reports of trafficking-related complicity of law enforcement personnel from either NGOs or the government. In 2009, the government relied on partnerships with local NGOs and international organizations to provide trafficking training to approximately 170 prosecutors and judges. The training concentrated on mechanisms for proactive victim identification, special methods for investigation and the collection of evidence, and prosecution techniques, and highlighted the importance of partnerships with NGOs, social workers, and psychologists during victim interviews.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The Georgian government maintained its significant victim assistance efforts over the reporting period. The government allocated a total of $312,000 for victim assistance during the reporting period; of that, it provided $150,000 to fully fund two government-run trafficking shelters, the same amount as funded in 2008. These shelters provided comprehensive victim assistance, including medical aid, psychological counseling, and legal assistance. Victim assistance was not conditional upon cooperating with law enforcement. The government continued to implement a formal mechanism for its officials to identify and refer victims for assistance. The government identified 48 victims in 2009 and referred 15 victims for assistance, an increase from 21 trafficking victims identified in 2008. The government provided shelter and comprehensive assistance to 15 victims, compared with 10 victims in 2008. The government also made available one-time compensation payments of $650 to trafficking victims in 2009. However, no victims applied for the funds during the reporting period. Five victims were given $600 each in 2008. Georgian authorities provided foreign victims legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they would face hardship or retribution; the Law on Legal Status of Foreigners provided a foreign person suspected of being a victim of trafficking the right to a residence permit even if authorities could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person was a victim. In 2009, no foreign victims requested a residence permit. The government cooperated with IOM and fully funded the repatriation of one foreign victim during the reporting period. Victims were encouraged to assist law enforcement with trafficking investigations and prosecutions; 18 victims assisted law enforcement during the reporting period. There were no reports that victims were penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The Government of Georgia sustained its efforts to prevent trafficking during the reporting period. The government produced and broadcast during the first six months of 2009 a short television public service announcement explaining the nature and danger of human trafficking. The Ministry of Education and Science produced a short television announcement targeting school-age children entitled “Do Not Trade Freedom for Slavery,” which was regularly aired on television.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The [[Georgia (country)|Government of Georgia]] improved its anti-trafficking prevention activities in 2011 and significantly increased cooperation with NGOs to conduct prevention campaigns.&lt;ref name=Labor /&gt; The government began enacting legislation in December 2011. They did this by authorizing the [[executive branch]] for the first time to make grants to NGOs.&lt;ref name=Labor /&gt; Pursuant to this legislation, the government provided small grants to two NGOs in early 2012 to work on projects related to public awareness of trafficking and information pertaining to victim identification.&lt;ref name=Labor /&gt; It also entered into memoranda of understanding with leading NGOs to expand and coordinate cooperation in addressing trafficking.&lt;ref name=Labor /&gt;

During the year the government conducted multiple information campaigns utilizing a broad array of media, including [[public service announcements]], seminars, and television broadcasts throughout the country.&lt;ref name=Labor /&gt; The Civil Registry Agency continued its practice of distributing over 20,000 anti-trafficking related pamphlets when it issued new passports to citizens.&lt;ref name=Labor /&gt; The government also conducted numerous outreach events including some focused on specific high risk segments of the population, such as university and high schools students, internally displaced persons, and ethnic minorities living in the regions, would were more likely to be recognized as high-risk groups.&lt;ref name=Labor /&gt; Events included numerous panel discussions, a film screening, a peer education campaign, and an essay contest, all which provided research as well as preventative ideas regarding human trafficking in the country.&lt;ref name=Labor /&gt;  The government distributed 10,000 donor-funded trafficking indicator cards to front-line responders, including [[law enforcement]] and border officials.&lt;ref name=Labor /&gt; In coordination with NGOs, the government posted anti-trafficking posters on cross-border buses and distributed [[multilingual]] leaflets to cross-border truck drivers and others.&lt;ref name=Labor /&gt; In November 2011, authorities created a high-level, steering committee to oversee the implementation of an [[European Union|EU]]-funded project to address street children.&lt;ref name=Labor /&gt;  In March 2011, the government approved its new anti-trafficking National Action Plan for 2011-2012, produced with extensive collaboration with the NGO community.&lt;ref name=Labor /&gt; Because their focus was on human and child trafficking specifically, during the reporting period, the government did not initiate any campaigns to reduce demand for commercial sex acts.&lt;ref name=Labor /&gt;

'''Ignacio Ramos''' is a former [[United States Border Patrol]] Agent, who was convicted of shooting an  unarmed [[Alien (law)|illegal alien]] and [[drug smuggler]] on the [[United States–Mexico border]]. He was convicted of causing serious bodily injury, assault with a deadly weapon, discharge of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, and a civil rights violation.&lt;ref name="Seper"&gt;{{cite news | last = Seper | first = Jerry | title = Lawmakers seek review of border agent case | publisher = [[The Washington Times]] | date = 2006-08-23 | url = http://washingtontimes.com/national/20060823-122228-3575r.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 19, 2009, his sentence was commuted by President Bush and he was released on February 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kfoxtv.com/news/18730957/detail.html Breaking News: Former El Paso Border Patrol Agents Released From Prison]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Border incident and prosecution==
Ramos was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to 11 years and one day in prison for shooting a then unknown Mexican National in the buttocks, [[Osvaldo Aldrete Dávila]], who was caught with over 800&amp;nbsp;lbs. of drugs, following his non-compliance near [[Fabens]], an unincorporated town in [[El Paso County, Texas|El Paso County]], [[Texas]], while Dávila ran away at about 1 PM on February 17, 2006. Fellow agent [[Jose Compean]] was sentenced to 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gilot | first = Louis | title = Sentence handed to border agents; free until Jan. 17 | publisher = [[El Paso Times]] | date = 2006-10-20 | url = http://www.dailybulletin.com/news/ci_4519632 | accessdate = 2006-12-14 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061102190758/http://dailybulletin.com/news/ci_4519632 | archivedate = 2006-11-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to U.S. attorney [[Johnny Sutton]], after the shooting the officers disposed of their shell casings, made no further attempt to apprehend the suspect, lied to their supervisors, and filed a false investigative report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/txw/press_releases/2007/compean_ramos_suttonstatement_1_17_07.pdf] Statement of US Attorney Johnny Sutton Regarding the Prosecution of Border Patrol Agents Compean and Ramos&lt;/ref&gt;  Aldrete Dávila had been found with nearly 800 pounds of [[marijuana]] in the back of his [[van]]. Following the incident, Aldrete Dávila was granted a temporary conditional visitor's visa in exchange for giving his testimony against Ramos and Compean. Ramos and his partner were incarcerated January 17, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Carter

===Homeland Security and Justice Department involvement===
Congressmen [[Ted Poe]] and [[John Culberson]] indicated that the [[Department of Homeland Security]] lied to them about the case when it indicated that it had evidence that the agents "plotted and conspired that day to go out and shoot" Mexicans. [[Richard Skinner(DHS)|Richard Skinner]], Inspector General of DHS, apologized to the congressmen for misleading them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0702/08/ldt.01.html CNN Transcript from 2/8/2006] accessed 2/19/2006&lt;/ref&gt;

According to writer [[Jerome Corsi]], the prosecution was initiated at the behest of the Mexican government. Some commentators have questioned Corsi's conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/09/04/ramos_compean/index1.html The Case of Ramos and Compean]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===
Aldrete Dávila has filed a $5 million [[lawsuit]] against the U.S. government, claiming that his [[civil rights]] were violated.&lt;ref name="Seper"/&gt;

A petition for the pardon of the border agents received nearly 240,000 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Meritz | first = Darren | title =Vigil supports convicted ex-border agents | work = [[El Paso Times]] | date = 2007-01-14 | url = http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_5011117 | accessdate = 2007-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 18, 2007, [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]] agreed to review the case, and [[Duncan Hunter|Representative Duncan Hunter]] introduced a bill, titled the Ramos and Compean Act, that would pardon the two agents, though the [[United States Constitution]] does not grant Congress the authority to issue pardons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Carter | first = Sara A. | title = Bush will review border agents' court case | work = Inland Valley Daily Bulletin | publisher = [[Los Angeles Newspaper Group]] | date = 2007-01-19 | url = http://www.dailybulletin.com/news/ci_5042815 | accessdate = 2007-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 February 2007 Representative [[Tom Tancredo]] and Ramos' relatives reported to the [[Associated Press]] that Ramos had been beaten by fellow inmates in prison. His wife Mrs. Monica Ramos told the AP that he had "let his guard down" and been stomped and kicked for several minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alicia |last=Caldwell |title=Ex-Border Agent Said Beaten in Prison |publisher=Associated Press |date=2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 23, 2007 the border patrol union released a no-confidence resolution against Chief David V. Aguilar for his failure to back up Ramos during the case.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,267920,00.html Border Patrol Union Votes No Confidence in Agency Chief&lt;/ref&gt; The union had also made a rebuttal responding to United States Attorney Sutton's reasons why convicting the agents was justified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rohrabacher.house.gov/UploadedFiles/NBPC%20rebuttal_to_sutton.pdf Rebuttal to Sutton]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate Judiciary Committee examined the prosecution in July 2007 after which Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] asked President Bush to commute the sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brendan|last=McKenna|title=Clemency sought for agents who shot smuggler|url=|publisher=Dallas Morning News|date=2008-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal appeal==
On September 25, 2007 a legal appeal concerning the conviction of Ramos and Compean was filed with the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] in New Orleans and in December 2007, the case was heard. Judge E. Grady Jolly stated, "It does seem to me that the government overreacted here,... If the agents had reported the shooting as required, "this prosecution never would have occurred, in all likelihood." For over the next 6-months nothing more was reported. Then, on July 28, 2008, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the appeals of both Ramos and Compean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/06/06-51489-CR0.wpd.pdf U.S. Court of Appeals 5th District docket 06-51489]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commutation===
On 19 January 2009, President Bush commuted the sentences of both Ramos and Compean, effectively ending their prison term on March 20, 2009.&lt;ref name=startrib&gt;Riechmann, Deb. [http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/president/37826749.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUUZ "Bush commutes prison sentences of 2 former US border agents"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123050756/http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/president/37826749.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O%3ADW3ckUiD3aPc%3A_Yyc%3AaUUZ |date=2009-01-23 }}, Associated Press, January 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The commutation was condemned by Mexico's Deputy Secretary for Foreign Relations Carlos Rico.&lt;ref name=startrib /&gt;

==Petition for pardon==
Although Bush commuted the two men's sentences, he did not grant them a full pardon, thus leaving Compean and Ramos with criminal records that made it hard for them to find jobs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-hunter-pardon-20170927-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lattitude Global Volunteering''' (formerly '''GAP Activity Projects''') is an international charity established in [[Reading, Berkshire]], in 1972 to provide 17- to 25-year-olds with support to travel outside of their own [[community]], in most cases to other countries, where they will spend several months assisting with care or educational projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lattitude.org.uk/about-us/40-years-of-volunteering/ |title=40 years of Volunteering |accessdate=27 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Lattitude co-ordinated activities for their 40,000th [[Volunteering|volunteer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yearoutgroup.org/news-events/press-releases/q/date/2012/05/22/lattitude-global-volunteering-announces-40-000th-volunteer-during-40th-anniversary-year/ |title=Lattitude Global Volunteering Announces 40,000th Volunteer During 40th Anniversary Year |work=Year Out Group |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=27 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group is also credited with helping to coin the term "[[gap year]]" from its original name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.butler.edu/media/608115/history%20of%20gap%20year.doc |title=History of Gap Year |work=Butler University |date=17 March 2010 |accessdate=27 May 2012 |first=J.S. |last=Chrade }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally known as GAP Activity Projects, the [[not-for-profit organisation]] was founded in 1972 with the mission of creating safe and worthwhile volunteer work for school leavers before moving onto university.

The group was officially recognised as a [[Charitable organization|charity]] in 1976 as they continued to expand the number volunteer opportunities around the world.

In 2000 the organisation co-founded the Year Out Group to promote the benefits of well-structured year out programmes.

2001 saw the opening of three new offices in Australia, New Zealand and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lattitude.org.uk/about-us/40-years-of-volunteering/ |title=40 years of Volunteering |accessdate=27 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 the organisation was placing 1,500 volunteers per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/bridging-the-gap-1601918.html |title=Bridging the Gap |work=The Independent|date=20 September 1995 |accessdate=27 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005 that number had grown to 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/aug/14/tsunami2004.gapyears |title=Tsunami effect lifts gap teens |work=The Guardian |date=14 August 2005 |accessdate=27 May 2012 |first=Martin |last=Bentham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebrand===
Despite coining the term "[[gap year]]" from its name, GAP Activity Projects relaunched in 2008 as Lattitude Global Volunteering. Lattitude state that this is to reflect that the organisation is focused on international volunteering projects for young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lattitude.org.uk/about-us/40-years-of-volunteering/ |title=40 years of Volunteering |accessdate=27 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change came less than one year after the clothing retailer [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]] had taken a gap year company named "Gap Sports" to court over trademark infringement. At the time, a member of the Year Out Group mentioned that Gap Sports was not the only member to have faced a challenge from Gap Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/738041/Gap-branding-dispute-settled.html |title='Gap' branding dispute settled |work=The Telegraph |date=18 August 2007 |accessdate=27 May 2012 |first=Louisa |last=McLennan}}&lt;/ref&gt;". Whether or not the name change around this time is coincidental is unknown.

==Volunteering==
Volunteers may select from a number of educational, social or environmental placements throughout the world.

Volunteers are required to pay a fee to cover the [[expenses]] of the charity as well arranging and paying for their own transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/dont-mind-the-gap--just-seriously-enjoy-it-1166423.html |title=Don't mind the gap - just seriously enjoy it |work=The Independent |date=21 June 1998 |accessdate=27 May 2012 |first=Serena |last=Kutchinsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce the likelihood of cost being a barrier to entry, a range of scholarships providing financial support are available along with on fundraising advice and [[grants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theherald.com.au/news/features/articles/careers/lattitude-has-right-attitude/2557052.aspx |title=Lattitude has right attitude |work=Newcastle Herald |accessdate=27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once at their placement, volunteers will have their food and accommodation provided. In most instances a portion of the fee is returned to the volunteer over the course of the stay as an allowance. Placements last between 3 and 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lattitude.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/LGV-UK-Brochure-2010.pdf |title=Lattitude 2010 Brochure |work=Lattitude Global Volunteering |year=2010 |accessdate=27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Liberation''''' ({{Lang-no|'''Frigjøring'''}}) is a 1974 painting by the Norwegian artist [[Odd Nerdrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artprice.com/marketplace/1214457/odd-nerdrum/painting/liberation|title=Odd Nerdrum – Liberation|work=Artprice.com|accessdate=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts a room with a mattress where a couple have sexual intercourse with the [[woman on top]] of the passive man.

Nerdrum's art from the period 1968–1983 is characterized by everyday [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and left-wing politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Blom|first1=Hege|last2=Reisegg|first2=Øyvind|url=https://snl.no/Odd%20Nerdrum|title=Odd Nerdrum|language=Norwegian|work=[[Store norske leksikon]]|accessdate=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Liberation'' was created in this context, where the radical left propounded a [[sexual revolution]] as a way to create a [[socialism|socialist]] utopia by politicizing every aspect of human life, especially sexuality. Nerdrum made several paintings on the topic of what was considered sexual liberation. The most famous of these are ''Liberation'' from 1974 and ''Spring'' (''Vår'') from 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ebbestad Hansen|first=Jan-Erik|year=1996|title=Fenomenet Nerdrum|language=Norwegian|location=Oslo|publisher=[[Gyldendal Norsk Forlag]]|page=83|isbn=82-05-24492-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The painting was first presented at [[Høstutstillingen]] in 1974. It was exhibited at the Oslo gallery Kunstnerforbundet in 1976 as part of the exhibition Odd Nerdrum Malerier ("Odd Nerdrum Paintings").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blomqvist.no/Kunsthandel/Moderne-contemporary-og-eldre-kunst/Nerdrum-Odd-Frigjoering-1974|title=Nerdrum, Odd - Frigjøring 1974|language=Norwegian|publisher=Blomqvist Kunsthandel|accessdate=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Evstafiev-lipovane-slava-cherkeza.jpg|thumb|Lipovans (Russian Old Believers) during a ceremony in front of their church in the Romanian village of [[Slava Cercheză]] in 2004 (photo by [[Mikhail Evstafiev]].)]]
'''Lipovans''' or '''Lippovans''' ({{lang-ru|Липовáне}}, {{lang-ro|Lipoveni}}, {{lang-uk|Липовани}}, {{lang-bg|липованци}}) are [[Old Believers]], mostly of [[Russian people|Russian]] ethnic origin, who settled in [[Romania]] in the [[Moldavia|Moldavian Principality]], and in the regions of [[Dobruja]] and Eastern [[Muntenia]]. According to the Romanian census of 2002, there are a total of 35,791 Lipovans in [[Romania]], of whom 21,623 live in Dobruja.

==Name==

The accepted{{by whom?|date=February 2018}} etymology is that it is derived from the name of [[Nikita Pustosvyat]] (1672–1742), leader of the group of [[dissenters]] who emigrated to what is now Romania; its members were referred to as ''Filippoveni'', abbreviated to ''Lipoveni''.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Vascenco, [http://www.unibuc.ro/uploads_en/29527/20/Romanoslavica_XLII.pdf "Melchisedec şi lipovenii"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824134827/http://www.unibuc.ro/uploads_en/29527/20/Romanoslavica_XLII.pdf |date=2009-08-24 }}{{dubious|date=February 2018}}, ''Romanoslavica'' (University of Bucharest), XLII, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Other suggestions include relations to the Slavic word Липа, ''lipa'', meaning [[Tilia|"linden tree"]], or to "Filippovka", a holiday name dedicated to [[Philip the Apostle|Saint Philip]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==History==

The Lipovans emigrated from Russia in the 18th century, as [[dissenters]] from the main [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. They settled along the [[Prut River]] in [[Moldavia]] and in the [[Danube Delta]]. They have maintained strong religious traditions which predate the reforms of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] undertaken during the rule of [[Patriarch Nikon]]. When the Patriarch [[Old_Believers#Specific_Differences_between_Traditional_Russian_and_New_Practices|made changes]] to worship in 1652, some believers carried on worshipping in the "old way". In that sense, they continued to speak [[Old Russian]], to [[sign of the cross|cross]] themselves with two fingers instead of three, and to keep their beards. The Russian government and the Orthodox Church persecuted them, and as a result some committed suicide [[Self-immolation|by burning themselves]] (self-burning: ''soshigateli''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Loren |last=Coleman |title=The Copycat Effect: How the Media and Popular Culture Trigger the Mayhem in Tomorrow's Headlines |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3B4lTTZE58oC&amp;pg=PA46 |location=New York |publisher=Paraview Pocket-Simon and Schuster |year=2004 |page=46 |isbn=0-7434-8223-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many others being forced to emigrate.

In 1876, the Lipovans were joined by members of the [[Skoptsy]] sect, who also emigrated to Romania to escape persecution.

Lipovans were considered to be [[Schism|schismatic]] by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], although relations have improved recently. (See main article on [[Old Believers]].)

==Population==
[[File:Lipovean.jpg|thumb|Lipovan fisherman in the Danube Delta]]
[[File:Вилкове.jpg|thumb|Lipovans in [[Vylkove]], Ukraine]]
The main centre of Lipovan community in Ukraine is the town of [[Vylkove]], which has its own church, [[St Nicholas Church (Vilkovo)|St Nicholas]]. In order to construct their homes, the Lipovans create islets of dry land by digging mud out from trenches and making a series of canals. The house walls are made of [[Phragmites|reed]] and mud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.independent.co.uk/europe/article226573.ece |work=The Independent |location=London |title=Water world |date=2005-06-18 |accessdate=2010-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210939/http://travel.independent.co.uk/europe/article226573.ece |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kented.org.uk/ngfl/subjects/geography/rivers/Feature%20Articles/danube.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504152834/http://www.kented.org.uk/ngfl/subjects/geography/rivers/Feature%2BArticles/danube.htm |archivedate=2006-05-04 |title=The Danube |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[thatched roof|thatching]] is standard for the roofing. Because of the characteristics of these materials, the buildings have a tendency to sink into the mud and need to be rebuilt every few years.

The population is popularly known as having [[red hair]].&lt;ref&gt;http://icc-online.arte-ct.ro/vol_01/10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6362">'''Marital debt''' (commonly referred as '''conjugal debt''') is a [[spouse]]'s sexual commitment to one another. The concept stems from descriptions found in [[canon law]] of [[medieval Europe]].

==History==
During the later medieval period (10th to 15th centuries), a new scholastic way thinking allowed the Church to solidify doctrine, leading to the formation of ecclesiastical law. This new wave of thinking stemmed from the revival and codification of some Roman laws. Particular works from [[Irnerius|Irneius]] and his students in 1112 and 1125 in particular, reconstructed some laws of [[Justinian's Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The History of Medieval Canon Law in the Classical Period, 1140-1234 From Gratian to the Decretals of Pope Gregory IX|last = Hoeflich|first = Michael|publisher = The Catholic University of America Press|year = 2008|isbn = 9780813214917|location = Washington D.C.|pages = 13|editor-last = Hartmann|editor-first = Wilfried|work = The Establishment of Normative Legal Texts: The Beginnings of the Ius commune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on laws allowed scholars to debate the issues like marriage as a [[sacrament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women and Gender in Medieval Europe: An Encyclopedia|last = Schaus|first = Margaret|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|year = 2006|isbn = 9780415969444|location = |pages = 164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Catechism of the Catholic Church - IntraText|url = http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P50.HTM|website = www.vatican.va|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical references to marriage, like that found in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7&amp;version=NIV 1 Corinthians 7] alludes to it as a preventative measure for "sexual immorality." Scholars like [[Decretum Gratiani|Gratian of Bologna]] were quick to posit their theories on marriage. His 12th century work, ''Decretum Gratiani,'' became an early text example for other canon law studies and it is here where the earliest account for marital debt is found. In it, he writes that marriage arose from wishing to prevent further sin through fornication. Gratian is also quick to point out four main reasons people may have for getting married: that is for offspring, to pay the debt, or the obligation of sex, for incontinence, or to satisfy lust and for the sake of pleasure.

A pattern of reciprocal sexual obligation then emerged. Spousal consent, from interpretations on marital debt, allowed spouses to more easily influence the lives of their other spouse. They lived in communal bond, a sexual bond known as a "conjugal domicile".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Handbook of Women and Gender in Medieval Europe|last = Bennett|first = Judith|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-19-958217-4|location = Oxford|pages = 163–178;70|last2 = Karras|first2 = Ruth|work = Women and Gender In Canon Law|editor-last = McDougall|editor-first = Sara}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable example of the strength of this bond, was when a husband wished to leave his marriage for a monastic life but he remains in a sexual debt to his wife. He, therefore, could only leave for the monastery if his wife consents to his departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Medieval Masculinities: Regarding Men in the Middle Ages|last = Lees|first = Clare|publisher = U of Minnesota Press|year = 1994|isbn = 9780816624263|location = Minneapolis|pages = 61–72|last2 = Fenster|first2 = Thelma|last3 = McNamara|first3 = Jo Ann|work = Burdens of Matrimony: Husbanding and Gender in Medieval Italy|editor-last = Stuard|editor-first = Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

[[Ecclesiastical court]]s were increasingly becoming a venue for couples to resolve marital disputes in the 11th and 12th centuries. It thus became important for the church to further consolidate and solidify canon law, so the courts could resolve the numerous cases. These increasingly strict canon laws made it much more difficult to get divorced or have a marriage annulled. One way to get a marriage annulment was if one spouse was impotent, in other words, if they could not fulfill the marital debt. In these cases, the healthy spouse could [[remarriage|remarry]] while the impotent one could not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Law, Sex, and Christian Society in Medieval Europe|last = Brundage|first = James|publisher = The University of Chicago Press|year = 1987|isbn = 0226077837|location = Chicago|pages = 202}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was some disagreement amongst the clergy about cases where a person was capable of fulfilling the conjugal debt, but was sterile and could not procreate. In these cases, some thought that you needed to be able to procreate to maintain the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Law, Sex, and Christian Society in Medieval Europe|last = Brundage|first = James|publisher = The University of Chicago Press|year = 1987|isbn = 0226077837|location = Chicago|pages = 456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conjugal debt also had implications in terms of [[gender equality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Equally in God's Image|last = Holloway|first = Julia|publisher = Peter Lang Publishing, Inc|year = 1990|isbn = 9780820415178|location = New York|pages = 129–43|last2 = Wright|first2 = Constance|work = The Conjugal Debt and Medieval Canon Law|editor-last = Makowski|editor-first = Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a woman had just as much right as a man to demand the debt. The conjugal debt "took precedence over most other duties." Even in the case where a lord had called a man to rally. If his wife had insisted on the debt, "the wife's rights took precedence over the lord's."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Law, Sex, and Christian Society in Medieval Europe|last = Brundage|first = James|publisher = The University of Chicago Press|year = 1987|isbn = 0226077837|location = Chicago|pages = 359}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar situation applied for crusading. If a man wanted to go on crusade he needed permission from his wife, because "his departure would deprive her of the sexual solace that he owed to her."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Law, Sex, and Christian Society in Medieval Europe|last = Brundage|first = James|publisher = The University of Chicago Press|year = 1987|isbn = 0226077837|location = Chicago|pages = 283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
A '''namtar''' ({{bo|t=རྣམ་ཐར་|w=rNam-thar}}), sometimes spelled '''namthar''' is a spiritual biography or [[hagiography]] in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

''Namtar'' is a contraction of ''nampar tharpa'' ({{bo|t=རྣམ་པར་ཐར་པ་|w=rnam-par thar-pa}}), which literally means 'complete liberation'.&lt;ref name=Willis/&gt; This name refers to the fact that the texts tell stories of [[yogis]] or [[Indo-Tibetan]] [[Mahasiddha]] who attained complete enlightenment. Namtars do not focus on a literal chronology of events, but rather function as a kind of learning example that hits the key points of the yogi's sprititual life. Such a text would serve as an example of [[buddhahood]] for any practitioner of [[Vajrayana]] and complement the ''tantras'' in imparting instructions on specific [[tantra|tantric]] spiritual practices. According to Janice D. Willis, the focus on spiritual practice forms an essential difference between Christian and Tibetan hagiography.&lt;ref name=Willis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dowman/&gt;
In her book ''Women of Wisdom'', [[Tsultrim Allione]] voices it thus: &lt;blockquote&gt;The sacred biography is called 'rNam.thar' in Tibetan, which literally means 'complete liberation.' The 'rNam.thar' are specially geared to provide records for those on a spiritual quest, in much the same way that someone about to climb a high mountain would seek out the chronicles of those who had made the climb before. The sacred biographer is primarily concerned with providing information which will be helpful and inspirational for someone following in the footsteps of the spiritual adept or 'saint.' Establishing a mythical ideal and the communication of the sacred teachings takes precedence over providing a narrative portrait or "likeness" of the subject as a personality. The personality is stressed only in so far as it relates to the spiritual process of the individual.&lt;ref name=Allione/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Western academic tradition often portrays this type of text in an unfavourable light. It mainly criticizes the Tibetan hagiography for its inclusion of miraculous events and repetition of the protagonist's sanctity. Some scholars have therefore proposed that the ''Namtar'' has no historical value whatsoever.&lt;ref name=Snellgrove/&gt;

==Traditional division==
All Tibetan ''Namtar'' consist of three parts:&lt;ref name=Willispart/&gt;
*The outer biography ({{bo|t=ཕྱིའི་རྣམ་ཐར་|w=phyi'i rnam-thar}}), containing descriptions of birth, education and consulted texts.
*The inner biography ({{bo|t=ནང་གི་རྣམ་ཐར་|w=nan-gi rnam-thar}}), containing details on meditative cycles and initiations.
*The secret biography ({{bo|t=གསང་བའི་རྣམ་ཐར་|w=gsan-ba'i rnam-thar}}), said to describe the meditative state of the ''siddha''.

Mainly the third of these levels has caused western scholars to criticize this form of literature.&lt;ref name=Willispart/&gt;&lt;ref name=Snellgrove/&gt; Willis however defends their historical value by arguing that the miraculous parts of the secret biography may be interpreted as a metaphor for tantric practice.&lt;ref name=Willis315/&gt;

'''Paul Schäfer Schneider''' (4 December 1921 – 24 April 2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.es/20100424/internacional-iberoamerica/chile-201004241544.html|title=Muere en una prisión de Chile el nazi Paul Schaefer, fundador de Colonia Dignidad|date=24 April 2010|publisher=ABC.es|language=Spanish|accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the founder and former leader of a [[sect]] and [[agricultural commune]] of [[Germany|German]] immigrants called Colonia Dignidad (''Dignity Colony'')—later renamed [[Villa Baviera]]—located in the south of [[Chile]], about {{Convert|340|km|abbr=in}} south of [[Santiago]]. 

== Life and career ==
Schäfer was born in [[Troisdorf]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], and joined the [[Hitler Youth]] movement at a young age. He served as a [[medic]] in the [[Wehrmacht]] during [[World War II]], where he reached the rank of [[Unteroffizier|Corporal]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8641882.stm|title=Chile cult leader Schaefer dies in Chile prison|date=24 April 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the war, he set up a children's home and [[Baptists|Baptist]] ministry. In 1959, he created the Private Social Mission, purportedly a charitable organization. That same year, he was charged with sexually abusing two children and fled [[West Germany]] with some of his followers.
&lt;!--It appears that Schäfer was Lutheran, not Baptist.  http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article601324.ece--&gt;

Schäfer followed the teachings of American preacher, [[William M. Branham]], one of the founders of the post-World War II [[Healing Revival|healing revival]] who was also an influence on [[Jim Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=67352 Colonia Dignidad and Jonestown] by John Collins, Alternative Considerations of Jonestown &amp; Peoples Temple, San Diego State University&lt;/ref&gt; Branham advocated "a strict adherence to the Bible, a woman's duty to obey her husband and apocalyptic visions, such as [[Los Angeles]] sinking beneath the ocean." &lt;ref name="Reuters&amp;nbsp;—German sect victims seek escape from Chilean nightmare past"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-chile-sect-idUSBRE8480MN20120509|title=Insight: German sect victims seek escape from Chilean nightmare past|date=9 May 2012|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schäfer resurfaced in Chile in 1961, where the government at the time, led by [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[President of Chile|President]] [[Jorge Alessandri]], granted him permission to create the Dignidad Beneficent Society on a farm outside of [[Parral, Chile|Parral]]. Founded primarily on [[Baptists|Baptist]] principles and [[anti-communism]], this society evolved into the ''Colonia Dignidad'' community.

Schäfer disappeared on 20 May 1997, fleeing child [[sexual abuse|sex abuse]] charges, this time filed by Chilean authorities under [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Democrat Party (Chile)|Democrat]] President [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]] after 26 children who went to the commune's free clinic and school reported abuse.

Following two days of negotiations between Chilean and Argentine authorities, Schäfer was sent back to Chile to face a court hearing. There, he was charged with being involved in the 1976 disappearance of the political [[Activism|activist]] [[Juan Maino]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=New charges for Chile cult head |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4370607.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=22 March 2005 |accessdate=20 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he remained in custody until his death. Schäfer was also under investigation in Chile in connection with the disappearance of [[Russians|Russian]] [[mathematician]] [[Boris Weisfeiler]]&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; and alleged [[human rights]] abuses. He was also wanted in [[Germany]] and [[France]] in connection with earlier child abuse allegations. Investigations by [[Amnesty International]] and the Chilean [[Rettig Report|National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation Report]] have verified that Colonia Dignidad was used by [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]], the Chilean [[secret police]], as a [[torture]] and [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]] center during [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|military dictatorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/aljazeeracorrespondent/2013/10/tales-torture-2013103081121394171.html| title=Tales of torture A former member of Chile's national intelligence agency describes some of the methods used against political prisoners |date=15 December 2013 |publisher=[[AlJazeera]]| accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/aljazeeracorrespondent/2013/11/colony-chile-dark-past-uncovered-2013114105429774517.html| title=The Colony: Chile's dark past uncovered| date=15 December 2013 |publisher=AlJazeera| accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 May 2006, Schäfer was sentenced to 33 years in jail for sexually abusing 25 children and was ordered to pay 770 million [[Chilean peso|pesos]] (approximately US$1.5 million) to 11 minors whose representatives established suits. Schäfer was found guilty of 20 counts of dishonest abuses and five counts of child [[rape]], all committed between 1993 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Chilean colony sex abuser jailed |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5014608.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=24 May 2006 |accessdate=20 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 24 April 2010, Schäfer died&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8641882.stm | work=BBC News | title=Chile cult leader Schaefer dies | date=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Santiago de Chile's Ex-Penitentiary's Hospital due to a heart failure. He was 88 years old. It was later revealed that he was suffering from a severe cardiac illness.

The '''Pebco Three''' were three black South African anti-[[apartheid]] activists who were abducted and subsequently murdered in 1985 by members of the [[South African Bureau of State Security|South African Security Police]].

==History of PEBCO==
After an increase in the cost of living for the Black population in Port Elizabeth – following a 100% rent-fee price hike in the late 1970s – the residents of Port Elizabeth decided to organise themselves and form an organisation that would challenge socio-economic injustices that were meted out on Black people including the apartheid regime. On the 10 October 1979, after having officially established the Port Elizabeth Black Civic Organisation (PEBCO), a public meeting was held where it was decided that a protest against the increase in rent, transport, fuel and lighting, township services charges and food costs be held.&lt;ref&gt;Msila, V. (2014) ''A Place to Live: Red Location and its history from 1903 to 2013''. SUN PRESS&lt;/ref&gt; PEBCO's immediate aims and demands were: to fight for equal rights for all people of Port Elizabeth; to fight all discriminatory legislation enacted by the government and local authorities; to seek participation in decision making on all matters affecting the people of South Africa; to fight for the granting of the right to Blacks to buy land under freehold title at any place of their choice; and to resist any attempt, direct or indirect, to deprive Blacks of their South African citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Houston, G.F. (1999) ''The National Liberation Struggle in South Africa: A Case Study of the United Democratic Front 1983-1987''. Aldershot:Ashgate&lt;/ref&gt; Their fundamental aim included the creation of one municipality for the whole of Port Elizabeth, therefore rejecting the system of community councils and separate municipalities for Blacks and Whites.&lt;ref&gt;Msila, V. (2014) ''A Place to Live: Red Location and its history from 1903 to 2013''. SUN PRESS&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Disappearance==
The 1980s proved to be a volatile period for activism in Port Elizabeth and as such, leaders of PEBCO were detained for short stints from time to time. In 1980, five of its leaders were detained, including [[Thozamile Botha]], the founding member, who in the previous year – 1979 – was dismissed at the Ford Company in [[New Brighton, Eastern Cape|New Brighton]] for his political involvement and organising workers on site. He soon left the country in May 1980 to join the ANC in exile, leaving his comrade Qaqawuli Godolozi as PEBCO's new president. Five years later, on 8 May 1985, three members – Sipho Hashe, Champion Galela, and Qaqawuli Godolozi – disappeared from the airport in [[Port Elizabeth]], [[South Africa]]. This was due to the fact that PEBCO had now affiliated itself with the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] (UDF), which was believed by some at the time to be an internal wing of the then-banned [[African National Congress]] (ANC). As a result of the three's disappearance, the Consumer Boycott Committee organised a huge consumer boycott which began in July 1985. Although it was strongly suspected that the Security Police had something to do with the three activists' disappearance, nothing was known of their fate of until November 1997.

==The Confession==
On 11 November, former Security Police Officer Colonel Gideon Nieuwoudt,&lt;ref&gt;News24 | https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Nieuwoudt-charged-for-Pebco-3-20040211&lt;/ref&gt; while applying for amnesty during a Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearing, confessed to participating in the beating, robbery, and murder of the PEBCO Three. According to his testimony, Nieuwoudt lured the three men by having a paid police informant pose as a British embassy official interested in providing a cash donation to PEBCO call Sipho Hashe at his home. The informant convinced Sipho and his two friends to come to the airport to pick up the donation. (Nieuwoudt later refused to name the informant for fear of his safety.) The three men were apprehended by members of the Security Police and taken to an abandoned police station on a farm at Post Chalmers, near Cradock. They were then interrogated, stripped of their possessions, beaten, sedated, and finally strangled. The bodies were burned and the remains were thrown into the nearby [[Great Fish River|Fish River]]. Eugene de Kock a former head of section C1 at the [[Vlakplaas]] farm north of [[Pretoria]] where many of these atrocities occurred – in his submission to the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC) about the death of the PEBCO Three – admits to this and writes that in late 1985 there began an altercation between two members of his Vlakplaas team, sergeant Joe Mamasela and warrant officer Gert Beeslaar who had been involved in an operation in Port Elizabeth in which the PEBCO Three were murdered.&lt;ref&gt;Msila, V. (2014) A Place to Live: Red Location and its history from 1903 to 2013. SUN PRESS&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Court Case==
Also incriminated in the case were former policemen Johan Martin Van Zyl and Johannes Koole. Van Zyl voluntarily surrendered to police in Port Elizabeth on 11 February 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Justice | https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/pebco-three-bodies-may-have-been-found-362244&lt;/ref&gt; He had been out of the country on a murder and three counts of assault to do grievous bodily harm. The trial was set for 12 October, but has since been postponed by the defence, pending a[[Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] review of the 1989 Motherwell Bombing in which Nieuwoudt was also involved. The TRC refused to grant amnesty to the three perpetrators Van Zyl, Nieuwoudt and Lotz, citing that the three had failed to make a full disclosure in the case of the PEBCO Three.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Justice | https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/pebco-three-bodies-may-have-been-found-362244&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7320">The '''Pennsylvania LGBT Equality Caucus''' is an organization of sitting members of the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] who are in favor of equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Pennsylvanians. It was formed on December 19, 2011, with Representatives [[Dan Frankel]] and [[Babette Josephs]] serving as the first co-chairs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/harrisburg_politics/Never-in-Pennsylvania-Not-so-Legislature-forms-LGBT-Equality-caucus.html|title = Never in Pennsylvania? Not so. Legislature forms LGBT Equality caucus...|date = December 19, 2011|publisher = Philly.com|author = Angela Couloumbis}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is open to all sexual orientations and gender identities.

Ironically, unlike other LGBT-focused caucuses in other state or federal legislatures which are formed around openly LGBT sitting legislators (i.e., the [[LGBT Equality Caucus]] in the U.S. Congress), the Pennsylvania was formed without any openly LGBT sitting legislators, as none had yet been elected to political positions at the time of its formation.

The caucus now has two out members. They are Rep. Brian Sims (D – 182) and Rep. Mike Fleck (R – 81). Sims became the first openly gay man to be elected to the General Assembly in November 2012; Mike Fleck, an incumbent, came out after the election.

==Members==
As of May 2013, 58 members of [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] are members of the Pennsylvania LGBT Equality Caucus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equalitypa.org/pdfs/Caucus%20Roll-Out%20Poll%20Release.pdf Equality Pennsylvania lauds growth of LGBT Equality Caucus and releases new poll]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Japan}}
While [[Japan]]'s political mainstream has the [[Democratic Party of Japan|DPJ]] and the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]] as dominant forces, there is '''[[political extremism]]''' to the left and the right.

Neither [[Left-wing extremism|left-]] nor [[right-wing extremism|right-wing extremist]]s managed to wrest power from the LDP in post-war history, but they managed to influence public opinion on certain topics. These include [[Sino-Japanese relations]], the role of the military, and national symbolism. On some topics, like the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], all three elements play a role.

The public and the government appear to tolerate certain forms of public disorder as inherent to a properly functioning [[democracy]]. [[Demonstration (people)|Demonstrations]] usually follow established forms. Groups receive legal permits and keep to assigned routes and areas. Placards and [[bullhorn]]s are used to express positions. Traffic is sometimes disrupted, and occasional shoving battles between police and protesters results. But [[arrest]]s are rare and are generally made only in cases involving violence.

Although members of extremist groups represent only a minute portion of the population and present no serious threat to the government, authorities are concerned about the example set by the groups' violence, as well as by particular violent events. Violent protests by radicals also occur in the name of fringe causes without meaningful public support. Occasional clashes between leftist factions and rightist factions have injured participants.

==New Left==
According to the 1989 [[Asahi Nenkan]], there were 14,400 activist members of the "extreme left wing" organized into five major "currents" (ryū) and twenty-seven or twenty-eight different factions. Total membership was about 35,000. New-left activity focused on the [[Narita International Airport|New Tokyo International Airport]] at Narita-Sanrizuka. In the early 1970s, radical groups and normally [[conservatism|conservative]] farmers formed a highly unusual alliance to oppose expropriation of the latter's land for the airport's construction. Confrontations at the construction site, which pitted thousands of farmers and radicals against riot police, were violent but generally nonlethal. Although the airport was completed and began operations during the 1980s, the resistance continued, on a reduced scale. Radicals attempted to halt planned expansion of the airport by staging [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] attacks on those directly or indirectly involved in promoting the plan. By 1990 this activity had resulted in some deaths. There were also attacks against places associated with the [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]]. In January 1990, leftists fired homemade rockets at imperial residences in [[Tokyo]] and [[Kyoto]].

==Japanese Red Army==
In terms of [[terrorism|terrorist]] activities, the most important new-left group was the [[Japanese Red Army]] (Nihon Sekigun). Formed in 1969, it was responsible for, among other acts, the [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]] of a domestic [[Japan Airlines]] jet to [[Pyongyang]] in 1970 and the 1972 [[Lod Airport massacre]]. It also participated in the [[Laju incident]], an attack on a [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] oil refinery in [[Singapore]] in 1974, and seized the [[France|French]] [[embassy]] in [[The Hague]] that same year and the [[United States]] and [[Sweden|Swedish]] embassies in [[Kuala Lumpur]] in 1975.
In 1977 the Japanese Red Army hijacked a Japan Airlines jet over [[India]] in a successful demand for a US$6 million [[ransom]] and the release of six inmates in Japanese prisons.

Its activists developed close connections with international terrorist groups, including [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian]] liberation movements like the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]]. The Japanese Red Army also had close ties with the [[Kim Il Sung]] regime in [[North Korea]]. The group was tightly organized, and one scholar has suggested that its "managerial style" resembled that of major Japanese corporations{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}.

Following heavy criticism at home and abroad for the government's "caving in" to terrorists' demands{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}, the authorities announced their intention to recall and reissue approximately 5.6 million valid Japanese [[passport]]s to make hijacking more difficult. A special police unit was formed to keep track of the terrorist group, and tight [[airport security]] measures were instigated. Despite issuing regular threats, the Japanese Red Army was relatively inactive in the 1980s. In 1990 its members were reported to be in North Korea and [[Lebanon]] undergoing further training and were available as mercenaries to promote various political causes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

[[Fusako Shigenobu]], the founder and leader, was arrested in [[Osaka]], Japan in November 2000.

Right-wing extremists were extremely diverse. In 1989 there were 800 such groups with about 120,000 members altogether. By police count, however, only about fifty groups and 23,000 individuals were considered active. Right-wing extremists indulged in a heady romanticism with strong links to the prewar period. They tended to be fascinated with the macho charisma of blood, sweat, and steel, and they promoted (like many nonradical groups) traditional [[bushido|samurai values]] as the antidote to the spiritual ills of postwar Japan. Their preference for violent direct action rather than words reflected the example of the [[Japanese militarism|militarist]] extremists of the 1930s and the heroic "men of strong will" of the late [[Tokugawa period]] of the 1850s and 1860s. The modern right-wing extremists demanded an end to the postwar "system of dependence" on the [[United States]], restoration of the emperor to his prewar, divine status, and repudiation of [[Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan|Article 9]]. Many, if not most, right-wingers had intimate connections with Japan's gangster underground, the [[yakuza]].  Japanese right-wing extremists ([[Uyoku dantai]]) are notable for their use of black [[bus]]es, which often carry [[loudspeaker]]s broadcasting nationalistic slogans.

The ritual [[suicide]] of one of Japan's most prominent novelists, [[Mishima Yukio]], following a failed attempt to initiate a rebellion among [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self-Defense Forces]] units in November 1970, shocked and fascinated the public. Mishima and his small private army, the Shield Society ([[Tatenokai]]), hoped that a rising of the Self-Defense Forces would inspire a nationwide affirmation of the old values and put an end to the postwar "age of languid peace."

Although a rightist were also responsible for the [[assassination]] of socialist leader [[Asanuma Inejiro]] in 1960 and an attempt on the life of former prime minister [[Ohira Masayoshi]] in 1978, most of them, unlike their prewar counterparts, largely kept to noisy street [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], especially harassment campaigns aimed at conventions of the leftist [[Japan Teachers Union]]. In the early 1990s, however, there was evidence that a "new right" was becoming more violent. In May 1987, a reporter working for the liberal [[Asahi Shimbun]] was killed by a gunman belonging to the [[Sekihotai]] (Blood Revenge Corps). The Sekihotai also threatened to assassinate former Prime Minister [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]] for giving in to foreign pressure on such issues as the revision of textbook accounts of Japan's war record. In January 1990, a member of the [[Seikijuku]] (translatable as the (Sane Thinkers) School) shot and seriously wounded [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] mayor [[Motoshima Hitoshi]]. The attack may have been provoked by the mayor's critical remarks concerning Emperor [[Hirohito]].

That attack came two days after the left-wing [[Chukakuha]] (Middle Core Faction), opposed to the imperial system, claimed responsibility for firing a rocket onto the grounds of the residence of the late emperor's brother and a day before the government announced the events leading to the enthronement of Emperor [[Akihito]] in November 1990. The enthronement ceremonies were considered likely targets for extremist groups on the left and the right who saw the mysticism surrounding the emperor as being overemphasized or excessively reduced respectively, but no serious incidents took place.

More recently, the [[Zaitokukai]] have been focusing their attention on [[anti-Korean]] demonstrations.

'''Posting''' or '''postadh''' ([[Scottish Gaelic]]) is a [[archaism|term formerly used]] in Scotland for a process in [[laundry|washing clothes]]. It means to trample with the feet, or the act of trampling or treading. In scouring woollen clothing, blankets or coarse linen, when the strength of the arms and manual friction are found insufficient, [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] women put them in a [[wikt:tub|tub]] with a prop – or quantity of water, then, with [[petticoat]]s tucked up, they began to "post", which they continued until every part of the clothes received an effectual cleansing. When three women were employed, one usually tramped in the middle, and the other two tramped around her. Treading cloth with the feet, a time-consuming and laborious practice, has long been superseded by mechanical methods, starting in the [[Industrial Revolution]].

There is some overlap with the process of [[textile manufacture|making cloth]], in that both involve textiles immersed in water. The processing of woollen cloth,  known in English as [[fulling]] or tucking, was "waulking" in Scots, hence the [[waulking song]]s that the [[occupational segregation|women sang as they worked]].

The legality of '''prostitution in Europe''' varies by country.

Some countries outlaw the act of engaging in sexual activity in exchange for money, while others allow [[prostitution]] itself, but not most forms of [[procuring (prostitution)|procuring]] (such as operating [[brothel]]s, facilitating the prostitution of another, deriving financial gain from the prostitution of another, soliciting/loitering)....

In eight European countries (The Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, Hungary, and Latvia), prostitution is [[regulated prostitution|legal and regulated]].

The degree of enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws vary by country, by region and by city. In many places, there is a big discrepancy between the laws which exist on the books and what happens in practice.

Depending on the country, various prostitution related activities may be prohibited (where a specific law forbids such activity), decriminalized (where there is no specific law either forbidding or allowing and regulating the activity), or regulated (where a specific law explicitly allows and regulates the activity if certain conditions are met). Activities which are subject to the prostitution laws include: selling and buying sexual services, soliciting in public places, running brothels, deriving financial gain from the prostitution of another, offering premises to be used for prostitution etc. Often, the prostitution laws are not clear-cut, and are subject to interpretation, leading to many legal [[loophole]]s. While the policy regarding adult prostitution differs by country, [[child prostitution]] is illegal throughout Europe. Similarly, [[human trafficking]], forced prostitution, and other abusive activities are also prohibited.

[[Image:RedLightDistrictAmsterdam.jpg|thumb|Right|300px|The red light district ''[[De Wallen]]'' in [[Amsterdam]]]]
[[File:Prostitute statue.JPG|thumb|150px|The monument to prostitutes in Amsterdam]]

The legal and social treatment of prostitution differs widely by country. Very [[Permissive society|permissive]] prostitution policies exist in the Netherlands and Germany, and these countries are major destinations for international [[sex tourism]]. [[Amsterdam]]'s prostitution windows are famous all over the world. In Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Northern Ireland, France, and the Republic of Ireland, it is illegal to pay for sex, but not to be a prostitute (the client commits a crime, but not the prostitute).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordic Model|url=http://humanrightslawyers.eu/human-trafficking/nordic-model/|website=Human Rights Lawyers|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of [[Central and Eastern Europe]], the anti-prostitution laws target the prostitutes, because in these countries, prostitution is condemned from a moral or conservative viewpoint. Other countries which have restrictive prostitution policies and officially affirm an anti-prostitution stance are Great Britain and Italy. In countries such as Spain, Belgium, and the Czech Republic, attitudes are more ''[[laissez-faire]]'' and tolerant, but prostitution is not officially recognized as a job, and not officially and legally regulated, and pimping is forbidden.

Under the law, prostitutes are professionals who engage in sexual activities in exchange for money. The government allows this activity as long as they pay taxes and keep legal documents.

In 2007, the prostitution and [[pornography]] industry in Hungary was estimated by Hungary's tax authority APEH to generate $1 billion annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gorondi|first1=Pablo|title=Hungary Gives Permits to Prostitutes|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/24/AR2007092400842.html|website=Washington Post|accessdate=17 December 2017|date=24 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kazakhstan]] prostitution itself is legal, but acts facilitating prostitution, such as operating a [[brothel]] or prostitution ring, are illegal. Forced prostitution and prostitution connected to organized crime are prohibited.

Prostitution is the only profession in Poland that is not taxed, but sex workers may be asked by authorities to prove that is what they do, since prostitution is not recognized as legitimate work, and therefore receive no social benefits.

Prostitution in [[Romania]] is not itself criminalized, although associated activities, such as [[Procuring (prostitution)|procuring]], are criminal offenses, and [[solicitation]] is a contravention punishable by fines.

Solicitation is an administrative offence (''contravenție'') punishable by a fine of 500–1500 [[Romanian leu|lei]] (approximately 110–330 [[euro]]s as of 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romania|url=http://swannet.org/en/countries/romania|website=SWAN|accessdate=24 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Police, Local Police and Gendarmes are all responsible for enforcing the laws, although there are reports that law enforcement is corrupt and that police are often violent.&lt;ref name="spl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Work Law - Countries|url=http://spl.ids.ac.uk/sexworklaw/countries|website=Sexuality, Poverty and Law|accessdate=24 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Clients are not prosecuted, unless they knowingly use the services of a victim of [[forced prostitution]],&lt;ref&gt;https://legeaz.net/noul-cod-penal/art-216&lt;/ref&gt; or the prostitute is a minor (Art. 216''1'').&lt;ref&gt;https://legeaz.net/noul-cod-penal/art-216&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 213&lt;ref&gt;https://legeaz.net/noul-cod-penal/art-213&lt;/ref&gt; criminalizes procuring; it states that "The causing or facilitation of the practice of prostitution or the obtaining of financial benefits from the practice of prostitution by one or more individuals shall be punishable by no less than 2 and no more than 7 years of imprisonment and a ban on the exercise of certain rights." In certain aggravated circumstances, the punishment increases. The penal code also criminalizes several offenses against [[slavery]], [[human trafficking]], [[child trafficking]], [[forced labour]], and using [[Exploitation of labour|exploited persons]] (Art. 182 ''Exploitation of a person'', Art. 209 ''Slavery'', Art. 210 ''Trafficking in human beings'', Art. 211 ''Trafficking in underage persons'', Art. 212 ''Pressing into forced or compulsory labor'', Art. 216 ''Use of an exploited person’s services'').&lt;ref name="legeaz.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legeaz.net/noul-cod-penal/|title=Noul Cod Penal actualizat 2017 - Legea 286/2009|website=legeaz.net|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Denmark]], prostitution was partly decriminalized in 1999, based partly on the premise that it was easier to police a legal trade than an illegal one.

In June 2006, [[Eduskunta|parliament]] voted by 158 to 15 with four abstentions to approve a bill which outlaws the buying of sexual services from prostitutes if it is linked to human trafficking. According to a recent [[TAMPEP]] study, 69% of prostitutes are foreigners.

The Sex Purchase Act (''Sexköpslagen''), which makes it illegal to pay for sex, but not to be a prostitute, was adopted in 1999, and was then unique. Since then, similar laws have been passed in [[Norway]] and [[Iceland]].

The rationale underpinning the law was the view that prostitution was a form of [[violence against women]] so the crime consists in the customer paying for sex, not in the prostitute selling sexual services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Michel |url=http://sisyphe.org/spip.php?article1424 |title=Sweden Treating Prostitution as Violence Against Women |publisher=Sisyphe.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 'rationale' sees the seller of sex as the exploited partner in the exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/3926/a/47455 |title=Chapter 6 of the Swedish Penal Code 1962:700 |publisher=Sweden.gov.se |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain]], prostitution itself is legal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7736436.stm | work=BBC News | title=Q&amp;A: UK Prostitution Laws | date=2008-11-19 | accessdate=2010-05-22 | first=Dominic | last=Casciani}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a number of related activities, including soliciting in a public place, [[Kerb crawler|kerb crawling]], keeping a brothel, [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimping]], and [[Procuring (prostitution)|pandering]], are outlawed.

The [[Policing and Crime Act 2009]] makes it illegal to pay for sex with a prostitute who has been "subjected to force", and this is a ''strict liability offence'' (clients can be prosecuted even if they didn't know the prostitute was forced).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2009/ukpga_20090026_en_4#pt2-pb1-l1g14 |title=Policing and Crime Act 2009 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nodo50.org/Laura_Agustin/unworkable-ways-to-stop-trafficking-uk-law-on-exploitation-and-gain |title=Policing and Crime &amp;#124; UK &amp;#124; Anti-trafficking &amp;#124; Exploitation &amp;#124; Sex Industry &amp;#124; The Naked Anthropologist |publisher=Nodo50.org |date=2010-04-06 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Northern Ireland]], which previously had similar laws to the rest of the United Kingdom, paying for sex became a crime when the Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Criminal Justice and Support for Victims) Act (Northern Ireland) 2015 was enacted in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-30805990|title = Human Trafficking Bill receives Royal Assent|last = |first = |date = 14 January 2015|work = BBC News|access-date = 27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in the early 1990s, prostitution in Albania was virtually unknown. The migration from rural areas to the cities, and economic problems that followed the collapse caused some women to turn to prostitution.&lt;ref name="swan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Work in Albania – an Overview|url=http://swannet.org/node/1041|website=SWAN|accessdate=14 February 2018|language=en|date=1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyprus has gained a reputation for being a major transit point for people smugglers to transport women for the purposes of prostitution. International observers have criticized the government for its lack of action to prevent forced prostitution. The law of Cyprus forbids forced (but not voluntary) prostitution.

In [[Italy]], prostitution, defined as the exchange of sexual acts for money, is legal, although organized prostitution, whether indoors in brothels or controlled by third parties, is prohibited. Brothels were banned in 1958. Single sex workers working from apartments are "tolerated". Loitering is permitted, but soliciting ("unabashedly inviting clients on the street") is illegal. Migrants with work or residence permits may work in sex work, and police cannot revoke residence permits and begin deportation procedures, as they tried failing by the Italian laws.

A 2008 report stated that were some 100,000 prostitutes in Italy.&lt;ref name="itmag091008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italymag.co.uk/italy/crime/government-set-approve-anti-prostitution-bill |title=Government set to approve anti-prostitution bill |website=Italy Magazine |date=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Prostitution in Spain}}

Prostitution itself is legal in Spain, but [[pimping]] is not. Owning an establishment where prostitution takes place is legal if the owner neither derives financial gain from prostitution nor ''hires'' any person for the purposes of selling sex, because prostitution is not considered a job, and has no legal recognition. Most places do not regulate prostitution, but the government of Catalonia offers licenses for persons "to gather people to practice prostitution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/6-23-2006-100298.asp |title=Europe's Brothel - in a Corner of Spain |publisher=Buzzle.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
These licenses are used by brothel owners to open 'clubs', where prostitution takes place (the women are theoretically only 'gathered' to work on the premises not employed by the owner). Some places have implemented [[fine (penalty)|fines]] for street prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_23597.shtml |title=Granada brings in hefty fines for street prostitution |publisher=Typicallyspanish.com |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/es/news/local_news/Seville-to-follow-Catalan-lead-with-bid-to-regulate-prostitution.html |title=Seville to follow Catalan lead with bid to regulate prostitution |publisher=Expatica.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Prostitution in Turkey}}

In Turkey, prostitution is legal and regulated. Prostitutes must register and acquire an ID card stating the dates of their health checks. Also, it is mandatory for registered prostitutes to have regular health checks for sexually transmitted diseases. The police are allowed to check the authenticity of registered prostitutes to determine whether they have been examined properly and to ensure they see the health authorities if they don't. Men cannot register under this regulation. Most sex workers, however, are unregistered, as local governments have made it policy not to issue new registrations. As a result, most sex workers in Turkey are not registered sex workers, working in violation of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2002/18396.htm|title=Turkey: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|author=|date=31 March 2003|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/06/26/news/turkey.php |title=Turkey's sex trade entraps Slavic women |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=27 June 2005 |author=Craig S.

Prostitution in [[France]] (the exchange of sexual acts for money) was legal until April 2016, but several surrounding activities were illegal, like operating a brothel, living off the avails (pimping), and paying for sex with someone under the age of 18 (the [[age of consent]] for sex is 15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25802279|title=Franck Ribery and Karim Benzema on trial over prostitute|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April 2016, the French National Assembly voted to punish customers of prostitutes by a fine of €1500.&lt;ref name="law16"&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2016/04/06/prostitution-le-parlement-adopte-definitivement-la-penalisation-des-clients_4897216_3224.html Prostitution : le Parlement adopte définitivement la pénalisation des clients] 'Le Monde', accessed 7 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The law has been evaluated as a failure, putting sex workers in danger, reducing prices, and decreasing condom use among their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2018/04/18/2782371-prostitution-moins-de-clients-plus-de-risques.html|title=Less clients, more risk|website=La Depeche}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Napoleonic era]], France became the model for the regulatory approach to prostitution. In the 20th century, however, a policy shift became apparent. Brothels became illegal in 1946, and France signed the [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]] in 1960. France thus became a major supporter of the international abolitionist movement for the eradication of prostitution.

[[File:Prostata Prostitute.jpg|thumb|left|Scene from [[Amsterdam]]'s red light district.]]

Prostitution is legal and regulated in the Netherlands. Operating a brothel is also legal. In the last few years, a significant number of brothels and "windows" have been closed because of suspected [[criminal activity]]. [[De Wallen]], the largest and best-known red-light district in Amsterdam, is a destination for international sex tourism.

Prostitution  is concentrated in and around the big cities and in the border towns in the regions of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Twente]], [[North Brabant|West Brabant]] and [[Zeeland]]. Prostitution occurs in various forms: 'window' and street prostitution, clubs, escort agencies and home-based prostitution. 'Window' prostitution occurs in 12 cities in the Netherlands. It is estimated that on average some 2,000 prostitutes are engaged daily in this form of prostitution. Street prostitution exists in 10 Dutch cities and involves on average some 320 prostitutes daily. Between 3,500 and 4,000 prostitutes are employed daily in 600–700 clubs and private brothels. The extent of other forms of prostitution such as escort agencies and home-based prostitution is much more difficult to estimate. Home-based prostitution occurs in at least 17 municipalities and escort agencies exist in at least 28 municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/faq-prostitution-netherlands |title=FAQ – Prostitution in the Netherlands &amp;#124; Radio Netherlands Worldwide |publisher=Rnw.nl |accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigerians are one of the most misunderstood people in Africa, [[Stereotypes of Africans|by both other Africans]] and non-Africans. There are some stereotypes typically associated with Nigerians and these are both positive and negative. Apart from the general stereotypes, there are peculiar stereotypes concerning the ethnic groups in Nigeria that even other Nigerians believe and propagate.

== Positive stereotypes ==

=== Open mindedness ===
It is generally believed that Nigerians are open-minded and quick to try new things.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalstereotype.com/nigerian-stereotypes/|title=Nigerian Stereotypes|work=National Stereotypes|access-date=2017-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hardworking ===
Nigerians are generally regarded as hard-working people who are willing to go the extra mile for success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Proud and happy ===
Nigerians are regarded as a very proud people. They also feature as one of the happiest people on earth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thetab.com/us/brown/2016/02/08/americans-dont-know-nigeria-1976|title=I'm sick of the stereotypes Americans have about Nigeria|date=2016-02-08|work=The Tab Brown|access-date=2017-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negative stereotypes ==

=== Nigerians are into advance fee fraud ===
This stereotype is mainly a product of the many Nigerian prince 419 scams which were popular. Many people believe that a large percent of Nigerians are into internet scam and fraud. While it is true that some youths take to it, the stereotype is essentially misplaced as the number of youths partaking in this is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://buzznigeria.com/nigerians/#|title=10 Stereotypes of Nigerians that aren’t Always True|last=Partners|first=Alexander Moore|date=2014-07-17|work=Nigeria News Online &amp; Breaking News {{!}} BuzzNigeria.com|access-date=2017-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most internet scammers simply prefer to use Nigeria and Nigerian identities in their schemes.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

=== Nigerians are poor ===
This stereotype stems from the general perception that Africans are poor and in need of charity. It is important to note that Nigerians have some of the richest people in the world. [[Aliko Dangote]], a Nigerian, is the richest black man alive. The percentage of poor Nigerians is not as high as this stereotype portrays it.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

=== Nigerians are uneducated ===
This is one of the negative stereotypes about Nigerians. It is generally believed by most non-Nigerians that Nigerians are not well educated and cannot speak English.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is a myth as Nigerians have one of the highest literacy rates in Africa and English is the official language in Nigeria due to its multi-ethnic status.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3027">The '''Yem''' are an ethnic group living in south-western [[Ethiopia]]. They are also called by their neighbors as the '''Janjero''', but the Yem consider this [[exonym]] derogatory, since it sounds similar to the [[Amharic language|Amharic]] word "ጃን ጆሮ" which means "[[baboon|spy of the king]]". Their native language is [[Yemsa language|Yemsa]], one of the [[Omotic languages]], although many also speak [[Oromo language|Oromiffa]] or Amharic. The neighbors for Yem include the [[Gurage]], [[Hadya]] and Kembata to the east across the [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Omo River]] and the Jimma [[Oromo people|Oromo]] to the south, north and west.

==History==
The first reference to Yem as a political unit is found, under the name of Jangero, in the victory song of King Yesaq (1412-1427) of the Christian kingdom of Ethiopia, as paying tribute in the form of horses to the king.&lt;ref&gt;G.W.B. Huntingford, ''The historical geography of Ethiopia from the first century AD to 1704'', (Oxford University Press: 1989), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The first European traveler to mention Yem was the European traveler Father Fernandez, who travelled through their homeland in 1614.&lt;ref&gt;[[Balthazar Tellez]], ''The Travels of the Jesuits in Ethiopia'', 1710 (LaVergue: Kessinger, 2010), p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
Their number was not definitely known until recently, as Aklilu Yilma states, "Bender gives the estimate as '1000' (Bender 1976: 4), whereas the ''Ethnologue'' reports the figure of '1000-4000' speakers of Yemsa (Grimes 1992:257). The report of the [[Central Statistical Agency (Ethiopia)|Central Statistical Office]] gives the 1984 census figures of the Yem people as 34,951 (Central Statistical Office 1991:61), but this census seems to comprise only the [[Fofa, Ethiopia|Fofa]] area."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.org/silesr/abstract.asp?ref=2002-052 Aklilu Yilma, "Pilot Survey of Bilingualism in Yem"] SILESR 2002-052, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The 1994 national census reported 60,811 people identified themselves as Yem in the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region]] (SNNPR), of whom 59,581 lived in the around Fofa, and 52,292 speakers of the Yemsa language in the SNNPR, of whom 51,264 were living in the same area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa.gov.et/surveys/Population%20and%20Housing%20Census%201994/survey0/data/docs%5Creport%5CStatistical_Report%5Ck07%5Ck07_partI.pdf ''1994 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia: Results for Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region'', Vol. 1, part 1], Tables 2.11, 2.13 (accessed 30 December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The more recent 2007 national census reports that 160,447 were identified as Yem, of whom 84,607 lived in the [[Oromia Region]] and 74,906 in the SNNPR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa.gov.et/pdf/Cen2007_firstdraft.pdf "Census 2007"], first draft, Table 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
