[[Image:H1N1 Japan Map.svg|thumb|right|H1N1 in Japan {{legend|#FF0000|Confirmed cases}}{{legend|#000000|Deaths with confirmed infections}}]]

The '''2009 Japan flu pandemic''' was an outbreak of the [[H1N1]] and the [[Influenza A]] viruses across Japan. The World Health Organisation raised the pandemic alert for influenza to level 4 in April 2009 following a worldwide outbreak of the H1N1 influenza strain. The first Japanese infections of H1N1 and Influenza A were both recorded early in May 2009. In August 2009, the government estimated that the virus strains had infected about 760,000 people. At the height of the pandemic in October 2009, it was estimated that 20% of the Japanese population had been infected and that there were on average more than 20 infected people in each Japanese medical facility. By the end of 2009 the virus had killed 42 people. Japan put several measures in place to attempt to control the spread of infection including quarantining air travellers entering Japan who were suspected of having the virus and closing schools in areas of Japan with high numbers of infection. The pandemic ended in August 2010 when the World Health Organisation announced that worldwide influenza infection number were back to the seasonal average before the outbreak occurred.

==Government reaction==
In April, Japan's [[Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan)|Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries]] instructed animal quarantine offices across the country to examine any live pigs being brought into the country to double-check for infection by the [[H1N1]] strain of influenza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.kyodo.co.jp/modules/fstStory/index.php?storyid=435522 |title=Japan on high alert for swine flu after an outbreak in Mexico |publisher=[[Kyodo News]] |date=2009-04-26 |accessdate=2009-04-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429203043/http://home.kyodo.co.jp/modules/fstStory/index.php?storyid=435522 |archivedate=April 29, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese Agriculture Minister [[Shigeru Ishiba]] appeared on TV to reassure consumers regarding the safety of pork.&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;[http://english.cna.com.tw/SearchNews/doDetail.aspx?id=200904280012 MOFA issues red travel alert for Mexico on swine flu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429235551/http://english.cna.com.tw/SearchNews/doDetail.aspx?id=200904280012 |date=April 29, 2009 }}.

'''Adventures For The Cure''' ('''AFC''') is a [[non-profit organization]] and [[USA Cycling]] club that exists to raise awareness for [[diabetes]] and other selected charities. Formed in 2005, AFC is based in [[Halethorpe, Maryland]] near [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]].

== History and mission ==
According to the organization's website, it was formed by two [[University of Maryland Baltimore County]] (UMBC) classmates, Adam Driscoll (Type 1 diabetic and AFC co-founder) and Patrick Blair (AFC co-founder), to show those diagnosed with diabetes and their families how leading a healthy and active lifestyle can move you beyond your perceived limits, and to raise funds for diabetes research.

The organization also raises awareness and funds for other causes that the board of directors has selected. In the past AFC has raised funds for the following organizations:

* [[American Diabetes Association]]
* [[Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation]]
* [[Kupenda for the Children]] - focused on children disabilities in Kenya
* [http://www.bloodwatermission.com/ Blood:Water Mission] - focused on HIV/AIDS and water crises in Africa
* [http://www.pscpartners.org/ Partners Seeking a Cure] - focused on [[Primary sclerosing cholangitis|Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis]]

== Documentary film ==
In 2006, AFC developed a documentary film, '''''Adventures for the Cure: The Doc''''', narrated by 3-time Tour de France winner [[Greg LeMond]], which chronicled a 6,500-mile trek across the United States on [[Fixed-gear bicycle|fixed-gear, single speed bicycles]] by Adam Driscoll, Patrick Blair, Jesse Stump and their support crew. The film, directed and edited by Philip Knowlton, founder of [https://web.archive.org/web/20090328201546/http://www.videe-os.com/ videe-o's], was awarded the ''People's Choice Award'' at the 2008 [[Beloit International Film Festival]] and was an ''Official Selection'' at the 2008 [[Bicycle Film Festival]].  The documentary is popular amongst avid cyclists and has been shown at events such as the [[Tour of Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.velonews.com/article/81298/new-film-on-single-speed-trans-continental-ride-to-be-shown New film on single-speed transcontinental ride to be shown at the Tour of Missouri&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competitive racing ==

In addition to regional road, mountain bike, and cross country racing, AFC members compete in ultra-endurance events. In 2008, AFC competed in the 4-man division (again using fixed gears) in [[Race Across America]] (RAAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.velonews.com/article/77026 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711201347/http://www.velonews.com/article/77026 |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }} Fixed gear team to take on RAAM&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Adam Driscoll and Pat Blair captured first place in the 2-man division of [[Race Across America]] by completing the 3021 mile event in 7 days, 1 hour and 33 minutes; averaging 17.82&amp;nbsp;mph over the journey.

{{native name|no|'''Altevatnet'''|nbsp=no}} or {{native name|se|'''Álddesjávri'''|nbsp=no}} is [[Norway]]’s [[List of lakes in Norway|11th largest lake]].  The {{convert|79.71|km2|adj=on}} lake lies in the [[Bardu Municipality]] in [[Troms]] county, Norway.  The lake is the largest lake in the county.  It is approximately {{convert|38|km}} long and about {{convert|2.5|km}} wide.  The [[lake]] is regulated by a [[dam]] on the northwestern end of the lake. The surface lies {{convert|489|m}} above sea level and reaches a maximum depth of {{convert|99|m}} below the surface of the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nve.no/no/vann-og-vassdrag/lengste-dypeste-storste-/de-storste-innsjoene-i-norge/|title=De største innsjøene i Norge|language=Norwegian|publisher=Norges vassdrags- og energidirektorat|date=2009-04-01|accessdate=2012-09-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525111359/http://www.nve.no/no/Vann-og-vassdrag/Lengste-dypeste-storste-/De-storste-innsjoene-i-Norge/|archivedate=2012-05-25|df=|trans-title="The largest lakes in Norway"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lake lies about {{convert|10|km}} from [[Sweden]] and it is located right between the two national parks: [[Øvre Dividal National Park]] and [[Rohkunborri National Park]].

'''Athol Whimp''' (1961–2012) was a New Zealand [[mountaineer]], [[rock climber]] and soldier. Widely regarded as the most accomplished alpinist in New Zealand's modern era, he is the country's only recipient of the prestigious [[Piolet d'Or]] award for mountaineering.&lt;ref name="Climber"&gt;[https://archive.is/20131024233821/http://climber.co.nz/79/news/athol-whimp-1961-2012 "Athol Whimp (1961 – 2012)"], ''The Climber'', #79, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a successful military career in the [[New Zealand Special Air Service]] and a stint as an advisor with a desert reconnaissance unit in [[Oman]]&lt;!-- of the [[Oman Reconnaissance Force]] --&gt;,&lt;ref name="Climber" /&gt; Whimp began climbing extensively in New Zealand, Australia and the Himalaya.&lt;ref&gt;https://alpineclub.org.nz/product/aoraki-mount-cook/&lt;/ref&gt;
During this period, he and Australian climber Andrew Lindblade made a number of difficult ascents culminating in their 1998 alpine-style ascent of the North Face of [[Thalay Sagar]].&lt;ref name="Climber" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.climbing.com/news/the-17th-edition-of-the-piolets-d-or/&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to his hard alpine ascents, Whimp was also an accomplished rock climber, having climbed up to grade 5.13c in the [[Yosemite decimal system]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockandice.com/lates-news/a-year-ago-athol&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 February 2012, Whimp died after slipping into an 800-meter fall&lt;ref name="Climber" /&gt; while traversing non-technical terrain in [[Fiordland National Park|the Darran Mountains]].&lt;ref name="Climber" /&gt;

'''BookDoc''' is a mobile application that connects patients with medical care professionals. In 2015 it became the first healthcare online platform in [[Malaysia]] that provides such services.&lt;ref name=Maldigesteffective&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lakshinny|title=Medical Appointments Going Online - How Effective Is It?|url=http://www.malaysiandigest.com/news/573548-medical-appointments-going-online-how-effective-is-it.html|accessdate=2 November 2015|publisher=Malaysian Digest|date=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BloombergCOrporate&gt;{{cite news|title=BookDoc Signs Deal With 5 Corporates|url=http://bookdoc.com/2015/10/16/bloomberg-bookdoc-signs-deal-with-5-corporates-founder/|accessdate=2 November 2015|publisher=Bloomberg|date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
BookDoc was founded in July 2015 by former BP Healthcare Group managing director Datuk Chevy Beh, and co-founded by [[Groupon|Groupon Malaysia]] founder [[Joel Neoh Eu-Jin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mobile health app BookDoc launched in Malaysia|url=http://enterpriseinnovation.net/article/mobile-health-app-bookdoc-launched-malaysia-848082692|accessdate=2 November 2015|publisher=Healthcare Innovation|date=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MInsiderMobile&gt;{{cite news|title=Healthcare start-up launches book-a-doctor app|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/healthcare-start-up-launches-book-a-doctor-app|accessdate=2 November 2015|publisher=The Malaysian Insider|date=30 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103085518/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/healthcare-start-up-launches-book-a-doctor-app|archivedate=3 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The app was inspired after a friend of Beh's had a near-death experience. His friend came down with [[dengue fever]].&lt;ref name=MInsiderMobile/&gt; After initially not being diagnosed with such, he was sent home. Three days later his condition worsened and he went to the hospital to be admitted. He was not immediately admitted and his condition worsened. Beh was able to contact the hospital and arrange for his friend's expedited admission, which physicians mentioned saved his life.&lt;ref name=MInsiderMobile/&gt;

Beh had a background in the [[health care]] industry and began developing BookDoc as a way to connect patients to health care providers.&lt;ref name=MInsiderMobile/&gt; The goal of the app is to expedite diagnosis and patient care. It was officially launched as an app in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Consult the doctor through your smartphone|url=http://english.astroawani.com/lifestyle/consult-doctor-through-your-smartphone-74679|accessdate=2 November 2015|publisher=Astro Awani|date=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company received its first funding in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BookDoc Launches with Seed Funding|url=http://www.finsmes.com/2015/09/bookdoc-launches-with-seed-funding.html|accessdate=2 November 2015|publisher=FinSMEs|date=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial investors in the company include Danny Yeung – founder of Groupon Hong Kong, Datuk Yvonne Chia – former CEO of Hong Leong Bank Berhad, Kenny Thing – Chief Marketing Officer of Manulife Insurance Berhad, Dato Sharil Tarmizi – former Chairman of Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission, Dato Dr Maimunah - former Deputy Director General of Health Malaysia, and Lee Mean Yeit – former Head of Strategy of Sime Darby Healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BookDoc Initial Investors|url=http://bookdoc.com/bookdoc-initial-investors/|website=BookDoc Official Website|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platform==

The platform was initially launched to connect people with healthcare professionals, allowing them to book appointments with doctors using the mobile application.&lt;ref name=BloombergCOrporate/&gt; Initially, the app was specific for corporate clients to connect employees with panel clinics and hospitals.&lt;ref name=MInsiderMobile/&gt; Companies using the app have access to an analytic dashboard to view health seeking patterns to help evaluate employee's medical needs.&lt;ref name=MInsiderMobile/&gt;

[[File:Breadcrumb navigation in Nautilus.png|thumb|right|[[GNOME Files]], demonstrating its implementation of location-based breadcrumb navigation.]]
[[File:Dolphin barra indirizzi.png|thumb|right|Breadcrumb in [[Dolphin (file manager)|Dolphin]] file manager.]]
A '''breadcrumb''' or '''breadcrumb trail''' is a [[graphical control element]] frequently used as a navigational aid in [[user interface]]s and on [[Web page|web pages]]. It allows users to keep track and maintain awareness of their locations within programs, documents, or websites.

The term originates from the trail of [[bread crumbs]] left by [[Hansel and Gretel]] in the fairy tale of the same name.&lt;ref name="Mark Levene" /&gt;

== Usage ==
A breadcrumb trail tracks and displays each page viewed by a visitor of a website, either in the order the pages were viewed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://spidergems.com/breadcrumb-navigation|title=Breadcrumb Navigation {{!}} Spidergems|website=Spidergems|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or in other definitions, displaying a hierarchy of the current page in relation to the website's structure. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Demetri|title=16 Important Do’s and Don’ts of Effective Web Design|url=http://www.designtorontoweb.ca/16-important-dos-and-donts-of-effective-web-design-demetri-kiritsis-dtw-strategies/|publisher=Design Toronto Web|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breadcrumbs are typically placed in horizontal form under the masthead or navigation of a website. 

=== Websites ===
Breadcrumbs typically appear horizontally across the top of a Web page, often below title bars or headers. They provide links back to each previous page the user navigated through to get to the current page or—in hierarchical site structures—the parent pages of the current one. Breadcrumbs provide a trail for the user to follow back to the starting or entry point.&lt;ref name="Mark Levene"/&gt; A greater-than sign (&gt;) often serves as hierarchy separator, although designers may use other [[glyph]]s (such&amp;nbsp;as&amp;nbsp;»&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;›), as well as various graphical icons.

A breadcrumb trail or path based on viewing history is typically rendered as follows :

 Page viewed &gt; Page viewed &gt; Page viewed &gt; Page viewed &gt; Page currently being viewed

For instance, in this scenario, a website visitor views seven pages (note how the pages are tracked in order the user viewed them) :

 Home page &gt; Services &gt; About Us &gt; Home page &gt; Latest Newsletter &gt; Home page &gt; Page currently being viewed

Typical breadcrumbs following a hierarchical structure are shown as follows:

 Home page &gt; Section page &gt; Subsection page

=== Software ===
Current file managers including [[Windows Explorer]] (from [[Windows Vista]] onwards), [[Finder (software)|Finder]] (for [[Macintosh operating systems]]), [[GNOME]]'s [[Nautilus (file manager)|Nautilus]], [[KDE]]'s [[Dolphin (file manager)|Dolphin]], [[Xfce]]'s [[Thunar]], [[MATE (software)|MATE]]'s Caja, and SnowBird allow breadcrumb navigation, often replacing or extending an [[address bar]].{{CN|date=June 2016}}

== Types ==
There are three types of Web breadcrumbs:

&lt;!-- * '''Path (History)''': path (or history) breadcrumbs are dynamic and show the path that the user has taken to arrive at a page. --&gt;
* '''Location''': location breadcrumbs are static and show where the page is located in the website hierarchy.
* '''Attribute''': attribute breadcrumbs give information that categorizes the current page.
* '''Path''': path breadcrumbs show users the steps they took to end up on current page. 

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/03/breadcrumbs-in-web-design-examples-and-best-practices/|title=Breadcrumbs In Web Design: Examples And Best Practices|author=|date=17 March 2009|website=smashingmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.usabilla.com/breadcrumb-navigation-good-website-usability-not/|title=Breadcrumb Navigation: Good for Website Usability or Not? - Usabilla Blog|author=|date=28 September 2016|website=usabilla.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usability ==
Location breadcrumbs are not necessarily appropriate for sites whose content is so rich that single categories do not fully describe a particular piece of content. For this reason, a [[Tag (metadata)|tag]] may be more appropriate, though breadcrumbs can still be used to allow the user to retrace their steps and see how they arrived at the current page.

== Other names ==
Some commentators and programmers alternatively use the term "cookie crumb" as a synonym to describe the navigation design.&lt;br/&gt; This should not be confused with the term ''cookie'', which refers to [[HTTP cookie]]s (text files websites write on a visitor's machine that record data such as login information).&lt;!--
Do we still need this reference, or can it be discarded?: 
&lt;ref name="cookieright"&gt;''Managing Windows® with VBScript and WMI'' by Don Jones Published 2004 Addison-Wesley Professional ISBN 0-321-21334-3&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Michigan Community College's Virtual Learning Collaborative uses the term "Navigation Path",&lt;ref name="Blackboard help" /&gt; as do some [[Drupal]] users.&lt;ref name="Drupal navigation path" /&gt;

French and Spanish speakers sometimes use instead the term ''[[Ariadne's thread (logic)|Ariadne's thread]]'' (in French ''fil d'Ariane'') in relation to the thread left by [[Ariadne]] to [[Theseus]] so he can find the exit of the labyrinth after killing the [[Minotaur]], on a [[LIFO (computing)|LIFO]] (stack) instead of [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] (queue) way.

As a federal program it is administered by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) and as a California program it is administered by the [[California Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board]] (MRMIB).

As a result of the 2012-2013 budget deal, nearly 900,000 children will be moved from the HFP into Medi-Cal beginning in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Healthy Families Kids Will Move To Medi-Cal under New Budget Deal|first=Pauline|last=Bartolone|publisher=[[California Capitol Network]]|work=[[KPBS News]]|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2012/jun/21/healthy-families-kids-will-move-medi-cal-under-new/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dietitian''' (or '''dietician''')&lt;ref&gt;The spelling with "c" is listed first in UK dictionaries, for example [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/dietician?q=dietitian Oxford], [http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/dietician Longman], and [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/dietitian?

A dietitian alters their patient's nutrition based upon their medical condition and individual needs. Dietitians are regulated healthcare professionals licensed to assess, diagnose, and treat nutritional problems.&lt;ref&gt;

A registered dietitian (RD) or registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clinicalnutritioncenter.com/meet-our-medical-weight-loss-professionals/registered-dietitians-nutritionists/registered-dietitian-vs-nutritionist|title=Registered Dietitian  vs. Nutritionist - Clinical Nutrition Center|author=|date=|website=www.clinicalnutritioncenter.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a dietitian who meets all of a set of special academic and professional requirements, including the completion of a bachelor's degree with an accredited nutrition curriculum, an internship at an approved health-care facility, foodservice organization, or community agency, and satisfactory performance on a registration exam.

Roughly half of all RDNs hold [[Postgraduate education|graduate degrees]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietetics FAQs|url=https://nfsc.umd.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-admissions/dietetics-faqs|website=University of Maryland College of Agriculture and Natural Resources|publisher=University of Maryland|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many have certifications in specialized fields such as sports, pediatrics, renal, oncological, food-allergy, or gerontological nutrition. After learning about a patient's health history, favorite foods, eating and exercise habits, the RD helps the person to set goals and to prioritize. Follow-up visits often focus on maintenance and monitoring progress.

Most RDs work in the treatment and prevention of [[disease]] (administering medical nutrition therapy, as part of medical teams), often in hospitals, [[health maintenance organization|health-maintenance organization]]s, private practices, or other health-care facilities. In addition, a large number of registered dietitians work in community and public-health settings, and/or in academia and research. A growing number of dietitians work in the [[food industry]], journalism, sports nutrition, corporate wellness programs, and other non-traditional dietetics settings.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==The spellings "dietitian" and "dietician"==
As explained by the [[American Heritage Dictionary|American Heritage]] and [[Merriam-Webster]]'s dictionaries, the cause of the confusion is that the spelling with "-tian" is an irregular alteration of the ending "-cian", which is otherwise exclusively used to refer to specialists and practitioners of other professions.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dietitian|title=Definition of DIETITIAN|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ician|title=Definition of -ICIAN|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other American dictionaries also list the spelling with "c" but list the spelling with "t" first because this spelling is more common in the United States. Nevertheless, the American publisher McGraw-Hill exclusively uses the spelling with "c" in the 2003 edition of the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific &amp; Technical Terms and the 2002 edition of the McGraw-Hill ''Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/dietician|title=dietician|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2018|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/dietician|title=dietician|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2018|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spelling with "t" is the one preferred by the profession itself internationally, but the spelling with "c" is used often enough in texts not written by members of the profession to be considered a valid variant by both American and British dictionaries. In fact, British dictionaries list the spelling with "c" first&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/dietician?q=dietitian|title=dietician - Definition of dietician in English by Oxford Dictionaries|author=|date=|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/dietician|title=dietician - meaning of dietician in Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English - LDOCE|author=|date=|website=www.ldoceonline.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/dietitian?|title=Dietitian definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and list the spelling with "t" as a variant. American dictionaries list the spelling with "t" first and the spelling with "c" as a variant.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/dietitian|title=Dietitian dictionary definition - dietitian defined|author=|date=|website=www.yourdictionary.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As explained in a 2010 newsletter&lt;ref name="internationaldietetics.org"&gt;http://www.internationaldietetics.org/newsletter/vol17issue2/feature-article/the-c-in-dietitians-a-long-history-and-fading-futu.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; of the International Confederation of Dietetic Associations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The correct or preferable spelling of the term "dietitian" has been debated for a long time by dietitians. In the early 1960s dietetic associations, under the auspices of the International Committee of Dietetic Associations (ICDA), worked together to standardize information about dietitians under the International Standard Classification of Occupations. When the International Labour Office confirmed the dietetic profession's classification in 1967, it also adopted the spelling "dietitian" at the request of the international dietetic community. This information can be found in the documentation held by ICDA and by the [[International Labour Office]] (ILO).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Recently the ILO has however issued new documents using the spelling "dietician".&lt;ref name="internationaldietetics.org"/&gt;

==World Health Organization classification==
Dietitians supervise the preparation and [[foodservice|service of food]], develop modified [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]s, participate in [[research]], and educate individuals and groups on good nutritional habits.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;World Health Organization. ''Classifying health workers''. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BLS"&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos077.htm U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: ''Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010–11 Edition''.] — ''Dietitians and Nutritionists.'' Accessed 11 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The goals of dietitians are to provide medical nutritional intervention, and to obtain, [[food safety|safely prepare]], serve and advise on flavorsome, attractive, and nutritious food for patients, groups and communities. Dietary modification to address medical issues involving dietary intake is a major part of '''dietetics''' (the study of nutrition as it relates to health). For example, working in consultation with [[physician]]s and other health care providers, a dietitian may provide specific artificial nutritional needs to patients unable to consume food normally. Professional dietitians may also provide specialist services such as in [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[obesity]], [[oncology]], [[osteoporosis]], pediatrics, renal disease, and [[micronutrient]] research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thematicnetworkdietetics.eu/everyone/3025 DIETS Thematic Network for Dietetics.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411065828/http://www.thematicnetworkdietetics.eu/everyone/3025 |date=2011-04-11 }} ''Improving the nutrition of Europe through a fully evidenced based profession of dietetics''.

Different professional terms are used in different countries and employment settings, for example, clinical dietitian, community dietitian, dietetic educator, foodservice dietitian, registered dietitian, public health dietitian, therapeutic dietitian, or research dietitian.&lt;ref name="CANOCC"&gt;[http://stds.statcan.gc.ca/soc-cnp/2006/cs-rc-eng.asp?cretaria=D032&amp;keyword=nutritionist&amp;table=2&amp;code_level= Statistics Canada: ''National Occupational Classification 2006''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706181812/http://stds.statcan.gc.ca/soc-cnp/2006/cs-rc-eng.asp?cretaria=D032&amp;keyword=nutritionist&amp;table=2&amp;code_level= |date=2011-07-06 }} — ''D032 Dietitians and Nutritionists''. Accessed 11 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, only people who have specified educational credentials and other [[healthcare provider requisites|professional requirements]] can call themselves "dietitians" — the title is legally protected. The term "[[nutritionist]]" is also widely used; however, the terms "dietitian" and "nutritionist" should not be considered interchangeable — the training, regulation and [[scope of practice]] of the two professional titles can be very different across individuals and jurisdictions.

In many countries, the majority of dietitians are ''clinical'' or ''therapeutic'' dietitians, such as the case of the United States, the United Kingdom, and much of Africa. In other countries they are mostly foodservice dietitians, such as in Japan and many European countries.&lt;ref name="BLS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EMHJ"&gt;Hwalla N, Koleilat M. 'Dietetic practice: the past, present and future.' ''Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal'', 2004, 10(6):716–730 http://www.emro.who.int/Publications/EMHJ/1006/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietitians in practice==

===Clinical dietitians===
Clinical dietitians work in [[hospital]]s, [[nursing home|nursing care facilities]] and other health care facilities to provide nutrition therapy to [[patient]]s with a variety of health conditions, and provide dietary consultations to patients and their families. They confer with other health care professionals to review patients' [[medical record|medical charts]] and develop individual plans to meet nutritional requirements. Some clinical dietitians will also create or deliver outpatient or public education programs in health and nutrition.&lt;ref name="BLS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NHS"/&gt; Clinical dietitians may provide specialized services in areas of [[nourishment]] and [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]s, tube feedings (called [[Nasogastric intubation|enteral nutrition]]), and intravenous feedings (called parenteral nutrition) such as [[total parenteral nutrition]] (TPN) or peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN). They work as a team with the [[physicians]], [[physician assistants]], [[physical therapist]]s, [[occupational therapists]], [[pharmacists]], [[speech therapist]]s, [[social workers]], [[nurses]], dietetic technicians, and other [[career]]s to provide care to patients. Some clinical dietitians have dual responsibilities with patient nutrition therapy and in foodservice or research (described below).

===Community dietitians===
[[Community]] dietitians work with wellness programs, [[public health]] agencies, [[home care]] agencies, and health maintenance organizations. These dietitians apply and distribute knowledge about food and nutrition to individuals and groups of specific categories, life-styles and geographic areas in order to [[health promotion|promote health]]. They often focus on the needs of the elderly, children, or other individuals with special needs or limited access to healthy food. Some community dietitians conduct home visits for patients who are too physically ill to attend consultations in health facilities in order to provide care and instruction on grocery shopping and food preparation.&lt;ref name="BLS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ALTA"/&gt;

===Food Service dietitians===
[[Foodservice]] dietitians or managers are responsible for large-scale food planning and service. They coordinate, assess and plan foodservice processes in [[health care]] facilities, [[school]] food service programs, [[prison]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and company [[cafeteria]]s.&lt;ref name="ALTA"&gt;[http://alis.alberta.ca/occinfo/Content/RequestAction.asp?aspAction=GetHTMLProfile&amp;format=html&amp;occPro_ID=71002430 Alberta Employment and Immigration: ''Alberta Occupational Profiles – Dietitian''.] Accessed 1 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These dietitians may perform audits of their departments to ensure quality control and food safety standards, and launch new menus and various programs within their institution to meet health and nutritional requirements. They train and supervise other food service workers such as kitchen staff, delivery staff, and dietary assistants or aides.

===Gerontological dietitians===
[[Gerontology|Gerontological]] dietitians are specialists in nutrition and aging. They work in [[nursing homes]], community-based aged care agencies, government agencies in aging policy, and in higher education in the field of [[gerontology]] (the study of aging).

===Neonatal dietitians===
Neonatal dietitians provide individualized medical nutrition therapy for critically ill premature newborns. They are considered a part of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit's medical team. The neonatal dietitian performs clinical assessment of patients, designs nutrition protocols and quality improvement initiatives with the medical team, develops enteral and parenteral regimens, helps establish and promote lactation/breastfeeding guidelines and often oversees the management of infection prevention in the handling, storage, and delivery of nutritional products.

===Pediatric dietitians===
Pediatric dietitians provide nutrition and health advice for infants, children, and adolescents. They focus on early nutritional needs, and often work closely with doctors, [[school health services]], clinics, hospitals and government agencies, in developing and implementing treatment plans for children with eating disorders, food allergies, or any condition where a child's diet factors into the equation, such as [[childhood obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pediatricdietitian.net/pediatric-dietician/ PediatricDietician.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107051750/http://www.pediatricdietitian.net/pediatric-dietician/ |date=2010-11-07 }}. Accessed 14 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research dietitians===
[[Research]] dietitians may focus on [[social sciences]] or [[health services research]], for example, investigate the impact of [[health policy|health policies]] or [[behavior change (public health)|behaviour change]], or evaluate program effectiveness.&lt;ref name="ALTA"/&gt; They may survey foodservice systems management in order to guide quality improvement. Some research dietitians study the biochemical aspects of nutrient interaction within the body.&lt;ref&gt;de Jong N et al. 'Functional Biochemical and Nutrient Indices in Frail Elderly People Are Partly Affected by Dietary Supplements but Not by Exercise.' ''Journal of Nutrition'' 1999;129:2028–2036.&lt;/ref&gt; In universities, they also may have teaching responsibilities. Some clinical dietitians' roles involve research in addition to their patients care [[workload]].

===Administrative dietitians===
[[Administration (business)|Administrative]] or [[management]] dietitians oversee and direct all aspects of clinical dietetics service, food policy and/or large-scale meal service operations in hospitals, government agencies, company cafeterias, prisons, and schools. They recruit, train and supervise employees of dietetics departments including dietitians and other personnel. They set department goals, policies and procedures; procurement, equipment and supplies; ensure safety and sanitation standards in foodservice; and administer budget management.&lt;ref name="BLS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ALTA"/&gt;

===Business dietitians===
[[Business]] dietitians serve as resource people in food and nutrition through business, marketing and communications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dbconline.org/ ''Dietitians in Business and Communications (DBC)''] – dietetic practice group of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Accessed 13 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dietitians' expertise in nutrition is often solicited in the [[Mass media|media]] — for example providing expert guest opinion on television and radio news or cooking shows, columnist for a newspaper or magazine, or resource for restaurants on recipe development and critique. Business dietitians may author books or corporate newsletters on nutrition and wellness. They also work as [[sales representatives]] for food manufacturing companies that provide [[nutritional supplements]] and tube feeding supplies.

===Consultant dietitians===
[[Consultant]] dietitian is a term used to describe dietitians who are in [[Medical practice|private practice]] or practice on a contractual basis with health care facilities or corporations, such as used in Australia, Canada and the United States.&lt;ref name="BLS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CANOCC"/&gt; Consultant dietitians [[contract]] independently to provide nutrition or health related consultation and educational programs to individuals and health care facilities as well as sports teams, fitness clubs, and other health related businesses and corporations.

==Required qualifications and professional associations==
In most countries, competent performance as a dietitian requires formal training at a higher educational institution in dietetics involving [[Food and Nutrition Service|food and nutritional science]], nutrition education and medical nutrition therapy.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt; Their education in [[health science]] involves scientific based knowledge in [[anatomy]], [[chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], [[biology]], and [[physiology]].

While the specific [[healthcare provider requisites|academic and professional requirements]] to becoming a fully qualified dietitian differ across countries and jurisdictions, as these are adapted to the needs of the individual countries and the opportunities available,&lt;ref name="EMHJ"/&gt; common academic routes include:

*A [[bachelor degree]] in Dietetics which typically requires four years of postsecondary studies; ''or''
*A bachelor of science degree and a [[postgraduate]] [[diploma]] or [[master's degree]] in Dietetics.

In addition, dietitians may be required to undergo an [[intern]]ship to learn counseling skills and aspects of [[psychology]]. The internship process differs across countries and jurisdictions.

Associations for dietetics professionals exist in many countries on every continent.&lt;ref name="EMHJ"/&gt;

===Australia===
Accredited Practising Dietitians (APDs) in [[Australia]] gain their qualifications through university courses accredited by the Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://daa.asn.au/]&lt;/ref&gt; In order for patients to receive a rebate from the national [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] system or private health insurance, APD status is required. APDs are Dietitians engaged in the Continuing Professional Development program offered by the DAA and commit to uphold the DAA Code of Professional Conduct and Code of Ethics.

Dietitians who are not members of the DAA may participate in the DAA's Continuing Professional Development Program and in this way can still hold APD status. However, under new rules (which commenced 1 July 2009),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/LegislativeInstrument1.nsf/framelodgmentattachments/728B2E067A609724CA25746A00272158 Australian Government: ''ComLaw'']&lt;/ref&gt; health care providers must either have statutory registration or be members of their national professional association to obtain a provider number. This means all private health funds will require private practitioners applying for provider numbers to be DAA members (not just ‘eligible’ for membership).

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], 'Dietitian' is a protected professional title. Additionally, 'Registered Dietitian' and 'Professional Dietitian' are protected in some provinces. Each province has an independent professional college (for example, The College of Dietitians of Ontario).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdo.on.ca/en/ The College of Dietitians of Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312011819/http://www.cdo.on.ca/en/ |date=2011-03-12 }} Accessed 1 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;) which is responsible for protecting the public and regulating the profession. The colleges are entirely funded from licensing fees collected from dietitians.  Each college must have both public and professional members, and is empowered to investigate and censure (when malpractice/negligence is found) members of the profession who breach either their [[scope of practice]] or harm/endanger the health of a patient/client, and receive a complaint against them from a member of the public or another health care professional.  To practice as a registered dietitian within a province, a dietitian must register with the college and obtain a license. The activities of the college are governed by legislation passed by the provincial government. It is the presence of this regulatory body which distinguishes registered dietitians from [[nutritionist]]s in Canada, the regulations for which vary by province (Exceptions: Alberta where "Registered Nutritionist" is a protected title that can only be used by dietitians. Similarly in Nova Scotia and Québec "Nutritionist" is protected and can only be used by dietitians)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dietitians.ca/Downloads/Public/Dietitians-SmartChoice-Col.aspx Dietitians of Canada: Dietitians promote health through food and nutrition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628083610/http://www.dietitians.ca/Downloads/Public/Dietitians-SmartChoice-Col.aspx |date=2015-06-28 }} Accessed 3 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The colleges also set the minimum entry requirements for admission into practice as a registered dietitian. [[Healthcare provider requisites|Requirements to entry into practice]] as a dietitian include a four-year undergraduate degree from an accredited university (which includes courses in science, foods, nutrition, management, communication and psychology/sociology, among others), a 10–12 month supervised practice period (called an [[internship]]), and successfully passing a board exam in nutrition and dietetics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dietitians.ca/Become-a-Dietitian/Education.aspx Dietitians of Canada: Become a Dietitian: Education] Accessed 3 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The national professional association in Canada is [[Dietitians of Canada]].

===South Africa===
In South Africa, dietitians must be registered with the Health Professions Council of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpcsa.co.za/board_dietetics.php Health Professions Council of South Africa: ''Dietetics and Nutrition Professional Board''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323083941/http://www.hpcsa.co.za/board_dietetics.php |date=2011-03-23 }} Accessed 1 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The council regulates the following professional titles: Dietitians, Supplementary Dietitians, and Student Dietitians, as well as Nutritionists, Supplementary Nutritionists, and Student nutritionists. Requirements for eligibility for registration include a recognised bachelor's degree in dietetics or nutrition from an accredited educational institution. The undergraduate training should include the three practice areas of therapeutic nutrition, community nutrition, and food service management.

Against the backdrop of the [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa]], there remains high demand for greater numbers of practicing dietitians, along with other health care staff, in order to expand public sector health care services.&lt;ref&gt;van Rensburg DHCJ et al. 'Human resource development and antiretroviral treatment in Free State province, South Africa.' ''Human Resources for Health'', 2008; 6:15 http://www.human-resources-health.com/content/6/1/15&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic programs, professional associations, and credentialing requirements do not exist for dietitians in most other African countries, where the number of professionals in dietetics is very low.&lt;ref name="EMHJ"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, dietitians must be registered with the [[Health and Care Professions Council]] (HCPC, formerly the Health Professions Council, HPC) in order to be able to work for the [[National Health Service]].&lt;ref name="NHS"/&gt; The education requirements include obtaining either a BSc in dietetics or a postgraduate qualification approved by the HCPC.

===United States===
In the United States, nutrition professionals include the '''dietitian''' or '''registered dietitian''' (RD), as well as "dietetic technician" or "dietetic technician, registered" (DTR) (see below). These terms are legally protected, regulated by the [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] which registers and confers professional credentials. The Academy also recognizes and certifies certain specialty areas, such as in Gerontological Nutrition.&lt;ref name="Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|title=Eatright.org|url=http://www.eatright.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dietitians are registered with the Commission on Dietetic Registration (the certifying agency of the Academy) and are only able to use the label "Registered Dietitian" when they have met specific educational and professional prerequisites and passed a national registration examination. Besides academic education, dietitians must complete at least 1200 hours of practical, supervised experience through an accredited program before they can sit for the registration examination. In a coordinated program, students acquire internship hours concurrently with their coursework. In a didactic program, these hours are obtained through a dietetic [[internship]] that is completed after obtaining a degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eatright.org/BecomeanRDorDTR/content.aspx?id=8142 Become an RD or DTR.] Accessed 12 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In both programs the student is required to complete several areas of competency including rotations in clinical, community, long-term care nutrition as well as food service, [[public health]] and a variety of other worksites.

Once the degree is earned, the internship completed, and registration examination passed, the individual can use the nationally recognized legal title, "Registered Dietitian", and is able to work in a variety of professional settings. To maintain the RD credential, professionals must participate in and earn continuing education units (often 75 hours every 5 years).

In addition, many states require specific [[licensing|licensure]] to work in most settings. For instance, the California Business and Professions Code Section 2585-2586.8,&lt;ref name="California"&gt;[http://law.justia.com/codes/california/2009/bpc/2585-2586.8.html Justia.com US Law: ''California Business and Professions Code Section 2585-2586.8''] — ''Chapter 5.65. Dietitians''. Accessed 11 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; states that:

''Any person representing himself or herself as a registered dietitian shall meet one of the following qualifications'': 
#Been granted, prior to January 1, 1981, the right to use the term "registered dietitian" by a public or private agency or institution recognized by the [[California Department of Health Services|State Department of Health Services]] as qualified to grant the title, provided that person continues to meet all requirements and qualifications periodically prescribed by the agency or institution for the maintenance of that title.
#Possess all of the following qualifications:
::(A) Be 18 years of age or older.
::(B) Satisfactory completion of appropriate academic requirements for the field of dietetics and related disciplines and receipt of a baccalaureate or higher degree from a college or university accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] or other regional accreditation agency.
::(C) Satisfactory completion of a program of supervised practice for a minimum of 1200 hours that is designed to prepare entry level practitioners through instruction and assignments in a clinical setting. Supervisors of the program shall meet minimum qualifications established by public or private agencies or institutions recognized by the State Department of Health Services to establish those qualifications.

In addition: ''It is a misdemeanor for any person not meeting the criteria... in connection with his or her name or place of business, the words "dietetic technician, registered," "dietitian," "dietician," "registered dietitian," "registered dietician," or the letters "RD," "DTR," or any other words, letters, abbreviations, or insignia indicating or implying that the person is a dietitian, or dietetic technician, registered or registered dietitian, or to represent, in any way, orally, in writing, in print or by sign, directly or by implication, that he or she is a dietitian or a dietetic technician, registered or a registered dietitian''.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;

As recent studies have shown the importance of diet in both [[preventive medicine|disease prevention]] and management, many US states have moved towards covering medical nutrition therapy under the [[Medicaid]]/[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] social insurance programs, making dietetics a much more lucrative profession due to insurance reimbursement.

In the United States the "governing body" of Dietetics practice is the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly the ADA). This group is made up of approximately 72,000 members nationwide who support each other and develop their Professional Portfolio together.&lt;ref&gt;"The Profession of Dietetics: A Team Approach" {{cite web |url=http://www.jblearning.com/catalog/9781284026085/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224010614/http://www.jblearning.com/catalog/9781284026085/ |archivedate=2015-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Confederation of Dietetic Associations (ICDA)===
The International Confederation of Dietetic Associations (ICDA) is a membership organization of over 40 national associations of Dietitians and Nutritionists.  Dietetics associations are professional societies whose members have education qualifications in food, nutrition and dietetics recognized by a national authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationaldietetics.org International Confederation of Dietetic Associations.] Accessed 5 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICDA supports national dietetics associations and their members, beyond national and regional boundaries, by providing:
* An integrated communications system
* An enhanced image for the profession
* Increased awareness of standards of education, training and practice in dietetics.

==Other nutrition personnel==
These titles are general designations of nutrition personnel. Specific titles may vary across countries, jurisdictions and employment settings. In particular the title [[nutritionist]] is, in some countries, unregulated so anyone may claim to be a nutritionist.

===Dietetic technicians===
'''Dietetic technicians''' are involved in planning, implementing and monitoring nutritional programs and services in facilities such as [[hospital]]s, nursing homes and schools. They assist in education and assessment of clients' dietary needs, and may specialize in nutritional care or foodservice management. Dietetic technicians usually work with, and under the supervision of, a registered dietitian.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. [http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes292051.htm Occupational Employment Statistics: Dietetic Technicians.] Occupational Employment and Wages, May 2010. Accessed 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mississippi Hospital Association. [http://www.mshealthcareers.com/careers/dietetictech.htm Health Careers Center: Dietetic Technician.] Accessed 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ontario"&gt;College of Dietitians of Ontario. [http://www.cdo.on.ca/en/becomeRD/default.asp#dietetic Dietetic Technicians.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729075027/http://www.cdo.on.ca/en/becomeRD/default.asp#dietetic |date=2011-07-29 }} Accessed 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The training requirements and professional regulation of dietetic technicians vary across countries, but usually include some formal (postsecondary) training in dietetics and nutrition care. In jurisdictions where the profession is regulated, such as in the United States, the title "'''Dietetic Technician, Registered'''" (DTR) may be used.

====Canada====
In Canada, there are national standards for academic training and qualifications for dietetic technicians, according to CSNM (the Canadian Society for Nutrition Management).&lt;ref name="Ontario"/&gt; In Ontario, [[Conestoga College]] offers a diploma program with a clinical focus for dietetic technicians.&lt;ref&gt;Conestoga College. In British Columbia, Langara College of Vancouver offers a diploma program for dietetic technicians with a focus on foodservice management. Also the Canadian Healthcare Association, based out of Ottawa, offers a certificate in foodservice management for diet technicians. [http://www.conestogac.on.ca/fulltime/program.jsp?SchoolID=3&amp;ProgramCode=1155&amp;v=1001&amp;p=o Program Details: Dietetic Technician.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927071826/http://www.conestogac.on.ca/fulltime/program.jsp?SchoolID=3&amp;ProgramCode=1155&amp;v=1001&amp;p=o |date=2011-09-27 }} Accessed 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
In the United States, the [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] confers the "Dietetic Technician, Registered" (DTR) credentials. Qualified DTRs possess a specialized associate degree from [[community college]] programs which are accredited by the Academy's Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics Education (ACEND). They must complete a dietetic internship with a minimum of 450 supervised practice hours in the areas of Food Service Theory and Management, Community Dietetics, and Clinical Dietetics.  They must also successfully pass a national registration examination administered by the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR) of the Academy. The DTR is an Academy-credentialed nutrition practitioner who works independently in many nutrition settings; however, when performing clinical dietetics, they must work under the supervision of a Registered Dietitian. Some states have legislation specifying the [[scope of practice]] for the DTR in medical nutrition therapy settings.

Effective June 1, 2009, a new pathway to becoming a Registered Dietetic Technician has been made available by the Commission on Dietetic Registration. Students may take the DTR examination without attending an internship after completion of a Baccalaureate degree granted by a US regionally accredited college/university, or foreign equivalent, and completion of an ACEND Didactic Program in Dietetics or Coordinated Program in Dietetics. Applicants must take and pass the CDR Dietetic Technician Registration Exam to qualify for the DTR credential.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdrnet.org/programdirector/NewPathwayIII.cfm Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827015359/http://www.cdrnet.org/programdirector/NewPathwayIII.cfm |date=2012-08-27 }}, the credentialing agency for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.&lt;/ref&gt;

As for Registered Dietitians, in many cases the title "Dietetic Technician" is regulated by individual states.  For instance, according to the  California Business and Professions Code Section 2585-2586.8:&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;
''Any person representing himself or herself as a dietetic technician, registered shall possess all of the following qualifications'': 
:(1) Be 18 years of age or older.
:(2) Satisfactory completion of appropriate academic requirements and receipt of an [[associate's degree]] or higher from a college or university accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] or other regional accreditation agency.
:(3) Satisfactory completion of the dietetic technician program requirements by an accredited public or private agency or institution recognized by the State Department of Health Services including not less than 450 hours of supervised practice.
:(4) Satisfactory completion of an examination administered by a public or private agency or institution recognized by the State Department of Health Services to administer the examination.
:(5) Satisfactory completion of continuing education requirements established by a public or private agency or institution recognized by the State Department of Health Services to establish the requirements.

===Dietary assistants===
'''Dietary assistants''', also known as "nutrition assistants" or "dietary aides", assist dietitians and other nutrition professionals to maintain nutritional care for patients and groups with special dietary needs. They assist in preparing food in hospitals, childcare centres, and aged care facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Government of South Australia. [http://www.tafesa.edu.au/xml/profile/profile_330.aspx TAFE South Australia: Nutrition Assistant (Dietary Aide).] Accessed 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dietary aides in some countries might also carry out a simple initial [[health screening]] for newly admitted patients in medical facilities, and inform the dietitian if any screened patients requires a dietitian's [[expertise]] for further assessments or [[Health intervention|intervention]]s.

===Dietary clerks===
''Dietary clerks'', also sometimes known as "medical diet clerks" or "dietary workers", prepare dietary information for use by kitchen personnel in preparation of foods for hospital patients following standards established by a dietitian. They examine diet orders, prepare meal trays, maintain the storage area for food supplies, and ensure practice of sanitary procedures. They may operate computers to enter and retrieve data on patients' caloric requirements and intake, or to track financial information. Dietary workers are typically trained on the job.&lt;ref&gt;CBsalary. [http://www.cbsalary.com/national-salary-chart.aspx?specialty=Medical+Diet+Clerk&amp;cty=&amp;sid=&amp;kw=Medical&amp;jn=jn023&amp;edu=&amp;tid=68881&amp;cbRecursionCnt=1&amp;cbsid=c623f84074814332a4fd84537eb4c245-326911720-RQ-4&amp;ns_siteid=ns_us_g_rate_of_pay_for_a_die_ Medical Diet Clerk Salary.] Accessed 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dietary managers===
{{See also|Dietary management}}
'''Dietary managers''' supervise the production and distribution of meals, as well as the budgeting and purchasing of food and the hiring, training and scheduling of support staff in various types of workplaces offering larger scale [[foodservice]]s, such as hospitals, nursing homes, school and college cafeterias, restaurants, correction facilities and [[catering]] services.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Health Careers. [http://www.flahec.org/hlthcareers/DIETMGR.HTM Dietetics and Nutrition: Dietary manager.] Accessed 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Society of Nutrition Management. [http://www.osnm.org/content/dietary-manager-extended-application-deadline Dietary Manager.]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Accessed 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; They assure their department is compliant with [[food safety]] regulations, and that the food served meets dietary requirements established by a dietitian.

Training requirements vary across jurisdictions and employment settings. Dietary management is not usually subject to professional regulation, although voluntary certification is preferred by many employers.
* In Canada, dietary managers with recognized training in areas such as diet therapy, menu planning, food safety and food production may become members of the Canadian Society of Nutrition Management (CSNM).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csnm.ca/content/about-csnm Canadian Society of Nutrition Management.] Accessed 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the United States, "''Certified Dietary Managers''" are certified by the credentialing agency known as the Association of Nutrition &amp; Foodservice Professionals (ANFP). This agency also certifies a professional known as a ''"Certified Food Protection Professional"''.  The ANFP certifies specific programs to meet its educational requirements, including courses in culinary management, clinical nutrition, and food safety. In addition, there are supervised practice requirements and a certification exam that must be passed.

===Dietary hosts===
'''Dietary hosts/hostesses''', also known as "food service aides", assist in patient tray services in hospitals and other health care settings, usually under the supervision of the dietary manager. They distribute menus, and prepare, deliver and bring back meal trays.&lt;ref&gt;Advocate Health Care. [http://jobs.advocatehealth.com/libertyville/dietary-and-food-services-jobs Food service worker registry.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313115825/http://jobs.advocatehealth.com/libertyville/dietary-and-food-services-jobs |date=2012-03-13 }} Accessed 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually no specific training is required for workers in this category.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1194">'''Drum drying''' is a method used for drying out liquids from raw materials with [[drying drum]]. In the drum-drying process, pureed raw ingredients are dried at relatively low temperatures over rotating, high-capacity drums that produce sheets of drum-dried product. This product is milled to a finished flake or powder form. Modern drum drying techniques results in dried ingredients which reconstitute immediately and retain much of their original flavor, color and nutritional value.

Some advantages of drum drying include the ability of drum dryers to dry viscous foods which cannot be easily dried with other methods. Drum dryers can be clean and hygienic and easy to operate and maintain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Agriculture, Food, and Biological Engineering|publisher=Marcel Dekker, Inc.|isbn=0-8247-0938-1|pages=211–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other products where drum drying can be used are, for example, [[starch]]es, [[breakfast cereals]], [[baby food]], [[instant mashed potatoes]] to make them cold-water-soluble.

PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy shares several clinical features with other early-onset epileptic encephalopathies, such as [[Severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy|Dravet Syndrome]], [[Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus]]&amp;nbsp;(GEFS+), [[Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome|FIRES]] (febrile infection–related epilepsy syndrome)&amp;nbsp;[[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]]&amp;nbsp;or epilepsy of unknown origin.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; However, the disorder has a distinct evolution of symptoms, and is associated with specific genetic mutations of the PCDH19 gene.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

=== Seizures&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;===
The hallmark characteristic of PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy is early-onset cluster seizures that often cause cyanotic spells, which start in infancy or early childhood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The onset of the first cluster of seizures usually coincides with a fever ([[febrile seizure]]s), however subsequent seizures may be febrile or afebrile.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marini C, Mei D, Parmeggiani L, Norci V, Calado E, Ferrari A, Moreira A, Pisano T, Specchio N, Vigevano F, Battaglia D, Guerrini R | title = Protocadherin 19 mutations in girls with infantile-onset epilepsy | journal = Neurology | volume = 75 | issue = 7 | pages = 646–53 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20713952 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181ed9e67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The seizure clusters are generally brief seizures, lasting 1–5 minutes, often accompanied by fearful screaming observed in 63% of girls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marini C, Darra F, Specchio N, Mei D, Terracciano A, Parmeggiani L, Ferrari A, Sicca F, Mastrangelo M, Spaccini L, Canopoli ML, Cesaroni E, Zamponi N, Caffi L, Ricciardelli P, Grosso S, Pisano T, Canevini MP, Granata T, Accorsi P, Battaglia D, Cusmai R, Vigevano F, Dalla Bernardina B, Guerrini R |display-authors = 6| title = Focal seizures with affective symptoms are a major feature of PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 53 | issue = 12 | pages = 2111–9 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 22946748 | issn = 1528-1167| doi = 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2012.03649.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cluster seizures can occur more than 10 times a day over several days, with varying amounts of time between seizure clusters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

Over time, children with PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy tend to exhibit multiple seizure types, including [[Partial seizure|focal]], generalized [[Tonic–clonic seizure|tonic-clonic]], [[Tonic–clonic seizure|tonic]], [[Atonic seizure|atonic]], [[Myoclonic epilepsy|myclonus]], and [[absence seizure]]s.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; In a small study of 35 female patients with PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy, rare episodes of status epilepticus occurred in about 30% of patients in the early course of the disorder.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

In PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy, the seizures are often refractory to treatment, especially in infancy and childhood.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Additionally, seizures are usually characterized by persistence of cluster seizures, with variable frequency.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In a study of 35 female patients with PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy, approximately 30% had become seizure free in the girl's childhood (mean age of 12 years), yet some continued into adulthood.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In the same study, a few patients still had recurrent cluster seizures that evolved into [[status epilepticus]] in childhood or early adolescence.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Developmental problems===
Beyond early-onset and treatment-resistant cluster seizures, PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy is usually, but not always, associated with cognitive and sensory impairment of varying degrees, and psychiatric and behavioral problems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scheffer" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It is estimated that up to 60 to 75% of the females have cognitive deficits, ranging from mild to severe intellectual disability, which do not appear to be related to frequency or severity of seizures.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scheffer" /&gt; Development over the course of a female patients’ childhood can follow one of three courses: delays from birth that persist into adulthood, normal development and then regression, or normal intellectual development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; It is not yet clear why some people experience delayed intellectual growth and others regress with epilepsy.&lt;ref name="scheffer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marini"&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 29, 2010|title=Infantile onset focal epilepsy and epilepetic encephalopathies associated with PCDH19 gene mutations: New de novo and familial mutations.|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2010.02658.x/pdf|journal=9th European Congress on Epileptology|volume=51|pages=1–189|doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2010.02658.x|author=Marini C.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the University of Melbourne study, two-thirds of PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy patients have&amp;nbsp;[[borderline intellectual functioning]]&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;[[intellectual disability]], while one third have normal intelligence.&lt;ref name="scheffer" /&gt; A connection to&amp;nbsp;[[Depression (mood)|depression]],&amp;nbsp;[[autism]], [[Fixation (psychology)|obsessive]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[aggressive behavior]]s&amp;nbsp;and other disorders has been observed in PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scheffer" /&gt; Approximately 40-60% of girls diagnosed with a PCDH19 mutation are on the autism spectrum.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scheffer" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Many of those with PCDH19 gene mutations also exhibit behavioral and psychological problems – including [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], aggression, [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive disorder]], and anxiety.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scheffer" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Other neurological abnormalities may present, including sleep disturbances, ictal apnea, motor deficits, [[hypotonia]], language delay, [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction|sensory integration problems]] and [[dysautonomia]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Causes==
A 2008 study, found a relationship between the PCDH19 gene and early onset female seizures, with subsequent studies confirming the relationship.&lt;ref name="scheffer" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marini" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Specchio|first=N|date=2011-08-01|title=Stormy Onset Epilepsy in Girls with De Novo Protocadherin 19 Mutations|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03206.x/abstract|journal=Epilepsia|language=en|volume=52|issue=|pages=4–22|doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03206.x|issn=1528-1167|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy can arise as a single case in a family, due to a de novo error in cell replication, or it can be inherited.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In a large series of cases in which inheritance was determined, half of the PCDH19 mutations occurred de novo, and half were inherited from fathers in good health, and who had no evidence of seizures or cognitive disorders.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Men and women can transmit the PCDH19 mutation, although females, but not males, usually, but not always, exhibit symptoms, which can be very mild. Females with a mutation have a 50% chance of having children who are carriers. Men have a 100% chance of transmitting the mutation to a daughter and 0% chance to a son.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scheffer" /&gt;

Although males do not generally exhibit PCDH19 gene-related history such as cluster seizures, in a study involving four families with PCDH19 gene mutations, 5 of the fathers had obsessive and controlling tendencies.&lt;ref name="scheffer" /&gt; The linkage of chromosome Xq22.1 to PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy in females was confirmed in all of the families.&lt;ref name="scheffer" /&gt;

The inheritance pattern is very unusual, in that men that carry the PCDH19 gene mutation on their only X-chromosome are typically unaffected, except in rare instances of somatic mosaicism.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Alternatively, approximately 90% of women, who have the mutation on one of their two X-chromosomes, exhibit symptoms.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It has been suggested that the greater occurrence of PCDH19-epilepsy in females may relate to&amp;nbsp;[[X-inactivation|X-chromosome inactivation]], through a hypothesized mechanism termed ‘‘cellular interference’’.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

A 2011 study found instances where patients had PCDH19 mutation, but their parents did not. They found that "[[gonadal mosaicism]]”&amp;nbsp;of a PCDH19 mutation in a parent is an important molecular mechanism associated with the inheritance of a mutated PCDH19 gene.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dibbens|first=L.

===Genetics===
The PCDH19 gene is located on the long (q) arm of the X chromosome at position 22.1.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The gene encodes for protocadherin 19, a transmembrane protein of calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules that is strongly expressed in neural tissue, such as the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and amygdala.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Protocadherin 19 appears to be related to synaptic transmission and formation of synaptic connections during brain development.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

A mutation in the PCDH19 gene can cause the protocadherin 19 protein to be malformed, reduced in function or not produced at all.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This abnormal expression of protocadherin 19 causes deficits in [[GABAergic]] signaling, causing the occurrence of seizures beginning in the early years of life.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The expression of the PCDH19 mutation is highly variable, with some individuals appearing unaffected, and others showing severe disease.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Even monozygotic twins with the mutation may have variations in seizure frequency and degree of cognitive impairment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Currently, the PCDH19 gene is the second most clinically relevant gene in the epilepsy field; the second largest number of epilepsy related mutations characterized thus far occur in the PCDH19 gene.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The [[Nav1.1|SCN1A gene]], associated with [[Severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy|Dravet Syndrome]], is the most clinically relevant.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1318/|title=SCN1A-Related Seizure Disorders|last=Miller|first=Ian O.|last2=Sotero de Menezes|first2=Marcio A.|date=1993-01-01|publisher=University of Washington, Seattle|editor-last=Pagon|editor-first=Roberta A.|location=Seattle (WA)|pmid=20301494|editor-last2=Adam|editor-first2=Margaret P.|editor-last3=Ardinger|editor-first3=Holly H.|editor-last4=Wallace|editor-first4=Stephanie E.|editor-last5=Amemiya|editor-first5=Anne|editor-last6=Bean|editor-first6=Lora JH|editor-last7=Bird|editor-first7=Thomas D.|editor-last8=Fong|editor-first8=Chin-To|editor-last9=Mefford|editor-first9=Heather C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sugawara|first=Takashi|last2=Tsurubuchi|first2=Yuji|last3=Agarwala|first3=Kishan Lal|last4=Ito|first4=Masatoshi|last5=Fukuma|first5=Goryu|last6=Mazaki-Miyazaki|first6=Emi|last7=Nagafuji|first7=Hiroshi|last8=Noda|first8=Masaharu|last9=Imoto|first9=Keiji|date=2001-05-22|title=A missense mutation of the Na+ channel αII subunit gene Nav1.2 in a patient with febrile and afebrile seizures causes channel dysfunction|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/98/11/6384|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=98|issue=11|pages=6384–6389|doi=10.1073/pnas.111065098|issn=0027-8424|pmc=33477|pmid=11371648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
Due to its recent discovery, PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy does not have a specific classification according to the [[International League Against Epilepsy]].

PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy is thought to develop based upon a deficiency of the calcium-dependent cell-adhesion PCDH19 (protocadherin 19) gene.&lt;ref name="PCHD19"&gt;{{cite journal |title= PCDH19 Gene |journal= Genetic Home Reference |url= http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PCDH19 | publisher=Genetics Home Reference, U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=December 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Cell adhesion is mediated by cell surface proteins.|group="nb"}} Its cause and [[pathophysiology]] (cause and mechanisms by which damage occurs) are different from other epilepsies, although the symptoms are very similar to other epileptic syndromes, such as [[Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus]] (GEFS+), [[Dravet's syndrome|Dravet syndrome]] with [[SCN1A]] negative, FIRES (febrile infection–related epilepsy syndrome) [[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]] or epilepsy of unknown origin.&lt;ref name="firessyndrome"&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 2011|title=Acute-onset epilepsy triggered by fever mimicking FIRES febrile infection–related epilepsy syndrome: The role of protocadherin 19 (PCDH19) gene mutation|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03193.x/abstract|journal=Epilepsia|volume=52|issue=11|pages=e172–e175|doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03193.x|author1=Nicola Specchio|author2=Lucia Fusco|author3=Federico Vigevano|pmid=21777234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy is clinically based on patient and family seizure history, cognitive and behavioral neuropsychological evaluation, neurological examination, [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalogram (EEG)]] studies, and long term observation. Diagnosis is confirmed using molecular testing for PCDH19 mutations.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===Diagnostic test===
The test is particularly indicated in children who have had cluster seizures in series. It is also recommended for patients who are diagnosed GEFS+ and when the seizures are associated with fever, infection, experienced regression, delayed cognitive growth or behavioral problems. The test is typically ordered by&amp;nbsp;[[neurologist]]s. The diagnostic test can be done by drawing blood or saliva of the patient and their immediate family. It is analyzed in laboratories that specialize in&amp;nbsp;[[genetic testing]]. Genetic testing can aid in a firmer diagnosis and understanding of the disorder, may aid in identifying the optimal treatment plan and if positive, testing of the parents can determine if they are carriers. (See&amp;nbsp;[[Genetic Counseling]])

==Treatment==

===Medication===
[[Antiepileptic drugs]]&amp;nbsp;(AEDs) are used in most cases to control seizures, however, PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy is generally associated with early-onset development of drug resistant seizures.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Existing data supports the use of “rational polypharmacy,” which consists of a step-wise addition of AEDs until a patient responds favorably or experiences intolerable adverse events.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In general, as in other types of uncontrolled epilepsy, the use of drugs with different mechanisms of action appears to be more effective than combining drugs with similar mechanisms of action.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

No currently marketed AEDs have been extensively studied in PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy and there is no established treatment strategy for girls diagnosed with PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Patients may respond well to treatment with [[levetiracetam]] and in cases of drug resistance, [[stiripentol]], which is not approved in the U.S. but is available through the FDA Expanded Access IND process.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===Urgent care===
At the hospital, physicians follow standard protocol for managing seizures. Cluster seizures are generally controlled by&amp;nbsp;[[benzodiazepines]]&amp;nbsp;such as&amp;nbsp;[[diazepam]],&amp;nbsp;[[midazolam]],&amp;nbsp;[[lorazepam]]&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;[[clonazepam]]. The use of&amp;nbsp;[[Oxygen therapy|oxygen]] is recommended in the United States, but in Europe it is only recommended in cases of prolonged epileptic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/epilepsy/detail_epilepsy.htm|title=The Epilepsies and Seizures: Hope Through Research|website=www.ninds.nih.gov|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
The National Institute of Health Office and Rare Disease Research characterizes PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy as a rare disorder.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Rare diseases, by definition, are diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Since the mutation associated with PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy was only recently identified in 2008, the true incidence of the disease is generally unknown.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Although formal epidemiologic data is not available, results from diagnostic screening indicates that approximately 1 out of 10 girls who have seizure onset before five years of age may have PCDH19 gene mutations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Additionally, PCDH19 screening of several large cohorts of females with early onset febrile-related epilepsy has resulted in a rate of approximately 10% of mutation-positive individuals.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==History==

Juberg and Hellman originally described the disorder in 1971 in the&amp;nbsp;''[[Journal of Pediatrics]]'', where they reported a family in which 15 female relatives, who were related either as sisters or first cousins through their fathers, had early onset seizures with cognitive impairments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; In subsequent peer-reviewed literature, the disorder was referred to as “epilepsy and mental retardation limited to female” (EFMR), and later called EIEE9 or Juberg-Hellman Syndrome.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The&amp;nbsp;[[syndrome]]&amp;nbsp;in this family was characterized by the occurrence of childhood seizures. Some of the girls showed developmental regression with intellectual disabilities that ranged from mild to profound. The disorder has an unusual inheritance pattern. It is considered&amp;nbsp;[[X-linked]]&amp;nbsp;dominant with male carriers. Women and men with the affected gene can transmit the disease. The men expressed a normal&amp;nbsp;[[phenotype]]. The disorder was shown to be linked to&amp;nbsp;[[mutation]]s&amp;nbsp;via Xq22&amp;nbsp;[[microsatellite]]&amp;nbsp;markers.[[Epilepsy-intellectual disability in females#cite note-23|&lt;sup&gt;[nb 4]&lt;/sup&gt;]][[Epilepsy-intellectual disability in females#cite note-scheffer-4|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Due to the apparent female-limited expression of the condition, it eluded genetic mapping until 1997, which is when Ryan et al. mapped the responsible gene to the X-chromosome.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tan|first=Chuan|last2=Shard|first2=Chloe|last3=Ranieri|first3=Enzo|last4=Hynes|first4=Kim|last5=Pham|first5=Duyen H.|last6=Leach|first6=Damian|last7=Buchanan|first7=Grant|last8=Corbett|first8=Mark|last9=Shoubridge|first9=Cheryl|date=2015-09-15|title=Mutations of protocadherin 19 in female epilepsy (PCDH19-FE) lead to allopregnanolone deficiency|url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/18/5250|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|language=en|volume=24|issue=18|pages=5250–5259|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddv245|issn=0964-6906|pmid=26123493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven years after the success of Ryan et al., in 2008, systematic sequencing of X-chromosome exons in seven large families diagnosed with EFMR revealed PCDH19 gene mutations as the cause. This led to a shift in describing EMFR as PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scheffer" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The discovery of the PCDH19 gene mutation led to the development of a genetic test for PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy.

In 2009, Depienne et al. identified a male with a [[Mosaic (genetics)|somatic mosaicism]] for PCDH19 gene deletion and a Dravet-like seizure disorder.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Terracciano|first=Alessandra|last2=Trivisano|first2=Marina|last3=Cusmai|first3=Raffaella|last4=De Palma|first4=Luca|last5=Fusco|first5=Lucia|last6=Compagnucci|first6=Claudia|last7=Bertini|first7=Enrico|last8=Vigevano|first8=Federico|last9=Specchio|first9=Nicola|date=2016-03-01|title=PCDH19-related epilepsy in two mosaic male patients|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/epi.13295/abstract|journal=Epilepsia|language=en|volume=57|issue=3|pages=e51–e55|doi=10.1111/epi.13295|issn=1528-1167|pmid=26765483}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thiffault|first=Isabelle|last2=Farrow|first2=Emily|last3=Smith|first3=Laurie|last4=Lowry|first4=Jennifer|last5=Zellmer|first5=Lee|last6=Black|first6=Benjamin|last7=Abdelmoity|first7=Ahmed|last8=Miller|first8=Neil|last9=Soden|first9=Sarah|date=2016-06-01|title=PCDH19-related epileptic encephalopathy in a male mosaic for a truncating variant|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajmg.a.37617/abstract|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A|language=en|volume=170|issue=6|pages=1585–1589|doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.37617|issn=1552-4833|pmid=27016041}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings resulted in Depienne et al. to identify PCDH19 mutations in patients with SCN1A negative Dravet syndrome.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This led to additional reports of PCDH19 positive patients, which broadened the clinical spectrum of the disorder.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

== Society and culture==
Caregivers of individuals living with PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy may seek support and information from a variety of resources, including the PCDH19 Alliance, The Cute Syndrome Foundation, and Insieme per la Ricerca PCDH19 - ONLUS (Italy).

The PCDH19 World Conference, which is organized by Insieme per la Ricerca PCDH19 - ONLUS, occurs every other year, in odd years, in Rome, Italy. In alternating years, the PCDH19 Epilepsy Professional and Family Symposium is hosted in San Francisco, California.

In 2014, the PCDH19 Registry was established, which is organized and funded by the PCHD19 Alliance, Boston Children’s Hospital and the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

International PCDH19 Awareness Day is held annually on November 9.

==Research==

=== Registry ===
A PCDH19 Registry was established by the PCDH19 Alliance, [[Boston Children's Hospital|Boston Children’s Hospital]] and the [[University of California, San Francisco]], to provide a meaningful resource of patients with PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy and to better understand the epilepsy and behavioral aspects associated with the mutation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.childrenshospital.org/centers-and-services/epilepsy-genetics-program/research-and-innovation|title=Epilepsy Genetics Program {{!}} Research and Innovation&amp;nbsp;{{!}}&amp;nbsp;Boston Children's Hospital|last=2013|first=Boston Childrens Hospital|website=www.childrenshospital.org|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel associations European families are sponsoring basic and applied research in an Australian team and researching in other projects with the aim of finding a drug target for epilepsy PCDH19.&lt;sup&gt;[28]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Basic research ===
Ann Poduri and Alex Rotenberg at Boston Children’s Hospital are currently conducting PCDH19-related epilepsy in zebrafish.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecutesyndrome.com/research.html|title=PCDH19 and SCN8A Research Funded By The Cute Syndrome|website=The Cute Syndrome Foundation: Funding PCDH19 Epilepsy&amp;nbsp;&amp;&lt;br /&gt;SCN8A&amp;nbsp;Epilepsy&amp;nbsp;Research|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research, which is funded by grants from The Cute Syndrome Foundation and The Richard A. and Susan F. Smith President’s Innovation Fund of Boston Children’s Hospital, hopes to establish an animal model of PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy, which can then be used to screen potential therapeutics and treatments.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Dr. Jack Parent and his research team at the [[University of Michigan]] are currently conducting research to understand how PCHD19 gene mutations leads to disruptions in brain development.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pcdh19info.org/research/|title=RESEARCH - PCDH19 Alliance|website=PCDH19 Alliance|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecutesyndrome.com/news.html|title=News about PCDH19 Epilepsy and SCN8A Epilepsy and The Cute Syndrome Foundation|website=The Cute Syndrome Foundation: Funding PCDH19 Epilepsy&amp;nbsp;&amp;&lt;br /&gt;SCN8A&amp;nbsp;Epilepsy&amp;nbsp;Research|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research, funded by a grant from The Cute Syndrome Foundation, is seeking to reprogram [[fibroblast]]s from subjects with the PCHD19 mutation into [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s (iPSC), which will then be used to make patient-specific neurons in a cell culture environment.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"/&gt; The researchers are looking to see if these patient-specific neurons produce epileptic-like activity, as well as to discover the mechanism underlying the seizures and cognitive dysfunction associated with PCDH19 mutations.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"/&gt;

The Cute Syndrome Foundation and Insieme per la Ricerca PCDH19 - ONLUS recently awarded a two-year research grant to Drs. Maria Passafaro and Elena Battaglioli, from the CNR Neuroscience Institute and [[University of Milan]]o, respectively.&lt;ref name=":18"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcdh19research.org/ENG/news_iniziative_ENG.html|title=Insieme per la Ricerca PCDH19 – ONLUS|last=|first=|date=|website=www.pcdh19research.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers plan to unravel the molecular mechanism of PCDH19 gene mutations.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  The proposal also includes using AON exon skipping, which would be the first use of this method in epilepsy.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Gene therapy ===
It was assumed that all encephalopathies or cognitive impairments were irreversible, but an experiment with mice showed that is not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guy|first=Jacky|last2=Gan|first2=Jian|last3=Selfridge|first3=Jim|last4=Cobb|first4=Stuart|last5=Bird|first5=Adrian|date=2007-02-23|title=Reversal of Neurological Defects in a Mouse Model of Rett Syndrome|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/315/5815/1143|journal=Science|language=en|volume=315|issue=5815|pages=1143–1147|doi=10.1126/science.1138389|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17289941}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;In that experiment, MECP2 protein was blocked; males died, and females developed Rett syndrome (seizures, cognitive and psychomotor problems, respiratory problems, etc.) When the researchers reversed the situation and let the MECP2 protein work properly, the mice recovered.&lt;sup&gt;[''[[Wikipedia:Please clarify|clarification needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;This research revolutionized understanding regarding genetic syndromes that present with neurological impairment or intellectual disabilities.

=== Therapeutics ===
In February 2015, Marinus Pharmaceuticals commenced a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of [[ganaxolone]], a synthetic analog of the [[Neuroactive steroid|neurosteroid]] [[allopregnanolone]], for the treatment of uncontrolled seizure in pediatric females with PCDH19 gene-related epilepsy.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ir.marinuspharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=894284|title=Marinus Pharmaceuticals Initiates Clinical Trial With Ganaxolone in PCDH19 Female Pediatric Epilepsy (NASDAQ:MRNS)|website=ir.marinuspharma.com|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02358538?term=NCT02358538&amp;rank=1|title=A Multicenter, Open-Label Proof-of-Concept Trial of Ganaxolone in Children With PCDH19 Female Pediatric Epilepsy - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov|website=clinicaltrials.gov|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study will enroll up to 10 female pediatric patients, between the ages of 2 and 10 years old, with a confirmed PCDH19 genetic mutation.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; The primary endpoint of the study is percent change in seizure frequency per 28 days relative to baseline.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16779">'''Feminist health centers''' are independent, not-for-profit, alternative medical facilities that primarily provide [[gynecology|gynecological]] health care. Many [[feminism|feminist]] health centers were founded in the 1970s as part of the [[Women_in_medicine#Women.27s_health_movement_in_the_1970s|women's health movement]] in the United States. These centers were founded with the purposes of challenging the [[medicalization]] of health care, providing an alternative to mainstream health facilities, and increasing access to gynecological information and services for all women, regardless of race, class, sexual orientation, or insurance coverage.

==History==
Feminist health centers emerged as a part of the women’s health movement in the 1970s. The women’s health movement grew out of social movements of the 1960s, including the [[New Left]], the [[Civil Rights Movement]], and dissatisfaction with the delivery of women’s health care. Members of the women’s health movement saw health care as a highly politicized issue and wanted to challenge the [[racism]], [[class discrimination|classism]], and [[sexism]] they saw in professionalized medicine.

In her history of the women’s health movement, feminist anthropologist [[Sandra Morgen]] notes, “Feminist clinics never accounted for the majority of women’s health movement groups. But […] they were vanguard organizations that were fertile soils for many of the movement’s innovations.”&lt;ref&gt;Morgen, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist health centers were intended as a challenge to the way mainstream health care was delivered. Many in the women's health movement embraced [[self-help]], from reading the seminal text ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'' to performing illegal abortions as part of the infamous [[Jane Collective]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://womensenews.org/story/health/040504/our-bodies-ourselves-turns-35-today |title= Our Bodies, Ourselves Turns 35 Today |author= Molly M. Ginty |date= May 4, 2004 |publisher= Women's eNews |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}

Times News Service |date=November 18, 1979 |title=Feminist health center under fire  |pages=5-D |publisher= Wilmington Star-News |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=s9ZQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ORMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3641,3944318&amp;dq=feminist+health+centers&amp;hl=en |accessdate= May 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federation of Feminist Women's Health Centers, an organized, nationwide group of feminist health centers, published self-help books such as "How To Stay Out of the Gynecologist's Office." These books went further than expanding women's knowledge about their own bodies by additionally enabling women to treat some common infections, such as UTIs and yeast infections, with home remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McCormack |first1=Patricia |date= January 26, 1982 |title= Feminists Authors Offer Self-Help Health Books |pages=14 |publisher=Schenectady Gazette |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cmxGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=f-kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1196,2515596&amp;dq=feminist+health+centers&amp;hl=en |accessdate= May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health activists decried the “doctor knows best” model of care, noting that the [[professionalization]] of medical care had excluded women as both providers and consumers of medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.feministcenter.org/about-fwhc/mission-history-values |title= History, Mission, and Values |publisher= Feminist Women's Health Center of Atlanta, GA |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ginty.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Kline and Morgen.&lt;/ref&gt;

The body of scholarship that emerged from the women’s health movement underscores the fact that, historically, women had been health care providers for millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/6355/1/Medical-History--Women-in-Medicine.html |title= Medical History -- Women in Medicine |author= Albert S. Lyons |publisher= Health Guidance |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not until the mid-nineteenth century that women were pushed out of medicine by increasingly professionalized health care delivery in the United States. Women were further excluded from medicine through the doctor-patient relationship, by which women were presented with minimal information or choices about the health care they received, and even their own bodies. Feminist health activists argued that the drape used by gynecologists during [[pelvic exam]]s symbolized a veil of secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;Morgen, 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout their early years, feminist health centers struggled to uphold their ideals while simultaneously meeting the needs of their clients and their employees. Feminist scholars [[Myra Marx Ferree]] and Patricia Yancey Martin argue, “Feminist organizations are an amalgam, a blend of institutionalized and social movement practices. […] A movement organization is not a contradiction in terms, but it is, by definition, in tension. It is always a compromise between the ideals by which it judges itself and the realities of its daily practices.” &lt;ref&gt;Ferree and Martin, 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Many clinics realized that change was necessary for their continued operations – for example, many feminist health centers began as [[collective]]s.  While many activists believed that collective decision-making promoted [[egalitarianism]], most clinics found that reaching a consensus took too much time, especially as organizations grew to include more personnel and began to serve more clients.&lt;ref&gt;Morgen, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

While most clinics found ways to resolve, or at least maintain, the tension between ideals and practice, some refused to compromise.  The Women’s Community Health Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts is an example of a clinic that maintained an unyielding commitment to its political values. The women who ran the center were unwilling to rely on outside funding, feeling that outside support could coopt their mission.&lt;ref&gt;Morgen, 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, their refusal to seek external financial support led to a short shelf life for the clinic – the Women’s Community Health Center was only open from 1974 until 1981, and was plagued by financial troubles and internal disputes throughout its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch00351 |title= Women's Community Health Center (Cambridge, Mass.) Records, 1953-1987 (inclusive), 1973-1981 (bulk): A Finding Aid |author= Paula K. Aloisio |date= March 2005 |publisher=Women's Community Health Center |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to facing internal conflicts, many feminist health centers faced external opposition to their existence. The desire of feminist health activists to alter the delivery of health services alienated many physicians, who saw feminist health centers as offering both criticism and competition to their mainstream practices. Most feminist health centers did cooperate with the medical establishment somewhat, due in large part to state laws requiring physicians to be a part of clinic staff or to perform abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_OAL.pdf |title=State Policies in Brief: An Overview of Abortion Laws  |date=May 1, 2012 |publisher=Guttmacher Institute |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many feminist health centers initially sought female doctors to join their ranks, the exclusion of women from medical schools meant that most feminist health centers had male physicians on staff.&lt;ref&gt;Morgen, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all clinics had a cooperative relationship with medical professionals. The Tallahassee Feminist Women's Health Center had to recruit out-of-town doctors to perform abortions at their clinic because the center's founder had given a newspaper interview criticizing the local medical community, thereby causing their staff physicians to quit and antagonizing other area doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=s9ZQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ORMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3641,3944318&amp;dq=feminist+health+centers&amp;hl=en |title= Feminist health center under fire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist health centers also faced (and continue to face) frequent attacks, criticism, and protests, primarily relating to their role as abortion providers.

==Differences from mainstream health clinics==

Although most feminist health centers are abortion providers, not all of them are. For example, the Chicago Women’s Health Center has remained committed to the principles of self-help and informed consent, and strives to provide care to underserved populations, but does not provide abortion care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagowomenshealthcenter.org/about-page/womens-health-movement |title=Women's Health Movement |publisher= Chicago Women's Health Center |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, not all abortion providers are feminist health centers – in fact, most are not, just as most providers of women’s health care are not feminist.

The women’s health movement has succeeded in changing mainstream health care in several ways, including mandating the practice of informed consent and implementing the discussion of multiple treatment options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womenshealthspecialists.org/about-us/womens-health-movement |title= Women's Health Movement |author= Cindy Pearson |publisher= Women's Health Specialists |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2007/01/02/life-support-for-feminist-health-care |title=Life Support for Feminist Health Care? |author= Amie Newman |date= January 2, 2007 |publisher= RH Reality Check |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some practices that were once deemed radical and found primarily in feminist health centers have become routine in medical facilities throughout the country. However, feminist health centers remain distinct from their mainstream counterparts in important ways.

Feminist health centers continue to see health care as a political issue – they believe that improvements in women’s health come not only from advances in medicine, but also from society making inroads against injustice and inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Morgen, 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist health centers will not shy away from controversial topics, including abortion, which most centers are committed to providing as a critical component of comprehensive women’s health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2009/12/21/interview-feminist-abortion-network |title= An Interview With the Feminist Abortion Network |author= Amie Newman |date=December 21, 2009 |publisher=RH Reality Check |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgen, 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, feminist health centers maintain a commitment to reaching underserved populations that is largely unseen in other medical providers. Feminist health centers provide services to minorities, immigrants, refugees, the LGBTQI community, and the uninsured.&lt;ref&gt;Morgen, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; To meet these needs, clinics usually offer sliding scale or reduced fees for services, and offer free health care to those who cannot afford to pay. In addition to reaching these oft-neglected populations, feminist health centers try to provide sensitive and respectful health care, recognizing health disparities in underserved groups and tailoring their services to the needs of the communities in which they operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/282627/feminist-health-center-fills-key-role?SESSf6487623b7d29dbfe3ab1dd2e7e7712f=google|title= Feminist Health Center fills a key role |author= Dalia Vidunas |date= September 28, 2011 |publisher=Concord Monitor |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}

'''Foldsjøen''' is a [[reservoir]] in the municipalities of [[Surnadal]] and [[Rindal]] in [[Møre og Romsdal]] counties, [[Norway]]. The lake is [[dam]]med from the [[Folda (Rindal)|Folda River]] and the water is used in the Trollheim power station. Slightly more elevated and directly to the south is the [[Gråsjøen]] reservoir, which is also behind a hydro-power dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yr.no/place/Norway/M%C3%B8re_og_Romsdal/Rindal/Foldsj%C3%B8en/|title=Foldsjøen|publisher=[[yr.no]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The review stated that a Forensic Mental Health Services Network Managed Care Network should be established to address fragmentation across the Forensic Mental Health Estate, to overview the processes for determining the most effective care for mentally disordered offenders, consider wider issues surrounding patient pathways, and align strategic planning across Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forensicnetwork.scot.nhs.uk/documents/ian_gordon.pdf Gordon, 2003 - The Response to Consultation Paper]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/report.aspx?r=4438&amp;mode=pdf Scottish Parliament, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
Under the auspices of the [[Scottish National Health Service]], the Network is multi-agency, multi-disciplinary and multi-regional, linked with [[Scottish Prison Service]], Social Work Services, and [[Police]], [[Criminal Justice]] agencies, the Scottish Government and [[Carers]], amongst others.  The [[Scottish Government|Scottish Ministers]] invited Andreana Adamson, Chief Executive of the State Hospital, to lead on its development:
:"The therapeutic aim of inpatient forensic services is to address violent, aggressive and offending behaviour. It is vital that patients are treated in accommodation appropriate to their needs in an environment that supports their rehabilitation."(Adamson, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/focus/display.var.2060780.0.Carstairs_changing_a_mindset.php |last=Adams |first=Lucy |title=Carstairs: changing a mindset |date=2008-02-21 |publisher=The Herald Focus |accessdate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim for the Network is to bring a pan-dimensional SCOTLAND approach to the planning, development and rehabilitation pathways for forensic mental health services. The Network host several professional groups, commission short life working groups to tackle specific concerns, and facilitate clinical forums on a variety of key topic areas. The Network take a regional approach in order to achieve their aims of addressing fragmentation across forensic mental health services and representatives from NHS regions sit on an advisory committee and board to provide guidance and input into national approaches.

'''Game''' or '''quarry''' is any [[animal]] [[hunting|hunted]] for [[trophy hunting|sport]] or for [[meat|food]], and the meat of those animals. The type and range of animals hunted for food varies in different parts of the world.
{{TOC limit|3}}

== Description ==
Game or quarry is any [[animal]] [[hunting|hunted]] for its [[meat]] or for [[trophy hunting|sport]].

The term ''game'' arises in [[medieval hunting]] terminology by the late 13th century and is particular to English, the word derived from the generic Old English ''gamen'' (Germanic ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/gamaną|*gamanan]]'') "joy, amusement, sport, merriment".

''Quarry'' in the generic meaning is early modern (first recorded 1610), in the more specific sense "bird targeted in falconry" late 14th and 15th centuries as ''quirre'' "entrails of deer placed on the hide and given to the hunting-dogs as a reward",  from [[Old French]] ''cuiriee'' "spoil, quarry" (ultimately Latin ''[[:wikt:corium|corium]]'' "hide"), but influenced by ''corée'' "viscera, entrails" (Late Latin ''[[:wikt:corata|*corata]]'' "entrails", from ''cor'' "heart").

Unlike many commercial meat products, the meat from wild animals (especially herbivores), when prepared correctly, is very healthy and nutrient-dense.  This is primarily due to the animal's natural diet and healthy lifestyle.  It can be virtually assured that the animal was never bred or raised in unsanitary conditions, fed a diet of grain, confined to a cage, or injected with any artificial hormones.  On the other hand, the act of killing the animal for its meat is more apparent and can only be done within reasonable regulations to ensure continuity of the animal species and its meat resource.

Small game includes small animals, such as [[rabbit]]s, [[pheasant]]s, [[geese]] or [[duck]]s. Large game includes animals like [[deer]], [[moose]], and [[bear]]. ''[[Big-game hunting|Big game]]'' is a term sometimes used interchangeably with large game although in other contexts it refers to large, typically African, [[mammal]]s (specifically "[[big five game]]" or "dangerous game") which are hunted mainly for trophies in [[safari]]s.

== By continent and region ==
The type and range of animals hunted for food varies in different parts of the world. This is influenced by [[climate]], animal diversity, local taste and locally accepted views about what can or cannot be legitimately hunted. Sometimes a distinction is also made between varieties and species of a particular animal, such as [[wild turkey]] and [[domestic turkey]]. Fish caught for sport are referred to as [[game fish]]. The flesh of the animal, when butchered for consumption is often described as having a "gamey" flavour. This difference in taste can be attributed to the wild diet of the animal, which usually results in a lower fat content compared to domestic farm raised animals.

In some countries, game is classified, including legal classification with respect to licences required, as either "small game" or "large game". A single small game licence may cover all small game species and be subject to yearly [[bag limits]]. Large game are often subject to individual licensing where a separate licence is required for each individual animal taken (tags).

=== Africa ===
{{See also|Elephant meat}}
[[File:American big-game hunting; (1901) (18117144345).jpg|alt=|thumb|Big game hunting]]
In some parts of [[Africa]], wild animals hunted for their meat are called [[bushmeat]]; see that article for more detailed information on how this operates within the economy (for personal consumption and for money) and the law (including [[overexploitation]] and illegal imports). Animals hunted for bushmeat include, but are not limited to:
* Various species of [[antelope]], including [[duiker]]s
* Various species of [[primates]] like [[mandrill]]s or [[gorilla]]s
* [[Rodent]]s like [[porcupine]]s or [[cane rat]]s
Some of these animals are endangered or otherwise protected, and thus it is illegal to hunt them.

In Africa, animals hunted for their pelts or [[ivory]] are sometimes referred to as the ''big game''.

==== South Africa ====
[[South Africa]] is a famous destination for game hunting, with its large biodiversity and therefore rather impressive variety of game species. Many creatures have returned to former areas from which they were once taken from as a result of being killed for big game hunting. Species of [[Animal|creatures]] commonly hunted include:
{{div col|colwidth=20em}}
* [[Springbok]]
* [[Impala]]
* [[Steenbok]]
* [[Oribi]]
* [[Bushbuck]]
* [[Nyala]]
* [[Greater Kudu]]
* [[Common Eland]]
* [[Blue Wildebeest]]
* [[Black Wildebeest]]
* [[Blesbok]]
* [[Bontebok]]
* [[Sable Antelope]]
* [[Roan Antelope]]
* [[Gemsbok]]
* [[Giraffe]]
* [[Cape Buffalo]]
* [[Southern White Rhinoceros]]
* [[Plains Zebra]]
{{div col end}}

South Africa also has 62 species of gamebirds, including guineafowl, francolin, partridge, quail, sandgrouse, duck, geese, snipe, bustard and korhaan. Some of these species are no longer hunted, and of the 44 indigenous gamebirds that can potentially be utilised in South Africa, only three, namely the [[yellow-throated sandgrouse]], [[Delegorgue's pigeon]] and the [[African pygmy goose]] warrant special protection. Of the remaining 41 species, 24 have shown an increase in numbers and distribution range in the last 25 years or so. The status of 14 species appears unchanged, with insufficient information being available for the remaining three species. The gamebirds of South Africa where the population status in 2005 was secure or growing are listed below:
{{div col|colwidth=20em}}
* [[Helmeted guineafowl]]
* [[Greywing partridge]]
* [[Redwing partridge]]

[[File:Game birds Borough Market.jpg|thumb|Game birds at [[Borough Market]] in [[London]]]]
In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] game is defined in [[law]] by the [[Game Act 1831]]. It is illegal to shoot game on Sundays or at night.  Other (non-game birds) that are hunted for food in the UK are specified under the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]]. UK law defines game as including:
* [[Black grouse]] (No longer hunted due to decline in numbers)
* [[Red grouse]]
* [[European hare|Brown hare]]
* [[rock ptarmigan|Ptarmigan]]
* [[Grey partridge]] and [[red-legged partridge]]
* [[Common pheasant]]

[[Deer]] are not included in the definition, but similar controls provided to those in the Game Act apply to deer (from the [[Deer Act 1991]]). Deer hunted in the UK are:
* [[Red deer]]
* [[Roe deer]]
* [[Fallow deer]]
* [[Sika deer]]
* [[Muntjac deer]]
* [[Chinese water deer]]
* and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] of these deer

Other animals which are hunted in the UK include:
* [[Duck]], including [[mallard]], [[tufted duck]], [[Common teal|teal]], [[Northern pintail|pintail]] and [[Common pochard|pochard]]
* [[Goose]], including [[greylag goose]], [[Canada goose]], [[pink-footed goose]] and in [[England]] and [[Wales]] [[white-fronted goose]]
* [[Woodpigeon]]
* [[Eurasian woodcock|Woodcock]]
* [[Common snipe|Snipe]]
* [[Rabbit]]
* [[Eurasian golden plover|Golden plover]]

[[Capercaillie]] are not currently hunted in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] because of a recent decline in numbers and conservation projects towards their recovery. The ban is generally considered voluntary on private lands, and few birds live away from [[RSPB]] or [[Forestry Commission]] land allegedly.

== Preparation ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2007}}
[[File:Attributed to Frans Hals, 1625-1630, A Kitchen Interior with a Maid and a Lady Preparing Game.jpg|thumb|A kitchen interior with a maid and a lady preparing game, c. 1600]]
Game meat is typically taken from a wild animal that has been shot with a gun or bow.  Hunters must be absolutely certain of their target before shooting and should make every effort to get the animal down as quickly and painlessly as possible.  Once obtained, game meat{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} must be processed. The method of processing varies by game species and size. Small game and fowl may simply be carried home to be [[butcher]]ed. Large game such as deer is quickly [[field dressing (hunting)|field-dressed]] by removing the [[viscera]] in the field, while very large animals like moose may be partially butchered in the field because of the difficulty of removing them intact from their habitat. Commercial processors often handle deer taken during deer seasons, sometimes even at supermarket meat counters. Otherwise the hunter handles butchering. The carcass is kept cool to minimize spoilage.

Traditionally, game meat used to be hung until "high", i.e. approaching a state of decomposition. The term "gamey" / "gamy" refers to this usually desirable taste (''haut goût'').{{citation needed|reason=Certain meats are referred to as tasting gamey even when fresh.|date=September 2016}} However, this adds to the risk of contamination. Small game can be processed essentially intact, after gutting and skinning or defeathering (by species). Small animals are ready for cooking, although they may be disjointed first. Large game must be processed by techniques commonly practiced by commercial butchers.

== Cooking ==
{{Cookbook|Game}}
Generally game is cooked in the same ways as farmed meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametoeat.co.uk/index.php |title=Game-to-Eat |date=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because some game meat is leaner than store-bought beef, overcooking is a common mishap which can be avoided if properly prepared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exoticmeatsales.com/product-info-.html |title=About Game Meat |date=2007-05-19 |accessdate=2011-10-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519220238/http://exoticmeatsales.com/product-info-.html |archivedate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highlandgame.com/ Venison Direct to Your Door] Highland Game&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes [[Grilling|grilled]] or cooked longer or by [[slow cooking]] or moist-heat methods to make it more tender, since some game tends to be tougher than farm-raised meat. Other methods of tenderizing include [[marinade|marinating]] as in the dish [[Hasenpfeffer]], cooking in a [[game pie]] or as a stew such as [[Burgoo]].

== Safety ==
The [[Norwegian Food Safety Authority]] considers that children, pregnant women, fertile-aged women, and people with high blood pressure should not consume game shot with lead-based ammunition more than once a month. Children who often eat such game might develop a slightly lower IQ, as lead influences the development of the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/trondelag/barn-far-lavere-iq-av-storviltkjott-1.11209475|title=Mattilsynet: – Barn kan få lavere IQ av storvilt|publisher=NRK.no|language=Norwegian|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Gianluca Bezzina was born in 1989 in [[Qrendi]], [[Malta]]. He is the third of seven siblings. He comes from a very musical family. His sister Dorothy Bezzina was also a participant in the 2013 Malta Eurovision Song Contest "[http://tvm.com.mt/eurovision/videos-and-bios/Dorothy Bezzina-bezzina/ Starting From The End]".

These songs were very popular. Gianluca's maternal grandfather, the late Gaetano Buttigieg of [[Marsa, Malta|Marsa]], Malta, better known as Gaetano Kanta, was also a very well-known figure in Malta. He was one of the pioneers in the use of the Maltese Language in pop music.

He stated his personal religious and conservative views by saying: “It really bothers me that the [[Roman Catholicism|values and morals]] that have been safeguarded for several years [[History of human rights|are now changing]] drastically. The [[Maltese people|mentality has become more liberal]], and nowadays, whenever an individual feels something is right, he seeks to justify it by [[same-sex marriage|changing a law]] ... [[religious morality|Morals]] which have been [[doctrine|enshrined]] in everyday life are being [[Christian views on marriage|redefined and reinvented]], and [[Western countries|countries across the world]] are [[LGBT rights in Malta|legislating in favour of these ‘rights’]] to get more votes.”&lt;ref&gt;Malta Today. 24 May 2015.

'''Happy life expectancy''' ('''HLE''') is calculated by multiplying [[life expectancy]] by a happiness index. The first uses life expectancy at birth. The happiness index is the average appreciation of life (with a value from 0 to 1) from the [[World Database of Happiness|world databases of happiness]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.eur.nl/fsw/research/veenhoven/Pub1990s/96b-full.pdf|title=Happy Life-Expectancy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quality of life indexes==
Arguably, one of the most widely valued social indicators is happiness. Social researchers often use the term [[quality of life|quality of life (QOL)]] to describe what is commonly called "happiness". One of the leading pioneers of happiness research is  Ruut Veenhoven (see [[#References]])), emeritus-professor of 'social conditions for human happiness' at [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]] in the Netherlands. He is also one of the chief critics of one of the most widely used QOL indexes, the Human Development Index (HDI) published by [[Human development index|the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)]]. His 1996 paper "Happy Life-Expectancy, A Comprehensive Measure of Quality-of Life in Nations", which appeared in the journal ''Social Indicators Research'', proposed an alternative QOL index, called happy life expectancy (HLE). HLE may be a better indicator of happiness as it relies on subjective measures of happiness, as opposed to the largely materialistic measures that go into creating the HDI.

===HDI===
{{main|Human Development Index}}
The HDI measures average achievements based on three dimensions: 1. [[life-span]], as measured by life expectancy at birth. 2. Education, as measured by the adult literacy rate and average number of years spent in school in adults over 25 3. Standard of living, as measured by GDP per capita in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms in US dollars. Veenhoven is critical of the HDI because it measures QOL in terms of input, while never addressing to what extent these input provisions are in fact good for people. Furthermore, the HDI is a rather generalized index that gives a simple average of the three-dimensional achievements mentioned above, which can be expressed in this formula:
::HDI = 1/3 (life expectancy index) + 1/3 (education index) + 1/3 (GDP index).

One can see that highly developed nations can have high life expectancy rates if those nations rely on excessive measures to keep a person alive. The HDI however does not account for the HOW of a particular dimension, but merely the NET RESULT. In the HDI, a hypothetical nation that had a life expectancy of say 100, would score very highly, regardless of how this nation sustained life. Using the actual HDI for 2004, [[economic history of China|China]] ranked number 22 out of 177 nations included in the HDI, right behind Germany (number 21 in the 2004 HDI). One of the reasons China ranked so highly was because its GDP was very high, although its education index and life expectancy are low when compared to other nations, such as the United States, Japan, or Germany.

===HLE===
"The most fundamental problem with this generation of QOL's," writes Veenhoven, "... is that they do not distinguish between means and ends, nor between societal input and societal output."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; "Economic affluence," he writes, "can hardly be seen as an end in itself."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; HLE does not mix means and ends; but rather, looks at societal output specifically. For example, while current QOL-indices will look at 'healthcare' and 'health' as a single indicator, HLE focuses on the ends, 'health.' This makes HLE a more specific index than traditional QOL-indices. The output centric method of HLE is also one of its shortcomings. Veenhoven says, "it is of little help in daily piecemeal decision making."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; He adds, "Because it is a long term measure, it reacts slowly... it is more analogous to climate change than to the weather."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==HLE, better QOL gauge==
Nonetheless, the HLE may prove to be a better gauge and social tool in accessing what political and social policies can actually make a nation's peoples happier in the long run. HLE uses eight 'nation characteristics' when calculating the 'happy life-expectancy.' These  criteria (which are further individuated into more subjective determinants within the larger category) are: affluence, security, freedom, social equality, cultural climate, social climate, modernization, population pressure. In determining HLE scores, Veenhoven multiplied standard-life expectancy by a happiness index correlated from the eight characteristics listed above. Iceland had the highest HLE observed by Veenhoven's method, while Bulgaria had the lowest. The HLE was not found to be related to unemployment, state welfare, or income equality, nor to religiousness and trust in institutions.

==HDI, top 5 countries==
There are startling differences between the QOL-indexes as reported by Veenhoven's method and those of the dominant QOL, the United Nation's HDI. In 1996 the nations with the highest HDI were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr_1996_en_indicators1.pdf|title=- Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Canada
# USA
# Japan
# Netherlands
# Norway

==HLE, top 5 countries==
In that same year the nations with the highest HLE were:

# Iceland
# Netherlands
# Sweden
# Switzerland
# Austria

The USA ranked 10th on the 1996 HLE scale.

'''Ian Clough''' (1937-1970) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mountaineering|mountaineer]] who was killed on an expedition led by Sir [[Chris Bonington]] to climb the south face of the [[Himalaya]]n [[massif]] [[Annapurna]]. He was later described by Bonnington as "the most modest man I ever had the good luck to climb with" and "the kindest and most selfless partner I ever had."&lt;ref name=Bonington /&gt;

==Climbing career==
Clough was born in the [[Yorkshire]] town of [[Baildon]], near [[Bradford]], and learned to climb on the gritstone edges near his home&lt;ref name=Bonington /&gt;. He did his [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]] in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], hoping to join the [[Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service|RAF Mountain Rescue Service]].&lt;ref name=Bonington /&gt; He supported himself after leaving National Service in various jobs, including running a small climbing-school from the cottage he and his wife Nikki Clough owned at [[Glen Coe]].&lt;ref name=Bonington /&gt; Now one of the best British climbers of his generation, he made many difficult ascents in the [[Alps]], including the first ascent of the Central Pillar of Frêney on [[Mont Blanc]] with [[Don Whillans]], [[Chris Bonington]] and [[Jan Dlugosz (mountaineer)|Jan Długosz]] in 1961 and the first British ascent of the North Face of the [[Eiger]], with Bonington in 1962. He climbed widely in Britain too, publishing a guide to the [[Scottish Highlands]] in 1969, and in 1968 he and the Scottish mountaineer [[Tom Patey]] were the first to climb [[Am Buachaille]], a [[sea stack]] at [[Sandwood Bay]] off the coast of [[Sutherland]].&lt;ref name=Sandwood&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, both Clough and Patey died in separate climbing accidents within five days of one another. When Clough died on 30 May 1970 he would have been unaware Patey had been killed abseiling down another Scottish sea stack on 25 May. His wife [[Nikki Clough]], who later died of cancer, was also a mountaineer and climbed the [[Great north faces of the Alps|north face]] of the [[Matterhorn]] with her husband.

==Expedition to Annapurna==
In 1970, Clough took part in the expedition to [[Annapurna]] led by [[Chris Bonington]], but after the successful ascent of the south face by [[Dougal Haston]] and [[Don Whillans]] he was killed by a falling [[sérac]] ([[ice]]-pillar) on the mountain's lower slopes. Bonington dedicated his book ''Annapurna South Face'' (1971) with the words "To &lt;small&gt;IAN CLOUGH&lt;/small&gt;, who gave so much", and a meeting-place and [[arts]] venue in Clough's hometown of [[Baildon]] was named "Ian Clough Hall" in his honour.

==1999 Memorial==
In November 1999 a brass [[commemorative plaque|plaque]] was erected in Clough's memory at Annapurna base camp. The text of the plaque reads:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
IN MEMORY OF&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
'''IAN CLOUGH'''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;small&gt;MEMBER OF THE 1970 CHRIS BONINGTON EXPEDITION&lt;br/&gt;
ANNAPURNA SOUTH FACE&lt;br/&gt;
KILLED ON DESCENT IN THE ICE FALL&lt;br/&gt;
NOVEMBER 1999
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The plaque was commissioned by [[Kelvin Kent (mountaineer)|Kelvin Kent]], who had been base camp manager on the expedition. An earlier memorial at the site is an [[inscription]] above his grave there, reading "Ian Clough, killed May 30, 1970", cut into rock with an accompanying message in a local language.  The burial site was suggested by Sherpas on the expedition and lies below a rock wall where he gave them climbing lessons.

'''Influenza A virus subtype H5N1''', also known as '''A(H5N1)''' or simply '''H5N1''', is a subtype of the [[influenza A virus]] which can cause illness in [[human]]s and many other animal species.&lt;ref name=ICTV46.0.1&gt;{{cite web | author=[[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] | publisher= | year=2002 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/ICTVdB/46010000.htm | title=46.0.1.

It is [[enzootic]] (maintained in the population) in many bird populations, especially in [[Southeast Asia]]. One strain of HPAI A(H5N1) is [[global spread of H5N1|spreading globally]] after first appearing in Asia. It is [[epizootic]] (an epidemic in nonhumans) and panzootic (affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area), killing tens of millions of birds and spurring the [[culling]] of hundreds of millions of others to stem its spread. Many references to "bird flu" and H5N1 in the popular media refer to this strain.&lt;ref name=KSLi&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Li KS, Guan Y, Wang J, Smith GJ, Xu KM, Duan L, Rahardjo AP, Puthavathana P, Buranathai C, Nguyen TD, Estoepangestie AT, Chaisingh A, Auewarakul P, Long HT, Hanh NT, Webby RJ, Poon LL, Chen H, Shortridge KF, Yuen KY, Webster RG, Peiris JS | title=Genesis of a highly pathogenic and potentially pandemic H5N1 influenza virus in eastern Asia | journal=Nature | year=2004 | pages=209–213 | volume=430 | issue=6996 | pmid=15241415| doi=10.1038/nature02746}} &lt;br/&gt; This was reprinted in 2005:{{ cite book| vauthors = Li KS, Guan Y, Wang J, Smith GJ, Xu KM, Duan L, Rahardjo AP, Puthavathana P, Buranathai C, Nguyen TD, Estoepangestie AT, Chaisingh A, Auewarakul P, Long HT, Hanh NT, Webby RJ, Poon LL, Chen H, Shortridge KF, Yuen KY, Webster RG, Peiris JS| year = 2005| title = The Threat of Pandemic Influenza: Are We Ready?

According to the [[World Health Organization]] and [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], H5N1 [[pathogenicity]] is gradually continuing to rise in endemic areas, but the avian influenza disease situation in [[Poultry farming|farmed birds]] is being held in check by vaccination, and so far there is "no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission" of the virus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/en/ Situation updates - Avian influenza] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819012643/http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/en/ |date=2013-08-19 }}. World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven outbreaks of H5N1 were reported worldwide in June 2008 in five countries (China, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam) compared to 65 outbreaks in June 2006, and 55 in June 2007. The global HPAI situation significantly improved in the first half of 2008, but the FAO reports that imperfect [[disease surveillance]] systems mean that occurrence of the virus remains  underestimated and underreported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/ak783e/ak783e00.pdf |title=October 11, 2010 FAO Avian Influenza Disease Emergency Situation Update 70 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-12-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530231314/http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/ak783e/ak783e00.pdf |archivedate=May 30, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, the WHO announced a total of 630 ''confirmed'' human cases which resulted in the deaths of 375 people since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_20130604CumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105113034/http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_20130604CumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that a highly contagious strain of H5N1, one that might allow airborne transmission between mammals, can be reached in only a few mutations, raising concerns about a [[pandemic]] and [[bioterrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/02/fears-of-bioterrorism-or-an-accidental-release/|title=Fears of bioterrorism or an accidental release|date=16 February 2012|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121115654/http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/02/fears-of-bioterrorism-or-an-accidental-release/|archivedate=21 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HPAI A(H5N1) is considered an avian disease, although there is some evidence of limited human-to-human transmission of the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ungchusak K, Auewarakul P, Dowell SF, etal |title=Probable person-to-person transmission of avian influenza A (H5N1) |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=352 |issue=4 |pages=333–40 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15668219 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa044021 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A risk factor for contracting the virus is handling of infected poultry, but transmission of the virus from infected birds to humans has been characterized as inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ortiz JR, Katz MA, Mahmoud MN, etal |title=Lack of evidence of avian-to-human transmission of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus among poultry workers, [[Kano]], [[Nigeria]], 2006 |journal=J Infect Dis |volume=196 |issue=11 |pages=1685–91 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18008254 |doi=10.1086/522158 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, around 60% of humans known to have been infected with the current Asian strain of HPAI A(H5N1) have died from it, and H5N1 may [[mutation|mutate]] or [[reassortment|reassort]] into a strain capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. In 2003, world-renowned virologist [[Robert G. Webster]] published an article titled "The world is teetering on the edge of a pandemic that could kill a large fraction of the human population" in ''[[American Scientist]]''. He called for adequate resources to fight what he sees as a major world threat to possibly billions of lives.&lt;ref name=webster&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Robert G. Webster|Webster, R.

Due to the high lethality and [[virulence]] of HPAI A(H5N1), its endemic presence, its increasingly large [[host (biology)|host]] reservoir, and its significant ongoing mutations, in 2006, the H5N1 virus has been regarded to be the world's largest current pandemic threat, and billions of dollars are being spent researching H5N1 and preparing for a potential [[influenza pandemic]].&lt;ref name=Rosenthal&gt;{{cite news |title=Is Business Ready for a Flu Pandemic? |first1=E |last1=Rosenthal |first2=K |last2=Bradsher |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/16/business/16bird.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2006-03-16 |accessdate=2012-01-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502150740/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/16/business/16bird.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 12 companies and 17 governments are developing prepandemic [[influenza vaccine]]s in 28 different clinical trials that, if successful, could turn a deadly pandemic infection into a nondeadly one.

In general, humans who catch a humanized influenza A virus (a [[human flu]] virus of type A) usually have symptoms that include [[fever]], [[cough]], [[sore throat]], [[myalgia|muscle aches]], [[conjunctivitis]], and, in severe cases, breathing problems and [[pneumonia]] that may be fatal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The severity of the infection depends in large part on the state of the infected persons' [[immune system]]s and whether they had been exposed to the strain before (in which case they would be partially immune). No one knows if these or other symptoms will be the symptoms of a humanized H5N1 flu.

The avian influenza [[hemagglutinin]] binds alpha 2-3 [[sialic acid]] receptors, while human influenza hemagglutinins bind alpha 2-6 sialic acid receptors.&lt;ref name="Shinya"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shinya K, Ebina M, Yamada S, Ono M, Kasai N, Kawaoka Y |title=Avian flu: influenza virus receptors in the human airway |journal=Nature |volume=440 |issue=7083 |pages=435–6 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16554799 |doi=10.1038/440435a}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means when the H5N1 strain infects humans, it will replicate in the lower respiratory tract, and consequently will cause [[viral pneumonia]].&lt;ref name="Riel" /&gt; There is as yet no human form of H5N1, so all humans who have caught it so far have caught '''avian''' H5N1.

=== In birds ===
Clinical signs of H5N1 in birds range from mild - decrease in egg production, nasal discharge, coughing and sneezing - to severe, including loss of coordination, energy, and appetite; soft-shelled or misshapen eggs; purple discoloration of the wattles, head, eyelids, combs, and hocks; and diarrhea.

Asian lineage HPAI A(H5N1) is divided into two [[antigen]]ic clades. "Clade 1 includes human and bird isolates from [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], and [[Cambodia]] and bird isolates from [[Laos]] and [[Malaysia]]. Clade 2 viruses were first identified in bird isolates from [[China]], [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]] before spreading westward to the [[Middle East]], [[Europe]], and [[Africa]]. The clade 2 viruses have been primarily responsible for human H5N1 infections that have occurred during late 2005 and 2006, according to WHO. Genetic analysis has identified six subclades of clade 2, three of which have a distinct geographic distribution and have been implicated in human infections: [https://web.archive.org/web/20061125120028/http://content.nejm.org/content/vol355/issue21/images/large/03f1.jpeg Map]

A 2007 study focused on the EMA subclade has shed further light on the EMA mutations. "The 36 new isolates reported here greatly expand the amount of whole-genome sequence data available from recent avian influenza (H5N1) isolates. Before our project, GenBank contained only 5 other complete genomes from Europe for the 2004–2006 period, and it contained no whole genomes from the Middle East or northern Africa. Our analysis showed several new findings. First, all European, Middle Eastern, and African samples fall into a clade that is distinct from other contemporary Asian clades, all of which share common ancestry with the original 1997 Hong Kong strain. Phylogenetic trees built on each of the 8 segments show a consistent picture of 3 lineages, as illustrated by the HA tree shown in Figure 1. Two of the clades contain exclusively Vietnamese isolates; the smaller of these, with 5 isolates, we label V1; the larger clade, with 9 isolates, is V2. The remaining 22 isolates all fall into a third, clearly distinct clade, labeled EMA, which comprises samples from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Trees for the other 7 segments display a similar topology, with clades V1, V2, and EMA clearly separated in each case. Analyses of all available complete influenza (H5N1) genomes and of 589 HA sequences placed the EMA clade as distinct from the major clades circulating in People's Republic of China, Indonesia, and Southeast Asia."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/13/5/713.htm CDC] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6CXwfYzDE?url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/13/5/07-0013_article.htm |date=2012-11-29 }} article ''Genome Analysis Linking Recent European and African Influenza (H5N1) Viruses'' EID Journal Home &gt; Volume 13, Number 5–May 2007 Volume 13, Number 5–May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
H5N1 isolates are identified like this actual HPAI A(H5N1) example, '''A/chicken/Nakorn-Patom/Thailand/CU-K2/04(H5N1)''':
*'''A''' stands for the genus of influenza ([[Influenzavirus A|A]], [[Influenzavirus B|B]] or [[Influenzavirus C|C]]).
*'''chicken''' is the animal species the isolate was found in (note: human isolates lack this component term and are thus identified as human isolates by default) 
*'''Nakorn-Patom/Thailand''' is the place this specific virus was isolated
*'''CU-K2''' is the laboratory reference number that identifies it from other influenza viruses isolated at the same place and year
*'''04''' represents the year of isolation 2004
*'''H5''' stands for the fifth of several known types of the protein [[hemagglutinin (influenza)|hemagglutinin]].
*'''N1''' stands for the first of several known types of the protein [[Viral neuraminidase|neuraminidase]].
Other examples include: A/duck/Hong Kong/308/78(H5N3), A/avian/NY/01(H5N2), A/chicken/Mexico/31381-3/94(H5N2), and A/[[shoveler]]/Egypt/03(H5N2).&lt;ref name=Payungporn&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Payungporn S, Chutinimitkul S, Chaisingh A, Damrongwantanapokin S, Nuansrichay B, Pinyochon W, Amonsin A, Donis RO, Theamboonlers A, Poovorawan T | title=Discrimination between Highly Pathogenic and Low Pathogenic H5 Avian Influenza A Viruses | journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases | year=2006 | volume=12 | issue=4 | url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no04/05-1427.htm | pmid=16715581| pages=700–1 | pmc=3294708 | doi=10.3201/eid1204.051427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other avian flu viruses, H5N1 has strains called "highly pathogenic" (HP) and "low-pathogenic" (LP). Avian influenza viruses that cause HPAI are highly [[virulence|virulent]], and mortality rates in infected flocks often approach 100%. LPAI viruses have negligible virulence, but these viruses can serve as progenitors to HPAI viruses. The current strain of H5N1 responsible for the deaths of birds across the world is an HPAI strain; all other current strains of H5N1, including a North American strain that causes no disease at all in any species, are LPAI strains. All HPAI strains identified to date have involved H5 and H7 subtypes. The distinction concerns pathogenicity in poultry, not humans. Normally, a highly pathogenic avian virus is not highly pathogenic to either humans or nonpoultry birds. This current deadly strain of H5N1 is unusual in being deadly to so many species, including some, like domestic cats, never previously susceptible to any [[Orthomyxoviridae|influenza virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Parker |first=Tara |url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/05/the-cat-who-got-swine-flu/ |title=Parker-Pope, Tara.

===Genetic structure and related subtypes===
[[File:Neuraminidase Ribbon Diagram.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''N'' in H5N1 stands for "[[Viral neuraminidase|Neuraminidase]]", the protein depicted in this ribbon diagram.]]
H5N1 is a subtype of the species ''Influenza A virus'' of the ''[[Influenzavirus A]]'' [[genus]] of the ''[[Orthomyxoviridae]]'' family. Like all other influenza A subtypes, the H5N1 subtype is an [[RNA virus]]. It has a segmented [[genome]] of eight negative sense, single-strands of [[RNA]], abbreviated as PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, MP and NS.

HA codes for [[hemagglutinin]], an [[antigen]]ic [[glycoprotein]] found on the surface of the influenza viruses and is responsible for binding the virus to the cell that is being infected. NA codes for [[viral neuraminidase|neuraminidase]], an antigenic glycosylated [[enzyme]] found on the surface of the influenza viruses. It facilitates the release of progeny viruses from infected cells.&lt;ref name=Couch&gt;{{cite book| author = Couch, R.| year = 1996| title = Medical Microbiology| chapter = Chapter 58. Orthomyxoviruses Multiplication| chapterurl = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.3069| editor = Baron, S.| pages = | publisher = The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston| location = Galveston, Texas| isbn = 0-9631172-1-1| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090503145221/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.3069| archivedate = 2009-05-03| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) RNA strands specify the structure of proteins that are most medically relevant as targets for antiviral drugs and [[antibody|antibodies]]. HA and NA are also used as the basis for the naming of the different subtypes of influenza A viruses. This is where the ''H'' and ''N'' come from in ''H5N1''.

Influenza A viruses are significant for their potential for disease and death in humans and other animals. Influenza A virus subtypes that have been confirmed in humans, in order of the number of known human pandemic deaths that they have caused, include:

*[[H1N1]], which caused the [[1918 flu pandemic]] ("Spanish flu") and currently is causing seasonal [[human flu]] and the [[2009 flu pandemic]] ("[[swine flu]]")
*[[H2N2]], which caused "Asian flu"
*[[H3N2]], which caused "Hong Kong flu" and currently causes seasonal human flu
*[[H5N1]], ("[[Avian influenza|bird flu]]"), which is noted for having a strain (Asian-lineage HPAI H5N1) that kills over half the humans it infects, infecting and killing species that were never known to suffer from influenza viruses before (e.g. cats), being unable to be stopped by culling all involved poultry - some think due to being endemic in wild birds, and causing billions of dollars to be spent in flu pandemic preparation and preventiveness
*[[H7N7]], which has unusual [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] potential and killed one person
*[[H1N2]], which is currently endemic in humans and pigs and causes seasonal human flu
*[[H9N2]], which has infected three people
*[[H7N2]], which has infected two people
*[[H7N3]], which has infected two people
*[[H10N7]], which has infected two people
*[[H7N9]], which as of Feb 2014 has infected 309 people, and lead to 70 deaths

===Low pathogenic H5N1===
Low pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (LPAI H5N1) also called "North American" H5N1 commonly occurs in wild birds. In most cases, it causes minor sickness or no noticeable signs of disease in birds. It is not known to affect humans at all. The only concern about it is that it is possible for it to be transmitted to poultry and in poultry mutate into a highly pathogenic strain.

"In the past, there was no requirement for reporting or tracking LPAI H5 or H7 detections in wild birds so states and universities tested wild bird samples independently of USDA. Because of this, the above list of previous detections might not be all inclusive of past LPAI H5N1 detections. However, the World Organization for Animal Health ([[OIE]]) recently changed its requirement of reporting detections of avian influenza. Effective in 2006, all confirmed LPAI H5 and H7 AI subtypes must be reported to the OIE because of their potential to mutate into highly pathogenic strains. Therefore, USDA now tracks these detections in wild birds, backyard flocks, commercial flocks and live bird markets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_1OB?contentidonly=true&amp;contentid=2006/08/0296.xml| publisher=USDA| title=AVIAN INFLUENZA Low Pathogenic H5N1 vs. Highly Pathogenic H5N1 - Latest UPDATE| date=August 17, 2006| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409045125/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_1OB?contentidonly=true&amp;contentid=2006%2F08%2F0296.xml| archivedate=April 9, 2010| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High mutation rate===
Influenza viruses have a relatively high mutation rate that is characteristic of [[RNA virus]]es. The segmentation of its [[genome]] facilitates [[genetic recombination]] by segment [[reassortment]] in hosts infected with two different influenza viruses at the same time.&lt;ref name=Kou/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHOinfluenza/&gt; A previously uncontagious strain may then be able to pass between humans, one of several possible paths to a pandemic.

The ability of various influenza strains to show species-selectivity is largely due to variation in the [[hemagglutinin]] genes. Genetic [[mutation]]s in the hemagglutinin gene that cause single [[amino acid]] substitutions can significantly alter the ability of viral hemagglutinin proteins to bind to [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] on the surface of host cells. Such mutations in avian H5N1 viruses can change virus strains from being inefficient at infecting human cells to being as efficient in causing human infections as more common human influenza virus types.&lt;ref name=Gambaryan&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gambaryan A, Tuzikov A, Pazynina G, Bovin N, Balish A, Klimov A | title=Fatal Evolution of the receptor binding phenotype of influenza A (H5) viruses | journal=Virology | year=2006 | pages=432–438 | volume=344 | issue=2 | pmid=16226289| doi=10.1016/j.virol.2005.08.035}}&lt;/ref&gt; This doesn't mean that one amino acid substitution can cause a pandemic, but it does mean that one amino acid substitution can cause an avian flu virus that is not pathogenic in humans to become pathogenic in humans.

[[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2]] is endemic in pigs in China, and has been detected in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. The dominant strain of annual flu virus in January 2006 was [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2|H3N2]], which is now resistant to the standard antiviral drugs [[amantadine]] and [[rimantadine]]. The possibility of H5N1 and H3N2 exchanging genes through reassortment is a major concern. If a reassortment in H5N1 occurs, it might remain an H5N1 subtype, or it could shift subtypes, as [[Influenza A virus subtype H2N2|H2N2]] did when it evolved into the Hong Kong Flu strain of [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2|H3N2]].

Both the [[Influenza A virus subtype H2N2|H2N2]] and [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2|H3N2]] pandemic strains contained [[avian influenza]] virus RNA segments. "While the pandemic human influenza viruses of 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) clearly arose through reassortment between human and avian viruses, the influenza virus causing the 'Spanish flu' in 1918 appears to be entirely derived from an avian source".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book| author1 = Harder, T.

==Prevention==

===Vaccine===
There are several H5N1 [[vaccine]]s for several of the avian H5N1 varieties, but the continual mutation of H5N1 renders them of limited use to date: while vaccines can sometimes provide cross-protection against related flu strains, the best protection would be from a vaccine specifically produced for any future pandemic flu virus strain. Dr. Daniel Lucey, co-director of the Biohazardous Threats and Emerging Diseases graduate program at [[Georgetown University]] has made this point, "There is no H5N1 [[pandemic]] so there can be no pandemic [[vaccine]]".&lt;ref name=schultz&gt;{{cite news| author=Schultz, J.| url=http://www.upi.com/ConsumerHealthDaily/view.php?StoryID=20051128-054641-9412r| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215192746/http://www.upi.com/ConsumerHealthDaily/view.php?StoryID=20051128-054641-9412r | archivedate=February 15, 2006| title=Bird flu vaccine won't precede pandemic| publisher=United Press International| date=2005-11-28| accessdate=2006-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, "pre-pandemic vaccines" have been created; are being refined and tested; and do have some promise both in furthering research and preparedness for the next pandemic.&lt;ref name=Enserick&gt;{{cite journal| author=Enserick, M.| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/309/5737/996b| title=Avian Influenza:'Pandemic Vaccine' Appears to Protect Only at High Doses| date=2005-08-12| accessdate=2006-04-18| doi=10.1511/2003.2.122| volume=91| journal=American Scientist| page=122| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060228224552/http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/309/5737/996b| archivedate=2006-02-28| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{cite news| author=Walker, K.| url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/upi/index.php?feed=Science&amp;article=UPI-1-20060127-15211900-bc-us-fluwrap.xml| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214044724/https://www.sciencedaily.com/upi/index.php?feed=Science&amp;article=UPI-1-20060127-15211900-bc-us-fluwrap.xml| archivedate=2006-02-14| title= Two H5N1 human vaccine trials to begin| publisher=Science Daily| date=2006-01-27| accessdate=2006-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gao&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gao W, Soloff AC, Lu X, Montecalvo A, Nguyen DC, Matsuoka Y, Robbins PD, Swayne DE, Donis RO, Katz JM, Barratt-Boyes SM, Gambotto A | title=Protection of Mice and Poultry from Lethal H5N1 Avian Influenza Virus through Adenovirus-Based Immunization | journal=J.

"The [[United States]] is collaborating closely with eight international organizations, including the [[WHO|World Health Organization]] (WHO), the [[FAO|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), the [[OIE|World Organization for Animal Health]] (OIE), and 88 foreign governments to address the situation through planning, greater monitoring, and full transparency in reporting and investigating avian influenza occurrences. The United States and these international partners have led global efforts to encourage countries to heighten surveillance for outbreaks in poultry and significant numbers of deaths in migratory birds and to rapidly introduce containment measures. The [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID) and the [[U.S. Department of State]], the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), and [[U.S. Department of Agriculture|Agriculture]] (USDA) are coordinating future international response measures on behalf of the White House with departments and agencies across the federal government".&lt;ref name=USAID&gt;

==Treatment==
{{Further|Flu research}}

There is no highly effective treatment for H5N1 flu, but [[oseltamivir]] (commercially marketed by [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]] as Tamiflu), can sometimes inhibit the influenza virus from spreading inside the user's body. This drug has become a focus for some governments and organizations trying to prepare for a possible H5N1 pandemic.&lt;ref name=Tamiflu&gt;{{cite web| author=Medline Plus | publisher=[[NIH]] | date=2006-01-12 | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/uspdi/500062.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425120952/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/uspdi/500062.html | archivedate=2006-04-25 | title=Oseltamivir  (Systemic) | accessdate=2006-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, 2006, Roche AG announced that a [[stockpile]] of three million treatment courses of [[Tamiflu]] are waiting at the disposal of the [[World Health Organization]] to be used in case of a flu pandemic; separately Roche donated two million courses to the WHO for use in [[developing nations]] that may be affected by such a pandemic but lack the ability to purchase large quantities of the drug.&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], "Tamiflu is Set Aside for WHO," ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', April 20, 2006, page D6.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, WHO expert Hassan al-Bushra has said:
:"Even now, we remain unsure about Tamiflu's real effectiveness. As for a [[vaccine]], work cannot start on it until the emergence of a new virus, and we predict it would take six to nine months to develop it. For the moment, we cannot by any means count on a potential vaccine to prevent the spread of a contagious influenza virus, whose various precedents in the past 90 years have been highly pathogenic".&lt;ref name=IRIN&gt;

Animal and lab studies suggest that Relenza ([[zanamivir]]), which is in the same class of drugs as Tamiflu, may also be effective against H5N1. In a study performed on mice in 2000, "zanamivir was shown to be efficacious in treating avian influenza viruses H9N2, [[H6N1]], and H5N1 transmissible to mammals".&lt;ref name=Zanamvir&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.influenzareport.com/ir/drugs/zanami.htm | publisher=Influenza Report | title=Zanamivir | author1=Bernd Sebastian Kamps | author2=Christian Hoffmann | accessdate=2006-10-15 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027052113/http://www.influenzareport.com/ir/drugs/zanami.htm | archivedate=2006-10-27 | df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, mice studies suggest the combination of zanamivir, celecoxib and mesalazine looks promising producing a 50% survival rate compared to no survival in the placebo arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Delayed antiviral plus immunomodulator treatment still reduces mortality in mice infected by high inoculum of influenza A/H5N1 virus | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=June 10, 2008 | accessdate=2009-08-31 | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/23/8091.full.pdf+html | doi=10.1073/pnas.0711942105 | volume=105 | pages=8091–8096 | author=Zheng B.-J.| pmc=2430364 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; While no one knows if zanamivir will be useful or not on a yet to exist pandemic strain of H5N1, it might be useful to stockpile zanamivir as well as oseltamivir in the event of an H5N1 influenza pandemic. Neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir can currently be manufactured in quantities that would be meaningful once efficient human transmission starts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Oseltamivir-resistant H5N1 virus isolated from Vietnamese girl | publisher=CIDRAP | date=October 14, 2005 | accessdate=2006-10-15 | url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/oct1405resistance.html | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925215140/http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/oct1405resistance.html | archivedate=September 25, 2006 | df= }}

==Epidemiology==
{{Further|Transmission and infection of H5N1|Global spread of H5N1}}
The earliest infections of humans by H5N1 coincided with an [[epizootic]] (an epidemic in nonhumans) of H5N1 influenza in Hong Kong's poultry population in 1997. This [[panzootic]] (a disease affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area) outbreak was stopped by the killing of the entire domestic poultry population within the territory. However, the disease has continued to spread; outbreaks were reported in Asia again in 2003. On December 21, 2009 the WHO announced a total of 447 cases which resulted in the deaths of 263.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Who.int |url=http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_LatestCumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf |format=PDF |title=Cumulative Number of Confirmed Human Cases for Avian Influenza A/(H5N1) Reported to WHO, 2003-2011 |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027125616/http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_LatestCumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

H5N1 is easily transmissible between birds, facilitating a potential [[global spread of H5N1]]. While H5N1 undergoes mutation and reassortment, creating variations which can infect species not previously known to carry the virus, not all of these variant forms can infect humans. H5N1 as an avian virus preferentially binds to a type of [[galactose]] receptors that populate the avian respiratory tract from the nose to the lungs and are virtually absent in humans, occurring only in and around the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], structures deep in the lungs where oxygen is passed to the blood. Therefore, the virus is not easily expelled by coughing and sneezing, the usual route of transmission.&lt;ref name=Shinya /&gt;&lt;ref name=Riel&gt;

H5N1 is mainly spread by domestic [[poultry]], both through the movements of infected birds and poultry products and through the use of infected poultry manure as fertilizer or feed. Humans with H5N1 have typically caught it from chickens, which were in turn infected by other poultry or waterfowl. Migrating [[waterfowl]] (wild [[duck]]s, [[geese]] and [[swan]]s) carry H5N1, often without becoming sick.&lt;ref name=FAO&gt;

According to a report by the [[World Health Organization]], H5N1 may be spread indirectly. The report stated the virus may sometimes stick to surfaces or get kicked up in fertilizer dust to infect people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title =Bird flu may be spread indirectly, WHO says  | work =[[Reuters]]  | publisher =Reuters  | date =2008-01-17  | url =https://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN1616209020080117  | accessdate =2009-09-01  | deadurl =no  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20081201062357/http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN1616209020080117  | archivedate =2008-12-01  | df =  }}

===Virulence===
H5N1 has [[mutation|mutated]] into a variety of [[strain (biology)|strains]] with differing pathogenic profiles, some pathogenic to one species but not others, some pathogenic to multiple species. Each specific known genetic variation is traceable to a virus isolate of a specific case of infection. Through [[antigenic drift]], H5N1 has mutated into dozens of highly pathogenic varieties divided into genetic clades which are known from specific isolates, but all currently belonging to genotype Z of avian influenza virus H5N1, now the dominant genotype.&lt;ref name="WHOinfluenza"&gt;{{cite journal | author = The World Health Organization Global Influenza Program Surveillance Network. | title = Evolution of H5N1 avian influenza viruses in Asia | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | year = 2005 | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no10/05-0644.htm | pmid = 16318689 | pages = 1515–21 | doi = 10.3201/eid1110.050644 | pmc = 3366754 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110206064422/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no10/05-0644.htm | archivedate = 2011-02-06 | df =  }}

===Transmission and host range===
[[File:Influenza A - late passage.jpg|thumb| Transmission electron [[micrograph]] ([[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]]) of negatively stained [[Influenzavirus A|Influenza A virus]] particles (small and white) attached to host cells (large and irregular) (late passage). (''Source: Dr. Erskine Palmer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Public Health Image Library'')]]

Infected birds transmit H5N1 through their [[saliva]], [[mucus|nasal secretions]], [[feces]] and [[blood]]. Other animals may become infected with the virus through direct contact with these bodily fluids or through contact with surfaces contaminated with them. H5N1 remains infectious after over 30 days at 0&amp;nbsp;°C ( 32.0&amp;nbsp;°F) (over one month at freezing temperature) or 6 days at 37&amp;nbsp;°C ( 98.6&amp;nbsp;°F) (one week at human body temperature); at ordinary temperatures it lasts in the environment for weeks. In Arctic temperatures, it does not degrade at all.

Because migratory birds are among the carriers of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, it is spreading to all parts of the world. H5N1 is different from all previously known highly pathogenic avian flu viruses in its ability to be spread by animals other than poultry.

In October 2004, researchers discovered H5N1 is far more dangerous than was previously believed. [[Waterfowl]] were revealed to be directly spreading this highly pathogenic strain to [[chicken]]s, [[crow]]s, [[pigeon]]s, and other birds, and the virus was increasing its ability to infect mammals, as well. From this point on, avian flu experts increasingly referred to containment as a strategy that can delay, but not ultimately prevent, a future avian flu pandemic.

"Since 1997, studies of influenza A (H5N1) indicate that these viruses continue to evolve, with changes in antigenicity and internal gene constellations; an expanded host range in avian species and the ability to infect felids; enhanced pathogenicity in experimentally infected mice and ferrets, in which they cause systemic infections; and increased environmental stability."&lt;ref name=biegel&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beigel JH, Farrar J, Han AM, Hayden FG, Hyer R, de Jong MD, Lochindarat S, Nguyen TK, Nguyen TH, Tran TH, Nicoll A, Touch S, Yuen KY; Writing Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) Consultation on Human Influenza A/H5.|title=Avian influenza A (H5N1) infection in humans|journal=N.

''The New York Times'', in an article on transmission of H5N1 through smuggled birds, reports Wade Hagemeijer of Wetlands International stating, "We believe it is spread by both bird migration and trade, but that trade, particularly illegal trade, is more important".&lt;ref name=rosenthal2&gt;{{cite news| author=Rosenthal, E.| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/15/world/europe/15bird.html?_r=1&amp;th&amp;emc=th&amp;oref=slogin| title=Bird Flu Virus May Be Spread by Smuggling| publisher=The New York Times| date=2006-04-15| accessdate=2006-04-18| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520124057/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/15/world/europe/15bird.html?_r=1&amp;th&amp;emc=th&amp;oref=slogin| archivedate=2013-05-20| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 27, 2007 researchers reported the H5N1 bird flu virus can also pass through a pregnant woman's placenta to infect the fetus. They also found evidence of what doctors had long suspected — the virus not only affects the lungs, but also passes throughout the body into the gastrointestinal tract, the brain, liver, and blood cells.
{{H5N1 cases}}

In May 2013, [[North Korea]] confirmed a H5N1 bird flu outbreak that forced authorities to kill over 160,000 ducks in [[Pyongyang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2013/05/20/17/0401000000AEN20130520010900315F.HTML|title=North Korea confirms bird flu outbreak at duck farm - YONHAP NEWS|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407002110/http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2013/05/20/17/0401000000AEN20130520010900315F.HTML|archivedate=2014-04-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===H5N1 transmission studies in ferrets (2011)===

Novel, [[Contagious disease|contagious]] strains of H5N1 were created by Ron Fouchier of the [[Erasmus Medical Center]] in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, who first presented his work to the public at an influenza conference in Malta in September 2011. Three mutations were introduced into the H5N1 virus genome, and the virus was then passed from the noses of infected [[ferret]]s to the noses of uninfected ones, which was repeated 10 times.&lt;ref name=scientific_american_pand&gt;
{{cite news |title=What Will the Next Influenza Pandemic Look Like? |first=Katherine |last=Harmon |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=next-influenza-pandemic |newspaper=Scientific American |date=2011-09-19 |accessdate=2012-01-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302235202/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=next-influenza-pandemic |archivedate=2012-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After these 10 passages the H5N1 virus had acquired the ability of transmission between ferrets via aerosols or respiratory droplets.

After Fouchier offered an article describing this work to the leading academic journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', the US [[National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity]] (NSABB) recommended against publication of the full details of the study, and the one submitted to Nature by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin describing related work. However, after additional consultations at the World Health Organization and by the NSABB, the NSABB reversed its position and recommended publication of revised versions of the two papers.&lt;ref name=NSABB23june2012&gt;

{{Main|Social impact of H5N1}}
H5N1 has had a significant effect on [[human]] [[society]], especially the [[financial]], [[political]], [[social]], and personal responses to both actual and predicted [[death]]s in [[bird]]s, [[human]]s, and other [[animal]]s. Billions of [[U.S. dollar]]s are being raised and spent to research H5N1 and prepare for a potential [[avian influenza]] [[pandemic]]. Over $10 billion have been spent and over 200 million birds have been killed to try to contain H5N1.&lt;ref name=Rosenthal /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2005/Nov/01-432345.html State.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914184240/http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2005/Nov/01-432345.html |date=2006-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jan2006/2006-01-18-02.asp Newswire] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517054650/http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jan2006/2006-01-18-02.asp |date=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12033509/ MSNBC]{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} [http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/acvfa/intro_ai.pdf US AID] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815071811/http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/acvfa/intro_ai.pdf |date=2008-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.bmo.com/news/article/0,1257,contentCode-4922_divId-4_langId-1_navCode-112,00.html |title=BMO Financial Group |publisher=.bmo.com |accessdate=2010-04-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503122700/http://www2.bmo.com/news/article/0,1257,contentCode-4922_divId-4_langId-1_navCode-112,00.html |archivedate=2009-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/pub8198/laurie_garrett_anthony_s_fauci_michael_osterholm_rita_colwell/the_threat_of_global_pandemics.php |title=Council on Foreign Relations |publisher=Cfr.org |accessdate=2010-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013053617/http://www.cfr.org/pub8198/laurie_garrett_anthony_s_fauci_michael_osterholm_rita_colwell/the_threat_of_global_pandemics.php |archivedate=2008-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=2006-04-28T080147Z_01_HAN5054_RTRUKOC_0_UK-BIRDFLU-VIETNAM.xml Reuters]{{dead link|date = April 2010}} article ''Vietnam to unveil advanced plan to fight bird flu'' published on April 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/a13fd43bc74b6209dc90f6d849ffa45b.htm Poultry sector suffers despite absence of bird flu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060330013814/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/a13fd43bc74b6209dc90f6d849ffa45b.htm |date=March 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barber |first=Tony |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a9b1d6b2-9c34-11da-8baa-0000779e2340.html#axzz1ej9u6LD8 |title=Italy imposes controls after bird flu discovery |publisher=FT.com |date=2006-02-13 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7375">'''Jeffrey Arnett''' is a Professor in the Department of Psychology at [[Clark University]] in Massachusetts. His main research interest is in "[[emerging adulthood]]," which means from the ages of 18 to 25.

==Career==

He did a B.S. in Psychology, at [[Michigan State University]] in 1980. Five years later, he finished an M.A. in [[Developmental Psychology]] at [[University of Virginia]]. He finished his Ph.D. at the [[University of Virginia]], in the same field as his M.A., in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clarku.edu/faculty/facultybio.cfm?id=615&lt;/ref&gt; From 1986-89, he was an Assistant Professor of Psychology, at [[Oglethorpe University]], Atlanta, Georgia. From 1989-92, he was a Research Associate at the Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago. From 1989-92, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Northwestern University Department of Psychiatry and the Committee on Human Development at the [[University of Chicago]]. From 1992-1998 he was an Associate Professor at the [[University of Missouri]]. From 1998 to 2005, he was a Visiting Associate Professor at the [[University of Maryland]], Department of Human Development and Department of Psychology. He was awarded tenure in  1996.

He authored a book on [[heavy metal subculture]] and teens, entitled ''Metalheads: [[Heavy Metal Music]] and Adolescent Alienation'' (1996, Westview Press). He also authored a textbook entitled ''Adolescence and Emerging Adulthood: A Cultural Approach'' (Prentice Hall). In May 2013, he published a book (with Elizabeth Fishel), entitled ''Getting to 30: A Parent's Guide to the 20-Something Years'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeffrey Jensen Arnett|author2=Elizabeth Fishel|title=Getting to 30: A Parent's Guide to the 20-Something Years|year=2014|publisher=Workman Publishing Company, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-7611-7966-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emerging adulthood==
[[Emerging adulthood]] is a phase of the life span between [[adolescence]] and full-fledged [[adulthood]], proposed by Arnett in a 2000 article in the ''[[American Psychologist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.apa.org/journals/amp/55/5/469 Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties]. Arnett, Jeffrey Jensen. ''[[American Psychologist]]'', Vol 55(5), May 2000, 469-480. {{doi|10.1037/0003-066X.55.5.469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging adulthood also encompasses late adolescence and early adulthood. It primarily applies to young adults in [[Developed country|developed countries]] who do not have children, do not live in their own home, or do not have sufficient income to become fully independent in their early to late 20s.

Arnett says emerging adulthood is the period between 18 and 25 years of age where adolescents become more independent and explore various life possibilities.  Emerging adulthood is a new demographic, is contentiously changing, and some&lt;ref name="Devin Ludwig"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/devin-ludwig/post_723_b_691244.html| title=  Challenges of the Young Adult Generation| last=  Ludwig| first=  Devin| publisher=''[[Huffington Post]]''| date=  August 23, 2010| accessdate =August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe that twenty-somethings have always struggled with "identity exploration, instability, self-focus, and feeling in-between".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marantz Henig|first=Robin|title=What Is It About 20&amp;#8209;Somethings?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22Adulthood-t.html?pagewanted=all|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinction from young adulthood and adolescence===
Arnett suggests that there are a few reasons why the term ''young adulthood'' is not fit to describe the developmental period of the late teens and early twenties. First, the term "young adulthood" suggests that at this developmental stage, adulthood has already been reached. Arnett states that most people in this developmental stage believe they have not yet reached adulthood.&lt;ref name=arnett&gt;Arnett, J.&amp;nbsp;J. (2000). Emerging Adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties. ''[[American Psychologist]]'', 55(5), 477.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they believe they are slowly progressing into adulthood, and thus the term "emerging adulthood" is much more appropriate.

What is more, if the years 18-25 are classified as "young adulthood," Arnett believes that it is then difficult to find an appropriate term for the thirties and that it is nonsensical to combine the late teenage years, twenties, and thirties together because the 18‑25 age period and the thirties are very distinct from one another. He says that while most 18- to 20-year-olds in the United States don't see themselves as adults and are still in the process of obtaining an education, are unmarried, and are childless, most people in their thirties in the United States see themselves as adults, have settled on a career, are married, and have at least one child.

Currently, it is appropriate to define adolescence as the period spanning ages 10 to 18. This is because people in this age group in the United States typically live at home with their parents, are undergoing pubertal changes, attend middle schools or junior high schools, and are involved in a "school-based peer culture". All of these characteristics are no longer normative after the age of 18, and it is therefore considered inappropriate to call the late teenage years and early twenties "adolescence" or "late adolescence". Furthermore, in the United States, the age of 18 is the age at which people are able to legally vote.&lt;ref name=arnett /&gt;

}}'''John Borthwick Gilchrist''' [[FRSE]] [[Legum Doctor|LL.D.]] (19 June 1759 – 9 January 1841) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[surgery|surgeon]], [[linguistics|linguist]], [[philology|philologist]] and [[Indology|Indologist]]. Born and educated in [[Edinburgh]], he spent most of his early career in [[India]], where he made a study of the local languages. In later life, he returned to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and lived in Edinburgh and [[London]]. In his final years, he moved to [[Paris]], where he died at the age of 81.

He is principally known for his study of the [[Hindustani language]], which led to it being adopted as the [[lingua franca]] of northern India (including present-day [[Pakistan]]) by British colonists and indigenous people. He compiled and authored ''An English-Hindustani Dictionary'', ''A Grammar of the Hindoostanee Language'', ''The Oriental Linguist'', and many more. His [[lexicon]] of Hindustani was published in [[Arabic script]], [[Nāgarī script]], and in [[Romanization|Roman transliteration]].&lt;ref name="R1"&gt;{{cite book |last= Ramchandani |first= Indu |title= Students' Britannica India, Volumes 1–5 |publisher= Popular Prakashan |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AE_LIg9G5CgC&amp;pg=PA300 |year= 2000|pages= 298–300|isbn= 978-0-85229-760-5|id= {{ISBN|0-85229-760-2}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"&gt;{{cite book |last= Mukherjee |first= Sujit |title= A Dictionary of Indian Literature: Beginnings-1850 |publisher= Orient Blackswan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCJrUfVtZxoC&amp;pg=PA113 |year= 1999 |pages= 113–114|isbn= 978-81-250-1453-9|id= {{ISBN|81-250-1453-5}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R3"&gt;{{cite book |last= Malik |first= Jamal |title= Islam in South Asia: A Short History |publisher= BRILL |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FduG_t2sxwMC&amp;pg=PA285 |year= 2008 |pages= 285 |isbn= 978-90-04-16859-6|id= {{ISBN|90-04-16859-1}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R6"&gt;{{cite book |last= Schimmel |first= Annemarie |title= Classical Urdu Literature from the Beginning to Iqbāl |publisher= Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AaeXVjTyyzEC&amp;pg=PA207 |year= 1975 |page= 207|isbn= 978-3-447-01671-1|id= {{ISBN|3-447-01671-X}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known for his role in the foundation of [[University College London]] and for endowing the [[Gilchrist Educational Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The World Year Book of Education|publisher=Evans Bros.|year=1937|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Gilchrist was born on 19 June 1759 in [[Edinburgh]], and baptised on 22 June 1759 with the names John Hay Gilchrist.&lt;ref&gt;19/06/1759 GILCHRIST, JOHN HAY (Church registers Old Parish Registers Records 685/1 300 78) Page 78 of 325&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Walter Gilchrist, but very little is known about him except that he was a merchant who disappeared the year that John was born. His mother was Henrietta Farquharson (1730-1830), originally from Dundee, who lived to the very advanced age of 100.&lt;ref name=AsJ&gt;{{cite book|title=The Asiatic Journal – January-April 1830|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rCkoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA254&amp;lpg=RA1-PA254&amp;dq=john+borthwick+gilchrist+his+lady&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5cHfzc-eAn&amp;sig=SAXa2zjLDV9IevQ2foGfnuVNaSU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi55__75O_QAhWMA8AKHYJjAloQ6AEIWTAO#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20borthwick%20gilchrist%20his%20lady&amp;f=false|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later life, Gilchrist obtained a licence to use the name Borthwick, his maternal grandmother's surname, based on her descendancy from the [[Lord Borthwick|Borthwick title]] in the Scottish peerage.&lt;ref name=HOL&gt;House of Lords  7 HLC 124 July 1, 8, l2 13, 16, 1858 Walter G. Whicker - Appellant; Joseph Hume and others, - Respondents http://www.uniset.ca/other/cs3/11ER50.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at [[George Heriot's School]] and the [[Edinburgh High School]] (1773-1775).&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite web|title=Gilchrist, John Borthwick|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10716/?back=,16731|access-date=2016-12-19|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography}}{{pay}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 16, he travelled to the [[West Indies]], where he gained a knowledge of the cultivation and production of [[Indigofera tinctoria|indigo]]. He remained there for two or three years before returning to Edinburgh.

===Career in India===
In 1782, Gilchrist was apprenticed as a surgeon's mate in the [[Royal Navy]] and travelled to [[Bombay]], [[India]]. There, he joined the [[East India Company]]'s Medical Service and was appointed assistant surgeon in 1784.&lt;ref name=LJR1851&gt;{{cite book|title=The Law Journal Reports for the Year 1851|editor-first=Montagu|editor-last=Chambers|volume=29|pages=369–384|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NA1DAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He marched with the company's Bengal Army to [[Fatehgarh]], and during this journey he noted the extent to which the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] language could be understood in different parts of the country. However, he was surprised that the company neither required nor encouraged their employees to learn it, and subsequent experiences convinced him that officers in the army should also learn it in order to communicate effectively with the [[Indian soldiers]] or [[sepoy]]s.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

====Hindustani dictionary====
Gilchrist began a systematic study of Hindustani, and from this work he created his first dictionary.&lt;ref name="R7"&gt;{{cite book |last= Glaisyer |first= Natasha |author2=Sara Pennell |title= Didactic Literature in England, 1500–1800 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing, Ltd |url= 
https://books.google.com/books?id=lq-ZDuZ90hoC&amp;pg=PA155 |year= 2003 |pages= 155|isbn= 978-0-7546-0669-7|id= {{ISBN|0-7546-0669-4}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mas"&gt;{{cite book |last= Masood |first= Ehsan |title= Scienče &amp; Is̊lam: A History |publisher= Icon Books |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=H9yeHB1A-JwC&amp;pg=PT206 |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-1-84831-081-0|id= {{ISBN|1-84831-081-1}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1785 he requested a year's leave from duty to continue these studies. This leave was eventually granted in 1787 and Gilchrist never returned to the Medical Service. He spent 12 years living at various places, including [[Patna]], [[Faizabad]], [[Lucknow]], [[Delhi]], and [[Ghazipur]]. He travelled extensively to work with native speakers and also to garner material. In Ghazipur, to help finance his work, he also engaged in the production of indigo, [[sugar]] and [[opium]] – an enterprise which was initially successful but eventually failed.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

In 1786, he advertised his first publication, ''A Dictionary: English and Hindoostanee. To which Is Prefixed a Grammar of the Hindoostanee Language''. This was published by subscription and issued in instalments to be completed in 1790. It was the first printed publication in [[Devanagari]] type, as developed by the Orientalist and typographer, [[Charles Wilkins]]. The Government promised to take 150 sets at 40 [[rupee]]s each, and the price rose eventually to 60 rupees.&lt;ref name="mas"/&gt;

====Background to the Hindustani language====
{{see also|Hindi|Urdu|Hindi-Urdu controversy}}
In Northern India, the Hindustani language developed from the need of the new migrants of [[Persian people|Persian]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] origin to communicate with people in Delhi and the surrounding regions. The local populace spoke [[Khariboli]], one of the [[Hindi languages]], which supplied the basic vocabulary and grammar of Hindustani, but it also absorbed a lot of words from [[Persian language|Persian]].

Gilchrist popularised Hindustani as the language of British administration. When he started as a surgeon with the East India Company's payroll, he was told that Persian was India's main language, but he quickly discovered that none of the people he met spoke either Persian or Arabic very well. His interactions with people helped him to discover that Hindustani was already known to some in the East India Company. They referred to the language as [[Moors]] language or simply Jargon, and it was Gilchrist who adopted this as the new language of administration for British India.&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R4"&gt;{{cite book |last= Veer |first= Peter Van Der |title= Religious Nationalism: Hindus and Muslims in India |publisher= University of California Press |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=p29ArJ7j6zgC&amp;pg=PA170 |year= 1994 |pages= 170-|isbn= 978-0-520-08256-4|id= {{ISBN|0-520-08256-7}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fort William College====
{{main article|Fort William College}}
On Gilchrist's suggestion, the Governor-General, the [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Marquess of Wellesley]], and the East India Company decided to set up a training institution for its recruits in [[Calcutta]]. This started as the ''Oriental Seminary'' or ''Gilchrist ka madrasa'', but was enlarged within a year to become [[Fort William College]] in 1800. Gilchrist served as the first principal of the college until 1804, and through the personal patronage of Wellesley received a generous salary of 1500 rupees a month, or about £1800 per year (about £180,000 in present-day terms).&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; During this time, he also published a number of books: ''The Stranger's East India Guide to the Hindoostanee or Grand Popular Language of India'', ''The Hindustani Manual or Casket of India'', ''Nastaliq-e-Hindoe'', ''The Hindu Roman Orthoeptical Ultimatum'', ''The Oriental Fabulist'', and others.&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sen |first= Sailendra Nath |title= Textbook of Indian History and Culture |publisher= Macmillan |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fpJ7ry7B5TYC&amp;pg=PA274 |year= 2007 |pages= 270–274|isbn=978-1-4039-3200-6|id={{ISBN|1-4039-3200-X}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Powell|first= Avril Ann |title= Muslims and Missionaries in Pre-Mutiny India |publisher= Routledge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOH_zGK2mY8C&amp;pg=PA100 |year= 1993 |pages= 90–100|isbn= 978-0-7007-0210-7|id= {{ISBN|0-7007-0210-5}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Gilchrist's leadership, Fort William also became a centre for [[Urdu]] prose. The language they taught was meant for young British people to acquire a general practical knowledge for administrative purposes, and not for native speakers of the language. He gathered around him writers from all over India who were able to produce a simple Urdu style that was "intelligible to British officers and merchants who had no use for poetry".&lt;ref name="R6"/&gt; One of Gilchrist's pupils was the missionary [[Henry Martyn]], an [[Anglican]] priest and chaplain for the East India Company, who revised the Hindustani version of the [[New Testament]] and later translated it, together with the Book of [[Psalms]] and [[Book of Common Prayer]], into Urdu and Persian. By the early nineteenth century, the Persian language was gradually replaced by Urdu as the vernacular to serve as the administrative language in a growing colonial [[bureaucracy]].&lt;ref name="R4"/&gt;

In 1803, Gilchrist inducted other writers into the college, who helped make rapid strides in [[Hindi]] language and literature. Subsequently, a Hindi translation of the Bible appeared in 1818 and ''[[Udant Martand]]'', the first Hindi newspaper, was published in 1826 in Calcutta.

Scholars debate Gilchrist's role in the distillation of Hindustani into the modern languages of Hindi and Urdu, but according to Gilchrist, the rise of the new prose tradition was also the "bifurcation of Khariboli into two forms – the Hindustani language with Khariboli as the root resulted in two languages (Hindi and Urdu), each with its own character and script."&lt;ref name="R5"&gt;{{cite book |last= Everaert |first= Christine |title= Tracing the Boundaries Between Hindi and Urdu |publisher= BRILL |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LqZ-6QRKc7wC&amp;pg=PA257 |year= 2010 |pages= September |isbn= 978-90-04-17731-4|id= {{ISBN|90-04-17731-0}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; He not only discovered/invented the Hindustani language, but he was credited as a great patron of Urdu and indirectly the reinvigoration of Hindi. During his time at Fort William College, he encouraged the use of the purer form of Khariboli from which contemporary Hindi evolved. In the words of K.B. Jindal, author of ''A history of Hindi literature'': "Hindi as we know it today is the product of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="kap"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kapoor |first= Subodh |title= The Indian Encyclopaedia: Hinayana-India (Central India) |publisher= Genesis Publishing Pvt Ltd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__uUoaurFisC&amp;pg=PA2890&amp;dq=John+Gilchrist,+Urdu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BSQLUOnCN4firAeb_-3ICA&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Gilchrist%2C%20Urdu&amp;f=false |year= 2002 |page= 2890|isbn= 978-81-7755-267-6|id= {{ISBN|81-7755-267-8}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view was that of [[George Abraham Grierson]], an Irish [[linguist]] and Civil servant, who said that the standard or pure Hindi which contemporary [[Indian people|Indians]] use is "an artificial dialect the mother tongue of no native-born Indian, a newly invented speech, that wonderful hybrid known to Europeans as Hindi and invented by them."&lt;ref name="kap"/&gt;

===Land in Australia===
In 1801, while still in India, Gilchrist acquired a substantial holding of land near [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], from [[William Balmain]]. He bought this for a nominal sum in settlement of a debt.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; Gilchrist never went to Australia, but as Sydney subsequently developed, the value of this holding (now part of the suburb named [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]]) rose substantially.

===Return to Britain===
In 1804, Gilchrist was granted leave of absence from his position at Fort William and travelled back to Britain. However, due to ill health, he never returned to India. He retired from the service of the East India Company in 1805 and was awarded a pension for the remainder of his life. He took an interest in the Borthwick title and, through a series of [[grant of arms|grants of arms]], he eventually styled himself, "John Borthwick Gilchrist, of Camberwell, in the county of Surrey, LL.D., late Professor of the Hindoostanee Language in the College of Fort William, at Calcutta."&lt;ref name=LJR1851/&gt;

In 1806, when the [[East India College]] was established at Haileybury, [[Hertfordshire]], its original plan called only for the teaching of Arabic and Persian. However, the first appointed Oriental Professor, [[Jonathan Scott (orientalist)|Jonathan Scott]], a scholar of these languages, resigned even before the College opened its doors. Gilchrist succeeded him but held the post only a few months.

Later the same year, Gilchrist moved to Edinburgh where, in partnership with James Inglis, he founded a banking firm, Inglis, Borthwick Gilchrist &amp; Co, which operated from a flat in Hunter Square. He also became in 1807 a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] (proposed by [[William Moodie]], [[John Playfair]] and [[James Bonar (lawyer)|James Bonar]]), the [[Royal Horticultural Society|Horticultural Society]], the [[East India Club]], and the [[Scottish Military and Naval Academy]]. He gained a reputation for being somewhat eccentric, with a fiery temper and violent politics and language. One of his eccentricities was to erect an aviary containing exotic birds on the side of his house on Nicolson Square.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1815 his banking business ran into difficulties and was dissolved. He moved for a brief period to Perthshire, resolving never to return to Edinburgh. He then moved to London in 1817 and the following year was appointed as lecturer in oriental languages for the East India Company, a position he held until 1825. However, after this employment ceased, he controversially continued to give lectures without payment, as a vehicle to promote the sale of his works as textbooks. With a similar view, he assisted in the foundation of the [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/bloomsbury-project/institutions/london_oriental_institution.htm London Oriental Institution] and became a founding shareholder of [[University College London]], serving as its first Professor of Hindustani.&lt;ref name=LJR1851/&gt; He also worked with [[George Birkbeck]] to establish the London Mechanics Institution (later [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]]).

===Marriage and children===
Gilchrist fathered a number of children during his time in India between 1782 and 1804. However, their legitimacy and the identity of the mother are unclear, and it appears that several died young. One surviving daughter, Mary Anne (b. 1786), may have remained in India after Gilchrist departed and it is known that, in 1810, she married Major Charles William Burton in Calcutta. He was the son of [[James Burton (clergyman)|James Burton]], canon of [[Christ Church, Oxford]] and chaplain to [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] and [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]. Charles William Burton died at [[Mirzapur]] in 1816&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland Enjoying Territorial Possessions Or High Official Rank, But Uninvested with Heritable Honours|last=Burke|first=John|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=upFIAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|volume=3|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; and decades later, his and Mary Anne's son, Major Charles Aeneas Burton, was murdered together with his two sons at [[Kotah]] in 1857, during the [[Indian mutiny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1857 Kotah Uprising|url=http://www.colsudhirfarm.com/1857kotatrail.html|website=Col.

It is also known that three other Indian-born daughters returned with Gilchrist to Britain:
*Henrietta (1797-1864) married James Wilson, a merchant, in Edinburgh in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marriage of James Wilson to Henrietta Gilchrist|website=Scotland's People|url=https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/view-image/nrs_opr_records/8569765?image=167}}{{pay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tennent et al|title=Cases Decided in the Court of Session, Teind Court, Court of Exchequer and House of Lords|volume=14|page=919|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-OlCAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=gilchrist#v=snippet&amp;q=gilchrist&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his return to Edinburgh, Gilchrist married Mary Ann Coventry on 15 May 1808,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Scots Magazine for January 1808|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aMYzAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA397&amp;dq=john+borthwick+gilchrist+mary+anne+coventry&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWu53O0fHQAhUBOsAKHWaCA3MQ6AEINjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20borthwick%20gilchrist%20mary%20anne%20coventry&amp;f=false|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; a woman nearly 30 years his junior, with whom he had no children.

===Final years, death and legacy===
[[File:Père-Lachaise - Division 42 - Gilchrist 01.jpg|thumb| Tomb at the [[Père-Lachaise Cemetery]].]]

Gilchrist travelled to the Continent several times between 1825 and 1831, for reasons of ill health. He settled in [[Paris]] almost permanently from 1831 onwards, obtaining a French passport for himself, his wife and two servants, and resided in the Rue Matignon. He died there on 9 January 1841, aged 81, and was buried in the [[Père-Lachaise Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Steven |editor-first= Leslie |editor2-last=Lee| editor2-first=Sidney|title= A Dictionary of National Biography, Volume 22 |publisher= Macmillan &amp; Co.|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofnati22stepuoft|year=1890|pages=1221-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Will====
Gilchrist left a considerable fortune, which included property and investments in London and Edinburgh, as well as the Balmain estate in Australia. In his will, he appointed the [[Member of Parliament]], [[Joseph Hume]], to be his principal executor, and instructed that his assets be sold and the proceeds held in a [[charitable trust]]. From the Trust's income, he granted annuities to his widow and surviving daughters. The residual income he instructed to be used "for the benefit and advancement and propagation of education and learning in every part of the world as far as circumstances will permit."&lt;ref name=HOLC1858&gt;{{cite book|title=The House of Lords Cases during the Sessions 1858, 1859 and 1860|first=Charles|last=Clark|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qFsDAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=gilchrist#v=snippet&amp;q=gilchrist&amp;f=false|pages=125–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal battle====
The will was contested by some members of Gilchrist's family. The principal [[appellant]] was his nephew, Walter Gilchrist Whicker (son of his sister, Helen), who considered himself to be Gilchrist's legitimate heir-at-law. The case, known as ''[[Whicker v Hume]]'', was complex and considered several issues:

* Gilchrist's legal [[domicile (law)|domicile]] at the time of his death. It was argued that this should be [[Scots law|Scotland]] or [[Law of France|France]] (his countries of birth and death, respectively), rather than [[English law|England]], where the will had been drawn up.
* The legitimacy of Gilchrist's Indian-born daughters.
* The [[jurisdiction]] which applied to the land in the [[colony of New South Wales]], and whether the legal doctrine of ''[[mortmain]]'' applied to it.
* Whether Gilchrist's words "education and learning" constituted a valid charitable objective.

The case dragged on for many years and eventually went as far as the [[House of Lords]], which handed down its final judgement upholding the validity of the will in July 1858, over 17 years after Gilchrist's death and after which time several of the parties, including both Whicker and Hume, had themselves died. It has become a significant legal [[precedent]], regarding the definition of domicile and the jurisdiction under which a will must be executed.&lt;ref name=HOLC1858/&gt;&lt;ref name=HOL/&gt;

====Gilchrist Educational Trust====
An unexpected side-effect of the lengthy legal battle was that the value of the land in Australia had in the meantime increased to an estimated £70,000, and the total value of Gilchrist's estate when probate was finally granted was in excess of £100,000 (over £10,000,000 in current values).&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; With this large endowment, the [[Gilchrist Educational Trust]] was finally able in 1865 to start its work, and continues to the present day to provide financial grants to individuals and organisations for educational purposes.

==Character and political views==
Gilchrist had a fiery temperament and frequently became involved in arguments. He had a lifelong habit of expressing his views and frustrations in letters and printed pamphlets, blaming everyone except himself for the woes that afflicted him from time to time. He has been described as "alternately rambling and forthright, self-pitying and aggressive – indeed, at times downright abusive."&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; Despite this, he was usually treated exceptionally well by those in a position of authority and patronage, and by various means he became a very wealthy man – even if his business methods were sometimes rather unethical.

During his time in Edinburgh, he became notorious for his radical political views and became an outspoken advocate of [[republicanism]]. Inevitably, these views made him enemies, and together with the collapse of his banking business, it led him to forsake his native city for the rest of his life – returning only occasionally for brief visits to his mother.

There are no likenesses of him in his younger days, but as an old man ''Chambers' Biographical Dictionary'' describes him as "his bushy head and whiskers were as white as the Himalayan snow, and in such contrast to the active expressive face which beamed from the centre of the mass, that he was likened to a royal Bengal tiger – a resemblance of which he was even proud."

[[Image:NewKP Logo.png|thumb|right|Registered KidsPeace logo with dove in hand.]]
'''KidsPeace''' is a private charity serving the behavioral and mental health needs of children, families and communities. Founded in 1882, KidsPeace provides a psychiatric hospital, a range of residential treatment programs, educational services and a variety of community-based treatment programs and foster care and community programs.

KidsPeace offers services in Georgia, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia and the District of Columbia.

KidsPeace was founded by the president of the [[Bethlehem Steel Corporation]] William Thurston, in response to a [[smallpox]] epidemic that had left many children in the area homeless. In 1895, Captain James Wiley donated a [[Salisbury Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Salisbury Township]] home and {{convert|6|acre|m2}} of surrounding land to the charity. Afterwards, the organization came to be known as "Wiley House" and remained so for many years, until it officially changed its name to "KidsPeace" in January 1992.

==Treatment==
The largest KidsPeace facility is the Orchard Hills Campus located in Orefield, Pennsylvania, outside of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]. It is a {{convert|262|acre|ha|sing=on}} campus with such amenities as an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a ropes course, an apple orchard, playgrounds, a gym with wrap-around track, driving range, multiple athletic fields, recreation lounges and more. To educate the children, KidsPeace utilizes its own private schools, staffed with specially trained teachers. There are schools both on and off campus to provide educational services to residential clients and students receiving community treatment services.

According to its official website, there were 8,628 children in KidsPeace programs/centers in 2005 and over 2,000 children’s professionals were trained at the KidsPeace Institute that same year. KidsPeace is one of America's oldest children's charities and has treated over 140,000 children in need since 1882.

KidsPeace is accredited by The Joint Commission in Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Other accreditations include the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.

KidsPeace does not discriminate in regard to admissions in terms of sex, race, creed, color, national origin, LEP (Limited English Proficiency), religious beliefs, disabilities or handicapping conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Kidspeace: [http://www.kidspeace.org/outcomes.htm Outcomes and Measures]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical harm and sexual assault concerns==
In 1993, Dean Sine, a counselor in the Orefield, Pennsylvania facility, restrained a 12-year-old boy by sitting on his buttocks and then lower back. The boy reported that he couldn't breathe, but the restraint was continued until after the boy was unresponsive, when it was discovered that the boy had stopped breathing. Resuscitation attempts failed, and the counselor was subsequently charged and acquitted of homicide in criminal court in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.mcall.com/1995-06-30/news/3028158_1_kidspeace-boy-s-death-sine The Morning Call]&lt;/ref&gt;  KidsPeace was also sued regarding the incident, and settled out of court for over $1 million.&lt;ref name="assault"&gt;[http://articles.mcall.com/2003-08-15/news/3488890_1_story-numerous-assaults-boy The Morning Call, 8-15-2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2003, Dean Sine pleaded guilty to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse with a 14-year-old boy in 1994. KidsPeace declined to comment on whether Sine was an employee at the time of the incident.&lt;ref name="assault"/&gt;

In 2007, admissions to KidsPeace were halted by state officials due to seven children sustaining broken bones while being restrained by KidsPeace staff. Admissions resumed in December 2007.&lt;ref name="Meth"&gt;[http://articles.mcall.com/2008-08-15/news/4167863_1_kidspeace-methadone-group-home The Morning Call, 8-15-2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methadone overdose incident==
In April 2008, two 16-year-old girls accessed a counselor's supply of [[methadone]] pills in her car. The girls took a total of 28 pills, resulting in one girl fatally overdosing and another being partially paralyzed. The girls were being given a ride home from a group home for children with drug problems.&lt;ref name="Meth"/&gt;

==Financial issues, pension default, and bankruptcy==
As of 2010, the pension plan for KidsPeace was underfunded by $42 million. In January 2012, KidsPeace failed to make a $1.4 million bond payment. In March 2012, a lien was filed against KidsPeace for failing to contribute $3 million to its retirement plan. As a partial result, Moody's downgraded KidPeace's bond rating to a C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.mcall.com/2012-04-03/news/mc-kidspeace-misses-bond-payment-20120403_1_kidspeace-counselors-kidspeace-officials-pension-payments The Morning Call]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, KidsPeace filed or [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.mcall.com/2013-05-21/news/mc-kidspeace-bankrupt-filing-20130521_1_kidspeace-spokeswoman-pension-fund-pension-benefit-guaranty-corp The Morning Call]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omnimgt.com/sblite/templates/a/Default.aspx?clientId=CsgAAncz%2b6YL%2fNVgK4EZc4alGlGenpsLFRp%2fZwigd8KGkW413OKhM5VG4ldoEdcTyM5WgkTqESE%3d Rust Omni]&lt;/ref&gt; The bankruptcy filing listed organizational debts totaling nearly $249 million, including nearly $100 million in unfunded pension obligations. Also in May 2013, the [[Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation]] assumed control of the KidsPeace pension plan after KidsPeace officials defaulted on making required payments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbgc.gov/about/who-we-are/retirement-matters/post/2013/05/23/PBGC-Protects-Pension-Benefits-at-KidsPeace-Corporation.aspx PBGC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Executives at KidsPeace receive salaries and compensation of up to $413,729 per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.mcall.com/2012-04-06/news/mc-pc-paul-carpenter-kidspeace-history-20120406_1_kidspeace-history-kidspeace-president-kidspeace-officials The Morning Call]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Limbitless Solutions''' is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] founded in the [[United States]] that uses additive manufacturing ([[3D printing]]) to advance affordable personalized bionics and [[prostheses|prosthetic]] partial arms for children with disabilities.&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;[http://limbitless-solutions.org/about-us/ Our Limitless Mission] Our Limitless Mission&lt;/ref&gt; The organization claims their limbitless’ bionic arms are manufactured for under $400, 1% of traditional prostheses.&lt;ref name=" Huffington Post "&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSNyjnVQScA Huffington Post] Huffington Post&lt;/ref&gt; Headquartered in [[Orlando, Florida]],&lt;ref name=" Florida Department of State Division of Corporations"&gt;[http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResultDetail?inquirytype=EntityName&amp;directionType=Initial&amp;searchNameOrder=LIMBITLESSSOLUTIONS%20N140000094090&amp;aggregateId=domnp-n14000009409-652f57c1-6b2b-4470-b04d-9753bc6a0e67&amp;searchTerm=limbitless%20solutions&amp;listNameOrder=LIMBITLESSSOLUTIONS%20N140000094090 Florida Department of State Division of Corporations] Florida Department of State Division of Corporations&lt;/ref&gt; the organization was founded by a team of [[University of Central Florida]] engineering students, led by executive director Albert Manero.&lt;ref name="Kid-Approved How one prosthetic arm is changing many lives"&gt;[http://www.ucf.edu/pegasus/kid-approved Kid-Approved How one prosthetic arm is changing many lives] Kid-Approved How one prosthetic arm is changing many lives&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

As [[University of Central Florida]] engineering students, the Limbitless Solutions team began the first project at the [[university]] campus manufacturing lab in 2014. The organization used a donated [[Stratasys]] Dimension 3D Printer and other supplies to create an affordable prosthetic, to minimize cost and time of traditional manufacturing processes like [[CNC milling]].&lt;ref name=" Stratasys, 3d printed prosthetic arm "&gt;[http://blog.stratasys.com/2015/08/05/3d-printed-prosthetic-arm/ Stratasys, 3d printed prosthetic arm] Stratasys, 3d printed prosthetic arm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" CNN, UCF 3D printed arms for kids "&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/06/health/ucf-3d-printed-arms-for-kids/ CNN, UCF 3D printed arms for kids] CNN, UCF 3D printed arms for kids&lt;/ref&gt; Built in the student's free time, their first arm used a 3D printer running with off-the-shelf [[servos]] and batteries that were activated by the [[electromyography]] muscle energy on a child’s limb.&lt;ref name=" UCF, Fulfilling 6 years olds dream ucf students design build arm "&gt;[http://today.ucf.edu/fulfilling-6-year-olds-dream-ucf-students-design-build-arm/ UCF, Fulfilling 6 years olds dream ucf students design build arm] UCF, Fulfilling 6 years olds dream ucf students design build arm&lt;/ref&gt; Most prosthetic arms are [[machine (mechanical)|mechanical]], which presents a challenge for children without elbows. With mechanical arms, the child opens and closes their hand by bending their elbow. The students came up with the idea for an electronic arm with a muscle sensor that allows the child to open and close their hand by flexing their [[biceps]].&lt;ref name=" CNN, UCF 3D printed arms for kids "/&gt;

== Production ==

When producing a prosthesis, the child is measured (size of residual limb, length of limb, etc.) and the model of the arm is then appropriately scaled and adjusted before being printed, assembled, and fitted. [[Electromyography]] (EMG) sensors are calibrated before the arm is ready for use.&lt;ref name="What is the general process of making an arm FAQ Limbitless"&gt;[http://limbitless-solutions.org/faqs/ What is the general process of making an arm FAQ Limbitless] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421094737/http://www.limbitless-solutions.org/faqs/ |date=2015-04-21 }} What is the general process of making an arm FAQ Limbitless&lt;/ref&gt;
The time to fabricate one bionic arm ranges depending on several factors, the most influential being the type of [[amputation]]. The time to build a helper hand is 4–6 weeks, and a bionic arm without an elbow is 8–12 weeks. In addition to partial arms, Limbitless has said it has plans to make full arms with elbows as well as legs.

'''M'''edical '''A'''ssociates for '''R'''esearch and '''C'''ommunication '''(MARC)''' is a [[Non-Governmental Organisation]] that works globally with medical students and researchers with little to no background in research. Their primary goal is to help these researchers complete their research work using appropriate scientific methods thereby maintaining high scientific and research standards. Members of MARC were involved in a pilot study that later proved to be a landmark research study that formed the impetus for the creation of a 911 like system in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20467994 | volume=25 | title=Where there are no emergency medical services-prehospital care for the injured in Mumbai, India. | journal=Prehosp Disaster Med | pages=145–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trekmedics.org/resources/global-burden-rti/ |title=Global Burden of Road Traffic Injuries |publisher='Trek Medics International'|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/drvenugopalpp/emergency-medical-services-2020-issues-and-challenges|first=Venugopalan|last= Poovathumparambil |title=Emergency medical services 2020-Issues and Challenges|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Das AK, et al. "White Paper on Academic Emergency Medicine in India:INDO-US Joint Working Group (JWG)" web |url=http://www.japi.org/october_2008/u_789.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
MARC was established by [[Ritam Chowdhury]] [[MBBS]], [[Master of Public Health|MPH]], [[PhD]] in December 2008, in [[Mumbai]], [[India]]. Although started in 2008, the foundations of MARC were laid down much earlier in 2005. As per an interview, MARC was established to "''overcome the lack of adequate research training led to improper application of scientific principles. This led to many good research ideas by medical students and researchers being rejected when submitted for review.''" Thus, MARC was formed as an [[NGO]] to help guide medical students and researchers avoid these pitfalls. Members of MARC collaborate widely with many researchers from across the globe.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

==Philosophy==
MARC and its members provide a safe environment wherein researchers could voice their concerns. 
MARC focused on connecting researchers with resources and providing technical or scientific expertise on a pro bono basis. In addition, they conduct health education and community outreach volunteer work in different parts of India. All work done by MARC is pro bono. Collaborators who assist MARC in its activities volunteer their time and thus help in training the next generation of researchers and public health professionals.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

==Members==
MARC was founded by [[Ritam Chowdhury]] [[MBBS]], [[Master of Public Health|MPH]], [[PhD]]. [[Ritam Chowdhury]] [[MBBS]], [[Master of Public Health|MPH]], [[PhD]] is also a Visiting Instructor-[[Global Health]] at [[Emory University]] [[Rollins School of Public Health]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://directory.service.emory.edu/?eodentry=P8630997| title= Ritam Chowdhury|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and statistical consultant at [[Harvard School of Public Health]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/information-technology/2014/11/18/new-staff-addition-ritam-chowdhury/| title = New Staff Addition: Ritam Chowdhury| accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mental illness''' is very prevalent in South Africa, yet the country lacks many of the necessary resources and policies needed to execute an effective mental health strategy. Many factors including [[violence]], [[communicable disease]], and urbanisation have increased the prevalence of [[mental disorder]]s in the country. The way in which these mental disorders are treated has changed over the years.&lt;ref name="WHO8" /&gt;

For a while, [[mental health care]] was mainly [[mental institution|institutionalised]]. However, in 1997, following the White Paper Act, the South African government moved to [[deinstitutionalisation|deinstitutionalize]] mental health care and relegate it to the [[primary care]] setting. However, current data indicates that the goal of deinstitutionalization and effective primary mental care has still not been fulfilled.&lt;ref name="WHO8" /&gt; 

[[Traditional African Medicine|African Traditional Medicine]] still plays a huge role in African society. Even though it often functions in an inhibitory manner, a comprehensive health plan with a focus on collaboration between traditional practices and [[Western medicine]] could prove very beneficial. Another factor regarding the very nature of mental disorders complicates this issue even further. 

A complete cure of a mental disorder is nebulous and can only be attained gradually with time. For this reason, mental illness is hard to cure among such a paucity of resources. Without the necessary intermediate care and continuity in therapy, many patients regress when released from the hospital.

==Deinstitutionalisation and primary health care==
Prior to 1997, mental health care in South Africa was mainly institutionalised, and little emphasis was placed on the development of curative therapies. Due to a paucity of resources, it was more cost effective to simply isolate mentally unstable individuals rather than invest in effective, yet costly care.&lt;ref name="Inge140" /&gt; Following the 1997 White Paper Act and the National Health Act 61 of 2003, the government made an attempt to deinstitutionalize mental health care and transfer the bulk of this responsibility to the level of [[Primary Health Care]] (PHC).&lt;ref name="Inge141" /&gt; 

General category [[psychopharmacological]] drugs, which had previously only been available at mental institutions, are now present with 96% availability at primary health care facilities.&lt;ref name="WHO15" /&gt; However, it was found in a study conducted by the [[World Health Organization]] that approximately 56% of mental health care still takes place in an institutionalised setting.&lt;ref name="WHO14" /&gt; In the country of South Africa, there are only 290 registered [[psychiatrist]]s, providing a physician to population ratio of 1:183,000.&lt;ref name="Kale1255" /&gt; With PHC facilities, there are only 0.04 psychiatrists per in-patient bed.&lt;ref name="WHO18" /&gt; 

Primary health care facilities are so severely understaffed that a physician often does not have time to do anything other than refer a mental case to the district hospital. In addition, less serious cases such as depression are often overlooked and rarely diagnosed. Doctors need to prioritise their work and spending time on a [[mood disorder]] case is seen as an ineffective use of their time.&lt;ref name="Inge145" /&gt; 

There is also a lack of communication between primary health care facilities and district hospitals. PHC physicians often refer mental cases to the district hospital, but rarely hear feedback on the case. Since the primary care physician never learns about the new diagnoses or changes in treatment, he is unable to provide adequate follow-up care. Not only does this break the [[continuity of care]], but it also obstructs physicians from learning about these mental disorders and the appropriate treatments necessitated for different sets of symptoms. This severely restricts any potential for a more autonomous primary care division.&lt;ref name="Inge144" /&gt;

==Lack of official health policy==
The quality of mental health care varies greatly from district to district. For instance, general [[psychotropic medication]]s such as [[anti-psychotic]]s and [[anti-convulsant|anti-epileptics]] are present with 81–100% availability in 4 provinces, 21–50% in 1 province, and 0% in another province.&lt;ref name="WHO17" /&gt; The South African government has yet to institute a set of firm health protocols. The policies outlined in the 1997 "National Health Policy Guidelines for Improved Mental Health in South Africa" were supposed to be the official health policy document. However, in interviews conducted between WHO representatives and [[Department of Health (South Africa)|South African Department of Health]] officials, it was found that more recently instituted policies contradicted statutes set out in the National Health Policy bill. Therefore, since adherence to this bill is virtually nonexistent, South Africa does not really possess a national [[health policy]].&lt;ref name="WHO8" /&gt; 

In order for the Department of Health to create an effective health policy, it first needs to establish standards for data collection and indicators to be applied to statistical analysis. Although protocols regarding data collection and reporting exist, the sheer lack of personnel among PHC facilities makes such requirements impractical. Only 75% of PHC mental facilities transmit some sort of statistical data to the health department, and much of this data is often incomplete and far from rigorous.&lt;ref name="WHO25" /&gt;

==Additional problems==
In a study conducted in 2009 it was found that of the 16.5% of people suffering from mental disorders, only 25% had received treatment.&lt;ref name="Inge141" /&gt; It has been found that the very factors that contribute to this high prevalence of mental illness also serve to inhibit its treatment. Communicable disease, civil strife, and poverty run rife throughout South African society. However, faced with limited resources, the South African government must prioritise its problems, and mental illness does not often take precedence. As a result, many mental health facilities remain both severely understaffed and underfunded.&lt;ref name="Okasha" /&gt; 

An additional problem resides in the high turnover among hospital staff. The unique nature of psychiatric illness necessitates a certain degree of experience before effective treatment can be rendered. However, many nurses leave before they are fully trained. This is largely due to the lack of oversight from [[mental health professional|mental health specialists]] as many nurses stationed at the primary care facilities have little to no interaction with them. As a result, this lack of direction results in the nurses becoming overwhelmed and eventually many will [[burnout (psychology)|burn out]] and transfer. Any progress made in the training of these nurses will be lost and the training process must be started again.&lt;ref name="Inge144" /&gt; 

Additionally, the [[psychiatric nurse]]s in the district hospitals lack specialisation. Due to staff shortages, it is necessary to rotate nurses through all areas of the hospital. As a result, the nurses caring for the psych patients have varying degrees of experience and many possess minimal familiarity with mental illness.&lt;ref name="Inge145" /&gt;

Another problem is the lack of intermediate care once a patient is released from the hospital. Services such as [[support group]]s, special housing, and [[supported employment]] are virtually nonexistent in South Africa. The Mental Health Care Act of 2002 states that follow-up care should be provided for chronic cases within available resources. However, due to the lack of resources, this intermediate care is never provided. Once treatment at a mental health facility is completed, the patient is handed back into the care of his fellow villagers and they are informed of the discharge instructions. However, a lack of adherence to these instructions results in many patients regressing after being released.&lt;ref name="Inge144" /&gt;

==Origins of mental health issues in South Africa==
Many factors including work-related stress, disease, poverty, abuse, [[Sexual violence in South Africa|sexual violence]], as well as the decay of the [[traditional values|traditional value system]] are contributing to the high occurrence of mental health issues in South Africa. In a study conducted by the Mental Health and Poverty research Program, it was found that approximately 16.5% of the adult population in South Africa suffers from mental illness, with 1% suffering from a severe life debilitating mental disease.&lt;ref name="Inge141" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Okasha" /&gt; 30% of South Africans are likely to suffer a mental illness in their lifetimes, depression being the most common ailment.&lt;ref name=MGMH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2015-07-01-sa-is-stressed-out-and-suicidal |title=SA is stressed out and suicidal |last=Green |first=Amy |date=1 July 2015 |accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these statistics may be an underestimation. Among the native population, many still hold to the traditional belief that mental illness results from a [[demonic possession]]. As a result, many individuals for fear of [[social ostracism]], keep their mental illness secret instead of seeking the much needed medical attention.&lt;ref name="Okasha" /&gt; This means that there is still a significant population suffering from mental illness that is currently unrepresented in mental health statistics. 

=== Post-traumatic stress disorder ===
{{See also|Sexual violence in South Africa}}

Probably one of the largest contributors to the high frequency of mental disorders is violence. Of the adult population ages 16 to 64, it was found that 23% were exposed to a [[traumatic event (psychological)|traumatic event]] of violence in the past year. These traumatic events include acts such as fighting a war, being [[torture]]d, or participating in violence. Among this population, it was determined that mental illness including symptoms of [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) was 8.5 times more prevalent than among the general population.&lt;ref name="Hirschowitz169" /&gt;

=== Substance abuse ===
Another factor contributing to mental illness in South Africa is substance abuse. Many provinces are used as drug trafficking routes, and as the South African government lacks the necessary resources to control this problem, many of these illicit drugs find their way into local populations as a [[cannabis (drug)|drug]].&lt;ref name="Okasha" /&gt; In addition, the availability of the wild growing ''[[Cannabis]]'' plant allows for its rampant abuse among all age categories. It was found that 52% of street children smoke the Cannabis plant and 22% on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="Kilonzo422" /&gt; Educational campaigns are limited, and as a result, many do not realise the impinging health effects that will result from substance abuse. 

=== Disease as a trigger ===
Diseases such as [[malaria]], [[typhoid fever]], and HIV provide a significant contribution to the prevalence of mental illness. Some of these diseases such as [[cerebral malaria]] can bear a direct physiological effect on the mental functionality of the patient. However, even more poignant is the ability of disease to strike a radiating blow to the patient's emotional [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]]. For instance, the prevalence of mental illness among those suffering from HIV is 43.7% compared to the 16.5% observed among the general population.&lt;ref name="Freeman489" /&gt; This data indicates that disease delivers equal emotional damage as it does physiological harm.

=== Exposure to Western cultural pressures ===
Both growth of the industrial sector and rapid urbanisation are undermining the social fabric of traditional society. The alluring financial and social prospects of an urban environment draw many young individuals splitting up families and villages. The family network which was once regarded as the emotional, moral, and social centre of the community is now being undermined.&lt;ref name="Fleck327" /&gt; 

As a result, many who are drawn to the city lose touch with their traditional roots and begin to lose a sense of purpose and direction as the focus is turned to utilitarian and hedonistic endeavours. In addition, they no longer have the invaluable social support structure that was once provided by family networks and village communities.

==The role of African traditional medicine==
African Traditional Medicine still plays a large role in African society. It was found that 45% of the black patients that attended a community mental health clinic had consulted a [[traditional healers of South Africa|healer]] for their problem. Additionally, 26% were simultaneously seeking treatment from both the traditional healers and the psychiatrists.&lt;ref name="Kale1256" /&gt; Traditional healers are often instrumental in treating mental illness. Psychological healing relies more on a cultural and emotional understanding than it does on possessing medical knowledge.&lt;ref name="Fleck327" /&gt; 

In an interview, Dr. Mustafa Elmasri, a Gaza psychologist with over twenty years of experience describes how he has often collaborated with African Traditional Medicine. Instead of labelling traditional healers as primitive and demonic, he worked with them and even trained some of them in scientific methods for identifying certain mental illnesses such as [[epilepsy]] and [[psychosis]]. Dr. Elmasri found that "traditional healers were the key partner beyond the patients and their families in gaining an understanding of the psychological experience and access to [[social support]] structures".&lt;ref name="Fleck327" /&gt; 

Beliefs are fundamental to behaviour, and therefore a deeper understanding of traditional medicine will help to improve the effectiveness of psychological care. Dr. Elmasri also recounts how he occasionally refers mild stress cases to the healers as these patients require a holistic approach from individuals that they know and trust.&lt;ref name="Fleck327" /&gt; The Traditional Health Practitioners Bill in South Africa, No. 25 of 2004 made attempts for the "formalization, regulation and professionalization" of traditional medicine doctors.&lt;ref name="Myers148" /&gt; However, this bill has never been put into effect and formal collaboration between Western and traditional medicine has yet to be established.

The Westernised approach to treating mental illness often ends up worsening the patient's condition. In a three decade long study conducted by the World Health Organization which includes data from 30 research sites in 19 countries, it was found that people diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] experienced better outcomes among "developing" countries than they did in Europe and the United States. Much of this trend is attributed to socio-cultural conditions such as "increased family involvement, informal economies, less segregation of the mentally ill and community cohesion".&lt;ref name="Myers516" /&gt; 

Effective treatment of mental illness necessitates the recognition and identification of cultural differences. For example, in Western society, many derive a sense of self-worth from their ability to survive in a competitive economy. However, the informal economies of the developing nations allow for less stressful work-related roles. Therefore, conducting therapy in South Africa with an emphasis on "valued citizenship" does nothing more than create an intangible goal which will simply cause added stress to the individual.&lt;ref name="Myers518" /&gt; Effective treatment must be uniquely targeted to each culture with careful consideration to the socio-cultural conditions and "contextually relevant coping mechanisms".&lt;ref name="Myers500" /&gt; Neglect to recognise these essential cultural factors will result with impotent and detrimental treatment.

'''Na'im Akbar''' is a clinical psychologist well known for his Afro-centric approach to psychology. He is a distinguished scholar, public speaker, and author.&lt;ref name="thehistorymakers.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/naim-akbar-40|title=Na'im Akbar - The HistoryMakers|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akbar entered the world of Black psychology in the 1960s, as the Black Power Movement was gaining momentum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackhistory.com/cgi-bin/blog.cgi?blog_id=62378&amp;cid=54|title=Connect Platform - Error Message|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, Akbar published his first critiques of the [[Eurocentric]] psychological tradition, asserting that this model maintained the intellectual oppression of African Americans. Akbar criticized the pathology perspectives that had taken over as the dominant literature on African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radford.edu/~jaspelme/minority-groups/past_courses/Karenga_Black_Psychology.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his major works involved [[mental health]] among African Americans.

==Biography==

Na’im Akbar, originally named Luther Benjamin Weems Jr., was born on April 26, 1944, in Tallahassee, Florida.&lt;ref name="thehistorymakers.com"/&gt; He attended the Florida A &amp; M University Laboratory School, an all-Black school, from kindergarten through high school, and graduated from high school in 1961.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/3046854/Im_Trying_To_Get_You_Free_Naim_Akbar_African_Psychology_and_the_Reconstruction_of_the_Collective_Black_Mind|title=I&amp;#39;m Trying To Get You Free: Na&amp;#39;im Akbar, African Psychology and the Reconstruction of the Collective Black Mind|first=DeReef|last=Jamison|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child of Black middle class parents, Akbar was in an unusual situation at the time as both of his parents were college educated, a rare circumstance for a Black child growing up at the time. His childhood was spent in a segregated southern community in Tallahassee, but he lived in a unique community where “academic excellence was the unquestioned standard”.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; At a time when Black people lived in both socially and economically oppressed segregated communities, this emphasis on academic excellence was fairly uncommon.

Upon graduating high school, Akbar moved on to the [[University of Michigan]], where he completed his B.A. in Psychology, M.A. in Clinical Psychology, and Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology.&lt;ref name="apbspeakers.com"&gt;[http://www.apbspeakers.com/speaker/na‘im-akbar]&lt;/ref&gt; Heavily influenced by the Black student movement at the University of Michigan, and freshly aware of racial tensions (his freshman year at Michigan marked his first personal contact with Whites), Akbar became active with the [[Black Action Movement]] (BAM) strike which shut down classes at the University of Michigan for three weeks in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; His experiences at Michigan helped to set the stage for Akbar to start questioning the normative status quo approach to psychology, which was dominant at the time. Akbar relates that the environment at Michigan lead to “the early conversations that we began to have about a ‘[[Black Psychology]]’, and to deconstruct the psychology that we had been taught”.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Working towards his Ph.D. in [[Clinical Psychology]], Akbar wrote a dissertation called "Power Themes among Negro and White Paranoid and non-Paranoid Schizophrenics".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In his dissertation, Akbar sought to define and explore the distinctive literature discussing definitions of psychology and mental health for Black people. Through this work, Akbar began to seriously question many of the accepted definitions of mental health for Black people, which had their genesis in European American psychology. Akbar credits this time in his career as the defining point about which his future work would be forged.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

After obtaining his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, Akbar moved to [[Atlanta]] to work for the psychology department at [[Morehouse College]], a historically Black college.&lt;ref name="thehistorymakers.com"/&gt; At Morehouse, Akbar designed and taught the first Black psychology course in the history of the college, and eventually developed the first Black psychology program at the college.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; After two years of working at Morehouse, Akbar was named chair of the Psychology Department there.&lt;ref name="thehistorymakers.com"/&gt; Three years later, Akbar left Morehouse to work at the Nation of Islam’s headquarters in Chicago.&lt;ref name="thehistorymakers.com"/&gt; Around this time, Akbar changed his name to Luther X, after joining the [[Nation of Islam]] and then later to Na’im Akbar after joining the Muslim American Community of Imam [[Warith Deen Mohammed]] then named "[[The World Community of Al-Islam in The West]]". Akbar created the Office of Human Development, where he remained for two years until he went back to teaching and accepted a position at [[Norfolk State University]], a historically Black university located in Norfolk, Virginia.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; As an Associate Professor at Norfolk, Akbar crafted and taught courses in Black psychology.&lt;ref name="thehistorymakers.com"/&gt;

Akbar then moved on to accept a faculty position at [[Florida State University]] back in his hometown of Tallahassee, Florida, where he continued to teach courses in Black psychology.&lt;ref name="apbspeakers.com"/&gt; In 1971, Akbar joined the [[Association of Black Psychologists]] (ABPsi), which is the largest professional organization with focuses on Black mental health in the world.&lt;ref name="thehistorymakers.com"/&gt; Since becoming active in the organization, Akbar has served on the board numerous times, and served as the President of the ABPsi from 1987 to 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abpsi.org/about_history.html|title=The Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi) - About ABPsi - History|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Akbar has served on the editorial board of the ''[[Journal of Black Studies]]'' and was the associate editor of the ''[[Journal of Black Psychology]]'' for eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ElectroNet Intermedia Consulting |url=http://www.naimakbar.com/naimakbar.php?page=Background |title=Dr. Na'im Akbar offers insight and analysis of the social concerns affecting African-Americans |publisher=Naimakbar.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After teaching at Florida State University for 28 years, Akbar retired in 2008 so that he could put more time and effort into his role as the president of his private consulting and publishing company.&lt;ref name="apbspeakers.com"/&gt; Akbar created the private consulting company, Na’im Akbar Consultants, and the publishing company, Mind Productions, in the late 1980s in efforts to broaden his teaching audience.&lt;ref name="thehistorymakers.com"/&gt; Throughout his career, Akbar has become a distinguished author, writing numerous books and speaking publicly to share his expertise at conferences and interviews. His major contributions to the field of psychology have been centered on the topics of developing an African-centered approach in modern psychology – which for Akbar involves the deconstruction of Eurocentric psychological thought and the subsequent reconstruction/construction of an African psychology that includes the specific historical and cultural experiences of African Americans.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Other key topics in Akbar’s life work involving the African American family and relationships, cultural diversity, and the Afro-centric perspective.&lt;ref name="apbspeakers.com"/&gt;

==Mental Disorder Among African Americans (1991)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Akbar|first=Na'im|title=Mental disorder among African Americans|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==

In his 1991 paper “Mental Disorder Among African Americans,” Akbar maintains his Afro-centric view of psychology, and criticizes the Euro-centric normative definitions of mental illness that were historically used to classify and label numbers of African Americans as mentally ill. Akbar called this abuse “intellectual oppression,” and argued that African Americans should create their own definitions of “normal” and “abnormal” that made meaningful use of an African worldview and was culturally relevant to African Americans. Akbar attributed the failure of society to question these white normative traditions to a phenomenon he called “democratic sanity,” which he paralleled to a majority-rules system. Historically, normality was understood as a function of the behaviors of the majority of the people; thus, when judging African Americans with reference to the behaviors of the dominant class, any deviations in behavior may be considered insane. Akbar subsequently raises questions about the standards used to judge the sanity of African Americans and maintained that cultural considerations were necessary to adequately assess the mental health of African Americans.

In this paper, Akbar identifies four categories of mental illness among African Americans:

# The Alien-Self Disorder
# The Anti-Self Disorder
# The Self Destructive Disorders
# Organic Disorders

According to Akbar, the “alien-self” disorder is characterized by an individual who rejects their own natural dispositions, and thereby acts in detriment to their survival. This individual is materialistic and denies the social realities of their social and political oppression. He/She attempts to “live in a dream world,” without acknowledging racism, and thus lives in conflict with their true identity. Such an afflicted individual often tries to live as though he/she were a member of the dominant class; he/she seeks to join exclusive clubs and live in exclusive neighborhoods. As a result, this individual ultimately belongs to neither the dominant (European American), nor oppressed (African American) groups, and thus commits himself to a life of identity confusion and ultimately loneliness.

The “anti-self” disorder is similar to the alien-self disorder, but goes a step further and actively holds negative impressions and views of his group. Individuals with this disorder “represent the true ‘colonized mentality,’” meaning that they so desire to be part of the dominant group that they take on their very views and dispositions to the detriment of the individual’s group of origin. According to Akbar, the danger in this disorder is that individuals feel comfortable with their alien identification, and are thus unlikely to seek help. Akbar relates that the anti-self disorder is worse than the alien-self disorder, because the individual with the anti-self disorder is more out of contact with reality and is thus more disturbed.

According to Akbar, “victims of self-destructive disorders are the most direct victims of oppression” because oppression is unnatural and inhuman and thus drives the oppressed away from reality. Those with self-destructive disorders try to survive in the hostile environment that oppression creates, but ultimately fail and become self-defeating. These individuals have failed to survive and grow within the society, which systematically oppresses them, and resorts to self-deprecating tactics like doing drugs or becoming a prostitute. Akbar believes that black-on-black crime is a result of self-destructive disorders, and posits that alcoholics and druggies resort to a world of chemical fantasies instead of dealing with their own realities.

Organic disorders derive from physiological, neurological, or biochemical failures. Individuals belonging to this group of disorders are severely mentally defective, and overlap greatly with disorders traditionally recognized as schizophrenia. Although traditionally viewed as a physical condition, Akbar posits that organic disorders may stem in part from a disordered and defective environment. According to Akbar, “the oppressive system remains the essential cause of mental disorder within the African American community.” Akbar relates that the trend towards charging all types of mental illnesses as organic in nature is merely an effort to downplay the influence of society on mental stability. The African American practitioner must therefore consider such societal influences on mental conditions and look at the social, political, and historical contexts of the patient in considering diagnosis and treatment. Akbar concludes that the creation of an African American definition of normalcy is necessary, and until such a definition is formed, African Americans remain subjects to the power and authority of the dominant community.

==Nigrescence and Identity: Some Limitations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Akbar|first=Na'im|title=Nigrescence and identity: Some limitations|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;==

In this reaction paper to [[William E. Cross Jr.]]’s [[Nigrescence]] Model of African American identity development, Akbar reviews some of the limitations that he sees in the model and others articles that have expanded upon Cross’ model. Akbar notes that Cross’ theory was drafted as a reaction to the sociopolitical environment at the time, specifically his observations that African Americans in the 1960s began changing their self-perceptions and social behaviors. As such, Akbar relates that Cross’ theory must be understood as a reaction to this phenomenon. Akbar’s two major qualms with Cross’ theory, and the related papers by Parham and Helms, is that 1) the model fails to account for the view that the Black identity is the core context of the self, and 2) the model fails to account for the centrality of spirituality in conceptualization of the Black personality, a crucial element in the Afro-centric perspective.

Akbar also takes issue with the idea that a secure Black identity was realized when the African American became comfortable forging relationships with members of other ethnic groups and cultures. According to Akbar, it makes more sense if a secure Black identity was evident when one was comfortable establishing and maintaining relationships with one’s own racial/cultural group members. He likened Cross’ reasoning to an adoption of the alien-self disorder, and argued that Cross’ assumption was flawed.

Additionally, Akbar discussed a potential alternative path of identity formation, not addressed in Cross’ model – the affirmation of one’s racial/cultural identity through a positive, rather than a negative encounter. He cited the example of Malcolm X’s “real” immersion, which he argues came 20 years after his encounter. This immersion was a result of spiritual change and a personal commitment to the teachings of Elijah Muhammed. Akbar argues that such a path results in a natural emergence of racial/cultural identity, rather than the forced emergence of an identity after a negative encounter. Akbar goes on to say that this positive encounter seems to lead to a more stable identity formation that the one that emerges from a negative encounter, and he cites [[Malcolm X]] and [[W.E.B. Du Bois]] as examples of this phenomenon.

Akbar also addresses some of the relevant issues regarding Cross’ model of Nigrescence and its translation to counseling. Akbar relates that the major unresolved issue for counseling purposes is a problem of definitional clarity. Different counseling solutions are dependent on the perceived cause of African American identity formation; identity formation as a result of a negative encounter or negative social experiences should result in different counseling from identity formation due to a positive encounter, or the affirmation of one’s racial/cultural core identity.

==Visions for Black Men (1991)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Akbar|first=Na'im|title=Visions for Black Men|year=1991|publisher=Mind Productions &amp; Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==

In "Visions for Black Men," written in 1991, Akbar relates the necessity for Black men to rise to their full potential as leaders in the home and in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geoclan.com/arts/bookshelf/visions.htm|title=GeoReview: Visions For Black Men|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akbar wrote the book to try and empower Black men worldwide to become self-determined and fulfill their due roles in society. In the book, Akbar makes a careful distinction between being a male and being a man. To be a man, Akbar relates, is to be conscious of themselves, their actions, and their environments, and to take responsibility for their actions and inactions. Akbar refers to [[Marcus Garvey]], [[Elijah Muhammad]], Imam Warith D. Mohammed, [[Booker T. Washington]], [[Martin Luther King]], [[Paul Robeson]], and [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] as examples of Black men who were leaders and advocates of change.

=="I'm trying to get you free" (2003)==

Akbar released this spoken word compact disk in 2003, with the goal of spreading his beliefs to a broader audience. When he states “I’m trying to get you free,” Akbar is referring to obtaining a collective freedom of the mind for African Americans. One of Akbar’s key philosophies was that true freedom for African Americans was necessitated on a collective cultural perspective viewed from a framework that incorporated the historical and cultural experiences of African Americans. On this disk, Akbar relates such words as, “We are a magical people;” “We are not just Americans;” “Don’t you know what we been through in this land?” in attempts to convey that African Americans have a long and powerful history that they should be proud of.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|ZWyYJ9xb-ic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognitions==
A distinguished scholar, author, and speaker, Dr. Na’im Akbar has accumulated numerous awards and recognitions throughout his career. He was awarded the Distinguished Psychologist Award from the National Association of Black Psychologists, and Honorary Doctorates of Humane Letters from [[Edinboro University]] in Pennsylvania and [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]].&lt;ref name="apbspeakers.com"/&gt; Akbar has also be given commemorative days on his behalf in six major cities across the United States, and was named a Development Chief in [[Ghana]], West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idvl.org/thehistorymakers/Bio123.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Akbar has also served on the Boards of Directors of numerous organizations, including the National Association of Black Psychologists, for which he served as the president from 1987 to 1988.&lt;ref name="thehistorymakers.com"/&gt; Akbar has been featured in newspapers and magazines both nationally and internationally, including ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Essence Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="apbspeakers.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25059">'''Organic food culture''' refers to a recent social and [[cultural trend]] in which there has been an increased interest in [[organic food]] due to the rise of media coverage on health, food safety, and environmental dangers of [[pesticide]]s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughner|first=Renee Shaw|year=2007|title=Who are organic food consumers?A compilation and review of why people purchase organic food|journal=Journal of Consumer Behavior|volume=6|issue=2–3|pages=94–110|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/cb.210}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude considers food a central requirement for health, but it does not neglect the [[aesthetic]] (concern with beauty) or [[hedonistic]] (pleasurable) aspects of [[food consumption]].

This trend in the way people are eating crosses many aspects of the social and cultural realm, such as market practices and [[media content]] when it comes to food, which has led to some [[novelties]] and changes in these fields. Attitudes concerning the consumption and consideration of organic food have shifted globally, which seems to affect local food cultures and traditional [[Gastronomy|gastronomies]], while also incorporating them.

== Critical consumption of food ==
Consumption of organic food is a form of responsible [[Consumer behaviour|consumer behavior]], since it stems from beliefs that are related to personal and public welfare. This practice requires a conscious consumer, who knows what they want and the reasons why they want it when it comes to food consumption. Such a vision of the consumer involves both environmental and personal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Sassatelli, R (2015). "Consumer Culture, Sustainability and a New Vision of Consumer Sovereignty". ''Sociologia Ruralis.'' 55 (4): 483 – 496&lt;/ref&gt;

Organic food thus implies concern with the self and the environment and works in a very personalized fashion. Moreover, it is also a means of communicating personal beliefs.

Even if consumers are consciously active, they have to be sure that the products they consume are produced according to precise criteria. This can be achieved by relying on institutional bodies, such as the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]], which intervene in the management of organic food circulation. These groups also provide the consumer with a set of recognizable signs that convey information about the source, means of production, ingredients, and nutritional values of their food.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pivato, S; Misani N; Tencati A (2008). "The impact of corporate social responsibility on consumer trust: the case of organic food)". ''Business Ethics: A European Review''. 17 (1): 3 – 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a vision of organic market practices assigns a great power to the consumer, who is conceived as being able to lead a conscious market demand.

In the case of organic food, the demand initially created the market, but eventually the sheer amount of products labeled "organic", as well as increasing demand stimulate the consumption patterns.

== National variation and food policies ==

=== Localization practices ===
The rising popularity of organic foods also raises important questions of interest to governments of different countries.  Some research also states that people have a preference for buying organic food due to the fact that they believe it is stimulating the local economy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Demographic]] and [[agricultural]] histories, as well as governmental procedures, are fundamental to understanding recent food system localization practices.&lt;ref&gt;Hughner, Renée Shaw, et al. "Who are organic food consumers? A compilation and review of why people purchase organic food." Journal of consumer behaviour 6.2‐3 (2007): 94–110&lt;/ref&gt; The growing recognition of the significance of local food and agriculture has raised considerable interest in farmers and consumers attempting to challenge global food systems. Much of the emphasis in new local food policy initiatives has combined specialty products from local farms with organic and ecological products. The turn to local food may cover many different forms of agriculture, encompassing a variety of consumer motivations and giving rise to a wide range of political changes, much as the laissez-faire economics of the nineteenth century prompted various responses with resistance to contemporary globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, Michael. "Embeddedness, the new food economy and defensive localism." ''Journal of rural studies'' 19.1 (2003): 23–32&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Food policies in Europe ===
In many [[European countries]], food is crucially linked to a sense of belonging to a [[national community]] and is part of [[national identity]]. The debate over [[Genetically modified food controversies|genetically modified food]] in Europe has brought [[interest group]]s, [[social movements]], and [[NGOs]] to spread the importance of health, [[nutrition]], and [[ecological]] consideration to [[legislative bodies]]. The [[European Commission]] created a set of policies in 2007 that regard procedures to be taken when it comes to organic agriculture and importing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/organic/eu-policy/eu-legislation/brief-overview_en|title=EU law on organic production: an overview - Organic Farming - European Commission|last=Anonymous|date=2016-09-19|website=Organic Farming - European Commission|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries in the European Union support growth in the [[biotechnological]] industry, while other countries have adopted precautionary principles to avoid [[industrialized]] food production. The Consumer Union has successfully campaigned for introduction of regulations requiring labeling of products to ensure customers have control over the purity and quality of the food they purchase. [[Skepticism]] about genetically modified food has increased demand for organic food and caused a steady rise of vegetarianism, which is seen as a way to eat only trusted foods to provide a sense of order. Since 1970 agricultural policy in EU member states has been taken over by the community; farmers and retailers have grown accustomed to thinking of food issues in political and environmental terms. 

=== Local variation in Europe ===
In countries like the [[U.K.|UK]], government policies focus regulations on informed consumer choice, via ingredient labeling. The UK is the European country where the most vocal and radical resistance to new agricultural innovation can be found, due to the government’s slow response to food scares. Studies proved that in countries like [[Belgium]], [[Norway]], and UK, there is a strong preference for ecologically cultivated food. In spite of this, the U.K.'s government has attempted to mobilize the organic food market. 

In other countries, like Italy, transparency and quality seem to have a different meaning, which implies that labeling of products plays a slightly different role. Labeling is necessary to put a greater emphasis on tracing food, which is perceived as a step toward safety. The Italian debate on GM food is very recent (late ’90s) and has grown rapidly. Food safety has become a media issue, which has encouraged consumers to prefer organic products considering the fact that 77% of Italian adults are convinced that organic food is better for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.enoas.org/pol05t/004c.html|title=Enoas|website=www.enoas.org|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organic food is portrayed as safer, expressing cultural traditions and territorial awareness. [http://www.aiab.it/ Associazione Italiana per l’Agricoltura Biologica]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aiab.it/|title=AIAB - Associazione Italiana per l'Agricoltura Biologica|website=www.aiab.it|language=it-it|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; reports a growth in organic acreage, therefore, Italy is one of the leader countries of organic food production. The Italian government has a more involved approach to the organic food matter. Politicians have taken a strong stance and the government has made great efforts to mobilize value change. Organic food illustrates the combined impact of moral issues with questions of localized trust in farmers. Food is linked to issues of political legitimization, becoming an object of continuous debates and struggles between citizens and the government. Interactions between producers, retailers and consumers are originating new styles of consumption that have given power to the consumer. In European societies, marketing and retailing agents provide ecological information to their customers, leading people to begin questioning large companies and government statements about food. This represents major proof that food consumption is, among other things, crucial to people’s sense of belonging to a political community.&lt;ref&gt;Sassatelli, Roberta, and Alan Scott. "Novel food, new markets and trust regimes: responses to the erosion of consumers' confidence in Austria, Italy and the UK." European Societies 3.2 (2001): 213–244&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organic labels ===
[[File:Organic-Logo.svg|thumb|EU organic food logo]]
In the organic food market, a consumer’s trust is a crucial issue since purchasers are unable to truly verify whether a product is organic, even after consumption. Organic certification has a long tradition in many European countries. Organic certification labels on product packages and/or price tags are used as a signal to consumers that a product is a certified organic product. In the European Union, the only products that can be labeled and sold as organic food comply with and are certified according to the principles of organic production, certification and labeling of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007.&lt;ref&gt;For the full text of the regulation, see [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2007:189:0001:0023:EN:PDF Regulation (EC) No. 834/2007].&lt;/ref&gt; Since July 2010, all prepackaged organic products produced and sold in the EU must be labeled with the new mandatory EU logo.

Besides the EU label, there are several other organic certification labels in many European countries, which are owned by different kinds of organizations. On one hand, these can be differentiated into governmental labels, and on the other hand logos of private organizations. Governmental logos are found in some but not in all European countries (e.g. Danish ‘Red Ø’ logo, German ‘Bio-Siegel’).&lt;ref&gt;Janssen, Meike, and Ulrich Hamm. "Certification logos in the market for organic food: What are consumers willing to pay for different logos?." ''paper presentato al Congresso EAAE, Change and Uncertainty, Challenges for Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources, Zurigo''. Vol. 30. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, in order to be considered organic a product must be produced using specific methods (excluding radiation, genetic engineering, etc.), only using allowed substances, and overseen by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|US Department of Agriculture]], who is making sure the farm is following all organic regulations.  In order to sell a product that claims to be organic, it must be certified.  If there are specific ingredients in a product that are certified organic, this may be specified on the packaging.  An exception to the labeling of organic products is the fact that products coming from farms that make $5,000 or less do not have to be certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/organic/labeling|title=Organic Labeling {{!}} Agricultural Marketing Service|website=www.ams.usda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Markets ==

=== Production ===
[[File:Global_distribution_of_organic_retail_sales_by_single_market.png|thumb|Fig. 1. Global distribution of organic retail sales by single market, 2014. (Source: FIBL-AMI survey, 2016).]]
Organic markets have revealed a huge potential and today they display a steady annual positive growth in all countries that invest in production.

The organic market in the EU increased by 7.4% in 2014, lead by Germany with 7,910 million Euro retail sales and a growth rate of 4.8%, followed by France, UK and Italy. (FIBL-AMI survey 2016 based on national data sources).

Worldwide, the organic market is headed by the United States, which holds 43% of global retail sales, followed by EU (38%), China (6%), Canada (4%) and Switzerland (3%).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;IFOAM EU Group, “Organic in Europe, Prospect and Developments 2016” (2016) {{ISBN|978-3-03736-313-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United States the solid growth of organic food market is expected to continue until 2018, according to the new “United States Organic Food Market Forecast &amp; Opportunities, 2018” (2013) that puts a compound annual growth rate of 14% on the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com|title=Food &amp; beverage trends, regulation, labeling, innovation|last=FoodNavigator-USA.com|website=FoodNavigator-USA.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consumption ===
In the EU, consumption of organic food has almost doubled in the last decade; consumers in 2005 used to spend, on average, €22.4 per capita on organic food, while in 2014 the number is increased up to €47.4. In this case, the nation that consumes more is Switzerland, followed by Luxembourg, Denmark, and Sweden.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the US, organic food consumption is on the rise as well.  In 2014, consumption was up to about $35 billion per year and it is estimated that organic foods have become more commonplace since then.  Produce is the top selling category when it comes to organic foods, but other categories such as dairy, snacks, and beverages are on the rise as well.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/natural-resources-environment/organic-agriculture/organic-market-overview.aspx|title=USDA ERS - Organic Market Overview|website=www.ers.usda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millennials are considered to be the most prevalent consumers of organic products. They make up over half of the buyers and generally persuade their families to buy organic products.

=== Distribution ===
While at the beginning organic products were mainly sold by specialized retailers, at the end of the 1990s sales began to cross over the mainstream retailers. Today, general retailers are the main distribution channels, followed by organic retailers and direct sales, even if these channels differ in importance from country to country.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  93% of organic foods are sold in regular or specialized supermarkets in the US and the remaining 7% come from alternate buying means, such as farmers markets.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A critique of organic products is that distribution requires a similar amount of energy consumption compared to conventional food. Going local is considered more carbon friendly than organic food in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=9&amp;sid=0651bb95-b6cf-4cee-8f70-769e384d07a0@sessionmgr104&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==#AN=25760329&amp;db=a9h{{deadlink|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retailers and marketing approaches ===
Retailers and marketing agents have had to adapt to the ever growing and conscious flow of demand for organic foods. Organic products are perceived as premium products, which requires the market to handle them in such a way to create, preserve, and possibly enhance this perception.

As a consequence of the fact that consumption of organic products is embedded in a wider system of beliefs, buyers are highly involved when purchasing these type of products and the activity itself involves mental and emotional processes. Thus, the marketing approach toward this type of consumption is said to be more cognitive than behavioral, since its aim is primarily to understand how consumers link a product's traits with a healthful and socially conscious lifestyle.  Typically, consumers relate the taste, texture, and odor of the food to kinds of hedonistic achievements and the organic way of production is connected to a healthy lifestyle and thus wholesomeness, physical well-being, and eventually happiness and a general inner harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zanoli|first=Raffaele|last2=Naspetti|first2=Simona|date=2002-09-01|title=Consumer motivations in the purchase of organic food: A means‐end approach|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/00070700210425930|journal=British Food Journal|volume=104|issue=8|pages=643–653|doi=10.1108/00070700210425930|issn=0007-070X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the retailer point of view, organic foods, together with a set of other food products such as food supplements, weight loss bars, and free-from products, make up a category of goods that attract many niche market consumers and generate high margins of revenue. Traditional supermarkets are increasingly promoting organic food products by means of wider variety, price differentiation, and private labels, and specialized organic food stores, like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, are increasingly more popular.&lt;ref&gt;Bezawada, R; Pauwels K (2013). “What is special about marketing organic products? How organic assortment, price, and promotions drive retailer performances”. ''Journal of Marketing''. 77 (1): 31 – 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Organic private labels play a particularly important role in building the retailer image, since they help to build the retailer image and consumer bindings. As a sign of corporate social responsibility, the labels influence consumer trust in the company and its products. In the case of organic products, trust plays a crucial role since, even if consumers want to act in a conscious, rational, and independent way, it can be difficult to know if what buyers see is what they get. Usually, consumers cannot directly verify whether the organic products they purchase actually follow the laws of organic agriculture. If a consumer suffers from information asymmetries, this can make them feel vulnerable. For this reason it is important for the consumers to rely on the USDA along with retailers and marketing gurus, who present themselves as guarantors that products have actually been produced according to organic farming practices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Organic restaurants ===
Organic and green restaurants constitute an additional food service connected with the spread of organic sensitivity. They have recently gained popularity and exploited market segmentation in order to attract those customers who are engaged with the pursuit of a healthy diet.

Restaurants of this nature usually stock up directly from local products, offering clients dishes cooked with fresh and local ingredients. Recently certifications have been instituted for organic restaurants. For example, in Italy, ICEA, [http://www.icea.info/it/ Institute for Ethical and Environmental Certification]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icea.info/it/|title=ICEA - Istituto per la Certificazione Etica ed Ambientale|website=www.icea.info|language=it-it|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; has set a certification system that allows for more control and standardizes requirements in order to get organic recognition. In addition to certifications for organic foods, standardization for gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan menus have been instituted, as well.

Another example is the American nonprofit “[http://www.dinegreen.com/ Green Restaurant Association]”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dinegreen.com|title=Green Restaurant Association|website=Green Restaurant Association|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which enlarges the prerequisites for the “green” certification to more general environmental issues. The association takes into consideration water efficiency, waste reduction and recycling, use of energy, and pollution reduction.  Their system is based on 80 "green points," which are awarded if the restaurant adheres to certain environmentally friendly procedures.  For most cities in the US, a restaurant is considered GRA certified if they score a 62 or above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dinegreen.com/certification-standards|title=Green Restaurant Association|website=Green Restaurant Association|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media content ==
Even if there are numerous factors influencing shopper behaviors, media plays a great role in decision making. Over 90% of consumers receive information about food and biotechnology through popular press and television. For some people, viewing something like a documentary can be so unpleasant that they change their behavior instantly. Some consumers feel intimidated by the strong visuals and communication of mass media,&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, D. V., Honea, H., &amp; Manchanda, R. V. (2003). "The nature of self-reported guilt in consumption contexts." Marketing Letters, 14(3), 159–171&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes leading them to react by rejecting it completely, but sometimes leading to a slow change in practices and habits.&lt;ref&gt;Latour, M. S., &amp; Rotfeld, H. J. (1997). "There are threats and (maybe) fear-caused arousal. Theory and confusions of appeals to fear and fear arousal itself." Journal of Advertising, 26(3), 45–59&lt;/ref&gt; If overall level of media coverage on the risks of food technology increases, it will continue to affect the people who view it. Erving Goffman&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, E. (1974). "''Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience''." New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt; and others have identified the importance of how information is “framed” in risk judgments. Frames provide meaning, and a way of thinking about life, events, and the world in general. Depending on specific frames, judgments about the risks of non organic food can be wildly different. As frames, news stories offer the public various definitions of social reality. Through frames, the media can highlight certain points of view and can marginalize others.&lt;ref&gt;Hornig, S. (1990). “Science stories: Risk, power, and perceived emphasis.” ''Journalism Quarterly'' 67(4), 767S776&lt;/ref&gt;

Organic agriculture is often portrayed in the media as an alternative to allegedly unsafe and environmentally damaging modern agriculture practices.  This means it is usually defined by what it is not (unhealthy, unsafe, etc.) rather than what it is.&lt;ref&gt;Stacey Cahill, Katija Morley, Douglas A. Powell 2010 “Coverage of organic agriculture in North American newspapers, Media: linking food safety, the environment, human health and organic agriculture”&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the issues including health, safety, and the environment, food safety was once the least important in the discussion of organic agriculture in the media, which could be explained by the fact that health and environment have historically been larger drivers in the organic food industry. However, media reporting on the superior health benefits offered by organic foods is continuously assisting the rise of global organic food consumption.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10521">'''Pharmacotoxicology''' entails the study of the consequences of [[Toxin|toxic]] exposure to [[pharmaceutical]] [[drug]]s and agents in the [[health care]] field.  The field of pharmacotoxicology also involves the treatment and prevention of pharmaceutically induced [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]]. Pharmacotoxicology can be separated into two different categories: [[pharmacodynamics]] (the effects of a drug on an organism), and [[pharmacokinetics]] (the effects of the organism on the drug).

==Mechanisms of Pharmaceutical Drug Toxicity==
There are many mechanisms by which pharmaceutical drugs can have toxic implications. A very common mechanism is covalent binding of either the drug or its metabolites to specific enzymes or receptor in tissue-specific pathways that then will elicit toxic responses. Covalent binding can occur during both on-target and off-target situations and after [[biotransformation]].

===On-target toxicity.=== 
On-target toxicity is also referred to as mechanism-based toxicity. This type of adverse effect that results from pharmaceutical drug exposure is commonly due to interactions of the drug with its intended target. In this case, both the therapeutic and toxic targets are the same. To avoid toxicity during treatment, many times the drug needs to be changed to target a different aspect of the illness or symptoms. [[Statins]] are an example of a drug class that can have toxic effects at the therapeutic target ([[HMG CoA reductase]]).&lt;ref name="Guengerich"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guengerich|first1=F. Peter|title=Mechanisms of Drug Toxicity and Relevance to Pharmaceutical Development|journal=Drug Metab Pharmokinet.|date=2011|volume=26|issue=1|pages=3–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immune Responses===
Some pharmaceuticals can initiate allergic reactions, as in the case of [[penicillins]]. In some people, administration of penicillin can induce production of specific antibodies and initiate an immune response. Activation of this response when unwarranted can cause severe health concerns and prevent proper immune system functioning.&lt;ref name="Guengerich" /&gt; Immune responses to pharmaceutical exposure can be very common in accidental contamination events. [[Tamoxifen]], a [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]], has been shown to alter the humoral adaptive immune response in gilthead seabream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodenas|first1=M.C.|last2=Cabas|first2=I.|last3=Abellán|first3=E.|last4=Meseguer|first4=J.|last5=Mulero|first5=V.|last6=García-Ayala|first6=A.|title=Tamoxifen persistently disrupts the humoral adaptive immune response of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.)|journal=Developmental &amp; Comparative Immunology|date=December 2015|volume=53|issue=2|pages=283–292|doi=10.1016/j.dci.2015.06.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, pharmaceuticals can produce adverse effects not only in humans, but also in organisms that are unintentionally exposed.

===Off-target toxicity===
Adverse effects at targets other than those desired for pharmaceutical treatments often occur with drugs that are nonspecific. If a drug can bind to unexpected proteins, receptors, or enzymes that can alter different pathways other than those desired for treatment, severe downstream effects can develop. An example of this is the drug [[eplerenone]] (aldosterone receptor antagonist), which should increase aldosterone levels, but has shown to produce atrophy of the prostate.&lt;ref name="Rudmann"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rudmann|first1=Daniel G.|title=On-target and off-target-based toxicologic effects|journal=Toxicologic Pathology|date=2013|volume=41|pages=310–314|doi=10.1177/0192623312464311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bioactivation===
[[Bioactivation]] is a crucial step in the activity of certain pharmaceuticals. Often times, the parent form of the drug is not the active form and it needs to be metabolized in order to produce its therapeutic effects. In other cases, bioactivation is not necessarily needed for drugs to be active and can instead produce reactive intermediates that initiate stronger adverse effects than the original form of the drug. Bioactivation can occur through the action Phase I metabolic enzymes, such as [[cytochrome P450]] or [[peroxidases]]. Reactive intermediates can cause a loss of function in some enzymatic pathways or can promote the production of [[reactive oxygen species]], both of which can increase stress levels and alter homeostasis.

===Drug-drug interactions===
Drug-drug interactions can occur when certain drugs are administered at the same time. Effects of this can be additive (outcome is greater than those of one individual drug), less than additive (therapeutic effects are less than those of one individual drug), or functional alterations (one drug changes how another is absorbed, distributed, and metabolized).&lt;ref name="Hussar"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hussar|first1=Daniel A.|title=Drug Interactions|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/drugs/factors-affecting-response-to-drugs/drug-interactions|website=Merck Manuals Consumer Version}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug-drug interactions can be of serious concern for patients who are undergoing multi-drug therapies.&lt;ref name="OATPs"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alam|first1=Khondoker|last2=Pahwa|first2=Sonia|last3=Wang|first3=Xueying|last4=Zhang|first4=Pengyue|last5=Ding|first5=Kai|last6=Abuznait|first6=Alaa H.|last7=Li|first7=Lang|last8=Yue|first8=Wei|title=Downregulation of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 transport function by lysosomotropic drug chloroquine: implication of OATP-mediated drug-drug interactions|journal=Molecular Pharmaceutics|date=2016|volume=13|pages=839–851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coadministration of [[chloroquine]], an anti-malaria drug, and statins for treatment of cardiovascular diseases has been shown to cause inhibition of [[organic anion-transporting polypeptide]]s (OATPs) and lead to systemic statin exposure.&lt;ref name="OATPs"/&gt;

==Pharmacotoxicity Examples==
There are many different pharmaceutical drugs that can produce adverse effects after biotransformation, interaction with alternate targets, or through drug-drug interactions. All pharmaceuticals can be toxic, depending on the dose.&lt;ref name="Casarett &amp; Doull's"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Klaassen|editor1-first=Curtis D.|title=Casarett and Doull's toxicology : the basic science of poisons|date=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|location=New York|isbn=0-07-176923-4|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acetaminophen===
[[Acetaminophen]] (APAP) is a very common drug used to treat pain. High doses of acetaminophen has been shown to produce severe [[hepatotoxicity]] after being biotransformed to produce reactive intermediates. Acetaminophen is metabolized by CYP2E1 to produce [[NAPQI]], which then causes significant oxidative stress due to increased [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS).&lt;ref name="Mechanistic"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boelsterli|first1=Urs A.|title=Mechanistic Toxicology the Molecular Basis of How Chemicals Disrupt Biological.|date=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=London|isbn=0-203-36176-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROS can cause cellular damage in a multitude of ways, a few of which being DNA and mitochondrial damage and depletion of antioxidant enzymes such as [[glutathione]]. In terms of drug-drug interactions, acetaminophen activates [[CAR]], a nuclear receptor involved in the production of metabolic enzymes, which increases the metabolism of other drugs. This could either cause reactive intermediates/drug activity to persist for longer than necessary, or the drug will be cleared quicker than normal and prevent any therapeutic actions from occurring. Ethanol induces CYP2E1 enzymes in the liver, which can lead to increased NAPQI formation in addition to that formed by acetaminophen.&lt;ref name="Mechanistic" /&gt;

===Aspirin===
Aspirin is an [[NSAID]] used to treat inflammation and pain. Overdoses or treatments in conjunction with other NSAIDs can produce additive effects, which can lead to increased oxidative stress and ROS activity. Chronic exposure to aspirin can lead to CNS toxicity and eventually affect respiratory function.&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Long|first1=Scott|title=Toxicity of Selected Drugs|url=http://faculty.swosu.edu/scott.long/txcl/drugtox.htm|website=faculty.swosu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-depressants===
Anti-depressants have been prescribed since the 1950s, and their prevalence has significantly increased since then. There are many classes of anti-depressant pharmaceuticals, such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs), and [[tricyclic anti-depressants]]. Many of these drugs, especially the SSRIs, function by blocking the metabolism or reuptake of neurotransmitters to treat depression and anxiety. Chronic exposure or overdose of these pharmaceuticals can lead to seratonin and CNS hyperexcitation, weight changes, and, in severe cases, suicide.&lt;ref name="Long" /&gt;

===Anti-cancer drugs===
[[Doxorubicin]] is a very effective anti-cancer drug that causes congestive heart failure while treating tumors.&lt;ref name="Mechanistic" /&gt; Doxorubicin is an uncoupling agent in that it inhibits proper functioning of complex I of the electron transport chain in mitochondria. It then leads to the production of ROS and the inhibition of ATP production. Doxorubicin has been shown to be selectively toxic to cardiac tissue, although some toxicity has been seen in other tissues as well.&lt;ref name="Mechanistic" /&gt; Other anti-cancer drugs, such as [[fluoropyrimidines]] and [[taxanes]], are extremely effective at treating and reducing tumor proliferation, but have high incidences of cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial infarctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosa|first1=Gian Marco|last2=Gigli|first2=Lorenzo|last3=Tagliasacchi|first3=Maria Isabella|last4=Di Iorio|first4=Cecilia|last5=Carbone|first5=Federico|last6=Nencioni|first6=Alessio|last7=Montecucco|first7=Fabrizio|last8=Brunelli|first8=Claudio|title=Update on cardiotoxicity of anti-cancer treatments|journal=European Journal of Clinical Investigation|date=March 2016|volume=46|issue=3|pages=264–284|doi=10.1111/eci.12589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6383">'''Protected health information''' ('''PHI''') under the US law is any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that is created or collected by a Covered Entity (or a Business Associate of a Covered Entity), and can be linked to a specific individual. This is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient's [[medical record]] or payment history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.netsec.news/definition-hipaa-covered-entity/ Definitions of a Covered Entity]&lt;/ref&gt;

PHI is often sought out in datasets for [[de-identification]] before researchers share the dataset publicly. Researchers remove individually identifiable PHI from a dataset to preserve [[privacy for research participants]].

==United States==
Under the US [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA), PHI that is linked based on the following list of 18 identifiers must be treated with special care:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hipaajournal.com/de-identification-protected-health-information/ |title=De-identification of Protected Heath Information |first= |last= |work=HIPAA Journal |year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
# Names
# All geographical identifiers smaller than a state, except for the initial three digits of a zip code if, according to the current publicly available data from the U.S. Bureau of the Census: the geographic unit formed by combining all zip codes with the same three initial digits contains more than 20,000 people; and the initial three digits of a zip code for all such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people is changed to 000

# [[Biometric]] identifiers, including finger, retinal and voice prints
# Full face photographic images and any comparable images
# Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code except the unique code assigned by the investigator to code the data
{{div col end}}

===De-identification versus anonymization===
'''Anonymization''' is a process in which PHI elements are eliminated or manipulated with the purpose of hindering the possibility of going back to the original data set.&lt;ref name="Ohm"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ohm|first=Paul|date=August 2010|title=Broken Promises of Privacy: Responding to the Surprising Failure of Anonymization|journal=[[UCLA Law Review]]|volume=57|issue=6|pages=1701–1777}}&lt;/ref&gt; This involves removing all identifying data to create unlinkable data.&lt;ref name="healthcare.partners.org"&gt;http://healthcare.partners.org/phsirb/hipaaglos.htm#g3&lt;/ref&gt;
'''De-identification''' under the HIPAA Privacy Rule occurs when data has been stripped of common identifiers by two methods:
:1. The removal of 18 specific identifiers listed above (Safe Harbor Method)
:2. Obtain the expertise of an experienced statistical expert to validate and document the statistical risk of re-identification is very small (Statistical Method).&lt;ref name="CDT2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdt.org/files/healthprivacy/20090625_deidentify.pdf|title=Encouraging the Use of, and Rethinking Protections for De-Identified (and "Anonymized") Health Data|date=June 2009|publisher=[[Center for Democracy and Technology]]|accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hipaa.wisc.edu/ResearchGuide/deidentification.html|title=HIPAA: What? De-identification of Protected Health Information (PHI)|date=August 26, 2003|work=HIPAA Research Guide|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison|accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De-identified data is coded, with a link to the original, fully identified data set kept by an [[honest broker]]. Links exist in coded de-identified data making the data considered indirectly  identifiable and not anonymized.  Coded de-identified data is not protected by the [[HIPAA]] Privacy Rule, but is protected under the [[Common Rule]].   The purpose of de-identification and anonymization is to use health care data in larger increments, for research purposes.  Universities,  government agencies, and private health care entities use such data for research, development and marketing purposes.&lt;ref name="healthcare.partners.org"/&gt;

'''Covered Entities'''

In general, US law governing PHI applies to data collected in the course of providing and paying for health care.  Privacy and security regulations govern how healthcare professionals, hospitals, health insurers, and other Covered Entities use and protect the data they collect.  It is important to understand that the source of the data is as relevant as the data itself when determining if information is PHI under U.S. law.  For example, sharing information about someone on the street with an obvious medical condition such as an amputation is not restricted by US law.  However, obtaining information about the amputation exclusively from a protected source, such as from an electronic medical record, would breach HIPAA regulations.

'''Business Associates''' 

Covered Entities often use third parties to provide certain health and business services.  If they need to share PHI with those third parties, it is the responsibility of the Covered Entity to put in place a Business Associate Agreement that holds the third party to the same standards of privacy and confidentiality as the Covered Entity.

'''Psychological testing''' is the administration of psychological tests, which are designed to be "an objective and standardized measure of a sample of behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Psychological testing|last=Urbina|first=Susana|last2=Anastasi|first2=Anne|date=|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1997|isbn=9780023030857|edition=7th|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|pages=4|oclc=35450434}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''sample of behavior'' refers to an individual's performance on tasks that have usually been prescribed beforehand. The samples of behavior that make up a paper-and-pencil test, the most common type of test, are a series of items. Performance on these items produce a test score. A score on a well-constructed test is believed to reflect a [[psychological construct]] such as achievement in a  school subject, [[cognitive ability]], [[aptitude]], emotional functioning, [[personality]], etc. Differences in test scores are thought to reflect individual differences in the construct the test is supposed to measure. The science behind psychological testing is [[psychometrics]].

==Psychological tests==
A psychological test is an instrument designed to measure unobserved constructs, also known as [[latent variables]]. Psychological tests are typically, but not necessarily, a series of tasks or problems that the respondent has to solve. Psychological tests can strongly resemble [[questionnaires]], which are also designed to measure unobserved constructs, but differ in that psychological tests ask for a respondent's maximum performance whereas a questionnaire asks for the respondent's typical performance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gideon J. Mellenbergh|Mellenbergh, G.J.]] (2008). Chapter 10: Surveys. In [[H.J. Adèr]] &amp; [[G.J. Mellenbergh]] (Eds.) (with contributions by D.J. Hand), Advising on Research Methods: A consultant's companion (pp. 183-209). Huizen, The Netherlands: Johannes van Kessel Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; A useful psychological test must be both [[test validity|valid]] (i.e., there is evidence to support the specified interpretation of the test results&lt;ref&gt;American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, &amp; National Council on Measurement in Education. (1999). ''Standards for educational and psychological testing''. Washington, DC: American Educational Research Association.&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[reliability (psychometric)|reliable]] (i.e., internally consistent or give consistent results over time, across raters, etc.).

It is important that people who are equal on the measured construct also have an equal probability of answering the test items accurately
.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mellenbergh|first=Gideon J.|date=1989|title=Item bias and item response theory|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0883035589900025|journal=International Journal of Educational Research|volume=13|issue=2|pages=127–143|doi=10.1016/0883-0355(89)90002-5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an item on a mathematics test could be "In a soccer match two players get a red card; how many players are left in the end?"; however, this item also requires knowledge of soccer to be answered correctly, not just mathematical ability. Group membership can also influence the chance of correctly answering items ([[differential item functioning]]). Often tests are constructed for a specific population, and this should be taken into account when administering tests. If a test is invariant to some group difference (e.g. gender) in one population (e.g. England) it does not automatically mean that it is also invariant in another population (e.g. Japan).

[[Psychological assessment]] is similar to psychological testing but usually involves a more comprehensive assessment of the individual. Psychological assessment is a process that involves checking the integration of information from multiple sources, such as tests of normal and abnormal personality, tests of ability or intelligence, tests of interests or attitudes, as well as information from personal interviews. Collateral information is also collected about personal, occupational, or [[medical history]], such as from records or from interviews with parents, spouses, teachers, or previous therapists or physicians. A ''psychological test'' is one of the sources of data used within the process of assessment; usually more than one test is used. Many psychologists do some level of assessment when providing services to clients or patients, and may use for example, simple checklists to osis for treatment settings; to assess a particular area of functioning or disability often for school settings; to help select type of treatment or to assess treatment outcomes; to help courts decide issues such as child custody or competency to stand trial; or to help assess job applicants or employees and provide career development counseling or training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006|title=Standards for Education and Training in Psychological Assessment|url=http://storage.jason-mohr.com/www.personality.org/General/pdf/06/SPA%20(2006,%20JPA)%20Standards%20for%20Education%20and%20Training%20in%20Assessment.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality Assessment|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|volume=87|issue=3|pages=355–357|via=|doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa8703_17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Physiognomy.jpg|thumb|right|Physiognomy was used to assess personality traits based on an individual's outer appearance.]]
The first large-scale tests may have been examinations that were part of the [[imperial examination]] system in China. The test, an early form of psychological testing, assessed candidates based on their proficiency in topics such as civil law and fiscal policies.&lt;ref name="gregory"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert J.

It contributed to separating [[Intellectual disability|mental retardation]] from [[mental illness]] and reducing the neglect, torture, and ridicule heaped on both groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=IQ testing 101|last=Kaufman|first=Alan S.,|date=|publisher=Springer Pub. Co|year=2009|isbn=0826106293|location=|pages=|oclc=255892649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Englishman [[Francis Galton]] coined the terms [[psychometrics]] and [[eugenics]], and developed a method for measuring intelligence based on nonverbal sensory-motor tests. It was initially popular, but was abandoned after the discovery that it had no relationship to outcomes such as college grades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gillham |first1=Nicholas W. |title=Sir Francis Galton and the birth of eugenics |journal=Annual Review of Genetics |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=83–101 |year=2001 |pmid=11700278 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.35.102401.090055}}&lt;/ref&gt; French psychologist [[Alfred Binet]], together with psychologists Victor Henri and [[Théodore Simon]], after about 15 years of development, published the [[Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales|Binet-Simon test]] in 1905, which focused on verbal abilities. It was intended to identify mental retardation in school children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The origins of [[personality testing]] date back to the 18th and 19th centuries, when personality was assessed through [[phrenology]], the measurement of the human skull, and [[physiognomy]], which assessed personality based on a person's outer appearances.&lt;ref name="psychassess"/&gt; These early pseudoscientific techniques were eventually replaced with more empirical methods in the 20th century. One of the earliest modern personality tests was the Woolworth Personality Data Sheet, a [[self-report inventory]] developed for [[World War I]] and used for the psychiatric screening of new draftees.&lt;ref name="psychassess"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Psychological Assessment|first=Elahe|first2=James N.|date=16 February 2000|publisher=Elsevier|year=|isbn=978-0-08-054002-3|editor-first=G.|location=|page=415|pages=|editor-first2=Michel|author1=Nezami|author2=Butcher|editor1=Goldstein|editor2=Hersen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
Proper psychological testing is conducted after vigorous research and development in contrast to quick web-based or magazine questionnaires that say "Find out your Personality Color," or "What's your Inner Age?" Proper psychological testing consists of the following:
:* ''Standardization'' - All procedures and steps must be conducted with consistency and under the same environment to achieve the same testing performance from those being tested.
:* ''Objectivity'' - Scoring such that subjective judgments and biases are minimized, with results for each test taker obtained in the same way.
:* ''Test Norms'' - The average test score within a large group of people where the performance of one individual can be compared to the results of others by establishing a point of comparison or frame of reference.
:* ''Reliability'' - Obtaining the same result after multiple testing.
:* ''Validity'' - The type of test being administered must measure what it is intended to measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/318765451|title=Psychology and work today: An introduction to industrial and organizational psychology|last=Schultz|first=Duane P.|last2=Schultz|first2=Sydney Ellen|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2010|isbn=0205683584|edition=10th|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|pages=99–102|oclc=318765451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpreting scores==
Psychological tests, like many measurements of human characteristics, can be interpreted in a ''norm-referenced'' or ''criterion-referenced'' manner. Norms are statistical representations of a population. A [[Norm-referenced test|norm-referenced]] score interpretation compares an individual's results on the test with the statistical representation of the population. In practice, rather than testing a population, a representative sample or group is tested. This provides a group norm or set of norms. One representation of norms is the [[Normal distribution|Bell curve]] (also called "normal curve"). Norms are available for standardized psychological tests, allowing for an understanding of how an individual's scores compare with the group norms. Norm referenced scores are typically reported on the [[standard score]] (z) scale or a rescaling of it.

A [[Criterion-referenced test|criterion-referenced]] interpretation of a test score compares an individual's performance to some criterion other than performance of other individuals.  For example, the generic school [[test (student assessment)|test]] typically provides a score in reference to a subject domain; a student might score 80% on a geography test.  Criterion-referenced score interpretations are generally more applicable to [[Achievement test|achievement]] tests rather than psychological tests.

Often, test scores can be interpreted in both ways; answering 80% of the questions correctly on a geography test could place a student at the 84th percentile (that is, the student performed better than 83% of the class and worse than 16% of the classmates), or a standard score of 1.0 or even 2.0.

==Types==
There are several broad categories of psychological tests:

===IQ/achievement tests===

[[IQ test]]s purport to be measures of [[intelligence]], while [[achievement test]]s are measures of the use and level of development of use of the ability. [[IQ]] (or cognitive) tests and [[achievement test]]s are common norm-referenced tests. In these types of tests, a series of tasks is presented to the person being evaluated, and the person's responses are graded according to carefully prescribed guidelines. After the test is completed, the results can be compiled and compared to the responses of a norm group, usually composed of people at the same age or grade level as the person being evaluated. IQ tests which contain a series of tasks typically divide the tasks into [[Words|verbal]] (relying on the use of language) and performance, or non-verbal (relying on eye–hand types of tasks, or use of symbols or objects). Examples of verbal IQ test tasks are vocabulary and information (answering general knowledge questions). Non-verbal examples are timed completion of puzzles (object assembly) and identifying images which fit a pattern (matrix reasoning).

IQ tests (e.g., [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS-IV]], [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC-V]], [[Cattell Culture Fair III]], [[Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities]]-IV, [[Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales]] V) and academic achievement tests (e.g. [[Wechsler Individual Achievement Test|WIAT]], [[Wide Range Achievement Test|WRAT]], Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement-III) are designed to be administered to either an individual (by a trained evaluator) or to a group of people (paper and pencil tests). The individually administered tests tend to be more comprehensive, more reliable, more valid and generally to have better [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] characteristics than group-administered tests. However, individually administered tests are more expensive to administer because of the need for a trained administrator (psychologist, [[school psychologist]], or [[psychometrician]]).

===Public safety employment tests===

Vocations within the public safety field (i.e., fire service, law enforcement, corrections, emergency medical services) often require [[Industrial and Organizational Psychology]] tests for initial employment and advancement throughout the ranks. The [[National Firefighter Selection Inventory - NFSI]], the [[National Criminal Justice Officer Selection Inventory - NCJOSI]], and the [[Integrity Inventory]] are prominent examples of these tests.

===Attitude tests===

Attitude test assess an individual's feelings about an event, person, or object.  Attitude scales are used in marketing to determine individual (and group) preferences for brands, or items. Typically attitude tests use either a [[Thurstone scale]], or [[Likert Scale]] to measure specific items.

===Neuropsychological tests===
{{main|Neuropsychological test}}

These tests consist of specifically designed tasks used to measure a psychological function known to be linked to a particular brain structure or pathway. Neuropsychological tests can be used in a [[clinical neuropsychology|clinical context]] to assess impairment after an [[brain damage|injury]] or illness known to affect [[neurocognitive]] functioning. When used in research, these tests can be used to contrast neuropsychological abilities across experimental groups.

'''Infant and Preschool Assessment'''

Due to the fact that infants and preschool aged children have limited capacities of communication, psychologists are unable to use traditional tests to assess them.  Therefore, many tests have been designed just for children ages birth to around six years of age. These tests usually vary with age respectively from assessments of reflexes and developmental milestones, to sensory and motor skills, language skills, and simple cognitive skills.

Common tests for this age group are split into categories: Infant Ability, Preschool Intelligence, and School Readiness.
Common infant ability tests include: [[Gesell Developmental Schedules]] (GDS) which measures the developmental progress of infants, Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) which tests newborn behavior, reflexes, and responses, Ordinal Scales of Psychological Development (OSPD) which assesses infant intellectual abilities, and Bayley-III which tests mental ability and motor skills.

Common preschool intelligence tests include: [[McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA)|McCarthy Scales of Children’s Abilities]] (MSCA) which is similar to an infant IQ test, Differential Ability Scales (DAS) which can be used to test for learning disability, Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III (WPPSI-III) and Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales for Early Childhood which could be seen as infant versions of IQ tests, and Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence (FTII) which tests recognition memory.

Finally, some common school readiness tests are: Developmental Indicators for the Assessment of Learning-III (DIAL-III) which assesses motor, cognitive, and language skills, Denver II which tests motor, social, and language skills, and Home Observation for Measurement of Environment (HOME) which is a measure of the extent to which a child’s home environment facilitates school readiness.

Infant and preschool assessments, since they do not predict later childhood nor adult abilities, are mainly useful for testing if a child is experiencing developmental delay or disabilities. They are also useful for testing individual intelligence and ability, and, as aforementioned, there are some specifically designed to test school readiness and determine which children may struggle more in school.

===Personality tests===
{{main|Personality test}}

Psychological measures of personality are often described as either [[objective test]]s or [[projective test]]s. The terms "objective test" and "projective test" have recently come under criticism in the Journal of Personality Assessment. The more descriptive "rating scale or self-report measures" and "free response measures" are suggested, rather than the terms "objective tests" and "projective tests," respectively.

====Objective tests (Rating scale or self-report measure)====

Objective tests have a restricted response format, such as allowing for true or false answers or rating using an ordinal scale. Prominent examples of objective personality tests include the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]], [[Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory|Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-IV]],&lt;ref&gt;Millon, T. (1994). ''Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III.'' Minneapolis, MN: National Computer Systems.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Child Behavior Checklist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manual for the ASEBA school-age forms &amp; profiles: An integrated system of multi-informant assessment|last=Achenbach|first=T.

K.|publisher=[[Psychological Corporation]]|year=1996|isbn=|edition=2nd|location=San Antonio, TX|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objective personality tests can be designed for use in [[business]] for potential employees, such as the NEO-PI, the 16PF, and the [[Occupational Personality Questionnaires|OPQ]] (Occupational Personality Questionnaire), all of which are based on the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] taxonomy. The Big Five, or Five Factor Model of normal personality, has gained acceptance since the early 1990s when some influential meta-analyses (e.g., Barrick &amp; Mount 1991) found consistent relationships between the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five personality factors]] and important criterion variables.

Another personality test based upon the Five Factor Model is the Five Factor Personality Inventory – Children (FFPI-C.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGhee|first=R. L.|last2=Ehrler|first2=D. J.|last3=Buckhalt|first3=J.

====Projective tests (Free response measures)====

Projective tests allow for a freer type of response. An example of this would be the [[Rorschach test]], in which a person states what each of ten ink blots might be.

Projective testing became a growth industry in the first half of the 1900s, with doubts about the theoretical assumptions behind projective testing arising in the second half of the 1900s.&lt;ref name="Wasserman"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_Z_rgY-Qb-sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=nonverbal+assessment#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Handbook of Nonverbal Assessment|first=Wasserman|publisher=Kluwer Academic / Plenum Publishers|year=2003|isbn=0-306-47715-7|editor-first=Steve R.|pages=|chapter=Nonverbal Assessment of Personality and Psychopathology|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

As improved sampling and statistical methods developed, much controversy regarding the utility and validity of projective testing has occurred. The use of clinical judgement rather than norms and statistics to evaluate people's characteristics has raised criticism that projectives are deficient and unreliable (results are too dissimilar each time a test is given to the same person). However, as more objective scoring and interpretive systems supported by more rigorous scientific research have emerged, many practitioners continue to rely on projective testing. Projective tests may be useful in creating inferences to follow up with other methods. The most widely used scoring system for the Rorschach is the  [[Exner system of scoring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471419834.html|title=The Rorschach: A comprehensive system|last=Exner, Jr.|first=John E.|last2=Erdberg|first2=Phillip|date=|publisher=Wiley|year=2005|isbn=9780471419839|edition=3rd|volume=2|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=|oclc=27725493|orig-year=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common projective test is the [[Thematic Apperception Test]] (TAT),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thematic Apperception Test manual.|last=Murray|first=Henry A.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1943|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=|oclc=223083}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is often scored with Westen's Social Cognition and Object Relations Scales&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westen|first=Drew|date=May 1991|title=Social cognition and object relations|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=109|issue=3|pages=429–455|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.109.3.429|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Phebe Cramer]]'s Defense Mechanisms Manual.&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, P. (2002). ''Defense Mechanism Manual, revised June 2002.'' Unpublished manuscript, Williams College. (Available from Dr. Phebe Cramer.)&lt;/ref&gt; Both "rating scale" and "free response" measures are used in contemporary clinical practice, with a trend toward the former.

Other projective tests include the [[House-Tree-Person test]], the [[Animal Metaphor Test]].

===Sexological tests===
{{main|Sexological testing}}

The number of tests specifically meant for the field of sexology is quite limited. The field of [[sexology]] provides different psychological evaluation devices in order to examine the various aspects of the discomfort, problem or dysfunction, regardless of whether they are individual or relational ones.

===Direct observation tests===
Although most psychological tests are "rating scale" or "free response" measures, psychological assessment may also involve the observation of people as they complete activities. This type of assessment is usually conducted with families in a laboratory, home or with children in a classroom. The purpose may be clinical, such as to establish a pre-intervention baseline of a child's hyperactive or aggressive classroom behaviors or to observe the nature of a parent-child interaction in order to understand a relational disorder. Direct observation procedures are also used in research, for example to study the relationship between intrapsychic variables and specific target behaviors, or to explore sequences of behavioral interaction.

The Parent-Child Interaction Assessment-II (PCIA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holigrocki | first1 = R. J | last2 = Kaminski | first2 = P. L. | last3 = Frieswyk | first3 = S.

===Interest tests===
Psychological tests to assess a person’s interests and preferences. These tests are used primarily for career counseling. Interest tests include items about daily activities from among which applicants select their preferences. The rationale is that if a person exhibits the same pattern of interests and preferences as people who are successful in a given occupation, then the chances are high that the person taking the test will find satisfaction in that occupation. A widely used interest test is the [[Strong Interest Inventory]], which is used in career assessment, career counseling, and educational guidance.

===Aptitude tests===
Psychological tests measure specific abilities, such as clerical, perceptual, numerical, or spatial aptitude. Sometimes these tests must be specially designed for a particular job, but there are also tests available that measure general clerical and mechanical aptitudes, or even general learning ability. An example of an occupational aptitude test is the Minnesota Clerical Test, which measures the perceptual speed and accuracy required to perform various clerical duties. Other widely used aptitude tests include [[Careerscope]], the [[Differential Aptitude Tests]] (DAT), which assess  verbal reasoning, numerical ability, abstract Reasoning, clerical speed and accuracy, mechanical reasoning, space relations, spelling and language usage. Another widely used test of aptitudes is the [[Wonderlic Test]]. These aptitudes are believed to be related to specific occupations and are used for career guidance as well as selection and recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tests and examinations: Measuring abilities and performance|last=Aiken|first=Lewis R.|date=|publisher=Wiley|year=1998|isbn=9780471192633|location=|pages=|oclc=37820003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biographical Information Blank===
The [[Biographical Information Blanks]] or BIB is a paper-and-pencil form that includes items that ask about detailed personal and work history. It is used to aid in the hiring of employees by matching the backgrounds of individuals to requirements of the job.

==Test security==
Many psychological tests are generally not available to the public, but rather, have restrictions both from publishers of the tests and from psychology licensing boards that prevent the disclosure of the tests themselves and information about the interpretation of the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/science/securetests.html |publisher=American Psychological Association |year=1994 |quote=It should be recognized that certain tests used by psychologists and related professionals may suffer irreparable harm to their validity if their items, scoring keys or protocols, and other materials are publicly disclosed. |title=Statement on the Use of Secure Psychological Tests in the Education of Graduate and Undergraduate Psychology Students |author=The Committee on Psychological Tests and Assessment (CPTA), American Psychological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://acn.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/24/7/635 |title=Test Security in Medicolegal Cases: Proposed Guidelines for Attorneys Utilizing Neuropsychology Practice |author=Kenneth R.

The International Test Commission (ITC), an international association of national psychological societies and test publishers, publishes the ''International Guidelines for Test Use'', which prescribes to "protect the integrity" of the tests by not publicly describing test techniques and by not "coaching individuals" so that they "might unfairly influence their test performance."&lt;ref&gt;International Test Commission (2000) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090718001741/http://www.intestcom.org/Guidelines/Test+Use.php ''International Guidelines for Test Use'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pyridoxamine''' is one form of [[vitamin B6|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Chemically it is based on a [[pyridine]] ring structure, with [[hydroxyl]], [[methyl]], [[aminomethyl]], and [[hydroxymethyl]] [[substituent]]s. It differs from pyridoxine by the substituent at the 4-position. The [[phenol]] at position 3 and aminomethyl group at position 4 of its ring endow pyridoxamine with a variety of chemical properties, including the [[Scavenger (chemistry)|scavenging]] of [[free radical]] species and carbonyl species formed in sugar and lipid degradation and [[chelation]] of metal ions that catalyze [[Amadori rearrangement|Amadori reactions]].&lt;ref name="Adrover et al"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Adrover M, Vilanova B, Frau J, Muñoz F, Donoso J |title=The pyridoxamine action on Amadori compounds: A reexamination of its scavenging capacity and chelating effect |journal=Bioorg.

Pyridoxamine can form fairly weak complexes with a number of transition metal ions, with a preference for [[copper|Cu]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and [[Iron (element)|Fe]]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Voziyan &amp; Hudson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Voziyan PA, Hudson BG |title=Pyridoxamine as a multifunctional pharmaceutical: targeting pathogenic glycation and oxidative damage |journal=Cell.

==FDA Regulatory Activity==
Pyridoxamine was marketed as a [[dietary supplement]], often as the [[hydrochloride]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]], pyridoxamine dihydrochloride. However, in the [[United States]], the FDA ruled in January 2009 that pyridoxamine must be regulated as a pharmaceutical drug because it is the active ingredient in Pyridorin, a drug designed by Biostratum, Inc., to prevent the progression of [[diabetic nephropathy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsfood.com/?location=English&amp;item=55070 "FDA finds vitamin B6 form not legal in supplements"], newsfood.com, February 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TBJ&gt;[http://triangle.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/2005/10/17/story2.html "Big problem for BioStratum"], ''[[Triangle Business Journal]]'', October 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Entrepreneur&gt;[http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/198862195.html "FDA's pyridoxamine decision: FDA's decision regarding pyridoxamine has larger implications for dietary ingredients in general"], ''[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]'', April, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FDA-2005-P-0259-0004 Regulations.gov&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyridorin had success in early clinical trials, found to be effective in slowing the progression of diabetic neuropathy in a phase II trial on 224 patients.&lt;ref name=TBJ/&gt; However, in 2005 Biostratum ran out of money and so was unable to begin a Phase III trial.&lt;ref name=TBJ/&gt;  Investors in Biostratum had realized that because Biostratum had no patent on pyridoxamine itself, and that pyridoxamine was commonly available for purchase as a dietary supplement, the company would be unable to charge enough money for the treatment (should it be approved as a prescription drug by the FDA) for the investors to get a reasonable return on the investment they had already made (about $100M) much less on the additional investment a Phase III trial would require.&lt;ref name=TBJ/&gt; To solve this problem, Biostratum submitted a [[citizen petition]] to the FDA on July 29, 2005, seeking to disallow sales of pyridoxamine-containing supplements on the grounds that pyridoxamine, as the subject of an Investigational New Drug Application with the FDA, is a drug and not a dietary supplement.&lt;ref name=TBJ/&gt; This petition was opposed by the [[Council for Responsible Nutrition]], a [[trade association]] of the dietary supplement industry.&lt;ref name=TBJ/&gt;

On January 12, 2009, the FDA ruled that products containing pyridoxamine are excluded from the definition of dietary supplements as defined by the [[Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994]].&lt;ref name=Entrepreneur/&gt; The FDA stated that the status of Pyridorin as an investigational new drug, as a result of an application filed by BioStratum in July 1999 and effective on September 1, 1999, meant that "the marketing of pyridoxamine in a dietary supplement is essentially equivalent to the marketing of an investigational new drug as a dietary supplement" because there was an "absence of independent, verifiable evidence that the substance was marketed as a food or a dietary supplement prior to its authorization for investigation as a new drug."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FDA-2005-P-0259-0004 FDA-2005-P-0259-0004]: FDA Response to Biostratum, Inc. (Kathleen M Sanzo, Esq) - Petition Partial Approved and Denial&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Biostratum licensed its rights in Pyridorin to another company, NephroGenex &lt;ref&gt;http://www.renalbusiness.com/news/2006/05/nephrogenex-acquires-rights-to-diabetic-nephropat.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, NephroGenex restarted the clinical development of Pyridorin, which as of 2012 is still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nephrogenex.com/NGX_News.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125052710/http://www.nephrogenex.com/NGX_News.htm |archivedate=2012-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patenting Activity==
A [[patent application]] claiming pharmaceutical compositions of pyridoxamine, and methods to use pyridoxamine to treat diabetic complications, was filed by Biostratum and was published in 2004.&lt;ref name=patent&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?wo=2004112788 (WO/2004/112788) PYRIDOXAMINE FOR THE TREATMENT OF DIABETIC KIDNEY DISEASE], [[World Intellectual Property Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The application does not claim pyridoxamine itself.

Rich Sr. |date=February 17, 2006  |page=10B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Buffalo, New York]], he founded [[Rich Products]] in 1945, which had sales of $2.5 billion on more than 2,300 products in 2005,&lt;ref name=Obit.NYT/&gt; the year before he died at age 92 in [[Palm Beach, Florida]]. His son, [[Robert E. Rich Jr.|Robert Jr.]], inherited the company and is the owner of the [[Buffalo Bisons]] [[Minor League Baseball|minor league baseball]] team.

==Biography==
Rich attended [[Bennett High School, New York|Bennett High School]] in Buffalo, where his father, Pal Rich,&lt;ref name=Food.NYT&gt;{{cite web  |website=NYTimes.com |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/magazine/31food_rich.t.html
|title=Food: The Nondairy Dairy Man}}&lt;/ref&gt; owned an ice cream plant. He received his undergraduate education from the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]], where he was captain of both football and wrestling. He was also a member of [[Alpha Kappa Psi]] and Bisonhead, an all-male [[secret society]] on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1935 Buffalonian|url=http://digital.lib.buffalo.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/LIB-UA010/id/74/rec/1|publisher=Buffalonian of the University of Buffalo|accessdate=22 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130403060943/http://digital.lib.buffalo.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/LIB-UA010/id/74/rec/1|archivedate=3 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later inducted into the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]] Athletic Hall of Fame.

After borrowing money from his father, he started the Wilbur Dairy Company (later renamed the Jones-Rich Milk Company) in 1935. The success of his cream substitute brought a series of lawsuits from the dairy industry in an effort to stop distribution of his product. Rich prevailed in every case. At his death, he was one of the wealthiest people in the world, reportedly worth $2 billion,&lt;ref&gt;"Forbes reported his net worth at $2.5 billion.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Food.NYT/&gt; and his company was the largest family-owned food products company in America.

==Sports properties==
Rich owned three [[Minor League Baseball|minor league baseball]] teams, most notably the [[Buffalo Bisons]], Triple-A [[International League]] affiliate of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]].&lt;ref&gt;http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120918&amp;content_id=38603918&amp;vkey=pr_tor&amp;c_id=tor&amp;partnerId=aw-4764878935764618869-1046&lt;/ref&gt; The other two teams are the [[Northwest Arkansas Naturals]] (Double-A affiliate of the [[Kansas City Royals]]), and the [[West Virginia Black Bears]] (formerly the [[Jamestown Jammers]], the Single-A Short Season affiliate of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.milb.com/team4/page.jsp?ymd=20070301&amp;content_id=184959&amp;vkey=team4_t489&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;sid=t489&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pittsburgh.pirates.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120918&amp;content_id=38607832&amp;vkey=pr_pit&amp;c_id=pit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20141022&amp;content_id=99261150&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;vkey=pr_milb&amp;sid=milb&lt;/ref&gt;

His older son continued this, and added some sponsorships:
* On November 4, 2010, Bob Rich announced that Rich Products shall be the official kit sponsor of the English Northern League Division One team [[Bedlington Terriers F.C.]]&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11698291]&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2013, Rich's Farm Rich brand became sponsor for [[Front Row Motorsports]]' [[David Ragan]] in the [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]], and in its first race as sponsor, Ragan won the [[2013 Aaron's 499]] at [[Talladega Superspeedway]]; Farm Rich again served as Ragan's sponsor at [[Richmond International Raceway]] in the [[2013 Federated Auto Parts 400]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Rich's==
{{main article|Rich Products}}

Due to pressure from the dairy industry, Rich Products was sued in 36 states, the founder's older son [[Robert E. Rich Jr.]] said,&lt;ref name=Food.NYT/&gt; and won 40 out of 41 cases.&lt;ref name=Not41&gt;{{cite web

"The elder Rich was considered one of the founding fathers of the frozen food industry" is how a local business newspaper summarized his business success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |newspaper=Buffalo Business First

'''''Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine''''' is a 1961 [[LP album|LP]] featuring [[Ronald Reagan]].  In this more than ten-minute recording, Reagan "criticized Social Security for ''supplanting'' private savings and warned that subsidized medicine would curtail Americans' freedom" and that "pretty soon your son won't decide when he's in school, where he will go or what he will do for a living. He will wait for the government to tell him."&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/16/magazine/16SOCIAL.html|title=A Question of Numbers|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|author=Roger Lowenstein|date=2005-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Lowenstein]] called the LP part of a "stealth program" conducted by the [[American Medical Association]] (see [[Operation Coffee Cup]]).&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

==Summary==
Reagan opens by saying that in 1927 [[socialist]] [[Norman Thomas]] said that the American people would never vote for [[socialism]], but "under the name of [[liberalism]] the American people would adopt every fragment of the socialist program." [[Snopes.com]] calls this attribution probably false, arguing that "no one has ever been able to turn up a source".&lt;ref name="snopes socialism"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Mikkleson | first = Barbara | authorlink = |author2=David P. Mikkleson  | title = Norman Thomas on Socialism | work = Snopes.com | publisher = Snopes.com | date = February 2009 | url = http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/socialism.asp | accessdate = 22 Dec 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan says that "Government has invaded the free precincts of private citizens," stating that the U.S. government owns "1/5 of the total industrial capacity of the United States." Reagan says "One of the traditional methods of imposing [[statism]] or socialism on a people has been by way of [[medicine]]. It's very easy to disguise a medical program as a humanitarian project, most people are a little reluctant to oppose anything that suggests medical care for people who possibly can't afford it." Reagan cites the failure of president [[Harry S. Truman]]'s [[national health insurance]] proposal as evidence of the American people's rejection of [[socialized medicine]].

Reagan describes Representative [[Aime Forand]] as having introduced a bill which would institute "compulsory health insurance" for all people of social security age. Forand is quoted as having said, "If we can only break through and get our foot inside the door, then we can extend the program after that." Forand is likened to [[labor union]] leader [[Walter Reuther]], who is quoted as having said, "It's no secret that the [[United Automobile Workers]] is officially on record of backing a program of national health insurance." The Forand bill is described as being praised by socialists: "They say once the Forand bill is passed this nation will be provided with a mechanism for socialized medicine capable of indefinite expansion in every direction until it includes the entire population. Now we can't say we haven't been warned."

Reagan describes Representative [[Cecil R. King]] of California as the successor to Congressman Forand in his support for a bill that would provide [[senior citizens]] with medical care. (The 1962 King-[[Clinton Presba Anderson|Anderson]] bill is often described as a precursor to the [[Social Security Act of 1965]], which established [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].) Reagan cites the expansion of private health insurance and the passage of the 1960 [[Robert S. Kerr|Kerr]]-[[Wilbur Mills|Mills]] Act, which provided federal funds to states to cover the "medically needy," as evidence that King's legislation is unnecessary. Reagan concludes that the new bill is "simply an excuse to bring about what they wanted all the time: socialized medicine." Reagan warns against the danger of encroaching on the relationship between patients and doctors, and of an attack on doctors' freedoms.

Reagan encourages his listeners to join a letter-writing campaign to Congress with the message, "We do not want socialized medicine." Reagan quotes Representative [[Charles A. Halleck]] of Indiana as having said, "When the American people wants something from Congress, regardless of its political complexion, if they make their wants known, Congress does what the people want." Reagan warns that if his listeners do not stop the proposed medical program, "behind it will come other government programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country until one day as Norman Thomas said we will wake to find that we have socialism." Under this scenario, Reagan says, "We are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free."

== Criticism ==
In 1966 Governor [[Pat Brown]], campaigning for re-election against Reagan, said of Reagan's speech about socialized medicine, that Reagan was "an enemy of social progress," who had "hired" out to the American Medical Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brown Lashes Out at Reagan's Medicare Stand |publisher=UPI |work=Lodi News-Sentinel |date=October 17, 1966 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CWgzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pzIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4456,1255209&amp;dq=ronald-reagan+medicare&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Reagan accused him of "pure demagoguery" in suggesting that California's elderly had reason to fear a Reagan victory in the race for governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reagan Assails Brown's Charge on Old-Age Aid; He Accuses Governor of Demagoguery in Picturing Him as Foe of Programs |work=Los Angeles Times |author=Richard Bergholz |date=October 18, 1966 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/486005842.html?dids=486005842:486005842&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+18%2C+1966&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Reagan+Assails+Brown%27s+Charge+on+Old-Age+Aid&amp;pqatl=google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 President [[Jimmy Carter]], campaigning for re-election against Reagan, told crowds that: "As a traveling salesman for the American Medical Association campaign against Medicare, [Reagan] sowed the fear that Medicare would mean socialism and that it would lead to the destruction of our freedom."  When the subject arose in a televised debate in late October, Reagan responded: "When I opposed Medicare, there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before Congress.  I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought it would be better for the senior citizens. ... I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them..." Carter's campaign accused Reagan of "rewriting history", saying that there was no such alternative legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work = The Pittsburgh Press |date=November 1, 1980 |author=James P.

'''Salt water chlorination''' is a process that uses dissolved [[salt]] (2,500–6,000 [[parts per million|ppm]]) as a store for the [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woodhurst|first=Kevin|title=Chlorine Generators: A Salt-Water Pool is Often the Pool of Choice|url=http://phoenix.about.com/cs/wet/a/saltpool01.htm|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chlorine generator (also known as salt cell, salt generator, salt chlorinator or SWG) uses [[electrolysis]] in the presence of dissolved salt ([[Sodium chloride|NaCl]]) to produce hypochlorous acid ([[Hypochlorous acid|HClO]]) and sodium hypochlorite ([[Sodium hypochlorite|NaClO]]), which are the sanitizing agents already commonly used in swimming pools. As such, a saltwater pool is not actually chlorine-free; it simply utilizes added salt and a chlorine generator instead of direct addition of chlorine.

== Distinction from traditional pool chlorination ==
The presence of chlorine in traditional swimming pools can be described as a combination of free available chlorine (FAC) and combined available chlorine (CAC).&lt;ref name="Donegan"&gt;{{cite book | title=Pools and Spas: Planning, Designing, Maintaining, Landscaping | publisher=Creative Homeowner | author=David Short, Fran J. Donegan | year=2012 | location=Upper Saddle River, NJ | pages=239 | isbn=1-58011-391-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While FAC is composed of the free chlorine that is available for sanitizing the water, the CAC includes [[chloramine]]s, which are formed by the reaction of FAC with amines (introduced into the pool by human perspiration, saliva, mucus, urine, and other biologics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Controlling Chloramines in Indoor Swimming Pools|url=http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/environment/factsheets/Pages/chloramines.aspx|work=NSW Government Health|accessdate=20 February 2013|date=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chloramines are responsible for the "chlorine smell" of pools, as well as skin and eye irritation. These problems are the result of insufficient levels of free available chlorine, and indicate a pool that must be "shocked" by the addition of 5-10 times the normal amount of chlorine.&lt;ref name="Donegan" /&gt;  In saltwater pools, the generator uses electrolysis to continuously produce free chlorine. It also burns off chloramines in the same manner as traditional shock (oxidizer). As with traditionally chlorinated pools, saltwater pools must be monitored in order to maintain proper water chemistry. Low chlorine levels can be caused by insufficient salt, incorrect (low) chlorine-generation setting on the SWG unit, higher-than-normal chlorine demand, low stabilizer, sun exposure, insufficient pump speed, or mechanical issues with the chlorine generator. Salt count can be lowered due to splash-out, backwashing, and dilution via rainwater.

== Health concerns ==
Research has shown that because saltwater pools still use chlorine sanitization, they generate the same [[disinfection byproduct]]s (DBPs) that are present in traditional pools.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=hTSMBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT3|title=Salt Water Pool 101|last=Clark|first=John R.|publisher=PWPH Publications|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=PT3|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of highest concern are [[haloketone]]s and [[trihalomethane]]s (THMs) of those the predominant form being [[bromoform]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Very high levels of bromoform - up to 1.3 mg / liter or 13 times the guideline values of [[World Health Organization]] - have been found in some public saltwater swimming pools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beech et al 1980 Nitrates, Chlorates and Trihalomethanes In Swimming Pool Water, ''Am J Public Health'' 70(1): p79-82&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers have been producing saltwater chlorine generators in the United States since the early 1980s, and they first appeared commercially in New Zealand in the early 1970s (the Aquatech IG4500).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cascade.co.nz/SaltWater2009.htm|title=Salt WaterSwimming Pools|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
The chlorinator cell consists of parallel titanium plates coated with [[ruthenium]] and sometimes  [[iridium]]. Older models make use of perforated (or mesh) plates rather than solid plates. Electrolysis naturally attracts calcium and other minerals to the plates. Thus, depending on water chemistry and magnitude of use, the cell will require periodic cleaning in a mild acid solution (1 part [[HCl]] to 15 parts pool water) which will remove the buildup of [[calcium]] compound crystals, such as calcium carbonate or calcium nitrate.   Excessive buildup can reduce the effectiveness of the cell. Running the chlorinator for long periods with not enough salt in the pool can strip the coating off the cell which then requires an expensive{{clarify|date=July 2018}} replacement, as can using too strong an acid wash.

Saltwater pools can also require stabilizer ([[cyanuric acid]]) to help stop the sun's UV rays from breaking down free chlorine in the pool. Usual levels are 20 – 50 ppm. They also require the [[pH]] to be kept between 7.2 and 7.8 with the chlorine being more effective if the pH is kept closer to 7.2. The average salt levels are usually in the 3000-5000 ppm range, much less than the ocean, which has salt levels of around 35,000 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/Water/dissolved_salts.html&amp;edu=elem Salinity – Dissolved Salts, Measuring Salinity], [http://www.windows2universe.org/ windows2universe.org].&lt;/ref&gt; In swimming pools, salt is typically poured across the bottom and swept with the pool brush until it dissolves; if concentrated brine is allowed into the return-water system it can cause the chlorinator cell to malfunction due to overconductivity.

Salt water chlorination produces an excess of hydroxyl ions whilst releasing chlorine from salt, which makes the pool alkaline (sodium hydroxide, NaOH, caustic soda). This requires the frequent addition of hydrochloric acid (HCl, also known as muriatic acid) to neutralise the alkalinity and convert the sodium hydroxide back into sodium chloride (i.e. table salt), which can be split by electrolysis again. Thus the consumable supplying all the chlorine is in fact the hydrochloric acid, with the salt acting as a non-consumed intermediary, being split and reformed. The whole process is exactly balanced by equivalents: the amount of chlorine produced is directly related to the amount of hydrochloric acid used, other things remaining equal. This could be represented roughly as follows (with the ions all separated in solution):

:::2{{chem|Na|Cl}} + 2{{chem|H|2|O}} → electrolysis →  2{{chem|Na|OH}} + {{chem|H|2}} + {{chem|Cl|2}}
:::2{{chem|Na|O|H}} + 2{{chem|H|Cl}} → chemical reaction → 2{{chem|Na|Cl}} + 2{{chem|H|2|O}}
:Net reaction :   2{{chem|H|Cl}} →      →     → {{chem|H|2}} + {{chem|Cl|2}}  (as gases bubbling off) .

Use of another acid, such as sulphuric acid to neutralise pool alkalinity will reduce the pH but will produce sulphate ions rather than chloride ions. Sulphate ions conduct electricity equally well as chloride at the electrode, but will not produce any chlorine. A salt water pool "poisoned" with sulphate may have to be drained and refilled to remove the offending sulphate ions.

== Benefits and disadvantages ==
The benefits of salt systems in pools are the convenience and the constant delivery of pure chlorine-based sanitizer. The reduction of irritating chloramines versus traditional chlorinating methods and the "softening" effect of electrolysis reducing dissolved alkali minerals in the water are also perceived as benefits. For some people that have sensitivities to chlorine, these systems may be less offensive. Salt water pools are cheaper to maintain throughout the year, since salt is significantly cheaper than the commercial chlorines.

Disadvantages are the initial cost of the system, maintenance, and the cost of replacement cells.  Salt is corrosive and will damage some metals and some improperly-sealed stone. However, as the ideal saline concentration of a salt-chlorinated pool is very low (&lt;3,500ppm, the threshold for human perception of salt by taste; [[seawater]] is about ten times this concentration), damage usually occurs due to improperly-maintained pool chemistry or improper maintenance of the electrolytic cell.  Pool equipment manufacturers typically will not warrant stainless steel products damaged by saline pools.

Calcium and other alkali precipitate buildup will occur naturally on the cathode plate, and sometimes in the pool itself as "scaling". Regular maintenance of the cell is necessary; failure to do so will reduce the effectiveness of the cell. Certain designs of saline chlorinators use a "reverse-polarity" design that will regularly switch the roles of the two electrodes between anode and cathode, causing this calcium buildup to dissolve off the accumulating electrode. Such systems reduce, but do not eliminate, the need to clean the electrolytic cell and the occurrence of calcium scale in the water.

As chlorine is generated, pH will rise causing the chlorine to be less effective. Many systems with chemistry automation can sense the rising pH and automatically introduce either [[CO2]] or [[hydrochloric acid]] in order to bring the pH back to the target level.

Automation systems will also manage levels of sanitizer by monitoring the [[Oxidation reduction potential|ORP]] or redox levels of the water.  This allows only the needed amount of chlorine to be generated based on the demand.

[[Sodium bromide]] can be used instead of [[sodium chloride]], which produces a bromine pool.  The benefits and downsides are the same as those of a salt system.  It is not necessary to use a chloride-based acid to balance the pH.  Also, bromine is only effective as a sanitizer, not as an oxidizer, leaving a need for adding a "shock" such as hydrogen peroxide or any chlorine-based shock to burn off inorganic waste and free up combined bromines.  This extra step is not needed in a sodium chloride system, as chlorine is effective as both a sanitizer and an oxidizer.  A user would only need to "super chlorinate" or increase chlorine production of the cell occasionally.  That would normally be once a week or after heavy bather loads.

Single-payer systems may contract for healthcare services from private organizations (as is the case in Canada) or may own and employ healthcare resources and personnel (as is the case in the United Kingdom). "Single-payer" describes the mechanism by which healthcare is paid for by a single public authority, not the type of delivery or for whom [[physicians]] work, which may be public, private, or a mix of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2017/09/19/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-single-payer/|title=What We Talk About When We Talk About Single Payer|website=healthaffairs.org|accessdate=December 12, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022142309/http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2017/09/19/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-single-payer/|archivedate=October 22, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/cards/single-payer/what-is-single-payer-health-care|title=What is single-payer health care?|date=March 26, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=December 12, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022142239/https://www.vox.com/cards/single-payer/what-is-single-payer-health-care|archivedate=October 22, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single-payer health system establishes one health risk pool consisting of the entire population of a geographic or political region. It also establishes one set of rules for services offered, reimbursement rates, drug prices, and minimum standards for required services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsiao|first=William C.|last2=Cheng|first2=Shou-Hsia|last3=Yip|first3=Winnie|title=What can be achieved with a single-payer NHI system: The case of Taiwan|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.12.006|pmid=29054594|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In wealthy nations, that kind of publicly managed insurance is typically extended to all citizens and legal residents. Examples include the United Kingdom's [[Healthcare in the United Kingdom|National Health Service]], Australia's [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]], Canada's [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]], and Taiwan's [[healthcare in Taiwan|National Health Insurance]].

The standard usage of the term "single-payer healthcare" refers to health insurance, as opposed to healthcare delivery, operating as a public service and offered to citizens and legal residents towards providing nearly universal or universal healthcare. The fund can be managed by the government directly or as a publicly owned and regulated agency.&lt;ref name="MedicalSubject" /&gt; Single-payer contrasts with other funding mechanisms like 'multi-payer' (multiple public and/or private sources), 'two-tiered' (defined either as a public source with the option to use qualifying private coverage as a substitute, or as a public source for catastrophic care backed by private insurance for common medical care), and 'insurance mandate' (citizens are required to buy private insurance which meets a national standard and which is generally subsidized). Some systems combine elements of these four funding mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.40thdems.org/blog/2017/5/15/single-payer-is-great-but-its-not-the-only-option|title=Single-payer is great but it's not the only option|publisher=|accessdate=December 12, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022193522/http://www.40thdems.org/blog/2017/5/15/single-payer-is-great-but-its-not-the-only-option|archivedate=October 22, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the standard usage of the term, some writers describe all publicly administered systems as "single-payer plans," and others have described any system of healthcare which intends to cover the entire population, such as voucher plans, as "single-payer plans," although these usages generally don't meet strict definitions of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Robert H. (2007-02-15). "A Health Care Plan So Simple, Even Stephen Colbert Couldn’t Simplify It." ''New York Times'', Retrieved from {{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/15/business/15scene.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903055357/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/15/business/15scene.html |archivedate=September 3, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==States with single-payer systems==
{{main article|Health care system#International comparisons}}
Several nations worldwide have single-payer health insurance programs. These programs generally provide some form of [[universal healthcare]], which is implemented in a variety of ways. In some cases doctors are employed and hospitals are run by the government, such as in the UK or Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/08/03/158020882/in-british-emergency-room-theres-no-card-to-show-there-are-no-bills|title=In British Emergency Room, 'There's No Card To Show; There Are No Bills'|work=[[NPR]]|last=Aguirre|first=Jessica Camille|date=August 6, 2012|accessdate=August 9, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808224307/http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/08/03/158020882/in-british-emergency-room-theres-no-card-to-show-there-are-no-bills|archivedate=August 8, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Socolovsky|first1=Jerome|title=What Makes Spain's Health Care System The Best?|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112014770|website=NPR|accessdate=21 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319212430/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112014770|archivedate=March 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the government may purchase healthcare services from outside organizations, such as the approach taken in [[Health care in Canada|Canada]].

===Canada===
{{Main article|Health care in Canada}}
{{See also|Canadian and American health care systems compared|Medicare (Canada)}}

Healthcare in Canada is delivered through a [[publicly funded healthcare]] system, which is mostly free at the point of use and has most services provided by private entities.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;Public vs. private health care ''CBC'', December 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The system was established by the provisions of the [[Canada Health Act]] of 1984.&lt;ref name="Canada Health Act"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/medi-assur/cha-lcs/overview-apercu-eng.php |title=Overview of the Canada Health Act |website= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414052008/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/medi-assur/cha-lcs/overview-apercu-eng.php |archivedate=April 14, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government assures the quality of care through federal standards. The government does not participate in day-to-day care or collect any information about an individual's health, which remains confidential between a person and his or her physician.

Canada's provincially based Medicare systems are cost-effective partly because of their administrative simplicity. In each province, each doctor handles the insurance claim against the provincial insurer. There is no need for the person who accesses healthcare to be involved in billing and reclaim. Private insurance represents a minimal part of the overall system.

In general, costs are paid through funding from income taxes, except in British Columbia, the only province to impose a fixed monthly premium which is waived or reduced for those on low incomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.bc.ca/msp/infoben/premium.html#monthly|title=Ministry of Health|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728213350/http://www.health.gov.bc.ca/msp/infoben/premium.html#monthly|archivedate=July 28, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A health card is issued by the Provincial Ministry of Health to each individual who enrolls for the program and everyone receives the same level of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/ptrole/index-eng.php |title=Provincial/Territorial Role in Health |website= |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206214055/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/ptrole/index-eng.php |archivedate=February 6, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no need for a variety of plans because virtually all essential basic care is covered, including maternity and infertility problems. Depending on the province, dental and vision care may not be covered but are often insured by employers through private companies. In some provinces, private supplemental plans are available for those who desire private rooms if they are hospitalized.

Cosmetic surgery and some forms of elective surgery are not considered essential care and are generally not covered. These can be paid out-of-pocket or through private insurers. Health coverage is not affected by loss or change of jobs, as long as premiums are up to date, and there are no lifetime limits or exclusions for pre-existing conditions.

Pharmaceutical medications are covered by public funds or through employment-based private insurance.&lt;ref&gt;CIHI p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Drug prices are negotiated with suppliers by the federal government to control costs. [[Family physician]]s (often known as general practitioners or GPs in Canada) are chosen by individuals. If a patient wishes to see a specialist or is counseled to see a specialist, a referral can be made by a GP.

Canadians do wait for some treatments and diagnostic services. Survey data shows that the median wait time to see a special physician is a little over four weeks with 89.5% waiting less than three months. The median wait time for diagnostic services such as MRI and CAT scans&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Diagnostic tests defined as the following: non-emergency magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices; computed tomography (CT or CAT) scans; and angiographies that use X-rays to examine the inner opening of blood-filled structures such as veins and arteries.&lt;/ref&gt; is two weeks, with 86.4% waiting less than three months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/pubs/system-regime/2006-fed-comp-indicat/2006-fed-comp-indicat-3-eng.php#a1 Section from Healthy Canadians: A Federal report on Comparable Health Indicators] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604194222/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/pubs/system-regime/2006-fed-comp-indicat/2006-fed-comp-indicat-3-eng.php#a1 |date=June 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The median wait time for surgery is four weeks, with 82.2% waiting less than three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/161/8/1028|title=How bad is the brain drain?|first=Charlotte|last=Gray|date=October 19, 1999|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=161|issue=8|pages=1028–1029|accessdate=December 12, 2017|via=www.cmaj.ca|pmid=10551204|pmc=1230682|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213081819/http://www.cmaj.ca/content/161/8/1028|archivedate=December 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While physician income initially boomed after the implementation of a single-payer program, a reduction in physician salaries followed, which many feared would be a long-term result of government-run healthcare. However, by the beginning of the 21st century, medical professionals were again among Canada's top earners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duffin|first=Jacalyn|date=2016-11-17|title=The Impact of Single-Payer Health Care on Physician Income in Canada, 1850–2005|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=101|issue=7|pages=1198–1208|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2010.300093|issn=0090-0036|pmc=3110239|pmid=21566029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taiwan===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Taiwan}}
Healthcare in Taiwan is administrated by the [[Department of Health (Republic of China)|Department of Health]] of the [[Executive Yuan]]. As with other [[Developed country|developed economies]], Taiwanese people are well-nourished but face such health problems as chronic [[obesity]] and [[heart disease]].&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

In 2002, [[Taiwan]] had nearly 1.6 physicians and 5.9 hospital beds per 1,000 population, and there were a total of 36 hospitals and 2,601 clinics in the country.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Taiwan.pdf|title=Taiwan country profile|publisher=[[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]]|date=March 2005|accessdate=2008-05-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512172454/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Taiwan.pdf|archivedate=May 12, 2008|df=mdy-all}} ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Health expenditures constituted 5.8 percent of the [[GDP]] in 2001, 64.9% of which coming from public funds.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

Despite the initial shock on Taiwan's economy from increased costs of expanded healthcare coverage, the single-payer system has provided protection from greater financial risks and has made healthcare more financially accessible for the population, resulting in a steady 70% public satisfaction rating.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=Jui-Fen Rachel|last2=Hsiao|first2=William C.|date=2003-05-01|title=Does Universal Health Insurance Make Health Care Unaffordable?

The current [[healthcare system]] in Taiwan, known as National Health Insurance (NHI), was instituted in 1995. NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan which centralizes the disbursement of health care funds. The system promises equal access to health care for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99% by the end of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Fanchiang, Cecilia.[http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=20439&amp;CtNode=122 "New IC health insurance card expected to offer many benefits"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606010447/http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=20439&amp;CtNode=122 |date=June 6, 2008 }}, ''Taiwan Journal'', January 2, 2004, Accessed March 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

NHI is mainly financed through premiums, which are based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket payments and direct government funding. In the initial stage, fee-for-service predominated for both public and private providers. Most health providers operate in the private sector and form a competitive market on the health delivery side. However, many healthcare providers took advantage of the system by offering unnecessary services to a larger number of patients and then billing the government.

In the face of increasing loss and the need for cost containment, NHI changed the payment system from fee-for-service to a global budget, a kind of prospective payment system, in 2002. Taiwan's success with a single-payer health insurance program is owed, in part, to the country's human resources and the government's organizational skills, allowing for the effective and efficient management of the government-run health insurance program.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===South Korea===
{{Main article|Healthcare in South Korea}}

South Korea used to have a multipayer [[Social health insurance]] universal healthcare system, similar to systems used in countries like Japan and Germany, with healthcare societies providing coverage for whole populace. Prior to 1977, the country had voluntary private health insurance, but reforms initiated in 1977 resulted in universal coverage by 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Health Care Reform in South Korea: Success or Failure?|first=Jong-Chan|last=Lee|date=January 1, 2003|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=93|issue=1|pages=48–51|pmid=12511383|pmc=1447690|doi=10.2105/ajph.93.1.48}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major healthcare financing reform in 2000 merged all medical societies into the National Health Insurance Service. This new service became a single-payer healthcare system in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhic.or.kr/static/html/wbd/g/a/wbdga0101.html|title=h-well NHIS|last=http://inno1.com|website=www.nhic.or.kr|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regions with 'Beveridge Model' systems==

===Scandinavia===

The countries of [[Scandinavia]] are sometimes considered to have a single-payer health care services, as opposed to single-payer national health care insurance like Taiwan or Canada. This is a form of the '[[Beveridge Report|Beveridge Model]]' of health care systems that features public health providers in addition to public health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/health_care_systems_four_basic_models.php|title=Health Care Systems - Four Basic Models - Physicians for a National Health Program|website=www.pnhp.org|accessdate=December 12, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031123300/http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/health_care_systems_four_basic_models.php|archivedate=October 31, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'Scandinavian model' of health care systems has a few common features: largely public providers, limited private health coverage, and regionally-run, devolved systems with limited involvement from the central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/98417/E93429.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809195038/http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/98417/E93429.pdf |archivedate=August 9, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this third characteristic, they can also be argued to be single-payer only on a regional level, or to be multi-payer systems, as opposed to the nationally run health coverage found in Canada, Taiwan and South Korea.

===United Kingdom===
{{main article|Healthcare in the United Kingdom}}
As in Scandinavia, healthcare in the United Kingdom is a [[devolution|devolved matter]], meaning England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and [[Wales]] each have their own systems of private and [[publicly funded healthcare]], generally referred to as the [[National Health Service]] (NHS). With largely public or government owned providers, this also fits into the 'Beveridge Model' of health care systems, sometimes considered to be single-payer, although unlike Scandinavia, there is a more significant role for both private coverage and providers. Each country's having different policies and priorities has resulted in a variety of differences existing between the systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7586147.stm 'Huge contrasts' in devolved NHS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216225814/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7586147.stm |date=February 16, 2009 }} BBC News, 28 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7149423.stm NHS now four different systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403211931/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7149423.stm |date=April 3, 2009 }} [[BBC]] 2 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; That said, each country provides public healthcare to all [[British nationality law|UK permanent residents]] that is free at the point of use, being paid for from general taxation.

In addition, each also has a private sector which is considerably smaller than its public equivalent, with provision of private healthcare acquired by means of private health insurance, funded as part of an employer funded healthcare scheme or paid directly by the customer, though provision can be restricted for those with conditions such as [[AIDS]]/[[HIV]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bupa.co.uk/heartbeat/html/not_covered.html BUPA exclusions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131160104/http://www.bupa.co.uk/heartbeat/html/not_covered.html |date=January 31, 2009 }} bupa.co.uk, accessed 23 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2012/01/16/the-awkward-world-of-private-insurance-in-the-uk/| author=Bob Wachter, MD| title=The Awkward World of Private Insurance in the UK| publisher=The Health Care Blog| date=January 16, 2012| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116164308/http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2012/01/16/the-awkward-world-of-private-insurance-in-the-uk/| archivedate=November 16, 2016| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The individual systems are:
* England: [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]]
* Northern Ireland: [[Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland]] (HSCNI)
* Scotland: [[NHS Scotland]]
* Wales: [[NHS Wales]]
In England, funding from general taxation is channeled through NHS England, which is responsible for commissioning mainly specialist services and primary care, and Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), which manage 60% of the budget and are responsible for commissioning health services for their local populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/commissioning/|title=NHS Commissioning|first=NHS|last=Commissioning|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216223927/https://www.england.nhs.uk/commissioning/|archivedate=December 16, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These commissioning bodies do not provide services themselves directly, but procure these from NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts, as well as private, voluntary and social enterprise sector providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The structure of the NHS in England|url = http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/nhsstructure.aspx|website = www.nhs.uk|access-date = 2016-02-23|first = NHS|last = Choices|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160220171503/http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/nhsstructure.aspx|archivedate = February 20, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regions with hybrid single-payer/private insurance systems==

===Australia===
{{main article|Health care in Australia}}
Healthcare in Australia is provided by both private and government institutions. [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] is the publicly funded [[universal health care]] venture in Australia. It was instituted in 1984 and coexists with a private health system. Medicare is funded partly by a 2% [[income tax]] levy (with exceptions for low-income earners), but mostly out of general revenue. An additional levy of 1% is imposed on high-income earners without private [[health insurance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicare levy increase to fund DisabilityCare Australia|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Direct-taxes/Income-tax-for-individuals/Medicare-Levy-increase-to-fund-DisabilityCare/|website=www.ato.gov.au|accessdate=28 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123923/https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Direct-taxes/Income-tax-for-individuals/Medicare-Levy-increase-to-fund-DisabilityCare/|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as Medicare, there is a separate [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] that considerably subsidises a range of prescription medications. The [[Minister for Health and Ageing (Australia)|Minister for Health]] administers national health policy, elements of which (such as the operation of hospitals) are overseen by individual [[States and territories of Australia|states]].

===Spain===
{{Main|Spanish National Health System}}
Building upon less structured foundations, in 1963 the existence of a single-payer healthcare system in Spain was established by the Spanish government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seg-social.es/Internet_1/LaSeguridadSocial/HistoriadelaSegurid47711/index.htm|title=Seguridad Social:Conócenos|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103055711/http://www.seg-social.es/Internet_1/LaSeguridadSocial/HistoriadelaSegurid47711/index.htm|archivedate=January 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was sustained by contributions from workers, and covered them and their dependants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revista-portalesmedicos.com/revista-medica/historia-de-la-sanidad-publica-espanola-revision-bibliografica/2/|title=Historia de la Sanidad Pública española.

The universality of the system was established later in 1986. At the same time, management of public healthcare was delegated to the different [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msssi.gob.es/organizacion/sns/docs/proteccion08.pdf|title=La protección de la salud en España|author=|date=|website=msssi.gob.es|accessdate=May 5, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918015821/http://www.msssi.gob.es/organizacion/sns/docs/proteccion08.pdf|archivedate=September 18, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While previously this was not the case, in 1997 it was established that public authorities can delegate management of publicly funded healthcare to private companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-1997-9021|title=Documento BOE-A-1997-9021|publisher=BOE.es|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224164536/https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-1997-9021|archivedate=December 24, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, in parallel to the single-payer healthcare system there are private insurers, which provide coverage for some private doctors and hospitals. Employers will sometimes offer private health insurance as a benefit, with 14.8% of the Spanish population being covered under private health insurance in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elblogsalmon.com/entorno/muface-y-la-sanidad-privada-de-verdad-tiene-sentido|title=Muface y la sanidad privada, ¿de verdad tiene sentido?|first=Alejandro Nieto|last=González|date=September 22, 2014|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224172439/http://www.elblogsalmon.com/entorno/muface-y-la-sanidad-privada-de-verdad-tiene-sentido|archivedate=December 24, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacionidis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AnalisisSituacion_2013.pdf|title=Informe IDIS, Análisis de situación 2013|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224164343/http://www.fundacionidis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/AnalisisSituacion_2013.pdf|archivedate=December 24, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Spanish healthcare system [[World Health Organization ranking of health systems in 2000|was rated]] by the World Health Organization as the 7th best in the world.

===United States===
{{Main article|Health care in the United States}}
[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare in the United States]] is a single-payer healthcare system, but is restricted to persons over the age of 65, people under 65 who have specific disabilities, and anyone with [[End-Stage Renal Disease]].&lt;ref&gt;HealthCare.gov: [http://www.healthcare.gov/using-insurance/medicare-long-term-care/medicare/index.html#whatmedicare What is Medicare?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130220211708/http://www.healthcare.gov/using-insurance/medicare-long-term-care/medicare/index.html |date=February 20, 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of proposals have been made for a universal single-payer healthcare system in the United States, among them the [[United States National Health Care Act]] (popularly known as H.R. 676 or "Medicare for All") originally introduced in the House in February 2003 and repeatedly since.

On July 18, 2018, it was announced that over 60 House Democrats would be forming a [[Medicare For All Caucus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/d3epbm/exclusive-over-60-house-democrats-are-forming-a-medicare-for-all-caucus|title=Exclusive: Over 60 House Democrats are forming a Medicare for All Caucus|work=VICE News|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates argue that [[preventive healthcare]] expenditures can save several hundreds of billions of dollars per year because publicly funded universal healthcare would benefit employers and consumers, that employers would benefit from a bigger pool of potential customers and that employers would likely pay less, would be spared administrative costs, and inequities between employers would be reduced. Prohibitively high cost is the primary reason Americans give for problems accessing health care.&lt;ref name="dpeaflcio.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dpeaflcio.org/programs-publications/issue-fact-sheets/the-u-s-health-care-system-an-international-perspective/|title=The U.S. Health Care System: An International Perspective - DPEAFLCIO|website=dpeaflcio.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328093811/http://dpeaflcio.org/programs-publications/issue-fact-sheets/the-u-s-health-care-system-an-international-perspective/|archivedate=March 28, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At over 27 million, the number of people without [[health insurance in the United States|health insurance]] coverage in the [[United States]] is one of the primary concerns raised by advocates of [[health care reform in the United States|health care reform]].

Opponents argue single-payer does not translate into better health care. Instead, access to health care diminishes under single-payer systems, and the overall quality of care suffers.

====National policies and proposals====
Government is increasingly involved in [[Health care in the United States|U.S. health care]] spending, paying about 45% of the $2.2 trillion the nation spent on individuals' medical care in 2004. However, studies have shown that the publicly administered share of health spending in the U.S. may be closer to 60% as of 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Health Affairs, July 2002. Woolhandler, Steffi&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Princeton University]] health economist [[Uwe Reinhardt]], U.S. Medicare, [[Medicaid]], and [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP) represent "forms of '[[social insurance]]' coupled with a largely private health-care delivery system" rather than forms of "[[socialized medicine]]." In contrast, he describes the [[Veterans Health Administration|Veterans Administration healthcare system]] as a pure form of socialized medicine because it is "owned, operated and financed by government."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118411829790962883 "Letters: For Children's Sake, This 'Schip' Needs to Be Relaunched"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710035107/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118411829790962883 |date=July 10, 2017 }}, ''Wall Street Journal'', July 11, 2007, [[Uwe Reinhardt]] and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a peer-reviewed paper published in the ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'', researchers of the [[RAND Corporation]] reported that the quality of care received by Veterans Administration patients scored significantly higher overall than did comparable metrics for patients currently using United States Medicare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Asch SM, McGlynn EA, Hogan MM, et al |title=Comparison of quality of care for patients in the Veterans Health Administration and patients in a national sample |journal=Ann.

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] and related government agencies scored the cost of a single-payer health care system several times since 1991. The [[General Accounting Office]] published a report in 1991 noting that "[I]f the US were to shift to a system of universal coverage and a single payer, as in Canada, the savings in administrative costs [10 percent of health spending] would be more than enough to offset the expense of universal coverage."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gao.gov/d20t9/144039.pdf "Canadian Health Insurance: Lessons for the United States,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050529114235/http://archive.gao.gov/d20t9/144039.pdf |date=May 29, 2005 }} General Accounting Office, June 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBO scored the cost in 1991, noting that "the population that is currently uninsured could be covered without dramatically increasing national spending on health" and that "all US residents might be covered by health insurance for roughly the current level of spending or even somewhat less, because of savings in administrative costs and lower payment rates for services used by the privately insured."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/76xx/doc7652/91-CBO-039.pdf Universal Health Insurance Coverage Using Medicare’s Payment Rates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111233222/http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/76xx/doc7652/91-CBO-039.pdf |date=November 11, 2011 }}, Congressional Budget Office, December 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

A CBO report in 1993 stated that "[t]he net cost of achieving universal insurance coverage under this single payer system would be negative" in part because "consumer payments for health would fall by $1,118 per capita, but taxes would have to increase by $1,261 per capita" in order to pay for the plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/64xx/doc6442/93doc171.pdf "Single-Payer and All-Payer Health Insurance Systems Using Medicare’s Payment Rates"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013135844/http://cbo.gov/ftpdocs/64xx/doc6442/93doc171.pdf |date=October 13, 2011 }} Congressional Budget Office, April 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; A July 1993 scoring also resulted in positive outcomes, with the CBO stating that, "[a]s the program was phased in, the administrative savings from switching to a single-payer system would offset much of the increased demand for health care services.

Later, the cap on the growth of the national health budget would hold the rate of growth of spending below the baseline."&lt;ref&gt;"Estimates of Health Care Proposals from the 102nd Congress" Congressional Budget Office, July 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The CBO also scored Sen. [[Paul Wellstone]]'s American Health and Security Act of 1993 in December 1993, finding that "by year five (and in subsequent years) the new system would cost less than baseline."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/79xx/doc7946/93doc07b.pdf S.491, American Health Security Act of 1993] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012203314/http://cbo.gov/ftpdocs/79xx/doc7946/93doc07b.pdf |date=October 12, 2011 }}, Congressional Budget Office, December 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study published in the journal BMC Medical Services Research by James Kahn, et al., found that the actual administrative burden of health care in the United States was 27% of all national health expenditures. The study examined both direct costs charged by insurers for profit, administration and marketing but also the indirect burden placed on health care providers like hospitals, nursing homes and doctors for costs they incurred in working with private health insurers including contract negotiations, financial and clinical record-keeping (variable and idiosyncratic for each payer).

Kahn, et al. estimate that the added cost for the private insurer health system in the US was about $471 billion in 2012 compared to a single-payer system like Canada's. This represents just over 20% of the total national healthcare expenditure in 2012. Kahn asserts that this excess administrative cost will increase under the Affordable Care Act with its reliance on the provision of health coverage through a multi-payer system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Billing and insurance-related administrative costs in US healthcare|last = Kahn|first = James|date = 2014 |volume=14 |page=556|journal = BMC Health Services Research|doi = 10.1186/s12913-014-0556-7|pmid = 25540104|pmc = 4283267|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to SB-562, a Healthy California Trust Fund would be established to provide funding for the bill. Currently, states receive funding from the federal government for certain healthcare services such as [[Medicaid]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. In addition to taxes, these funds would be pooled into the new [[trust fund]] and provide the sources of funding needed to implement The Healthy California Act. However, California must first obtain a waiver from the federal government which would allow California to pool all the money received from these federal programs into one central fund.&lt;ref name="HealthyReform"/&gt;

{{main article|ColoradoCare}}
The Colorado State Health Care System Initiative, Amendment 69, was a citizen-initiated constitutional amendment proposal in November 2016 to vote on a single-payer healthcare system funded by a 10% payroll tax split 2:1 between employers and employees. This would have replaced the private health insurance premiums currently paid by employees and companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2015/11/09/colorado-puts-single-payer-healthcare-on-2016-ballot/|title=Colorado Puts Single-Payer Healthcare On 2016 Ballot|first=Dan|last=Munro|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729211052/https://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2015/11/09/colorado-puts-single-payer-healthcare-on-2016-ballot/|archivedate=July 29, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ballot was rejected by 79% of the [[election|electorate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/CO/63746/183105/Web01/en/summary.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114234307/http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/CO/63746/183105/Web01/en/summary.html |archivedate=November 14, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 article in the [[public health journal]] ''[[Health Affairs]]'' studied fifty years of American public opinion of various health care plans and concluded that, while there appears to be general support of a "national health care plan," poll respondents "remain satisfied with their current medical arrangements, do not trust the federal government to do what is right, and do not favor a single-payer type of national health plan."&lt;ref name="content.healthaffairs.org"/&gt;

[[Politifact]] rated a statement by [[Michael Moore]] "false" when he stated that "[t]he majority actually want single-payer health care." According to Politifact, responses on these polls largely depend on the wording. For example, people respond more favorably when they are asked if they want a system "like Medicare."&lt;ref name="politifact1"/&gt;

====Advocacy groups====
[[Physicians for a National Health Program]], the [[American Medical Student Association]], [[Healthcare-NOW!]], and the [[California Nurses Association]] are among advocacy groups that have called for the introduction of a single-payer healthcare program in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.pnhp.org/publications/proposal_of_the_physicians_working_group_for_singlepayer_national_health_insurance.php| title = Proposal of the Physicians' Working Group for Single-Payer National Health Insurance| publisher = Physicians for a National Health Program| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090221080001/http://www.pnhp.org/publications/proposal_of_the_physicians_working_group_for_singlepayer_national_health_insurance.php| archivedate = February 21, 2009| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua"&gt;{{citation | last = Chua | first = Kao-Ping | title = Single Payer 101 | publisher = American Medical Student Association | place = Reston, Virginia | year = 2006 | url = http://www.vt4singlepayer.org/images/userfiles/SinglePayer101-1%5B1%5D.pdf | accessdate = 11 April 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140302201744/http://www.vt4singlepayer.org/images/userfiles/SinglePayer101-1%5B1%5D.pdf | archivedate = March 2, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071225014520/http://www.calnurses.org/media-center/in-the-news/2007/september/page.jsp?itemID=32125992 Single-payer, or Medicare for all, is the way to go] from the California Nurses Association / National Nurses Organizing Committee.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''subpersonality''' is, in [[transpersonal psychology]], a [[personality mode]] that kicks in (appears on a temporary basis) to allow a person to cope with certain types of [[psychosocial]] situations.&lt;ref name="Fall"&gt;Fall, Kevin A. (December 9, 2003) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pKFZKRG-IKwC&amp;pg=PA444&amp;dq=Subpersonality&amp;sig=lN_rPbMLbnsmLDNg8CeOAmiFD0M#PPA444,M1 Theoretical Models of Counseling and Psychotherapy.]'' Page 444. Publisher: Routledge. {{ISBN|1-58391-068-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to a [[complex (psychology)|complex]],&lt;ref&gt;Kivinen, Michael K. (November 1, 2007) Subconsciously Speaking. ''[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-171440400.html Coming to terms with past life regression.] Volume 22; Issue 6; Page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; the mode may include thoughts, feelings, actions, physiology and other elements of human behavior to [[Impression management|self-present]] a particular mode that works to negate particular psychosocial situations.&lt;ref name="Fall"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rowan&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowan|first=J|title=Subpersonalities: The People Inside Us|year=1990|publisher=Routlege|isbn=9780415043298}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average person has about a dozen subpersonalities.&lt;ref name="Fall"/&gt;

Subpersonalities are able to perceive [[consciousness]] as something separate from themselves, as well as domestic image attached to these elements.&lt;ref name="Fall"/&gt; [[United States|American]] transpersonal philosopher [[Ken Wilber]] identifies subpersonality as "functional self-presentations that navigate particular psychosocial situations."&lt;ref name="Fall"/&gt; For example, if a harsh critic responds with judgmental thoughts, anger, superior feelings, critical words, punitive action, and/or tense physiology when confronted with her own and/or others' fallibility, that is a subpersonality of the harsh critic kicking in to cope with the confrontation situation.&lt;ref name="Fall"/&gt;

==Subpersonalities in Psychotherapy==

For a somewhat different viewpoint: Many schools of [[psychotherapy]] see '''subpersonalities''' as relatively enduring psychological structures or entities that influence how a person feels, perceives, behaves, and sees him- or herself. Over the history of psychotherapy, many forms of therapy have worked with inner diversity representations or subpersonalities.&lt;ref name="FirmanGila2002-p69"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Firman|author2=Ann Gila|title=Psychosynthesis: A Psychology of the Spirit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVPLYPfAjksC&amp;pg=PA69|date=26 September 2002|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-5534-0|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DohertyGuyler2008-p88"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nora Doherty|author2=Marcelas Guyler|title=The Essential Guide to Workplace Mediation &amp; Conflict Resolution: Rebuilding Working Relationships|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DPMgUNyO6iMC&amp;pg=PA88|year=2008|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|isbn=978-0-7494-5019-9|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early methods were [[Jungian analysis]], [[Psychosynthesis]], [[Transactional Analysis|Transactional analysis]], and [[Gestalt therapy]]. These were followed by some forms of [[hypnotherapy]] and the [[inner child]] work of [[John Bradshaw (author)|John Bradshaw]] and others.

Schwartz. He sees [[Dissociative identity disorder|DID alters]] as on the same continuum as IFS parts (subpersonalities), the only difference being that alters are more polarized and split off from the rest of the internal system.

==Content==

''The State of the World's Children 1982–1983'' launches the [[child survival revolution]] and pushed for [[GOBI]] (growth monitoring, [[oral rehydration therapy]], breastfeeding, and immunization).&lt;ref name="1980_1995"/&gt;

The 1988 report argues for the need of a "Grand Alliance" for children between governments, schools, mass media, etc., to continue the child survival and development revolution.&lt;ref name="1980_1995"/&gt;

The 1991 report features the [[World Summit for Children]], which happened the previous year. The report covers the commitment made by the Summit and serves as a record.&lt;ref name="1980_1995"/&gt;

The 2015 ''The State of the World's Children'' report, titled ''Reimagine the Future'', reviews the work on children's health and rights in the world in the context of the 25th anniversary of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/SOWC_2015_Summary_and_Tables.pdf |title=THE STATE OF THE WORLD’S CHILDREN 2015: Executive Summary |publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crop.org/OtherResources/FurtherReading/UNICEF-The-State-of-the-Worlds-Children-in-Numbers-.aspx |title=UNICEF: The State of the World’s Children in Numbers |date=August 24, 2015 |accessdate=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report also argued that more innovation is necessary, and highlighted examples including Solar Ear (a solar-rechargeable [[hearing aid]] battery charger) and community-based management of acute malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reliefweb.int/report/world/state-world-s-children-2015-reimagine-future-innovation-every-child |title=The State of the World’s Children 2015: Reimagine the future - Innovation for every child |date = November 20, 2014 |publisher=reliefweb |accessdate=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
WebPT was founded in 2008 by Heidi Jannenga and her ex-husband, Brad Jannenga.&lt;ref name="Phoenix BJ 5/18/12" /&gt; Heidi had a physical therapy practice, which helped spark the idea for the software.&lt;ref name="Phoenix BJ 5/18/12" /&gt; Brad was once president and CTO and now Heidi is the president after Battery Ventures voted to remove Brad from his executive role. Nancy Ham is CEO.&lt;ref name="WebPT About"&gt;{{cite web|title=WebPT: About|url=http://www.webpt.com/about|website=WebPT|publisher=WebPT|accessdate=6 March 2015|ref=WebPT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Startup company|startup]] received a $1 million funding round from Canal Partners, led by Jim Armstrong.&lt;ref name="Forbes 10.12"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wagner|first1=Eric T.|title=Match.com Hatches a Marriage, Baby and $9 Million Dollar Company|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericwagner/2012/10/09/match-com-hatches-a-marriage-baby-and-9-million-dollar-company/|accessdate=6 March 2015|work=Forbes|publisher=Forbes|date=9 October 2012|ref=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; WebPT received an undisclosed investment in June 2014 from [[venture capital]] firm [[Battery Ventures]].&lt;ref name="PBJ 9 July 2014" /&gt;
