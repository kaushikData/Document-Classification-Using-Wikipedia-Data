'''Albert Bandura''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC}} ({{IPAc-en|b|æ|n|ˈ|d|ʊər|ə}}; born December 4, 1925) is a [[Canada|Canadian]]-[[U.S.A.|American]] [[psychologist]] who is the David Starr Jordan Professor Emeritus of Social Science in Psychology at [[Stanford University]].

Bandura has been responsible for contributions to the field of education and to several fields of psychology, including [[social cognitive theory]], [[therapy]], and [[personality psychology]], and was also of influence in the transition between [[behaviorism]] and [[cognitive psychology]]. He is known as the originator of [[social learning theory]] (renamed the social cognitive theory) and the theoretical construct of [[self-efficacy]], and is also responsible for the influential 1961 [[Bobo doll experiment]]. This Bobo doll experiment demonstrated the concept of observational learning.

Social cognitive theory is how people learn through observing others. An example of social cognitive theory would be the students imitating the teacher. Self-efficacy is  "the belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations." To paraphrase, self-efficacy is believing in yourself to take action. The Bobo Doll Experiment was how Albert Bandura studied aggression and non-aggression in children.

A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most-frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind [[B. F. Skinner]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Jean Piaget]], and as the most cited living one.&lt;ref&gt;Haggbloom S.J. (2002). The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century, Review of General Psychology, 6 (2). 139–152.&lt;/ref&gt; Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.all-about-psychology.com/psychology-videos.html |title=Showcasing The Very Best Online Psychology Videos |publisher=All-about-psychology.com |date= |accessdate=December 30, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101227030658/http://www.all-about-psychology.com/psychology-videos.html| archivedate= 27 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Foster |first=Christine |url=http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2006/sepoct/features/bandura.html |title=STANFORD Magazine: September/October 2006 &gt; Features &gt; Albert Bandura |publisher=Stanfordalumni.org |date=July 2, 2003 |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Vancouver |first=The |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=48cdc46f-fa8a-4f03-8be2-5463567e17cf |title=Canadian-born psychology legend wins $200,000 prize |publisher=Canada.com |date=December 6, 2007 |accessdate=December 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903031605/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=48cdc46f-fa8a-4f03-8be2-5463567e17cf |archivedate=September 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/03/upfront-bandura.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/historyofpsychology/tp/ten-influential-psychologists.htm |title=10 Most Influential Psychologists |publisher=Psychology.about.com |date=September 24, 2010 |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webspace.ship.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|author=C. George Boeree |url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/bandura.html |title=Albert Bandura |publisher=Webspace.ship.edu |date=December 4, 1925 |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA). He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48. Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]'' from 1963 to 1972.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/614419572&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 82, Bandura was awarded the [[Grawemeyer Award]] for psychology.

==Early life==
Bandura was born in [[Mundare]], in [[Alberta]], an open town of roughly four hundred inhabitants, as the youngest child, and only son, in a family of six. The limitations of education in a remote town such as this caused Bandura to become independent and self-motivated in terms of learning, and these primarily developed traits proved very helpful in his lengthy career.&lt;ref&gt;"Bandura, Albert." ''Psychologists and Their Theories for Students''. Ed. Kristine Krapp. Vol. 1. Detroit: Gale, 2005. 39–66. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 3 Apr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Bandura is of Polish and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] descent; his father was from Krakow, Poland whilst his mother was from Ukraine.

Bandura's parents were a key influence in encouraging him to seek ventures out of the small hamlet they resided in. The summer after finishing high school, Bandura worked in the [[Yukon]] to protect the [[Alaska Highway]] against sinking. Bandura later credited his work in the northern [[tundra]] as the origin of his interest in human [[psychopathology]]. It was in this experience in the Yukon, where he was exposed to a subculture of drinking and gambling, which helped broaden his perspective and scope of views on life.

Bandura arrived in the US in 1949 and was naturalized in 1956. He married Virginia Varns (1921&amp;ndash;2011) in 1952,&lt;ref name=varnsobit&gt;[http://www.paloaltoonline.com/obituaries/memorials/virginia-belle-bandura?o=1489 "Virginia Belle Bandura, Dec. 6, 1921 - Oct. 10, 2011, Stanford, California"] at ''Lasting Memories: An online directory of obituaries and remembrances of Mid-peninsula Residents''. (accessed 6 December 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; and they raised two daughters, Carol and Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Marquis biographies online: Profile detail, Albert Bandura | url = http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100002238841 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | accessdate = August 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and academic career ==
Bandura's introduction to academic psychology came about by a fluke; as a student with little to do in the early mornings, he took a psychology course to pass the time, and became enamored of the subject. Bandura graduated in three years, in 1949, with a B.A. from the [[University of British Columbia]], winning the Bolocan Award in psychology, and then moved to the then-epicenter of theoretical psychology, the [[University of Iowa]], from where he obtained his M.A. in 1951 and Ph.D. in 1952. [[Arthur Lester Benton|Arthur Benton]] was his academic adviser at Iowa,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.des.emory.edu/mfp/banconversion.html |title=See end of page for Bandura's own statement |publisher=Des.emory.edu |date= |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  giving Bandura a direct academic descent from [[William James]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.des.emory.edu/mfp/bangenealogy.html |title=Bandura's Professional Genealogy |publisher=Des.emory.edu |date= |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while [[Clark Hull]] and [[Kenneth Spence]] were influential collaborators. During his Iowa years, Bandura came to support a style of psychology which sought to investigate psychological phenomena through repeatable, experimental testing. His inclusion of such mental phenomena as imagery and [[Representation (psychology)|representation]], and his concept of [[reciprocal determinism]], which postulated a relationship of mutual influence between an agent and its environment, marked a radical departure from the dominant behaviorism of the time. Bandura's expanded array of conceptual tools allowed for more potent modeling of such phenomena as observational learning and self-regulation, and provided psychologists with a practical way in which to theorize about mental processes, in opposition to the [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] constructs of [[psychoanalysis]] and [[personality psychology|personology]].&lt;ref name="webspace.ship.edu"/&gt; When a psychologist such as Bandura invokes the self construct to explain human emotion, thought, and behavior, he or she is using exactly the same type of "mentalistic" constructs utilized by the psychodynamic theorists.  

=== Post-doctoral work ===

Upon graduation, he completed his postdoctoral internship at the Wichita Guidance Center.  The following year, 1953, he accepted a teaching position at [[Stanford University]], which he holds to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.stanford.edu/dept/psychology/system/files/BanduraCV.pdf |title=Microsoft Word – BanduraCV.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=December 30, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, he was elected president of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA), which is the world's largest association of psychologists.&lt;ref name=AAAS /&gt; Bandura would later state the only reason he agreed to be in the running for the APA election was because he wanted his 15 minutes of fame without any intentions of being elected. He also worked as a sports coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editors = M. G. Lindzey &amp; W. M. Runyan | title = A history of psychology in autobiography (vol IX) | url =http://www.des.emory.edu/mfp/BanduraAutobiography2007.html | accessdate = August 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Bandura was initially influenced by Robert Sears' work on familial antecedents of [[social behavior]] and identificatory learning. He directed his initial research to the role of social [[Modeling (psychology)|modeling]] in human [[motivation]], thought, and action. In collaboration with Richard Walters, his first doctoral student, he engaged in studies of [[Social learning theory|social learning]] and [[aggression]]. Their joint efforts illustrated the critical role of modeling in human behavior and led to a program of research into the determinants and mechanisms of [[observational learning]].

=== Social learning theory ===
{{Main|Social learning theory}}
The initial phase of Bandura's research analyzed the foundations of human learning and the willingness of children and adults to imitate behavior observed in others, in particular, aggression.

He found that according to Social Learning theory, models are an important source for learning new behaviors and for achieving behavioral change in institutionalized settings.&lt;ref&gt;Henry P Sims Jr. &amp; Charles C Manz (1982): Social Learning Theory, Journal of Organizational Behavior Management, 3:4, 55–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social learning theory posits that there are three regulatory systems that control behavior. First, the antecedent inducements greatly influence the time and response of behavior. The stimulus that occurs before the behavioral response must be appropriate in relationship to social context and performers. Second, response feedback influences also serve an important function. Following a response, the reinforcements, by experience or observation, will greatly impact the occurrence of the behavior in the future. Third, the importance of cognitive functions in social learning. For example, for aggressive behavior to occur some people become easily angered by the sight or thought of individuals with whom they have had hostile encounters, and this memory is acquired through the learning process.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1973). Aggression: A social learning analysis. Englewood Cliffs, NJ:Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aggression===

His research with Walters led to his first book, ''Adolescent Aggression'' in 1959, and to a subsequent book, ''Aggression: A Social Learning Analysis'' in 1973. During a period dominated by behaviorism in the mold of [[B.F. Skinner]], Bandura believed the sole behavioral modifiers of [[Reinforcement|reward]] and [[punishment (psychology)|punishment]] in [[classical conditioning|classical]] and [[operant conditioning]] were inadequate as a framework, and that many human behaviors were learned from other humans. Bandura began to analyze means of treating unduly aggressive children by identifying sources of violence in their lives. Initial research in the area had begun in the 1940s under [[Neal Miller]] and [[John Dollard]]; his continued work in this line eventually culminated in the [[Bobo doll experiment]], and in 1977's hugely influential treatise, ''[[Social Learning Theory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/bandura.htm |title=Albert Bandura |publisher=Criminology.fsu.edu |date=November 30, 1998 |accessdate=December 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411215231/http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/bandura.htm |archivedate=April 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his innovations came from his focus on empirical investigation and reproducible investigation, which were alien to a field of [[psychology]] dominated by the theories of Freud.

In 1961 Bandura conducted a controversial experiment known as the [[Bobo doll experiment]], designed to show that similar behaviors were learned by individuals shaping their own behavior after the actions of models. Bandura's results from this experiment changed the course of modern psychology,&lt;ref name="psychology.about.com"&gt;Cherry, Kendra. "Self Efficacy: Why Believing In Yourself Is So Important." What Is Self-Efficacy? 2015. Web. 28 May 2015. &lt;http://psychology.about.com/od/theoriesofpersonality/a/self_efficacy.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and were widely credited for helping shift the focus in academic psychology from pure [[behaviorism]] to [[cognitive psychology]].{{citation needed |date=February 2012}} Moreover, the Bobo doll experiment emphasized how young individuals are influenced by the acts of adults. When the adults were praised for their aggressive behavior, the children were more likely to keep on hitting the doll. However, when the adults were punished, they consequently stopped hitting the doll as well. The experiment is among the most lauded and celebrated of psychological experiments.

===Social cognitive theory===

By the mid-1980s, Bandura's research had taken a more holistic bent, and his analyses tended towards giving a more comprehensive overview of human cognition in the context of social learning. The theory he expanded from social learning theory soon became known as [[social cognitive theory]].

==== Social foundations of thought and action ====

In 1986, Bandura published ''[[Social Foundations of Thought and Action|Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory]]'' (see [[Social Foundations of Thought and Action|article]]), in which he re-conceptualized individuals as self-organizing, proactive, self-reflecting, and self-regulating, in opposition to the orthodox conception of humans as governed by external forces. He advanced concepts of [[triadic reciprocality]], which determined the connections between human behavior, environmental factors, and personal factors such as cognitive, affective, and biological events, and of [[reciprocal determinism]], governing the causal relations between such factors. Bandura's emphasis on the capacity of agents to self-organize and self-regulate would eventually give rise to his later work on self-efficacy.

=== Self-efficacy ===
In 1963, he published ''Social Learning and Personality Development.'' In 1974, [[Stanford University]] awarded him an endowed chair and he became David Starr Jordan Professor of Social Science in Psychology. In 1977, he published ''Social Learning Theory'', a book that altered the direction psychology took in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="psychology.about.com"/&gt;
 
While investigating the processes by which modeling alleviates [[phobia|phobic]] disorders in snake-phobics, he found that [[self-efficacy]] beliefs (which the phobic individuals had in their own capabilities to alleviate their phobia) mediated changes in behavior and in fear-arousal. He launched a major program of research examining the influential role of self-referent thought in psychological functioning. Although he continued to explore and write on theoretical problems relating to myriad topics, from the late 1970s he devoted much attention to exploring the role of self-efficacy beliefs in human functioning.

In fact, in 2004 Bandura, in conjunction with Charles Benight, found that utilizing the same self-efficacy based beliefs that were implemented for his phobia studies produced similar results on people who suffered from severe debilitating trauma.  It was not only found useful for the trauma suffered by natural disaster survivors, but also those returning veterans that suffer post-traumatic stress disorder that include pervasive hyper-vigilance and recurrent flashbacks. By establishing a perceived sense of control (self-efficacy) over their traumatic experience (cognitively or physically) the veterans and hurricane survivors were able to overcome their distress and trauma and move forward.&lt;ref&gt;Benight, C.C. &amp; Bandura, A. (2004). Social cognitive theory of post-traumatic recovery:The role of perceived self-efficacy. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 42 (10), 1129–1148&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 he published ''[[Social Foundations of Thought and Action|Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory]]'', a book in which he offered a social cognitive theory of human functioning that accords a central role to cognitive, vicarious, self-regulatory and self-reflective processes in human adaptation and change. This theory has its roots in an agentic perspective that views people as self-organizing, proactive, self-reflecting and self-regulating, not just as reactive organisms shaped by [[Natural environment|environmental]] forces or driven by inner impulses. His book, ''[[Self-efficacy: The exercise of control]]'' was published in 1997.

In addition to Bandura's work on self-efficacy in relation to phobias and trauma, he also contributed, in 2008 with Caprara and colleagues, a significant amount to the study of self-efficacy in the education system. His focus was on the continuing technological explosion, in that with more information readily available than ever before the education system needs to focus on teaching students self-regulating efficacy. He argued that self-regulating efficacy is the focus on bolstering students belief that they can not only stay up to date with current technology, but also avoid becoming overwhelmed with its continual shift.  He stated that this will be invaluable as jobs focus more on cognitive abilities as well as flexibility in light of technologies ever-changing use and applicability.&lt;ref&gt;Caprara. (2008). Longitudinal analysis of the role of perceived self-efficacy for self-regulatory learning in academic continuance an achievement, Journal of Educational Psychology, 100(3) 525–534.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral agency===

Bandura applied his [[human agency|human agentic]] view via [[social cognitive theory]] for the personal and social aspects of control over [[moral values]] and conduct.  In particular, he states that in the social cognitive theory of the moral self, [[moral reasoning]] is linked to moral action through affective self-regulatory mechanisms by which moral agency is exercised.&lt;ref name=Bandura&gt;Bandura, A. (2002).  Selective moral disengagement in the exercise of moral agency. Journal of Moral Education, 31 (2), 102.&lt;/ref&gt;  However these self-regulatory mechanisms have to be activated psychosocially.  Bandura found interest in the role that human agency plays when a society does not have safeguards set against particular lapses in [[moral judgment]] that an individual finds justification, morally or otherwise.

First, all people are capable of two [[moral agency|morally agentic]] abilities, to act humanely and to act inhumanely.  Selective [[moral disengagement]] occurs when a person actively disengages their self-regulating efficacy for moral conduct.&lt;ref name="Bandura" /&gt;

Selective moral disengagement occurs via a "cognitive restructuring" of the inhumane acts into something justifiable.  He states the specific processes in which this occurs, they are as follows: moral justification, sanitizing language, exonerative social comparison, disavowal of personal agency in the harm one causes by diffusion or displacement of responsibility, disregarding or minimizing the injurious effects of one's actions, and attribution of blame to/dehumanization of those who are victimized.&lt;ref name="Bandura" /&gt;

== Bandura on education ==

Bandura's [[social learning theory]] contributes to students and teachers within the field of education. In 1986, Bandura changed the name of the social learning theory to [[social cognitive theory]].&lt;ref name=Grusec&gt;Grusec, J.E. (1992). "Social learning theory and developmental psychology: The legacies of Robert Sears and Albert Bandura". ''Developmental Psychology, 28'' (5), 776-786.&lt;/ref&gt; The social cognitive theory still focuses on how behavior and growth are affected by the cognitive operations that occur during social activities.&lt;ref name="Grusec"/&gt; The key theoretical components of the social cognitive theory that are applied in education are [[self-efficacy]], [[self-regulated learning|self-regulation]], [[observational learning]], and [[reciprocal determinism]].

The social cognitive theory can be applied to motivation and learning for students and teachers.&lt;ref name=Golas&gt;Golas, J. (2010. "Effective teacher preparation programs: Bridging the gap between educational technology availability and its utilization". "International Forum of Teaching &amp; Studies, 6" (1), 16-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barabarnelli&gt;Bandura, A.; Barbaranelli, C. (1996). "Multifaceted impact of self-efficacy beliefs on academic functioning". ''Child Development, 67" (3), 1206-1222&lt;/ref&gt; Bandura's research shows that high perceived self-efficacy leads teachers and students to set higher goals and increases the likelihood that they will dedicate themselves to those goals.&lt;ref name="Golas"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;Bandura, A.; Wood, R. (1989). "Effect of perceived controllability and performance standards on self-regulation of complex decision making". ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56'' (5), 805-814&lt;/ref&gt; In an educational setting self-efficacy refers to a student or teacher's confidence to participate in certain actions that will help them achieve distinct goals.&lt;ref name=Elrich&gt;Elrich, R.J.; Russ-Eft, D. (2011). "Applying social cognitive theory to academic advising to access students learning outcomes".

Self-regulation is the process he or she will use to set goals to perform the observed behavior. If the performed behavior leads to successful results, it will encourage them to perform similar behaviors again and validate their use of high self-efficacy.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;

'''Anthony Apesos''' (born 1953) is an American painter and professor of Fine Arts at the [[Art Institute of Boston]] at [[Lesley University]].

[[Image:Anthony Apesos.jpg|thumb|Anthony Apesos (2007)]]

==Biography==

Apesos was born on 6 January 1953 in [[Newark, New Jersey]], the son of John and Helen Apesos.  Later that year, his family returned to [[Philadelphia]], where his parents were restaurateurs.  Apesos attended [[The Episcopal Academy]] from 1965 to 1972, after which he received his A.B. at [[Vassar College]] in Religion.  Apesos studied painting under Morris Blackburn, Arthur de Costa, Ben Kamahira, and Sidney Goodman at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] from 1975 to 1979, and received a M.F.A. in 1991 from the Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts at [[Bard College]].  In 1992, Apesos moved to Boston, and became chair of the Fine Arts department at the [[Art Institute of Boston]] (now part of [[Lesley University]]). Apesos founded AIB's M.F.A. program, and currently is professor of Fine Arts.

==Work==

Apesos's painting, while indebted to the American realist tradition, is informed by a fascination with mythology and archetypical themes; in this respect, his work exhibits striking parallels with the visual art of the Romantic poet and artist [[William Blake]]. Technically, Apesos draws upon the traditions of late Renaissance painting, in particular that of the Venetian masters; his work is characterized by the employment of opalescent scumbles (translucent layers of pigment placed over solid colors to produce effects of depth and texture for the viewer), and inventive, often unsettling modes of composition in which figures and background are juxtaposed in simultaneously traditional and unfamiliar ways.

==Representative paintings==

[http://www.holderness.org/features/2006_apesosexhibit/category.asp?category=paintings ''Snow and Milk'']: here, the binary opposition of white and black, cold and hot, is juxtaposed against the traditional artistic figure of the female nude, providing a symbolic matrix within which to consider the way that Western art has objectified as well as celebrated femininity and the body in general.
	

[http://www.holderness.org/features/2006_apesosexhibit/category.asp?category=paintings ''Recipe'']: composed with a fundamental palette of red, black, and white, and evoking both ancient pictorial traditions (the unveiling of the Vestal Virgin) as well as archetypal symbolism (earth and water, dark and light) to reflect upon the fundamental and yet mysterious nature of human reproduction, focused here upon the powerful and compositionally-central figure of the mother.

{{Cleanup|reason=Lede needs to be rewritten: needs clear definition of what an "Autonomous research robot" is; also the article's name is not "Denning Mobile Robot Company"|date=January 2016}}
The '''Denning Mobile Robot Company''' of [[Boston]] was the first company to offer ready-made [[autonomous robot]]s that were subsequently purchased primarily by researchers. Grinnell More's [[Real World Interface]], Inc. (RWI) and James Slater's [[Nomadic Technologies]] ([[United States|US]]), along with [[Francesco Mondada]]'s K-Team ([[Switzerland]]), were other pioneering companies in this field, addressing the need for ready-made robots for use by robotics researchers. RWI created the B-21, Nomadic the XR4000, whilst the tiny Khepera mobile robot emerged from the stables of the Swiss K-Team. However, the high price of these machines meant that only a few graduate students and military researchers could afford them. Eventually, the low-cost Pioneer robot was introduced in 1995 (from a collaboration between RWI and [[ActivMedia Robotics]]), a project that expanded research in mobile robotics due to the affordable price.

== History ==

By 1999, the Denning company was defunct. In 1998, RWI joined with ISRobotics to form [[iRobot]]. More introduced the [[PackBot]] remote control robot, veering away from autonomous research robots to pursue military markets. Nomadic Technologies also left the field. [[MobileRobots Inc]] and K-Team continued to supply the research community.

In 2003 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) contracted with [[Segway Inc.|Segway]] to convert fifteen [[Segway PT]]s into Segway Robotic Mobility Platforms. Segway and delivered units to DARPA in April. In June DARPA worked with [[SPAWAR Systems Center San Diego]] to distribute the units to 14 government and university research institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.segway.com/downloads/pdfs/Segway-Company-Milestones.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229080423/http://www.segway.com/downloads/pdfs/Segway-Company-Milestones.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Autonomous navigation techniques ==

=== Indoor operation ===

Research robots improved in autonomous indoor operation during the 1990s and the 2000s. Ready-made research bases offer the necessary sensing, mobility and computational power. These include the Pioneer, [[PatrolBot]], PowerBot, and PeopleBot. These platforms can map buildings and navigate out-of-the-box, using [[Simultaneous localization and mapping|SLAM]] and a variation on [[Monte Carlo method]]/Markov localization and modified value-iterated search, with any sensor of the 2-D range-finder class. This method creates a human readable map of the robot's workspace that can control and track robots as they move. [[Evolution Robotics]] offers single-camera [[VSLAM]] software, which replaces [[rangefinder|range-finding]] with visual [[pattern matching|pattern-matching]], but this system cannot create a human-readable map. Other groups are building stereocam-based VSLAM. Because the stereo camera provides range-finding data, maps can be made and robots tracked. The [[khepera mobile robot|K-Team Khepera]], Segway-based platforms and other research robots can link to external computing resources to use such software.

Precision depends upon sensor precision, data granularity and calculation speed. Range-finding lasers may have +/-1&amp;nbsp;cm accuracy while digital stereo camera accuracy is limited to .25 pixel and thus is range-dependent. Vision-based systems require more computational resources than simple range-finding systems such as lasers, but may employ a [[digital signal processor]] embedded with the camera. Cost/precision trade-offs led to less expensive vision-based systems on consumer robots while commercial and [[industrial robot]]s and [[automated guided vehicle]]s (AGVs) tend to use laser-based systems.

=== Outdoor operation ===

Outdoors, localization is primarily handled with [[GPS]], however, satellite signals can frequently be lost due to obstructions. Without a robots typically use [[dead reckoning]] and inertial motion tracking. Dead reckoning relies on relative wheel motion and is subject to cumulative slippage errors. Inertial motion tracking uses [[rate gyro]]scopes and [[accelerometer]]s to measure motion. Accuracy depends upon sensor quality and calibration. The Segway RMP 400 and Seekur robots are two of the platforms designed for such research; most other outdoor research robots are [[jerry-rig]]ged from existing vehicles.

In constrained outdoor areas, some robots, such as the John Deere Gator, simply surround the perimeter with [[radio beacon]]s and use simple [[triangulation]] from three or more beacons to localize and navigate. Beacons are also used indoors by older AGVs in factories.

== Programming ==

Much research software for autonomous robots is [[Free Software]] or [[Open Source Software]], including: [[Robot Operating System]], [[Carmen Toolkit|Carmen]] from [[Carnegie Mellon]], Player/Stage/Gazebo from the [[University of Southern California]] and the ARIA [[API]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://robots.mobilerobots.com ARIA API libraries]&lt;/ref&gt; from MobileRobots Inc. [[URBI]] with a Free Software SDK, is used in many universities.

Commercial software includes [[Webots]], which has been developed since 1998 and is licensed by more than 500 universities. It runs on [[Linux]], [[Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]]. In June 2006, [[Microsoft Research]] began offering free beta-test copies of a [[Robotics Studio]] software development kit with Pioneer robots in simulation for [[Windows XP]].

__NOTOC__
The term '''study circle''' has become common terminology in the [[Bahá'í Faith]] to describe a specific type of gathering for the study of the [[Bahá'í teachings]], with an emphasis on "promoting the well-being of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;The introduction to 'Reflections on the Life of the Spirit' states that the Institute's purpose is "to use the courses as means of serving the Cause and promoting the well-being of humanity." (p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Study circles are a form of [[distance learning]] designed to systematically bring education about spiritual concepts to the grassroots level.  Because they are intended to be sustainable and reproducible on a large scale, study circles shy away from formally taught classes, opting instead for participatory methods.  They are usually led by a tutor whose role is not to act as an expert but rather to facilitate the rhythm and pace of the study circle.  In this way, attendees of study circles are expected to become active participants in their own learning process.

Another foundational principle of study circles is a heavy emphasis on the [[:Category:Bahá'í texts|Bahá'í writings]] as a means of finding unity of vision and action by focusing on the essentials of Bahá'í belief.

At the present time, the most common curriculum used in study circles is one that was originally developed at the [[Ruhi Institute]] in [[Colombia]] but is now used in Bahá'í communities all over the world.  Because of its origin, most [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] refer to this curriculum as the Ruhi sequence or Ruhi materials.  Additional courses used by study circles vary from country to country and include the "Fundamental Verities" and "Core Curriculum" materials developed in the United States, among others.

The '''Council of School Supervisors &amp; Administrators''' ('''CSA''') is a New York City based [[collective bargaining]] unit for Principals, Assistant Principals, Supervisors and Education Administrators who work in the New York City public schools and Directors and Assistant Directors who work in city-funded day care. It was founded in 1962 as the "Council of Supervisory Associations."&lt;ref&gt;Council of School Supervisors &amp; Administrators (2010). "About Us", New York, NY.&lt;http://www.csa-nyc.org/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, the CSA has played a major role in NYC public schools, including arguing successfully for salary increases, a salary index, and creating a welfare fund for its employees. It became a member of the [[AFL-CIO]] in 1971 as part of a new national organization.

According to CSA's Department of Labor records since 2005, about half of the union's membership are considered retirees, with eligibility to vote in the union. CSA contracts also often cover some non-members, known as [[agency fee]] payers, which usually number comparatively about 2% of the size of the union's membership.&lt;ref name="OLMS"/&gt; Currently, this accounts for 6,698 retirees, and 210 non-members paying agency fees, compared to 6,046 "active" members.&lt;ref name="OLMS_LM-2_2014-12-05"/&gt;

==History==

===1962-1964: Early Years===
In January, 1962, eleven supervisory associations form the "Council of Supervisory Associations" in order to fight for a salary index. The eleven charter members include supervisory groups from Assistant Principal to Assistant Superintendent. The new, united organization is created to allow school administrators to more effectively advocate for their rights and interests, as well as to help improve the quality of NYC public school education.

In March, 1962, the Board of Education gives the Council de facto recognition and issues a written policy statement recognizing the supervisors' right to present their views regarding their salaries, hours and working conditions.

One of the Council's earliest agreements is on a salary index. This index establishes a relationship between the salaries of supervisors and the teachers they supervise as well as between groups of supervisors. In 1962, this index is partially implemented and results in the single highest increase for supervisors in several years. By 1963, the Council's representative in Albany secures passage of a mandatory supervisory salary index in New York City, which is then extended in 1964 to include elementary, junior and senior high school principals across the state.

On July 1, 1964, the CSA Major Medical Expense Insurance Plan goes into effect on with more than 900 supervisors enrolled.

===1965-1966: Recognition by the Board of Education, Establishment of Welfare Fund===
The Council is formally recognized by the Board of Education on May 5, 1965, as the representative of all persons eligible for membership in each of its constituent organizations. The memorandum calls for monthly consultations between the CSA and the Superintendent of Schools - and at least once a year with the Board of Education - on matters of educational policy, working conditions, salary schedules, and grievance procedures. This is the first agreement of its kind granted to supervisors in the nation.

In Spring, 1965, the "CSA Welfare Fund" is established. The Board of Education agrees to provide $140 per CSA member to the Fund. In June 1966, the trustees decide to provide supplemental major medical insurance, extended Blue Cross coverage and life insurance as well.

In September, 1966, the CSA establishes a full-time office in Brooklyn.

===1969: Comprehensive Contract===
CSA negotiates its first written contract with the Board of Education in the fall of 1969. The agreement, the first comprehensive contract for school supervisors in the United States, runs for a three-year term beginning October 1, 1969. The agreement provides for substantial salary increases, a pension package, grievance machinery with advisory arbitration as the last step, a special complaints procedure in cases of harassment, regular sabbaticals, and an option for preretirement leave in lieu of accumulated sabbaticals.

===1971: CSA joins the AFL-CIO===
Following a membership referendum, CSA joins the [[AFL-CIO]] as Local 1 of a new, nationally chartered union, the School Administrators and Supervisors Organizing Committee, later named [[American Federation of School Administrators]] (AFSA). Since labor affiliation required individual membership on a one-man, one-vote basis, the name of the CSA is changed from the "Council of Supervisory Associations" to the "Council of Supervisors and Administrators."

===1976-80: Collective Bargaining Agreements, Day Care Directors Join===
The contract negotiated with the Board of Education in September, 1976, gives CSA the right to take a grievance dispute to final and binding arbitration. Successor agreements in 1978 include substantial cost of living adjustments, bonus monies, eight percent raises over the life of the contract, additional sabbaticals, and the elimination of 26 hours of conference time for all tenured supervisors.

In 1976, CSA negotiates the first contract between CSA and the Day Care Council of New York, Inc., covering the Professional Association of Day Care Directors.

===1980: Contract Developments Continue===
A new contract signed in 1980 offers significant changes, including a new group added to the collective bargaining unit (Education Administrators), an eight percent salary increase over two years, and an increase for per session employees. A new Day Care Contract is also negotiated and leads to substantial improvements in salary and working conditions for Directors and Assistant Directors.

===1981: Day Care Council / CSA Welfare Fund Established===
The former CSA Welfare Fund becomes the Day Care Council / CSA Welfare Fund, and eventually covers prescription drugs, expanded hospitalization coverage, dental plans and some emergency services not covered by the employer.

===2002: Name Change===
In 2002, the "Council of Supervisors and Administrators" becomes the "Council of School Supervisors and Administrators." CSA also introduces a professional development organization, the Executive Leadership Institute, and eventually opens Educational Leadership Centers in five boroughs. ELI establishes itself as a premiere program offering training for all its members with a wealth of single topic workshops as well as targeted programs for new and experienced Assistant Principals, aspiring Principals, Education Administrators and Day Care Directors. In 2008-09, ELI begins a collaboration with and receives funding from the Leadership Academy to provide training for Principals.

===2004-2005: Retiree Chapter Forms, Day Care Strike===
In May, 2004, the Executive Board approves the formation of a Retiree Chapter. By June, 2005, the Retiree Chapter has over 5,000 members. The Executive Board votes to merge the CSA Retiree Chapter with the Retired School Supervisors Association. Later that month, the RSSA votes for the merger as well.

In June, 2004, with no contract in sight, Day Care Directors go on strike in conjunction with Day Care workers from Local 1707 shutting nearly all the city’s 350 city-subsidized Day Care Centers. In May, 2005, Day Care members overwhelmingly vote to ratify a new contract. The contract offers members $1,200 upon ratification, and a 14.5 percent raise over the length of the deal, which expires June 30, 2006. It also adds tens of thousands of dollars a year to the CSA Day Care Welfare Fund.

===2012: CSA Celebrates 50th Anniversary; CSA Office Moves to Manhattan===
In 2012, CSA celebrated 50 years since its founding with a gala at the Waldorf=Astoria in New York. Academy Award-winning actor and AFL-CIO member Susan Sarandon introduced AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka, who addressed the guests on the importance of unions and labor in trying economic times, and discussed his thoughts on the upcoming presidential election. He vigorously endorsed the incumbent, President Barack Obama. Approximately 800 CSA members and friends attended the event.

On May 4, 2012, after half a century in Brooklyn, CSA moved its headquarters to 40 Rector Street in lower Manhattan.

==Executive Leadership Institute (ELI)==
Founded in 2002, the Executive Leadership Institute (ELI) is CSA's professional development program. It is "designed to deliver practical, relevant and essential professional development for today's school leaders."&lt;ref name="Executive Leadership Institute (ELI)"&gt;[http://csa-nyc.org/executive-leadership-institute Executive Leadership Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901083259/http://www.csa-nyc.org/executive-leadership-institute |date=2010-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seminars are led by former administrators on a variety of topics ranging from “Supporting the Low Performing Teacher,” “Instructional Leadership for Students with Diverse Needs,” to data management and software training.

The '''Escuela de Educación Técnica Nº7 (EET Nº7)''', (also called '''IMPA'''), is a high school institution in [[Quilmes| Quilmes City]], [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. It is directly administered by the [[Dirección General de Escuelas y Educación]] and the [[Argentine Air Force]] and located in the Area [[Material Quilmes]].

==IMPA==

Before the Area Material Quilmes was established in the place where now there was not an industrial facility called "IMPA" which was short for "Plastic Metalworkers Argentinas". When the school was founded in 1957, there was a tower within Quilmes, which had the IMPA logo painted on it; this tower is visible from the Avenue Otamendi. Then the tower was painted, although the slogan IMPA remained visible from despite painting. Finally the front of the tower was cut off and removed the IMPA slogan for this school and it earned the nickname "IMPA", in reference to that company. Later, the school adopted the theme and the fact that his motto in the Spanish acronym "Progress Action Master Identity".

==History of the college==

The school began operations in March 1957, first under the jurisdiction of the Regional Workshop Quilmes. The school's mission was to educate apprentices for the workshops of aircraft operators. On April 25, 1962, Quilmes Regional Workshop and the National Council of Technical Education agreed and the school officially began operating as a secondary school under the name of the  National Technical Education School No. 4 "Taller de Quilmes regional" using the facilities and assets provided by the Argentinian Air Force. Since 1971, the electronics technician degree has been offered at the  school, and it graduated its first class of electronics technicians in 1973. The title of Technical Aviation has offered since 1973, and it graduated its  first class of aeronautical technicians in 1975. After the 1999 reforms of secondary schools in Buenos Aires, the electronics technician degree was replaced by the qualification of avionics technician. The school was renamed the School of Technical Education No. 7 "Taller Regional Quilmes"

==Academic life==

Classes begin at 7:35 and end at 15:30 (basic cycle) with a second class finishing at 17:40.

To become a student at this institution, one must take an entrance exam which is evaluated (by the year to which they will be entering). Mathematics is a necessary qualification. In the fourth year there is specialisation between Aeronautical and Avionics.

==Years of study==

* 1st year: basic cycle unskilled
* 2nd year: without basic cycle expertise
* 3rd year: without basic cycle expertise
* 4th year: Aviation Avionics-cycle or higher
* 5th year: what is chosen in 4th year - cycle higher
* 6th year: what is chosen in 4th year - cycle higher
* 7th year: what is chosen in 4th year - cycle higher

== Academics ==
Classes begin at 7:30 in the morning, ending at 5:40 in the afternoon (high school).
Classes begin at 7:30 in the morning, ending at 3:40 in the afternoon (middle school).

Students enter the school in first year in the 3rd EGB cycle (7th, 8th and 9th grade). If this is completed, students begin the Polimodal (10th, 11th and 12th grade); if this is completed, the student receives the bachelor diploma. If the student decides to do so, he can enter the technician year; if completed, the student receives the technician degree.

'''eNotes''' is a student and teacher [[educational website]] founded in 1998, that provides material to help students complete homework assignments and study for exams.
 
Based in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] in the [[United States]], eNotes specializes in [[lesson plan]]s, [[study guides]] and [[literary criticism]]s and is widely cited across the [[World Wide Web|web]]. It also hosts an active homework help portal where students can ask educators academic questions. The Homework Help section has hundreds of thousands of questions with answers.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news

In sociology, the term '''ethnic nepotism''' describes a human tendency for [[in-group bias]] or in-group favouritism applied by [[nepotism]] for people with the same [[ethnicity]] within a [[multi-ethnic society]].

The term was coined in the 1960s in the context of the ethnic (tribal) tensions and rivalry in the then-recently independent states in Sub-Saharan Africa such as [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. The Journal of modern African studies 7 (1969), p. 23 in reference to "ethnic nepotism" among the [[Mbaise]] in Nigeria;
Audrey C. Smock, ''Ibo politics: the role of ethnic unions in Eastern Nigeria'',  Harvard University Press, 1971.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociobiological theory==
{{off topic|date=January 2012}}
The theory views [[ethnocentrism]] and [[racism]] as nepotism toward extended kin and an extension of [[kin selection]]. In other words, ethnic nepotism points toward a biological basis for the phenomenon of people preferring others of the same ethnicity or race; it explains the tendency of humans to favor members of their own racial group by postulating that all animals evolve toward being more altruistic toward kin in order to propagate more copies of their common genes.

"The myth of common descent", proposed by many social scientists as a prominent ethnic marker, is in his view often not a myth at all.{{clarify |date= January 2012}} "Ethnicity is defined by common descent and maintained by [[endogamy]]".&lt;ref name=Dennen2000&gt;{{Citation | title = Book review of Vanhanen ‘Ethnic Conflicts’ | first = Johan M.G. | last = van der Dennen | journal = Human Ethology Bulletin | volume = 15 | number = 3 | year = 2000 | pages = 12–14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To guard one's genetic interests, [[Frank Salter]] notes altruism toward one's co-ethnics:

{{Quote|Hamilton's 1975 model of a genetic basis for tribal altruism shows that it is theoretically possible to defend ethnic genetic interests in an adaptive manner, even when the altruism entails self sacrifice.  He argued mathematically that an act of altruism directed towards the tribe was adaptive if it protected the aggregate of distant relatives in the tribe.  In sexually-reproducing species a population's genetic isolation leads to rising levels of interrelatedness of its members and thus makes greater altruism adaptive.  Low levels of immigration between tribes allow growing relatedness of tribal members, which in turn permits selection of altruistic acts directed at tribal members, but only if these acts "actually aid in group fitness in some way…" Closely related individuals are less likely to free ride and more likely to invest in and thus strengthen the group as a whole, improving the fitness of its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Salter | first = Frank | title = On Genetic Interests | page = 125}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Regarding how this translates into politics and why homogeneous societies are more altruistic, [[Frank Salter]] writes:

{{Quote|Relatively homogeneous societies invest more in public goods, indicating a higher level of public altruism.  For example, the degree of ethnic homogeneity correlates with the government's share of gross domestic product as well as the average wealth of citizens.  Case studies of the United States, Africa and South-East Asia find that multi-ethnic societies are less charitable and less able to cooperate to develop public infrastructure.  Moscow beggars receive more gifts from fellow ethnics than from other ethnics.  A recent multi-city study of municipal spending on public goods in the United States found that ethnically or racially diverse cities spend a smaller portion of their budgets and less per capita on public services than do the more homogenous cities.{{Sfn | Salter | p = 146}}}}

[[J. Philippe Rushton]] has complemented kin selection and ethnic nepotism by his genetic similarity theory which proposes that "genetically similar people tend to seek one another out and to provide mutually supportive environments such as marriage, friendship, and social groups. This may represent a biological factor underlying ethnocentrism and group selection".&lt;ref name=Dennen2000/&gt; He has also argued that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[B]ecause fellow ethnics carry copies of the same genes, ethnic consciousness is rooted in the biology of altruism and mutual reciprocity. Thus ethnic nationalism, xenophobia and genocide can become the ‘dark side’ of altruism. Moreover, shared genes can govern the degree to which an ideology is adopted. Some genes will replicate better in some cultures than in others. Religious, political and class conflicts become heated because they affect genetic fitness. Karl Marx did not take his analysis far enough: ideology may be the servant of economic interest, but genes influence both. Since individuals have a greater concentration of genetic interest (inclusive fitness) in their own ethnic group than they do in other ethnic groups, they can be expected to adopt ideas that promote their group over others. Political ethologist Frank Salter refers to ideologies as ‘fitness portfolios’, and psychologist [[Kevin B. MacDonald|Kevin MacDonald]] has described co-ethnics as engaging in "group evolutionary strategies."&lt;ref&gt;Rushton, J. Philipe, [http://www.charlesdarwinresearch.org/Nations%20and%20Nationalism%2005.pdf "Ethnic Nationalism, evolutionary psychology and Genetic Similarity Theory,"] ''Nations and Nationalism'', Vol. 11, Oct. 2005. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015011041/http://www.charlesdarwinresearch.org/Nations%20and%20Nationalism%2005.pdf |date=October 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Rushton's interpretation it is not clear whether the proposed genetic likeness that supports ethnic nepotism is limited to external appearance, or it also includes other loci.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} If that is the case, it would be difficult to deduct how similar [[blood types]] or [[creatine]] levels, or others, among the multitude of invisible phenotype traits, contribute to determine the bonding behavior towards people carrying the alleged similar alleles. Also, there is no clue offered as to which of these specific alleles are the most important for expression of ethnic nepotism. Hamiltonian kin selection (in itself very controversial) refers exclusively to defined sets of discrete behaviors that are innate, not learned&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/&lt;/ref&gt; and increase the reproductive fitness among very close kin, whereas ethnic nepotism would appear to depend heavily on social interactions and on [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], or physical characteristics.

According to research by Van der Dennen, "ethnocentrism-cum-xenophobia" seems universally present in preindustrial societies (and in many primate and social carnivore species).&lt;ref name=Dennen2000/&gt;

[[Tatu Vanhanen]] in his 1999 book ''Ethnic Conflicts Explained by Ethnic Nepotism'' empirically examined the relationships between the degree of ethnic homogeneity, the degree of ethnic conflicts, and the degree of democratization in the nations of the world. He found that more ethnically heterogeneous nations had more ethnic conflicts. The degree of democratization explained very little of the degree of ethnic conflicts except that very authoritarian states such as the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia could suppress ethnic conflicts. Ethnic conflicts were only slightly less common in more economically developed countries. They appeared within all racial groups, cultures, and geographical regions. In Vanhanen's view, people have a genetic tendency to easily learn ethnic attitudes and psychological mechanisms leading to prejudice, scapegoating, and discrimination.

'''Evolutionary educational psychology''' is the study of the relation between inherent folk knowledge and abilities and accompanying [[inference|inferential]] and [[attributional bias]]es as these influence [[academic]] [[learning]] in [[evolutionarily]] novel [[cultural]] contexts, such as [[school]]s and the industrial workplace. The fundamental premises and principles of this discipline are presented below.

==Premises==

*(a) aspects of [[mind]] and [[human brain|brain]] that have [[evolution|evolved]] to draw the individuals’ [[attention]] to and facilitate the processing of social ([[folk psychology]]), biological ([[folk biology]]), physical ([[folk physics]]) information patterns that facilitated survival or [[Reproductive success|reproductive outcomes]] during [[human evolution]] (Cosmides &amp; Tooby, 1994; Geary, 2005; Gelman, 1990; Pinker, 1997; Shepard, 1994; Simon, 1956);
*(b) although [[brain plasticity|plastic]] to some degree, these primary abilities are inherently constrained to the extent associated information patterns tended to be consistent across generations and within lifetimes (e.g., Caramazza &amp; Shelton, 1998; Geary &amp; Huffman, 2002);
*(c) other aspects of mind and brain evolved to enable the [[mental model|mental generation]] of potential future social, ecological, or climatic conditions and enable rehearsal of behaviors to cope with variation in these conditions, and are now known as general [[fluid intelligence]], or gF (including skill at everyday reasoning/problem solving; Chiappe &amp; MacDonald, 2005; Geary, 2005; Mithen, 1996); and
*(d) children are inherently motivated to learn in folk domains, with the associated attentional and behavioral biases resulting in experiences that automatically and implicitly flesh out and adapt these systems to local conditions (Gelman, 1990; Gelman &amp; Williams, 1998; Gelman, 2003).

==Principles==

The principles of evolutionary educational psychology represent the foundational assumptions for an evolutionary educational psychology. The gist is knowledge and expertise that is useful in the cultural milieu or [[population|ecology in which the group is situated]] will be transferred across generations in the form of [[cultural artifact]]s, such as books, or learning traditions, as in [[apprenticeship]]s (e.g., Baumeister, 2005; Richerson &amp; Boyd, 2005; Flinn, 1997; Mithen, 1996). Across generations, the store of cultural knowledge accumulates and creates a gap between this knowledge base and the forms of folk knowledge and abilities that [[epigenetics|epigenetically]] emerge with children’s self-initiated activities.

There must of course be an evolved potential to learn evolutionarily novel information and an associated bias to seek novelty during the [[child development stages|developmental period]] and indeed throughout the [[life expectancy|life span]]; this may be related to the [[openness to experience]] dimension of [[Personality type|personality]] (Geary, 1995, 2002, in press).

However, the cross-generational accumulation of knowledge across cultures, individuals, and domains (e.g., people vs. physics) has resulted in an exponential increase in the quantity of secondary knowledge available in modern societies today. For most people, the breadth and complexity of this knowledge will very likely exceed any biases to learn in evolutionary novel domains.

==The creation vs. the learning of knowledge==

A related issue concerns the traits that enable the ''creation'' of biologically secondary knowledge and thus culture and the extent to which these traits overlap with the ability to ''learn'' knowledge created by others.

Stated differently, Is the goal of education to have children recreate the process of discovery, to learn the products of discovery, or some combination? Some educators have advocated a focus on the process of discovery without full consideration of the constellation of traits and opportunity that contribute to the creation of secondary knowledge (e.g., Cobb, Yackel, &amp; Wood, 1992). In fact, research on creative-productive individuals suggests that the full constellation of traits that facilitate the discovery and creation of secondary knowledge is rare and not likely reproducible on a large scale (Simonton, 1999a, 1999b, 2003; Sternberg, 1999; Wai, Lubinski, &amp; Benbow, 2005).

==Summary==

===Premises===

*1.) [[Natural selection]] has resulted in an evolved [[motivational]] disposition to attempt to gain access to and control of the resources that have covaried with survival and reproductive outcomes during human evolution.
*2.) These resources fall into three broad categories: social, biological, and physical which correspond to the respective domains of folk psychology, folk biology, and folk physics.
*3.) Attentional, [[perceptual]], and [[cognitive]] systems, including inferential and [[attributional bias]]es, have evolved to process information in these folk domains and to guide control-related behavioral strategies. These systems process restricted classes of information associated with these folk domains.
*4.) To cope with variation in social, ecological, or climatic conditions, systems that enabled the mental generation of these potential future conditions and enabled rehearsals of behaviors to cope with this variation evolved and the supporting attentional and cognitive mechanisms are known as general [[fluid intelligence]] and everyday reasoning.
*5.) Children are biologically biased to engage in activities that recreate the ecologies of human evolution; these are manifested as social [[play (activity)|play]], and exploration of the environment and objects. The accompanying experiences interact with the inherent but skeletal folk systems and flesh out these systems such that they are adapted to the local social group and ecology.

===Principles===

*1.) [[Scientific]], [[technological]], and [[academic]] advances initially emerged from the cognitive and motivational systems that support folk psychology, folk biology, and folk physics. Innovations that enabled better control of ecologies or [[social dynamics]] or resulted in a coherent (though not necessarily scientifically accurate) understanding of these dynamics are likely to be retained across generations as [[cultural artifact]]s (e.g., books) and [[tradition]]s (e.g. [[apprenticeship]]s). These advances result in an ever growing gap between folk knowledge and the theories and knowledge base of the associated sciences and other disciplines (e.g., [[literature]]).
*2.) [[School]]s emerge in societies in which scientific, technological, and intellectual advances result in a gap between folk knowledge and the competencies needed for living in the society.
*3.) The function of schools is to organize the activities of children such that they acquire the biologically secondary competencies that close the gap between folk knowledge and the occupational and social demands of the [[society]].
*4.) Biologically secondary competencies are built from primary folk systems and the components of fluid intelligence that evolved to enable individuals to cope with variation and novelty.
*5.) Children's inherent motivational bias to engage in activities that will adapt folk knowledge to local conditions will often conflict with the need to engage in activities that will result in secondary learning.
*6.) The need for [[education|explicit instruction]] will be a direct function of the degree to which the secondary competency differs from the supporting primary systems.

==History==

In 1892, José Francisco da Rocha Pombo, an intellectual of the state of Paraná would have initiated the construction of the University, but his project was frustrated by the Federalist Movement.

Twenty years later, Paraná had a reduced number of intellectuals (nine doctors and four engineers), but it was in true development because of the production of the [[yerba mate]].

Moreover, at this time, the [[Contestado War]] appeared as an incentive to the efforts of political leaderships concerning the creation of a university. In this context, [[Victor Ferreira do Amaral]], deputy and director of public instruction of Paraná, started the effective creation of the University.

On December 19, 1912 the University was established and, in 1913, it has initiated its activities as a private institution in an old building situated on Comendador Araújo street. The first courses offered were [[Law|Juridical and Social Sciences]], Engineering, [[Medicine|Medicine and Surgery]], Commerce, [[Dentistry]], [[Pharmacy|Pharmacy and Obstetrics]]. After the establishment of the University, Victor Ferreira do Amaral, who was also its first president, initiated the construction of a central building in a land donated by the municipal government.

Due to the economic recession caused by the World War I, difficulties started to appear. In 1920, a federal law determined the closing of all universities. In a contradictory measure, the federal government created the ''Universidade do Rio de Janeiro'', currently ''[[Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro]]'' (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro). The alternative to this law was to split the UFPR in several colleges.

Throughout several years, efforts in order to restore the university took place. Only in the beginning of the fifties the colleges were reunited once again in the University of Paraná, its federalization happening just after that, in 1951, when the university became a public and free-of-charge institution.

After its federalization, a process of expansion began with the construction of the Clinic's Hospital ('''[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]:''' ''Hospital de Clínicas da Universidade Federal do Paraná'') in 1953, the ''Reitoria'' Campus in 1958 and the Polytechnic Center in 1961. The Polytechnic Center campus occupies {{convert|617,128|m2|ft2}}.&lt;ref name="t"/&gt;

==Historical Building==
[[Image:Universidade Federal do Parana 4 Curitiba Parana.jpg|200px|right|thumb|UFPR – ''Historic building at Santos Andrade Square, in Curitiba'']]
The construction placed in the Santos Andrade Square began to be built in 1913, being a project of the military engineer Baeta de Faria. Its inauguration occurred in 1915.

Seven years later, in 1923, two lateral parts were added, according to the original project. The building of the right sector was ended in 1925 and was designated to the Engineering graduation course. In the following year, the left sector had been finalized and it passed to serve the Dentistry course. Other additions were made to the right side of the building and it has received in its totality new paint in 1940. The building was extended towards XV de Novembro Street and, in 1952, new works in the right section led to the demolition of part of the lateral façade built in 1940.

In 1954, the building occupied a whole block between the Santos Andrade Square, XV de Novembro Street, Presidente Faria Street and Alfredo Bufren Lane. The last modifications were made: a new façade with several columns and a wide set of staircases were projected and the covered dome was eliminated. The inauguration of the neoclassical, 17,000 square meter building, took place in 1955.

In the year on 1999, the mayor of Curitiba signed a law that made this building the official symbol of the city.

===Technical High School===

Besides the above-mentioned courses, it offers high school education through its Technical High School. [http://www.et.ufpr.br/]

==Admissions==

Students are admitted by an entrance exam, known as the [[vestibular]], which consists of two parts:

*'''Part I''' is composed of 80 multiple-choice questions including nine questions of each of the following subjects: Portuguese, Literature, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Geography, History and Biology, plus eight questions of a foreign language which can be chosen from English, French, Spanish, German or Italian.

Over 50,000 people apply every year and sit for exactly the same exam. After two weeks time or so, 15,000 are called to take the Part II (or Phase II) written exams.

*'''Part II''' is composed of a Portuguese test which covers five (previously seven) compulsory writing essays. Certain courses require that the candidate take an additional one or two exams involving open-questions in Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Geography, History, Biology, Philosophy or [[Sociology]], the specific exam choice being determined by correlation between the subject and each major course. Engineering candidates, for example, take Mathematics and Physics tests.

The wait for the results of Part II is much longer and the results may take something between 4 and 7 weeks. A list with all the admitted candidates comes out usually in the middle of January—on the same day as the ''Mud-bath Party'' sponsored by the Central Directory of Students ('''[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]:''' Diretório Central dos Estudantes, DCE) occurs.

'''Fedir Ivanovych Danylak''' ({{lang-uk|Федір Іванович Даниляк}}) (born 1955) is an innovative dancer, [[balletmaster]], [[choreography|choreographer]] and artistic director of the [[Barvinok Ukrainian School of Dance]] in [[Mississauga]], [[Ontario]], Canada.

== Early days, Education ==
Fedir Danylak was born on September 2, 1955 in [[Pukiv]], in the [[Ukrainian SSR]] of the [[Soviet Union]] (today in the [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast]] of western [[Ukraine]]). Growing up in a large family during the Communist rule of Ukraine was not easy, yet from an early age Fedir always showed that he had a talent for entertaining. He loved to perform in front of crowds in his native village and after graduating from the high school, he was accepted into the [[Snyatyn College of Culture]] where he studied the art of Ukrainian dance and received training in ballet, choreography and dance. Upon his graduation, he was drafted into the [[Soviet Army]], serving in the Long Range Missile Defence group in [[Sochi]].

The completion of his military assignment was followed by the acceptance into the [[Kiev State Institute of Culture]], where Fedir received further training in teaching, training of Folk Dance Directors, and choreography in Ukrainian Folk Dance as well as other international dance styles, including Latin American dances ([[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|chacha]], [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]], [[Merengue (dance)|merengue]], [[rhumba]], etc.). Fedir also received extended training in Ballroom dance styles such as [[foxtrot]], [[waltz]], [[quickstep]], and [[Tango (ballroom)|tango]].

After graduating from the [[Kiev]] Institute with a Diploma in Choreography, Fedir join a professional Ukrainian Dance Ensemble in [[Ivano-Frankivsk]], Ukraine. The [[Hutsul Ensemble of Song and Dance]] was an ideal place for Fedir to experience and learn about the culture and dances of the Western part of [[Ukraine]]. It was in Ivano-Frankivsk that he met his future wife Hrystyna and it was in Ivano-Frankivsk oblast that he chose to settle and begin his professional career as a choreographer.

== Choreographer ==
He accepted the position of Professor of Choreography at the [[Kalush, Ukraine|Kalush]] College of Culture. Beginning his teaching career, Fedir aspired to create a broader awareness of [[Ukrainian Dance]] among his community and in [[Kalush, Ukraine|Kalush]] as a whole. His love of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] folk traditions led him to found the first Ukrainian Folk Ensemble Merezhyvo, as an extension of the Kalush College of Culture. Throughout its years, Merezhyvo served as a starting point for Fedir's students to gain professional dance and choreography experience in both Ukrainian and other International dances. Many of his students, after graduating from the College of Culture and the Merezhyvo Dance Ensemble, became professional dancers, choreographers, teachers, some founding and leading Ukrainian dance schools in Ukraine and abroad.

While teaching at the college in Kalush, Fedir was recruited to perform in an amateur Ukrainian Dance Ensemble [[Pokuttya]], in the neighbouring city of [[Kolomyia]]. Participation in the ensemble allowed Fedir to further expand his significant knowledge of the folk dance traditions of the Western Ukraine regions. Also, while working under the talented choreographer and artistic director [[Dana Demkiv]] helped Fedir gain experience in management of a professional dance school. Being part of the ensemble Pokuttya also gave Fedir the opportunity to perform on the international stage.

== In Canada ==
In late 1996, Fedir Danylak and his family immigrated to Canada. The city of [[Toronto]], with its vibrant and sizable Ukrainian community offered Fedir plenty of opportunity to continue in his chosen career as a teacher and choreographer. In the first year, Fedir taught Ukrainian dance at a number of Ukrainian dance school in Toronto area. [[Vesnianka]] and Academy of Ukrainian Dance presented him with the experience of teaching dance at the Ukrainian community abroad.

=== Elmbank ===
The immigration and settling in Canada was not an easy path to follow. According to Canadian Education Standards, Fedir's university diploma from Ukraine was only equated to a simple bachelor's degree from University of Toronto. This, however, was not enough to prevent Fedir from following his chosen path as an educator. With help from his friends and family he got started as a substitute teacher at the [[Toronto District School Board]], eventually earning an Ontario College of Teacher diploma, which allowed him to become a fully qualified teacher in Ontario. Hard work and perseverance pushed him to take on specialized course work and in time become a fully qualified Special Education Teacher. With support from [[Lesa Semsecen]], then a Vice Principal at the Toronto's [[Elmbank Junior Middle Academy]], he was hired as a special education teacher at the school.

=== Barvinok ===
The year 1997 began a new path for Fedir Danylak. He was introduced to Barvinok Ukrainian Dance Ensemble's executive committee by his friend Myroslava Cummings. During the trial period at the dance school, Fedir impressed the committee with his vast knowledge of Ukrainian Dance and his ability to impart his knowledge onto his students, from little five-year-olds to dancers in their early twenties. The decades of experience teaching Ukrainian Dance in Ukraine served as a starting point in his career as an Artistic Director of Barvinok.

Soon after his hiring, Fedir's dedication to the school and his hard work earned him a position as an Artistic Director.&lt;ref&gt;http://barvinok.org/pages/artistic-director&lt;/ref&gt; This new role allowed him to take the school in the new direction, introduce his unique teaching methodology. As the years went on the people in the Ukrainian Community in Toronto began to notice the changes in Barvinok School of Dance. Improved quality of both dancers and dances wow the attendees of multiple multicultural dance festivals in Toronto. Dedication of the parents helped to increase the efficiency of how the school was run and allowed the freedom for Fedir to dedicate himself expand the school's dance repertoire and improve overall dance education quality.

The results were earned with hard work of both Fedir Danylak and the dancer's parents. The first trip to Ukraine in 2000 culminated with a 1st place at the International Ukrainian Dance Competition in Yalta. Participation in numerous festivals and formal events helped spread the popularity of the school and its attendance group from over a hundred students, when Fedir began, to over four hundred dancers in 2009-2010 year. Still there was more to be done, and Fedir enthusiastically followed his chosen path. In 2004, the second trip was again successful, with performances in Kharkiv at the city's 350th anniversary and in front of the thousands of spectators for the Ukraine's Independence Day in 2004.

[[Image:Fedir Danylak With Yushchenko.JPG|thumb|left|Fedir Danylak with Ukraine's President, 2008]]
Organized by Fedir Danylak, with the help of parental committee, third trip in 2008 was a commemorative 40th anniversary tour celebrating 40 years since the creation of Barvinok Ukrainian School of Dance. This tour featured performances in [[Lviv]], [[Pukiv]], [[Rohatyn]], [[Ternopil]] and [[Kiev]]. Its most memorable presentation, choreographed and produced by Fedir was the [[Holodomor]] dance suite. Created as a commemorate the victims of the 1932-1933 genocide of Ukrainian people, it was performed at the annual [[Ukrainian World Congress]] in front of the then president [[Viktor Yuschenko]] and prime-minister [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] of Ukraine. It gained further acclaim when it was performed at an event commemorating the Holodomor victims on November 29, 2008 in Toronto Canada.

A '''G-seat''' is an exact replica of an ejection seat in a jet fighter, but equipped with additional systems that provide [[Haptic communication|haptic]] feedback to the pilot in the seat. This seat is not used on actual aircraft, but rather in [[flight simulators]], especially those without a [[motion platform]], like simulators of jet fighters and helicopters.

Soon afterwards she moved to Pittsburgh, where she lived the rest of her life. In 1911, she was instrumental in obtaining the release of Fred Merrick, editor of ''Justice'' magazine, who had been jailed for libel after exposing brutal treatment of prisoners in the [[Allegheny Commons (Pittsburgh)#Western Penitentiary|Western Penitentiary]] in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="pw"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Progressive Woman |title=Members W.

In 1915, addressing the crowd at a suffrage rally in Pittsburgh, she argued for women's suffrage as a means of achieving [[equal pay]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So long as women have no voice in government, so long will they be underpaid ... Why should the woman who earns a living for herself and her family be differentiated from the male wage earner? She pays the same rent, she pays the same price for food, for fuel, for clothing. Why should she not be allowed the privilege accorded to men to have a voice in legislative affairs that she can better her condition?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Gazette Times |location=Pittsburgh |title=First Gun Fired in Suffrage Campaign: Automobile Parade and Addresses by Well Known People Start Local Fight |date=May 2, 1915 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8520742/pittsburgh_postgazette/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She later joined the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic party]] and became the state Democratic vice-chairman. In her obituary she is remembered as a "pioneer leader in the Democratic Party in Pittsburgh and the State." She was assistant director of the [[State Museum of Pennsylvania]] during Governor [[George H. Earle]]'s administration in the late 1930s.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; In 1940, she was living in Pittsburgh and still giving political speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Gazette and Daily |title=News of the Past: 15 Years Ago |date=October 10, 1955 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8525230/the_gazette_and_daily/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

Breslau married several times: to a Mr. Davies in 1900, to Mr. Hunt in 1901, to Mr. Paul Deininger—a former Roman Catholic priest—in 1910, and sometime later to a Mr. Fuller.&lt;ref name="queen" /&gt; She died of a stroke in the Leech Farm Hospital in Pittsburgh on November 20, 1952.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

==Background==

The organization was founded by a group of former [[Peace Corps]] volunteers who served in Micronesia, and it received IRS [[nonprofit]] status in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;"Habele Outer Island Education Fund 2006 Annual Report" accessed April 25, 2007.[http://www.habele.org/documents/Habele2006AnnualReport.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The charity has no salaried employees, relying on volunteers, donors and educators in the US and across Micronesia.&lt;ref&gt;"Habele group award $5K scholarships to islanders" Pacific Daily News, September 7, 2008.[http://www.guampdn.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080908/NEWS01/809080316/1002]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Habele's initial geographic focus was the so-called "Outer Islands" of [[Ulithi]], [[Woleai]], and [[Satawal]], [[Eauripik]], [[Ifalik]], and [[Lamotrek]] in [[Yap State]] as well as lagoon and outer islands in neighboring  [[Chuuk State|Chuuk]] state.&lt;ref&gt;"CHUUK, YAP ISLANDERS AWARDED SCHOLARSHIPS" East West Center, September 3, 2008.[http://pidp.eastwestcenter.org/pireport/2008/September/09-03-rl2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2013, the nonprofit expanded to serve Micronesian students of all backgrounds throughout the entire [[Federated States of Micronesia]] (FSM).&lt;ref&gt;"Scholarships Awarded to Micronesian Students," Marianas Variety, July 19, 2012.[http://www.mvariety.com/regional-news/palaupacific-news/48088-scholarships-awarded-to-micronesian-students.php]&lt;/ref&gt; and into neighboring [[Palau]] and the [[Marshall Islands]]. In contrast to bilateral aid provided by the US Government to Micronesia's public sector through the [[Compact of Free Association]] , Habele targets support for local schools and civil society, emphasizing competition, incentives, and ownership in order to "change attitudes and expectations" among community members." &lt;ref&gt;"Habele Outer Island Education Fund provides scholarships for FSM "outer islanders"" The Kaselehlie Press, September 10, 2013. [http://archive-fm.com/fm/w/www.fm/2013-12-21_3385459_22/Grant_donated_to_promotion_of_alternative_fishing_method_in_Chuuk_State_by_Government_of_Japan/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tuition scholarships==
The fund awards scholarships to students attending primary and secondary private schools and provides material donations to small public schools. In the first year of operation $2,890 in scholarships were awarded. Scholarships for 2007-08 exceeded $3,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Habele Fund Awards FSM Scholarships |work=Pacific Magazine Online |date=August 4, 2007 |url=http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2007/08/04/habele-fund-awards-fsm-scholarships |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008071537/http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2007/08/04/habele-fund-awards-fsm-scholarships |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The issuance of scholarships in 2008-09, exceeding $5,000, was described by the Peace Corps Micronesia Country Director as "particularly important" for expanding education opportunities because students living outside Micronesia's four state capitals have very limited access to formal education options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Six Outer Islanders Receive Scholarships From U.S. Fund |journal=Pacific Magazine Online |date=September 7, 2008 |url=http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2008/09/03/six-outer-islanders-receive-scholarships-from-us-fund}}{{dead link|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 21 scholarships were issued for the 2010-11 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Habele awards 21 scholarships to Micronesian students |work=PR Newswire |date=August 3, 2010 |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/habele-awards-21-scholarships-to-micronesian-students-99858859.html |access-date=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Carolina State Senators [[Glenn McConnell]] and [[Robert Ford (politician)|Robert Ford]] of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]] drew attention to Habele, when the charity announced $7,500 in scholarships for sixteen elementary and high school students in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Senators McConnell and Ford Praise Micronesian Scholarships |work=Lowcountry Today |date=August 10, 2009 |url=http://lowcountrybizsc.whosonthemove.com/senators-mcconnell-and-ford-praise-micronesian-scholarships/ |access-date=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis J. Rama, a senior consul at the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] Consulate on [[Guam]], called for the expansion of this and other programs supporting low-income students through tuition assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scholarships awarded to 16 students in FSM |newspaper=Pacific Daily News |date=August 7, 2009 |url=http://www.guampdn.com/article/20090807/NEWS01/908070314/1002 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The donor-financed tuition payments awarded by Habele are a form of [[private voucher]]s. Unlike public [[school voucher]]s, private vouchers are not funded by the government. The use of private vouchers for low-income students has been described as a tool for facilitating [[education reform]] without becoming immersed in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Moe |editor1-first=Terry M. |title=Private Vouchers |date=1995 |publisher=Hoover Institution Press |location=Stanford, CA |isbn=978-0817993726 |pages=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Early in 2010, Habele announced plans to develop and distribute native language materials for educators and students in the outer islands of Yap State, Micronesia. The initial project was a [[Ulithian]] to English dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Former Micronesia Peace Corps Group Funds Scholarships |publisher=Pacific Islands Development Program/East-West Center |date=January 28, 2010 |url=http://pidp.eastwestcenter.org/pireport/2010/January/01-28-22.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first rigorous documentation of the [[Ulithian]] language and copies were provided to educators and students throughout [[Ulithi]] and [[Fais Island|Fais]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charity Publishes Dictionary For Remote Micronesian Islanders |publisher=College of Micronesia-FSM |date=May 10, 2010 |url=http://www.comfsm.fm/news/releases/habele4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors' stated aim was to create a consistent and intuitive pattern of Roman alphabet spelling useful for native Ulithian and native English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ulithi Dictionary to Help FSM Students Learn English |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Company |date=May 15, 2010 |url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/pacbeat/stories/201005/s2899190.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Libraries and literacy==

Donations to schools generally consist of books, school supplies, and classroom instructional materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pacific Islands Networking |publisher=Pacific Initiative, University of Hawaii |access-date=April 25, 2007 |url=http://www2.ctahr.hawaii.edu/adap2/Pacific_Initiative/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habele has played a major role in the creation of libraries on the isolated atolls of Ulithi and Eauripik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=77350&amp;cat=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717083345/http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=77350&amp;cat=1 |newspaper=Saipan Tribune |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 26, 2015 |title=School books, supplies donated to remote Pacific Island}}&lt;/ref&gt; English language dictionaries have also been provided to students, including a 1,000 dictionary donation in the Fall of 2012 intended to equip every middle school student throughout [[Yap State]] with a personal dictionary for home and classroom use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Habele Outer Island Education Fund Donates 1,000 English Dictionaries to Yap |publisher=ABC 7 Guam |date=August 8, 2012 |url=http://www.pacificnewscenter.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=26168:habele-outer-island-education-fund-donates-1000-english-dictionaries-to-yap&amp;catid=45:guam-news&amp;Itemid=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extracurricular==
Habele also supports programs that engage students outside the traditional classroom. These include financial and material support for the creation of traditional dugout canoes by high school aged boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Traditional canoes sail forward in Micronesia |newspaper=Saipan Tribune |date=March 15, 2012 |url=http://www.saipantribune.com/index.php/traditional-canoes-sail-forward-in-micronesia/ |access-date=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as creation of after school clubs for robotics competitions between high schools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Corcoran |first1=Michael P. |title=Grassroots Robotics |work=Robot Magazine |date=May–June 2012 |issue=34 |pages=70–72 |url=http://www.ychs.net/documents/robot%20article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, Oceania's first ever [[Vex Robotics Design System|Vex Robot]] competition was held in the State of Yap. Teams representing [[Yap Catholic High School]] and the [[Yap Seventh-Day Adventist School]] completed a public competition and demonstrated using robotics kits donated by Habele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Yap Robo Day' features robotics competition in Micronesia |newspaper=Saipan Tribune |date=May 16, 2012 |url=http://www.saipantribune.com/index.php/yap-robo-day-features-robotics-competition-in-micronesia/ |access-date=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2017, the league had grown to the point where a team from Yap represented all of Micronesia at the [[FIRST Global]] international robotics competition in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WEBBER: HELP YAP GO TO ROBOTICS COMPETITION |publisher=First Global via Guam Pacific Daily News |date=April 19, 2017 |url=http://first.global/in-the-news/webber-help-yap-go-to-robotics-competition/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics''' ('''IOAA''') is an annual [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]] competition for [[high school]] students. It is one of the [[international science olympiad]]s.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ioaastrophysics.org/about-ioaa/|title=About IOAA|website=www.ioaastrophysics.org|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Olympiad was founded from a dissidence inside the [[International Astronomy Olympiad]], in order to increase the scope of the organization.

The first IOAA was held in [[Chiang Mai]], Thailand, in November/December 2007. The subsequent annual meetings were held in Indonesia (2008), Iran (2009), China (2010), Poland (2011), Brazil (2012), Greece (2013), Romania (2014), Indonesia (2015), India (2016), and in Phuket, Thailand (2017).&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ioaastrophysics.org/history-2/|title=History|website=www.ioaastrophysics.org|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upcoming 12th IOAA will be held in Beijing, China.&lt;ref name="future"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ioaastrophysics.org/list-of-future-events/|title=List of Future Events|website=www.ioaastrophysics.org|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Joseph Walsh''' (born December 27, 1961), is an [[Americans|American]] [[conservative talk radio]] host and former congressman. He served one term in the [[United States House of Representatives]] for Illinois' {{ushr|IL|8| 8th congressional district}}.&lt;ref name="congress bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="will back"/&gt;&lt;ref name="loss"/&gt; He served from January 2011 through January 2013, after defeating three-term [[incumbent]] [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] Representative [[Melissa Bean]] by a margin of 291 votes in a surprising upset.&lt;ref name="moran"/&gt; He is a member of the [[Republican Party (US)|Republican Party]]. While he received little Republican Party support in his bid against Bean, he was popular with the [[Tea Party movement]].&lt;ref name="breaking down"/&gt;&lt;ref name="say anything"/&gt; Walsh ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1996 and for the [[Illinois General Assembly]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="1996 results"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1998 general"/&gt; In the 1990s, he called himself a [[Rockefeller Republican|moderate Republican]], but he is now a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and a [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] [[activist]].&lt;ref name="tough target"/&gt;&lt;ref name="surprise"/&gt;

During his first months in Congress, Walsh emerged as a sharp critic of the [[Obama Administration]], accusing the president of abandoning the U.S.–Israel alliance&lt;ref name="not Israel's friend"/&gt; and bankrupting the country.&lt;ref name="pallasch"/&gt; He also challenged President [[Barack Obama]] to secure the borders with "moats and alligators" if necessary.&lt;ref name="say anything"/&gt; Walsh maintained a no-compromise approach to legislating that included rejecting any tax increases.&lt;ref name="pallasch"/&gt; He consistently voted against raising the [[federal debt ceiling]] and authored a [[balanced budget amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="hammer"/&gt;

Walsh's district was redrawn for 2012 by the Democratic-controlled [[Illinois General Assembly]].&lt;ref name="sweet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="incumbents sue"/&gt; While he initially planned to run in his newly drawn 14th district against fellow Republican Representative [[Randy Hultgren]], he eventually decided to run in the remapped 8th district against Democratic candidate [[Tammy Duckworth]]. Walsh was defeated by Duckworth in the general election on November 6, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duckworth defeats Walsh in congressional contest|author1=Garcia, M. |author2=Eldeib, D. |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/clout/chi-duckworth-walsh-election-results-illinois-8th-district-20121106,0,7043160,full.story|newspaper=''[[Chicago Tribune]]''|date=November 7, 2012|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walsh is now a conservative radio show host.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Jaime (September 2, 2014). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/09/02/where-are-they-now-the-congressional-edition/ "Where Are They Now? — The Congressional Edition"]. ''[[The Washington Post]]''. Retrieved November 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Walsh was born and raised in the Chicago suburb of [[North Barrington, Illinois|North Barrington]], the fifth of nine children.&lt;ref name="money woes"/&gt; He graduated from [[Barrington High School (Lake County, Illinois)|Barrington High School]] in 1980, where he was the president and active in sports.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune1"/&gt; He attended [[Grinnell College]] then earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in English from the [[University of Iowa]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="congress bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="money woes"/&gt; In the mid-1980s, he embarked on an acting career, taking lessons in stage, theater and television at The [[Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute]] in [[New York, New York|New York]] and [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="say anything"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chicagotribune1"/&gt; He completed a [[Master of Public Policy]] at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Harris School of Public Policy Studies]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="congress bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vote smart"/&gt;

==Early career==
As a social worker,&lt;ref name="tough target"/&gt;&lt;ref name="richest and poorest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="longshot"/&gt; Walsh worked with the [[Jobs for Youth/Chicago|Jobs for Youth]] program in the inner-city Chicago area, teaching high school dropouts basic academic and job skills. He later taught American government and American history at [[Oakton Community College]] and the [[Hebrew Theological College]].&lt;ref name="house.gov bio"/&gt;

==Fundraising and advocacy career==
Walsh's congressional website indicates he has advocated for "market-based solutions to education reform and urban poverty". He ran the Daniel Murphy Scholarship Fund, a Chicago-based, privately funded program which grants scholarships to low-income students to attend private high schools. He raised funds for two organizations advocating [[school choice]]: the American Education Reform Council, and the [[The Foundation for Educational Choice|Milton and Rose Friedman Foundation]].&lt;ref name="house.gov bio"/&gt; In addition, Walsh raised nearly $1 million over a five-year period for the Fabretto Children's Foundation, an international charity which uses education and micro-enterprise to alleviate poverty among [[Nicaragua]]n children.&lt;ref name="wfc"/&gt;

Walsh also worked on state and local government policy issues for [[The Heartland Institute]], a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] free-market [[think tank]] based in Chicago. He helped launch conservative organizations that seek to limit government and elect fiscal conservatives to state legislatures such as the Legislative Education Action Drive and the [[Americans for Limited Government]]. He also did consulting work with the United Republican Fund, an Illinois [[political action committee]] helping to elect Republican state legislators.&lt;ref name="house.gov bio"/&gt;

He has also raised [[venture capital]] for a living, according to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'',&lt;ref name="cbn"/&gt; with his campaign website indicating that he worked for Ravenswood Advisors, a Chicago [[boutique]] [[investment banking]] group which raised early-stage [[investment capital]] for new and small businesses.&lt;ref name="house.gov bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wfc"/&gt; However, he never made much money&lt;ref name="say anything"/&gt; and has pointed to salaries of $30,000 to $40,000 a year in the past.&lt;ref name="money woes"/&gt; In 2010, he had a negative net worth of $317,498 according to the [[Center for Responsive Politics]].&lt;ref name="poorest member"/&gt;

==Early political campaigns==
===1996===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections, 1996#Illinois}}
Walsh won the Republican nomination for [[Illinois' 9th congressional district]] and faced longtime [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic]] [[Liberalism|liberal]] incumbent [[Sidney R. Yates]], who was 87 years old, in the general election.&lt;ref name="1996 results"/&gt; Walsh campaigned by riding his bicycle through the district. He engaged in self-admitted "outrageous" stunts during the campaign which included paying the doorman at Yates' Chicago apartment building $1,000 for being the first person to spot Yates in his district, and throwing a birthday party for Yates that included a cake decorated with 87 candles.&lt;ref name="tough target"/&gt;&lt;ref name="in search"/&gt; Walsh denied he was trying to play the "age card". Yates responded that his own age was not a factor, and that Walsh was too young and inexperienced for the job. Yates also commented that the district was too liberal for Walsh, and tried to tie Walsh to the conservative Speaker of the House, [[Newt Gingrich]]. In response, Walsh distanced himself from Gingrich and said he considered himself a "moderate Republican";&lt;ref name="tough target"/&gt; he also ran as a [[pro-choice]] candidate in the liberal-leaning district.&lt;ref name="tribune endorses"/&gt; Yates defeated Walsh 63%–37%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=1891 |title=IL District 9 Race - Nov 05, 1996 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |date= |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1998===
In 1998, Walsh challenged incumbent Democratic [[Jeffrey Schoenberg]] for the 58th district seat in the [[Illinois House of Representatives]], which represents the Chicago North Shore suburbs of [[Wilmette, Illinois|Wilmette]] and [[Evanston, Illinois]]. Walsh again ran as [[pro-choice]] on abortion.&lt;ref name="tribune endorses"/&gt; He drove a yellow school bus throughout the district during his campaign to focus attention on the issue of public school funding.&lt;ref name="uses bus"/&gt; He criticized Schoenberg for voting in favor of Republican Governor [[Jim Edgar]]'s school-funding reform bill that would have increased state income taxes but given property tax relief to North Shore homeowners.&lt;ref name="uses bus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="school funds"/&gt; Walsh lost to Schoenberg, 62%–38%.&lt;ref name="1998 general"/&gt;

==U.S. House of Representatives (2011–2013)==
===Elections===
====2010====
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois, 2010#District 8}}
On September 28, 2009, Walsh launched an [[exploratory committee]] to run for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in the {{ushr|Illinois|8|}}. The district included parts of the northwest [[Chicago]] suburbs, such as  [[Arlington Heights, Illinois|Arlington Heights]], [[Schaumburg, Illinois|Schaumburg]], [[Gurnee, Illinois|Gurnee]], [[Palatine, Illinois|Palatine]], [[Mundelein, Illinois|Mundelein]], [[Zion, Illinois|Zion]], [[Barrington, Illinois|Barrington]], [[Woodstock, Illinois|Woodstock]] and Walsh's home in [[McHenry, Illinois|McHenry]]. It had long been reckoned as the most Republican district in the Chicago area, and by some measures in all of Illinois. However, in 2004, Democrat [[Melissa Bean]] had ousted 26-year Republican incumbent [[Phil Crane]] in a substantial upset, ending seventy years of Republican control.

In February 2010, Walsh won the Republican primary election, taking about 34 percent of the vote in a six-person field and moving into the district from [[Winnetka, Illinois|Winnetka]] in April.&lt;ref name="tribune endorses"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2010 primary"/&gt; The Republican establishment refused to put much stock into the district with [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] member Tom Erickson, saying, "In the primary, we had really liked Dirk Beveridge or Maria Rodriguez. Those are the two candidates who we thought really had the potential to make this a very competitive race." Walsh's campaign responded that that GOP establishment was "a bit tone deaf when it comes to independent, conservative reform candidates".&lt;ref name="GOP not"/&gt;

Walsh then advanced to face Bean in the general election. In 2006, Bean had been re-elected with 51 percent and in 2008 with 60 percent of the vote. Bean was endorsed by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'',&lt;ref name="tribune endorses"/&gt; the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'',&lt;ref name="sun times list"/&gt; ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|The Daily Herald]]'',&lt;ref name="daily herald"/&gt; and the ''[[Lake County News-Sun]]''.&lt;ref name="lake county"/&gt;

Walsh criticized Bean for her 2010 votes in favor of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]&lt;ref name="cbn"/&gt; and against the [[Stupak–Pitts Amendment]] that would have prohibited the use of federal funds to cover any part of the cost of any health plan that included coverage of abortion.&lt;ref name="condemns bean"/&gt; He described himself as a [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] conservative activist&lt;ref name="walshforcongress1"/&gt; and obtained endorsements from two Tea Party organizations, conservative radio talk show host [[Tom Roeser]], and many others.&lt;ref name="endorsements"/&gt;

The national Democratic and Republican parties did not compete or spend any money in the district, and the state GOP did not help Walsh.&lt;ref name="breaking down"/&gt; As a result, during the 2010 election cycle, Walsh's campaign raised only one-quarter as much as Bean's.&lt;ref name="say anything"/&gt; He spent about $603,000 and ended the campaign about $362,000 in debt according to campaign finance reports,&lt;ref name="vote smart campaign finances"/&gt; (with much of the debt due to post election ballot counting of the close race).&lt;ref name="surprise"/&gt; As late as October, ''[[The New York Times]]'' forecast that Bean had an 88 percent chance at winning re-election. Even [[CQ Politics]] had the election as "Safe Democratic". Despite the lack of funding and his long-shot status, Walsh narrowly defeated Bean by a margin of 0.1% or 291 votes. The race was not called until two weeks after Election Day when [[provisional ballot]]s were counted. It appeared that the presence of [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] candidate Bill Scheurer was a factor in the race; he tallied 6,400 votes, far more than Walsh's margin of victory.&lt;ref name="moran"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=489032 |title=IL - District 08 Race - Nov 02, 2010 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |date= |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012====
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois, 2012#District 8}}
During the 2011 redrawing of Illinois' election districts by the Democratic-controlled state legislature, Walsh's home, along with most of the [[McHenry County, Illinois|McHenry County]] portion of his old district, was drawn into the 14th district, represented by fellow Republican [[Randy Hultgren]]. The 8th was reconfigured to favor a Democratic candidate. Walsh and nine other Republican Illinois Representatives filed a lawsuit alleging that the new borders discriminated against Republican and Latino voters.&lt;ref name="sweet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="incumbents sue"/&gt; On September 21, Walsh announced that if the new district lines were upheld in federal court, he would run for election in the now-heavily Republican 14th District against Hultgren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.suntimes.com/7786144-417/us-rep-joe-walsh-to-run-in-14th-district-would-face-hultgren-in-primary.html |work=Chicago Sun-Times |accessdate=April 5, 2012 |title=U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh to run in 14th District; would face Hultgren in primary |author=Abdon M. Pallasch |date=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late July 2011, Walsh was endorsed by the [[Club for Growth]] to run against Hultgren.&lt;ref name="will back"/&gt;&lt;ref name="club"/&gt; However, after several ethics issues regarding Walsh emerged, (such as charges of failing to pay child support, and driving on a suspended license), the Club for Growth distanced itself from Walsh, stating that it would wait until more facts were known before making a decision.&lt;ref name="backs away"/&gt; In November 2011, Walsh was cited by the [[Family Research Council]] Action committee for his "unwavering support of the family".&lt;ref name="FRC True Blue"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pallasch|first=Abdon M.|title=Rep.

In December 2011, Walsh decided to run in the redrawn 8th district,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2011/12/walsh_duckworth_krishnamoorthi.html |work=Chicago Sun-Times |title=Walsh, Duckworth, Krishnamoorthi, Hultgren statements UPDATE |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122072413/http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2011/12/walsh_duckworth_krishnamoorthi.html |archivedate=January 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he would likely face Democratic [[Tammy Duckworth]], a former assistant secretary of the VA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.onepennysheet.com/2012/01/joe-walsh-trailing-democrats-in-illinois-8th-district-poll-duckworth-leading-krishnamoorthi/|title=Joe Walsh Trailing Democrats In Illinois 8th District Poll: Duckworth Leading Krishnamoorthi|date=Jan 26, 2012|work=One Penny Sheet}}&lt;/ref&gt; in what seemed to pose a tough race for Walsh.&lt;ref name="emanuel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/politics&amp;id=8554043|title=Emanuel endorses Duckworth in 8th District race|date=February 22, 2012|author=Ravi Baichwal |work=WLS-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skip convention"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/19/joe-walsh-tea-party-rep-s_n_1686687.html |title=Joe Walsh, Tea Party Rep, Says He'll Skip GOP Convention |date=July 19, 2012 |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=February 17, 2014 |first=Joseph |last=Erbentraut}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, the conservative political advocacy group [[Americans For Prosperity]] gave Walsh a 100 percent rating.&lt;ref name="perfect"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/Walsh-Receives-Perfect-Score-from-Americans-For-Prosperity-137110788.html |title=Walsh Receives Perfect Score from Americans for Prosperity|author=Edward McClelland |work=nbcchicago.com|date=January 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ensuing campaign between Walsh and Duckworth emerged as a bitter race. At a July 2012 campaign event, Walsh accused his opponent of politicizing both her military service as a helicopter pilot and her Iraq War injuries which cost her both legs and the partial use of one arm.

===Tenure===
[[File:Rep. Joe Walsh speaking. (5589202989).jpg|thumb|225px|Walsh speaking at a [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] rally on March 31, 2011]]
Several days before being sworn into Congress, ''The New York Times'' criticized Walsh for his willingness to accept donations from [[political action committee]]s and lobbyists.&lt;ref name="surprise"/&gt; After being sworn in, Walsh announced that consistent with his opposition to government-provided health care and the 2010 health care reform legislation, he would not accept congressional health care benefits.&lt;ref name="health care"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forgo"/&gt;

During his early months in Congress, he emerged as a vocal critic of the [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic Party]] and President Obama's fiscal policies, and posted a [[YouTube]] video in which he accused President Obama of bankrupting the country. He also vowed, "I won't place one more dollar of debt upon the backs of my kids and grandkids unless we structurally reform the way this town [Washington, D.C.] spends money!"&lt;ref name="pallasch"/&gt; He became a frequent fixture on cable TV,&lt;ref name="say anything"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pallasch"/&gt; advocating a "no compromise" approach to deficit reduction that rejects any tax increases on the wealthy.&lt;ref name="pallasch"/&gt; He consistently voted against raising the federal debt ceiling and authored a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution.&lt;ref name="hammer" /&gt; Walsh has also said that President Obama was elected "because he pushed that magical button: a black man who was articulate, liberal, the whole white guilt, all of that."&lt;ref name="elected because black"/&gt; In his first six months in office, Walsh received over 30 appearances on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Skiba | first1=Katherine | title=Illinois' 5 Republican Freshmen Reflect on First 6 Months in Congress | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-06-15/news/ct-met-five-freshmen-in-congress-3-20110615_1_gop-freshmen-radio-address-western-illinois-district | date=June 15, 2011 | publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' | accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the election season, Walsh was asked what his approach to bipartisanship would be if elected. He replied it would "not be the time right now to extend your hand across the aisle."&lt;ref name="daily herald"/&gt;

In September 2011, Walsh was among 19 members of Congress criticized for ethics violations in the [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] annual report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yager|first=Jordy|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/news/182653-watchdog-shines-spotlight-on-lawmakers-ethics-in-annual-most-corrupt-report|title=Watchdog spotlights lawmaker ethics in 'most corrupt' report|work=The Hill|date=September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Walsh was videotaped meeting with his constituents, becoming visibly aggressive and swearing at a woman who questioned him about his comment that the marketplace and the banks were not responsible "for the mess we're in right now." He later apologized for being "too passionate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57321815-503544/joe-walsh-i-got-a-bit-too-passionate-with-my-constituent/ |publisher=[[CBS News]] |title=Joe Walsh: I got "a bit too passionate" with my constituent|date=November 9, 2011|author=Brian Montopoli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Congress, Walsh held 363 [[town hall meeting]]s, more than any other member of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.heartland.org/2014/08/illinois-forum-celebrates-25-years-banding-together-freedom-lovers/ Illinois Forum Celebrates 25 Years Banding Together Freedom Lovers] ''[[The Heartland Institute]]'', August 29, 2014.

===Controversial statements===
On June 19, 2014, Walsh was removed from his radio show for using racially charged language. He was on air again the next day. WIND general manager Jeff Reisman commented: "During the segment Joe intended to cite several common racial slurs as examples. He did not in any way use them in a defamatory or derogatory manner, simply as examples. However, AM 560 The Answer did not allow them to go on the air. AM 560 The Answer has a policy of not using certain words on the air that are highly inflammatory and offensive even in the context of a discussion of why those words are offensive. We will continue that policy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140619/news/140618146/ Walsh Will Be Back On the Air Tonight] ''Daily Herald'', June 20, 2014.

==Political positions==
[[File:Joe Walsh (5452909326).jpg|thumb|225px|Walsh speaking at [[Conservative Political Action Conference|CPAC]] in 2011]]
In his failed 1996 congressional bid, Walsh was more socially liberal, favoring [[abortion rights]] and [[gun control]].&lt;ref name="chicagotribune1"/&gt;

Walsh holds conservative views. On taxes, he said he favors extending the [[Bush tax cuts]], abolishing the [[Estate tax in the United States|estate tax]], and cutting both the [[capital gains tax|capital gains]] and corporate tax rates. He blamed joblessness on a reluctance by small businesses to hire and traced that reluctance to an uncertainty on tax policy.&lt;ref name="cbn"/&gt; In November 2011, Walsh described the [[Occupy movement]] as composed of "generally spoiled, pampered, unfocused, clueless young people and a smattering of other people who don't understand this country and are advocating anti-American solutions." When a constituent pointed out that veterans have also taken part in the [[Occupy movement]], Walsh responded, "I don't know how many veterans are part of the Occupy protest. I can't imagine it's many. But anyone who would advocate [[socialism|socialist]] solutions to certain problems in this country ... they don't understand this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/20/joe-walsh-veterans-in-occ_n_1104421.html|title=Joe Walsh: Veterans In Occupy Movement 'Don't Understand This Country' (VIDEO)|last=Sabella|first=Jen|date=2011-11-21|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On entitlement reform, he suggested cuts would have to be made. "The first thing we need to do is acknowledge that everybody is going to have to give on [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] reform and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] reform," he said. Walsh opposes the extension of unemployment benefits. He said the benefits have already been extended for too long and that attention should be paid to the cost.&lt;ref name="cbn"/&gt; Following President Obama's [[State of the Union address]], Walsh remarked that he did not believe there should be a [[social safety net]] because it is not in the Constitution.&lt;ref name="say anything"/&gt;

Walsh also tends rightward on social issues. On [[global warming]], he said the science behind it was "not definitive" and that U.S. economic interests should come first in any discussion of climate agreements.&lt;ref name="cbn"/&gt; Walsh also criticized President Obama's immigration policies, saying the president had made only token efforts toward securing the borders. In May 2011, while holding a toy [[alligator]] in his hand, Walsh announced on the House floor that he would support tough border legislation even if it involved building moats and filling them with alligators.&lt;ref name="gator"/&gt;

On abortion, he said to reporters in October 2012 that abortion is never medically necessary to save the life of the mother, saying that "with modern technology and science, you can't find one instance" of a medically necessary abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robillard|first1=Kevin|work=Politico|title=Walsh: Abortion Never Saves Mother|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2012/10/walsh-abortion-never-saves-mother-082620|date=October 19, 2012|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]], a professional association representing over 90% of board-certified obstetrician-gynecologists, said in a statement that "contrary to the inaccurate statements made yesterday by Rep. Joe Walsh (R-IL), abortions are necessary in a number of circumstances to save the life of a woman or to preserve her health."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Parnass|first=Sarah|title=Rep.

Walsh holds strongly pro-[[Israel]] views. In a May 2012 op-ed for the ''[[Washington Times]]'', Walsh opposed the [[two-state solution]], saying it has "failed" and was "insanity"; he advocated for Israeli annexation of the [[Palestinian territories]], arguing that the Palestinians living there could be given "limited voting power" within the Jewish state and encouraging them to move to [[Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Joe |last=Walsh|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/may/3/myth-of-a-two-state-solution/ |title=Myth of a two-state solution|work=Washington Times|date=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to accusations that Walsh advocated [[apartheid]] and the "soft" [[ethnic cleansing]] of Palestinians from their ancestral home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert |last=Wright|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/05/congressman-endorses-apartheid-ethnic-cleansing-for-palestinians/256775/ |title=Congressman Endorses Apartheid, Ethnic Cleansing for Palestinians|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a column in ''[[The Daily Caller]]'' stating that President Obama is "not Israel's friend" and should not have criticized Israel for continuing to build settlements in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]].&lt;ref name="say anything"/&gt;&lt;ref name="not Israel's friend"/&gt; Walsh also argued that most American Jews are liberal and therefore, side with the Palestinians and vague ideas of peace, instead of with Israel. He stated that in order to achieve peace in the [[Middle East]], the U.S. must publicly choose Israel's side, so that Palestinians will "face the combined wrath of Israel and the United States".&lt;ref name="not Israel's friend"/&gt;

In November 2011, Walsh, along with fellow Tea Partier [[Ron Paul]], met leader of the [[National Front (France)|French National Front]] and anti-[[Islamist]] activist [[Marine Le Pen]] during her visit to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/2011/11/04/frances-marine-le-pens-tea-party-embrace-a-percolating-issue-on-the-us-right/ |title=France's Marine Le Pen's Tea Party Embrace a Percolating Issue on the U.S. Right |publisher=Humanevents.com |date= |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Associated |first=The |url=http://www.nwherald.com/2011/11/02/french-far-right-candidate-visits-with-walsh/ang8yxw/ |title=French far-right candidate visits with Walsh &amp;#124; Northwest Herald |publisher=Nwherald.com |date=September 5, 2014 |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh campaigned to get [[Narendra Modi]], then the [[Chief Minister of Gujarat|chief minister]] of the Indian state of [[Gujarat]], a diplomatic visa to the United States, which had previously been denied to him due to allegations of violations of religious freedom against Muslims during the [[2002 Gujarat riots]]. Walsh said that Modi had "quite a successful track record" of fiscal responsibility, described him as "kind of like a Tea Party free market guy in [[India]], which I found very appealing" and noted that he "has been recognized across the world for establishing Gujarat as the most business-friendly state in India and is widely believed to be a serious contender for the 2014 election for Indian Prime Minister."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20120603/news/706039869/print/ |title=Walsh steps into political minefield with suburban Indian community |publisher=DailyHerald.com |date= |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/world/congressman-walsh-wont-smile-till-modi-is-invited-to-us-333443.html |title=Congressman Walsh 'won't smile' till Modi is invited to US |publisher=Firstpost.com |date=June 6, 2012 |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modi subsequently won the [[Indian general election, 2014|2014 general election]], becoming [[Prime Minister of India]].

==Personal life==
Walsh has been married twice, and has three children and two stepchildren.&lt;ref name="wfc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skiba, Katherine (December 2, 2014) – [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-obama-girls-criticism-talk-20141201-story.html "Walsh Says Ex-Aide 'Should Have Kept Her Mouth Quiet' About Obamas"]. ''Chicago Tribune''. Retrieved December 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; His second marriage was with [[Helene Walsh]], who became a state representative.

Following Walsh's victory in the 2010 Republican primary, it was reported that a bank had foreclosed on his condo and he had been evicted in October 2009, but that he and his family were living in a rented house in the Chicago North Shore suburb of Winnetka at the time. A GOP spokesman said that voters would likely identify with Walsh's financial troubles. He was also reportedly facing a lawsuit by a former campaign manager who claimed Walsh owed him $20,000 for services&lt;ref name="what's next"/&gt; and had federal and state tax liens in the 1980s and 1990s (all paid by 2001). Walsh explained that the major portion of the past due taxes were on a college trust fund he received from his grandfather and that neither he nor his family had been aware that the funds were taxable. He also explained that his more recent financial struggles have made him more attuned to the difficulties faced by the average constituent.&lt;ref name="money woes"/&gt;

In July 2011, the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' reported that Walsh's ex-wife, Laura, was suing him for $117,437 for past due child support dating from 2005 for their three children.&lt;ref name="pallasch"/&gt; Walsh allegedly had told his ex-wife that he did not have the money because he was out of work; she had later seen from his campaign disclosures that he had been employed.&lt;ref name="pallasch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sued"/&gt; Walsh's attorney said that Walsh did not owe "anywhere near that amount," and that he had had no more problems paying child support than "any other average guy".&lt;ref name="sued"/&gt; Walsh and his ex-wife began working out a settlement of the disputed past due amount in late July 2011.&lt;ref name="pallasch"/&gt; Walsh's financial problems inspired the proposal of a bill which would forbid people owing more than $10,000 in back child support from running for office in Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwherald.com/2011/12/20/bill-seeks-to-ban-deadbeat-parents-from-ballots/at23vf5/|title=Bill seeks to ban 'deadbeat' parents from ballots|author=Kevin Craver|date=December 20, 2012|work=The Northwest Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, 2012, a settlement was reached, and the case dismissed. As part of the settlement, Walsh issued a statement on behalf of himself and his ex-wife which read, in part, "Having resolved these issues together and cleared up these mistakes in private, we now agree that Joe is not and was not a 'deadbeat dad' and does not owe child support."&lt;ref name="pearson"/&gt;

In August 2011, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reported that Walsh lost his driving privileges from mid-April to mid-July 2011 because he let his insurance lapse. In response, Walsh criticized the ''Tribune'' for "wast[ing] time and ink scrutinizing [his] driving record over the last 22 years rather than Washington's unsustainable spending".&lt;ref name="chicagotribune1"/&gt;

On February 1, 2013, Walsh filed a motion to terminate child support obligations, claiming that as he was now unemployed he was unable to contribute to the support of his children.&lt;ref&gt;Bobic, Igor (February 11, 2013) – [http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/ex-rep-joe-walsh-i-cant-afford-child?ref=fpblg "Ex-Rep.

'''Leadership development''' expands the capacity of individuals to perform in [[leadership]] roles within organizations. Leadership roles are those that facilitate execution of a company’s [[business strategy|strategy]] through building alignment, winning [[mindshare]] and growing the capabilities of others. Leadership roles may be formal, with the corresponding authority to make decisions and take responsibility, or they may be informal roles with little official authority (e.g., a member of a [[team]] who influences team engagement, purpose and direction; a lateral peer who must listen and negotiate through influence).&lt;ref&gt;''How to Attack the Business Skills Mismatch'', [http://www.clomedia.com Chief Learning Officer Magazine], by Rommin Adl (August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Leadership development is thought to be key to business success.  A study by the [[Center for Creative Leadership]] holds that 65 percent of companies with mature leadership development programs drove improved business results as compared to 6 percent of companies without such a program.  Similarly, 86% of companies with leadership development programs responded rapidly to changing market conditions whereas only 52% of companies with immature programs were able to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''Leadership development: is it worth the money?'', [http://www.ccl.org Center for Creative Leadership], by Jennifer Martineau, Emily Hoole, and Tracy Patterson&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developing individual leaders ==

Traditionally, leadership development has focused on developing the leadership abilities and attitudes of individuals.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Different personal trait and characteristics can help or hinder a person's leadership effectiveness&lt;ref&gt;''The Leadership Development Handbook'', [http://www.ccl.org Center for Creative Leadership] and Organizational Behavior, 4th ed, by Stephen Robbins, Bruce Millet &amp; Terry Waters-Marsh, published by Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt; and require formalized programs for developing leadership competencies.

Classroom-style training and associated reading for leadership development may ail from the possible divergence between knowing what to do and doing what one knows; [[management]] expert [[Henry Mintzberg]] is one person to highlight this dilemma. It is estimated{{by whom|date=September 2014}} that as little as 15% of learning from traditional classroom-style training results in sustained [[behavior change (individual)|behavioral change]] within workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal | author = Cromwell S., Kolb J. | year = 2004 | title = An examination of work-environment support factors affecting transfer of supervisory skills training to the work place | url = | journal = Human Resource Development Quarterly | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 449–71 | doi=10.1002/hrdq.1115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of leadership development efforts has been linked{{by whom|date=September 2014}} to three variables:&lt;ref&gt;See Baldwin, T. &amp; Ford, K. (1988), "Transfer Of Training: A Review And Directions For Future Research', ''Personnel Psychology'', Spring, Vol. 41 Issue 1, p63-105&lt;/ref&gt;

# Individual learner characteristics
# Quality and nature of the leadership development program
# Support for behavioral change from the leader's supervisor.

Military officer-training academies, such as the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]], go to great lengths to accept only candidates who show the highest potential to lead well.&lt;ref&gt;Organizational Behavior, 4th ed, by Stephen Robbins, Bruce Millet &amp; Terry Waters-Marsh, published by Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt; Personal characteristics that are associated{{by whom|date=September 2014}} with successful leadership development include leader motivation to learn, a high achievement drive and personality traits such as openness to experience, an internal focus of control, and [[self-monitoring]]. In order to develop individual leaders, supervisors or superiors must conduct an individual assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ADRP 6-22, Army Leadership|date=August 2012|publisher=United States Army|pages=7–9|url=http://cape.army.mil/repository/doctrine/adrp6-22.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development is also more likely to occur when the design of the development program:

* Integrates a range of developmental experiences over a set period of time (e.g., 6–12 months). These experiences may include [[360 degree feedback]], experiential classroom style programs, [[business school]] style coursework, [[executive coaching]], reflective journaling, [[mentoring]] and more.
* Involves [[goal-setting]], following an assessment of key developmental needs and then an evaluation of the achievement of goals after a given time period.

Among key concepts in leadership development one may find:

* Experiential learning: Positioning the individual in the focus of the learning process, going through the four stages of experiential learning as formulated by [[David A. Kolb]]: 
*# Concrete experience. 
*# Observation and reflection. 
*# Forming abstract concepts. 
*# Testing in new situations.
* Self efficacy: The right training and coaching should bring about 'self efficacy' in the trainee, as Albert Bandura formulated: a person's belief about his capabilities to produce effects.
* Visioning: Developing the ability to formulate a clear image of the aspired future of an organization unit.
* Attitude: Attitude plays a major role in being a leader.

== Developing leadership at a collective level ==

Leadership can also be developed by strengthening the connection between, and alignment of, the efforts of individual leaders and the systems through which they influence organizational operations. This has led to a differentiation between [[leader development]] and leadership development.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Leadership development can build on the development of individuals (including followers) to become leaders. In addition, it also needs to focus on the interpersonal linkages in the team.

Following the credo of people as an organization's most valuable [[Resource-based view|resource]] , some organizations address the development of these resources (including leadership).

In contrast, the concept of "[[employeeship]]" recognizes that what it takes to be a good leader is not too dissimilar to what it takes to be a good employee. Therefore, bringing the notional leader together with the team to explore these similarities (rather than focusing on the differences) brings positive results. This approach has been particularly successful in Sweden where the power distance between manager and team is small.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== Succession planning ==

The development of "high potentials" to take over leadership when the time comes the current leadership to leave their positions is known as [[succession planning]]. This type of leadership development usually requires the extensive transfer of an individual between departments. In many [[multinational corporation|multinational]]s, it usually requires international transfer and experience to build a future leader.

Succession planning requires a sharp focus on the organization's future and [[vision statement|vision]], in order to align leadership development with the future that the organization aspires to create. Thus successive leadership development is based not only on knowledge and history but also on a dream. For such a plan to be successful, a screening of future leadership should be based not only on "what we know and have" but also on "what we aspire to become".

Persons involved in succession planning should include current leadership members who can articulate the future vision. Three critical dimensions should be considered:&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;According to Meir Jacob and Amit Cohen (1995) cannot found : https://scholar.google.de/scholar?q=Meir+Jacob+Amit+Cohen+%281995%29&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=de&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5???http://www.bhc.global/leadership-consulting/&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

# Skills and knowledge; 
# Role perception and degree of acceptance of leading role; and, 
# [[Self-efficacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Albert Bandura|author=Albert Bandura|year=1977|title=Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change|journal=Psychological Review|volume=84|pages=191–215|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.2.191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== London Challenge (2003 - 2011)===
In 2002 the British Government created a new set of policies focusing on London's state secondary schools,which were at that time performing poorly in comparison to the rest of the country. The policies were collectively known as the London Challenge and their objectives were:&lt;ref name="JRFLondonChallenge" /&gt;
* to raise standards in the poorest performing schools;
* to narrow the attainment gap between pupils in London;
* to create more good and outstanding schools.

The London Challenge depended on close cooperation with [[Local Authorities]], and in particular five '''Key Areas''' were singled out for close attention, Tower Hamlets, Newham, Lewisham, Hackney, Westminster.&lt;ref name="TBrighouseLondonCouncils"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TransformingLondonSecSchools" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JRFLondonChallenge" /&gt;

One of the distinctive features of London Challenge was a focus on partnership and shared purpose between schools, whilst avoiding stigmatising schools through the use of negative language.&lt;ref name="JRFLondonChallenge"/&gt; The term '''"Keys to Success"''' was used to identify those schools that would require the most intensive intervention.&lt;ref name="JRFLondonChallenge"/&gt;  A series of "sector led" support mechanisms were put in place.&lt;ref name="JRFLondonChallenge"/&gt; Independent, experienced education experts, known as '''London Challenge Advisers''', were appointed to each of the Keys to Success schools to provide tailored help. The advisers were supported by an administrative team in the Department for Education (DfE).&lt;ref name="OfstedLondonChallenge"/&gt; They worked closely with experienced education professionals, appointed by the DfE, known as '''National Leaders of Education (NLE)''' or '''Local Leaders of Education (LLE)''', as well as local authority appointed '''School Improvement Partners (SIP)''' and other local authority officers to develop a bespoke intervention programmes.&lt;ref name="DfEEvaluation2012"/&gt; The cost of the support and the services brokered by the adviser came directly from the DfE.&lt;ref name="OfstedLondonChallenge"/&gt;&lt;ref name=InstEd&gt;{{cite web|title=All about the Challenge|url=https://www.ioe.ac.uk/newsEvents/documents/News_and_Events_Magazines/London_InstEd_issue_4.pdf|website=Institute of Education|publisher=Institute of Education|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas school improvement services were outsourced to consultants,&lt;ref name="JRFLondonChallenge"/&gt; though from 2007 specialist services to the Keys to Success schools were supplied by a single education consultancy company under a '''Challenge Service Contract'''.&lt;ref name="DfEEvaluation2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ELChallengeServices&gt;{{cite web|title=DfE School Improvement Provider in London|url=http://www.educationlondon.org.uk/dfelondon/|website=Education London|publisher=Education London|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

School to school peer support was also a feature of the London Challenge programme. Some particularly successful schools were awarded '''Teaching School''' status, giving them the remit and opportunity to support other schools in their local community.&lt;ref name="JRFLondonChallenge" /&gt;  Another initiative was the annual '''"Families of  Schools"''' report which grouped all of London's state schools into numbered families with other similar schools.&lt;ref name=FoS2011Secondary&gt;{{cite web|title=Families of schools 2011: London secondary schools|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/families-of-schools-2011-london-secondary-schools|website=Gov.uk|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FoS2011Primary&gt;{{cite web|title=Families of schools 2011: London primary schools|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/families-of-schools-2011-london-primary-schools|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was aimed at middle and senior leaders in schools, allowing them to compare their performance with their peer schools and to share best practice on improvement initiatives, although there is no evidence that the resource was widely used for those purposes.&lt;ref name="JRFLondonChallenge" /&gt;

The London Challenge incorporated the '''14-19 Pathfinders''' initiative which aimed to define and develop improved "learning pathways" for students in this age group.&lt;ref name=1419PathfindersConsultation&gt;{{cite web|title=A vision for 14-19 in London : pan-London learner offer consultation|url=http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/5258/|website=DERA|publisher=DfES|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For schools that needed support beyond the classroom, the '''Extended School''' concept was introduced, creating hubs for services to be offered directly to students and their families.&lt;ref name="TransformingLondonSecSchools" /&gt;  The London Challenge also introduced the [[Teach First]] initiative to encourage highly academic graduates into the teaching profession.&lt;ref name="TransformingLondonSecSchools" /&gt;

In 2008 the Government announced an expansion of the London Challenge to include primary schools, and the programme was extended until 2011.&lt;ref name="JRFLondonChallenge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CityChallenge" /&gt;

=== City Challenge (2008 - 2011)===
The 2008 extension of the London Challenge initiative also expanded it to include two new geographical areas – [[Greater Manchester]] and the [[Black Country]]. The programme was renamed for those areas as the City Challenge, but continued to be known as the London Challenge in the capital.&lt;ref name="JRFLondonChallenge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CityChallenge" /&gt; The City Challenge programme was tailored to local needs, using many of the
same approaches adopted in the London Challenge.&lt;ref name="CityChallenge" /&gt;

== Evaluation ==
[[Ofsted]] first reported on the impact of the London Challenge in 2006, and found that, between 2001 and 2005, London's GCSE results had improved faster in London than in England as a whole.&lt;ref name=Ofsted2006&gt;{{cite web|title=Secretary of State sends letter of congratulation to all London Heads following successful Ofsted report|url=http://dfes.gov.uk/londonchallenge/|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070108123845/dfes.gov.uk/londonchallenge/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 January 2007|website=National Archives|publisher=DfES|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent report in 2010 corroborated those findings, finding that the "London Challenge has continued to improve outcomes for pupils in London’s primary and secondary schools at a faster rate than nationally. London’s secondary schools continue to perform better than those in the rest of England".&lt;ref name="OfstedLondonChallenge"/&gt;

A Government commissioned report from the [[Institute for Policy Studies|Institute for Policy Studies in Education]], published in 2012, evaluated the outcomes of the City Challenge programme and, retrospectively the London Challenge Programme.&lt;ref name=DfEEvaluation2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Evaluation of the city challenge programme|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evaluation-of-the-city-challenge-programme|website=Department for Education|publisher=DfE|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It found that the majority of the initial targets were achieved, and while acknowledging the backdrop of wider educational initiatives concluded that the "most plausible explanation for the greater improvement in Challenge areas is that the City Challenge programme was responsible".

A report from the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]] in 2014 concluded that "during the period of the London Challenge, secondary school performance in London saw a dramatic improvement, and local authorities in inner London went from the worst performing to the best performing nationally." However they noted the difficulty of isolating the specific effect of the London Challenge against a wider background of education policy changes.  The report's assessment of the City Challenge was more mixed "in part because [the City Challenge areas] had less time for these practices to properly embed." However it was found that some positive developments had been sustained beyond the end of the City Challenge programme in 2011.&lt;ref name="JRFLondonChallenge" /&gt;

Also in 2014, the [[CfBT Education Trust]] published findings of their own investigation into the reported success of London schools during the period of the London Challenge.&lt;ref name="CfBTReport2014" /&gt; This concluded that this success couldn't be explained in terms of contextual advantages such as gentrification, ethnicity and opportunity. Nor could they be fully attributable to resourcing factors such as finance, teacher recruitment and school building quality, although these did help the improvements to "flourish". The success was, instead, attributed to the combined effect of four Government interventions: London Challenge, [[Teach First]], the [[Academy (English school)|academies programme]] and improved support from local authorities. It was also concluded to be dependent on "effective leadership at every level of the system".

Later the same year, research from the [[University of Bristol]] largely attributed London's improvements in pupil progress over the London Challenge period to ethnic composition rather than specific Government interventions.&lt;ref name=BristolUni2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burgess|first1=Simon|title=Understanding the success of London’s schools|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/cmpo/migrated/documents/wp333.pdf|website=University of Bristol|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the paper concluded that "for other measures of attainment, the London premium is halved but remains significant."

A subsequent report by the Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion at the LSE demonstrated that most of the London effect could be accounted for by the improved performance in London primary schools, that there had not been any significant difference in the ethnic composition in London over the timeframe studied, and that the improved performance in primaries certainly coincided with the introduction of the National Literacy Strategies, though why they might have had more impact in London than elsewhere wasn't certain.  The report is called Understanding the improved performance of disadvantaged pupils in London, and can be found online.

The UK's national media has shown a strong interest in the success of the London Challenge and its legacy.&lt;ref name=GuardianDec2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tomlinson|first1=Mike|title=How London Challenge turned capital's schools around|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/11/london-challenge-turned-poor-schools-around|accessdate=29 June 2015|work=The Guardian|date=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Mediterranean Journal of Educational Studies''''' is a biannual [[open source]] refereed international journal with a regional focus. It features educational research carried out in Mediterranean countries, as well as educational studies related to the diaspora of Mediterranean people worldwide. The first issue of the MJES was published in 1996 and is now available free of charge.

The journal offers a forum for theoretical debate, historical and comparative studies, research and project reports, thus facilitating dialogue in a region which has strong and varied educational traditions. There is a strong international dimension to this dialogue, given the profile of the Mediterranean in the configuration of the [[new world order (politics)|new world order]], and the presence of Mediterranean peoples in Europe, North America and elsewhere.

The MJES is of interest to scholars, researchers and practitioners in the following fields: [[comparative education]], foundation disciplines in education, education policy analysis, Mediterranean studies, [[Cultural studies|cultural]] and [[post-colonial studies]], Southern European and area studies, intercultural education, peace education, and migrant studies.

[[Georges Duby]] of the [[Académie Française]], in the inaugural issue of the MJES, Vol.1 No.1, 1996, wrote:
:"For centuries, the Mediterranean has been a fertile meeting place for diverse civilisations. But it is also a fractured space, marked by violent confrontations and conflict...It is evident that the facing up to and resolution of these conflicts depends primarily on mutual understanding and a spirit of tolerance, both of which are promoted by education. This is why I enthusiastically support the launch of the MJES. It is particularly promising that the home of this journal is [[Malta]], that fertile crossroads in the region."

The '''Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education''' was a short-lived government ministry of the [[Russian Empire]], directing all educational and scientific institutions and the spiritual affairs of all faiths within Russia. 

It was formed by decree of [[Alexander I of Russia]] on 24 May (5 June) 1817 by merging the [[Ministry of National Education (Russian Empire)|Ministry of National Education]], the Chief Directorate of Religious Affairs of the Orthodox Faith of the [[Most Holy Synod]], and the Chief Directorate of Religious Affairs of Foreign (i.e. non-Orthodox) Faiths. This gave it its unofficial nicknames of the "double ministry" and the "twice as much ministry". It was disbanded in 1824 due to its significant duplication of Synod's functions.

The '''National Science Education Standards''' ('''NSES''')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csun.edu/science/ref/curriculum/reforms/nses/|title=National Science Education Standards|website=www.csun.edu|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; represent guidelines for the science education in primary and secondary schools in the [[United States]], as established by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] in 1996.  These provide a set of goals for teachers to set for their students and for administrators to provide professional development.  The NSES influence various states' own science learning standards (such as the [[Massachusetts Frameworks]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mass.gov/service-details/the-massachusetts-curriculum-frameworks-for-prek-12|title=The Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks for PreK-12|website=Mass.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and statewide [[standardized test]]ing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wvea.org/content/state-school-board-approves-reducing-standardized-testing|title=State school board approves reducing standardized testing {{!}} WVEA|website=www.wvea.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Education Reform==

The science standards is only one of a number of reforms organized around the principles of [[outcomes-based education]]. The mathematics counterpart are the controversial [[NCTM]] standards, which also de-emphasize knowledge of disconnected facts and content in favor of context-dependent critical thinking skills and process. Progressive education seeks to reform [[traditional education]], taking into account current understandings of human learning.

==Vision==

The content of these standards is based heavily on a specific model of learning, [[constructivism (learning theory)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teach-nology.com/currenttrends/constructivism/|title=Constructivism Learning Theory|website=www.teach-nology.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Like [[reform mathematics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bono|first=Melissa|date=2002-11-30|title=Reform in Mathematics Education: Rethinking the Curriculum|url=https://concept.journals.villanova.edu/article/view/313|journal=CONCEPT|language=en|volume=26|issue=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is distinguished by an emphasis on building on what a child already knows and understands, the standards intend to update the methods of science education to achieve greater effectiveness with children. The goals of the standards include:

* An outline of '''what students need to know, understand, and be able to do'''
* Targets for [[scientific literacy]] at different grade levels
* '''All students''' demonstrate '''high levels of performance'''
* Teachers are empowered to make the decisions essential for effective learning
* '''Communities of teachers and students''' are focused on learning science
* Educational programs and systems '''nurture achievement'''

The intended purpose of the standards is to define teaching methods which apply to all students, regardless of age, gender, cultural or ethnic background, disabilities, aspirations, or interest and motivation in science, recognizing that different students will achieve understanding in different ways, and some students will achieve different degrees of depth and breadth of understanding depending on interest, ability, and context. However, the standards
expect that all students can develop the knowledge and skills described in the standards.

The goal of scientific literacy includes inquiry, history and nature of science, personal and social perspectives of science, science, and technology, in addition to the science domains of life science, physical science, and earth and space science. Programs defined according to these standards should be [[Developmentally Appropriate Practice|developmentally appropriate]], interesting, and '''relevant''' to students’ lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10618&amp;page=39] The Influence of the National Science Education Standards on the Science Curriculum James D. Ellis University of Kansas&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization of the Standards==
The NSES are organized into six categories:

* Standards for science teaching, 
* Standards for professional development for teachers of science
* Standards for assessment in science education
* Standards for science content
* Standards for science education programs
* Standards for science education systems

==Critics==

Many critics of [[standards-based education reform]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~hakuta/www/archives/syllabi/CalTex_SBR/whatissbr.html|title=What Is Standards-Based Reform?|last=Lab|first=Step|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[reform mathematics]] are also critical of the emphasis of the standards on process and [[inquiry-based science]] rather than learning of facts. Science assessments such as [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning|WASL]] in Washington state&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/different-name-but-new-state-test-similar-to-wasl/|title=Different name, but new state test similar to WASL|date=2009-08-14|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; contain very little factual content, and most assessment is based on the ability of students as young as the fifth grade to construct and interpret science experiments. By contrast, previous generations of high school and even college students were only expected to participate in, rather than design science experiments from scratch, complete with a list of materials. The principles of the standards are similar to controversial approaches taken to mathematics and language arts which de-emphasize basic skills traditionally taught in elementary school as being inappropriate to the ability level of some students. Yet content and skills that were  traditionally taught at the college level, requiring "higher order" and "critical thinking" are brought down to K-12 to "raise standards".

Additionally, students have access to courses within modules in order to get all the resources that they need.

At the end of each module, the student is asked to complete a project that is then assessed by a [[Mentorship|mentor]].

When the student has completed all their projects, their work is assessed by a jury. If the session is successful, the student is then awarded an internationally recognized diploma.

OpenClassrooms currently has 12 available degree programs in French and 7 in English (Front-end web development, Ruby development, Android development, iOS development, full-stack web development, UX design, product management). Program take from 6 to 12 months to complete and the level of the program ranges from bachelor's-level to master's-level.

== Membership structure ==
OpenClassrooms operates on a [[freemium]] basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openclassrooms.com/premium|title=Our Premium offers|website=openclassrooms.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A user can register on OpenClassrooms for free and follow all courses on the platform. The number of videos a user can watch is, however, limited to 5 per week.

A user can sign up for a Premium Solo membership (costing €20 per month) and have access to unlimited videos as well as earn certificates.

A user can sign up for a Premium Plus membership (costing from €300 per month) and follow a structured learning path consisting of projects, dedicated mentoring sessions and a state-endorsed degree at the end.

== Accreditation ==
OpenClassrooms is an official private distance learning establishment registered with the Board of Education in Paris, France that grants its own degrees as well as those of other academic partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/55aa02f0-fa49-11e5-8f41-df5bda8beb40?mhq5j=e1|title=Moocs platform OpenClassrooms aims to fill UK tech skills gap|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completion of their studies and validation of their skills by an academic jury, the student will earn a bachelor's-level or master's-level diploma in the corresponding field of study.

For instance, the ''front-end web development program'' is at level 6 on the EQF (European Qualifications Framework). Thanks to the [[Bologna Process]], signed by 50 countries, the diploma is recognized by all participating countries, notably in [[Europe]].

Each path is the subject of a registration application with the National Directory of Professional Certifications ([http://www.rncp.cncp.gouv.fr/ RNCP]), via the National Commission of Professional Certifications ([http://www.cncp.gouv.fr/ CNCP]), in order for the level of the diploma to be recognized by the State.

== History ==
The origins of OpenClassrooms go back to 1999, when Mathieu Nebra,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://innovatorsunder35.com/innovator/mathieu-nebra|title=Mathieu Nebra {{!}} Innovators Under 35|website=innovatorsunder35.com|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped by Pierre Dubuc, launched a community site for tutorials called ''Le site du Zéro''. Its aim was to help young people to learn [[Programming language|programming languages.]]

In 2007, the site became a company, which offers online courses, [[Massive open online course|MOOC]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and learning paths on a [[freemium]] basis. These courses are created either in house, or in partnership with universities, such as [[École Polytechnique|École polytechnique,]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rudebaguette.com/2015/03/10/moocs-go-mainstream/|title=MOOCs go mainstream in France as OpenClassrooms partners with Polytechnique|last=12|first=Joran Le Cren March|last2=Reply|first2=2015|website=Rude Baguette|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and companies, such as [[IBM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tech.london/courses/ibm-and-openclassrooms-present-build-your-web-projects-with-rest-apis|title=IBM &amp; OpenClassrooms Present: Build your web projects with REST APIs|website=Tech.London|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, OpenClassrooms signed a deal with the French Government which gives free Premium Solo memberships (€20 per month) to all unemployed people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/23/openclassrooms-premium-is-now-free-for-unemployed-people-in-france/|title=OpenClassrooms Premium Is Now Free For Unemployed People In France {{!}} TechCrunch|last=Dillet|first=Romain|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, OpenClassrooms launched its first bachelor's degree in English in Web Development, recognized internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thepienews.com/news/openclassrooms-launches-first-english-taught-degree/|title=OpenClassrooms launches first English-taught degree|last=News|first=The PIE|website=thepienews.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6575">'''Peer-mediated instruction''' ('''PMI''') is an approach in [[special education]] where [[peer group|peers]] of the target students are trained to provide necessary tutoring in educational, behavioral, and/or social concerns.(Chan et al., 2009). In PMI, peers may mediate by [[Modelling (psychology)|modeling]] appropriate behavior themselves, using [[Response Prompting Procedures|prompting procedures]] to elicit appropriate behavior from the target students, and [[Reinforcement|reinforcing]] appropriate behavior when it occurs. The peer tutors are chosen from the target students' classrooms, trained to mediate and closely observed during mediation. Among the advantages noted to the technique, it takes advantage of the positive potential of [[Peer pressure#Benign peer pressure|peer pressure]] and may integrate target students more fully in their peer group. Conversely, it is time consuming to implement and presents challenges in making sure that the peers follow proper techniques. However, studies have suggested it may be an effective technique for a wide range of students, including those with [[autism spectrum]] disorders.

==Procedure==
A student or students will be chosen from the target student's classroom to serve as a peer tutor. Garrison-Harrell et al. (as cited in Chan et al., 2009) suggested a systematic way to choosing the peers to be involved in the treatment based on social status and teacher judgment. Students were asked to list three peers they would like to play with on the playground, three peers they would invite to a party, and three peers they consider to be good friends. Teachers reviewed the top candidates, and selected the tutors based on social skills, language skills, school attendance and classroom behavior.

The student or students chosen as peers must be properly coached before the peer relationship begins, both to understand the importance of the intervention and the methods which should be used. Instructors may model behaviors to the peer tutors and may role play with the peer tutors, allowing the peer tutors to experience both parts in the PMI relationship. Other methods for training could include visual aids, reinforcement for correct implementation, instruction manuals and video instructions. Once the PMI relationship begins, the teacher provides on-going feedback, watching the peer at all times while the intervention is being used. (Chan et al., 2009).

==Strengths and limitations==
There are advantages of using PMI as an intervention strategy. First, there is never a shortage of peers to use, especially when implementing an intervention in a school or classroom. Second, students are influenced through [[observational learning]] by what they see their peers doing. Third, students are often less intimidated by a peer than they are a teacher, which makes instruction and feedback from peers potentially more effective. Fourth, it may not only offer short-term intervention benefits, but can also strengthen the target student's social ties within the classroom. Finally, research has been done with many different types of learners, including students with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]], behavior disorders and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], which show that PMI may be effective for a wide range of students (Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2005; Flood, Wilder, Flood &amp; Masuda, 2002).  

In 2009, ''Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders'' published a paper by Chan ''et al.'' that concluded that PMI is a potentially effective intervention approach for students with Autism disorders.

==Application to General Education classroom settings==
Varying forms of peer-mediated instruction and interventions have been conducted in a great range of settings over the decades. Research has been conducted in educational and non-educational environments with positive outcomes in each. It is important to note that PMII strategies are not restricted or inclusive to education or special education, but have been found to be effective in each-as well as inclusive classroom settings. The following characteristics have been identified by Kulik &amp; Kulik (1992), as central for successful implementation of peer-mediated instruction.
      
*''Expectations for student learning''. Teachers should establish high expectation levels. No students are expected to fall below the level of learning needed to be successful at the next level of education.
*''Careful orientation to lessons''. Teachers must clearly describe the relationship of a current lesson to previous study. Students are reminded of key concepts or skills previously covered.
*''Clear and focused instructions to participants''.
*''Close teacher monitoring of student progress''. Frequently formal and informal monitoring of student learning by teachers. Teachers must require that students are accountable for their product and learning.
*''Re-teach''. If students show signs of confusion, misinterpretation or misunderstanding, the teacher must be responsible to teach again.
*''Use classtime for learning''. Students must pace themselves and should be monitored for task completion.
*''Positive and personal teacher and student interaction''. Cooperative Learning and Peer Tutoring Strategies are instruction methods of choice in many classrooms as they are noted for preventing and alleviating many social problems related to children, adolescents, and young adults.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="690">'''Qualifying Cross Country''', also abbreviated '''QXC''', is a flight training standard. Depending on the license type and country's regulatory requirements, it is generally a flight carried out solo, near the end of student training towards a Private Pilots License ([[Private Pilot License|PPL]]) or [[Private Ultralight Pilot]] license.  Normally the student would be expected to plan a triangular course [[navigation]] with one leg more than a specified distance and with one or more landings away from the home airfield.

The QXC is considered by many pilots to be the single most challenging part of gaining the first pilots license.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4144">The '''School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document''' (STPCD) is an annually-published document which forms a part of the contract of all [[teacher]]s and [[head teacher]]s in [[maintained school]]s in [[England]] and [[Wales]]. The document is binding on all maintained schools and [[local education authority|local education authorities]].

==Content==
The current version of the STPCD is formed of four sections, although the document itself is actually included in section 2. The document is accompanied by an explanatory introduction and statutory guidance.

===Section One===
The introduction of the document sets out its legal status, and gives summary details of key changes to the document in its most recent version.

===Section Two===
Section two is the main legal document, which sets out the key pay and conditions arrangements for teachers. Although sections vary, recent documents have been formed of 12 parts, outlines of which are listed:

====Part One====
This sets out the commencement arrangements for the document, and gives a detailed glossary of definitions for terms used within the document.

====Part Two====
This sets out the context of the document, including the need for teachers' pay to be reviewed annually, and setting requirements on schools to have a pay policy.

====Parts Three to Seven====
These parts set out the arrangements for the pay of head teachers, deputy head teachers, assistant head teacher, qualified teachers and unqualified teachers, including arrangements for [[performance related pay]], [[teaching and learning responsibility]] awards and other supplementary pay awards

====Parts Eight to Twelve====
These parts relate to the conditions under which teachers and school leaders are employed, including setting out the number of days to be worked, and the number of hours which teachers may be directed to work. Notably, it also includes a clause which requires a teacher to "work such reasonable additional hours as may be needed to enable him to discharm m 
ge effectively his professional duties"

These parts also detail the arrangements for planning, preparation and assessment time - that is, the allocation of time which must be set aside for teachers' planning and assessment during the school day, and during which time they cannot be required to teach pupils.

===Section Three===
This section gives general guidance for employers and employees on the application of the document.

===Section Four===
This section gives guidance on recent changes to teachers' pay and conditions since the introduction of the National Workload Agreement between the [[government]] and [[trade union|union]]s. This agreement saw the removal of administrative work from teachers' responsibilities, and introduced compulsory non-contact time for all teachers.

==New documents==
The content of each new document is formed following proposals from the [[School Teachers' Review Body]]. The body makes recommendations to the secretary of state, having received evidence from various bodies, including the secretary of state, teaching unions, and the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]].

==Enactment==
Each year, the document is constructed by the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] outlining the pay and conditions of teachers in schools. It must then be enacted by secondary legislation, and this too is produced annually in the name of [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills]]. The [[Statutory Instrument]] is currently issued under the provisions of the [[Education Act 2002]].

The secondary legislation usually takes the form of a statutory instrument entitled "The Education (School Teachers' Pay and Conditions) Order". This document revokes the previous year's document, replacing it with the new version. The legislation is normally brought in during August of each year, coming into effect on 1 September before new school terms start.

A '''slam book''' is a [[notebook]] (commonly the spiral-bound type) which is passed among children and teenagers. The keeper of the book starts by posing a question (which may be on any subject) and the book is then passed round for each contributor to fill in their own answer to the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mansour | first = David  | title = From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century | publisher = Andrews McMeel Publishing | year = 2005 | url = | isbn = 0-7407-5118-2 | page = 436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slam books were also a source of bullying between students—where students "lived in fear" of the "biting comments" written anonymously under their names, "on the order of what today might be a Tweet or a Facebook comment". &lt;ref&gt;''[[The Washington Post]]'': [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/10/AR2010121005373.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  A slam book containing cruel comments was featured in episode 3.20 ("Kids Can Be Cruel")  of the 1980s TV show "Facts of Life".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0575370/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl IMDB episode summary].&lt;/ref&gt;  

One early reference to slam books can be found in the November 18, 1928 issue of The Central New Jersey Home News where it was reported as a new fad among New Brunswick high school students.&lt;ref&gt; Republished in The Central New Jersey Home News (New Brunswick, New Jersey) on 22 Nov 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was defined in ''The Vocabulary of Jazzdom" in 1922 as "a diary in which you "knock" your friends." .&lt;ref&gt;The Tiller and Toiler (Larned, Kansas) on 25 May 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;

One newspaper article from 1930 argued that slam books could be a great thing for humanity.  ''"Psychology, industry and the ghastly exposure to the late war have changed [the Victorian era's faux veneer of sentimentality and taboos]. We have learned the price of sentimentality.  The youngster's of today are facing life and themselves as is."''&lt;ref&gt; ''Listen World'' by Elsie Robinson, Wausau Daily Herald (Wausau, Wisconsin)  on 01 Jul 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, however, slam books were seen in a negative light.  A slam book was briefly the focus in the murder investigation of Carole Lee Kensinger in 1948. &lt;ref&gt;''Slam Book Latest Clue In Girl Slaying'' as reported in The Pittsburgh Press (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) on  17 Dec 1948. See also The Daily Republican (Monongahela, Pennsylvania) on 17 Dec 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slam books crossed racial barriers and were popular among African American high school communities in the 1950s. &lt;ref&gt; ''Notebook Version of "Facebook" Was Popular'' by Theresa Greenwood, in The Star Press (Muncie, Indiana), dated Feb 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; And the books were not limited to the US. In 2005, friends created a slam book as a going away present for 16 year old Richa Thapa who emigrated from Nepal to the US.&lt;ref&gt; ''International student finds America not that different from native Nepal'' by Heather Wilson in The Hays Daily News (Hays, Kansas) dated 18 Oct 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Claire Morris-Dobbie launched "SLAM: A New Way To Tell The truth", a pre-made "slam book" with online tie in features in an attempt to combine nostalgia with the growing World Wide Web. It was billed as a "kinder and gentler" slam book  for teens and pre-teens with the goal of encouraging them to think and communicate, write and express themselves. &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19990208020354/http://www.slammit.com/ SLAM - A new way to tell the truth]; see also ''Dare To Bare It In'' by Michelle Ramos, published in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin (Honolulu, Hawaii) on Jan 8, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Slam books can also exist in virtual formats. Web-based slam book sites have attracted controversy for hosting virtual slam books in which individuals or organizations are targeted for criticism that constitutes bullying or defamation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tampa Tribune]]'': [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/tampatribune/access/118663294.html?dids=118663294:118663294&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+08%2C+2002&amp;author=CANDACE+J.+SAMOLINSKI+and+RONNIE+BLAIR&amp;pub=Tampa+Tribune&amp;desc=Issues+Raised+Over+Web+Slambooks&amp;pqatl=google Issues Raised Over Web Slambooks]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some point to slam books as the analog precursor to anonymous trolling and negative social interactions on Twitter and Facebook. "''Passing handwritten notes or "slam books" has since been replaced with online tools such as IM, websites, blogs, cell phones etc.''"&lt;ref&gt;''Don't blame technology for the cruelty of its users''  by Rick Malwizt published in The Courier-News (Bridgewater, New Jersey)  on 06 Oct 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction''' (SPIE) system was developed as a means to rapidly insert and/or extract a [[reconnaissance]] [[patrol]] from an area that does not permit a helicopter to land.  SPIE has application for rough terrain as well as water inserts/extracts. It is an adaptation of the [[Vietnam War]]-era [[STABO]] rig.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vietnamgear.com/kit.aspx?kit=661&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the SPIE rope is lowered into the pickup area from a hovering helicopter.  Patrol personnel, each wearing a harness with an attached [[carabiner]], hook up to a D-ring inserted in the SPIE rope.  A second safety line is attached to a second D-ring located above the first.  The helicopter lifts vertically from an extract zone until the rope and personnel are clear of obstructions, then proceeds in forward flight to a secure insert zone.  The rope and personnel are treated as an external load and airspeeds, altitudes, and oscillations must be monitored.&lt;ref&gt;FMFM 7-40 Helicopter Rope Suspension Training (HRST) Operations&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Coast Guard]] uses a similar technique to board ships when speed and stealth are required.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==History==
The Special Personnel Insertion/Extraction was first designed by the Marines of [[1st Force Reconnaissance Company]], the Marine division's [[1st Reconnaissance Battalion]], and the [[1st Marine Aircraft Wing]] riggers.  They created and combat tested several versions of the SPIE before it was officially recommended to be tested.  In May 1970, the commanding general of [[3rd Marine Expeditionary Force|3rd Marine Amphibious Force]] coordinated input from the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] and his [[1st Marine Air Wing]].  A request was sent to the [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] and to the Development Center for certification of the SPIE rig and to its safety and use.&lt;ref name="Meyers, 1stFORECON"&gt;Bruce F. Meyers, ''Fortune Favors the Brave: The Story of First Force Recon,'' (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

The parachute test jumpers of the Naval Parachute Unit (NPU) and Marine Corps, all qualified parachutist designers and engineers, assembled together at [[Naval Air Facility El Centro|El Centro]] for the initial testing and evaluation of the SPIE rig.  After a few test dummies were tried, Marine Major Bruce F. Meyers, along with four Navy NPU parachutist engineers, successfully attempted the first flight on the SPIE assembly.

The '''Squeak''' [[programming language]] is a dialect of [[Smalltalk]]. It is [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented]], [[class (computer science)|class-based]], and [[reflection (computer programming)|reflective]].

It was derived directly from Smalltalk-80 by a group at [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] that included some of the original Smalltalk-80 developers. Its development was continued by the same group at [[Walt Disney Imagineering]], where it was intended for use in internal Disney projects. Later on the group moved on to be supported by HP labs, SAP Labs and most recently [[Y Combinator (company) | Y Combinator]].

Squeak is [[cross-platform]]. Programs produced on one platform run bit-identical on all other platforms, and versions are available for many platforms including the obvious Windows/macOS/linux versions. The Squeak system includes code for generating a new version of the [[virtual machine]] (VM) on which it runs. It also includes a VM simulator written in Squeak. For these reasons, it is easily [[Porting|ported]]. 

==Developers==
[[Dan Ingalls]], an important contributor to the Squeak project, wrote the paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=263754&amp;coll=portal&amp;dl=ACM |first=Dan |last=Ingalls |first2=Ted |last2=Kaehler |first3=John |last3=Maloney |first4=Scott |last4=Wallace |first5=Alan |last5=Kay |title=Back to the Future: the story of Squeak, a practical Smalltalk written in itself |publisher=ACM Digital Library |year=1997 |accessdate=2011-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; upon which Squeak is built and constructed the architecture for five generations of the Smalltalk language.

Squeak incorporates many of the elements [[Alan Kay]] proposed in the [[Dynabook]] concept, which he formulated in the 1960s. Kay is an important contributor to the Squeak project.

==User interface frameworks==
Squeak includes four [[user interface]] frameworks:
* An implementation of [[Morphic (software)|Morphic]], [[Self (programming language)|Self's]] graphical [[direct manipulation interface]] framework. This is Squeak's main interface.
* Tile-based, limited [[visual programming language|visual programming]] scripting in [[Etoys (programming language)|Etoys]], based on Morphic.
* A novel, experimental interface called [[Tweak programming environment|Tweak]]. In 2001 it became clear that the Etoy architecture in Squeak had reached its limits in what the Morphic interface infrastructure could do. Hewlett-Packard researcher Andreas Raab proposed defining a "script process" and providing a default scheduling-mechanism that avoids several more general problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tweakproject.org/ABOUT/FAQ/OriginalTweakMemo/ |title=Tweak: OriginalTweakMemo |publisher=Tweakproject.org |date=2001-07-06 |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002012532/http://tweakproject.org/ABOUT/FAQ/OriginalTweakMemo/ |archivedate=2011-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a new user interface, proposed to replace the Squeak Morphic user interface in the future. Tweak added mechanisms of islands, asynchronous messaging, players and costumes, language extensions, projects, and tile scripting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tweakproject.org/TECHNOLOGY/Whitepapers/ |title=Tweak: Whitepapers |publisher=Tweakproject.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002012629/http://tweakproject.org/TECHNOLOGY/Whitepapers/ |archivedate=2011-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its underlying object system is class-based, but to users, during programming (scripting), it acts like it is [[prototype-based programming|prototype-based]]. Tweak objects are created and run in Tweak project windows.
* A [[model–view–controller]] (MVC) interface was the primary UI in Squeak versions 3.8 and earlier. It derived from the original Smalltalk-80 user interface framework which first introduced and popularized the MVC architectural pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/smarch/st-docs/mvc.html |first=Steve |last=Burbeck |title=How to use Model-View-Controller (MVC) |publisher=St-www.cs.uiuc.edu |date=1997-04-04 |accessdate=2011-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801040629/http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/smarch/st-docs/mvc.html |archivedate=2009-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; MVC takes its name from the three core classes of the framework. Thus, the term "MVC" in the context of Squeak refers to both one of the available user interface frameworks and the pattern the framework follows. MVC is still provided for programmers who wished to use this older type of interface.

==Uses==
Many Squeak contributors collaborate on [[Open Cobalt]], a [[free software|free]] and [[open-source software|open source]]  [[virtual world]] browser and construction toolkit application which is built on Squeak.

Squeak is also used in the Nintendo ES operating system&lt;ref name="gamasutra"&gt;{{ cite web | title = Inside Nintendo's ES Open-Source Operating System | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=16503 | publisher = Gamasutra | date = 2007-12-04| accessdate = 2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for implementing the [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]]
programming language for beginning programmers. In May 2011 the [[OpenQwaq]] virtual conferencing and collaboration system based on Squeak, an open source release of Teleplace, was announced on the Teleplace blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Moving Immersive Collaboration Forward|url=http://teleplace.wordpress.com/2011/05/03/moving-immersive-collaboration-forward/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==License==
Squeak 4.0 and later may be downloaded at no cost, including source code, as a prebuilt [[virtual machine]] image licensed under the [[MIT License]], with the exception of some of the original Apple code, which is governed by the [[Apache License]].

Originally, Apple actually released Squeak under a license called the ''Squeak License''. While source code was available and modification permitted, the Squeak License contained an [[indemnity clause]] that prevented it from qualifying as true [[free and open-source software]].

In 2006, Apple [[Software relicensing|relicensed]] Squeak twice. First, in May, Apple used its own [[Apple Public Source License]], which satisfies the [[Free Software Foundation]]'s concept of a Free Software License&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/apsl.html |title=FSF's Opinion on the Apple Public Source License (APSL) 2.0 |publisher=Gnu.org |date=2011-05-07 |accessdate=2011-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has attained official approval from the [[Open Source Initiative]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensource.org/pressreleases/osi-clarifies-APSL.php |title=Clarification of the APSL: Press Releases OS Clarifies The Status Of The APSL |publisher=Opensource.org |date=1999-03-17 |accessdate=2011-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an Open Source License. The Apple Public Source License, as it turns out, fails to pass the third standard that Free and Open Source Software licenses are held to: the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]] promulgated by the [[Debian]] project, an influential volunteer-run [[Linux]] distribution. To enable inclusion of [[Etoys (programming language)|Etoys]] in the [[One Laptop Per Child]] project, a second relicensing was undertaken using the Apache License. At this point, an effort was also made to address the issue of code contributed by members of the Squeak community, which it was not in Apple's power to unilaterally relicense.

For each contribution made under the Squeak License since 1996, a relicensing statement was obtained authorizing distribution under the [[MIT license]], and finally in March 2010, the end result was released as Squeak 4.0, now under combined MIT and Apache licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Squeak-4-0-released-now-under-MIT-Apache-license-956267.html |publisher=The H Open |title=Squeak 4.0 released - now under MIT/Apache license |date=2010-03-16 |accessdate=2011-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Squeak virtual machine ==
{{refimprove|date=July 2016}}
The ''Squeak virtual machine'' is a family of [[virtual machine]]s (VMs) used in [[Smalltalk]] programming language implementations. They are an essential part of any Smalltalk implementation. All are [[open-source software]]. The current VM is a high performance dynamic translation system. The relevant code is maintained on GitHub at [https://github.com/OpenSmalltalk/opensmalltalk-vm.git OpenSmalltalk]

'''Tabitha A. D'umo''' ([[Married and maiden names|née]] '''Cortopassi'''; born September 11, 1973) and '''Napoleon Buddy D'umo''' (born October 17, 1968), known together as '''Nappytabs''', are [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Award]]-winning married [[choreographer]]s who are often credited with developing ''lyrical'' hip-hop. They are best known for their choreography on the television show ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'' and for being supervising choreographers and executive producers of ''[[America's Best Dance Crew]]''. Since being with the former, their choreography has received both praise and criticism. They own Nappytabs urban dancewear and have been working in the dance industry since 1996.

Tabitha and Napoleon grew up on opposite coasts of the United States and met in the early 1990s as students at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. They began their dance career together while still in college by choreographing [[industrial musicals]] for large corporations with the [[hip-hop dance]] company Culture Shock. After moving to Los Angeles in 1999, they started teaching hip-hop classes at the Edge Performing Arts Center. They took additional jobs choreographing for professional sports dance teams and back-up dancing for musical artists. In 2003, they joined the faculty of Monsters of Hip Hop dance convention.

Their work was introduced to mainstream audiences in 2008 when they became supervising choreographers on ''America's Best Dance Crew'' and resident choreographers on ''So You Think You Can Dance''. It was on the later show that their lyrical hip-hop choreography style gained exposure. The pair's career progressed to providing creative direction for tours and live events by Christina Aguilera, Ricky Martin, Celine Dion, and Jennifer Lopez. They continued to develop their dancewear line by breaking out of its previously online-only presence and opening a physical store location in 2010.

From television and concerts, their move into theater occurred gradually. In 2010, they directed the [[JabbaWockeeZ]]'s ''MÜS.I.C.'' stage show and began to work with [[Cirque du Soleil]]; they choreographed ''[[Viva Elvis]]'' and were contributing choreographers for ''[[Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour]]''. They continued to establish themselves in television as choreographers for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s [[Super Bowl]] halftime performance. By 2015, they had choreographed several [[K-pop]] music videos for artists such as [[TVXQ]], [[Exo (band)|EXO]], and [[BoA]]. Aside from their choreography, creative direction, and dancewear line, Tabitha and Napoleon continue to teach hip-hop classes at dance studios and on the convention circuit. They have also been involved with charity work for organizations that support the arts.

In April 2013, Tabitha and Napoleon choreographed the music video "Puttin' on the Ritz" by [[Herb Alpert]].&lt;ref name=ritz/&gt; Two months later, they recreated the video on SYTYCD as the opening routine for [[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. season 10)|season ten]]'s Top 20 performance episode. Yahoo! Music called the performance "absolutely epic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parker|first=Lyndsey|date=June 25, 2013|title='SYTYCD' Puts on the Ritz for Season 10's First Live Episode|url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/reality-rocks/sytycd-puts-ritz-season-10-first-live-episode-020645015.html|work=Music.Yahoo.com|accessdate=July 5, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414031310/https://music.yahoo.com/blogs/reality-rocks/sytycd-puts-ritz-season-10-first-live-episode-020645015.html|archivedate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the video, it was also shot in one take and several people made cameo appearances including [[Sean Cheesman]], [[Travis Wall]], [[Christopher Scott (choreographer)|Chris Scott]], [[Mary Murphy (choreographer)|Mary Murphy]], [[Jason Gilkison]], Nigel Lythgoe, Herb Alpert, Lani Hall, and Tabitha and Napoleon themselves.&lt;ref name=ritz&gt;{{cite web|date=June 28, 2013|title=The Top 20 Put On The Ritz!|url=http://www.fox.com/dance/news/2013/June/top-20-perform|work=Fox.com|accessdate=July 5, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707063358/http://www.fox.com/dance/news/2013/June/top-20-perform|archivedate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, Tabitha and Napoleon teamed up with TVXQ again to choreograph their music video "[[Spellbound (TVXQ album)#Lead single|Spellbound]]"—the title track from their seventh album. Just like Alpert's "Puttin' on the Ritz", this video was shot in one take, and just like BoA's "Only One", SeoulBeats.com gave it a positive review: "With two people in the group, there is not much of an opportunity to play around with different formations. However, Nappytabs tends to utilize this formation for TVXQ – rotating the members in the foreground and background, instead of always keeping the two in the centre. And this works especially well with the one-shot style, since it allows room for the duo to work the entire space on set, on and off-camera."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joyce|date=March 3, 2014|title=TVXQ Leaves Fans 'Spellbound'|url=http://seoulbeats.com/2014/03/tvxq-leaves-fans-spellbound|work=SeoulBeats.com|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billboard.com gave the video a positive review: "The duo makes a strong case for 2014's best choreography in the [Spellbound] video."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oak|first=Jessica|date=February 27, 2014|title=TVXQ!

After the ''Move'' tour, Tabitha and Napoleon continued to work on music videos.

They directed and choreographed the music video for "Harlem Hopscotch", the first single from [[Maya Angelou]]'s posthumous poetry album ''Caged Bird Songs''. The video premiered December 23, 2014, on Oprah.com and features cameo appearances by Derek Hough and actress [[Zendaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Dr. Maya Angelou's "Harlem Hopscotch" Music Video Premiere Tuesday, December 23rd, 2014, on Oprah.com Directed by Emmy Winning Duo, Tabitha and Napolean Dumo and Produced by Smooch Music|publisher=Market Wired|date=December 23, 2014|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/dr-maya-angelous-harlem-hopscotch-music-video-premiere-tuesday-december-23rd-2014-on-1979320.htm|accessdate=December 31, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231001017/http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/dr-maya-angelous-harlem-hopscotch-music-video-premiere-tuesday-december-23rd-2014-on-1979320.htm|archivedate=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017–present: World of Dance===

==Choreography style==
===Artistry===
Tabitha and Napoleon's choreography is primarily hip-hop;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idolator.com/5575431/five-minutes-with-tabitha-and-napoleon|title=Five Minutes With Tabitha And Napoleon Of ‘So You Think You Can Dance’|last=Adickman|first=Erika Brooks|date=July 28, 2010|work=Idolator.com|accessdate=January 22, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64tBjeHdJ?url=http://idolator.com/5575431/five-minutes-with-tabitha-and-napoleon|archivedate=January 22, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it varies across genres depending on what project they're working on. For example, on ''America's Best Dance Crew'' all of the group routines they choreographed were hip-hop. However, on ''So You Think You Can Dance'' (SYTYCD) they choreographed a few jazz routines&lt;ref name=lamag/&gt; and on Cirque du Soleil their work incorporated [[Acro dance|acro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|people=Tabitha and Napoleon D'umo |date=February 26, 2010|title=Napoleon and Tabitha D'umo at World Premiere of Viva Elvis|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8aT6Y_EiUQm|type=Interview|publisher=MyVegasNet|location=Las Vegas, NV|accessdate=August 1, 2010|time=:35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, their choreography emphasizes big visuals, which they attribute to their cheerleading past,&lt;ref name=cheer/&gt; and is "...largely centered on storytelling and physical comedy."&lt;ref name="hot d'umos"/&gt; Inspiration for lifts is taken from [[lucha libre]], [[Adagio (acrobatics)|adagio]], and [[Swing (dance)|swing dance]].&lt;ref name=lamag/&gt; The style they are most known for is lyrical hip-hop.

===Lyrical hip-hop===
Lyrical dance is a studio-based dance style that uses a combination of classical dance techniques from jazz and ballet to tell a story through movement.&lt;ref name=lyric&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Gray|title=Lyrical Dancing|url=http://dance.lovetoknow.com/Lyrical_Dancing|work=LoveToKnow.com|accessdate=November 1, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62rlY7Lbd?url=http://dance.lovetoknow.com/Lyrical_Dancing|archivedate=November 1, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With jazz and ballet, technique alone can provide a good performance but in lyrical dance expressing emotion is emphasized just as much as technique.&lt;ref name=lyric/&gt; [[Hip-hop dance|Hip-hop]] is an urban dance style that is characterized as hard-hitting involving isolations&lt;ref name=crash&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wisner|first=Heather|date=October 2007|title=Crash Course: Hip Hop|journal=Dance|volume=81|issue=10|pages=82–85|issn=0011-6009}}&lt;/ref&gt;—moving certain body parts independently from others—and musicality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Lauren|date=July 2010|title=Finding Your Groove|journal=Dance Spirit|volume=14|issue=6|page=76|issn=1094-0588}}&lt;/ref&gt; the body's sensitivity to changes in music. Hip-hop can incorporate movement from its substyles [[locking (dance)|locking]], breaking, [[popping]], and [[The Electric Boogaloos|boogaloo]] to add a different movement quality but conveying emotion does not have to be present as the dance is more about bravado and personal enjoyment. Lyrical hip-hop is a fluid and more interpretive version of standard hip-hop. It combines the nuances of lyrical dance with the vocabulary and foundational movements found in hip-hop. According to ''Dance Spirit'' magazine, what differentiates lyrical hip-hop from standard hip-hop is that dancers interpret the beat differently.&lt;ref name=levinson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Lauren|date=May 1, 2009|title=Lyrical Hip Hop|journal=Dance Spirit|volume=13|issue=5|pages=48–50|url=http://www.dancespirit.com/2011/01/lyrical_hip_hop|accessdate=April 25, 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5q4R2fdcI?url=http://www.dancespirit.com/articles/2131|archivedate=May 28, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In lyrical hip-hop there are still isolations, gliding, and body waves just like in standard hip-hop. However, the movements are smoother and more fluid rather than hard-hitting and, like lyrical dance, emphasis is placed on storytelling and conveying emotion through the choreography.&lt;ref name=levinson/&gt;
{{quote box|align=right|width=220px|bgcolor=#ADD8E6|quote="This is one of the great things about this show is that we've really explored a totally new thing which is lyrical hip-hop and [Tabitha and Napoleon] nail it... It shows you that hip-hop [has] completely become a really legitimate beautiful genre in and of its own and you can tell such beautiful and heart breaking stories."|source=Adam Shankman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Top 16 Perform|series=So You Think You Can Dance|serieslink=So You Think You Can Dance (United States)|network=[[Fox TV|Fox]]|airdate=June 25, 2008|season=4|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Lyrical hip-hop first gained mainstream exposure, and its name, in 2008 on season four of SYTYCD. The term itself is credited to [[Adam Shankman]], a choreographer and judge on the program, who made a comment in reference to a routine choreographed by Tabitha and Napoleon D'umo to Leona Lewis' song "[[Bleeding Love]]".&lt;ref name=levinson/&gt; Due to Shankman's comment and their subsequent work on seasons four through seven, Tabitha and Napoleon are credited with developing this style.&lt;ref name=laist/&gt;&lt;ref name="lyrical"/&gt;&lt;ref name=people/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peterson|first=Jesse|title=Lyrical Hip Hop Takes Center Stage|work=The Expressionist|date=June 25, 2008|url=http://www.theexpressionist.com/2008/06/25/lyrical-hip-hop-takes-center-stage|accessdate=April 12, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qsjEfwKT?url=http://www.theexpressionist.com/2008/06/25/lyrical-hip-hop-takes-center-stage/|archivedate=June 30, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some hip-hop purists feel the interpretive and softer approach means lyrical hip-hop is not hip-hop at all. From a purist perspective, dancing to the lyrics would make the choreography [[wikt:linear|linear]] and too technical.&lt;ref name=levinson/&gt; This is because dancing to the words would take precedence over dancing to the beat. Traditionally in hip-hop, dancing to the beat is essential; lyrics can accent the movement, but the beat is the guiding force for the dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physical Graffiti... The History of Hip Hop Dance|last=Pabon|first=Jorge|url=http://www.daveyd.com/historyphysicalgrafittifabel.html|work=DaveyD.com|accessdate=July 31, 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5q4R2fdUk?url=http://www.daveyd.com/historyphysicalgrafittifabel.html|archivedate=May 28, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hip-hop dancers, such as choreographer [[Shane Sparks]], believe that lyrical hip-hop is hip-hop but not different enough for it to have a separate label or be in its own subgenre.&lt;ref name=levinson/&gt;

===Teaching===
Although Tabitha and Napoleon have a solid career in choreography and creative direction, they spend a significant amount of time teaching classes at dance studios and conventions. They have stated that teaching helps their choreography because it keeps them current on new hip-hop social dances (party dances).&lt;ref name="hot d'umos"/&gt; They are faculty members at Monsters of Hip Hop dance convention.&lt;ref name=mohh/&gt; In the past they have taught at Shock the Intensive,&lt;ref name=shock/&gt; the Edge Performing Arts Center, Millennium Dance Complex, Hip Hop International, Dance Blitz, Seattle Theater Group, Coastal Dance Rage, the Dance Teacher Web Conference and Expo, Teen Dance Company of the Bay Area, JUMP, Xtreme Dance Force, ProDance, Triple Threat Dance, Project 818, Boogiezone, iHollywood, the So You Think You Can Dance Experience, DANCE!

==Critical reception==
===JabbaWockeeZ===
The [[JabbaWockeeZ]] performed the show ''MÜS.I.C.'' from May 2010 to September 2012. Over the course of their two-year run, the show received mixed reviews. For their second show ''PRiSM'' they signed a six-year deal which included building a new 830-seat theater in a space that used to house a motion-simulator ride.&lt;ref name=preview/&gt; Upon opening, ''PRiSM'' was met with positive reviews. Tabitha and Napoleon directed both shows.

The first run of ''MÜS.I.C.'' was held at the MGM Grand Las Vegas hotel and casino. ''Las Vegas Weekly'' wrote that ''MÜS.I.C.'' had "game-changing potential" because it was the first time [[hip-hop dance]] had headlined a show on the Las Vegas Strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Corbin |first=April |url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2010/may/09/awesome-anonymity/ |title=Awesome anonymity |work=Las Vegas Weekly |date=May 9, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sJzuOPNh?url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2010/may/09/awesome-anonymity/ |archivedate=August 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'' (LVRJ) criticized the show for being repetitious and for having a bare stage for the first 20 minutes.&lt;ref name=review&gt;{{cite news|last=Weatherford|first=Mike|url=http://www.lvrj.com/neon/jabbawockeez-93757434.html|title=SHOW REVIEW: Jabbawockeez|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=May 14, 2010|accessdate=August 1, 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62U8Sd1Ej?url=http://www.lvrj.com/neon/jabbawockeez-93757434.html|archivedate=October 16, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; LVRJ also criticized the use of masks as not appealing to a casual viewer because it inhibited the dancers' personality: "Even if a generational split is in play here, it would be tough to hear the creators argue that the show would suffer if, after 20 minutes or so -- gasp! -- makeup or clown-face replaced the masks to expand the original concept."&lt;ref name=review/&gt; In October 2010, the show moved to the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino. Changes to the original show included a bigger stage, a new set, and added dance routines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Colton|first=Sandra|title=NappyTabs Preview The Jabbawockeez 'MUS.I.C' at The Monte Carlo|url=http://www.dancetrackmagazine.com/?p=2213|work=Dance Track|date=October 6, 2010|accessdate=October 18, 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62U8hNki7?url=http://www.dancetrackmagazine.com/?p=2213|archivedate=October 16, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CraveOnline.com called the new show "amazing"&lt;ref name=crave&gt;{{cite web|last=Childress|first=Ahmad|date=October 23, 2010|title=Jabbawockeez MUS.I.C opens at the Monte Carlo|url=http://www.craveonline.com/lifestyle/article/jabbawockeez-music-opens-at-the-monte-carlo-115007|work=CraveOnline.com|accessdate=November 30, 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uckrLi7a?url=http://www.craveonline.com/lifestyle/article/jabbawockeez-music-opens-at-the-monte-carlo-115007|archivedate=November 30, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Zap2It.com described it as "a vibrant, frenetic and multi-genre extravaganza of visuals, sound and movement."&lt;ref name=newshow&gt;{{cite web|last=Nguyen|first=Hanh|date=October 31, 2010|title=JabbaWockeez MUS.I.C. at the Monte Carlo Las Vegas: A behind-the-mask expose|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/10/jabbawockeez-music-at-the-monte-carlo-las-vegas-a-behind-the-mask-expose.html|work=Zap2It.com|accessdate=November 30, 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uciBECLu?url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/10/jabbawockeez-music-at-the-monte-carlo-las-vegas-a-behind-the-mask-expose.html|archivedate=November 30, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the Jabbawockeez began running two ''MÜS.I.C.'' shows in tandem. Some members stayed with the flagship show in Las Vegas while the others took the show on limited residencies elsewhere. Their first residency outside Las Vegas was in Australia at the Jupiters Hotel and Casino in [[Gold Coast, Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Browne|first=Sally|title=US dance sensation Jabbawokeez to land at Jupiters|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/life/whatson/us-dance-sensation-to-land-on-jupiters/story-fn8zvh1s-1226326724554|accessdate=May 22, 2012|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]]|date=June 15, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67qUE6JVT?url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/life/whatson/us-dance-sensation-to-land-on-jupiters/story-fn8zvh1s-1226326724554|archivedate=May 22, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gold Coast Magazine'' gave the show a good review describing it as "magical... it truly does stir an emotional response through your soul and the combination of dance and drama make it appealing to all ages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kirra|title=REVIEW: Jabbawockeez MÜS.I.C.|url=http://www.goldcoastmagazine.com.au/2012/04/review-jabbawockeez-mus-i-c|work=Gold Coast Magazine|date=April 25, 2012|accessdate=June 19, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68XsjlKMU?url=http://www.goldcoastmagazine.com.au/2012/04/review-jabbawockeez-mus-i-c/|archivedate=June 19, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Jupiters, the Jabbawockeez took up a second month-long residency in August 2012 at Harrah's Resort Atlantic City casino in New Jersey. Philly.com gave it a lukewarm review: "The problem is that as good as Jabbawockeez is at what [they do], the novelty wears off about a third-way through the show... the bulk of the performance pretty much offers little more than variations on a theme. As such, Jabbawockeez would have much more impact as a featured act in a variety show than it has on its own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Darrow|first=Chuck|date=August 17, 2012|title=Casinos offer booze you can use|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/casinotes/166521402.html|work=Philly.com|accessdate=August 28, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AFCd9gBF?url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/casinotes/166521402.html|archivedate=August 28, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members that stayed in Las Vegas temporarily moved into an 800-seat tent outside the Monte Carlo to continue their show.

====''PRiSM''====
The JabbaWockeeZ second stage show ''PRiSM'' opened at the Luxor Las Vegas on May 31, 2013. The show's original title was ''Nonsense'' (a nod to [[Jabberwocky|the crew's name]]) because, at the time, they lacked a cohesive theme. However, it was Napoleon's idea to change the title to ''PRiSM'' since there are seven crew members and when light goes into a [[Dispersive prism|prism]], seven colors emerge (the Luxor hotel is in the shape of a triangular prism). From that point on, unity and color became the themes of the show&lt;ref name=preview&gt;{{cite web|last=Weatherford|first=Mike|date=May 16, 2013|title=Jabbawockeez showing another side in new show 'Prism'|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/shows/jabbawockeez-showing-another-side-new-show-prism|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|accessdate=May 30, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616172215/http://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/shows/jabbawockeez-showing-another-side-new-show-prism|archivedate=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the title was given the [[backronym]] Painting Reality in a Spectrum of Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lane|first=Richard|date=May 17, 2013|title=Look Inside The World Of Jabbawockeez's PRiSM|url=http://www.vegaschatter.com/story/2013/5/17/17222/8593/vegas-travel/Look+Inside+The+World+Of+Jabbawockeez's+PRiSM|work=VegasChatter.com|accessdate=May 30, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622124632/http://www.vegaschatter.com/story/2013/5/17/17222/8593/vegas-travel/Look+Inside+The+World+Of+Jabbawockeez's+PRiSM|archivedate=June 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''PRiSM'' received positive reviews. ''Las Vegas Weekly'' wrote "Those who deride the art of pantomime or breakdancing need to check this show out.

Several reviewers noted that overall ''PRiSM'' is better than ''MÜS.I.C.'' LVRJ wrote "...it all seems to hang together better this time, with a seamless flow and unifying themes of brotherhood and diversity."&lt;ref name=redemption/&gt; ''Dance Track Magazine'' wrote "Not only does the show have a much more intimate feel than previous Jabbawockeez shows, but ''PRiSM'' also includes increased audience participation, intensified humor and a storyline that is dramatic and flows through the entire performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Colton|first=Sandra|title=Jabbawockeez Blaze New Vision in PRiSM|url=http://www.dancetrackmagazine.com/jabbawockeez-see-new-vision-in-prism|date=May 25, 2013|work=Dance Track Magazine|accessdate=June 19, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609071849/http://www.dancetrackmagazine.com/jabbawockeez-see-new-vision-in-prism/|archivedate=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; IGoShows.com had the same observation: "...the [previous] shows were plagued by lost opportunities, undeveloped ideas, and repetition. They seem to have corrected these shortcomings. 'Prism' is better in almost every way over its predecessors. The show has a cohesiveness that it never had before, good follow-through on ideas, and far more intriguing staging. The choreography is strong, varied, and doesn’t suffer the repetition that had invaded it previously."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rounds|first=Chuck|title=Jabbawockeez - Prism|url=http://www.igoshows.com/reviews/review234.html|work=IGoShows.com|date=June 6, 2013|accessdate=July 21, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408034628/http://www.igoshows.com/reviews/review234.html|archivedate=April 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''So You Think You Can Dance''===
Most criticism of Tabitha and Napoleon's choreography has come as a result of their work on ''So You Think You Can Dance'' (SYTYCD). Over the course of their involvement with the show, they have received mixed reviews. At worst, their choreography has been criticized as "softie hip-hop (more like 'hip-pop')".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parker|first=Lyndsey|title=‘SYTYCD’ Top 8 Recap: All Aboard The Hot Jalapeño Bus!|url=http://ca.music.yahoo.com/blogs/reality-rocks/sytycd-top-8-recap-aboard-hot-jalape%C3%B1o-bus-052735747.html|work=Music.Yahoo.com|date=August 30, 2012|accessdate=September 5, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ASjYtrwb?url=http://ca.music.yahoo.com/blogs/reality-rocks/sytycd-top-8-recap-aboard-hot-jalape%C3%B1o-bus-052735747.html|archivedate=September 5, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At best, it has been described as "amazing"&lt;ref name=swigg/&gt; and "bring[ing] out the best in their dancers..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Stephanie|title=The Top 5 Best NappyTabs Routines of All Time (VIDEOS)|url=http://www.wetpaint.com/so-you-think-you-can-dance/articles/the-top-5-best-nappytabs-routines-of-all-time-videos-|work=WetPaint.com|date=February 21, 2012|accessdate=September 5, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ASjQYNcd?url=http://www.wetpaint.com/so-you-think-you-can-dance/articles/the-top-5-best-nappytabs-routines-of-all-time-videos-|archivedate=September 5, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seasons five and six brought less praise for Tabitha and Napoleon.

==Awards and recognition==
'''Primetime Emmy Awards'''&lt;br&gt;
Tabitha and Napoleon have won two Emmys from a total of four nominations. At the 2013 Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony, they joined the other choreography nominees and created a routine honoring dance that was performed just before the Outstanding Choreography award was presented. 2013 was the first year the Outstanding Choreography award was presented at the Primetime Emmys telecast rather than at the [[Primetime Emmy Award#Creative Arts Primetime Emmys|Creative Arts Emmy]]s ceremony which takes place a week prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garron|first=Barry|date=September 20, 2013|title=Breaking Bad, Modern Family Are Top Shows at 65th Primetime Emmys|url=http://www.emmys.com/news/awards-news/65th-primetime-emmys-wrap|work=Emmys.com|accessdate=September 28, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201205023/http://www.emmys.com/news/awards-news/65th-primetime-emmys-wrap|archivedate=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charity work==
Tabitha and Napoleon have donated money and their time to different non-profit organizations. In 2009, they made an appearance at the Life Changing Lives Gala, the proceeds of which benefited the [[Wounded Warrior Project]], the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]], and the [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys &amp; Girls Clubs]].&lt;ref name=laist/&gt; At the event, dancers Katie Shean and Joshua Allen from season four of ''So You Think You Can Dance'' performed the D'umo choreographed "No Air" lyrical hip-hop routine about a soldier telling his girlfriend he is being deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywire.com/uncategorized/life-changing-lives-gala-to-feature-live-performances|title=Life Changing Live's Gala To Feature Live Performances|date=September 1, 2009|work=Hollywire.com|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rZDssSi4?url=http://www.hollywire.com/uncategorized/life-changing-lives-gala-to-feature-live-performances|archivedate=July 28, 2010|accessdate=July 28, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], Tabitha and Napoleon held a week-long fundraiser from online sales of their dancewear line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.intellicontact.com/p/nappytabs/newsletters/shoponline/posts/nappytabs-fundraiser-for-haiti|title=Nappytabs Fundraiser for Haiti|work=IntelliContact.com|date=January 23, 2010|accessdate=July 28, 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sJzuOPQ3?url=http://community.intellicontact.com/p/nappytabs/newsletters/shoponline/posts/nappytabs-fundraiser-for-haiti|archivedate=August 28, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money raised was donated to Artists for Peace and Justice who in turn gave 100% of their donations toward humanitarian relief efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artistsforpeaceandjustice.com/events.html|title=Support for APJ|work=ArtistsForPeaceAndJustice.com|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qybBFp18?url=http://artistsforpeaceandjustice.com/events.html|archivedate=July 4, 2010|accessdate=July 4, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a separate fundraiser, they donated Nappytabs merchandise for a silent auction held by the organization Art4Life to benefit the [[American Cancer Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pollstar.com/blogs/news/archive/2010/05/20/723896.aspx|title=Art4Life Strikes "Glee" Gold|date=May 20, 2010|work=Pollstar.com|accessdate=July 28, 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sJzuOPQC?url=http://www.pollstar.com/blogs/news/archive/2010/05/20/723896.aspx|archivedate=August 28, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, they taught classes at "The JabbaWockeez Experience" held at the Alexis Park Resort in Las Vegas. The event raised money for the Monsters on the Move Foundation which grants scholarships to aspiring dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monsters Teams Up with JabbaWockeez for Las Vegas Dance Event|url=http://www.dancestudiolife.com/2012/02/monsters-teams-up-with-jabbawockeez-for-las-vegas-dance-event|work=Dance Studio Life|accessdate=February 12, 2012|date=February 2, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/669aOHwPO?url=http://www.dancestudiolife.com/2012/02/monsters-teams-up-with-jabbawockeez-for-las-vegas-dance-event/|archivedate=March 14, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, they worked with the Jabbawockeez again on a music video to the song "Celebrate" by [[Empire of the Sun (band)|Empire of the Sun]] and [[Tommy Trash]]. The music video also featured [[Les Twins]], [[8 Flavahz]], and [[Harry Shum, Jr.]] and was used to raise money for a Coke [[(RED)]] campaign to decrease the number of HIV-infected newborns and raise awareness about AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date=October 31, 2013|title=Coca-Cola and (RED) Join Forces to Inspire People to Move for the Movement to Help Deliver an AIDS-Free Generation|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131031005895/en/Coca-Cola-RED-Join-Forces-Inspire-People-Move|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate=November 10, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110082146/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131031005895/en/Coca-Cola-RED-Join-Forces-Inspire-People-Move|archivedate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Veterans Day]] 2013, they choreographed a military themed performance for the Homeward Bound Telethon that aired live on the [[Military Channel]].

'''The State Hermitage Youth Education Center''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Молодёжный образовательный центр Государственного Эрмитажа), is a [[contemporary art]] education program in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]] that is part of [[Hermitage Museum|The Hermitage Museum]]. The program is offered for all students, whether from St. Petersburg, other Russian cities or from abroad. Activities include lectures on the history and theory of art, exhibitions of contemporary art,  [[Master class|masterclasses]], and access to Museum curators and collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/learn/youth-center/?lng=en Official website of The Youth Center]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also special semester programs for students studying from abroad. State Hermitage Youth Education Center organizes a number of international festivals and cultural programs on the history and traditions of different countries and nations. 

== History ==
The Youth Center was launched in 2000 when Mijaíl Borisovich Piotrovsk, Director of The Hermitage, signed the order for the creation of the Student Club which bears the same name as the museum. Since 2011, it has been located in located in the east wing of Saint Petersburg’s [[General Staff Building (Saint Petersburg)|General Staff Building]], and since its founding it’s been supervised by curator Sofía Vladimirovna Kudryavtseva.

== Educational and cultural programs ==

=== Thematic sections ===
At the core of the Student Club are thematic sections, which are managed by museum staff. Membership is open to students or graduates from universities in Saint Petersburg or from those in the [[Leningrad Region|Leningrad region]]. Which thematic section they decide to join depends exclusively on their particular inclinations and interests. All activities at the Youth Center begin on October 1 – the day on which Russia celebrates “student day” in the [[Hermitage Theatre]].

=== Educational Programs ===

==== Present Art ====
The "Present Art" program includes masterclasses and exhibitions of renowned artists, meetings with curators of international art projects, lectures about current issues in contemporary art, discussions and seminars. These programs invite the participation of representatives from specific departments of Russian universities ([[St. Petersburg State University]], [[Herzen University]], I. Repin St.Petersburg State Academy Institute of painting, sculpture and architecture, Saint Petersburg Stieglitz State Academy of Art and Design).

==== Project “Hermitage 20/21” ====
This educational program includes meetings with curators of exhibitions, conferences and masterclasses conducted by artists. Recent programs for the exhibitions:
* “[[Jake and Dinos Chapman]]: The end of fun” (in Russian: Конец веселья)
* "[[Anthony Gormley]]: In all the growth" (in Russian: Во весь рост)
* "[[Henry Moore]] in the Hermitage: Sculpture and drawing."
* "[[Annie Leibovitz]]: The life of a photographer: 1990-2005 "(Russian: Жизнь фотографа: 1990-2005).

==== Museum and small museologists ====
On February 1, 2013 The Youth Center launched a new and unique program, "Museum and small museologist", thanks to the initiative of St. Petersburg State University’s Philosophy Department and approved by Director of The Hermitage. This program is directed to students 9 to 11 years old and strives to show them how a contemporary art museum works and what its employees do. During the academic year, the students meet with principal figures of the museum - the director, restorers, curators, for example - and thereby learn about the real work of different departments of the museum.

==== Let's meet the Yamal! ====
This program was developed by the Youth Center in collaboration with the [[Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug|Yamalo-Nenets]] Fraternity – members of the Student Club - to teach about the colorful history of this indigenous people. The program includes an exhibition of applied art, workshops, masterclasses, folk concerts and documentary film screenings.

'''Universal preschool''' is an international movement to use public funding to ensure high quality [[preschool]] (pre-k) is available to all families.

==Publicly funded preschool in the US==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
Citing international and domestic research showing a benefit to children from low and middle income families both in the short and long term, the movement to advance publicly funded pre-k has resulted in the successful passage of pre-k enabling legislation in 44 states in the US. While some funding legislation for pre-k has been passed on the federal level, including the Race to the Top Early Learning Challenge Grant, much of the advocacy focuses on building broad support from diverse leaders in business, child activists, educators, philanthropists, law enforcement, and healthcare to lobby state legislatures.

States use public dollars to fund pre-k programs in a variety of settings, including public schools, private non-profit and for-profit centers, and in regulated home childcare. Typically states fund preschool for three-, four-, and five-year-old children who have missed a cut-off date for enrollment in kindergarten. The hours range from 10 hours per week in Vermont, to full day programs in other states. Funding mechanisms vary as well, with some state utilizing a state budget line item versus a local budget appropriation.

While variations in implementation are numerous, state-funded pre-k consistently offer programs on a voluntary basis for children and families, unlike compulsory [[elementary school|elementary]], which is mandated by law with exceptions to allow for [[homeschooling]] and [[alternative education]]. Variations include how states deal with the following pre-k implementation elements: 
*age of children eligible for the service of preschool (usually three-, four-, or five-year-olds, but sometimes only four-year-olds),
*wrap-around services, including whether special supports such as home visiting, and playgroups are provided to support children from at-risk families,
* full-day versus part-day pre-k, and whether programs should be offered year-round or only during the school year,
* role of parents in paying for part of their child's pre-k tuition,
* quality requirements for state-funded programs, including requirements for teacher education and preparation, class size, teacher to child ratios, and the use of evidence-based curriculum,
* whether universal state-funded programs should be provided in the existing diverse delivery system for early childhood programs (including Headstart, public schools, non-profit and for-profit centers, programs hosted by churches that are non-religious, or in home settings such as regulated family day care).

Supporters of publicly funded preschool for all children cite research that shows:
*Because the brain is developing rapidly during the early years, stimulation from high quality preschool can support the development of neurologic pathways that serve a child in lifelong learning, 
*Longitudinal studies (Abecedarian, Chicago Parent Child Centers, and the [[Perry Preschool Project]]) show significant longterm benefits for children who attend preschool, including improved health, social and behavioral outcomes, and well as higher income than the control group.
*Advocates for those in poverty cite research related to the achievement gap, where many at-risk children start out behind in school for a variety of reasons and never catch up. Pre-k programs help to eliminate this gap. 
*Business organizations cite the need for pre-k to improve school-readiness and literacy by age nine, in order to impact universal achievement of all children.
*The Information below was provided by: DLC | Model Initiatives | July 20, 2006
*Studies of high-quality preschool programs in North Carolina and Michigan have found that public investments in such programs could, in fact, deliver a 7-to-1 return in the long run, in the form of increased productivity and decreased social spending.
*A University of Georgia study found that the pre-k students improved their school readiness scores relative to national norms. It also found that the pre-k system eliminated the skills gap between universal pre-K students and the more affluent students whose parents sent them to private programs.
*A Georgetown University study found gains in the children's cognitive and language assessment scores from the Oklahoma pre-k program—particularly among African-American and Hispanic children, whose scores improved by an average of 17 percent and 54 percent, respectively. As of 2006, 98 percent of Oklahoma school districts offer pre-k programs, up 30 percent since 1998.

== Economic Advantages ==
Recent studies show that the benefits of universal preschool outweigh the costs.  A 2005 longitudinal study of 123 3 and 4-year-old black children conducted a cost-benefit analysis, reports that for every $1 invested in preschool education, there is a return on the investment of $12.90.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nores|first=M.|last2=Belfield|first2=C.|last3=Barnett|first3=W. S.|last4=Schweinhart|first4=L.|date=2005|title=Updating the economic impacts of the High/Scope Perry Preschool Program|url=|journal=Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis|volume=27(3)|pages=245-261|via=Ebsco}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Advantages of universal preschool for the child also include higher reading scores for low-income students.  According to research from Dartmouth College, universal preschool programs boost low-income children's reading scores more than targeted preschool programs (e.g., Head Start)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.  The study finds that the difference in reading scores is large enough to conclude that universal preschool is more productive than targeted preschool.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Cascio, E. (2017). ''Does universal preschool hit the target? Program access and preschool impacts.'' Unpublished manuscript, Department of Economics, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH. Retrieved from http://www.dartmouth.edu/~eucascio/cascio_prek_latest.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Other research supports the Dartmouth College study's findings.  Barnett and Frede's (2010) extensive research in early childhood education found that because students learn from each other, disadvantaged students learn more if their classmates are socioeconomically diverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnett|first=W. S.|last2=Frede|first2=E.|date=2010|title=The promise of preschool: Why we need early education for all.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=EJ889144|journal=American Educator|volume=34(1)|pages=21-29|via=Ebsco}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, a study out of Tulsa that compared Head Start and a state-funded (i.e., universal) preschool program found that the universal program is more effective in improving literacy outcomes and attentiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gormley|first=W. T.|last2=Newmark|first2=K.|last3=Welti|first3=K.|last4=Adelstein|first4=S.|date=2011|title=Social-emotional effects of early childhood programs in Tulsa.|url=|journal=Child Development|volume=82(6)|pages=2095-2109|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01648.x|via=Ebsco}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Policymaking Considerations ==
As the topic of universal preschool gains momentum in the United States, policymakers will be involved in designing preschool programs.  Many researchers are concerned that once state governments get involved, preschool programs will focus on academic skills rather than the comprehensive developmental needs of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Genishi|first=C.|last2=Dyson|first2=A.|date=2012|title=Racing to the top: Who's accounting for the children?|url=https://educate.bankstreet.edu/occasional-paper-series/vol2012/iss27/6|journal=Occasional Paper Series|volume=2012(27)|pages=|via=Ebsco}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lasser|first=J.|last2=Fite|first2=K.|date=2011|title=Universal preschool's promise: Success in early childhood and beyond.|url=|journal=Early Childhood Education|volume=39|pages=169-173|doi=10.1007/s10643-011-0449-x|via=Ebsco}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the rich diversity in schools, researchers caution against using a 'one-size fits all' policy for developing universal preschool programs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spencer|first=T.|date=2014|title=Preschool for all?

== History ==
*The universal preschool movement started in France with [[:fr:École maternelle|Ecoles Maternelles]] in 1834.
*Various other European countries adopted some form of universal preschool, including Sweden.
*The movement gained ground in the United States as research showed that the high cost of high quality pre-k was beyond the ability of parents to pay, while the benefits from longitudinal studies showed societal benefits such as decreased crime, improved health, and greater earning capacity of children in later years. 
*To date, various states have begun implementation of a Universal Preschool system including Georgia, Florida, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Illinois and others.  
*New Jersey's program came out of a court decision based on the poor quality of education in large parts of the state (''[[Abbott district|New Jersey Abbott versus Burke]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edlawcenter.org/cases/abbott-v-burke/abbott-history.html ''New Jersey Abbott versus Burke'']&lt;/ref&gt;). 
*Florida's Universal Preschool was established by constitutional amendment initiative approved by the voters that left much of the program to be implemented by the Governor and Legislature.  
*Georgia dedicated their lottery profits for preschool.
* On June 6, 2006, California voters defeated an initiative for part day preschool for all four-year-olds as a constitutional right. The initiative proposed to include a tax on those in very wealthy income brackets.  Those taxes were to be placed in a separate fund, and remain independent from the state budget. Text of the initiative can be found at ''California Preschool for All Act''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlyeducation.org/pfa1.pdf ''California Preschool for All Act'']&lt;/ref&gt; Film director and actor, [[Rob Reiner]], was a public advocate for the proposed program.
* Advocates formed the Los Angeles Universal Preschool (LAUP), an independent public benefit corporation created in 2004 and funded by [[First 5 LA]]. LAUP’s goal is to make voluntary, high-quality preschool available to every 4-year-old child in Los Angeles County, regardless of their family’s income, by 2014.  LAUP is guided by a 10-year Master Plan developed by hundreds of educators, parents, government officials, and business and community leaders. Building on this plan, LAUP is bringing resources together from across the county in support of early childhood education.  When LAUP has reached full scale, funded classrooms will serve more than 100,000 4-year-olds.
* The National Association for the Education of Young Children participated in a Governor's Forum on Quality Preschool held in December 2003. This organization stands on the principal that building on existing preschool providers and programs, including child care, Head Start and schools, will ensure a standard for high quality preschools.
*Illinois was the first state to offer voluntary preschool to all three- and four-year-olds whose parents want them to participate. Preschool for All was signed into law in July 2006, after a bill passed in the general assembly. When fully implemented, Preschool for All will ensure that 190,000 children in Illinois have access to high quality preschool. The legislature also approved $45 million in additional funding for the Early Childhood Block Grant to expand and enhance already established programs, and an 11% allotment of funds for birth- three children.
*Preschool for All programs are funded in a wide variety of child care and school settings. According to a 2005 study by the ''National Center for Education Statistics'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2006/2006075.pdf ''National Center for Education Statistics'']&lt;/ref&gt; children are more likely to attend a center-based care program located in its own building (38 percent) than a center-based care arrangement in any other location, including churches, synagogues and other places of worship (25 percent), public schools (17 percent), private schools (9 percent), community centers (3 percent), and any other facility (10 percent). Directors of faith-based preschools and child care centers have voiced concern that Preschool for All will close down their programs. The concern is that, while other not-for-profit centers and for-profit centers can apply for the Early Childhood Block Grant, faith-based programs might not qualify, because they include Bible stories, prayer and worship songs in their curriculum. This matter has been addressed in a number of states, such as ''Illinois'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isbe.state.il.us/earlychi/preschool/preschool_for_all.pdf ''Illinois Preschool for All'']&lt;/ref&gt; where faith-based programs are eligible for Preschool for All funding for the part of the day that does not include religious instruction. Since Preschool for All is funded for a half day program in most locations, religious schooling can occur at other times during the day, and additional funding streams can be used to subsidize child care at those other times.

==Opposition in the US==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
*Assessment of program outcomes has been difficult, largely due to the lack of data and newness of universal pre-k around the nation. Studies in the US have not fully demonstrated the long term benefit of pre-k to middle income children, although studies in Australia and New Zealand with comparable demographics have.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}
*Critics have charged that the costs of universal pre-k could rise. Since the term "universal" means access for all children, the cost varies in proportional to the expected contribution by parents in addition to state funding, the number of hours for which a state provide funding, and whether qualifying programs have enough slots for all children. 
*Since quality requirements stipulate certain standards, not all pre-k programs, especially those in private settings, are eligible. There remains a controversy about whether private providers will be driven out of business if local public schools offer full-day, tuition-free programs.
*Critics charge that where high quality publicly funded pre-k slots are limited, waiting lists can result in disadvantaged children competing with higher income children for preschool access. Some states provide an additional amount of tuition to help offset the special needs of at-risk children. 
*Although no state mandates participation in programs, and even though some states provide funding for home-based pre-k programs, some conservatives argue that the responsibility for care and learning before kindergarten belongs solely to parents. 
*In some states teachers unions are working with pre-k teachers to create early education unions, to allow for bargaining with state on pre-k reimbursements. At the same time, some teachers unions have opposed siting pre-k programs in private centers and homes, as a drain of public education resources and a potential open-door to school vouchers.
