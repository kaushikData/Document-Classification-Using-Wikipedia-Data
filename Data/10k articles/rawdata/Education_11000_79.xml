*Arizona School for the Deaf- Tucson Campus (ASD)
*Arizona School for the Blind-Tucson Campus (ASB)
*Regional Cooperatives: The regional cooperatives are voluntary partnerships between public education agencies (school districts and charter schools) across Arizona and ASDB. The Cooperative staff serve students and families throughout five regions of Arizona including: North Central, Eastern Highlands, Desert Valleys, Southwest and Southeast. School staff and the Cooperative staff work together in local schools to promote success for students who are deaf, blind, hearing impaired or visually impaired.
==History==
The first Arizona state legislature in 1912 enacted a provision forming the agency. Classes began in October 1912 with 19 deaf students on a converted residence on the campus of the [[University of Arizona]] in Tucson. The first principal was Henry C. White, appointed by Arizona's first governor, [[George W.P. Hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;Gannon, Jack. 1981.

May 2016, ASDB Board of Director announced Annette Reichman is next ASDB Superintendent and she is first Deaf and Visually Impaired Superintendent in ASDB's 104 year old history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3625">The '''Association of Advanced Rabbinical and Talmudic Schools''' ('''AARTS''') is a faith-based national [[school accreditation|accreditation]] association for [[Rabbinical]] and [[Talmudic]] schools. It is based in [[New York, NY]] and is recognized by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chea.org/Directories/faith.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66ixfHHc0?url=http://www.chea.org/Directories/faith.asp |archivedate=2012-04-06 |df= }} "Council for Higher Education Accreditation"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[United States Department of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg10.html "United States Department of Education"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of Rabbinical and Talmudic education the association sees itself as both a gatekeeper and a historical authority. They aim to hold traditional thought in a modern world through balance of the old and new.
==Operations==
AARTS is an independently run, non profit organization, made up of experts in the field of Rabbinical and Talmudic training, which set educational standards in the field throughout the country. Both undergraduate and graduate programs are evaluated by the association. All of these programs must meet set standards in education, finance and graduate requirements in order to be considered for accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Worldwide Synchronized Lecture|url=http://jliwinnipeg.blogspot.com/2009/01/save-date.html|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Hakhel' Gathering to Emphasize Jewish Unity|url=http://www.jlicentral.com/news.php?task=fullstory&amp;NID=125|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compared==
Since AARTS meets [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chea.org/Directories/faith.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66ixfHHc0?url=http://www.chea.org/Directories/faith.asp |archivedate=2012-04-06 |df= }} "Council for Higher Education Accreditation"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[United States Department of Education]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg10.html "United States Department of Education"&lt;/ref&gt; recognition criteria, AARTS standards correspond to those of regional accreditors.  AARTS  accreditation, however, does not guarantee regional accreditation and vice versa. Contrary to the principles laid out by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] in Transfer and the Public Interest: A Statement to the Community,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chea.org/pdf/transfer_state_02.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030030718/http://www.chea.org/pdf/transfer_state_02.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-30 |df= }} "Transfer and the Public Interest: A Statement to the Community"&lt;/ref&gt; many regionally accredited institutions continue to base transfer credit decisions solely or primarily upon regional accreditation.

'''Bahrain School''' is a [[United States Department of Defense]] school located in [[Juffair]], [[Manama]], [[Bahrain]].

== Overview ==
The school is operated by the [[Bahrain International School Association]] (BISA) with the [[United States]] [[Department of Defense Education Activity]] (DoDEA) and takes students from [[Kindergarten]] to [[Twelfth grade]]. Graduating seniors can earn an [[United States|American]] diploma or an International Baccalaureate diploma.

Bahrain School is the only DoDEA school in the [[Persian Gulf]] area. The closest DoDEA school to Bahrain School is George C. Marshall School in [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]]. It provides education primarily to the children of the United States Navy stationed in Bahrain, but historically, about half of the student body has been local enrollment, usually the dependents of diplomatic personnel and ARAMCO employees, as well as wealthy Bahraini citizens. The Navy dependent population declined in July 2004 when dependents were sent home due to security concerns.  In July 2009, dependents were again authorized to return to Bahrain. 

As of 2013, there were 435 total students enrolled in both the middle and high schools, with 69% of the students in grades 10 to 12. 57% of the students at the time were American citizens, with the remaining 43% representing approximately 68 countries. 

Also as of 2013, the middle and high school employed forty three teachers, seven supporting professionals, and seven support staff for a total of fifty-seven teachers and staff. Of those, eighteen were male and thirty nine were female.

==Accreditation==
Bahrain School is accredited by the [[North Central Association]] of Colleges and Schools to offer an American diploma.  The [[College Board]] authorizes Bahrain School to offer [[Advanced Placement]] courses: Calculus AB, Microeconomics, Chemistry, Physics, and Spanish.  In 1982, the school became the first in Bahrain to offer the [[International Baccalaureate Diploma]] under the accreditation of the [[International Baccalaureate Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibo.org/school/000205/ Bahrain School], [[International Baccalaureate Organization]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
Bahrain School has many of the sports that typical American schools have such as basketball, soccer, baseball, volleyball, track and field, and cross country. The school competes against other schools on the island. Since the school is a part of [[Department of Defense Dependents Schools|DoDDS Europe]], they also compete in the DODDS European championships.

==Notable alumni==
* HRH [[Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]], The Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Bahrain and the Deputy Supreme Commander of the [[Bahrain Defence Force]].
* HRH Isa bin Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Son of The Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Bahrain, 2nd in line to the throne.
* [[Brent Brandon]], Outstanding Graduate from the United States Air Force Academy, Two-year winner of the National John F. Kennedy Fellowship - Harvard University, Winner of the Gilroy Award for Leadership and Flying - USAF Electronic Warfare Officer School, Nominated for Silver Star and awarded Distinguished Flying Cross for Heroism in Aerial Combat in EF-111 aircraft on first wave attack in Desert Storm; Chairman of the Board - Boise Classical Academy

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5061">'''Botany 2000''' is the name for a scientific program, organized under the auspices of [[UNESCO]]. While a similar UNESCO program, [[ASOMPS]], focus on promotion of collaboration and co-operation between scientists in Asia, Botany 2000 is composed of activities in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. Activities in [[Europe]] are confined to support of herbaria in countries in transition and reconstruction e.g. [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

The Botany 2000 program was accepted by the UNESCO General Conference in 1989. 

Activities in Africa and Asia subsume activities in predecessor networks such as the: 

* Botany 2000-Asia
* Botany 2000-Africa

The Botany 2000-Asia program is the new name for the former ''Southeast Asian Cooperative Program on Descriptive Botany'' (SEABOP) and of the work being carried out by the majority of the other organizations involved in the ''Asian Coordinating Group for Chemistry'' (ACGC).

Botany 2000-Asia is implemented by UNESCO's New Delhi Office and focuses on the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and biological and cultural [[Biodiversity|diversity]] of medicinal and [[ornamental plants]], and their protection against [[environmental pollution]], as well as ethnobiological classification and biological [[systematics]] and the correct documentation of useful plants through collection of voucher specimens. Within the framework of the project Botany 2000-Asia, [[UNESCO]] supports also the computerization of holdings and locations in herbaria throughout Asia.

Under the Botany 2000-Asia program some conferences were held:

* Botany 2000-Asia: Herbarium Curation Workshop (15-20 October 1990, [[Point Walter]], Bicton, Western Australia)
* Botany 2000-Asia: Zingiberaceae Workshop (15-18 October 1991, Hat Yai, Thailand)
* Botany 2000-Asia: Rutaceae Workshop (2-7 February 1992, in conjunction with ASOMPS VII, Manila, Philippines)
* Botany 2000-Asia: International Botanical Congress (28 August-3 September 1993, Tokyo, Japan)
* Botany 2000-Asia: International Seminar and Workshop : taxonomy and phytochemistry of the Asclepiadaceae in tropical Asia (June 1994, Malacca, Malaysia) &lt;ref&gt; Proceedings were published as: R. Kiew (Ed.) 1994. The taxonomy and phytochemistry of the Asclepiadaceae in tropical Asia : proceedings of Botany 2000-Asia International Seminar and Workshop, Malacca, June 1994. Publ. by Herbarium, Department of Biology, Universiti Pertanian Malaysia, vi, 101 pp., ill. &lt;/ref&gt;
* Second Symposium on The Family Zingiberaceae (9-12 May 1995, Guangzhou, China) &lt;ref&gt; Proceedings were published as: Te-Lin Wu; Qi-Gen Wu; Z.-Y. Chen (Eds.) 1996. Proceedings of the Second Symposium on the Family Zingiberaceae. Publ. by Zhongshan University Press, Guangzhou - 510 275, People's Republic of China, v, 306 pp., ill., {{ISBN|7-306-01218-5}} &lt;/ref&gt;
* Botany 2000-Asia: Workshop on the Family Apocynaceae (6-8 February 1996, Chittagong, Bangladesh)
 
[[Neville Marchant]], Director of the [[Western Australian Herbarium]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], has been involved in the Botany 2000-Asia programme since its inception.

The UNESCO Office, New Delhi also published the ''Botany 2000-Asia Newsletter'' four times a year. A typical issue contains news on workshops, training courses, databases, projects and forthcoming meetings as well as reports on unauthorized collection and export of medicinal plants from the region. The editor requests one to two page articles and reports of seminars and meetings of general relevance to [[botany]] and [[ethnobotany]] in Asia. Apart from producing the newsletter, the UNESCO Botany 2000-Asia program sponsors occasional workshops on the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[ethnobotany]] and [[Phytochemistry |chemistry]] of various plant families, as well as training courses in herbarium techniques and curation.  

Botany 2000-Africa is implemented by UNESCO's Nairobi Office and deals with the conservation and use of the medicinal flora of Africa.

Some of the activities of the Botany 2000-Africa program are published in: S. Edwards and Z. Asfaw (Editors): ''The Status of Some Plant Resources in Parts of Tropical Africa''. Botany 2000: East and Central Africa; NAPRECA Monograph Series No. 2. Published by ''Natural Products Research Network for Eastern and Central Africa'' (NAPRECA), Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, 1992.

The UNESCO ''Botany 2000'' program is different from the annual meeting of the ''Botanical Society of America'' (BSA), who organised an annual scientific conference named ''Botany''. This ''Botany 2000 : New Frontiers in Botany'' conference was held in Portland, Oregon on 6-10 August 2000.

'''Carmela Mackenna Subercaseaux''' (1879–1962) was a [[Chile]]an pianist and composer. Born in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]], to Alberto Mackenna Astorga and Carmela Subercaseaux, she was the great-granddaughter of Chilean hero [[Juan Mackenna]] and aunt of composer [[Alfonso Leng]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-92942.html|title=Carmela Mackenna Subercaseaux (1879-1962)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genealog.cl/Chile/M/Mackenna/|title=GENEALOGIA DE LA FAMILIA MACKENNA}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied music theory with [[Bindo Paoli]] in Santiago and continued her studies in piano and composition with [[Conrad Ansorge]] and [[Hans Mersmann]] in [[Berlin]]. 
in 1934 she made her debut as a composer in Berlin with ''Concerto for Piano and Orchestra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Music of Latin America|author=Slonimesky, Nicolas|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Accounting}}
'''Chartered accountants''' were the first [[accountant]]s to form a [[professional accounting body]], initially established in Scotland in 1854. The Edinburgh Society of Accountants (1854), the Glasgow Institute of Accountants and Actuaries (1854) and the Aberdeen Society of Accountants (1867) were each granted a royal charter almost from their inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perks|first=R.W.|title=Accounting and Society|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall |location=London|year=1993|pages=16|isbn=0-412-47330-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title is an internationally recognised professional designation; the  [[certified public accountant]] designation is generally equivalent to it. 

Chartered accountants work in all fields of business and finance, including auditing, taxation, financial and general management. Some are engaged in public practice work, others work in the private sector and some are employed by government bodies.&lt;ref name="icas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icas.org.uk/site/cms/contentCategoryView.asp?category=4365|title=Life as a CA has many advantages|publisher=ICA Scotland|accessdate=2011-10-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927135524/http://www.icas.org.uk/site/cms/contentCategoryView.asp?category=4365|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charteredaccountants.ie/General/About-Us/Chartered-Accountancy/Becoming-a-Chartered-Accountant/Why-Chartered-Accountancy/ |title=Why Chartered Accountancy? |publisher=CA Ireland |accessdate=2011-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charteredaccountants.com.au/Chartered-Accountants/What-is-a-Chartered-Accountant/Where-do-Chartered-Accountants-work.aspx |title=Where do Chartered Accountants work?|publisher=ICA Australia |accessdate=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chartered accountants' institutes require members to undertake a minimum level of continuing professional development to stay professionally competitive. 
They facilitate special interest groups (for instance, entertainment and media, or insolvency and restructuring) which lead in their fields. They provide support to members by offering advisory services, technical helplines and technical libraries. They also offer opportunities for professional networking, career and business development.&lt;ref name="icaew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icaew.com/en/join-us/why-join-icaew |title=Benefits of joining the ICAEW |accessdate=2011-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries==

=== Australia ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Accountant]] --&gt;
Chartered accountants of Australia belong to the [[Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand|Chartered Accountants Australia &amp; New Zealand]] (CA ANZ, formerly the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia]]) and use the designatory letters ''CA''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About membership and inclusions|url=http://www.charteredaccountants.com.au/Members/Membership/About-membership-and-inclusions.aspx|publisher=ICAA|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some senior members (at least 15 years' membership) of the institute may be elected fellows and use the letters ''FCA''. Of equal legal status and recognition in Australia as qualified professional accountants are [[Institute of Public Accountants]] (IPA) and [[CPA Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advancement to Fellowship|url=http://www.charteredaccountants.com.au/Members/Membership/Advancement-to-fellowship.aspx|publisher=ICAA|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 June 2016, the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA) and CA ANZ announced a strategic alliance to provide an opportunity for dual membership of both bodies, which will add value for the members locally and globally. ACCA members resident in Australia and New Zealand will be invited to apply for CA membership and CA ANZ members will be invited to apply for ACCA membership, subject to meeting the eligibility criteria of the other body.

===Bangladesh===
The [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh]] (ICAB) is the national professional accounting body of Bangladesh. Established in 1973, it is the sole organization with the right to award the Chartered Accountant designation in Bangladesh. Senior members (at least five years' membership) of the institute are called "fellow members" and use the letters ''FCA''.

Bangladesh has more than 1,900 registered Chartered Accountants and more than 28,000 articled students.

===Bermuda===
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bermuda works with the [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants]] and [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]], and is the sole organisation in [[Bermuda]] with the right to award the Chartered Accountant designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icab.bm/|title=Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bermuda|author=|date=|website=icab.bm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
In Canada, chartered accountants belong to the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) by way of membership in at least one provincial or territorial institute (or "order" in [[Quebec]]). In order to become a member, a candidate requires an undergraduate degree plus experience and, depending on the province, additional education. Candidates in all provinces are required to pass the three-day [[Uniform Evaluation]] (UFE) now Common Final Examination (CFE).

Since 2012, the CICA has been in a process of unification with the other two accounting bodies in Canada. Canadian CA's, along with [[Certified General Accountant]]s (CGAs) and [[Certified Management Accountant]]s (CMAs), have now adopted the designation [[Chartered Professional Accountant]] (CPA), making the term "chartered accountant" obsolete.

=== Czech Republic ===
In the Czech Republic, Chartered Accountants are generally members of Institute of Chartered Accountants of the Czech Republic and use the designatory letters ''CAE'' (Chartered Accountant expert).{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Chartered Accountants may also be members of the Chamber of Auditors of the Czech Republic (KACR),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Chamber of Auditors of the Czech Republic |url=https://www.kacr.cz/en/ |accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom the [[ICAEW]] launched its ACA qualification in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ACA training in the Czech Republic |url=https://careers.icaew.com/find-your-route/aca-training-in-the-czech-republic |publisher=ICAEW |accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===
Under the [[European professional qualification directives|Mutual Recognition Directive]], [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) and Swiss nationals holding a professional qualification can become members of the equivalent bodies in another member state.
They must, however, pass an aptitude test in understanding local conditions (which for accountants will include local tax and company law variations).

The local title is, however, not available for use if the professional does not choose to join the local professional body. For example, a holder of the French ''[[:fr:Ordre des experts-comptables|expert-comptable]]''&amp;nbsp;{{fr icon}} qualification could practise as an accountant in England without taking a local test but could only describe him or herself as "expert-comptable (France)" not "Chartered Accountant".  Within the EEA, only the UK and Ireland have bodies that issue the Chartered Accountant title.

===India===
In India, Chartered Accountants are regulated by the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of India]] (ICAI) which was established by the [[Chartered Accountants Act, 1949]]. 
Associate members of the ICAI are entitled to add the prefix ''CA'' to their names. Members who are in full-time practice, and have completed five years of practice, can use ''FCA''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icai.org/new_post.html?post_id=4825|title=ICAI - The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India|author=|date=|website=ICAI}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017|4}}, the ICAI had nearly 270,000 registered members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key statistics|url=https://www.icai.org/new_category.html?c_id=205|publisher=ICAI|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entry to the profession can be made by taking the [[CA Foundation Course]] after completion of schooling (12th grade). Alternatively, graduates may train as an articled assistant for three years in a chartered firm before taking the Intermediate and then final exam.
A comprehensive 100 hours of information technology training and an orientation programme for soft skills development have to be completed before being articled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icai.org/new_post.html?post_id=283|title=www.icai.org|last=|first=|date=|website=Institute of Chartered Accountants of India|publisher=|access-date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===
In Ireland, Chartered Accountants are generally members of [[Chartered Accountants Ireland]] and use the designatory letters ACA or FCA. Chartered accountants may also be members of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] or the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland]].

=== Nepal ===
In Nepal, the profession of Chartered Accountancy is regulated by the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal]] (ICAN) which was established by parliament under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1997.

After completion of three levels of examination (CAP I, CAP II, and CAP III) with three years of articleship training under a qualified CA, one can get the membership of ICAN and with the Certificate of Practice (COP), one can practise as a professional accountant.

=== New Zealand ===
In [[New Zealand]], Chartered Accountants belong to the [[Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand|Chartered Accountants Australia &amp; New Zealand]] (CA ANZ, formerly [[New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants]]) and use the designatory letters CA. Some senior members may be elected fellows and use the letters FCA.

There is also a mid-tier qualification called Associate Chartered Accountant with the designatory letters ACA. Associate chartered accountants are not eligible to hold a certificate of public practice and therefore cannot offer services to the public.

=== Pakistan ===
The [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan]] (ICAP) is the professional body of Chartered Accountants in Pakistan, established on 1&amp;nbsp;July 1961 under the Chartered Accountants Ordinance, 1961. ICAP is the sole body and authority in Pakistan which has a mandate to regulate the accounting and auditing profession in the country. It adopts and develops the national auditing standards and develops accounting standards for the [[Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan]] (SECP). It represents accountants employed in public practice, business and industry, and the public sector. The Institute is a member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC), which is the global organization for the accountancy profession.

ICAP has more than 7,000 active members and more than 25,000 students.

=== Singapore ===
The [[Chartered Accountant of Singapore]] (CA (Singapore)) title is protected under the [[Singapore Accountancy Commission]] (SAC) Act. The pathway to obtain the designation is owned by the SAC, a statutory body of the government. The Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA) is a designated entity in the SAC Act and confers the CA (Singapore) designation on behalf of SAC. The Singapore Chartered Accountant Qualification programme has three components: academic base, professional programme and 3 years of practical experience. ISCA and the SAC have worked to raise the profile and promote the Singapore CA Qualification for international recognition.

Applicants who are eligible for the Singapore Chartered Accountant Qualification foundation programme should have either accredited degrees, other degrees, undergraduates and local polytechnic diplomas. Those with who are eligible for direct entry into the professional programme should have local accountancy degrees from [[Nanyang Technological University]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[Singapore Management University]], [[Singapore University of Social Sciences]], and [[Singapore Institute of Technology]]. 

In 2013, holders of [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA) and [[CPA Australia]] have until 31 December 2016 and existing students have until 31 December 2018 to complete the ICPAS PAC and qualify for the "Chartered Accountant of Singapore" professional designation through the previous transitional arrangements.&lt;ref name="AsiaOne article 1"&gt;[http://business.asiaone.com/investments-and-savings/mof-announces-details-new-professional-accountancy-designation MOF Announces Details of New Professional Accountancy Designation (2 April 2013)] ''AsiaOne''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BT article 2"&gt;[http://www.asiaone.com/print/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Business/Story/A1Story20130402-413059.html Singapore Prepares for a 2-tier Accounting Profession (4 April 2013)] ''The Business Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AsiaOne article 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BT article 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singaporeqp.com/singapore-qp-framework Singapore QP Framework] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309015635/http://singaporeqp.com/singapore-qp-framework |date=2013-03-09 }} ''Singapore Qualification Programme''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, SAICA ([[South African Institute of Chartered Accountants]]) regulates the Chartered Accountant (South Africa) designation, CA (SA).

To qualify as a CA (SA), one requires a [[Bachelor of Accountancy|specialised bachelor's degree in accounting]], followed by a Certificate in the Theory of Accounting (CTA); depending on the university, this is offered as a [[Bachelor's degree#Southern Africa|postgraduate honours degree]] or as a [[postgraduate diploma]]. This formal education is followed by two external competency exams set by SAICA.

A separate registration is needed for Chartered Accountants wishing to act as auditors in public practice as a registered auditor (RA). The RA designation is conferred by IRBA (Independent Regulatory Board For Auditors, previously known as Public Accountants and Auditors Board [PAAB]) under the Auditing Profession Act (AP Act).&lt;ref&gt;Auditing Profession Act s37(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates must complete three years of practical experience, working for a registered training office – the Training In Public Practice (TIPP) programme. Articled clerks who switch employers during this period are required to extend their training by six months. The Training Outside Public Practice (TOPP) programme has a [[Corporate finance|financial management]] focus; TOPP trainees can thus become Chartered Accountants with a more limited knowledge and experience of auditing than those who undergo the TIPP programme, but with a more extensive financial management and business experience.

Chartered accountants who are not registered auditors may not act as or hold out to be auditors in public practice.&lt;ref&gt;Auditing Profession Act s41(a)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the AP Act does not prohibit non-RAs from using the description 'internal auditor' or 'accountant', or from auditing a not-for-profit club, institution or association if they receive no fee for such audit.&lt;ref&gt;Auditing Profession Act s41(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Africa the Companies Act was replaced, with effect in July 2010, to allow companies without a public interest to choose between an audit or an independent review. A review is not an attest function and will be performed by accountants who are members of bodies that are registered in terms of the Close Corporations Act of 1984, which include SAIBA, CIMA, SAICA, SAIPA and ACCA.

=== Sri Lanka ===
In [[Sri Lanka]], the title of Chartered Accountant (CA Sri Lanka) can be used by only members of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka]]. These could be Associate Members (ACA) and Fellows (FCA). Chartered accountants holding practising certificates may also become Registered Auditors, who are able to perform statutory [[financial audit]]s in accordance with the Companies Act, No. 07 of 2007. Chartered Accountants can also register as [[company secretaries]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5913">'''"Chicken Fat"''' (also known as '''"The Youth Fitness Song"''') is a 1962 song written by [[Broadway Musicals|Broadway]] composer [[Meredith Willson]] (''[[The Music Man]]'', ''[[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (musical)|The Unsinkable Molly Brown]]'') and performed by actor/singer [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]].  It was commissioned as part of the [[President's Council on Physical Fitness]].&lt;ref name=Riis&gt;{{cite news|last1=Riis|first1=Richard|title=Apple's "Chicken Fat" Ad Harks Back to a Political Era Long Gone|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/06/09/1305530/-Apple-s-Chicken-Fat-Ads-Hark-Back-to-a-Political-Era-Long-Gone|accessdate=19 June 2014|publisher=[[Daily Kos]]|date=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
"Chicken Fat" was the theme song for President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s youth fitness program, and millions of 7-inch 33 RPM discs which were pressed for free by [[Capitol Records]] were heard in [[elementary school|elementary]] and [[junior high school]] gymnasiums across the United States throughout the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=JFKPE&gt;{{cite web| title= The Federal Government Takes on Physical Fitness | publisher= John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum | url= http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-in-History/Physical-Fitness.aspx?p=2 | page=2 |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willson contacted Fitness Council administrator [[Dick Snider]] with an offer to write a song to be used to promote exercise for children.  Willson's offer was accepted and he consulted with Physical Fitness Council director Ted Forbes to ensure that the song would be effective.&lt;ref name=Riis/&gt; The bouncy chorus ended with the words "Go, you chicken fat, go!"&lt;ref name=Riis/&gt;&lt;ref name=JFKPE/&gt;

The song was originally recorded on a [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] soundstage in early 1962 at the same time as the  recordings for the film soundtrack of the Warner Bros. film [[The Music Man (1962 film)|''The Music Man'']], starring [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]].  Recorded on the same three-track 35MM magnetic film as the soundtrack recordings, it features Preston's vocal isolated on one track, with the Bernie Green  Orchestra isolated on the second track and a chorus of boys and girls isolated on the third track. However, the location of the original multi-track tapes is unknown. As a result, with only the full-track quarter-inch 15 IPS monophonic composite master being available from which Capitol mastered their records in 1962, no [[stereophonic]] version of the song is currently possible and it remains in monophonic sound on the CD re-issue.&lt;ref name=JFKPE/&gt;

Two versions of the song exist: a 2:12 minute, radio-friendly length, “Disc Jockey Version"; and a longer, 6:30 “School Version”, for use in educational institution [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]].&lt;ref name=Riis/&gt;&lt;ref name=JFKPE /&gt; The latter included 11 floor exercises for school children designed by [[Bud Wilkinson]], the head coach of the [[University of Oklahoma]] football team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/06/13/chicken_fat_song_apple_iphone_5s_commercial_uses_kennedy_era_exercise_anthem.html|title=The Strange 1960s Gym-Class Anthem in Apple's New iPhone Commercial|first=Ben|last=Yagoda|authorlink=Ben Yagoda|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=13 June 2014|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willson, Preston, and Forbes all donated their services to the project , while Capitol Records, which produced and distributed three million copies of the 33 1/3 RPM record, paid for the backup musicians, studio time, and production and distribution.&lt;ref name=Riis/&gt; The original Physical Fitness Council was promoted in 1962 and 1963 through a series of public service TV commercials featuring baseball great [[Stan Musial]], filmed at [[Roosevelt Elementary School (Tampa, Florida)|Roosevelt Elementary School]] in Tampa, Florida.  

In 2014, "Chicken Fat" was used in a TV commercial by [[Apple Inc.]] to promote its new [[iOS 8]] [[Health (Apple)|health]] application. The commercial shows people swimming, running, and checking their weight while connected to iPhone apps and accessories to a recording of "Chicken Fat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-wants-you-to-get-rid-of-chicken-fat-using-its-iphone/|title=Apple wants you to get rid of 'chicken fat' using its iPhone|first=Shara |last=Tibken|date=4 June 2014|accessdate=23 June 2014|work=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/5/5781770/apple-iphone-ad-strength-fitness-with-wearables-and-apps|title=New Apple ad urges you to shed that 'chicken fat'|first=Rick|last=McCormick|date=5 June 2014|accessdate=23 June 2014|work=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported to be a 2000 recording by [[Bernie Knee]], a jingle writer and part-time cantor, which was released by [[Kimbo Educational Music]],&lt;ref name=Riis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://detroitkidshow.com/chicken_fat.htm|title=Poultry in Motion|publisher=Detroit Kid Show|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he died in 1994.&lt;ref name=MTV&gt;{{cite web|title=Bernie Knee Bio|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/bernie-knee/biography/|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately, it was reported that it was a new recording but that Apple would not name the singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elliott|first1=Stuart|title=Q. and A.

'''The Children's Civilization and Creativity Center''' is a children's museum in Heliopolis, Cairo, Egypt, was established in 1986. It was renovated twice in 1996 and in 2012. It is a large museum and cultural center covering 4,000 square meters in a 14 [[Feddan]], 14.3 acre landscape. It was built by the Heliopolis Society for the benefit of all the children of Egypt. This work involved contributions from Egyptian and international museums and institutions.

The museum was designed by experts from Egypt, UK and the USA and built by museum specialists from all over the world who have contributed to the museum to assist children and young adults to learn through hands on exhibits, inter-actives, computer games, and a spectacular dome show exhibit that takes the visitor through the history of science in Egypt.

In May 2012 it won the UK's Museum and Heritage International Award.

==Exterior==
The entrance to the museum is from Sharia Abo Bakr El Seddik, opposite the tram station at Haroun El Rashid. The entrance is marked by the spectacular Space Pyramidion structure of planet spheres circling a pyramid that celebrates the cultures of Egypt ancient and modern. The visit to the museum begins with a journey down the Nile valley through time and space, it provides a living experience of how the Nile has changed and formed the landscape of modern Egypt. The journey begins at the fountain symbolic of the source of the Nile in Nubia, the rocks are carved with the dinosaurs and basilosaurus that once lived and swam where modern Egypt is today. Their descendents the Hippo and the Crocodile, greet the visitors, as the journey continues down the Nile path into the early period of the Niles settlement by man, when the river banks were still humid jungle and elephants still wandered beside the Nile. Next the path leads onto the beginning of the drying out of the Nile Valley, savannah formed on either bank, and Lion, giraffe and gazelles appear along the river bank. Continuing, the Nile path reaches the Pharaonic period, the surrounding landscape becomes desert, an oasis forms a small side garden with a desert encampment, while along the Nile, an Egyptian garden with 'T' Basins filled with Lotus and Papyrus celebrates the diverse species cultivated. The path leads on past the medieval Nile village to the modern landscape of Heliopolis where the new Museum building and the cinema is situated. Finally, on passing the Museum the path finally leads to the Delta landscape, with the Alexandria seaside resort, and a covered Roman theatre for outdoor performances. The landscape path passes through a shady garden of mature trees, and both calms and stimulates the imagination of the visitor in anticipation for entering the new learning areas of the museum. The garden has a living displays, of birds, butterflies and fishes, and an outdoor excavation area. A large cafeteria allows for the schools, family groups and visitors to refresh themselves and so stay for the whole day. Outdoor classroom spaces provide for creativity and musical activities, while the Cinema provides a 3D learning films, and conference facilities, as well as book shop and learning materials supplies for the schools.

==Interior==
The Interior exhibition is divided into four, each on a separate floor connected by the central spiral staircase - the Time Stair - that provides a path from the roof to the basement.
The four themes are;

'''Where am I from?''' - explore the archaeology and history of Egypt, explores the pyramids, visits Tutankamen's tomb, and trains the visitor in mummy examination, modern excavation and underwater exploration in Alexandria

'''Who am I?''' - discover the development of Egyptian civilisation along the Nile divided into the three seasons of flood, sowing and harvest.

'''Why is Egypt like it is today?''' - examine the development of modern Egypt, in a panorama of Egyptian landscapes and their environmental issues, and how modern citizens can contribute today.

'''What is the future of Egypt?''' - Looks at the history of science in Egypt, through both a static hands on exhibition that looks at stars, ships, astrolabes, telescopes, airplanes and space travel, and also an immersive 4D experience dome show, in which the pioneers of Egypt appear to tell the history of science and encourage visitors to participate in the future.

The museum is open every day except Friday from 9 - 2.

The '''Inter-University Centre for Research on the Sociology of Law, Information and Legal Institutions''' ('''CIRSDIG''') is a network created in 1988 by the [[University of Messina|Universities of Messina]] and [[University of Macerata|Macerata]] in [[Italy]].

==Aims==
The Center aims: 
# to develop research activities in the sociology of law and studies on legal institutions, with particular focus on the aspects of communication and information law;
# to implement [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] courses, awards, and scholarships (CIRSDIG is, in fact, one of the promoting institutions of the Ph.D. courses on "Analysis and Theory of Political Institutions, Social and Communicative Changes" at the [[University of Messina]], "Sociology of Legal and Political Institutions and Analysis of Administrative processes" and "Theory of Information and Communication" at the [[University of Macerata]]);
# to promote the exchange of information among scholars in a framework of cooperation with public and private institutions;
# to stimulate interdisciplinary approaches.

==Projects==
Over the years, CIRSDIG has realized a number of scientific research projects, published a series of working papers,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cirsdig.it/indexeng.html&lt;/ref&gt; and organized several events. Specifically, the Centre has studied law and communicative processes by means of empirical research conducted by Italian and foreign scholars. In addition to the research activities in the field of law and legal communication, the Centre has developed studies on journalism and communication. Among the others, the Center has studied the “journalistic construction of electoral campaigns”, deviance, youth, and immigration. Recently, the Centre has produced a research in the field of education, "The Normative Impact of the Legislation on Schooling and Education in Calabria", financed by the Local Government of [[Calabria]].

The quality of the working papers published by the Center is remarkable, peer-reviewed, and freely distributed. These studies address a vast number of topics (media, crime, legal change, family, etc.) and represent an interesting experience in the landscape of the Italian research and publishing market. By using the flexibility of the Internet, and thanks to the support of an international-based community of scholars, these working papers present a relevant scientific quality and have a cost equal to zero.

==Other roles==
Apart from the research activities, CIRSDIG organizes seminars, conferences, and other similar events. In May 2001, an international conference on the new communicative and social codes was held at the University of Messina. Participants included [[Michel Maffesoli]], Eric Landowski, Oscar Correas, and Roque Carrion-Wam, among others. Presented papers were later published in two books. Another important event organized by the Center is the conference on ''Youth, Values and Liquid Society'', held in Messina in 2004,  with participants coming from various Italian universities: Mario Morcellini, Valerio Pocar, Antonio La Spina, and Domenico Carzo.

CIRSDIG plays an important role in the local academic and civic communities, particularly by involving public opinion in a successful attempt to raise issues and to discuss about phenomena that had not been carefully observed by the cultural and scientific worlds. In 2006, for example, an important research project was carried out on the subject of [[usury]] and [[organized crime]] in the city of Messina – a study that raised the interest of the national press. Today, the Centre covers a larger spectrum of interests and is focused principally on "social change" in the Southern Italian society. To do so, new studies on New Media, multiculturalism, and social protections have been promoted.

In May 2006, CIRSDIG began a new empirical study on "Cultural Consumption and Social Imaginaries: Gender Perspectives", which is still in progress.

Cordell Cleare is an activist and advocate.  In 2017 she ran for City Council to represent the 9th district. She currently is Democratic District Leader for the 70th Assembly District, Part A.  She also co-founded the Michelle Obama Community Democratic Club which is located in Central Harlem.

She has fought for environmental and social justice, tenants' rights and better educational opportunities and resources for public school students.  The recipient of the 1997 Brooke Russell Astor Award for advocacy and work to prevent childhood lead poisoning, Cordell chaired the New York City Coalition to End Lead Poisoning (NYCCELP) for over 1 years.  NYCCELP is the grassroots organization that lead the fight to bring about the most comprehensive childhood lead poisoning prevention law in the nation (Local Law 1 of 2004). 

Cordell served as staff to former City Councilman and Deputy Majority Leader Bill Perkins where she advocated for individuals as well as the community on a wide range of issues. Her work in that office was effective and often brought positive results; from getting public benefits restored to preventing illegal evictions and uncovering national scandals. She worked extensively with former City Councilman Perkins on a variety of critical community and legislative matters including black male unemployment, land use &amp; historic preservation, infant mortality, justice for the Central Park 5 and of course lead poisoning prevention to name a few.

She was elected to Community School Board District 3 and served from 1999 – 2004. After the mayoral dismantling of school boards and Community District Education Councils were formed in 2004 she was elected by parents to the District 3 Community Education Council in 2004 and again in 2005. As an education advocate she has supported the Campaign for Fiscal Equity efforts and joined the fight for badly needed resources, funding, and technology and capital improvements, particularly in the most underserved and lowest performing schools in the district. Parent empowerment and involvement, qualified teachers and reforms to policies and practices that result in major inequities between schools in and/or students from certain neighborhoods and socio-economic backgrounds are among the many issues Cordell fought for. She served as Perkins’ Chief of Staff in the State Senate, where she continued to work on important issues affecting the community.

As the female Democratic District Leader in the 68th Assembly District in Harlem (2007 – 2015) Cordell organized and participated in many efforts to build and improve the community and encourage participation in the political process. Through the Sojourner Truth Democratic Club, she supported and worked successfully to get numerous Democratic candidates on the ballot and elected to federal, state, city and party positions. After the 2010 Census and the redistricting that followed in 2012 Cordell was drawn into a new district (70th Assembly District) where she ran for and successfully won the vacant seat in 2015 and was re-elected to the position in 2017.  

In 2007 she served as Coordinator of “CD 15 for Obama” and led petitioning efforts to get Barack Obama on the ballot in the 15th congressional district in New York, gathering the second highest number of signatures for his Presidential race
than any other congressional district on the East Coast. Cordell also sat as an Obama delegate in the historic 2008 National Democratic Convention in Denver, Colorado.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31700">The '''Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems''' (EOLSS) is an [[encyclopedia]] on the science of [[sustainable development]] and conservation of [[life support system]]s on [[earth]]. The extensive publication is published under the patronage of [[UNESCO]].

==Overview==
In 1996, international [[scientists]], [[engineers]], and policy makers were invited by the UNESCO to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], [[Tokyo]], [[Moscow]], [[Mexico City]], [[Beijing]] and the [[Bahamas]] to generate a detailed list of EOLSS contents and achieve a global consensus and acceptance of its structure. Life support system means a natural or human constructed system that furthers the life of the [[biosphere]] in a sustainable fashion. The knowledge is structured in 21 topic areas: [[Earth science|Earth]] and [[atmospheric sciences]]; [[Mathematical sciences]]; [[Biological]], [[physiological]] and [[health sciences]]; [[Biotechnology]]; [[Land use]], [[land cover]] and [[soil sciences]]; [[Tropical]] biology and conservation management; [[Social sciences]] and [[humanities]]; [[Physical sciences]], engineering and technology resources; [[Control systems]], [[robotics]] and [[automation]]; [[Chemical sciences]] engineering and technology resources; [[Water Science|Water sciences]], engineering and technology resources; [[Energy|Energy sciences]], engineering and technology resources; Environmental and [[ecological |ecological sciences]], engineering and technology resources; Food and agricultural sciences, engineering and technology resources; [[Human resources]] policy, development and management; [[Natural resources]] policy and management; Development and economic sciences; Institutional and infrastructural resources; Technology, information and system management resources; Area studies (Africa, Brazil, Canada and USA, China, Europe, Japan, Russia); [[Desalination]] and water resources.

The way the encyclopedia is being compiled can be defined as [[crowdsourcing]], where thousands of intellectuals from all over the world and across various academic institutions are contributing. The encyclopedia relies on strict standards of [[peer review]] and the joint [[Paris]]-based UNESCO and EOLSS secretariat manages the encyclopedia in progress. It has got a publishing wing in [[Oxford]] as well which specializes in publishing various materials such as [[book]]s, [[e-books]] or scholarly [[subscription]]s.

The web portal of EOLSS receives maximum hits from the [[United States]] and [[India]]. If each hit is assumed to originate from one unique user, then USA has about 28% and India has about 10% of the users of this portal. The number of hits falls dramatically after we consider USA and India, whereas countries like [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and the [[United Kingdom]] each contribute almost about 5% of the total hits. This shows that people familiar with English are feeling more comfortable in utilizing this project for their educational or knowledge seeking purposes and researches. The proportion of users from states of the [[European Union]] who do not speak English as native language is about 8 percent in total. The statistics are updated as of May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eolss.net EOLSS, official website], retrieved on 2004-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14Av0Yq6cVk EOLSS], Introduction on [[YouTube]], retrieved on 2018-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Engineering Drawing''''' by Thomas Ewing French (1871-1944), Mech. Eng., [[Ohio State University|OSU]] 1895, also known as ''A Manual of Engineering Drawing for Students and Draftsman,'' was first published in 1911 by [[S&amp;P Global|McGraw-Hill Book Company]]. It appeared in fourteen editions and was last published in 1993. The title and author remained the same through the first six editions. French died during the publication years of the Sixth Edition, so the Seventh Edition was revised by his colleague at [[Ohio State University]], Charles J. Vierck. The Eighth through Tenth editions had the same title and were also authored by Charles J. Vierck. For the Eleventh and Twelfth editions, the book title changed to ''Engineering Drawing and Graphic Technology''. Following the death of Vierck in 1980, the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Editions were additionally authored by Robert J. Foster, [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State University]].

In North America, this textbook was widely used for education of [[drafter]]s, [[engineer]]s, and [[architect]]s. 

== History ==
It was during the year 1910 that Martin M. Foss, a traveling representative of the newly organized [[S&amp;P Global|McGraw-Hill Book Company]], in calling on the Department of Engineering Drawing, recognized in the group headed by Professor Thomas E. French one of the most successful and talented groups in its field in the United States. He said to Professor French: "We want a new mechanical drawing text. " "There are already fifty drawing books on the market" protested French. "But which is standard?" countered Foss. "We want a text that will be widely accepted as the standard work on the subject." Professor French accepted the challenge. Discarding the time-worn name "Mechanical Drawing" he coined a new title and wrote a text, "''A Manual of Engineering Drawing for Students and Draftsmen''", which was published in 1911. He was ably assisted by Assistant Professor Robert Meiklejohn, Instructors Owen E. Williams, Arthur C. Harper, Cree Sheets, Frederick W. Ives, William D. Turnbull and William J. Norris, which were the entire teaching staff of the department. The staff contributed immeasurably in the preparation of drawings, problem material as well as advice and suggestions in the text. This pioneering book (now in its 10th edition) made publishing history. It was a truly monumental classic, and for many years was a perennial leader in its field and held the American publishers record as the best selling of all college textbooks. This text is attributed to giving great impetus to the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, as well as helping Martin Foss, who later became President of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History, Department of Engineering Graphics, 1870 - 1970|last=Paffenbarger|first=Ralph S.|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an author of textbooks, Professor French is perhaps unequalled by anyone else in his field in the world. The following quotation is taken from the Ohio State University Monthly, February 1935, p. 148: "Not only is he famous as the [[Ohio Stadium|'father of the Stadium']] idea, but his textbook, ''A Manual of Engineering Drawing'', has taken the name of Professor Thomas E. French, Mech. E., '95 into 400 colleges and universities throughout the world. It is the most widely used text on engineering extant." The fifth edition of this book is now used by engineering students in schools throughout the world, and has been translated into several different languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Edgar|date=1937|title=Thos E. French|url=|journal=Ohio State Engineer|volume=Vol 21 No 2|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This book became a best seller for the [[S&amp;P Global|McGraw Hill publishing company]], and reportedly its sales kept the company from [[bankruptcy]] during the [[Great Depression in the United States|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Diary of Gladys Bolon Cooper, Book I|last=Cooper|first=Donald B.|publisher=|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir '''George Douglas Robb''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|CMG|size=85%}} (1899&amp;ndash;1974) was a [[New Zealand]] surgeon, medical reformer, writer, and university chancellor. 

==Career==
He was born at Auckland on 29 April 1899&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical Odyssey|first=Douglas|last=Robb|year=1967|publisher=Collins Bros &amp; Co., Ltd.|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and educated at the [[Auckland Grammar School]] and at the [[University of Otago]] (MB ChB). Robb had a reputation as something of a maverick and a rebel against the conventional medical establishment, as is discussed in a chapter in [[Brian Easton (economist)|Brian Easton]]'s book ''The Nationbuilders''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastonbh.ac.nz/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=605 The Nationbuilders]&lt;/ref&gt;

Robb was influential in the formation of the [[University of Auckland, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences|Auckland Medical School]] as part of the [[University of Auckland]]. From 1961 to 1962, he held the year-long position of President of the [[British Medical Association]].&lt;ref name=autobio&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical Odyssey|first=Douglas|last=Robb|year=1967|publisher=Collins Bros &amp; Co., Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of annual lectures at the University of Auckland has been named after Doug Robb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home/about/news-events-and-notices/events/events/template/event_item.jsp?cid=466941 Robb Lectures; University of Auckland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506143028/http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home/about/news-events-and-notices/events/events/template/event_item.jsp?cid=466941 |date=6 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1956 New Year Honours]] Robb was appointed a [[Order of St Michael and St George|Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=40671 |date=2 January 1956 |page=43 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was made a [[Knight Bachelor]] in the [[1960 Birthday Honours|1960 Queen's Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=42053 |date=11 June 1960 |page=4015 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Robb was a close friend of the New Zealand poet and writer [[A. R. D. Fairburn]], whose "To a Friend in the Wilderness"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzepc.auckland.ac.nz/authors/fairburn/friend.asp To a Friend in the Wilderness]&lt;/ref&gt; was dedicated to Robb. On November 6, 1935, Robb married Helen Seabrook of Auckland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical Odyssey|first=Douglas|last=Robb|year=1967|publisher=Collins Bros &amp; Co., Ltd.|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; His autobiography, ''Medical Odyssey'' was published in 1967 by Collins Bros. &amp; Co. Ltd., Auckland. Appendix 1 (4 pp.) contains a bibliography of Robb's surgical and medical articles and other writings. [[W. B. Sutch]] wrote of Robb: "Robb, unhappy with the politicians, became a foremost thoracic surgeon, and a leader in medical education and research."--''The Quest for Security in New Zealand, 1840-1966''; Oxford, 1966; p.&amp;nbsp;248.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical Odyssey|first=Douglas|last=Robb|year=1967|publisher=Collins Bros &amp; Co., Ltd.|page=appendix 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a bronze head (1956) and portrait (1961) of Sir Douglas Robb by [[John Francis Kavanagh]] in the University of Auckland Art Collection.

Douglas Robb died in his sleep on the morning of his 74th birthday. His widow, Lady Robb, died in the [[Air New Zealand Flight 901|1979 Mount Erebus disaster]].

'''Giovanni Dosi''' is Professor of Economics and Director of the Institute of Economics at the [[Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies|Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna]] in [[Pisa]]. He is the Co-Director of the task forces “Industrial Policy”{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} and “Intellectual Property”&lt;ref&gt;http://policydialogue.org/programs/task-forces/intellectual-property/&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Initiative for Policy Dialogue]] at Columbia University. Dosi is Continental European Editor of ''Industrial and Corporate Change''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Included in ''ISI Highly Cited Researchers''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

His major research areas - where he is author and editor of several works - include  [[economics of innovation and technological change]], [[industrial organization]] and industrial dynamics,  theory of the firm and corporate governance, evolutionary theory,  economic growth and development.

A selection of his works has been published in two volumes: ''Innovation,Organization and Economic Dynamics. Selected Essays'', Cheltenham, Edward Elgar, 2000; and ''Economic Organization,Industrial Dynamics and Development: Selected Essays'', Cheltenham, Edward Elgar, 2012.

==Economic analysis==
Giovanni Dosi's economic analysis is characterized by the contemporaneous attempt to ''(i)'' identify empirical regularities and ''(ii)'' provide micro-foundations consistent with such regularities. As such, his work is a mix of statistical investigations and theoretical efforts.

===Stylized facts===
Throughout his work Dosi and his co-authors have identified some [[stylized facts]] as being especially relevant for economic analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Dosi, G., Pavitt, K. and Soete L. ''The Economics of Technical Change and International Trade'', Harvester Wheatsheaf, London (1990), pp.40-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dosi, G., Freeman, C. and Fabiani, S., ''The Process of Economic Development: Introducing Some Stylized Facts and Theories on Technologies, Firms and Institutions'', Industrial and Corporate Change, 3(1), (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dosi, G. 2005"&gt;Dosi, G., ''Statistical regularities in the Evolution of Industries. A Guide through some Evidence and Challenges for the Theory'', LEM Working Paper, 17, June, (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; among others:

'''S.F.1''' Over the 19th-20th century technological innovation has proved to be the major contributor to the economic growth of countries, whose growth rates have however displayed an expanding variance.

'''S.F.2''' The learning processes that firms undertake to carry out innovations are characterized by trials, errors and unexpected success.&lt;ref&gt;Geroski, P. [[Mariana Mazzucato|and Mazzucato, M.]] [http://oro.open.ac.uk/3670/ (2002), Learning and the Sources of Corporate Growth, Industrial and Corporate Change, Vol. 11 (4): 623-644]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''S.F.3''' Firms are highly heterogeneous in terms of sizes, productivities, and profitabilities. In particular, firm sizes display stationary [[skewed distribution]]s, while productivities and profitabilities display stationary wide supports of their [[fat tail]]ed distributions.

These facts have led Dosi to point out some theoretical implications, which raise contradictions within [[Neoclassical economics]] and bear favorable witness to [[Evolutionary economics]].

===Technical change===
The role of technological progress as an explanation of contemporary economic growth (S.F.1) has led Dosi to carefully analyze the nature of technology. In particular, he has suggested an interpretation of technical change resting on the concepts of [[technological paradigm]] and [[technology trajectory]].&lt;ref&gt;Dosi, G., ''Technological paradigms and technological trajectories. A suggested interpretation of the determinants and directions of technical change'', Research Policy, 11(3):147-162, (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

In analogy with [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s definition of a scientific paradigm, Dosi has defined a technological paradigm as the general ''outlook'' on the productive problems faced by firms. As such, a technological paradigm is composed by some sort of ''model'' of the technology at stake (e.g. the model of a microprocessor) and by the specific technological problems posed by such model (e.g. increasing computational capacity, reducing dimensions, etc.). Therefore, technology is identified as a problem-solving activity in which the problems to be solved are selected by the paradigm itself. In this sense, a technological paradigm entails strong prescriptions on the ''direction'' of technological change, that is the direction toward which future technical improvements will converge. Such gradual improvements along the specific lines prescribed by the paradigm are what constitute technological trajectories and progress.&lt;ref&gt;Notably, a single paradigm can well be related to several trajectories, depending on the scope of its technical applicability.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such interpretation of technological change brings Dosi to identify a limited influence of market signals on the ''direction'' of technological change.&lt;ref&gt;Dosi, G., ''Sources, Procedures, and Microeconomic Effects of Innovation'', Journal of Economic Literature, 26(3):1120-1171, (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, in his view relative prices might affect the direction of technological change only ''within'' the boundaries defined by the nature of the technological paradigm. Such idea can be better understood by analyzing the effect of market signals in their two possible directions: moving "downstream" (i.e. from the technology to the sale of goods) and "upstream" (i.e. from the market environment to the technology).

Going "downstream", from the technology to the sale of goods, market signals enter the picture at opposite stages. First, market signals can act ''ex ante'' in the competition among different paradigms: if more paradigms are available, firms would select one or the other according to their expected profitability. But once a paradigm is affirmed, the direction of technological change would be already implied by its technological prescriptions. Second, market signals can act by selecting ''ex post'' those applications of the affirmed paradigm (i.e. the final products) that best fit the market requests. However, at that point their impact on the direction of technical change would be null, since such direction had already been decided by the prescriptions of the affirmed paradigm.

Going "upstream", from the market environment to the technology, market signals act to inform the producers of the technology about variations in [[relative price]]s. However, the extent to which technology producers can shift from more expensive to cheaper inputs, or modify technology toward the use of cheaper [[complement good]]s is bound by technical constraints. Such constraints emerge because inputs are characterized by low substitutability due to the physical and chemical limits involved in the production process. Consequently, the upstream incentives given by market signals affect only the ''rate'' of use of certain inputs as well as the rate of development of a trajectory but not the ''direction'' of technical change, which is bound by the technical constraints of production.

===Uncertainty===
The trial and error procedures adopted by firms to improve along a technological trajectory (S.F.2) have taken Dosi to assess the issue of uncertainty. At a general level, trial and error procedures imply that firms might not be able to forecast completely the outcome of a choice they make; in fact, if they could foresee the error, they would presumably avoid it because it is costly. Such a fact is strongly at odds with any assumption of "perfect rationality" or "farsightedness" on the side of economic agents, which is a foundational element of the Neoclassical approach. Dosi has analyzed this issue by assessing the ways in which economic agents perceive and deal with choices that have an uncertain outcome. In analogy with [[Herbert A. Simon]]'s distinction about rationality, he has proposed the distinction between substantive uncertainty and procedural uncertainty.&lt;ref name="uncertainty"&gt;Dosi, G. and Egidi, M., ''Substantive and procedural Uncertainty. An exploration of economic behavior in changing environments'', Journal of Evolutionary Economics, 1(2):145-168, (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, "the former is related to some lack of information about environmental events, while the latter concerns the competence gap in problem-solving".&lt;ref name="uncertainty"/&gt;{{rp|146}} Nonetheless, both of them generate "limitations on the computational and cognitive capabilities of the agents to pursue unambiguously their objectives".&lt;ref name="uncertainty"/&gt;{{rp|145}} Crucially, though, the fact that such types of uncertainties limit the computational rationality of agents leads them precisely to develop routines and decision rules that are the likely explanation of their heterogeneous behaviors. Moreover, even though such routines and decision rules are not optimally determined, they might well prove more "intelligent" than "optimal" decisions especially when applied to turbulent selection landscapes.

===Heterogeneity===
The fact that firms appear to be consistently heterogeneous (S.F.3) has brought Dosi to criticize the Neoclassical prediction that firms in an industry converge toward some kind of "optimal" or "representative" characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;Bottazzi, G., Cefis, E., Dosi, G. and Secchi, A., ''Invariances and Diversities in the Evolution of Manufacturing Industries'', LEM Working Paper, 21, October, (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dosi, G. 2005"/&gt; For such argument to be valid, the characteristics of firms would need to evolve in time toward a [[normal distribution]], possibly showing some shrinking of the support. Notably, this theoretical implication poses an unresolved challenge to the arguments put forward by [[Milton Friedman]] in his essay ''The Methodology of Positive Economics''. In such work Friedman asserted that maximizing behavior was a reasonable working approximation to describe the choices of economic agents:&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, M., ''The Methodology of Positive Economics'', (1953), now in ''Essay in Positive Economics'', University of Chicago Press, (1970). pp.17-23.&lt;/ref&gt; in fact, even if not all economic agents actually maximize (for example because some make mistakes) only the "fittest" ones will be selected by the market. Therefore, those agents that actually maximize would be the only "survivors" to market selection, and hence they would gather very closely around the single optimal behavior. In other words, the tails of the distribution will tend to disappear as market selects the best "genes", which would turn out to be both "optimal" (in terms of fit to the market selection) and "representative" (since it would be the only surviving type). However, the empirical findings that constitute S.F.3 prove the exact opposite of Friedman's prediction: very different "genes" survive to the market. As a consequence, a realistic representation of economic behavior should rather allow for firm-specificities, which would explain the heterogeneity found in the data: a point that was clearly made by [[Richard R. Nelson (economist)|Richard Nelson]] and [[Sidney Winter]] in their book ''An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change''.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R. and Winter S.G., ''An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, (1982). pp.72-136.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guy Thornton McBride''' (1919 - 2011) was an American chemical engineer who was a professor at [[Rice University]], president of the [[Colorado School of Mines]] (CSM) and as an executive of a major American corporation. McBride earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the [[University of Texas]] (UT) in 1940, where he was valedictorian, and the Doctor of Philosophy degree from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mines.edu/Mines-community-mourns-loss-of-President-Emeritus-Guy-T.-McBride-Jr. "Mines Community mourns the loss of President Emeritus Guy T. McBride, Jr." Colorado School of Mines. March 23, 2011.] Accessed February 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

McBride worked in both industry and academia, although he said that he preferred teaching. He first taught at Rice University from 1948 to 1954. Then he worked as an executive for Texas Gulf Sulphur Company until he was appointed president of Colorado School of Mines in 1970. He retired as president in 1984, but continued to teach chemical engineering courses. He died in 2011.

McBride was a strong believer in the necessity to develop young engineers who could think and work more effectively in society with people who had diverse cultures and backgrounds. He argued that this required more exposure to subjects and experiences than were customarily presented in traditional engineering curricula. The result of his work at CSM was later named, "The Guy T. McBride Honors Program in Public Affairs for Engineers."

==Early life and education==
Guy McBride was born December 12, 1919 in Austin, Texas.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/denverpost/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&amp;pid=149562205 "Guy Thornton McBride, Jr" ''Denver Post.'' March 23, 2011]. Accessed February 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The censuses of 1920, 1930 and 1940 indicate his parents were Guy T. and Imogene (nee Thrasher) McBride, Sr.  The family lived in [[Wharton, Texas]] through those years. Guy also had a younger brother.&lt;ref&gt;United States censuses for 1920, 1930 and 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from high school, Guy enrolled in the University of Texas, majoring in chemical engineering. He graduated from UT with the degree of Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering and was [[valedictorian]] of his class of 1940. He enrolled in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he earned master and doctoral degrees in chemical engineering.

==Career==
After his graduation from MIT in 1948, McBride first went to work as an engineer for Standard Oil Company (now [[Exxon Mobil]]). A few years later, he became a consultant for Texas Gulf Sulphur Company.&lt;ref name="Dignity"&gt;[http://obits.dignitymemorial.com/dignity-memorial/obituary.aspx?n=Guy-McBride&amp;lc=2379&amp;pid=149562887&amp;mid=4604700 "In Memory of Guy T. McBride Jr. December 12, 1919 - March 21, 2011." Dignity Memorials.] Accessed February 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, he joined the Rice University (then named Rice Institute) in Houston, Texas, as an associate professor of chemical engineering.&lt;ref name="Mines"&gt;[http://minesmagazine.com/3180/Dewey, Oliver.  "Guy T. McBride Jr.." ''Mines: Colorado School of Mines Magazine''. November 17, 2011.] Accessed February 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1950 he had also become Dean of Students, while still teaching. He replaced the late Dean H. H. Cameron, who had died on June 28, 1950.&lt;ref name="thresher"&gt;[https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/65963/thr19500915.pdf?sequence=1  "Three New Deans will hold office at Rice this year." ''Rice Thresher''. September 15, 1950.] Accessed February 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, he left academia to work for Texas Gulf Sulphur Company. (TGS) as vice president and general manager of its Phosphate Division.{{efn|TGS became Texasgulf Corporation in April 1972, and was acquired by Elf Aquitaine in 1981, which sold the company to the Williams Companies in 1984. Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan bought Texas Gulf in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/dktgq "Texasgulf" ''Texas State Historical Society On line''.] Accessed February 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}} He left TGS in 1970 to accept an appointment as the president of the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) in Golden, Colorado.&lt;ref name="Mines"/&gt;

McBride made a major mark during his tenure as CSM president. He is credited with:
* Raising $38 million for the school in four years,
* Adding three new buildings to the campus,
* Doubling enrollment to approximately 1,600 students,
* Establishing an Honors Program for Public Affairs (later named for him).&lt;ref name="Culver"&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/ci_17746389 Culver, Virginia. "Former Mines president McBride credited for boosting school's profile." ''Denver Post''. April 1, 2011.] Accessed February 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

McBride argued several times before leading state legislators to more funding of education. The ''Denver Post'' praised his ability to "...(ramrod) a major expansion despite inadequate state funds." He was also quoted as saying in 1984, "What we're trying to produce is the ability (among students) to think critically and be able to take the problem apart and put it back together. That is deceptively hard." According to the ''Post'', the honors program came about because of his belief that "...engineers should be literate in public policy and social issues as well as engineering."&lt;ref name="Culver"/&gt;  An article describing CSM's innovative approach to engineering education quoted President McBride as saying, ''We expose our students to stress deliberately to toughen them for the real world. We produce a graduate that really doesn't know there is anything he can't do.''&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0216/021655.html Armstrong, Scott. "Colorado school teaches reading, writing, and rocks." ''Christian Science Monitor'' February 16, 1982.] Accessed March 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

After stepping down from the presidency in 1984, McBride continued living in Golden and teaching courses at CSM. He also served on boards of directors for several corporations, such as Hercules, Halliburton and Kerr-McGee.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/13/business/executive-changes-132579.html "Executive Changes. ''New York Times''. May 13, 1982.] Accessed February 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dignity"/&gt;

==Impact==
When Guy McBride began his academic career, only a few engineering educators had begun to address how to broaden their students' school experiences. Constraints of budget and time left little room for flexibility in expanding the curriculum beyond courses that were intimately connected to his specialty. McBride's exposure to industry caused him to see that the engineers' jobs were changing at a more rapid pace, forcing him or her to make decisions based on factors that were not even addressed by his college curriculum. As technological progress speeded up , these factors seemed to proliferate, and the engineer's world became more complex.

After McBride came to CSM, he seemed to be the right man in the right place at the right time to begin implementing significant changes in engineering education. As school president, he had the "bully pulpit" to help overcome the bureaucratic inertia that often stymies such changes. Slowly a real program began to take shape. He could talk about actual results at professional meetings and get feedback from corporate executives who were hiring CSM graduates. More schools began tinkering with their own programs.

'''Heinrich Hübsch''' (9 February 1795 – 3 April 1863) was a [[Germans|German]] architect.  After studies in [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] (1813–15) and at [[Friedrich Weinbrenner]]'s school of architecture in [[Karlsruhe]] (1815–17) he traveled extensively in [[Greece]] and [[Italy]] (1817–24).  In 1831 he was appointed Oberbaurat (inspector of buildings) at Karlsruhe.  He designed many churches and other public buildings, mainly in the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]], and is also known for his writings.

In his book ''In welchem Style sollen wir bauen?'' (''In which style should we build?'', 1828) he distanced himself from Weinbrenner's [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]]. ''Die altchristlichen Kirchen'' (Karlsruhe, 1862) is a work on basilican architecture, published also in [[French language|French]] as ''Monuments de l'architecture chrétienne''.

Hübsch is credited with creating the [[Rundbogenstil]] architectural style.&lt;ref&gt;Bergdoll, Barry, European Architecture, 1750-1890,  Oxford, 2000, pp. 184-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''History of education in Missouri''' deals with schooling Over two centuries, from the settlements In the early 19th century to the present. It covers students, teachers, schools, and educational policies.

==Early days==
The small historically French settlements that became part of the United States in 1803 have limited schooling.  schools were established in several Missouri towns; by 1821, they existed in the towns of St. Louis, St. Charles, Ste. Genevieve, Florissant, Cape Girardeau, Franklin, Potosi, Jackson, and Herculaneum, and in rural areas in both Cooper and Howard counties. They were proprietary schools run by itinerant teachers who catered to boys of families who could pay small stipends, and usually provide room and board for the teacher. A few coeducational schools existed in some rural areas by the 1830s. Eleven schools for girls also operated during the territorial period, but these focused on basic literacy and homemaking practices.&lt;ref&gt;Duane G. Meyer, ''The Heritage of Missouri'' (3 ed. 1982) pp 138-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Louis William Valentine Dubourg]] became the Catholic bishop of St Louis in 1818 he began numerous projects. A Catholic academy, St. Louis Academy (later [[Saint Louis University]]), was established in 1818 as the first college west of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slu.edu/x5029.xml ''Founded in 1818, SLU was the first university west of the Mississippi River''] date=February 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1860-1900==

Before the Civil War, Missouri followed the southern pattern that downplayed public schooling, as well-to-do families patronized local private academies. Ambitious but poor parents pooled their resources to hire part-time teachers for their children.  During Reconstruction in the 1860s, the [[Radical Republicans]]  in power strongly favored modernization through the rapid growth in public schools. Their 1865 Constitution, and numerous state laws, called for a large network of public schools, including ones for black children. The plan was to require four months terms of schooling every year for children. Under the aggressive leadership of state superintendent of schools Thomas A. Parker, the number of public schools jumped from 48,000 in 1867 to 75,000 in 1870, as enrollment grew from 169,000 to 280,000. The 1870 totals included 9100 black students. About 59 percent of the eligible white children attended school annually in 1870, along with 21 percent of the eligible black children.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Hunt and Linda C. Morice. "Caught in the crossfire: factors influencing the closing of Missouri's black schools, 1865-1905." ''American Educational History Journal'' 35.1/2 (2008): 233.&lt;/ref&gt;  Parker built up organizations of teachers at the county level, as well as the state level, holding numerous clinics to provide the pedagogical education the teachers lacked. New normal schools, to train teachers, were opened at Kirksville&lt;ref&gt;David Clifford Nichols, ''Founding the Future: A History of Truman State University'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; and Warrensburg in 1870. A new state university was founded in Columbia, with land-grant federal aid. However it had to share some of that aid with the new school of mines at Rolla.  The public school system across the state was heavily oriented toward providing the three Rs of elementary education. High schools were rare outside the major cities.  Families that could afford to have children attend school rather than hold a paying job patronized 45 academies in 1870, most of which were attached to the 37 small private colleges. Most  were run by religious denominations. St. Louis, under the leadership of [[William Torrey Harris]] as superintendent of schools 1868-1880, developed one of the nation's outstanding public school system, complete with the first public kindergartens. Once the conservatives returned to power in 1872, however, public schooling became again a low priority matter in rural Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish, ''Missouri: The Heart of the Nation'' (1980) pp 202-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lincoln Institute===
{{main|Lincoln University (Missouri)}}
Education for slaves was practically nonexistent in Missouri, the small free black population in St. Louis provided small-scale schooling. During the war, the 62nd Colored Infantry regiment of the U.S. Army, largely recruited in Missouri, set up educational program for its soldiers. At the end of the war it raised $6300 To set up a black school, to be headed by a white abolitionist officer, Richard Foster (1826 – 1901). Foster opened Lincoln Institute in Jefferson City in 1866. Lincoln had a black student body, both black and white teachers, and outside support from religious groups. The state government was supportive and provided $5000 a year to train teachers for the new black school system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence O. Christensen et al. eds.|title=Dictionary of Missouri Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gyxWHRLAWgC&amp;pg=PA312|year=1999|publisher=U of Missouri Press|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==School integration==
In the early 1950s, legal challenges led to the admission of black students to the University of Missouri, which had heretofore been a white-only institution.  From 1950 to 1954, four attempts were made by black families to enroll their students in white schools in Kansas City, St. Louis County, and St. Louis City.  In Kansas City, 150 black students attempted to enroll at a white school; despite their schools not offering gymnasiums or auditoriums, their attempt was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo J. Greene, et al. ''Missouri's Black Heritage'' (1980) pp 167-69&lt;/ref&gt;

After the United States Supreme Court declared school segregation unconstitutional in ''Brown v. Board of Education'' (1954), Missouri Attorney General announced that Missouri's school segregation laws were void.  Despite this, several Missouri districts refused to comply with the ruling; schools in [[Charleston, Missouri|Charleston]] avoided integration until the mid-1960s, along with several other Bootheel districts. In many cases, black students were assigned to schools more than 30 miles from their homes, beyond white schools, and many libraries and parks remained off limits to black students.  Many black teachers were laid off after integration. In Moberly, eleven black teachers were laid off in 1955, and more than 125 teachers lost their jobs in mid-Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, et al. ''Missouri's Black Heritage'' (1980) pp 174&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1970 the Kansas City school district had experienced massive white and middle-class black flight that left it with a smaller tax base and a severe money shortage. The district increasingly depended on federal funding and could not afford to turn down large federal grants that required it to integrate faster. Ultimately, the desegregation that was accomplished in Kansas City was far too little and came far too late, after the district had lost most of its white students to the suburbs, says historian Peter Moran.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Moran, "Too little, too late: The illusive goal of school desegregation in Kansas City, Missouri, and the role of the federal government." ''The Teachers College Record'' 107.9 (2005): pp 1933-1955.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, a lawsuit challenged segregation in St Louis city and suburban schools led to a 1983 settlement agreement in which St. Louis County school districts agreed to accept black students from the city on a voluntary basis. State funds were used to transport students to provide an integrated education.  The agreement also called for white students from the county to voluntarily attend city [[magnet schools]], in an effort to desegregate the City's remaining schools. Despite opposition from state and local political leaders, the plan significantly desegregated St. Louis schools; in 1980, 82 percent of black students in the city attended all-black schools, while in 1995, only 41 percent did so. During the late 1990s, the St. Louis voluntary transfer program was the largest such program in the United States, with more than 14,000 enrolled students.  The program is shrinking every year and will end after the 2030&amp;ndash;2031 school year.&lt;ref&gt;William Freivogel, "St. Louis: Desegregation and School Choice in the Land of Dred Scott" (Century Foundation Press, September 17, 2002 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110715231829/http://tcf.org/publications/pdfs/pb377/freigovel.pdf online] pp 209-35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justin D.

'''iansyst Ltd''' is an [[Assistive technology|Assistive Technology]] supplier providing products and services designed to benefit people with a range of disabilities such as: [[dyslexia]], [[visual impairments]], [[dyscalculia]], [[developmental coordination disorder]], [[Repetitive Strain Injury]] to help them reach their potential.

==History==
The company was founded in London in early 1983 by Ian Litterick, primarily to supply software for training and education.

By 1995, now based in Cambridge, iansyst was distributing the monologue Text to [[Speech Synthesis]] software. This type of software was considered useful by people with [[dyslexia]] to help those who struggle with a [[reading disability]].

In 1996, iansyst became involved with the framework of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20101221043702/http://www.dsa-qag.org.uk/content.asp?ContentID=1 DSA-QAG (the Disabled Students’ Allowance Quality Assurance Group)], as well as becoming a supplier of assistive technology and training for students who have received the [http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/DisabledPeople/EducationAndTraining/HigherEducation/DG_10034898. Disabled Students Allowance] (DSA) Award.
Founder, Ian Litterick has been an active member of the [http://www.rnib.org.uk/getinvolved/campaign/accesstoinformation/righttoread/Pages/righttoread.aspx Right to Read Campaign] which was launched in 2002.

During 2009/2010 iansyst partnered with [http://www.xma.co.uk/ XMA] to deliver the Home Access initiative from the Government to supply children with severe disabilities or [[Special education in the United Kingdom|Special Educational Needs]], of low income families with the Home Access package of a computer, internet access and assistive technology. The partnership between iansyst and education experts XMA was recognised when they won the Working Together Award in 2012 from [http://www.technology4goodawards.org.uk/ Technology4Good]. These unique awards were organised by [http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/ AbilityNet] and [http://www.btplc.com/ BT] and brought together a range of charities and businesses whose work enables people to improve their lives through the use of IT.

In early 2012 iansyst was awarded funding by [http://www.jisctechdis.ac.uk/sbricompetitions Jisc TechDis] via the [http://www.jisctechdis.ac.uk/techdis/news/detail/2011/sbri_result Plain Sailing Competition] to develop [http://www.mydocstore.org.uk/ MyDocStore]. This was done in partnership with a consortium of organisations led by iansyst: they include [http://www.raspberrysoftware.com/ Raspberry Software] and [http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ ECS&amp;nbsp;– Electronics and Computer Science] from the [http://www.southampton.ac.uk/ University of Southampton]. The aim of MyDocStore is to make it quick and easy to transfer files between devices whilst simultaneously converting them into an accessible format for the user; i.e. text to audio, text to large format and combinations of both. In 2013 the project was launched as the web service [http://www.azzapt.com/ azzapt].

==Staff==
Executive Chairman, Ian Litterick is a founder member of [http://bataonline.org/ BATA British Assistive Technology Association]. BATA campaigns for the rights and interests of those needing Assistive Technology.

KUSMS is a collaborative program of [[Kathmandu University]] and [[Dhulikhel Hospital]]. The main office of KUSMS is on the premises of [[Dhulikhel Hospital]], a Kathmandu University hospital, in [[Kavrepalanchok District]], [[Nepal]]. KUSMS was set up in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.ku.edu.np/university/index.php?go=his |title = History of KU in brief |publisher = Kathmandu University}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manipal College of Medical Sciences]] in [[Pokhara]] was the first medical college to be granted affiliation. Since then, KUSMS has granted affiliation to several medical colleges around the country.

KUSMS formally started its own medical training program, the [[MBBS]] program, on 7 September 2001 in association with Dhulikhel Hospital. The first class was 43 [[Nepal]]i students. The day is annually celebrated as KUSMS Day. Although the medical school is still widely known as KUMS, inside and outside the country, its name was changed to Kathmandu University School of Medical Sciences (KUSMS) in 2006, in view of the fact that it not only trains medical undergraduates and postgraduates, but also runs nursing and allied health science programs.

The main focus of the organization is to contribute in improving the overall health status of Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.ku.edu.np |title = History of KU in brief |publisher = Kathmandu University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lysenkoism''' ({{lang-rus|Лысе́нковщина|Lysenkovshchina}}) was a political campaign conducted by [[Trofim Lysenko]], his followers and Soviet authorities against [[genetics]] and science-based [[agriculture]]. Lysenko served as the director of the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[VASKhNIL|Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences]]. Lysenkoism began in the late 1920s and formally ended in 1964.

The [[pseudo science|pseudo-scientific]] ideas of Lysenkoism assumed the [[Inheritance of acquired characteristics|heritability of acquired characteristics (Lamarckism)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lysenkoism|title= Lysenkoism|work= merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lysenko's theory rejected [[Mendelian inheritance]] and the concept of the "[[gene]]"; it departed from [[Darwinian evolution]]ary theory by rejecting [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Perversion of Knowledge" /&gt; Proponents falsely claimed to have discovered, among many other things, that [[rye]] could transform into wheat and wheat into barley, that weeds could spontaneously transmute into food grains, and that "natural cooperation" was observed in nature as opposed to "natural selection".&lt;ref name="Perversion of Knowledge"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Birstein|first1= Vadim J.|title= The Perversion of Knowledge: The True Story of Soviet Science.|date= 2004|publisher= Westview Press|isbn= 0813342805}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lysenkoism promised extraordinary advances in [[sexual reproduction|breeding]] and in agriculture that never came about.

[[Joseph Stalin]] supported the campaign. More than 3,000 mainstream [[biologist]]s were fired or even sent to prison,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Birstein| first1 = Vadim J.| title = The Perversion Of Knowledge: The True Story Of Soviet Science| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2XqEAAAAQBAJ| publisher = Perseus Books Group| publication-date = 2013| page = | isbn = 9780786751860| access-date = 2016-06-30| quote = Academician Schmalhausen, Professors Formozov and Sabinin, and 3,000 other biologists, victims of the August 1948 Session, lost their professional jobs because of their integrity and moral principles [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous scientists were executed as part of a campaign instigated by Lysenko to [[Suppressed research in the Soviet Union|suppress his scientific opponents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wade|first1=Nicholas|title=The Scourge of Soviet Science|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-scourge-of-soviet-science-1466192179|website=Wall Street Journal|date=June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swedin|first1=Eric G.|title=Science in the Contemporary World : An Encyclopedia|date=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1851095241|pages=168, 280}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soyfer Nature"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soyfer |first1=Valery N. |title=The Consequences of Political Dictatorship for Russian Science|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=1 September 2001 |volume=2 |issue=9|pages=723–729|doi=10.1038/35088598}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=deJong-Lambert|first1=William|title=The Lysenko Controversy as a Global Phenomenon, Volume 1: Genetics and Agriculture in the Soviet Union and Beyond|date=2017|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=3319391755 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president of the Agriculture Academy, [[Nikolai Vavilov]], was sent to prison and died there, while scientific research in the field of genetics was effectively destroyed until the [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death of Stalin]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="Perversion of Knowledge" /&gt; Research and teaching in the fields of [[neurophysiology]], [[cell biology]], and many other biological disciplines was also negatively affected or banned.&lt;ref name="Soyfer Tagedy"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Soyfer|first1= Valery N.| authorlink =Valery Soyfer|title= Lysenko and The Tragedy of Soviet Science|date= 1994|publisher= Rutgers Univ.

In modern usage, the term lysenkoism has become distinct from normal pseudoscience. Where pseudoscience pretends to be science, lysenkoism aims at attacking the legitimacy of science itself, usually for political reasons.  It is the rejection of the universality of scientific truth, and the purposeful defamation of the scientific method to the level of politics. 

==In agriculture==
In 1928, Trofim Lysenko, a previously unknown [[Agronomy|agronomist]], claimed to have developed an agricultural technique, termed [[vernalization]], which tripled or quadrupled [[crop yield]] by exposing [[wheat]] seed to high humidity and low temperature. While cold and moisture exposure are a normal part of the life cycle of autumn-seeded winter cereals, the vernalization technique claimed to increase yields by increasing the intensity of exposure, in some cases planting soaked seeds directly into the snow cover of frozen fields. In reality, the technique was neither new (it had been known since 1854, and was extensively studied during the previous twenty years), nor did it produce the yields he promised, although some increase in production did occur.

When Lysenko began his fieldwork in the Soviet Union of the 1930s, the [[Agriculture in the Soviet Union|agriculture of the Soviet Union]] was in a massive crisis due to the forced [[collective farms|collectivisation of farms]], and the extermination of the [[kulak]]s.  The resulting [[Soviet famine of 1932–33|famine]] provoked the people and the government alike to search for any possible solution to the critical lack of food.  Lysenko's vernalization practices yielded marginally greater food production on the farms, and he was quickly accepted as the hero of Soviet agriculture.

Many [[agronomist]]s were educated before the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|revolution]], and even many of those educated afterwards did not agree with the forced collectivization policies. Furthermore, among biologists of the day, the most popular topic was not agriculture at all, but the new genetics that was emerging out of studies of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', commonly known as fruit flies.  [[Drosophilidae|Drosophilid]] flies made experimental verification of genetics theories, such as [[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian ratio]]s and [[heritability]], much easier.

[[Isaak Izrailevich Prezent]], a main Lysenko theorist, presented Lysenko in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[mass-media]] as a [[genius]] who had developed a new, revolutionary agricultural technique. In this period, [[Soviet propaganda]] often focused on inspirational stories of [[peasant]]s who, through their own canny ability and intelligence, came up with solutions to practical problems. Lysenko's widespread popularity provided him a platform to denounce theoretical genetics and to promote his own agricultural practices. He was, in turn, supported by the Soviet propaganda machine, which overstated his successes and omitted mention of his failures. This was accompanied by fake experimental data supporting Lysenkoism from scientists seeking favor and the destruction of counter-evidence to Lysenko's theories.  Instead of performing controlled experiments, Lysenko claimed that vernalization increased wheat yields by 15%, solely based upon questionnaires taken of farmers.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Rise==  
Lysenko's political success was mostly due to his appeal to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] and [[Soviet ideology]]. Following the disastrous [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization efforts of the late 1920s]], Lysenko's "new" methods were seen by Soviet officials as paving the way to an "agricultural revolution." Lysenko himself was from a peasant family, and was an enthusiastic advocate of [[Leninism]]. During a period which saw a series of man-made agricultural disasters, he was also extremely fast in responding to problems, although not with real solutions. Whenever the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party]] announced plans to plant a new crop or [[Tillage|cultivate]] a new area, Lysenko had immediate practical suggestions on how to proceed.

So quickly did he develop his prescriptions—from the cold treatment of grain, to the plucking of leaves from cotton plants, to the cluster planting of trees, to unusual fertilizer mixes—that academic biologists did not have time to demonstrate that one technique was valueless or harmful before a new one was adopted. The Party-controlled newspapers  applauded Lysenko's "practical" efforts and questioned the motives of his critics. Lysenko's "revolution in agriculture" had a powerful propaganda advantage over the academics, who urged the patience and observation required for science.

Lysenko was admitted into the hierarchy of the Communist Party, and was put in charge of agricultural affairs. He used his position to denounce biologists as "fly-lovers and people haters",&lt;ref&gt;''Epistemology and the Social'', Evandro Agazzi, Javier Echeverría, Amparo Gómez Rodríguez, Rodopi, Jan 1, 2008 - Philosophy - 231 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xBvbQgWtgjsC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=fly-lovers+and+%22people+haters%22+%22Lysenko%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-nMvVcfbMNKyogTn24CICA&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA Google books scanned reference], p 149&lt;/ref&gt; and to decry the "[[wrecking (Soviet crime)|wreckers]]" in biology, who he claimed were trying to purposely disable the Soviet economy and cause it to fail. Furthermore, he denied the distinction between theoretical and applied biology.

Lysenko presented himself as a follower of [[Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin]], a well-known and well-liked Soviet [[horticulture|horticulturist]]. However, unlike Michurin, he advocated a form of [[Lamarckism]], insisting on using only [[Heterosis|hybridization]] and [[grafting]], as  non-genetic techniques. With this came, most importantly, the implication that ''acquired'' characteristics of an organism—for example, the state of being leafless as a result of having been plucked—could be inherited by that organism's descendants.  This is why Lysenko claimed [[vernalization]] would give greater productivity than it did; he believed the ability of his vernalized seeds to flower faster and produce more wheat would be passed on to the next generation of wheat seeds, thus causing vernalization to further amplify the process.

Support from [[Joseph Stalin]] gave Lysenko even more momentum and popularity.  In 1935, Lysenko compared his opponents in biology to the peasants who still resisted the Soviet government's collectivization strategy, saying that by opposing his theories the traditional geneticists were setting themselves against Marxism.  Stalin was in the audience when this speech was made, and he was the first one to stand and applaud, calling out "Bravo, Comrade Lysenko. Bravo."{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}  This event emboldened Lysenko and gave him and his ally Prezent free rein to slander the geneticists who still spoke out against him.  Many of Lysenkoism's opponents, such as his former mentor [[Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov]], were imprisoned or even executed because of Lysenko's and Prezent's denunciations.

On August 7, 1948, the  V.I. Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences announced that from that point on Lysenkoism would be taught as "the only correct theory". Soviet scientists were forced to denounce any work that contradicted Lysenko.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela N. Wrinch. "[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2008893 Science and Politics in the U.S.S.R.: The Genetics Debate]". ''[[World Politics]]'', Vol. 3, No. 4 (Jul., 1951), pp. 486-519&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of Lysenko was denounced as "bourgeois" or "fascist", and analogous "non-bourgeois" theories also flourished in other fields in the Soviet academy at this time (see [[Japhetic theory]]; [[socialist realism]]). Perhaps the only opponents of Lysenkoism during Stalin's lifetime to escape liquidation were from the small community of Soviet [[Nuclear physics|nuclear physicists]]: as [[Tony Judt]] has observed, "It is significant that Stalin left his nuclear physicists alone and never presumed to second guess ''their'' calculations. Stalin may well have been mad but he was not stupid."&lt;ref name="Judt"&gt;Judt, Tony. ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945'', (New York: Penguin Books, 2006), p. 174n.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other countries==

Many other countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]] accepted Lysenkoism as the official "new biology" as well; however the acceptance of Lysenkoism was not uniform in communist countries. In Poland, all geneticists except for [[Wacław Gajewski]]&lt;ref name="gaj"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|year=1990|volume=65|issue=4|author=Gajewski W.|title=Lysenkoism in Poland|doi=10.1086/416949|pages=423–34|pmid=2082404}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed Lysenkoism. Even though Gajewski was not allowed contact with students, he was allowed to continue his scientific work at the Warsaw botanical garden. Lysenkoism was then rapidly rejected starting from 1956&lt;ref name="gaj"/&gt; and modern genetics research departments were formed, including the first department of genetics headed by Wacław Gajewski, which was started at the [[Warsaw University]] in 1958.

[[Czechoslovakia]] adopted Lysenkoism in 1949. [[Jaroslav Kříženecký]] (1896–1964) was one of the prominent Czechoslovak geneticists opposing Lysenkoism, and when he criticized Lysenkoism in his lectures, he was dismissed from the Agricultural University in 1949 for "serving the established capitalistic system, considering himself superior to the working class, and being hostile to the democratic order of the people", and imprisoned in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology|last=Orel|first=Vitezslav|title=Jaroslav Kříženecký (1896-1964), Tragic Victim of Lysenkoism in Czechoslovakia|volume=67|issue=4|pages=487–494|year=1992|jstor=2832019|doi=10.1086/417797}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, he was appointed head of the newly established [[Gregor Mendel]] department in the [[Moravian Museum]] in [[Brno]], the city in which Gregor Mendel pursued his early experiments on inheritance and formulated the laws of [[Mendelian inheritance]].

In the [[German Democratic Republic]], although Lysenkoism was taught at some of the universities, it had very little impact on science due to the actions of a few scientists (for example, the geneticist and fierce critic of Lysenkoism, [[Hans Stubbe]]) and an open border to [[West Berlin]] research institutions. Nonetheless, Lysenkoist theories were found in schoolbooks until the dismissal of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(02)02677-X|title=How did East German genetics avoid Lysenkoism?|first=Rudolf|last=Hagemann|journal=Trends in Genetics|volume=18|issue=6|year=2002|pages=320–324|pmid=12044362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lysenkoism dominated [[Science in the People's Republic of China|Chinese science]] from 1949 until 1956, particularly during the [[Great Leap Forward]], when, during a genetics symposium opponents of Lysenkoism were permitted to freely criticize it and argue for Mendelian genetics.&lt;ref name="china"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lysenkoism in China|last=Li|first=CC|journal=Journal of Heredity|volume=78|issue=5|page=339|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the proceedings from the symposium, [[Tan Jiazhen]] is quoted as saying "Since [the] USSR started to criticize Lysenko, we have dared to criticize him too".&lt;ref name="china"/&gt; For a while, both schools were permitted to coexist, although the influence of the Lysenkoists remained large for several years.&lt;ref name="china"/&gt;

==Repercussions==

From 1934 to 1940, under Lysenko's admonitions and with Stalin's approval, many geneticists were executed (including [[Isaak Agol]], [[Solomon Levit]], [[Grigorii Levitskii]], [[Georgii Karpechenko]] and [[Georgii Nadson]]) or sent to [[labor camp]]s. The famous Soviet geneticist and president of the Agriculture Academy, [[Nikolai Vavilov]], was arrested in 1940 and died in prison in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Barry Mandel. "Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov: the explorer and plant collector". ''Economic Botany'', ''45'' (1991): 38–46.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Joseph Muller]] (and his teachings about genetics) was criticized as a bourgeois, capitalist, imperialist, and promoting fascism so he left the USSR, to return to the US via Republican Spain. In 1948, genetics was officially declared "a [[bourgeois pseudoscience]]";&lt;ref name=gar57&gt;{{cite book | last = Gardner | first = Martin | year = 1957 | title=Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science | publisher=Dover Books | location = New York | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TwP3SGAUsnkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=gardner%20fads%20and%20fallacies&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | isbn = 9780486131627}}&lt;/ref&gt; all geneticists were fired from their jobs (some were also arrested), and all genetic research was discontinued.

Over 3,000 biologists were imprisoned, fired, or executed for attempting to oppose Lysenkoism at one time and overall, scientific research in genetics was effectively destroyed  until the death of Stalin in 1953.&lt;ref name="Perversion of Knowledge" /&gt; Due to Lysenkoism, crop yields in the USSR actually declined as well.&lt;ref name="Perversion of Knowledge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Soyfer Tagedy" /&gt;

At the end of 1952, the situation started changing, possibly due to Stalin taking offense to Lysenko's growing influence. Articles criticizing Lysenkoism were published in newspapers. However, the process of return to regular genetics slowed down in [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s times, due to Lysenko showing him the supposed successes of an experimental agricultural complex. It once again became forbidden to criticize Lysenkoism, though it was now possible to express different views, and all geneticists were released or [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated posthumously]]. The ban was only waived in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="aleksandrovvya"&gt;''Александров, В. Я.'' [http://vivovoco.astronet.ru/VV/BOOKS/ALEXANDROV/CONTENT.HTM Трудные годы советской биологии: Записки современника].&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost alone among Western scientists, [[John Desmond Bernal]], Professor of [[Physics]] at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College, University of London]], and a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]], made an aggressive public defense of Lysenko and some years later gave an obituary of "Stalin as a Scientist". However, despite Bernal's endorsement, other members of Britain's scientific community retreated from open support of the Soviet Union.

== Neo-Lysenkoism ==
The word "Neo-Lysenkoism" has occasionally been used by [[Hereditarianism|hereditarian]] researchers, such as [[Roger Pearson (anthropologist)|Roger Pearson]] and [[Bernard Davis (biologist)|Bernard Davis]], as a pejorative term in the [[race and intelligence controversy|debates over race and intelligence]] and [[sociobiology]] to describe scientists supposedly minimizing the role of genes in shaping human behavior, such as [[Leon Kamin]], [[Richard Lewontin]], [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Barry Mehler]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Roger. "Activist Lysenkoism: The Case of Barry Mehler." In ''Race, Intelligence and Bias in Academe'' (Washington: Scott-Townsend Publishers, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Davis|first= Bernard|last2= |first2= |year= 1983|title= Neo-Lysenkoism, IQ, and the press|url= https://www.nationalaffairs.com/public_interest/detail/neo-lysenkoism-iq-and-the-press |journal= [[The Public Interest]]|publisher= [[National Affairs]]|volume= |issue= 73|pages= 41–59|doi= |accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
The use of the term "neo-Lysenkoism" to describe [[criticism of evolutionary psychology]] have drawn criticism for misapplying the term "Lysenkoism" to things unrelated to actual Lysenkoism. For instance, Lysenko's views on inheritance of acquired characteristics presumed that individuals were born with characteristics acquired by their parents, not [[tabula rasa]]. This was integrated into Stalin's purges by presuming that simply having biological parents who were [[kulak|capitalists]] constituted a risk factor for becoming a dissident due to inheritance of acquired capitalist interest even if the children had not been postnatally raised capitalist. This is argued to show that the definition of [[nature versus nurture|"nature"]] as "anything before birth" that is used by [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] when they classify ideas of hormones before birth on [[prenatal hormones and sexual orientation|sexuality]] and [[empathizing-systemizing theory#Fetal testosterone|empathy]] as "biological" would also classify Lysenkoism as "biological" due to all three being prenatalist but not Mendelian genetic, remarking that accusations of social engineering in "nurture" models can simply transform into accusations of prenatal environment engineering in "womb environment" models. The usage of the term "neo-Lysenkoism" for models of evolution that contradict the Darwinian model of gradual and maximized reproductive success is criticized for missing the point that while it is uncertain whether or not Darwin read about Mendel's genetic discoveries, it is clear that Darwin did not integrate Mendelian genetics into his model of evolution and that Mendel read The Origin of Species and accepted evolution but did not consider his discoveries a solution to any problems with Darwinian evolution, that Mendelian genetics was the primary subject of suppression of modern biology under Lysenkoism, and that Mendelian genetics is actually a source of modern criticism of the maximization of reproductive success model of evolution as Mendelian models show that short term maximized reproductive success of specific genes deplete genetic variation and increase the long term risk of extinction (explaining higher extinction risks in more  [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] species as a functional similarity between  [[Bateman's principle]] and asexual reproduction) during environmental change which could not be predicted by premodern models of genetics such as those of Darwin and Lysenko alike. Contrary to the allegation of [[anti-psychiatry]] being neo-Lysenkoist, it is remarked that [[psychiatric medication]] was not suppressed in the Soviet Union under Lysenkoism, but the use of psychiatric drugs in the Soviet Union actually increased and was approved by the regime during the Lysenko era. It is cited that Communists considered [[biological psychiatry|chemical imbalance models of "mental illnesses"]] including but not limited to [[false consciousness|anti-communism in "working class" people in Communist countries]] more materialistic and in accordance with Marxist [[dialectical materialism]] than the idea of other cultural factors than class interest influencíng behavior that was considered idealist, and that this was used as an argument by officials in the Soviet Union for approving increased psychiatric medication.&lt;ref&gt;Dmitri Stanchevici (2017).

==History==
MOMS was largely an organized reaction by conservative residents of the county to the [[Anaheim Union High School District]]'s family life and sex education course. The school district had implemented a sex education course in 1965 with little resistance.  Three years later, in 1968, a homemaker named [[Eleanor Howe]], whose son was enrolled at one of the district's schools, got wind of the curriculum and began organizing a network of like-minded mothers to confront the school board.  The members of this group flocked to a meeting of the school board and quoted material from a pamphlet, ''[[Is the Schoolhouse the Proper Place to Teach Raw Sex?]]'', which had recently been published by [[Billy James Hargis]]'s Christian Crusade and demanded that the course be halted immediately. They also stated their firm belief, based on the film [[Pavlov's Children]] produced by members of the political Radical Right who saw the US as locked in conflict between Christian-based traditional values and Communist subversive "new" values, that the course was the result of a Soviet communist conspiracy orchestrated through the [[United Nations]] to make American youth amenable to totalitarian dictatorship.&lt;ref name="Winters2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Sean Winters|title=God's Right Hand: How Jerry Falwell Made God a Republican and Baptized the American Right|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mZCLmJu546oC&amp;pg=PT18|accessdate=4 September 2013|date=17 January 2012|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-209872-6|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within a year they had replaced the elected members of the board with their political allies, and the sex education program at A.U.H.S.D. was dispensed with.&lt;ref name="Corngold2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Josh Corngold|title=Toleration, Parents' Rights, and Children's Autonomy: The Case of Sex Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ixJCExcQLXoC&amp;pg=PA149|accessdate=4 September 2013|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-85273-5|pages=149–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Astronomy Week''' (NAW) is an event held every few years in the [[United Kingdom]] to promote public awareness of astronomy by celebrating notable astronomical events.

==Activities==
During the week, astronomy societies, planetaria, schools, universities and other organisations from all over the UK organise events to promote interest in, and knowledge of, astronomy. The organisers promote the week using extensive contacts with the media and all the major UK astronomical organisations, many of whom provide funding. Events range from talks, visits and in particular the opportunity for children and adults alike to observe the sky through a range of equipment.  The 2014 event is described in ''[[Astronomy &amp; Geophysics]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Target Jupiter: National Astronomy Week 2014 |url=http://astrogeo.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/2/2.5.2.extract |journal=Astronomy &amp; Geophysics |year=2013 |publisher=astrogeo.oxfordjournals |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=2 |doi=10.1093/astrogeo/att006 |accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The need for National Astronomy Week (NAW) was first defined in the late 1970s.  A group of both professional and amateur astronomers as well as teachers and educators was formed to define and run the first ever event. NAW was proposed in 1979 and a steering committee was set up in 1980. Since then a total of seven events have run as listed below.

===2014===
The seventh event, named "Target Jupiter", ran from 1–8 March 2014. Jupiter was at a very high position in the sky, the best that will be achieved for many years. Observing conditions were generally well above average. More than 200 events were run across the UK. Participating organisations included Astronomy Societies, Schools, Universities, and Scouts/Guides. The details are listed on the National Astronomy Week website.&lt;ref name=NAW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronomyweek.org.uk |title=Coming! 1st to 8th March 2014 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|website=astronomyweek.org.uk |publisher=NAW |accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was widely announced in the UK, for example in ''[[Astronomy &amp; Geophysics]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Target Jupiter: National Astronomy Week 2014 |url=http://astrogeo.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/2/2.5.2.extract |journal=Astronomy &amp; Geophysics |year=2013 |publisher=astrogeo.oxfordjournals |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=2 |doi=10.1093/astrogeo/att006 |accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is also information on the NAW Twitter page&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/NAW2014NAW2014 NAW2014 on Twitter]&lt;/ref&gt; and on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/astronomyweek NAW2014 on Facebook]&lt;/ref&gt; A special event radio station, call sign GB1NAW, transmitted  from [[Lockyer Observatory and Planetarium|Lockyer Technology Centre]] during National Astronomy Week (and the week preceding), between 7.060&amp;nbsp;MHz and 7.200&amp;nbsp;MHz LSB (Lower Side Band) during daylight hours and between 3.600&amp;nbsp;MHz and 3.800&amp;nbsp;MHz LSB after dusk.

The '''National Union of Women Teachers''' ('''NUWT''') was a trade union representing women [[schoolteacher]]s in Great Britain.  It originated in 1904 as a campaign for equal pay for equal work, and dissolved in 1961, when this was achieved.

==History==
Women teachers in the [[National Union of Teachers]] (NUT) first formed a Ladies' Committee in 1896.  In 1900, this became a standing committee, consisting of the women members of the executive of the union, and some male executive members in an "ex officio" role.  However, the committee focused on recruitment drives and, for example, in 1906 refused to sign a petition for [[women's suffrage]].  The union's journal, ''Board Teacher'', was opposed to equal pay for women teachers, but the Ladies' Committee was unwilling to campaign on the issue.  This inspired a small number of members to form the '''Equal Pay League''' in April 1904.&lt;ref name="copelman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Copelman|first1=Dinah|title=London's Women Teachers: Gender, Class and Feminism, 1870-1930|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1136094768}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mbb"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boussahba-Bravard|first1=Myriam|title=Suffrage Outside Suffragism: Britain 1880-1914|date=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=9781349544912|pages=205-230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main founders of the league were L. E. Lane, a London-based teacher who had previously campaigned to equalise payments from the union's benevolent and orphanage funds, and Joseph Tate, based in Birmingham, who became its first honorary secretary.  Other founder members included [[Teresa Billington]], who soon became the group's main organiser, and her Manchester branch became the most important section of the organisation.  But growth was initially slow, with only 34 members by November, and an effort to pass an equal pay policy at the NUT conference that year was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="copelman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mbb" /&gt;

In 1906 the organisation was renamed the '''National Federation of Women Teachers''', and it adopted a new policy of opposing increases in membership dues for women, on the grounds that they received lower benefits than male members.  It successfully sponsored Isabel Cleghorn's campaign to become vice-president of the NUT in 1909.  Failing to persuade the NUT to support women's suffrage, many federation members were founders of the [[Women Teachers' Franchise Union]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="copelman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mbb" /&gt; [[Ethel Froud]] became honorary secretary of the federation in 1913, the position being renamed "general secretary" in 1917; she remained in post until 1940.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48575;jsessionid=F804EEFA86E9D4BA378A40CA01948790|title=Ethel Froud|last=Kean|first=Hilda|website=www.oxforddnb.com|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1916, the federation's membership had grown significantly, and its members had become increasingly frustrated with continuing male control of the NUT.  It decided to prepare to break away from the NUT after the conclusion of [[World War I]].  Although the NUT finally adopted a policy of equal pay in 1919, it did not prioritise this during subsequent pay negotiations, and this was the final straw.&lt;ref name="oram"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oram|first1=Alison|title=Women Teachers and Feminist Politics, 1900-39|date=1996|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0719027594|pages=3, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1920, the federation broke away to form an independent [[trade union]], the "National Union of Women Teachers" (NUWT).  From this date, members of the central council of the NUWT were not permitted to hold membership of the NUT.  Rank-and-file members were initially permitted to also join the NUT, as the union feared that otherwise its members in rural areas would be isolated.  However, the union discouraged joint membership, and prohibited it in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Partington|first1=Geoffrey|title=Women Teachers in the Twentieth Century in England and Wales|date=1976|publisher=NFER Publishing Company|isbn=0856331007|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NUWT was a [[feminist]] organisation, maintaining close links with other groups and individuals in the [[Feminist movement]].&lt;ref name="PrenticeTheobald1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Sara|editor=Alison L. Prentice; Marjorie R. Theobald|title=Women who Taught: Perspectives on the History of Women and Teaching|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ZvxvBlnMvIC&amp;pg=PA182|year=1991|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-6785-2|pages=182–201|chapter=Feminists in Teaching: The National Union of Women Teachers, 1920-1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main aim was to obtain [[equal pay for women]] but also interested itself in the wide range of issues affecting women teachers including the marriage bar, [[Parental leave|maternity rights]] and family allowances. It was also concerned with [[education]] in its widest sense and took an interest in many issues such as class sizes, [[corporal punishment]], the [[Raising Of School Leaving Age|school leaving age]], teacher training, and wider social and political debates such as [[capital punishment]], the [[minimum wage]] and health policy. 

Membership of the union peaked at 8,500 in the mid-1920s, and thereafter gradually declined.&lt;ref name="oram" /&gt;  In 1961, when equal pay had been achieved, the union wound up.&lt;ref name="DoughanGordon2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doughan|first1=David|last2=Gordon|first2=Peter|title=Dictionary of British Women's Organisations, 1825-1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T423AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-89770-2|page=102|chapter=National Union of Women Teachers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members either joined the NUT or the Association of Assistant Mistresses, while the anti-feminist [[National Association of Schoolmasters]] arranged for the formation of a new [[Union of Women Teachers]].&lt;ref name="ironside"&gt;Mike Ironside and Roger Seifert, ''Industrial Relations in Schools'', p.92&lt;/ref&gt;

Presidents of the union included [[Emily Phipps]], [[Agnes Dawson]], [[Nancy Stewart Parnell]] and [[Nan McMillan]].

The '''New Zealand Educational Institute''' ('''NZEI''', in Maori: Te Riu Roa) is the largest education [[trade union]] in [[New Zealand]]. It was founded in 1883 and has a membership of 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzei.org.nz/NZEI/Aboutus/NZEI/About-Us/Aboutus.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==

The NZEI was founded by a merger of district institutes of teachers in 1883&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Teachers' Organisations — Primary |first= |last= |url= https://teara.govt.nz/en/1966/education-present-administrative-pattern/page-6 |encyclopedia=An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand |date=1966 |publisher= |access-date=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a meeting in [[Christchurch]]. It quickly became the nationwide voice of primary school teachers. Since the 1994 merger with the [[Combined Early Childhood Union of Aotearoa]] (CECUA) it has also represented teachers in early childhood centres. Since the major New Zealand employment law changes in the 1980s and 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Unions and employee organisations - Unions after 1960 |first=Erik |last=Olssen |url= https://teara.govt.nz/en/unions-and-employee-organisations/page-7 |encyclopedia=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date=11 March 2010 |publisher= |access-date=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the NZEI  negotiates the more than twenty collective agreements across the two sectors, including principals, teachers, support staff, [[te reo Maori]] immersion staff and Ministerial staff.&lt;ref name="awards"&gt;https://nzei.org.nz/NZEI/Aboutus.aspx?About_Us=3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early childhood education  ==

Due to the relatively fragmented history and nature of early childhood education in New Zealand, the largest number of collective agreements negotiated by the NZEI are in this sector.&lt;ref name="awards"/&gt;

== Primary schools ==

Primary staff and principals are on separate collective agreements, with separate agreements for area (rural) staff and principals, but these are negotiated together.&lt;ref name="awards"/&gt;

The NZEI has [[Strike action|struck]] four times since it was founded in 1883.&lt;ref name="nzherald4"&gt;{{cite news |title=Teachers' strike today: School's out - All you need to know |first= |last= |url= https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12106964 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=15 August 2018 |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The placards read "We're not going to take it ANYMORE", "It's time to value teachers" and "iTeach, there's no app for that".]]
In 1991 members struck (unsuccessfully) as part of wider industrial and union action against the [[Employment Contracts Act 1991]],&lt;ref name="nzherald4"/&gt; which lead to significant changes in New Zealand employment relations.&lt;ref&gt;https://teara.govt.nz/en/strikes-and-labour-disputes/page-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Members struck in 1994 and 1995 to successfully achieve pay parity with the [[Post Primary Teachers' Association]],&lt;ref name="nzherald4"/&gt; their colleagues in secondary schooling. This related pay scales to the teachers' qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=2350693&lt;/ref&gt;

Members struck in 2018 as part of the negotiation round with the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand]]. Rallies and marches were held in the major cities.&lt;ref name="nzherald4"/&gt;

      <comment>/* Criticism */ On closer reading, that quote is not a criticism of Coughlin. Rather, it is a criticism of the Navy's handling of a different officer's dismissal. Webb's speech expresses no opinion about the validity or otherwise of Coughlin's complaint. As such, I have removed the quote. Since there is nothing left in the section, I have also removed the section.</comment>

Coughlin attended [[Old Dominion University]], where she joined the Reserve Officer Training Corps. She joined the navy in 1984 and became a helicopter pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherrow|first=Victoria|title=Women and the military: an encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=KTZ1TKPwOMSnOPKozMYG&amp;ct=result&amp;id=5JkgAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Paula+coughlin%22+%22old+dominion+university%22&amp;q=%22old+dominion+university%22#search_anchor|year=1996|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended the Tailhook conference in September 1991, organized by former navy aviators at the [[Las Vegas Hilton]]. Many of the attendees got raucously drunk. Coughlin was one of the first female attendees who reported being indecently assaulted by male attendees. Coughlin testified she feared being gang-raped when she was forced to "[[Running the gauntlet#Military custom|run the gauntlet]]".&lt;ref name=NYTimes1994-10-04/&gt; She had reported the incident to senior officers, but after a lack of progress due to "closing ranks and obfuscation," she went public in June 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n9_v24/ai_12530386/pg_1/?tag=content;col1|title=Universal soldier: what Paula Coughlin can teach American women – sexual assault victim demands justice|last=Boo|first=Katherine|date=September 1992|work=Washington Monthly|accessdate=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President, [[George H.W.

'''Pedro "Cuban Pete" Aguilar''' (June 14, 1927 in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] &amp;ndash; January 13, 2009 in [[Miami, Florida]]&lt;ref name=died&gt;[http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/breakingnews/sfl-bn-0113cubanpete,0,4644214.story "Mambo star 'Cuban Pete' dead"]&lt;/ref&gt;) was named "the greatest [[Mambo (dance)|Mambo]] dancer ever" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine and the legendary [[Tito Puente]]. 

Mr. Aguilar received tap-dance training in childhood and had an early career in boxing. He then transitioned to dance; creating a rhythmically complex, visually arresting dancing style that electrified audiences. By his own count he invented 100 signature foot, torso and hand movements with names like the Porpoise, the Shimmy Shimmy and the Prayer.

His nickname, "Cuban Pete," was conferred upon him in 1949 at the famous [[Palladium_Ballroom|Palladium]] dance hall in [[New York City]], in reference to the classic [[Mambo (music)|mambo]]  song "Cuban Pete" by [[Desi Arnaz]]. The moniker was endorsed by Mr. Arnaz himself. In the 1950s, Mr. Aguilar and partner Millie Donay appeared at a British command performance before the Queen. They also danced at the White House; for President Dwight Eisenhower and later for President Lyndon Johnson. Mr. Aguilar also appeared on the popular Jackie Gleason Show. 

Mr. Aguilar won numerous prizes in Latin dancing during the Mambo era, together with his dance partner [[Millie Donay]]. He is a recipient of many prestigious awards for his work, and is the only Latin dancer recognized in the [[Latin Jazz]] exhibit at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

Mr. Aguilar made a career as a dancer, teacher and choreographer. He also worked for Warner Brothers in Los Angeles for many years. As a consultant on the 1992 film "The Mambo Kings", he taught Antonio Banderas and Armand Assante to mambo, and can be seen in several of the dance scenes. 

In 2000, he collaborated with Edward Villella on the ballet “Mambo No. 2 a.m.,” which had its premiere with the Miami City Ballet.

In 2002, a documentary, ''The Lucky Man'' (also entitled Game Boys) by German film-maker Dieter Weihl, featuring Aguilar, premiered at The Tiburon International Film Festival.

Barbara Craddock was his last dance partner (since 1998) and manager. Aguilar and Craddock were both inducted in the International Latin Music Hall of Fame.

On November 14, 2007 it was announced they were the recipients of the Latin Jazz USA Lifetime Achievement Awards at the 2007/08 Ms. Latina International Pageant, with the presentation on December 22, 2007 at the Manuel Artime Theater in Miami, Florida. They were the first Latin dancers to receive this award.

He died January 13, 2009 from heart failure at Sinai Plaza Rehabilitation &amp; Nursing Center, [[Miami]], [[Florida]]. Aguilar is survived by his daughters Denise Gerard and Petrina Aguilar, son Sean P. Aguilar, granddaughter Gina Gerard and grandson Noah.&lt;ref name=died/&gt;

{{Education in the U.S.}}
A '''Praxis test''' is one of a series of [[United States|American]] [[teacher]] [[Professional certification|certification]] [[standardized testing|exams]] written and administered by the [[Educational Testing Service]].  Various Praxis tests are usually required before, during, and after [[teacher training]] courses in the [[United States|U.S.]]

In order to be a teacher in most states in the US, the Praxis test is required. It usually consists of two separate tests, Praxis 1 and 2. In some states, [[alternative teacher certification]] programs allow prospective educators to obtain licensure without taking Praxis tests.

The Praxis I, or '''Pre-Professional Skills Test''' ('''PPST'''), consisted of three exams: reading, writing, and mathematics. On September 1, 2014, ETS transitioned to the Praxis '''"CASE"''' or '''"Core Academic Skills for Educators"''' which also consists of reading, writing, and mathematics exams. These sections can be taken as a combined test or separately. In most colleges and universities, a passing score must be earned for admission to teacher education. In most states, a passing score must be earned before the teacher education graduate can apply for his or her teaching license or certificate.

The Praxis II assessments cover many different subject areas.  Each state requires a different combination of Praxis II exams for certification. In many states, these include a content knowledge and a pedagogy exam. In some states, students must pass these exams before being accepted into the [[student teaching]] component of the program.  Many states use the Praxis II tests as a way to determine [[highly qualified teachers]] status under the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]. The Praxis II School Counseling specialty exam is used by some states as a licensure requirement to practice professional school counseling.

It replaced the National Teacher Examination (NTE), also administered by ETS.

Hui said of himself that he is a "Hong Konger living in America," being "sandwiched between Western and Chinese cultures."&lt;ref name=HKMCartoonist /&gt; After arriving to the United States, beside learning a new language, Hui had most troubles adapting to a different lifestyle: "Hong Kong is a busy place. But the place I lived, Silicon Valley, was so quiet that if you see someone walking down the street at night, you should feel worried."&lt;ref name=HKMCartoonist /&gt; Although, he prefers living in Hong Kong, Hui prefers working in the United States: "They make sure you have enough time to do your job well. I feel attached to that country because it is where I learned all my skills."&lt;ref name=HKMCartoonist /&gt;

[[File:Planetarium in Putnam Gallery 2, 2009-11-24.jpg|thumb|A 1766 Benjamin Martin mechanical model, or [[orrery]], used at Harvard]]
[[File:Jupiter.SouthStation.agr.jpg|thumb|upright|Model of Jupiter at [[South Station]], part of Boston's Solar System trail&lt;ref&gt;http://www.everytrail.com/guide/community-solar-system-trail-boston-museum-of-science&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Solar System models''', especially mechanical models, called ''[[orreries]]'', that illustrate the relative positions and motions of the [[planet]]s and [[moon]]s in the [[Solar System]] have been built for centuries. While they often showed relative sizes, these models were usually not built to scale. The enormous ratio of interplanetary distances to planetary diameters makes constructing a [[scale model]] of the Solar System a challenging task. As one example of the difficulty, the distance between the [[Earth]] and the [[Sun]] is almost 12,000 times the diameter of the Earth.

If the smaller planets are to be easily visible to the naked eye, large outdoor spaces are generally necessary, as is some means for highlighting objects that might otherwise not be noticed from a distance. The objects in such models do not move. Traditional orreries often did move and some used clockworks to make the relative speeds of objects accurate. These can be thought of as being correctly scaled in time instead of distance.

==Scale models in various locations==
Many towns and institutions have built outdoor scale models of the Solar System. Here is a table comparing these models.

Several sets of [[geocaching]] [http://www.geocaching.com/seek/nearest.aspx?key=solar+system&amp;submit4=Go caches have been laid out as solar system models].

==A model based on a classroom globe==
Most classroom [[globe]]s are 41&amp;nbsp;cm (16 inches) in diameter. If the Earth were reduced to this size, the [[Moon]] would be a 10&amp;nbsp;cm (4&amp;nbsp;in) [[baseball]] floating 12 metres (40 feet) away. The Sun would be a [[beach ball]] 14 stories tall (somewhat smaller than the [[Spaceship Earth (Disney)|Spaceship Earth]] ride at [[Epcot]]) floating {{convert|5|km|mi}} away. While a complete model to this scale has never been built, a Solar System built centered in Washington DC, London, or Sydney, to that scale (approximately 1:31&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000) would look like this:

If the scale of the above model is increased to 1:310&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000, i.e. all distances and sizes reduced by a factor of 10, then the Earth and Venus can be modeled by [[ping pong ball]]s, the Moon and smaller planets by various size [[marbles]] or lumps of modeling clay, the gas giants by balloons or larger playing balls, and a circle the diameter of the Sun can be drawn on the floor of most classrooms. The scale distance to [[Alpha Centauri]] would be 1/3 of the way to the Moon.

Some planetaria and related museums often use this type of scale model of the Solar System, with a planetarium dome representing the Sun. Examples of this can be seen in planetaria like the [[Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum]], the [[Hayden Planetarium]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], the [[Clark Planetarium]], the [[Griffith Observatory]], the [[Louisiana Arts and Sciences Museum]], the [[Adventure Science Center]], etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5901">'''The South East Asian Mathematics Competition''' (SEAMC) is a 3-day math competition held in a predesignated location in South East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/a/alice-smith.edu.my/maths-1/maths-competitions/seamc&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a qualifying competition by Competition Academy for invitation to the World Mathematics Championships. This competition embodies the spirit of communication, collaboration, creativity, critical thinking (strategy), content knowledge, character, and cultural competence through the diverse range of competitors and schools from various countries.

==General information==

The location of the SEAMC changes annually. There are now at least two venues used annually.

===Eligibility===

The Senior Competition is open to all students in Grade 12 (Year 13) or younger during the month of the event.

The Junior Competition is open to all students in Grade 9 (Year 10) or younger during the month of the event.

==The competition==

===History===
SEAMC and [[North East Asian Mathematics Competition|NEAMC]] are mathematics collaboration experience for school students located in South or North East Asia to come together for three days.

SEAMC was conceived at the turn of the millennium by Steve Warry, who taught at [[Alice Smith School]], Kuala Lumpur, and believed that mathematics could be a spectator sport. In pursuit of this, he organised the South East Asian Mathematics Competition (SEAMC) for March 2001. He died the week prior to the competition, but the event went ahead. From 2014, the NEAMC sister event has been organised for students in North East Asia.

Currently, [[Singapore American School]] is the only school to have won SEAMC for 4 consecutive years. Lead by student coaches and captains such as A Hyun (Annie) Kim and Rhea Jain, they've managed to place 1st for 3 years and win the Warry Cup in 2018.


===Format===
All WMC qualifying competitions have:
* 3 days of engagement
* 9 equally weighted rounds
* 6 skills categories for prizes
* The best sum ranking across all 9 rounds win

School teams engage within the '''Communication''' skills rounds.

The '''Collaboration''' skills rounds (Open, Lightning and Innovation) are in buddy teams of three&lt;ref&gt;http://competition.ac/competition/competition_59f041fe1b6c12.09521433&lt;/ref&gt;.
The '''Challenge''' are skills rounds undertaken as individuals.

Three skills rounds are (subject specific skills and procedures) '''knowledge''' based,
three are (plan and execute) '''strategy''' focused and three depend upon (new and imaginative ideas) '''creativity'''.

So each strategy, creative and knowledge skill category is engaged in alone, in school teams and in buddy teams.
Past questions can be found around the web.&lt;ref&gt;http://seamc.blogspot.sg/2006/09/past-seamc-questions.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prizes===
There are many prizes to be had, with the most important being the intangibles that one gains from such an experience. On top of that:
* All participants receive a transcript of relative attainment in each of the 9 rounds.
* The highest ranked individuals in each category receive medals.
* The highest ranked individuals across all 9 rounds receive medals.
* The best ranked school team across all 9 rounds receive a respectively named Cup (for the SEAMC Junior competition, this is the original Warry Cup).
The better ranked teams across all of the competition venues that year are invited to the ultimate World Mathematics Championships showdown, hosted by Trinity College, University of Melbourne in the following July each year.

'''TESTfunda.com''' is a [[for-profit education]] website based in [[Mumbai]], [[India]]. In 2008, four [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IIT]] and [[Indian Institutes of Management|IIM]] alumni founded the website.&lt;ref name="[[The Economic Times]]"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nair |first=Priya C |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/features/et-high-flier/e-entrepreneurs-tapping-opportunities-in-internet/articleshow/4956955.cms |title=Article in The Economic Times |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=2009-09-01 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website provides help to students, ranging from career counseling to preparation. It provides assistance for [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]], Bank &amp; Govt. exam preparation for [[Common Admission Test|CAT]], [[Xavier Aptitude Test|XAT]], [[Symbiosis International University|SNAP]], [[Indian Institute of Foreign Trade|IIFT]], NMAT, [[Common Management Admission Test|CMAT]], MH-CET, IBPS &amp; SBI Clerk, IBPS &amp; SBI PO. The company's student base contains fresher students as well as experienced professionals. Mocks &amp; study materials are provided for students   in online, print &amp; android app format.

The website came into the limelight when it became the only website to provide online preparation material and practice tests, after it  was announced that the CAT would be a [[Computer Based Test]]. Various CAT coaching institutes across the country had then entered into a tie-up with the portal to provide computer-based testing services to their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-educationplus/testfunda-courseware-for-cat-preparation/article665079.ece |title=TestFunda courseware for CAT preparation |publisher=The Hindu |date=2009-08-17 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Group School''' was an [[alternative high school]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], [[United States|U.S.]], in the 1970s. Operating under [[democratic school|democratic-school]] principles, the Group School was established primarily to serve students from working-class and low-income backgrounds.

In 1977, the school described its educational themes as "internal democracy" and an "emphasis on helping youth develop a sense of working-class identity and pride." Founders believed that traditional educational approaches undermined working-class identity by forcing working-class students "to deny their neighborhood ties" and "to ignore or denigrate the knowledge they have picked up on the street." The school developed curricula aimed at reversing this process, in part through course units on family, immigration, and labor history and courses emphasized working-class youths' "ability to control their own lives and to change their communities."&lt;ref&gt;Adria Reich and Larry Aaronson, "Neighborhood, Youth and Class: An Introductory High School Course on Ethnic and Class Identity," pamphlet (Cambridge, Mass.: The Group School, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Radical teachers also developed feminist-oriented curricula in concert with female students, in an attempt, as Kathleen Weiler reports, to use "the life experiences of working-class girls to draw out themes of race, class, and gender for critical analysis."&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Weiler, "Feminist Analyses of Gender and Schooling," in ''The Critical Pedagogy Reader'', ed. [[Antonia Darder]], Marta Baltodano, Rodolfo D. Torres (Routledge, 2002), p. 295, n.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Invitational Young Physicists Tournament''' (USIYPT) is an annual physics research and debate tournament for high school students, held the last weekend in January. School-based teams of four students investigate several undergraduate-level research problems in preparation for the tournament.  The competition itself consists of "physics fights," student-led debates over the quality of each team's solution. Teams are judged on their own solutions to the problems and on their ability to engage in evaluation and discussion of other teams' solutions. [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] won their first championship in 2018.  [[The Harker School]] of San Jose, California has earned three championships, the most of any school.  The 2018 tournament at [[Randolph College]] in Virginia involved 15 schools; the 2019 tournament will be at [[Rye Country Day School]] in New York.

== History ==
The United States sent teams to the [[International Young Physicists' Tournament]] several times in the 2000s, and achieved a second-place finish in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.iypt.org/collection/#2005|title=IYPT Archive|year=2012|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nonprofit United States Association for Young Physicists Tournaments was incorporated in 2005, initially for the purpose of supporting and training the US team as well as to spread the pedagogical methodology of preparing and conducting the "physics fight."&lt;ref name="Oldaker 48–51"&gt;{{cite journal

The one-day event at the North Carolina School of Science and Math (NCSSM) included five teams, all from the United States; [[Woodberry Forest School]] won the inaugural championship.&lt;ref name=2007pressrelease&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usaypt.org/NYPT%202007/USAYPT%20pr%2026%20Feb%2007.pdf | title=USAYPT holds annual February tournaments |publisher=United States Association for Young Physicists Tournaments |date=26 February 2007 |accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 tournament, also at NCSSM, included the first "international" team: [[Brisbane Girls Grammar School]]. They faced [[Woodberry Forest School]], a boys' boarding school in central Virginia. In the final physics fight, Brisbane's Sarah Thang and Samantha Luck outdueled Woodberry's Chris McLamb and Robert Bauer for the title.&lt;ref name = "2008 TPT"&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2009 and 2010, the event was moved to Woodberry Forest School. [[Raffles Institution]] of Singapore beat out an eight-team field for the 2009 title.&lt;ref name = "2009 TPT"&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[February 5–6, 2010 North American blizzard|"snowmaggedon" blizzard]] of February forced cancellation of the 2010 tournament.  Instead, two informal mini-tournaments were held in April, one at Woodberry Forest School, one at the [[Harker School]] in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usaypt.org/USIYPT%202010/2010USIYPT.htm|title=2010 USAYPT Young Physicists Tournament|year=2010|accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USIYPT moved to Oak Ridge Associated Universities for 2011 and 2012, and expanded to a two-day, six-round event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The 2014 tournament was held at the Harker School in [[San Jose, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaypt.org/USIYPT%202013/2013%20USIYPT%20Announcement/USIYPT2013%20nationaltournament.htm|title=USIYPT2013 national tournament|publisher=United States Invitational Young Physicists Tournament|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Harker School won the title with playoff victories over Woodberry Forest School and Shenzhen Middle School on the "Magnet Stack" and "Ball Stack" problems.  Guilderland High School of New York won the Clifford Swartz Trophy for best poster.

In 2015, the USIYPT moved back to Woodberry Forest School.  The final rounds were switched to a pool-play format.  The Harker School and Woodberry Forest met twice in those final rounds, with Harker edging Woodberry 79-77 for the 2016 title.  Other finalists included Rye Country Day, who were 1/10 of a point off Woodberry's pace; and first-time USIYPT participant [[RDFZ|Renmin University High School]] of Beijing, China.

Second-year participant [[Phoenixville Area High School]] of Pennsylvania topped the standings after the preliminary rounds in the 2016 USIYPT.  They, Harker, [[Rye Country Day School]], and Shenzhen Middle School  competed in the final rounds, with Shenzhen coasting to the championship.

At the 2017 tournament at the [[University of the Sciences]], the Harker School was the highest ranked of the six teams who entered the playoff rounds.  [[Rye Country Day School]] emerged from those rounds with a convincing victory of 77-72 against [[High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China|RDFZ of Beijing]], due in part to an especially innovative approach to measuring Planck's constant conducted by Charlie Curnin and Kasey Luo in their high school laboratory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://physics.randolphcollege.edu/usaypt/USIYPT%202017/results.html|title=this is copied from Greg Jacobs|website=physics.randolphcollege.edu|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The four presenting members for Rye Country Day School were Charlie Curnin, Jeffrey Chen, Cate Mollerus (captain), and Varun Wadhwa. 

== The Physics Fight ==
The USIYPT consists of six preliminary rounds and a set of final rounds.  In each round, called a "Physics Fight," a student from the reporting team presents a 10-minute summary of their research into one of the four official tournament problems.  Next, a student from another team engages the reporter in a 12-minute conversation about the reporting team's project.  This opponent is charged with helping the audience understand the strengths and weaknesses of the report by means of a series of discussion questions.  Only after this conversation is complete are jury members allowed to question the presenting students directly.  Teams are judged as much on their ability to ask and answer questions in the physics fight as on the quality of their initial presentations.
&lt;ref name="Oldaker 48–51"/&gt;

== Teacher education ==
Unusual among science competitions, the USIYPT aims to improve physics teaching skills as well as student understanding of the subject. High school teachers are participating members of each school's research team. The sponsoring organization chooses problems for each tournament that are "nontrivial, but not impossible," whose solutions are not necessarily unknown to practicing professional physicists, but are generally new to high school teachers and students. Research is expected to be conducted primarily in each team's school, with direction and assistance from a teacher at that school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Albanian '''University of Arts'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keshilliministrave.al/?fq=brenda&amp;m=news&amp;lid=14543 On March 23, 2011 by Decision of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Albania, the Academy of Arts was reorganized and renamed "University of Arts".]&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly known as the '''Academy of Arts''') is the main [[institution]] that offers [[higher education]] in the [[art]]s in [[Albania]].

==History==
Founded in 1966 as the Higher Institute of Arts, it merged three artistic institutions: the Tirana State Conservatory, the Higher School of Fine Arts, and the High School for Actors “Aleksander Moisiu”. The Academy of Arts was able to take advantage of the Russian tradition in [[classical music]] and [[ballet]] due to the fact that Albania and Russia had close relationships during communism. The school still maintains ties with the [[Russian School of Ballet and Classical Music]]. In 1991, the Higher Institute of Arts was promoted to university level and renamed Academy of Arts. On October 12, 2009, the [[President of the Republic of Albania]], [[Bamir Topi]] awarded the Academy of Arts the "Grand Master Order".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.president.al/shqip/info.asp?id=5381 President of the Republic of Albania – News]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
The Academy of Arts has three faculties:
* Faculty of Music. It offers [[major]]s in [[musicology]], [[conducting]], [[Musical composition|composition]], [[piano]], [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], [[double bass]], [[guitar]], [[flute]], [[oboe]], [[clarinet]], [[trombone]], [[trumpet]], [[accordion]], [[bassoon]], [[Horn (instrument)|horn]], [[tuba]], [[canto]], and [[pedagogy]], and has two [[academic department]]s

University courses are taught at all four locations. The Albacete campus houses Faculties of [[Medicine]], [[Economics|Economic]] and [[Business]] Sciences, [[Law]] and [[Humanities]]. The Schools of [[Agronomical Engineering]], [[Computer Science]] Engineering, [[Industrial Engineering]], [[Nursing]], [[Teacher education|Teacher Training]] and [[Employment Relations]] are also based there. Ciudad Real is home to the Faculties of [[Chemicals|Chemical Sciences]], Law and [[Social Sciences]], [[Arts]], the Higher Technical Schools of [[Civil Engineering]], [[Information Technology]], Industrial Engineering; a Technical Institute of [[Agriculture]]; the Polytechnic University School of Almadén; a University School of Nursing; a University School of Teacher Training; and the Puertollano Centre for University Studies.

[[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]] has the Faculty of Social Sciences, the Faculty of [[Fine Art]], the Faculty of [[Science education|Educational Science]] and Humanities, the Polytechnic University School of Technical [[Architecture]]; the Polytechnic University School of IT in [[Telecommunications]]; the University School of Nursing; the University School of Teacher Training, and the University School of [[Social Work]].

The '''Wrocław University of [[Economics]]''' ''(Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny we Wrocławiu)'' is one of ten public [[university|universities]] located in [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]]. Originally established in 1947 as a private business school (then named ''Wyższa Szkoła Handlowa'', or "Trade College"), it was nationalized in 1954 under the name ''Wyższa Szkoła Ekonomiczna'', "College of Economics"). In October 1974 it was named  after the Polish economist [[Oskar Lange]], although his name does not occur in the official English name of the university. Changing the name to the Wrocław University of Economics ''(Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny we Wrocławiu)'' in 2008 removed [[Oskar Lange]] from the name of the University.

The main campus with three out of four departments is located on Ulica Komandorska near the center of Wrocław, whereas one faculty (Regional Economy and Tourism) resides in a separate campus in [[Jelenia Góra]].

The university comprises the following schools (faculties):
*School of Economic Sciences
*School of Engineering and Economics
*School of Management, Computer Science and Finance
*School of Regional Economy and Tourism (Jelenia Góra)

Altogether it employs 784 academic teachers including 142 professors. There is strong interest in economic studies, in the current academic year  the University has about 17,000 students, and so far it has produced over 70,000 graduates.
