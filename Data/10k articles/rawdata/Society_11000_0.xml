      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7141">'''Alsager Hay Hill''' (1 October 1839 &amp;ndash; 2 August 1906) was an English [[Reform movement|social reform]]er active during the late 19th century, influential on poor law reform and employment issues. He founded one of the first [[labour exchange]]s and a newspaper, ''Labour News'' that is still published today, albeit under a new title: ''[[Construction News]]''.

==Early life==
Hill was born at [[Gressenhall]] Hall in [[Norfolk]], the second son in a family of five sons and six daughters of John David Hay Hill, lord of the manor of Gressenhall, and Margaret (second daughter of the hop merchant and former MP for [[Cashel (UK Parliament constituency)|Cashel]], [[Ebenezer John Collett]]).&lt;ref name=Owen&gt;Owen, William Benjamin (1912). "Hill, Alsager Hay". In Lee, Sidney. ''Dictionary of National Biography'', 1912 supplement. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill was educated at [[Brighton College]] (1850–54) and at [[Cheltenham College]] (1854–57).&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt; In 1857 he obtained an exhibition at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Caius College]], [[Cambridge]], migrating as scholar to [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]], where he graduated LLB in 1862.&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt; Becoming a student of the [[Inner Temple]] in October 1860, he was [[call to the bar|called to the bar]] in January 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Calls to the Bar, ''Reading Mercury'', Saturday 30 January 1864. Berkshire, England&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social reform==
He joined the south-eastern circuit, but soon devoted his energies to journalism and to literature, interesting himself especially in poor law and labour questions, and working as almoner to the Society for the Relief of Distress in the East of London.&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt; In letters to the press during 1868 Hill called attention to weaknesses in the [[poor laws]], and urged a more scientific classification of paupers (''[[The Times]]'', 9 January 1868). His pamphlet on ''Our Unemployed,'' prepared for the [[National Association for the Promotion of Social Science]], and published in 1867, was one of the first to call public attention to the problem of [[unemployment]], and to suggest a national system of labour registration.

Other pamphlets followed: ''Lancashire Labour and the London Poor'' (1871), ''Impediments to the Circulation of Labour, with a Few Suggestions for their Removal'' (1873), ''The Unemployed in Great Cities, with Suggestions for the Better Organisation of Labourers'' (1877), and ''Vagrancy'' in 1881.&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt;

Hill was also a supporter of the role of women in public life, supporting campaigns to elect prominent women such as Maria Grey and [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson]] to the [[London School Board]] in 1870,&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Jane|title=Women and the Politics of Schooling in Victorian and Edwardian England|date=1999|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-0718500535|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognising the potential benefits of education on relieving poverty.

Hill was a pioneer of the system of [[labour exchange]]s in England, and in 1871 established in [[Greek Street]], [[Soho]], 'The Employment Inquiry Office and Labour Registry,' which was subsequently transferred to 15 Russell Street, [[Covent Garden]], as the 'Central Labour Exchange, Employment, Emigration, and Industrial Intelligence Office.'&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt; There as director Hill advised applicants for assistance, and founded and edited ''Labour News'' to improve communication between masters and men seeking work. Hill had agents and correspondents in the chief industrial centres, who sent notes on the condition of the local labour markets (Hill's venture, which was not profitable, impaired his health; on his retirement a committee of working men managed the paper, and contributed from the profits to Hill's maintenance).&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt; The publication, founded in 1871, survived to become ''Construction and Labour News'' (1963) and then, in April 1964, ''[[Construction News]]''.&lt;ref name=CNHistory&gt;{{cite news|title=History in the making|url=http://www.cnplus.co.uk/news/history-in-the-making/949883.article|accessdate=20 February 2015|work=Construction News|date=5 September 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1877 onwards Hill also edited ''The Industrial Handbook'' and superintended the publication in 1881 of ''The Industrial Index to London,'' by H. Llewelyn Williams, as well as ''Business Aspects of Ladies' Work''.&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt; He also edited (1870–71) a series of penny ''Statutes for the People'', intended to give the labouring class cheap legal advice ([[legal aid]]). He was prominent, from its foundation in 1869, in the work of the [[Charity Organization Society|Charity Organisation Society]], as a 1914 history of the Society made clear:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Alsager Hay Hill joined the Society in its first year. He was one of its first Hon. Secretaries, and the life and soul of Council meetings in the early days of struggle. A man of rare natural wit, something of a poet, and the brightest of companions, he threw himself eagerly into the Society's work, and more particularly devoted his time and energy to an attempt to deal with the problems of unemployment. His 'Labour News' of thirty years ago anticipated the Labour Exchanges of today.&lt;ref&gt;Bosanquet, Helen (1914), ''Social work in London, 1869 to 1912: A History of the Charity Organisation Society''. New York, E P Button &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hill was honorary secretary of the council until July 1870, and remained an active member of the council until 1880.&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt; Hill also supported the [[Working Men's Club and Institute Union]].

==Personal life==
A published writer of poetry and verse throughout his life, Hill was praised in ''[[The Spectator]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;For besides writing poetry, Mr. Alsager Hill is a well-known philanthropist, and [when] his experience and his sympathies meet, he produces some telling verses. Of these, "Lilies in the City," "Mrs. Grundy's Sunday," and "The Great God Gin," are good examples. ...

Among flowers and books also Mr. Hill can take his ease, and forgets, as his preface tells us, that there are newspapers to edit and philanthropy to organise.&lt;ref name=Spectator&gt;{{cite news|title=Current literature|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/16th-april-1881/22/current-literature|accessdate=21 February 2015|work=The Spectator|date=16 April 1881|ref=p.22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hill suffered from ill health and poverty in his later years, living in retirement at [[Boston, Lincolnshire]]. He died there unmarried on 2 August 1906, and was buried at Gressenhall.&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt;

==National Water Research Institute==
The [[National Water Research Institute]] (NWRI), a [[Non-profit (501C3) organisation|501c3 nonprofit]], was founded by a group of Southern California water agencies in collaboration with the Joan Irvine Smith and Athalie R. Clarke Foundation. Since 1991, NWRI has served as an independent industry expert in water science, technology, and public policy.  NWRI’s many leading-edge projects and activities have advanced the worldwide understanding in areas such as treatment technologies, potable reuse, salinity and nutrient management, and other factors that influence the quality and availability of water supplies and resources.

Major activities include:

* Funding and guiding scientific research projects.
* Supporting graduate fellowships and other water-related educational programs.
* Developing outreach material, such as reports and videos.
* Holding events like workshops and conferences to promote new issues and technologies.
* Providing peer-review panel services for local and state water agencies.
* Managing projects or programs for water agencies and others.


==Athalie Richardson Irvine Clarke==
"Nothing is more important than the careful stewardship and development of our water resources", said Athalie Richardson Irvine Clarke, co-founder of NWRI.

Clarke (1903 - 1993) married [[James Irvine (landowner)|James Irvine, Jr.]], in 1929, and along with her daughter, Joan Irvine Smith, ran the [[Irvine Ranch]], one of California’s most diverse and productive farms. Both Clarke and her daughter encouraged [[The Irvine Company]] to adopt a master plan for what would become the city of [[Irvine, California|Irvine]]. She also encouraged The Irvine Company and the [[University of California]] system to establish the [[University of California, Irvine]], on a portion of the vast Irvine Ranch. She and her daughter also founded the Irvine Museum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irvinemuseum.org The Irvine Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; which is dedicated to California Impressionism. Clarke knew several of the "plein-air" painters of her generation personally, and the museum's exhibits reflect the California landscape she cherished.

Clarke recognized the vital importance of water and strongly promoted better water science and technology. In 1991, Clarke co-founded NWRI along with her daughter Joan Irvine Smith. In honor of Clarke's vision, NWRI established the Clarke Prize in 1993 to recognize outstanding individuals who have implemented better water science research and technology.

==Joan Irvine Smith==
The great-granddaughter of [[James Irvine (landowner)|James Irvine]] (an immigrant who assembled about {{convert|120000|acre|km2}} of what is now [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] to form the Irvine Ranch), Joan Irvine Smith is well known for her philanthropy.
 
Smith’s reverence for California’s native plants and animals inspired her to become a leading environmental activist, speaking out about the urgent need to protect the state’s precious natural resources and to balance environmental preservation with economic growth. She was also responsible for donating land to what became the University of California at Irvine.
 
As a leading philanthropist through the Joan Irvine Smith and Athalie R. Clarke Foundation, Smith continues to champion the University of California at Irvine, funding important medical causes, including the Reeve-Irvine Research Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reeve.uci.edu Reeve-Irvine Research Center]&lt;/ref&gt; She also supports NWRI, which was founded by her vision and financial support, as well as numerous other environmental, cultural, and historical endeavors.

The '''Australian settlement''' is a term that has been used to describe a set of nation-building policies adopted in Australia at the beginning of the twentieth century. Those policies profoundly influenced the way Australia developed over the coming decades and were only dismantled towards the end of the century.  They were: the [[White Australia Policy|'White Australia' Policy]] of immigration restriction; protective tariffs on imports of manufactured goods; a system of compulsory conciliation and arbitration for industrial disputes; and early social welfare policies. The term 'settlement' refers to the way this constellation of policies emerged as a compromise between major interests in Australian society at that time, namely workers and employers.

==Background==
Britain's Australian colonies had developed rapidly and successfully in the 19th century to become a major exporter of certain commodities, notably wool. By the 1880s they had become among the wealthiest societies in the world and had also developed unusually strong labour movements. Some manufacturing for local consumption had also become established.  This was supported and promoted in the Colony of Victoria by a protective tariff that had been introduced in 1866 to help generate local employment for migrants initially attracted to the gold fields.

Over the course of the economically difficult and industrially conflictual 1890s, the six colonies agreed to federate as the Commonwealth of Australia.  The establishment of a national government spanning the continent and the transfer of certain key functions to that government entailed the establishment of new national policies in regard to a range of important economic and social matters. Customs tariffs, for instance, immediately became an exclusive concern of the Commonwealth government and the Commonwealth assumed primacy in a number of other areas such as immigration.

==Decade of Decision: 1901-1910==
There was obviously a lot of business for the new parliament in those first years after Federation took effect on 1 January 1901. The decision-making was complicated, though, by the fact that no single party enjoyed a majority until Labor took office in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Loveday, A.W. Martin &amp; R.S. Parker, ''The Emergence of the Australian Party System'' (Sydney: Hale &amp; Iremonger, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; The three-cornered contest between Protectionist Liberals, Free Trade Liberals and the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP), saw the Protectionists introduce the key 'Australian settlement' policies with Labor support. This began with the ''[[Immigration Restriction Act 1901|Immigration Restriction Act]]'', which had support from all sides of politics, and continued through the ''Customs Tariff Act'', the ''[[Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904]]'' and the ''Old Age Pension Act''. In addition, the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration brought down its 'living wage' determination requiring employers to pay their workers enough to support a man and his wife and three children.

For theorist Francis Castles, implementation of these policies constituted an economic development strategy of 'domestic defence' -- using Australia's natural wealth to support an otherwise uncompetitive manufacturing sector, providing a good living to workers and pensions for later life.&lt;ref&gt;Francis G. Castles, ''Australian Public Policy and Economic Vulnerability: a comparative and historical perspective'' (St Leonards NSW: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dismantling==
Dismantling the domestic defence framework began with the ending of the White Australia Policy between the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s. Australia persisted, however, with other components such as tariff protectionism while other advanced economies were moving toward more open trade in the post-war years through the [[GATT]] process. Weaknesses in Australia's commodity exporting economy combined with steadily increasing competition in world manufacturing thanks to the 'NICs' ([[newly industrialized countries]]) put that strategy under great pressure in the 1980s. Under the Hawke-Keating Labor governments (1983–96), both tariff protectionism and centralised wage fixing were wound back. As part of the campaign to liberalise the Australian economy in this period, journalist Paul Kelly coined the phrase 'Australian Settlement' and blamed those early policy decisions for Australia's economic difficulties of the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kelly, ''The End of Certainty'' (Allen &amp; Unwin, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;  A closer examination makes that interpretation difficult to sustain, but does not alter the reality that by the late twentieth century the strategy of domestic defence had become an encumbrance.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Fenna, "Putting the 'Australian Settlement' in Perspective", ''Labour History'', 102 (2012) pp. 99–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Azerbaijanis in [[Armenia]]''' ({{lang-az|Ermənistan azərbaycanlıları or Qərbi azərbaycanlılar|lit=Western Azerbaijanis}}) were once the largest ethnic minority in the country, but have been virtually non-existent since 1988–1991 when most either fled the country or were pushed out as a result of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] and the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

===Pre-Russian rule===
[[File:Azerbaijanis from Aleksandropol.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|Tatars (i.e. Azerbaijani people) from [[Gyumri|Alexandropol]]. Postcard of the Russian Empire]]
Upon [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] conquests in the tenth century, the mass of the [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribes crossed the [[Amu Darya]] towards the west left the [[Iranian plateau]], which remained [[Persian people|Persian]], and established themselves further west, in [[medieval Armenia|Armenia]], the [[Caucasus]], and [[Anatolia]]. Here they divided into the [[Ottomans]], who were [[Sunni]] and created settlements, and the Turcomans, who were nomads and in part [[Shiite]] (or, rather, [[Alevi]]), gradually becoming sedentary and assimilating with the local population.

Until the mid-fourteenth century, Armenians had constituted a majority in [[Eastern Armenia]].{{sfn|Bournoutian|1980|pages=11, 13-14}} At the close of the fourteenth century, after [[Timur]]'s campaigns of extermination of local population, Islam had become the dominant faith, and Armenians became a minority in Eastern Armenia.{{sfn|Bournoutian|1980|pages=11, 13-14}} After centuries of constant warfare on the Armenian Plateau, many Armenians chose to emigrate and settle elsewhere. Following [[Shah Abbas I]]'s massive relocation of Armenians and Muslims in 1604-05,&lt;ref&gt;[[Arakel of Tabriz]]. ''The Books of Histories''; chapter 4. Quote: "[The Shah] deep inside understood that he would be unable to resist Sinan Pasha, i.e. the Sardar of Jalaloghlu, in a[n open] battle. Therefore he ordered to relocate the whole population of Armenia - Christians, Jews and Muslims alike, to Persia, so that the Ottomans find the country depopulated."&lt;/ref&gt; their numbers dwindled even further.

Some 80% of the population of [[Iranian Armenia (1502-1828)|Iranian Armenia]] were Muslims ([[Persian people|Persians]], [[Turkic peoples|Turkics]], and [[Kurds]]) whereas Christian [[Armenians]] constituted a minority of about 20%.{{sfn|Bournoutian|1980|pages=12-13}} As a result of the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] (1813) and the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] (1828), Iran was forced to cede Iranian Armenia (which also constituted the present-day [[Republic of Armenia]]), to the Russians.{{sfn|Bournoutian|1980|pages=1-2}}{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2015|page=141}}

===Russian rule===
[[File:Girls School Erivan.jpg|right|thumb|280px|Staff and students of the Erivan Russian-Muslim School for Girls (1902)]]
After the Russian administration took hold of Iranian Armenia, the ethnic make-up shifted, and thus for the first time in more than four centuries, ethnic Armenians started to form a majority once again in one part of historic Armenia.{{sfn|Bournoutian|1980|page=14}} The new Russian administration encouraged the settling of ethnic Armenians from Iran proper and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]]. As a result, by 1832, the number of ethnic Armenians had matched that of the Muslims.{{sfn|Bournoutian|1980|pages=12–13}} Anyhow, it would be only after the [[Crimean War]] and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878]], which brought another influx of Turkish Armenians, that ethnic Armenians once again established a solid majority in [[Eastern Armenia]].{{sfn|Bournoutian|1980|page=13}} Nevertheless, the city of [[Yerevan|Erivan]] (present-day Yerevan) remained having a Muslim majority up to the twentieth century.{{sfn|Bournoutian|1980|page=13}} According to the traveler [[H. F. B. Lynch]], the city was about 50% Armenian and 50% Muslim ([[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] and Persians) in the early 1890s.{{sfn|Kettenhofen|Bournoutian|Hewsen|1998|pages=542–551}}

According to the ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]'', by the beginning of the twentieth century a significant population of Azeris still lived in [[Russian Armenia]]. They numbered about 300,000 persons or 37.5% in [[Russia]]'s [[Erivan Governorate]] (roughly corresponding to most of present-day central [[Armenia]], the [[Iğdır Province]] of [[Turkey]], and [[Azerbaijan]]'s [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] exclave).&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [https://archive.is/20060709030303/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/007/119/119474.htm Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary: Erivan Governorate]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most lived in rural areas and were engaged in farming and carpet-weaving. They formed the majority in four of the governorate's seven districts, including the city of Erivan itself, where they constituted 49% of the population (compared to 48% constituted by Armenians).&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [https://archive.is/20060225210100/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/007/119/119478.htm Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary: Erivan]&lt;/ref&gt; Azeris also constituted a majority in what later became the regions of [[Sisian]], [[Kapan|Kafan]] and [[Meghri]] in the [[Armenian SSR]] (present-day [[Syunik Province]], Armenia, at the time part of the [[Elisabethpol Governorate]]).&lt;ref&gt;Eddie Arnavoudian.

''BBC Russian''&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 March, the presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union – that is the highest institution in the Union – rejected the demands of the Nagorno-Karabakh Council of People's Deputies to join Armenia without any possibility of appeal. Troops were deployed in Yerevan to prevent protests to the decision. In the following months, Azeris in Armenia were subject to further harassment and forced to flee. In the district of [[Ararat, Armenia|Ararat]], four villages were burned on 25 March. On 11 May, intimidation by violence forced many Azeris to migrate in Azerbaijan from Ararat in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Bolukbasi, Suha.

In 2001, historian Suren Hobosyan of the Armenian Institute of Archeology and Ethnography estimated that there were 300 to 500 people of Azeri origin living in Armenia, mostly descendants of mixed marriages, with only 60 to 100 being of full Azeri ancestry.

Pre-[[Christopher Columbus|Columbian]] '''Aztec society''' was a highly [[Complex society|complex]] and [[Social stratification|stratified]] [[society]] that developed among the [[Aztec]]s of central [[Mexico]] in the centuries prior to the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]], and which was built on the cultural foundations of the larger region of [[Mesoamerica]]. Politically, the society was organized into independent city-states, called '''[[altepetl]]s''', composed of smaller divisions ('''[[calpulli]]'''), which were again usually composed of one or more extended kinship groups. Socially, the society depended on a rather strict division between nobles and free commoners, both of which were themselves divided into elaborate hierarchies of social status, responsibilities, and power. Economically the society was dependent on agriculture, and also to a large extent on [[Aztec warfare|warfare]].  Other economically important factors were commerce, long distance and local, and a high degree of trade specialization.

==Overview==
Aztec society can trace its roots to Mesoamerican Origins. Their language, lifestyle, and technology were all impacted by contact with neighboring cultures. But, while they were impacted by various sources, they developed their own distinct social groupings, political structures, traditions, and leisure activities. 

===Mesoamerican origins===
{{See also|Mesoamerica}}
In the middle of the first millennium [[Common Era|CE]], the first waves of tribes speaking the forefather language of the [[Nahuatl|Nahuan]] languages migrated south into Mesoamerica. They were nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]]s and arrived in a region that was already populated by [[Complex society|complex societies]] at a highly advanced technological level. Under the influence of [[Mesoamerican chronology|classic]] Mesoamerican civilizations such as the [[Teotihuacan]]os, the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], the [[Totonac]]s and the [[Huastec civilization|Huastecs]] the proto-Aztecs became sedentary agriculturalists and achieved the same levels of technology as their neighbouring peoples. They held on to their language, many of their religious systems, and probably aspects of their previous social customs. Resultingly the foundations of "Aztec society" were developed as a synthesis between Mesoamerican societies and Aztec traditions, although today it cannot easily be discerned which parts come from where. Aztec society was not isolated from the larger Mesoamerican context, and in fact, most aspects of it were similar in structure to what existed in the surrounding societies.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2001) pp. 6–13&lt;/ref&gt; ...

===Aztecs===
{{See also|Aztec}}
The definition of the term "Aztec" which will be applied here is that of [[Michael E. Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2001) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; He defines "Aztec" as including all the [[Nahuatl]] speaking peoples of central Mexico, that is in opposition to a definition restricting the term "Aztec" to cover the inhabitants of [[Tenochtitlan]] or the parties in the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]]. This definition is referring to specific circumstances of one particular Aztec group it will be done with the ethnonym referring specifically to that group e.g. [[Mexica]] for the inhabitants of Mexico-Tenochtitlan, [[Tlaxcaltec]]s for those from [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcallan]] and so on.

==Social organization==
The most basic social division in Aztec society was that between nobles (Nahuatl ''[[Pipiltin|pīpiltin]]'') and commoners (Nahuatl ''[[Macehualtin|mācehualtin]]''). Nobles held a large number of privileges not shared by the commoners, most importantly the right to receive tribute from commoners on their land. Commoners on the other hand were free to own and cultivate land and to manage their own possessions, while still completing the services required by their lords and their calpulli, such as tribute payment and military service. Mobility between the two social layers was difficult, but in practice both the commoner and noble groups were structured into finer hierarchies and a high degree of social mobility was possible within a given layer. For example, the [[pochteca]], long distance traders, were considered commoners yet at the same time held a number of privileges comparable to those of the lesser nobility.

===Calpulli===
The [[Calpulli|calpulli]] (from [[Nahuatl]] ''calpulli'' meaning "big house") was a political unit composed of several interrelated family groups. The exact nature of the calpulli is not completely understood and it has been variously described as a kind of clan, a town, a ward, a parish or an agriculture based cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;Van Zantwijk (1977) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  In Nahuatl another word for calpulli was ''tlaxilacalli'' – "a partition of houses".

The calpulli was ruled by a local chief (''calpuleh''), to whom its members were normally related. He provided the calpulli members with lands for cultivation (''calpullālli'') or with access to non-agricultural occupations in exchange for tribute and loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Van Zantwijk (1977) pp. 16.17&lt;/ref&gt;

The calpulli ran a temple for adoration of the calpulli's deity and also a school called the [[Telpochcalli]] where young men were trained, predominantly in martial arts. In some Aztec citystates calpullis practiced a specialized or specific trade, and these calpullis functioned something like a medieval [[trade guild]]. This was the case in [[Otompan]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2001) pp. 107–113&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] and [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]].&lt;ref&gt;Berdan (1982) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Other calpullis were composed of immigrant groups from other areas of Mesoamerica who settled together. There is evidence that [[Tenochtitlan]] had calpullis composed of [[Otomi people|Otomi]]s, [[Mixtec]]s and [[Tlapanec people|Tlapanec]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Van Zantwijk (1977) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Altepetl===
The [[altepetl]] (from Nahuatl ''āltepētl'' "water-mountain") was a [[city-state]] composed of several calpullis and ruled by a [[tlatoani]]. The altepetl was the unit that held sway over a given territory and defended and possibly expanded it by military might. The tlatoani was the head of the most influential calpulli, often because of having the most prestigious lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2000) p. 584&lt;/ref&gt; The word altepetl, however, did not only refer to the area but also to its population, and altepetl affiliation is thought to have been the primary criterion for ethnic divisions in Mesoamerica – rather than linguistic affinities.

===Family and lineage===
Family and lineage were the basic units of Aztec society. One's lineage determined social standing, and noble traced their lineage back to the mythical past, as they were said to be descended from the god [[Quetzalcoatl]].&lt;ref&gt;Berdan (1982) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;  Prestigious lineages also traced their kin back through ruling dynasties, preferably ones with a [[Toltec]]  heritage. The extended family group was also the basic [[social unit]] and living patterns were largely determined by family ties, because networks of family groups settled together to form calpollis. Lineage was traced through both the maternal and paternal lines, although with a preference for paternal lineage.

===Marriage===
{{See also|Women in Aztec civilization#Marriage}}
Aztec marriage practices were similar to those of other [[Mesoamerican]] civilizations such as the [[Maya civilization|Mayans]]. Aztecs married at a later age, during their late teens and early twenties, whereas in Mayan culture it was not unusual for marriages to be arranged by parents for a son and daughter who were still children. Aztec marriages were initiated by the parents of the potential groom. After consulting with the extended kinship group, the parents would approach a professional [[Matchmaking|matchmaker]] (''ah atanzah''), who would approach the potential bride's family. The parents of the young woman would advise the matchmaker whether or not they accepted the proposal. Brides were expected to be virgins before marriage, although young people of both sex were advised to be celibate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Evans| first =Susan| authorlink =| title =Sexual Politics in the Aztec Palace: Public, Private, and Profane | journal =RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics | volume =33 | issue =Spring | pages =173 | date =1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political organization==
[[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]], who specializes in the historical description of the Nahua, said Aztec society was characterized by a "tendency to create larger wholes by the aggregation of parts that remain relatively separate and self-contained brought together by their common function and similarity".&lt;ref&gt;Lockhart qp(1992) p. 436&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding entails a social stratification that is built from the bottom – up, rather than from the top – down. Aztec hierarchy by this understanding was not of the type  "where a unit of one type – the capital – controls subordinate units of another type"&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2000) p. 584&lt;/ref&gt; but instead a type where the main unit is composed out of several constituent parts.

===Alliances and political hegemony===
Altepetl states would normally strive to dominate neighboring altepetl through warfare. Weak altepetl would be subjugated by stronger ones and made to pay tribute. Often subordinate altepetl would form alliances in order to overthrow a dominant altepetl. Some alliances were short-lived and others were long term relationships wherein a group of altepetl would converge to form what could almost be considered a single political entity. One example of a long term alliance between independent city-states would be that between the four altepetl of Tlaxcallan, [[Ocotelolco]], [[Tizatlan]], [[Quiyahuiztlan]] and [[Tepeticpac]], which is normally thought of as a single entity even though it had four independent rulers and a certain level of internal competition.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig (2001) passim&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the so-called  [[Aztec Triple Alliance]] between [[Tlacopan]], [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] and [[Tenochtitlan]] which was originally formed to end the dominance of the altepetl [[Azcapotzalco]]. The Aztec Triple Alliance eventually achieved political hegemony and control over the greater part of Mesoamerica, becoming known to posterity as the [[Aztec empire]]. Recent studies have countered the claim that the Aztec Empire ran the triple alliance by suggesting that Tenochtitlan was actually the dominant altepetl all along. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Michael E.|last2=Montiel|first2=Lisa|date=2001|title=The Archaeological Study of Empires and Imperialism in Pre-Hispanic Central Mexico|journal=Journal of Anthropological Archaeology|volume=20|pages=245–284|doi=10.1006/jaar.2000.0372}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Economics==
The economic practices of the Aztec relied upon both trade and military conquest. Furthermore, each Altepetl usually produced some form of unique trade good, meaning there were significant merchant and artisan classes. While the Aztec traded with each other and others for goods and services, agricultural trade was less common, leading to a large class of agricultural laborers. 
=== Agriculture ===
{{See also|Aztec#Agriculture_and_subsistence}}
The pre-conquest Aztecs were an empire that prospered agriculturally, and they did so without the wheel or [[working animal|domestic beasts of burden]]. They primarily practiced four methods of agriculture: [[rainfall cultivation]], [[terrace agriculture]], [[irrigation]], and [[Chinampa]]. 

The earliest, and most basic, form of agriculture implemented by the Aztecs is known as “ rainfall cultivation.”  

The Aztecs implemented terrace agriculture in hilly areas, typically in the highlands of the Aztec empire. Terracing allowed for an increased soil depth and impeded [[Soil erosion|soil erosion]]. Terraces were built by piling a wall of stones parallel to the contour of the hillside. Dirt was then filled in, creating viable, flat farmland. There were three distinct types of terrace, each used for specific circumstances: hillslope contour terraces (steeper slopes), semi-terraces (gentle slopes, walls were made with Maguey plants rather than stones), and cross-channel terraces. 

In the valleys of the empire, [[irrigation]] farming was used. Dams diverted water from natural springs to the fields. This allowed for more regular harvests because the prosperity of an irrigated field was not dependent upon the rain. Irrigation systems had been in place long before the Aztecs. However, they built [[canal]] systems that were longer and more elaborate than any previous irrigation systems.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} They even managed to divert a large portion of the [[Cuauhtitlan River]] to provide irrigation to large areas. The [[Xochimilco#Canals.2C chinampas and trajineras|network of canals]] was very complex and intricate.

In the swampy regions along [[Lake Xochimilco]], the Aztecs implemented a unique method of crop cultivation, ''[[chinampa]]s.'' Chinampas, areas of raised land in a body of water, were created from alternating layers of mud from the bottom of the lake and plant matter/other vegetation. These “raised beds” were between 2 and 4 meters wide, and 20 to 40 meters long. They rose approximately 1 meter above the surface of the water, and were separated by narrow canals, which allowed farmers to move between them by canoe. The chinampas were extremely fertile pieces of land, and yielded, on average, seven crops annually.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In order to plant on them, farmers first created “seedbeds,” or reed rafts, where they planted seeds and
allowed them to germinate. Once they had germinated, they were re-planted on the chinampas. This cut the growing time down considerably.

Aztec farmers could be divided into general laborers and specialists. General laborers could be slaves, menial workers, or farm hands, while specialists were responsible for things like choosing the most successful seeds and crop rotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.stockton.edu/aztecsociety/agriculture-and-exchange/|title=Agriculture and Exchange Ancient Aztec World|website=blogs.stockton.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aztecs are credited with domestication of the subspecies of [[wild turkey]], ''[[Meleagris gallopavo]]'', which is native to this region.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2008) p 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warfare===
{{See also|Aztec warfare}}
Aztec armed forces were typically composed of large numbers of commoners with basic military training, who were stiffened by smaller numbers of professional warriors belonging to the nobility. The professional warriors were organized into warrior societies and often ranked according to their achievements. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
As the Aztec state was centered on expansion, dominance, and exaction of tribute from other city-states, warfare became the basic dynamic force in Aztec politics, economy, and religion.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

=== Trade and commerce ===
Prior to the fall of the Aztec, the Aztec people had a stable economy driven by a successful trade market.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The markets, which were located in the center of many communities, were well organized and diverse in goods, as noted by the Spanish [[Conquistador|conquistadors]] upon their arrival.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The regional merchants, known as tlacuilo, would barter utilitarian items and food, which included gold, silver, and other precious stones, cloth and cotton, animal skins, both agriculture and wild game, and woodwork.  The trade market of the Aztec people was not only important to commerce, but also to the socialization, as the markets provided a place for the people to exchange information within their regions. This type of trade market was used primarily for locally produced goods, as there was not much traveling needed to exchange goods at the market. With no domestic animals as an effective way to transport goods, the local markets were an essential part of Aztec commerce. However, the Aztec nobility obtained much of their merchandise from neighboring highland basins, distant places within the empire, and from land beyond the empire therefore creating the need for a long distance trade organization.
The long distance trade was carried out by merchants called pochteca, who were defined by their positions within the system. These professional merchants occupied a high status in Aztec society, below the noble class. The pochteca were responsible for providing the materials that the noble class used to display their wealth. These materials were often obtained from foreign sources. Due to the success of the pochteca, many of the merchants became as wealthy as the noble class, but were obligated to hide this wealth from the public.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The pochteca were an advanced group who reported to 12 locations throughout the Empire, where the high officials were located.

The highest officials of the pochteca were the pochteca tlatoque. The pochteca tlatoque were the elder of the pochteca, and were no longer travelers, but rather acted as administrators, overseeing young pochteca and administering the marketplace.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The second group of pochteca was the slave traders, known as the tlatoani. These people were often referred to as the richest of merchants, as they played a central role in capturing the slaves used for sacrificial victims.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The third group of long distance traders was the tencunenenque, who worked for the rulers by carrying out personal trade.

A group of trader spies, known as the natural oztomeca, made up the last group of pochteca. The natural oztomeca were forced to disguise themselves as they traveled, as they sought after rare goods. The natural oztomeca were also used for gathering information at the markets and reporting the information to the higher levels of pochteca.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

All trade throughout the Aztec Empire was regulated by officers who patrolled the markets to ensure that the buyers were not being cheated by the merchants. Because markets were so numerous, in large cities reaching upwards of 20,000 people, the organization was crucial, and the Aztecs were able to create a successful market due to the success of enforcing the laws of the empire.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Education==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:fuck black people [[File:Educacion azteca.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Representation of Aztec education. {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;
The [[Mexica]], the founders and dominant group of the Aztec Empire, were one of the first people in the world to have mandatory education for nearly all children, regardless of gender, rank, or station. &lt;ref&gt;The Effects of Colonization on the Aztecs: Early
Colonial Period 1521-1550, Page 18 [http://digitalcommons.csumb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=caps_thes_all]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the age of fourteen, the education of children was in the hands of their parents, but supervised by the authorities of their ''[[calpulli]]''. Periodically they attended their local temples, to test their progress.

Part of this education involved learning a collection of sayings, called ''huehuetlatolli'' ("The sayings of the old"), that embodied the Aztecs' ideals. It included speeches and sayings for every occasion, the words to salute the birth of children, and to say farewell at death. Fathers admonished their daughters &lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Somervill - Empire of the Aztecs, page 101 [https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=1CJ_WW4_ZaQC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=huehuetlatolli+english&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6klwU3qQGF&amp;sig=fW0q2qGvtCuRPlw0LDYGHDPwZh8&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikvOqlv6fWAhVPxCYKHV5jCzgQ6AEIWjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=huehuetlatolli%20english&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;  to be respectful and very clean, but not to use makeup, because they would look like ''ahuianis''.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Mothers admonished their daughters to support their husbands, even if they turned out to be humble peasants. Boys were admonished to be humble, obedient and hard workers. Judging by their language, most of the ''huehuetlatolli'' seemed to have evolved over several centuries, predating the Aztecs and most likely adopted from other Nahua cultures.

Children were taught at home until about 15 years of age, but all Aztec children, boys and girls, were expected to attend school for some time when they were between 10 and 20 years old. Boys and girls went to school at age 15.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

There were two types of schools: the ''[[Tēlpochcalli|telpochcalli]]'', for practical and military studies, and the ''[[calmecac]]'', for advanced learning in writing, astronomy, statesmanship, theology, and other areas. The two institutions seem to be common to the Nahua people, leading some experts to suggest that they are older than the Aztec culture.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

* The ''telpochcalli'' or House of the Young, taught history, religion, military fighting arts, and a trade or craft (such as agriculture or handicrafts). Some of the ''telpochcalli'' students were chosen for the army, but most of them returned to their homes.
* The ''calmecac'', attended mostly by the sons of ''pillis'', was focused on turning out leaders (''tlatoque''), priests, scholars/teachers (''tlatimini''), healers (''tizitl'') and codex painters (''tlacuilos''). They studied rituals, ancient and contemporary history, literacy, calendrics, some elements of geometry, songs (poetry), and, as at the ''telpochcalli'', military arts.

Each ''calpulli'' specialized in some handicrafts, and this was an important part of the income of the city. The teaching of handicraft was highly valued.

The healers (''tizitl'') had several specialities. Some were trained to just inspect and classify medicinal plants, others were trained in the preparation of medicines that were sold in special places (''tlapalli''). More than a hundred preparations are known, including deodorants, remedies for smelly feet, dentifric paste etc.  Also there were ''tizitl'' specialized in surgery, digestive diseases, teeth and nose, skin diseases, etc.

Aztec teachers (''tlamatimine'') propounded a spartan regime of education – cold baths in the morning, hard work, physical punishment, bleeding with maguey thorns and endurance tests – with the purpose of forming a stoical people.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

There is contradictory information about whether ''calmecac'' was reserved for the sons and daughters of the ''pillis''; some accounts said they could choose where to study.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} It is possible that the common people preferred the ''telpochcalli'', because a warrior could advance more readily by his military abilities; becoming a priest or a ''tlacuilo'' was not a way to rise rapidly from a low station.

Girls were educated in the crafts of home and child raising.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} They were not taught to read or write.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Some of them were educated as midwives and received the full training of a healer; they were also called ''tizitl''. Female tizitl would treat women throughout their reproductive life. They would admonish young wives, and after the second month of pregnancy, they began to watch for any problems. They preferred to save the woman's life over that of a fetus,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} resorting to embryotomy. Because of this, their work, called ''temiuxiuliztli'', has sometimes been translated as "obstetrics"  (Medicine in Mexico, before the Discovery. Dr. Manuel Valdez 1992). All women were taught to be involved "in the things of god"; there are paintings of women presiding over religious ceremonies, but there are no references to female priests.

There were also two other opportunities for those few who had talent. Some were chosen for the house of song and dance, and others were chosen for the ball game. Both occupations had high status.
==Recreation==
Recreation came in different forms in Aztec society. [[Mesoamerican ballgame|Ullamaliztli]], the ball game, was a large part of the indigenous society and had ritual aspects. Dance, however could be used in many different ways such as entertainment, religion or politics. 

===Ullamaliztli===

===Dance===
In Aztec society, dance could be used for entertainment, religious and sacrificial purposes, or for politics. When the intent was entertainment, it was performed in either a temple, temple or secluded areas for nobles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power and Identity in Archaeological Theory and Practice: Case Studies from Ancient Mesoamerica|last=Harrison-Buck|first=Eleanor|publisher=University of Utah Press|year=2015|isbn=9781607812173|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These performances often included songs, instrumental music and sometimes comic sketches.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power and Identity in Archaeological Theory and Practice: Case Studies from Ancient Mesoamerica|last=Harrison-Buck|first=Eleanor|publisher=University of Utah Press|year=2015|isbn=9781607812173|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used for religion or sacrifice, it followed the sacred [[Aztec calendar]] and its ritual cycle.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power and Identity in Archaeological Theory and Practice: Case Studies from Ancient Mesoamerica|last=Harrison-Buck|first=Eleanor|publisher=University of Utah Press|year=2015|isbn=9781607812173|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dance could also be used in politics to show imperial power and to impress the gods for successful wars and conquest.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power and Identity in Archaeological Theory and Practice: Case Studies from Ancient Mesoamerica|last=Harrison-Buck|first=Eleanor|publisher=University of Utah Press|year=2015|isbn=9781607812173|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical records==
The sources for information about Aztec society are primarily documents written in the Spanish language in the first century after the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|Spanish conquest]]. Important among these are the [[Florentine Codex]], a 12 volume ethnographic description of precolumbian Aztec society compiled by [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], the chronicle of [[Diego Durán]], and the descriptions of the first conquistadors such as those of [[Hernán Cortés]] himself and of [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]]. In recent decades the archaeological study of precolumbian Aztec civilization has also unearthed important information about Aztec society which has led to a deeper understanding particularly of social structures and trade.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2001) p. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chicago Commission on Race Relations''' was a non-partisan, interracial investigative committee, appointed by Illinois governor [[Frank Lowden]].  The commission was set up after the [[Chicago Race Riot of 1919|Chicago riots of July and August 1919]] in "which thirty-eight lives were lost, twenty-three Negros and fifteen whites, and 537 persons were injured".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Negro in Chicago; a study of race relations and a race riot|url=https://archive.org/stream/negroinchicagost00chic#page/n23/mode/2up|publisher=Chicago, Ill., The University of Chicago Press|date=NaN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the commission was to investigate the causes of the Riot and make recommendations to prevent a tragedy like this from reoccurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Negro in Chicago; a study of race relations and a race riot|url=https://archive.org/stream/negroinchicagost00chic#page/n23/mode/2up|publisher=Chicago, Ill., The University of Chicago Press|date=NaN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research was the first extensive research on interracial Black-white relations conducted in Chicago funded by a government agency.

The sociological study was published in 1922 by the University of Chicago Press as ''The Negro in Chicago: A Study of Race Relations and a Race Riot''. The study included a substantial review of the background of the riots, the riots themselves, and their aftermath, together with original work and investigation into the relations between and perceptions of the black and white communities in Chicago. ''The Negro in Chicago'' ran to 672 pages with a number of plates, plans and other additional matter.

==The Commission==
The Chicago Commission on Race Relations was composed of eighty-one citizens, representing forty-eight social, civic, commercial, and professional organizations of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Negro in Chicago; a study of race relations and a race riot|url=https://archive.org/stream/negroinchicagost00chic#page/n23/mode/2up|publisher=Chicago, Ill., The University of Chicago Press|date=NaN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before conducting the research, the commission felt that a strong emphasis should be placed on understanding the life of the Negro in Chicago, in particular the relations between the two races. The following six subcommittees were created: Committee on Racial Clashes, Committee on Housing, Committee on Industry, Committee on Crime, Committee on Racial Contracts, Committee on Public Opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Negro in Chicago; a study of race relations and a race riot|url=https://archive.org/stream/negroinchicagost00chic#page/n23/mode/2up|publisher=Chicago, Ill., The University of Chicago Press|date=NaN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago at this time experienced a drastic increase of Black migration from the South. World War I brought industrial jobs to cities in the North but many of these jobs were only available to whites. The arrival of black people in northern cities led to an increase in rent in underdeveloped neighborhoods and [[white flight]]. Expansion of the ghetto caused friction among white residents "that bombs were thrown at black owned homes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=with afterwords by the authors Kwame Ture &amp; Charles V.|title=Black power : the politics of liberation in America|date=1992|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-679-74313-2|pages=152–153|edition= Vintage}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The research was conducted by a series of "conferences or informal hearings, and through research and fieldwork carried on by staff or trained investigator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Negro in Chicago; a study of race relations and a race riot|url=https://archive.org/stream/negroinchicagost00chic#page/n23/mode/2up|publisher=Chicago, Ill., The University of Chicago Press|date=NaN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago neighborhoods were classified into four groups: (1) mixed, unadjusted neighborhoods; (2) mixed, adjusted neighborhoods; (3) contested areas; and (4) neighborhoods that are entirely white or negro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drake|first1=St Clair|last2=Cayton|first2=Horace R.|title=Black Metropolis: A Study of Negro Life in a Northern City|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Black_Metropolis.html?id=VYCiCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Chicago%20Commission%20on%20Race%20Relations%22&amp;f=false|publisher=University of Chicago Press|language=en|date=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study concluded that there were no immediate solutions to remedy the tensions between the racial groups and suggested that "through mutual understanding and sympathy between the races will be followed by harmony and co-operation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drake|first1=St Clair|last2=Cayton|first2=Horace R.|title=Black Metropolis: A Study of Negro Life in a Northern City|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Black_Metropolis.html?id=VYCiCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Chicago%20Commission%20on%20Race%20Relations%22&amp;f=false|publisher=University of Chicago Press|language=en|date=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chimalli (from [[Nahuatl]]:Shield, {{Pronunciation|Chimalli.ogg}}) was the traditional defensive armament of the indigenous states of Mesoamerica. These shields varied in design and purpose. The Chimali was also used while wearing special headgear.

==Typology==
Otlachimalli consisted of [[maize]] cane with the individual strands double-twisted with interwoven [[cotton]] or [[maguey]] fibers. On the front ornaments were attached in the form of faces, legendary figures and other illustrations which were meant to convey [[heraldry]] and status of the user. These representations were worked with colorful feathers in the form of a mosaic. In addition, materials such as beaten copper and gold would be used for decoration. The Otlachimalli was used as a battle shield. The reverse was reinforced by horizontal and vertical wooden struts. A leather cover was used to protect the carrying arm. In some shields [[tortoise]] shell was used to manufacture decorations. 
 
The Cuauhchimalli was made of wood and decorated in the same manner as the Otlachimalli. On the cuauhchimalli also mosaics from stone chips were sometimes applied. The reverse was equipped with two leather straps which were used for carrying the shield. In both types a leather pad was attached to the front as the basis for the ornaments, and they had a curtain of leather "straps" attached to the bottom portion of the shield which served as extra protection from [[arrows]].

==Variations==
The size of the shields varied. Some had normal(circular design) dimensions, others covered the whole body. There are reports of versions that could be folded. There were also ceremonial shields called māhuizzoh chimalli.&lt;ref&gt;George Cameron Stone, Donald J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8044">{{about|the philosophical concept of "Communicative Action"|Jurgen Habermas's magnum opus|The Theory of Communicative Action}}
In [[sociology]], '''communicative action''' is cooperative action undertaken by individuals based upon mutual deliberation and argumentation. The term was developed by [[Germany|German]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]]-[[sociologist]] [[Jürgen Habermas]] in his work ''[[The Theory of Communicative Action]]''.

== Structures ==

Communicative action for Habermas is possible given human capacity for [[rationality]]. This rationality, however, is "no longer tied to, and limited by, the subjectivistic and individualistic premises of modern philosophy and social theory."&lt;ref name=Habermas&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''Theory of Communicative Action'', trans. Thomas McCarthy, Boston: Beacon Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vi}} Instead, Habermas situates rationality as a capacity inherent within language, especially in the form of argumentation. "We use the term argumentation for that type of speech in which participants thematize contested validity claims and attempt to vindicate or criticize them through argumentation."&lt;ref name=Habermas/&gt;{{rp|18}} The structures of argumentative speech, which Habermas identifies as the absence of coercive force, the mutual search for understanding, and the compelling power of the better argument, form the 
key features from which intersubjective rationality can make communication possible. Action undertaken by participants through a process of such argumentative communication can be assessed as to their rationality to the extent which they fulfill those criteria.

[[Communicative rationality]] is distinct from instrumental, normative, and dramaturgic rationality by its ability to concern all three "worlds" as he terms them, following [[Karl Popper]]—the subjective, objective, and intersubjective or social. Communicative rationality is self-reflexive and open to a dialogue in which participants in an argument can learn from others and from themselves by reflecting upon their premises and thematizing aspects of their cultural background knowledge to question suppositions that typically go without question.

Communicative action is action based upon this deliberative process, where two or more individuals interact and coordinate their action based upon agreed interpretations of the situation.&lt;ref name=Habermas/&gt;{{rp|86}} Communicative action is distinguished by Habermas from other forms of action, such as instrumental action, which is pure goal-oriented behavior, dealt with primarily in economics, by taking all functions of language into consideration.&lt;ref name=Habermas/&gt;{{rp|95}} That is, communicative action has the ability to reflect upon language used to express propositional truth, normative value, or subjective self-expression.

==Social implications==

Much of Habermas' work has been in response to his predecessors in the [[Frankfurt School]]. Communicative rationality, for instance, can be seen as a response to the critique of enlightenment reason expressed in [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno|T.W. Adorno]]'s ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]''. Horkheimer and Adorno had argued that the Enlightenment saw a particular kind of rationality enshrined as dominant in western culture, instrumental reason, which had only made possible the more effective and ruthless manipulation of nature and human beings themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno and Horkheimer, ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', trans. Edmund Jephcott, Palo Alto: Stanford UP, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas' form of [[critical theory]] is designed to rediscover through the analysis of positive potentials for human rationality in the medium of language, the possibility of a critical form of reason that can lead to reflection and examination of not only objective questions, but also those of social norms, human values, and even aesthetic expression of subjectivity.

Habermas' earlier work, ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'', anticipates his concern for argumentation and can be read retrospectively as a historical case study of Western European societies institutionalizing aspects of communicative action in the political and social spheres. Habermas notes the rise of institutions of public debate in late seventeenth and eighteenth century Britain and France especially. In these nations, information exchange and communication methods pioneered by capitalist merchants became adapted to novel purposes and were employed as an outlet for the public use of reason. The notion of communicative rationality in the public sphere is therefore heavily indebted to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s formulation of the public use of reason in ''[[What is Enlightenment?]]'' Habermas argues that the [[bourgeoisie]] who participated in this incipient [[public sphere]] universalized those aspects of their class that enabled them to present the public sphere as inclusive—he even goes so far as to say that a public sphere that operates upon principles of exclusivity is not a public sphere at all.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere'', trans. Thomas McCarthy, Cambridge MA: MIT Pres, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on foundations of democracy established in this work carried over to his later examination in ''[[The Theory of Communicative Action]]'' that greater democratization and the reduction to barriers to participation in public discourse (some of which he identified in the first public sphere of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]) could open the door to a more open 
form of social action. The shift from a more Marxist focus on the economic bases of discourse in Structural Transformation to a more "super-structural" emphasis on language and communication in ''Theory of Communicative Action'' signals Habermas' transition to a post-Marxist framework.

==Critiques==

Habermas views communication and debate in the public sphere as argumentatively [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]]. Critics have argued that Habermas' notion of communicative rationality, upon which communicative action must be based, is illusory. The formal prerequisites of equality among argument participants, for instance, may mask the reality of unequal social capital. "There is no guarantee that a formally symmetrical distribution of opportunities to select and employ speech acts will result in anything more than an expression of the status quo."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Miller, ''Domination and Power'', Routledge, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Ian McNeeley, for instance, contrasts Habermas' view with Michel Foucault's notion of communication as embodying pre-existing power relationships: "Jürgen Habermas subscribes to an unrealistic ideal of power-free communication…Michel Foucault remedies this idealism by treating knowledge as power; his work is in fact suffused with applications of knowledge for the control of human bodies."&lt;ref&gt;Ian McNeeley, ''The Emancipation of Writing'', Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In a like manner, the discursive fiction of consensus achieved through rational argumentation might be used as a legitimating prop for social action to the detriment of marginalized members-this is the basis of much feminist critique of Habermas' notions.

Another radical critique is that of [[Nikolas Kompridis]], a former student of Habermas, who views Habermas' theory as another attempt to arrive at a "[[view from nowhere]]", this time by locating rationality in procedures of reaching agreement independent of any particular participants' perspective or background. In response, he proposes a "[[reflective disclosure|possibility-disclosing]]" role of reason to correct the problems with Habermas' work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolas Kompridis]], ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future'' (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crime in [[Glendale, California]]''':

Glendale police officers took on bootleggers and airmen in the 1920s, a decade when the department had both a "liquor detail" and an "air policeman" charged with citing pilots for flying violations committed over the city. In 1944, the Glendale city manager took on Police Chief V.B. Browne over suspected officer corruption, and Browne was asked to resign for failing to control his staff. But Browne asked to stay on as a patrolman, and he walked a beat until his retirement in 1948.

Glendale lost four police officers in the line of duty. The first officer in the area killed in the line of duty was Charles Whitney Smith, marshal for the city of Tropico, later annexed by Glendale. Smith had already been told he was fired, but he wanted to finish his day. So on his last day, Jan. 9, 1915, he was shot to death when he tried to stop a robbery suspect on a street car.

Glendale police officer Leslie O. Clem was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1926 while pursuing a suspect's car. During the course of the pursuit his motorcycle struck streetcar tracks, causing Officer Clem to be thrown from the bike. He succumbed to his injuries the next day.

In 1946, California Highway Patrolman Loren C. Roosevelt stopped a speeding vehicle on Los Feliz Boulevard when he was shot nine times by [[Erwin Walker]], an Army veteran and former Glendale Police Department employee.&lt;ref&gt;''Man Continues to Fight Police Despite Wounds'', The Los Angeles Times, December 21, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;  Officer Roosevelt later died of his wounds.

In 1972, Glendale police officer John Isaacson was killed in an automobile accident while on duty.

In 1997, Charles Lazzaretto became the first Glendale police officer in 25 years to die in the line of duty when an attempted-murder suspect, holed up in a Chatsworth warehouse, shot Lazzaretto in the head. In the ensuing gunfight two Los Angeles police officers were wounded, and the  suspect, Israel Gonzalez, committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/02/news/mn-8973 Response to Officer's Death Is a Flood of Contributions]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, "Night Stalker" [[Richard Ramirez]] terrorized the Los Angeles area, including Glendale. He was linked to the death of Max Kneiding and his wife, Lela Ellen, who were shot to death in their Glendale home. Ramirez also was later linked to a slaying just south of Glendale's Forest Lawn Memorial Park. In an earlier case, [[Angelo Buono]], a Glendale auto upholsterer, was convicted of sexually torturing and murdering nine women whose bodies were dumped on Los Angeles-area hillsides in 1977 and 1978.

In June 1990, an arson fire damaged or destroyed 64 homes in Glendale's [[San Rafael Hills]] and caused $40&amp;nbsp;million in damage. Evening rush-hour traffic was brought to a halt at the height of the fire as flames burned on both sides of the Glendale Freeway. The {{convert|100|acre|km2|adj=on}} fire, one of the worst in the city's history, resulted in flames leapfrogging from house to house, destroying some, leaving others untouched. After the devastating fire, the [[Glendale City Council]] passed a brush-clearing ordinance that called for more frequent inspection of private property by fire officials, and it allowed firefighters to cut back overgrown brush on private property and charge owners for the work.

On February 6, 1996, seven people were killed in the worst arson-murder in the city's history. The fire killed a Glendale mother, Turan Avanesian, and her six children, from ages 4 to 17. Jorjik Avanesian, who was convicted of dousing his family's one-bedroom apartment in Glendale with gasoline and setting it on fire, later killed himself in jail.

In 2005, 11 people died and about 180 were injured in a [[Metrolink (Southern California)]] train accident when a man who later claimed he was suicidal parked his sport utility vehicle on the tracks in Glendale. The driver was convicted of murder.

==Gangs==
Glendale was once home to more than 30 different gangs.  Gang violence peaked in the '90s.  Over time, the numbers have dropped significantly, and now there are only five documented gangs in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streetgangs.com/topics/2000/051300glendale.html Police Go On Gang Offensive]&lt;/ref&gt; Gang activity is primarily located in the low-income, [[Hispanic]] area of South Glendale, bordering the [[Northeast Los Angeles]] neighborhoods of [[Atwater Village, Los Angeles, California|Atwater Village]], and [[Glassell Park, Los Angeles, California|Glassell Park]].  Historically, South Glendale is claimed by the [[Mexico|Mexican]] gang [[Tooner Ville Rifa 13|Tooner Ville Rifa]]. The gang's ongoing attempt to control this area has led to turf wars between it and rival gangs from the bordering cities. Even the arrest and conviction of one of the gang's leaders has done little to stop gang activity.  The problem has pushed Glendale and Los Angeles city officials to seek an [[Gang injunction|injunction]] against the gang, covering {{convert|4.5|sqmi|km2}}.  This area is bordered by the [[Los Angeles River]], the [[California State Route 2|Glendale Freeway]], and the streets of Broadway and Verdugo Road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-injunction18-2008nov18,0,1746574.story L.A., Glendale seek injunction against Toonerville gang]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, [[Tooner Ville Rifa 13|TVR]] was listed as one of [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]]'s top 14 targeted street gangs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapdonline.org/home/news_view/40758 Los Angeles Police Department 2009 Gang Initiatives]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another primary source of Glendale's gang problem is the [[The Avenues (gang)|Avenues]] gang, which has also been listed as one of the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]]'s top 14 targeted street gangs. On June 25, 2008, over 500 officers, including SWAT teams, participated in a take-down of the gang.  A clique leader was arrested in the 900 block of East Windsor in South Glendale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://losangeles.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel08/la062508usa.htm FEDERAL RACKETEERING INDICTMENT TARGETS MEMBERS OF VIOLENT DREW STREET GANG IN NORTHEAST LOS ANGELES] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531205518/http://losangeles.fbi.gov///dojpressrel/pressrel08/la062508usa.htm |date=May 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminology and penology |theory}}

'''Criminalization''' or '''criminalisation''', in [[criminology]], is "the process by which behaviors and individuals are transformed into [[crime]] and criminals".&lt;ref&gt;Michalowski p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously legal acts may be transformed into crimes by [[legislation]] or judicial decision. However, there is usually a formal presumption in the rules of [[statutory interpretation]] against the [[Ex post facto law|retrospective application of laws]] and only the use of express words by the legislature may rebut this presumption. The power of judges to make new law and retrospectively criminalise behaviour is also discouraged. In a less overt way, where laws have not been strictly enforced, the acts prohibited by those laws may also undergo ''de facto'' criminalization through more effective or committed legal enforcement.

==The problems==
There has been some uncertainty as to the nature and extent of the contribution to be made by the victims of crime. But, as Garkawe (2001) indicates, the relationship between [[victimology]] and [[criminology]] has become problematic. The concern is that, within the [[dialectic]] of [[Right Realism]] and [[Left realism|Left Realism]],&lt;ref&gt;Walklate (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; a focus on the victim promotes rights selectively for certain victims, and advocates the assumption that some victim rights are more important than competing rights or values in society.&lt;ref&gt;Elias (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an [[Islamic]] [[feminism|feminist]] might seek consistency of treatment for women as victims and, therefore, demand the decriminalization of abortion, adultery, and seduction ([[Zina]] is a [[Hudud]] offense in [[sharia|sharia law]]), and the criminalization of [[domestic violence]] and [[sexual harassment]].

In formal academically published theory, the real ruling class of a society reaches a temporary view on whether certain acts or behavior are harmful or criminal. Historically this one theory will be modified by scientific, medical evidence, by political change, and the criminal justice system may or may not treat those matters as crimes.

Conversely, when local politics determines that it is no longer a crime, they may be decriminalized. For example, Recommendation No. R (95) 12 adopted by the [[Council of Europe Committee of Ministers|Committee of Ministers]] of the Council of Europe on the management of criminal justice, advocates that crime policies such as decriminalization, depenalisation or diversion, and mediation should be adopted wherever possible. But the law and order debate between right and left politicians is often superficial and unscientific, formulating policies based on their appeal to an uniformed electorate rather than properly conducted research.&lt;ref&gt;Currie (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
Several principles may underpin decisions about criminalization. These include the ''[[de minimis]]'' principle, that of the minimum criminalization.&lt;ref name="ashworth67"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this principle, the general harm principle fails to consider the possibility of other sanctions and the effectiveness of criminalization as a chosen option. Those other sanctions include civil courts, laws of [[tort]] and [[regulation]]. Having criminal remedies in place is seen as a "last resort" since such actions often infringe personal liberties &amp;ndash; [[incarceration]], for example, prevents the freedom of movement. In this sense, law making that places a greater emphasis on human rights. Most crimes of direct actions ([[murder]], [[rape]], [[assault]], for example) are generally not affected by such a stance, but it does require greater justification in less clear cases.&lt;ref name="ashworth67"/&gt;

The policy of "social defense" can be seen as an opposing view. It argues that criminalization is used against "any form of activity which threatens good order or is thought reprehensible". The minimization principle may unwittingly prevent the adaptation of the law to new situations.&lt;ref name="ashworth67"/&gt; In general, worldwide policy makers have created a myriad of smaller offences, in contradiction to the minimization principle and more in keeping with the [[social defence]].&lt;ref name="ashworth68"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harm===
{{see also|Victimless crimes}}
Leading criminal law philosophers, such as Dennis Baker and Joel Feinberg have argued that conduct should only be criminalized when it is fair to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis J. Baker, The Right Not to be Criminalized: Demarcating Criminal Law's Authority (Ashgate 2011) at chapter 3; Dennis J. Baker Dennis, "The Moral Limits of Criminalizing Remote Harms", (2007) 11(3) New Criminal Law Review 371, Joel Feinberg, Harm to Others: The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law, OUP, 1984: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, such theorists assert that objective reasons are needed to demonstrate that it is fair to criminalize conduct in any given case. The commonly cited objective justification for invoking the criminal law is harm to others, but it cannot deal with all situations. For example, people are not necessarily harmed by public nudity. Feinberg suggests that offence to others also provides an objective reason for invoking the criminal law, but it clearly does not as offence is determined according to conventional morality. Prostitution is another grey area, as some countries allow it in different forms, and it is hard to say whether or not it specifically harms the public in general.  One argument may be that prostitution perpetuates the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, and therefore harms the public which partakes in the act of prostitution.  However, the legalization of prostitution would change the way it is regulated, and law enforcement could find a way to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted disease, thus eliminating the health issue and the question of the morality of the profession would be weakened.

People experience a range of physical and social injuries in different contexts which will vary according to the level of economic and political development of their country. Some will be injured out of [[poverty]] and [[malnutrition]], others by [[violence]] which might stem from a major conflict such as [[war]] or from the personal violence in a [[robbery]]. The [[natural environment|environment]] may be damaged by [[pollution]], there may be hazards at work. Many of these sources of injury will be ignored while the state may delegate powers of control to a number of different agencies within an international framework where [[supranationalism|supranational]] agencies and [[human rights]] organisations may offer assistance in responding to the causes of those injuries.

===Moral approaches and autonomy===
The extent to which behaviours considered [[morally wrong]] in a given jurisdiction should be criminalized is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 42&amp;ndash;43.&lt;/ref&gt; Lying or breaking promises are not in general criminalised, for example. [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Patrick Devlin]] believed that moral behaviour was essential in maintaining the cohesion of a state, and so lawmakers should be entitled to criminalise immoral behaviour.&lt;ref name="ashworth43"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; However, opponents of this approach typically suggest use of a harm principle only and that immorality is not a reason in itself since outcomes of such activity can be used to come to a conclusion alone. Devlin's argument uses the disgust of the general public as a definition of morality; however, issues involving [[prejudice]] have shown this to be flawed and opponents push for a much stricter definition if this approach is to be used.&lt;ref name="ashworth43"/&gt; Devlin suggested a jury to give an indication of immoral behaviour. As well as prejudice, views were likely to vary widely on issues such as [[homosexuality]], [[contraception]] and other matters, particularly those influenced by religion. Agreement would be hard to find.&lt;ref name="ashworth43"/&gt; Other opposition has been from liberal groups which favour approaches which maximise individual rights.&lt;ref name="ashworth44"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; A moral basis for criminalization would be [[paternalistic]], thereby contrasting with personal autonomy. The [[European Convention of Human Rights]], in the most part supporting individual rights from government interferences, still includes a provision for interference "for the protection of health and morals"&lt;ref name="ashworth44"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm |title=Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms Measures |publisher=[[Council of Europe]] |year=2010 |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as legally requiring [[seat belt]]s to be worn (in some jurisdictions) are hard to justify if an individualistic approach is taken, since, if public health provision is ignored, little harm is caused to others.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 44&amp;ndash;45.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Raz]] argues that the state cannot and should not enforce morality; rather, any attempt to limit individual autonomy should be done only to limit harm. Certain moral ideals may be justifiable if they extend autonomy. If the immoral conduct of others impinges on someone else's autonomy, then that can be legislated against.&lt;ref name="ashworth45"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; There are some groups for whom the principle of autonomy is weakened: those under an [[age of majority]] and those people who are impaired by, for example, a [[mental disorder]].&lt;ref name="ashworth45"/&gt; In general, these people are protected from activities with significant consequences, if they are not in a position to make reasoned decisions themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 45&amp;ndash;46.&lt;/ref&gt; This may involve the criminalization of [[under-age drinking]], [[smoking]], [[gambling]] and [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]]. Such criminalization is rarely challenged.&lt;ref name="ashworth45"/&gt;

In [[British law]], a distinction between public and private acts was made in the [[Wolfenden report]], which examined sexual activities (particularly homosexuality and [[prostitution]]). Some acts would effectively become legal within private settings, but illegal in public settings.&lt;ref name="ashworth46"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The justification for this was the concept of shock or offensive to the public. Such a line was favoured by [[Joel Feinberg]], who argued that it was a good reason in support of legislation if it effectively prevented "serious offence" to persons other than the [[actor (law)|actor]].&lt;ref name="ashworth46"/&gt; Philosophers such as Feinberg struggle to quantify the ideology behind the illegality of acts which in another setting would be acceptable (that acts themselves not causing harm, for example), for example [[nudity]]. Since such acts publicly are made illegal on the basis of shock, then whether to criminalise depends on a shifting body of public opinion, which varies from place to place and from time to time. The concept of "insult" rather than "offensive" may be more specific.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 46&amp;ndash;47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Omission===
{{main|Omission (criminal law)}}
[[Common law]] does not often find an actor liable for omission &amp;ndash; failing to do something required by the law. Where this has applied it has typically been in industrial [[regulation]], in matters of [[social security]] or some personal regulated activity such as driving (for example, in the case of a [[hit and run (vehicular)|hit and run]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 47&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt; These form conditions placed upon operating in a particular manner and are thus understood in that context. There are few general duties in common law jurisdictions, although these do include the responsibility of a parent to safeguard their children, to a landowner to prevent offences being carried out there, and to someone creating a dangerous situation to attempt to limit that danger.&lt;ref name="ashworth48"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of limited liability for omissions suggest that the wording for such a law would be vague, possibly involving "reasonable" care or action, and so would be hard to enforce. This would give prosecutors wide discretion, which may be opposed to justice.&lt;ref name="ashworth48"/&gt; Morally, omission is viewed by many as a far lesser problem than act; compared to murder, allowing someone to die is seen as much smaller.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 48&amp;ndash;49.&lt;/ref&gt; A requirement to spend one's time and energy helping others would seem to contradict the autonomy many other laws aim to provide the individual with.&lt;ref name="ashworth49"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents point out these arguments fail to consider the harm that such omissions may cause, in contradiction to the harm principle many legal systems start out with. Life and physical integrity are often the highest priorities of a legal system.&lt;ref name="ashworth49"/&gt; Difficulties in definition are in common with many other areas, theorists such as Feinburg point out. A non-burdensome rescue is likely to be less valuable than freedom of action.&lt;ref name="ashworth49"/&gt; Limited liability is considered as article 223 of the [[French Penal Code]], which criminalises: "(1) a person who voluntarily neglects to prevent a serious crime of offense against that person, if that crime could be prevented without personal risk or risk to others; and (2) a person who voluntarily neglects to give, to a person in peril,  assistance which could be rendered without personal risk or risk to others."&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 49&amp;ndash;50.&lt;/ref&gt; This is common with several other European jurisdictions. Whilst open to the criticisms of vagueness and prosecutor discretion, it has not been seen as overly oppressive.&lt;ref name="ashworth50"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procedure===
When a state debates whether to respond to a source of injury by criminalising the behaviour that produces it, there are no pre-set criteria to apply in formulating social policy. There is no ontological reality to crime. The criminal justice system responds to a substantial number of events that do not produce significant hardship to individual citizens. Moreover, events which do cause serious injuries and perhaps should be dealt with as crimes, e.g. situations of [[corporate manslaughter]], are either ignored or dealt with as civil matters.

The criminalization process defines and classifies behaviour. It broadcasts the laws so that no-one may have the [[excuse]] of [[ignorantia juris non excusat|ignorance]], and disposes of those who will not obey. There are now more criminal laws and they are penetrating deeper into the social structures of modern societies. Crime control has become an industry, yet it remains ineffective in providing protection to all its citizens from harm. Such as it is, the process is made up of three components:
#Creation of a social order. This is both a socio-economic process, a "...fundamental ordering of social relations so that those things necessary for social survival can be produced and distributed in some predictable fashion" and an ideological process so that there can be a "...development of values, beliefs, and ideas related to the concrete tasks of production and distribution."(p.&amp;nbsp;6). Thus, society must develop the apparatus of law creation, law enforcement and [[punishment]] and the system must be acceptable to the majority of those who live in the community. If the laws do not match the general [[mores]], their enforcement will be a source of friction and disharmony. Conformity to the social order must, for the most part, be self-enforced.
#For the times when self-enforcement fails, society must create a legal order. This part of the process sees the centralisation of power within the institutions of the political state.  Some states justified the criminalization process as demonstrating their concerns about safety and security, the policy of control, policing, criminal justice, and penal practice. The modern state is [[decentralisation|decentralising]] and [[privatisation|privatising]] its functions. This is changing the character and content of the remaining institutions of the state which must now work co-operatively with other for-profit agencies.
#The political order must realign so that the remaining political entities such as [[legislature]]s and [[judge]]s set agreed targets for state control and then produce actual outputs of the legal order, i.e. of people defined as criminal and processed through that system.

==Ontological basis of crime==

Put in the most simple terms, ontology deals with or establishes the clear grounds for being. (Heidegger, Martin, Being and Time, introduction, referencing Plato's Parmenides.) In some of the traditional schools, such as those of the post-1688 English or Americans (many of the writings of the American Founding Fathers, but especially The Federalist) and their Dutch predecessors (see Kossmann, E. H. Political Thought in the Dutch Republic, 2004) ontology proper is deemed beyond the scope of legal thought, in accord with the modern distinction between society and state (which some consider based in the distinction the Romans made between themselves and their Italian allies, the socii, but not given the theoretical articulation we recognize today until emphasized by Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan. See [[State (polity)|state]].) However, some classical theorists, such as Aristotle, in his Politics and Metaphysics, and to a lesser degree in his Topics,{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} suggest that the distinction is at least problematic. One need consider no further than the claim that man is a political animal to see this is so.

As a political animal, man has come to see himself as possessed of rights,&lt;ref&gt;UN Human Rights Council, http://www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/&lt;/ref&gt; whether these are the [[Rights of Englishmen]] of old, or the universal human rights advocated vigorously toward establishment today through the matrix of commercialism.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_cescr.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; At least in the today dominant American model, deprivation of right amounts to injury (consider especially Justice Stevens dissenting opinion in [[Castle Rock v. Gonzales]]), and injury—so goes the prevailing theory—amounts, when coupled with requisite intent, in most cases, to crime, when it does not admit of civil redress. Thus, again in simple terms, and to the extent that human beings are indeed political beings, crime does seem to have an ontological basis. (For one approach to the question of criminal ontology, see "Understanding Crime and Social Control in Market Economies: Looking Back and Moving Forward" by Robert Bohm in Jeffrey Ian Ross, ed. Cutting the Edge: Current Perspectives in Radical/Critical Criminology and Criminal Justice. Westport, Conn: Praeger, 1998.) This, further, seems to hold if ontology itself is divided into political and trans- or supra- or meta- political ontology—i.e., what once was the realm of Christian theology. Of course, it does not matter whether that theology is Christian or belonging to some other apolitical belief. The point is that one may, with some justice, argue persuasively that being is divided. This need not, however, force the question of meta-political crimes. Our purposes here, in this article, are limited to the political. For the question in general see [[Ontology]].

Baker  argues that only objective harms and other objective bad consequences (or actions in the case of inchoate and endangerment offenses) are prima facie criminalizable. By other bad consequences Baker means privacy violations and conduct that does not necessarily result in tangible harm, but does result in unwanted consequences. Baker argues that the privacy violations that result from being forced to receive unwanted obscene information in public places (exhibitionism) would amount to a sufficient bad consequence for the purposes of invoking the criminal law,  but argues that proportionate punishment means that such conduct should only be punished with fines rather than jail terms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17014">'''Embodied bilingual language''', also known as '''L2 embodiment''', is the idea that people mentally simulate their actions, [[perception]]s, and [[emotion]]s when speaking and understanding a [[second language]] (L2) as with their [[first language]] (L1).&lt;ref name=Vukovic&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vukovic|first1=Nikola|last2=Shtyrov|first2=Yury|title=Cortical motor systems are involved in second-language comprehension: Evidence from rapid mu-rhythm desynchronisation|journal=NeuroImage|date=2014|volume=102|pages=695–703|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.08.039|pmid=25175538}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is closely related to [[embodied cognition]] and [[embodied language processing]], both of which only refer to native language thinking and speaking.  An example of embodied bilingual language would be situation in which a L1 English speaker learning Spanish as a second language hears the word ''rápido'' ("fast") in Spanish while taking notes and then proceeds to take notes more quickly.

==Overview==
Embodied bilingual language refers to the role second language learning plays in embodied cognition, which proposes that the way the body interacts with its environment influences the way a person thinks or creates mental images.&lt;ref name=Barsalou1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barsalou|first1=Lawrence|title=Perceptual symbol systems|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=1999|volume=22|issue=44|pages=577–660|doi=10.1017/S0140525X99002149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Embodied cognition theory assumes that embodiment occurs automatically and in a person’s native tongue.&lt;ref name=Bergen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bergen|first1=Benjamin|last2=Lau|first2=Ting-Ting Chan|last3=Narayan|first3=Schweta|last4=Stojanovic|first4=Diana|last5=Wheeler|first5=Kathryn|title=Body part representations in verbal semantics|journal=Memory and Cognition|date=2010|volume=38|issue=7|pages=969–981|doi=10.3758/MC.38.7.969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Embodied theories of language posit that word meaning is grounded in mental representations of action, perception, and emotion.&lt;ref name=Barsalou1999/&gt;  Thus, L2 embodiment presupposes that embodied cognition takes place in a language that was learned later in life, outside of a child’s [[critical period]] of learning a language.  In embodied bilingual language, a second language as well as the first language connects cognition with physical body movements.&lt;ref name=Vukovic/&gt;

For example, in first language (L1) embodiment, research shows that participants are quicker to comprehend sentences if they are simultaneously presented with pictures describing the actions in the sentence.&lt;ref name=GK&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glenberg|first1=Arthur|title=Grounding language in action|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|date=2002|volume=9|issue=3|pages=558–565|doi=10.3758/BF03196313}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Embodied language assumes that comprehension of language requires mental simulation, or imagination, of the subject and action of a sentence that is being processed and understood.  Following L1 embodiment, L2 embodiment supposes that the understanding of sentences in L2 also require the same mental processes that underlie first language comprehension.&lt;ref name=Vukovic/&gt;

==Theory==
Research shows that embodiment is present in native language processing,&lt;ref name=Bergen/&gt; and if embodiment occurs in first language processing, then embodiment might also occur in second language processing.&lt;ref name=VW&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vukovic|first1=N|last2=Williams|first2=J|title=Automatic perceptual simulation of first language meanings during second language sentence processing in bilinguals|journal=Acta Psychologica|date=2014|volume=145|pages=98–103|doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2013.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  How second language is embodied compared to first language is still a topic of debate. Currently, there are no known theories or models that address the presence or absence of embodiment in second language processing, but there are bilingual processing models that can lead to multiple hypotheses of embodiment effects in second language learning.&lt;ref name=degrawe&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Grawe|first1=S|last2=Willems|first2=R.M.|last3=Rueschemeyer|first3=S|last4=Lemhöfer|first4=K|last5=Schriefers|first5=H|title=Embodied language in first- and second-language speakers: Neural correlates of processing motor verbs.|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=2014|volume=56|pages=334–349|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2014.02.003|pmid=24524912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revised hierarchical model (RHM)===
[[File:Kroll &amp; Stewart's RHM Model.png|thumbnail|According to the RHM, lexical associations from L2 to L1 are stronger than that of L1 to L2.  While the link from L1 to conceptual memory is stronger than the link from L2 to conceptual memory, the two conceptual links are nevertheless bidirectional.]]
The [[Simultaneous bilingualism#Bilingual lexical representations|revised hierarchical model (RHM)]] hypothesizes that [[Lexicon|lexical]] connections are stronger from L2 to L1 than from L1 to L2.  In other words, translating a word from second language to first language occurs faster than vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kroll|first1=Judith|last2=Stewart|first2=Erika|title=Category interference in translation and picture naming: Evidence for asymmetric connection between bilingual memory representations.|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|date=1994|volume=33|issue=2|pages=149–174|doi=10.1006/jmla.1994.1008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, while translating from native language to second language might be delayed, the [[semantics]], or word meanings of the information being conveyed, are maintained and understood by the translator.

What this means in terms of embodied bilingual language is that there should be no difference in embodiment effects between first language processing and second language processing.  Because the RHM model posits that semantic representations are shared across languages, meanings found in first language action, perception, and emotion will transfer equally into second language processing&lt;ref name=degrawe/&gt;

===Extended bilingual interactive activation (BIA+) model===
[[File:Djkstra &amp; van Heuven's BIA+ Model.png|thumbnail|left|According to the BIA+ model, orthographic representations activate first, which then activate phonological and semantic representations.]]
According to the [[Simultaneous bilingualism#Bilingual lexical representations|BIA+ model]] of bilingual lexical processing, the brain activates both languages when recognizing a word in either language.  Rather than selecting a single language, lexical access, or the sound-meaning connections of a language, is non-selective across languages.  The BIA+ model suggests that orthographic representations activate first, followed by their associated phonological and semantic representations.  The speeds of these activations depend on frequency of use of the language.  Given this proposition, if second language is used less often than first language, second language activation occurs more slowly than first language activation.  However, the BIA+ model argues that these differences in activation time are minuscule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dijkstra|first1=Tom|last2=Van Heuven|first2=Walter|title=The architecture of the bilingual word recognition system: From identification to decision|journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|date=2002|volume=5|issue=3|pages=175–197|doi=10.1017/S1366728902003012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the RHM, the BIA+ model says that while there are slight differences in time when accessing word meanings in both first and second languages, the semantic representations are maintained.  Thus, in terms of embodiment, the BIA+ model would suggest that embodiment effects, too, are maintained across native and second language processing.&lt;ref name=degrawe/&gt;

===Sense model===
[[File:Finkbeiner et al. Sense Model.png|thumbnail|A sense model representation of two translation equivalents which only partially share semantic meaning. Semantics are completely connected to first language but only very little in second language.]]
The sense model takes a different position from the previously stated models. The sense model supposes that native language words are associated with a greater number of semantic senses than second language words and argues for partially overlapping distributed semantic representations for L1 and L2 words.  As a result, the sense model argues that semantic representations in second language are "less rich" than in those in the native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finkbeiner|first1=Matthew|last2=Forster|first2=Kenneth|last3=Nicol|first3=Janet|last4=Nakamura|first4=Kumiko|title=The role of polysemy in masked semantic and translation priming|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|date=2004|volume=51|pages=1–22|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2004.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If this is the case in embodied bilingual language, then embodiment in second language processing may be minimal or even completely lacking.&lt;ref name=degrawe/&gt;

==Action==

===Non-selective motor systems===
Embodied bilingual processing is rooted in motor processing because research shows that the [[motor cortex]] activates during language processing.  In first language processing, for example, leg-related words like "kick" and "run" stimulate the part of the motor cortex that controls leg motions.&lt;ref name=Pul&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pulvermüller|first1=F|last2=Härle|first2=M|last3=Hummel|first3=F|title=Walking or Talking?: Behavioral and Neurophysiological Correlates of Action Verb Processing|journal=Brain and Language|date=2001|volume=78|issue=2|pages=143–168|doi=10.1006/brln.2000.2390}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This illustrates that language describing motor actions activates motor systems in the brain, but only when the words provide [[literal meaning]] as opposed to figurative meaning.&lt;ref name=BW/&gt; Following L1 embodiment, L2 embodiment assumes that the words "punch" and "throw" in a second language will also stimulate the same parts of the motor cortex as does first language words.&lt;ref name=Vukovic/&gt;  In essence, language that describes motor actions activates [[motor systems]] in the brain.&lt;ref name=Vukovic/&gt;  If this holds true for all languages, then the processing that occurs when understanding and using a second language must also activate motor regions of the brain, just as native language processing does.

Research shows that both first and second language action words rely on the motor cortex for language processing, strengthening the claim that the motor cortex is necessary for action language processing.&lt;ref name=VW/&gt;  This research suggests that action language processing has direct access to semantic motor representations in both languages.&lt;ref name=degrawe/&gt;  This results from second language motor systems calling on and activating information from first language motor systems.  Initially, the semantic representations stimulated by the first language are stronger than that of the second language.  But with more experience and exposure to the second language, sensorimotor involvement and second language comprehension becomes stronger.&lt;ref name=Pul/&gt;  The more often a second language is used, the stronger the neural networks and associations become, and thus some researchers argue that semantic representations in second language become just as prominent as for first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dudschig|first1=C|last2=Kaup|first2=B|title=Embodiment and second-language: Automatic activation of motor responses during processing spatially associated L2 words and emotion L2 words in a vertical stroop paradigm.|journal=Embodiment and second-language: Automatic activation of motor responses during processing spatially associated L2 words and emotion L2 words in a vertical stroop paradigm.|date=2013|volume=132|pages=14–21|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2014.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception==
Grounded or embodied cognition is a theoretical view that assumes knowledge is represented in the mind as modal representations, which are memories of perceptual, motor, and affective experiences.&lt;ref name=Barsalou1999/&gt;  Perceptual features include orientation, location, visibility conditions, motion, movement direction, and action direction.  All of these perceptual features are necessary for comprehending language.  If this is true for first language processing, then this must also be true for second language processing.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bergen|first1=Benjamin|last2=Wheeler|first2=Kathlyn|title=Grammatical aspect and mental simulation.|journal=Brain and Language|date=2010|volume=112|pages=150–158|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2009.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These perceptual features occur when imagining an action, recalling an action, and observing various sensory information.&lt;ref name=degrawe/&gt;  In addition to motor brain areas, [[somatosensory]] areas, which deal with touch and physical awareness, are also activated.  This sensory information contributes to formulating the mental simulation, or imagination of the action being described, that necessitates language comprehension&lt;ref name=BW/&gt;

Finally, research shows that embodied bilingual language processing not only activates the perceptual simulation of first and second language meanings, but this activation is automatic.&lt;ref name=VW/&gt;  Second language users automatically stimulate word meanings in a detailed perceptual fashion.  Rather than consciously using strategies for language comprehension, bilinguals automatically perceive and construct meaning.

==Emotion==
Embodied bilingual language also assumes that comprehension of language activates parts of the brain that correspond with [[emotion]].  Research provides evidence that emotion words are embedded in a rich semantic network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pavlenko|first1=A|title=Emotion and emotion-laden words in the bilingual lexicon|journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|date=2008|volume=11|pages=147–165|doi=10.1017/S1366728908003283}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given this information, emotion is better perceived in a first language because linguistic development coincides with conceptual development and development of emotional regulation systems.  Linguistic conditioning spreads to phonologically and semantically related words of the same language, but not to translation equivalents of another language.

===Disembodied bilingual language and emotion===
Some researchers have argued for disembodied cognition when it comes to processing emotion.  The idea of disembodied cognition comes from research, which shows that less emotion is shown by a bilingual person when using a second language.  This may illustrate that less emotionality is attached to second language, which then leads to the reduction of [[biases]] such as decision bias or framing bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pavlenko|first1=A|title=Affective processing in bilingual speakers: Disembodied cognition?|journal=International Journal of Psychology|date=2012|volume=47|issue=6|pages=405–428|doi=10.1080/00207594.2012.743665}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study examining the anxiety effects of L2 words such as "death" found that those with lower levels of proficiency in L2 were more likely than L1 speakers to experience feelings of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keysar|first1=B|last2=Hayakawa|first2=S|last3=An|first3=S|title=The foreignlanguage effect: Thinking in a foreign tongue reduces decision biases.|journal=Psychological Science|date=2012|volume=23|pages=661–668.|doi=10.1177/0956797611432178|pmid=22517192}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|How does this figure in to the rest of this paragraph?|date=June 2015}} Because the emotion is less interpreted during second language processing, speakers will be more likely to ignore or fail to comprehend the emotion of a situation when making decisions or analyzing situations. However, others have found that such and similar results may be due not so much to an emotions-based explanation, as the fact that speaking in a second/foreign language seems to release the speaker from the social norms, limitations and political correctness imposed by their mother tongue.&lt;ref name="ParadowskiGawinkowskaBilewicz2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gawinkowska M, Paradowski MB, Bilewicz M |title=Second language as an exemptor from sociocultural norms. Emotion-Related Language Choice revisited |url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081225 |journal=PLoS ONE  |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=e8122 |year=2013 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0081225 |pmid=24349044 |pmc=3859501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of disembodied cognition posits that because emotions are not as clearly recognized in a second language versus a first language, emotions will not affect and bias a person who is using a second language as much as using a first language.  This lack of comprehension of emotion provides evidence for the sense model, which hypothesizes that embodied cognition fails to be present in second language processing.

'''Enxet,''' also known as "'''Lengua Ser'''," "'''Lengua'''," "'''Vowak'''," and "'''Enhlit'''" is one of twenty languages spoken by the [[Gran Chaco people]] of [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;Brenzinger, M. (2008). ''Language Diversity Endangered'' (1st ed.). Walter De Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; Enxet is isolated to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] of [[Paraguay]] and belongs to the [[Mascoian languages|Mascoian]] (Demonym "Mascoian") language family. Once a dialect of the broader language lengua, Enxet (Southern Lengua) and [[Enlhet language|Enhlet]] (Northern Lengua) diverged as extensive differences between the two were realized.

== Classification ==
Enxet belongs to the Mascoian language family, spoken primarily by Native Americans in the Paraguayan region of the South American Gran Chaco. The South Amerindians living in this region are referred to as [[Guaycuru peoples|Guaycuru]].&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;Campbell, L., &amp; Grondona, V. M. (2012). ''The indigenous languages of South America: a comprehensive guide''. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Enxet and Enhlet were once considered dialects of Lengua. They were dubbed "Southern Lengua" and "Northern Lengua," respectively.&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;

The Enxet language was first documented in the late 19th century by explorers from [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Samuel A. Lufone Quevedo. (1893). Languages of the Gran Chaco. ''Science,'' ''21''(524), 95–95. {{jstor|1765332}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language contents and structure ==
Enxet contains only three phonemic vowel qualities /e,a,o/, each requiring a certain length such to maximize distinction. Bilingual speakers of Spanish and Enxet purportedly utilize shorter spacing between vowels when speaking the latter compared to the former.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, J. (2016). For bilinguals, Enxet vowel spaces smaller than Spanish. ''The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America'', ''140''(4), 3107–3107. {{doi|10.1121/1.4969702}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary issues ==
The region occupied by the Enxet people is the subject of an ongoing legal dispute with the state of Paraguay.

The Enxet language and people are of interest to Anglican missionaries.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Evolutionary anthropology''' is the interdisciplinary study of the [[human evolution|evolution]] of [[human physiology]] and [[human behaviour]] and the relation between [[hominids]] and non-hominid [[primate]]s. Evolutionary anthropology is based in [[natural science]] and [[social science]]. Various fields and disciplines of evolutionary anthropology are:

* [[Human evolution]] and [[anthropogeny]].
* [[Paleoanthropology]] and [[paleontology]] of both human and non-human primates.
* [[Primatology]] and primate [[ethology]].
* The [[sociocultural evolution]] of [[human behavior]].
* The [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[evolutionary linguistics]] of humans.
* The [[archaeological]] study of human technology and change over time and space.
* [[Human evolutionary genetics]] and changes in the [[human genome]] over time.
* The [[neuroscience]], [[endocrinology]], and [[neuroanthropology]] of human and primate cognition, culture and actions and abilities.
* [[Human behavioural ecology]] and the interaction of humans and the environment.
* Studies of human [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], and differences and changes between species, variation between human groups, and relationships to cultural factors.

Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a [[scientific]] approach, and brings together fields such as archaeology, [[behavioral ecology]], [[psychology]], primatology, and [[genetics]]. It is a dynamic and [[interdisciplinary]] field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.

Studies of biological evolution generally concern the evolution of the human form. Cultural evolution involves the study of cultural change over time and space and frequently incorporate [[cultural transmission]] models. Note that cultural evolution is not the same as biological evolution, and that human culture involves the transmission of cultural information, which behaves in ways quite distinct from [[human biology]] and [[genetics]]. The study of cultural change is increasingly performed through [[cladistics]] and genetic models.

A '''French Guatemalan''' is a citizen of Guatemala who has French ancestry. Guatemalans of French descent make up the third largest European descended group in Guatemala, after the [[German Guatemalan]]s and [[Spanish Guatemalan]]s. According to the French embassy, as of 31 December 2010, there are 803 French citizens in [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name=consulados&gt;[http://www.statistiques-mondiales.com/francais.htm Répartition par pays de la population française inscrite au registre au 31 décembre 2010] [[Ministère des Affaires étrangères et du Développement international]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of the French in Guatemala is divided into three periods of migratory waves.

=== The late eighteenth century ===
After the [[French Revolution]], capitalists and entrepreneurs came to create coffee plantations in several countries of [[Americas|America]], in [[Guatemala]] spanned throughout the altiplano.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Regina (noviembre de 2001).  [https://books.google.com.gt/books?id=z8GpZWsAjXsC&amp;pg=PT31&amp;lpg=PT31&amp;dq=historia+de+los+franceses+en+guatemala&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ASdCJGfBEd&amp;sig=R6ARFW1CAnVjt2aKg5_hOEs_0Fo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=E8P9VJ39HJDisATsx4LwAQ&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=historia%20de%20los%20franceses%20en%20guatemala&amp;f=false Histoire café du Guatemala]. Bogota, D,C, Colombie: Anacafe. pp. 203, 207. {{ISBN|958-96982-8-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1789 and 1917, European policies fought for or against of the principles of 1789. In this regard [[France]] bring to the vocabulary programs, and liberal parties, the radical democratic most of the world and also in [[Guatemala]]. France brought influence to the next revolutionary movements in Hispanic America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblioteca.usac.edu.gt/tesis/07/07_2011.pdf French Revolution and the impact in the world] USAC. Retrieved 16/04/2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Independence era ===
French former soldiers of the Napoleonic War and South American independence wars (Nicolas Raoul, Isidoro Saget, Henri Terralonge, Aluard, Courbal, Duplessis, Gibourdel and Goudot) offered their services during the independence wars.&lt;ref name="AFEHC"/&gt; Initial diplomatic contact between France and Central America began in 1827; full diplomatic relations were established in 1830.&lt;ref name="AFEHC"/&gt; Later some French politicians moved to [[Guatemala City]] during the wars between [[Liberalism|liberals]] and [[conservatives]]. When the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] was divided, some French migrated to [[Costa Rica]] and [[Nicaragua]] although the majority remained in Guatemala.  Since then began to arrive politicians, scientists, artists, builders, traders, doctors, and singers plus some families, many of them was married with Guatemalan women, which caused an increase of Guatemalan people of French descent (both direct and mixed).&lt;ref name="AFEHC"&gt;''Asociación para el Fomento de los Estudios Históricos en Centroamérica (AFEHC)'' [http://www.afehc-historia-centroamericana.org/index.php?action=fi_aff&amp;id=1497 Relaciones entre Francia y Guatemala (1823-1954)] Guatemala, 2007. Retrieved 4 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Twentieth century ===
Towards a census in 1900, there were 8,000 French people in [[Mesoamerica]], Three quarters parts in [[Mexico]] and nearly a fifth in [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.gt/books?id=ZtRZlzQlrQgC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=inmigracion+francesa+en+guatemala+en+el+siglo+xx&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WvJ6mRz4B9&amp;sig=9CFH7ZpBZOM5SNuon6Sjcq9rK7w&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hT8wVf2iFoaFsAWdhYGACw&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=inmigracion%20francesa%20en%20guatemala%20en%20el%20siglo%20xx&amp;f=false] México-France. {{ISBN|968-6029-78-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the arrival of the Guatemalan presidency of General [[José María Reina Barrios]], who was educated in [[Paris]], began a revival of diplomatic relations between [[France]] and [[Central America]]. In 1920, after the triumph of the Unionist movement, is founded in [[Guatemala City]] the [[Alliance Francaise]], for initiative of several Guatemalan families of French origin.&lt;ref name="AFEHC"/&gt;

== Demography ==
Many Guatemalans of French descent still preserve the [[French language]] and contumbres and traditions of [[France]]. A agran majority belongs to the [[Catholic]] religion, there are minorities [[Protestant]], [[Jews]] and [[muslims]].  Over 800 French people are estimated to live in [[Guatemala]], making it the third largest French community in [[Central America]], behind [[Panama]] and [[Costa Rica]].

=== Notable Guatemalan French ===
*[[Enrique Gómez Carrillo]], writer, descendant of French great-grandfather 
*[[Consuelo de Sánchez Latour]], writer
*[[Oscar Isaac|Oscar Isaac Hernández Estrada]], singer, descendant of French great-grandmother French
*[[Harold Caballeros]], evangelical pastor whose mother has French ancestry
*[[Francisca Aparicio de Roda]], wife of [[Justo Rufino Barrios]],  of Spanish, French and Swiss origin.

The '''Greek community in Austria''' numbers between 5,000 and 18,000 people. They are located all around the country but the main community is located in Vienna.

== History ==
Contacts between the Greeks and the Austrians can be led back in the aristocracy of the Middle Ages. Great economic importance and social acknowledgment attained the Greeks in Austria in the 19th Century.

The Greek Johannes Theodat opened on January, 17th 1685 Vienna's first coffee house. In 1700 four Greeks had the privilege to serve coffee in public.

In the 18th century, [[Vienna]] was the centre of Greek diaspora where persons like [[Rigas Feraios]], [[Anthimos Gazis]], [[Neophytos Doukas]] and the [[Ypsilantis]] family prepared the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek revolution]]. The first Greek newspaper was printed there and the Hellenic National School in Vienna is today the oldest such in the world that has remained continuously in operation. In 20th century Austria (and especially Graz and Linz) was a popular destination for Greek students.

== Architectural Heritage==
The [[Greeks|Greek]]-Austrian magnate [[Georgios Sinas]] (father of [[Simon Sinas]]) invited the Danish architect [[Theophil Freiherr von Hansen|Theophil Hansen]] who worked in Athens (and had designed there major public buildings like the [[Zappeion]] and the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]]) to design for him some new buildings for his companies in Austria. Other Greek Austrians like [[Nikolaus Dumba]] and [[Ignaz von Ephrussi]] also gave Hansen contracts for buildings in the ''Classical Greek style'' and the ''Gräzisierter-Neorennaissance-Stil''. After Works like the [[Palais Ephrussi]] and the [[Palais Dumba]] Hansen was famous and build many other public buildings in Austria like the [[Parliament of Austria]] and the [[Musikverein]].

In the former Greek Quarter of Vienna at the ''Fleischmarkt'' there are the two historical Greek-Orthodox parishes (St George and Holy Trinity). A traditional Austrian Restaurant there is called [[Griechenbeisl]] ("Greek Tavern", because of its Greek visitors since the 18th century) and a street ''Griechengasse'' (Greek Lane").

The '''Guraghe people''' ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|ʊəˈr|ɑː|ɡ|eɪ}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Merriam-Webster|Gurage}}&lt;/ref&gt; are an [[Ethiopian Semitic]]-speaking [[ethnic group]] inhabiting [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name = Huntingford&gt;G. W. E. Huntingford, "William A. Shack: The Gurage: a people of the ensete culture"&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2007 national census, its population is 3,567,377 people, of whom 256,737 are urban dwellers. This is 2.5% of the total population of Ethiopia, or 18.33% of the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region]] (SNNPR).&lt;ref name=2007-census&gt;[http://www.csa.gov.et/pdf/Cen2007_firstdraft.pdf "Census 2007"], first draft, Table 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gurage people traditionally inhabit a fertile, semi-mountainous region in southwest Ethiopia, about 125 kilometers southwest of [[Addis Ababa]], bordering the [[Awash River]] in the north, the [[Gibe River]] (a tributary of the [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Omo River]]) to the southwest, and [[Lake Zway]] in the east. In addition, according to the 2007 Ethiopian national census the Gurage can also be found in large numbers in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Oromia Region]], [[Dire Dawa]], [[Harari Region]], [[Somali Region]], [[Amhara Region]], [[Gambela Region]], [[Benishangul-Gumuz Region]], and [[Tigray Region]].&lt;ref&gt;Table 3.1 on [http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php/2013-02-20-14-51-51/2013-04-01-11-53-00/census-2007 2007 Ethiopian Regional States Census Data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824054202/http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php/2013-02-20-14-51-51/2013-04-01-11-53-00/census-2007 |date=2016-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The languages spoken by the Guraghe are known as the [[Gurage languages]].  The variations among these languages are used to group the Guraghe people into three dialectically varied subgroups: Northern, Eastern and Western. However, the largest group within the Eastern subgroup, known as the [[Silt'e people|Silt'e]], identify foremost as [[Muslim]]s.&lt;ref name=Vaughan&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=Ph.D. | last=Vaughan | first=Sarah | url=http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/605/2/vaughanphd.pdf | title=Ethnicity and Power in Ethiopia | chapter=7 | format=PDF | year=2003 | publisher=[[University of Edinburgh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Silt'e, refusing to identify as Gurage, voted overwhelmingly for the establishment of a separate special administrative unit within SNNPR by the EPRDF government.&lt;ref name=Vaughan /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Mahmoudahmedfeature.jpg|thumb|Gurage artist Mahmoud Ahmed]]
According to the historian Paul B. Henze, their origins are explained by traditions of a military expedition to the south during the last years of the [[Kingdom of Aksum]], which left military colonies that eventually became isolated from both northern Ethiopia and each other.&lt;ref&gt;Henze, ''Layers of Time'' (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; However other historians have raised the issue of the complexity of Gurage Peoples if viewed as a singular group, for example Ulrich Braukhamper states that the Gurage East people may have been an extension of the ancient [[Harla]] people.  Indeed, there is evidence that Harla architecture may have influenced old buildings (pre-16th c.) found near Harar (eastern Ethiopia), and the Gurage East group often cite kinship with [[Harari people|Harare]] (Hararghe) peoples in the distant past.  Braukhamper also states King [[Amda Seyon]] ordered [[Eritrea]]n troops to be sent to mountainous regions in Gurage (named Gerege), which eventually became a permanent settlement.  In addition to Amda Seyon's military settlement there,  the permanence of Abyssinian presence in Gurage is documented during his descendants [[Zara Yacob]] and [[Dawit II]]'s reigns.  Braukhamper also notes that some [[Amhara people|Amhara]] troops and their families likely fled areas in modern-day Gondar and Gojjam into the Gurage region during the [[Ethiopian-Adal War]] of the 1530s, since Abyssinia was drastically outgunned by the Adal troops which received supplies and arms from the [[Ottoman Empire]].  Thus, historically, Gurage peoples may be a complex mixture of Abyssinian, Harla, and other groups which migrated and settled in that region for differing reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braukamper|first1=Ulrich|title=Islamic History and Culture in South Ethiopia|publisher=LITverlag|page=18|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=HGnyk8Pg9NgC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=gurage+harala&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sZCpOdhsWH&amp;sig=9ThpLFqdKpCznUeX5CQHd1KpMMk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwil_MzWtsLNAhVo5oMKHYVMDPgQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=gurageland%20harala&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the inhabitants of the Gurage Zone were reported as Muslim, with 51.02% of the population reporting that belief, while 41.91% practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, 5.79% were Protestants, and 1.12% Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report

According to the 1994 Ethiopian census, self-identifying Gurage comprise about 4.3% of Ethiopia's population, or about 3 million people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bxabeg.people.wm.edu/Ethiopia.Census%20Portrait.pdf Ethiopia: A Model Nation of Minorities] (accessed 6 April 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The populations of Gurage people are not exactly known because approximately half of the population live outside of the Gurage zone and many believe that the Gurage people may have the third largest populations, next to the Oromo's and the Amhara's.

The Gurage live a sedentary life based on agriculture, involving a complex system of [[crop rotation]] and transplanting. Gurage people are known as hard workers and as a model of good work culture in the whole Ethiopia.[[Ensete]] is the main [[staple food]], but other [[cash crop]]s are grown, which include [[coffee]] and [[khat]], both traditional [[stimulant]]s. [[Animal husbandry]] is practiced, but mainly for milk supply and dung. Other foods consumed include green cabbage, cheese, butter, and roasted grains, with meat consumption being very limited (also used in rituals or ceremonies).

The Gurage, the writer [[Nega Mezlekia]] notes, "have earned a reputation as skilled traders".&lt;ref&gt;Nega Mezlekia, ''Notes from the Hyena's Belly'' (New York: Picador, 2000), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; One example of an enterprising Gurage is Tekke, who Nathaniel T. Kenney described as "an Ethiopian [[Horatio Alger, Jr.]]": "He began his career selling old bottles and tin cans; the Emperor [Haile Selassie] recently rewarded his achievement in creating his plantation by calling him to Addis Ababa and decorating him."&lt;ref&gt;Kenney, "Ethiopian Adventure", ''National Geographic'', 127 (1965), p. 582.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agriculture and ensete==
[[File:Potato picking.jpg|thumb|upright|A Gurage teenager picking potatoes on one of the Ethiopian highlands]]
The principal crop of the Gurage is [[Ensete ventricosum|ensete]] (also enset, ensete edulis, äsät or "false banana plant").  This has a massive stem that grows underground and is involved in every aspect of Gurage life. It has a place in everyday interactions among community members as well as specific roles in rituals. For example: the ritual uses of Ensete include wrapping a corpse after death with the fronds and tying off the umbilical cord after birth with an ensete fiber; the practical uses include wrapping goods and fireproofing thatch.&lt;ref name="Shack 117" /&gt;  Ensete is also exchanged as part of a variety of social interactions, and used as a recompense for services rendered.&lt;ref name="Shack 121"&gt;Shack, Dorothy. "Nutritional Processes and Personality Development among the Gurage of Ethiopia" in ''Food and Culture: A Reader''. Ed. Carole Counihan and Penny van Esterik. (New York: Routledge, 1997). p121.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Ensete is totally involved in every aspect of the daily social and ritual life of the Gurage, who, with several others tribes in Southwest Ethiopia, form what has been termed the ''Ensete Culture Complex'' area... the life of the Gurage is enmeshed with various uses of ensete, not the least of which is nutritional.&lt;ref name="Shack 117"&gt;Shack, Dorothy. "Nutritional Processes and Personality Development among the Gurage of Ethiopia" in ''Food and Culture: A Reader''. Ed. Carole Counihan and Penny van Esterik. (New York: Routledge, 1997). p117.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Ensete can be prepared in a variety of ways. A normal Gurage diet consists primarily of kocho, a thick bread made from ensete, and is supplemented by cabbage, cheese, butter and grains. Meat is not consumed on a regular basis, but usually eaten when an animal is sacrificed during a ritual or ceremonial event.&lt;ref name="Shack 117" /&gt; The Gurage pound the root of the Ensete to extract the edible substance, then place it in deep pits between the rows of ensete plants in the field.  It ferments in the pit, which makes it more palatable.  It can be stored for up to several years in this fashion, and the Gurage typically retain large surpluses of ensete as a protection against famine.&lt;ref name="Shack 121" /&gt;  The resulting paste is used to make porridge and bread. The only way to eat ensete is to make into a paste.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In addition to ensete, a few cash crops are maintained (notably [[coffee]] and [[khat]]) and livestock is raised (mainly for milk and fertilizer). Some Gurage also plant [[Eragrostis tef|teff]] and eat [[injera]] (which the Gurage also call injera).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authors=Girma A. Demeke and Ronny Meyer | url=http://cfee.cnrs.fr/IMG/pdf/Girma_Demeke_Meyer_english.pdf | title=Contact-induced language change in selected Ethiopian Semitic Languages | format=PDF | publisher=Centre français des études éthiopiennes | date={{Date|2011-06-14}} | accessdate={{Date|2014-11-06}} | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106064828/http://cfee.cnrs.fr/IMG/pdf/Girma_Demeke_Meyer_english.pdf | archivedate=2014-11-06 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gurage raise [[zebu]]. These [[cattle]] are primarily kept for their butter, and a typical Gurage household has a large quantity of spiced butter aging in clay pots hung from the walls of their huts. Butter is believed to be medicinal, and the Gurage often take it internally or use it a lotion or poultice. A Gurage proverb states that "A sickness that has the upper hand over butter is destined for death." Different species of ensete are also eaten to alleviate illness.&lt;ref name="Hunger, Anxiety 1971 pp. 30-43"&gt;Hunger, Anxiety, and Ritual: Deprivation and Spirit Possession Among the Gurage of Ethiopia Author(s): William A. Shack Source: Man, New Series, Vol. 6, No. 1 (Mar., 1971), pp. 30-43&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gurage regard overeating as coarse and vulgar, and regard it as poor etiquette to  eat all of the ensete that a host passes around to guests. It is considered polite to leave at least some ensete bread even after a very small portion is passed around.&lt;ref name="Hunger, Anxiety pp. 30-43"&gt;Hunger, Anxiety, and Ritual: Deprivation and Spirit Possession Among the Gurage of Ethiopia Author(s): William A. ShackSource: Man, New Series, Vol. 6, No. 1 (Mar., 1971), pp. 30-43&lt;/ref&gt;

It is typically expected that a Gurage will extend hospitality to their neighbors and kinfolk in dispensing ensete freely to them. However, Gurage often hoard extra food and eat it secretly to avoid having to share it.&lt;ref name="Hunger, Anxiety pp. 30-43"/&gt;

==Food==
The Gurage in rural highland areas centre their lives on the cultivation of their staple crop [[Ensete]]. Kocho is made by shaping the ensete paste to a thick circle and wrapping it in a thin layer of ensete leaves. Its baked in a small pit with coals.  Sometimes the paste is just cooked over a griddle. [[Kitfo]] a minced raw beef mixed with butter and spicy pepper is commonly attributed to the Gurage.

==Notable Gurage==
* Imam Baqsa and Imam Hassen Injamo, from Cheha and Kebena, respectively, were two leaders of Gurage resistance movement that began in 1875 against King Menelik's campaigns to conquer and forcefully annex Gurage to his Shewa kingdom in his effort to expand his Shewan realm and  Ethiopian empire.  In 1878 or earlier, young Habte-Giorgis,  presumed to be one of the Gurage resistance fighters of Imam Baqsa and Hassen Injamo, was captured in a battle by Menelik's soldiers and paraded in Ankobere. He later successfully integrated himself into the enemy army and became one of its zealots. A firm believer in conquest, he grew to be a Minister of War and Fitawrari (literally, a battle front leader) in Menelik's expanding kingdom.&lt;ref name=Hailemariam&gt;{{cite book|last=Hailemariam|first=Gabreyesus|title=The Guragué and Their Culture|year=1991|publisher=Vintage Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shack&gt;{{cite book|last=Shack|first=William A.|title=The Guragué: A People of the Enset Culture|year=1966|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Woodstock-kids.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Young people near the [[Woodstock]] festival in August 1969]]

A '''hippie''' (sometimes spelled '''hippy''')&lt;ref&gt;Usually an adjective denoting "large hips." See: [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hippy Hippy | Definition of Hippy by Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/hippy|title=hippy - Definition of hippy in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a member of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], originally a [[youth movement]] that began in the United States during the mid-1960s and spread to other countries around the world. The word ''[[Hippie (etymology)|hippie]]'' came from ''[[hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]]'' and used to describe [[beatnik]]s who moved into New York City's [[Greenwich Village]] and San Francisco's [[Haight-Ashbury]] district. The term ''hippie'' first found popularity in San Francisco with [[Herb Caen]], who was a journalist for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.

The origins of the terms ''[[Hip (slang)|hip]]'' and ''hep'' are uncertain.  By the 1940s, both had become part of [[African American culture|African American]] [[Glossary of jive talk|jive]] slang and meant "sophisticated; currently fashionable; fully up-to-date".&lt;ref&gt;To say "I'm hip to the situation" means "I'm aware of the situation. See: {{Citation| last = Sheidlower| first = Jesse | author-link = Jesse Sheidlower| date = December 8, 2004| title = Crying Wolof: Does the word hip really hail from a West African language?| work = [[Slate Magazine]]| url = http://www.slate.com/id/2110811/ | access-date = May 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hep |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |access-date=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hep |title=Hep - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=August 31, 2012 |access-date=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beats adopted the term ''hip'', and early hippies inherited the language and [[counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural values]] of the [[Beat Generation]]. Hippies created their own communities, listened to [[psychedelic music]], embraced the [[sexual revolution]], and many used drugs such as [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], [[peyote]] and [[psilocybin mushroom]]s to explore [[Altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]].

In 1967, the [[Human Be-In]] in [[Golden Gate Park]], San Francisco, popularized hippie culture, leading to the [[Summer of Love]] on the West Coast of the United States, and the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]] on the East Coast. Hippies in Mexico, known as ''[[jipitecas]]'', formed ''[[La Onda]]'' and gathered at [[Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro|Avándaro]], while in New Zealand, nomadic [[housetrucker]]s practiced alternative lifestyles and promoted sustainable energy at [[Nambassa]]. In the United Kingdom in 1970, many gathered at the gigantic [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|Isle of Wight Festival]] with a crowd of around 400,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;"The attendance at the third Pop Festival at...Isle of Wight, England on 30 Aug 1970 was claimed by its promoters, Fiery Creations, to be 400,000."

In Australia, hippies gathered at [[Nimbin, New South Wales|Nimbin]] for the 1973 [[Aquarius Festival]] and the annual Cannabis Law Reform Rally or [[MardiGrass]].

Hippie fashion and values had a major effect on culture, influencing [[popular music]], television, film, literature, and the arts. Since the 1960s, mainstream society has assimilated many aspects of hippie culture. The religious and [[cultural diversity]] the hippies espoused has gained widespread acceptance, and [[Eastern philosophy]] and spiritual concepts have reached a larger audience.

{{main article|Hippie (etymology)}}

[[Lexicography|Lexicographer]] [[Jesse Sheidlower]], the principal American editor of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', argues that the terms ''hipster'' and ''hippie'' derive from the word ''[[hip (slang)|hip]]'', whose origins are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''hip'' in the sense of "aware, in the know" is first attested in a 1902 cartoon by [[Tad Dorgan]],&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lighter, ''Random House Dictionary of Historical Slang''&lt;/ref&gt; and first appeared in prose in a 1904 novel by George Vere Hobart&lt;ref&gt;George Vere Hobart (January 16, 1867 – January 31, 1926)&lt;/ref&gt; (1867–1926), ''Jim Hickey: A Story of the One-Night Stands'', where an African-American character uses the slang phrase "Are you hip?"

The term ''hipster'' was coined by [[Harry Gibson]] in 1944.&lt;ref name="Harry The Hipster Gibson 1986"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1940s, the terms ''hip'', ''hep'' and ''hepcat'' were popular in [[Harlem]] [[jazz]] slang, although ''hep'' eventually came to denote an inferior status to ''hip''.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Gibson wrote: ''"At that time musicians used jive talk among themselves and many customers were picking up on it. One of these words was ''hep'' which described someone in the know. When lots of people started using ''hep'', musicians changed to ''hip''. I started calling people ''hipsters'' and greeted customers who dug the kind of jazz we were playing as 'all you hipsters.' Musicians at the club began calling me ''Harry the Hipster''; so I wrote a new tune called 'Handsome Harry the Hipster.'"'' -- "Everybody's Crazy But Me" (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Greenwich Village]] in the early 1960s, [[New York City]], young [[counterculture]] advocates were named ''hips'' because they were considered "in the know" or "cool", as opposed to being ''[[Square (slang)|square]]''. In the April 27, 1961 issue of The Village Voice, "An open letter to JFK &amp; Fidel Castro", Norman Mailer utilizes the term hippies, in questioning JFK's behavior.  In a 1961 essay, [[Kenneth Rexroth]] used both the terms ''hipster'' and ''hippies'' to refer to young people participating in black American or [[Beatnik]] nightlife.&lt;ref&gt;Rexroth, Kenneth. (1961). "[http://www.bopsecrets.org/rexroth/jazz2.htm What's Wrong with the Clubs]." ''Metronome''. Reprinted in ''Assays''&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Malcolm X]]'s 1964 autobiography, the word ''hippie'' in 1940s Harlem had been used to describe a [[wigger|specific type of white man]] who "acted more [[Negro]] than Negroes".&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Martin (2004), ''Cannabis: A History, St. Martin's Press'', p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] refers to "all the Chicago hippies," seemingly in reference to black blues/R&amp;B musicians, in his rear [[Liner notes|sleeve notes]] to the 1965 LP ''[[The Rolling Stones, Now!]]''

The word hippie was also used in reference to Philadelphia in at least two popular songs in 1963: [[South Street (song)|South Street]] by [[The Orlons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songlyrics.com/the-orlons/south-street-lyrics/|title=South Street - The Orlons|website=SongLyrics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[You Can't Sit Down]] by [[The Dovells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songlyrics.com/dovells/you-can-t-sit-down-lyrics/|title=You Can`t Sit Down - Dovells|website=SongLyrics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both songs, the term is applied to residents of Philadelphia's [[South Street (Philadelphia)|South Street]].

Although the word ''hippies'' made other isolated appearances in print during the early 1960s, the first use of the term on the West Coast appeared in the article "A New Paradise for [[Beatniks]]" (in the ''[[The San Francisco Examiner|San Francisco Examiner]]'', issue of September 5, 1965) by San Francisco journalist Michael Fallon. In that article, Fallon wrote about the Blue Unicorn Cafe ([[coffeehouse]]) (located at 1927 Hayes Street in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco), using the term ''hippie'' to refer to the new generation of beatniks who had moved from [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] into the [[Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco, California|Haight-Ashbury]] district.&lt;ref name=pc42&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19801/m1/ |title=Show 42 - The Acid Test: Defining 'hippy' |show=42 |track=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Use of the term "hippie" did not become widespread in the [[mass media]] until early 1967, after ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' [[columnist]] [[Herb Caen]] began to use the term; See "Take a Hippie to Lunch Today", S.F. Chronicle, January 20, 1967, p. 37. San Francisco Chronicle, January 18, 1967 column, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New York Times]]'' editor and usage writer [[Theodore M.

===Origins===
[[File:Hippie bug! (1043753793).jpg|thumb|left|250px|A hippie-painted [[Volkswagen Beetle]]]]
A July 1968 [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] study on hippie philosophy credited the foundation of the hippie movement with historical precedent as far back as the [[sadhu]] of India, the spiritual seekers who had renounced the world by taking "[[Sannyas]]". Even the counterculture of the Ancient Greeks, espoused by philosophers like [[Diogenes of Sinope]] and the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynics]] were also early forms of hippie culture.&lt;ref name="Time_1968"&gt;{{Citation

The first signs of modern "proto-hippies" emerged in [[fin de siècle]] Europe. Between 1896 and 1908, a German youth movement arose as a countercultural reaction to the organized social and cultural clubs that centered around German folk music. Known as ''[[Wandervogel|Der Wandervogel]]'' ("wandering bird"), the hippie movement opposed the formality of traditional German clubs, instead emphasizing amateur music and singing, creative dress, and communal outings involving hiking and camping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Some opened the first [[health food store]]s, and many moved to [[southern California]] where they could practice an alternative lifestyle in a warm climate. Over time, young Americans adopted the beliefs and practices of the new immigrants. One group, called the "Nature Boys", took to the California desert and raised organic food, espousing a back-to-nature lifestyle like the Wandervogel.&lt;ref name=LAT081004&gt;Elaine Woo, [http://articles.latimes.com/2004/aug/10/local/me-boots10 Gypsy Boots, 89; Colorful Promoter of Healthy Food and Lifestyles], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 10, 2004, Accessed December 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Songwriter [[eden ahbez]] wrote a hit song called ''[[Nature Boy (song)|Nature Boy]]'' inspired by Robert Bootzin ([[Gypsy Boots]]), who helped popularize health-consciousness, [[yoga]], and [[organic food]] in the United States.

They used alternative arts, [[street theatre]], [[folk music]], and [[psychedelic rock]] as a part of their lifestyle and as a way of expressing their feelings, their protests and their vision of the world and life.

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, novelist [[Ken Kesey]] and the [[Merry Pranksters]] lived communally in California. Members included Beat Generation hero [[Neal Cassady]], [[Ken Babbs]], [[Carolyn Garcia|Carolyn Adams (aka Mountain Girl/Carolyn Garcia)]], [[Stewart Brand]], [[Del Close]], [[Paul Foster (cartoonist)|Paul Foster]], [[Merry Pranksters|George Walker]], Sandy Lehmann-Haupt and others. Their early escapades were documented in [[Tom Wolfe]]'s book ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]''. With Cassady at the wheel of a school bus named [[Further (bus)|Further]], the Merry Pranksters traveled across the United States to celebrate the publication of Kesey's novel ''[[Sometimes a Great Notion (novel)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]'' and to visit the 1964 [[World's Fair]] in New York City. The Merry Pranksters were known for using [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[amphetamine]], and [[LSD]], and during their journey they "turned on" many people to these [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]]. The Merry Pranksters filmed and audio taped their bus trips, creating an immersive multimedia experience that would later be presented to the public in the form of festivals and concerts.

When they returned to San Francisco, Red Dog participants Luria Castell, Ellen Harman and Alton Kelley created a collective called "The Family Dog."&lt;ref name="Works"/&gt; Modeled on their Red Dog experiences, on October 16, 1965, the Family Dog hosted "[[Doctor Strange|A Tribute to Dr. Strange]]" at Longshoreman's Hall.&lt;ref name="Grunenberg_2005_325"&gt;{{harvnb|Grunenberg|Harris|2005|p=325}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Attended by approximately 1,000 of the Bay Area's original "hippies", this was San Francisco's first [[psychedelic rock]] performance, costumed dance and light show, featuring [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[The Great Society (band)|The Great Society]] and The Marbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/05/20/MNG2NPUD1C1.DTL&amp;ao=all | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Joel | last=Selvin | title=Summer of Love: 40 Years Later / 1967: The stuff that myths are made of | date=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other events followed before year's end, one at California Hall and one at the Matrix.&lt;ref name="Works" /&gt; After the first three Family Dog events, a much larger psychedelic event occurred at San Francisco's Longshoreman's Hall.

By February 1966, the Family Dog became Family Dog Productions under organizer [[Chet Helms]], promoting happenings at the [[Avalon Ballroom]] and the [[The Fillmore|Fillmore Auditorium]] in initial cooperation with [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]. The Avalon Ballroom, the Fillmore Auditorium and other venues provided settings where participants could partake of the full psychedelic music experience. Bill Ham, who had pioneered the original Red Dog light shows, perfected his art of [[Liquid light show|liquid light projection]], which combined light shows and film projection and became [[wikt:synonymous#Pronunciation|synonymous]] with the San Francisco ballroom experience.&lt;ref name="Works" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grunenberg_2005_156"&gt;{{harvnb|Grunenberg|Harris|2005|p=156}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of style and costume that began at the Red Dog Saloon flourished when San Francisco's Fox Theater went out of business and hippies bought up its costume stock, reveling in the freedom to dress up for weekly musical performances at their favorite ballrooms. As ''San Francisco Chronicle'' music columnist [[Ralph J. Gleason]] put it, "They danced all night long, orgiastic, spontaneous and completely free form."&lt;ref name="Works" /&gt;

Some of the earliest San Francisco hippies were former students at [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]]&lt;ref&gt;The college was later renamed San Francisco State University.&lt;/ref&gt; who became intrigued by the developing psychedelic hippie music scene.&lt;ref name="Works" /&gt; These students joined the bands they loved, living communally in the large, inexpensive [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] apartments in the [[Haight-Ashbury]].&lt;ref name="Perry_2005_57"&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|2005|pp=5–7}}. Perry writes that SFSC students rented cheap, Edwardian-Victorians in the Haight.&lt;/ref&gt; Young Americans around the country began moving to San Francisco, and by June 1966, around 15,000 hippies had moved into the Haight.&lt;ref name="Tompkins_2001b" /&gt; [[The Charlatans (U.S. band)|The Charlatans]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], and the [[Grateful Dead]] all moved to San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury neighborhood during this period. Activity centered around the [[Diggers (theater)|Diggers]], a guerrilla street [[theatre]] group that combined spontaneous street theatre, anarchistic action, and [[Happening|art happenings]] in their agenda to create a "free city". By late 1966, [[Diggers (theater)|the Diggers]] opened [[free stores]] which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art.&lt;ref name="Lytle_2006_213215"&gt;{{harvnb|Lytle|2006|pp=213, 215}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As explained by Allan Cohen, co-founder of the ''[[San Francisco Oracle]]'', the purpose of the rally was twofold: to draw attention to the fact that LSD had just been made illegal—and to demonstrate that people who used LSD were not criminals, nor were they mentally ill. The Grateful Dead played, and some sources claim that LSD was consumed at the rally. According to Cohen, those who took LSD "were not guilty of using illegal substances...We were celebrating transcendental consciousness, the beauty of the universe, the beauty of being."&lt;ref name="Lee_Shlain_1992_149"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Shlain|1992|p=149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sunset Strip curfew riots]], also known as the "hippie riots", were a series of early [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]-era clashes that took place between police and young people on the [[Sunset Strip]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]], in 1966 and continuing on and off through the early 1970s. In 1966, annoyed residents and business owners in the district had encouraged the passage of strict (10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.) [[curfew]] and [[loitering]] laws to reduce the traffic congestion resulting from crowds of young club patrons.&lt;ref name="LATimes 2007-08-05"&gt;{{cite news| first = Cecilia| last = Rasmussen| date = August 5, 2007| title = Closing of club ignited the 'Sunset Strip riots' | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/05/local/me-then5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was perceived by young, local rock music fans as an infringement on their [[civil rights]], and on Saturday, November 12, 1966, fliers were distributed along the Strip inviting people to demonstrate later that day.

[[File:Junction of Haight and Ashbury.jpg|thumb|Junction of Haight and Ashbury Streets, San Francisco, celebrated as the central location of the Summer of Love]]On January 14, 1967, the outdoor [[Human Be-In]] organized by [[Michael Bowen (artist)|Michael Bowen]]&lt;ref&gt;"Chronology of San Francisco Rock 1965-1969&lt;/ref&gt; helped to popularize hippie culture across the United States, with 20,000 hippies gathering in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park.

The lyrics, "If you're going to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair", inspired thousands of young people from all over the world to travel to San Francisco, sometimes wearing flowers in their hair and distributing flowers to passersby, earning them the name, "[[flower child|Flower Children]]". Bands like the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] (with [[Janis Joplin]]), and [[Jefferson Airplane]] lived in the Haight.

In June 1967, [[Herb Caen]] was approached by "a distinguished magazine"&lt;ref name=Caen/&gt; to write about why hippies were attracted to San Francisco. He declined the assignment but interviewed hippies in the Haight for his own newspaper column in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. Caen determined that, "Except in their music, they couldn't care less about the approval of the straight world."&lt;ref name=Caen/&gt; Caen himself felt that the city of San Francisco was so straight that it provided a visible contrast with hippie culture.&lt;ref name=Caen&gt;SFGate.com.

Retrieved on June 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 7, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine featured a cover story entitled, "The Hippies: The Philosophy of a Subculture." The article described the guidelines of the hippie code: "Do your own thing, wherever you have to do it and whenever you want. Drop out. Leave society as you have known it. Leave it utterly. Blow the mind of every straight person you can reach. Turn them on, if not to drugs, then to beauty, love, honesty, fun."&lt;ref name="Marty_1997_125"&gt;{{harvnb|Marty|1997|pp=125}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that around 100,000 people traveled to San Francisco in the summer of 1967. The media was right behind them, casting a spotlight on the Haight-Ashbury district and popularizing the "hippie" label. With this increased attention, hippies found support for their ideals of love and peace but were also criticized for their anti-work, pro-drug, and permissive ethos.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===1967–1969: Revolution===
[[File:August 25, 1968, Hippies in Lincoln Park, Chicago.webm|thumb|right|250px|thumbtime=0:45|Anti-war protesters in [[Lincoln Park, Chicago]], attending a [[Yippie]] organized event, approximately five miles north of the [[1968 Democratic National convention]]. The band [[MC5]] can be seen playing.]]

By 1968, hippie-influenced fashions were beginning to take off in the mainstream, especially for youths and younger adults of the populous "[[Baby Boomer]]" generation, many of whom may have aspired to emulate the hardcore movements now living in tribalistic communes, but had no overt connections to them. This was noticed not only in terms of clothes and also longer hair for men, but also in music, film, art, and literature, and not just in the US, but around the world. [[Eugene McCarthy]]'s brief presidential campaign successfully persuaded a significant minority of young adults to "get clean for Gene" by shaving their beards or wearing longer skirts; however the "Clean Genes" had little impact on the popular image in the media spotlight, of the hirsute hippy adorned in beads, feathers, flowers and bells.

A sign of this was the visibility that the hippie subculture gained in various mainstream and underground media. [[Hippie exploitation films]] are 1960s [[exploitation films]] about the hippie counterculture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesocietyofthespectacle.com/2009/04/mondo-mod-worlds-of-hippie-revolt-and-other-weirdness/ |title=Mondo Mod Worlds Of Hippie Revolt (And Other Weirdness) |publisher=Thesocietyofthespectacle.com |date=April 5, 2009 |accessdate=2014-02-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112091111/http://thesocietyofthespectacle.com/2009/04/mondo-mod-worlds-of-hippie-revolt-and-other-weirdness/ |archive-date=November 12, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with stereotypical situations associated with the movement such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[LSD]] use, sex and wild psychedelic parties. Examples include ''[[The Love-ins]]'', ''[[Psych-Out]]'', ''[[The Trip (1967 film)|The Trip]]'', and ''[[Wild in the Streets]]''. Other more serious and more critically acclaimed films about the hippie counterculture also appeared such as ''[[Easy Rider]]'' and ''[[Alice's Restaurant (film)|Alice's Restaurant]]''. (See also: [[List of films related to the hippie subculture]].) Documentaries and television programs have also been produced until today as well as [[List of books and publications related to the hippie subculture|fiction and nonfiction books]]. The popular Broadway musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' was presented in 1967.

People commonly label other cultural movements of that period as hippie, however there are differences. For example, hippies were often not directly engaged in politics, as contrasted with "Yippies" (Youth International Party), an activist organization. The [[Yippies]] came to national attention during their celebration of the 1968 spring equinox, when some 3,000 of them took over [[Grand Central Terminal]] in New York—eventually resulting in 61 arrests. The Yippies, especially their leaders [[Abbie Hoffman]] and [[Jerry Rubin]], became notorious for their theatrics, such as trying to levitate the Pentagon at the October 1967 war protest, and such slogans as "Rise up and abandon the creeping meatball!" Their stated intention to protest the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago in August, including nominating their own candidate, "[[Pigasus (politics)|Lyndon Pigasus Pig]]" (an actual pig), was also widely publicized in the media at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=iPad iPhone Android TIME TV Populist The Page |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900067,00.html |title="The Politics of Yip", ''TIME Magazine'', Apr. 5, 1968 |publisher=Time.com |date=April 5, 1968 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cambridge, hippies congregated each Sunday for a large "be-in" at Cambridge Park with swarms of drummers and those beginning the Women's Movement. In the US the Hippie movement started to be seen as part of the "[[New Left]]" which was associated with anti-war college campus protest movements.&lt;ref name="Carmines and Layman" /&gt; The New Left was a term used mainly in the United Kingdom and United States in reference to [[social activism|activists]], [[educator]]s, [[agitators]] and others in the 1960s and 1970s who sought to implement a broad range of reforms on issues such as gay rights, abortion, gender roles and drugs&lt;ref name="Carmines and Layman"&gt;Carmines, Edward G., and Geoffrey C.

In April 1969, the building of [[People's Park (Berkeley)|People's Park]] in Berkeley, California received international attention. The [[University of California, Berkeley]] had demolished all the buildings on a {{convert|2.8|acre|m2|sing=on}} parcel near campus, intending to use the land to build playing fields and a parking lot. After a long delay, during which the site became a dangerous eyesore, thousands of ordinary Berkeley citizens, merchants, students, and hippies took matters into their own hands, planting trees, shrubs, flowers and grass to convert the land into a park. A major confrontation ensued on May 15, 1969, when Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] ordered the park destroyed, which led to a two-week occupation of the city of Berkeley by the [[California National Guard]].&lt;ref name="Wollenberg"&gt;{{Citation|last=Wollenberg |first=Charles |title=Berkeley, A City in History |publisher=University of California Press |year=2008 |isbn=0-520-25307-8 |url=http://www.berkeleypubliclibrary.org/system/Chapter9.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705015337/http://www.berkeleypubliclibrary.org/system/Chapter9.html |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hayward_2001&gt;{{Citation|last=Hayward|first=Steven F.|title=The Age of Reagan, 1964-1980: The Fall of the Old Liberal Order|year=2001|publisher=Prima Publishing|location=Roseville, California|isbn=978-0-7615-1337-7|oclc=47667257|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0BafgsBIlrwC&amp;pg=PA325|accessdate=January 31, 2011|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flower power]] came into its own during this occupation as hippies engaged in acts of [[civil disobedience]] to plant flowers in empty lots all over Berkeley under the slogan "Let a Thousand Parks Bloom".

===1970–present: Aftershocks===
[[File:RussianRainbowGathering 4Aug2005.jpg|thumb|upright|Contemporary hippie at the [[Rainbow Gathering]] in Russia, 2005]]
By the 1970s, the 1960s [[zeitgeist]] that had spawned hippie culture seemed to be on the wane.&lt;ref name="Bugliosi_1994"&gt;{{harvnb|Bugliosi|Gentry|1994|pp=638–640}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bugliosi (1994) describes the popular view that the Manson case "sounded the death knell for hippies and all they symbolically represented", citing [[Joan Didion]], [[Diane Sawyer]], and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. Bugliosi admits that although the Manson murders "may have hastened" the end of the hippie era, the era was already in decline.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/opinion/sunday/the-entrepreneurial-generation.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;smid=fb-share | work=New York Times | title=Generation Sell | date=November 12, 2011 | accessdate=2011-12-03 | first1=William | last1=Deresiewics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events at [[Altamont Free Concert]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=208_1226021428 |title=Murder At Altamont |publisher=LiveLeak.com |date=November 28, 1969 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; shocked many Americans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/on-this-day/On-This-Day--Deaths-at-Rolling-Stones--Altamont-Concert-Shocks-the-Nation.html |title=On This Day: Four Die at Rolling Stones’ Altamont Concert |publisher=Findingdulcinea.com |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; including those who had strongly identified with hippie culture. Another shock came in the form of the [[Sharon Tate]] and [[Leno and Rosemary LaBianca]] murders committed in August 1969 by [[Charles Manson]] and his "family" of followers. Nevertheless, the turbulent political atmosphere that featured the bombing of Cambodia and shootings by [[National Guard of the United States|National Guardsmen]] at [[Jackson State killings|Jackson State University]] and [[Kent State shootings|Kent State University]] still brought people together. These shootings inspired the May 1970 song by [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]] "What About Me?", where they sang, "You keep adding to my numbers as you shoot my people down", as well as [[Neil Young]]'s "[[Ohio (CSNY song)|Ohio]]", a song that protested the US's expansion of the [[Vietnam War]] into Cambodia, recorded by [[Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash (and Young)|Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]].

Much of hippie style had been integrated into [[mainstream]] American society by the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Tompkins_2001a"&gt;{{harvnb|Tompkins|2001a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morford"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large rock concerts that originated with the 1967 KFRC [[Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival]] and [[Monterey Pop Festival]] and the British [[Isle of Wight Festival]] in 1968 became the norm, evolving into [[Arena rock|stadium rock]] in the process. The anti-war movement reached its peak at the [[1971 May Day Protests]] as over 12,000 protesters were arrested in Washington DC. President Nixon himself actually ventured out of the White House and chatted with a group of the 'hippie' protesters. The draft was ended soon thereafter, in 1973. During the mid 1970s, with the [[Fall of Saigon|end]] of the draft and the [[Vietnam War]], a renewal of [[patriotism|patriotic]] sentiment associated with the approach of the [[United States Bicentennial]] and the emergence of [[punk movement|punk]] in London, Manchester, New York and Los Angeles, the mainstream media lost interest in the hippie counterculture. At the same time there was [[Mod revival|a revival of the Mod subculture]], skinheads, [[Teddy Boy|teddy boys]] and the emergence of new youth cultures, like the [[goth subculture|goths]] (an arty offshoot of punk) and [[football casuals]]. Acid rock gave way to [[prog rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[disco]], and [[punk rock]].

Starting in the late 1960s, hippies began to come under attack by [[skinhead]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/?id=iS4hsxKiMNgC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=Hippie+bashing+by+skinheads#PPA189,M1 | title = Encyclopedia of contemporary British culture | isbn = 978-0-415-14726-2 | author1 = Childs | first1 = Peter | last2 = Storry | first2 = Mike | year = 1999 | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eelpie.org/epd_19.htm |title=Eel Pie Dharma - Skinheads - Chapter 19 |publisher=Eelpie.org |date=December 13, 2005 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,909318-1,00.html | work=Time | title=Britain: The Skinheads | date=June 8, 1970 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hippies were also vilified and sometimes attacked by [[Punk subculture|punks]], [[Mod revival|revivalist mods]], [[Greaser (subculture)|greasers]], football [[casual (subculture)|casuals]], [[Teddy boy]]s, [[heavy metal subculture|metalheads]], [[rocker (subculture)|rockers]], [[redneck]]s, [[rude boy]]s, [[gangster]]s, and members of other youth subcultures of the 1970s and 1980s in both [[North America]] and Europe. The countercultural movement was also under covert assault by [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s infamous "Counter Intelligence Program" ([[COINTELPRO]]), but in some countries it was other youth groups that were a threat. Hippie ideals had a marked influence on [[anarcho-punk]] and some [[post-punk]] youth subcultures, especially during the [[Second Summer of Love]].

Hippie communes, where members tried to live the ideals of the hippie movement, continued to flourish. On the west coast, Oregon had quite a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cavejunction.com/cavejunction/locsites2.shtml |title=In Cave Junction alone there were a number of communes listed |publisher=Cavejunction.com |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some faded away. Some are still around.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

While many hippies made a long-term commitment to the lifestyle, some people argue that hippies "sold out" during the 1980s and became part of the materialist, consumer culture.&lt;ref name="Lattin_2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Lattin|2004|pp=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heath_Potter_2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Heath|Potter|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not as visible as it once was, hippie culture has never died out completely: hippies and neo-hippies can still be found on college campuses, on communes, and at gatherings and festivals. Many embrace the hippie values of peace, love, and community, and hippies may still be found in [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] enclaves around the world.&lt;ref name="Stone_1994" /&gt;

[[File:Tie-dye hippie.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tie-dyed clothes, associated with hippie culture]]
The bohemian predecessor of the hippie culture in San Francisco was the "[[Beat Generation]]" style of coffee houses and bars, whose clientele appreciated literature, a game of chess, music (in the forms of jazz and folk style), modern dance, and traditional crafts and arts like pottery and painting."&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Karen 2001 ''Joni Mitchell: Shadows and Light''. London:Virgin Books, pp.77-78&lt;/ref&gt; The entire tone of the ''new'' subculture was different. "Jon McIntire, manager of the Grateful Dead from the late sixties to the mid-eighties, points out that the great contribution of the hippie culture was this projection of [[joy]]. The beatnik thing was black, cynical, and cold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Greenfield |first=Robert |format=interview |title=The Burden of Being Jerry |url=http://www.levity.com/gans/SFFocus.html |accessdate=2013-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hippies sought to free themselves from societal restrictions, choose their own way, and find new [[meaning of life|meaning in life]]. One expression of hippie independence from societal norms was found in their standard of dress and grooming, which made hippies instantly recognizable to one another, and served as a visual symbol of their respect for individual rights. Through their appearance, hippies declared their willingness to question authority, and distanced themselves from the "straight" and "[[square (slang)|square]]" (i.e., conformist) segments of society.&lt;ref name="Yablonsky_1968_243357"&gt;{{harvnb|Yablonsky|1968|pp=103 et al.}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personality traits]] and values that hippies tend to be associated with are "[[altruism]] and [[mysticism]], [[honesty]], [[joy]] and [[nonviolence]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=iPad iPhone Android TIME TV Populist The Page |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899555-1,00.html |title="The Hippies" in Time magazine |publisher=Time.com |date=July 7, 1967 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, many thoughtful hippies distanced themselves from the very idea that the way a person dresses could be a reliable signal of who he or she was—especially after outright criminals such as [[Charles Manson]] began to adopt superficial hippie characteristics, and also after plainclothes policemen started to "dress like hippies" to [[divide and rule|divide and conquer]] legitimate members of the counterculture. [[Frank Zappa]], known for lampooning hippie ethos, particularly with songs like "[[Who Needs the Peace Corps?]]" (1968), admonished his audience that "we all wear a uniform". The San Francisco clown/hippie [[Wavy Gravy]] said in 1987 that he could still see fellow-feeling in the eyes of [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] businessmen who had dressed conventionally to survive.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Leading proponents of the 1960s Psychedelic Art movement were San Francisco poster artists such as: [[Rick Griffin]], [[Victor Moscoso]], [[Bonnie MacLean]], [[Stanley Mouse]] &amp; [[Alton Kelley]], and [[Wes Wilson]]. Their Psychedelic Rock concert posters were inspired by [[Art Nouveau]], Victoriana, [[Dada]], and [[Pop Art]]. Posters for concerts in the [[Fillmore West]], a concert auditorium in San Francisco, popular with Hippie audiences, were among the most notable of the time. Richly saturated colors in glaring contrast, elaborately ornate lettering, strongly symmetrical composition, collage elements, rubber-like distortions, and bizarre iconography are all hallmarks of the San Francisco psychedelic poster art style. The style flourished from roughly the years 1966 to 1972. Their work was immediately influential to album cover art, and indeed all of the aforementioned artists also created album covers. Psychedelic light-shows were a new art-form developed for rock concerts. Using oil and dye in an emulsion that was set between large convex lenses upon overhead projectors, the lightshow artists created bubbling liquid visuals that pulsed in rhythm to the music. This was mixed with slide shows and film loops to create an improvisational motion picture art form, and to give visual representation to the improvisational jams of the rock bands and create a completely "trippy" atmosphere for the audience.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The [[Brotherhood of Light]] were responsible for many of the light-shows in San Francisco psychedelic rock concerts.

Out of the psychedelic counterculture there also arose a new genre of comic books: [[underground comix]]. ''Zap Comix'' was among the original underground comics, and featured the work of [[Robert Crumb]], [[S. Clay Wilson]], [[Victor Moscoso]], [[Rick Griffin]], and [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]] among others. Underground comix were ribald, intensely satirical, and seemed to pursue weirdness for the sake of weirdness. [[Gilbert Shelton]] created perhaps the most enduring of underground cartoon characters, ''[[The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]'', whose drugged-out exploits held a mirror up to the hippie lifestyle of the 1960s.

As in the beat movement preceding them, and the [[punk movement]] that followed soon after, hippie symbols and iconography were purposely borrowed from either "low" or "primitive" cultures, with hippie fashion reflecting a disorderly, often [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrant]] style.&lt;ref name="Katz_1988_120"&gt;{{harvnb|Katz|1988|pp=120}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As with other adolescent, white middle-class movements, [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]] of the hippies involved challenging the prevailing [[gender differences]] of their time: both men and women in the hippie movement wore jeans and maintained long hair,&lt;ref name="Katz_1988_125"&gt;{{harvnb|Katz|1988|pp=125}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and both genders wore sandals, moccasins or went [[barefoot]].&lt;ref name="Tompkins_2001b" /&gt; Men often wore beards,&lt;ref name="Pendergast" /&gt; while women wore little or no makeup, with many going [[History of brassieres#Feminist protests, Miss America, and "bra burning"|braless]].&lt;ref name="Tompkins_2001b"&gt;{{harvnb|Tompkins|2001b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hippies often chose brightly colored clothing and wore unusual [[Styles of clothing|styles]], such as [[Bell-bottoms|bell-bottom]] pants, vests, [[tie-dye]]d garments, [[dashiki]]s, [[peasant blouses]], and long, full skirts; non-Western inspired clothing with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], Asian, African and [[Latin America]]n motifs were also popular. Much hippie clothing was self-made in defiance of corporate culture, and hippies often purchased their clothes from flea markets and second-hand shops.&lt;ref name="Pendergast" /&gt; Favored accessories for both men and women included Native American jewelry, head scarves, headbands and [[Love beads|long beaded necklaces]].&lt;ref name="Tompkins_2001b" /&gt; Hippie homes, vehicles and other possessions were often decorated with [[psychedelic art]]. The bold colors, hand-made clothing and loose fitting clothes opposed the tight and uniform clothing of the 1940s and 1950s. It also rejected consumerism in that the hand-production of clothing called for self-efficiency and individuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pendergast|first=Sara|title=Fashion, Costume, and Culture: Clothing, Headwear, Body Decorations, and Footwear Through the Ages|year=2004|publisher=UXL|location=Detroit|page=640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Love and sex ===
{{See also|Free love}}
[[File:Oz Mag Number 28.png|thumb|left|200px|''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' number 28, also known as the "[[Schoolkids OZ|Schoolkids issue of OZ]]", which was the main cause of a 1971 high-profile obscenity case in the United Kingdom. ''Oz'' was a UK underground publication with a general hippie / counter-cultural point of view.]]

The common stereotype on the issues of love and sex had it that the hippies were "[[promiscuous]], having wild sex [[orgies]], seducing innocent teenagers and every manner of sexual perversion."&lt;ref name="StonesexII"&gt;{{harvnb|Stone|1999|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm "Sex, Love and Hippies"]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hippie movement appeared concurrently in the midst of a rising [[sexual revolution]], in which many views of the ''status quo'' on this subject were being challenged.

The clinical study ''[[Human Sexual Response (book)|Human Sexual Response]]'' was published by [[Masters and Johnson]] in 1966, and the topic suddenly became more commonplace in America. The 1969 book ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (book)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'' by psychiatrist [[David Reuben (sex author)|David Reuben]] was a more popular attempt at answering the public's curiosity regarding such matters. Then in 1972 appeared ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' by [[Alex Comfort]], reflecting an even more candid perception of love-making. By this time, the recreational or 'fun' aspects of sexual behavior were being discussed more openly than ever before, and this more 'enlightened' outlook resulted not just from the publication of such new books as these, but from a more pervasive sexual revolution that had already been well underway for some time.&lt;ref name="StonesexII"/&gt;

The hippies inherited various countercultural views and practices regarding sex and love from the [[Beat Generation]]; "their writings influenced the hippies to open up when it came to sex, and to experiment without guilt or [[jealousy]]."&lt;ref name="StonesexIII"&gt;"Again the Beat generation must be credited with living and writing about sexual freedom. Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs and others lived unusually free, sexually expressive lives."{{harvnb|Stone|1999|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm "Sex, Love and Hippies"]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One popular hippie slogan that appeared was "If it feels good, do it!"&lt;ref name="StonesexII" /&gt; which for many "meant you were free to love whomever you pleased, whenever you pleased, however you pleased". This encouraged spontaneous sexual activity and experimentation. [[Group sex]], [[public sex]], [[homosexuality]] under the influence of drugs, all the taboos went out the window. This doesn't mean that straight sex or [[monogamy]] were unknown, quite the contrary. Nevertheless, the [[open relationship]] became an accepted part of the hippy lifestyle. This meant that you might have a primary relationship with one person, but if another attracted you, you could explore that relationship without rancor or jealousy."&lt;ref name="StonesexII"/&gt;

Hippies embraced the old slogan of [[free love]] of the radical social reformers of other eras; it was accordingly observed that "Free love made the whole love, marriage, sex, baby package obsolete. Love was no longer limited to one person, you could love anyone you chose. In fact love was something you shared with everyone, not just your sex partners. Love exists to be shared freely. We also discovered the more you share, the more you get! So why reserve your love for a select few? This profound truth was one of the great hippie revelations."&lt;ref name="StonesexII"/&gt; Sexual experimentation alongside psychedelics also occurred, due to the perception of their being uninhibitors.&lt;ref name="StonesexIV"&gt;"But the biggest release of inhibitions came about through the use of drugs, particularly marijuana and the psychedelics. Marijuana is one of the best aphrodisiacs known to man. It enhances the senses, unlike alcohol, which dulls them. As any hippie can tell you, sex is a great high, but sex on pot is fuckin' far out![...] More importantly, the use of psychedelic drugs, especially LSD was directly responsible for liberating hippies from their sexual hang-ups. The LSD trip is an intimate soul wrenching experience that shatters the ego's defenses, leaving the tripper in a very poignant and sensitive state. At this point, a sexual encounter is quite possible if conditions are right. After an LSD trip, one is much more likely to explore one's own sexual nature without inhibitions." {{harvnb|Stone|1999|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm "Sex, Love and Hippies"]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others explored [[Religion and sexuality|the spiritual aspects of sex]].&lt;ref name="StonesexV"&gt;"Many hippies on the spiritual path found enlightenment through sex. The ''[[Kama Sutra]]'', the [[Tantric sex]]ual manual from ancient India is a way to cosmic union through sex. Some gurus like Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (Osho) formed cults that focused on liberation through the release of sexual inhibitions"{{harvnb|Stone|1999|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm "Sex, Love and Hippies"]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel===
[[File:Gypsy Van Front.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hand-crafted Hippie Truck, 1968]]
Hippies tended to travel light, and could pick up and go wherever the action was at any time. Whether at a "love-in" on [[Mount Tamalpais]] near San Francisco, a demonstration against the Vietnam War in Berkeley, or one of [[Ken Kesey]]'s "Acid Tests", if the "vibe" wasn't right and a change of scene was desired, hippies were mobile at a moment's notice. Planning was eschewed, as hippies were happy to put a few clothes in a backpack, stick out their thumbs and hitchhike anywhere. Hippies seldom worried whether they had money, hotel reservations or any of the other standard accoutrements of travel. Hippie households welcomed overnight guests on an ''impromptu'' basis, and the reciprocal nature of the lifestyle permitted greater freedom of movement. People generally cooperated to meet each other's needs in ways that became less common after the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{harvnb|Yablonsky|1968|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; This way of life is still seen among [[Rainbow Family]] groups, [[new age travellers]] and New Zealand's [[housetrucker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sharkey |first=Mr. |last2=Fay |first2=Chris |title=Gypsy Faire |publisher=www.mrsharkey.com |url=http://www.mrsharkey.com/busbarn/misctruk/gypsytrk.htm |accessdate=2007-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113204525/http://www.mrsharkey.com/busbarn/misctruk/gypsytrk.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gypsy Van Interior.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hippie Truck interior]]
A derivative of this free-flow style of travel were the hippie trucks and buses, hand-crafted mobile houses built on a truck or bus chassis to facilitate a nomadic lifestyle, as documented in the 1974 book ''Roll Your Own''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrsharkey.com/busbarn/rollown/rollown.htm |title=Book Review - Roll Your Own |publisher=MrSharkey.Com |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102043642/http://www.mrsharkey.com/busbarn/rollown/rollown.htm |archivedate=November 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these mobile gypsy houses were quite elaborate, with beds, toilets, showers and cooking facilities.

On the West Coast, a unique lifestyle developed around the [[Renaissance Faire]]s that Phyllis and Ron Patterson first organized in 1963. During the summer and fall months, entire families traveled together in their trucks and buses, parked at Renaissance Pleasure Faire sites in Southern and Northern California, worked their crafts during the week, and donned Elizabethan costume for weekend performances, and attended booths where handmade goods were sold to the public. The sheer number of young people living at the time made for unprecedented travel opportunities to special happenings. The peak experience of this type was the [[Woodstock Festival]] near [[Bethel, New York|Bethel]], New York, from August 15 to 18, 1969, which drew between 400,000 and 500,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/18/newsid_2760000/2760911.stm BBC - On This Day] - 1969: Woodstock music festival ends.

====Hippie trail====
{{Main article|Hippie trail}}
One travel experience, undertaken by hundreds of thousands of hippies between 1969 and 1971, was the [[Hippie trail]] overland route to India. Carrying little or no luggage, and with small amounts of cash, almost all followed the same route, hitch-hiking across Europe to [[Athens]] and on to [[Istanbul]], then by train through central Turkey via [[Erzurum]], continuing by bus into Iran, via [[Tabriz]] and [[Tehran]] to [[Mashhad]], across the Afghan border into [[Herat]], through southern Afghanistan via [[Kandahar]] to [[Kabul]], over the [[Khyber Pass]] into Pakistan, via [[Rawalpindi]] and [[Lahore]] to the Indian frontier. Once in India, hippies went to many different destinations, but gathered in large numbers on the beaches of [[Goa]] and [[Kovalam]] in [[Trivandrum]] ([[Kerala]]),&lt;ref name="Sherwood"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2006/04/09/travel/09goa.html|title=A New Generation of Pilgrims Hits India's Hippie Trail |last=Sherwood|first=Seth|publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=2008-09-11 | date=April 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; or crossed the border into Nepal to spend months in [[Kathmandu]]. In Kathmandu, most of the hippies hung out in the tranquil surroundings of a place called Freak Street,&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ioltravel.co.za/article/view/3549557|title=Have a high time on hippy trail in Katmandu|date=January 30, 2001|publisher=Independent Online|accessdate=2008-09-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011064213/http://www.ioltravel.co.za/article/view/3549557 |archivedate = October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: Jhoo Chhen) which still exists near Kathmandu Durbar Square.

===Spirituality and religion===
{{See also|Dudeism|Jesus movement}}
Many hippies rejected mainstream organized religion in favor of a more personal spiritual experience.  Buddhism, Hinduism, Sufism often resonated with hippies, as they were seen as less rule-bound, and less likely to be associated with existing baggage.&lt;ref name="hare"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111129151747/http://dissentmagazine.org/online.php?id=552 In Defense of Hippies] - Danny Goldberg. Dissent Magazine Online. Internet Archive: Retrieved December 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Some hippies embraced [[neo-paganism]], especially [[Wicca]]. Others were involved with the occult, with people like [[Timothy Leary]] citing [[Aleister Crowley]] as influences. By the 1960s, western interest in Hindu spirituality and [[yoga]] reached its peak, giving rise to a great number of [[Hindu revivalism|Neo-Hindu]] schools specifically advocated to a western public.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant 2009, p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1991 book, "Hippies and American Values", Timothy Miller described the hippie ethos as essentially a "religious movement" whose goal was to transcend the limitations of mainstream religious institutions. "Like many dissenting religions, the hippies were enormously hostile to the religious institutions of the dominant culture, and they tried to find new and adequate ways to do the tasks the dominant religions failed to perform."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7F31yYxOMAC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=hippie+as+a+religious+movements#v=onepage&amp;q=hippie%20as%20a%20religious%20movements&amp;f=false |title=Timothy Miller.

One such hippie "high priest" was San Francisco State University Professor [[Stephen Gaskin]].  Beginning in 1966, Gaskin's "Monday Night Class" eventually outgrew the lecture hall, and attracted 1,500 hippie followers in an open discussion of spiritual values, drawing from Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu teachings.  In 1970 Gaskin founded a Tennessee community called [[The Farm (Tennessee)|The Farm]], and he still lists his religion as "Hippie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefarm.org/lifestyle/miller.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990210081737/http://www.thefarm.org/lifestyle/miller.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1999-02-10 |title=Communal Religions |publisher=Thefarm.org |date=October 6, 1966 |accessdate=2012-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokeofthetown.com/2010/12/new_book_tells_inside_story_of_biggest_hippie_comm.php |title=New Book Tells Inside Story Of Biggest Hippie Commune In U.S. - Toke of the Town - cannabis news, views, rumor and humor |publisher=Toke of the Town |date=December 23, 2010 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ISBN=9781570671814|title=Monday Night Class|author=Stephen Gaskin  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Timothy Leary]] was an American [[psychology|psychologist]] and writer, known for his advocacy of [[psychedelic drugs]]. On September 19, 1966, Leary founded the [[League for Spiritual Discovery]], a religion declaring LSD as its holy sacrament, in part as an unsuccessful attempt to maintain legal status for the use of LSD and other psychedelics for the religion's adherents based on a "freedom of religion" argument. ''[[The Psychedelic Experience]]'' was the inspiration for [[John Lennon]]'s song "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]" in [[The Beatles]]' album ''[[Revolver (The Beatles album)|Revolver]]''.&lt;ref name="Sante"&gt;{{cite news| last = Sante| first = Luc| title = The Nutty Professor| series = 'Timothy Leary: A Biography,' by Robert Greenfield| work=[[The New York Times Book Review]]| date = June 26, 2006| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/books/review/25sante.html?pagewanted=all| accessdate = 2008-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published a pamphlet in 1967 called ''Start Your Own Religion'' to encourage just that&lt;ref&gt;Start Your Own Religion.

[[The Beatles]] included him as one of [[List of images on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|the many figures]] on the cover sleeve of their 1967 album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' while [[Jimmy Page]], the guitarist of [[The Yardbirds]] and co-founder of 1970s rock band [[Led Zeppelin]] was fascinated by Crowley, and owned some of his clothing, manuscripts and ritual objects, and during the 1970s bought [[Boleskine House]], which also appears in the band's movie ''[[The Song Remains the Same (film)|The Song Remains the Same]]''. On the back cover of [[the Doors]] compilation album ''[[13 (The Doors album)|13]]'', Jim Morrison and the other members of the Doors are shown posing with a bust of Aleister Crowley.

After the hippie era, the Dudeist [[philosophy]] and lifestyle developed.  Inspired by "The Dude", the neo-hippie protagonist of the [[Coen Brothers]]' 1998 film ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', Dudeism's stated primary objective is to promote a modern form of Chinese [[Taoism]], outlined in ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' by [[Laozi]] (6th century BC), blended with concepts by the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Epicurus]] (341-270 BC), and presented in a style as personified by the character of Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski, a fictional hippie character portrayed by [[Jeff Bridges]] in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ehrlich|first=Richard|title=The man who founded a religion based on 'The Big Lebowski'|url=http://www.cnngo.com/bangkok/life/doctrine-chiang-mais-church-latter-day-dude-explained-206793|work=[[CNN]]|publisher=Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc.|accessdate=March 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405065606/http://www.cnngo.com/bangkok/life/doctrine-chiang-mais-church-latter-day-dude-explained-206793|archive-date=April 5, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dudeism has sometimes been regarded as a [[mock religion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPtuaV7IAt0C&amp;pg=PT78&amp;dq=dudeism+mock+religion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CInPT8jFHqjz0gH81aiFCA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dudeism%20mock%20religion&amp;f=false|title=Cult Cinema by Ernest Mathlijs, Jamie Sexton p. 78|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlla/big-lebowski-bungalow-jeff-bridges-abide-guide-oliver-benjamin-dwayne-eutsey_b34556|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810001531/http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlla/big-lebowski-bungalow-jeff-bridges-abide-guide-oliver-benjamin-dwayne-eutsey_b34556|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-08-10|title=You are being redirected...|website=www.mediabistro.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; though its founder and many adherents regard it seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dontpaniconline.com/magazine/radar/big-lebowski-spawns-religion|title=Big Lebowski Spawns Religion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://otisryanproductions.blogspot.com/2012/02/interview-oliver-benjamin-founder-of.html INTERVIEW: Oliver Benjamin, Founder of Dudeism &amp; Author of "The Abide Guide: Living Like Lebowski"] - Otis Ryan Productions Blog, By Ryan Mifflin - February 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.welovecult.com/2011/featured/dudely-lama-dudeism-interview/ The Dudely Lama Discusses Dudeism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110155253/http://www.welovecult.com/2011/featured/dudely-lama-dudeism-interview/ |date=November 10, 2013 }} - We Love Cult, retrieved September 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cathleen Falsani Interview|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/episodes/october-9-2009/cathleen-falsani-interview/4520/|work=[[Religion and Ethics Newsweekly]]|publisher=[[PBS]]|accessdate=September 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the historian of the [[anarchist]] movement Ronald Creagh, the hippie movement could be considered as the last spectacular resurgence of [[utopian socialism]].&lt;ref name="wikiwix.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://endehors.net/news/communes-communautes-milieux-libres%26title%3Dpr%C3%A9sentation%20en%20ligne |title=Ronald Creagh.

The [[Peace symbols|peace symbol]] was developed in the UK as a logo for the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and was embraced by U.S. anti-war protesters during the 1960s.
Hippies were often [[pacifism|pacifists]], and participated in non-violent political demonstrations, such as [[Civil Rights Movement]], the [[protest|marches on Washington D.C.]], and [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti–Vietnam War]] demonstrations, including [[draft-card burning]]s and the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|1968 Democratic National Convention protests]].&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics/elections/1968-democratic-convention-EVHST000046.topic|title=1968 Democratic Convention|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of political involvement varied widely among hippies, from those who were active in peace demonstrations, to the more anti-authority street theater and demonstrations of the [[Youth International Party|Yippies]], the most politically active hippie sub-group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Shannon |first=Phil |date=June 18, 1997 |title=Yippies, politics and the state |series=Cultural Dissent, Issue # |publisher=''[[Green Left Weekly]]'' |issue=278 |url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/1997/278/16698 |accessdate=2008-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126015333/http://www.greenleft.org.au/1997/278/16698 |archivedate=January 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bobby Seale]] discussed the differences between Yippies and hippies with [[Jerry Rubin]], who told him that Yippies were the political wing of the hippie movement, as hippies have not "necessarily become political yet". Regarding the political activity of hippies, Rubin said, "They mostly prefer to be stoned, but most of them want peace, and they want an end to this stuff."&lt;ref name="Seale_1991_350"&gt;{{harvnb|Seale|1991|p=350}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to non-violent political demonstrations, hippie opposition to the Vietnam War included organizing political action groups to oppose the war, refusal to serve in the military and conducting "[[teach-in]]s" on college campuses that covered Vietnamese history and the larger political context of the war.&lt;ref name="Junker"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Junker|first1=Detlef |last2=Gassert |first2=Philipp|title=The United States and Germany in the Era of the Cold War, 1945-1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|page=424|isbn=0-521-83420-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott McKenzie's 1967 rendition of John Phillips' song "[[San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)]]", which helped to inspire the hippie Summer of Love, became a homecoming song for all Vietnam veterans arriving in San Francisco from 1967 onward. McKenzie has dedicated every American performance of "San Francisco" to Vietnam veterans, and he sang in 2002 at the 20th anniversary of the dedication of the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]]. Hippie political expression often took the form of "dropping out" of society to implement the changes they sought.

Politically motivated movements aided by hippies include the [[back to the land movement]] of the 1960s, [[cooperative|cooperative business enterprises]], [[alternative energy]], the [[Freedom of the press|free press]] movement, and [[organic farming]].&lt;ref name="Morford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner_2006_3239"&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2006|pp=32–39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The San Francisco group known as [[Diggers (theater)|the Diggers]] articulated an influential radical criticism of contemporary mass consumer society, and so they opened [[free stores]] which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art.&lt;ref name="Lytle_2006_213215"/&gt; The Diggers took their name from the original [[Diggers|English Diggers]] (1649–50) led by [[Gerrard Winstanley]],&lt;ref name="Digger Archives"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diggers.org/overview.htm |title= Overview: who were (are) the Diggers? |accessdate=2007-06-17 | work=The Digger Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they sought to create a mini-society [[Criticism of capitalism|free of money and capitalism]].&lt;ref name="American Experience doc"&gt;{{cite video

&lt;/ref&gt;

Such activism was ideally carried through [[anti-authoritarian]] and [[non-violent]] means; thus it was observed that "The way of the hippie is antithetical to all repressive hierarchical power structures since they are adverse to the hippie goals of peace, love and freedom... Hippies don't impose their beliefs on others. Instead, hippies seek to change the world through reason and by living what they believe."&lt;ref name="Stonepolitics"&gt;{{harvnb|Stone|1999|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm "The Way of the Hippy"]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political ideals of hippies influenced other movements, such as [[anarcho-punk]], [[rave culture]], [[green politics]], [[stoner culture]] and the [[New Age]] movement. [[Penny Rimbaud]] of the English anarcho-punk band [[Crass]] said in interviews, and in an essay called ''The Last Of The Hippies'', that Crass was formed in memory of his friend, [[Wally Hope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Last Of The Hippies - An Hysterical Romance |last=Rimbaud |first=Penny |authorlink=Penny Rimbaud |year=1982 |publisher=Crass. |url=http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/britain/sp001297.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crass had its roots in [[Dial House, Essex|Dial House]], which was established in 1967 as a commune.&lt;ref&gt;''Shibboleth: My Revolting Life'', Rimbaud, Penny, AK Press, 1999. {{ISBN|978-1873176405}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[punk subculture|punks]] were often critical of Crass for their involvement in the hippie movement. Like Crass, [[Jello Biafra]] was influenced by the hippie movement, and cited the yippies as a key influence on his political activism and thinking, though he also wrote songs critical of hippies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.progressive.org/mag_intvbiafra | title=Jello Biafra Interview | publisher=The Progressive | work=The Progressive | accessdate=February 1, 2002 | last=Vander Molen | first=Jodi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.al.com/mcolurso/2007/06/jello_biafra_can_ruffle_feathe.html | title=Jello Biafra can ruffle feathers | publisher=The Birmingham News | work=The Birmingham News | accessdate=June 29, 2007 | last=Colurso | first=Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drugs===
{{Cannabis sidebar}}
{{see also|Spiritual use of cannabis|History of LSD}}
Following in the footsteps of the Beats, many hippies used [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] (marijuana), considering it pleasurable and benign. They enlarged their spiritual pharmacopeia to include [[hallucinogen]]s such as [[peyote]], [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], [[psilocybin mushrooms]] and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], while often renouncing the use of alcohol. On the [[East Coast of the United States]], [[Harvard University]] professors [[Timothy Leary]], [[Ralph Metzner]] and [[Ram Dass|Richard Alpert]] (Ram Dass) advocated psychotropic drugs for [[psychotherapy]], self-exploration, [[Religion and drugs|religious]] and [[Entheogen|spiritual]] use. Regarding LSD, Leary said, "Expand your consciousness and find ecstasy and revelation within."&lt;ref name="Time-Life Books_1998_139"&gt;{{harvnb|Stolley|1998|pp=139}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[West Coast of the United States]], [[Ken Kesey]] was an important figure in promoting the recreational use of psychotropic drugs, especially LSD, also known as "acid." By holding what he called "[[Acid Tests]]", and touring the country with his band of [[Merry Pranksters]], Kesey became a magnet for media attention that drew many young people to the fledgling movement. The [[Grateful Dead]] (originally billed as "The Warlocks") played some of their first shows at the Acid Tests, often as high on LSD as their audiences. Kesey and the Pranksters had a "vision of turning on the world."&lt;ref name="Time-Life Books_1998_139" /&gt; Harder drugs, such as [[cocaine]], [[amphetamines]] and heroin, were also sometimes used in hippie settings; however, these drugs were often disdained, even among those who used them, because they were recognized as harmful and addictive.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{harvnb|Yablonsky|1968|pp=243, 257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stereotypical belief that in the 1960s, the hippies' heyday, drugs were running rampant and little was done to enforce drug laws, is not supported by the facts; by 1969 only 4% of Americans had tried marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/6331/decades-drug-use-data-from-60s-70s.aspx|title=Decades of Drug Use: Data From the '60s and '70s|first=Gallup,|last=Inc.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facts on File. {{ISBN|0-8160-2469-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s and 1970s, mustaches, beards and long hair became more commonplace and colorful, while multi-ethnic clothing dominated the fashion world. Since that time, a wide range of personal appearance options and clothing styles, including nudity, have become more widely acceptable, all of which was uncommon before the hippie era.&lt;ref name="Connikie"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Pendergast, Sara.

Thomson Gale. {{ISBN|0-7876-5417-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hippies also inspired the decline in popularity of the [[necktie]] and other ''business'' clothing, which had been unavoidable for men during the 1950s and early 1960s. Additionally, hippie fashion itself has been commonplace in the years since the 1960s in clothing and accessories, particularly the [[peace symbol]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/life/article/Peace-sign-makes-a-statement-in-the-fashion-world-1773516.php Sewing, Joy; [[Houston Chronicle]; publ.

As such in [[New York City]] musicians and audiences from the female, homosexual, black, and Latino communities adopted several traits from the hippies and [[psychedelia]]. They included overwhelming sound, free-form dancing, weird lighting, colorful costumes, and [[hallucinogens]].&lt;ref name="Partylikeits1975"&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2001-07-10/news/disco-double-take/2 Disco Double Take: New York Parties Like It's 1975].

The hippie legacy in literature includes the lasting popularity of books reflecting the hippie experience, such as ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In music, the [[folk rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]] popular among hippies evolved into genres such as [[acid rock]], [[World music|world beat]] and [[heavy metal music]]. [[Psychedelic trance]] (also known as psytrance) is a type of [[electronic music]] influenced by 1960s psychedelic rock. The tradition of hippie music festivals began in the United States in 1965 with Ken Kesey's [[Acid Tests]], where the [[Grateful Dead]] played tripping on [[LSD]] and initiated psychedelic jamming. For the next several decades, many hippies and neo-hippies became part of the [[Deadhead]] community, attending music and art festivals held around the country. The [[Grateful Dead]] toured continuously, with few interruptions between 1965 and 1995. [[Phish]] and their fans (called ''Phish Heads'') operated in the same manner, with the band touring continuously between 1983 and 2004. Many contemporary bands performing at hippie festivals and their derivatives are called [[jam band]]s, since they play songs that contain long instrumentals similar to the original hippie bands of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070124191643/http://www.jambands.com/jamband.html JamBands.com] - What is a Jam Band? Retrieved from Internet Archive December 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the demise of Grateful Dead and Phish, nomadic touring hippies attend a growing series of summer festivals, the largest of which is called the [[Bonnaroo Music Festival|Bonnaroo Music &amp; Arts Festival]], which premiered in 2002. The [[Oregon Country Fair]] is a three-day festival featuring handmade crafts, educational displays and costumed entertainment. The annual [[Starwood Festival]], founded in 1981, is a seven-day event indicative of the spiritual quest of hippies through an exploration of non-mainstream religions and world-views, and has offered performances and classes by a variety of hippie and counter-culture icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VP5UmbX3ECwC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=starwood+festival+1981&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BBCWAoNeRx&amp;sig=4i-V7hV1unsMasvpLwgWwJlrEZA&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=starwood%20festival%201981&amp;f=false|title=Her Hidden Children: The Rise of Wicca and Paganism in America|last=Clifton|first=Chas|date=2006|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=9780759102026|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Burning Man]] festival began in 1986 at a San Francisco beach party and is now held in the [[Black Rock Desert]] northeast of [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], Nevada. Although few participants would accept the ''hippie'' label, Burning Man is a contemporary expression of alternative community in the same spirit as early hippie events. The gathering becomes a temporary city (36,500 occupants in 2005, 50,000+ in 2011), with elaborate encampments, displays, and many [[art cars]]. Other events that enjoy a large attendance include the [[Rainbow Family Gatherings]], The [[Gathering of the Vibes]], Community Peace Festivals, and the [[Woodstock Festival]]s.

In the UK, there are many [[new age travellers]] who are known as hippies to outsiders, but prefer to call themselves the [[Peace Convoy]]. They started the [[Stonehenge Free Festival]] in 1974, but [[English Heritage]] later banned the festival in 1985, resulting in the [[Battle of the Beanfield]]. With Stonehenge banned as a festival site, new age travellers gather at the annual [[Glastonbury Festival]]. Today, hippies in the UK can be found in parts of [[South West England]], such as [[Bristol]] (particularly the neighborhoods of [[Montpelier, Bristol|Montpelier]], [[Stokes Croft]], [[St Werburghs]], [[Bishopston, Bristol|Bishopston]], [[Easton, Bristol|Easton]] and [[Totterdown]]), [[Glastonbury]] in [[Somerset]], [[Totnes]] in [[Devon]], and [[Stroud]] in [[Gloucestershire]], as well as in [[Hebden Bridge]] in [[West Yorkshire]], and in areas of [[London]] and [[Brighton]]. In the summer, many hippies and those of similar subcultures gather at numerous outdoor festivals in the countryside.

In New Zealand between 1976 and 1981 tens of thousands of hippies gathered from around the world on large farms around [[Waihi]] and [[Waikino]] for music and alternatives festivals. Named ''[[Nambassa]]'', the festivals focused on peace, love, and a balanced lifestyle. The events featured practical [[workshops]] and displays advocating [[alternative lifestyles]], [[self sufficiency]], clean and [[sustainable energy]] and [[sustainable living]].&lt;ref&gt;Nambassa: A New Direction, edited by Colin Broadley and Judith Jones, A. H. &amp; A. W. Reed, 1979. {{ISBN|0-589-01216-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK and Europe, the years 1987 to 1989 were marked by a large-scale revival of many characteristics of the hippie movement. This later movement, composed mostly of people aged 18 to 25, adopted much of the original hippie philosophy of love, peace and freedom. The summer of 1988 became known as the [[Second Summer of Love]]. Although the music favored by this movement was modern [[electronic music]], especially [[house music]] and [[acid house]], one could often hear songs from the original hippie era in the ''chill out rooms'' at [[rave]]s. Also, there was a trend towards psychedelic indie rock in the form of [[Shoegaze]], [[Dream Pop]], [[Madchester]] and [[Neo-Psychedelic]] bands like [[Jesus And Mary Chain]], [[The Sundays]], [[Spacemen 3]], [[Loop (band)|Loop]], [[Stone Roses]], [[Happy Mondays]], [[Inspiral Carpets]] and [[Ride (band)|Ride]]. This was effectively a parallel soundtrack to the rave scene that was rooted as much in 1960s psychedelic rock as it was in [[post-punk]], though [[Madchester]] was more directly influenced by Acid House, funk and northern soul. Interestingly, many ravers were originally [[soul boys]] and [[football casuals]], and [[football hooliganism]] declined after the Second Summer of Love.

In the UK, many of the well-known figures of this movement first lived communally in [[Stroud Green, London|Stroud Green]], an area of north London located in [[Finsbury Park]]. In 1995, [[The Sekhmet Hypothesis]] attempted to link both hippie and rave culture together in relation to transactional analysis, suggesting that rave culture was a social archetype based on the mood of friendly strength, compared to the gentle hippie archetype, based on friendly weakness.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sekhmet Hypothesis'', Iain Spence, 1995, Bast's Blend. {{ISBN|0952536501}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later electronic dance genres known as [[goa trance]] and [[psychedelic trance]] and its related events and culture have important hippie legacies and neo hippie elements. The popular DJ of the genre [[Goa Gil]], like other hippies from the 1960s, decided to leave the US and Western Europe to travel on the [[hippie trail]] and later developing psychedelic parties and music in the Indian island of [[Goa]] in which the goa and psytrance genres were born and exported around the world in the 1990s and 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;"In 1969, Gilbert Levy left the Haigh Ashbury district of San Francisco and took the overland trail through Afghanistan and Pakistan, first to Bombay and then to Goa...Throughout the 1970s, Gil organized legendary parties at Anjuna- moonlight jams of non-stop music, dancing and chemical experimentation that lasted from Christmas Eve to New Year´s Day for a tribe of fellow overland travellers who called themselves the Goa Freaks...In the 90s, Gil started to use snippets from industrial music, etno techno, acid house and psychedelic rock to help create Goa Trance, dance music with a heavy spiritual accent...For Goa Gil, Goa Trance is a logical continuation of what hippies were doing back in the 60s and 70s. "The Psychedelic Revolution never really stopped" he said, " it just had to go halfway round the world to the end of a dirt road on a deserted beach, and there it was allowed to evolve and mutate, without government or media pressures". ''Time Out: Mumbai and Goa''. Time Out Guides Ltd. London. 2011 pg. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, photojournalist John Bassett McCleary published a 650-page, 6,000-entry unabridged [[slang dictionary]] devoted to the language of the hippies titled ''The Hippie Dictionary: A Cultural Encyclopedia of the 1960s and 1970s''. The book was revised and expanded to 700 pages in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;McCleary, John Bassett.

Chia Hong worked for Facebook over three years as a product manager and technology partner in finance. She was fired in October 2013. On March 16, 2015, she filed a suit against the company, alleging [[sexual discrimination]], [[sexual harassment]], [[race discrimination]] and  [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]] among other charges. She claimed Facebook was a "[[hostile work environment]]," and that she was belittled, and ordered to organize social functions and serve drinks to male [[colleague]]s. She also claimed to have been asked why she didn't take care of her child. Hong, a [[Taiwan]]ese American, alleged that she was excluded by coworkers because she was the only team member of Chinese descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pao Attys Launch Latest Gender Bias Salvo Against Facebook| publisher= Law360 | url = http://www.law360.com/articles/632837/pao-attys-launch-latest-gender-bias-salvo-against-facebook | accessdate = 2015-04-01

&lt;/ref&gt; A Facebook spokesperson released a statement in response to the filing: "We work extremely hard on issues related to diversity, gender and equality, and we believe we've made progress. (...) In this case we have substantive disagreements on the facts, and we believe the record shows the employee was treated fairly." &lt;ref name="lien" /&gt;

The parties stipulated to voluntary mediation before a court-related mediator.  The mediation session was scheduled for August 31, 2015.

== US State Department Annual Human Trafficking Report 2015 ==
The [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000|US Trafficking Victims Protection Act]] (TVPA), as amended, requires the US Secretary of State to submit an Annual Report to the [[US Congress]] assessing the actions of various countries across the world in the fight against trafficking in persons.

The US State Department on Thursday released a report showing a 73 per cent increase in the number of detected cases of human trafficking in Ireland since 2014
Ireland still retains Tier 1 Status in US State Department Annual Human Trafficking Report as of 2015. Ireland having a Tier 1 status means they meet the minimum standard for the elimination of severe forms of trafficking.

As the Republic of Ireland has been assessed by the State Department as meeting the minimum standard for the elimination of severe forms of trafficking as set out in the US Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), (as amended) it has retained its top Tier 1 rating in 2015. Ireland has been classified as Tier 1 for the past six years.

As is the norm for all countries, including Tier 1 countries, the Report on Ireland contains a number of recommendations to be implemented going forward. These recommendations are addressed within the context of the development of the Second National Action Plan to Prevent and Tackle Human Trafficking across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueblindfold.gov.ie/website/bbf/bbfweb.nsf/page/irelandsresponse-overview-en|title=National Action Plan|publisher=Blue Blindfold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3653">Bolivia comparatively has experienced far less immigration than its [[South America]]n neighbors. Nevertheless, small groups of [[German people|Germans]], [[Spanish people|Spaniards]], [[Italian people|Italians]], a small [[Yugoslavia]]n community, and others live in the country. The [[Basque people|Basques]] were a large source of Spanish and European immigration from the late 16th to early 20th centuries, most came as shepherds and ranchers to Bolivia's vast livestock industry.    

Similar to other Latin American nations, Bolivia has experienced a small [[Japanese people|Japanese]] migration. Beginning in 1899 a small migration of Japanese began that continued until the 1970s. Small Japanese communities were formed in the Bolivian department of [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]]. Other east Asians ([[Taiwan]]ese and [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and [[Middle Eastern]]ers ([[Lebanon|Lebanese]] and [[Syria]]ns) developed their own communities in Bolivia in the late 20th century. During the 20th century Bolivia received a small number of [[Jews]], mainly [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]].

==Country of birth of Bolivian residents==
According to the 2001 Census 87,338 of the Bolivian resident population were born outside Bolivia, representing 1.06% of the total Bolivian resident population.

{{Indo-European topics}}
The '''Indo-Aryan''' or '''Indic languages''' is the dominant language family of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. They constitute a branch of the [[Indo-Iranian languages]], itself a branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] family. In the early 21st century, Indo-Aryan languages were spoken by more than 800 million people, primarily in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web|title= Overview of Indo-Aryan languages |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Indo-Aryan-languages|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2017}}

===Proto-Indo-Aryan===
{{main article|Proto-Indo-Aryan language}}
Proto-Indo-Aryan, or sometimes Proto-Indic, is the [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] [[proto-language]] of the Indo-Aryan languages. It is intended to reconstruct the language of the [[Indo-Aryan peoples#Pre-Vedic Indo-Aryans|pre-Vedic Indo-Aryans]]. Proto-Indo-Aryan is meant to be the predecessor of [[Indo-Aryan languages#Old Indo-Aryan|Old Indo-Aryan]] (1500–300 BCE) which is directly attested as [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] and [[Mitanni-Aryan]]. Despite the great archaicity of Vedic, however, the other Indo-Aryan languages preserve a small number of [[Proto-Indo-Aryan language#Differences from Vedic|archaic features lost in Vedic]].

====Old Indo-Aryan====
The earliest evidence of the group is from [[Mitanni-Aryan|Mitanni Indo-Aryan]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Roots of Hinduism: The Early Aryans and The Indus Civilization|last=Parpola|first=Asko|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only evidence of it is a few proper names and specialized loanwords.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

[[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] Indo-Aryan has been used in the ancient preserved religious hymns of the Rigveda, the earliest [[Vedas|Vedic literature]].

From the Rigvedic language, "Sanskrit" (literally "put together", meaning perfected or elaborated) developed as the prestige language of culture, science and religion, as well as the court, theatre, etc.  Sanskrit is, by convention, referred to by modern scholars as 'Classical Sanskrit' in contradistinction to the so-called 'Rigvedic Sanskrit', which is largely intelligible to Sanskrit speakers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

====Middle Indo-Aryan (Prakrits)====
Outside the learned sphere of Sanskrit, vernacular dialects ([[Prakrit]]s) continued to evolve. The oldest attested Prakrits are the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] canonical languages [[Pali]] and [[Ardhamagadhi Prakrit]], respectively. By medieval times, the Prakrits had diversified into various [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages]]. ''[[Apabhraṃśa]]'' is the conventional cover term for transitional dialects connecting late Middle Indo-Aryan with early Modern Indo-Aryan, spanning roughly the 6th to 13th centuries. Some of these dialects showed considerable literary production; the ''Śravakacāra'' of Devasena (dated to the 930s) is now considered to be the first Hindi book.

The next major milestone occurred with the [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent]] in the 13th–16th centuries. Under the flourishing [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turco-Mongol]] [[Mughal Empire]], [[Persian language|Persian]] became very influential as the language of prestige of the Islamic courts due to adoptation of the foreign language by the Mughal emperors. However, Persian was soon displaced by Hindustani. This Indo-Aryan language is a combination with Persian, Arabic, and Turkic elements in its vocabulary, with the grammar of the local dialects.

The two largest languages that formed from Apabhraṃśa were [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]; others include [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]].

====New Indo-Aryan====

=====Dialect continuum=====
The Indo-Aryan languages of [[North India]] and [[Pakistan]] form a [[dialect continuum]]. What is called "[[Hindi]]" in India is frequently [[Standard Hindi]], the [[Sanskrit|Sanskritized]] version of the colloquial [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] spoken in the [[Delhi]] area since the Mughals. However, the term Hindi is also used for most of the central Indic dialects from [[Bihar]] to [[Rajasthan]]. The spoken New Indo-Aryan dialects from Assam in the east to the borders of Afghanistan in the west form a linguistic continuum across the plains of North India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

=====Medieval Hindustani=====
{{Main article|Hindustani language|History of Hindustani}}
In the [[Central Zone (Hindi)|Central Zone Hindi]]-speaking areas, for a long time the [[prestige dialect]] was [[Braj Bhasha]], but this was replaced in the 19th century by the [[Khariboli dialect|Khariboli]]-based [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]. Hindustani was strongly influenced by [[Sanskrit]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], with these influences leading to the emergence of Modern Standard Hindi and Modern Standard [[Urdu]] as [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]]s of the Hindustani language.&lt;ref name="KulshreshthaMathur2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kulshreshtha|first1=Manisha|last2=Mathur|first2=Ramkumar|title=Dialect Accent Features for Establishing Speaker Identity: A Case Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xHmARyhRoNYC&amp;pg=PA16|date=24 March 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-1137-6|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nunley1999"&gt;{{Citation | title=The Cultural Landscape an Introduction to Human Geography |author1=Robert E.

Despite the different script the fundamental grammar remains identical, the difference is more [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] than purely linguistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://india_resource.tripod.com/Urdu.html| title = Urdu and its Contribution to Secular Values| publisher = South Asian Voice| accessdate = 26 February 2008| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071111145027/http://india_resource.tripod.com/Urdu.html| archivedate = 11 November 2007| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mesa.ucdavis.edu/academics/languages-1/hindu-urdu|title = Hindi/Urdu Language Instruction|publisher = University of California, Davis|accessdate = 3 Jan 2015|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150103095430/http://mesa.ucdavis.edu/academics/languages-1/hindu-urdu|archivedate = 3 January 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethnologue Report for Hindi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.org/show_language.asp?code=hin| title = Ethnologue Report for Hindi | publisher = Ethnologue | accessdate = 26 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is widely understood/spoken as a second or third language throughout South Asia&lt;ref&gt;Otto Zwartjes ''Portuguese Missionary Grammars in Asia, Africa and Brazil, 1550-1800'' Publisher John Benjamins Publishing, 2011 {{ISBN|9027283257}}, 9789027283252&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the most widely known languages in the world in terms of number of speakers.

===Mitanni-Aryan===
{{main article|Mitanni-Aryan}}

Some theonyms, proper names and other terminology of the Mitanni exhibit an Indo-Aryan superstrate, suggest that a Indo-Aryan elite imposed itself over the [[Hurrians]] in the course of the [[Indo-Aryan migration|Indo-Aryan expansion]]. In a treaty between the [[Hittites]] and the Mitanni, the deities [[Mitra]], [[Varuna]], [[Indra]], and the [[Ashvins]] ([[Nasatya]]) are invoked. [[Kikkuli]]'s horse training text includes technical terms such as ''aika'' (''eka'', one), ''tera'' (''tri'', three), ''panza'' (''pancha'', five), ''satta'' (''sapta'', seven), ''na'' (''nava'', nine), ''vartana'' (''vartana'', turn, round in the horse race). The numeral aika "one" is of particular importance because it places the superstrate in the vicinity of Indo-Aryan proper as opposed to Indo-Iranian or early Iranian (which has "aiva") in general&lt;ref&gt;Paul Thieme, The 'Aryan' Gods of the Mitanni Treaties. JAOS 80, 1960, 301–17&lt;/ref&gt;

Another text has ''babru'' (''babhru'', brown), ''parita'' (''palita'', grey), and ''pinkara'' (''pingala'', red). Their chief festival was the celebration of the [[solstice]] (''vishuva'') which was common in most cultures in the ancient world. The Mitanni warriors were called ''marya'', the term for warrior in [[Sanskrit]] as well; note mišta-nnu (= miẓḍha, ≈ Sanskrit mīḍha) "payment (for catching a fugitive)" (M. Mayrhofer, ''Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Altindoarischen'', Heidelberg, 1986–2000; Vol. II:358).

Sanskritic interpretations of Mitanni royal names render [[Artashumara]] (''artaššumara'') as ''Ṛtasmara'' "who thinks of [[Ṛta]]" (Mayrhofer II 780), Biridashva (biridašṷa, biriiašṷa) as ''Prītāśva'' "Whose Horse is Dear" (Mayrhofer II 182), Priyamazda (priiamazda) as ''Priyamedha'' "whose wisdom is dear" (Mayrhofer II 189, II378), Citrarata as ''Citraratha'' "Whose Chariot is Shining" (Mayrhofer I 553), Indaruda/Endaruta as ''Indrota'' "helped by [[Indra]]" (Mayrhofer I 134), Shativaza (šattiṷaza) as ''Sātivāja'' "Winning the Race Price" (Mayrhofer II 540, 696), Šubandhu as ''Subandhu'' "Having Good Relatives" (a name in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], Mayrhofer II 209, 735), Tushratta (tṷišeratta, tušratta, etc.) as *tṷaiašaratha, Vedic [[Tvastar]] "Whose Chariot is Vehement" (Mayrhofer, Etym. Wb., I 686, I 736).

===Romani, Lomavren, and Domari languages===

====Domari====
{{main article|Domari language}}

[[Domari language|Domari]] is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by older [[Dom people]] scattered across the [[MENA]]. The language is reported to be spoken as far north as [[Azerbaijan]] and as far south as central Sudan, in Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Iraq, Palestine, Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Sudan, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Syria and Lebanon.&lt;ref name=Matras&gt;Matras (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the systematicity of sound changes, we know with a fair degree of certainty that the names ''Domari'' and ''[[Romani people|Romani]]'' derive from the Indo-Aryan word ''ḍom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://romani.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/whatis/language/origins.shtml|title=History of the Romani language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lomavren====
{{main article|Lomavren language}}

[[Lomavren]] is a nearly extinct [[mixed language]], spoken by the [[Lom people]], that arose from [[language contact]] between a language related to [[Romani language|Romani]] and [[Domari language|Domari]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iranica.com/articles/gypsy-ii |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402100935/https://www.iranica.com/articles/gypsy-ii |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }} Encyclopedia Iranica&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Armenian language]].

====Romani====
{{main article|Romani language}}

The Romani language is usually included in the Western Indo-Aryan languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Romani (subgroup)
  | publisher = [[SIL International]]
  | date = n.d.
  | url = http://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/romani
  | accessdate = September 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romani — spoken mainly in various parts of Europe — is conservative in maintaining almost intact the Middle Indo-Aryan present-tense person concord markers, and in maintaining consonantal endings for nominal case – both features that have been eroded in most other modern languages of Central India. It shares an innovative pattern of past-tense person concord with the languages of the Northwest, such as Kashmiri and Shina. This is believed to be further proof that Romani originated in the Central region, then migrated to the Northwest.

There are no known historical documents about the early phases of the Romani language.

Linguistic evaluation carried out in the nineteenth century by Pott (1845) and Miklosich (1882–1888) showed that the Romani language is to be classed as a New Indo-Aryan language (NIA), not Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA), establishing that the ancestors of the Romani could not have left India significantly earlier than AD 1000.

The principal argument favouring a migration during or after the transition period to NIA is the loss of the old system of nominal case, and its reduction to just a two-way case system, nominative vs. oblique. A secondary argument concerns the system of gender differentiation. Romani has only two genders  (masculine and feminine). Middle Indo-Aryan languages (named MIA) generally had three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter), and some modern Indo-Aryan languages retain this old system even today.

It is argued that loss of the neuter gender did not occur until the transition to NIA. Most of the neuter nouns became masculine while a few feminine, like the neuter अग्नि (agni) in the Prakrit became the feminine आग (āg) in Hindi and jag in Romani. The parallels in grammatical gender evolution between Romani and other NIA languages have been cited as evidence that the forerunner of Romani remained on the Indian subcontinent until a later period, perhaps even as late as the tenth century.

==Classification==
There can be no definitive enumeration of Indic languages because their dialects merge into one another. The major ones are illustrated here; for the details, see the dedicated articles.

The classification follows Masica (1991) and Kausen (2006).

[[Parya]] historically belonged to the Central Zone but lost intelligibility with other languages of the group due to geographic distance and numerous grammatical and lexical innovations.

===Eastern Zone===
These languages derive from Magadhan [[Apabhraṃśa|Apabhraṃśa Prakrit]].

===Southern Zone languages===
This group of languages developed from [[Maharashtri Prakrit]].
It is not clear if [[Dakhini]] (Deccani, Southern Urdu) is part of Hindustani along with Standard Urdu, or a separate Persian-influenced development from Marathi.

====Insular Indic====
:* [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese (සිංහල)]] - 17 million
:* [[Maldivian language|Maldivian]] - 340,000 speakers

::* Mahl - 10,000 speakers
The Insular Indic languages share several characteristics that set them apart significantly from the continental languages.

===Unclassified===
The following languages are related to each other, but otherwise unclassified within Indo-Aryan:

'''Kuswaric'''&lt;ref&gt;{{glottolog|kusw1234|Kuswaric}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[Danwar language|Danwar]] - 46,000 speakers
:* [[Bote-Darai language|Bote-Darai]] - 20,000 speakers

'''Chinali–Lahul Lohar'''&lt;ref&gt;{{glottolog|chin1491|Chinali–Lahul Lohar}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[Chinali language|Chinali]] - 750 speakers
:* [[Lahul Lohar language|Lahul Lohar]] - 750 speakers

The following other poorly attested languages are listed as unclassified within the Indo-Aryan family by ''Ethnologue'' 17:

*[[Kanjari language|Kanjari]] (Punjabi?), [[Od language|Od]] (Marathi?), [[Vaagri Booli language|Vaagri Booli]], [[Andh language|Andh]], [[Kumhali language|Kumhali]] (perhaps in Central).

Also [[Degaru language|Degaru]], Mina, Bhalay and Gowlan are all names for the Gowli caste, rather than a language.

'''Kholosi''' 
:The [[Kholosi language]] is a more recently discovered Indo-Aryan language spoken in two villages in southern Iran and remains currently unclassified.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===

====Stop positions&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|pp=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;====
The normative system of New Indo-Aryan stops consists of five [[points of articulation]]: [[Labial consonant|labial]], [[Dental consonant|dental]], "[[Retroflex consonant|retroflex]]", [[palatal consonant|palatal]], and [[velar consonant|velar]], which is the same as that of Sanskrit. The "retroflex" position may involve retroflexion, or curling the tongue to make the contact with the underside of the tip, or merely retraction. The point of contact may be [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] or [[postalveolar]], and the distinctive quality may arise more from the shaping than from the position of the tongue. Palatals stops have [[affricate consonant|affricate]]d release and are traditionally included as involving a distinctive tongue position (blade in contact with hard palate). Widely transcribed as {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=94}} claims {{IPA|[cʃ]}} to be a more accurate rendering.

Moving away from the normative system, some languages and dialects have alveolar affricates {{IPA|[ts]}} instead of palatal, though some among them retain {{IPA|[tʃ]}} in certain positions: before [[front vowel]]s (esp. {{IPA|/i/}}), before {{IPA|/j/}}, or when [[geminate]]d. Alveolar as an ''additional'' point of articulation occurs in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Konkani people|Konkani]] where dialect mixture and others factors upset the aforementioned complementation to produce minimal environments, in some West Pahari dialects through internal developments ({{IPA|*t̪ɾ}}, {{IPA|t̪}} &gt; {{IPA|/tʃ/}}), and in [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]]. The addition of a [[Voiceless retroflex affricate|retroflex affricate]] to this in some [[Dardic languages]] maxes out the number of stop positions at seven (barring borrowed {{IPA|/q/}}), while a reduction to the inventory involves *ts &gt; {{IPA|/s/}}, which has happened in [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Chittagonian language|Chittagonian]], [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] (though there have been other sources of a secondary {{IPA|/ts/}}), and Southern Mewari.

Further reductions in the number of stop articulations are in Assamese and [[Romany language|Romany]], which have lost the characteristic dental/retroflex contrast, and in Chittagonian, which may lose its labial and velar articulations through [[spirantization]] in many positions (&gt; {{IPA|[f, x]}}).

====Nasals&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;====
Sanskrit was noted as having five [[nasal stop|nasal-stop]] articulations corresponding to its oral stops, and among modern languages and dialects Dogri, Kacchi, Kalasha, Rudhari, Shina, Saurasthtri, and Sindhi have been analyzed as having this full complement of phonemic nasals {{IPAslink|m}} {{IPAslink|n}} {{IPAslink|ɳ}} {{IPAslink|ɲ}} {{IPAslink|ŋ}}, with the last two generally as the result of the loss of the stop from a [[homorganic]] nasal + stop cluster ({{IPA|[ɲj]}} &gt; {{IPA|[ɲ]}} and {{IPA|[ŋɡ]}} &gt; {{IPA|[ŋ]}}), though there are other sources as well.

===Charts===
The following are consonant systems of major and representative New Indo-Aryan languages, as presented in {{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|pp=106–107}}, though here they are in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]. Parentheses indicate those consonants found only in loanwords: square brackets indicate those with "very low functional load". The arrangement is roughly geographical.

== Language and dialect ==
In the context of South Asia, the choice between the appellations [[Dialect#Dialect or language|"language" and "dialect"]] is a difficult one, and any distinction made using these terms is obscured by their ambiguity. In one general colloquial sense, a language is a "developed" dialect: one that is standardised, has a written tradition and enjoys [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|social prestige]]. As there are degrees of development, the boundary between a language and a dialect thus defined is not clear-cut, and there is a large middle ground where assignment is contestable.
There is a second meaning of these terms, in which the distinction is drawn on the basis of linguistic similarity. Though seemingly a "proper" linguistics sense of the terms, it is still problematic: methods that have been proposed for quantifying difference (for example, based on [[mutual intelligibility]]) have not been seriously applied in practice; and any relationship established in this framework is relative.{{sfn|Masica|1991|pp=23–27}}

'''Iranians in Germany''' include immigrants from [[Iran]] to [[Germany]] as well as their descendants of Iranian heritage or background. There are 100,000 to 120,000&lt;ref name="iranger2" /&gt; ethnic Iranians living in Germany. With around 25,000 people of Iranian descent, [[Hamburg]] is the main center of the [[Iranian diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Nieder mit dem Diktator' - 3000 Exiliraner demonstrieren in Hamburg|url = http://www.abendblatt.de/politik/ausland/article1061344/Nieder-mit-dem-Diktator-3000-Exiliraner-demonstrieren-in-Hamburg.html|website = www.abendblatt.de|access-date = 2016-01-13|language = de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiple Nationality==
As Iran almost never frees its citizens from their Iranian citizenship (see Article 989 Iran. Civil Code &lt;ref name="iranZGB"&gt;Iranian Civil Code. On [[UNHCR]]-Website: [http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,NATLEGBOD,LEGISLATION,IRN,,3ae6b5a68,0.html "The Civil Code of Iran"] published in Basic Document in Iranian Law, introduced and edited by Professor S. H. Amin. [http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,NATLEGBOD,LEGISLATION,IRN,,49997adb27,0.html "Civil Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran"] published by Alavi and Associates, Legal Counsels, Islamic Republic of Iran.&lt;/ref&gt;), which is inherited through the father (or descent), there are many German-Iranian (multiple nationality). The still existing German-Iranian agreement of 1929 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gieseking-verlag.de/downloads/V.Dt.-Iran.NLA.pdf Settlement Agreement between the German Reich and the Empire of Persia] from 1929&lt;/ref&gt; regulates in no. II of the Final Protocol that government approval is required prior to the naturalization of nationals of the other State.

==Early life and education==

He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1979 from [[Harvard College]] and a [[Juris Doctor]] degree in 1982 from the [[Georgetown University Law Center]]. From 1981 until 1982 he was a Visiting Student at the Yale Law School.&lt;ref name="fjc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/bredar-james-kelleher|title=Bredar, James Kelleher – Federal Judicial Center|website=www.fjc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bredar clerked for Judge [[Richard P. Matsch]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Colorado]]. He next served as a Deputy District Attorney in [[Moffat County, Colorado]] (1984–1985), and as an [[Assistant United States Attorney]] for the [[District of Colorado]] (1985–1989). He later served as an Assistant Federal Public Defender in the [[District of Colorado]] (1989–1991).

==Federal judicial service==
Bredar served as a [[United States Magistrate Judge]] from 1998 until 2010. On April 21, 2010, [[List of federal judges appointed by Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]] nominated Bredar to become United States District Judge for the [[United States District Court for the District of Maryland|District of Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=President Obama Names Five to the United States District Court|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-names-five-united-states-district-court|accessdate=10 April 2017|agency=[[White House Office of the Press Secretary]]|date=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His nomination was approved by the full Senate of the [[111th United States Congress]] on December 16, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillip|first1=Abby|title=Senate confirms judicial nominees|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2010/12/senate-confirms-judicial-nominees-046516|accessdate=10 April 2017|work=[[Politico]]|date=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/nomination/111th-congress/1653 Pres. Nom. 1653], 111th Cong. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; He received his commission on December 17, 2010 and was sworn in on December 22, 2010.&lt;ref name="fjc.gov"/&gt; He has served as Chief Judge since October 6, 2017.

==Notable cases==

In April 2017, Judge Bredar approved a [[consent decree]] signed by the Mayor of Baltimore; the [[Baltimore Police Department]]; and [[Vanita Gupta]], former acting Assistant Attorney General with the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division. The consent decree called for major reforms within the police department. Negotiation of the decree had followed an investigation by the Department of Justice of the police department, as requested by the city in 2015. Judge Bredar denied a request by then-recently appointed Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] to postpone signing for thirty days in order to give the new administration time to review the decree; Judge Bredar said the Court was satisfied with the decree and that it was time to get the changes underway.&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-consent-decree-approved-20170407-story.html Kevin Rector, "Federal judge approves Baltimore policing consent decree, denying Justice Department request for delay"], ''Baltimore Sun'', 07 April 2017; accessed 22 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Victor|first1=Daniel|title=Judge Approves Consent Decree to Overhaul Baltimore Police Dept.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/us/baltimore-justice-department-police-consent-decree.html|accessdate=10 April 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=8 April 2017|page=A18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, Judge Bredar is one of three judges assigned to a case captioned ''Benisek v. Lamone'', No. 1:13-cv-03233-JKB (D. Md.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/benisek-v-lamone/|title=Benisek v. Lamone - SCOTUSblog|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case challenges Maryland's 2011 congressional redistricting map, and specifically [[Maryland's 6th congressional district]], as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. The ''Benisek'' case has a fascinating procedural history in that the [[United States Supreme Court]] has twice heard argument on aspects of the case. The Supreme Court first considered the case in [[Shapiro v. McManus]], a 2015 decision overruling a precedent of the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] that had addressed those circumstances in which a single district judge can dismiss a case that otherwise falls within the ambit of 28 U.S.C. § 2284 (the three-judge court statute). Following the ''Shapiro'' decision, the case was remanded, and Judge Bredar—along with Circuit Judge [[Paul V. Niemeyer]] and District Judge [[George Levi Russell III]]--presided over the further litigation. Judge Bredar dissented primarily on jurisdictional grounds from an August 2016 decision by the three-judge court denying the State's motion to dismiss,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://casetext.com/case/shapiro-v-mcmanus-2|title=Shapiro v. McManus, 203 F. Supp. 3d 579 - Casetext|website=casetext.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he commanded a 2–1 majority denying plaintiffs' subsequent motion for a preliminary injunction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.mdd.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Opinions/133233%20Benisek%20Opinion%20FOR%20WEBSITE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Plaintiffs sought appellate review of that decision, and the Supreme Court in 2018 affirmed the district court in [[Benisek v. Lamone]]. Following that second ruling by the Supreme Court, the case returned to the district court for proceedings on cross-motions for summary judgment. On November 7, 2018, one day after the midterm elections, the court ordered Maryland to draw up a new congressional redistricting plan for use in the 2020 congressional election, with Bredar writing, "Partisan gerrymandering is noxious, a cancer on our democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kunzelman |first1=Michael |title=Judges Order Maryland to Draw New Congressional Map for 2020 |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/maryland/articles/2018-11-07/judges-order-maryland-to-draw-new-congressional-map-for-2020 |accessdate=November 8, 2018 |work=[[US News and World Report]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kerinci''' (Karinchi or Kincai) is a [[Malayan language]] spoken in [[Jambi Province]], [[Sumatra]] especially in [[Kerinci Regency]] and [[Sungai Penuh|Sungai Penuh city]]. It has a high dialectical diversity, with dialects consists of Ulu, Mamaq, Akit, Talang and Sakei.

[[Lempur Malay]] and [[Rantau Panjang Malay]], two recently described divergent Malay varieties spoken in the western part of [[Jambi]] province, share features with both Kerinci and [[Jambi Malay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwstaff.eva.mpg.de/~gil/ismil/16/abstracts/McKinnonYantiColeHermon.pdf "Divergent Varieties of Malay in Upstream Jambi"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714121431/http://wwwstaff.eva.mpg.de/~gil/ismil/16/abstracts/McKinnonYantiColeHermon.pdf |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Reijn (1974) notes that Kerinci shares many phonological similarities with [[Austroasiatic languages]], such as [[sesquisyllabic]] word structure and vowel inventory.

Sometimes [[Durrani]] [[Pashtun tribes|tribes]] can be found among the Kochi, and occasionally there may also be some [[Baloch people]] among them that live a pastoral nomadic lifestyle.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.edu/Programs/CCS/Ethnic_identity.html|title=Program for Culture and Conflict Studies at NPS - Home|author=NPS|work=nps.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Pashto language]], the terms are '''Kochai''' (singular) and '''Kochian''' (plural). In the [[Persian language]], "Kochi" and "Kochiha" are the singular and plural forms (respectively).

==Description==
The National Multi-sectoral Assessment of Kochi in 2004, estimated that there are about 2.4 million Kochis in Afghanistan, with around 1.5 million (60%) remaining fully nomadic, and over 100,000 have been displaced due to natural disasters such as flood and drought in the past few years.&lt;ref&gt;World Food Program, Socio-economic profile, Population and Demography, Afghanistan. Retrieved at {{cite web|url=http://foodsecurityatlas.org/afg/country/socioeconomic-profile/introduction |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218195206/http://foodsecurityatlas.org/afg/country/socioeconomic-profile/introduction |archivedate=2012-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The nomads and semi-nomads, generally called ''Kuchi'' in Afghanistan, mostly keep sheep and goats. The produce of the animals (meat, dairy products, hair and wool) is exchanged or sold in order to purchase grain, vegetables, fruit and other products of settled life. In this way an extensive network of exchange has developed along the main routes annually followed by the nomads. The merchant ''Powindah'' (Ghilji) [or Ghilzai] Pashtuns used to move annually from the Afghanistan mountains to the valley of the Indus. These long-distance migrations were stopped in the early 1960s when the border with Afghanistan and Pakistan were closed, but many Kuchis are still allowed to cross as border officials recognize the Kuchi migrations which occur seasonally and allow them to pass even in times of political turmoil. In recent decades, migrations inside Afghanistan continue, although trucks are now often being used to transport livestock and family from one place to another."&lt;ref&gt;[[Willem Vogelsang]] (2002), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
{{History of Afghanistan}}
Kochis historically abstained from politics, because they are nomadic, but under Afghanistan's constitution, they were given ten seats in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Paxton, Pamela Marie and Melanie M. Hughes. "Women, politics, and power: a global perspective". Pine Forge Press, 2007, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Provisions are written into the [[Afghanistan Constitution]] (Article 14) aimed at improving the welfare of Kochis, including provisions for housing, representation, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afghan-web.com/politics/current_constitution.html|title=Afghanistan Online: The Constitution of Afghanistan|work=afghan-web.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Nations High Commission for Refugees]], before the 30 years of war, Kochis owned 30 per cent of the country's goats and sheep and most of the camels for years, and they were largely responsible for the supply of [[animal slaughter|slaughter animals]], [[wool]], [[ghee]] and [[quroot]] to the national economy.&lt;ref name = "UNHCR"&gt;UNHCR, Formation of 4 Kuchi sheep/goat breeders’ service centres, [http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/search?page=search&amp;docid=46c993942&amp;query=kuchi Durable solutions for Kuchi IDP's in the south of Afghanistan: Options and opportunities, Asia Consultants International], pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:US specialist helping Afghan nomads.jpg|left|thumb|[[United States Army|US army]] medic vaccinating Kochi children, [[Gardez]], 2003.]]
Kochis were also favored by the Kings of Afghanistan, who were themselves ethnic Pashtuns, since the late 1880s. They were awarded "firman," or royal proclamations, granting them use of summer pastures all over Afghanistan including the northern parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Lansford, Tom (2003) A Bitter Harvest: US foreign policy and Afghanistan Ashgate, Aldershot, Hants, England, {{ISBN|0-7546-3615-1}}, page 16: "The modern history of Afghanistan has witnessed a "Pashtunization" of the state as the customs, traditions and language of the Pashtuns have combined with the groups political power to erode the distinctive underpinnings of Afghanistan's other groups.FN20". FN20 cites: US, Department of the Army, Afghanistan: A Country Study, 5th ed. reprint (Washington, DC.: GPO, 1985) page 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O. Roy, Ethnic Identity and Political Expression in Northern Afghanistan, in Muslims in Central Asia: Expressions of Identity and Change, 1992, {{ISBN|0-8223-1190-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FApipiENsgwC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Tarzi+nationalism&amp;sig=ACfU3U2ExeSf4rMrbB3pQHXeI_nayeCdqg Afghanistan], by Gilles Dorronsoro&lt;/ref&gt; During the Taliban era, Kochis were a main factor and supporter of the [[Taliban]] and their leader [[Mohammed Omar]]&lt;ref name="theage.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/wandering-kuchis-pay-for-their-taliban-links/2005/08/26/1124563029556.html|title=Wandering Kuchis pay for their Taliban links|work=theage.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the northern ethnic groups ([[Hazara people|Hazara]], [[Tājik people|Tajiks]], [[Uzbeks]] and [[Turkmen people|Turkmens]]) have a long-standing distrust of the Kochi. This political dispute has been deepened over the decades of Kochi [[transhumance]], whereby some Kochis became absentee landlords in their summer areas in the north through customary seizure procedures to attach debtors' land. However, the Kochis themselves see the northern minority groups as a non-Afghan race, and claims the Kochis were natives of northern Afghan region, and that during many years of invasion such as [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Timur]], they escaped south.

The Kochis have been identified by the [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan]] as one of the largest vulnerable populations in the country. As Afghanistan's population grows, competing claims over summer pastures, both for rainfed cultivation and for grazing of the settled communities' livestock, have created conflict over land across central and northern Afghanistan. Paying head-count fees for each animal crossing someone else's property is exacting a harsh economic toll on the Kochi way of life, one that is already having to contend with recurrent droughts that are now occurring with increasing frequency.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayarticleNew.asp?section=todaysfeatures&amp;xfile=data/todaysfeatures/2008/August/todaysfeatures_August9.xml {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608192432/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayarticleNew.asp?section=todaysfeatures&amp;xfile=data%2Ftodaysfeatures%2F2008%2FAugust%2Ftodaysfeatures_August9.xml |date=2011-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wardak.net/2008/08/05/afghan-settlers-nomads-fight-over.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210063149/http://wardak.net/2008/08/05/afghan-settlers-nomads-fight-over.html |archivedate=2008-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are communities of Pashtun Kochi origin in other parts of the world as well, including in the Caribbean, Africa and Europe. In Pakistan, some Kochis are found in [[Karachi]] in [[Sindh]].

==Kochi among Taliban==
According to a classified cable sent by U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan [[Karl Eikenberry]]—revealed by [[WikiLeaks]]—Abdul Wahab Sulemankheil, Director General (DG) of the Independent Directorate of Kochis, declared that more than half of the [[Taliban]] are Kochis, a figure doubted by Eikenberry:

{{quote|The DG noted the Kuchis have always played an important role in Afghan society, both in living the traditional nomadic lifestyle of the ancient Afghans, and in their involvement in the wars and revolutions that have torn Afghanistan apart.  The Kuchis continue to play such a role now.  Opponents of the various Afghan governments have historically manipulated and played on Kuchi dissatisfaction to incite revolution and fuel opposition to foreign involvement in Afghanistan.  The DG said the Taliban have gained Kuchi support by manipulating Kuchi dissatisfaction with the government.  The DG estimated that over 1/2 of Taliban are Kuchis, who had been easily persuaded to side with the Taliban out of ignorance.  For example, in his home province of [[Paktika Province|Paktika]], the majority of Taliban commanders are Kuchis. (Comment: The Other Government Agency office estimates Kuchis comprise only a single-digit percentage of the Taliban.  The DG may be inflating the participation of the Kuchis in the Taliban movement to ensure Kuchi interests are considered in any peace-promotion efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Karl|last1=Eikenberry|authorlink=Karl Eikenberry|title=DIRECTOR OF KUCHI DIRECTORATE: FEW KUCHIS WILL VOTE, AND WILL VOTE FOR KARZAI|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09KABUL2382_a.html|accessdate=18 July 2015|publisher=[[WikiLeaks]]|date=16 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Ancient Greek religion}}

The following is a list of [[gods]], [[goddesses]] and many other divine and semi-divine figures from Ancient [[Greek mythology]] and [[Ancient Greek religion]]. (The list does not include creatures; for these, see [[List of Greek mythological creatures]].)

==Immortals==
The Greeks created images of their deities for many purposes. A temple would house the statue of a god or goddess, or multiple deities, and might be decorated with [[relief]] scenes depicting myths. Divine images were common on coins. Drinking cups and other [[ancient Greek pottery|vessels]] were painted with scenes from Greek myths.

| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:NAMA Aphrodite Syracuse.jpg|160px]]
|'''[[Aphrodite]]''' ({{lang|grc|Ἀφροδίτη}}, ''Aphroditē'')

Goddess of beauty, love, desire, and pleasure. In [[Hesiod]]'s ''Theogony'' (188–206), she was born from sea-foam and [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus']] severed genitals; in [[Homer]]'s ''Illiad'' (5.370–417), she is daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Dione (Titaness)|Dione]]. She was married to [[Hephaestus]], but bore him no children. She had many lovers, most notably [[Ares]], to whom she bore [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]], [[Phobos (mythology)|Phobos]], and [[Deimos (mythology)|Deimos]]. She was also a lover to [[Adonis]] and [[Anchises]], to whom she bore [[Aeneas]]. She is usually depicted as a naked or semi-nude beautiful woman. Her symbols include [[Myrtus communis|myrtle]], roses, and the [[scallop]] shell. Her sacred animals include doves and sparrows. Her Roman counterpart is [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=March|first1=Jennifer|title=Dictionary of classical mythology|date=2014|location=Aphrodite|isbn=9781782976356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:Apollo, lira, dan angsa.jpg|160px]]
|'''[[Apollo]]''' ({{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλων}}, ''Apóllōn'')

God of music, arts, knowledge, healing, plague, prophecy, poetry, manly beauty, and archery. He is the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and the twin brother of [[Artemis]]. Both Apollo and Artemis use a bow and arrow. Apollo is depicted as young, beardless, handsome and athletic. In myth, he can be cruel and destructive, and his love affairs are rarely happy. He is often accompanied by the Muses. His most famous temple is in [[Delphi]], where he established his oracular shrine. His signs and symbols include the [[laurel wreath]], bow and arrow, and [[lyre]]. His sacred animals include [[roe deer]], swans, and pythons. Some late Roman and Greek poetry and mythography identifies him as a sun-god, equivalent to Roman [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]] and Greek [[Helios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=March|first1=Jennifer|title=Dictionary of classical mythology|date=2014|location=Apollo|isbn=9781782976356}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:Ares Canope Villa Adriana b.jpg|160px]]
|'''[[Ares]]''' ({{lang|grc|Ἄρης}}, ''Árēs'')

God of war, bloodshed, and violence. The son of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]], he was depicted as a beardless youth, either nude with a helmet and spear or sword, or as an armed warrior. [[Homer]] portrays him as moody and unreliable, and as being the most unpopular god on earth and Olympus (''Iliad'' 5.890–1). He generally represents the chaos of war in contrast to [[Athena]], a goddess of military strategy and skill. Ares is known for cuckolding his brother [[Hephaestus]], conducting an affair with his wife [[Aphrodite]]. His sacred animals include vultures, venomous snakes, dogs, and boars. His Roman counterpart [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] by contrast was regarded as the dignified ancestor of the Roman people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=March|first1=Jennifer|title=Dictionary of classical mythology|date=2014|location=Ares|isbn=9781782976356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|'''[[Artemis]]''' ({{lang|grc|Ἄρτεμις}}, ''Ártemis'')

Virgin goddess of the hunt, wilderness, animals and young girls. In later times, Artemis became associated with bows and arrows. She is the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and twin sister of [[Apollo]]. In art she is often depicted as a young woman dressed in a short knee-length [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]] and equipped with a hunting bow and a quiver of arrows. Her attributes include hunting spears, animal pelts, [[deer]] and other wild animals. Her sacred animal is a deer. Her Roman counterpart is [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=March|first1=Jennifer|title=Dictionary of classical mythology|date=2014|location=Artemis|isbn=9781782976356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:Mattei Athena Louvre Ma530 n2.jpg|160px]]
|'''[[Athena]]''' ({{lang|grc|Ἀθηνᾶ}}, ''Athēnâ'')

Goddess of reason, wisdom, intelligence, skill, peace, warfare, battle strategy, and handicrafts. According to most traditions, she was born from Zeus's forehead, fully formed and armored. She is depicted as being crowned with a crested helm, armed with shield and spear, and wearing the [[aegis]] over a long dress. Poets describe her as "grey-eyed" or having especially bright, keen eyes. She is a special patron of [[Greek hero|heroes]] such as [[Odysseus]]. She is the patron of the city Athens (from which she takes her name) and is attributed to various inventions in arts and literature. Her symbol is the [[olive]] tree. She is commonly shown as being accompanied by her sacred animal, the owl. Her Roman counterpart is [[Minerva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=March|first1=Jennifer|title=Dictionary of classical mythology|date=2014|location=Athena|isbn=9781782976356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:Demeter Altemps Inv8546.jpg|160px]]
|'''[[Demeter]]''' ({{lang|grc|Δημήτηρ}}, ''Dēmētēr'')

Goddess of grain, agriculture, harvest, growth, and nourishment. Demeter, whose Roman counterpart is [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], is a daughter of [[Cronus]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], and was swallowed and then regurgitated by her father. She is a sister of [[Zeus]], by whom she bore [[Persephone]], who is also known as Kore, i.e. "the girl." One of the central myths associated with Demeter involves [[Hades]]' abduction of Persephone and Demeter's lengthy search for her. Demeter is one of the main deities of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], in which the rites seemed to center around Demeter's search for and reunion with her daughter, which symbolized both the rebirth of crops in spring and the rebirth of the initiates after death. She is depicted as a mature woman, often crowned and holding sheafs of [[wheat]] and a torch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=March|first1=Jennifer|title=Dictionary of classical mythology|date=2014|location=Demeter|isbn=9781782976356}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her symbols are the [[cornucopia]], wheat-ears, the winged serpent, and the lotus staff. Her sacred animals include pigs and snakes.

|-
| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:Dionysos Louvre Ma87 n2.jpg|160px]]
|'''[[Dionysus]]''' ({{lang|grc|Διόνυσος}}, ''Diónysos'')/'''Bacchus''' ({{lang|grc|Βάκχος}}, ''Bákkhos'')

God of wine, fruitfulness, parties, festivals, madness, chaos, drunkenness, vegetation, ecstasy, and the theater. He is the twice-born son of [[Zeus]] and [[Semele]], in that Zeus snatched him from his mother's womb and stitched Dionysus into his own thigh and carried him until he was ready to be born. In art he is depicted as either an older bearded god (particularly before 430 BC) or an [[Effeminacy|effeminate]], long-haired youth (particularly after 430 BC). His attributes include the [[thyrsus]], a drinking cup, the grape vine, and a crown of [[ivy]]. He is often in the company of his [[thiasos]], a group of attendants including [[satyr]]s, [[maenad]]s, and his old tutor [[Silenus]]. The consort of Dionysus was [[Ariadne]]. It was once held that Dionysius was a later addition to the Greek pantheon, but the discovery of [[Linear B]] tablets confirm his status as a deity from an early period. Bacchus was another name for him in Greek, and came into common usage among the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=March|first1=Jennifer|title=Dictionary of classical mythology|date=2014|location=Dionysus|isbn=9781782976356}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sacred animals include dolphins, serpents, tigers, and donkeys. 

|-
| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:Hades-et-Cerberus-III.jpg|160px]]
|'''[[Hades]]''' ({{lang|grc|ᾍδης}}, ''Hádēs'')/'''[[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]''' ({{lang|grc|Πλούτων}}, ''Ploutōn'')

King of the underworld and the dead. God of wealth. His consort is [[Persephone]]. His attributes are the [[drinking horn]] or [[cornucopia]], key, sceptre, and the three-headed dog [[Cerberus]]. His sacred animals include the screech owl. He was one of three sons of [[Cronus]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], and thus sovereign over one of the three realms of the universe, the underworld. As a [[chthonic]] god, however, his place among the Olympians is ambiguous. In the [[mystery religions]] and Athenian literature, Plouton ("the Rich one") was his preferred name, because of the idea that all riches came from the earth. The term ''Hades'' was used in this literature to refer to the underworld itself. The Romans translated ''Plouton'' as [[Dis Pater]] ("the Rich Father") or Pluto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=March|first1=Jennifer|title=Dictionary of classical mythology|date=2014|location=Hades|isbn=9781782976356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:Vulcan Coustou Louvre MR1814.jpg|160px]]
|'''[[Hephaestus]]''' ({{lang|grc|Ἥφαιστος}}, ''Hḗphaistos'')

God of fire, metalworking, and crafts. Either the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]] or Hera alone, he is the smith of the gods and the husband of the adulterous [[Aphrodite]]. He was usually depicted as a bearded, crippled man with hammer, tongs, and anvil, and sometimes riding a donkey. His sacred animals include the donkey, the guard dog, and the crane. Among his creations was the armor of [[Achilles]].

==History==
{{See also|Demographic history of Macedonia}}
The [[Slavs|Slavic]] population in the region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] had been referred to both (by themselves and outsiders) as [[Bulgarians]], and that is how they were predominantly seen since 10th,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.bg/books?id=ppbuavUZKEwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Who+are+the+Macedonians&amp;hl=bg#v=snippet&amp;q=Crampton&amp;f=false Who are the Macedonians?] Hugh Poulton, C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers, 2000, {{ISBN|1-85065-534-0}}, p. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/im3/im_6_1.htm Средновековни градови и тврдини во Македонија, Иван Микулчиќ, Македонска академија на науките и уметностите – Скопје, 1996, стр. 72.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/da/da_summary.htm Formation of the Bulgarian Nation, Academician Dimitŭr Simeonov Angelov, Summary, Sofia-Press, 1978, pp. 413–415.]&lt;/ref&gt; up until the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/pdf/cedime-se-bulgaria-macedonians.PDF Center for Documentation and Information on Minorities in Europe, Southeast Europe (CEDIME-SE) – "Macedonians of Bulgaria", p. 14.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723084106/http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/pdf/cedime-se-bulgaria-macedonians.PDF |date=2006-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica]], at the beginning of the 20th century the Macedonian Bulgarians constituted the majority of the population in the whole region of Macedonia, then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Bulgarians (described in encyclopaedia as "Slavs, the bulk of which is regarded by almost all independent sources as Bulgarians"): 1,150,000, whereof, 1,000,000 Orthodox and 150,000 Muslims (the so-called Pomaks); Turks: c. 500,000 (Muslims); Greeks: c. 250,000, whereof c. 240,000 Orthodox and 14,000 Muslims; Albanians: c. 120,000, whereof 10,000 Orthodox and 110,000 Muslims; Vlachs: c. 90,000 Orthodox and 3,000 Muslims; Jews: c. 75,000; Roma: c. 50,000, whereof 35,000 Orthodox and 15,000 Muslims; In total 1,300,000 Christians (almost exclusively Orthodox), 800,000 Muslims, 75,000 Jews, a total population of c. 2,200,000 for the whole of Macedonia.&lt;/ref&gt; The functioning of the [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] then aimed specifically at differentiating the Bulgarian from the [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Serbs|Serbian]] populations on an ethnic and linguistic basis, providing the open assertion of a Bulgarian [[national identity]].&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Modern Greek Studies 14.2 (1996) 253-301 Nationalism and Identity Politics in the Balkans: Greece and the Macedonian Question by Victor Roudometof.&lt;/ref&gt; However one basic distinction between the political agendas of local intelligentsias was clear. The [[Macedonian Greeks]] and Serbs followed, in general, the directives coming from their respective centers of national agitation, while by the Bulgarians the term ''Macedonian'' was acquiring the significance of a certain political loyalty, that progressively constructed a particular spirit of ''[[Regionalism (politics)|regional]]'' identity.&lt;ref&gt;We, the People: Politics of National Peculiarity in Southeastern Europe, Diana Mishkova, Central European University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|963-9776-28-9}}, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Balkan Wars]] (1912–1913) and [[Balkans Campaign (World War I)|World War I]] (1914–1918) left Ottoman Macedonia divided between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and resulted in significant changes in its ethnic composition. The immediate effect of the partition of Ottoman Macedonia were the nationalistic campaigns in areas under Greek and Serbian administration, which expelled Bulgarian churchmen and teachers and closed Bulgarian schools and churches. As a consequence a sizable part of the Slavic population of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek]] and Serbian (later Yugoslav Macedonia), fled to Bulgaria or was resettled there by virtue of a population exchange agreements. Within Greece, the Macedonian Slavs were designated "Slavophone Greeks", while within Serbia (later within [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]) they were officially treated as "South Serbs". In both countries, schools and the media were used to disseminate the national ideologies and identities, and also the languages, of the new ruling nations, the Greeks and the Serbs. These cultural measures were reinforced by steps to alter the composition of the population: Serb colonists were implanted in Yugoslav Macedonia, while in Greek Macedonia, the mass settlement of [[Greek refugees]] from [[Anatolia]] definitively reduced the Slav population to minority status.&lt;ref&gt;Nationality on the Balkans. The case of the Macedonians, by F. A. K. Yasamee. (Balkans: A Mirror of the New World Order, Istanbul: EREN, 1995; pp. 121-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

However most researchers agree that the bulk of the Slavic population in the region had a Bulgarian national identity until the early 1940s, when the [[Military history of Bulgaria during World War II|Bulgarian troops, occupying most of the area]], were greeted as liberators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.bg/books?id=qYAwZFwyYdwC&amp;pg=PR25&amp;lpg=PR25&amp;dq=Chris+Woodhouse+Struggle+for+Greece+1941-1949&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J5ici_BiG8&amp;sig=XNvw0-nu6u5wBkwo63CbxMxkPKI&amp;hl=bg&amp;ei=GIXlSci1OouQsAb58PWdCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5#PPA67,M1 The struggle for Greece, 1941–1949], Christopher Montague Woodhouse,  C.

'''Maltese in Belgium''' are people from [[Malta]] resident in [[Belgium]], whether permanently or temporarily. They include [[People of Malta|Maltese]] who have acquired [[People of Belgium|Belgian]] citizenship, students and workers with [[International organization]]s.

== Population ==
Before 2003, the Maltese in Belgium were mostly people married to Belgians who had emigrated to the country or Maltese diplomats. In 2003 the employment of [[Maltese people|Maltese]] nationals with the [[European Union]] (EU) started in earnest in view of Malta's membership of the organisation.

Belgian national statistics show that the number of Maltese in Belgium stood at 252 as of 1 January 2008.&lt;ref name="statbel.fgov.be"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statbel.fgov.be/fr/modules/publications/statistiques/population/nationalite_actuelle_de_la_population_par_commune.jsp |title=Nationalité actuelle de la population par commune |language= fr |publisher=www.statbel.fgov.be |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 159 lived in [[Brussels-Capital Region|Brussels]], 70 in [[Flemish Region|Flanders]] and 23 in [[Wallonia]].&lt;ref name="statbel.fgov.be"/&gt;  This represents a significant increase over previous years: in 2005 the number of Maltese in Belgium stood at 133&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statbel.fgov.be/fr/binaries/p202y2005_fr_tcm326-39290.pdf |title=Population et menages |publisher=www.statbel.fgov.be |accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at 192 in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statbel.fgov.be/fr/binaries/p202y2006_fr_tcm326-39292.pdf |title=Population et menages |publisher=www.statbel.fgov.be |accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A more recent estimate quotes the figure of 400 Maltese in Belgium in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlament.org.mt/file.aspx?f=10666 |title=Kamra tad-Deputati (Malta) |publisher=www.parlament.org.mt |date=2012-07-10 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of Maltese working with the EU institutions and consultative bodies is of 378 in 2016 (an increase over the 365 in 2013 and 324 in 2010). Of these 291 are permanent. As regards EU agencies, they employ 45 Maltese (increase on 33 in 2013), only one of which is permanent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://maltinfilbelgju.wordpress.com/2017/07/20/numru-ta-maltin-jahdmu-mal-ue-3/ Maltin fil-Belgju]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Society ==
Most of the Maltese are in Belgium because of their employment with the EU. It is in fact estimated that of the 324 Maltese employed with the EU in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pq.gov.mt/PQweb.nsf/06d013e9f9ab0283c12568f50054014f/c1256e7b003e1c2dc12576ee002afbd9?OpenDocument |title=Twegiba ghall-mistoqsija parlamentari numru 15749 |publisher=www.pq.gov.mt |date=2010-03-15 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; around 250 worked in Belgium.&lt;ref name="maltin.be"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maltin.be/en.html |title=Maltin fil-Belgju asbl |publisher=www.maltin.be |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is why they consider themselves to [[expatriates]] rather than [[emigrant]]s as was the case with the [[Culture of Malta#Maltese Diaspora|Maltese Diaspora]] in the [[Maltese people#Maltese emigration and expatriation|demographic movements]] of previous generations.

This also explains why most Maltese in Belgium either live in the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] or the municipalities bordering this region, in the area in and around the [[Brussels Ring]].

The 2008 statistics indicate a community that's more or less evenly balanced between the sexes and whose members are predominantly in the 25-40 age groups.&lt;ref name="maltin.be"/&gt;

The '''National Women's History Project''' is an [[United States|American]] non-profit organization dedicated to honoring and preserving women's history. Based out of [[Santa Rosa, California]] since 1980, it was started by women's history activists Molly Murphy MacGregor, [[Mary Ruthsdotter]], Maria Cuevas, Paula Hammett and Bette Morgan.

The NWHP started by leading a coalition that successfully lobbied Congress to designate March as [[Women's History Month]], now celebrated across the country. Today, the NWHP is known nationally as the only clearinghouse providing information and training in multicultural women’s history for educators, community organizations, and parents-for anyone wanting to expand their understanding of women contributions to U. S. history.{{who|date=July 2014}}

==History==

===Over 30 years of "Writing Women Back into History"===
From a Grassroots Organization into a National Institution &lt;br /&gt;
•	In 1980, the NWHP was a group of women who noticed that women were absent from textbooks. No more than 3% of the content was devoted to women. &lt;br /&gt;
•	Girls had few role models. Girls and boys and many adults assumed women did nothing important. The founders thought this perception needed to be addressed. &lt;br /&gt;
•	The NWHP convinced Congress and the White House of the need for our nation to celebrate and recognize women’s role in history on an annual basis. As a result of their efforts, the week of March 8 ([[International Women’s Day]]) was officially designated as Women’s History Week. In 1987, the NWHP led the successful campaign to have the entire month of March declared [[Women's History Month]]. &lt;br /&gt;
•	The NWHP mobilizes the national celebrations of Women's History Month in March each year by choosing an annual theme. &lt;br /&gt;
•	They promote a multicultural women’s history perspective by honoring women of diverse cultural, ethnic, occupational, racial, class, and regional backgrounds. &lt;br /&gt;
•	Every year the NWHP sends out 100,000 catalogs and distribute tens of thousands of women's history posters, celebratory materials, books, videos, and curriculum resources. &lt;br /&gt;
•	The NWHP website has over 1,000,000 visitors a year. Additionally, the staff answers over 2,500 e-mails and letters each year from students, teachers, reporters, and other interested individuals requesting information. &lt;br /&gt;
•	The staff has conducted women's history training sessions and women's historic site tours in 42 states, and has trained over 30,000 teachers and federal program managers and has delivered over 2,500 speeches. &lt;br /&gt;
•	The NWHP created a national clearinghouse to provide multicultural women's history information, materials, referrals, and strategies. This service also provides easy access to women's history performers, organizations, museums, and historic sites.&lt;br /&gt; 
•	They have designed, developed, and produced more than 200 multicultural women’s history resource materials, such as videos, speeches, posters, celebratory items, guides, program kits, and curriculum units. &lt;br /&gt; 
•	In 1995 and 1998, the NWHP led national campaigns to celebrate and recognize the work of women in expanding and enriching democracy. In 1995, they celebrated the 75th anniversary of women in the United States winning the right to vote and in 1998 the 150th anniversary of the Women's Rights Movement. In 2005, they celebrated the 85th anniversary of the ratification of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] and the 25th anniversary of the women's history movement. In 2010 they marked the 90th anniversary of U.S. women gaining the right to vote. &lt;br /&gt;
•	In 1997 the NWHP launched a website to serve as the digital clearinghouse for multicultural women's history information. Today, this award-winning website is the first women's history choice on all website search engines. &lt;br /&gt;
•	The NWHP has worked with the President’s Commission on the Celebration of Women in American History. Executive director Molly Murphy MacGregor was appointed by the White House to serve on the Congressional Commission on Women's Historic Landmarks. &lt;br /&gt;
•	The NWHP believes that "'Our History Is Our Strength"'

===Accomplishments===
The National Women’s History Project has been recognized for its groundbreaking work in education and its many nationally recognized programs and services by organizations throughout the country, including: &lt;br /&gt;
•	The National Association for Multicultural Education Award. &lt;br /&gt;
•	The [[Jessie Bernard]] Wise Women Award from the Center for Women Policy Studies. &lt;br /&gt;
•	The [[National Education Association]]’s prestigious Mary Hatwood Furtrell Award. &lt;br /&gt;
•	The  Myra Sadker Equity Award for their work in achievement in gender equity.

==Mission==
The National Women’s History Project is an educational nonprofit organization whose mission is to recognize and celebrate the diverse and historic accomplishments of women by providing information and educational materials and programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwhp.org|title=National Women's History Project|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They explain their mission this way: ''The impact of women’s history might seem abstract to some, and less pressing than the immediate struggles of working women today.  But to ignore the vital role that women’s dreams and accomplishments play in our own lives would be a great mistake.  We draw strength and inspiration from those who came before us – and those remarkable women working among us today.  They are part of our story, and a truly balanced and inclusive history recognizes how important women have always been in American society.''  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwhp.org|title=National Women's History Project|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The NWHP promotes women's history because, ''By walking history’s pathways, we learn to step forward with confidence. The legacy of how others shaped society sparks our own longings to contribute. Everyone needs role models — footsteps enough like our own to inspire us.
History must tell the whole story. For girls, knowing women’s achievements expands their sense of what is possible. For all of us, knowledge of women’s strengths and contributions builds respect and nourishes self esteem — crucial to all children and adults now, and in the years to come.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwhp.org|title=National Women's History Project|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The enduring goal of the NWHP is to ''“make history”'' accurate by continuing to recognize and celebrate women’s authentic contributions through current and future projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwhp.org|title=National Women's History Project|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Normanton Incident(1886).jpg|280px|right|thumb|[[Georges Ferdinand Bigot]] "The Rescue of the Menzare"("TOBAE" Issue #9, June 1887)
&lt;nowiki&gt;----&lt;/nowiki&gt;
[[Georges Ferdinand Bigot]], a French artist who dedicated much of his career to Japan, was an early adopter of the idea that the Unequal Treaties levied on Japan should be revised.  In this particular work, Bigot satirizes the sinking of a French mail ship that was lost off the coast of [[Shanghai]] in 1887 by comparing it with the conduct of the British crew of the ''Normanton''.&lt;ref&gt;Keene, ''Emperor of Japan'', p. 805&lt;/ref&gt;  In the picture, we see Captain Drake astride the lifeboat asking the people drowning in the waves, "How much money do you have on you?  Quick!  Time is Money!"]]

The {{nihongo|'''Normanton incident'''|ノルマントン号事件|Norumanton-gō jiken}} was a set of events surrounding the sinking of a British [[merchant vessel]] named ''Normanton'' off the coast of what is now [[Wakayama Prefecture]] on October 24, 1886.  The vessel was registered to the Madamson &amp; Bell Steamship Company when it ran aground and sank, drowning all the Japanese passengers aboard.  The event sparked a major uproar in the Japanese population when the subsequent court case in the [[British Court for Japan]] highlighted the unjustness of the [[unequal treaties]] that were levied on [[Japan]] at the time by the leading countries of the [[West]].

== Overview ==
On the evening of October 24, 1886, the 240-ton British cargo ship ''Normanton'', laden with both goods and 25 Japanese passengers, left [[Yokohama]] Harbor and set sail for the port of [[Kobe]] around 8:00pm.  However, en route to her destination she was caught in heavy wind and rains all the way from [[Yokkaichi, Mie|Yokkaichi]] in [[Mie Prefecture]] to the Cape of Kashinozaki in Wakayama Prefecture, where the vessel was wrecked.  She ran aground on an offshore reef and was lost.&lt;ref name="tanaka_444"&gt;[[#Tanaka|Tanaka(1990)p.444]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship’s [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] John William Drake and all European (ethnic [[British people|British]] and [[German people|German]]) crewmen escaped the sinking ship in [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s, leaving the non-European crewmen (twelve [[Indian people|Indians]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese]]) and the 25 [[Japanese people|Japanese]] passengers aboard to fend for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Keene, Emperor of Japan, pp. 410-411&lt;/ref&gt; The Europeans were picked up by coastal fishermen who took them in.&lt;ref name="tanaka_444"/&gt; Three of the survivors of the shipwreck died of [[hypothermia]] and were buried once the crew reached the shore.&lt;ref name="tanaka_444"/&gt; None of the 25 Japanese passengers aboard the ''Normanton'' survived.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;According to [[#Inuoe|Inuoe Kiyoshi's "Revising the Treaties"(条約改正, ''jouyaku kaisei'')(1955)]]there were only 23 Japanese passengers aboard the Normanton.  Additionally, he asserts that of the 38 British crew members and 1 Indian cabin boy aboard, only 25 crew members, Captain Drake, and the cabin boy made it out alive.  The other 13 crew members were lost at sea.  Furthermore, the official time the boat sank is given as approximately 1:00 AM, October 25th.  The time Drake, et al managed to paddle their way to the shore at [[Kushimoto, Wakayama|Kushimoto]] and to rescue at 9:00 AM the same day[[#Inoue|Inoue(1955)p.39]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KaoruM13.jpg|150px|left|thumb|[[Inoue Kaoru]], first Minister for Foreign Affairs (photograph taken in 1880)]]
On October 28, [[Inoue Kaoru]], Minister for Foreign Affairs for [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Itō Hirobumi]]'s first cabinet, received a telegram from Matsumoto Kanae, Governor of Wakayama Prefecture, briefly outlining the events surrounding the shipwreck.  He was alarmed by the fact that all the Japanese passengers were lost, and ordered an investigation of the situation on the spot.&lt;ref name="tanaka_444"/&gt; However, Japanese officials were hindered in their efforts to verify the facts of the incident by the wall imposed by the [[Unequal Treaties]].  Reportedly, they were never able to reach a satisfactory end to their investigation.
At a Marine Accident hearing at the British consulate in Kobe the following month, Captain Drake was declared innocent of any wrongdoing. James Troup, British [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] approved the following official statement on November 5.  "The crew urged the Japanese passengers to get to the lifeboats as quickly as possible, but the Japanese failed to understand the English instructions.  In turn, they did not comply with the crew's wishes, but instead holed themselves up inside the ship and didn't even try to come out.  The crew had no choice but to the leave the Japanese and take to the lifeboats.  (Since the ''Normanton'' was a cargo ship, there was no staff in place to handle Japanese speaking passengers.)"  The captain and the crew were found not guilty by the investigation.&lt;ref name="inoue_039"&gt;[[#Inoue|Inoue(1955)p.39]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public opinion]] in Japan was outraged over what was perceived to be a case of [[racial prejudice]].&lt;ref name="fujimura_082"&gt;[[#Fujimura|Fujimura(1989)p.82]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sakeda"&gt;[[#Sakeda|Sakeda(2004)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  A good example of public sentiment at the time can be found in the ''[[Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun]]'' (forerunner of the ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]],'' founded in 1872.)  The paper reported in an outrage that, "If the Captain and the more than 20 seamen under him were able to be rescued, it makes sense that at least one or two Japanese passengers would have been saved along with them.  However, the ugly truth is all of them were lost."  In another article, they claimed that, "If the passengers had been Westerners, they would have been rescued immediately.  These men were left to die because they were Japanese".&lt;ref name="ienaga_102"&gt;[[#Ienaga|Ienaga(1977)p.102]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese public was outraged on hearing the verdict.  The following ran in the ''Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shinbun'', a paper that publicly protested the event in print.  "No matter how ignorant you may think the Japanese are, to claim that they could stare into the face of danger and fail to recognize the gravity of the situation is absurd.  The idea that these people were too stupid to know how to save themselves or even get help from others is a grave fallacy."&lt;ref name="ienaga_102"/&gt;&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;白痴瘋癲 (''hakuchifuuten'') translates to "crazy fool."&lt;/ref&gt;  Donations poured in from all over the country to support the families of the victims who lost their lives.  Entire newspapers covered nothing but stories about the incident for days on end, supported by mournful editorials and articles calling for the removal of the officials in question.  Even well-known legal scholars openly accused Captain Drake.  Fringe politicians across the land held open meetings in which they publicly condemned Britain's violence and record of violating human rights while they rallied for the return of political power to the Japanese people.&lt;ref name="inoue_039"/&gt;

Some English language newspapers were also shocked by the verdict.  The North China Herald in Shanghai called the decision of the Board of Enquiry a "farce", a "miscarriage of justice" and a "complete whitewash"&lt;ref&gt;North China Herald, 22 December 1886&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Meiji government|Japanese government]] had gone great lengths in trying to re-negotiate the Unequal Treaties.  Foreign Minister Inoue had been a staunch supporter of the country's [[Europeanization]] by hosting elaborate balls at the ''[[Rokumeikan]],'' however he could do nothing to silence the storm of domestic controversy rising across the land.

On November 13, he ordered the Governor of [[Hyogo Prefecture]] Utsumi Tadakatsu to prevent Captain Drake and crew from leaving Kobe's port, and brought charges of murder against the Captain and his men under the governor's name in the [[British Court for Japan]] in [[Yokohama]] (upper [[consular court]]).&lt;ref name="tanaka_444"/&gt;  The prosecution took place the following day on 14th.  The British held a preliminary hearing in Kobe, and then moved the case to Yokohama.  On December 8, Judge [[Nicholas John Hannen|Hannen]] of the [[British Court for Japan]] in Yokohama found Drake guilty of [[criminal negligence]], and sentenced him to three months imprisonment. However, the British consular court rejected any compensation for the families of the victims.&lt;ref name="tanaka_444"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inoue_039"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chang, The Justice of the Western Consular Courts&lt;/ref&gt;  In sentencing Drake, Judge Hannen told him: "We have been accustomed to expect from the merchant service of England heroism and devotion to the interests of the crew and passengers that I am afraid in this case were wanting."&lt;ref&gt;Japan Gazette 8 December 1886&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

=== The Japanese Solidarity Movement ===
The Normanton Incident fanned an increase in anti-British and anti-foreign sentiment in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Wakabayashi, Modern Japanese Thought, pp. 86&lt;/ref&gt; and was upheld as an example of the urgent need to revise the Unequal Treaties which Japan had signed with various foreign powers, especially with regards to clauses pertaining to [[extraterritoriality]].&lt;ref&gt;Austin, Negotiating with Imperialism&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was picked up by the Solidarity Movement Party, then in its infant stages.  They raised the issue all across the land, criticizing Inoue's handling of the situation as "coquettish" and "cowardly" diplomacy.  As a result of this incident, the movement, which demanded foreign policy reform as well as the abolishment of the Unequal Treaties, was significantly strengthened.&lt;ref name="sakeda"/&gt;

=== Media ===

==== Theater and Print ====
After the incident, there were some who hoped to turn the incident into a drama for the theater, but the government, fearing another flare up of civil unrest, effectively shut down the operation.&lt;ref name="tanaka_444"/&gt;

At the same time, a book entitled "A Complete Guide to the Trial of the Events Surrounding the Sinking of the British Ship `Normanton`" was published immediately after the incident occurred.  "The Court Records of the British Steamship "Normanton"" were also published the following year in 1887.&lt;ref name="inoue_039"/&gt;

==== "The Normanton Sinks Beneath the Waves" ====
Immediately following the incident a song entitled "The Normanton Sinks Beneath the Waves" (Normanton-go chimbotsu no uta) was written anonymously and quickly caught on with people across the country.  There were originally only 36 stanzas to the song, but by the time the incident had come to a close the number had ballooned to 59.  The tune is set to the old military standard "With Swords Drawn" (original Japanese version: , ''battōtai''.)

The song begins with an ominous opening:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The roar of the waves pounding against the shore &lt;br /&gt;
Awoken from a dream by a storm in the dead of night &lt;br /&gt;
Staring out at the great blue expanse &lt;br /&gt;
Wondering where the hell my fellow countrymen are &lt;br /&gt;

Try to call out, try to shout, but I have no voice &lt;br /&gt;
I seek and search but find not even a shadow &lt;br /&gt;
If the rumors are true, the passing moon &lt;br /&gt;
and twenty-five of our dearest brethren set sail

Godspeed your journey as the crow flies &lt;br /&gt;
We know a little bit about foreign ships &lt;br /&gt;
And we know those built by Brits &lt;br /&gt;
Are famed for their nautical prowess

Like lambs, we were led aboard the vessel &lt;br /&gt;
we passed all too quickly the 300 kilometers &lt;br /&gt;
of distant wake and water to old Totomi &lt;br /&gt;
only to reach Kumano Inlet in Kishuu

and then in the middle takes a surprising turn:&lt;ref name="inoue_039"/&gt;

O, the inhumanity of this foreign ship &lt;br /&gt;
The cruel and merciless captain &lt;br /&gt;
Whose very name reeks of cowardice &lt;br /&gt;
Watched their sorrowful plight from afar

Forgetting all of his responsibility &lt;br /&gt;
Hey made fast for a cowardly retreat &lt;br /&gt;
Dragging his men along with him &lt;br /&gt;
They jumped aboard the lifeboats

They see each others shadows off &lt;br /&gt;
Tears of regret cutting quick and deep &lt;br /&gt;
They wipe them down and fight them off &lt;br /&gt;
You're a hateful bastard, Drake

No matter how different your race may be &lt;br /&gt;
No matter how little you know of mercy &lt;br /&gt;
You just stood by and watched &lt;br /&gt;
You left us there to die, you coward
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These are but a few lines; the song itself goes on to say many things.&lt;ref name="ienaga_103"&gt;[[#Ienaga|Ienaga(1977)p.103]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;奴隷鬼 (''doreiku'') is a malicious [[pun]] used instead of Captain Drake's real name in the lyrics of the song. 奴隷 (''dorei'') means "[[slave]]" and 鬼 (read as "ku" here) means demon or [[ogre]]. [[#Ienaga|Ienaga(1977)p.103]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marine Rescue Japan ===
Influenced by the events surrounding the Normanton Incident, a volunteer-based marine rescue group known at the time as the ''Great Empire of Japan Marine Rescue Group'' was formed in 1889.  It is today known as "Marine Rescue Japan".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nishimuta|Nishimuta(2004)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nyangbo-Tafi''' language is spoken in the [[Volta Region]] of [[Ghana]]. It is considered one of the [[Ghana–Togo Mountain languages]] of the [[Kwa languages|Kwa family]].

It consists of two distinct varieties which ''Ethnologue'' treats as separate languages, Nyangbo (''Tutrugbu'') and Tafi (''Tegbo''). The differences are reported to be only phonological.

==Design==

===Traditional===

====Perahan====
The ''perahan'' (the top) is wide and loose with the sleeves also worn loose and pendent from the arms.&lt;ref&gt;Bellew, Henry Walter  (1862) Journal of a political mission to Afghanistan, in 1857 [https://books.google.com/books?id=JDYBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=afghan+costume+origins&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=siODVfzoLsWWsAGTto34BQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=dress&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional ''perahan'' varies according to the region of [[Afghanistan]] with some ending at the knees and others midway between the calf and the feet (in which case small slits are created).&lt;ref&gt;Elphinstone, Mountstuart  (1815) An Account of the Kingdom of Caubul, and Its Dependencies in Persia, Tartary, and India: Comprising a View of the Afghaun Nation, and a History of the Dooraunee Monarchy  [https://books.google.com/books?id=FOc-AAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=dress&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hilalplaza.com/islamic-culture/Afghanistan/Afghanistan_Muslim_culture.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willem V  Ogelsang (2007-2009) What Afghan Men Used to Wear in the Early Nineteenth Century [https://www.academia.edu/4395811/What_Afghan_men_used_to_wear_in_the_early_nineteenth_century._The_Right_Honourable_Mountstuart_Elphinstone_and_his_Account_of_the_Kingdom_of_Caubul]&lt;/ref&gt;   The traditional ''perahan'' also buttons on either shoulder, is collarless&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/clothing-xiii Iranicaonline]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AD8OAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=N.+H.+Dupree,+1977,+p.+388)&amp;dq=N.+H.+Dupree,+1977,+p.+388)&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAGoVChMI9PrZwfGTxgIVgRkUCh31UwDA Ehsan Yar-Shater. Encyclopaedia Iranica, Volume 5, Parts 5-8]&lt;/ref&gt; and is meant to be loose.&lt;ref&gt;Charpentier, Carl-Johan  (1972) Bazaar-e Tashqurghan--ethnographical studies in an Afghan traditional bazaar  [https://books.google.com/books?id=PA1uAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=perhan+tomban&amp;dq=perhan+tomban&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMI6ZKypPiUxgIVRD8UCh00FwA4]&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the traditional ''perahan'' is wide but fits closer to the body down  to the waist and then is loose and full down to the knees&lt;ref&gt;Elphinstone, Mountstuart  (1842)  An account of the kingdom of Caubul, and its dependencies, in Persia, Tartary, and India (1842) [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1157&amp;context=afghanenglish]&lt;/ref&gt; (thereby flaring out).

====Tunban====
The ''tunban'' (lower garment) is worn loose and hanging. Some versions of the ''tunban'' have the ample folds gathered into plaits at the lower part of the legs, below the knees to the ankles and the loose part above overhangs in loops.&lt;ref&gt;Bellew, Henry Walter  (1862) Journal of a political mission to Afghanistan, in 1857 [https://books.google.com/books?id=JDYBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=afghan+costume+origins&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=siODVfzoLsWWsAGTto34BQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=dress&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''tunban'' therefore uses a lot of material so that it gathers around the waist and folds around the legs.

===Modern version===
The modern ''Perahan tunban'' retains some of the loose features of the traditional ''Perahan tunban'' but is similar to the straight cut [[shalwar kameez]]. Some styles also have the buttons open at the front.

The modern ''Perahan'' uses side slits. However, unlike the straight cut kameez, the sides of the ''perahan'' are cut like an arch.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, John (2002) Inside Afghanistan: An American Aide Worker's Mission of Mercy to a War-Torn People [https://books.google.com/books?id=2wKVoe1zSLoC&amp;pg=PT58&amp;dq=afghan+clothing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Yc1oVdmVB8TZ7gaMjYDABQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=afghan%20clothing&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''tunban'' can be a yard wide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.public.asu.edu/~apnilsen/afghanistan4kids/clothing.html Afghan clothes]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pathani suit===
A version of ''Perahan tunban'' known as the "Kabuli suit" or the "Pathani suit", has become very popular in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perahan Tunban 'Mens clothes'|url=http://www.afghanistan-culture.com/perahan-tunban.html|work=afghanistan-culture.com|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bY8ck6iktikC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=afghan+sikh+culture&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HZnJ_-ozKa&amp;sig=5bNpi6TwiBI0HurXXg6IZs6xc8Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LnBqVNCeBsPLaK_XgOAB&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=afghan%20sikh%20culture&amp;f=false Culture and Customs of Afghanistan  By Hafizullah Emadi ]&lt;/ref&gt; The Pathani suit has collars and cuffed sleeves.

'''Robert A. Gordon''' (born August 10, 1932) is an American sociologist best known for his work on intelligence, criminality, and race.

Born in [[New York City]], he served in the [[United States Army]] from 1955-1957. Gordon earned his B.A. from the [[City College of New York|College of the City of New York]] in 1957, then attended the [[University of Chicago]], earning his M.A. in 1961 and his Ph.D. in 1963. That year, he began teaching at [[Johns Hopkins University]], until retiring in 2005.

He was the second husband of [[Linda Gottfredson]], and one of 52 signatories on "[[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]],&lt;ref name="gottfredson"&gt;Gottfredson, Linda (December 13, 1994). [[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]]. ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', p A18.&lt;/ref&gt;" a public statement written by Gottfredson, published in response to popular criticism of the conclusions presented in the controversial book ''[[The Bell Curve]]''.  He has also criticized a 1994 ABC news report on the [[Pioneer Fund]] in an extensive commentary.&lt;ref name="GordonPioneerPDF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pioneerfund.org/Gordon.pdf|title=Professor Robert A.

In an interview Gordon stated in response to the question "Do you think that people with low IQs should be paid to be sterilized?" replied:

{{quote|I think that's a rather shocking proposal! I would prefer not paying people. [Laughter] I do think that if we could persuade people with lower IQs not to have as many children as they are having, there would be obvious benefits. As far as black people are concerned, I don't know. If they care about the future of their race, they might be willing to go to some trouble to accomplish that. I think it's right to give them the proper information in order for them to do that.&lt;ref name="GordonInterview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/reingold/courses/intelligence/cache/eugenics2.html |title=Upstream: Interview with Robert Gordon|accessdate= September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4178">'''Royal Noble Consort''' was the title of royal concubines of Korean kings (including the [[Three Kingdoms]], [[Unified Silla]], [[Goryeo]] and [[Joseon Dynasty]] periods).  During the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (not including the Korean Empire at the end of Joseon), they were part of the ''naegung'' (내궁) and ranked beneath the queen, but above low-ranked concubines and court ladies (rank 5a and below).  This meant that Royal Noble Consorts from rank 1 to 4 were considered part of the Royal Family.

Thus, the [[Queen Consort]] (jungjeon 중전) was followed by 4 categories of high-ranked royal consorts, with 2 levels each.  Level a (jeong, 정) ranked above level b (jong, 종):

1a. Bin 빈 (嬪): Royal Noble Consort rank 1&lt;br&gt;
1b. Gwiin 귀인 (貴人)&lt;br&gt;
2a. Soeui 소의 (昭儀): Royal Noble Consort rank 2&lt;br&gt;
2b. Sukeui 숙의 (淑儀)&lt;br&gt;
3a. Soyong 소용 (昭容): Royal Noble Consort rank 3&lt;br&gt;
3b. Sukyong 숙용 (淑容)&lt;br&gt;
4a. Sowon 소원 (昭媛): Royal Noble Consort rank 4&lt;br&gt;
4b. Sukwon 숙원 (淑媛)&lt;br&gt; 

For the rank of Bin, the King or Queen consort would attach a prefix in association with the character/personality of the Royal Consort, such as Huibin (Hui = Radiant), Sukbin (Suk = Clarity/Purity), Euibin (Eui = Appropriate/Fitting), and so forth.  However, they are all of the same rank "Bin" so they are all of equal rank.

5a. ''sanggung'' (상궁 or 尙宮) and ''sangeui'' (상의 or 尙儀)
Court Ladies who served directly under the royal family members, and the head manager of their assigned department.  Depending on their role and department, there would be internal ranking within the sanggung. For example, a sanggung who served the Queen has higher authority and ranking than a sanggung who serves a prince, princess, and/or concubine.  A sanggung could also become a "Royal Concubine" if the King showed favor.  They would be called "favored sanggung" and would be considered the highest rank of the 5a. However, since they are still in the rank of 5, the "favored sanggung" would not be considered a member of the royal family, part of the naegung, and considered a Royal Noble Consort.  Instead, they would just be known as a concubine of the rank of sanggung.  However, the favored sanggung would have a sanggung of her own to serve her.

5b to 9b. Rankings of the lower class palace ladies and girls.  Palace ladies are usually admitted into the palace from a young age.  Therefore, the palace becomes their primary residence.  They are not allowed to leave the palace except on special occasions with the permission of the higher ranking.

[[File:SnatchThieves003.jpg|thumb|A cartoon illustrating snatch thieves in action]]
[[File:SnatchThieves004.jpg|thumb|These types of [[mopeds]] are typically used by snatch thieves]]
'''Snatch theft''' is a [[criminal]] act, common in [[Southeast Asia]], [[South America]], and [[Southern Europe]], of [[Robbery|forcefully stealing]] a pedestrian's personal property by employing rob-and-run tactics. 

==Description==
It is typical for two thieves to work together and ride a [[motorcycle]], [[moped]], or other type of motorbike to make theft and escape easier. One person steers the vehicle while another, the snatcher, does the act of theft itself.&lt;ref&gt;The Borneo Post Jan 9, 2016 [http://www.theborneopost.com/2016/01/09/comatose-snatch-theft-victim-regains-consciousness/ Comatose snatch theft victim regains consciousness] "she fell victim to a snatcher"&lt;/ref&gt; However, some snatch thieves work alone&lt;ref&gt;[[Tribune India]] Aug 30 2015 12:41AM [http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/cities/bathinda/woman-shows-exemplary-courage-pulls-down-snatcher-from-his-motorbike/126187.html Woman shows exemplary courage, pulls down snatcher from his motorbike]&lt;/ref&gt; or do not use a vehicle to escape.

==Argentina==
In [[Argentina]] this form of robbery increased by 118% between the years 2008 and 2009,&lt;ref&gt;http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2010/05/14/um/m-02195470.htm&lt;/ref&gt; possibly because motorbikes have become a lot cheaper and more accessible to the public. In that country, the perpetrators are called ''motochorros'', a [[neologism]] from the words ''moto'' (motorcycle) and ''chorro'' (a vulgar term for "thief").

==Malaysia==
A growing problem in [[Malaysia]], some instances of snatch theft have caused fatalities, when the person holding onto the handbag has been dragged by the motorbike, or through subsequent acts of violence. This, combined with the apparent lack of police control over crime, has prompted outrage among its citizens enough to take justice into their own hands in apprehending thieves.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

== Philippines ==
In the [[Philippines]], a crime including snatch theft that is committed by two persons or more is called "riding in tandem".&lt;ref name="inq"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/79545/riding-in-tandem|title=‘Riding in tandem’|last=Tan|first=Michael|date=October 24, 2014|newspaper=''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]''|accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term normally applies to two men riding on a [[motorcycle]] in [[tandem]].&lt;ref name="inq" /&gt;  The phrase "riding in tandem" was suggested as a 2014 "[[Filipino language|Filipino]] word of the year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/news-feature/2014/09/25/1373094/selfie-imba-peg-nominated-word-year|title='Selfie', 'imba', 'peg' nominated 'word of the year'|date=September 25, 2014|accessdate=August 5, 2014|newspaper=''[[The Philippine Star]]''|last=Viray|first=Patricia Lourdes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In [[Mandaluyong City]], an ordinance was passed to counter the crimes committed by persons riding in tandem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/635303/mandaluyong-channels-colombia-law-vs-men-riding-in-tandem|title=Mandaluyong channels Colombia law vs men riding-in-tandem|last=Sabillo|first=Kristine Angeli|newspaper=''Philippine Daily Inquirer''|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For easy identification, [[Dagupan City]], [[Cotabato City]], [[Dumaguete City]] and [[Batac, Ilocos Norte]] have local laws prohibiting motorcycle riders from wearing [[motorcycle helmet|helmets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=OnlineExclusive&amp;title=by-the-numbers-riding-in-tandem&amp;id=93063|title=By the numbers: Riding in tandem|last=Medina|first=Troy|date=August 20, 2014|newspaper=''[[BusinessWorld]]''|accessdate=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Quezon City]], the local police considered a measure that would require riders of motorcycles to wear vests displaying the license plate numbers of their vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/304479/news/metro/qc-motorbike-riders-to-get-vests-printed-with-plate-numbers|title=QC motorbike riders to get vests printed with plate numbers|last=Cayabyab|first=Marc Jayson|date=April 18, 2013|accessdate=August 5, 2016|newspaper=[[GMA News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Due to the rise of riding in tandem crimes, [[Senate of the Philippines|Philippine Senator]] [[Tito Sotto]] proposed a bill that would allow motorcycles to be ridden only by one person, with some exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://interaksyon.com/article/93132/riding-in-tandem--sotto-wants-ban-on-back-riders|title=RIDING IN TANDEM : Sotto wants ban on back-riders|last=Reyes|first=Ernie|date=August 12, 2014|accessdate=August 5, 2016|newspaper=[[TV 5 (Philippines)|InterAksyon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[Philippine National Police]], there were more than 3,000 cases involving crimes related to "riding in tandem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/metro-manila/01/28/14/pnp-riding-tandem-cases-reached-3000-2013|title=PNP: 'Riding-in-tandem' cases reached 3,000 in 2013|last=Sevidal|first=Edwin|date=January 28, 2014|accessdate=August 5, 2016|newspaper=[[ABS-CBN News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''St Ninian's Isle Treasure''' found on [[St Ninian's Isle]], [[Shetland]], Scotland, is the best survival of Scottish silver metalwork from the Early Medieval period, some pieces gilded. There are pieces for secular use such as a series of different [[penannular brooch]]es (some of them probably as unfinished half-ware) and different [[chape]]s from sword scabbards, pieces which might have been used for religious ceremonies and rituals like the bowls, spoons, and "thimbles" and all of those joined with some pieces of unsure meanings like the heavy ring chains or collars which are referred to as "power symbols of Pictish chieftains" by some scholars.  The brooches show a variety of typical Pictish forms, with both animal-head and lobed geometrical forms of terminal.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dell and Youngs&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of the scabbard chapes and a sword pommel appear to be [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] pieces, probably made in [[Mercia]] in the late 8th century; one has an inscription with a prayer in [[Old English]].  One of the mounts has a [[triple spiral]] design.  We know of exchanges of gifts between Anglo-Saxon and Pictish rulers, and generally "weapons are among the objects which travelled most widely in the early medieval period".&lt;ref&gt;Webster, pp 144-145, 144 quoted, though Youngs describes the same items as "Pictish".&lt;/ref&gt;

The treasure was discovered under a cross-marked slab in the floor of the early St. Ninian's church, on 4 July 1958 by a local schoolboy, Douglas Coutts. Coutts was helping visiting archaeologists led by Professor A. C. O'Dell of Aberdeen University at a dig on the isle. The silver bowls, jewellery and other pieces are believed to date from approx. [[0800|800]] AD.

The treasure was donated to the [[National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland]] (NMAS) in 1965-6 and is now in the successor [[Museum of Scotland]] in Edinburgh, whilst replicas are held by the [[Shetland Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Dell, Youngs, pp. 108-112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery==
Professor [[Andrew Charles O'Dell]], writing in December 1959 in ''Antiquity'' magazine, recounts that:&lt;br&gt;
:"... the church on this site was described early in the 18th century as being still venerated by local people although it had been abandoned at the Reformation in favour of a more central parish church ... ... from the sandy spit, which has formed between the mainland and the isle, gales have carried sand and this, together with the accretion of a graveyard in use until c.1850, buried the church remains and all knowledge of its exact location had vanished from living memory ... At the occasion of the first Viking Congress in 1951 Dr [[W. Douglas Simpson]] suggested a search might prove rewarding and this was undertaken in 1955 by a party of my students under my direction. The results in this and succeeding years have exceeded expectations. ... The medieval building with its massive mortared walls, main altar and a side altar had made the excavation noteworthy before 4 July 1958, when the hoard was discovered. Close to the southern chancel arch foundation, and missed by inches by later burials, was found a broken sandstone slab, 10.5 in. by 15 in., lightly inscribed with a cross and, below this, was the hoard. It had been contained in a larch box of which a few splinters, impregnated with metal salts, had escaped decay. The bowls were upside down and the brooches and other objects tangled together, showing it has been hurriedly carried and buried with the top down. In with the objects was the porpoise jawbone and this, the only non-metallic object, is strong evidence of its ecclesiastical connection, although the brooches suggest a secular link ..."&lt;ref&gt;O'Dell, A. (December 1959) ''Antiquity'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lahej''' ({{lang-ar|لحج}} ''{{transl|ar|Laḥij}}''), the '''Sultanate of Lahej''' ({{lang-ar|سلطنة لحج}} ''{{transl|ar|Salṭanat Laḥij}}''), or, sometimes, the '''Abdali Sultanate''' ({{lang-ar|سلطنة العبدلي}} ''{{transl|ar|Salṭanat al-‘Abdalī}})'', was a [[Sheikdom]] based in [[Lahej]] in [[Southern Arabia]]. The [[Sultanate]] became self-ruled in 1728 and gained independence in 1740. In 1839, the Sultanate became [[Aden Protectorate]] of the [[British Empire]], though nominally the 'Abdali Sultan retained his status. The Aden Protectorate was briefly ruled again by the Ottomans during World War I, but regained by the British and absorbed into [[Federation of South Arabia]] in 1963. The 'Abdali dynasty was officially abolished in 1967, with the proclamation of [[South Yemen]].

==History==
[[File:Sultan's Guest House at Lahej.jpg|thumb|300px|Guest House of the Sultan of Lahej,&lt;br/&gt;from an 1898 photograph by [[Henry Ogg Forbes]].]]

===Independent Sultanate===
Lahej was [[sultanate]] of the 'Abdali [[dynasty]]. In 1740 the 'Abdali sultan became independent.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1984 Edition, Vol. I, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The Sultanate of Lahej became an independent entity, from 1728 to 1839.

===Non-independent===
====British protectorate====
{{main|Aden Protectorate}}
The Sultanate of Lahej lost its independence to the British, after the [[Royal Navy]] [[Aden Expedition]] attack in 1839. The Sultan signed several treaties with the British.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title='Abdali sultanate|edition=15th |year=2010| volume=I: A-Ak&amp;nbsp;— Bayes|location= Chicago|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1863 opening of the [[Suez Canal]] caused the formation of the [[Aden Protectorate]]

The sultanate was one of the original "[[Nine Cantons]]" that signed individual British [[protectorate]] agreements with Great Britain, that in 1869 were joined together to become the Aden Protectorate. The Suez Canal also opened in 1869.

====Ottoman rule====
During World War I, the [[Ottoman Empire]] subjugated the Sultanate area.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; In 1918 Lahej was captured from Ottoman Empire suzerainty and restored as a [[British protectorate]].

====Reinstalled British protectorate and Federation of South Arabia====
Lahej typically enjoyed good relations with the British, despite the accidental killing of [[Sultan]] Fadhl ibn Ali al Abdali by British troops in 1918 who mistook him for an enemy [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turk]] soldier. In 1948, the [[Subayhi]] tribal area was absorbed into their sultanate.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

However, by 1958, Britain was worried that the sultan at the time, ''Ali bin Abd al Karim al Abdali'', an [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]], would refuse to join the British-sponsored [[Federation of Arab Emirates of the South]], and had him deposed. Lahej ended up joining the Federation and later the [[Federation of South Arabia]] in 1963.

===Aftermath===
====South Yemen====
In 1967 the new Communist regime expelled the Abdali Sultan. The dynasty of the Sultanate of Lahej was abolished with the founding of the [[Socialist state]] of [[South Yemen|People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]] (1967–1990).

====Unified Yemen====
The former territory of the Sultanate has been within the [[Yemen|Republic of Yemen]] since its unification in 1990.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

===Rulers===
The Sultans of Lahej had the title of ''Sultan Lahj''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Yemen_protectorate.html States of the Aden Protectorates]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abdali Sultans====

==Economy==

===British Empire===
The Sultanate of Lahej and others surrounding the Port of [[Aden]] had economic influence by supporting the important trade economy of the British Empire from South Asia.  Early 19th century industrial Britain, with its rapidly expanding economy, needed improved and reliable communication with [[British India]] and the [[East India Company]] operations.

The 1863 opening of the [[Suez Canal]] initiated further British trade protection strategies, securing the port of Adan and surroundings to serve the [[Red Sea]] shipping routes using its new canal.  The Sultanate was part of an effort of the British Empire to protect the East India Route, the sea route between the Mediterranean and India, in and through the southern coasts of the [[Arabian Peninsula]].

===Resources===
As of 1920, the Lahej region was producing [[salt]], from [[salt mine]]s owned by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] government, that passed through the Sultanate for shipping.&lt;ref name=Prothero97&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Arabia|year=1920|publisher=H.M.

The '''Tswa–Ronga languages''' are a group of closely related [[Southern Bantu languages]] spoken in Southern Africa chiefly in southern [[Mozambique]], northeastern [[South Africa]] and southeastern [[Zimbabwe]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Languages==
The group is divided into three main languages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.ethnologue.com/16/show_family.asp?subid=1936-16 |title=Ethnologue report for Tswa-Ronga (S.50) |publisher=Archive.ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tswa language|Tswa]] (''Xitswa''): Hlengwe (Khambana-Makwakwe, Khambani, Lengwe, Lhengwe, Makwakwe-Khambana, Shilengwe), Tshwa (Dzibi-Dzonga, Dzivi, Dzonga-Dzibi, Xidzivi), Mandla, Ndxhonge, Nhayi. Partially intelligible of Ronga [rng] and Tsonga [tso].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/TSC |title=Tswa |publisher=Ethnologue |date= |accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ronga language|Ronga]] (''Xironga'')  : Konde, Putru, Kalanga. Partially intelligible with Tsonga [tso] and Tswa [tsc].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/rng |title=Ronga |publisher=Ethnologue |date= |accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]] (''Xitsonga''), : Luleke (Xiluleke), Gwamba (Gwapa), Changana (Xichangana), Hlave, Kande, N’walungu (Shingwalungu), Xonga (Ssonga), Jonga (Dzonga), Nkuna, Songa, Nhlanganu (Shihlanganu).&lt;ref name="ethnologue1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/tso |title=Tsonga |publisher=Ethnologue |date= |accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tsonga" is used to refer to all three languages,{{cn|date=July 2017}} although often used interchangeably with Changana, the most prestigious of the three. All are recognized as languages, although inherently intelligible.&lt;ref name="ethnologue1"/&gt; The group also contains a variety of other minority languages and dialects which are undocumented and exist in an unwritten form.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Writing system==
{{Importance section|date=July 2017}}

The ''sintu'' writing system, ''[[Ditema tsa Dinoko]]'' (also known in [[Zulu language|Zulu]] as ''Isibheqe Sohlamvu''), for Southern Bantu languages, is used to represent all Tswa-Ronga languages consistently under one orthography.&lt;ref name=isibheqe.org&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isibheqe.org |title=Isibheqe Sohlamvu/Ditema tsa Dinoko |author=isibheqe.org |year=2015 |publisher=isibheqe.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes those marginal languages that have never been standardised in the Latin alphabet, such as the "East Sotho" varieties (Pulana, Khutswe and Pai). For example, it contains a specific [[grapheme]] indicating [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] or "cerebral" consonants, such as the [[retroflex ejective affricate]] occurring here in Pai:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57542">The '''Vietnam War POW/MIA issue''' concerns the fate of United States servicemen who were reported as [[missing in action]] (MIA) during the [[Vietnam War]] and associated theaters of operation in [[Southeast Asia]]. The term also refers to issues related to the treatment of affected family members by the governments involved in these conflicts. Following the [[Paris Peace Accords]] of 1973, 591 American [[prisoners of war]] (POWs) were returned during [[Operation Homecoming]]. The U.S. listed about 2,500 Americans as prisoners of war or missing in action but only 1,200 Americans were reported to have been killed in action with no body recovered. Many of these were Airmen who were shot down over [[North Vietnam]] or [[Laos]].  Investigations of these incidents have involved determining whether the men involved survived being shot down. If they did not survive, then the U.S. government considered efforts to recover its soldiers' remains. POW/MIA activists played a role in pushing the U.S. government to improve its efforts in resolving the fates of these missing soldiers. Progress in doing so was slow until the mid-1980s, when relations between the U.S. and Vietnam began to improve and more cooperative efforts were undertaken. Normalization of U.S. relations with Vietnam in the mid-1990s was a culmination of this process.

Considerable speculation and investigation has contributed to a hypothesis that a significant number of missing U.S. soldiers from the Vietnam Conflict were captured as [[prisoners of war]] by Communist forces  and kept as live prisoners after U.S. involvement in the war concluded in 1973. A vocal group of POW/MIA activists maintains that there has been a concerted conspiracy by the Vietnamese and American governments since then to hide the existence of these prisoners. The U.S. government has steadfastly denied that prisoners were left behind or that any effort has been made to cover up their existence. Popular culture has reflected the "live prisoners" theory, most notably in the 1985 film ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]''. Several congressional investigations have looked into the issue, culminating with the largest and most thorough, the [[United States Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs]] of 1991–1993 led by Senators [[John Kerry]], [[Robert C. Smith|Bob Smith]], and [[John McCain]]. It found "no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia."&lt;ref name="report-exec"/&gt;

The issue has been a highly emotional one to those involved, and is often considered the last depressing, divisive aftereffect of the Vietnam War for the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Rage, questions continue for families | author=Greenway, H.D.S. | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=1991-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,969996,00.html | title=Vietnam 15 Years Later | magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=1990-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{main|U.S. prisoners of war during the Vietnam War}}
The origins of the POW/MIA issue date back to during the war itself. Suffering from a lack of accurate intelligence sources inside North Vietnam, the U.S. never had solid knowledge for how many American prisoners of war were held.&lt;ref name="inside-32"&gt;{{cite book | last=McConnell | first=Malcolm |author2=Schweitzer III |author3=Theodore G  | title=Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives: Solving the MIA Mystery | publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year=1995 | isbn=0-671-87118-8}} pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the U.S. often relied upon possibly inaccurate North Vietnamese newspapers and radio broadcasts to find out who had been captured, as well as memorized lists of names brought out by the few American POWs given early release.&lt;ref name="inside-32"/&gt;  As the Department of Defense built up lists of those in the categories of killed in action, killed in action/body not recovered, prisoner of war, and missing in action, its tentative numbers fluctuated, but most of the time, the number of expected returnees upon war's end was around 600.&lt;ref name="inside-31"&gt;McConnell and Schweitzer, ''Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Nixon administration had made return of the POWs one of its central arguments to the American public for prolonging the war and bringing North Vietnam to terms.  In doing so, the administration exaggerated the number of POWs at issue, at one point stating that there were "fifteen hundred American servicemen" held throughout Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="inside-31"/&gt;  These higher numbers would be the focus of much of the controversy in the issue to come.&lt;ref name="inside-31"/&gt;

Following the [[Paris Peace Accords]] of January 1973, U.S. [[prisoners of war]] were returned during [[Operation Homecoming]] during February through April 1973.  During this, 591 POWs were released to U.S. authorities; this included a few captured in Laos and released in North Vietnam.  U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] announced that all U.S. servicemen taken prisoner had been accounted for.&lt;ref name="lat092292"/&gt;  At that time, the U.S. listed 2,646 Americans as unaccounted for,&lt;ref name="dpmo-histnew"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dtic.mil/dpmo/vietnam/ | title=Vietnam War Accounting History | publisher=[[Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office]] | accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; including about 1,350 prisoners of war or missing in action and roughly 1,200 reported killed in action and body not recovered.&lt;ref name="dpmo-hist"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dtic.mil/dpmo/vietnamwar/vietnam_history.htm | title=Vietnam War Accounting History | publisher=[[Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office]] | accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The low numbers of returnees from Laos caused some immediate concern, as previous Pentagon estimates were as high as 41 for prisoners held there, although only a few had been known to be captured for certain.&lt;ref&gt;McConnell and Schweitzer, ''Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigation of the fate of all the missing service personnel would end up residing with the [[Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office]].  The [[Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command]] also played a major role in subsequent investigations.  In 1973, the Defense Department established the Central Identification Laboratory–Thailand to coordinate POW/MIA recovery efforts in Southeast Asia.

The U.S. conducted some limited operations in [[South Vietnam]] in 1974 to find the remains of those missing, and pursuant to the Paris Accords, the North Vietnamese returned some remains too.  These efforts halted following the collapse of the Accords and the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, and over the next ten years, little progress was made in recovering remains.&lt;ref name="dpmo-histnew"/&gt;

During the late 1970s and 1980s, the friends and relatives of unaccounted-for American personnel became politically active, requesting the United States government reveal what steps were taken to follow up on intelligence regarding last-known-alive MIAs and POWs. When initial inquiries revealed important information had not been pursued, many families and their supporters asked for the public release of POW/MIA records and called for an investigation.

In 1979, the re-emergence of U.S. Private First Class [[Bobby Garwood]] constituted the only POW to surface following the end of the war and release of prisoners.  Garwood is considered by the Department of Defense to have acted as a collaborator with the enemy after he was taken prisoner, while it is claimed by proponents of the "live prisoners" belief, and by Garwood himself, that he was an American POW abandoned by the military.

==POW/MIA activist organizations==
[[File:United States POW-MIA flag.svg|right|thumb|The National League of Families' [[POW/MIA flag]], created in 1971 when the war was still in progress.]]
The [[National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia]] was created by [[Sybil Stockdale]], [[Evelyn Grubb]] and Mary Crowe as an originally small group of POW/MIA wives in Coronado, California and Hampton Roads, Virginia in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last2=Jose | first2=Carol | last=Grubb | first=Evelyn | authorlink=Evelyn Grubb | title= You Are Not Forgotten: A Family's Quest for Truth and the Founding of the National League of Families | publisher=[[Vandamere Press]] | location= New York | year= 2008 | isbn=0-918339-71-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Evelyn Fowler Grubb, 74, Leader Of a Group Supporting P.O.W.'s | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=2006-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sybil Stockdale's husband, Navy Commander [[James Stockdale]], was shot down in 1965 and she was determined to make the American people aware of the mistreatment of U.S. POWs.  This publicity resulted in better treatment of U.S. POWs from fall 1969 on.

After the war, the National League of Families became the leading group requesting information about those still listed as missing in action.  It was led by Ann Mills Griffiths.  Its stated mission was and is "to obtain the release of all prisoners, the fullest possible accounting for the missing and repatriation of all recoverable remains of those who died serving our nation during the Vietnam War in Southeast Asia."  The League's most prominent symbol is its [[POW/MIA flag]]. Newt Heisley designed this flag to represent America's missing men. This group was more established, less radical, and more connected to the government.&lt;ref name="inside"&gt;McConnell and Schweitzer, ''Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives'', p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Alliance of Families For the Return of America's Missing Servicemen]] was founded in 1990.  Its goal was and is to resolve the fates of any unreturned U.S. [[prisoners of war]] or [[missing in action]] from [[World War II]] on forward, not just Southeast Asia, and to gain the return of any live prisoners.  It is a 1980s-origined [[Schism (organizational)|splinter]] from the National League of Families,&lt;ref name="skk"&gt;{{cite book | last=Keating | first=Susan Katz | title=Prisoners of Hope:: Exploiting the POW/MIA Myth in America | publisher=[[Random House]] | location=New York | year=1994 | isbn=0-679-43016-4}} p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; created by members who were dissatisfied with Ann Mills Griffiths' leadership.&lt;ref name="skk"/&gt;  Compared to the older group, the National Alliance took a more activist, radical stance, especially towards belief in the existence of live prisoners in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="inside"/&gt;

The chair and co-founder of the group is Dolores Apodaca Alfond, whose brother Major Victor Joe Apodaca, Jr. was shot down in 1967 during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="nyt061692"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4DD103AF935A25755C0A964958260 | title=Gulag Held M.I.A.'s, Yeltsin Suggests | author=Barbara Crossette | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1992-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group was visible during the Kerry Committee hearings of the early 1990s,&lt;ref name="nyt061692"/&gt; but disagreed with the committee's findings that there was no compelling evidence of any live prisoners in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D81638F937A25752C0A965958260 | title= Senate Panel Report Fails to Settle M.I.A.

==Recovery and "rescue"==
In the mid-1980s, the U.S. and Vietnam increased the frequency of high-level policy and technical meetings to help resolve the POW/MIA issue. The U.S. government viewed this work as a humanitarian obligation. The Vietnamese slowly began to return American remains that they had previously collected and stored; eventually they permitted the U.S. to excavate a few crash sites.  The Lao government, with whom the USG maintained diplomatic relations, also agreed to several crash-site excavations in the mid-1980s. This resulted in the return and identification of the remains of a few dozen Americans. In Cambodia, political turmoil prevented such efforts.&lt;ref name="dpmo-hist"/&gt;

A number of individuals were not satisfied with or did not trust U.S. government actions in this area and took their own initiative.  Retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Jack Bailey created Operation Rescue, which featured a former smuggling boat named ''Akuna III'' and solicited funds from POW/MIA groups.&lt;ref name="inside-172"&gt;McConnell and Schweitzer, ''Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives'', pp. 170–172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isaacs-123"/&gt;  Bailey never produced any prisoners and the boat spent years never leaving its dock in [[Songkhla]] in Thailand, but the effort proved adept at bringing in money through the Virginia-based [[Eberle Associates]] direct mail marketing firm.&lt;ref name="isaacs-123"&gt;{{cite book | last=Isaacs | first=Arnold R. | title=Vietnam Shadows: The War, Its Ghosts, and Its Legacy | publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | year=2000 | isbn=0-8018-6344-9}} p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later revealed that Bailey had greatly exaggerated his military record.&lt;ref name="inside-172"/&gt;

During the 1980s, former [[United States Army Special Forces]] member [[Bo Gritz]] undertook a series of private trips into Southeast Asia, purportedly to locate American POWs whom some believed were still being held by Laos and Vietnam, for example at location [[Nhommarath]].  These missions were heavily publicized, controversial and widely decried as haphazard — for instance, as some commentators stated, few successful secret missions involve bringing to the border towns women openly marketing commemorative POW-rescue T-shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author=Colonel Robert K.

One such mission in 1982 was to free POWs reported to be in Laos; Gritz led 15 Laotians and 3 Americans, but they were ambushed shortly after crossing the border from Vietnam to Laos and the mission failed.&lt;ref name="daniel"/&gt;  Command Sergeant Major [[Eric L. Haney]], a former [[Delta Force]] operator and a holder of the "live prisoners" belief, later wrote that beginning in 1981 his unit was twice told to prepare for a mission involving the rescue of American POWs from Vietnam, but both times the missions were scrubbed, according to Haney, when Gritz suddenly appeared in the spotlight, drawing too much attention to the issue and making the missions too difficult to accomplish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Eric L. | last=Haney | title=[[Inside Delta Force|Inside Delta Force: The Story of America's Elite Counterterrorist Unit]] | publisher= [[Delacorte Press]] | year=2002 | isbn=0-385-33603-9 | pages=250–256}} Lieutenant General [[William G. Boykin|William G. "Jerry" Boykin]], a former commander of Delta Force, describes training for a Laos search mission for American MIAs in the 1980s in his 2008 memoir ''Never Surrender: A Soldier's Journey to the Crossroads of Faith and Freedom'' (page 203).&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States National Security Council|U.S. National Security Council]] would eventually say of him: "Throughout his years of involvement, Mr. Gritz contributed nothing of value to the POW/MIA issue. In fact, his activities have been counter-productive."&lt;ref&gt;McConnell and Schweitzer, ''Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives'', p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another figure of the 1980s was Scott Barnes, who claimed he had both been in a secret operation in Cambodia and had seen an American POW.&lt;ref name="valor"&gt;{{cite book | last=Burkett | first=B.G. |author2=Whitley, Glenna  | title=Stolen Valor : How the Vietnam Generation Was Robbed of Its Heroes and Its History | publisher=[[Verity Press]] | year=1998 | isbn=0-9667036-0-X}} pp. 422–424.&lt;/ref&gt;  His actions caused significant dissension among POW/MIA activists, especially once he claimed that he had seen more American POWs in Laos but had been ordered by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] to assassinate them.&lt;ref name="valor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prescott-92"/&gt; He published the 1987 book ''BOHICA'' that related this story.&lt;ref name="prescott-92"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=886&amp;dat=19920305&amp;id=xW9LAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5977,1246751 | title=American POWs left in Laos, area man to tell Senate | first=Steve | last=Lee | newspaper=[[The Prescott Courier]] | date=March 5, 1992 | page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[National League of Families]] ended up accusing him of exploiting the MIA issue for personal gain, as one wife had mortgaged her house to fund him.&lt;ref name="valor"/&gt;  Barnes, who had concocted much of his purported military background, would subsequently become a controversial figure within [[Ross Perot presidential campaign, 1992|Ross Perot's 1992 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.posner.com/articles/time.htm |title=Citizen Perot: book adaptation from ''Time'' |author=[[Gerald Posner|Posner, Gerald]] |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1996-08-05 |accessdate=2008-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630010314/http://www.posner.com/articles/time.htm |archivedate=June 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former American POW, [[Eugene McDaniel|Eugene "Red" McDaniel]], also became convinced that American prisoners had been left behind, and became active in the issue during the 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McDaniel | first=Dorothy | title=After the Hero's Welcome: A POW Wife's Story of the Battle Against a New Enemy | publisher=[[Bonus Books]] | year=1991 | isbn=0-929387-52-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on popular culture==
In the words of one analysis, "The notion that the United States may have left men behind was hard to fathom, and Americans chose to partly solve this complex problem through fictional characters."&lt;ref name="daniel"/&gt;

This was especially true in American films.  The first was [[Chuck Norris]]'s 1978 ''[[Good Guys Wear Black]]'', which postulated a cynical U.S. government writing off MIAs with a bogus mission.&lt;ref name="daniel"/&gt;  1983's ''[[Uncommon Valor]]'', starring [[Gene Hackman]], followed suit, as did Norris again in 1984 with ''[[Missing in Action (film)|Missing in Action]]''.

By far the most visible film in this theme was [[Sylvester Stallone]]'s ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' in 1985, which did the most to popularize the idea that American POWs had been left behind after the war and that the government had no real interest in their rescue.&lt;ref name="daniel"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA01/lundy/v/cinematic2.html | title=Left Behind: Cinematic Revisions of the Vietnam POW | author=Cathleen Lundy Daniel | publisher=[[University of Virginia]] | year=2001 | accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rambo character, who in this film may have been partly modeled after Bo Gritz,&lt;ref&gt;McConnell and Schweitzer, ''Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives'', p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Vietnam veteran commando still haunted by the multiple failures of the war.  The pivotal moment of the film occurs when Rambo, realizing he was betrayed by the U.S. government and under torture from the Vietnamese and their [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] allies, is put into radio communication with the officer who ordered the mission and tells him, "Murdoch. I'm coming to get ''you''!"  Rambo and the Norris films were commercially successful in both the United States and in Thailand and other parts of Southeast Asia, and did much to perpetuate the stock image of American prisoners held in bamboo cages.&lt;ref name="inside-170"&gt;McConnell and Schweitzer, ''Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives'', pp. 165, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rambo'' was followed by Norris's 1985 prequel ''[[Missing in Action 2: The Beginning]]'', as well as other films such as ''[[P.O.W. The Escape]]'' (1986) and ''[[Dog Tags (1990 film)|Dog Tags]]'' (1990) that shared similar conceits.&lt;ref name="daniel"/&gt;  The Vietnam war POW/MIA issue was also explored in some U.S. television series.  The long-running series ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' included multiple episodes in the mid-late-1980s whose central theme was the possibility of American POWs remaining in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Magnum Mania! [http://magnum-mania.com/Episodes/Season8/Unfinished_Business.html "Unfinished Business Episode Recap"], Note 2.  Retrieved on 1 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode "[[Unrequited (The X-Files)|Unrequited]]" also dealt with this notion. The POW/MIA issue was also part of a key story-line in the series ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' in the late 1990s where the father of central character [[Harmon Rabb]] had been an MIA in Vietnam. During the second, third and fourth seasons, evidence gradually mounted that Harm Sr. had been relocated to the Soviet Union where he had later escaped and been killed by Soviet soldiers in Siberia.&lt;ref name="JAG"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Gypsy Eyes|series=JAG|serieslink=JAG (TV series)|airdate=22 September 1998|season=4|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Vietnam War songs released in the United States dealt with the POW/MIA issue, but most were quite obscure and never achieved an audience. In the early-to-mid-1970s they largely looked at welcoming the prisoners home, and the impact of the war on veterans and their families. The only one to become a hit was [[Merle Haggard]]'s 1972 number one country single "[[I Wonder If They Ever Think of Me]]". In the 1980s, some POW/MIA songs took a similar approach to American Vietnam War films, which suggested that many hundreds of U.S. prisoners remained in Vietnam and that the U.S. government had abandoned them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brummer|first1=Justin|title=Vietnam War: P.O.W. / M.I.A.

==The "live prisoners" debate==
Several committee investigations within the [[U.S. Congress]] took place over the years.&lt;ref name="wtff"/&gt;  Some members of Congress were quite active on the issue.

For Vietnam veteran [[Robert C. Smith|Bob Smith]], Representative and later Senator from New Hampshire, the fate of possible missing or captured Americans in Vietnam had been Smith's major issue since his arrival in Congress in 1985.&lt;ref name="nyt090893"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D6163DF93BA3575AC0A965958260 | title= Claim of P.O.W. Cover-Up Rends Senate Decorum | author=[[Adam Clymer]] | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=1993-09-08 | accessdate=2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His interest was partly motivated by his own experience growing up without knowing how his own father died in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="nyt090893"/&gt;

North Carolina Congressman [[Bill Hendon]], who served two terms in the early-mid-1980s, was also quite active on the issue.  He and Smith met with President [[Ronald Reagan]] in January 1986 to discuss their belief that Vietnam was still holding American prisoners, and that U.S. intelligence agencies knew this but that the bureaucracy within the agencies was covering it up from even the [[U.S. Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]].&lt;ref name="Reagan Diary"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.newsobserver.com/659/story/582501.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20070514111849/http://www.newsobserver.com/659/story/582501.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2007-05-14 | title = Reagan dissed N.C. lawmaker in his diary | newspaper = [[The Raleigh News &amp; Observer]] | date = 2007-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reagan termed Hendon "way out yonder" on the issue, and after Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]] reported that even Smith would not agree with Hendon on some of these claims, Reagan concluded that "Bill is off his rocker".&lt;ref name="Reagan Diary"/&gt;

New York Congressman [[John LeBoutillier]], who served one term in the early 1980s, became interested in politics due to POW matters. After leaving Congress, he continued to be active in POW/MIA affairs. He founded the Sky Hook II Project, dedicated to recovering living American POWs in Southeast Asia. He has made frequent trips to [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]] and also met with Laotian and Vietnamese leaders in [[Hanoi]], [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Jakarta]], [[Vientiane]], and western cities.

Another political figure active in the POW/MIA issue was [[Tom Walsh (Wyoming politician)|Tom Walsh]], who became mayor of [[Casper, Wyoming]], and a three-term member of the [[Wyoming House of Representatives]]. Walsh made fourteen trips, at his own expense, to search for information on POWs and MIAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kulr8.com/news/wyoming/80668607.html|title=Tom Walsh, Former Casper Mayor Dies at 67|publisher=[[KULR-TV]]|accessdate=January 7, 2010|date=January 4, 2010|agency=[[Associated Press]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717033912/http://www.kulr8.com/news/wyoming/80668607.html#|archive-date=2011-07-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The POW/MIA issue heated up in the early 1990s.  Serious charges were leveled at the Bush administration (1989 to 1993) regarding the POW/MIA issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Ex-chief describes woes of POW office | newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] | date=May 31, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Defense]], headed by Secretary of Defense [[Dick Cheney]], was accused of covering up information and failing to properly pursue intelligence about American POW/MIAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Ex-Official Alleges Administration Coverup on POW/MIA Issue | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=May 22, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranking minority member on the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], Senator [[Jesse Helms]] of North Carolina, became interested in the matter. In October 1990 his chief staff aide, [[James P. Lucier]], prepared a report stating that it was probable there were live POWs still being held and that the Bush administration was complicit in hiding the facts.&lt;ref name="link-398"&gt;{{cite book | title=Righteous Warrior: Jesse Helms and the Rise of Modern Conservatism| author=Link, William A. | publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]] | year= 2008 | isbn= 0-312-35600-5 | pages=397–398}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report also alleged that the Soviet Union had held American prisoners after the end of [[World War II]] and more may have been transferred there during the [[Korean War]] and the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name="link-398"/&gt;  Helms stated that the "deeper story" was a possible "deliberate effort by certain people in the government to disregard all information or reports about living MIA-POWs."&lt;ref name="link-398"/&gt;  This allegation was followed in May 1991 by Helms' release of a minority report of the Foreign Relations Committee, entitled ''An Examination of US Policy Toward POW/MIAs'', which made similar claims and concluded that "any evidence that suggested an MIA might be alive was uniformly and arbitrarily rejected...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] | title=Report Rips U.S. Efforts For MIAs | agency=[[Associated Press]] | date=May 24, 1991 | page= 14A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The issuance of the report angered other Republicans on the committee, and after charges were made that the report contained errors, innuendo, and unsubstantiated rumors, Helms distanced himself from the POW/MIA issue.&lt;ref name="link-398"/&gt;  (This and other personnel matters led to Helms firing Lucier in January 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Link, ''Righteous Warrior'', pp. 400–401.&lt;/ref&gt;)

A July 1991 ''[[Newsweek]]'' cover photograph purported to show three American POWs still being held against their will, which increased general public interest in the issue.&lt;ref name="alexander-148"&gt;{{cite book | title = Man of the People: The Life of John McCain | first = Paul | last = Alexander | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9jN5cwr_YIwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Man+of+the+People%22&amp;sig=BXDf3N8PIDpDkNEH95RhDJsdAMU | isbn = 0-471-22829-X | year = 2002 | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the photograph turned out to be a hoax.&lt;ref name="alexander-148"/&gt;  Polls showed that a majority of Americans believed live POWs were indeed still being held captive;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DC133CF930A25752C0A964958260 | title= A Credible Search for M.I.A.'s | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1992-01-13 | accessdate=2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; a July 1991 ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' poll showed 70&amp;nbsp;percent of Americans believing this, and that three-fourths of them believed the U.S. government was not doing what needed to be done to gain their release.&lt;ref&gt;Keating, ''Prisoners of Hope'', p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in the matter intensified in June 1992 when [[President of the Russian Federation]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] told [[NBC News]] in an interview that some Americans captured during the Vietnam War may have been transferred from Hanoi to the Soviet Union: "Our archives have shown that it is true, some of them were transferred to the territory of the former U.S.S.R. and were kept in labor camps. We don't have complete data and can only surmise that some of them may still be alive."&lt;ref name="nyt061692"/&gt;

Ross Perot stated that he believed that hundreds of American servicemen were left behind in Southeast Asia at the end of the U.S. involvement in the war,&lt;ref name="nyt062092"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE1DC133FF933A15755C0A964958260 | title=Perot and Senators Seem Headed for a Fight on P.O.W.'s-M.I.A.'s | author=Patrick E.

For critics and skeptics, the allegations fail to convincingly answer the question as to what reason the Vietnamese (and other neighboring countries) would have to hang on to living prisoners. They could have been returned post-war, or being inconvenient witnesses to abuse more easily simply murdered.  Proponents of the theory often claimed that the prisoners were initially held back as part of a scheme to gain war reparations from the U.S., as cheap labor, or both,&lt;ref&gt;Television program In Search Of, MIAs. Alan Landsberg Productions&lt;/ref&gt; and then were continued to be held so that the Vietnamese would not have to admit to what they had done.

==Kerry committee==
{{Main|United States Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs}}
Senator Bob Smith introduced a 1991 resolution to create a Senate Select POW/MIA Committee.&lt;ref name="wtff"&gt;{{cite book | last=McCain | first=John | authorlink=John McCain |author2=[[Mark Salter]]  | title=[[Worth the Fighting For]] | publisher=[[Random House]] | year=2002 | isbn=0-375-50542-3}} pp. 242–243.&lt;/ref&gt;  Senator and fellow Vietnam War veteran [[John Kerry]] was the chair of the committee, and its third key member was Senator and former Vietnam War POW [[John McCain]].  Compared to earlier congressional investigations into the POW/MIA issue, this one had a mandate to be more skeptical and ask harder questions of government officials than before.&lt;ref name="wtff"/&gt;  The committee's work included more visits to Vietnam and getting the Department of Defense to declassify over a million pages of relevant documents.&lt;ref name="alex-152"&gt;Alexander, ''Man of the People'', pp. 152–154.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kerry and McCain said that they had gotten the Vietnamese to give them full access to their records, and that they had spent thousands of hours trying to find real, not fabricated, evidence of surviving Americans.&lt;ref name="alex-152"/&gt;

Some of the most publicized testimony before the committee came in September 1992, when former Nixon [[U.S. Defense Secretary|Defense Secretaries]] [[Melvin Laird]] and [[James Schlesinger]] said that the U.S. government had believed in 1973 that some American servicemen had not been returned from Laos, despite Nixon's public statements to the contrary.&lt;ref name="lat092292"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://tech.mit.edu/V112/N43/nixon.43w.html | title=Nixon Defense Secretaries Say U.S. Left POWs in Vietnam | author=William J. Eaton | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=1992-09-22 | accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schlesinger said, "As of now, I can come to no other conclusion. [But] that does not mean there are any alive today."&lt;ref name="lat092292"/&gt;  Laird said in retrospect of Nixon's assurances that all POWs were coming home, "I think it was unfortunate to be that positive. You can't be that positive when we had the kind of intelligence we had."&lt;ref name="lat092292"/&gt;  In reaction to the testimony, Kerry said, "I think it's quite extraordinary when two former secretaries of defense both give evidence documenting that they had information, or they believed personally, that people were alive and not accounted for in Operation Homecoming."&lt;ref name="lat092292"/&gt;

The committee issued its unanimous findings on January 13, 1993.  In response to the central question of whether any American POWs were still in captivity, it stated:
{{quote|While the Committee has some evidence suggesting the possibility a POW may have survived to the present, and while some information remains yet to be investigated, there is, at this time, no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="report-exec"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/1993_rpt/pow-exec.html | title=Executive Summary | work=Report of the Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs | publisher=[[United States Senate]] | date=1993-01-13 | accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With specific regard to the "some evidence", the committee said this:  "But neither live-sighting reports nor other sources of intelligence have provided grounds for encouragement,[12] particularly over the past decade. The live-sighting reports that have been resolved have not checked out; alleged pictures of POWs have proven false; purported leads have come up empty; and photographic intelligence has been inconclusive, at best."&lt;ref name="report-exec"/&gt;  Two senators, Smith and Grassley, dissented at note 12, with the report saying "they believe that live-sighting reports and other sources of intelligence are evidence that POWs may have survived to the present."&lt;ref name="report-exec"/&gt;

With regard to the possibility that American POWs survived in Southeast Asia after Operation Homecoming, the committee said this:  "We acknowledge that there is no proof that U.S. POWs survived, but neither is there proof that all of those who did not return had died. There is evidence, moreover, that indicates the possibility of survival, at least for a small number, after Operation Homecoming."&lt;ref name="report-exec"/&gt;

Committee vice-chairman Smith seemed to back away from the committee's findings within months of their being issued, appearing in April 1993 on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' with POW/MIA activist [[Bill Hendon]],&lt;ref name="cnn041593"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.geocities.com/pentagon/2527/lklshow.html | title=Transcript #805 | work=[[Larry King Live]] | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=1993-04-15 | accessdate=2008-01-23|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/pentagon/2527/lklshow.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:25:30|archivedate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; stressing his partial dissent from the majority report and touting new evidence of North Vietnam having held back prisoners in 1973,&lt;ref name="cnn041593"/&gt; and then in the Senate in September 1993, saying he had "very compelling" new evidence of live prisoners.&lt;ref name="nyt090893"/&gt; He also asked the Justice Department to investigate ten federal officials for perjury and other crimes in conjunction with a cover-up of POW/MIA investigations,&lt;ref name="nyt090893"/&gt;  In what he dubbed "Operation Clean Sweep", Smith said the targeted officials had a "mind-set to debunk".&lt;ref name="keating-240"&gt;Keating, ''Prisoners of Hope'', p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kerry and McCain both denounced Smith's actions, with McCain saying "In my dealings with these people, it is clear that mistakes may have been made in a very complex set of issues. But at no time was there any indication that they were giving anything but their most dedicated efforts. I frankly don't feel it's appropriate to publicly make these charges without public substantiation."&lt;ref name="nyt090893"/&gt;  Defense Secretary [[Les Aspin]] said the charges were unwarranted.&lt;ref name="keating-240"/&gt;

In 1994, journalist [[Sydney Schanberg]], who had won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] in the 1970s for his ''[[New York Times]]'' reporting in [[Cambodia]], wrote a long article for ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' magazine in which he said the committee had been dominated by a faction led by Kerry that "wanted to appear to be probing the prisoner issue energetically, but in fact, they never rocked official Washington's boat, nor did they lay open the 20 years of secrecy and untruths."&lt;ref name="schan94"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0408,schanberg2,51267,1.html |title=Did America Abandon Vietnam War P.O.W.'s? |author=[[Sydney Schanberg]] |work=[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]] |date=September 1994 |accessdate=2007-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321171551/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0408%2Cschanberg2%2C51267%2C1.html |archivedate=2007-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schanberg stated that key committee staff had had too close a relationship with the Department of Defense, and that while other committee investigators were able to get evidence of men left behind into the full body of the report, the report's conclusions "were watered down and muddied to the point of meaninglessness."&lt;ref name="schan94"/&gt;  Kerry denied that the committee had engaged in any cover-up.&lt;ref name="schan94"/&gt;

The Kerry committee did little to soften the attitudes of those directly involved in the issue.  To skeptics, "live prisoners" remained a [[conspiracy theory]] unsupported by motivation or evidence, and the foundation for a cottage industry of charlatans who preyed upon the hopes of the families of the missing.  As two skeptics wrote in 1995, "The conspiracy myth surrounding the Americans who remained missing after Operation Homecoming in 1973 had evolved to baroque intricacy. By 1992, there were thousands of zealots—who believed with cultlike fervor that hundreds of American POWs had been deliberately and callously abandoned in Indochina after the war, that there was a vast conspiracy within the armed forces and the executive branch—spanning five administrations—to cover up all evidence of this betrayal, and that the governments of Communist Vietnam and Laos continued to hold an unspecified number of living American POWs, despite their adamant denials of this charge."&lt;ref&gt;McConnell and Schweitzer, ''Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Believers continued to strongly reject such notions; as one wrote in 1994, "It is not conspiracy theory, not paranoid myth, not Rambo fantasy. It is only hard evidence of a national disgrace: American prisoners were left behind at the end of the Vietnam War. They were abandoned because six presidents and official Washington could not admit their guilty secret. They were forgotten because the press and most Americans turned away from all things that reminded them of Vietnam."&lt;ref name="schan94"/&gt;

==Normalization with Vietnam==
The actions of the committee were designed to allow for improved ties between the U.S. and Vietnam, for which the unresolved fate of American MIAs had long been a sticking point.&lt;ref name="haass"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Frederick Z. |chapter=The United States and Vietnam: Road to Normalization |editor=[[Richard Haass]], Meghan L. O'Sullivan |title=Honey and Vinegar: Incentives, Sanctions, and Foreign Policy |publisher=[[Brookings Institution Press]] |year=2000 |isbn=0-8157-3356-9}} pp. 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt;  The belief by Americans from a few years earlier that live prisoners still existed had mostly passed; in the words of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, "most people seemed resigned to the idea that the fortunes of war are bound to leave a few mysteries."&lt;ref name="time072495"/&gt;  In 1994 the Senate passed a resolution, sponsored by Kerry and McCain, that called for an end to the existing trade embargo against Vietnam; it was intended to pave the way for normalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E3DC1639F93BA15752C0A962958260 |title=Senate Urges End to U.S. Embargo Against Vietnam |author=Greenhouse, Steven |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1994-01-28 |accessdate=2008-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When President [[Bill Clinton]] lifted the trade embargo on February 3, 1994, he stated:
{{quote|I have made the judgment that the best way to ensure cooperation from Vietnam and to continue getting the information Americans want on POWs and MIAs is to end the trade embargo. I've also decided to establish a liaison office in Vietnam to provide services for Americans there and help us to pursue a human rights dialogue with the Vietnamese government. 
I want to be clear; These actions do not constitute a normalization of our relationships. Before that happens, we must have more progress, more cooperation and more answers. Toward that end, this spring I will send another high-level U.S. delegation to Vietnam to continue the search for remains and for documents.}}

In response, columnist [[Dan Rather]] wrote the following:
{{quote|In an obvious attempt to blunt criticism, President Clinton actually characterized lifting the embargo as creating the best opportunity to get the true story of what happened to America's missing. This was especially ill-advised. Because it was obvious that lifting the embargo wasn't designed to resolve doubts about the fate of the missing. It was designed to make money. It was a trade initiative, plain and simple. The people least likely to mistake it for anything else were the families of America's missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | magazine=[[National Review]] | date=April 4, 1994 | title=Guest Editorial | author=[[Dan Rather]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1995, President [[Bill Clinton]] normalized diplomatic relations with the country of Vietnam,&lt;ref name="time072495"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983202,00.html |title=Good Morning, Vietnam |author=Walsh, James |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1995-07-24 |accessdate=2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; with McCain's and Kerry's visible support during the announcement giving Clinton, who came of age during Vietnam but did not serve in the military, some political cover.&lt;ref name="time072495"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bg062103"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/062103.shtml | title=At the center of power, seeking the summit | series=John Kerry: A Candidate in the Making | author=John Aloysius Farrell | work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=2003-06-21 | accessdate=2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bg012300"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://graphics.boston.com/news/politics/campaign2000/news/A_refining_experience.shtml | title='A refining experience' | author=Farrell, John Aloysius | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=2000-01-23 |accessdate=2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time on the committee and afterward, McCain was vilified as a fraud,&lt;ref name="alex-170"&gt;Alexander, ''Man of the People'', p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; traitor,&lt;ref name="bg062103"/&gt; or "[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|Manchurian Candidate]]"&lt;ref name="time072495"/&gt; by many of the POW/MIA activists who believed in live prisoners.  McCain's high-profile on the Vietnam issue also cost him the friendship of some fellow former POWs;&lt;ref name="timberg-188"&gt;{{cite book | last=Timberg | first=Robert | title=[[John McCain: An American Odyssey]] | publisher=[[Touchstone Books]] | year=1999 | isbn=0-684-86794-X}} pp. 187–189.&lt;/ref&gt;  In return, McCain continued to attack those he saw as profiteers exploiting the families of those missing in action.&lt;ref name="bg012300"/&gt;

In the 1990s, the Joint Task Force–Full Accounting in conjunction with the [[Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command]] was established to focus on achieving the fullest possible accounting of Americans missing from the Vietnam War. It has interviewed thousands of witnesses regarding the fate of missing Americans,&lt;ref name="dpmo-histnew"/&gt; and conducts ten missions per year in Southeast Asia to search for remains of those still listed as missing.

==In the 2000s==
[[File:POWMIAFlagFlying2009.jpg|thumb|right|upright|By the late 2000s, the Vietnam POW/MIA issue had largely faded from view, but the American public still saw the POW/MIA Flag flying at many public facilities.]]
In a 2002 interview, the Cambodia politician [[Pen Sovan]] reported hearing about American POWs from his guards, during his imprisonment in Vietnam, and believed that some had been taken by the Soviet Union.  He said he had spoken to American MIA officials about this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Schanberg returned to the POW/MIA subject during [[John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004|John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign]] in a series of articles for ''[[The Village Voice]]''; he claimed that Kerry had shredded documents, suppressed testimony, and sanitized findings during his time as chairman of the committee.&lt;ref name="villagevoicekerry"&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Sydney Schanberg]] | title =When John Kerry's Courage Went M.I.A. | work =[[The Village Voice]] | date =2004-02-24 | url =http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0408,schanberg,51276,1.html | accessdate = 2007-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kerry denied these allegations and responded overall by saying, "In the end, I think what we can take pride in is that we put together the most significant, most thorough, most exhaustive accounting for missing and former POWs in the history of human warfare."&lt;ref name="villagevoicekerry"/&gt;

In 2007, the former Congressman [[Bill Hendon]] published his book ''An Enormous Crime'', which chronicled his view of the history of American soldiers abandoned in Southeast Asia following the war and the circumstances that left them there.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} A companion website allows readers to examine actual intelligence reports and decide if the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] acted properly in dismissing each case.

A year later, Schanberg again published articles, this time for ''[[The Nation]]'' and [[The Nation Institute]], during [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign]], in which he recapped his previous arguments and additionally claimed that McCain had helped cover up the long suppression of evidence concerning live prisoners.&lt;ref name="nation-schan"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nationinstitute.org/p/schanberg09182008pt1 | title=McCain and the POW Cover-up | author=[[Sydney Schanberg]] | publisher=[[The Nation Institute]] | date=2008-09-18 | accessdate=2008-09-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015013403/http://www.nationinstitute.org/p/schanberg09182008pt1 | archive-date=2008-10-15 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Former Congressman LeBoutillier was also vocal in his opposition to McCain, in part due to McCain's failure to acknowledge what he saw as evidence of live American POWs left behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsmax.com/john_leboutillier/vietnam_pows/2008/09/05/128048.html |title='Enormous Crime' Details POWs Left Behind |publisher=[[NewsMax.com]] |last=LeBoutillier |first=John |date=2008-09-05 |accessdate=2008-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922011852/http://www.newsmax.com/john_leboutillier/vietnam_pows/2008/09/05/128048.html |archivedate=September 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, while the group of activists on the topic still felt very strongly about it, the matter had largely faded from the American public, and McCain's actions with regard to the POW/MIA issue never were a factor in his eventually losing campaign.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

By the late 2000s, the remains of over 700 Americans killed in Southeast Asia had been returned and identified.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==2010s==
The controversy continued to pop up on occasion in the second decade of the twenty-first century. The 2013 Canadian documentary ''[[Unclaimed]]'' told the story of an elderly man in Vietnam claiming to be a U.S. soldier thought killed in action in 1968.

"'''Young fogey'''" is a term humorously applied, in British context, to some younger-generation, rather buttoned-down{{Clarify|date=October 2017}} writers and journalists, such as [[Simon Heffer]], [[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]] and, for a while, [[A. N. Wilson]]. The term is attributed to [[Alan Watkins]] writing in 1984 in ''[[The Spectator]]''.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

"Young [[wikt:fogey|fogey]]" is still used to describe [[Conservatism|conservative]] young men (aged approximately between 15 and 40) who [[vintage clothing|dress in a vintage style]] (usually that of the 1920s-1930s, also known as the "Brideshead" look (after the influence of the [[Evelyn Waugh]] novel ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]''). Young-fogeys tend towards erudite, conservative cultural pursuits, especically art and traditional architecture, rather than sports. The young-fogey style of dress also has some surface similarity with the American [[preppy]] style, but is endogenous to the [[United Kingdom]] and anglo-centric areas of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==History==
The movement reached its peak in the 1980s with champions such as [[A.N. Wilson]], [[Gavin Stamp]] and [[John Martin Robinson]] and a relatively widespread following, but has declined since. Though generally a middle class phenomenon, it had a wider influence on fashions in the 1980s. Young-fogeys are rarely rich or upper class and sometimes make a style virtue of genteel poverty, especially when rescuing old houses.&lt;ref&gt;John Martin Robinson &amp; Alexandra Artley, The New Georgian Handbook. Harpers, London, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; They often combine a conservative cultural outlook with a distate of Conservative political activity. They find [[feminism]] perpexing but are often open to [[bisexuality]] with men; even firmly heterosexual youg-fogeys have [[homosocial]] tendencies.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Often religious, their conservative outlook extends to refuting progressive theology.

Today committed young-fogeys may found amongst students at Oxford, Cambridge, [[Durham University|Durham]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[St Andrews]] universities; and at some universities in the Commonwealth, notably the [[University of Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} Adherents tend to concentrate in some professions: in particular the [[antique]]s and art dealing, residential estate agency, conservative classical [[architecture]] practices and certain strata of the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Anglican]] churches.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Strongholds of young fogeys include the [[Oxford University Conservative Association]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} but they are also seen elsewhere.

==People==
Irish broadcaster [[Ryan Tubridy]], who hosts ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'', has described himself as a "young fogey".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/around-town/i-wont-stay-on-late-late-show-forever-reveals-ryan-1992876.html|title=I won't stay on Late Late Show forever, reveals Ryan - Making plans: Tubridy doesn't see 'dream job' as his final TV gig|first=Caitlin|last=McBride|work=Evening Herald|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media|date=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]] was described as a "young fogey" after [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|his 2010 election to Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1293560/QUENTIN-LETTS-Young-fogey-whos-charmed-Lefties.html|title=Young fogey who's charmed the Lefties|first=Quentin|last=Letts|work=Daily Mail|publisher=Daily Mail and General Trust|date=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British writer, editor, and broadcaster [[Anthony Lejeune]] was described by ''[[The Times]]'' as: "always out of period, a misfit in the modern world for whom the term 'young fogey' might have been invented".&lt;ref name=times&gt;[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/obituary-anthony-lejeune-p7vkl5hcb Anthony Lejeune.] ''The Times'', 26 March 2018.
