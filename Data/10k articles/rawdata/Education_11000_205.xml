In United States legal education, an '''accelerated JD Program''' may refer to one of the following:
* A "3+3 JD program" or "BA to JD program" is a program in which students combine certain requirements of a [[bachelor's degree]] (usually a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) with the requirements of the [[Juris Doctor]] degree.  Students thus usually receive their bachelor's degree after completing the first year of law school. Typically, students complete the two degrees in six years rather than the usual seven. The undergraduate college and law school may either be independent institutions, or part of a single large university.  Accelerated JD programs differ from most [[dual degree]] programs in that the degrees are of different levels, and are obtained sequentially rather than concurrently.  Requirements for admission of undergraduates to such programs are typically higher than for general enrollment.  Some programs further restrict enrollment to students in a specific [[prelaw]] major.
* A "2-year JD program" is a Juris Doctor degree that is offered independently of a bachelor's degree.  Typically, students are required to complete the same number of credit hours as traditional three-year JD students, but in a more condensed period.

''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' stated that as a result of student concerns about the time and cost (both in terms of tuition and the opportunity cost associated with foregoing a salary for three years) required to complete a law degree, there has been an emerging trend to develop accelerated JD programs.&lt;ref name="usnews"&gt;https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/law-admissions-lowdown/2012/01/02/look-for-these-3-law-school-trends-in-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of 2-year accelerated JD programs==

Unless otherwise indicated, all students enter the accelerated JD program at the start of the school's summer term. At Southwestern Law, the summer term starts in June; at the other listed schools, the summer term starts in May.

The May/June start of most accelerated programs is compatible with the bar examination schedule of all U.S. jurisdictions. Bar exams throughout the U.S. take place during the week containing the last Wednesday in July; almost all jurisdictions also offer an exam during the week containing the last Wednesday in February. Washburn's January starting date is compatible with February examinations.

==Family background==

Alfred Freddy Krupa comes from a multiethnic [[Silesians|Silesian]] family of long tradition in visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=what%3Akrupa+alfred&amp;rows=24 Europeana.eu]{{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family appears in archives of the [[International Tracing Service]] as the registered victims of Nazi persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rodoslovlje.hr/istaknuta-vijest/prilozi-citatelja-hildegard-marie-ili-zatvorenica-broj-9772-zrtva-paljenica-obitelji-kruppa|title=Prilozi čitatelja: Hildegard Marie ili zatvorenica broj 9772|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Eupedia&lt;ref&gt;Famous members of haplogroup Q https://www.eupedia.com/europe/Haplogroup_Q_Y-DNA.shtml#famous_people&lt;/ref&gt; Krupa belongs to the rare Ashkenazi branch of [[Haplogroup Q (Y-DNA)|haplogroup Q]] and through that paternal lineage is related to [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], [[Vilna Gaon]], [[Henry Heimlich]], [[Tony Kushner]], [[Anson Williams]], [[Nicky Oppenheimer]], the Piątkowski h. [[Pomian coat of arms|Pomian]] family and other notables.

==Education==

Krupa graduated in 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALU Alumni List|url=http://www.alu.unizg.hr/alu/cms/front_content.php?idcat=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, University of Zagreb]] (est. 1907 as the Royal College for Arts and Crafts (Croatian: Kraljevsko zemaljsko više obrazovalište za umjetnost i umjetni obrt). Krupa also studied Art History (non-degree research) at the [[University of Zagreb]] (1997,1998) and in 1998/99 as the postgraduate research student (The {{nihongo|Monbukagakusho Scholarship|文部科学省奨学金|Monbukagakushō Shōgakukin}}) at the [[Tokyo Gakugei University]] (東京学芸大学) or Gakudai (学大).
In 2005 Krupa finished additional art education study and has been given formal permanent title of "Professor of Drawing and Painting" by the Croatian State Institute for Education (today "Education and Teacher Training Agency"- ETTA/AZOO)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ETTA description|url=http://www.azoo.hr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=1999&amp;Itemid=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artwork==

Krupas work has attracted public and professional attention from the beginning. For the first time his name was introduced to the general public in 1990 at the then mega-popular Yugoslav weekly&lt;ref&gt;Yugoslavia's Sunny Side: A History of Tourism in Socialism (1950s-1980s) https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=74GQBFB8G4MC&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330&amp;dq=vikend+yugoslav+magazine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0hNQlgvX82&amp;sig=LQR5sAIegRYSC_IZaQAKKEHzUSA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6v6CgitbbAhWEFZoKHfyGBOYQ6AEITTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=vikend%20yugoslav%20magazine&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; "Vikend/Weekend"&lt;ref&gt;Yugoslavian magazine "Vikend": Alfred (Freddy) Krupa (1990)  https://issuu.com/alfredfreddykrupa/docs/32785072_10215991405755622_55728895&lt;/ref&gt;. In the same year his first solo exhibition was held&lt;ref&gt;Večernji List (Evening Newspaper): Krupini crteži / Krupas drawings (1990)  https://issuu.com/alfredfreddykrupa/docs/gradska_stra_a&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since early 1990's A.F. Krupa exhibited frequently. His works has been presented on multiple occasions together with artists such as [[Edo_Murtić|Edo Murtić]], [[Miroslav_Šutej|Miroslav Šutej]], [[Ivan_Kožarić|Ivan Kožarić]], [[Marijan_Jevšovar|Marijan Jevšovar]], [[Mersad_Berber|Mersad Berber]], [[Đuro_Seder|Đuro Seder]], [[Ana_Sladetić|Ana Sladetić]], [[Marino_Tartaglia|Marino Tartaglia]], Josip Vaništa&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moma.org/artists/41131?locale=en&lt;/ref&gt;,  [[Vlaho_Bukovac|Vlaho Bukovac]],  [[Bela_Čikoš_Sesija|Bela Čikoš Sesija]], [[Dario_Ortiz_(artist)|Dario Ortiz]], Liu Yi&lt;ref&gt;https://www.widewalls.ch/artist/liu-yi/&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. Artfacts.net Global Artists Historical Ranking (all media) positioned A. F. Krupa around the 2400th place in 1997 based on the international exhibition history, with the similar rank for over 2 decades.&lt;ref&gt;https://artfacts.net/artist/alfred-freddy-krupa/544333&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/alfred.f.krupa/posts/10216336135933661&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hdlu.hr/2016/01/izlozba-skupna-izlozba-od-bukovca-do-dolica-u-centru-cvjetni/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://portal53.hr/treci-petrinjski-salon-grafike-pokupske-graficke-mape/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/iwscroatia/posts/d41d8cd9/583054708553170/&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally  Krupa is known as a painter of portraits, so among other things, he portrayed  Croatian President [[Franjo Tudjman]] (1996) and Rwandan King [[Kigeli V]]. (2013).

Significant / exquisite are his ink paintings, on rice paper using the technique Hakubyou. Krupa also enters into contemporary interpretation of [[Haboku]] (破墨) and Hatsuboku (溌墨)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/h/hakubyou.htm|title=JAANUS / hakubyou 白描|first=Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users|last=System|website=www.aisf.or.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and concentrates on essential and represents a simplified stylistic motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Andreas Beyer, Dr. Bénédicte Savoy, Dr. Wolf Tegethoff (Hrsg.), ALLGEMEINES KÜNSTLERLEXIKON (AKL) Die Bildenden Künstler aller Zeiten und Völker (The visual artists of all times and peoples), band/volume 82 ({{ISBN|9783110231878}}), De Gruyter-Berlin, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

This visible/non-visible choice demonstrates, in effect, the strong productivity of Krupa at the level of deep and [[symbol]]ic significance.&lt;ref&gt;Arte Al Limite ed.83 (Chile) pg. 58-63 https://issuu.com/arteallimite/docs/83_pags&lt;/ref&gt;

His work in [[ink]] is considered to be of vital importance for the global integrity of the Modern ink painting,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/record/3000096094558?query=alfred+freddy+krupa&amp;offset=0 European Library: Monograph Alfred Freddy Krupa] ({{ISBN|9789537167455}}, authors Zvonimir Gerber, Casey Shannon, Ransui Yakata, Višnja Lasić)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cobiss.si/scripts/cobiss?command=SEARCH&amp;lani=en&amp;base=99999&amp;select=OCN=439516392 Virtual Library of Slovenia]&lt;/ref&gt; and he is considered as one of the essential representatives of national and international present-day art, in particular of the New Ink Movement (New Ink Art)&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Modern_European_Ink_Painting&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moderne-kunst.org/footermenu/language/english.html|title=The Institute of Modern Art Nuremberg/Institut für moderne Kunst Nürnberg|access-date=2016-02-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303103714/http://www.moderne-kunst.org/footermenu/language/english.html#|archive-date=2016-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_contemporary_artists&amp;oldid=833437546|title=List of contemporary artists|date=31 March 2018|publisher=|via=Wikipedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Arte Al Limite: Reduction to deepening|url=https://www.arteallimite.com/featured_item/revista-no-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/new-ink-art#!#resultType:masonry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wikiart.org/en/alfred-freddy-krupa&lt;/ref&gt;

In his photographic works Krupa demonstrates the same minimalist approach and philosophy, placing the focus on composition and contrast.&lt;ref&gt;"He switched the painting knowledge into the photo"   https://issuu.com/europeanglobalart/docs/20988828_10213633143880549_81517114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wikiart.org/en/alfred-freddy-krupa/all-works#!#filterName:Media_photography,resultType:masonry&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alliance for Young Artists &amp; Writers''', a 501(c)(3) [[nonprofit organization]] established in 1994, identifies teenagers with exceptional creative talent and brings their remarkable work to a national audience through the Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards. The Alliance partners with nearly 100 Regional Affiliates across the country to provide creative teens with opportunities for recognition, exhibition, publication, and scholarships.

==Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards==
The Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards provide scholarships for teenagers in the United States. The Awards program was created in 1923 by Maurice R. "Robbie" Robinson, founder of [[Scholastic Corporation]], and has been administered by the Alliance for Young Artists &amp; Writers since 1994. Its past award recipients include [[Andy Warhol]], [[Frances Farmer]], [[wikipedia:Hughie_Lee-Smith|Hughie Lee-Smith]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[wikipedia:Charles_Wilbert_White|Charles White]], [[Sylvia Plath]], [[Truman Capote]], [[Richard Avedon]], [[Richard Linklater]], [[Stephen King]], [[John Updike]], [[Ken Burns]], [[Lena Dunham]], [[Paul Chan (artist)|Paul Chan]], [[Kay WalkingStick]], [[Zac Posen]] and [[Joyce Carol Oates]] among many others.

Established to ensure that literary and artistic talent were recognized in schools and communities across the country, the program began as a small writing contest; today, it offers recognition in 29 categories including architecture, sculpture, painting, photography, poetry, dramatic script, fashion, animation, and video games. The Awards are open to all students in grades 7&amp;ndash;12 from public, private, and home schools throughout the U.S. (and its territories), as well as American-run schools abroad and community programs serving eligible student populations.

==National Student Poets Program==
The program links the National Student Poets with audiences and neighborhood resources such as museums and libraries, and other community-anchor institutions and builds upon the Alliance for Young Artists &amp; Writers' long-standing work with educators and creative teens through the prestigious Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards. The Poets’ appointment events are hosted in cooperation with the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, D.C., and held in conjunction with the [[National Book Festival]].

==Jurors==
The selection panels for both regional and national levels of the Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards are composed of artists&lt;ref name="New Yorker"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/03/24/teen-beat-2|title=Tean beat|last=Allen|first=Emma|date=March 24, 2014|website=The New Yorker|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, writers, curators, critics, educators, and professionals from the nation’s leading creative industries&lt;ref name="New Yorker" /&gt;, some of whom are alums of the Scholastic Awards. Notable past jurors include [[Robert Frost]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[David Sedaris]], [[Judy Blume]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Philip-Lorca diCorcia]], [[Mary Ellen Mark]], [[William Saroyan]], [[Sergio Troncoso]], [[Frank McCourt]], [[Kiki Smith]], [[George Plimpton]], [[Esmeralda Santiago]], [[Princess Tatiana von Fürstenberg]], [[Madeleine L’Engle]], [[Faith Ringgold]], [[Billy Collins]], [[Edward Sorel]], Edwidge Danticat, [[Donald Lipski]], Carolyn Forché, [[Ned Vizzini]], and [[Michael Bierut]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25697">The term '''born-digital''' refers to materials that originate in a [[Digital data|digital]] form.&lt;ref name="NDIIPP"&gt;NDIIPP, [http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/swf/activity.swf "Preserving Digital Culture,"] Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to [[digital reformatting]], through which [[analog recording|analog]] materials become [[Digital data|digital]].  It is most often used in relation to [[digital libraries]] and the issues that go along with said organizations, such as [[digital preservation]] and [[intellectual property]].  However, as technologies have advanced and spread, the concept of being born-digital has also been discussed in relation to personal consumer-based sectors, with the rise of [[e-books]] and evolving digital music.  Other terms that might be encountered as synonymous include "natively digital", "digital-first", and "digital-exclusive".&lt;ref name="Lazinger"&gt;Susan S. Lazinger, "Issues of Policy and Practice in Digital Preservation," in ''Digital Libraries: Policy, Planning, and Practice'', ed. Judith Andrews and Derek Law (Burlington: Ashgate, 2004), 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eaton"&gt;Lance Eaton, "Books Born Digital," ''Library Journal'', May 15, 2009, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrepancies in definition==
There exists some inconsistency in defining born-digital materials.  Some believe such materials must exist in digital form exclusively; in other words, if it can be transferred into a physical, analog form, it is not truly born-digital.&lt;ref name="dpc"&gt;[http://www.dpconline.org/advice/preservationhandbook/introduction/definitions-and-concepts "Introduction - Definitions and Concepts,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401184900/http://www.dpconline.org/advice/preservationhandbook/introduction/definitions-and-concepts |date=2012-04-01 }} Digital Preservation Coalition.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, others maintain that while these materials will often not have a subsequent physical counterpart, having one does not bar them from being classified as 'born-digital'.&lt;ref name="NDIIPP" /&gt;  For instance, Mahesh and Mittal identify two types of born-digital content, "exclusive digital" and "digital for print", allowing for a broader base of classification than the former definition provides.&lt;ref name="Mahesh"&gt;G. Mahesh and Rekha Mittal, [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewPDF.jsp?contentType=Article&amp;Filename=html/Output/Published/EmeraldFullTextArticle/Pdf/2630270408.pdf "Digital Content Creation and Copyright Issues,"] ''The Electronic Library'' 27, no 4 (2008), 678.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, it has been pointed out that certain works may incorporate components that are both born-digital and [[digitized]], further blurring the lines between what should and should not be considered 'born-digital.'  For example, a [[digital video]] created may utilize historical film footage that has been converted.&lt;ref name="Friedlander"&gt;Amy Friedlander, "Summary of Findings" in [http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub106/pub106.pdf ''Building a National Strategy for Digital Preservation: Issues in Digital Media Archiving,''] Council on Library and Information Resources and Library of Congress, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to be aware of these discrepancies when thinking about born-digital materials and the effects they have.  However, some universals do exist across these definitions.  All make clear the fact that born-digital media must originate digitally.  Also, they agree that this media must be able to be utilized in a digital form (whether exclusively or otherwise), while they do not have to exist or be used as analog materials.

==Trends==
Easily seen within the area of [[e-books]], publishing houses use the electronic format as "digital appetizers" within "prepublication digital giveaways".  Often they offer the digital formats at a reduced cost to the printed versions or else produce "digital-exclusive publications" for use on e-book readers, such as the [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]].  One example of this was with the simultaneous launch of Amazon's [[Kindle 2]] with the Stephen King novelette ''Ur''.&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, Lance. "Books born digital: The emerging phenomenon of books published first in digital format." Library Journal. 134. 9 (May 15, 2009)pg.26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

The following provides a list and examples of media that are considered to be common born-digital media:

===Things that have always been 'born-digital'===
These are examples of media that originated in the [[Computer network|networked]] world, therefore existing as born-digital since inception.
*''[[Websites]]'', ''forums'', ''communities'', ''[[wikis]]''.  Anything that was or has been created in a digital environment.

===Things that have migrated/are migrating toward 'born-digital'===
These forms have been created, shared and used independently of or prior to the use of computers, however they are increasingly using a digital format, resulting in separate born-digital creations.
*''[[E-books]]'', which are any electronic files on digital displays.&lt;ref&gt;Romano, Frank. "E-Books and the Challenge of Preservation." Building a National Strategy for Digital Preservation: Issues in Digital Media Archiving. April 2002. Pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Newspapers'' online,
*''Photographs'',
*''Web Exhibits'', including historical exhibits. These often use both primary and secondary historical sources, maps, timelines, infographics, and other data visualizations to showcase the historical past. Some are interactive. One example is [https://www.cliohistory.org/ '''Clio Visualizing History''']'s ''[https://www.cliohistory.org/click/ '''Click! The Ongoing Feminist Revolution''']'', a web exhibit about the American women's movement from the 1940s to the present. Clio Visualizing History was founded by [[Lola Van Wagenen]] in 1996 to meet the growing need for innovative history projects in multi-media platforms.  
*''[[Webcomics]]'' are disseminated online, and are considered to be "born-digital".  Webcomics follow the tradition of user-generated content and may later be printed by the creator, but as they were originally chosen to be disseminated through the internet, they are considered to be "born-digital" media.
*''Internet disseminated TV shows'' (these are specifically shown exclusively on the internet, not reruns available online).  Examples of these include full-length internet shows, such as ''[[The Guild (web series)|The Guild]]'', as well as shorts, which are either user-generated content or used as promotional material by industries. ''The Guild'' is mentioned specifically because it has a series based format much like shows that exist on television do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.watchtheguild.com/# |title=The Guild - a web series about gamers |access-date=2018-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914054022/http://www.watchtheguild.com/# |archive-date=2007-09-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One series that has been distributed online includes ''[[Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog]]'' which has gotten a lot of media attention for the internet-available decision. Recently, ''Dr. Horrible'' has gotten further attention through winning an [[Emmy]] for short-format live action entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scifiwire.com/2009/09/dr-horrible-wins-first-em.php Dr. Horrible wins first Emmy for Joss Whedon] Blastr, September 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Electronic records'' are the products of the vast amount of information created by organizations and individuals on computers.  Examples are [[e-mail]], word-processed documents, and electronic spreadsheets.  As records, they must exist in the context of other activities.&lt;ref name="Thibodeau"&gt;Kenneth Thilbodeau, [http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february01/thibodeau/02thibodeau.html "Building the Archives of the Future,"] ''D-Lib Magazine'' 7, no. 2 (February 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  They have become increasingly important in the government setting, as more and more communication in the technological age done digitally and laws in various countries require that this information be preserved.&lt;ref name="Barata 63"&gt;Kimberly Barata, "Archives in the Digital Age," ''Journal of the Society of Archivists''25, no. 1 (2004), 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Electronic medical records]] are also seeing heavy adoption.
*''Digital sound recordings'': the digital nature of sound recordings is not a new phenomenon; it has played a role since the 1970s with the acceptance of [[pulse-code modulation]] (PCM) in the recording process.&lt;ref name="Brylawski 53"&gt;Samuel Brylawski, "Preservation of Digitally Recorded Sound" in [http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub106/pub106.pdf ''Building a National Strategy for Digital Preservation: Issues in Digital Media Archiving,''] Council on Library and Information Resources and Library of Congress, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then it has become the fundamental way that sound is recorded and delivered.  A number of means of storing and delivering digital audio have developed, including [[streaming media|web streams]], [[compact discs]] and [[mp3]] audio files.&lt;ref name="Brylawski 53" /&gt;  Increasingly, more and more digital audio has become available as '[[download]] only,' lacking any kind of tangible counterpart.  One example of this trend is the "notable" 2008 recording of Hector Berlioz's ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'' by Los Angeles Philharmonic under Gustavo Dudamel.&lt;ref name="Hoek 55"&gt;D.J. Hoek, "The Download Dilemma," ''American Libraries'' (August/September 2009), 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  Available through downloading only, it has presented problems for [[libraries]] which may want to carry this work but cannot due to [[licensing]] limitations.&lt;ref name="Hoek 55" /&gt;  Another example, this one more commercial, is Radiohead's 2007 release ''[[In Rainbows]]'', released initially as a digital download only; however it addressed this issue of access, as the recording was released physically later in the year.

==Etymology==
The term "borndigital" is of uncertain origin. While it may have occurred to multiple people at various times, it was coined independently by web developer Randel (Rafi) Metz in 1993, who acquired the domain name "borndigital.com" then and sustained it as a personal website for 18 years until 2011. The domain is now owned by a web developer in New Zealand. The original borndigital website is [http://www.rafimetz.com/borndigital/ archived here].

==Implications of born-digital content==
There are many issues that accompany the rise in born-digital material over the years, speaking particularly to their format and quantity.  All of these issues affect digital content in general, but are magnified for born-digital content as it often only exists digitally and it is constantly being created in this very unstable environment.

===Digital preservation===
{{main|Digital preservation}}
[[Digital preservation]] involves the many activities necessary to enable continuous access to digital content.  These activities include "collection, description, migration, and redundant storage".&lt;ref name="International 5"&gt;NDIIPP et al., [http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/library/resources/pubs/docs/digital_preservation_final_report2008.pdf "International Study on the Impact of Copyright Law on Digital Preservation,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229074708/http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/library/resources/pubs/docs/digital_preservation_final_report2008.pdf |date=2009-12-29 }} 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Born-digital materials present certain difficulties in this mission.  As with other [[digital object]]s, preservation must be a continuous and regular undertaking, as these materials do not show the same kinds of advanced warning signs of degradation that print and certain other physical materials do.  Invisible processes such as [[data degradation|bit rot]] can lead to irreparable damage.&lt;ref name="International 5" /&gt;  In other cases, such as on the [[World Wide Web|Web]], born-digital content is particularly [[ephemeral]] and changes, or even disappears, very quickly; lapses in preservation can cause these materials to escape forever.&lt;ref name="Lyman 39"&gt;Peter Lyman, "Archiving the World Wide Web" in [http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub106/pub106.pdf ''Building a National Strategy for Digital Preservation: Issues in Digital Media Archiving''], Council on Library and Information Resources and Library of Congress, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those preserving digital materials also have to worry about changing [[technologies]] and the risk of [[digital obsolescence]].

Many questions arise regarding what should be archived and preserved and who should undertake the job.  Vast amounts of born-digital content are created constantly and institutions are forced to decide what and how much should be saved.  Because [[hyperlink|linking]] plays such a large role in the digital setting, on the Web, in [[wikis]] and [[blogs]], in electronic journals, and beyond, whether a responsibility exists to maintain access to [[hyperlink|links]] (and therefore context) is debated, especially when considering the scope of such a task.&lt;ref name="Lyman 41"&gt;Lyman, "World Wide Web," 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, since publishing is not as delineated in the digital realm and preliminary versions of work are increasingly made available, knowing when to archive presents further complications.&lt;ref name="Danner 601"&gt;Richard A. Danner, [http://www.aallnet.org/products/pub_llj_v96n04/2004-38.pdf "Issues in the Preservation of Born-digital Scholarly Communications in Law,"] ''Law Library Journal'' 96, no. 4 (2004), 601.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual property===
In developing collections and making born-digital content available, [[library|libraries]] have had to deal with complex [[intellectual property]] issues.  Laws internationally dealing with the rights regarding works were created to deal with [[analog recording|analog]] works; as such, provisions such as the [[first-sale doctrine]] of [[US copyright law]], which enables libraries to lend materials to patrons, have not been applied to the digital realm.&lt;ref name="International 154"&gt;NDIIPP et al., "International," 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lyman 44"&gt;Lyman, "World Wide Web," 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, certain [[copyright]]ed digital content that is [[licensed]] rather than owned, as is common with many digital materials, is often of limited use since it cannot be transmitted to patrons at various [[computer]]s or lent through an [[interloan]] agreement.  Also, works can easily be damaged due to viruses or system problems, while licenses and [[encryption]] often prevent the ability to copy, necessary to protect a purchase and prevent obstruction of access.  Lack of [[ownership]] also leaves libraries with nothing when their license expires, despite the costs already paid.&lt;ref name="Calaba 23-5"&gt;Victor F. Calaba, [http://www.mttlr.org/volnine/calaba.pdf "Quibbles 'n Bits: Making a Digital First Sale Doctrine Feasible,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706023932/http://www.mttlr.org/volnine/calaba.pdf |date=2010-07-06 }} ''Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review'' 9, no. 1 (2002), 23-5&lt;/ref&gt;  These problems have generally gone unsolved, with people still working toward solutions.  However, with regards to the [[preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] functions of libraries and [[archives]] and the subsequent need to make copies of born-digital materials, the laws of many countries have been changing, allowing for agreements to be made between these institutions and the rights holders of born-digital content.&lt;ref name="International 154"/&gt;

However, [[consumer]]s have also had to deal with [[intellectual property]] as it concerns their ownership of and ability to control the born-digital material that they buy.  [[Copyright infringement|Piracy]] proves to be a bigger problem with digital objects, including those that are born-digital, because such materials can be copied and spread in perfect condition with speed and distance on a scale inconceivable for traditional print and physical materials.&lt;ref name="Calaba 8"&gt;Calaba, "Quibbles," 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Again, the [[first-sale doctrine]], which, from a consumer standpoint, allows purchasers of materials to sell or give away items (such as [[books]] and [[Compact disc|CDs]]), is not yet applied effectively to digital objects. Three reasons for this have been identified by Victor Calaba: "...first, license agreements imposed by software manufacturers typically prohibit exercise of the first sale doctrine; second, traditional copyright law may not support application of the first sale doctrine to digital works; finally, the {{bracket|[[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]}} functionally prevents users from making copies of [[digitized]] works and prohibits the necessary bypassing of access control mechanisms to facilitate a transfer."&lt;ref name="Calaba 9"&gt;Calaba, "Quibbles," 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on industries===
As more commercial items have moved toward becoming born-digital, the face of certain [[industries]] has begun to change and adapt.  Some of the most affected are in relation to [[books]], [[periodicals]], and [[music]].  The [[e-book]] sector of the book industry has flourished in recent years, with increasing numbers of e-books and e-book readers being developed and sold, and rising numbers of books being born-digital.  Giving in to this trend, some [[publishing houses]], including major ones such as [[Harlequin Enterprises|Harlequin]], have formed [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s for digital-only books.&lt;ref name="Weinman"&gt;Sarah Weinman, [http://www.dailyfinance.com/2009/11/10/harlequin-launches-digital-only-imprint-will-other-big-houses-f/ "Harlequin launches digital-only imprint. Will other big houses feel the romance?"] ''Daily Finance'', (November 10, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Publishers]] who adopt these digital imprints see opportunities to save costs on things such as printing.  However, this [[e-publishing]] also gives [[authors]] more independence from their publishers, because the digital marketplace creates a more direct connection between authors, their works, and the audience.&lt;ref name="Romano 31"&gt;Romano, "E-Books," 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Similarly, [[academic journal|journal]] publishers have seen advantages to born-digital publications.  Increasingly institutions are more interested in [[subscription business model|subscribing]] to digital versions of journals, something observed as some scholarly journals have unbundled their print and electronic editions and allowed for separate subscription; these trends have created questions about how economically sustainable production of print versions is.  Already, some major journals such as that of the [[American Chemical Society]] have made significant changes to their print editions in order to cut costs, and many see a move toward exclusively digital journals as on the horizon.&lt;ref name="Timmer"&gt;John Timmer, [https://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/08/publisher-were-somewhere-on-the-road-to-pure-digital.ars "Print, beware! Publishers are "on the road" to pure digital,"] ''Ars Technica'' (August 13, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  These trends have spilled over into the [[magazine]] industry as well.  [[PC Magazine]] went "100% digital" in early 2009, explaining "...that the ever-growing expense of print and delivery was turning the creation of a physical product into an untenable business proposition".&lt;ref name="pcmag"&gt;Lance Ulanoff, [https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2335009,00.asp "PC Magazine Goes 100% Digital: An Open letter to PC Magazine (Print) Readers,"] PC Magazine (November 19, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[music industry]] has changed dramatically with the increase in digital music, specifically [[Music download|digital downloads]].  There has been a dramatic increase in download activity in the new millennium, signaling changes in buying habits.  The digital format and consumers' growing comfort with it has led to rising sales in [[single (music)|single tracks]]. This growth is clearly still underway, with all of the ten best-selling singles since 2000 having been released since 2007.&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2009-12-08-musicdecade08_TB_N.htm "What Musical Artists are Winning in this Digital Decade?"] ''USA Today'' (December 8, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  This does not necessarily signal the demise of CDs, as they are still more popular than digital [[albums]], but it does show that this changing born-digital content is having a significant influence on sales and the industry.&lt;ref name="USAT" /&gt;

The '''Budapest Semesters in Mathematics''' program is a study abroad opportunity for North American undergraduate students in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]].  The coursework is primarily mathematical and conducted in English by Hungarian professors whose primary positions are at [[Eötvös Loránd University]] or the [[Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics]] of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].  Originally started by  [[László Lovász]], [[László Babai]], [[Vera Sós]], and [[Pál Erdős]], the first semester was conducted in Spring 1985.  The North- American part of the program is currently run by Tina Garrett (North American Director) out of [[St. Olaf College]] in [[Northfield, MN]].  She is supported by Kendra Killpatrick (Associate Director) and Eileen Shimota (Program Administrator). The former North American Directors were [[Paul D. Humke]] (1988&amp;ndash;2011) and Tom Trotter. The Hungarian director is  [[Dezső Miklós]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6558">'''Careers advisory services''' in the UK are typically organisations that offer advice, guidance and counselling on careers. People may use these services for a number of purposes, such as jobhunting, changing careers, getting a promotion, building career skills, returning to work after a career break and professional development. [[Career]] challenges such as these occur for many reasons, including redundancy, motherhood, leaving full-time education, relocation, or simply coming to the end of a work contract.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Houghton Finding Square Holes: Discover Who You Really Are and Find the Perfect Career&lt;/ref&gt; 

These services usually employ professional career counsellors, coaches and guides to mentor their clients. In the UK, such professionals might have qualifications from institutes such as the [[Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development]] (CIPD), International Coach Federation (ICF) and the [[British Psychology Society]] (BPS). The [[Global Career Development Facilitator]] is an international certificate held by about 17.500 people (2010) in the United States, Canada, Japan, China, Taiwan, Germany, Romania, Turkey, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cce-global.org/GCDF&lt;/ref&gt;

The Educational and Vocational Guidance Practitioner (EVGP) is a credential of the International Association for Educational and Vocational Guidance (IAEVG) based on competency inventory. The EVGP is administered and awarded on behalf of the IAEVG by the Center of Credentialing and Education in Greensboro, North Carolina, in the United States, which is an affiliate subsidiary of the American National Board of Certified Counselors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cce-global.org/EVGP |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502190405/http://www.cce-global.org/EVGP |archivedate=2015-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One of the earliest examples of a governmental careers advisory service in the UK came as a result of The Education (Choice of Employment) Act (1910). This gave local education authorities the opportunity to advise juveniles on getting work. Each education authority had an officer who was assigned the specific role of advising juveniles in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;Ed. David Peck Careers Services: History, Policy and Practice in the United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of careers advisory services==
The UK government’s careers advisory service is called [https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/Pages/Home.aspx The National Careers Service]. Most UK universities also have their own in-house careers advisory services for students and alumni. A number of corporate entities also have in-house careers advisory services for their employees. There are privately owned, independent careers advisory services throughout the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Watts et al: Rethinking Careers Education and Guidance: Theory Policy and Practice&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accessing careers advisory services==
Traditionally, clients of careers advisory services have met up with their [[career guide]]/counsellor/coach face-to-face to work through their career challenges. Nowadays, however, careers advisory services may offer remote channels of communication such as careers telephone lines and online tools.&lt;ref&gt;AG Watts &amp; Gareth Dent "Let your Fingers do the Walking": the Use of Telephone Helplines in Career Information and Guidance, {{cite web |url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/wg/LetYourFingersDoTheWalking.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040710120052/http://www.gla.ac.uk/wg/LetYourFingersDoTheWalking.pdf |archivedate=2004-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now private companies that are offering subscription-based online careers information, advice and guidance to schools across the UK. Some careers advisory services also go out into the community by running seminars and workshops.

==Methods and tools==
Careers advisory services adopt many different techniques and tools to assist their clients. They include such things as: diagnostic tests and questionnaires; personality assessments; CV writing workshops; [[mock interview]]s;'career drivers' questionnaires and visionboards. An established career coaching technique used by many careers advisers is a combination of the [[GROW_model|GROW]] model and the 'solution-focused' methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Erik de Haan &amp; Yvonne Burger: Coaching with colleagues: an action guide to one-to-one learning&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell, B; Palmer, S. (2003), Introduction to the Solution-Focused Approach, Sage. London&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards and guidelines==
In the UK, careers advisory services must adhere to British Guidance Council Quality Standards by meeting criteria consisting of several detailed competencies. The performance of staff within these services is also keenly observed by these standards. Further standards and guidelines concentrate on quality of informational material, such as books, manuals and commercial PDFs, as well as learning and delivery outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Plant: Quality in Careers Guidance, http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/35/47/2698228.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
People in the Republic of Ireland can find careers advisory services through organisations such as the FAS-Irish National Training and Employment Authority. In Northern Ireland, careers guidance services are delivered by the Northern Ireland Careers Service and Educational Guidance Service for Adults.

The [[Banque de France]] has announced the opening of the '''Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie''' during a press conference held by Governor [[Christian Noyer]], on May 25, 2011. Its opening is programmed for the end of 2014.

This educational place aims at explaining the economy and its concepts to the general public; it will be hosted in the [[Hotel Gaillard]], located at 1, Place du General Catroux, in the 17th district in [[Paris]].

==The project==

[[File:Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.jpg|thumb|alt=Grand lobby of the future Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie|Grand Lobby of the future Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie, architectural and museographic contest, 2011.]]

This place will invite the general public to discover economics, to tackle issues often met in everyday life, or to allow a better understanding of worldwide events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citedeleconomie.fr/IMG/pdf/Discours_C_Noyer_conf_presse_2505.pdf Banque de France Governor Christian Noyer's speech]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Press conference, May 25th, 2011 : Launching of the Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie project&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie will inter alia address teachers and their students, to help illustrate concepts studied at school (indeed half of the 100 000 annual visitors expected should be of school age).&lt;ref&gt;Banque de France press release [http://www.banque-france.fr/fr/instit/communiques/2011/cite-economie-monnaie.htm "''Un grand projet pour un lieu unique : Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie'']", May 25th, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is launched by the [[Banque de France]], which collaborates with several partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banque-france.fr/fr/instit/telechar/communiques/dossier-presse-CEM.pdf Press kit: Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.]&lt;/ref&gt; Among those partners:

* The [[Ministry of National Education (France)]] supports the project and has delegated several teachers to help on the content of the Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.
* The museums of other Central Banks which already exist, like those of the [[European Union]] or the [[Interactive Museum of Economics]] (MIDE), in Mexico.
* Universcience, and especially the [[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie]] : [[Christian Noyer]], Governor of the [[Banque de France]], and [[Claudie Haigneré]], head of Universcience, have signed a cooperation agreement on the museography of the future Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.
* The ''Institut pour l'Education Financière du Public'', with whom a partnership has been concluded in late 2010.
* The [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]](BnF) : Governor [[Christian Noyer]] and President of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] [[Bruno Racine]] have signed a cooperation agreement on January 3, 2012, regarding the presentation of coin and banknote collections in the future Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.
* The Rencontres des SES : initiative developed by the [[:fr:Académie de Paris|Académie de Paris]], where 11th grade students studying Economics and Social Sciences are invited to meet economists, in order to discuss themes linked to current issues.
* The Little Conferences of the [[:fr:Nouveau Théâtre de Montreuil|Nouveau Théâtre de Montreuil]] : a partnership with the Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie was announced on February 11, 2012, during [[Jean-Claude Trichet]] (former [[Banque de France]] Governor and former President of the [[European Central Bank]])'s conference on the history of money. The partnership is developed around their shared objective of increasing young people's access to knowledge.

==The building==

The Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie will be hosted in the [[Hotel Gaillard]], located at 1, Place du Général Catroux, in the 17th district in [[Paris]].

This neo-gothic mansion has been realized by architect Jules Février at request of Emile Gaillard, banker from the city of [[Grenoble]] and amateur and collector of [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]] art. The [[Hotel Gaillard]] was sold to the [[Banque de France]] in 1919.

From 1919 to 1921, architectural works have been directed by architect Alphonse Defrasse for the [[Banque de France]], especially the building of a steel structure which housed the cashier's desks and other services to the visitors. He also imagined the impressive strong room which could be accessed by a lift bridge, over two-meters-deep moats.&lt;ref&gt;Historical study on the Hotel Gaillard, led by the ''Groupe de Recherche Art Histoire Architecture et Littérature'' (GRAHAL), on request of the Banque de France.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hôtel Gaillard - Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie - travaux Grand Hall 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Grand Lobby construction|Grand Lobby construction works, conceived by the architect Alphonse Defrasse, 1921]]

Listed as a historic monument in 1999, this branch closed in 2006, as a consequence of the plan to close half of the [[Banque de France]]'s branches on the French territory.

==The architectural contest==

[[File:Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie-salle du conseil.jpg|thumb|alt=boardroom of the future Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie|Boardroom of the future Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie, architectural and museographic contest, 2011]]

The project of the Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie was the object of an architectural contest. Over 100 teams of architects and museographers have participated in this contest which aimed at transforming this former branch of the Banque de France in an educational Cité, while respecting the architecture of the building which is listed as historic monument.

The team of architects – museographers was selected by the [[Banque de France]] amongst the six final projects chosen by the jury of the contest. The team is made of Ateliers Lion for the architecture, François Confino for the museography, and Eric Pallot as architect in charge of historic monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banque-france.fr/fr/instit/telechar/communiques/dossier-presse-CEM.pdf Press kit: Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cooperative learning''' is an educational approach which aims to organize classroom activities into academic and social learning experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillies|first=Robyn|date=2016|title=Cooperative Learning: Review of Research and Practice|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1096789.pdf|journal=Australian Journal of Teacher Education|volume=41|pages=39–51|via=eric.ed.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is much more to cooperative learning than merely arranging students into groups, and it has been described as "structuring positive interdependence."&lt;ref name="Team Game tounament"&gt;{{cite web|title = Team Game tournament|url = http://download.portalgaruda.org/article.php?article=97564&amp;val=613|ref = article}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.utschools.ca/utseducation/academicdepartments/science/tgt-nabt_06_2.pdf|title = Team-Games-Tournament:Cooperative Learning and Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students must work in groups to complete tasks collectively toward academic goals. Unlike individual learning, which can be competitive in nature, students learning cooperatively can capitalize on one another's resources and skills (asking one another for information, evaluating one another's ideas, monitoring one another's work, etc.).&lt;ref name="prezi.com"&gt;{{cite web|title = Team game Tournament: Cooperative learning and review|url = https://prezi.com/kn2ooa6sjef_/teams-games-and-tournaments/|ref = ppt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chiu"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chiu | first1 = M.

Five essential elements are identified for the successful incorporation of cooperative learning in the classroom:&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. W., Johnson, R. T., &amp; Holubec, E. J. (1994). The nuts and bolts of cooperative learning. ^ eMinnesota Minnesota: Interaction Book Company.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[positive interdependence]]
* individual and group accountability
* promotive interaction (face to face)
* teaching the students the required interpersonal and small group skills
* group processing.
According to Johnson and Johnson's [[meta-analysis]], students in cooperative learning settings compared to those in individualistic or competitive learning settings, achieve more, reason better, gain higher [[self-esteem]], like classmates and the learning tasks more and have more perceived [[social support]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=D.W.|title=An Educational Psychology Success Story: Social Interdependence Theory and Cooperative Learning|journal=Educational Researcher|date=2009|volume=38|issue=5|pages=365–379|doi=10.3102/0013189x09339057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Prior to World War II, social theorists such as Allport, Watson, Shaw, and Mead began establishing cooperative learning theory after finding that group work was more effective and efficient in quantity, quality, and overall productivity when compared to working alone.&lt;ref name="Gilles"&gt;Gilles, R.M., &amp; Adrian, F. (2003). Cooperative Learning: The social and intellectual Outcomes of Learning in Groups. London: Farmer Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it wasn't until 1937 when researchers May and Doob&lt;ref name="MayDoob"&gt;May, M. and Doob, L. (1937). Cooperation and Competition. New York: Social Sciences Research Council&lt;/ref&gt; found that people who cooperate and work together to achieve shared goals, were more successful in attaining outcomes, than those who strived independently to complete the same goals. Furthermore, they found that independent achievers had a greater likelihood of displaying competitive behaviours.

Philosophers and psychologists in the 1930s and 1940s such as [[John Dewey]], [[Kurt Lewin]], and Morton Deutsh also influenced the cooperative learning theory practiced today.&lt;ref name="Sharan"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharan | first1 = Y | year = 2010 | title = Cooperative Learning for Academic and Social Gains: valued pedagogy, problematic practice | url = | journal = European Journal of Education | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 300–313 | doi=10.1111/j.1465-3435.2010.01430.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey believed it was important that students develop knowledge and social skills that could be used outside of the classroom, and in the democratic society. This theory portrayed students as active recipients of knowledge by discussing information and answers in groups, engaging in the learning process together rather than being passive receivers of information (e.g., teacher talking, students listening).

Lewin's contributions to cooperative learning were based on the ideas of establishing relationships between group members in order to successfully carry out and achieve the learning goal. Deutsh's contribution to cooperative learning was [[positive interdependence|positive social interdependence]], the idea that the student is responsible for contributing to group knowledge.&lt;ref name="Sharan" /&gt;

Since then, David and Roger Johnson have been actively contributing to the cooperative learning theory. In 1975, they identified that cooperative learning promoted mutual liking, better communication, high acceptance and support, as well as demonstrated an increase in a variety of thinking strategies among individuals in the group.&lt;ref name="Johnson 1975"&gt;Johnson, D., Johnson, R. (1975). Learning together and alone, cooperation, competition, and individualization. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Students who showed to be more competitive lacked in their interaction and trust with others, as well as in their emotional involvement with other students.

In 1994 Johnson and Johnson published the 5 elements (positive interdependence, individual accountability, face-to-face interaction, social skills, and processing) essential for effective group learning, achievement, and higher-order social, personal and cognitive skills (e.g., problem solving, reasoning, decision-making, planning, organizing, and reflecting).&lt;ref name="Johnson 1994"&gt;Johnson, D., Johnson, R. (1994). Learning together and alone, cooperative, competitive, and individualistic learning. Needham Heights, MA: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical base ==
Social [[interdependence theory]]: Social interdependence exists when the outcomes of individuals are affected by their own and others' actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=D.W.|title=Cooperation and competition: Theory and Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of social interdependence: positive (when the actions of individuals promote the achievement of joint goals) and negative (when the actions of individuals obstruct the achievement of each other's goals). Social interdependence may be differentiated from social dependence, independence, and helplessness. Social dependence exists when the goal achievement of Person A is affected by Person B's actions, but the reverse is not true. Social independence exists when the goal achievement of Person A is unaffected by Person B's actions and vice versa. Social helplessness exists when neither the person nor other can influence goal achievement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Kurt Lewin proposed that the essence of a group is the interdependence among members that results in the group being a dynamic whole so that a change in the state of any member or subgroup changes the state of any other member or subgroup. Group members are made interdependent through common goals. As members perceive their common goals, a state of tension arises that motivates movement toward the accomplishment of the goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewin|first1=Kurt|title=A dynamic theory of personality|publisher=New York: McGraw-Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewin|first1=Kurt|title=Resolving social conflicts|publisher=New York: Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton Deutsch extended Lewin's notions by examining how the tension systems of different people may be interrelated. He conceptualized two types of social interdependence—positive and negative. Positive interdependence exists when there is a positive correlation among individuals' goal attainments; individuals perceive that they can attain their goal if and only if the other individuals with whom they are cooperatively linked attain their goals. Positive interdependence results in promotive interaction. Negative interdependence exists when there is a negative correlation among individuals' goal achievements; individual perceive that they can obtain their goals if and only if the other individuals with whom they are competitively like fail to obtain their goals. Negative interdependence results in oppositional or content interaction. No interdependence exists when there is no correlation among individuals' goal achievements; individuals perceive that the achievement of their goals is unrelated to the goal achievement of others. The basic premise of social interdependence theory is that how participants' goals are structured determines the ways they interact and the interaction pattern determine the outcomes of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deutsch|first1=Morton|title=A theory of cooperation and competition|journal=Human Relations|date=1949|volume=2|pages=129–152|doi=10.1177/001872674900200204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deutsch|first1=Morton|title=Cooperation and trust: Some theoretical notes|date=1962|publisher=Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press|pages=275–319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
[[Introduction to Cooperative Learning#Formal|Formal cooperative learning]] is structured, facilitated, and monitored by the educator over time and is used to achieve group goals in task work (e.g. completing a unit). Any course material or assignment can be adapted to this type of learning, and groups can vary from 2-6 people with discussions lasting from a few minutes up to an entire period. Types of formal cooperative learning strategies include:
# [[Jigsaw (teaching technique)|The jigsaw technique]]
# Assignments that involve [[Group-dynamic game|group problem-solving]] and decision making
# Laboratory or experiment assignments
# Peer review work (e.g. editing writing assignments).
Having experience and developing skill with this type of learning often facilitates informal and base learning.&lt;ref name="JJH"&gt;Johnson, D., Johnson, R., &amp; Holubec, E. (1988). Advanced Cooperative Learning. Edin, MN: Interaction Book Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Jigsaw activities are wonderful because the student assumes the role of the teacher on a given topic and is in charge of teaching the topic to a classmate. The idea is that if students can teach something, they have already learned the material.

[[Introduction to cooperative learning#informal|Informal cooperative learning]] incorporates group learning with passive teaching by drawing attention to material through small groups throughout the lesson or by discussion at the end of a lesson, and typically involves groups of two (e.g. turn-to-your-partner discussions). These groups are often temporary and can change from lesson to lesson (very much unlike formal learning where 2 students may be lab partners throughout the entire semester contributing to one another's knowledge of science).

Discussions typically have four components that include formulating a response to questions asked by the educator, sharing responses to the questions asked with a partner, listening to a partner's responses to the same question, and creating a new well-developed answer. This type of learning enables the student to process, consolidate, and retain more information.&lt;ref name="JJH" /&gt;

In group-based cooperative learning, these peer groups gather together over the long term (e.g. over the course of a year, or several years such as in high school or post-secondary studies) to develop and contribute to one another's knowledge mastery on a topic by regularly discussing material, encouraging one another, and supporting the academic and personal success of group members.

[[Base group learning]] (e.g., a long term study group) is effective for learning complex subject matter over the course or semester and establishes caring, supportive peer relationships, which in turn motivates and strengthens the student's commitment to the group's education while increasing self-esteem and self-worth. Base group approaches also make the students accountable to educating their peer group in the event that a member was absent for a lesson. This is effective both for individual learning, as well as social support.

== Elements ==
Johnson and Johnson (2009) posited five variables that mediate the effectiveness of cooperation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Brown &amp; Ciuffetelli Parker (2009) and Siltala (2010) discuss the ''5 basic and essential elements'' to cooperative learning:&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, H., &amp; Ciuffetelli, D.C. (Eds.). (2009). Foundational methods: Understanding teaching and learning. Toronto: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Siltala"&gt;Siltala, R. (2010). Innovativity and cooperative learning in business life and teaching. University of Turku.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siltala, R., Suomala, J., Taatila, V. &amp; Keskinen, S. (2007). Cooperative Learning in Finland and in California during the innovation process. In Andriessen D. (Eds.) (2007). Intellectual Capital. Haarlem: Inholland University.&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Positive interdependence]]
## Students must fully participate and put forth effort within their group
## Each group member has a task/role/responsibility therefore must believe that they are responsible for their learning and that of their group
# Face-to-face promotive interaction
## Members promote each other's success
## Students explain to one another what they have or are learning and assist one another with understanding and completion of assignments
# Individual and group accountability
## Each student must demonstrate mastery of the content being studied
## Each student is accountable for their learning and work, therefore eliminating "[[social loafing]]"
# Social skills
## Social skills that must be taught in order for successful cooperative learning to occur
## Skills include effective communication, interpersonal and group skills
### Leadership
### Decision-making
### Trust-building
### Friendship- development
### Communication
### Conflict-management skills
# Group processing
## Group processing occurs when group members (a) reflect on which member actions were helpful and (b) make decision about which actions to continue or change. 
## The purpose of group processing is to clarify and improve the effectiveness with which members carry out the processes necessary to achieve the group's goals.

In order for student achievement to improve considerably, two characteristics must be present:&lt;ref name="Brown 507"&gt;Brown, H., &amp; Ciuffetelli, D.C. (Eds.). (2009). Foundational methods: Understanding teaching and learning, p. 507. Toronto: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt;
# When designing cooperative learning tasks and reward structures, individual responsibility and accountability must be identified. Individuals must know exactly what their responsibilities are and that they are accountable to the group in order to reach their goal.
# All group members must be involved in order for the group to complete the task. In order for this to occur each member must have a task that they are responsible for which cannot be completed by any other group member.

There are a great number of cooperative learning techniques available. Some cooperative learning techniques utilize student pairing, while others utilize small groups of four or five students. Hundreds of techniques have been created into structures to use in any content area.&lt;ref&gt;Kagan,S. 1994. Kagan cooperative learning. 2nd ed. San Clemente, CA: Kagan Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the easy to implement structures are think-pair-share, think-pair-write, variations of [[Round Robin (teaching technique)|Round Robin]], and the [[reciprocal teaching]] technique.&lt;ref name="Schul, J.E. 2011"&gt;Schul, J.E. (2011). Revisiting an old friend: The practice and promise of cooperative learning for the twenty-first century. The Social Studies, 102, 88-93.&lt;/ref&gt; A well known cooperative learning technique is the Jigsaw, Jigsaw II and Reverse Jigsaw.

===Think-pair-share===
{{Main|Think-pair-share}}
Originally developed by Frank T. Lyman (1981),&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, F.T. 1981. The responsive classroom discussion: The inclusion of all students. In Mainstreaming Digest, ed. A. Anderson, 109-113. College Park: University of Maryland Press.&lt;/ref&gt; think-pair-share allows students to contemplate a posed question or problem silently. The student may write down thoughts or simply just brainstorm in his or her head. When prompted, the student pairs up with a peer and discusses his or her idea(s) and then listens to the ideas of his or her partner. Following pair dialogue, the teacher solicits responses from the whole group.&lt;ref name="Schul, J.E. 2011"/&gt; When teachers use this technique they don't have to worry about students not volunteering because each student will already have an idea in their heads, therefore, the teacher can call on anyone and increase discussion productivity.

=== Jigsaw ===
{{main|Jigsaw learning technique}}
Students are members of two groups: home group and expert group. In the heterogeneous home group, students are each assigned a different topic. Once a topic has been identified, students leave the home group and group with the other students with their assigned topic. In the new group, students learn the material together before returning to their home group. Once back in their home group, each student is accountable for teaching his or her assigned topic.&lt;ref name="Schul, J.E. 2011"/&gt;

=== Jigsaw II ===
Jigsaw II is [[Robert Slavin]]'s (1980) variation of Jigsaw in which members of the home group are assigned the same material, but focus on separate portions of the material. Each member must become an "expert" on his or her assigned portion and teach the other members of the home group.&lt;ref&gt;Schul, J.E. (2012). Revisiting and old friend: The practice and promise of cooperative learning for the twenty-first century. The Social Studies, 102, 88-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reverse jigsaw ===
{{main|Reverse jigsaw}}
This variation was created by Timothy Hedeen (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Heeden,T. 2003. The reverse jigsaw: A process of cooperative learning and discussion. Teaching Sociology 31 (3): 325-332.&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from the original Jigsaw during the teaching portion of the activity. In the Reverse Jigsaw technique, students in the expert groups teach the whole class rather than return to their home groups to teach the content.

=== Inside-outside circle ===
{{Main|Inside-outside circle}}
This is a cooperative learning strategy in which students form two concentric circles and take turns on rotation to face new partners to answer or discuss the teacher's questions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaganonline.com/free_articles/research_and_rationale/313/Effects-of-Communication-on-Student-Learning Effects-of-Communication-on-Student-Learning ]&lt;/ref&gt; This method can be used to gather variety of information, generate new ideas and solve problems.&lt;ref name="GregoryKuzmich2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gayle H. Gregory|author2=Lin Kuzmich|title=Differentiated Literacy Strategies for Student Growth and Achievement in Grades 7-12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6XlyAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|date=9 February 2005|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-1026-1|pages=63–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reciprocal teaching ===
Brown &amp; Paliscar (1982) developed reciprocal teaching, which - as currently practiced - pertains to the form of guided, cooperative learning that features a [[collaborative learning]] setting between learning leaders and listeners; expert scaffolding by an adult teacher; and, direct instruction, modeling, and practice in the use of simple strategies that facilitate a dialogue structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowing, Learning, and Instruction: Essays in Honor of Robert Glaser|last=Resnick|first=Lauren|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year=1989|isbn=0805800689|location=Hillsdale, NJ|pages=443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a model that allows for student pairs to participate in a dialogue about text, partners take turns reading and asking questions of each other, receiving immediate feedback. This approach enables students to use important metacognitive techniques such as clarifying, questioning, predicting, and summarizing. It embraces the idea that students can effectively learn from each other.&lt;ref&gt;Palinscar, A.S., &amp; Brown, A.L. (1984). Reciprocal teaching of comprehension-fostering and comprehension-monitoring activities. Cognition and Instruction, I (2), 117-175.&lt;/ref&gt; There are empirical studies that show the efficacy of reciprocal teaching even in subjects such as mathematics. For instance, it was found that children who were taught using this strategy showed higher levels of accuracy in mathematical computations in comparison with those who were not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cooperative Learning: The Social and Intellectual Outcomes of Learning in Groups|last=Gillies|first=Robyn|last2=Ashman|first2=Adrian|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0415303400|location=Oxon|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same success has been obtained in the cases of students learning in diverse situations such as those with learning disabilities and those who are at risk of academic failure,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cooperative Learning: Integrating Theory and Practice|last=Gillies|first=Robyn|publisher=SAGE|year=2007|isbn=9781412940474|location=Los Angeles|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others. These studies also cover learners from elementary to college levels.

=== The Williams ===
Students collaborate to answer a big question that is the learning objective. Each group has differentiated questions that increases in cognitive ability to allow students to progress and meet the learning objective.

=== STAD (or Student-Teams-Achievement Divisions) ===
Students are placed in small groups (or [[team]]s). The class in its entirety is presented with a lesson and the students are subsequently tested. Individuals are graded on the team's performance. Although the tests are taken individually, students are encouraged to work together to improve the overall performance of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Seifert and Rosemary Sutton. (2009) Educational Psychology 2nd Edition. "Chapter 9: Facilitating Complex Thinking." pp. 204 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Educational-Psychology.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rally Table ===
Rally Table is another process of cooperative learning. In this process, the class or the students are divided into groups. This is done to encourage group learning, team building and cooperative learning. It is the written version of Robin Table.

===TGT (or Team Game Tournament) ===
Students are placed into small groups to study and prepare for a trivia game. This gives students incentive to learn and have some fun learning the material. This is a group exercise so not one student is to blame

==Introduction==
Team game tournament is an effective technique of cooperative learning wherein groups are created that function in the class for a period of time. In this technique the groups revise a portion of material before writing a written test. This motivates those students that have the fear of writing the test and to learn and reinforce what has been already learnt.
This method is one of the learning strategies designed by Robert Slavin for the purpose of review and mastery in the learning. This method was basically to increase student's skills, increase interaction and self-esteem between students.
In this technique the students study in the class. The material is supplied and are taught in groups or individually through different activities. The students after receiving the material review it and then bring 2-6 points from their study into their assigned groups. Since the tournament is based on a material there is a specific answer.

'''Characteristics'''&lt;ref name="Team Game tounament"/&gt;
# Students are working in hetrogeneous groups.
# Playing the games makes the students to move into homogeneous and higher level groups.
# Understanding other's skills.

=== Method ===

The students compete in the tournament after a designated time to study by forming groups of 3-4 students where the stronger students compete with the weaker students and winner of the respective teams is moved to a high level team while the students who don't score well are moved to an easier level. This ensures that students of the same ability are competing with each other."&lt;ref name="utschools.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.utschools.ca/utseducation/academicdepartments/science/tgt-nabt_06_2.pdf|title = Team-Games-Tournament:Cooperative Learning and Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Purpose'''

TGT enhances student cooperation and friendly competition which allows different students with different capabilities to work together and acquire mastery in the topics assigned to them. The students have the independence to have interactions with different students. The benefit of this activity is that it holds the students responsible for the material they have to prepare.&lt;ref name="prezi.com"/&gt;

'''Advantages'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Team game tournament|url = http://syahbella-bellapoenya.blogspot.in/2011/05/effect-of-using-cooperative-learning.html|ref = blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The involvement of students in higher learning.
# The students get excited about learning.
# Knowledge is obtained from the student rather than solely from the teacher.
# Fosters positive attitude in the students, such as cooperation, tolerance.
# Trains students to express or convey ideas.

'''Disadvantages'''&lt;ref name="team game tournament"/&gt;

# It is time consuming for new teachers.
# Requires adequate facilities and infrastructure.
# Can create confusion in the classroom.

TGT is an effective tool to teach mathematics as it motivates and helps students acquire skills and mastery with the help of their peer and through healthy competition.&lt;ref name="eprints.uny.ac.id"/&gt;

*The five stage division on cooperative learning creates a useful method of analyzing learning in innovative businesses
*Innovativity connected to cooperative learning seems to make the creation of innovations possible

== Limitations / problems ==
Cooperative Learning has many limitations that could cause the process to be more complicated than first perceived. Sharan (2010) describes the constant evolution of cooperative learning as a threat. Because cooperative learning is constantly changing, there is a possibility that teachers may become confused and lack complete understanding of the method. The fact that cooperative learning is such a dynamic practice means that it can not be used effectively in many situations. Also teachers can get into the habit of relying on cooperative learning as a way to keep students busy. While cooperative learning will consume time, the most effective application of cooperative learning hinges on an active instructor. Teachers implementing cooperative learning may also be challenged with resistance and hostility from students who believe that they are being held back by their slower teammates or by students who are less confident and feel that they are being ignored or demeaned by their team.&lt;ref name="Sharan" /&gt;

Students often provide feedback in the form of evaluations or reviews on success of the teamwork experienced during cooperative learning experiences. Peer review and evaluations may not reflect true experiences due to perceived competition among peers. Students might feel pressured into submitting inaccurate evaluations due to bullying. To eliminate such concerns, confidential evaluation processes may help to increase evaluation strength.&lt;ref name="Tsay and Brady 2010"/&gt;

=== Group hate ===
Group hate is defined as "a feeling of dread that arises when facing the possibility of having to work in a group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorensen|first=|date=1981|title=Grouphate: a negative reaction to group work.|url=|journal=International Communication Association|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When students develop group hate their individual performance in the group suffers and in turn the group as a whole suffers. There are many factors that lead students to experience these feelings of group hate some of the more crucial elements include:
* A past bad experience
* Group fatigue (overuse of cooperative learning)
* Simply liking to work alone
When students are given a choice to choose learning activities (group based or individual work) students often evaluate several factors that lead them to a chose if they would like to work in groups or not.&amp;nbsp; The three most common factors listed are: 
* "how likely am I to get a good grade?"
* "how difficult will the task be?" 
* "the amount of effort involved". 
More often the students choose to do the work individually because they feel as if they can do a better job individually than they can as a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis &amp; Haywaird|first=|date=2003|title=Choice-based learning: student reactions in an undergraduate organizational communication course|url=|journal=Communication Education|volume=52|pages=148–156|doi=10.1080/03634520302467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What factors lead to a student forming group hate? It is difficult to say A, B, and C cause group hate simply due to the fact that each group is unique and everyone is different. However, there are several concerns that lead to students developing group hate. 
* Concerns about the teachers' role
* Concerns about the students' role
* Concerns about fairness and use of resources.&amp;nbsp; 
Concerns about the teachers' role usually stem from lack of communication from the teacher as to what exactly is expected of the group.&amp;nbsp; It is difficult for a teacher to strike the sweet spot of not being a helicopter teacher and remain involved in the project while also not being too "loosey goosey".&amp;nbsp; While a good teacher may be able to strike the balance every time this is a difficult task and most teachers tend to lean one way or the other. This can cause confusion with the students. This is only amplified when the students are put into groups and asked to complete a project with little instructions on how to do so. The way a teacher chooses to structure a project can influence how a student perceives the project overall.&amp;nbsp; Whether or not a student likes a teaching style or not can influence if they develop group hate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen &amp; Plax|first=|date=2002|title=Exploring consequences of group communication in the classroom: unraveling relational learning|url=|journal=New directions in group communication|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next concern that leads students to developing group hate is simply that students get sick of working with the same group members over and over again.&amp;nbsp; Cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;is becoming so common that students are beginning to develop group hate simply because they are doing so many group projects. Students express opinion such as "so many group projects with the same people", "we are all up in each others business".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While the building of personal relationships can be a positive aspect of cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;it can also be a negative if you are having to continually work with people who are constantly letting you down or being difficult to work with.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, it is common to have group members that exhibit signs of loafing within the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glenn|first=|date=2010|title="Students Give Group Assignments a Failing Grade."|url=|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loafing ===

Loafing is defined as "students who don't take responsibility for their own role, even if it is the smallest role in the group."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Isaac|first=Megan|date=March 2012|title=I Hate Group Work social Loafers, Indignant Peers, and the Drama of The Classroom|url=|journal=National Council of Teachers of English|volume=101|pages=83–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students expect that group based learning will be fair for everyone within the group.&amp;nbsp; In order for cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;to be fair the work load must be shared equally within the group.&amp;nbsp; Many students fear that this will not take place.&amp;nbsp; This leads to the students developing group hate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The fear that some members of the group will act as passengers or social loafers and derive a benefit (generally a good grade) from the group activity undermines the effectiveness of the group. Some students hoard their intellectual capital to make sure that no one unjustly benefits from it. Ironically, some of the students most indignant about "slackers" or "freeloaders" make immediate assumptions about their peers and insist from the outset that they will have to take care of everything in order to maintain control. There are many ways for a concern about equity to warp the function of a group. Therefore, to make groups more effective, the most important thing an instructor can do to defuse student resistance to cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;is to focus attention on the issue of "fairness."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In order for students not to develop group hate the instructors must be very aware of this process and take steps to insure that the project is "fair".&amp;nbsp; This can be a difficult task.&amp;nbsp; It is often difficult to gage what students are loafing while the project is taking place unless, other students in the group bring the problem to the attention of the instructor.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

=== Assessment of groups ===

It is a common practice to have the groups self assess after the project is complete. However, "Assessment can be the Achilles heel of cooperative learning"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Boud, Cohen, Sampson|first=|date=2001|title=Peer Learning in Higher Education: Learning from and with Each Other|isbn=978-1138172425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students often will assess their group positively in hopes that they will in return be assessed the same way.&amp;nbsp; This often leads to inaccurate assessments of the group.&amp;nbsp; "For most instructors, one of the greatest pedagogical challenges for a group communication course is to help students realize that the benefits of cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;outweigh the costs involved".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barton|first=|date=2005|title=Turning Grouphate into competent communication: Shared Governance and the small group classroom.|url=|journal=North Dakota Journal of Speech &amp; Theatre|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Group cohesion and conflict management ===

Another aspect of cooperative learning that leads to group members developing group hate is the fact that "groups are unable to achieve sufficient cohesion because they fail to manage conflict effectively".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothwell|first=|date=2004|title=Instruction based on cooperative learning|url=|journal=Handbook of Research on Learning and Instruction|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students are not usually in a group long enough to develop good group cohesion and establish effective ways to resolve conflict. The problem is that most students have had a negative experience in groups and consequently are apprehensive to get into such a situation again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keyton Harmon Frey|first=|date=1996|title=Grouphate: Implications for Teaching Group Communication.|url=|journal=Instructional Development|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; "One answer to this dilemma is to demonstrate how groups trump individuals in terms of problem solving".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If instructors are able to effectively accomplish this it is a positive step towards eliminating group hate.&amp;nbsp;

Group hate exists in almost all student groups.&amp;nbsp; Whether it be because of past bad experiences, concerns about how the project will play out, worries about group members loafing, or not knowing how to effectively manage conflict that may arise within the group.&amp;nbsp; However, group based learning is an important aspect of higher education and should continue to be used. More and more companies are turning towards team based models in order to become more efficient in the work place.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&amp;nbsp; By limiting student feelings of group hate this will lead to students having better group experiences and learning how to work better in groups.

Cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;is becoming more and more popular within the American education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caruso Wooley|first=|date=2008|title=Harnessing the power of emergent interdependence to promote diverse team collaboration.|url=|journal=Diversity and Groups|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost uncommon not to have some cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;elements within a collage class. However, it is not uncommon to hear students expressing negative opinions regarding cooperative learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myers|first=|date=2012|title=Students' perceptions of classroom group work as a function of group member selection|url=|journal=Communication Teacher|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Why is this?&amp;nbsp; Feichtner and Davis&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feichtner &amp; Davis|first=|date=1984|title=Why some groups fail: A survey of students' experiences with learning groups.|url=|journal=Organizational Behavior Teaching Review|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; put it elegantly by stating, "entirely too many students are leaving the classroom experiencing only the frustrations of cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;and not the numerous benefits possible through team based effort". One of the main flaws that we see with previous research is that the research is almost always done from the perspective of the instructor.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is giving us a flawed view of cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;as the instructors are not the one who are participating in the cooperative learning.&amp;nbsp;

"From the (often blind) viewpoint of instructors, we had always viewed cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;as an added advantage for the students – an opportunity to receive additional support while working closely with their peers.&amp;nbsp; We had never really considered what a disastrous experience some frustrated students must endure, or why some students reported only positive experiences from classes utilizing group learning techniques."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In order to better understand the phenomenon of cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;it is crucial that it be looked at through the student's perspective.&amp;nbsp; It is important to understand what makes cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;successful for some students and unsuccessful for others.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

== Cooperation vs competition vs individualistic efforts ==

There are many reasons why competitors tend to achieve less than they would if they were working cooperatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=David|title=Cooperative, competitive, and individualistic learning|journal=Journal of Research and Development in Education|date=1978|volume=12|pages=3–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; And there have also been lots of studies making a claim that cooperative learning is more effective than competitive learning and individualistic efforts. But studies also show that competition and individualistic efforts can be constructive and should be encouraged when they are appropriately structured.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
# Conditions for Constructive Competition
## Winning is relatively unimportant
## All participants have a reasonable chance to win.
## There are clear and specific rules, procedures, and criteria for winning.
# Conditions for Constructive Individualistic Efforts
## Cooperation is too costly, difficult or cumbersome because of the unavailability of skilled potential cooperators or the unavailability of the resources need for cooperation to take place.
## The goal is perceived as important, relevant, and worthwhile
## Participants expect to be successful in achieving their goals.
## The directions for completing the tasks are clear and specific, so participants do not need further clarification on how to proceed and how to evaluate their work.
## What is accomplished will be used subsequently in a cooperative effort.

'''Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences''', until 1978 known as '''Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences in America''', is an international non-profit organization with the aim to connect people with interest in Czech and Slovak intellectual contributions all around the world, supporting cooperation in culture, sciences, and education. For six decades, the Society has been promoting Czech and Slovak culture, history, and achievements of all sorts in the world affairs. It connects individuals interested in joining an international community of mutual inspirations, but also institutions with similar aims.

The Society was founded in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]] in 1958 &lt;ref name=LOC&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/european/imcz/ndl.html U.S. Library of Congress: ''The Czechs in America'']&lt;/ref&gt;  on the basis of the Washington DC local chapter of the Czechoslovak National Council of America (headquartered in [[Chicago]]), by Dr. Jaroslav Němec,&lt;ref name=CSDS&gt;[http://www.csds.cz/cs/encyklopedie/27-DS.html The Czechoslovak Documentation Center: ''Biographic Index'']&lt;/ref&gt; a lawyer and exiled chief military prosecutor, with significant support from [[Vlasta Vraz]], president of the Czechoslovak National Council of America.

In the years 1961-1978, the Society was registered as '''Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences in America''' in the New York State. From March 1965 to January 1975, the Society used a secretariat at 381 Park Avenue South, [[New York City]]. This office space became a meeting point of the Society's members and other intellectuals, including visitors from Czechoslovakia. Scholars could find useful books and periodicals here. It was also used as the Society's publications distribution center and archive.

In November 1978, the Society's head office was incorporated &lt;ref name=DCRA&gt;District of Columbia, Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs: ''File Number 783908'' (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; in the nation's capital [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]], where it was incepted. In November 1978, also the Society's official name was changed - it was shortened to '''Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences''', to reflect its international character and new local chapters being created also outside of the United States.

All operations of this organization are carried out by unpaid volunteers. From its inception, the Society has been independent and non-partisan.

==Founding personalities==

'''Jaroslav Němec''' convinced world-renown mathematician [[Václav Hlavatý]] to become the first President of the Society. Němec became its first Secretary General. In the years 1968-1970, Němec served as the Society's President and in 1980-1985, he also edited the Society's newsletter ''SVU NEWS / ZPRÁVY SVU''.

In the beginning, Němec was also able to get support for the project of creating this Society among known artists and writers: [[Jarmila Novotná]], [[Rafael Kubelík]], [[Rudolf Firkušný]], Ladislav Radimský, and others. Among politicians, he got Ladislav Feierabend, Juraj Slávik, Jozef Lettrich, Arnošt Heidrich, [[Štefan Osuský]]. Among the founding members there were also Joseph Hašek (father of [[Eliska Haskova Coolidge]]) and Francis Schwarzenberg.

==Society's periodicals==

The Society publishes a quarterly newsletter ''SVU NEWS/ ZPRÁVY SVU'', and an English periodical of scholarly and literary substance, the semi-annual ''KOSMAS - Czech, Slovak, and Central European Studies''.

During the communist era in Czechoslovakia, the Society published a [[Czech language]] and [[Slovak language]] literary and humanistic periodical: ''PROMĚNY - PREMENY/ METAMORPHOSES'' for nearly thirty years, which included articles by forbidden authors.

==Conferences==

The Society held its First World Congress in Washington, D.C. in 1962, attended by more than 200 scholars, scientists, and artists from all over the world. There were sixty papers read at these meetings, their subject ranging from linguistics to sociology and science. This was followed by the Second World Congress in 1964, on the campus of [[Columbia University]] in New York City. This time, about 120 papers were presented by scholars - not just by the Society members but also by a number of invited guests from all over the United States, Canada, South America, Australia and Western Europe. The papers covered most major fields of intellectual endeavor, including history, [[literature]] and [[linguistics]], music and [[fine arts]], [[social sciences]], and the [[biological]] and [[physical sciences]].

Since then, every even year, the Society has convened a world congress. The program includes presentations of scholarly papers, discussion panels, concerts, artistic exhibits and social events. The lecture program covers a wide range of subjects and disciplines, providing platforms for exchanges of views. The lectures, seminars and symposia, as well as printed materials are generally presented in English.
 
The first fifteen world congresses were held in the U.S. or Canada, usually on university campuses. The Sixteenth SVU World Congress in 1992 was held for the first time in Prague.

The Society has established the practice of convening specialized conferences every other year, usually in between the World Congresses.

'''David Hargreaves''' (born 2 February 1940) is an English actor, commonly seen on gritty television dramas in the 1970s and 1980s set in the north of England, and BBC children's television of the same era.

==Early life==
He was born in [[New Mills]], [[Derbyshire]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://img.pars04.fr.topfoto.co.uk/imageflows/preview/t=topfoto&amp;f=0278937 New Mills]&lt;/ref&gt; He trained as a science teacher, at [[City of Leeds Training College]], and at the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]].

==Career==
Hargreaves worked as a supply teacher at Rising Hill Comprehensive School in Islington, before joining the Royal Shakespeare Company to play in the first ''The Wars of the Roses'' Cycle of plays in 1963/65. He played Hotspur in ''Henry IV part 1'' and Leontes in ''A Winters Tale'' for the North East Shakespeare Festival run by Joseph O'Connor in 1965, before joining Olivier's National Theatre, appearing in ''Much Ado about Nothing'', ''Mother Courage'', ''The Crucible'', ''Royal Hunt of the Sun'', ''Love for Love'', ''Othello'', ''The Storm'', ''A Flea in Her Ear'' and ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead''. After an extensive career in repertory theatre, television and radio, he returned to the RSC in 2004 to play Capulet in ''Romeo and Juliet'' in Peter Gill's production, and as Gloucester in Bill Alexander's production of ''King Lear'' to Corin Redgrave's Lear. Returned to the RSC in 2008/09 to play Baptista Minola in ''The Taming of the Shrew'', directed, by Conal Morrison, and as Man in ''The Cordelia Dream'', written by Marina Carr, directed by Selina Cartmell, for the RSC at Wilton's Music Hall. In 2005 he returned to the National Theatre in a co-production with the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, to play Charlie in ''On the Shore of the Wide World''. In 2011 he played God in Tony Harrison's, ''The Mysteries'', directed by Deborah Bruce, and in 2012 played the King of France/Nym/Erpingham, in Dominic Dromgoole's production of ''Henry V'', both at Shakespeare's Globe. 2015 he played Giles Corey in The Crucible, and in 2016, Gloucester in King Lear, both directed by Tom Morris at the Bristol Old Vic.

'''Duffy Books in Homes''' is the trading name of The Alan Duff Charitable Foundation.  It is a New Zealand registered, literacy-focused [[charitable organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booksinhomes.org.nz/Home.aspx |title=Home - Duffy Books In Homes |publisher=Booksinhomes.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has links to similar organisations in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bihusa.org |title=Duffy Books in Homes USA - Home |publisher=Bihusa.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brian Engert |url=http://www.biha.com.au |title=Books in Homes Australia |publisher=Biha.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The programme was conceived in 1992 when the author [[Alan Duff]] visited Camberley School in [[Hastings, New Zealand]].  According to Principal Peter Johnstone "Alan was appalled to see so many children come from bookless homes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpk.govt.nz/en/in-print/kokiri/kokiri-06-2007/building-libraries-not-prisons/ |title=Building libraries not prisons |publisher=Tpk.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a meeting with philanthropist Christine Fernyhough in 1994 the Alan Duff Charitable Foundation was legally formed.  The official launch of the programme (then known as Books in Homes) took place at Tairangi School&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO9908/S00081/1-millionth-book-presented-at-mana-school.htm |title=1 Millionth Book Presented at Mana School &amp;#124; Scoop News |publisher=Scoop.co.nz |date=24 August 1999 |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Wellington]] on 24 August 1995 and was attended by then [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Jim Bolger]].

The programme began with 80 schools, 16,000 students and 14 sponsors.  In 2018 the programme reported over 520 schools, nearly 300 Early Childhood Centres, over 100,000 students and more than 200 funding partners and supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booksinhomes.org.nz/Page/AboutUs/OurHistory.aspx |title=Our History - Duffy Books In Homes |publisher=Booksinhomes.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable personalities who were once students in Duffy Books in Homes schools include BMX rider [[Sarah Walker (BMX rider)|Sarah Walker]] and [[New Zealand at Miss World|Miss World New Zealand]] 2010 [[Cody Yerkovich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxy.co.nz/national/15-years-duffy-books-homes/5/59455/ |title=15 Years Of Duffy Books In Homes |publisher=Voxy.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
The programme has a stated aim of inspiring "a love of books in Duffy children so they become adults who inspire a love of reading."  Its core function is as a form of [[book sales club|book club]] in which students at low [[Socio-Economic Decile|decile]] primary and intermediate schools in New Zealand order books from a brochure which are then presented at [[role model]] assemblies at the end of three school terms.  Each child participating receives a minimum of five new books each year.

Additional components of the programme include annual awards for parents and grandparents, effort in reading and writing and excellence in attitude.  There are also weekly book awards for good behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booksinhomes.org.nz/Page/AboutUs/WhatWeDo.aspx |title=What we do - Duffy Books In Homes |publisher=Booksinhomes.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two troupes of performers visit the majority of schools in the programme annually to perform a literacy-focused stage show.  In 2018 the Duffy Theatre performs a show entitled 'Duffy and the Cloak Bay Bully'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booksinhomes.org.nz/Page/Theatre/TheatreHome.aspx |title=Theatre home - Duffy Books In Homes |publisher=Booksinhomes.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme is also offered to [[early childhood education]] centres under the name 'Ready 4 Reading'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booksinhomes.org.nz/Page/Preschools/PreschoolsHome.aspx |title=Preschools Home - Duffy Books In Homes |publisher=Booksinhomes.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
Duff stipulated that schools bear some of the cost of funding the programme themselves.  Schools fund approximately one third of the cost of the programme with the remaining costs being met by the [[Government of New Zealand|New Zealand Government]] and private [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booksinhomes.org.nz/Page/Schools/BecomeaDuffySchool.aspx |title=Become a Duffy School - Duffy Books In Homes |publisher=Booksinhomes.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major supporters include [[Mainfreight]], [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]], [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[Carter Holt Harvey]], [[Rotary International|Rotary]], [[Te Puni Kōkiri]], [[Norm Hewitt]], Latitude Financial Services and [[The Warehouse Group|The Warehouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booksinhomes.org.nz/Page/Supporters/OurSupporters/OurSupporters.aspx |title=Our Supporters - Duffy Books In Homes |publisher=Booksinhomes.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
Research undertaken in 1996 and 1997 by Dr Warwick Elley suggested that year 5 and 6 children in eight schools "improved (their reading ability) by 35% more than they would have without the Duffy Programme."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzine.co.nz/features/books.html |title=* NZine * Alan Duff's "Books In Homes" Programme - Alan Duff, Books in Homes, literacy, reading problems, illiteracy, reading skills, New Zealand schools, Once were Warriors, HERO role models, "Caught Being Goo |publisher=Nzine.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2005">The '''Foundation for Asian American Independent Media''' is an arts education organization based in Chicago that focuses on Asian American art, history, and issues and hosts an annual Asian American Showcase.

== History ==
The Foundation for Asian American Independent Media (FAAIM) was founded in 1995 by journalist [[Ben Kim]], and musicians [[Sooyoung Park]] and [[William Shin]]. Known then as Fortune4, the organization’s first project was a New York Times- and MTV-lauded recording and subsequent tour of Asian American rock bands, entitled Ear of the Dragon. In 1996, the group created the Annual Chicago Asian American Showcase (the Showcase), the nation’s only film festival dedicated exclusively to Asian American film. Incorporated as a not-for-profit in 1999, FAAIM works with other cultural institutions in Chicago on Asian-American media and education.

Since 2001 [[Tim Hugh]] has been the Executive Director of FAAIM. Other members include [[Vincent Chung]] and [[Larry Lee (artist)|Larry Lee]].

== Asian American Showcase ==
The Asian American Showcase is an annual film festival based in Chicago originally held at the Film Center at SAIC (now called the Gene Siskel Film Center). The Asian American Showcase exhibits independent films created by or about Asian Americans, as well as other media such as writing and music.

==Plot==
A teacher at Wittering College in north [[London]], Robert Anderson ([[David Schofield (actor)|Schofield]]), is hit in the face by a pupil and forced to take three months' leave to avoid being sued by the parents of the child for giving the pupil an F grade, which is against school policy.

Anderson is deeply affected by the incident and upon his return to teaching, he is an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], emotionally disturbed and separated from his wife, Helen ([[Juliet Aubrey|Aubrey]]). Their daughter, Kate ([[Eliza Bennett|Bennett]]), lives with her mother Helen and has classes with her father, but does not respect him. The headmistress, Sarah Balham ([[Ruth Gemmell|Gemmell]]), loathes Anderson and clearly wants to get rid of him, but the [[National Union of Teachers]] does not allow her to fire him. She indirectly accuses him of bad teaching and bringing alcohol into school.

When Anderson reads about violence in another school, he sends a memo advising all employees at the school about the high number of attacks on teachers and auxiliary staff annually. As a result, he is considered paranoid and delusional by everybody at the school.

One day, after hours, Anderson is overseeing detention, in which he has placed his daughter. They argue over her use of a mobile telephone during the detention session – he slaps her in the face and immediately regrets it.

Soon after, the [[protagonist]] notes some strange movements outside the school and discovers that the telephone lines are down. As he stands by a closed window, a milkshake is thrown at him from outside and the message 'U R Dead' appears written in the milkshake. He advises security guard James ([[Finlay Robertson]]), who seems uninterested.

Meanwhile, another security guard Brian, ([[Jamie Kenna]]) has been murdered by hoodies who locked him in a wheelie bin and set fire to it.

Looking for his daughter, Anderson visits the school library but, after he leaves, the librarian is confronted by two hooded characters, who murder her.

Anderson finds his daughter smoking in the toilets with her boyfriend, Jake Eaves (Max Fowler) and headmistress Balham instructs them all to go home. Kate tells Balham that her father slapped her and Balham asks her to make a statement. Meanwhile, PE teacher Nicky ([[Roxanne McKee|McKee]]) passes through the gymnasium and into the changing rooms, where she is attacked by four teenagers wearing hoodies and carrying crowbars.

Having left the building, Anderson goes to his car, but finds the dead security guard's torch on the ground in the car park. Meanwhile, Kate is writing her statement in the staff room. Balham realises she can finally sack Anderson and, unable to use the telephone, calls security guard James to ensure that the teacher does not re-enter the school, and Helen, to inform her of the assault.

Balham subsequently finds a body and escapes from two attackers herself, only for them to kill her before she can call the police. Anderson then discovers her corpse, her face badly disfigured. He tries to call the police, but when an attacker enters the room he hides, abandoning the phone, which the attacker crushes.

Leaving the building, Kate is immediately chased back in by one of the attackers. Her boyfriend Eaves, who was waiting outside, enters the building to look for her. She comes across a member of auxiliary staff Gary, ([[Tom Mannion]]), who is unaware of the situation in the school and goes after the attackers, but is electrocuted immediately after discovering Eaves, who is wrapped in barbed wire.

Anderson and James team up to find Kate, who has left a 'Help' note in view of a CCTV camera. They discover Nicky struggling along a corridor, but she has been badly mutilated. Finding the room in which Kate is hiding, they are confronted by a hoodie and in a moment of cowardice, James locks the door with Anderson inside.

Meanwhile, the police arrive and enter the school. A female police officer is pushed down a flight of concrete stairs by one of the hoodies and the other policeman is hit with a crowbar in the face. The attackers then find James, who tries to escape but is cornered by the youths.

Anderson finds Kate, but one of the hooded attackers catches the pair off guard, but his attack on Anderson is deflected and he stabs and wounds Kate. Anderson manages to overpower the attacker, grabs the knife and stabs him multiple times, then picks up his daughter and rushes out of the building. However, when they reach his car, they spot Helen's car in the car park and realise that she has arrived at the school.

Anderson has to decide in an instant whether to save his daughter's life by driving her to hospital, or to save Helen by re-entering the school. He puts Kate in the back seat of the car and drives her to the hospital, leaving Helen to walk around the school, unaware of her potential fate.

==Critical reception==
''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote "Green-tinged [[cinematography|lensing]] provides a unifying, if oppressive, aesthetic, while the sparse, haunting score, incorporating sinister choral elements, makes the grade."&lt;ref name=V/&gt; ''[[The Gaurdian]]'' wrote "F doesn't quite work, but it aims at something interesting."&lt;ref name=TG/&gt; While ''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' said "It's not perfect, but it's a solid, well shot slasher/thriller hybrid that fans of [[Them (2006 film)|Ils (Them)]] or [[Eden Lake]] should probably appreciate."&lt;ref name=BD/&gt;

[[File:WP Hollaender-Ebinger.jpeg|thumb|Hollaender with his wife Blandine Ebinger in the 1920s]]
'''Friedrich Hollaender''' (in exile also '''Frederick Hollander'''; 18 October 1896{{spaced ndash}}18 January 1976) was a German [[film score|film composer]] and author.

==Life and career==
He was born in London, where his father, [[operetta]] composer [[Victor Hollaender]], worked as a musical director at the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]]. Young Hollaender had a solid music and theatre family background: his uncle Gustav was director of the [[Stern Conservatory]] in Berlin, his uncle Felix Hollaender was a well-known novelist and drama critic, who later worked with [[Max Reinhardt]] at the [[Deutsches Theater (Berlin)|Deutsches Theater]].

In 1899 Hollaender's family returned to [[Berlin]], his father began teaching at the Stern Conservatory, where his son became a student in [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]'s master class. In the evening he played the piano at [[silent film]] performances in local cinemas, developing the art of [[musical improvisation]]. By the age of 18 he was employed as a [[répétiteur]] at the [[Prague State Opera|New German Theatre]] in Prague and also was put in charge of troop entertainment at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] of World War I.

Having finished his studies, he composed music for productions by [[Max Reinhardt]] and became involved in Berlin's [[Kabarett]] scene. Together with [[Kurt Tucholsky]], [[Klabund]], [[Walter Mehring]], [[Mischa Spoliansky]] and [[Joachim Ringelnatz]] he worked in venues like Reinhardt's ''Schall und Rauch'' ensemble at the [[Großes Schauspielhaus]] or the ''Wilde Bühne'' led by [[Trude Hesterberg]] at the [[Theater des Westens]] in [[Charlottenburg]], where he established the ''Tingel-Tangel-Theater'' cabaret in 1931.

In 1919 he married the actress [[Blandine Ebinger]], the couple divorced in 1926. Their daughter Philine later became the wife of the cabarettist [[Georg Kreisler]]. Hollaender had his final breakthrough, when he wrote the film score for ''[[The Blue Angel]]'' (1930), including the most popular song "[[Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)]]", performed by [[Marlene Dietrich]].

He had to leave [[Nazi Germany]] in 1933 because of his Jewish descent&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebluegrassspecial.com/archive/2011/april2011/dr-t-frederick-hollander.html&lt;/ref&gt; and first moved to Paris. He emigrated to the United States the next year, where he wrote the music for over a hundred films, including ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' (1939), ''[[A Foreign Affair]]'' (1948), ''[[The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T]]'' (1953 [[Academy Award]] nomination) and ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954). Many of his songs were again made famous by Marlene Dietrich. He can be seen as the piano accompanist in ''A Foreign Affair'' (on the songs, "Black Market", "Illusions" and "Ruins of Berlin"). He received four [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for composition. As "Frederick Hollander", he also wrote the semi-autobiographical novel ''[[Those Torn From Earth]]'', released in 1941, which details the flight from Germany that many Jewish members of the film industry embarked on after the Nazis came to power and instituted the [[Nuremberg Laws]].

In 1956 he returned to Germany and again worked for several years as a [[revue]] composer at the [[Theater Die Kleine Freiheit]] in Munich. He made a [[cameo appearance]] in [[Billy Wilder]]'s film comedy ''[[One, Two, Three]]'' (1960) as a [[Kapellmeister]]. Hollaender died 1976 in Munich and is buried in the [[Obergiesing]] ''[[Ostfriedhof (Munich)|Ostfriedhof]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8843">'''Life skills''' are abilities for adaptive and positive behavior that enable humans to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of life.&lt;ref&gt;"Life Skills Education for Children and Adolescents in Schools"[[World Health Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is also termed as [[psychosocial]] competency.&lt;ref&gt;Best Thomas, A study on stress and its correlatives with family environment. Retrieved from [[ResearchGate]].&lt;/ref&gt; The subject varies greatly depending on [[Norm (social)|social norms]] and community expectations but skills that function for well-being and aid individuals to develop into active and productive members of their communities are considered as life skills.

==Enumeration and categorization==

The [[UNICEF]] Evaluation Office suggests that "there is no definitive list" of psychosocial skills;&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2012"&gt;
{{cite web
| url           = http://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/files/UNICEF_GLS_Web.pdf
| title         = Global evaluation of life skills education programmes

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
nevertheless [[UNICEF]] enumerates psychosocial and interpersonal skills that are generally well-being oriented, and essential alongside literacy and [[numeracy]] skills. Since it changes its meaning from culture to culture and life positions, it is considered a concept that is elastic in nature. But UNICEF acknowledges social and emotional life skills identified by Collaborative for Academic, Social and Emotional Learning (CASEL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513044119/https://casel.org/why-it-matters/what-is-sel/skills-competencies|url=https://casel.org/why-it-matters/what-is-sel/skills-competencies|title=Skills &amp; Competencies - CASEL|archivedate=13 May 2011|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Life skills are a product of synthesis: many skills are developed simultaneously through practice, like [[humor]], which allows a person to feel in [[Locus of control|control]] of a situation and make it more manageable in perspective. It allows the person to release fears, anger, and stress &amp; achieve a qualitative life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/tc/humor-therapy-topic-overview|title=Do Hasya Yoga|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, decision-making often involves critical thinking ("what are my options?") and values clarification ("what is important to me?"), ("How do I ''feel'' about this?"). Ultimately, the interplay between the skills is what produces powerful behavioral outcomes, especially where this approach is supported by other strategies.&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/search/search.php?q=Life-skills&amp;type=Main|title=UNICEF – Search Results|publisher=unicef.org|accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life skills can vary from financial literacy,&lt;ref name="USA Funds Life Skills"&gt;[http://content.usafunds.org/financial_aid/products/ourproducts/pages/lifeskills.aspx USA Funds Life Skills] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317045654/http://content.usafunds.org/financial_aid/products/ourproducts/Pages/lifeskills.aspx |date=2011-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[Substance abuse prevention|substance-abuse prevention]], to therapeutic techniques to deal with disabilities such as [[autism]].

===Life skills===

The [[World Health Organization]] in 1999 identified the following core cross-cultural areas of life skills:&lt;ref name="WHO 1999"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/en/30.pdf |title=Partners in Life Skills Education : Conclusions from a United Nations Inter-Agency Meeting |date=1999 |website=[[World Health Organization]] |access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[decision-making]] and [[problem-solving]];
* [[creative thinking]] (''see also:'' [[lateral thinking]]) and [[critical thinking]];
* [[communication]] and [[interpersonal skills]]; 
* [[self-awareness]] and [[empathy]]; 
* [[assertiveness]] and [[equanimity]]; and
* [[Psychological resilience|resilience]] and [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with emotions and coping with stress.

UNICEF listed similar skills and related categories in its 2012 report.&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2012"/&gt;

Life skills curricula designed for [[K–12 (education)|K-12]] often emphasize communications and practical skills needed for successful independent living as well as for developmental-disabilities/special-education students with an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP).&lt;ref name="PSESD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psesd.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=297&amp;Itemid=448 |title=Puget Sound ESD – excellence &amp;amp; equity in education &amp;#124; Pre-K-12 Life Skills Curriculum Guide |publisher=psesd.org|accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parenting: a venue of life skills nourishment==
Life skills are often taught in the domain of [[Parenting#Skills|parenting]], either indirectly through the observation and experience of the child, or directly with the purpose of teaching a specific skill. Parenting itself can be considered as a set of life skills which can be taught or comes natural to a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi=10.4135/9781412958479.n53|chapter = Behavioral parent training|title = Encyclopedia of Human Relationships|year = 2009|last1 = Prinz|first1 = Ron| isbn=9781412958462}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educating a person in skills for dealing with [[pregnancy]] and parenting can also coincide with additional life skills development for the child and enable the parents to guide their children in adulthood.

Many life skills programs are offered when traditional family structures and healthy relationships have broken down, whether due to parental lapses, divorce, psychological disorders or due to issues with the children (such as substance abuse or other risky behavior). For example, the [[International Labour Organization]] is teaching life skills to ex-child laborers and [[At-risk students#At-risk students|at-risk children]] in Indonesia to help them avoid and to recover from worst forms of [[child abuse]].&lt;ref name="ILO"&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/jakarta/whatwedo/eventsandmeetings/lang--en/WCMS_151750/index.htm Improving Vocational and Life Skills of Ex-Child Labourers and at Risk Children Aged 15 to 17 Years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926070201/http://www.ilo.org/jakarta/whatwedo/eventsandmeetings/lang--en/WCMS_151750/index.htm |date=2011-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models: behavior prevention vs. positive development==

While certain life skills programs focus on teaching the prevention of certain behaviors, they can be relatively ineffective. Based upon their research, the Family and Youth Services Bureau,&lt;ref name="hhs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/fysb|title=Home &amp;#124; Family and Youth Services Bureau &amp;#124; Administration for Children and Families|publisher=acf.hhs.gov|accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; a division of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] advocates the theory of [[Positive Youth Development]] (PYD) as a replacement for the less effective prevention programs. PYD focuses on the strengths of an individual as opposed to the older decrepit models which tend to focus on the "potential" weaknesses that have yet to be shown. The Family and Youth Services Bureau has found that individuals who were trained in life skills by positive development model identified themselves with a greater sense of confidence, usefulness, sensitivity and openness rather than that of preventive model.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

&lt;/ref&gt; about her life as the Pakistani military intervened in the region. She rose in prominence, giving interviews in print and on television, and she was nominated for the [[International Children's Peace Prize]] by activist [[Desmond Tutu]].

On 9 October 2012, while on a bus in the [[Swat District]], after taking an exam, Yousafzai and two other girls were shot by a [[Tehrik-i Taliban Pakistan|Taliban]] gunman in an assassination attempt in retaliation for her activism; the gunman fled the scene. Yousafzai was hit in the head with a bullet and remained unconscious and in critical condition at the [[Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology|Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology]], but her condition later improved enough for her to be transferred to the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]] in [[Birmingham]], UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://gma.yahoo.com/72-hours-saved-malala-doctors-reveal-first-time-101347540--abc-news-topstories.html | title=The 72 Hours That Saved Malala: Doctors Reveal for the First Time How Close She Came to Death | work=[[Good Morning America]] | publisher=[[Yahoo News]] | date=7 October 2013 | accessdate=10 October 2014 | author=Schifrin, Nick | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023175300/https://gma.yahoo.com/72-hours-saved-malala-doctors-reveal-first-time-101347540--abc-news-topstories.html | archivedate=23 October 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The attempt on her life sparked an international outpouring of support for Yousafzai.

Inspired by [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] and [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]], Yousafzai started speaking about education rights as early as September 2008, when her father took her to [[Peshawar]] to speak at the local [[Peshawar Press Club|press club]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; "How dare the Taliban take away my basic right to education?", Yousafzai asked her audience in a speech covered by newspapers and television channels throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/pakistan/article/716131--brave-defiance-in-pakistan-s-swat-valley|title=Brave defiance in Pakistan's Swat Valley|work=Toronto Star|author=Westhead, Rick|date=26 October 2009|accessdate=15 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013022438/http://www.thestar.com/news/world/pakistan/article/716131--brave-defiance-in-pakistan-s-swat-valley|archivedate=13 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Yousafzai began as a trainee and then a peer educator in the [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting]]'s Open Minds Pakistan youth programme, which worked in schools in the region to help young people engage in constructive discussion on social issues through the tools of journalism, public debate and dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.iwpr.net/global-voices/young-journalist-inspires-fellow-students|website = Institute for War and Peace Reporting|accessdate = 15 July 2015|title = Young Journalist Inspires Fellow Students|date = 5 December 2009|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150710112736/https://www.iwpr.net/global-voices/young-journalist-inspires-fellow-students|archivedate = 10 July 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2008, Aamer Ahmed Khan of the [[BBC World Service|BBC Urdu]] website and his colleagues came up with a novel way of covering the [[Taliban]]'s growing influence in [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]]. They decided to ask a schoolgirl to blog anonymously about her life there. Their correspondent in [[Peshawar]], [[Abdul Hai Kakkar|Abdul Hai Kakar]], had been in touch with a local school teacher, Ziauddin Yousafzai, but could not find any students willing to do so, as it was considered too dangerous by their families. Finally, Yousafzai suggested his own daughter, 11-year-old Malala.&lt;ref name=malalabbccontact&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistani Heroine: How Malala Yousafzai Emerged from Anonymity|url=http://world.time.com/2012/10/23/pakistani-heroine-how-malala-yousafzai-emerged-from-anonymity/|publisher=Time World|accessdate=12 October 2013|date=23 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020203236/http://world.time.com/2012/10/23/pakistani-heroine-how-malala-yousafzai-emerged-from-anonymity/|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Taliban militants led by [[Maulana Fazlullah]] were taking over the Swat Valley, banning television, music, girls' education,&lt;ref name="new yorker"/&gt; and women from going shopping.&lt;ref name="portrait"&gt;{{cite news| title = Malala Yousafzai: Portrait of the girl blogger| publisher = BBC News| date = 10 October 2012| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19899540| accessdate = 11 October 2012| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121011081725/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19899540| archivedate = 11 October 2012| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bodies of beheaded policemen were being displayed in town squares.&lt;ref name="new yorker"/&gt; At first, a girl named Aisha from her father's school agreed to write a diary, but then the girl's parents stopped her from doing it because they feared Taliban reprisals.

Only 11 out of 27 pupils attended the class because the number decreased because of the Taliban's edict. My three friends have shifted to Peshawar, Lahore and Rawalpindi with their families after this edict.

"We had been covering the violence and politics in Swat in detail but we didn't know much about how ordinary people lived under the Taliban", said Mirza Waheed, the former editor of BBC Urdu.

On 3 January 2009, Yousafzai's first entry was posted to the BBC Urdu blog. She would hand-write notes and then pass them on to a reporter who would scan and e-mail them.&lt;ref name="new yorker"/&gt; The blog records Yousafzai's thoughts during the [[First Battle of Swat]], as military operations take place, fewer girls show up to school, and finally, her school shuts down.

In Mingora, the Taliban had set an edict that no girls could attend school after 15 January 2009. The group had already blown up more than a hundred girls' schools.&lt;ref name="new yorker"/&gt; The night before the ban took effect was filled with the noise of artillery fire, waking Yousafzai several times. The following day, Yousafzai also read for the first time excerpts from her blog that had been published in a local newspaper.&lt;ref name="BBC Diary"/&gt;

====Banned from school====
Following the edict, the Taliban destroyed several more local schools. On 24 January 2009, Yousafzai wrote: "Our annual exams are due after the vacations but this will only be possible if the Taliban allow girls to go to school. We were told to prepare certain chapters for the exam but I do not feel like studying."&lt;ref name="full blog"&gt;{{cite news|title=Swat: Diary of a Pakistani schoolgirl (Malala Yousafzai) – BBC |url=http://criticalppp.com/archives/771 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715070624/http://criticalppp.com/archives/771 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 July 2010 |work=original Urdu and English translation of Yousufzai's blog |publisher=LUBP |accessdate=16 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, girls' schools were still closed. In solidarity, private schools for boys had decided not to open until 9 February, and notices appeared saying so.&lt;ref name="full blog"/&gt; On 7 February, Yousafzai and her brother returned to their hometown of Mingora, where the streets were deserted, and there was an "eerie silence". "We went to the supermarket to buy a gift for our mother but it was closed, whereas earlier it used to remain open till late. Many other shops were also closed", she wrote in her blog. Their home had been robbed and their television was stolen.&lt;ref name="full blog"/&gt;

After boys' schools reopened, the Taliban lifted restrictions on girls' primary education, where there was [[Mixed-sex education|co-education]]. Girls-only schools were still closed. Yousafzai wrote that only 70 pupils attended, out of 700 pupils who were enrolled.&lt;ref name="full blog"/&gt;

On 15 February, gunshots could be heard in the streets of Mingora, but Yousafzai's father reassured her, saying "Don't be scared – this is firing for peace." Her father had read in the newspaper that the government and the militants were going to sign a peace deal the next day. Later that night, when the Taliban announced the peace deal on their [[FM broadcasting|FM Radio]] studio, another round of stronger firing started outside.&lt;ref name="full blog"/&gt; Yousafzai spoke out against the Taliban on the national current affairs show ''[[Capital Talk]]'' on 18 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19890029 |title=Pakistan media condemn attack on Malala Yousafzai |date=9 October 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=23 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130422065719/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19890029 |archivedate=22 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, [[Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi|local Taliban]] leader [[Fazlullah (militant leader)|Maulana Fazlulla]] announced on his FM radio station that he was lifting the ban on women's education, and girls would be allowed to attend school until exams were held on 17 March, but they had to wear [[burqa]]s.&lt;ref name="full blog"/&gt;

====Girls' schools reopen====
On 25 February, Yousafzai wrote on her blog that she and her classmates "played a lot in class and enjoyed ourselves like we used to before".&lt;ref name="full blog"/&gt; Attendance at Yousafzai's class was up to 19 of 27 pupils by 1 March, but the Taliban were still active in the area. Shelling continued, and relief goods meant for displaced people were looted.&lt;ref name="full blog"/&gt; Only two days later, Yousafzai wrote that there was a skirmish between the military and Taliban, and the sounds of mortar shells could be heard: "People are again scared that the peace may not last for long. Some people are saying that the peace agreement is not permanent, it is just a break in fighting."&lt;ref name="full blog"/&gt;

On 9 March, Yousafzai wrote about a science paper that she performed well on, and added that the Taliban were no longer searching vehicles as they once did. Her blog ended on 12 March 2009.&lt;ref name="final entry"&gt;{{cite news|title=(Part 10 of Yousfzai's blog)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/urdu/interactivity/2009/03/090313_swat_diary_part10_aw.shtml|publisher=BBC Urdu|accessdate=16 October 2012|author=Malala Yousufzai|language=Urdu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012011920/http://www.bbc.co.uk/urdu/interactivity/2009/03/090313_swat_diary_part10_aw.shtml|archivedate=12 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a displaced person===
{{See also|Second Battle of Swat}}
After the BBC diary ended, Yousafzai and her father were approached by ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter [[Adam B. Ellick]] about filming a documentary.&lt;ref name="iwpr"/&gt; In May, the [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani Army]] moved into the region to regain control during the [[Second Battle of Swat]]. Mingora was evacuated and Yousafzai's family was displaced and separated. Her father went to [[Peshawar]] to protest and lobby for support, while she was sent into the countryside to live with relatives. "I'm really bored because I have no books to read", Yousafzai is filmed saying in the documentary.&lt;ref name="Class dismissed"/&gt;

That month, after criticising militants at a press conference, Yousafzai's father received a death threat over the radio by a Taliban commander.&lt;ref name="Class dismissed"/&gt; Yousafzai was deeply inspired in her activism by her father. That summer, for the first time, she committed to becoming a politician and not a doctor, as she had once aspired to be.&lt;ref name="Class dismissed"/&gt;

By early July, refugee camps were filled to capacity. The prime minister made a long-awaited announcement saying that it was safe to return to the Swat Valley. The Pakistani military had pushed the Taliban out of the cities and into the countryside. Yousafzai's family reunited, and on 24 July 2009 they headed home. They made one stop first – to meet with a group of other [[grassroots]] activists that had been invited to see United States [[Presidency of Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]]'s special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, [[Richard Holbrooke]]. Yousafzai pleaded with Holbrooke to intervene in the situation, saying, "Respected ambassador, if you can help us in our education, so please help us." When her family finally did return home, they found it had not been damaged, and her school had sustained only light damage.&lt;ref name="Class dismissed"/&gt;

In April 2015, the ten who were arrested were sentenced to life in prison by Judge Mohammad Amin Kundi, a counterterrorism judge, with the chance of eligibility for parole, and possible release, after 25 years.

Yousafzai has repeatedly condemned the [[2016 Rohingya persecution in Myanmar|Rohingya persecution in Myanmar]]. In June 2015, the Malala Fund released a statement in which Yousafzai argues that the Rohingya people deserve "citizenship in the country where they were born and have lived for generations" along with "equal rights and opportunities."

On 10 October 2014, Yousafzai was announced as the co-recipient of the [[2014 Nobel Peace Prize]] for her struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.

Adán Cortés, a college student from Mexico City and asylum seeker, interrupted Yousafzai's Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony in protest for the [[2014 Iguala mass kidnapping]] in Mexico, but was quickly taken away by security personnel. Yousafzai later sympathised, and acknowledged that problems are faced by young people all over the world, saying "there are problems in Mexico, there are problems even in America, even here in Norway, and it is really important that children raise their voices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malala Yousafzai says Mexican protester's actions show 'There are problems in Mexico'|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/12/11/malala-yousafzai-says-mexican-protester-actions-show-there-are-problems-in/|work=FOX News Latino|date=11 December 2014|accessdate=5 March 2015|agency=Associated Press|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402182112/http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/12/11/malala-yousafzai-says-mexican-protester-actions-show-there-are-problems-in/|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Letterman interview===
In March 2018, Yousafzai was the subject of an interview with [[David Letterman]] for his Netflix show ''[[My Next Guest Needs No Introduction]]''. Speaking about the Taliban, she opined that their misogyny comes from a [[superiority complex]], and is reinforced by finding "excuses" in culture or literature, such as by misinterpreting teachings of Islam.&lt;ref name="THR Letterman"/&gt; On the topic of her attackers, Yousafzai comments that "I forgive them because that's the best revenge I can have". Pointing out that the person who attacked her was a young boy, she says that "He thought he was doing the right thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geo.tv/latest/185579-malala-shares-thoughts-on-female-education|title=Malala talks about education, extremism and politics with David Letterman|work=[[Geo TV]]|date=9 March 2018|accessdate=13 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313214650/https://www.geo.tv/latest/185579-malala-shares-thoughts-on-female-education|archivedate=13 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked about the presidency of [[Donald Trump]], Yousafzai criticised that "Some of the things have really disappointed me, like sexual harassment and the ban on Muslims and racism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1655445/4-malala-discusses-trump-girls-education-muslim-ban-david-lettermans-show/|title=Malala discusses Trump, girls' education and Muslim ban on David Letterman's show|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=9 March 2018|accessdate=13 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314045431/https://tribune.com.pk/story/1655445/4-malala-discusses-trump-girls-education-muslim-ban-david-lettermans-show/|archivedate=14 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also criticised the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to education, saying that education is the first step to "eradicating extremism and ending poverty".

==Reception in Pakistan==
Reception of Yousafzai in Pakistan is mostly negative. Yousafzai's opposition to Taliban policy makes her unpopular among Taliban sympathisers.&lt;ref name=Almeida&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1049432/hating-malala |title=Hating Malala |author=Cyril Almeida |date=13 October 2013 |work=Dawn |accessdate=13 May 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229014709/http://www.dawn.com/news/1049432/hating-malala |archivedate=29 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Turk&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nation.com.pk/21-Apr-2018/seven-types-of-people-in-pakistan-who-hate-malala-yousufzai|title=Seven types of people in Pakistan who hate Malala Yousufzai|work=[[The Nation (Pakistan)|The Nation]]|last=Turk|first=Shoaib|date=21 April 2018|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Dawn'' columnist alleges that she is scapegoated by the failing state government,&lt;ref name=Almeida/&gt; and a journalist in ''The Nation'' wrote that Yousafzai is hated by "overzealous patriots" who are keen to deny oppression of women in the country.&lt;ref name=Turk/&gt; Yousafzai's statements conflict with the view that militancy in Pakistan is a result of Western interference,&lt;ref name=Star/&gt; and conservatives and Islamic fundamentalists describe her ideology as "anti-Pakistan" and "anti-Islam".&lt;ref name=Inayat/&gt;&lt;ref name="Khan Diver"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/30/malala-return-pakistan-finishing-studies-britain/|title=Malala to return to Pakistan after finishing her studies in Britain|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|last=Khan|first=Mohammad Zubair|last2=Diver|first2=Tony|date=30 March 2018|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the All Pakistan Private Schools Federation (APPSF) banned ''I Am Malala'' in all Pakistani private schools, and the president Mirza Kashif Ali released a book ''I Am Not Malala''.&lt;ref name="Ali 2018"/&gt; The book accuses Yousafzai of attacking Pakistan's army under the pretence of female education, describes her father as a "double agent" and a "traitor" and denounces the Malala Fund's promotion of secular education. However, Ali claimed that "we are not against her but the ideology being imposed on us" and pointed out that the APPSF went on a national strike when Yousafzai was attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/989876/i-am-not-malala-launched/|title=I am not Malala: Teachers release novel against Nobel Peace winner|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=12 November 2015|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Math for America''' ('''MfA''') is a nonprofit organization, founded in January 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Math for America Inc|url=http://www.guidestar.org/profile/20-0651886|publisher=GuideStar|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by American billionaire mathematician, [[hedge fund]] manager, and philanthropist [[James Harris Simons|Jim Simons]] with a mission to promote recruitment and retention of high quality mathematics teachers in New York City secondary schools.&lt;ref name=Bloom2007&gt;{{cite news|last1=Teitelbaum|first1=Richard|title=Simons at Renaissance Cracks Code, Doubling Assets|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ayjImYcoCiH8&amp;refer=home|work=Bloomberg News|date=November 27, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020152232/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ayjImYcoCiH8&amp;refer=home|archivedate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to Simons, he founded the program to address failures in the US education system to produce students highly qualified in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] skills and knowledge, which reduces America's ability to compete in the global economy.&lt;ref name="Seed2006"&gt;{{cite news   | last = Roekbe  | first = Joshua  | title = Putting his money where his math is  | publisher = [[Seed (magazine)|Seed]]   | date = September 19, 2006  | url = http://seedmagazine.com/news/2006/09/putting_his_money_where_his_ma.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He perceived the cause of the failure as low quality teachers, and saw that problem in turn as being caused by low salaries, lack of prestige, and lack of support and good training making the job unattractive to qualified candidates, many of whom could get jobs in lucrative fields like [[quantitative finance]].&lt;ref name="Seed2006"/&gt;  He created the program to provide math and science teachers with higher salaries and better training and funded it with $25M of his own money, adding an additional $25M in 2006.&lt;ref name="Seed2006"/&gt;  In the initial program, people who were accepted into the program who had degrees in math but were not teachers received a stipend of about $18,000 per year for five years from MfA in addition to their salaries and received free tuition to a high quality one year Master's program in teaching, as well as mentoring and professional development support after the first year.&lt;ref name=Bloom2007/&gt;  The five-year period was selected because that is the period during which most new teachers drop out; the starting salary of a NYC math teacher with a graduate degree was around $50,000 at that time.&lt;ref name="EducationWeek"&gt;{{cite news   | last = Muscarella  | first = Lauren   | title = Opportunities for Math and Science Teachers Increase  | publisher = [[Education Week]]   | date = September 13, 2007  | url = http://resources.topschooljobs.org/tsj/articles/2007/09/13/mathsci.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program also offered stipends to qualified existing teachers, to promote their retention in the field.&lt;ref name=Bloom2007/&gt;  People who were accepted into the program also had to agree that they would pay back some of the support they had received, if they dropped out of the program.&lt;ref name=EducationWeek2011/&gt;

By 2011 MfA had expanded to science fields as well as math, and organizations had been established and funded in San Diego, Los Angeles, Berkeley, Calif., Utah, Boston, and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name=EducationWeek2011&gt;{{cite news|last=Robelen|first=Erik|title=Fellowship Program Works to Beef Up Math Teaching|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2011/02/09/20math_ep.h30.html?qs=math_for_america|accessdate=August 9, 2011|newspaper=Education Week|date=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each site was autonomous, with its own board, fund-raising, and programs tailored to address local needs, but all coordinated with the founding organization and received funding from the Simons Foundation.&lt;ref name=EducationWeek2011/&gt;  It had also added two programs to support existing teachers in its New York City location: a Master Teacher Fellowship for experienced secondary school math teachers and the Early Career Fellowship for newer teachers.&lt;ref name=EducationWeek2011/&gt;

By 2012 the program was working with 330 teachers in the New York City schools, and due to hiring freezes in the school system, reduced the size of its new teacher program and expanded its program to provide stipends to existing teachers; it also announced that in 2013 it would expand to include science teachers and middle school teachers.&lt;ref name="WNYC2012"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.wnyc.org/story/302628-training-program-for-math-teachers-will-shift-its-focus/| title = Training Program for Math Teachers Will Shift Its Focus| last = Phillips| first = Anna| date = January 3, 2012| publisher = [[WNYC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  That year it also started a program offering $5,000 stipends to school administrators who attended seven MfA meetings per year.&lt;ref name="WNYC2012"/&gt;  Its budget before 2012 had been $20M per year and it planned to increase the budget to $30M per year to support the expansion for experienced teachers.&lt;ref name="WNYC2012"/&gt;

In 2013 New York State launched a state-funded "Master Teacher" program to provide stipends to qualified existing teachers modeled on MfA's program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harding|first1=Robert|title=Math for America's John Ewing discusses master teachers program; state launching program in fall 2013|url=http://auburnpub.com/blogs/eye_on_ny/math-for-america-s-john-ewing-discusses-master-teachers-program/article_3cbc4ad8-cd2d-11e2-a7d4-0019bb2963f4.html|work=The Auburn Citizen|date=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing financial support for MfA programs comes from private donors&lt;ref name=EducationWeek2011/&gt; and government grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Math for America" awarded grants|url=https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/simpleSearchResult?queryText=%22Math+for+America%22&amp;ActiveAwards=true|publisher=National Science Foundation|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Education''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Ministério da Educação''), '''MEC''', is a [[Cabinet of Brazil|cabinet]]-level [[federal government of Brazil|federal]] [[list of federal institutions of Brazil|ministry]] of [[Federative Republic of Brazil|Brazil]]. The current Minister of Education is [[Mendonça Filho]].

It is tasked with coordinating national [[education]] policy and daily affairs, from early childhood to the post-graduate level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seruniversitario.com.br MEC - Faculdades autorizadas]&lt;/ref&gt;

The acronym ''MEC'' used to refer to ''Ministério da Educação e Cultura,'' ({{lang-en|Ministry of Education and Culture}}), but it was split in 1985 into the Ministry of Education and [[Ministry of Culture (Brazil)|Ministry of Culture]]. The Ministry of Education retained the ''MEC'' acronym, while the Ministry of Culture got the acronym ''MinC''.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

'''Music schools in Scotland''' are available at several levels. Formal music education begins at 4½ years and can progress as high as postgraduate studies. Education in [[Scotland]] is a responsibility of the [[Scottish Government]]. Music is regarded as being an integral part of the [[culture of Scotland]].

==Music service==
Music services are working in almost all state schools and provide much of their instruction during the regular school day. Most of them offer instrumental tuition for pupils in their schools. On average one instrumental / vocal lesson lasts from 30 minutes and is usually given once a week.

A primary school is usually limited in the numbers of pupils they provide lessons to and lessons usually comprise a small group of 2 to 4 children.

Most independent (fee-paying) schools work on a similar basis to the above. Some independent schools such as [[Loretto School]]
also give music scholarships.

==Centres of excellence==

Scotland has six centres of excellence&amp;nbsp;– schools which allow gifted children to maximise their potential (four for music and one each for dance and sport).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/parentzone/yourchildatschool/choosingaschool/centresofexcellence/index.asp |title=About Centres for Excellence |publisher=[[Education Scotland]] |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These schools select a small number of pupils who show a special ability in music. Admission is by audition. The schools are located within [[comprehensive schools]] from which they receive normal academic classes. Students are attracted from within the local region and even nationally.

The music schools comprise:
*Douglas Academy Music School at [[Douglas Academy]], Milngavie, near Glasgow
*Aberdeen City Music School at [[Dyce Academy]] Aberdeen
*[[Sgoil Chiùil na Gàidhealtachd]] (National Centre of Excellence in Traditional Music) at [[Plockton High School]] Highland
*[[City of Edinburgh Music School]] at [[Broughton High School (Edinburgh)|Broughton High School]], Edinburgh and Flora Stevenson Primary, Edinburgh

The number of music students is relatively small in comparison with the host school. Secondary students at the City of Edinburgh Music school are 30-40 compared to 1,000 within the host High School,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edinburghmusicschool.co.uk/about/broughton-high.html |title=Broughton High |publisher=Edinburgh Music School |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the 1,000 students of Douglas Academy, around 50 are music specialists. Typically, music students receive individual instrument lessons, theory and practice time within the music school. The City of Edinburgh Music School is the only 'centre of excellence' which directly operates within a primary school. The schools are funded by the Local Education Authority within which they are located.

Douglas Academy Music School, Aberdeen City Music School and the National Centre of Excellence in Traditional Music all have Halls of Residence, and so are able to accommodate students from across Scotland.

==Specialist music school==
[[St Mary's Music School]] is an independent (private) specialist music school in Edinburgh, Scotland, for children aged 9–18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.st-marys-music-school.co.uk/school-info |title=School Information |publisher=[[St Mary's Music School]] |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school offers education to musically talented children and is the only specialist full-time music school in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aecsite.cramgo.nl/DownloadView.aspx?ses=18144  Overview of the musical pre-college phase in the United Kingdom] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720165233/http://aecsite.cramgo.nl/DownloadView.aspx?ses=18144 |date=2011-07-20 }}, retrieved 2009-10-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/mds/history.shtml  History of the Music and Dance Scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201184034/http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/mds/history.shtml |date=2009-12-01 }}, retrieved 2009-10-20&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their main studies, students receive intensive instruction on a solo instrument and a program of music according to their age. This includes ear training, chamber music, chorus, composition, jazz and music technology.

Entry is solely by audition. Successful applicants receive financial support through the Scottish Government’s Aided Places Scheme. Students combine both academic and music studies within the school. The school is also the choir school of St. Mary's Episcopal Cathedral and all its 70 students are either instrumentalists or choristers. It attracts its pupils nationally, from the rest of the UK and abroad.

St Mary's is a member of the UK Music and Dance Excellence (MADE) Schools &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.made-schools.org.uk  Music and Dance Excellence Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117171230/http://www.made-schools.org.uk/ |date=2010-01-17 }}, retrieved 2009-10-20&lt;/ref&gt; and is within the tradition of other specialist music schools throughout Europe such as the Dresden Music Gymnasium; [[Sächsisches Landesgymnasium für Musik "Carl Maria von Weber"]] or the [[Yehudi Menuhin School]], England

==Private tuition==
Amateur or Private Schools of Music offers music education outside the general education system for students aged 4 to 20 + years. In general, students attend these schools, weekend or evening. The schools are, for example those provided by individuals, charitable or commercial organizations. Examples include the [[North East of Scotland Music School]], Portobello Music School, [[Dunbar Music School]]  and Yamaha Music School.

In addition qualified teachers provide musical training outside of an establishment or the mainstream education system for pupils aged 4 to 20+ years. The objective of education varies from amateur to training (pre-) professional music training, according to the personal ambitions of students.

==Universities and colleges==
A number of universities have music departments and offer degrees in music&amp;nbsp;— Bachelor, Master and Doctorate. They may be performance related and/or music theory which can be combined with other subjects, or they may be hybrid courses incorporating performance along with business and entrepreneurial skills. Scottish universities offering degrees include:

*[[University of Glasgow]], [[Glasgow]] established 1451
*[[University of Aberdeen]], [[Aberdeen]] established 1495
*[[University of Edinburgh]], [[Edinburgh]] established 1583
*[[University of Strathclyde]], [[Glasgow]] incorporated as university 1964, established 1796
*[[Edinburgh Napier University]], [[Edinburgh]] incorporated as university 1992, established 1964
*[[University of the West of Scotland]], [[Ayr]]
*[[University of the Highlands and Islands]], [[Inverness]]

There are a number of colleges offering popular and contemporary music courses in Scotland at NQ, National Certificate, Higher National Certificate and Higher National Diploma level. Many of these courses may specialise within a particular area of music, such as the Electronic Music and Recording course at [[Clydebank College]]. Scottish colleges offering these courses include:

*[[Ayrshire College]]
*[[Dundee and Angus College]]
*[[Edinburgh College]]
*[[Forth Valley College]]
*[[Glasgow Clyde College]]
*[[Glasgow Kelvin College]]
*[[Lews Castle College]]
*[[New College Lanarkshire]]
*[[North East Scotland College]]
*[[North Highland College]]
*[[Perth College UHI]]
*[[West College Scotland]]

==Conservatoire==
The [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland]] (RCS), formerly known as the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, is Scotland’s [[conservatoire]] of music, theatre and dance. Although there is some overlap with the music departments of Universities, the Conservatoire seeks to be practical and focuses on career development. In 1993, as the RSAMD, it was first in the United Kingdom which was granted to give their own degrees. Research degrees are validated by the University of St Andrews.

==Junior conservatoire==
The [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland]] operates a Junior Conservatoire, with classes on Saturdays during term-time. Approximately 250 students attend and the academy is intended for those children with above average musical ability and potential. The school day may include choir, theory and musicianship classes and principal study lesson. The day may also include orchestral and chamber music rehearsals.

==Military==
The [[Army School of Bagpipe Music and Highland Drumming]] is a training centre of the British Army. Instructions in the military music of Scottish piper bagpipes and pipe bands is available.

{{Nationalism sidebar |Development|nocat=false}} 
A '''national language''' is a [[language]] (or [[variety (linguistics)|language variant]], e.g. [[dialect]]) that has some connection—[[de facto]] or [[de jure]]—with people and the territory they occupy. There is little consistency in the use of this term. One or more languages spoken as  [[first language]]s in the territory of a country may be referred to informally or designated in legislation as national languages of the country. National or [[national language]]s are mentioned in over 150 world constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/index.html Jacques Leclerc, ''L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde'', CEFAN, Université Laval]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- it would be helpful to narrow this down to just the number of constitutions that mention "national language," or to be precise as to the number of constitutions mentioning each or both, and it would be helpful to look for better sources --&gt;

[[C.M.B. Brann]], with particular reference to India, suggests that there are "four quite distinctive meanings" for national language in a polity:&lt;ref&gt;Brann, C.M.B. 1994. "The National Language Question: Concepts and Terminology." ''Logos'' [University of Namibia, Windhoek] Vol 14: 125–134&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Territorial language" (''chthonolect'', sometimes known as ''chtonolect''&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, H. Ekkehard "African Languages: An Introduction Ch./Art: Language and Society p. 321 pub. Cambridge University Press 2000&lt;/ref&gt;) of a particular people
*"[[Regional language]]" (''choralect'')
*"Language-in-common or community language" (''demolect'') used throughout a country
*"Central language" (''politolect'') used by government and perhaps having a symbolic value.
The last is usually given the title of [[official language]].

[[Standard language]]s, such as [[Standard German]], [[Standard French]], and [[Standard Spanish]], may serve as national (language-in-common), regional, and international languages.

== Official versus national languages ==
{{See also|Linguistic prescription|Linguistic rights}}
"National language" and "[[official language]]" are best understood as two concepts or legal categories with ranges of meaning that may coincide, or may be intentionally separate. [[Stateless nation]]s are not in the position to legislate an [[official language]], but their languages may be sufficiently distinct and well-preserved to be national languages. Some languages may be recognized popularly as "national languages," while others may enjoy official recognition in use or promotion.

In many African countries, some or all indigenous [[African languages]] are officially used, promoted, or expressly allowed to be promoted (usually taught in schools and written in important publications) as semi-official languages whether by long-term legislation or short-term, case-by-case executive (government) measures. 
To be official, spoken and written languages may enjoy government or federalised use, major tax-funded promotion or at least full tolerance as to their teaching and employers' recognition in [[public education]], standing on equal footing with the official language(s). Further, they may enjoy recognition as a language used in compulsory schooling and treasury money may be spent to teach or encourage adults in learning a language which is a minority language in a particular area to restore its understanding and spread its moral stories, rhymes, poems, phrases, songs, and other literary heritage which will promote [[social cohesion]] (where other languages remain) or will promote [[nationalism|nationalist differentiation]] where another, non-indigenous language is deprecated.&lt;ref&gt;''20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language'' http://www.plean2028.ie/en/node/14{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Williams | first = Colin H. | editor-last = Coupland | editor-first = Nikolas | title = English in Wales: Diversity, Conflict, and Change | place = Clevedon, Avon | publisher = Multilingual Matters | year = 1990 | contribution = The Anglicisation of Wales | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tPwYt3gVbu4C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=monoglot+welsh+speakers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=G1SHcB_0Rl&amp;sig=TiQ9apFsrgJiFz1ielo2OZCPRq8 | pages = 38–41 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tPwYt3gVbu4C&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;ots=G1SHcB_0Rl&amp;dq=monoglot%20welsh%20speakers&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
Australia has no [[official language]], but is largely [[monoglottism|monolingual]] with English being the ''de facto'' national language. A considerable proportion of first and second generation migrants are bilingual. According to Ethnologue, 81% of people spoke English at home, including [[second language|L2]] speakers. Other languages spoken at home included Chinese 2.9%, Italian 1.2%, Arabic 1.1%, Greek 1%, Vietnamese 0.9% and Spanish 0.4%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2011/quickstat/0&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bulgaria ===
[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] is the national language in [[Bulgaria]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Nationalisms in Canada|Bilingualism in Canada|Languages of Canada}}
[[Canada]]'s official languages since the [[Official Languages Act of 1969]] are [[English language|English]] ([[Canadian English]]) and [[French language|French]] ([[Canadian French]]).  Depending on one's views of what constitutes a "nation", these two languages may be considered two equal national languages of the nation of Canada, or the national languages of two nations within one state, [[English Canada]] and [[French Canada]].

[[Quebec nationalists]] consider [[Quebec French]] the language of the Quebec nation.

Two of Canada's northern territories legislate a variety of Indigenous languages. [[Nunavut]] holds [[Inuktitut]] and [[Inuinnaqtun]] as official languages, and [[Northwest Territories]] has nine official languages aside from English and French: [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Chipewyan language|Dënesųłiné]], [[Gwich’in language|Gwich’in]], Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, [[Slavey language|North and South Slavey]] and [[Dogrib language|Tłı̨chǫ]]. As these official languages are legislated at a territorial (sub-federal) level, they can be construed as national languages.

Besides these there many [[Aboriginal peoples of Canada|Indigenous languages of Canada]] which are the national languages of one or more of Canada's [[First Nations]] groups, [[Inuit]] and [[Metis people (Canada)|Métis]] (mixed First Nations-European peoples); a number of First Nations legislate at the Indigenous government levels their language as an official language of the Nation, such is the case with the [[Nisg̱a’a language]] in [[Nisg̱a’a]]. Notably the [[Cree language]] is spoken (with variations) from Alberta to Labrador,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} [[Ojibwe language|Anishinaabemowin]] is spoken across central Canada and Inuktitut is spoken across the arctic.

=== China ===
{{see also|Languages of China|Standard Chinese|History of Mandarin}}
There are many languages spoken across [[China]], with most people speaking one of several [[varieties of Chinese]]. During successive imperial dynasties, the spoken language of the capital city served as the official spoken language and was used across the country by government officials who traveled to communicate with one another. Dialects used for this purpose in different eras included those of [[Xi'an]], [[Luoyang]], [[Nanjing]], [[Beijing]], and [[Historical capitals of China|other historical capital cities]].

After the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911, the [[Kuomintang]] (Chinese nationalists) founded the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. In order to promote a sense of national unity and enhance the efficiency of communications within the nation, the government decided to designate a national language. The [[Beijing dialect]] of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Cantonese|Guangzhou dialect]] of [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] were each proposed as the basis for a national language for China.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} In the beginning, there were attempts to introduce elements from other Chinese varieties into the national language in addition to those from the Beijing dialect; this was reflected in the first official dictionary of the national language, given the name 國語 ([[Pinyin]]: Guóyǔ, literally "national language"). But this artificial language had no native speakers and was difficult to learn, so it was abandoned in 1924. Ultimately, the Beijing dialect was chosen as the national language and it continued to be referred to as 國語 in Chinese in the Republic of China. Since then, the Beijing dialect has become the main standard for pronunciation, due to its prestigious status during the preceding [[Qing Dynasty]].

Still, elements from other dialects do exist in the standard language, which is now defined as reflecting the pronunciation of Beijing, the grammatical patterns of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] dialects spoken in the northern parts of China, and the vocabulary of modern vernacular Chinese literature. The People's Republic of China renamed the national language 普通话 (Pinyin: Pǔtōnghuà, literally "common speech"), without otherwise changing the definition of the standard national language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

English ([[Philippine English]]) was also designated as an official language, "until otherwise provided by law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/1973-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-2/|title=1973 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines|at=Article XV, Section 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1987 constitution designated the [[Filipino language]], which is based on Tagalog with the inclusion of terms from all recognized [[languages of the Philippines]], as the national language. It also designated both Filipino and English as the official languages for purposes of communication and instruction, and designated the regional languages as auxiliary official languages in the regions to serve as auxiliary media of instruction therein.

More than 170 [[Languages of the Philippines|languages]] are spoken in the [[Philippines]] and almost all of them belong to the [[Borneo–Philippines languages]] group of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family. In 2007, a six-part series titled ''The Case of Ilokano as a National Language'' authored by Dr. Aurelio Solver Agcaoili of the University of Hawaii appeared in the Culture, Essays, Lifestyle of Tawid News Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Aurelio Solver Agcaoili, ''The Case of Ilokano as a National Language''; Part {{plain link|http://www.aurelioagcaoili.com/2007/04/case-of-ilokano-as-national-language.html|1}}, {{plain link|http://tawidnewsmag.com/2007/05/the-case-of-ilokano-as-a-national-language-part-2/|2}}, {{plain link|http://tawidnewsmag.com/2007/05/the-case-of-ilokano-as-a-national-language-part-3|3}}, {{plain link|http://tawidnewsmag.com/2007/05/the-case-of-ilokano-as-a-national-language-part-4|4}}, {{plain link|http://tawidnewsmag.com/2007/05/the-case-of-ilokano-as-a-national-language-part-5|5}}, {{plain link|http://tawidnewsmag.com/2007/05/the-case-of-ilokano-as-a-national-language-part-6|6}} (May 2007), [http://tawidnewsmag.com/ Tawid News Magasin]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, [[La Union]] became the first province in Philippine history to pass an ordinance proclaiming a local language and a [[vernacular]], [[Ilokano language|Ilokano]], as an [[official language]]. This move aims to protect and revitalize the use of Ilokano in various government and civil affairs within the province.&lt;ref name="launionofficiallanguage"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/article.aspx?publicationsubcategoryid=67&amp;articleid=850366 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012035232/http://www.philstar.com/nation/article.aspx?publicationsubcategoryid=67&amp;articleid=850366 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=October 12, 2013 | title=Iloko La Union's official language | newspaper=[[Philippine Star]] | date=September 19, 2012 | accessdate=September 24, 2012 | author=Elias, Jun }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Singapore ===
{{Main|Languages of Singapore}}
[[Singapore]] has four official languages: [[English language|English]] ([[Singapore English]]), [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]], [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. Although English is the primary language of business, government, and education, Malay is designated as the national language. This is due to the geographical and historical ties to [[Malaysia]] as well as the recognition of ethnic [[Malays in Singapore|Malays]] (about 14% of the population) as the indigenous people of Singapore.

Traditionally, the [[lingua franca]] among the different ethnic groups in Singapore was [[Malay trade and creole languages|Bazaar Malay]], a Malay-based [[Malay-based creole languages|creole]]. Since independence, the government has been promoting English as the main language of Singapore. The bilingual education policy requires students to study two languages: English and a "mother tongue" corresponding to the student's ethnicity. Malay is only offered to non-Malay students as an optional third language in secondary schools. As a result, English has displaced Bazaar Malay as the common language among Singaporeans. Therefore, despite the status of Malay as the national language, the majority doesn't speak it.

{{Main|Languages of Switzerland}}

[[Switzerland]] has four national languages: [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Romansh language|Romansh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation, article 4 |url = http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/101/a4.html |accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which have official status at the national level within the [[Federal administration of Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diversité des langues et compétences linguistiques en Suisse |url=http://www.nfp56.ch/f_projekt.cfm?kati=3|accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority (74%) of the population speaks German, while most of the remainder (21%) speak French, and minorities speak Italian (4%) and Romansh (1%, not monolingually).

=== Taiwan ===
During [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] (1895 to 1945), the {{nihongo|"national language movement"|國語運動|kokugo undō}} promoted the [[Japanese language]]. After their defeat in the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949, the [[Kuomintang]] regime of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] retreated to the island of [[Taiwan]], where they introduced [[Standard Chinese]], which was spoken by few of the island population at the time, as the new "national language".

In 2017, the [[Formosan languages|Indigenous languages]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indigenous Languages Development Act|url= https://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawContent.aspx?PCODE=D0130037|website=Laws &amp; Regulations Database of The Republic of China|accessdate= 23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Taiwanese Hakka]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hakka Basic Act |url= https://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawContent.aspx?PCODE=D0140005|website=Laws &amp; Regulations Database of The Republic of China|accessdate= 23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; were recognized as national languages.

[[Turkish language|Turkish]] is the national language of [[Turkey]] per the Turkish constitution.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main|Languages of the United Kingdom}}
The [[English language]] ([[British English]]) is the ''de facto'' official language of the [[United Kingdom]] and is the sole language of an estimated 95% of the [[British people|British]] population.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The three [[Home Nations]] outside England have national languages of their own with varying degrees of recognition, which coexist with the dominant English language. Britain also has several [[Crown dependencies]] and [[British Overseas Territories|Overseas Territories]] which are to some extent self-governing, but which are not recognized as independent states. Many of these have their own [[regional language]]s.

====Northern Ireland====
In [[Northern Ireland]], both the Gaelic [[Irish language in Northern Ireland|Irish language]] and the West Germanic [[Ulster Scots dialects]] are recognized by the [[Good Friday Agreement]] as "part of the cultural wealth of the island of Ireland" and are promoted by the [[Foras na Gaeilge]] (Irish Institute) and [[Tha Boord o Ulstèr-Scotch]] (the Ulster-Scots Agency) respectively.

====Scotland====
In Scotland, [[Scottish Gaelic]] is a minority language spoken by 57,375 people (1.1% of the Scottish population aged over three years old).&lt;ref name="2011 Census of Scotland"&gt;[http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/ods-web/data-warehouse.html 2011 Census of Scotland], Table QS211SC.  Viewed 30 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005]] gives the language a limited official status, and the [[Bòrd na Gàidhlig]] is tasked with "securing the status of the Gaelic language as an [[official language]] of [[Scotland]] commanding equal respect to the English language".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2005/asp_20050007_en_1 |title=Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=9 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907081446/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2005/asp_20050007_en_1 |archivedate= 7 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scots language|Scots]], generally treated as a [[West Germanic language]] related to but separate from English, has no official status but is recognized as a minority language, and is the language of much [[Scottish literature]], including the poetry of [[Robert Burns]].

====Crown dependencies: Isle of Man====
English is ''de facto'' the only official language. However a few words of Manx Gaelic (the historical national language) are sometimes encountered in Government institutions, largely for symbolic and ceremonial purposes, and it is the main medium of instruction in one primary school.

=== Uganda ===
{{Main|Languages of Uganda}}

The national language of [[Uganda]] is English.

=== Ukraine ===
{{Main|Ukrainian Language|Russian Language}}

Ukrainian is the only official language of [[Ukraine]], but [[Russian language|Russian]] is also widely spoken all over the country especially in the regions to the east of [[Dnieper]].

=== United States ===
{{Main|Languages of the United States}}

In the [[United States]], English ([[American English]]) is the national language only in an informal sense, by numbers and by historical and contemporary association. The [[United States Constitution]] does not explicitly declare any [[official language]], although the constitution is written in English, as is all federal legislation.

{{as of|2015|alt=On February 13, 2015}}, Representative [[Peter T. King]] introduced H.R.997, the ''English Language Unity Act of 2015'', in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. This bill would establish English as the official language of the United States. A companion bill, S.678, was introduced by Senator [[Jim Inhofe]] in the [[United States Senate]] on March 9, 2015. Both bills were referred to committee. Similar legislation has been introduced every year since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/search?q=%7B%22source%22%3A%22legislation%22%2C%22search%22%3A%22h.r.997%22%7D|title=All legislation matching 'H.R.997'|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam ===
In [[Vietnam]], the [[Vietnamese language]] had been the de facto national language for many years, but it was not until Decree No. 5 of the 2013 constitution that the [[Vietnamese language]] was officially described as the National Language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vnexpress.net/tin-tuc/thoi-su/quoc-hoi-thong-qua-hien-phap-sua-doi-2916328-p2.html|title=Toàn văn Hiến pháp sửa đổi|work=Tin nhanh VnExpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7473">In [[Denmark]] (including [[Greenland]] and [[Faroe Islands]]), '''pharmaconomists''' ({{lang-da|farmakonom}}) are  experts in pharmaceuticals ({{lang-da|lægemiddelkyndig}}) who have trained with a 3-year [[Higher education|tertiary degree]]. '''Pharmaconomy''' ({{lang-da|farmakonomi}}) describes either their professional practice or their training courses.

==Work==
The majority of the Danish pharmaconomists work at [[Pharmacy|community pharmacies]] ([[Chemist (disambiguation)|chemists' shops]] or drug stores) and at [[Hospital pharmacy|hospital pharmacies]] and [[hospital]]s.

Some pharmaconomists work within the [[chemical industry]], the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and in [[Medical laboratory|medical or clinical laboratories]].

Other pharmaconomists [[Teacher|teach]] pharmacy students and pharmaconomy students at [[college]]s or [[University|universities]], such as at the University of Copenhagen's [[University of Copenhagen Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences|Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences]] or at the Pharmakon—Danish College of Pharmacy Practice.

Pharmaconomists are also employed by the Danish [[Ministry of Interior and Health (Denmark)|Ministry of Interior and Health]], [[Danish Medicines Agency]] and [[Danish Association of Pharmacies]].

Some pharmaconomists do work as [[pharmaceutical consultant]]s.

==Education==
The 3 year higher education corresponds to 180 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS points (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System)]].

===Pharmakon—Danish College of Pharmacy Practice===
During his or her [[education]] programme at [[Pharmakon—Danish College of Pharmacy Practice]], the pharmaconomist student studies [[human]] and [[animal]] [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]], [[pharmacology]], [[pharmaconomy]], [[pharmacy practice]], [[pharmaceutics]], [[toxicology]], [[pharmacognosy]], [[clinical pharmacy]], [[pharmacotherapy]], [[pharmaceutical sciences]], [[chemistry]], [[pharmaceutical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], [[biology]], [[microbiology]], [[molecular biology]], [[genetics]], [[Cell biology|cytology]], [[medicine]], [[veterinary medicine]], [[zoology]], [[diagnosis]], [[medical prescription]], [[Law|pharmacy law]], [[medical sociology]], [[patient safety]], [[health care]], [[psychology]], [[psychiatry]], [[pedagogy]], [[communication]], [[Information technology|information technology (IT)]], [[bioethics]], [[medical ethics]], [[safety]], [[leadership]], [[organization]], [[logistics]], [[economy]], [[Quality assurance|quality assurance (QA)]], [[sales]] and [[marketing]].

==What is the difference between a ''pharmaconomist'' and a ''pharmacist''?==
There are two different professional groups with pharmaceutical education in Denmark:
* Pharmaconomists (with a 3-year higher tertiary education)
* [[Pharmacist]]s (with a 5-year higher tertiary education)
Due to his or her higher education as a [[health profession]]al, the pharmaconomist has by law the same [[Independent business|independent]] competence in all Danish pharmacies as a pharmacist — [[List of Latin phrases (F–O)#I|i.e.]] for example to dispense and check medical prescriptions, to counsel and advise [[patient]]s/[[customer]]s about the use of medicine/pharmaceuticals and to dispense, sell and provide [[information]] about medical prescriptions and about [[Prescription drug|prescription medicine]] and [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter medicine (OTC)]].

The pharmaconomist also undertakes specialist and [[Management|managerial]] operation of pharmacies and undertakes managerial [[duty]] service.

The only difference by law is that only a pharmacist may ''own'' a Danish pharmacy — i.e. become a pharmacy owner.

Like pharmacists, pharmaconomists can work as pharmacy managers and [[Human resource management|HR managers]] (or as chief pharmaconomists).

==Trade union==
The [[Danish Association of Pharmaconomists]] is a [[trade union]] who represents about 5,700 pharmaconomists in Denmark (i.e. 98% of all Danish pharmaconomists).


==Translation into other languages==
The Danish title ''farmakonom'' (pharmaconomist) comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "pharmakon" (meaning "pharmaceuticals") and "nom" (meaning "expert in").

In Denmark a pharmaconomist is also referred to as ''lægemiddelkyndig'' (expert in pharmaceuticals). ''Lægemiddelkyndig'' comes from the Danish "lægemiddel" (meaning "pharmaceuticals") and "kyndig" (meaning "expert in").

'''Preppy''' (also spelled '''preppie''') or '''prep''' (all abbreviations of the word ''preparatory'') refers to a  [[subculture]] in the [[United States]] associated with old [[private education|private]] [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] [[university-preparatory school]]s. The terms are used to denote a person seen as characteristic of a student or [[alumnus]] of these schools. Characteristics of preps in the past include a particular [[Subculture|subcultural]] speech, vocabulary, dress, mannerisms, [[etiquette]], reflective of an [[American upper class|upper-class]] upbringing.&lt;ref name="colman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Colman |first=David |title=The All-American Back From Japan |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/fashion/18codes.html |work= [[The New York Times]] |date=17 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
The term ''preppy'' derives from the private, university-preparatory or ''prep'' schools that some [[American upper class]] and [[American upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] children attend.&lt;ref name=FashionEncyclopedia&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/Modern-World-1946-1960/Preppy-Look.html |title= Preppy Look| work= Fashion Encyclopedia | access-date= December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''preppy'' is commonly associated with the [[Ivy League]] and [[Colonial Colleges|oldest universities in the Northeast]] and the prep schools which fed students to them,&lt;ref name= Hogan&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mensflair.com/style-advice/the-roots-of-american-preppy.php| first= Chris| last= Hogan| title=  The Roots of American Preppy| website= MensFlair.com| publisher= Men's Flair | date= | access-date= December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; since traditionally a primary goal in attending a prep school was admittance into one of these institutions.&lt;ref name= FashionEncyclopedia /&gt; Preppy fashion derives from the fashions of these old Northeastern colleges in the early to mid-twentieth century. Lisa Birnbach's 1980 book ''[[Official Preppy Handbook]]'', which was written to poke fun at the rich lives of privileged Ivy League and socially elite liberal arts college students but ended up glamorizing the culture, portrays the preppy social group as well-educated, well-connected, and although exclusive, courteous to other social groups without fostering serious relationships with them. Being well-educated and well-connected is associated with an upper-class [[socioeconomic status]] that emphasizes [[higher education]] and high-income professional success.&lt;ref name= Hogan /&gt;

== Fashion ==

For men, preppy fashion has its roots in the [[Ivy League (clothes)|Ivy League style of dress]], which started around 1912 and [[1945-1960 in fashion#Ivy League|became more established in the late 1950s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =Elements of Fashion and Apparel Design | publisher = New Age Publishers | isbn = 81-224-1371-4 |page=25 |quote=Ivy League: A popular look for men in the fifties that originated on such campuses as Harvard, Priceton {{sic}} and Yale; a forerunner to the preppie look; a style characterized by button down collar shirts and pants with a small buckle in the back.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Press]] represented the quintessential Ivy League style, stemming from the collegiate traditions of [[Ivy League]] schools. In the mid-twentieth century [[J. Press]] and [[Brooks Brothers]] both had stores on [[Ivy League]] school campuses, including [[Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and [[Yale]]. Preppy fashion emerged in the late 1970s with cues from the original Ivy League style. Some typical preppy styles also reflect traditional upper-class leisure activities, once associated with the wealthy English who once had a strong political and social position in the Northeast and New England, such as [[polo]], [[sailing]], [[hunting]], [[fencing]], [[rowing (sport)|crew rowing]], [[lacrosse]], [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[squash (sport)|squash]]&lt;ref name= Hogan /&gt; and [[swimming (sport)|swimming]]. This association with old English inspired outdoor activities can be seen in preppy fashion, through stripes and colors, equestrian clothing, plaid shirts, field jackets, and nautical-themed accessories. By the 1980s, mass marketing of brands such as [[Lacoste]], [[Daniel Cremieux]], [[Izod]],&lt;ref name="Peterson Kellogg 285"&gt;{{cite book |author1= Peterson, Amy T. |author2=Ann T.

For women, preppy-influenced fashions emerged in the 1960s, a trend led by designers such as [[Perry Ellis]] and [[Lilly Pulitzer]], influenced by designers such as [[Oleg Cassini]], and popularized by female students at the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters Colleges]], sister institutions to the [[Ivy League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of New York State |year=2005 |publisher=Syracuse University Press |isbn=978-0-8156-0808-0 |page=550 |editor1-first= Peter R.| editor1-last= Eisenstadt |editor2-first= Laura-Eve| editor2-last= Moss }}&lt;/ref&gt; These classic ensembles of the 1960s and 1970s include tailored skirt suits, low heels, wrap dresses, shift dresses, silk or cotton blouses, and jewelry with a refined style. Such clothing often includes elements drawn from typical preppy style, such as nautical stripes, pastel colours, or equestrian details.

Though traditional interest in preppy style fell in the 1990s,{{according to whom|date=October 2015}} some of the newer outfitters such as [[Polo Ralph Lauren|Ralph Lauren]], [[J. Crew]], [[Vineyard Vines]], [[Gant (retailer)|Gant]], and Elizabeth McKay are perceived as having preppy styles, with designers such as [[Marc Jacobs]] and [[Luella Bartley]] adding the preppy style into their clothes in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Camille |date= December 2, 2010| title= The Preppy Look: A Brief History |url= http://www.camillereads.com/2010/12/preppy-look-brief-history.html| website= CamilleReads.com |accessdate= December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of preppy attire include [[Argyle (pattern)|argyle]] [[sweater]]s, crewneck sweaters, [[grosgrain]] or woven leather belts, [[chinos]],&lt;ref name= Hogan /&gt; [[madras (cloth)|madras]],&lt;ref name= colman /&gt; [[Nantucket Reds]],&lt;ref name= colman /&gt; [[button down]]&lt;ref name= Hogan /&gt; [[Oxford (cloth)|Oxford cloth]] shirts,&lt;ref name="Peterson Kellogg 285" /&gt;  pearl necklaces and earrings, gold bangle or large chain bracelets, [[penny loafers]], polo shirts (often with a popped collar), and [[boat shoes]].&lt;ref name= colman /&gt;

'''Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan''' (RMSA) ([[translation]]: National 

''Mission for Secondary Education'') is a [[Centrally Sponsored Scheme|centrally sponsored scheme]] of the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Ministry of Human Resource Development]], [[Government of India]], for the development of [[secondary education]] in public schools throughout India. It was launched in March 2009. The implementation of the scheme has started from 2009-2010 to provide conditions for an efficient growth, development and equity for all. The scheme includes a multidimensional research, technical consulting, various implementations and funding support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rmsaindia.org/en/about-rmsa.html rmsaindia.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The principal objectives are to enhance quality of secondary education and increase the total enrollment rate from 52% (as of 2005–2006) to 75% in five years, i.e. from 2009–2014.&lt;ref name="mhrd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan|url=http://india.gov.in/scheme/rashtriya-madhyamik-shiksha-abhiyan|publisher=National Informatics Centre|accessdate=2 February 2014|author=Ministry of Human Resource Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to provide universal education for all children between 15–16 years of age.&lt;ref name="edcil"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan|url=http://edcilindia.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=71&amp;Itemid=9|publisher=EdCIL (India) Limited|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funding from the central ministry is provided through state governments, which establish separate implementing agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan|url=http://www.indianyojana.com/shiksha-yojana/rashtriya-madhyamik-shiksha-abhiyan.htm|publisher=Indian Yojana|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total budget allocated during the [[Five-Year plans of India|XI Five Year Plan]] (2002-2007) was {{INRConvert|2012|b}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RSMA)|url=http://www.bmsprmsa.in/rmsa.htm|publisher=Bihar Madyamik Siksha Parishad|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==

The objectives of Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan can be summarised as follows:&lt;ref name=edcil/&gt;

#To improve quality of education imparted at secondary level through making all secondary schools conform to prescribed norms.
#To remove gender, socio-economic and disability barriers.
#Universal access to secondary level education by 2017, i.e., by the end of the XII Five Year Plan.
#Universal retention of students by 2020.

== Planning for secondary education ==

=== Background ===
* Since the initiation of the [[National Policy on Education]] (NPE), 1986, there have been no major changes in the structure and organization of the secondary and higher secondary school systems under the Ninth Plan period.
* The focus in this plan was on minimising the various disparities, to renew the curricula giving importance to [[Vocational education|vocationalisation]] and employment-oriented courses. It also gives importance to expanding and diversifying the [[open learning]] system, teacher training and ICT. Free education and hostel facilities for girls and integrated education for the disabled children was also brought into highlight, etc.

=== Participation of private sector ===
* There was an increased participation of the private sector including non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Currently, these private sectors manage around 51% of the secondary schools and 58% of the higher secondary schools. 
* Opportunities were provided for those children who were not able to enroll themselves in formal education systems through national and state open schools by utilising contact-centres and multi-media packages. 
* It highly emphasized on the content, process and the quality of education especially the environment education, science, mathematics and computer literacy with the financial help from the central government.
* After the revised NPE policy, 1992, new initiatives like revision of curriculum, resource centres for value education and National Centre for Computer-aided Education etc. have been taken up. 
* The appeal lacks in the vocationalisation of education due to the lack of manpower demand and academic restraints etc. Hence, by 2000, only 10% of the students opt for the vocational streams against 25%.

=== Planning for children with special needs (CWSN) ===
* With the enactment of the Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995, the education for the CWSN received an impetus. This act entrusts certain governments and authorities for the provision of free access for these children towards education, allotted lands for certain purposes, non-discrimination in transports, financial incentive for them to undertake research etc. 
* This scheme has also taken up programmes for the attitudinal changes and capacity building among teachers for the sake of these children.&lt;ref name="rmsaindia.org"&gt;http://rmsaindia.org/administrator/components/com_pdf/pdf/Planning%20for%20Secondary%20Education.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Four major heads == 
* '''Quality improvement:'''
In school, there was promotion of the science laboratories, environmental education, promotion of [[yoga]], as well as centrally sponsored schemes of population education project, [[International Mathematical Olympiad|international mathematics]] and [[International Science Olympiad|science olympiads]]. The state governments provide in-service training for the teachers and provide infrastructure and research inputs.
* '''Information communication technologies (ICT):''' 
ICT comprises the centrally sponsored schemes like computer education and literacy in schools (CLASS) and educational technology (ET) which familiarizes the student with Information technology (IT). Due to the rise in IT demand in today's world, a major importance is given on it. Components of a merged scheme ICT in school include a) funding support towards computer education plans; b) strengthening and reorientation of the staffs of SIETS - state institutes of education and training; c) there is digitalisation of SIETs audio and video cassettes with the partnership of NGOs; and d) management of internet-based education by SIETs.&lt;ref name="rmsaindia.org"/&gt;
* '''Access and equity:'''
RMSA not only emphasizes on providing secondary education for the special focus groups that include [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|scheduled tribe and scheduled caste groups]], [[Minority group|minority]] girls and CWSN children, but it also give importance on removing the existing disparities in socio-economic and gender background in the secondary level of education. They are termed as the vulnerable/ disadvantaged group. Certain strategies were implemented to provide free access towards secondary education and they are given as following steps:
# Identification of the disadvantaged groups: For this purpose, educational indicators like gross enrollment ratio (GER), net enrollment ratio (NER), drop-out rate, retention rate, gender parity index (GPI), gender gap, etc. were analysed.
# Need assessment: This is the critical step to prepare for the equity plan where the factors affecting the education of this group of children were evaluated with the involvement of the community members, teachers, civil society, etc. 
# Strategising for the addressing gaps: Since there are multiple interwoven factors that cause the un-equitable condition in this scenario, the strategy was called to have a set of multi-dimensional activities. 
# Project-based proposal: Development of a project-based strategy enables the RMSA to call for an evidence-based and outcome-oriented strategy.&lt;ref&gt;http://rmsaindia.org/administrator/components/com_pdf/pdf/Equity_Action_Plan_2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Integrated education for disabled children (IEDC):'''
Inclusive education have been highlighted to bring about expansion in terms of meeting/catering to the needs of the mentally and physically disadvantaged children. This schemes continues to be a separate centrally sponsored scheme. It includes several components  for convergence with integrated child development services for early interventions, [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]] (SSA) for the particular group at the elementary level, and special schools.

==Funding method==

The Ministry of Human Resource Development directly provides funds to the state governments. Each state government then release the funds to the approved implementing agencies or institutions. During the XI Five Year Plan the central government provided 75% of the total fund for each state, while 25% was borne by the state as matching share. However, in the remote [[northeast India|northeastern states]] and [[Sikkim]] the matching share was waived to 10%.&lt;ref name=kaswan&gt;{{cite web|title=Rashtriya Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyan (RMSA)|url=http://www.simplydecoded.com/2013/05/04/rashtriya-madhyamik-siksha-abhiyan-rmsa/|publisher=Simply Decoded|accessdate=2 February 2014|author=Parveen Kaswan|date=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Union cabinet approves Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan proposal|url=http://www.indiaeducationreview.com/news/union-cabinet-approves-rashtriya-madhyamik-shiksha-abhiyan-proposal|accessdate=2 February 2014|newspaper=Indian Education Review|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
Achievements of RMSA listed in its 2015-2016 report&lt;ref&gt;[http://rmsaindia.org/en/component/content/article.html?id=126 rmsaindia.org]&lt;/ref&gt; include:
* 11,577 new secondary schools approved; 10,082 functional
* 52,750 additional classrooms approved; 20,839 completed; 16,774 in progress
* 25,948 science laboratories approved; 10,107 completed, 8,532 in progress
* 21,864 computer rooms approved; 6,920 completed, 6,297 in progress
* 27,428 libraries approved; 10,133 completed, 8,929 in progress

* 5,408 teachers' quarters approved; 623 completed, 509 in progress
* 2,975 major repairs approved; 1,313 completed, 271 in progress

== Progress ==
There is a rise in demand for secondary education, but, despite an increase in the number of schools, their geographic distribution is uneven. The gender gap has narrowed. In the Tenth Plan the focus is on quality education at all levels.&lt;ref name="rmsaindia.org"/&gt;

== Disintegration ==
In 2018, Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan along with [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]] was disintegrated to form [[Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan]].

The [[Society for Science &amp; the Public]] began the competition in 1942 with [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Corporation]]; for many years, the competition was known as the '''Westinghouse Science Talent Search'''. In 1998, [[Intel]] became the sponsor after it outbid several other companies.&lt;ref name="1998edweek"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1998/04/01/29sci.h17.html?print=1 | title=Intel Corp.

'''Semester at Sea'''  ('''SAS''') is a [[study abroad|study–abroad]] program founded in 1963, now managed by the [[Institute for Shipboard Education]]&lt;ref name="wilton"&gt;{{cite web | last=Nash | first=James | title=Wiltonian spends 'Semester at Sea' | publisher=Wilton Villager | date=2010-01-07 | url=http://www.wiltonvillager.com/story/480305 | accessdate=2010-01-17 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718053012/http://www.wiltonvillager.com/story/480305 | archivedate=2011-07-18 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]], USA. Colorado State University is the current academic sponsor for the program&lt;ref name="wilton"/&gt;  while the program itself is run on a cruise ship. Throughout the history of the program, nearly 63,000 undergraduate students&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/contact/about-us/|title=About us|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from more than 1,500 colleges and universities have participated in Semester at Sea.

During the spring and fall semesters, the approximately 100- 110 day program circumnavigates the globe, with up to 600 undergraduates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/life-at-sea/our-ship/|title=Our Ship|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=''Semester at Sea''|accessdate=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; traveling from [[North America]] heading either east across the [[Atlantic]] or west across the [[Pacific]], visiting from 10 to 11 countries in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]], [[South America]] and North America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/|title=Explore Upcoming Voyages on the MV World Odyssey {{!}} Semester at Sea|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The program previously had voyages that would sail through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal, but due to piracy concerns in the [[Gulf of Aden]], voyages now typically travel around Africa.

For many years, ISE hosted a shorter 65-day Semester at Sea program in the summer that concentrated on one general region of the world. In May 2011, Semester at Sea introduced a new short-term or Maymester voyage with a curriculum focused on the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]]. These voyages lasted 26 days and offered students the opportunity to earn 4–5 transferable credits. However, following the Maymester 2012 voyage, Semester at Sea made the decision to cancel Short-Term voyages indefinitely due to low enrollment. Additionally, a two-week ''"Enrichment Voyage"'' program was previously held for continuing education participants during December and January. Itineraries for these voyages focused on [[Central America]] and [[South America]], often transiting the [[Panama Canal]] or traveling up the [[Amazon River]]. ISE currently offers only fall and spring voyages.

== Academics ==
Students attend classes while the ship is at sea in a variety of subjects and disciplines. These classes are typically [[humanities]] classes connecting with one or more of the countries on the itinerary. All students are required to take an interdisciplinary core course called Global Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/info-hub/academics/#semester-at-sea-course-information|title=Course Information|last=|first=|date=|website=|format=PDF|accessdate=}}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the ship is in a port, no classes are held.  Students are then able to travel on Semester at Sea-sponsored trips or independently within the country&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/our-program/in-country/|title=In-country destinations: field classes &amp; program {{!}} Semester at Sea voyages|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  However, travel outside the country of port is strictly prohibited, resulting in dismissal from the program.

Although Colorado State University is the academic sponsor for the program, Semester at Sea is open to students from any university. Faculty members are drawn from colleges and universities throughout the United States and around the world, including [[Harvard University]], [[Stanford University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Brown University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[George Washington University]], [[Boston University]], [[Bucknell University]], [[Emerson College]], [[Yale University]], [[University of Pittsburgh]], [[California Lutheran University]], [[Chapman University]], [[Bentley University]], [[Pennsylvania State University]], [[Duke University]], [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)]], [[Cornell University]], [[Jacksonville University]], [[University of Arizona]], [[University of Michigan]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[University of Virginia]], [[University of Colorado]], [[University of Maine]], [[University of San Diego]], [[University of Southern California]], [[University of Connecticut]], [[New York University]] and [[Columbia University]].

Prior to arriving at a port, students receive a pre-port briefing regarding the culture and societal rules of the country they are visiting. Upon arriving at the port of call, special guest speakers, ranging from community leaders from the country to American ambassadors, give lectures to the students and faculty. The pre-port briefing as well as the guest lecture prepare students for their time in the country.

[[Image:S.S.UniverseExplorer-SemesterAtSea1997.png|thumb|350px|right|SS ''Universe Explorer'' docked in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], shortly before embarking on the Fall 1997 Semester at Sea voyage.]]

In May 2015, a lease was announced for the ship previously known as the {{MS|Deutschland|1998|6}}, to be renovated, reflagged, and renamed the {{MV|World Odyssey|1998|6}},&lt;ref&gt;http://www.semesteratsea.org/our-ship/&lt;/ref&gt; operated by [[V-Ships]].

Semester at Sea has used a number of ships as its floating campus, including the MS ''Seven Seas'' (formerly the [[USS Long Island (CVE-1)|USS ''Long Island'']]), the SS ''Ryndam'' (not the later [[SS Rijndam|freighter]] of that name), the [[SS Atlantic (1953)|SS ''Universe'']] (formerly the [[SS Atlantic (1953)|SS Atlantic]]), the {{SS|Universe Explorer|1957|6}}, and the {{MV|Explorer|2001|6}}.  One ship SAS intended to use, the [[S.S. Seawise University|S.S. ''Seawise University'']] (formerly the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth|RMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']]), burned and sank in [[Hong Kong Harbour]] during her conversion into a floating campus in 1972, and consequently was never used for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Universe Explorer'', retired in 2005, had a structure of four main decks with a small swimming pool in the stern of the ship.  The ''Seawise University'', ''[[SS Atlantic (1953)|Universe]]'', and ''Universe Explorer'' were supplied and managed by [[Tung Chao Yung]]'s Seawise Foundation.  Concerns about the split between the Institute for Shipboard Education and the Seawise Foundation as well as the safety of the MV ''Explorer'' contributed to the [[University of Pittsburgh]] severing ties with the program in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Hart |author2=Mary Ann Thomas |title=Pitt to end pact with Semester at Sea program |url=http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-db=ustory&amp;-lay=a&amp;-format=d.html&amp;storyid=2629&amp;-Find |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901091923/http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-db=ustory&amp;-lay=a&amp;-format=d.html&amp;storyid=2629&amp;-Find |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 1, 2006 |work=University Times |location=[[University of Pittsburgh]] |date=June 9, 2005 |accessdate=May 19, 2009 |quote=...Pitt’s concerns, charging that ISE left unanswered repeated requests by Pitt “for detailed assurances” that the MV ''Explorer'' was seaworthy. Maher further maintained that ISE’s decision to part ways with the Seawise Foundation, which for many years had supplied both SAS’s previous ship, the S.S. Universe Explorer, as well as superior maritime management expertise, raised serious safety issues. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Additional Information ==
World figures such as [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Mother Teresa]], [[Desmond Tutu]], and [[Fidel Castro]] have all met with the program's participants at various times during its history.  In 1999, the program's fame was boosted greatly when it was featured on [[Road Rules: Semester at Sea|a season]] of [[MTV]]'s reality television show ''[[Road Rules]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semesteratsea.org/about-us/overview/history-and-timeline.php|title=History and Timeline|work=|accessdate=2009-05-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329055946/http://www.semesteratsea.org/about-us/overview/history-and-timeline.php|archivedate=2009-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ports of call ==
The itinerary of ports changes each semester, typically voyaging to 10-11 ports around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/|title=Explore our Voyages|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 90s a spring itinerary included: Nassau/Bahamas, Caracas/Venezuela, Salvador/Brazil, Capetown/South Africa, Mombasa/Kenya, Madras (Chennai)/India, Singapore, Penang/Malaysia, Shanghai/China, Osaka/Japan and Hong Kong.

== Traditions ==

=== Neptune Day celebration ===
When the ship passes the equator, the students, faculty and crew of the vessel celebrate [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] Day a maritime [[line-crossing ceremony]]. Students are transformed from "polywogs" to "shellbacks" in an initiation ceremony, involving slime-smearing, fish-kissing, and (optional) [[head shaving|head-shaving]]. Neptune Day is one of several holidays celebrated during the voyage.

=== Sea Olympics ===
Students aboard the ship are divided into "seas" (occasionally including: Adriatic, Aegean, Baltic, Bering, Caribbean, Mediterranean, Red, Yellow, the Persian Gulf and three seas for the Lifelong Learners, faculty and children of faculty). The student seas are generally determined by their deck. The seas compete in an all-day Olympic challenge. Opening ceremonies are held in the morning, and no classes are held during the Olympics. Events may include synchronized swimming, pull-ups, dodgeball, trivia, a lip-sync routine and a ship-wide relay. The winning sea gets bragging rights for the rest of the semester and a grand prize, which is usually being the first to disembark from the ship in its final port of call, and a celebration in the faculty/staff only lounge.

== Incidents ==
The Spring 1994 ([[SS Atlantic (1953)|SS ''Universe'']]) voyage ended at Hong Kong because the ship was scheduled for dry-dock maintenance after the voyage. However, the ship was unable to consistently meet its sailing schedule during the semester due to persistent mechanical difficulties. The ship made several unscheduled stops, and had to anchor between ports while repairs were accomplished. It was decided to tow the ship to the South China Sea and anchor overnight. Captain Chang had all crew members patrolling the deck 3-5 feet apart with flashlights throughout the night to notify of any pirate boarding attempts. The planned stop at Manila, Philippines was cancelled and the SS ''Universe'' rerouted to Singapore. Exams completed at anchor in the harbor, then the students and faculty flew to the next two planned ports of Osaka, Japan and Shanghai, China. The ''Universe'' met the students in Shanghai and completed the final leg of the voyage to Hong Kong.

Traveling in foreign countries poses risks for all travelers and a few incidents of non-shipboard fatalities have occurred to participants of Semester at Sea.  One student died in a hiking accident on a 1993 voyage, and on SAS Spring 1996, five students were killed in a bus crash during a field trip in India.&lt;ref&gt;Hong, Peter (1996) “Deaths Cloud Floating College : After Losing Children to Accidents, Parents Say Risks Weren't Publicized; Officials Defend Program”,  http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-17/local/me-15911_1_international-programs.  Accessed 2011-06-30&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fall 1997 voyage was re-routed due to [[terrorism]] concerns. On November 12, 1997, [[Ramzi Yousef]] was convicted of masterminding the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]. Consequently, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] issued a travel warning for Americans in the Middle East. On November 17, 1997, while the ship was docked in [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]], and the students were in country, the [[Luxor massacre]] occurred. Although no students were involved, fears of further terrorism resulted in the next two ports, [[Israel]] and [[Turkey]], being skipped and the ship re-routed to [[Cyprus]] and [[Spain]].

The Fall 2000 semester on the S.S. ''Universe Explorer'' had 2 incidents. When entering Vietnam, the ship was hit by a barge causing damage to the hull along the side of the ship and closing student rooms. No one was injured by this incident. The S.S. ''Universe Explorer'' had to remain an extra day in Vietnam to be patched, but continued on the journey with all passengers after that. Then while getting ready to go north through the Suez Canal to Egypt, Turkey, Croatia and Spain, the ship decided to reroute due to threats in that area against all ships in the Suez.  Instead of those four countries, the Fall 2000 voyage stopped in Kenya, South Africa and Brazil.

On the Fall 2001 semester following the events of September 11, the S.S. ''Universe Explorer'' was redirected after its stop in [[Kobe]], [[Japan]]. The planned route from [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]] into the Indian Ocean then up through the [[Suez Canal]] to ports including [[Egypt]] and [[Croatia]] was changed by the State Department of the United States. The ship's route for the semester was then pushed south to include [[Singapore]], [[Seychelles]] and [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]. The ship's communication with other vessels in the Indian Ocean was limited due to the amount of American citizens on board and their security around the Indian Ocean area close to the Middle Eastern part of the globe.

On January 26, 2005, the MV ''Explorer'' weathered a combination of three storms in the north Pacific, and a {{convert|50|ft|adj=on}} wave&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Storm Stories|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DBGhXI586k#t=8m42s|publisher=[[The Weather Channel]]|date=January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; smashed the windows of the bridge, breaking one of them, and briefly affecting the navigation systems. After receiving a distress call from the vessel, the [[United States Coast Guard|US Coast Guard]] dispatched a [[Lockheed HC-130]] search and rescue plane (which shot footage of the vessel in the storm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRUISE FROM HELL!!!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUAUxxafZG4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and two [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutters]]. There were no casualties, but two crew members were injured. That footage is from the sistership, the Grand Voyager, on 2/14/2005 in Cyclone Valentina. The Grand Voyager is now called the Chinese Taishan.&lt;ref name="quchronicle"&gt;{{cite web

The MV ''Explorer'' rejoined the students in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Vietnam]], and continued on to circumnavigate the globe and complete the semester without further incident. The ordeal is documented in an episode of the [[The Weather Channel|Weather Channel]] television series ''[[Full Force Nature]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Storm Stories|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DBGhXI586k|publisher=[[The Weather Channel]]|date=January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; complete with home video taken by the students during the storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Norville|first=Deborah|title=Semester at Sea|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElQ4wsUqqi8|work=[[Inside Edition]]|authorlink=Deborah Norville|date=January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, safety concerns were among the reasons cited by the University of Pittsburgh for ending its 24-year academic sponsorship of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.utimes.pitt.edu/?p=1396 | title=Provost explains decision to drop Semester at Sea | first=Peter | last=Hart | newspaper=University Times | publisher=University of Pittsburgh | location=Pittsburgh, PA | volume=37 | number=21 | date=2005-06-23 | accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Summer 2005 voyage was rerouted from London to Le Havre, France due to safety concerns after the London bombings on July 7.

During the Fall 2006 voyage, [[Typhoon Shanshan (2006)|Typhoon Shanshan]] caused the MV ''Explorer'', en route from Japan to [[Qingdao, China]], to be re-routed to [[Hong Kong]].

During the Fall 2008 voyage, student Kurt Leswing was hit and killed by a drunk driver in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;

The Fall 2015 voyage on the MS World Odyssey was rerouted last minute from Turkey to Croatia to avoid terrorism and the refugee crisis.

The Spring 2017 Voyage was rerouted from Mauritius at the request of the vessel owner.

'''Snap!''' is a free, blocks- and browser-based [[List of educational programming languages|educational]] graphical programming language that allows students to create interactive animations, games, stories, and more, while learning about mathematical and computational ideas. Snap! was inspired by [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]], but also targets both novice and more advanced students by including and expanding Scratch's features.

Since version 4.0, it is entirely browser-based, with no software that needs to be installed on the local device, much like [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]].

==User interface==
[[File:Snap 4.0 Default screen.png|thumb|left|420px|Three resizable columns, containing five regions, in the Snap!'s [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] at startup]]
Reference Manual for Snap! is available for download by clicking on the Snap! logo (in the top-left corner of the screen). Screen is organized in three resizable columns containing five regions, which include the blocks palette of different categories (in the left column), the scripts area with all scripts belonging to a selected sprite, and the stage area (in the third column) with sprites thumbnails (also called sprite corral) below it.{{#tag:ref|The way pre-2.0 Scratch version's screen was organized.|group=Note}}

In the interactively resizable stage area (full-screen is available, too) are drawn the graphical results (i.e. animations, turtle graphics etc) of the scripts running in the script area, and/or interactively double-clicked individual blocks in any palette. Individual blocks can be dragged from the palette onto the scripts area to be associated with the selected sprite.

|}
Categories of blocks include the Motion, Looks, Sound, Pen, Control, Sensing, Operators, and Variables groups as shown in the table below. 

Besides the Script tab, there are two other tabs, the Costumes tab and the Sounds tab. An expandable bar at the right is Help area.

==Features==
The most important features that Snap! offers, but Scratch does not, include:

* expressions using "nested functions", consisting of one or more "anonymous functions", each of which is represented by a block having one or more empty(ed) slot(s)/parameter(s) that are waiting for a "higher order function" (the one that is calling the anonymous one) to be filled by. (Their computer-science theorethical basis being [[First class function]]s, which in turn have "[[Lambda calculus]]" as their even more abstract, mathematical, foundation), 
* lists that are [[First class object|first class]] (including ''lists of lists''),  
* ''First class'' sprites (in other words [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-oriented instance-based classless programming]]),
* nestable sprites
* codification of Snap! programs to mainstream languages such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], JavaScript, [[C (programming language)|C]], etc.

==History==

The '''Society of German Chemists''' (German: ''{{lang|de|Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker}}'', GDCh) is a [[learned society]] and [[professional association]] founded in 1949 to represent the interests of German chemists in local, national and international contexts. GDCh "unites those people associated with the chemical and molecular sciences and supports them in their responsible and sustainable endeavors for the good of the public and of our environment."&lt;ref&gt;Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker (GDCh), [http://www.gdch.de/gdch/statement__e.htm  Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest precursor of today's GDCh was the [[German Chemical Society]] (''{{lang|de|Deutsche Chemische Gesellschaft zu Berlin}}'', DChG).  [[Adolf von Baeyer]] was prominent among the German chemists who established DChG in 1867; and [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] was the first president.&lt;ref name="gdch1"&gt;GDCh, [http://www.gdch.de/gdch/historie__e.htm  History]&lt;/ref&gt;  This society was modeled after the [[British Chemical Society]], which was the precursor of the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]. Like its British counterpart, DChG sought to foster the communication of new ideas and facts throughout Germany and across international borders.&lt;ref name="Lagowski"&gt;[[J J Lagowski|Lagowski, J. J.]] (1991). [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/ed068p1  "A British Sesquicentennial,"] ''[[Journal of Chemical Education]],'' Vol 68, No. 1, p. 1; acknowledging the sesquicentennial of The Chemical Society in London, which eventually became the Royal Society of Chemistry; retrieved 2011-06-08&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, the current organization was created by a merger of the German Chemical Society (DChG) and the [[Association of German Chemists]] (''{{lang|de|Verein Deutscher Chemiker}}'', VDCh).

Honorary Members of the GDCh have included [[Otto Hahn]], [[Robert B. Woodward]], [[Jean-Marie Lehn]], [[George Olah]] and other eminent scientists.&lt;ref name="gdch2"&gt;GDCh, [http://www.gdch.de/gdch/eps__e.htm  Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Scientific publications of the society include ''{{lang|de|Nachrichten aus der Chemie}},''&lt;ref&gt;GDCh, [http://www.gdch.de/taetigkeiten/nch__e.htm  ''Nachrichten aus der Chemie'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Angewandte Chemie]],'' ''[[Chemistry: A European Journal]],''  ''[[European Journal of Inorganic Chemistry]],'' ''[[European Journal of Organic Chemistry]],'' ''[[ChemPhysChem]],'' ''[[ChemSusChem]],'' ''[[ChemBioChem]],'' ''[[ChemMedChem]],'' ''[[ChemCatChem]],'' ''[[ChemistryViews]],'' ''Chemie Ingenieur Technik'' and ''[[Chemie in unserer Zeit]].''&lt;ref&gt;GDCh, [http://www.gdch.de/taetigkeiten/zeitschriften__e.htm  Journals]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, the society has become a member of [[ChemPubSoc Europ]]e, which is an organization of 16 European chemical societies.  This European consortium was established in the late 1990s as many chemical journals owned by national chemical societies were amalgamated.&lt;ref&gt;ChemPubSoc Europe, [http://www.wiley-vch.de/vch/journals/2111/chempubsoc-eu.html mission]; [http://www.wiley-vch.de/vch/journals/2111/chempubsoc-eu_members.html  participating societies]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prizes and awards===
The society acknowledges individual achievement with prizes and awards, including medals originally conferred by the predecessor organizations DChG and VDCh:
* [[Hoffman Medal]] (''Hofmann Denkmünze''), first awarded to [[Henri Moissan]], 1903&lt;ref name="gdch1"/&gt;  
* [[Liebig Medal]] (''Liebig Denkmünze''), first awarded to [[Adolf von Baeyer]], 1903&lt;ref name="gdch1"/&gt;

The '''Stanford US–Russia Forum''' ('''SURF''') is an organization dedicated to bringing students at leading Russian and American universities together for research in public policy, business, economics and many other disciplines. The program begins with a fall conference in [[Russia]], followed by six months of work on collaborative research projects and a capstone conference in the spring at [[Stanford University]]. Currently in its tenth year, more than 400 undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students from Russia and the U.S. have participated in the program.

__TOC__

== History ==

[[File:SURF organizers with Condoleezza Rice.jpg|thumb|SURF organizers with Condoleezza Rice]]
SURF was founded in the fall of 2008 by four students from Stanford University and Moscow State University who wanted to maintain dialogue on U.S.-Russia cooperation despite the deterioration in relations caused by the [[Russo-Georgian war]]. 

SURF’s first public event was a one-day conference in November 2008 at [[Moscow State University]] focused on the most pressing problems in US-Russian relations. The conference attracted widespread student interest and was attended by delegates from [[Moscow State University|MSU]], [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations|MGIMO]], [[Higher School of Economics|the Higher School of Economics]], the Academy of National Economy, as well as students from [[Stanford University]], [[Yale University]] and [[University of Pennsylvania]].

In the fall of 2009, the organization launched the SURF Exchange Program, a six-month program for twenty American and twenty Russian students, selected on a competitive basis. During the fall, the SURF delegates participated in a series of virtual seminars with guest lecturers including [[Dmitri Trenin]] (Director, Carnegie Moscow Center) and [[Donald Kennedy]] (Editor,  [[Science (journal)|Science)]]. In the winter, the delegates continued to meet virtually in small groups that researched and produced Collaborative Research Projects (CRP). The program concluded with a week-long capstone conference at Stanford University in April 2010. The capstone conference brought together organizers, participants and sponsors of SURF, as well as a number of special guests. Speakers included the 66th U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]], Assistant to the President of the Russian Federation [[Arkady Dvorkovich]], and Former Adviser to US President Bill Clinton for Russia and Ukraine [[Coit D. Blacker|Coit Blacker]]. Following the conference, the CRP results were published in the SURF Journal. The first SURF Exchange Program was formally recognized for its work fostering civil society ties between the US and Russia by Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs [[Sergei Lavrov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanforddaily.com/2010/04/15/dvorkovich-urges-russian-economic-modernization  Dvorkovich talks Russian economics] The Stanford Daily. (April 15, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program ==

=== Structure ===

[[File:SURF alumni with Dmitry Medvedev.jpg|thumb|SURF alumni with Dmitry Medvedev]]
Since 2010, the SURF Exchange Program has consisted of two major components: conferences and Collaborative Research Projects (CRP). The program opens each fall with a week-long conference in Moscow where delegates meet with experts in academia, business, and policy to learn about current issues in U.S.-Russia relations. The 20 American and 20 Russian delegates also meet in person for the first time and finalize their research questions for their four-person research teams. 

The collaborative research component lasts for six months. Research topics have included cyber-security, public health, nuclear and energy issues, news and the media, space cooperation, entrepreneurship and business, cooperation in the Arctic, the environment, and a number of others. In some cases, groups are paired with sponsoring institutions that submit problems or question for the group to research, to ensure that each CRP group produced work relevant to the real world. Sponsoring institutions have included the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], [[Ministry of Energy (Russia)|the Russian Ministry of Energy]], [[Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research]], [[Renova Group]], [[Draper Fisher Jurvetson]] and [[The Boeing Company]]. 

In the spring, the students meet at Stanford University for a capstone conference to present their research to policy-makers and other experts. Talks are also held with notable experts from a wide range of fields to deepen participants’ knowledge of U.S.-Russia relations.

[[File:Delegates in Fort Ross.JPG|thumb|Delegates in Fort Ross]]
SURF is housed at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI) at Stanford University and it is also supported by its founding partner universities, Moscow State University, Moscow State Institute of International Relations (University) of the MFA of Russia (MGIMO), the Higher School of Economics (NRU-HSE), and the Academy of National Economy.

=== Participants ===

More than 40 students from over 40 Russian, American and international universities have participated in SURF since the program’s inception. The program accepts undergraduate, graduate and professional school students from all disciplines, and no previous exposure to Russia is required. Instead, the program prioritizes intellectual curiosity, leadership and impact potential, and research skills. Selection for participation in the program is very competitive; the overall acceptance rate for the 2014-2015 program was 7.5%.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="842">'''Sub-caliber training''' is used to save wear and expense when training with a larger gun by use of smaller weapons with identical ballistic characteristics. The smaller weapons could be inserted into the larger weapon's barrel, externally attached to the barrel or mounted above the weapon. Examples include the [[M303 Sub-Caliber insert]] for the {{convert|120|mm|1|abbr=on}} [[M120 mortar]] that allows the mortar to use {{convert|81|mm|1|abbr=on}} ammunition or the M49A1 sub-caliber device, which used [[7.62×51mm NATO]] rifle rounds in the {{convert|90|mm|1|abbr=on}} [[M67 recoilless rifle]]. These devices/weapons have been used for guns as large as the {{convert|12|-|16|in|1|adj=on|sp=us}} main guns of [[battleship]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2808">A '''talking tactile tablet''' or '''T3''' is a [[graphic tablet]] with a touch surface that can be used as an [[input device]] that uses swell paper to create 3D overlays and connects audio files to parts of the overlays. The device is  connected to a computer and run with a programme CD, and has a tactile surface which produces touchable icons that provide audio feedback when they are pressed.&lt;ref name=T3b&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hereford/worcs/4782052.stm|title= College creates new touch device|work= BBC News|publisher= British Broadcasting Corporation|date= 7 March 2006|accessdate= 26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used to help visually impaired users to interpret diagrams, charts and maps by producing a tactile, touchable image, and audio feedback.&lt;ref name="T3"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/archive/2007/04/19/Health+%28hereford_news_health%29/1337514.College_breaks_new_ground/|title= College breaks new ground|publisher= Worcester News|date= 18 April 2007|accessdate= 26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The T3 was developed at the United Kingdom's [[Royal National College for the Blind]] in [[Hereford]] in conjunction with a software company based in the United States.&lt;ref name="T3"/&gt; The device was originally developed for educational purposes but is adaptable for other uses.

'''Time To Know''' is an Israeli [[education technology]] program, that started as a philanthropic project in Israel in 2005, by Shmuel Meitar and [[Morris Kahn]] from the [[Aurec Group]], who were the founders of [[Amdocs]], a software company that specializes in customer care and billing systems for the telecom industry. ''Time To Know'' enhances student learning by providing engaging and adaptive content focused on exploration, inquiry-based learning, collaborative class discussions, multimedia activities, and games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time to Know|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/company/time-to-know|publisher=Techcrunch|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, it was strictly a philanthropic endeavor. Meitar had spent a decade helping underprivileged students particularly in rural Israel advance their education through scholarships and college readiness services. The platform was first piloted in Israel in 2007, where it continues to be a philanthropic effort. In 2008, Meitar recruited businessman and professor Dr. [[Yosi Ben-Dov]], with experience in the U.S. and Israel. They established ''Time To Know'' as a for-profit entity outside Israel in order to fund continued development. The platform was introduced to public schools in Texas in 2009 and in New York City’s iZone in 2010-11.&lt;ref name=Edsurge&gt;{{cite web|title=Time To Know|url=https://www.edsurge.com/time-to-know--2|work=[[Edsurge]]|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 2011, ''Time To Know'' was used by 60 schools (6,500 students) in Israel and by 29 schools (3,200 students) in New York City and 4 schools in Texas (1,500 students). Pilot projects began in 2012 in Singapore (three schools with 300 students) and Korea (one school, expected to expand to 10 schools with 50 students by fall 2012). The program was slated to be introduced in France in March 2012 with 300 students in five schools.&lt;ref name=Edsurge/&gt;

The company employs 250 people in Israel and the US, and has an extensive professional development program. It has been funded entirely by Meitar, who has invested $60 million of his own money into developing ''Time To Know''. In October 2011, LaVerne Evans Srinivasan, former deputy chancellor with the New York City Department of Education, joined Time To Know as president of its North American division.&lt;ref name=Edsurge/&gt;

''Time To Know'' created the first [[Digital teaching platform]] which is a fully integrated platform the teacher to take full advantage of the digital world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carthy|first=Roi|title=Israel's Time To Know Aims To Revolutionize The Classroom|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/02/israels-time-to-know-aims-to-revolutionize-the-classroom/|accessdate=22 March 2014|newspaper=[[Techcrunch]]|date=2 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic hardware requirement is one laptop (or tablet) per student and a desktop connected to a projector for the teacher. The main features of the software are the ability of the teacher to "control" the students.

The '''Union of Independent Grandes Écoles''' ({{lang-fr|'''Union des grandes écoles indépendantes'''}}, '''UGEI''') is an association of French private ''[[grandes écoles]]'' formed in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichIDCC.do;jsessionid=7DE194DA8941321764FE57023DA1117A.tpdjo04v_1?idConvention=KALICONT000018879385&amp;cidTexte=KALITEXT000019386121 Adhésion par lettre du 4 juillet 2008 de l'UGEI GP à la convention collective]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.efrei.fr/partenaire/ugei UGEI]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.educpros.fr/detail-article/h/0a020b0171/a/enseignement-superieur-prive-de-nouvelles-contractualisations-annoncees-pour-2010.html Enseignement supérieur privé : de nouvelles contractualisations annoncées pour 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.educpros.fr/detail-article/h/e86b6fe9c2/a/nesim-fintz-president-de-lugei-nous-allons-essayer-de-creer-une-ecole-doctorale.html Nesim Fintz (président de l’UGEI) : « Nous avons besoin d'aides de l'Etat pour créer une école doctorale »]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.whoswho.fr/entreprise/union-des-grandes-ecoles-independantes-ugei_18073 UNION DES GRANDES ÉCOLES INDÉPENDANTES (UGEI) WHO'S WHO IN FRANCE]&lt;/ref&gt;

UPR-RP serves more than 18,000 students, of which 20% are graduate students, and grants an average of over 3,000 degrees a year. It is recognized by the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] as a research university "high research activity" (RU/H).&lt;ref&gt;http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/resources&lt;/ref&gt; As a public comprehensive doctoral institution, its academic offerings range from the bachelorette to the doctoral degree, through 70 undergraduate programs and 19 graduate degrees with 71 specializations in the basic disciplines and professional fields. UPR‐RP has consistently granted the largest number of doctorate degrees to Hispanics in the US.

UPR-RP is the largest campus in terms of student population of the [[University of Puerto Rico|University of Puerto Rico System]], and Puerto Rico's first public university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graduados.uprrp.edu/catalogo/rrp_campus_history.htm |title=::Catálogo Graduado-UPR-Río Piedras:: |publisher=Graduados.uprrp.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the year 1900 the ''Escuela Normal Industrial'' (Normal Industrial School) was established in [[Fajardo, Puerto Rico]] as the first Higher Education institution of Puerto Rico, dedicated to those who would become teachers on the island. At the time it only had 20 students and 5 professors.
[[File:LaUniversidad.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras campus, and its distinctive [[clock tower]].]]
A year later, in 1901, it was moved to the town of [[Río Piedras]], because the roads to Fajardo were in a terrible condition. In the mild and studying-favourable nature around what was known by the time as "''La Convalecencia''" (the summer residence of the [[List of Governors of Puerto Rico#Governors under Spanish Crown|Spanish Governors of Puerto Rico]]) was placed, temporally, the Normal School. Its objectives were still the formation of new teachers for the island.

On March 12, 1903, under the administration of the Public Instruction Commissioner, Samuel McCune Lindsay, the [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico#History|2nd Legislative Assembly]] approved a law creating the [[University of Puerto Rico]] in Río Piedras, transferring all the funding of the Insular Normal School there. This School became the first department of the university, what is now the Faculty of Education, becoming the nucleus of the University of Puerto Rico.

Now legally established, the University of Puerto Rico started its first academic year (1903–1904) with an enrollment of 173 students. Due to the scarcity of teachers in the island, most of these students were appointed by the [[Puerto Rico Department of Education|Department of Public Instruction]] to teach at schools without having finished four years of college. The first graduating class (June 1907) consisted of 13 students.

In 1907, the first class graduated from the normal course of four years after the university was legally established. Among the students in that class were [[Carlota Matienzo]], Isabel Andréu, Loaíza Cordero, Marina Roviro, and Juan Herrero.

On September 22, 1913, the departments of Law and Pharmacology were established. The university at the time required only an 8th grade diploma, but with the expansion of its courses, this requirement changed. After 1917, the departments of Normal Education, Liberal Arts, Pharmacology, and Law required a [[High school#United States|high school]] diploma for admission.

[[File:Torre-dentro.JPG|thumb|250px|left|The Bronze Circle inside of '''''La Torre''''' (the Tower)]]

On February 21, 1931, Dr. [[Carlos E. Chardón]] was appointed as chancellor of the university. During his tenure the university experienced significant growth in endowments. These were used in the expansion of the physical facilities at the Río Piedras and [[University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez|Mayagüez]] Campuses. This helped turn the university into a respected educational center. Chardón resigned from the post of [[Chancellor#Educational usage|Chancellor]] in 1936, being succeeded by Juan B. Soto. The most important part of this period was the expansion of the buildings of the University as part of a plan for the rehabilitation of Puerto Rico.

=== ''La Torre'' ===
In 1936, architect [[Rafael Carmoega]], working under the [[Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration]] (PRRA), designed the distinctive University of Puerto Rico clock tower based on the 1924 Parsons Plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aacupr.uprrp.edu/rafael_carmoega.htm University of Puerto Rico, School of Architecture. Archivo de Arquitectura y Construcción de la Universidad de Puerto Rico (AACUPR)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611053524/http://aacupr.uprrp.edu/rafael_carmoega.htm |date=2010-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The iconic university [[clock tower]] was built in 1937 and christened as the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] tower, in honor of that U.S. president and his interest in the building of the university. '''''La Torre''''' (as The Tower is nicknamed in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) is located at the entrance of the [[Román Baldorioty de Castro]] Building.[https://web.archive.org/web/20131219110846/http://www.uprrp.edu/rectoria/mapa_recinto.php] Also at the entrance of the Tower, the coats of arms of the nations of the Americas appear in a bronze circle, as a symbol of [[Pan-American Union|Panamerican Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Translated from "Historia del Recinto de Río Piedras"{{cite web |url=http://www.uprrp.edu/recinto/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205035755/http://www.uprrp.edu/recinto/index.php |archivedate=2008-12-05 |df= }} (Spanish website)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student strikes===
The University was the site of social upheaval during the 1960s and 1970s, when [[FUPI|nationalist students]] protested for [[civil rights]], the [[independence of Puerto Rico]], and taking the [[ROTC]] out of the campus. In 1970 [[Antonia Martínez]] was murdered by the [[Puerto Rico Police|police]] when they repressed students. As the shouting started in the street, everyone in the building she was in, on Ponce de León Avenue, went to the balconies to see what was happening. She was, like many others, watching the events, saw [[Puerto Rico Police|policemen]] attacking at the students, and allegedly shouted at the police ''¡Asesinos!'' (Assassins!). A policeman turned and shot her in the head, killing her and injuring a roommate. A mural of her and her story existed on the College of Humanities, until administrative personnel covered it with paint. Other stories claim that she was shot by mistake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verdadyjusticia.org/casos/antonia/datos_antonia.html Comisión por la Verdad y la Justicia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rio Piedras Campus is a [[collegiate university]]. The Chancellor of the Campus is the top academic and administrative officer and presides over its two deliberative bodies: the Administrative Board and the Academic Senate.

=== Administrative Board ===

The '''Administrative Board''', composed of the deans, two senators representing the faculty, and one student senator, advises the Chancellor in matters pertaining to the university program. The Board makes recommendations on leaves and faculty aid applications, and grants promotions and tenures.

=== Academic Senate ===

The '''Academic Senate''', in turn, is the official academic forum. It is composed of the deans, the director of the library system, elected faculty representatives from all the colleges and schools, student senators, and representatives from the staff of academic advisors. Its members participate on the institutional processes, establishing academic rules and collaborating with other organisms of the University of Puerto Rico system.

=== Student Councils ===

The '''General Student Council''' (''Consejo General de Estudiantes'' or CGE in Spanish) of the [[UPRRP]] is the elected student government of the campus. The Council is composed of several representatives to the student council, elected by each School or College, the number of representatives varies depending on the number of students enrolled in the School or College, and the President and Senator of each School and College, for a total of around 50 members. Elections are held in April and representatives are elected for one year, from July 1 to June 30.

Having its origins in the 1920s, the Student Council was dissolved in 1948 while [[Jaime Benitez]] was chancellor, and under the council presidency of [[Juan Mari Brás]] and it was not until 1968 that the Student Council was re-installed under the name General Student Council and under the council presidency of [[David Noriega]].&lt;ref&gt;Universidad de Puerto Rico Recinto de Río Piedras (1968). Certificación del Consejo General de Estudiantes 1968-69. Río Piedras, PR: Decanato de Estudiantes&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Student Council is governed by the Board of Directors, which is elected from among the council's members and is composed of:

*President
*Vice President
*Executive Secretary
*Press Secretary
*Public Relations Secretary
*Records Clerk

Additionally, they select Representatives to the Campus' Administrative Board and the University's University Board, both of them with an Alternate Representative. They are members of the Board of Directors.

Every College and School has a student council of its own, composed by a President, a Board of Directors, the College or School's Student Senator (and, if available for the College/School, an alternate senator), Representatives to the General Student Council (numbers vary from 1 up to 5, depending on the School or college's student population), and representatives of each department or subdivision present in the School or College.

The [[University High School (San Juan)|University High School]], technically a part of the campus and its School of Education, has a Student Council independent of the campus student council system. It represents several hundred junior and senior high school students.

=== Colleges organization ===

Colleges have a dean, an associate dean, assistant deans, department chairs, and other administrative directors.

== Campus and academic facilities ==
The UPRRP is considered the heart of the commercial and cultural area of Río Piedras, located in the central region of the capital city of San Juan. It is easily accessible via public transportation, including the [[Tren Urbano|Urban Train]] arriving to the vicinity of the enclosure that is easily identified at a distance by its landmark tower. The campus combines sidewalks, and landscaping between old and modern buildings that serve as evidence of architectural development of the past 107 years in Puerto Rican architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upr.edu/?type=page&amp;id=recintos_RioPiedras&amp;ancla=RioPiedras&amp;r_type=items&amp;r_id=1 Universidad de Puerto Rico]&lt;/ref&gt;  The campus's central quadrangle and tower were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984.

===Campus architecture===
The University of Puerto Rico was established in Río Piedras in 1903. The first buildings were the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120422131101/http://www.upr.edu/img/slideShow/la_upr_historia/images/h12.jpg Normal School] (1902),  the Model School (1903), and the residence for the Principal (1903), next to the [[Carretera Central (Puerto Rico)|Central Road]] (today, [[Puerto Rico Highway 25|Ponce de Leon Avenue]]). Over the years, the development of the University occurred somewhat spontaneously. In 1908 the architectural firm of Clark, Howe and Homer designed a new façade for the Model School in the California [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Style]]. In 1909 a milk processing building was constructed in an agricultural area, east of the academic center. Arts and Crafts’ Workshop buildings, a Library and a Gymnasium were projected, as well as the grand stand and the fence (all demolished). In 1912 began the construction for the Memorial Hall (Baldorioty building) and in 1918 buildings for the Law School and the School of Pharmacy were in the works. In 1924 the Chicago  firm of urbanists [[Edward H. Bennett|Bennett]], [[William E. Parsons|Parsons]] and Frost were contacted to [https://web.archive.org/web/20120422131101/http://www.upr.edu/img/slideShow/la_upr_historia/images/h12.jpg design a master plan for the future development of the University].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bennett, Parsons and Frost|title=San Juan (Puerto Rico), Plan - University of Puerto Rico, additions|url=http://digital-libraries.saic.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/mqc/id/2680/rec/164|work=Plan and perspective rendering for proposed additions to the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras.|publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn’t until 1935, with the establishment of the [[Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration]] (PRRA) and the large sum of federal funds that it invested for public works in Puerto Rico, that the partial design and construction of the so-called Plan Parson began. Under the supervision of architect [[Rafael Carmoega]], a group of local architects designed what is known as “el Cuadrángulo” (the Quadrangle).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cuadrángulo Histórico y Torre de la UPR|url=http://alumni.uprrp.edu/torre.asp.html|publisher=Alumni - University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus|accessdate=30 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609005005/http://alumni.uprrp.edu/torre.asp.html|archivedate=9 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, from the 1940s onward a new architectural paradigm, which discarded historical vocabularies and incorporated attitudes learned from Germany and from the studio of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], stemmed from German émigré [[Henry Klumb]]. For 20 years Klumb was sole architect for the University of Puerto Rico, designing buildings for the campuses at Río Piedras and Mayagüez until in 1966. At that time chancellor [[Jaime Benítez]] assigned the design of the General Studies building to the architectural firm of Toro &amp; Ferrer. Other buildings for the University have been designed by architects Antonio Marqués Carrión (sport facilities, 1971); José Firpi (student residence Torre Norte, 1971); the firm of Reed, Torres, Beauchamp &amp; Marvel (new Education Faculty Building, 1974 and the first expansion to the Faculty of Natural Sciences, 1978); the firm of García &amp; Landray (second expansion the Faculty of Natural Sciences, 1989); GDO Arquitectos (School of Architecture, 2001) and Toro Ferrer (new General Studies building, 2007).

=== Library system ===

The [http://biblioteca.uprrp.edu/ Library System of the Río Piedras Campus] incorporates the resources and services of various campus libraries in order to serve the research and teaching needs of the university community. It also extends its services to the Puerto Rican community at large, thus fulfilling, in part, its social and cultural responsibility to the island. The system comprises eighteen specialized and general libraries, with holdings totaling more than 4,000,000 items, access to which may be achieved through the university's online catalog. Of special interest are the Caribbean and Latin American Studies Library and the Puerto Rican Collection, both located in the José M. Lázaro Building.

In addition to the traditional services–reference, circulation, reserves, photocopying, local interlibrary loan, and the compilation of bibliographies and acquisition lists–the Library System also carries out on-line interlibrary loans with libraries all over the world. Other services include Dial Order, DIALOG, microfilming, reproduction of photographs, library instruction and orientation, lectures, and exhibits. The Integration of the Information Competencies to the Curriculum Projects promotes the development of information competencies around the Campus. The Library System offers special facilities for the blind and physically handicapped. Integral parts of the Library System are the graduate and special collections in the Business Administration, Planning, Public Administration, Social Work, and Library Science programs. Independent of the campus Library System are the libraries of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140214023403/http://ls-pt2.law.upr.edu/portal/page?_pageid=251,406095&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL School of Law], [http://bcn.uprrp.edu/ Natural Sciences Faculty], and the [http://bibarquitecturaupr.info/ School of Architecture], which are also located on the university campus.

The current building, designed by the architect Henry Klumb, was inaugurated in 1959. Since its establishment, the museum has actively contributed to the growth of Puerto Rican cultural life by holding art, historical, and anthropological exhibits and sponsoring lectures, seminars, publications, and workshops–to the benefit of both the academic and the general communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graduados.uprrp.edu/catalogo/campus_research_acad_facilities.htm |title=::Catálogo Graduado-UPR-Río Piedras:: |publisher=Graduados.uprrp.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wilhelm Johannsen''' (3 February 1857 – 11 November 1927) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[botanist]], plant physiologist, and [[geneticist]]. He is best known for coining the terms [[gene]], [[phenotype]] and [[genotype]], and for his 1903 [[Mutationism#Johannsen.27s .22pure line.22 experiments.2C 1903|"pure line" experiments]] in [[genetics]].

==Biography==
Johannsen was born in Copenhagen.  While very young, he was apprenticed to a [[pharmacist]] and worked in [[Denmark]] and Germany beginning in 1872 until passing his pharmacist's exam in 1879. In 1881, he became assistant in the chemistry department at the [[Carlsberg Laboratory]] under the chemist [[Johan Kjeldahl]]. Johannsen studied the [[metabolism]] of [[dormancy]] and [[germination]] in [[seed]]s, [[tuber]]s and [[bud]]s. He showed that [[dormancy]] could be broken by various [[anesthetic]] compounds, such as [[diethyl ether]] and [[chloroform]].

In 1892, he was appointed lecturer at [[Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University]] and later became professor of [[botany]] and [[plant physiology]]. He taught plant physiology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugenius Warming|Warming, Eug.]] &amp; W. Johannsen (1895) Den almindelige Botanik (General Botany): En Lærebog, nærmest til Brug for Studerende og Lærere. 3rd edn, [[Copenhagen|Kjøbenhavn]]. 4th edn by Warming and Johannsen 1900-01). German edn 1907-09: Lehrbuch der allgemeinen Botanik (from the 4th edn, by E. P. Meinecke). Berlin, Borntraeger. 667 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; His best-known research concerned so-called ''pure lines'' of the self-fertile [[common bean]]. He was able to show that even in [[population]]s [[homozygote|homozygous]] for all traits, i.e. without genetic variation, seed size followed a [[normal distribution]]. This was attributable to resource provision to the mother plant and to the position of seeds in [[Legume|pod]]s and of pods on the plant. This led him to coin the terms ''[[phenotype]]'' and ''[[genotype]]''.

Johannsen's findings led him to oppose contemporary [[Darwinism|Darwinists]], most notably [[Francis Galton]] and [[Karl Pearson]], who held the occurrence of [[normal distribution|normal distributed]] trait variation in [[population]]s as proof of gradual genetic variation on which selection could act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roll-Hansen | first1 = Nils | year = 1979 | title = The Genotype Theory of Wilhelm Johannsen and its Relation to Plant Breeding and the Study of Evolution | url = | journal = Centaurus | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 201–235 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0498.1979.tb00589.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only with the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], was it established that variation needed to be [[heritable]] to act as the raw material for [[Selection (biology)|selection]].

He created the terms ''[[phenotype]]'' and ''[[genotype]]'', first using them in his paper ''Om arvelighed i samfund og i rene linier'' ("On heredity in society and in pure lines")&lt;ref&gt;Johannsen, W. (1903) Om arvelighed i samfund og i rene linier. Oversigt over det [[Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab]]s Forhandlinger, vol. 3: 247-270. German ed. ''Erblichkeit in Populationen und in reinen Linien'' (1903) Gustav Fischer, Jena. [http://caliban.mpiz-koeln.mpg.de/~stueber/johannsen/erblichkeit/index.html Scanned full text.]&lt;/ref&gt; and in his book ''Arvelighedslærens Elementer''.&lt;ref&gt;Johannsen, W.L. (1905) Arvelighedslærens elementer (The Elements of Heredity). Copenhagen.&lt;/ref&gt; This book was rewritten, enlarged and translated into German as ''Elemente der exakten Erblichkeitslehre''.&lt;ref&gt;Johannsen, W. (1909) Elemente der exakten Erblichkeitslehre. Gustav Fischer, Jena. [http://caliban.mpiz-koeln.mpg.de/~stueber/johannsen/elemente/index.html Scanned full text.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this book Johannsen introduced the term ''[[gene]]''. This term was coined in opposition to the then common ''pangene'' that stemmed from [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] theory of [[pangenesis]]. The book became one of the founding texts of genetics.

Also in 1905, Johannsen was appointed professor of [[plant physiology]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]], becoming vice-chancellor in 1917. In December 1910, Johannsen was invited to give an address before the [[American Society of Naturalists]]. This talk was printed in the [[American Naturalist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/279202 | title = The Genotype Conception of Heredity | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 45 | issue = 531 | pages = 129–59 | year = 1911 | last1 = Johannsen | first1 = W. | jstor=2455747 | pmc = 4258772 | pmid=24691957}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, he was invited to give a series of four lectures at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anon | first1 =  | year = 1911 | title = Professor Johannsen's Columbia Lectures | url = | journal = Science | volume = 34 | issue = 876| page = 484 | jstor=1637692 | doi=10.1126/science.34.876.484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johannsen was a corresponding member of the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia]] (elected 1915).

Johannsen died from work poisoning in 1927.

'''Yvonne Cartier''' (27 February 1928 &amp;ndash; 11 May 2014) was a New Zealand-born [[ballet]] dancer and instructor, and mime.  Her artistic biography coincides with the rebirth of theatrical dancing in England after World War II.

== Ballet career ==
Born in the [[Auckland]] suburb of [[Saint Heliers]] on 27 February 1928,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rad.org.nz/_literature_178143/Winners_from_1941_to_2002_with_photos |title=RAD NZ overseas scholarship winners |date= |website= |publisher=Royal Academy of Dance New Zealand |accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19280229.2.2 | title=Births | date=29 February 1928 | work=Auckland Star | accessdate=29 January 2017 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.augustevestris.fr/article342.html |title=The life of Yvonne Cartier (1928–2014) |date=10 August 2014 |website=In the name of Auguste Vestris |publisher= |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartier began dancing on stage at the age of four in a [[pantomime]].  While studying ballet with Valerie Valeska and Bettina Edwards, she saw the Borovanski Ballet on tour, and decided to make dance her career.  In 1946, following in the footsteps of Bettina Edward's student [[Rowena Jackson]], she emigrated to England on scholarship to the [[Royal Ballet School]], studying with Winifred Edwards, George Goncharov, [[Vera Volkova]] and Audrey de Vos.

In London, she joined the Saint James' Ballet, run by Alan Carter.  With Michel de Lutry (ballet master for the project), his wife Domini Callaghan, and Sonia Hana, Yvonne Cartier took part in one of the very early television programmes, [[BBC]]'s ''Ballet for Beginners''.  When the Ballet for Beginners Company went on tour, it was joined by [[Ken Russell]] (later the film-maker), who danced Coppelius to Yvonne Cartier's Swanhilda.

She then took odd jobs in [[revue]] theatre in London, such as Sauce Tartare with [[Audrey Hepburn]].  It was whilst dancing in [[cabaret]] that she came across Larice Arlen, ballet mistress, wife to the Managing Director of Sadler's Wells Opera.

Larice Arlen pushed Cartier to re-audition for [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] Ballet, which she joined, and there created ballets for [[John Cranko]], [[Andrée Howard]], [[Walter Gore]] and [[Ninette de Valois]].  At Ninette de Valois' request, she then joined the main company at [[Covent Garden]].  There, she also danced all the classics.

== Mime and dance instructor ==
Following a serious injury to the ankle, inoperable at the time, Cartier left England for France in 1957, and worked for 20 years as a [[mime]] with the celebrated troupes of [[Jacques Lecoq]] and [[Marcel Marceau]], and as choreographer and movement specialist to theatre companies.  At the Ecole Charles Dulin, she taught mime and movement, and then acted as assistant to [[Michael Cacoyannis]] for ''[[Jean-Baptiste Vivien de Châteaubrun|Les Troyennes]]'' at the Théâtre National Populaire, which production she later staged for the [[Festival d'Avignon]].  She also assisted [[Georges Wilson]] for his staging of ''Grandeur et Décadence de la Ville de Mahagonny''.

Thereafter, she returned to the classical dance, teaching in several Paris-area Conservatoires, notably the [[Nadia Boulanger]] Conservatory.

Cartier trained several high-level artists including Muriel Valtat and Betina Marcolin.  She was Consultant to Beryl Morina's authoritative ''Mime in Ballet'' (2000).  Cartier was the photographic model for Gordon Anthony in Felicity Gray's ''Ballet for Beginners'' (1952), and she continued to teach and coach in Paris until her death, on 11 May 2014.
