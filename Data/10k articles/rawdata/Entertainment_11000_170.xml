'''Alexander''' "'''Ally'''" '''Sloper''' is the eponymous [[fictional character]] of the [[comic strip]] '''''Ally Sloper'''''. He is one of the earliest comic strip characters and he is regarded as the first recurring character in [[comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Birch|first1=Dinah|title=The Oxford Companion to English Literature|date=24 September 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red-nosed and blustery, an archetypal lazy schemer often found "sloping" through alleys to avoid his landlord and other creditors, he was created for the British magazine ''[[Judy (satirical magazine)|Judy]]'' by writer and fledgling artist [[Charles H. Ross]], and inked and later fully illustrated by his French wife [[Émilie de Tessier]]&amp;mdash;a rare woman comic-strip artist at the time&amp;mdash;under the [[pseudonym]] "Marie Duval" (or "Marie Du Val";&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; sources differ).

The strips, which used [[text comics|text narrative beneath unbordered panels]], premiered in the 14 August 1867 issue of ''Judy'', a humour-magazine rival of the famous [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']]. The highly popular character was spun off into his own comic, ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]'', in 1884.

==Artists==
The first illustrations were by Ross, then Tessier took over. When publisher Gilbert Dalziel re-launched the cartoon as ''Ally Sloper's Half Holiday'', in 1884, Sloper was illustrated by [[William Baxter (illustrator)|William Baxter]] until his death in 1888. He was succeeded by [[W. Fletcher Thomas]], who continued the illustrations until approximately 1899, when the publisher invited [[C. H. Chapman]] to illustrate the series until it ended in 1916.&lt;ref name=alberta&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131113154031/http://exhibits.library.ualberta.ca/streetprint_sloper/ Ally Sloper Web Exhibit: "Ally Sloper’s Rise in Early Comic Culture"], [[University of Alberta]]. Retrieved 5 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==
The highly popular character was spun off into his own [[British comic|comic]], ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]'' in 1884. Sloper appeared in three [[feature films]] and a wide array of [[merchandising]] from [[pocket watch]]es to door stops. His popularity and influence led to his being used on occasion as a [[propaganda]] tool for the British government's policies. Sloper has also been cited as an influence on [[W. C. Fields]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s "little tramp" character&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, Roger (2003). [http://www.imageandnarrative.be/inarchive/graphicnovel/rogersabin.htm "Ally Sloper: The First Comics Superstar?"] ''Image &amp; Narrative'', Online Magazine of the Visual Narrative - ISSN 1780-678X. Retrieved 5 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and its imitators.

The arrival of the [[First World War]] in 1914 saw severe paper [[rationing]], and in 1916 the ''Half Holiday'' comic ceased production. Attempts after the war to revive Sloper proved short-lived, as Sloper was a somewhat stereotypical [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]] type, and did not fit into the new post-war world.

==History==
The website was founded by Justin Sevakis in July 1998.&lt;ref name="what is ann"/&gt; In May 2000, current CEO Christopher Macdonald joined the website editorial staff, replacing former editor-in-chief Isaac Alexander. In July 2002, Anime News Network launched its Encyclopedia, a collaborative database of anime and manga titles also including information about the staff, cast, and companies involved in the production or localization of those titles. In January 2007, ANN launched a separate version for [[Australia]]n audiences.&lt;ref name="australia"/&gt; On July 4, 2008, ANN launched its video platform with a library of anime trailers as well as its own news show ANNtv.

In the fall of 2004, the editorial staff at ANN became formally involved with the anime magazine ''[[Protoculture Addicts]]''; the magazine began publishing under ANN's editorial control in January 2005.&lt;ref name="join forces"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crocker|first=Janet|title=Addicts Nip/Tuck|url=http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/2004/10/feature/05.php|work=Anime Fringe|date=October 2004|accessdate=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 7, 2004, the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] online newsletter ''[[Sci Fi Weekly]]'' named the site the Web Site of the Week.&lt;ref

[[File:Antonio fava.jpg|thumbnail|Antonio Fava wearing a "Pulcinella" mask he made]]
'''Antonio Fava''' (born May 28, 1949) is an actor, comedian, author, director, musician, mask maker and Internationally renowned Maestro of [[Commedia dell'arte]] who lives in [[Reggio Emilia|Reggio Emilia, Italy]].

Born in Scandale, a small village in the province of [[Crotone|Crotone, Italy]].  He moved permanently to Reggio Emilia. Where he holds his annual courses In Commedia dell'arte. The masks that Antonio Fava creates are the worlds finest and, led him to be recognised and affirmed in the field. Thanks to the formation of an art school for Italian and foreign actors and his collaboration with leading theatre companies his masks are now on display in various museums worldwide.

He began his acting career at the National Theatre of Strasbourg. His adventure continued alongside the French writer Jean-Pierre Chabrol in Paris, while he was working for the realisation of the Theatre of the Jacquerie.

Back in Reggio Emilia Antonio Fava founded the Teatro del Vicolo, where, since 1980, he has staged many of his plays whilst continuing international tours that extend to [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Great Britain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Senegal]], [[Lebanon]], [[Japan]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Pakistan]], [[United States]], [[Canada]] and Australia. All the while pursuing various collaborations and directions, particularly at the Institute of Theatre of Barcelona, at the Resad (Real Escuela de Arte Dramatico) in Madrid, and at the CIP of Tramelan in Switzerland.

He has taught in universities and theatres all over the world, including the University of Exeter in England, at the Theatre Populaire Jurassien Lons le Saunier in France at l 'Ecole Superieure de Teatro-Universite du Quebec in Montreal, The Village Performing Arts Centre in Sydney and New York University  (among others) .

He directed "The Turkish in Italy" and "The Thieving Magpie", both by Rossini, for the Teatro Marrucino of Chieti. Also involved in the collaboration by librettist, he worked with the International Opera Theatre, publishing [[The Tempest]], presented in 2006.

One of his books, "The comic mask in Commedia dell'Arte" published by Andromeda and the Northwestern University Press USA, was translated into English in 2005. [http://www.internationaloperatheater.com/desktop6_050.htm &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]

Antonio Favas' latest book "Vita Morte E Resurrezione Di Pulcinella" (Life Death And Resurrection Of Pulcinella) first published in Italian in 2014 is a focused study and analysis of Antonio Favas' favourite character from Commedia dell'arte "[[Pulcinella]]" and how the character has survived and evolved since he (Pulcinella) first appeared in Commedia dell'arte. There is also a play by the same name that he put on in 2014. [http://www.guarattelle.it/repertorio/cetrulo.htm &lt;nowiki&gt;[2]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]

'''Arthur Francis Collins''' (February 7, 1864 – August 3, 1933) was an American baritone who was one of the most prolific and beloved of pioneer recording artists, regarded in his day as "King of the Ragtime Singers".

==Biography==
He was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and moved with his family to [[Barnegat, New Jersey]] around 1879 and as a teenager worked as a volunteer lifesaver on the Jersey shore, beginning an enthusiasm for sailing that became a lifelong pursuit. However, his fine [[baritone]] voice – heard in church and in local concert appearances – convinced Collins' family to send him back to Philadelphia for formal training.&lt;ref name=HoffmannCooper/&gt; After concluding his studies, Collins spent some 15 years touring with various stock companies and appearing in summer opera in St. Louis. None of these ventures turned out any long term prospects for Collins, and when he married actress and singer Anna Leah Connelly in 1895 Collins swore off show business and decided to study for a career in bookkeeping. Taking occasional roles for extra money, Collins appeared in a production given by the [[DeWolf Hopper]] Opera Company in 1898, and talent scouts for [[Edison Records]] requested Collins audition which, according to his wife, took place May 16, 1898.&lt;ref name=HoffmannCooper/&gt;

Within a few years, Collins proved one of the most productive and successful singers in the record business, and in his long career between 1898 and 1926 he worked for every record company active in the United States. He specialized in what were then called [[coon song]]s, popular African-American dialect numbers associated with [[vaudeville]] and [[minstrel shows]]. Collins also utilized an array of vocal effects and caricature voices which gave the impression that there were multiple persons at the horn on his recordings, though it was just Collins. Towards making that end of it more effective, Collins began to work in a duo format with tenor Joe Natus in 1901 and both sang in an Edison group called the Big Four Quartet.  It is assumed that Collins first came into contact with tenor [[Byron G. Harlan]] within the context of the Big Four Quartet, and from then until the end of Collins' career in the early 1920s, Harlan was Collins's duet partner. [[Collins &amp; Harlan]] were probably the most famous and popular male duo on early records.

In 1909, Collins joined John H. Meyer, [[Henry Burr]], and [[Albert Campbell (singer)|Albert Campbell]] in the [[Peerless Quartet]], a successful [[barbershop music]] group which toured as the Record Makers, and later as the Eight Popular Victor Artists. However, by 1917 bass Frank Croxton began to replace Collins on some records, a situation that became permanent by mid-1919 as Collins did not get along with Burr, who also served as the group's manager.

During a personal appearance at the Princess Theater in Medina, Ohio on October 20, 1921, Collins was badly injured when he fell through an open trap door. While he recovered well enough to resume his singing and recording career, his health began to decline afterward and in 1926, Collins retired, relocating to Florida with his wife. He died at the age of 69 in Tice, Florida on August 3, 1933.

==Recordings and legacy==
Arthur Collins recorded hundreds of songs, and in many cases he recorded the same song multiple times for various recording outfits. His signature song was ''[[The Preacher and the Bear]]'', which he first recorded in 1905. His rendition, widely dispersed among a variety of releases, constitutes the most popular non-operatic record made during the first decade of the twentieth century. Collins was still recording the number in 1922, and a 1908 remake of the piece for [[Victor Talking Machine|Victor]] remained in their catalog until 1941; at his personal appearances "The Preacher and the Bear" was invariably requested. His recording sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]], only the second one ever presented.&lt;ref name=Murrells1978/&gt; 

Collins lived up to his reputation as the "King of Ragtime Singers" and recorded more [[ragtime]] songs than any other singer during the era when ragtime was at its peak of popularity. Collins recorded some of [[Bert Williams]]'s songs before Williams did, and even recorded some numbers associated with Williams that the latter never waxed. Collins and Harlan also made best-selling records of tunes old and new that remain well cherished and iconic even in the twenty-first century, such as "[[Waiting for the Robert E. Lee]]", "[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]]", "Lily of the Valley", and "[[The Old Grey Mare]]". Collins survived into the early years of the [[Jazz Age]], and he and Harlan recorded the earliest record known to mention [[jazz]], "That Funny Jas Band from Dixieland" (Victor 18235, recorded January 12, 1917).&lt;ref name=Gracyk/&gt;

Collins' solo recordings as well as Collins and Harlan recordings are viewed as desirable by collectors, particularly the very early ones, and such enthusiasm about their output dates back to at least the 1940s.{{cn|date=September 2015}} Given the age of these recordings and their highly specialized frame of interest, few of them were reissued in the LP era; Collins has fared better in the digital age, but still lacks a single disc anthology of his characteristic recorded work.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

'''''Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern''''' is a travel and cuisine [[television show]] hosted by [[Andrew Zimmern]] on the [[Travel Channel]] in the US.  The first season debuted on Monday, February 6, 2007 at 9pm ET/PT.

''Bizarre Foods'' focuses on [[regional cuisine]] from around the world which is typically perceived as being disgusting, exotic, or bizarre.  In each episode, Zimmern focuses on the cuisine of a particular country or region.  He typically shows how the food is procured, where it is served, and, usually without hesitation, eats it.

Originally a one-hour documentary titled ''Bizarre Foods of Asia'', repeated showings on the Travel Channel drew consistent, considerable audiences.  In late 2006, TLC decided to turn the documentary into a weekly, one-hour show with the same premise and with Andrew Zimmern as the host. In 2009, Zimmern took a break from ''Bizarre Foods'' to work on one season of the [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Andrew Zimmern's Bizarre World|Bizarre World]]''.

|Sexy food
|This episode was a [[Valentine's Day]] special. It was a compilation episode about the cultural connections between food and sex, featuring foods that are supposed to be [[aphrodisiac]]s or are made of sexual organs of animals. Andrew visited the [[Mall of America]] where he gave out samples of bull testicles to see people's reactions and if they would eat it when told it would help their sex life. Author and food historian Linda Civitello talked about the history of eating reproductive organs. At the [[Midtown Global Market]] Andrew interviewed people about foods that were aphrodisiacs, including chocolate and oysters. He handed out chocolate-covered meal worms and crickets that tricked people into thinking they were pretzels. At the end Andrew and some others ate sushi off a naked woman, a practice called [[nyotai mori]].

'''''Blackroom''''' is an upcoming FPS title from the independent studio Night Work Games, created by former [[id Software]] developers [[John Romero]] and [[Adrian Carmack]]. The game was planned to be crowdfunded on the [[Kickstarter]] platform, but the project was cancelled in April 2016.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nightworkgames/blackroom-a-new-fps-from-romero-and-carmack?token=07458251|title=BLACKROOM: A New FPS from Romero &amp; Carmack|website=Kickstarter|accessdate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PCG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/romero-and-carmacks-blackroom-kickstarter-cancelled-to-develop-demo/|title=Romero and Carmack's Blackroom Kickstarter cancelled to develop demo|website=PC Gamer|date=April 29, 2016|accessdate=April 29, 2016|author=Angus Morrison}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is set to launch during the winter quarter of 2018.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;
== Gameplay ==
The game is set to be a [[first-person shooter]] in the same vein as classic shooters that Romero and Carmack first formulated in their early game development years. The game is described as "a return to fast, violent and masterful play on the PC."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The game will also feature various multiplayer modes along with its single player campaign, including co-operative play, deathmatch, and more. The controls are described as "fast, skillful movement with rocket jumping, strafe jumping and circle strafing," similar to the controls featured in a previous Id Software title, [[Quake (video game)|Quake]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
== Plot ==
The game takes place in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate world]]. HOXAR, a company that specializes in virtual and alternate reality technology, has created the ''HoloSims'', a device that simulates another world to its [[user (computing)|user]].&lt;ref name=BR1/&gt; However, something has gone awry with the system, and its users are beginning to see their simulations being warped and changed with terrifying results.&lt;ref name=BR1/&gt; The player plays as Dr. Santiago Sonora, a Chief hNode Engineer at HOXAR. After an encounter with the HoloSims device, Sonora begins to have a difficult time separating simulation from reality. Armed with the HOXAR device Boxel and their wits, it is up to Sonora to defeat the system.&lt;ref name=BR1/&gt;
==Development==
Romero's first intention to create a new [[first-person shooter]] goes back to 2012, when he admitted the idea, on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/romero/status/178715490523426816|title=John Romero|website=Twitter|date=April 10, 2012|accessdate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Going forward, during 2014, Romero again certified he was creating a new FPS, and said "I haven't made a shooter since 2000 [[Daikatana]]. So I'm basically starting to work on another one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/11/john-romero-i-havent-made-a-shooter-since-2000-so/?ncid=rss_truncated|title=John Romero: 'I haven't made a shooter since 2000, so ...'|date=August 8, 2014|website=Engadget|accessdate=April 26, 2016|author=Jessica Conditt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, few months before Kickstarter campaign, John Romero said about the game "I don't want to talk about it, because it's a really cool idea, an original idea. I've never seen anything like that before".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeuxvideo.com/news/457069/john-romero-doom-quake-travaille-sur-un-nouveau-fps.htm|title=John Romero (DOOM, Quake) travaille sur un nouveau FPS "vraiment unique"|website=Jeuxvideo|date=January 21, 2016|accessdate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romero announced the game's title as ''Blackroom'', on April 25, 2016, and started a [[Kickstarter]] [[crowdfunding]] campaign with an aim of $700,000 to be reached in 32 days.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BR1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/25/11491360/blackroom-game|title=John Romero and Adrian Carmack's new FPS Blackroom is set in a violent world of holographs|website=Polygon|date=April 25, 2016|accessdate=April 26, 2016|author=Colin Campbell }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project features [[John Romero]] as [[Video game design|lead designer]] and [[game programmer|programmer]],&lt;ref name=BR1/&gt; [[Adrian Carmack]] as [[game artist]]&lt;ref name=BR1/&gt; and [[Dokken]]'s [[George Lynch (musician)|George Lynch]] as composer;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; about Blackroom, Romero said "We're developing exactly the type of game we think a lot of shooter fans want. It's the type of shooter we're known for, and the type of game we love to play ourselves. It's a skillful shooter, from movement to weapon and map mastery".&lt;ref name=BR1/&gt;

On April 29, 2016, John Romero cancelled Blackroom's Kickstarter campaign, which stopped at over $131,000, pausing it to develop a Blackroom demo and planning to show that and reopen the campaign in the future.&lt;ref name=PCG/&gt;

The '''Bulgarian National Television''' ({{lang-bg|Българска национална телевизия}}, ''Bŭlgarska natsionalna televiziya'') or '''BNT''' (БНТ) is the [[public broadcasting|public broadcaster]] of [[Bulgaria]]. The company was founded in 1959 and began [[broadcasting]] on December 26 of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://bnt.bg/za-bnt/za-nas/|publisher=Bulgarian National Television|accessdate=28 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728062934/http://bnt.bg/za-bnt/za-nas/|archivedate=28 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began broadcasting in color in 1970. BNT's [[headquarters]] are located in [[Sofia, Bulgaria]], in a building located at the well-known address of 29 San Stefano Str.

BNT's first live broadcast was the parade on the occasion of the [[October Revolution]] anniversary.
BNT is funded from government funds (around 60%) with the rest coming from [[television commercial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Däther|first1=Kerstin|last2=Scheuer|first2=Alexander|last3=Tscholakov|first3=Radomir|title=The Financing of Public Service Broadcasting in Selected Central and Eastern European States|url=http://www.obs.coe.int/oea_publ/iris/iris_plus/focus6_2000.pdf.en|website=www.obs.coe.int|publisher=[[European Audiovisual Observatory]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010629010159/http://www.obs.coe.int/oea_publ/iris/iris_plus/focus6_2000.pdf.en|archivedate=29 June 2001|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It broadcasts two [[television]] channels: the over-the-air [[BNT 1]] and the international [[BNT 4]], a channel aiming to broadcast Bulgarian production only. Another channel, [[Efir 2]], existed between 1974 and 2000, and was later substituted by the private [[BTV (Bulgaria)|bTV]]. The channel was relaunched on October 2011 as [[BNT 2]]

BNT operates four regional broadcasting centres, based in [[Blagoevgrad]] (''Pirin'' programme), [[Varna]] (''More'' programme), [[Plovdiv]] (''Plovdiv'' programme) and [[Rousse]] (''Sever'' programme). They were merged to create the [[BNT 2]] channel in October 2011.

After Bulgaria started official [[DVB-T]] transmissions on March 1, 2013, BNT got its own multiplex, which is available nationally and is operated by First Digital Ltd. The multiplex includes [[BNT 1]] and [[BNT 2]]. The first new channel to be included to the multiplex is the new [[HDTV]] channel [[BNT 3]].

==History==
The first broadcast of the first Bulgarian television was in 1959. The archive had recorders, photos and movies which were for the public in the end of the 1950s and beginning of '60s. Since 1964 in the television the first diaries about the movies and the news on the program were made.

Since 1975 the first video programs in the 2 [[inch]] format were made.
In 1977 a fond about the broadcasting and movies from the program was created. In 1983 recorders with one-inch tape were made. The end of the 2 [[inch]] era was in 1984.

The year 1991 is very important for the Bulgarian National Television. All records started to be recorded on computer and digitized for better quality that is available in a variety of other formats. In 1992, a gold fond about all archives was created with 2,000 photos and 33,000 information objects.

'''Carl Ballantine''' (September 27, 1917 – November 3, 2009) was an [[United States|American]] [[Magic (illusion)|magician]], [[comedian]] and [[actor]]. Billing himself as "The Great Ballantine", "The Amazing Ballantine" or "Ballantine: The World's Greatest Magician", his [[vaudeville]]-style comedy routine involved transparent or incompetent [[stage magic]] tricks, which tended to flop and go "hilariously awry" to the wisecracking Ballantine's mock chagrin. He has been credited with creating comedy magic and has influenced both comics and magicians.&lt;ref name="mclellan"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-carl-ballantine5-2009nov05,0,162389,full.story| author=Dennis McLellan| title=Carl Ballantine dies at 92; comedy magician was in 'McHale's Navy' cast| newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]| date= November 5, 2009| accessdate=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Ballantine was born '''Meyer Kessler''' in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], the son of Israel Kessler (1883-1930) and Rose Cohen (1890-1973), both Jewish immigrants from [[Borshchiv]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Russian Poland]] (then part of the [[Austrian Empire]] and [[Second Polish Republic]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://jri-poland.org | title = Borszczow PSA AGAD Births 1872-98,1901-03 Marriages 1846,55-58,61,62,64,66-1905 Deaths 1877-1902| publisher = jri-poland.org | accessdate=2016-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://familysearch.org | title = Israel Kessler and Rose Kessler (Cohen), United States Census, 1930| publisher = archives.gov| accessdate=2016-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://familysearch.org | title = Israel Kessler, Illinois, Cook County Deaths| publisher = ilsos.gov| accessdate=2016-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://familysearch.org | title = Rose Kessler, Illinois, Cook County Deaths| publisher = ilsos.gov| accessdate=2016-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknamed the "Jipper," he was inspired at age 9 by his barber who would do magic tricks with thimbles while cutting his hair. His first job was working as a printer. In the 1930s, Kessler was doing professional straight magic as "Count Marakoff", "Carlton Sharpe", and "Carl Sharp"  in Chicago, helping support his family, and later moved to [[New York City]], where he performed in night clubs and on television variety shows. In the early 1940s, he gave up "real magic" when he realized he could not be as good as some of his peers. According to his daughter, “one night, one of his tricks got screwed up, he said something to cover, and the audience laughed. So he started adding more.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/arts/page2/jewish_masters_of_magic_materialize_at_skirball_20110425/| date=April 25, 2011| title=Jewish masters of magic materialize at Skirball| author= Edmon J. Rodman|newspaper=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|Jewish Journal]] | accessdate=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He switched to comedy magic and changed his name to "Carl Ballantine", after he noticed a bottle of [[Ballantine's|Ballantine whisky]] in an advertisement and decided it sounded "show-businessy and classy", and called the magic act "Ballantine, the World's Greatest Magician". He entertained troops during World War Two. He was billed as "The Amazing Mr. Ballantine" when he played the New York Capitol in 1950, and "The Great Ballantine" in ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'' on television in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2009_11_03.html#017999 |title=Carl Ballantine, R.I.P. |publisher=news from me blog |accessdate=May 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317110200/http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2009_11_03.html |archivedate=March 17, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first magician to play Las Vegas, appearing on a bill with [[Harry James]], [[Betty Grable]] and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] at [[El Rancho Vegas]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thewrap.com/tv/ind-column/obit-actor-carl-ballantine-dies-92-9697| title=Obit: Actor Carl Ballantine Dies at 92| date=November 4, 2009| newspaper=The Wrap news | accessdate=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a supporting player on the show, working with star [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Joe Flynn (US actor)|Joe Flynn]] and [[Tim Conway]]. An early television role cast him as Magician “Al Henderson”, working the 53rd precinct Christmas Party for brother-in-law Officer Toody in episode 15 of the 1st season of ''[[Car 54, Where Are You?]]'', first airing December 24, 1961. He also guest starred on ''[[The Partridge Family]]'', ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' as a used car salesman, and on ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' episode called "The Audition" which aired on January 23, 1967. He appeared on ''[[CHiPs]]'' as magician "The Great Marvello." The episode was entitled "Rustling" and aired January 28, 1978. In 1973 he appeared as Dr. Hankim in ''[[The Girl Most Likely to...]]''. His last feature film appearance was in ''Aimee Semple McPherson'', a 2006 [[biopic]] about the female evangelist.
Ballantine made his only appearance on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] as Lycus the slave merchant in the 1972 revival of ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' starring [[Phil Silvers]].&lt;ref name="webernyt"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/arts/10ballantine.html?ref=obituaries| author=Bruce Weber| title= Carl Ballantine, Comedian Who Played a Magician, Dies at 92| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date= November 10, 2009| accessdate=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a frequent panelist/judge on ''[[The Gong Show]]'', even appearing on the series finale of the NBC daytime version.

In later years he was a recurring voice artist on ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'', usually as Al J. Swindler, a purveyor of shoddy merchandise and goods.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Death==
Ballantine died on November 3, 2009 at age 92 at his home in [[Hollywood, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/afterword/2009/11/carl-ballantines-final-exit.html| title=Comedian-magician Carl Ballantine's final exit| date=November 4, 2009 |  author=Dennis McLellan| newspaper=The Los Angeles Times | accessdate=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His remains were cremated.

His was also the most copied act by a host of amateurs and professionals." According to [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], "Carl Ballantine created comedy magic. The combination of magic and comedy had perhaps been done before, but he truly defined it and made it his own."&lt;ref name="mclellan"/&gt;

The '''Cyprus International Film Festival ''' (CYIFF) is an annual [[film festival]] held in [[Cyprus]]. The festival takes place in [[Nicosia]] and Pafos in cooperation with the Cultural International Festivals. The International Film Festival of Cyprus operates since 2006 as an independent non-profit organization. CYIFF is the first international film festival held in Cyprus with a “competition section” in categories that include feature, short, animation, video art/dance/music, humanitarian, sport, and children films, devoted exclusively to independent emerging filmmakers.

==Awards and features==
The festival presents its CYIFF Golden [[Aphrodite]]  and Special Awards selected by a jury committee; it also features seminars, workshops and conferences for upcoming directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fest21.com/en/image/5th_cyprus_international_film_festival_13_22_october_2010 |title=5th CYPRUS INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL - 13-22 October 2010 &amp;#124; Filmfestivals.com |publisher=Fest21.com |date=2009-11-27 |accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dark and Light''''' was a [[pay to play]] fantasy [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] developed in [[Reunion Island]] by [[NPCube]] and published by [[Farlan Entertainment]]. It was released on June 6, 2006, to largely negative reviews. Though there was never an official announcement regarding discontinuation of service, the servers have been offline since 2008, ostensibly due to a lawsuit by [[vworld|VWORLD, LLC]].

[[Snail Games]] acquired the rights to ''Dark and Light'' in 2008 and developed a "fantasy survival sandbox RPG", which was released as [[early access]] in 2017 with the same name.

==Gameplay==
Dark and Light was a [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] [[Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game]] (MMORPG), set in a [[medieval]] [[fantasy]] world called Ganareth. Players could choose from 12 races, 10 of which could be either male or female (the exceptions being Half-Trolls, which were male only, and Fairies, which could only be female). There were 14 playable [[character classes]] to choose from, divided into four main [[archetypes]]: Fighter, Hunter, Healer, and Mage. Fighters were designed to have good defensive abilities and armour, and also had the ability to bring the focus enemies off of other characters and onto the fighter. They could be Warriors, Paladins, or Shadow Knights. Hunters were a support character, relying more on tactics and offensive support than on damage or defense. They could be Archers, Rangers, Bards, or Thieves. The primary purpose of Healers was to heal, as the name suggests, but they also had decent ranged damage capabilities. Healers could be Clerics, Monks, Druids, or Enchanters. Mages discarded personal safety in favour of large amounts of damage, in addition to [[Buff (computer gaming)|buffing]] other players. Mages could be Illustionists, Necromancers, or Wizards.

Progression in Dark and Light [[experience points]] gained in three separate systems, or "axes": Combat, Crafting, and Social. Combat experience was gained through defeating enemies, crafting from creating items, and social from joining [[Clan (computer gaming)|guilds]] and doing guild [[Quest (gaming)|quests]].

Characters had 12 different [[Item (gaming)|equipment]] slots (head, shoulders, left and right arms, gloves, chest, shirt, belt, pants, left and right thighs, and boots) in addition to two weapon slots, allowing for one ranged weapon, one or two melee weapons, or a shield. Armour was divided into 6 types: robe, cloth, leather, reinforced leather, chain mail, and plate.

Crafting was divided into "jobs", each specified by the items that that job could produce. [[Tanner (occupation)|Tanners]] made leather armour, [[tailors]] made cloth armour, armourers made chain and plate armour, [[blacksmiths]] made weapons, and [[jewelers]] made jewels, jewellery, and bracelets.

The world was split into Kingdoms. Each kingdom represented one of the Gods of the realm, who in turn were subordinate to Gothar: God of Gods.

The expansive [[game world]] was one of their larger selling points, offering 39,000 square kilometers (15,000 sq. mi.) of land to explore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkandlight.com/en/thegame/ Dark And Light Features]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706191527/http://www.darkandlight.com/en/thegame/ |date=July 6, 2011 }}, [http://www.darkandlight.com Dark and Light Official Website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621134431/http://www.darkandlight.com/ |date=June 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Development on ''Dark and Light'' started by [[NPCube]] in 2002. Later, under the "pressure from its investors and from the gaming community",&lt;ref name="Gamasutra news"&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=10474 Farlan Admits Dark and Light Problems, Offers 3 Months Free], [http://www.gamasutra.com Gamasutra], 14 August 2006 (retrieved 2 August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; it was released underdeveloped to retail and on the internet in 2006 after a prolonged [[beta testing]]. On August 14, 2006, the publisher, [[Farlan Entertainment]], stated that the game was released prematurely and has experienced problems due to its early release.

Farlan Entertainment signed with [[SnailGame Entertainment]], the distributor in [[China]], to provide additional help with the graphics. All of the current subscribers were given a free 3-month period to play the game.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra news"/&gt;

==Reception==
Dark and Light received largely negative reviews. Common complaints were the prevalence of [[gameplay]] [[software bug|bugs]], low quality [[graphics]], and poor overall implementation. Many reviewers liked the expansiveness and detail of the [[game world]]. [[MMORPG.com]] gave the game a 4 out of 10, saying that it "offers a degree of freedom that is rare in online games" but "the game in its current state is broken, full of bugs and does not have half of what was promised".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/game/58/view/reviews/load/43/page/1 Dark and Light Review], [http://www.mmorpg.com MMORPG.com], 2 October 2006 (retrieved 2 Aug 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; GameZone gave the game 5.3 out of 10, saying that "innovative gameplay elements are not enough to save a game that is fraught with concept flaws, lag and bugs and unfinished elements."&lt;ref&gt;[http://pc.gamezone.com/reviews/item/dark_and_light_pc_review Dark And Light PC Review]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108181110/http://pc.gamezone.com/reviews/item/dark_and_light_pc_review |date=November 8, 2010 }}, [http://www.pc.gamezone.com GameZone]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714040426/http://www.pc.gamezone.com/ |date=July 14, 2010 }}, 13 June 2006 (retrieved 2 August 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; [[OnRPG]] stated that "this game had potential (yes... HAD). The whole idea of a 15,000 square-mile world would be marvelous to behold and the possibilities are quite profound" but was still disappointed by prevalence of gameplay and graphics bugs, as well as losing gold when the character died&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onrpg.com/MMO/Dark-and-Light/review/Dark-and-Light-Review-Game-Had-Potential-But-Failed-to-Deliver Dark and Light Review: Game Had Potential But Failed to Deliver], [http://www.onrpg.com OnRPG]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
On 27 April 2007 [[VWORLD| VWORLD, LLC]] brought a lawsuit against NPCube and Farlan Entertainment for "software counterfeit, non-respect of the right to credit and paternity, unfair competition and parasitism." In September 2007, NPCube responded by suing VWORLD, on the grounds "of unfair competition and damage to NPCube's reputation", additionally claiming that instead of VWorldTerrain technology, they were using a technology called SCAPER, developed in-house by NPCube, and demanding €710,000 in damages.

NPCube's lawsuit against VWORLD was dismissed on 13 March 2008. Additionally, NPCube was found to be using VWorldTerrain technology, not SCAPER, and was liable for €50,000 in damages to VWORLD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prlog.org/10057834-dark-and-light-mmorpg-game-developer-npcube-dismissed-and-convicted-by-french-court.html Dark and Light MMORPG game developer NPCube dismissed and convicted by French Court], 18 March 2008 (retrieved 2 Aug 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fart lighting''', also known as '''pyroflatulence''' or '''flatus ignition''', is the practice of igniting the gases produced by human [[flatulence]], often producing a flame of a blue hue, hence the act being known colloquially as a "'''blue angel'''", "'''blue dart'''", or in [[Australia]], a "'''blue flame'''". The fact that flatus is flammable, and the actual combustion of it through this practice, gives rise to much [[humour|humorous]] derivation. Other colors of flame such as orange and yellow are possible with the color dependent on the mixture of gases formed in the colon. In order to "fire fart", one must have a fart prepared in the anal cavity, and a lighter at the ready. Then they fart onto the lighter.

In 1999 author Jim Dawson observed that fart lighting has been a novelty practice primarily among young men or college students for decades, but is discouraged for its potential for causing injury.&lt;ref name="Who Cut the Cheese?: A Cultural History of the Fart "&gt;{{cite book  | last =Dawson  | first =Jim  | title=Who Cut the Cheese?: A Cultural History of the Fart  | publisher=Ten Speed Press | year=1999  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=G8t8doQHi-MC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=%22fart+lighting%22 | accessdate=2007-10-07  | isbn =9781580080118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such experiments typically occur on camping trips and in single-sex group residences, such as tree-houses, dormitories, or [[Fraternity and sorority houses|fraternity houses]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/sp.2005.52.3.315 U. of California Press Web site] Retrieved October 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of video sharing features online, hundreds of self-produced videos, both documentary as well as spoof, have been posted to sites such as [[YouTube]].

Although there is little [[scientific]] discourse on the [[Combustion|combustive]] properties of [[flatus]], there are many anecdotal accounts of flatus ignition and the activity has increasingly found its way into popular culture with references in [[comic]] routines, [[movies]], and [[television]]; including [[cartoon]]s. In ''Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive Story of Frank Zappa'' author Neil Slaven quotes [[Frank Zappa]] for calling fart lighting "The manly art of fart-burning", and another book quotes the musician Kenny Williams for saying that it demonstrates "[[Gas compression|compression]], [[Making fire|ignition]], [[combustion]] and [[exhaust gas|exhaust]]."&lt;ref name="Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Slaven  | first =Neil  | title=Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive Story of Frank Zappa  | publisher=Omnibus Press  | isbn = 0711994366  | page = 100  | year=2003  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaGs3UTVm1sC  | accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Real Frank Zappa Book"&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Zappa  | first1 =Frank  | first2= Peter |last2=Occhiogrosso  | title=The Real Frank Zappa Book  | publisher=Simon and Schuster  | isbn = 9780671705725  | page = 85  | year= 1999  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FB0O_HCpBy0C  | accessdate=2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
The composition of flatus varies dramatically among individuals. Flatulence produces a mixture of [[gases]] with the following six as major components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Ness|first1=M. M.|last2=Cattau|first2=E. L.|title=Flatulence: pathophysiology and treatment|journal=American Family Physician|date=April 1985|pages=198–208|volume=31 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[carbon dioxide]],
* [[hydrogen]],
* [[hydrogen sulfide]],
* [[methane]],
* [[nitrogen]],
* [[oxygen]].

Methane burns in oxygen forming water and carbon dioxide often producing a blue [[hue]] ([[Heat of combustion|ΔH&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;]] = −891 kJ/mol),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080318174637/http://ull.chemistry.uakron.edu/erd/chemicals/6001/6744.html Methane&lt;!-- CRAP Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as:

:{{chem|CH|4}}(g) + 2 {{chem|O|2}}(g) → {{chem|CO|2}}(g) + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}}(g)

Hydrogen sulfide also combusts ([[Heat of combustion|ΔH&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;]] = −519 kJ/mol)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081013120329/http://ull.chemistry.uakron.edu/erd/chemicals/6001/6578.html Hydrogen sulfide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to

:2 {{chem|H|2|S}}(g) + 3 {{chem|O|2}}(g) → 2 {{chem|SO|2}}(g) + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}}(g)

The odor associated with flatus is due to hydrogen sulfide, [[skatole]], [[indole]], volatile amines and [[short-chain fatty acid]]s. These substances are detectable by olfactory neurons in concentrations as low as 10 parts per billion, hydrogen sulfide being the most detectable.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, M. D. and Bond, J. H. (1978) in Intestinal Gas and Gastrointestinal Disease&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gas production===
Some of the gases are produced by [[bacteria]] which live in [[symbiosis]] within the [[large intestine]]s of humans and other [[mammal]]s. The gases are created as a by-product of the bacteria's [[digestion]] of food into relatively simpler substances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A673508 BBC - h2g2 - Farts and Flatulence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The oxygen and nitrogen component of flatus can be accounted for by [[aerophagy]], while the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; component results from the reaction of stomach acids ([[HCl]]) with pancreatic bile ([[Sodium bicarbonate|NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]).

'''George Washington Dixon''' (1801?&lt;ref name="birth"&gt;Many biographies list his birth year as 1808, but Cockrell, ''Demons of Disorder'', 189, argues that 1801 is the correct date. This is based on Dixon's records at a New Orleans hospital, which list him as 60 years old in 1861, and a December 11, 1841 article in the ''Flash'' that says he was born "some forty years ago".&lt;/ref&gt; – March 2, 1861) was an American singer, stage actor, and newspaper [[editing|editor]]. He rose to prominence as a [[blackface]] performer (possibly the first American to do so) after performing "[[Coal Black Rose]]", "[[Zip Coon]]", and similar songs. He later turned to a career in journalism, during which he earned the enmity of members of the upper class for his frequent allegations against them.

At age 15, Dixon joined the [[circus]], where he quickly established himself as a singer. In 1829, he began performing "Coal Black Rose" in blackface; this and similar songs would propel him to stardom. In contrast to his contemporary [[Thomas D. Rice]], Dixon was primarily a singer rather than a dancer. He was by all accounts a gifted vocalist, and much of his material was quite challenging. "Zip Coon" became his trademark song.

By 1835, Dixon considered journalism to be his primary vocation. His first major paper was ''Dixon's Daily Review'', which he published from [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], in 1835. He followed this in 1836 with ''Dixon's Saturday Night Express'', published in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. By this point, he had taken to using his paper to expose what he considered the misdeeds of the upper classes. These stories earned him many enemies, and Dixon was taken to court on several occasions. His most successful paper was the ''Polyanthos'', which he began publishing in 1838 from New York City. Under its masthead, he challenged some of his greatest adversaries, including [[Thomas S. Hamblin]], Reverend [[Francis L. Hawks]], and [[Madame Restell]]. After a brief foray into hypnotism, "pedestrianism" (long-distance walking), and other pursuits, he retired to [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].

==Dixon in blackface==
[[File:Zip Coon sheet music.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sheet music cover for "Zip Coon", 1830s]]
Details about Dixon's childhood are scarce. The record suggests that he was born in [[Richmond, Virginia]], probably in 1801.&lt;ref name="birth"/&gt; His parents were [[working class|working-class]] folk, perhaps a barber and a washerwoman. He may have been educated at a charity school.&lt;ref name="Cockrell 96"&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Fairly detailed descriptions and portraits of Dixon survive; he had a swarthy complexion and a "splendid head of hair".&lt;ref&gt;September 19, 1841 ''Sunday Mercury''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the question of whether he was white or black is an open one. His enemies sometimes called him a "[[mulatto]]", a "[[Negro]]", or referred to him as "Zip Coon", the name of the black character in one of his songs. However, the weight of evidence suggests that if Dixon did have black ancestry, it was fairly remote.&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 193 note 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

A newspaper story from 1841 claims that at age 15, Dixon's singing caught the attention of a circus proprietor named West. The man convinced Dixon to join his traveling circus as a stablehand and errand boy.&lt;ref&gt;December 11, 1841 ''Flash''. Paraphrased in Cockrell 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Dixon traveled with this and other circuses for a time, and he appears as a singer and reciter of poems on bills dated from as early as February 1824.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} By early 1829, he had taken on the epithet "The American [[opera buffa|Buffo]] Singer".{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Over three days in late July 1829, Dixon performed "[[Coal Black Rose]]" in [[blackface]] at the [[Bowery Theatre|Bowery]], [[Chatham Garden Theatre|Chatham Garden]], and [[Park Theatre (Manhattan)|Park]] theatres in New York City. The ''[[Flash (magazine)|Flash]]'' characterized his audience as "crowded galleries and scantily filled boxes";&lt;ref&gt;December 11, 1841, ''Flash''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 96.&lt;/ref&gt; that is, mostly working-class. On September 24 at the Bowery, Dixon performed ''Love in a Cloud'', a dramatic interpretation of the events described in "Coal Black Rose" and possibly the first blackface [[farce]].&lt;ref name="Cockrell 96"/&gt; These performances proved a hit, and Dixon rose to celebrity, perhaps before any other American blackface performer had done so.&lt;ref name="Watkins 84"&gt;Watkins 84.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 14, Dixon's benefit at the [[Albany Theatre]] grossed $155.87, the largest take there since the opening night earlier that year.&lt;ref name="Cockrell 96"/&gt;

[[File:Dixon's Oddities.png|thumb|upright|Cover to the 1842 edition of ''Dixon's Oddities'']]
Dixon performed through 1834, most frequently at New York's three major theatres. In addition to blackface song-and-dance numbers, he did whiteface songs and scenes from popular plays; much of his material was quite challenging.&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Dixon's fame allowed him to pepper his material with satire and political commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles 76.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 25, 1830, he sang before a crowd of 120,000 in Washington, D.C., in support of the [[July Revolution]] in France. He began selling a collection of songs and skits he had popularized called ''Dixon's Oddities'' in 1830; the book remained in print long after. Dixon mostly played to a working-class audience, including in his repertoire such songs as "The New York Fireman", which  compared firefighters to the American Founding Fathers. [[Public speaking|Oratory]] made up another facet of his act; on December 4, 1832, the ''[[Baltimore Patriot]]'' reported that Dixon would read an address from the President at the [[Front Street Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1833, he started a small newspaper called the [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]] ''Cannon''. However, the publication saw little success, and by January 1834, he was performing again, now with new talents, such as [[ventriloquism]]. Dixon seemed untarnished by his yearlong hiatus. Reviews said that "his voice seems formed of the music itself—'' 'it thrills'', it animates' ..."&lt;ref&gt;''Bedford Enquirer'', quoted on January 18, 1834 ''Harrisburg Pennsylvania Telegraph''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 113. Emphasis in original.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Telegraph'' wrote, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Few Melodists have gained more celebrity or been so universally admired, ... The many effusions from the pen of this gentleman independent of his vocal powers, is sufficient proof of his being a man of considerable talent and originality—you should hear him sing his national air "on a wing that beamed in glory" [and it would be] unnecessary for us to enlarge on his merits as a vocalist—for his Melodies display a feeling of Patriotism which attracts the attention of every beholder.&lt;ref&gt;''Bedford Enquirer'', quoted in the January 18, 1834''Harrisburg Pennsylvania Telegraph''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March, Dixon performed "[[Zip Coon]]" for the first time. Although Dixon had previously sung "[[Long Tail Blue]]", another racist tale about a black "[[dandy]]" trying to fit into Northern white society,&lt;ref&gt;Damon, S. Foster (1936). ''Series of Old American Songs''. Providence: Brown University Library. Quoted in Lewis 257.&lt;/ref&gt; "Zip Coon" garnered acclaim and quickly became an audience favorite and Dixon's trademark tune. He later claimed to have written the song, although others performed it before him, so this seems unlikely.&lt;ref name="Watkins 84"/&gt; Dixon accompanied his singing with an earthy [[jig]].&lt;ref&gt;Knowles 76–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, the [[Anti-abolitionist riots (1834)|Farren Riots]] erupted. Young men in New York City targeted the homes, businesses, churches, and institutions of black New Yorkers and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]]. On the night of July 9, the mob stormed the Bowery Theatre. Manager [[Thomas S. Hamblin]] failed to quell them, and actor [[Edwin Forrest]] did not meet their expectations when they ordered him to perform. According to the ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'': 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Dixon, the singer (an American,) now made his appearance. "Let us have Zip Coon," exclaimed a thousand voices. The singer gave them their favorite song, amidst peals of laughter,—and his Honor the Mayor, who as the old woman said of her husband, is a "good-natured, easy fellow," made his appearance, delivered a short speech, made a low bow, and went out. Dixon, who had produced such amazing good nature with "Zip Coon," next addressed them—and they soon quietly dispersed.&lt;ref&gt;July 11, 1834 ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Dixon the editor==
In early 1835, Dixon moved to [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], a small town growing out of the Industrial Revolution. By April, he had taken the epithet "The National Melodist" and was editing ''Dixon's Daily Review''. The paper took as motto "Knowledge—Liberty—Utility—Representation—Responsibility"&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 101.&lt;/ref&gt; and championed the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], [[Radical Republicans|Radical Republicanism]], and the working class.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''Dixon's Daily Review'' also explored [[morality]] and women's place in the rapidly changing society of the urban North.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Dixon's criticism of his colleagues did not win him any friends, and in June, the ''[[Boston Post]]'' reported that he had "flogged one of the editors of the ''[[Lowell Castigator]]'', and was hunting after the other."&lt;ref&gt;June 11, 1835 ''[[Boston Post]]''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 102.&lt;/ref&gt; By the next month, Dixon had sold his paper, and the new publishers were eager to point out that Dixon no longer had anything to do with its production. By August, rumors were circulating that Dixon had started up another paper called the ''News Letter'' and was selling it in Lowell and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. If he did, no copies are known to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 1836, Dixon was touring again. He played many well-attended shows in Boston that month and did a play at the [[Tremont Theatre, Boston|Tremont Theatre]]. His recent forays into publishing had soured his image in the popular press, however, and ''[[The New York Times]]'' satirized his lower-class audience: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Tremont Teatre.'' At this classical establishment, Mr Dixon, "the American Buffo singer," is at present the star. His ''third'' night is announced! Will some of the enlightened citizens of the emporium favor us with their opinion of his performance? Is his Zip Coon as thrilling as Mr Wood's "Still so gently o'er me stealing?"&lt;ref&gt;March 11, 1836. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 103. Emphasis in original.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 16 and April 30, Dixon played the Masonic Temple in Boston. There he included material to appeal to his lower-class audience, such as a popular tune that he had adapted with lyrics about the [[Boston Fire Department]]. Nevertheless, he also reached out to a richer, middle-class patronage. For example, he played alongside a classically trained pianist, and he billed the performance as a "concert", a word typically reserved for high-class, non-blackface entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 103–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Dixon earned a third of the gross from this engagement: $23.50.&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 104.&lt;/ref&gt; He still owed money to the printer of ''Dixon's Daily Review'', so these earnings were put in trust for the conductor of the orchestra to pick up at a later date. Dixon and the printer grew impatient and presented a [[forgery|forged]] note to the trustee to collect early. Within a few days, Dixon was arrested and jailed in Boston. The press took the opportunity to castigate him again: "''George Washington Dixon'', now cormorant of [[Leverett Street Jail|Boston jail]], and ex-publisher, ex-editor, ex-broker, ex-melodist, &amp;c., is quite out of tune."&lt;ref&gt;June 2, 1836 ''New York Transcript''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Boston Courier]]" called Dixon "the most miserable apology for a vocalist that ever bored the public ear."&lt;ref&gt;May 1836 ''Boston Courier'', quoted in Leonard, William Torber (1986). ''Masquerade in Black''. Metuchen, New Jersey: The Scarecrow Press, p. 210; Quoted in Knowles 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the trial, held in mid-June, character witnesses testified that Dixon was "a harmless, inoffensive man, but destitute of business capacity" and "in reply to the question whether Dixon was ''[[non compos mentis]],'' I consider him as being on the frontier line—sometimes on one side, and sometimes on the other, just as the breeze of fortune happens to blow."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 104, 106.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, he was found not guilty when the prosecution failed to satisfy that he had known the document to be a forgery. Dixon took the opportunity to give a speech to the public outside. He then returned to the stage, earning a considerable $527.50 in late July.&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dixon was still guilty in the eyes of the press, however, and his letters to clear his name only made things worse:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mister Zip Coon is at his old tricks again. So far from possessing the ability to write a letter Miss Nancy-Coal-Black-Rose Dixon cannot begin to write ten consecutive words of the English language, and he must have encountered "the Schoolmaster abroad" in the Athenian city that teaches "penmanship in six lessons," and that lately too if he can sign his name.&lt;ref&gt;July 2, 1836 ''[[Spirit of the Times]]''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the end of 1836, Dixon had moved to Boston and started a new paper, the ''Bostonian; or, Dixon's Saturday Night Express''. The paper focused on working-class issues, religious values, and opposition to [[abortion]]. It followed the lead of the ''Daily Review'' in exposing allegedly immoral affairs of well known Bostonians. One story told of two personalities eloping. Other Boston papers called the story false, and the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' labeled Dixon a "knave". Dixon fired back, depicting the paper's editor, [[Henry F. Harrington]], as a monkey.&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1837, Dixon was again in legal trouble. Harrington accused Dixon of stealing half a ream of paper from the ''[[Boston Morning Post|Morning Post]]'', the principal competition to Harrington's ''Herald''. The judge eventually dismissed the case, agreeing that the paper had been taken, but ruling that no proof pointed to Dixon as the one who had taken it. Dixon gave another post-trial speech, followed by a stage show on February 4.&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 108–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not ten days after the end of the Harrington case, Dixon was charged with forging a signature on a bail bond pertaining to his previous debt from July 1835. He was sent to Lowell and jailed. The press responded with its usual glee: "George has been a great eulogist, the defender of the Constitution! But he cannot defend himself."&lt;ref&gt;February 13, 1837 ''Lowell Advertiser''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 110.&lt;/ref&gt; At his hearing on February 15, bail was set at $1000, an unheard of amount for the time.&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to pay, he was transferred to a jail in [[Concord, Massachusetts]].

Dixon's March 16 trial ended in conviction. His appeal to the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] on April 17 resulted in a hung jury, and his prosecutors dropped the charges against him. He gave another of his by now trademark post-trial addresses. The ''Boston Post'' wrote: "I begin to think that the Melodist bears a charmed life—and as was often said to be done in olden time, has made a bargain with the Being of Darkness for a certain term of years, during which he may defy the majesty of the law, and the wrath of his enemies."&lt;ref&gt;April 18, 1837 ''Boston Post''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another stage tour followed, with concerts in Lowell, New England, and Maine. This was an apparent success, with one reviewer saying that Dixon had "a voice which ''all'' unite in pronouncing to be of remarkable richness and compass."&lt;ref&gt;August 5, 1837 ''Portland Eastern Argus''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 113. Emphasis in original.&lt;/ref&gt; That Fall, he may have contemplated a tour with [[James Salisbury (entertainer)|James Salisbury]], a black musician and dancer well known in lower-class districts of Boston such as [[Ann Street, Boston|Ann Street]]. Instead, he appeared on December 6 at the upper-class [[Opera Saloon]], singing selections from popular operas. His fame (or notoriety) served to get him listed as a candidate for the Boston mayoral race in December. Dixon won nine votes, despite his polite refusal to serve should he be elected.&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 113–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Polyanthos''==
Dixon performed in Boston through the end of February 1838. That spring, he moved to New York City, where he re-entered the publishing business with a newspaper called the ''Polyanthos and Fire Department Album''. Dixon again championed the lower class and aimed to expose the sordid affairs of the rich, especially those who preyed upon lower-class women.&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 114–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early ''Polyanthos'' alleged that Thomas Hamblin, manager of the Bowery Theatre, was engaging in an affair with Miss Missouri, a teen-aged performer there. Within ten days of publication, Miss Missouri turned up dead, reportedly killed by "inflammation of the brain caused by the violent misconduct of Miss Missouri's mother and the publication of an abusive article in ''The Polyanthos''."&lt;ref&gt;June 20, 1838 ''Boston Post''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 115.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 28, Hamblin accosted Dixon. Another assault in August prompted Dixon to start carrying a pistol. Undaunted, Dixon continued his attacks on Hamblin and others in the ''Polyanthos''. He exposed another alleged affair, this between a merchant named Rowland R. Minturn and the wife of a shipmaker named James H. Roome. Twelve days after the publication, Roome killed himself.

Another article alleged that [[Francis L. Hawks]], an Episcopalian rector and reverend at the St. Thomas Church of New York, had been engaging in illicit sexual behavior. On December 31, Dixon was in court, charged with [[slander and libel|libel]]. Dixon spent a week in jail, then paid the $2000 bail. However, before he could even leave the jailhouse, he was arrested for a charge leveled by Rowland Minturn's brothers that Dixon's article had resulted in the man's death.

Bail was raised to $9000, an enormous amount, which Dixon protested. The prosecution argued that "The accused is a ''criminal of the blackest dye'', and by his infamous publication is morally guilty of no less than three murders, and I hope the court will not diminish the amount of bail one iota!"&lt;ref&gt;April 20, 1839 ''[[New York Herald]]''. Emphasis in original. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 118.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not. Nevertheless, a notorious New York madam named [[Adeline Miller]] paid it, and Dixon walked free. Only a month later, though, she had sent Dixon back to jail for unknown reasons. Facing seven counts (four from Hawks and three from the Minturns), the singer and editor remained incarcerated for two months while he awaited trial.

The Minturn case came first, on April 15, 1839. After three days, the jury came back unable to reach a verdict, and the Minturn brothers dropped the charges. Dixon returned to jail, but Hawks dropped his charges from four to three. The judge lowered bail to $900 on April 20, and Dixon walked free.

The press renewed their attacks on him: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;To those who know the true character, and something of the personal history of this imbecile vagrant, the exuberance of indignation with which he is pursued, appears truly ridiculous. That he is disgusting, a nuisance, and a bore, we know—and so is a spider. Nobody would dream, however, of extinguishing the latter insect with a park of artillery; though all the city seem to have fancied that George Washington Dixon could be conquered with no less. The truth of him is, that he is a most unmitigated fool; and as to his pursuing any person with malice, he is not capable of any sentiment requiring the appreciation of real or fancied injury. If he were kicked down stairs, he could not decide, until told by some one else, whether the kick was the result of accident or design, and if design, whether it was intended as a compliment or an insult.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Dispatch'' quoted on April 23, 1839 ''Boston Post''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dixon fought back in the ''Polyanthos'' by defending himself and his motives, and to some degree, he seems to have succeeded. The ''Herald'' for one admitted that his trial had exposed an unsavory facet of the upper class.&lt;ref&gt;April 19, 1839 ''New York Herald''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, on May 10, Dixon changed his plea to guilty regarding one count, and the next day did the same for the other two. He was sentenced to six months of hard labor at the New York State Penitentiary at [[Roosevelt Island|Blackwell's Island]]. Dixon reportedly responded, "This is a pretty situation for an editor."&lt;ref&gt;May 20, 1839 ''Boston Post''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 126.&lt;/ref&gt; He would later claim that Hawks had paid him $1000 to change his plea.&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blackwell's Island prison.jpg|thumb|The prison at Blackwell's Island, where Dixon served a six-month sentence for libel]]
The press reacted with its usual fervor: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dixon is a mulatto, and was, not many years ago, employed in this city, in an oyster house to open oysters and empty the shells into the carts before they were carried away. He is an impudent scoundrel, aspires to every thing, and was fit to be any body's fool. Somebody used his name (such as he called himself, for negroes have, by right, no surnames) as the publisher of a newspaper, in which every body, almost, was libelled. He is now caged, and, we may hope, will, when he comes out of prison, go to opening oysters, or some other employment appropriate to his habits and color.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Baltimore Chronicle]]'', quoted on November 11, 1843 ''New York Herald''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dixon served out his sentence then returned to New York. He resumed the ''Polyanthos'', emerging as the leader of a cadre of like-minded editors interested in exposing immorality.&lt;ref name="ANB 645"&gt;Cockrell, ''ANB'', 645.&lt;/ref&gt; Dixon now focused his efforts on Austrian dancer [[Fanny Elssler]], whom he accused of sexual misconduct. On August 21, 1840, he went so far as to rally a riot against her and then published the inciting speech in the ''Polyanthos''.&lt;ref name="Cockrell 128"&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 128.&lt;/ref&gt; He then targeted men who seduced young, working-class women, boarders who cheated their landlords, dysfunctional banks, and so-called British agents who were supposedly stirring up anti-American sentiment among American Indians and black slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Browder 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Dixon claimed to be "a battering-ram against vice and folly in every shape",&lt;ref&gt;June 19, 1841 ''Polyanthos''. Quoted in Browder 25.&lt;/ref&gt; writing: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Polyanthos'' cannot die. The protecting Providence that watches over the safety of the just, and defeats the machinations of the wicked, will make it bloom ... We prophesy that the latest descendant of the youngest newsboy will animate his hearers with the desire to emulate the enviable fame of DIXON! Our name will be handed down to the end of time as one of the most independent men of the nineteenth century! Our ''very hat'' will become a relic.&lt;ref&gt;January 17, 1841 ''Polyanthos''. Emphasis in original. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:National Police Gazette Restell.jpg|thumb|left|[[Penny press]] depiction of Madame Restell]]
On February 16, 1841, Dixon turned to a crusade against a New York [[abortion]]ist known as [[Madame Restell]]. He vowed to reprint an anti-Restell editorial every week until the authorities took notice or Restell stopped running newspaper ads for her abortion services. As for abortion itself, Dixon claimed that it subverted marriage by inhibiting procreation and encouraged female infidelity.&lt;ref name="Cockrell 128"/&gt;

Dixon kept his word, illustrating the editorial in later runs with woodcuts of Restell carrying a skull-and-crossbones emblem. When the March 17 ''[[New York Courier]]'' quoted the New York grand jury as saying "We earnestly pray that if there is no law that will reach this [Madame Restell], which we present as a ''public nuisance'', the court will take measures for procuring the passage of such a law",&lt;ref&gt;March 17, 1841 ''Courier''. Quoted in Browder 29. Emphasis in original.&lt;/ref&gt; Dixon responded with the March 20 headline "Restell caught at last!"&lt;ref&gt;March 20, 1841 ''Polyanthos''. Quoted in Browder 29.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 22, Ann Lohman, part of the husband-and-wife team behind the Restell name, was arrested. Dixon claimed vindication and covered the trial over several issues of the ''Polyanthos''. After her conviction on July 20, he wrote, "the monster in human shape ... has ... been convicted of one of the most hellish acts ever perpetrated in a Christian land!"&lt;ref&gt;July 21, 1841 ''Polyanthos''. Quoted in Browder 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, a man in the street struck Dixon in the head with an ax, which prompted some of the only positive press Dixon ever enjoyed that was not related to his singing. The ''Uncle Sam'' praised his editing and writing: "Go on martyr of virtue, go on and prosper! Go on getting out extras, and defending the sacredness of the marriage institution. Go on through malice, opposition, fiery trials, persecutions and assassinations—posterity will do thee justice ... !"&lt;ref&gt;September 18, 1841. The ''Uncle Sam''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with positive press, Dixon's troubles with the courts were not over. Around September 16, he allegedly assaulted Peter D. Formal, who was taking down bills that Dixon had posted. Dixon failed to appear for his October court date, and he skipped later dates on 1 and November 11. On November 19, he again was placed under arrest for [[obscenity]] as part of a citywide campaign by the district attorney to fight [[yellow journalism]]. On January 13, 1842, Dixon was indicted for the charges ''in absentia''. A warrant was issued for his arrest on April 13. By this time, he had handed the ''Polyanthos'' to [[Louse Leah]], and the charges were eventually dropped.

In late 1841, Dixon had gotten into another row with a colleague. [[William Joseph Snelling]] obtained a warrant against him, and Dixon countersued. Snelling wrote anonymously in the ''Flash'': 

&lt;blockquote&gt;We know him for a greedy, sordid, unscrupulous knave, of old; ... We are aware that men are judged by the company they keep and that we shall be blamed for having had anything to do with Dixon. Be it so.—We deserve rebuke, we have suffered for our folly and, if that is not enough, we are content to sit down in sackcloth and ashes; the meet attire of fools who trust to a person so vile that the English language cannot express his unmitigated baseness.&lt;ref&gt;11 or December 18, 1841 ''Flash''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In keeping with sexual morality at the time, Dixon and his colleagues sometimes checked bordellos for cleanliness, friendliness, and other factors.&lt;ref name="ANB 645"/&gt; Snelling drew from this, linking Dixon to organized prostitution and alleging that he had connections to a madam named [[Julia Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, another editor named [[George B. Wooldridge]] joined with Dixon for a few issues of the ''True Flash'', but they did not sell well. Rumors circulated at this time that Dixon was to be married, but sources disagreed over the identity of the fiancée; one said she was a Congressman's daughter, another that she was a madam. The ''Flash'' published a story that Julia Brown and a prostitute named [[Phoebe Doty]] had been seen fighting over the Melodist. If Dixon did marry, no record survives of it.&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
Beginning in 1842, Dixon took on a number of new occupations, including [[animal magnetism|animal magnetist]] and [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|spiritualist]] specializing in [[clairvoyance]]. A fad for public competitions and feats of endurance served as another vehicle for him to keep his name in the public eye; he became a "pedestrian", a long-distance sport [[race walking|walker]]. The participation of Dixon, a blackface singer and dancer, in these contests presaged the challenge dances of performers such as [[Master Juba]] and [[John Diamond (dancer)|John Diamond]] in the next few years.&lt;ref name="Knowles 77"&gt;Knowles 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, he competed to win $40,00 by walking 48 hours without stopping. When the prize failed to materialize, Dixon charged admission to watch him. Later that month, Dixon tried to break this record by walking 50 hours. His publicity was, as usual, bad. ''[[Brother Jonathan]]'' gave this advice: "walk in one direction all the time, from this part of the compass, till ocean fetches him up, and then see how far he can swim."&lt;ref&gt;July 19, 1842 ''Brother Jonathan''. Quoted in the ''[[Lowell Courier]]''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 137.&lt;/ref&gt; He walked for 60 hours that summer in Richmond, then did {{convert|30|mi|km}} in five hours and 35 minutes in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Dixon tried many other feats of endurance. For example, in late August, he stood on a plank for three days and two nights with no sleep. In September, he paced for 76 hours on a 15-foot-long (five-meter) platform.&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, he did not give up his singing career. In early 1843, Dixon (now called "Pedestrian and Melodist") appeared at least once more at the Bowery Theatre, and he played on bills with [[Richard Pelham]] and [[Billy Whitlock]]. On January 29, he performed at a benefit for [[Dan Emmett]]. These concerts would be his last.

Despite these excursions into athletics and entertainment, Dixon still considered himself an editor. He started a new paper called ''Dixon's Regulator'' by March, and he renewed his public crusade in New York. On February 22, 1846, he posted handbills around the city publicizing a meeting to protest further activities by Madame Restell. At the rally the next day, several hundred people listened to Dixon speak against the abortionist, calling for her neighbors to demand her eviction or else to take matters into their own hands. The crowd then walked to her residence three blocks away to shout threats but eventually dispersed.&lt;ref&gt;Browder 64–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Restell responded with a letter to the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' and ''[[New York Herald]]'' alleging that Dixon was simply trying to extort money from her in return for an end to his agitation: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Again and again have I been applied to by his emissaries for money, and as often have they been refused; and, as a consequence, I have been vilified and abused without stint or measure, which, of course, I expected, and, of the two, would prefer to his praise.&lt;ref&gt;February 25, 1846 ''Herald''. Quoted in Browder 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the [[Mexican–American War]], Dixon added some timely political references to "Zip Coon" and briefly returned to the public eye.&lt;ref name="Knowles 77"/&gt; Another crusade seems to have drawn Dixon away from New York in 1847. He was probably one of the first Radical Republicans to entrench himself as a [[Filibuster (military)|filibuster]] in the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] in a bid to annex more territory for the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''Demons'', 196 note 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dixon retired to [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], sometime before 1848. A city directory gives his address as "Literary Tent",&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell, ''ANB'', 646.&lt;/ref&gt; and his obituary in the ''[[Baton Rouge Daily Gazette and Comet]]'' states that the [[Poydras Market]] "by night and day, was the home of this waif upon society ... The 'General' was not without friends who contributed an odd 'five' to him when too frail to move about."&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, March 23, 1861, ''Baton Rouge Daily Gazette and Comet''. Quoted in Cockrell, ''Demons'', 196 note 190.&lt;/ref&gt; He came down with pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] sometime in mid-1860. On February 27, 1861, he checked into the [[New Orleans Charity Hospital]], noting his occupation as "editor". Dixon died on March 2.

'''''Giochi per il mio computer''''' ({{lang-it|Games for my PC}}), also known by the [[acronym]] '''GMC''', was an [[Italy|Italian]] magazine about computer video games and every thing concerns this topic. In [[Italy]] it represented the leading magazine in its field and frequently sold more than 100,000 copies. 

The internal structure, which is still unchanged, is divided in eight sections:
* editorial, which concerns general video games world's topics
* column of readers' letters
* previews of the most expected games
* general reviews
* hardware section, including a column dedicated to solve readers' problems
* the so-called "next level", a section dedicated to [[Mod (computer gaming)|mods]], free games and bargains in general
* guide for the complete game, sold with the magazine monthly
* closing credits

In past years GMC has had frequent changes in its publisher: when first created, it was published by ''Il mio castello editore'', in Autumn 2000 it was passed to a division of [[Future Publishing]], ''Future Media Italy'' (with many other editions) and finally since March 2007, it has been published by the Italian publishing house ''Sprea Media Italy''.

==Deus Ex leak==
The magazine was involved in the leak of a preview copy of the new Deus Ex game, but was later found to have no responsibility.

'''Arthur Gold''' (6 February 1917{{spaced ndash}}3 January 1990) and '''Robert Fizdale''' (12 April 1920{{spaced ndash}}6 December 1995) were an American two-piano ensemble; they were also authors and television cooking show hosts.

Gold and Fizdale met during their student years at the [[Juilliard School]].&lt;ref name="accessed August 25, 2006"&gt;[http://www.juilliard.edu/libraryarchives/peter.html accessed August 25, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;  They formed a lifelong [[gay]] partnership and shared interests in music (forming one of the most important piano duos of the 20th century), travel, and cooking.

== Two-piano ensemble ==
It has often been said that Gold and Fizdale revolutionized the art of performing as a two-piano duo.  While this may be a subjective statement, it must objectively be stated that they did commission and première many of the most important works for this ensemble in the second half of the 20th century, including works by [[John Cage]] ("A Book of Music" (1944) which is one of Cage's earliest experiments in using the prepared Piano),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johncage.info/workscage/bookofmusic.html accessed August 26, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Bowles]], [[Virgil Thomson]], [[Ned Rorem]] and many other important American Composers.

They were fixtures in New York's artistic community, being friends with literary and cultural figures such as [[Truman Capote]], [[James Schuyler]], [[George Balanchine]], [[Jerome Robbins]], among others.

In 1948, they were one of the wave of American artists, musicians and writers who took advantage of the first possibility since the end of World War II to freely travel in Europe.  "The Boys", as they were called by their friends,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turtlepoint.com/catalogue/corbett-thelettersofjamesschuyler.html accessed August 26, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; arrived in Paris with a letter of introduction from [[Marcelle de Manziarly]] to [[Germaine Tailleferre]] of [[Les six]] who invited them to a lunch with [[Francis Poulenc]] and [[Georges Auric]]. This lunch ended with Auric and Tailleferre taking the score of Thomson's "The Mother of Us All", which Thomson had given as a gift, turning it upside down on the piano and having Poulenc singing all of the roles (including [[Susan B. Anthony]]) in nonsense English syllables which were supposedly an imitation of [[Gertrude Stein]]'s Libretto while Tailleferre and Auric improvised a four-hands version of Thomson's score.&lt;ref&gt;Gold and Fitzdale (sic), Misia, the Life of [[Misia Sert]], William Morrow 1981, cited in Georges Hacquard, "Germaine Tailleferre: la Dame des Six" (L'Harmattan 1997)  pp143-144&lt;/ref&gt;

After this memorable day, Tailleferre invited the couple to her home in Grasse to spend two months while she was writing her ballet ''[[Paris-Magie (Tailleferre)|Paris-Magie]]'' and her opera ''[[Il était un petit navire (Tailleferre)|Il était Un Petit Navire]]''. She wrote two-piano versions of both works and gave them to the duo as a gift.  These manuscripts were later donated to the [[Library of Congress]] after the death of Robert Fizdale. Tailleferre later dedicated two other works to Gold and Fizdale: her [[Toccata for two pianos (Tailleferre)|Toccata for Two Pianos]] and her [[Sonata for two pianos (Tailleferre)|Sonata for Two Pianos]].&lt;ref&gt;Clinton-Narboni Duo Germaine Tailleferre: Music for Two Pianos and Piano Four-hands Elan recordings 1997 - liner notes&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Poulenc]] also wrote his own [[Sonata for two pianos (Poulenc)|Sonata for Two Pianos]] for  "the Boyz" (as he called them), a commission which was paid by their mutual friend the American Soprano and arts [[patron]] [[Alice Swanson Esty]], according to Poulenc's correspondence.

The duo also recorded a number of recordings featuring works by Les six, [[Vittorio Rieti]], and other composers, as well as a series of Concerto recordings with [[Leonard Bernstein]] and The [[New York Philharmonic]], including the Poulenc Concerto for Two Pianos, The Mozart Two Piano Concerto and Saint-Saëns's "Carnival of the Animals".

Bobby Fizdale was born Robert Fish, the son of John and Rose Fish of Chicago. Had a brother Walter.

Both Gold and Fizdale were of Russian Jewish descent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2014/Pearl%20River%20NY%20Orangetown%20Telegram/Pearl%20River%20NY%20Orangetown%20Telegram%20%201958/Pearl%20River%20NY%20Orangetown%20Telegram%20%201958%20-%200163.pdf#xml=http://fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=ffffffffc6bbede3&amp;DocId=4112373&amp;Index=Z%3a\Index%20U-F-P&amp;HitCount=3&amp;hits=3a8+3a9+3aa+&amp;SearchForm=C%3a\inetpub\wwwroot\Fulton_New_form.html&amp;.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary and culinary careers ==
In the late 1970s, Arthur Gold began to have problems with his hands which made it difficult for him to perform, so the duo began to write biographical works, including "Misia: the Life of [[Misia Sert]]" (William Morrow 1981), "The Divine Sarah: a Biography of [[Sarah Bernhardt]]" (Knopf 1991).

The duo also began writing food articles for ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine and began a television cooking show.  In 1984 they published "The Gold and Fizdale Cookbook" (Random House 1984), which is dedicated to their friend [[George Balanchine]], "In whose kitchen we spent many happy hours..."

In 1996, after the death of Fizdale, his estate donated the personal papers, recordings and other memorabilia to the Juilliard School, where they are kept in the school's Peter Jay Sharp Special Collections Room in the Juilliard Library &lt;ref name="accessed August 25, 2006"/&gt; Gold and Fizdale are buried alongside each other at [[Oakland Cemetery (Sag Harbor, NY)]].

'''''Heroes, Inc. Presents Cannon''''' is a two-issue [[comic book]] series that represents one of the earliest [[alternative media|independent comics]]. The first issue was self-published by prominent writer-artist [[Wally Wood]] in 1969, with a second issue published by [[CPL Gang Publications]] in 1976. 

This comic-book series is unrelated to the organization HEROES, Inc. ("Honor Every Responsible Officer's Eternal Sacrifice"), a [[Washington, D.C.]] aid group for families of police and firefighters killed in the line of duty.

==Publication history==
Writer-artist [[Wally Wood]], who by 1969 had had a critically admired two decades in [[comic books]], self-published the first issue of his mature-audience comic ''Heroes, Inc. Presents Cannon'' that year, after having already self-published a similar [[anthology]], ''[[witzend]]''. These comics, along with such titles by other publishers as ''[[Star Reach]]'' (1974), ''[[Big Apple Comix]]'' (1975), and ''[[American Splendor]]'' (1976), helped bridge the gap between the countercultural [[underground comics]] and traditional mainstream fare, providing genre stories for an adult audience. Like those other examples, it was a forerunner of the late-1970s rise of the modern [[graphic novel]] and the 1980s [[independent-comic publishing boom]].

Created for the military readership Wood had cultivated with his "[[Sally Forth (Wally Wood)|Sally Forth]]" feature in ''Military News'' and ''[[Overseas Weekly]]'', the first issue contained no [[U.S. Postal Service]] [[Indicia (philately)|indicia]]. The only publishing information was on an editorial page that gave the office address as "Armed Forces Dist., P.O. Box 23635, [[Pleasant Hill, California|Pleasant Hill]], [[California|Calif.]]" Not targeted at children and carrying no [[Comics Code]] seal, it contained more action/combat violence and more revealing clothing on nubile young women than did mainstream comics, though it did not contain [[nudity]] or [[Graphic violence|gore]]; most deaths occurred in [[silhouette]], off-panel or indeterminately within battle scenes. The glossy cover promoted "Amazing Adult Adventure".&lt;ref name=gcd-1&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/22428/ ''Heroes, Inc.'' #&lt;nowiki&gt;[nn]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Wallace Wood, 1969 Series] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, [[Heritage Auctions]] auctioned off a lot containing approximately 70,000 copies of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=15102&amp;Lot_No=17165 |title=Heroes, Inc.

===First issue===
The 32-page, color comic book featured three stories with original characters. Priced at 15 cents when a typical comic book cost 12 cents, it bore no issue number. The cover was signed "Wally Wood 1969". The inside front cover bore a full-page ad for Mesa Hills home sites, P.O. Box 788m [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[New Mexico]]. A full-page ad following the first story advertised National Diamond Sales, 437 12th Street, [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]]. The following page contained two stacked, half-page public-service ads, one for the [[U.S.O.]], the other for U.S. [[Savings Bonds]]. A Military Diamond Sales ad after the second story gave the same address as the editorial office. Following the stories came a full-page ad for U.S. Diamond Sales, 1128&lt;!--1128 correct--&gt; Broadway, Oakland, California. The inside back cover contained the text piece "Salute to a [[Medal of Honor|Medal of Honor Winner]]", with a black-and-white photo of [[U.S. Marine Corps]] Corporal Robert E. O'Malley. The back cover was yet another diamond-company ad, for Armed Forces Diamond Sales, 1126&lt;!--1126 correct--&gt; Broadway, Oakland, California.&lt;ref name=gcd-1 /&gt;

The 12-page "Cannon", written and [[inker|inked]] by Wood, [[penciler|penciled]] by [[Steve Ditko]] and credited as "Wally Wood 1969" and "Art by Ditko and Wood", was an espionage adventure starring the titular [[C.I.A.]] agent, who has been [[mind control|brainwashed]] so deeply during capture by [[cold war]] [[Communists]] that, when recovered by the [[United States]] military, scientists "go all the way" and continue brainwashing him as a covert assassin for the U.S. He is assigned to rescue or assassinate Jean Voss, a nubile young member of an American anti-missile defense lab, who was kidnapped by [[Asian people|Asian]], presumably [[Red Chinese]], Communists with a base on the [[Yucatán Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=gcd-1 /&gt;

"Cannon" went on to be published in serial form, in the [[U.S. Army]]'s ''Overseas Weekly'', starting in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/cannon.htm Cannon] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/6320FUwsW?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/cannon.htm Archived] from the original November 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Misfits", a 10-page story written and penciled by Wood, inked by [[Ralph Reese]] and credited "W. Wood and R. Reese" and "Copyright Wally Wood 1969", follows Mystra, a nubile young artificial human with telepathic abilities; Shag, a boyish blue [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] stranded on Earth; and Glomb, a human infant mutated by American scientists into a gray, simpleminded giant created to explore the planet [[Jupiter]]. Captives of the government's "Operation Misfit", they escape, only to confront an albino alien invader.
[[Image:HeroesInc2.jpg|thumb|''Heroes, Inc. Presents Cannon'' #2 (1976), cover art by Wally Wood]] 
Reflecting less-enlightened times, page two of "The Misfits" includes this dialog from English-speaking officials at the scene of a spaceship landing:
::"A man just emerged from the ship... Hey! It's a white man..."
::"Well, that's a good sign, anyway...."

The five-page "Dragonella" credited "Script by [[Ron Whyte]] and W. Wood", with art by Wood, and noted "Copyright Wally Wood 1969", is a humorous adventure of a fairy-tale baby abandoned in the woods and raised into nubile young womanhood by kindly dragons "of the ancient and noble family Isaurus". Named Dragonella, she eventually ventures forth seeking a prince to marry, accompanied by her dragon "brother", St. George.

Before the final story is a letter-from-the-editor page, hand-lettered on a montage of Wood art and signed "Sincerely, Wallace Wood".

===Second issue===
Published in 1976 by [[CPL Gang Publications]]—which published the fanzines ''CPL (Contemporary Pictorial Literature)'' and ''[[Charlton Bullseye (fanzine)|Charlton Bullseye]]'' before its various editors and artists, including [[Roger Slifer]] and [[Roger Stern]], turned professional—this magazine-sized second issue carried a $2 cover price.&lt;ref name=gcd-2&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/16406/ ''Heroes, Inc.'' #2, CPL/Gang Publications, 1976 Series] at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt;

It contains an untitled, seven-page "The Misfits" story written and drawn by Wood; the [[superhero]] feature "The Black Angel", with the seven-page story "Beware the Sirens” by co-writers [[Mike Vosburg]] and [[Roger Stern]], drawn by Vosburg; and an untitled, 14-page "Cannon" story, written and inked by Wood and drawn by Ditko.&lt;ref name=gcd-2 /&gt;

In addition, the inside front cover contained a full-page Wood illustration of the character Dynamo, from [[Tower Comics]]' ''[[T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents]]''; a two-page centerspread illustration of the original character Kadavahr the Resurrected, by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], plus an additional page of Byrne art; and a back-cover illustration by Wood of the original character Animan.&lt;ref name=gcd-2 /&gt;

The covers for both issues were colored by [[Marie Severin]].&lt;ref name=gcd-2 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4095">'''Historiographic metafiction''' is a term coined by Canadian literary theorist [[Linda Hutcheon]] in the late 1980s. The term is used for works of fiction which combine the literary devices of [[metafiction]] with [[historical fiction]]. Works regarded as historiographic metafiction are also distinguished by frequent allusions to other artistic, historical and literary texts (i.e. [[intertextuality]]) in order to show the extent to which works of both literature and [[historiography]] are dependent on the history of discourse.&lt;ref name=bolland&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolland|first1=John|title=Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient: A Reader's Guide|date=2002|publisher=Continuum|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-8264-5243-6|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is closely associated with works of [[postmodern literature]], usually novels. According to Hutcheon, in "A Poetics of Postmodernism", works of historiographic metafiction are "those well-known and popular novels which are both intensely self-reflexive and yet paradoxically also lay claim to historical events and personages".&lt;ref name = Hutcheon5&gt; Hutcheon 5&lt;/ref&gt; Works often described as examples of historiographical metafiction include: [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' (c.1608), [[John Fowles]]' ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1969), [[E. L. Doctorow]]'s ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'' (1975), [[William Kennedy (author)|William Kennedy]]'s ''[[Legs (novel)|Legs]]'' (1975), [[Salman Rushdie]]'s ''[[Midnight's Children]]'' (1981), [[A. S. Byatt]]'s ''[[Possession (Byatt novel)|Possession]]'' (1990), [[Michael Ondaatje]]'s ''[[The English Patient]]'' (1992), [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[Mason &amp; Dixon]]'' (1997) and many others. By seeking to represent both ''actual historical events'' from [[World War Two]] while, at the same time, ''problematizing'' the very notion of doing exactly that, [[Kurt Vonnegut|Kurt Vonnegut's]] ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' (1969) features a metafictional, "[[Janus|Janus-headed]]" perspective.&lt;ref name="jensen"&gt;Jensen, Mikkel (2016) "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00144940.2015.1133546 Janus-Headed Postmodernism: The Opening Lines of ''Slaughterhouse-Five'']" in ''[[The Explicator]]'', 74:1, 8-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hobby horse polo''' ({{lang-de|'''Steckenpferdpolo'''}}) is a mixed team sport played on [[hobby horse (toy)|hobby horses]]. It is similar to other polo variants, such as [[canoe polo]], [[cycle polo]], [[camel polo]], [[elephant polo]], [[golfcart polo]], [[Segway polo]], [[auto polo]], and [[yak polo]],{{fact|date=October 2014}} in that it uses parts of the polo rules, however it has its own specialities.

== Origin ==
Hobby horse polo originated in 1998 as a mockery of "polite society" in Heidelberg-Neuenheim, which led in 2002 to the foundation of the First Kurfürstlich-Kurpfälzisch Polo-Club in [[Mannheim]]. It has since become a trendy sport with various teams in German cities and gained some notoriety in the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.steckenpferdpolo.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Express_23_06_2013_Steckenpferdpolo-001.jpg |title=Ihr Steckenpferd Ist Polo |language=German |newspaper=[[Express (German newspaper)|Express]] |author=von Colia Schliewa |location=Dűsseldorf |date=23 June 2013 |accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playing polo with hobby horses has been described as a [[children's game]] in classical polo regions.&lt;ref name=burzumishikrimpatul/&gt; [[Hugh van Skyhawk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Background of Skyhawk in South Asian Sufis: Devotion, Deviation, and Destiny  |first1=Clinton |last1=Bennett |first2=Charles M.

In 2013 the Grütlihüüler [[Guggenmusik]] from Allenwinden ([[Baar, Switzerland]]) organized the first Steckenpferdpolo on Swiss soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://issuu.com/zugerpresse/docs/zugerbieter-20130828/3 |language=German |title=Fit fűr das Steckenpferdpolo Turnier |date=28 August 2013 |newspaper=[[Zuger Presse Zugerbieter]] |publisher=[[Zuger Presse]] |accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules ==
[[File:George Cruikshank - Tristram Shandy, Plate V. My Uncle Toby on his Hobby-horse.jpg|thumb|Hobby horse polo]]
The objective is to score [[Goal (sport)|goals]] against an opposing team. The goals are traditionally marked by [[bar stool]]s in width and height, but simple [[street hockey]] goals can also be used.&lt;ref name= rule/&gt; Players score by driving a small soft baseball into the opposing team's goal using a long-handled croquet mallet. A full match takes six 6-minute-long ''chukkas'' (periods) and each team may consist of six persons (depending of the size of the field and amount of interest). The minimum size of the field is {{convert|30|m|abbr=on|-1}} long and {{convert|15|m|abbr=on|-1}} wide. A 'last man' rule applies, as any player may act as goalkeeper.&lt;ref name=rule/&gt; As players need some protection against possible injuries, cleated shoes and shin guards are recommended. The mallets should be stable and are often taped to reduce the risk of losing the hammer head. It is preferred to hit the ball, but not other players.&lt;ref name=rule/&gt;

Each game starts with the teams in line behind their own goals and the ball in the midfield. On the [[umpire]]'s command "Polo go", the teams gallop against each other, in one hand their mallets, in the other their hobby horses, which have to be led between the legs of the player. It is not allowed to kick or stop the ball by foot.&lt;ref name=rule/&gt;

Fouls or failures to gallop or to listen to the umpires are treated by a "punitive sherry" (variously [[vodka]], [[Bread Drink|Brottrunk]] or [[Jägermeister]] based on the taste of the umpire) which has to be drunk on the spot.&lt;ref name=holz/&gt;&lt;ref name=rule&gt;[http://www.steckenpferdpolo.de/spielfeld-regeln/ Rules of the Game, German, at the Erster Kurfürstlich-Kurpfälzisch Polo-Club Mannheim website]&lt;/ref&gt; The German rules allow for hobbling under the influence, but require, quoting a [[The Ministry of Silly Walks|Monty Python walking gag]], "It has to look particularly silly".&lt;ref name=rule/&gt;

Swiss rules for [[ball in and out of play]] and the use of free kicks and time-outs are closer to [[association football]] and do not involve punitive sherries; instead free hits or penalties are applied for fouls.&lt;ref name=grue/&gt; As the [[Military of Switzerland|Swiss cavalry]] tradition keepers from Kavallerieverein [[Zug]] had been involved in the first tournament, riding boots are permitted but [[spur]]s are explicitly forbidden as well as the production of "[[manure|road apples]]" on the field by either horse or rider.&lt;ref name=grue&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gruehue.ch/index.php/jubifaescht/spielregeln-steckenpferd-polo |title=Spielregeln für das Steckenpferd-Polo-Turnier der Guggemusig Grütlihüüler |accessdate=2014-10-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015130808/http://www.gruehue.ch/index.php/jubifaescht/spielregeln-steckenpferd-polo |archivedate=October 15, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Swiss teams must confirm goals by neighing.&lt;ref name=grue/&gt;

At the hobby horse polo tournaments in [[Düsseldorf]], the victory cup "is not a cup, but a [[cheesecake]]", an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the traditional victor's quaffing from a [[milk bottle]] at the [[Indianapolis 500#Culture|Indianapolis 500]].&lt;ref name=holz/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1986">'''Imitation''' is the doctrine of [[artistic creativity]] according to which the creative process should be based on the close imitation of the [[masterpiece]]s of the preceding [[author]]s. This concept was first formulated by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] in the first century BCE as ''[[Dionysian imitatio|imitatio]]'', and has since dominated for almost two thousand years the Western [[history of the arts]] and [[classicism]];&lt;ref name="Shroder72p282"&gt;Shroder (1972) p.282 quote: {{quotation|The doctrine of imitation, to which Nodier indirectly refers, had of course dominated classicism from its inception, when Du Bellay recommended it in the ''Defense et illustration de la langue francaise''. The rejection of that doctrine was a basic tenet of romanticism; as Hugo put it in his preface to the 1826 edition of ''Odes et ballades, 'celui qui imite un poete ''romantique'' devient necessairement ''classique'', puisqu'il imite''.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 18th century, [[Romanticism]] reversed it with the creation of the institution of [[romantic originality]].&lt;ref name="Shroder72p282"/&gt; In the 20th century, the [[modernist]] and [[postmodern]] movements in turn discarded the romantic idea of creativity, and heightened the practice of imitation, copying, plagiarism, rewriting, appropriation and so on as the central [[Literary technique|artistic device]].

'''John Nicholls Booth''' (7 August 1912 – 11 November 2009) was an American professional [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] and prolific author on the history of magic performance.  He was recognized for his work, and is also known for having the longest running membership in the [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]].

==Biography==
Booth was born in [[Los Alamitos, California]] in 1912.  His interest in magic began at age 10 with a magic set, and began performing semi-professionally at age 15.&lt;ref name=Whaley&gt;{{cite book|last=Whaley|first=Barton|title=Who's who in Magic: An International Biographical Guide from Past to Present|year=1990|publisher=Jeff Busby Magic, Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1928, Booth joined the [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]] and began publishing a serial column on magic history called "Memoirs of a Magician's Ghost" in their publication, [[The Linking Ring]].&lt;ref name=Warren&gt;{{cite web|last=Warren |first=Bobby |title=Broken Wand: John Booth|url=http://www.magician.org/portal/en/node/903/ |work=International Brotherhood of Magicians |accessdate=14 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626062101/http://www.magician.org/portal/en/node/903/ |archivedate=26 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Booth completed his college education at [[McMaster University]] and focused on magic performance as his profession.  He began doing performances in high schools, but eventually was able to perform for nightclubs and hotel shows.  Around this time, Booth began to write his first two books, ''Forging Ahead in Magic'' and ''Marvels of Mystery'', which had later become classic reference works for magicians.&lt;ref name=Warren /&gt;

Later, Booth stopped doing show performances and left to become an ordained [[Unitarian Universalist]] minister in 1942.&lt;ref name=Whaley /&gt;  From personal accounts, Booth reported that he had been interested in becoming a minister, but was reluctant to begin seminary due to concerns about his own temperament.  He said, "Finally, in 1940, my misgivings evaporated. I closed a two week engagement as a magician in the Schroeder Hotel in Milwaukee (now the Hilton) and went directly to the Meadville Theological School now located in Chicago, the seminary of my father 30 years earlier."&lt;ref name=Warren /&gt;  He spent over 30 years as a minister in the Universalist Unitarian Church.

In 1986, Booth published the book ''Psychic Paradoxes''. The book debunked the tricks of fraudulent [[Mediumship|mediums]] and psychics and was published by [[Prometheus Books]].

Afterwards, Booth incorporated magic topics into personal lectures and produced historical documentaries on magic, and retired at the age of 88.&lt;ref name=Warren /&gt;  Booth died at age 97 in 2009.&lt;ref name=Warren /&gt;

==Legacy==
Booth is noted to be experienced as a nightclub magician who performed at premier hotels and venues,&lt;ref name=Warren /&gt; but his enduring contributions to magic were as a magic historian, as he documented magic performance through his own travels and experiences.&lt;ref name=Coleman&gt;{{cite book|last=Coleman|first=Earle J.|title=Magic : a reference guide|year=1987|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York|isbn=0313233977|page=165|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=Yck0Uqa5DMfZqQG3zoHQAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He was purported to be one of the first to create documentaries for presentations and lectures on magic.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Bruce|title=Great Rope &amp; Ring Tricks|year=2000|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=0806971797|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One such account was about finding a genuine performance of the [[Indian rope trick]], where he attempted to find a performer by paying for newspaper advertisements, but was ultimately unsuccessful at finding a true performance.&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt;

==Publications==
*''Magical Mentalism'' (1931)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Booth|first=John|date=January 1931|title=Booth's perfected die tube mystery|url=http://askalexander.org/display/33810/Linking+Ring/78|journal=Linking Ring|volume=10|issue=11|pages=1400|subscription=yes|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 1937, early in his career, Booth was given the Sphinx Award in category of ''Professional Magician'' from the magazine ''[[The Sphinx (magazine)|The Sphinx]]''.&lt;ref name=Sphinx&gt;{{cite book|last=Mulholland|first=John|title=The Sphinx|year=1937|publisher=Society of American Magicians|page=7|url=http://www.lybrary.com/the-sphinx-volume-36-p-5701.html|chapter=The Winners for 1937 of The Sphinx Award}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The award was given for his notable "Can You Tie It?" effect submitted to and published in an earlier issue of the magazine, and noted its novelty and the subtlety of its methodology.&lt;ref name=Sphinx /&gt;  Booth was awarded with the "[[John Nevil Maskelyne]] Prize" by [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]] in 1987 for his literary contributions to magic performance.&lt;ref name=Dawes&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawes|first=Edwin|title=Circle Without End the Magic Circle 1905|year=2005|publisher=Jeremy Mills Publishing|isbn=0954648498|author2=Michael Bailey}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also honored by being added to the [[Society of American Magicians]]' Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name=SAM&gt;{{cite web|title=Society of American Magicians Hall of Fame and Magic Museum|url=http://www.samhalloffame.com/members/|work=Society of American Magicians|accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo]]. – Buffaloes from [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], NY, whom buffaloes from Buffalo bully, bully buffaloes from Buffalo.
* Police police Police police police police Police police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last= Sterbenz|first= Christina|year= 2014|title= 9 Sentences That Are Perfectly Accurate|publisher= Business Insider Australia|url= https://www.businessinsider.com.au/weird-sentences-2014-1|accessdate= 10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; — Cops from [[Police, West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Police]], Poland, whom cops from Poland patrol, patrol cops from Poland.
* Rose rose to put rose roes on her rows of roses. ([[Robert J. Baran]]) – Rose [a person] rose [stood] to put rose [pink-colored] roes [fish eggs as fertilizer] on her rows of roses [flower].
* [[James while John had had had had had had had had had had had a better effect on the teacher]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/external/38/3802.pdf |title=Operator Jumble |issue=3802 |website=ACM-ICPC Live Archive |publisher=Baylor University |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309185345/http://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/external/38/3802.pdf |archive-date=9 March 2015 |dead-url=no |access-date=10 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; – With punctuation: "James, while John had had 'had', had had 'had had'. 'Had had' had had a better effect on the teacher", or James, while John had had 'had had', had had 'had'. 'Had had' had had a better effect on the teacher
* [[That that is is that that is not is not is that it it is]] – Grammatically corrected as: "That that is, is. That that is not, is not. Is that it? It is".
* Can can can can can can can can can can. – "Examples of the [[can-can]] dance that other examples of the same dance are able to outshine, or figuratively to put into the trashcan, are themselves able to outshine examples of the same dance". It could alternatively be interpreted as a question, "Is it possible for examples of the dance that have been outshone to outshine others?" or several other ways.
* If police police police police, who police police police? Police police police police police police.&lt;ref name="Gärtner 2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gärtner |first=Hans-Martin |title=Generalized Transformations and Beyond: Reflections on Minimalist Syntax |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSGSzYc45xoC&amp;pg=PA58 |date=2002 |publisher=Akademie Verlag |isbn=978-3-05-003246-7 |page=58 |volume=46 |series=Studia Grammatica |issn=0081-6469}}&lt;/ref&gt; – If the ''police police'' is what you might call the people who supervise, monitor, and maintain order amongst the regular police force, then who, in turn, supervises the police police? The answer: the ''police police police''. Hyphenating the noun constructs makes this easier to follow. Therefore, "{{bracket|The}} police-police {{bracket|, that the}} police-police-police police {{bracket|, themselves}} police {{bracket|the}} police", which means that "the police-police, who are policed by the police-police-police, are themselves responsible for policing the regular police force". In these sentences, the word ''police'' is used both as a collective noun ("police force") and as a verb ("to police {{bracket|someone or something}}"). This clause is also a [[reduced relative clause]], so the word ''that'', which could appear between the second and third words of the sentence, is omitted.
* [[Martin Gardner]] offered the example: "Wouldn't the sentence 'I want to put a hyphen between the words Fish and And and And and Chips in my Fish-And-Chips sign' have been clearer if quotation marks had been placed before Fish, and between Fish and and, and and and And, and And and and, and and and And, and And and and, and and and Chips, as well as after Chips?"&lt;ref name="Gardner 2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Martin |author-link=Martin Gardner |title=Aha!

=== Syntactic ambiguity ===
{{see|Syntactic ambiguity}}
Demonstrations of ambiguity between alternative syntactic structures underlying a sentence.

This sets up the infamous joke: 'How an elephant got into my pajamas I can't imagine. {{bracket|Laughter}}.' What, exactly, happened here? We take the following to be untendentious as far as it goes: the conventions of English are in force, and they entail that there are two ways to read the set-up sentence. Either it expresses the thought (I, in my pajamas, shot an elephant) or it expresses the thought (I) (shot (an elephant in my pajamas)).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Syntactic ambiguity, incrementality, and local coherence ===
Demonstrations of how ''incremental'' and (at least partially) ''local'' syntactic parsing leads to infelicitous constructions and interpretations.
* [[Reduced relative clause]]s
** [[Garden path sentence|The horse raced past the barn fell]].
** The coach smiled at the player tossed the frisbee (by the opposing team).&lt;ref name="Tabor Galantucci Richardson 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tabor |first1=Whitney |last2=Galantucci |first2=Bruno |last3=Richardson |first3=Daniel |title=Effects of merely local syntactic coherence on sentence processing |journal=Journal of Memory and Language |volume=50 |issue=4 |date=2004 |pages=355–370 |issn=0749-596X |doi=10.1016/j.jml.2004.01.001 |url=//psychology.uconn.edu/labs/solab/papers/tabor04eomlscosp.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701150939/http://psychology.uconn.edu/labs/solab/papers/tabor04eomlscosp.pdf |archivedate=1 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scope ambiguity and anaphora resolution ===
* [[Donkey sentence|Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it.]]&lt;ref name="Barker 1999"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csi.uottawa.ca/~kbarker/teach/5386/donkey.html |title=CSI 5386: Donkey Sentence Discussion |last=Barker |first=Ken |date=2 October 1999 |website=University of Ottawa School of Information Technology and Engineering |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516212356/http://www.csi.uottawa.ca/~kbarker/teach/5386/donkey.html |archive-date=16 May 2007 |dead-url=yes |quote='Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it' .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;: there is some single thing Y in the universe such that for every X in the universe if X is a farmer and Y is a donkey and X owns Y, then X beats Y. So the problem with the donkey sentence is that the scope of the variable corresponding to the donkey must be ''contained within the antecedent'' of the implication to prevent requiring the unconditional existence of the donkey. But the scope of the donkey variable must ''contain the consequent'' of the implication to allow the anaphoric reference! |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Punctuation ===
Punctuation can be used to introduce ambiguity or misunderstandings where none needed to exist. One well known example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/m/a-midsummer-nights-dream/summary-and-analysis/act-v-scene-1 |title=CliffsNotes: A Midsummer Night's Dream |issue=3802 |website=CliffsNotes |publisher=CliffsNotes |dead-url=no |access-date=18 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for comedic effect, is from ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' by William Shakespeare (ignore the punctuation to get the alternate reading).

Unfortunately, the joke fails because it depends on a mistaken grammatical analysis: in ''I will not put up with this sort of English'' the sequence ''up with this sort of English'' is not a constituent, ''up'' being a separate complement of the verb (in the traditional analysis it is an adverb).

&lt;!-- Please only add an example if you can cite a source to support its notability, or if it already has its own article on Wikipedia.

*A famous example for lexical ambiguity is the following sentence: "''{{lang|de|Wenn hinter Fliegen Fliegen fliegen, fliegen Fliegen Fliegen nach.}}''", meaning "When flies fly behind flies, then flies fly in pursuit of flies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://yourdailygerman.com/2016/12/09/crazy-german-sentence-structure/ |title=German is easy: "Lord of the Flies" |date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo#Siehe_auch |title=German Wikipedia article on the "Buffalo" sentence |date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}} It takes advantage of some German nouns and corresponding verbs being homonymous. While not noticeable in spoken language, in written language the difference shows: "Fliegen" ("flies"), being a noun, is written with a capital "F", whereas "fliegen" ("to fly"), being a verb, is not. The comma can be left out without changing the meaning. There are several variations of this sentence pattern, although they do not work as smoothly as the original.

[[Image:Magna Doodle.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A Magna Doodle drawing board]]'''Magna Doodle''' is a [[Magnetism|magnetic]] [[drawing]] [[toy]], consisting of a [[drawing board]], a magnetic [[stylus]], and a few magnet [[shape]]s. Invented in 1974, over forty million units have been sold to date worldwide, under several brands, product names and variations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Magna-doodle.jpeg|thumb|right]]  --&gt;

The key element of the toy is the magnetophoretic display panel, filled with a thick, opaque white liquid containing tiny dark [[Magnet|magnetic particles]].  These particles can be drawn to the drawing surface by a magnet-tipped stylus or optionally-provided shapes, or removed to the hidden back side by a sliding [[eraser]] bar.  The middle layer is divided into a [[honeycomb]] of cells, keeping the liquid static and the particles evenly distributed across the panel.  The liquid is formulated so that the floating particles can be pulled through it in response to the [[Electromagnetic force|magnetic forces]], but not due to [[gravity]].&lt;ref name="stuff"&gt;{{cite web
  |url = http://www.howstuffworks.com/magna-doodle.htm
  |title = How Magna Doodle Works

  |author =  Craig Freudenrich
  |date = 2001-02-07
  |publisher = [[HowStuffWorks]]
  |quote = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The toy was originally produced as "Magna Doodle" by [[Tyco Toys|Tyco]] until 1997, when Tyco was purchased by [[Mattel]]. Mattel then sold the toy under its [[Fisher-Price]] brand. The brand was later sold to the [[Ohio Art Company]].  Today, the "Magna Doodle" brand is owned by Cra-Z-Art.  Fisher-Price have produced their own alternative called the Doodle Pro, while Ohio Art produced the similar Doodle Sketch until 2016 when it sold the brand to [[Spin Master]]. The Doodle Pro is still available in the UK from the distribution company Megatel LTD.

Because the Magna Doodle uses no [[ink]] or [[graphite]], [[Scuba diving|scuba]] instructors use it as an underwater whiteboard when instructing students, and [[Underwater diving|divers]] who wish to pass short notes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The Magna Doodle is not specifically designed to work [[underwater]] and many of its components can [[rust]] or otherwise deteriorate over time.

==In popular culture==
In the TV comedy ''[[Friends]]'', a Magna Doodle is visible in Joey and Chandler's apartment, with various messages written on it throughout the series, referencing plot points, current events, inside crew jokes, or just random drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url = http://www.comedycentral.co.uk/friends/articles/the-ultimate-guide-to-every-magna-doodle-featured-in-friends

  |publisher = [[Comedy Central]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of the Magna Doodle was used in the 1990s game show [[Nick Arcade]] during their "Video Challenge" games. Before the challenge would begin, a contestant would write on the drawing board how many of the team's points they would risk on their teammate being able to successfully complete the challenge. The wager was kept secret until after the challenge ended.

[[File:Motion Picture Production Code.png|thumb|200px|1934 Motion Picture Production Code cover]]
The '''Motion Picture Production Code''' was the set of industry moral guidelines that was applied to most [[Cinema of the United States|United States motion pictures]] released by major studios from 1930 to 1968. It is also popularly known as the '''Hays Code''', after [[Will H. Hays]], who was the president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) from 1922 to 1945. Under Hays' leadership, the MPPDA, later known as the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), adopted the Production Code in 1930, and began rigidly enforcing it in mid-1934. The Production Code spelled out what was acceptable and what was unacceptable content for motion pictures produced for a public audience in the United States.

From 1934 to 1954, the code was closely identified with [[Joseph Breen]], the administrator appointed by Hays to enforce the code in Hollywood. The film industry followed the guidelines set by the code well into the late 1950s, but during this time, the code began to weaken due to the combined impact of television, influence from foreign films, controversial directors (such as [[Otto Preminger]]) pushing boundaries, and intervention from the courts, including the [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name=mcgmain&gt;McGilligan (2004), p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H:325"&gt;Sperling et al (1998), p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, after several years of minimal enforcement, the Production Code was replaced by the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA film rating system]].

==Background==
In 1922, after several risqué films and a series of off-screen scandals involving Hollywood stars, the studios enlisted [[Presbyterian polity#Elder|Presbyterian elder]] [[Will H. Hays]] to rehabilitate Hollywood's image. Hollywood in the 1920s was badgered by a number of widespread scandals, such as the murder of [[William Desmond Taylor]] and alleged rape of [[Virginia Rappe]] by popular movie star [[Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle]], which brought widespread condemnation from religious, civic, and political organizations. Many felt the movie industry had always been morally questionable.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyc. of World Biog.: Suppl.'' (2001), "Will Hays" entry&lt;/ref&gt; Political pressure was increasing, with legislators in 37 states introducing almost one hundred movie censorship bills in 1921. Faced with the prospect of having to comply with hundreds, and potentially thousands, of inconsistent and easily changed decency laws in order to show their movies, the studios chose self-regulation as the preferable option. Hays was paid the then-lavish sum of $100,000 a year (equal to ${{Inflation|US|100000|1922|fmt=c}} today).&lt;ref name="DH6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0QsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA92 p. 92].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leff &amp; Simmons (2001), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Hays, [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] under [[Warren G. Harding]] and former head of the [[Republican National Committee]],&lt;ref name="SS190"&gt;Siegel &amp; Siegel (2004), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; served for 25 years as president of the [[Motion Picture Association of America|Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America]] (MPPDA), where he "defended the industry from attacks, recited soothing ''[[patent medicine|nostrums]]'', and negotiated treaties to cease hostilities".&lt;ref name="DH6"&gt;Doherty (1999), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The move mimicked the decision [[Major League Baseball]] had made in hiring judge [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] as [[Commissioner of Baseball (MLB)|League Commissioner]] the previous year to quell questions about the integrity of baseball in the wake of the [[Black Sox Scandal|1919 World Series gambling scandal]]; ''[[The New York Times]]'' even called Hays the "screen Landis".&lt;ref name="ah"&gt;Yagoda (1980), [http://www.americanheritage.com/content/hollywood-cleans-its-act?page=1 "Hollywood Cleans Up&amp;nbsp;..."]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, Hays introduced a set of recommendations dubbed "The Formula", which the studios were advised to heed, and asked filmmakers to describe to his office the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]s of pictures they were planning on making.&lt;ref name="Pr20"&gt;Prince (2003), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] had already decided unanimously in 1915 in ''[[Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio]]'' that [[free speech]] did not extend to motion pictures,&lt;ref&gt;Jowett (1989), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and while there had been token attempts to clean up the movies before—such as when the studios formed the [[National Association of the Motion Picture Industry]] (NAMPI) in 1916—little had come of the efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Butters Jr. (2007), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New York (state)|New York]] became the first state to take advantage of the Supreme Court's decision by instituting a censorship board in 1921. [[Virginia]] followed suit the following year,&lt;ref&gt;Butters Jr. (2007), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; with eight individual states having a board by the advent of sound film,&lt;ref&gt;LaSalle (2000), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vieira (1999), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; but many of these were ineffectual. By the 1920s, the New York stage — a frequent source of subsequent screen material — had [[Toplessness|topless]] shows, performances filled with [[curse word]]s, mature subject matters, and sexually suggestive dialogue.&lt;ref name=But187&gt;Butters Jr. (2007), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the sound system conversion process, it became apparent that what might be acceptable in New York would not be so in [[Kansas]].&lt;ref name=But187/&gt; Moviemakers were looking at the possibility that many states and cities would adopt their own codes of censorship, requiring a multiplicity of versions of movies made for national distribution. [[Self-censorship]] seemed a preferable outcome.

In 1927, Hays suggested to studio executives that they form a committee to discuss film censorship. [[Irving G. Thalberg]] of [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer]], [[Sol Wurtzel]] of [[Fox Film Corporation|Fox]], and E. H. Allen of [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] responded by collaborating on a list they called the "Don'ts and Be Carefuls", which was based on items that were challenged by local censor boards. This list consisted of eleven subjects best avoided and twenty-six to be handled very carefully. The list was approved by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), and Hays created the Studio Relations Committee (SRC) to oversee its implementation;&lt;ref name="Vieira_p8"&gt;Vieira (1999), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prince (2003), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; however, there was still no way to enforce tenets.&lt;ref name="ah"/&gt; The controversy surrounding film standards came to a head in 1929.&lt;ref name="La1"&gt;LaSalle (2002), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bu"&gt;Butters Jr. (2007), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-code: "Don'ts" and "Be Carefuls", as proposed in 1927==

==Creation of the Code and its contents==
In 1929, a Catholic layman, [[Martin Quigley (publisher)|Martin Quigley]] (editor of the prominent trade paper ''[[Motion Picture Herald]]'') and the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit priest]] Father [[Daniel A. Lord]] created a code of standards&lt;ref name="Sm38"&gt;Smith (2005), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; and submitted it to the studios.&lt;ref name="DH6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs (1997), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord was particularly concerned with the effects of sound film on children, whom he considered especially susceptible to their allure.&lt;ref name="Sm38"/&gt;

In February 1930, several studio heads — including [[Irving Thalberg]] of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) — met with Lord and Quigley. After some revisions, they agreed to the stipulations of the Code. One of the main motivating factors in adopting the Code was to avoid direct government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Prince (2003), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the responsibility of the SRC (headed by Colonel Jason S. Joy, a former [[American Red Cross]] Executive Secretary&lt;ref name="Vieira_p8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flinders Inst. profile.&lt;/ref&gt;) to supervise film production and advise the studios when changes or cuts were required.&lt;ref&gt;LaSalle (2000), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DH8"&gt;Doherty (1999), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 31, the MPPDA agreed it would abide by the Code.&lt;ref name="DH2"&gt;Doherty (1999), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;The production code was intended to put a limitation on films which were distributed to a large audience, making it more difficult to appeal to all individuals in the audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tratner|first=Michael|date=2003|title=Working the Crowd: Movies and Mass Politics|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/crt.2003.0035|journal=Criticism|volume=45|issue=1|pages=53–73|doi=10.1353/crt.2003.0035|issn=1536-0342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The code was divided into two parts. The first was a set of "general principles" which prohibited a picture from "lowering the moral standards of those who see it",  so as not to wrongly influence a specific audience of views including, women, children, lower-class, and those of “susceptible” minds, called for depictions of the "correct standards of life", and lastly forbade a picture to show any sort of ridicule towards a law or "creating sympathy for its violation".&lt;ref name=LeffSimmons90/&gt; The second part was a set of "particular applications", which was an exacting list of items that could not be depicted. Some restrictions, such as the ban on homosexuality or on the use of specific curse words, were never directly mentioned, but were assumed to be understood without clear demarcation. Homosexuals being included under the forbiddance of sex perversion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noriega|first=Chon|date=1990|title="Something's Missing Here!": Homosexuality and Film Reviews during the Production Code Era, 1934-1962|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1224848|journal=Cinema Journal|volume=30|issue=1|pages=20|doi=10.2307/1224848|issn=0009-7101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depiction of [[miscegenation]] (i. e., marital or sexual relations between different races) was forbidden. It also stated that the notion of an "adults-only policy" would be a dubious, ineffective strategy that would be difficult to enforce;&lt;ref name="DH7"&gt;Doherty (1999), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; however, it did allow that "maturer minds may easily understand and accept without harm subject matter in plots which does younger people positive harm".&lt;ref name="DH11"&gt;Doherty (1999), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; If children were supervised and the events implied elliptically, the code allowed "the possibility of a cinematically inspired thought crime".&lt;ref name="DH11"/&gt;

The code sought not only to determine what could be portrayed on screen, but also to promote traditional values.&lt;ref&gt;Butters Jr. (2007), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual relations outside marriage—which were forbidden to be portrayed as attractive or beautiful—were to be presented in a way that would not arouse passion or make them seem permissible.&lt;ref&gt;LaSalle (2000), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Any act considered sex perversion, including any suggestion of same sex relationships, sex, or romance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All criminal action had to be punished, and neither the crime nor the criminal could elicit sympathy from the audience,&lt;ref name="ah"/&gt; or the audience must at least be aware that such behavior is wrong, usually through "compensating moral value".&lt;ref name=LeffSimmons90/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Black (1996), pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Authority figures had to be treated with respect, and the clergy could not be portrayed as comic characters or villains. Under some circumstances, politicians, police officers, and judges could be villains, as long as it was clear that those individuals portrayed as villains were the exceptions to the rule.&lt;ref&gt;LaSalle (2000), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire document was written with Catholic undertones, and stated that art must be handled carefully because it could be "morally evil in its effects", and because its "deep moral significance" was unquestionable.&lt;ref name="DH7"/&gt; It was initially decided to keep the Catholic influence on the Code secret.&lt;ref name="Bl43"&gt;Black (1996), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; A recurring theme was "that throughout, the audience feels sure that evil is wrong, and good is right".&lt;ref name="ah"/&gt; The Code also contained an addendum commonly referred to as the Advertising Code, which regulated advertising copy and imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty (1999), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 19, 1930, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' published the entire content of the Code and predicted that state film censorship boards would soon become obsolete;&lt;ref name="B4445"&gt;Black (1996), pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the men obliged to enforce the code—Jason Joy (head of the Committee until 1932) and his successor, Dr. James Wingate—were generally unenthusiastic and/or ineffective.&lt;ref name="DH8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B5051"&gt;Black (1996), pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; The first film the office reviewed, ''[[The Blue Angel]]'', which was passed by Joy with no revisions, was considered indecent by a California censor.&lt;ref name="B5051"/&gt; Although there were several instances where Joy negotiated cuts from films and there were definite—albeit loose—constraints, a significant amount of lurid material made it to the screen.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs (1997), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Joy had to review 500 films a year with a small staff and little power.&lt;ref name="B5051"/&gt; He was more willing to work with the studios, and his creative writing skills led to his hiring at Fox. On the other hand, Wingate struggled to keep up with the flood of scripts coming in, to the point where Warner Bros.' head of production [[Darryl Zanuck]] wrote him a letter imploring him to pick up the pace.&lt;ref&gt;Vieira (1999), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, the Hays office did not have the authority to order studios to remove material from a film, and instead worked by reasoning and sometimes pleading with them.&lt;ref name="Bl52"&gt;Black (1996), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Complicating matters, the appeals process ultimately put the responsibility for making the final decision in the hands of the studios.&lt;ref name="DH8"/&gt;

One factor in ignoring the code was the fact that some found such censorship prudish, due to the libertine social attitudes of the 1920s and early 1930s. This was a period in which the [[Victorian era]] was sometimes ridiculed as being naïve and backward.&lt;ref&gt;LaSalle (2000), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Code was announced, the liberal periodical ''[[The Nation]]'' attacked it.&lt;ref name="B4445"/&gt; The publication stated that if crime were never to be presented in a sympathetic light, then taken literally that would mean that "law" and "justice" would become one and the same. Therefore, events such as the [[Boston Tea Party]] could not be portrayed. If clergy must always be presented in a positive way, then hypocrisy could not be dealt with either.&lt;ref name="B4445"/&gt;'' [[The Outlook (New York)|The Outlook]]'' agreed, and, unlike ''Variety'', ''The Outlook'' predicted from the beginning that the Code would be difficult to enforce.&lt;ref name="B4445"/&gt; The [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of the 1930s led many studios to seek income by any way possible. Since films containing racy and violent content resulted in high ticket sales, it seemed reasonable to continue producing such films.&lt;ref&gt;LaSalle (2000), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, the flouting of the code became an open secret. In 1931, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' mocked the code and quoted an anonymous screenwriter saying that "the Hays moral code is not even a joke any more; it's just a memory"; two years later ''Variety'' followed suit.&lt;ref name="DH8"/&gt;

===Breen era===
On June 13, 1934, an amendment to the Code was adopted which established the [[Production Code Administration]] (PCA) and required all films released on or after July 1, 1934, to obtain a certificate of approval before being released. The PCA had two offices - one in Hollywood, and the other in New York City. The first film to receive an MPPDA seal of approval was ''[[The World Moves On]]'' (1934). For more than thirty years, virtually all motion pictures produced in the United States adhered to the code.&lt;ref name="Doherty"&gt;Doherty (2006), [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/19/AR2006051901530.html "The Code Before&amp;nbsp;..."].&lt;/ref&gt; The Production Code was not created or enforced by federal, state, or city government; the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Hollywood]] studios adopted the code in large part in the hopes of avoiding government censorship, preferring self-regulation to government regulation. The enforcement of the Production Code led to the dissolution of many local censorship boards.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Father Daniel A. Lord, a Jesuit, wrote: "Silent smut had been bad. Vocal smut cried to the censors for vengeance." Thomas Doherty, Professor of American studies at [[Brandeis University]], has defined the code as "... no mere list of Thou-Shalt-Nots, but a homily that sought to yoke Catholic doctrine to Hollywood formula. The guilty are punished, the virtuous rewarded, the authority of church and state is legitimate, and the bonds of matrimony are sacred."&lt;ref name="Doherty"/&gt; What resulted has been described as "a Jewish owned business selling Catholic theology to Protestant America".&lt;ref&gt;Scott (2004, 2010){{page needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Joseph I. Breen — a prominent Catholic layman who had worked in public relations — was appointed head of the new Production Code Administration (PCA). Under Breen's leadership of the PCA, which lasted until his retirement in 1954, enforcement of the Production Code became rigid and notorious. (Even cartoon sex symbol [[Betty Boop]] had to change from being a [[flapper]] and began to wear an old-fashioned housewife's skirt.) Breen's power to change scripts and scenes angered many writers, directors, and Hollywood [[media proprietor|mogul]]s. Breen influenced the production of ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', objecting to any explicit reference to Rick and Ilsa having slept together in Paris and to the film mentioning that Captain Renault extorted sexual favors from his supplicants; however, both remained strongly implied in the finished version.&lt;ref&gt;Univ. of Virginia (2000–01), [http://explore.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/show/censored/walkthrough/film1 "Censored"]&lt;/ref&gt; Adherence to the Code also ruled out any possibility of the film ending with Rick and Ilsa consummating their adulterous love, making inevitable the ending with Rick's noble renunciation, one of ''Casablanca''{{'}}s most famous scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Harmetz, pp. 162–166 and Behlmer, pp. 207–208, 212–13.{{full citation needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major instance of censorship under the Production Code involved the 1934 film ''[[Tarzan and His Mate]]'', in which brief nude scenes involving a [[body double]] for actress [[Maureen O'Sullivan]] were edited out of the master negative of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Vieira (1999), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Another famous case of enforcement involved the 1943 [[western movie|western]] ''[[The Outlaw]]'', produced by [[Howard Hughes]]. ''The Outlaw'' was denied a certificate of approval and kept out of theaters for years, because the film's advertising focused particular attention on [[Jane Russell]]'s breasts. Hughes eventually persuaded Breen that the breasts did not violate the code, and the film could be shown.&lt;ref&gt;Mondello (2008), 
[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93301189 "Remembering&amp;nbsp;..."], npr.org; accessed December 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PCA also engaged in political censorship. When Warner Bros. wanted to make a film about [[concentration camp]]s in [[Nazi Germany]], the production office forbade it&amp;mdash;citing the above-mentioned prohibition on depicting "in an unfavorable light" another country's "institutions [and] prominent people"&amp;mdash;with threats to take the matter to the federal government if the studio went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Warner-Jack/dp/B002Y58G7S ''The Brothers Warner'' (2007)], written by Cass Warner&lt;/ref&gt; This policy prevented a number of anti-Nazi films being produced. In 1938, the [[FBI]] unearthed and prosecuted a Nazi spy ring, subsequently allowing Warner to produce ''[[Confessions of a Nazi Spy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Holden (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=APjtGBMiSG8C&amp;pg=PA238 p. 238].&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Three Stooges]]' short subject ''[[You Nazty Spy!]]'' (January 1940) being the first Hollywood film of any sort to openly spoof the Third Reich's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Mushnik (2013), [https://nypost.com/2013/07/14/three-stooges-first-to-blast-hitler/ "Three Stooges&amp;nbsp;..."], nypost.com; accessed December 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some films produced outside the mainstream studio system flouted the code. One example is ''[[Child Bride]]'' (1938), which featured a nude scene involving a twelve-year-old child actress ([[Shirley Mills]]). The Code began to weaken in the late 1940s, when the formerly taboo subjects of rape and [[miscegenation]] were allowed in ''[[Johnny Belinda (1948 film)|Johnny Belinda]]'' (1948) and ''[[Pinky (1949 film)|Pinky]]'' (1949), respectively.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In 1951, the MPAA revised the code to make it more rigid; the 1951 revisions spelled out more words and subjects that were prohibited. In 1954, Breen retired, largely due to ill health, and Geoffrey Shurlock was appointed as his successor. ''Variety'' noted "a decided tendency towards a broader, more casual approach" in the enforcement of the Code.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Decline of the Production Code===
Hollywood continued to work within the confines of the Production Code throughout the 1950s, but during this time, the movie industry was faced with very serious competitive threats. The first threat came from a new technology, [[television]], which did not require Americans to leave their house to watch moving pictures. Hollywood needed to offer the public something it could not get on television, which itself was under an even more restrictive censorship code. In addition to the threat of television, there was also increasing competition from foreign films, such as [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948), the Swedish film ''[[One Summer of Happiness]]'' (1951), and [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[Summer with Monika]]'' (1953). [[Vertical integration]] in the movie industry had been found to violate [[anti-trust]] laws, and studios had been forced to give up ownership of theaters by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' (1948). The studios had no way to keep foreign films out, and foreign films were not bound by the Production Code. Some British films — ''[[Victim (1961 film)|Victim]]'' (1961), ''[[A Taste of Honey (film)|A Taste of Honey]]'' (1961), and ''[[The Leather Boys]]'' (1963) — challenged traditional gender roles, and openly confronted the prejudices against [[homosexuals]], all in clear violation of the Hollywood Production Code. In keeping with the changes in society, sexual content that would have previously been banned by the Code was being retained.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In 1952, in the case of ''[[Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously overruled its 1915 decision (''[[Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio]]'') and held that motion pictures were entitled to First Amendment protection, so that the [[New York State Board of Regents]] could not ban ''The Miracle'', a [[short film]] that was one half of ''[[L'Amore (film)|L'Amore]]'' (1948), an [[anthology film]] directed by [[Roberto Rossellini]]. Film distributor [[Joseph Burstyn]] released the film in the U.S. in 1950, and the case became known as the "Miracle Decision" due to its connection to Rossellini's film. That reduced the threat of government regulation, which had formerly been cited as justification for the Production Code, and the PCA's powers over the Hollywood industry were greatly reduced.&lt;ref name="H:325"/&gt;
By the 1950s, American culture also began to change. A boycott by the [[National Legion of Decency]] no longer guaranteed a film's commercial failure, and several aspects of the code had slowly lost their taboo. In 1956, areas of the code were re-written to accept subjects such as [[miscegenation]], adultery, and prostitution. For example, the re-make of a pre-Code film dealing with prostitution, ''[[Anna Christie (1930 film)|Anna Christie]]'', was cancelled by MGM twice, in 1940 and in 1946, as the character of Anna was not allowed to be portrayed as a prostitute. By 1962, such subject matter was acceptable, and the original film was given a seal of approval.&lt;ref&gt;Schumach (1964), pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Notorious1946.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Some directors found ways to get around the Code guidelines; an example of this was in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1946 film, ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'', where he worked around the rule of three-second-kissing only by having the two actors break off every three seconds. The whole sequence lasts two and a half minutes.&lt;ref name=mcgmain/&gt;]]
By the late 1950s, increasingly explicit films began to appear, such as ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'' (1959), ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly Last Summer]]'' (1959), ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), and ''[[The Dark at the Top of the Stairs]]'' (1961). The MPAA reluctantly granted the seal of approval for these films, although not until certain cuts were made. Due to its themes, [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959) was not granted a certificate of approval, but it still became a box office smash, and, as a result, it further weakened the authority of the Code.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch (2007) {{page needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the forefront of contesting the Code was director [[Otto Preminger]], whose films violated the Code repeatedly in the 1950s. His 1953 film ''[[The Moon Is Blue]]'', about a young woman who tries to play two suitors off against each other by claiming that she plans to keep her virginity until marriage, was released without a certificate of approval. He later made ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (1955), which portrayed the prohibited subject of drug abuse, and ''Anatomy of a Murder'' (1959), which dealt with murder and rape. Like ''Some Like It Hot'', Preminger's films were direct assaults on the authority of the Production Code, and their success hastened its abandonment.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch (2007) {{page needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1960s, films began to deal with adult subjects and sexual matters that had not been seen in Hollywood films since the early 1930s. The MPAA reluctantly granted the seal of approval for these films, although again not until certain cuts were made.&lt;ref&gt;Leff &amp; Simmons (2001){{page needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the [[Holocaust]] film ''[[The Pawnbroker (film)|The Pawnbroker]]'', directed by [[Sidney Lumet]] and starring [[Rod Steiger]], was initially rejected because of two scenes in which the actresses [[Linda Geiser]] and Thelma Oliver fully expose their breasts, as well as due to a sex scene between Oliver and [[Jaime Sánchez (actor)|Jaime Sánchez]] described as "unacceptably sex suggestive and lustful". Despite the rejection, the film's producers arranged for Allied Artists to release the film without the Production Code seal, with the New York censors licensing the film without the cuts demanded by Code administrators. The producers appealed the rejection to the Motion Picture Association of America. On a 6-3 vote, the MPAA granted the film an exception, conditional on "reduction in the length of the scenes which the Production Code Administration found unapprovable". The requested reductions of nudity were minimal; the outcome was viewed in the media as a victory for the film's producers.&lt;ref name=Leff1996&gt;Leff (1996), pp. 353–376.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Pawnbroker'' was the first film featuring bare breasts to receive Production Code approval. The exception to the code was granted as a "special and unique case" and was described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' at the time as "an unprecedented move that will not, however, set a precedent". In ''Pictures at a Revolution'', a 2008 study of films during that era, [[Mark Harris (journalist)|Mark Harris]] wrote that the MPAA approval was "the first of a series of injuries to the Production Code that would prove fatal within three years".&lt;ref&gt;Harris (2008), pp. 173–176.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Warner Bros. released ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (film)|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'', the first film to feature the "Suggested for Mature Audiences" (SMA) label. When [[Jack Valenti]] became President of the MPAA in 1966, he was faced with censoring the film's explicit language. Valenti negotiated a compromise: the word "screw" was removed, but other language remained, including the phrase "hump the hostess". The film received Production Code approval despite the previously prohibited language.&lt;ref name=LeffSimmons90/&gt;

That same year, the British-produced, American-financed film ''[[Blowup]]'' was denied Production Code approval. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] released it anyway, the first instance of an MPAA member company distributing a film that did not have an approval certificate. That same year, the original and lengthy code was replaced by a list of eleven points. The points outlined that the boundaries of the new code would be current community standards and good taste. Any film containing content deemed suitable for older audiences would feature the label SMA in its advertising. With the creation of this new label, the MPAA unofficially began classifying films.&lt;ref name=LeffSimmons90&gt;Leff &amp; Simmons (2001), pp. 270–271; 286–287.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production Code abandoned===
By the late 1960s, enforcement had become impossible and the Production Code was abandoned entirely. The MPAA began working on a rating system, under which film restrictions would lessen. The [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA film rating system]] went into effect on November 1, 1968, with four ratings: ''G'' for general audiences, ''M'' for mature content, ''R'' for restricted (under 17 not admitted without an adult), and ''X'' for sexually explicit content. By the end of 1968, Geoffrey Shurlock stepped down from his post.&lt;ref name=LeffSimmons90/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doherty (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mBAiYzRx5LQC&amp;pg=PA334 p. 334].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, the Swedish film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'', directed by [[Vilgot Sjöman]], was initially banned in the U.S. for its frank depiction of sexuality; however, this was overturned by the Supreme Court. In 1970, because of confusion over the meaning of "mature audiences", the ''M'' rating was changed to ''GP'', and then in 1972 to the current ''PG'', for "parental guidance suggested". In 1984, in response to public complaints regarding the severity of horror elements in PG-rated titles such as ''[[Gremlins]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', the ''PG-13'' rating was created as a middle tier between ''PG'' and ''R''. In 1990, the ''X'' rating was replaced by ''NC-17'' (under 17 not admitted), partly because of the stigma associated with the ''X'' rating, and partly because the ''X'' rating was not trademarked by the MPAA; [[Pornography|pornographic]] bookstores and theaters were using their own ''X'', ''XX'', and ''XXX'' symbols to market products.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, [http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-27/news/mn-1406_1_r-rated-films "X Film&amp;nbsp;..."], latimes.com, September 27, 1990; accessed May 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the name change from ''X'' to ''NC-17'', this highest rating is very rarely issued due to its ongoing stigma.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} As the American Humane Association's Hollywood office depended on the Hays Office for the right to monitor sets, the closure of the Hays Office in 1966 corresponded with an increase in animal cruelty on movie sets. According to a writer for Turner Classic Movies, the association's access did not return to Hays-era standards until 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/18071/Jesse-James/articles.html "Jesse James" entry], tcm.com; accessed May 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

This rebirth led to high international praise as well as box-office success, unseen since the golden age of Mexican cinema of the 1930s to 1960s. The quality of Mexican films suffered in the decades following the golden age due in part to Mexican audiences watching more overseas films, especially Hollywood productions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsao|first=Leonardo Garcia|year=2007|title=After the Breakthrough of Amores Perros, What's next for Mexican Cinema?|url=|journal=Film Comment|volume=37|pages=11–13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the rise of infamous Mexican genres such as [[Luchador films]], ''[[Mexican sex comedy|sexicomedias]]'' and ultimately the low-budget direct-to-video [[Mexploitation]] film.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maciel|first=David|year=|title=The Cinematic Renaissance of Contemporary Mexico 1985-1992|url=|journal=UC Davis|volume=|pages=70–85|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many themes addressed in Nuevo Cine Mexicano include the roles of gender, identity, tradition, and socio-political conflicts within Mexico itself. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The movement has achieved international success with films such as director [[Alfonso Cuarón|Alfonso Cuaron’s]] ''[[Y Tu Mamá También]]'' (2001), which was nominated for an  [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Original Screenplay and at the [[Golden Globes]] for Best Foreign Film, and [[Alejandro González Iñárritu|Alejandro G. Iñárritu]]'s Amores Perros (2000), which was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards.

There is debate over when this “new wave” of Mexican cinema began and whether there are any clear parameters as to how it differs from other Mexican film movements other than "newfound audience enthusiasm".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hind|first=Emily|year=2004|title=Post-NAFTA Mexican Cinema 1998-2002|url=|journal=Studies in Latin American Popular Culture|volume=23|pages=95–111|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cite the actual rejuvenation of Mexican cinema as starting in 1998 in a Post-NAFTA Mexico, beginning with the film ''[[Sexo, pudor y lágrimas]]'' (Sex, Shame and Tears).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Others believe it began because of the international acclaim of the films such as ''[[Like Water for Chocolate (film)|Like Water For Chocolate]]'' (1992) and its nomination for Best Foreign Film at the Golden Globes. The definition of Nuevo Cine Mexicano also leads to the question, "What is a Mexican film?"—is it Mexican film because of who makes or stars in it, or because it takes place in Mexico.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mex-Cine: Mexican Filmmaking, Production, and Consumption in the Twenty-first Century|last=Aldama|first=Frederick Luis|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Michigan|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==




The Golden Age of Mexican Cinema occurred from the 1930s to the 1960s, afterward, a period of low-budget B-movies funded by the state of Mexico was the primary source for films for the Mexican public.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A resurgence of Mexican cinema was believed to occur in the 1970s, however, its success was short-lived as the majority Mexican filmgoers preferred Hollywood films.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;



Before the 1990s, the Mexican film industry was primarily funded by the state in coordination with the Instituto Méxicano de Cinematografía (Mexican Film Institute of Cinematography), IMCINE. There was a decrease in Mexican audiences watching Mexican-produced films in favor of Hollywood blockbusters as well as "film production dropp[ing] to an all-time low" due to the economic crash in 1994.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The IMCINE produced roughly five films a year during the crisis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The main influx of directors and filmmakers, as well as funding, primarily came from the IMCINE. The incoming filmmakers, nicknamed the "1990s Generation", were helped by the generation of 1968 with their filmmaking skills.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

One of the most successful filmmakers of the 1990s Generation of Mexican filmmakers, [[Guillermo del Toro]], said that "In the 80’s there was a huge void in Mexican cinema, then my generation picked up the staff in the early 90s."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The New Migration - "Y Tu Mama" Is Just the Latest in a Trend of Quality Mexican Films Traversing the Rio Grande|last=Garcia|first=Chris|date=April 5, 2002|work=Austin American Statesman|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the 1970s "technical experimentation" took precedence within the film community, and through the 1980s films "catered to the lowest common denominator", the 1990s Generation learned by working together with the filmmakers of the late 60s and 70s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Themes==


Social divisions within Mexico is a reoccurring theme within Nuevo Cine Mexicano, including the films ''Y Tu Mamá También, El crimen del Padre Amaro'' (2002), and ''Amores Perros.''




Though the films touch on the “socio-geographic divisions” of Mexico in different ways.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In ''[[Amores Perros]]'', the economic divisions are portrayed through the differences between the main characters' homes. El Chivo lives in a "seedy residence" which that is juxtaposed with his daughter’s "respectable home".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With ''[[El crimen del padre Amaro]]'' (The Crime of father Amaro) the traditions of the Catholic Church, which remains a prominent influence in Mexico, is questioned when a young priest has sex with a teenager leading to her death from an abortion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other subjects such as homosexuality and political corruption are briefly touched on in ''[[Y Tu Mamà También]]'' (And Your Mother Too), helping to set up a background of what Mexico is and is not.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Menne|first=Jeff|year=2007|title=A Mexican Nouvelle Vague: The Logic of New Waves Under Globalization|url=|journal=Cinema Journal|volume=47|pages=70–92|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two main male characters in the film differ in their social standings because of their families' political connections. What ultimately breaks their friendship apart is having sex with one another.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Within Nuevo Cine Mexicano, filmmakers try to portray such social and economic troubles within Mexico through different perspectives, which commonly goes against the sometimes stereotypical portrayals of Mexico and its inhabitants in U.S. and European films.

The characterizations of Europeans or foreigners, specifically Spaniards, are relatively negative. In several works in Nuevo Cine Mexicano, the conflict within the story is due to a person of Spanish descent. Either the non-foreigners in the film who associate with the Spaniards are drastically changed or the Spaniards themselves meet a tragic end.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The filmmakers use this trope in order to recall Mexico's past, specifically with Spain's colonization of Mexico.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The style of the films generally mimics the "art house" films of previous decades, since the state of Mexico had the greatest authority over the production of movies.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Directors specifically adopted this style in order to move away from the state and into independent productions, which a majority of Nuevo Cine Mexicano is.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Production studios normally fund one to two million dollars per film, due to the lack of mainstream production.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The influence of "[[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTAtrade]] and tax policies" made it harder for the public to fund such productions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Main players==
[[File:Fernando Eimbcke.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Fernando Eimbcke]]]]
[[Guillermo del Toro]], [[Alfonso Cuaron]], and [[Alejandro González Iñárritu|Alejandro G. Inarritu]] make up the "Three Amigos", the main Mexican film directors of Nuevo Cine Mexicano. All have created films produced in Mexico and Hollywood. Critics and award shows consider these three as the premier directors in their craft.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Each produces and uses actors and cinematographers from Mexico, even in their Hollywood made productions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; "Poster-boy" actors [[Gael Garcia Bernal]] and [[Diego Luna]] have also moved on to several Hollywood productions, yet their popularity in Mexican cinema has proven to endure throughout the years.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==European influence==
Since 2000, some directors have made "independent productions looking for more personal expression", under a greater influence of [[European cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= González Vargas, Carla| title= Rutas del cine mexicano | publisher= CONACULTA IMCINE | year=2006| isbn=9685893292|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most representative films of this trend{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} are ''[[Japón (film)|Japón]]'' and ''[[Batalla en el cielo]]'' (''Battle in Heaven''), both directed by [[Carlos Reygadas]]. Other films include: ''[[A Thousand Clouds of Peace Fence the Sky, Love; Your Being Love Will Never End|Mil nubes de paz cercan el cielo, amor, jamás acabarás de ser amor]]'' (''A Thousand Clouds of Peace Fence the Sky, Love; Your Being Love Will Never End'') and ''[[Broken Sky (film)|El cielo dividido]]'' (''Broken Sky''), directed by [[Julián Hernández (filmmaker)|Julián Hernández]], and ''[[Sangre (film)|Sangre]]'', directed by [[Amat Escalante]] and produced by Jaime Romandía and Reygadas.

'''Oslo Kino''' is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] cinema company, based in [[Oslo]].

==History==
Its creation was agreed to by the city authorities of Oslo in 1925, and the company was inaugurated on 1 January 1926 as ''Oslo Kinematografer''.&lt;ref name=oby&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2000|title=Oslo kinematografer|encyclopedia=Oslo byleksikon|edition=4|editor=Tvedt, Knut Are|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|page=328|isbn=82-573-0815-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a part of the Norwegian system of municipally-owned cinemas, superseding private ownership in the field. Only the [[Conservative Party of Norway|Conservative Party]] and the [[Liberal Left Party]] voted against municipalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Film og kino. Den norske modellen|editor=Solum, Ove |editor2=Asbjørnsen, Dag|publisher=Unipub|location=Oslo|date=2008|pages=14|chapter=Den norske kinomodellen|isbn=978-82-7477-355-4|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; These parties subsequently attempted to privatize cinemas in the years after 1926, but failed.&lt;ref&gt;Solum and Asbjørnsen, 2008: p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; An important motivation for municipal ownership was the surplus from the budget, which could be used for other cultural budget posts. [[Oslo Concert Hall]], [[Folketeatret]], [[Gustav Vigeland]]'s atelier (later the [[Vigeland Museum]]) and the [[Munch Museum]] received monetary support from the cinema fund.&lt;ref name=oby/&gt;

In 1997 the company was turned into a [[joint stock company]].&lt;ref name=oby/&gt; Between 2001 and 2003 the city council of Oslo tried to orchestrate a sale of 66% of the company shares, but this did not happen. No bidder came close to the expected prize, and the sale thus fell through.&lt;ref&gt;Solum and Asbjørnsen, 2008: p. 31–33&lt;/ref&gt; The name was changed from Oslo Kinematografer to Oslo Kino in 2007.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oslokino.no/kinofakta/article45800.ece|title=Historikk|publisher=Oslo Kino|language=Norwegian|accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key people==
The early directors were [[Jens Christian Gundersen]] (1926-1933) and [[Kristoffer Aamot]] (1934-1940). During the [[German occupation of Norway]] the company had three Nazi collaborators as directors: [[Gustav Berg-Jæger]] (1940-1942), [[Einar Schibbye]] (1942-1944) and [[Birger Ilseng]] (1944-1945). Kristoffer Aamot then recovered his job, and sat until 1955. [[Theodor Rosenquist]] followed (1955-1958), then [[Arnljot Engh]] (1958-1975), [[Eivind Hjelmtveit]] (1975-1993), [[Ingeborg Moræus Hanssen]] (1993-2005), [[Cecilie Trøan]] (acting, 2005-2006) and [[Geir Bergkastet]] (2006-present).&lt;ref name=official/&gt;

Pre-war chairs of the board of directors were [[Arthur Skjeldrup]] (1926-1928), [[Kristoffer Aamot]] (1929-1931), [[Eyvind Getz]] (1932-1934) and [[Rachel Grepp]] (1935-1940). The chairpersons during the German occupation of Norway are not known. After the war, [[Rolf Hofmo]] sat from 1946 to 1955, then [[Rolf Stranger]] (1956-1967), [[Albert Nordengen]] (1968-1971), [[Adele Lerche]] (1972-1975), [[Turid Dankertsen]] (1976-1979), Albert Nordengen again (1980-1983), [[Bjørn Bjørnseth]] (1984-1987), [[Jon Lyng]] (1988-1991), [[Christian Hambro]] (1992), [[Theo Koritzinsky]] (1993-1995), Jon Lyng again (1996-2003) and [[Heidi Larssen]] (2003-present).&lt;ref name=official/&gt; Several directors and chairs were also politicians for the Conservative Party, the party which initially opposed a municipal cinema company.{{CN|date=September 2018}}

'''Playdead ApS''' is a Danish [[independent video game development|independent video game developer]] based in [[Copenhagen]]. Game designers Arnt Jensen and Dino Patti created the company in 2006 to develop ''[[Limbo (video game)|Limbo]]'', which released in 2010 to critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/117986/Road_To_The_IGF_Limbos_Dino_Patti.php | title = Road To The IGF: Limbo's Dino Patti | last = Alexander | first = Leigh | date = 18 February 2010 | website = [[Gamasutra]] | publisher = [[UBM TechWeb]] | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/02/22/igf-factor-2010-limbo/ | title = IGF Factor 2010: Limbo | last = Gillen | first = Kieron | date = 22 February 2010 | website = [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a year of [[Xbox 360]] exclusivity, Playdead released ports of the game to [[PlayStation 3]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[IOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].

During Xbox's [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2014 conference, Playdead announced their second game, ''[[Inside (video game)|Inside]]'', which was a [[spiritual successor]] to ''Limbo''. It was released for [[Xbox One]], Microsoft Windows, and [[PlayStation 4]] in 2016 to critical acclaim, and was hailed as a worthy successor to ''Limbo''.

== History ==
{{Anchor|Limbo}}
[[File:Dino Patti, Gamelab 2017 (35611079335).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Co-founder Dino Patti in 2017]]
Arnt Jensen, a former [[IO Interactive]] developer, drew sketches in 2004 that led him to conceptualize ''[[Limbo (video game)|Limbo]]''. Having tried programming himself, he eventually sought for additional help through an art-based teaser for the game in 2006. This led to a meeting between Jensen and Dino Patti. Patti soon realized the project was larger than the two of them, and together they founded the company, initially using their private funds and government grants before obtaining larger investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/09/14/how-limbo-came-to-life | title = How Limbo Came To Life | last = Thomsen | first = Michael | date = 14 September 2010 | website = [[IGN]] | publisher = [[IGN Entertainment]] | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playdead eventually came to have eight employees during ''Limbo''{{'s}} development, with temporary increases of up to 16 through freelancers. ''Limbo''{{'s}} success led them to be able to reacquire the company back from investors, making Playdead completely independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/126810/Limbo_Developer_Playdead_Buys_Itself_Back_From_Investors.php | title = ''Limbo'' Developer Playdead Buys Itself Back From Investors | last = Rose | first = Mike | date = 31 August 2011 | website = [[Gamasutra]] | publisher = [[UBM TechWeb]] | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|Inside}}
Within the same year as ''Limbo''{{'s}} release, Playdead began working on ''Project 2'', what would later become ''[[Inside (video game)|Inside]]''. The game was partially financed by the Danish Film Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2010/10/11/limbo-devs-working-on-new-ip/ | title = Limbo devs working on new IP | last = Cullen | first = Johnny | date = 11 October 2010 | website = [[VG247]] | publisher = [[Videogaming247]] | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2010/10/11/limbo-creators-working-on-new-ip/ | title = Limbo creators working on new IP | last = Schramm | first = Mike | date = 11 October 2010 | website = [[Engadget]] | publisher = [[AOL Tech]] | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/9/5793998/inside-playdead-xbox-one-e3-2014 | title = Inside is the next game from Limbo creators Playdead Studios | last = Kollar | first = Philip | date = 9 June 2014 | website = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | publisher = [[Vox Media]] | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered a [[spiritual successor]] to ''Limbo'', ''Inside'' has many of the same themes, including being a [[2.5D]] platform game using a primarily monochrome palette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/5918203/thief-4-is-that-you | title = It's Time to Start Worrying About ''Thief 4'' | author = Superannuation | date = 13 June 2012 | website = [[Kotaku]] | publisher = [[Gawker Media]] | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After using a custom [[game engine]] for ''Limbo'', Playdead used [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] to simplify development and a custom [[temporal anti-aliasing]] filter which was released in March 2016 under an [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[Software license|license]]. The game was officially announced at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014|E3 2014]] with planned release in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/126729/Limbo_Developer_Playdead_Using_Unity_Engine_For_Next_Title.php | title = ''Limbo'' Developer Playdead Using Unity Engine For Next Title | last = Rose | first = Mike | date = 25 August 2011 | website = [[Gamasutra]] | publisher = [[UBM TechWeb]] | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was later pushed to mid-2016 for further refinement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/limbo-developer-s-follow-up-inside-sees-a-delay-293369.phtml | title = Limbo developer's follow-up 'Inside' sees a delay | last = Carter | first = Chris | date = 5 June 2015 | website = [[Destructoid]] | publisher = [[ModernMethod]] | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had a [[Game demo|demo]] at [[PAX (event)|PAX Prime]] in August 2015. Martin Stig Andersen created the soundtrack again after ''Limbo'', creating sound via [[bone conduction]] with a human skull. ''Inside'' was first released in June for Xbox One, and later on Microsoft Windows, and received more overwhelming praise than ''Limbo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/13/e3-2016-limbo-follow-up-inside-gets-a-release-date | title = E3 2016: Limbo Follow-Up Inside Gets a Release Date | last = Sanchez | first = Miranda | date = 13 June 2016 | website = [[IGN]] | publisher = [[IGN Entertainment]] | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the release of ''Inside'', on 19 July 2016, Patti left the company, selling his shares to Jensen. Patti felt that he was leaving Playdead "in a state where it can definitely manage itself", and stated "Following almost 10 incredible years building Playdead from an idea to two dents in the games industry, I'm leaving to seek new challenges."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-07-19-dino-patti-leaving-playdead | title = Dino Patti leaving Playdead | last = Pearson | first = Dan | date = 19 July 2016 | website = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] | publisher = [[Gamer Network]] | accessdate = 19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danish newspaper ''[[Dagbladet Børsen]]'' reported that a rift had developed between Patti and Jensen around 2015,&lt;ref name="borsen"/&gt; that Patti described to ''[[Kotaku]]'' as "the supposed timeline for the next project(s) and where I am in my life now".&lt;ref name="kotaku split"/&gt; The rift led to Jensen submitting a resignation letter to Patti from his position as creative director, though intending to stay on as a company executive. The letter had been misinterpreted by Patti as a full resignation from the company, and he subsequently removed Jensen's name from the [[Central Business Register (Denmark)|Central Business Register]] for Playdead. This led to confrontation between the two and their representative lawyers that required intervention of the Danish Business Authority to resolve.&lt;ref name="gibiz"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-01-19-details-emerge-of-playdead-split | title = Details emerge of Playdead split | first = Dan  |last = Pearson | date = 19 January 2017 | accessdate  = 19 January 2017 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ultimately led to Patti being forced to take a payout of 50 million [[Danish krone]]s (about {{US$|7.2&amp;nbsp;million|link=yes}}) for his shares.&lt;ref name="gibiz"/&gt; Patti was disappointed on the way his involvement with Playdead ended, but said that "Arnt has been a really good friend and business partner for many years".&lt;ref name="borsen"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/160805/artikel.html | title = Gylden spilduo splitter efter magtkamp - stifter får 50 mio for at gå | first = Af Steffen | last = de Vries | date = 16 January 2017 | accessdate = 18 January 2017 | work = [[Dagbladet Børsen]] | language = da}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku split"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/co-founder-of-inside-creators-gets-7-million-after-bus-1791348263 | title = Co-Founder Of Inside Creators Gets $7 Million After Business Breakup | first = Cecilia | last =  D'Anastasio | date = 18 January 2017 | accessdate = 18 January 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gibiz"/&gt; Patti went on to found a new UK-based studio, Jumpship, along with film animator Chris Olsen, by June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/300605/Playdead_cofounder_Dino_Patti_helps_form_new_studio_Jumpship.php | title = Playdead co-founder Dino Patti helps form new studio, Jumpship | first = Chris | last = Kerr | date = 27 June 2017 | accessdate = 27 June 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playdead's third game, which has been teased as early as January 2017, will be a "fairly lonely sci-fi game somewhere in the universe", according to Jensen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/inside/playdead-new-game-sci-fi | title = Inside developer Playdead’s next game will be sci-fi | first = Rachel | last = Watts | date = October 1, 2018 | accessdate = October 1, 2018 | work = [[PCGamesN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/limbo-inside-dev-teases-next-game/1100-6447112/ | title = Limbo, Inside Dev Teases Next Game | first = Oscar | last = Dayus | date = 20 January 2017 | accessdate = 20 January 2017 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This game will likely use a third-person perspective within a 3D world, as Jensen stated that the studio has "been tired of the limitations in 2D games".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/playdead-third-person | title = The Limbo and Inside studio is going 3D, third-person, and sci-fi for its next game | first = Richard | last = Scott-Jones | date = November 2, 2018 | accessdate = November 2, 2018 | work = [[PCGamesN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Quicksilver, Wood Green.jpg|thumb|A Quicksilver branch in Wood Green, London.]]
'''Quicksilver''' is a British amusement arcade and gambling machine company. It is the UK's largest slot gambling machine operator, with over 200 high street outlets and about 10,000 gambling machines.&lt;ref name="RecruitmentRevoltuion"&gt;{{cite web|title=Talarius Case Study|url=https://www.recruitmentrevolution.com/case-studies/talarius|website=RecruitmentRevolution|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quicksilver describes itself as the "largest amusement business in the UK".&lt;ref name=Quicksilver /&gt;

==Operations==
In conjunction with their parent company, Talarius, they operate three high street brands across the UK, Quicksilver, Silvers and Winners, including eight at motorway service areas.&lt;ref name=Quicksilver&gt;{{cite web|title=Quicksilver|url=http://stores.quicksilver.co.uk/|website=Quicksilver|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the profitability of the firm was hit when the British government introduced a new taxation regime for gambling and a [[Smoking in the United Kingdom|smoking ban]] on commercial premises but the company has since recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/entrepreneur-interviews/getting-to-know-you/getting-to-know-you-peter-harvey-ceo-talarius/|title=Getting To Know You: Peter Harvey, CEO, Talarius|date=6 May 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, Quicksilver have run the arcades at all [[Extra (service areas)|Extra motorway service stations]] in the UK, and from 2013, the arcade at the Folkestone service station on the M20.&lt;ref name="MSO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Quicksilver|url=http://motorwayservicesonline.co.uk/Quicksilver|website=Motorway Services Online|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Talarius and Quicksilver left the trade body BACTA after becoming dissatisfied with the direction it was taking but rejoined in 2014 following the appointment of John White as chief executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbcnews.co.uk/retail/2014/07/29/talarius-rejoins-bacta/|title=Talarius rejoins BACTA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, [[Playtech]] reached a deal to provide its software to 92 of Talarius' Quicksilver-branded UK high street "adult gaming centres" (AGCs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igamingbusiness.com/news/playtech-provide-retail-software-talarius|title=Playtech to provide retail software to Talarius|date=4 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, [[Gamestec]] a subsidiary of [[Novomatic]], extended their logistics contract to provide "extensive network and infrastructure capacity" for a third year to over 180 Quicksilver outlets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamestec.co.uk/en/gamestec/news-events/talarius-and-gamestec-agree-extension-on-logistics-contract Talarius and Gamestec agree extension on logistics contract.] Gamestec, 3 March 2014. Retrieved 5 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
Quicksilver is part of Talarius, which was owned by the Australian [[Tatts Group]] from 2008 until it was sold to Austrian company [[Novomatic]] in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intergameonline.com/coin-op/news/16157/novomatic-buys-talarius|title=Novomatic buys Talarius - News - Coin-op - InterGame|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7590">The '''Quinault family''' were French actors, active in the first half of the 18th century.

*'''[[Jean Quinault]]''' was the father of this family. He was born at [[Bourges]] around 1656 or 1658, and died before June 1728.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, pp. 8, 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Said to be the son of a doctor from [[Issoudun]], he joined an acting company based in [[Rouen]] called the ''troupe du [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]]'' in 1679 and again in 1681. In [[Amiens]] in 1686 he married Marie Saintelette, daughter of a baker from [[Verdun]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1694 he and his wife joined the troupe of [[Leopold, Duke of Lorraine]]; the following year he auditioned for the [[Comédie-Française]] and was accepted for a quarter-share position. Instead of remaining in Paris, however, he returned to [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] and headed the duke's troupe from 1695 to 1705.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically of provincial actors at the time, he led an itinerant life; various documents place him in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] in 1697; in [[Metz]] in 1688, 1698 and 1701; in [[Verdun]] in 1693; in [[Strasbourg]] in 1699 and 1702, in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] in 1699; in [[Marseille]] in 1705; and in 1727 in the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Quinault is remembered chiefly for his children, almost all of whom learned their craft in their father's troupe and went on to become successful actors. For part of the early 18th century, they dominated the Paris theater.
*'''[[Jean-Baptiste-Maurice Quinault]]''', baptized 9 September 1687, died 3 September 1745 in [[Autry-le-Châtel]], near [[Gien]]. He made his début at the [[Comédie-Française]] in May 1712 and was accepted into the troupe the next month. He played both tragic and comic roles, but was most praised for the latter. He retired from the stage in 1733, returned briefly in 1734, then retired to Autry where he spent the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, pp. 9, 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Françoise Quinault]]''', born probably in 1688 in Metz, died 22 December 1713 in Paris; also called Mlle Denesle. She made her début at the Comédie-Française in January 1708 and was accepted into the troupe later in the year. She was unhappily married to a would-be actor named Denesle, and in poor health; she died at the age of 25.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, p. 9, 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Quinault-Dufresne|Abraham-Alexis Quinault]]''', born and baptized 9 September 1693 in Verdun, died 12 February 1767 in Paris; called Quinault-Dufresne. He made his début at the Comédie-Française in October 1712 and was accepted the same year. He was handsome and had musical talent. Until his retirement in 1741 he was the principal male star of the troupe in both tragic and comic roles.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, pp. 9, 16-20.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Marie-Jeanne Quinault''', born 21 December 1697 in Boulogne-sur-Mer, died 9 November 1793 in Paris; usually called Marie-Anne-Catherine, Marie-Anne-Christine, or Mlle Quinault ''l'aînée'' (the elder). She made her début at the Comédie-Française in January 1714 and was accepted into the troupe the next month. She was the most beautiful of the Quinault sisters, but not the most talented, and she played primarily young women in light comedies. She retired very quickly, in 1722, and had a long liaison with the [[Counts and Dukes of Nevers|duc de Nevers]]; there is strong evidence to suggest that they had a child together and contracted a [[Morganatic marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, pp. 10, 22-25, 34-36.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Jeanne Quinault]]''', born and baptized 13 October 1699 in Strasbourg, died 18 January 1783 in Paris; usually called Jeanne-Françoise, or Mlle Quinault ''la cadette'' (the younger). She made her début at the Comédie-Française in June 1718 and was accepted in December. She was a very popular actress in comic roles, especially the saucy and resourceful ''[[Soubrette]]'' parts. She was also one of the most intelligent members of the troupe, and is reputed to have advised [[Voltaire]] and [[Pierre-Claude Nivelle de La Chaussée]] on writing some of their hit plays. After her retirement in 1741, she became the hostess of a famous [[Salon (gathering)|salon]], called the ''Bout-du-Banc''. She took responsibility for her eldest brother's orphaned children after his death in 1745. In 1758, she moved from her Paris apartment to the more rural [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], where she lived quietly and corresponded with friends, until failing health led her to return to the city in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, p. 10-11, 187, and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''François Quinault''', birth and death dates and places unknown, but recorded as acting in the [[Théâtre de la foire|theaters of the Paris fairs]] from 1738 to 1742, [[Valenciennes]] in 1746, [[Thionville]] in 1749, Nancy in 1750, and the troupe of the [[Prince of Orange]] in the 1750s&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, p. 12-13; Dainard, ed., ''Correspondance de Mme de Graffigny'', letters 1501, 1502 and 1504.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, in 1727 Abraham-Alexis married one of the female stars:
*'''Catherine-Jeanne Dupré''', born about 1705, died 15 July 1767 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye; she was originally called Mlle de Seine, but after her marriage was also called Mlle Dufresne or Mlle Quinault-Dufresne. She made her début in 1724 at [[Fontainebleau]], where the company was performing before the court, and she was accepted into the troupe a few days later. Her marriage and her career were marked by scandals and conflicts, and she retired in 1736 claiming poor health.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, pp. 19, 20-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

And in November 1727, a cousin made her début:
*'''Marguerite-Marie-Thérèse-Élisabeth Étienne''', born 3 August 1701 in Verdun, died 7 September 1746 in Paris, called Mlle Balicourt or de Balicourt. Her mother and Jean Quinault's wife were sisters. She was accepted into the troupe in January 1728, and played the roles of queens and powerful women, but poor health led her to retire in 1738.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, pp. 37-41, 125-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''SAGA''''' is a play written and directed by Kirjan Waage and Gwendolyn Warnock, performed by [[Wakka Wakka Productions]] in collaboration with [[Nordland Visual Theatre]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/theater/reviews/saga-a-puppet-drama-at-baruch-performing-arts-center.html?_r=0|title=The New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wakka Wakka's website, ''SAGA'' features 30 puppets, ranging from 3 inches to 10 feet, portrayed by an international cast of puppeteers from Iceland, Norway, Ireland, and the US'.&lt;ref name="wakkawakka"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wakkawakka.org/index2.php?v=v1|title=Wakka Wakka Productions, Inc.|publisher=wakkawakka.org|accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
The play uses puppets, the puppeteers wearing masks throughout the play to make them look like Icelandic horses. It makes extensive use of recorded sound, along with sound effects produced by the puppeteers themselves, and quasi-cinematic effects like [[bullet time]]. There is some use of a diorama of the farm where the play is set, on which the movements of cars to the farm are performed. The play is in English spoken with Icelandic accents. It lasts for about an hour.

==Synopsis==
The play opens with the puppeteers performing a slow, sinister dance to bagpipe music evoking medieval music, looming over the character who turns out to be the protagonist of the play, Gunnar Oddmundsson. The play then cuts to a scene of Gunnar and his son Óli digging a hole for an outdoor jacuzzi. The scene is rural Iceland and Gunnar and Óli wear [[lopapeysa|lopapeysur]]. Gunnar's wife Helga emerges and it becomes clear (partly through this scene and partly later in the play) that Ólafur is preparing the jacuzzi as part of a scheme to open the 'Viking Bed and Breakfast', tourist accommodation at which Helga is to run a restaurant and Gunnar to run horse and jeep tours. Their conversation is interrupted by the sudden appearance of [[Geir Haarde]] making his 'God bless Iceland' speech of October 6, 2008, breaking the news of the unfolding [[2008–11 Icelandic financial crisis]]. Gunnar soon finds himself beset with bills he can no longer pay (literally: they flock around his head, held by the puppeteers). A flashforward shows Gunnar looking in on himself unconscious in a jeep that has crashed into the unfinished jacuzzi and telling himself to wake up. Meanwhile, flashbacks recount his earlier conversations with his friend at the bank, who glibly encouraged him to sell his fishing boat and fish-quota, invest the proceeds rather than pay off his mortgage, and to take out loans to buy his way into an idyllic pastoral life, purchasing land, a new house, a jeep, horses, and funding Gunnar's putative tourism business. The series of loans in these flashbacks are portrayed as being taken out with a growing tone of frivolity and derangement on the part of both Gunnar and the banker, with Gunnar coming to sign his name as 'Michael Jackson' and 'Elvis Presley' on loan documents, followed by a dance routine. Gunnar is also portrayed in a flashback horse-racing with his son.

Back in the present time of the play, the financial strains in turn strain Gunnar's relationship with Helga: they are shown arguing over whose fault their deteriorating financial situation is. Gunnar meets his lawyer friend Jón and they agree to sue the bank in a narrative that runs through much of the play, implying that Jón becomes Gunnar's best or even only friend, but never with success. Gunnar participates in the [[2009 Icelandic financial crisis protests|Kitchenware Revolution]], facing the police's use of tear gas of January 22, 2009 and his jubilation at the resignation of the government on January 26 is represented by the puppeteers performing an energetic dance with Icelandic flags to the soundtrack of [[Emilíana Torrini|Emilíana Torrini's]] 2009 hit [[Jungle Drum]].

The revolution does not, however, help Gunnar's financial situation; while shearing sheep with Óli, he is visited by the local sheriff who serves an eviction notice: Gunnar's house is to be repossessed and put up for auction. Helga moves to Norway to take a job in a restaurant there, taking Óli with her. The backstory of her relationship with Gunnar is explored as a flashback to their first meeting, drunk, outside a bar, involving a graphic representation of drunken outdoor sex, during which Helga implicitly gets pregnant with Óli, on the occasion of whose birth Gunnar proposes marriage to Helga, which she accepts. After two months in Norway, Helga calls Gunnar asking for a divorce. Gunnar sells his horses at a knock-down price to be able to buy a plane ticket to Norway to try to save the marriage but is thwarted by the [[2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull]] and their consequent [[Air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption|disruption of air traffic]]. Gunnar's rage provokes the appearance of a representation of his inner Viking, depicted as a huge, bald, black-haired, axe-wielding figure reminiscent of [[Egill Skallagrímsson]], and a fantasy of raising a ''[[Nithing pole|Níðstöng]]'' against his oppressors followed by a homicidal, spade-wielding rampage against them. Gunnar does not, however, follow through on this, instead chasing the Viking away. However, he does not vacate his house ahead of the auction as he is supposed to, and chases away a prospective buyer. A few days later, the day before the auction, the auctioneer brings a policeman to the house to ask Gunnar to leave; Gunnar promises to and the policeman pretends that Gunnar already has. Inspired by his inner Viking, however, Gunnar instead pours petrol around the inside of the house and sets fire to it before driving the jeep into the unfinished jacuzzi. His is knocked unconscious by the crash, but wakes up, climbs out, and calls Jón asking for help. Jón is not shown to appear, however, and the play closes with Gunnar lying beside the crashed car surrounded by the sinister figures of the puppeteers.

'''''Scarface''''' (also known as '''''Scarface: The Shame of the Nation''''' and '''''The Shame of a Nation''''') is a 1932 American [[gangster film]] directed by [[Howard Hawks]] and produced by Hawks and [[Howard Hughes]]. The screenplay, by [[Ben Hecht]], is based on [[Armitage Trail]]'s 1929 novel ''[[Scarface (novel)|Scarface]]'', which portrays the life of [[Al Capone]]. The film stars [[Paul Muni]] as gangster Antonio "Tony" Camonte, and follows his violent rise through the Chicago gangland world. [[Ann Dvorak]], and [[Karen Morley]], [[Osgood Perkins]], [[George Raft]], and [[Boris Karloff]] co-star. One scene depicts a version of the [[Saint Valentine's Day Massacre]]. 

''Scarface'' was [[Pre-Code Hollywood|produced before the introduction]] of the [[Production Code Administration]] in 1934, which enforced regulations on film content. However, the Hays Code, a more lenient precursor, called for major alterations, including a prologue condemning gangsters, an alternate ending to more clearly reprehend Camonte, and the alternative title ''The Shame of a Nation''. The censors believed the film glorified violence and crime. These changes delayed the film by a year, though some showings retained the original ending. Modern showings of the film of television and video represent the version with the original ending, though some DVD releases also include the alternate ending as a feature; these versions still maintain the changes Hughes and Hawks were required to make for the film to be approved by the Hays Office. A completely unaltered and uncensored version of the film is not known to exist.

Audience reception was positive, but censors banned the film in several cities and states, forcing Hughes to remove it from circulation and store it in his vault. The rights to the film were recovered after Hughes's death in the 1970s. Alongside ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' and ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' (both 1931), ''Scarface'' is regarded as among the most significant gangster films, and greatly influenced the genre.

''Scarface'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] in 1994 by the [[Library of Congress]]. In 2008, the [[American Film Institute]] listed ''Scarface'' as the sixth best gangster film. It was the basis for the [[Scarface (1983 film)|1983 film of the same name]] starring [[Al Pacino]].

==Plot==
[[File:Scarface 1932.JPG|thumb|alt=Johnny and Tony sitting next to each other at a table both with matches in their hands|left|Osgood Perkins as John "Johnny" Lovo and Paul Muni as Antonio "Tony" Camonte in a scene from the film's trailer.]]
In [[Roaring Twenties|1920s]] [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], Italian immigrant Antonio "Tony" Camonte acts on the orders of Italian mafioso John "Johnny" Lovo and kills "Big" Louis Costillo, the leading crime boss of the city's [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]]. Johnny takes control of the South Side with Tony as his key lieutenant, selling large amounts of illegal beer to [[Speakeasy|speakeasies]] and muscling in on bars run by rival outfits. However, Johnny repeatedly warns Tony not to mess with the [[Irish mob|Irish gangs]] led by O'Hara, who runs the [[North Side, Chicago|North Side]]. Tony soon ignores these orders, barraging bars belonging to O'Hara, and attracting attention of the police and rival gangsters. Johnny realizes Tony is out of control and aspires to take his position.

Meanwhile, Tony pursues Johnny's girlfriend Poppy with increasing confidence. At first, she is dismissive of him but pays him more attention as his reputation rises. She visits his "gaudy" apartment where he shows her his view of an electric billboard advertising [[Thomas Cook &amp; Son|Cook's Tours]], which features the slogan which inspires him: "The World is Yours."

Tony eventually decides to declare war and take over the North Side. He sends the [[coin flipping]] Guino Rinaldo, one of his best men and close friend, to kill O'Hara in a [[florist]]'s shop that he uses as his base. This brings heavy retaliation from the North Side gangs, now led by Gaffney and armed with [[Thompson submachine gun]]s—which instantly capture Tony's dark imagination. Tony leads his own forces to destroy the North Side gangs and take over their market, even to the point of [[Saint Valentine's Day Massacre|impersonating police officers to murder several rivals in a garage]]. Tony kills Gaffney as he makes a strike at a bowling alley. The South side gang and Poppy go to a club and Tony and Poppy dance together in front of Johnny. After Tony conspicuously shows his intention to steal Poppy, Johnny believes his protégé is trying to take over, and he arranges for Tony to be assassinated while driving. Tony manages to escape this attack, and he and Guino kill Johnny, leaving Tony as the undisputed boss of the city. In order to elude the increasingly aggravated police force, Tony and Poppy leave Chicago for a month.

[[File:Scarface-Muni-Dvorak.jpg|alt=Tony and Cesca hugging each other|thumb|Paul Muni and Ann Dvorak in ''Scarface'']]
[[File:Muni Scarface 2.JPG|thumb|alt=Tony headshot in a gangster style fedora|300px|Paul Muni in the trailer for ''Scarface''.]]Tony's actions have provoked a public outcry, and the police are slowly closing in. After he sees his beloved sister Francesca ("Cesca") with Guino, he kills his friend in a jealous rage before the couple can inform him of their secret marriage. His sister runs out distraught, presumably to notify the police. The police move to arrest Tony for Guino's murder, and Tony takes cover in his house and prepares to fire at the police. Cesca comes back, planning to kill him, but decides to help him to fight the police. Tony and Cesca arm themselves and Tony shoots at the police from the window, laughing maniacally. Moments later, however, Cesca is killed by a stray bullet. Calling Cesca's name as the apartment fills with tear gas, Tony leaves on the stairs, and the police confront him. Tony pleads for his life, but makes a break for it, only to be shot by an unknown officer with a Tommy gun. He stumbles for a moment and falls in the gutter and dies. Among the sounds of cheering, the electric billboard blazes "The World is Yours".

==Production==
===Development===
Business tycoon [[Howard Hughes]], who dabbled in [[filmmaking]], wanted a box office hit after the success of his 1931 film ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]''. [[Gangster film|Gangster films]] were popular in the early 1930s in the age of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], and Hughes wanted to make a film based on the life of gangster [[Al Capone]] superior to all other films in the genre. He was advised against making the film, as the genre was crowded; ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' and ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' were already popular films, and [[Warner Bros.]] claimed nothing new could be done with the gangster genre. Furthermore, industry censors such as the [[Hays Office]] were becoming concerned with the glamorization of crime in media.&lt;ref name="amc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/scar.html|title=Scarface: The Shame of the Nation|last1=Dirks|first1=Tom|website=Filmsite Movie Review|publisher=American Movie Classics Company|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes bought the rights to [[Armitage Trail|Armitage Trail's]] novel ''[[Scarface (novel)|Scarface]]'', inspired by the life of Capone.&lt;ref name="amc" /&gt; Trail wrote for a number of detective story magazines during the early 20s, but died of a heart attack at the age of 28, shortly before the release of ''Scarface''.{{sfn|Server|2002|pp=258–259}} Hughes hired Fred Pasley, a New York reporter and authority on Capone, as a writer. Hughes asked [[Ben Hecht]], who in 1929 had won the first [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] for his silent crime film [[Underworld (1927 film)|''Underworld'']], to be head writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clarens|1980|p=84}}; {{harvnb|Thomas|1985|p=70}}; {{cite news |last1=Kogan |first1=Rick |title=Remembering Ben Hecht, the first Oscar winner for original screenplay |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-ben-hecht-at-the-first-oscars-ae-0228-20160225-column.html |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |agency=Chicago Tribune |date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suspicious of Hughes as an employer, Hecht requested a daily salary of one thousand dollars, to be paid every day at six o'clock. Hecht claimed he would only waste a day's labor if Hughes turned out to be a fraud.{{sfn|Hecht|1954|pp=486–487}} 

Hughes wanted prominent film director [[Howard Hawks]] to direct and co-produce.&lt;ref name="Scarface 1932"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/89192/Scarface/full-credits.html|title=Scareface (1932)|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|accessdate=January 11, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118033340/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/89192/Scarface/full-credits.html|archivedate=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This surprised Hawks, as the two had never been friendly; Hughes had filed a lawsuit against Howard Hawks in July 1930, alleging that Hawks's film ''[[The Dawn Patrol (1930 film)|The Dawn Patrol]]'' had plagiarized his film ''[[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]''.{{sfn|Barlett|Steele|1979|p=73}} Over a game of golf, Hughes promised to drop the lawsuit, and by the eighteenth hole, Hawks had become interested in directing the film. He became more convinced when he discovered Hecht would be the head writer.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|pp=71–72}} Hecht and Hawks worked together well, intending to portray the Capone character as of the [[House of Borgia|Borgia Family]], including the suggestion of incest between the main character and his sister, present in Trail's novel.{{sfn|Clarens|1980|p=85}}

=== Writing ===
Hecht wrote the screenplay in eleven days in January 1931, adapted from Trail's novel. Additional writing was provided by Fred Pasley and [[W. R. Burnett]], author of the novel ''Little Caesar,'' which the film ''Little Caesar'' was based on. Pasley wrote the screenplay including elements of book ''Al Capone: Biography of a Self-Made Man;'' the book contains a barbershop scene with Capone similar to the introduction of Tony Camonte in the film. Pasley was not credited for his work on the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smyth|2004|p=552}}; {{harvnb|Thomas|1985|p=71}}; {{harvnb|Clarens|1980|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lee Mahin]] and [[Seton I. Miller]] rewrote the script for continuity and dialogue.

Because there were five writers, it is difficult to distinguish which components were contributed by which writer; however, the ending of ''Scarface'' is similar to Hecht's first gangster film ''Underworld,'' in which gangster Bull Weed traps himself in his apartment with his lover and fires at the hordes of police outside, and thus was likely a Hecht contribution.{{sfn|McCarty|1993|pp=43, 67}}

The ''Scarface'' film bears little resemblance to the novel.&lt;ref name="amc" /&gt; Though the film contains the same major characters, plot points and incestual undertones, changes were made to reduce the length and the number of characters, and to satisfy the requests of censorship offices. To make gangsters appear less admirable, Tony's character was made to appear less intelligent and more brutish than in the novel. Similarly, the sibling relationship between Tony and the police officer was removed to avoid depicting police corruption.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=77}}

====Ties to Capone====
Both the film and novel are loosely based upon the life of gangster [[Al Capone]], whose nickname was "Scarface".{{sfn|Smyth|2006|pp=75–77}} The names of characters and locations were changed only minimally. Capone became Camonte and Moran became Doran. In some early scripts, Colosimo was Colisimo and O'Bannion was Bannon, but the names were changed to Costillo and O'Hara respectively. This, including other alterations made to characters and other identifying locations to maintain anonymity, were due to censorship and Hawks's concern about the overuse of historical details.{{sfn|Smyth|2006|pp=78, 380}}

Ben Hecht had met Capone and "knew a lot about Chicago", so he did no research for the script.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=132}} According to Hecht, while he worked on the script, Capone sent two men to visit him in Hollywood to make sure the film was not based on Capone's life.{{sfn|Hecht|1954|pp=486–487}} He told them the Scarface character was a parody of numerous people, and that the title was chosen as it was intriguing. The two left Hecht alone.{{sfn|Hecht|1954|pp=486–487}} 

The references to Capone and actual events from the Chicago gang wars were obvious to audiences at the time. Muni's character had a scar similar to Capone, received in similar fights.{{sfn|Bergreen|1994|p=49}} The police in the film mention Camonte is a member of the [[Five Points Gang]] in Brooklyn, of which Capone was a known member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Andrews |first1=Evan |title=7 Infamous Gangs of New York |url=https://www.history.com/news/7-infamous-gangs-of-new-york |website=History.com |publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks |accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|1999|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tony kills his boss "Big Louis" Costillo in the lobby of his club; Capone was involved in the murder of his first boss [[Big Jim Colosimo|"Big Jim" Colosimo]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Langman|Finn|1995|pp=227–228}}; {{cite web|title=How Did Big Jim Colosimo Get Killed?|url=http://www.nationalcrimesyndicate.com/jim-colosimo-death/|website=National Crime Syndicate|publisher=National Crime Syndicate|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rival boss O'Hara is murdered in his flower shop; Capone's men murdered [[Dean O'Bannion]] in his flower shop in 1924.{{sfn|Clarens|1980|p=86}} The assassination of seven men in a garage, with two of the gunmen costumed as police officers, mirrors the [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre|St. Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929]]. The leader of this rival gang narrowly escapes the shooting, as did gang leader [[Bugs Moran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Langman|Finn|1995|pp=227–228}}; {{cite news|last1=O'Brien|first1=John|title=The St. Valentine's Day Massacre|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-valentinesmassacre-story-story.html|accessdate=May 24, 2018|agency=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}; {{cite web|title=St. Valentine's Day Massacre|url=https://www.history.com/topics/saint-valentines-day-massacre|website=History|publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film opens at the intersection of 22nd Street and Wabash Avenue in the middle of Capone's South Side, the site of many Capone's crimes.{{sfn|Smyth|2004|p=554}}

Despite the clear references to Capone, Capone was rumored to have liked the film so much he owned a print of it.{{sfn|MacAdams|1990|p=128}} However, this was likely an exaggerated claim by Hawks as Capone was imprisoned in Atlanta for tax evasion during the film's release.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCarthy|1997|p=132}}; {{harvnb|Clarens|1980|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
Hawks and Hughes had difficulty casting popular actors, as most were under contract and studios were reluctant to let their actors freelance to independent producers.{{sfn|Yablonsky|1974|p=64}} Producer [[Irving Thalberg]] suggested [[Clark Gable]], but Hawks believed Gable was a personality, not an actor.{{sfn|Guerif|1979|pp=48–52}} After seeing [[Paul Muni]] on Broadway, talent agent Al Rosen suggested him for the lead role. Muni initially declined, feeling he was not physically suited for the role, but after reading the script, his wife Bella convinced him to take it.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=72}} After a test run in New York, Hughes, Hawks, and Hecht approved Muni for the role.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=74}} 

[[Boris Karloff]] was cast as British gangster Gaffney.{{sfn|Bojarski|Beale|1974|pp=68-69}} [[Jack La Rue]] was cast as Tony Camonte's sidekick Guino Rinaldo (modeled after Capone's bodyguard [[Frank Rio]]) but as he was taller than Muni, Hawks worried he would overshadow Muni's tough Scarface persona.{{sfn|Guerif|1979|pp=48–52}} He was replaced with George Raft, a struggling actor at the time, after Hawks encountered him at a prizefight.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yablonsky|1974|p=64}}; {{harvnb|Rice|2013|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Karen Morley was under contract at MGM, Hawks was close with MGM studio executive [[Eddie Mannix]], who loaned out Morley for the film. She was reportedly given the choice between the role of Poppy or Cesca. Though Cesca was the stronger role, she chose Poppy as she felt Cesca would be a better fit for her friend Ann Dvorak. She considered this "probably the nicest thing [she] did in [her] life".{{sfn|Rice|2013|pp=52–53}} Morley invited twenty-year old Dvorak to a party at Hawks' house to introduce them. According to Hawks, at the party, Dvorak zeroed in on George Raft who would be playing her love interest. He initially declined her invitation to dance. She tried to dance in front of him in order to lure him; eventually he gave in, and their dance together stopped the party.{{sfn|Rice|2013|pp=3, 53}} After this event, Hawks was interested in casting her, but had reservations about her lack of experience. After a screen test, he gave her the part, and MGM was willing to release her from her contract as a chorus girl.{{sfn|Rice|2013|p=53}} Dvorak had to both receive permission from her mother [[Anna Lehr]] and to win a petition presented to the [[California superior courts|Superior Court]] to be able to sign on with Howard Hawks as a minor.{{sfn|Rice|2013|p=55}}

===Filming===
Filming lasted six months, which was long for films made in the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keating|2016|p=107}}; {{harvnb|Bookbinder|1985|pp=21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard Hughes remained off-set to avoid interfering with the filming of the movie. Hughes urged Hawks to make the film as visually exciting as possible by adding car chases, crashes, and machine gun fire.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=75}} Hawks shot the film at three different locations: [[Samuel Goldwyn Studio|Metropolitan Studios]], [[Harold Lloyd]] Studios and the [[Mayan Theater]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Shooting took three months with the cast and crew working seven days a week. For the most violent scene of the film in the restaurant, Hawks cleared the set to avoid harming extras and had the set fired on by machine guns. The actors acted out the scene in front of a screen with the shooting projected in the back, so as everyone crowded under the tables in the restaurant, the room appeared to be simultaneously under fire.{{sfn|Clarens|1980|p=87}}

During filming, Hawks and Hughes met with the Hays Office to discuss revisions. Despite that, ''Scarface'' was filmed and put together quickly. In September 1931, a rough cut of the film was screened for the California Crime Commission and police officials, neither of whom thought the movie was a dangerous influence for audiences or would illicit a criminal response. [[Irving Thalberg]] was given an advanced screening and was impressed by the film. Despite the positive feedback the film was given, the Hays Office was insistent on changes before final approval.{{sfn|Rice|2013|pp=58–59}}

===Censorship===
''Scarface'' was produced and filmed during [[Pre-Code Hollywood|Pre-Code era of Hollywood]], which spanned from 1930 to 1934. The Pre-Code era is characterized by its informal and haphazard screening and regulation of film content, prior to the establishment of the [[Production Code Administration]] (PCA) in July 1934. Before the influence of the PCA, censorship was overseen by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors of America]] (MPPDA). In 1930, [[Will H. Hays|Will Hays]], the chairman of the MPPDA, attempted to regulate the content of movies; the MPPDA became known as the Hays Office.{{sfn|Doherty|1999|pp=1-2}} The goal of the Hays Office was to censor nudity, sexuality, drug use and crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Howard Hawks' Scarface and the Hollywood Production Code |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/theater/hollywood.html |website=Theater, Film, and Video |publisher=PBS |accessdate=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specific to ''Scarface'', the Hays Office wanted to avoid the sympathetic portrayal of crime by either showing criminals recognizing the error of their ways or showing criminals get punished.{{sfn|Smith|2004|p=48}} The Hays Office, however, did not have authority to remove material from a film until the MPPDA officially pledged to adhere to the Production Code in 1934, so they relied on delaying film release and lobbying to remove scenes or prevent movies from being produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|1999|pp=1-2, 101}}; {{harvnb|Black|1994|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films evaded the Hays Office by adding extremely suggestive scenes so they could remove them and satisfy the Hays Office enough that they wouldn't notice the lesser immoralities that remained in the film.{{sfn|Vieria|2003|p=130}}  

J.E. Smyth called ''Scarface'', "one of the most highly censored films in Hollywood history."{{sfn|Yogerst|2017|pp=134–144}} Howard Hawks believed the Hays Office had personal vendettas against the movie, while Hughes believed the censorship was due to "ulterior and political motives" of corrupt politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yogerst|2017|pp=134–144}}; {{harvnb|Doherty|1999|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, James Wingate of the New York censor boards rebutted that Hughes was preoccupied with "box office publicity" in producing the film.{{sfn|Doherty|1999|p=150}} After repeated demands for a script rewrite from the Hays Office, Hughes ordered Hawks to shoot the film, "Screw the Hays Office, make it as realistic, and grisly as possible."{{sfn|Black|1994|p=126}} The Hays Office was outraged by ''Scarface'' when they screened it. The Hays office called for scenes to be deleted, scenes to be added to condemn gangsterism, and a different ending. They believed Tony's death at the end of the film was too glorifying. In addition to the violence, the MPPDA felt an inappropriate relationship between the main character and his sister was too overt, especially when he holds her in his arms after he slaps her and tears her dress; they ordered this scene be deleted. Hughes, in order to receive the MPPDA's approval, deleted the more violent scenes, added a prologue to condemn gangsterism, and wrote a new ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1985|p=75}}; {{harvnb|Clarens|1980|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, a couple scenes were added to overtly condemn gangsterism, such as a scene in which a newspaper publisher looks at the screen and directly admonishes the government and the public for their lack of action in fighting against mob violence and a scene in which the chief detective denounces the glorification of gangsters.{{sfn|McCarty|1993|p=68}} Hawks refused to shoot the extra scenes and the alternate ending. They were directed by Richard Rossen, earning Rossen the title of "co-director".{{sfn|Smith|2004|pp=43–44}} Hughes was instructed to change the title to ''The Menace'', ''Shame of the Nation'' or ''Yellow'' to clarify the subject of the film; after month of haggling, he compromised with the title ''Scarface, Shame of the Nation'' and by adding a foreword condemning the "gangster" in a general sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smyth|2006|p=80}}; {{harvnb|Clarens|1980|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes made an attempt to release the film under the title "The Scar" when the original title was disallowed by the Hays office.{{sfn|Hagemann|1984|pp=30–40}} Besides the title, the term "Scarface" was removed from the film. In the scene where Tony kills Rinaldo, Cesca says the word "murderer", but she can be seen mouthing the word "Scarface".{{sfn|Rice|2013|p=59}}

The original script had Tony's mother loving her son unconditionally, praising his lifestyle, and even accepting money and gifts from him. In addition, there was a politician who, despite campaigning against gangsters on the podium, is shown partying with them after hours. The script ending had Tony staying in the building, unaffected by tear gas and a multitude of bullets fired at him. After the building is on fire, Tony is forced to exit, guns blazing. He is sprayed with police gun fire but appears unfazed. Upon noticing the police officer who had been arresting him throughout the film, he fires at him, only to hear a single "click" noise implying his gun is empty. He is killed after the police officer shoots him several times. A repeated clicking noise is heard on the soundtrack implying he was attempting to fire while he was dying.{{sfn|Black|1994|p=126}}

===Alternate ending===
The first version of the film (Version A) was completed on September 8, 1931, but censors required the ending be modified or they would refuse to grant ''Scarface'' a license. Paul Muni was unable to re-film the ending in 1931 due his work on Broadway. To combat this Hawks used a [[body double]]. The body double was mainly filmed by way of shadows and [[long shot]]s in order to mask Muni's absence in these scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1985|pp=75}}; {{harvnb|Smyth|2006|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternate ending (Version B) differs from the original ending in the manner that Tony is caught and in which he dies. Unlike the original ending where Tony escapes the police and dies after getting shot several times. In the alternate ending, Tony reluctantly handing himself over to the police. After the encounter, Tony's face is not shown. A scene follows where a judge is addressing Tony during sentencing. The next scene is the finale, in which Tony (seen from a bird's eye view) is brought to the gallows and hung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/scar3.html|title=Scarface: The Shame of the Nation (1932)|website=www.filmsite.org|language=en|access-date=June 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231204734/http://www.filmsite.org/scar3.html|archive-date=December 31, 2017|dead-url=no}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2004|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Version B did not pass the New York censors and Chicago censors. Howard Hughes felt the Hays office had suspicious intentions in rejecting the film, because Hays was friends with [[Louis B. Mayer]] and Hughes believed censorship was to prevent wealthy independent competitors from producing films. Confident his film could stand out among audiences more than Mayer's films, Hughes organized a press showing of the film in Hollywood and New York.{{sfn|Smyth|2004|p=557}}  ''The New York Herald-Tribune'' praised Hughes for his courage to stand against censors. Hughes disowned the censored film and finally in 1932 released Version A—with the added text introduction in states that lacked strict censors (Hughes attempted to take the New York censors to court). This 1932 release version led to bona-fide box office status and positive critical reviews. Hughes was successful in subsequent lawsuits against the boards that censored the film.&lt;ref name="Thomas 1985 76"&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1985|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,743580,00.html |title=Cinema: The New Pictures: Apr. 18, 1932 |work=[[TIME]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018185358/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,743580,00.html |archivedate=October 18, 2011  |date=1932-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to criticism from the press, Hays claimed the version shown in theaters was the censored film he had previously approved.{{sfn|Smyth|2004|p=557}}

===Music===
Due to the film's urban setting, [[Diegesis|nondiegetic]] music (not visible on the screen or implied to be present in the story) was not used in the film.{{sfn|Slowik|2014|p=229}} The only music that appears in the film is during the opening and closing credits and during scenes in the movie where music would appear naturally in the film's action such as in the nightclub. Adolf Tandler served as the film's musical director, while [[Gus Arnheim]] served as the orchestra's conductor. Gus Arnheim and his Cocoanut Grove Orchestra perform "[[Saint Louis blues]]" by [[W. C. Handy]] and "[[Some of These Days]]" by [[Shelton Brooks]] in the nightclub.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/jots.200019069/|title=SCARFACE (1932)|work=The Library of Congress|access-date=August 3, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tune Tony whistles in the film is the [[sextet]] from [[Gaetano Donizetti]]'s popular opera ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]].''&lt;ref name="amc" /&gt; This tune is accompanied by words that translate to, "What restrains me in such a moment?", and this tune continues to appear during violent scenes in the movie.{{sfn|Clarens|1980|p=93}} The song Cesca sings while playing the piano is "[[Wreck of the Old 97#Ballad|Wreck of the Old 97]]".{{sfn|Hagen|Wagner|2004|p=52}}

===Cultural references===
The serious play Tony and his friends go to see, leaving at the end of Act 2, is John Colton and Clemence Randolph's ''Rain'', based on [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s story "Miss Sadie Thompson". The play opened on Broadway in 1922 and ran throughout the 1920s. (A film version of the play, also titled ''[[Rain (1932 film)|Rain]]'' and starring [[Joan Crawford]], was released by United Artists the same year as ''Scarface.'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rain|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/161058%7C161060/Rain.html|website=Film Article|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though fairly inconspicuous in the film, and unnoticed by most viewers, the Capone family was meant to be partially modeled after the Italo-Spanish Borgia family. This was most prominent thought the subtle and arguably incestuous relationship Tony Camonte and his sister share.{{sfn|Clarens|1980|p=85}} Camonte's excessive jealousy of his sister's affairs with other men hint at this relationship.{{sfn|Langman|Finn|1995|pp=227–228}} Coincidentally, Donizetti wrote the opera for ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (opera)|Lucrezia Borgia]]'', about the Borgia family, and ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' from where Tony Camonte's whistle tune comes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ashbrook|1965|pp=500–501}}; {{harvnb|Grønstad|2003|pp=399–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
After battling with censorship offices, the film was released almost a year late, behind ''The Public Enemy'' and ''Little Caesar'' which had been filmed at the same time. ''Scarface'' was released in theaters on April 9, 1932.{{sfn|Yogerst|2017|pp=134–144}} Hughes planned a grand premiere in New York, but New York censor boards rejected the showing of the film. State censorship boards in Ohio, Virginia, Maryland, and Kansas and citywide censorship boards in Detroit, Seattle, Portland, and Chicago banned the film as well.{{sfn|Black|1994|p=130}} Hughes threatened to sue censorship boards for preventing the release of his film much to the approval of ''The New York Herald Tribune''.{{sfn|Black|1994|pp=130-131}} Each state had a different board of censors which allowed Hughes to release the film in areas without strict censorship.{{sfn|Springhall|2004|p=139}} At the request of Will Hays, Jason Joy convinced the strict censor boards to allow the release of ''Scarface'', because the Hays Office acknowledged and appreciated the changes Hughes made to ''Scarface''. Joy visited state censor boards individually, stating that that while the Hays Office was against the positive portrayal of crime, gang films were actually documents against gangster life. Joy was successful and eventually all state and municipal censorship boards allowed ''Scarface'' to be released, accepting only the cut and censored version of ''Scarface''.{{sfn|Black|1994|p=131}}

The film was released on [[DVD]] on May 22, 2007, and was released again on August 28, 2012, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]], by [[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment]].

At the time of release, audience reception was generally positive.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=75}} According to George Raft, who met Al Capone a few times at casinos, even Capone himself liked the film adding, "you tell 'em that if any of my boys are tossin' coins, they'll be twenty-dollar gold pieces."{{sfn|Yablonsky|1974|p=76}} ''Variety'' cited ''Scarface'' as having, "that powerful and gripping suspense which is in all gangster pictures is in this one in double doses and makes it compelling entertainment," and that the actors play, "as if they'd been doing nothing else all their lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scarface |url=https://archive.org/stream/variety106-1932-05#page/n203/mode/2up |accessdate=June 14, 2018 |agency=Variety |date=May 24, 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Board of Review]] named ''Scarface'' as one of the best pictures of 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The National Board of Review |url=https://archive.org/stream/hollywoodreporte1215wilk#page/n113/mode/2up/search/scarface |accessdate=June 14, 2018 |agency=The Hollywood Reporter |date=January 21, 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the time of release in 1932, there was a general public outcry about the film and the gangster genre in general which negatively affected box office earnings of the film.{{sfn|Balio|2009|p=111}} Jack Alicoate gave ''Scarface'' a scathing review in ''[[The Film Daily]]'' that the violence and subject matter of the film left him with, "the distinct feeling of nausea". He goes on to say the film, "should never have been made" and showing the film would, "do more harm to the motion picture industry, and every one connected with it, than any picture ever shown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alicoate |first1=Jack |title="Scarface"...a mistake |url=https://archive.org/stream/filmdailyvolume55859newy#page/888/search/jack+alicoate |accessdate=August 22, 2018 |work=The Film Daily |date=April 14, 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ben Hecht was often critical of his work for Hollywood, he admitted that ''Scarface'' was "the best-directed picture [he has] seen". Hecht did; however, criticize Muni's performance. Having known Al Capone, Hecht claimed that Muni portrayed Capone as too "silent" and "moody", more similar to "Hitler".{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=154}} Some critics disagreed with the casting of British actor Boris Karloff, believing his accent was out of place in a gangster film; a ''New York Times'' article stated, "..his British accent is hardly suitable to the role".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bookbinder|1985|pp=23-24}}; {{harvnb|Bojarski|Beale|1974|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other critics considered him a high point.{{sfn|Bookbinder|1985|pp=23–24}} The film earned $600,000 at the box office and while ''Scarface'' was more of a financial success than Hughes's other films at the time, due to the large cost of production, it is unlikely the film did better than break even.{{sfn|Balio|2009|p=111}}

The film initiated outrage among Italian organizations and individuals of Italian descent, remarking a tendency of filmmakers to portray gangsters and bootleggers in their films as Italian. In the film, an Italian American makes a speech condemning gangster activities; this was added later in production to appease censors. This, however, didn't prevent the Italian embassy from disapproving ''Scarface''.{{sfn|Vasey|1996|p=218}} Believing the film to be offensive to the Italian community, the [[Order Sons of Italy in America]] formally denounced the film and other groups urged community members to boycott the film and other films derogatory towards Italians or Italian-Americans.{{sfn|Keating|2016|p=109}} Will Hays wrote to the ambassador in Italy, excusing himself from scrutiny by stating the film was an [[anachronism]], because it had been delayed in production for two years and didn't represent the current practice of censorship at the time.{{sfn|Vasey|1996|p=218}} [[Nazi Germany]] permanently prohibited showings of the film.{{sfn|Clarens|1980|p=91}} Some cities in England banned the film as well, believing the [[British Board of Film Classification]]'s policy on gangster films was too lax.{{sfn|Springhall|2004|p=139}} Several cities in the United States including Chicago and some states refused to show the film. The magazine ''Movie Classics'' ran an issue urging the people to demand to see the film at theaters despite the censorship bans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Donaldson |first1=Robert |title=Shall the Movies Take Orders from the Underworld |url=https://archive.org/stream/movieclassic02moti#page/n123/mode/2up |accessdate=June 14, 2018 |agency=Movie Classics |issue=April}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film broke box office records at the [[Woods Theatre]] in Chicago after premiering Thanksgiving Day, November 20, 1941 after having been banned from showing in Chicago by censors for nine years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Scarface" Breaks Record on "Premiere" |url=https://archive.org/stream/showmenstraderev35lewi#page/n349/mode/2up/search/scarface+ |accessdate=June 14, 2018 |agency=Showmen's Trade Review |publisher=Charles E. Lewis |date=November 29, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the favorable reception of the film among the public, the censorship battles and the unflattering reviews from some press contributed to the film's generally poor performance at the box office. Upset at the inability to make money from ''Scarface'', Howard Hughes removed the film from circulation.{{sfn|McCarty|1993|p=68}} The film remained unavailable until 1979 except for occasional [[release prints]] of suspect quality from questionable sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brookes|2016|p=27}};{{harvnb|Smith|2004|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes had plans in 1933 to direct and produce a sequel to ''Scarface'', but due to stricter censorship rules, the film was never made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hughes Will Produce Sequel to 'Scarface' |url=https://archive.org/stream/hollywoodreporte1215wilk#page/n141/mode/2up/search/scarface |accessdate=June 14, 2018 |agency=The Hollywood Reporter |date=January 27, 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on a sampling of 36 reviews from 2002&amp;ndash;2018, on the review aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Scarface'' holds a 100% rating; all reviews were positive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1018323-scarface/ "Scarface (1932)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113082936/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1018323-scarface/ |date=November 13, 2013 }}.

===Industry reception===
In 1994, ''Scarface'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|publisher=Congress.gov|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of Tony Camonte ranked at number 47 on ''[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains]]'' list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246 |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807135547/http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246 |archivedate=August 7, 2011 |accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was named the best American sound film by critic and director [[Jean-Luc Godard]] in ''[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openculture.com/2013/12/a-young-jean-luc-godard-picks-the-best-american-films-1963.html|title=A Young Jean-Luc Godard Picks the 10 Best American Films Ever Made (1963)|author=|date=|website=openculture.com|accessdate=May 6, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702082401/http://www.openculture.com/2013/12/a-young-jean-luc-godard-picks-the-best-american-films-1963.html|archivedate=July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/godard.html|title=Jean-Luc Godard's Top Ten Lists 1956–1965|first=Eric C.|last=Johnson|date=|website=alumnus.caltech.edu|accessdate=May 6, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223044716/http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/godard.html|archivedate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, the [[American Film Institute]] revealed its [[AFI's 10 Top 10|"Ten Top Ten"]]—the best ten films in ten "classic" American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. ''Scarface'' was acknowledged as the sixth best in the gangster film genre. The 1983 version was placed 10th, making ''Scarface'' the only film to make the same "10 Top 10" list as its remake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[American Film Institute]] | title = AFI's 10 Top 10 | date = June 17, 2008 | url = http://www.afi.com/10top10/gangster.html | accessdate = June 18, 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130116145351/http://www.afi.com/10top10/gangster.html | archivedate = January 16, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
{{See also|Gangster films}}
Scholars debate whether ''Scarface'' classifies as a film with historical significance or as merely a Hollywood gangster-era flick.{{sfn|Smyth|2004|p=535}} Its historical significance was augmented by the film's writing credits: W.R. Burnett, author of gangster novel ''Little Caesar'' from which the film of the same name was based on, Fred D. Pasley, a prominent Chicago gangland historian, and ex-Chicago reporter Ben Hecht.{{sfn|Smyth|2006|p=76}} Events similar to the assassination of Jim Colismo and the St. Valentine's Day Massacre contribute to the film's realism and authenticity.{{sfn|Langman|Finn|1995|pp=227–228}} Film critic [[Robert E. Sherwood]] stated the film, "merits...as a sociological or historical document...[and] an utterly inexcusable attempt has been made to suppress it—not because it is obscene...but because...it comes to close to telling the truth."{{sfn|Smyth|2004|p=558}}

===Excess===
According to film studies professor Fran Mason, a prominent theme in the film is excess. The opening of the film sets the stage as Big Louie Costillo sits in the remnants of a wild party, convincing his friends his next party will be bigger, better, and have "much more everything".{{sfn|Mason|2002|p=25}} This indicates the excessive life of a gangster, whether in pleasure or in violence. The death scene of Costillo sets the next tone of excess. In this scene, the audience sees only the shadow of Tony Camonte with a gun, hears the shots and the sound of the body hitting the floor. The violent scenes become more severe as the film progresses. Most of the violence in the film is shown through montage, as scenes go by in sequence, showing the brutal murders that Tony and his gang commit such as roughing up bar owners, a drive by bombing, and the massacre of seven men against a wall. A scene shows a peel-off calendar rapidly changing dates while shot by a machine gun, making the excessive violence clear. The violence is not only perpetrated by the gangsters. The police in the final scene with Tony and Cesca spare no effort to catch the notorious Camonte siblings, visible through the disproportionate number of police officers and cars surrounding the apartment complex to apprehend one man. Tony and the police's excessive use of violence throughout the film normalizes it.{{sfn|Mason|2002|pp=25–26}} An element of parody underlies Tony's abnormal joy in using Tommy guns. In the scene in the restaurant in which men from the North side gang attempt to shoot Tony with a Tommy, he obtains pleasure from the power. Rather than cowering beneath the tables, he tries to peek out to watch the guns in action, laughing maniacally from his excitement. He reacts jovially upon getting his first Tommy gun and enthusiastically leaves to, "write [his] name all over the town with it."{{sfn|Mason|2002|p=26}}

The gangster's excessive consumption is comically represented through Tony's quest to obtain expensive goods and show them off. In Tony's first encounter with Poppy alone on the staircase, he boasts about his new suit, jewelry, and bullet-proof car. Poppy largely dismisses his advances calling his look, "kinda effeminate".{{sfn|Mason|2002|p=26}} His feminine consumption and obsession with looks and clothes is juxtaposed by his masculine consumption which is represented by his new car. Later, Tony shows Poppy a stack of new shirts, claiming he will wear each shirt only once. His awkwardness and ignorance of his own exorbitance makes this [[Jay Gatsby|Gatsby]] style scene more comical than serious. His consumption serves to symbolize the disintegration of values of modernity, specifically represented by his poor taste and obsession with money and social status. Tony's excess transcends parody and becomes dangerous, because he represents a complete lack of restraint which ultimately leads to his downfall.{{sfn|Mason|2002|pp=26–27}}

Tony's excess is manifest in the gang wars in the city. He is given express instruction to leave O'Hara, Gaffney, and the rest of the North side gang alone. He disobeys because of his lust for more power, violence, and territory. Not only does he threaten the external power structure of the gangs in relation to physical territory, he disrupts the internal power structure of his own gang by blatantly disobeying his boss Johnny Lovo.{{sfn|Mason|2002|p=27}} Gaffney's physical position juxtaposes Tony's position. Throughout the film, Gaffney's movement is restricted by both setting and implication, because of the crowded spaces in which he is shown onscreen and his troupe of henchmen he is constantly surrounded by. Tony is able to move freely in the beginning of the film, becoming progressively more crowded until he is as confined as Gaffney. He is surrounded by henchmen and cannot move as freely throughout the city. This, however, is self-imposed by his own excessive desire for territory and power.{{sfn|Mason|2002|p=27}}

The theme of excessiveness is further exemplified by Tony's incestuous desires for his sister, Cesca, whom he attempts to control and restrict. Their mother acts as the voice of reason, but Tony does not listen to her, subjecting his family to the excess and violence he brings upon himself.{{sfn|Mason|2002|p=27}} His lust for violence mirror's Cesca's lust for sexual freedom, symbolized by her seductive dance for Rinaldo at the club. Rinaldo is split between his loyalty for Tony and his passion for Cesca, serving as a symbol of the power struggle between the Camonte siblings. Rinaldo is a symbol of Tony's power and prominence; his murder signifies Tony's lack of control and downfall, which ends in Tony's own death.{{sfn|Mason|2002|p=28}}

===American Dream===
{{See also|American dream}}
Camonte's rise to prominence and success is modeled after the American Dream, but more overtly violent. As the film follows the rise and fall of an Italian gangster, Tony becomes increasingly more Americanized. When Tony appears from under the towel at the barbershop, this is the first time the audience gets a look at his face. He appears foreign with a noticeable Italian accent, slicked hair and an almost Neanderthal appearance evident by the scars on his cheek.{{sfn|Clarens|1980|p=93}} As the movie progresses, he becomes more Americanized as he loses his accent and his suits change from gaudy to elegant.{{sfn|Clarens|1980|p=93}} By the end of the film, his accent is hardly noticeable. Upon the time of his death, he had accumulated many "objects" which portray the success suggested by the American Dream: his own secretary, a girlfriend of significant social status (more important even is she was the mistress of his old boss), as well as a fancy apartment, big cars, and nice clothes. Camonte exemplifies the idea of the American Dream that one can obtain success in America by following Camonte's own motto to, "Do it first, do it yourself, and keep on doin' it."{{sfn|Clarens|1980|p=95}} On the other hand, Camonte represents the American urge to reject modern life and society, in turn rejecting Americanism itself. The gangster strives for the same American Dream as anyone else, but through violence and illicit activity, approaches it in a way at odds with modern societal values.{{sfn|Grieveson|Sonnet|Stanfield|2005|pp=1–2}}

===Gangster territory===
Control of territory is a theme in the gangster film genre in a physical sense and on the movie screen. Tony works to control the city by getting rid of competing gangs and gaining physical control of the city, and he likewise gains control of the movie screen in his rise to power. This is most evident in scenes and interactions involving Tony, Johnny, and Poppy. In an early scene in the film, Tony comes to Johnny's apartment to receive his payment after killing Louie Costillo. Two rooms are visible in the shot: the main room, where Tony sits, and the room in the background where Poppy sits and where Johnny keeps his money. Lovo goes into the back room but Tony does not, so this room represents Johnny's power and territory. The men are sitting across from each other in the scene with Poppy sitting in the middle of them in the background representing the trophy they are both fighting for. However, they both appear equally in the shot, representing their equality of power. Later, in the nightclub scene, Tony sits himself in between Poppy and Johnny showing he is in control through his centrality in the shot. He has gained the most power and territory, as indicated by "winning" Poppy.{{sfn|Mason|2002|pp=23–24}}

===Fear of technology===
''Scarface'' represents the American fears and confusion stemmed from the technological advancement of the time: whether technological advancement and mass production be feared or celebrated. An overall anxiety post-[[World War 1]] was whether new technology would cause ultimate destruction or whether it would help make lives easier and bring happiness. In the film, Tony excitedly revels in the possibilities of machine guns can bring by killing more people, more quickly and from further away. This represents the question of whether mass production equals mass destruction or mass efficiency.{{sfn|Benyahia|2012|p=16}}

===Objects and gestures===
The use of playful motifs throughout the film showcased Howard Hawks's [[dark comedy]] he expressed through his directing.{{sfn|Langman|Finn|1995|pp=227–228}} In the bowling alley scene, where rival gang leader Tom Gaffney was murdered, when Gaffney throws the ball, the shot remains on the last standing bowling pin, which falls to represent the death of kingpin Tom Gaffney. In the same scene, before the death of Gaffney, a shot shows an "X" on the scoreboard, foreshadowing Gaffney's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|1999|p=46}};{{harvnb|Langman|Finn|1995|pp=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawks used the "X" foreshadowing technique 15 to 20 times throughout the film (seen first in the opening credits) which were chiefly associated with death appearing many times (but not every scene) when a death is portrayed; the motif appears in numerous places, most prominently as Tony's "X" scar on his left cheek.&lt;ref name="amc" /&gt; The motifs mock the life of the gangster.{{sfn|Langman|Finn|1995|pp=227–228}} The gangster's hat is a common theme throughout gangster films, specifically ''Scarface'', as representative of [[conspicuous consumption]].{{sfn|Grieveson|Sonnet|Stanfield|2005|p=173}} Hawks included hand gestures, a common motif in his films. In ''Scarface'', George Raft was instructed to repetitively flip a coin, which he does throughout the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McElhaney|2006|pp=31–45}}; {{harvnb|Neale|2016|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The World is Yours"===
Camonte's apartment looks out on a neon, flashing sign that says "The World Is Yours". This sign represents the modern American city as a place of opportunity and individualism. As attractive as the slogan is, the message is impossible, yet Tony doesn't understand this. The view from his apartment represents the rise of the gangster. When Camonte is killed in the street outside his building, the camera pans up to show the billboard, representative of the societal paradox of the existence of opportunity yet the inability to achieve it.{{sfn|Benyahia|2012|p=17}} According to [[Robert Warshow]], the ending scene represents how the world is not ours, but not his either. The death of the gangster momentarily releases us from the idea of the concept of success and the need to succeed.{{sfn|Warshow|1954|p=191}} In regards to the theme of excess, the sign is a metaphor for the dividing desires created by modernity seen through the lens of the excessive desires of the gangster persona.{{sfn|Mason|2002|p=28}}

===Style===
"Sharp" and "hard-edged", ''Scarface'' set the visual style for the gangster films of the 1930s.{{sfn|Martin|1985|p=35}} Hawks created a violent, gripping film through his use of strong contrast of black and white in his cinematography, for example, dark rooms, silhouettes of bodies against drawn shades, and pools of carefully placed light. Much of the film is shown to take place at night. Tight grouping of subjects within the shot and stalking camera movement followed the course of action in the film.{{sfn|Clarens|1980|p=93}} The cinematography is dynamic and characterized by highly varied camera placement and mobile framing.{{sfn|Danks|2016|p=46}}

==Legacy==
Despite its lack of success at the box office, ''Scarface'' was one of the most discussed films of 1932 due to its subject matter, and its struggle and triumph over censor boards.{{sfn|Smyth|2004|p=558}} ''Scarface'' is cited (often with ''Little Caesar'' and ''The Public Enemy'') as the archetype of the gangster film genre, because it set the early standard for the genre which continue to appear in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brookes|2016|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Hossent|1974|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Scarface'' would be the last of the three big gangsters films of the early 1930s, as the outrage at the Pre-Code violence caused by the three films, particularly ''Scarface'' sparked the creation of the [[Production Code Administration]] in 1934.{{sfn|Grønstad|2003|p=387}} Howard Hawks cited ''Scarface'' as one of his favorite works and the film was a subject of pride for Howard Hughes. Hughes locked the film in his vaults a few years after release, refusing many profitable offers to distribute the film or to buy its rights. After his death in 1976, filmmakers were able to gain access to the rights to ''Scarface'' which sparked the 1983 remake starring Al Pacino.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=76}}

Paul Muni's performance in ''Scarface'' as "the quintessential gangster anti-hero" contributed greatly to his rapid ascent into his acclaimed film career.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Silver|Ursini|2007|p=261}};{{harvnb|Thomas|1985|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Muni received significant accolades for his performance as Tony Camonte. Critics praised Muni for his robust and fierce performance.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=74}} Al Pacino stated he was greatly inspired by Paul Muni and Muni influenced his own performance in the 1983 ''Scarface'' remake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leight|first1=Elias|title='Scarface' Reunion: 10 Things we Learned at Tribeca Film Festival Event|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/scarface-reunion-10-things-we-learned-w519371|accessdate=May 25, 2018|agency=Rolling Stone|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the impressive portrayal of a rising gangster, critics claim the character minimally resembled Al Capone. Unlike Camonte, Capone avoided grunt work and typically employed others to do his dirty work for him. Moreover, Muni's Scarface at the end revealed the Capone character to be a coward as he pled for mercy and tried to escape before getting shot in the street. Capone wasn't known for his cowardice and didn't die in battle.{{sfn|Hossent|1974|p=21}}

''Scarface'' would be Ann Dvorak's best and most well-known film.{{sfn|Rice|2013|p=1}} The film launched Raft's lengthy career as a [[leading man]]. Raft, in the film's second lead, had learned to flip a coin without looking at it, a trait of his character, and he made a strong impression in the comparatively sympathetic but colorful role. Howard Hawks told Raft to use this in the film to camouflage his lack of acting experience.{{sfn|Aaker|2013|p=24}} A reference is made in Raft's later role as gangster Spats Columbo in ''[[Some Like it Hot]]'' (1959), wherein he asks a fellow gangster (who is flipping a coin) "Where did you pick up {{em|that}} cheap trick?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Corliss|first1=Richard|title=That Old Feeling: Hot and Heavy|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,181984,00.html|accessdate=May 15, 2018|agency=Time|publisher=Time, Inc|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie ''Scarface'' may have had an influence on actual gangster life four years after the film was released. In 1936, [[Jack McGurn]] who was thought to be responsible for the St. Valentine's Massacre depicted in the film, was murdered by rivals in a bowling alley.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fetherling|1977|p=96}}; {{harvnb|Wallace|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italian language versions==
In October 1946, after [[World War II]] and the relations between Italy and the United States softened, [[Titanus]], an Italian film production company was interested in translating ''Scarface'' into Italian. Initially, upon requesting approval from the Italian film office, the request was rejected due censorship concerns of the portrayal of violence and crime throughout the film. There was no initial concern about the film's portrayal of Italians.{{sfn|Keating|2016|p=111}} Titanus appealed to the Italian film office calling ''Scarface'', "one of the most solid and constructive motion pictures ever produced overseas".{{sfn|Keating|2016|p=112}} They lobbied to bring in a foreign language film to help domestic film producers save money in the Italian economy damaged by the recent war. After receiving approval at the end of 1946, Titanus translated a script for dubbing the film.{{sfn|Keating|2016|p=112}} One difference in the Italian script, is the names of the characters were changed from Italian sounding to more American sounding. For example, Tony Camonte was changed to Tony Kermont, and Guino Rinaldo was changed to Guido Reynold.{{sfn|Keating|2016|p=112}} This, and several other changes were made to conspicuously remove references to Italians. Another example is the difference in the scene in the restaurant with Tony and Johnny. In the American version, Tony makes an comical statement about the garlic in the pasta, whereas in the Italian translation, the food in question is a duck liver pâté, a less overtly Italian reference to food.{{sfn|Keating|2016|p=113}} Moreover, in the American version, the gangsters are referred to as illegal immigrants by the outraged community; however, in the Italian dubbed version, the citizen status of the criminals is not mentioned, merely the concern of repeat offenders.{{sfn|Keating|2016|pp=113–114}}

The film was redubbed into Italian in 1976 by the broadcasting company ''[[RAI|Radio Televisione Italiana]]'' (RAI). Franco Dal Cer translated the script and the dub was directed by Giulio Panicali. [[Pino Locchi]] dubbed the voice of Tony Camonte for Paul Muni and [[Pino Colizzi]] dubbed the voice of Gunio Rinaldo for George Raft. A difference between the 1947 version and the 1976 version is that all of the Italian names are and Italian cultural references were untouched from the original American script.{{sfn|Keating|2016|p=115}} The 1976 version celebrates the Italian backgrounds of the characters, adding noticeably different Italian dialects to specific characters.{{sfn|Keating|2016|p=116}} This version of the dubbed film translates the opening and closing credit scenes as well as the newspaper clippings shown into Italian; however, the translation of the newspaper clippings was not done with particular aesthetic care.{{sfn|Keating|2016|p=117}}

The film was redubbed in the 1990s and released on Universal's digital edition. According to scholarly consensus, the 1990 dub is a combination of re-voicing and reuse of audio from the 1976 redub.{{sfn|Keating|2016|pp=118–119}}

Universal announced in 2011 that the studio is developing a new version of ''Scarface''. The studio claims the new film is neither a sequel nor a remake, but will take elements from both the 1932 and the 1983 version, including the basic premise of a man who becomes a kingpin in his quest for the [[American Dream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fleming Jr. |first1=Mike |title=Universal Preps New 'Scarface' Movie |url=https://deadline.com/2011/09/universal-pictures-readying-a-new-scarface-174530/ |accessdate=October 26, 2018 |work=Deadline: Hollywood |publisher=Penske Business Media |date=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 11, 2016, Universal announced [[Antoine Fuqua]] was in talks to direct the remake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2016/08/scarface-antoine-fuqua-remake-universal-al-pacino-1201801594/|title=Antoine Fuqua Circling New 'Scarface' At Universal|last=Fleming, Jr.|first=Mike|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=United States|date=August 10, 2016|language=en-US|access-date=August 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811110216/http://deadline.com/2016/08/scarface-antoine-fuqua-remake-universal-al-pacino-1201801594/|archivedate=August 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 10, 2017, Fuqua left the remake with the [[Coen brothers]] rewriting the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thewrap.com/coen-brothers-bring-back-scarface/|title=Coen Brothers to Bring Back ‘Scarface’ in 2018|author=Wrap Staff|date=February 10, 2017|work=The Wrap|accessdate=February 10, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210210515/http://www.thewrap.com/coen-brothers-bring-back-scarface/|archivedate=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Fuqua was back on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming Jr|first1=Mike|title=Antoine Fuqua Back in 'Scarface' Talks|url=http://deadline.com/2018/02/antoine-fuqua-back-in-scarface-talks-1202287477/|accessdate=May 29, 2018|agency=Deadline|publisher=Penske Business Media|date=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Scarface'' is often associated with other [[Pre-Code crime films|pre-code crime films]] released in the early 1930s such as ''[[The Doorway to Hell]]'' (1930), ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' (1931) and ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' (1931).{{sfn|Smyth|2006|p=59}} According to Fran Mason of the [[University of Winchester]], ''Scarface'' is more similar to the film ''[[The Roaring Twenties]]'' than its early 1930s gangster film contemporaries, because of its excess.{{sfn|Mason|2002|p=24}}

'''''Sleuth''''' is a 1972 British-American [[mystery film|mystery]] [[thriller film]] directed by [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] and starring [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Michael Caine]]. The screenplay by playwright [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]] was based on his 1970 [[Tony Award]]-winning [[Sleuth (play)|play]]. Both Olivier and Caine were nominated for [[Academy Awards]] for their performances. This was Mankiewicz's final film. Critics gave the film overwhelmingly positive reviews,&lt;ref name=RottenTomatoes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1019196-sleuth/|publisher=rottentomatoes|title=Sleuth (1972)|accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would later note similarities between it and Caine's 1982 film ''[[Deathtrap (film)|Deathtrap]]''.&lt;ref name="Ebert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deathtrap review"&gt;Maslin, Janet.

==Plot==
Andrew Wyke, a successful writer of crime fiction, who lives in a large country manor house filled with elaborate games and [[automata]], invites his wife's lover Milo Tindle, a hairdresser of Italian heritage, to his home to discuss the situation. Andrew explains that he has tired of his wife and wants Milo to take her off his hands. In order to provide Milo with enough money to take care of her, Andrew suggests that Milo steal some jewellery from the house, with Andrew recouping his losses through an insurance claim. Milo agrees and allows Andrew to lead him through an elaborate charade to fake the robbery. At the conclusion, Andrew pulls a pistol and reveals that the entire plot was meant to frame Milo as a robber, giving Andrew an excuse for shooting him. Andrew then appears to execute Milo by shooting him in the head.

A few days later, a policeman, Inspector Doppler, arrives at the manor house to investigate Milo's disappearance. Andrew at first purports to know nothing, but his guilt becomes evident as the inspector collates clues. Frightened, Andrew breaks down and explains the burglary ruse, but insists that he only pretended to shoot Milo using a blank cartridge and that his rival left the house humiliated but alive. Andrew insists that he has no knowledge of what happened to Milo after he left the house. After finding more seemingly unmistakable evidence that a murder has taken place recently in the house, Doppler arrests Andrew for murder. As Andrew is about to be taken to the station, Doppler reveals himself to actually be Milo, in disguise, having engaged in the deception to get revenge on Andrew.

Just as the score seems to be even between the two, Milo explains that they will now play another game, this time involving a real murder. Milo describes how he visited Andrew's mistress, Tea, that afternoon, and strangled her. The police will soon be arriving and he has planted evidence throughout the house that could well incriminate Andrew in Tea's murder. Andrew dismisses this, but phones Tea anyway. Tea's flatmate, Joyce, tells him tearfully that Tea has been strangled and her body found. Andrew now hunts through the house in an increasing fervour, searching for each piece of evidence on cryptic clues from Milo, who is revelling in Andrew's predicament. Andrew finds the last item just as Milo sees the police arriving outside the house. Milo answers the door to the police while a dishevelled Andrew straightens himself up. In the background we hear Milo talking to the police officers in an attempt to stall their entry into the house, which Andrew pleaded with him to do. Milo then invites the officers in. However, there are no policemen. Milo reveals that he faked Tea's death with Joyce and Tea's willing help, thus fooling Andrew a second time.

Milo gets ready to leave, but he continues to taunt Andrew with humiliating information he obtained from both Andrew's wife and his mistress. Andrew trains a gun on Milo and threatens to kill him. However, Milo warns him that he has anticipated this reaction and really has called the police, who are due any time. If Andrew kills him then he will be caught red-handed. Andrew, pushed too far, refuses to believe any of it and shoots Milo, mortally wounding him. The police arrive and approach the house and a distraught and defeated Andrew locks himself in the house. As Milo dies, he tells Andrew to be sure to tell the police that it was "all just a bloody game".

==Cast==
* [[Laurence Olivier]] as Andrew Wyke
* [[Michael Caine]] as Milo Tindle

==Production==
[[File:Lord Olivier 10 Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|[[Laurence Olivier]] in his dressing room on the set of ''Sleuth'' (1972)]]
Shaffer was initially reluctant to sell the film rights to the play, fearful it would undercut the success of the stage version. When he finally did relent, he hoped the film would retain the services of [[Anthony Quayle]], who had essayed the role of Wyke in London and on Broadway. [[Alan Bates]] was Shaffer’s pick for the part of Milo Tindle. In the end, director Mankiewicz opted for Olivier and Caine.

When they met, Caine asked Olivier how he should address him. Olivier told him that it should be as "Lord Olivier", and added that now that that was settled he could call him "Larry".&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20071011/d_cover11_side.art.htm|publisher=USA Today|title=Follow these clues to the original 'Sleuth'|accessdate=24 June 2012|date=10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shaffer, Olivier stated that when filming began he looked upon Caine as an assistant, but that by the end of filming he regarded him as a full partner.

The likeness of actress [[Joanne Woodward]] was used for the painting of Marguerite Wyke.&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt;

The production team intended to reveal as little about the movie as possible so as to make the conclusion a complete surprise to the audience. For this reason there is a false cast list at the beginning of the film which lists fictional people playing roles that do not exist. They are Alec Cawthorne as Inspector Doppler, John Matthews as Detective Sergeant Tarrant, Eve Channing (named after the characters Eve Harrington and Margo Channing from Mankiewicz's 1950 film ''[[All About Eve]]'') as Marguerite Wyke, and Teddy Martin as Police Constable Higgs.

Much of the story revolves around the theme of [[crime fiction]], as written by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] (Lord Merridew = [[Lord Peter Wimsey]]) or [[Agatha Christie]], whose photo is included on Wyke's wall, and how it relates to real-life criminal investigations. Class conflict is also raised between Wyke, who has the trappings of an English country gentleman, compared to Tindle, the son of an immigrant from a poor area of London.

==Reception==
The film received extremely positive reviews, and with modern audiences has 96% positive reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref name=RottenTomatoes /&gt;

The film was nominated for [[Academy Award]]s for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] ([[Michael Caine]] and [[Laurence Olivier]]), [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Music Score|Best Music, Original Dramatic Score]]. Olivier won the [[New York Film Critics]] award for [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] as a compromise selection after the voters became deadlocked in a choice between [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Al Pacino]] in ''[[The Godfather]]'' after [[Stacy Keach]] in ''[[Fat City (film)|Fat City]]'' won a plurality in initial voting and rules were changed requiring a majority.&lt;ref&gt;''Inside Oscar'', Mason Wiley and [[Damien Bona]], Ballantine Books (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Shaffer received an [[Edgar Award]] for his screenplay.

The film was the second to have practically its entire cast (Caine and Olivier) nominated for Academy Awards after ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (film)|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' in 1966 and the first where exactly all of the actors in the film were nominated. (''Virginia Woolf'' featured uncredited bit parts by actors playing the roadhouse manager and waitress.) This feat has been repeated only by ''[[Give 'em Hell, Harry!]]'' (1975), in which [[James Whitmore]] is the sole credited actor.

Critics [[Roger Ebert]], [[Janet Maslin]], Gary Arnold of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', and several film historians have all noted similarities between ''Sleuth'' and Caine's 1982 film ''[[Deathtrap (film)|Deathtrap]]''.&lt;ref name=Ebert&gt;Ebert, Roger. [http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/deathtrap-1982 ''Deathtrap'' review], ''Chicago Sun Times'' (Jan. 1, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deathtrap review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dick, Bernard p.276"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael Caine: You're A Big Man"/&gt; ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' episode 121 featured [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] playing Michael Caine, arguing that the two films were different because the library appeared on different sides of the set.

==Deleted footage==
While questioning Wyke, Doppler points out that the clown costume that Tindle was wearing when he was shot is missing, though the clown's mask is later found and put on the head of the plastic skeleton in the cellar. He is probably implying that Tindle was buried with it.

In the trailer for the film, there are the scenes with Doppler laying out the evidence against Wyke as shown in the movie. They include him pulling open the shower curtains in one of the bathrooms and exposing the clown's jacket, dripping wet and apparently with bloodstains on it. This scene was not included in the final film.

==Preservation==
The [[Academy Film Archive]] preserved ''Sleuth'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=Sleuth&amp;filmmaker=&amp;category=All&amp;collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007 film==
{{Main article|Sleuth (2007 film)}}
In September 2006 [[Kenneth Branagh]] announced at the [[Venice Film Festival]] his new film of the play, with the screenplay by [[Nobel laureate]] [[Harold Pinter]]. Caine starred in this adaptation, this time in the role of Wyke, while [[Jude Law]] played Tindle as a struggling actor. Production was completed in March 2007, and released in the UK on 23 November 2007. The remake did not use any of the dialogue in Shaffer's original script, and was considered unsuccessful in comparison to the original.

All owners of television equipment or any other equipment able or adaptable so to receive television are required by [[Italy|Italian]] law to have a [[television licence]]. The licence is used to part-fund the Italian public service broadcaster [[RAI]]. The licence fee was introduced for owners of radio sets in 1923, and is currently governed by a law which dates back to 1938. The annual cost of the licence fee is around €100 once VAT (IVA) is accounted for.

Unlike [[television licensing in the United Kingdom]], there is no exception for those who only use a TV to receive non-broadcast signals such as playing [[DVD]]s or watching [[online video]]s.

From January 2016 all Italian electricity bills will carry a monthly surcharge which will be the equivalent of one tenth of the annual TV licence fee.

==Cost of the licence fee over time==

The following table shows the cost of the licence fee excluding the base rate and valued-added tax.

'''''The Duplex Planet''''' is a [[zine]] edited and published by [[David Greenberger]] since 1979. It contains transcriptions of his interviews with elderly residents of [[senior centers]] and "meal sites" in the [[Massachusetts]] area. For many years, the zine focused on the residents of the Duplex Nursing Home, located in [[Boston]]. 

''The Duplex Planet'' has subsequently found larger audiences in other forms — which are all derived from the original template — including book collections, [[spoken-word]] recordings, and a series of concerts. A series of personal commentaries drawn from Greenberger's experiences with this body of work has aired regularly on [[National Public Radio]]'s "[[All Things Considered]]". 

Some of the Duplex Nursing Home residents, all identified by name, became recurring characters in the zine and its various offshoots and adaptations.

== Background ==
In 1979, having just completed a degree in fine arts as a painter, Greenberger took a job as activities director at the Duplex Nursing Home.

"This is my art," he said.{{cn|date=September 2016}} In this unexpected setting, Greenberger found an unusual medium and a desire to portray the people he met as living human beings instead of "just repositories of their memories or the wisdom of the ages."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/lifepart2/episodes/respect.html Life Part 2 .

'''''The Falling Astronauts''''' is a science fiction novel by American writer  [[Barry N. Malzberg]], first published in 1971 in a paperback edition by [[Ace Books]].

==Plot summary==
The novel's protagonist Colonel Richard Martin suffers a [[mental breakdown]] during one of the series of space missions to test [[nuclear weapon|nuclear seismic charge]]s on the Moon. Disillusioned by the space program, Martin agrees to handle public relations for one more mission before termination. However, the mission to install the seismic charges on the lunar surface goes awry when one of the astronauts goes rogue and threatens nuclear destruction upon Earth.

==Reception==
In 1972, ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]''{{'}}s [[Joanna Russ]] praised ''The Falling Astronauts'' with "What is astonishing about this novel is not that the protagonist (the point-of-view character) is mad, ''but that everyone else is, too.'' It is eerie to listen to a mad madman being interviewed by a ‘sane’ madman in a world where any pretense to ‘rationality’ is the maddest thing of all."&lt;ref name="Russ 1972" /&gt; ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]''{{'}}s [[Theodore Sturgeon]] said "Malzberg gives a voice to the mixed-up, the impotent, to the torment of helplessness—and to the peculiar hope that personal integrity, even if it be irrational or wrong-headed, may just possibly be able to beat the system."&lt;ref name="Sturgeon 1972" /&gt; In 1973, ''[[Algol (fanzine)|Algol]]''{{'}}s [[Richard A. Lupoff]] reviewed the novel with "It's a study in the dehumanizing pressure of space-flight, from an author passionately devoted to the notion of space exploration."&lt;ref name="Lupoff 1973" /&gt;

In 2013, ''[[The Paris Review]]''{{'}}s J. D. Daniels reviewed Malzberg's work including ''The Falling Astronauts'' with "[j]ust because I like it doesn’t mean it isn’t crap."&lt;ref name="Daniels 2013" /&gt; While reviewing ''[[Beyond Apollo]]'', ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]''{{'}}s [[Don D'Ammassa]] said novels like ''The Falling Astronauts'' were "denounced regularly in letter columns and in the fan press."&lt;ref name="D'Ammassa 2013" /&gt;

==In popular fiction==
Under a [[pseudonym]], ''[[Locus Online]]''{{'}}s [[Paul Di Filippo]] reported that on [[April Fools' Day|April 1]], 2006 writer [[Barry N. Malzberg]] was invited by [[Richard Branson]] to fly on the spaceflight company [[Virgin Galactic]]. ''The Falling Astronauts'' was one of the novels that "revealed the rot and canker and delusions at the roots of [[NASA|governmental space travel]]."&lt;ref name="Di Filippo 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sellars 2006" /&gt;

The '''tragedy of the anticommons''' is a type of coordination breakdown, in which a single resource has numerous rightsholders who prevent others from using it, frustrating what would be a socially desirable outcome. It is a mirror-image of the older concept of [[tragedy of the commons]], in which numerous rightsholders' combined use exceeds the capacity of a resource and depletes or destroys it.&lt;ref name="heller98" /&gt; The "tragedy of the anticommons" covers a range of coordination failures including [[patent thicket]]s, and [[submarine patent]]s. Overcoming these breakdowns can be difficult, but there are assorted means, including [[eminent domain]], [[Laches (equity)|laches]], [[patent pool]]s, or other licensing organizations.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1998 ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' article, Heller and Rebecca Eisenberg, while not disputing the role of patents in general in motivating invention and disclosure, argue that biomedical research was one of several key areas where competing [[patent]] rights could actually prevent useful and affordable products from reaching the marketplace.&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heller |first=M.

==Examples==

===Early aviation===
In early aviation, the [[Wright brothers]] held patents on certain aspects of aircraft, while [[Glenn Curtiss]] held patents on [[ailerons]] which was an advance on the Wrights' system, but antipathy between the patent holders prevented their use. The government was forced to step in and enforce the existence of a [[patent pool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/08/11/the-permission-problem|title=The Permission Problem|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-communism===
{{confusing|section|date=March 2016}}
In a 1998 ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' article by Michael Heller,&lt;ref name="heller98" /&gt; he noted that after the [[post-communism|fall of Communism]], in many [[Eastern Europe]]an cities, there were a lot of open air kiosks but also a lot of empty stores. Upon investigation, he concluded that because many different agencies and private parties had rights over the use of store space, it was difficult or even impossible for a [[Startup company|startup]] retailer to negotiate successfully for the use of that space. Even though all the persons with ownership rights were losing money with the empty stores, and stores were in great demand, their competing interests got in the way of the effective use of space.

===Robber barons===
{{confusing|section|date=March 2016}}[[Michael Heller (law professor)|Michael Heller]] says that the rise of the "[[Robber baron (feudalism)|robber baron]]s" in [[Germany in the Middle Ages|medieval]] Germany was the result of the tragedy of the anticommons.&lt;ref name="heller2008"/&gt; Nobles commonly attempted to collect tolls on stretches of the [[Rhine]] passing by or through their fiefs, building towers alongside the river and stretching iron chains to prevent boats from carrying cargo up and down the river without paying a fee.&lt;ref name="heller2008" /&gt; Repeated attempts were made by the [[Holy Roman Empire]], including several efforts over the centuries led by the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] himself, to regulate toll collection on the Rhine, but it was not until the establishment of the "Rhine League" of the Emperor, certain nobles, and certain clergy that the control of the "robber barons" over the Rhine was crushed by military force. River tolls on the Rhine, increasingly imposed by states rather than individual lords, remained a sticking point in relations and commerce in the Rhine basin until the establishment of the [[Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine]] in 1815.

===Biomedical===
[[Michael Heller (law professor)|Michael Heller]] and [[Rebecca Eisenberg]] are academic law professors who believe that [[biological patent]]s creating a "tragedy of the anticommons," "in which people underuse scarce resources because too many owners can block each other."&lt;ref name=science/&gt;  Others claim that patents have not created this "anticommons" effect on research, based on surveys of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook |first=Robert |url=http://www.thehastingscenter.org/Publications/BriefingBook/Detail.aspx?id=2174 |title=Gene Patents |publisher=The Hastings Center |date= |accessdate=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceprogress.org/2009/10/do-gene-patents-hurt-research/|title=Do Gene Patents Hurt Research?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This poem draws upon the [[Tristan and Iseult]] legends which were popular with contemporary readers.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Matthew. ''Poetic Works.'' London: Oxford University Press, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The poem opens with [[Tristan|Tristram]] upon his deathbed. The monologue of the dying man is shot through by sharp pangs of regret: centering upon his induced passion for [[Iseult]] of [[Ireland]] - inflamed by his unwittingly imbibing an irresistible love-[[potion]]. 

Before his decease Iseult of Ireland arrives in time to share his deathbed. Iseult of [[Brittany]], his lawful wife, graciously accedes to their request to be buried near each other - in a splendidly-constructed [[mausoleum]] back in King Mark's [[Tintagel Castle|Tyntagel]] (sic.) in [[Cornwall]].

Iseult of Brittany survives to raise Tristram's children in isolation. She forgives Tristram his adultery, and with delightful pathos is thankful for the years of happiness that she spent espoused to one of [[King Arthur|King Arthur's]] most renowned knights.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Matthew. ''Poetic Works.'' London: Oxford University Press, 1950. pp. 130-ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"We Call It Acieed"''' is an [[acid house]]-influenced song from ''[[A Little Bit of This, a Little Bit of That]]'' by [[D Mob]] featuring [[Gary Haisman]].  The song ranked #1 at Dance Music/[[Club Play Singles]] and #25 at [[Hot Dance Music]]/Maxi-Singles Sales in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=D-Mob |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/d-mob-mn0000140269/awards |title=D-Mob - Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reached number 3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name=uk/&gt;

The song is also featured on ''Dance Massive, Vol. 2 [Phantom]'', ''History of Techno [ZYX]'', ''Smash Hits 1988'' and ''Acid House Anthems''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/we-call-it-acieed-trance-dance-mt0011965693 |title=We Call It Acieed - D-Mob : Listen, Appearances, Song Review |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Video ==
The [[music video|video]] features D Mob and singing in front of people with [[yellow]] [[mask]]s in the shapes of [[triangle]]s, [[square]]s and [[circle]]s, with the occasional mask of an [[eye]]. The song involves Haisman chanting "Acieed" through the entire video.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEdiOBz4zeM |title=D-Mob "We call it acieed" |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The yellow smiley face icon had recently been adopted as a symbol of the acid house scene.

The original music video only lasted approximately two minutes long, as the record label FFRR did not think the song would be a hit and chose not to spend further money. Many years later, an unofficial edit of the video was made, stretching the length out to the full 3 minutes and 14 seconds of the radio version by repeating certain parts.

== Removal from BBC Playlist ==
Because the song seemed to be condoning drug use (despite Danny D's claim that the song was about the music and points that out in the lyrics), in October 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Vine |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/15/we-call-it-acieed-banned |title=We Call It Acieed banned on R1October &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2011-06-15|accessdate=2013-06-08 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[BBC]] removed the song from their [[playlist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Craig Hitchings |url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/bbcs-banned-music-to-be-released-168461 |title=BBC's banned music to be released |publisher=MusicRadar |date=2008-08-25 |accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to ban the song came especially after [[Caron Keating]] and a smiley face T-shirted [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]] enthusiastically introduced the video for the song on the 20 October 1988 edition of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' during an acid house backlash from tabloids, and this lead for an absence of acid house tracks on the show until "[[Stakker Humanoid]]" by [[The Future Sound of London|Humanoid]] two months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/11/stakker-humanoid-25th-anniversary-acid-house|title=Stakker Humanoid: how the Future Sound of London won hearts and minds|first=Stuart|last=Aitken|date=11 November 2013|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The track was used as a plot device on the BBC soap ''[[EastEnders]]'' in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/988297/EastEnders-Spoilers-Stuart-Highway-Tina-Cater-rape-plot-Ricky-Champ-BBC-video|title=EastEnders: Did Stuart Highway rape Tina Carter in horrifying twist?|last=Lauder|first=Ed|date=13 July 2018|work=[[Daily Express]]|accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While primarily dominated by men throughout history, women have been represented in the field of comedy since the mid 1700s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.wsupress.wayne.edu/books/detail/laughing-feminism|title=Laughing Feminism Subversive Comedy in Frances Burney and Maria Edgeworth|date=2002|publisher=Wayne State University Press|last1=Bilger|first1=Audrey|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=We Killed: The Rise of Women in American Comedy|date=2002|publisher=Sarah Crichton Books|last1=Kohen|first1=Yael}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comedy]], or creative works with the intention of humor, is thought to have originated in ancient Greek theatre in 425 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YhaawA_m9SEC&amp;pg=PR9|title=Lysistrata|last=Aristophanes|date=1996-01-01|publisher=Nick Hern Books|isbn=978-1-85459-325-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the first figures to enter the field, however, were faced with resistance and discrimination.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.makers.com/documentary/womenincomedy|title=Women in Comedy|work=MAKERS|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2007/01/hitchens200701|title=Why Women Aren't Funny|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|access-date=2017-02-25|language=en|newspaper=Vanity Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of humor in women was previously thought to have meant the ability to laugh at a man's joke, rather than tell the joke herself.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When women did finally enter comedy (in its various forms), it was seen as niche, thus making bookings hard to come by.

Early acts were often based in the standard roles of women as a housewife and mother.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Comedy was tailored to what men would find to be both funny and non-threatening.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As women gained slow acceptance to their presence in comedy, they were able to expand the topics that they covered.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since then, women have made significant gains in the field, having found fame through stand-up, television, movies, and writing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Women such as [[Amy Schumer]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Wanda Sykes]], [[Gina Barreca]] and many others have contributed to the world of comedy, spanning both time and medium.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As comedic license has grown, comedy has become a tool within the scope of [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; By reclaiming a previously male-exclusive art form, female comedians are able to use patriarchal structure against itself.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Today, feminist comedy draws attention to female issues such as [[menstruation]], [[rape]], [[gender inequality]], beauty norms, and [[machismo]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; As a readily acceptable and understandable medium of communication, comedy lends itself to the feminist movement, allowing women's issues to be more wide-spread in general society.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Comedic forms==

===Stand-up===
Stand-up comedy is a form of comedy in which performers act in front of a live audience, creating an interactive dependency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dz-hsuL3r_QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=stand%20up&amp;f=false|title=Look Who's Laughing: Gender and Comedy|last=Finney|first=Gail|date=1994-01-01|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9782881246449|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jokes range from short one-liners to longer monologues. The comedic form requires a takeover the stage, in order for the comedian's material to "kill."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For women, the direct contact with the audience puts their womanhood on display. Many female comedians choose to wear loose-fitting clothing to take their femininity out of the spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bitchmedia.org/post/here-is-whats-scary-about-being-a-female-stand-up-comic|title=Here is What's Scary About Being a Female Stand-Up Comic. {{!}} Bitch Media|work=Bitch Media|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late night television===
[[File:SamanthaBeeFeb2011.jpg|thumb|[[Samantha Bee]] at a [[Hudson Union Society]] event in February 2011]]
American late night television (''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'' etc...) has been dominated by white men for almost its entire existence. With the exception of ''[[Full Frontal with Samantha Bee|Full Frontal]]'' with [[Samantha Bee]], no woman has had a late night show on a major network of her own. The platform allows a variety of comedic  (monologues and shorts) and political (interviews and exposés) opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexandra-popken/why-its-time-for-a-woman-_b_6813704.html|title=Why It's Time for a Woman to Host a Late Night Talk Show|last=Popken|first=Alexandra|date=2015-03-06|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mic.com/articles/137160/why-are-there-so-few-female-late-night-hosts#.migMKG8nY|title=Why Are There So Few Female Late-Night Hosts?|last=Mic|work=Mic|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
Film in general, as well as comedic film, continues to show the gender imbalance of other forms of comedy. In 2014, a study found that there were 2.24 male characters for every one female character. Of the movies surveyed, only 30.9% of the speaking characters were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/20-mustknow-facts-about-g_b_5869564.html|title=20 Facts Everyone Should Know About Gender Bias in Movies|last=Chemaly|first=Soraya|date=2014-09-24|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, one of the major storylines in the film industry (the romantic comedy), consistently follows traditional female roles, relegating women to simply searching for a male partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/14/romantic-comedies-failing-women_n_7026302.html|title=How Romantic Comedies Are Failing Women (And How To Fix It)|last=Karlin|first=Lily|date=2015-04-14|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender imbalance==
The gender imbalance between men and women can be found all over, even on Wikipedia. The page: [[list of comedians]] show a much higher number of males than females.

===In pay===
In the [[United States]], there is a large gender gap between men and women in comedy with regards to both pay and number.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ozy.com/acumen/stand-ups-gender-gap/4661|title=It's Really No Joke|last=Humphries|first=Will|work=OZY|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, all ten of the top ten paid comedians were male, bringing in a total of $173 million.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In 2016, one female entered the list: [[Amy Schumer]], at number two.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etcanada.com/photos/170240/forbes-list-of-highest-paid-comedians-for-2016/#image-170249|title=Forbes’ List Of Highest-Paid Comedians For 2016|last=Crisp|first=Gavin|website=etcanada.com|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In appearances===
A study in 2017 found a large gender imbalance in UK comedic panel shows, with only 31% of the appearances. However, the same study also found marked improvement since 1989, when the statistic was 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://strudel.org.uk/panelshows/index.html|title=UK Panel Show Gender Breakdown|website=strudel.org.uk|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the UK industry website Chortle lists 269 female comedian as compared to 1,279 male comedians.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Imbalance can also be seen at the level of the comedy club. For example, the prestigious New York comedy club [[Carolines on Broadway|Carolines]] featured 20% female performers to 80% male in 2014.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Within the writers room, gender imbalance persists. Women made up only 10 percent of writers working on the top 250 domestic grossing films of 2010 and 15 percent of writers and 18 percent of creators in prime-time television during the 2010–2011 season.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In South Korea, of 70 comedic variety shows, 13 had all male hosts and guests, and 23 with all male hosts, meaning that more than half of these shows lack female hosts.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Only two shows had all females hosts and guests.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Shows without hosts often try to model marriages by pairing up male and female celebrities.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; While this does achieve some sense of gender balance, it uses very traditional roles.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==Gendering of humor==
The early female figures in stand up, such as [[Phyllis Diller]], were able to enter the mainstream through their willingness to self-deprecate and declare themselves ugly. Other early female comediennes, such as [[Mae West]] and [[Helen Kane]], used [[sex appeal]] to attract male audiences. In other words, they were able to enter, but on the terms of male comedians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Queens of comedy: Lucille Ball, Phyllis Diller, Carol Burnett, Joan Rivers, and the new generation of funny women|last=Horowitz|first=Susan|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More modern female comedians cite a need to tailor their comedy to what men would find to be funny, with change in this mentality only coming very recently.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

===In stand-up===
[[Stand-up comedy|Stand up comedy]], in particular, is described as a masculine art form.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.makers.com/documentary/womenincomedy|title=Women in Comedy|access-date=2017-02-25|language=en|newspaper=MAKERS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words that are used to describe success are often violent, such as ''killed'' or ''annihilated.''&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The performer must take charge of the stage, claiming it as their own via the phallic symbol of the microphone.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The structure of joke is often centered on an attack on another party. The aggression that such an art form necessitates is encouraged in males but discouraged in females.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karen|first=Stoddard|year=1977|title="WOMEN HAVE NO SENSE OF HUMOR" AND OTHER MYTHS: A CONSIDERATION OF FEMALE STAND-UP COMICS, 1960–1976|journal=American Humor|volume=4|pages=|jstor=42594582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination against women==
In many societies around the world, a woman's role has affected her flexibility in comedy.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caliskan|first=Sevda|date=1995-01-01|title=Is There Such a Thing as Women's Humor?|journal=American Studies International|volume=33|issue=2|pages=49–59|jstor=41279344}}&lt;/ref&gt; In countries that historically view women as inferior to men, comedy is seen as a masculine discipline.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The common perception that women aren't funny pervades all aspects of comedy, including stand-up, television, and movies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The comedy establishment, influenced by patriarchal society, has relegated women to the "side of tears and loss." Systematic sexism can be found at the level of audience members, bookers, agents, and male comics.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2015/10/discrimination-female-comedians/|title=The unfunny things that happen to funny women|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a powerful social tool, comedy brings women outside of the traditional role that has been defined as theirs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Women have experience everything from [[Heckler|heckling]] audience members calling them gendered terms like bitches or sluts, to being invited to fake comedic festivals (so the organizer could have sex with the female comedian), to being introduced in roasts as the girl that "slept with one of the judges."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Feminist tool==
Humor has been used a tool of feminism both for its ability to point out patriarchy and the structures it creates as well as identify the common female experience.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bing|first=Janet|year=2004|title=Is Feminist Humor an Oxymoron?|url=http://digitalcommons.odu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=english_fac_pubs|journal=Women and Language|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction must be made between female humor and feminist humor. Female humor is self-deprecatory, turning inwards to the performer herself.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Feminist humor, by contrast, looks outwards at the societal structures that demean women. It is aggressive and pointed, using comedic language formerly reserved for men only as a tool of liberation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Feminist humor is to be an agent of change for women by drawing attention to their lowered position in society.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knobloch|first=Susan|date=1996-01-01|title=Review of The Unruly Woman: Gender and the Genres of Laughter|journal=Film Quarterly|volume=50|issue=2|pages=58–60|doi=10.2307/1213431|jstor=1213431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Bing argues that for feminist humor to be most effective at its goal of change, it should be inclusive, rather than divisive.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Divisive humor, or jokes that focus on male structures or male-bashing, do not advance feminism, but rather continue to marginalize females.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Inclusive humor that riffs off of the shared experience of women, can be subversive without the negative effects of divisive humor.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Bing continues to say that when humor falls into this inclusive comedy it contributes to feminism by first, contradicting the age old stereotype that women cannot be funny, and second, by undermining the status quo.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Humor itself can be used to make strong structural changes in a society. Many times humor has been used to subvert hierarchical structures. For example, the [[Guerrilla Girls]] used humor to point out the patriarchal, unchanging nature of the Tony awards, which give the majority of their prizes to men.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It also functions to establish an in-group (those making and understanding the joke) and an out-group (those on the receiving end).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Through this process, humor can create solidarity within a group, but can also make another feel excluded.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For women, this can serve to strengthen them as a community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Representation worldwide==

===Bangladesh===
Outside of the United States, women have been having similar experiences in their attempts to enter field of comedy, colored by their own cultural influences. One such women is [[Farhana Muna]], a Bangladeshi Muslim comic.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Her material is focused on Bangladeshi life and culture, from parties to relatives commenting on weight loss. According to Muna, she often feels constrained by what is deemed appropriate or not for a Bangladeshi Muslim women. She must watch what she says and wears. Muna reemphasized the sentiment that there is a wider range of comedy acceptable for men. She has also faced criticism for her actions, including her choice to not wear the [[hijab]], with people calling her a bad Muslim. However, she continues her comedic work due to the community of women that she has met through it. Muna sees comedy as a collective platform of expression, a way to share her experiences in a relatable way.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anushay-hossain/becoming-munatic-how-a-ba_b_9283354.html|title=Becoming Munatic: How a Bangladeshi Woman is Changing the Rules of Comedy Online|last=Hossain|first=Anushay|date=2016-02-22|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Women have been on the rise in India's comedy as recently as 2016. In a country that has deeply entrenched patriarchal values, these female comedians face great amounts of cultural animosity.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scoopwhoop.com/Female-Stand-Up-Comedians-India/#.n0ztf1urd|title=These Female Comedians Are Taking The Stand-Up Industry By Storm, One Joke At A Time|last=ScoopWhoop|date=2016-04-22|work=ScoopWhoop|access-date=2017-04-07|language=En}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this discrimination women such as [[Aditi Mittal]] and [[Neeti Palta]] have found success in an industry that did not readily accept them.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

===South Korea===
In [[South Korea]], female comedians do not encounter many comedic opportunities.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/asia/korean-tv-gender-imbalance-1202019919/|title=Korean TV’s Gender Imbalance No Laughing Matter|last=Kil|first=Sonia|date=2017-04-03|work=Variety|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two television programs are completely hosted by females, with the other major television opportunity being couples shows. South Korean TV shows only offer gender balance when women are in gendered roles.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Producers see men as more advantageous hires as the shows' audiences are majority women. Additionally, there was a worry that audiences would react badly to strong women in television.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; As the woman's movement grows in South Korea, so too do the opportunities for women. Rather than featuring beautiful women as prizes to be won by males contestants, new shows such as ''[[Sister's Slam Dunk|Sisters' Slam Dunk]]'' (which premiered in 2016) feature women working together to solve problems.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==Figures==
=== Phyllis Diller ===
One of the most prominent early figures in American female comedy, [[Phyllis Diller]] made her comedic debut at the Purple Onion Comedy Club in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/phyllis-diller-9542308#breakthrough-role|title=Phyllis Diller|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her stand-up routines focused on the problems of the suburban [[housewife]], a previous unaddressed area by male comics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By opening acknowledging her lack of physical attractiveness and by incorporating self-deprecation into her routines, Diller was able to enter comedy in a time when funny and attractive women were seen as threatening.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, by confining her comedy to her inability to fulfill her traditional role, she reinforced female stereotypes rather than dismissing them.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Joan Rivers===
[[Joan Rivers]] (active from 1959–2014) was one of the first female comedians to utilize the "talk/conversational" method, one that was suited to television talk shows.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike [[Phyllis Diller]], who was quite unlike her comedic personality, the comedy of Joan Rivers more closely reflected her personality. She often drew on her own personal experiences as a self-proclaimed Jewish princess.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike her predecessors, Rivers did not downplay her attractiveness, but rather incorporated it into her riffs on life as a single woman.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Still, her comedy was focused on the traditional problems of a women (trying to find a boyfriend and husband, being a good wife etc).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Figures such as [[Tina Fey]] have paved the way in the modern era for large-scale growth in female comedy.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauzen|first=Martha|date=2014-01-02|title=The Funny Business of Being Tina Fey: Constructing a (feminist) comedy |journal=Feminist Media Studies| volume=14|issue=1|pages=106–117|doi=10.1080/14680777.2012.740060|issn=1468-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her public appointment as the first female head writer of [[Saturday Night Live]] placed her in a position to serve as a feminist comedy icon.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Many of her sketches became iconic, particularly her satirical portrayal of Vice Presidential Candidate [[Sarah Palin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flowers|first=Arhlene A.|last2=Young|first2=Cory L.|date=2010-01-01|title=Parodying Palin: How Tina Fey’s Visual and Verbal Impersonations Revived a Comedy Show and Impacted the 2008 Election|journal=Journal of Visual Literacy|volume=29|issue=1|pages=47–67|doi=10.1080/23796529.2010.11674673|issn=1051-144X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her comedic writing ([[Mean Girls]], [[30 Rock]], [[Bossypants]], [[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]], Date Night etc...), in addition to achieving great public notice, was well received by critics.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Miranda Hart===
[[Miranda Hart]] is a female comedian from the UK. She is most well-known for her television series ''[[Miranda (TV series)|Miranda]].''
