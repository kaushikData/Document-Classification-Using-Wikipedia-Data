'''''Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities''''' is a British-based international [[academic journal]] founded in 1993 that "represents the productive nexus of work in the disciplinary fields of literary criticism and theory, philosophy, and cultural studies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angelaki: journal of the theoretical humanities|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=cang20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1998, it has been published by [[Routledge]], an imprint of the [[Taylor &amp; Francis Group]]. In 1996, while it was still an independent publication, the journal was named "Best New Journal" in the annual awards of the [[Council of Editors of Learned Journals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CELJ Winners |url=https://thecouncilofeditorsoflearnedjournals.wildapricot.org/winners}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal is [[abstracting and indexing|abstracted and indexed]] in [[Scopus]],&lt;ref name=Scopus&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elsevier.com/online-tools/scopus/content-overview |title=Content overview |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |work=Scopus |accessdate=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Current Contents]]/Arts &amp; Humanities, and [[Arts and Humanities Citation Index]],&lt;ref name=ISI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ip-science.thomsonreuters.com/mjl/ |title=Master Journal List |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |work=Intellectual Property &amp; Science |accessdate=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journal Information, Angelaki|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?journalCode=cang20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

From 1993 until 2010 the journal published three issues a year. This was increased to four issues a year in 2011. In 2018, the journal's 25th-anniversary year, the frequency was further increased to six issues per volume, a volume normally comprising four special issues and two general (nontheme) issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journal Information, Angelaki|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?journalCode=cang20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special issues of the journal are frequently republished by Routledge as books. In 1996 editors of the journal established an associated book series, Angelaki Humanities, with Manchester University Press.

'''Antonie Philips van Leeuwenhoek'''{{#tag:ref|The spelling of van Leeuwenhoek's name is exceptionally varied. He was christened as ''Thonis'', but always went by ''Antonj'' (corresponding with the English ''Antony''). The final ''j'' of his given name is the Dutch tense ''i''. Until 1683 he consistently used the spelling ''Antonj Leeuwenhoeck'' (ending in ''–oeck'') when signing his letters. Throughout the mid-1680s he experimented with the spelling of his surname, and after 1685 settled on the most recognized spelling, ''van Leeuwenhoek''.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 300–305.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|n|t|ə|n|i|_|v|ɑː|n|_|ˈ|l|eɪ|v|ən|h|ʊ|k}} {{respell|AHN|tə|nee|_|vahn|_|LAY|vən|huuk}}, {{IPA-nl|ɑnˈtoːni vɑn ˈleːuə(n)ˌɦuk| lang| Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek.ogg}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= How to pronounce Anton van Leeuvenhoek |url= https://www.howtopronounce.com/anton-van-leeuwenhoek |website= howtopronounce.com |date= 2018 |accessdate= 2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 24 October 1632 – 26 August 1723) was a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] [[businessman]] and [[scientist]] in the [[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age of Dutch science and technology]].

Raised in [[Delft]], [[Dutch Republic]], van Leeuwenhoek worked as a [[draper]] in his youth and founded his own shop in 1654. He became well recognized in municipal politics and developed an interest in lensmaking. In the 1670s, he started to explore [[microbial life]]  with his microscope.{{#tag:ref|Note that the existence of [[microscopic organism]]s (microbes, microorganisms) was predicted or hypothesized many centuries before they were first observed by van Leeuwenhoek.|group="note"}} This was one of the notable achievements of the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (c. 1590s–1720s).

Using single-lensed microscopes of his own design, van Leeuwenhoek was the first to experiment with [[microbes]], which he originally referred to as ''[[animalcules]]'' (from Latin ''animalculum'' = "tiny animal"). Through his experiments, he was the first to relatively determine their size. Most of the "animalcules" are now referred to as [[unicellular organism]]s, although he observed multicellular organisms in pond water. He was also the first to document [[microscopic scale|microscopic observations]] of [[muscle]] fibers, [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]], [[red blood cell]]s, [[crystal]]s in [[gouty tophus|gouty tophi]], and [[blood]] flow in [[capillary|capillaries]]. Although van Leeuwenhoek did not write any books, his discoveries came to light through correspondence with the [[Royal Society]], which published his letters.

==Early life and career==
[[File:Antony van Leeuwenhoek and his "Little animals"; being some account of the father of protozoology and bacteriology and his multifarious discoveries in these disciplines; (1932) (19122164704).jpg|thumb|van Leeuwenhoek's birth house in Delft, in the Netherlands, in 1926 before it was demolished]]

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was born in [[Delft]], [[Dutch Republic]], on 24 October 1632. On 4 November, he was baptized as ''Thonis''. His father, Philips Antonisz van Leeuwenhoek, was a basket maker who died when Antonie was only five years old. His mother, Margaretha (Bel van den Berch), came from a well-to-do brewer's family. She remarried Jacob Jansz Molijn, a painter. Antonie had four older sisters: Margriet, Geertruyt, Neeltje, and Catharina.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was around ten years old his step-father died. He attended school in [[Warmond]] for a short time before being sent to live in [[Benthuizen]] with his uncle, an attorney. &lt;!--and town clerk. Benthuizen was not a town, but a village. --&gt; At the age of 16 he became a bookkeeper's apprentice at a linen-draper's shop in Amsterdam,&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; which was owned by the Scot [[William Davidson of Curriehill|William Davidson]]. Van Leeuwenhoek left there after six years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lensonleeuwenhoek.net/biography.htm The curious observer. Events of the first half of van Leeuwenhoek's life]. Lens on Leeuwenhoek (1 September 2009). Retrieved 20 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huerta, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Leeuwenhoek married Barbara de Mey in July 1654, with whom he fathered one surviving daughter, Maria (four other children died in infancy). That same year he returned to Delft, where he would live and study for the rest of his life. He opened a draper's shop, which he ran throughout the 1650s. His wife died in 1666, and in 1671, Van Leeuwenhoek remarried to Cornelia Swalmius with whom he had no children.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 27–31.&lt;/ref&gt; His status in Delft had grown throughout the years. In 1660 he received a lucrative job as [[chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] for the assembly chamber of the Delft [[schepen|sheriffs]] in the [[City Hall (Delft)|city hall]], a position which he would hold for almost 40 years. In 1669 he was appointed as a [[land surveyor]] by the court of [[Holland]]; at some time he combined it with another municipal job, being the official "wine-gauger" of Delft and in charge of the city wine imports and taxation.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 33–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:The Geographer.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting of man with scroll and compass, standing by sunlit window|''[[The Geographer]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]]]]

Van Leeuwenhoek was a contemporary of another famous Delft citizen, the painter [[Johannes Vermeer]], who was baptized just four days earlier. It has been suggested that he is the man portrayed in two Vermeer paintings of the late 1660s, ''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'' and ''[[The Geographer]]'', but others argue that there appears to be little physical similarity. Because they were both relatively important men in a city with only 24,000 inhabitants, it is likely that they were at least acquaintances; Van Leeuwenhoek acted as the [[executor]] of Vermeer's will after the painter died in 1675.&lt;ref&gt;Van Berkel, K. (24 February 1996). ''Vermeer, Van Leeuwenhoek en De Astronoom''. Vrij Nederland (Dutch magazine), p. 62–67.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|In ''[[A Short History of Nearly Everything]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;236) [[Bill Bryson]] alludes to rumors that Vermeer's mastery of light and perspective came from use of a [[camera obscura]] produced by Van Leeuwenhoek. This is one of the examples of the controversial [[Hockney–Falco thesis]], which claims that some of the [[Old Master]]s used optical aids to produce their masterpieces.|group="note"}}

==Microscopic study==
{{See also|Microscopic discovery of microorganisms}}
While running his draper shop, van Leeuwenhoek wanted to see the quality of the thread better than what was possible using the magnifying lenses of the time. He developed an interest in lensmaking, although few records exist of his early activity. Van Leeuwenhoek's interest in microscopes and a familiarity with glass processing led to one of the most significant, and simultaneously well-hidden, technical insights in the history of science.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

By placing the middle of a small rod of soda lime glass in a hot flame, van Leeuwenhoek could pull the hot section apart to create two long whiskers of glass. Then, by reinserting the end of one whisker into the flame, he could create a very small, high-quality glass sphere. These spheres became the lenses of his microscopes, with the smallest spheres providing the highest magnifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history-of-the-microscope.org/anton-van-leeuwenhoek-microscope-history.php|title=Anton van Leeuwenhoek – History of the compound microscope|last=|first=|date=|website=www.history-of-the-microscope.org|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After developing his method for creating powerful lenses and applying them to the study of the microscopic world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://atena.beic.it/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=13349171&amp;search_terms=DTL184|title=Observationes microscopicae Antonii Lewenhoeck, circa particulas liquorum globosa et animalia|last=|first=|work=Acta Eruditorum|publisher=|year=1682|isbn=|location=Leipzig|pages=321}}&lt;/ref&gt;, van Leeuwenhoek introduced his work to his friend, the prominent Dutch physician [[Reinier de Graaf]]. When the [[Royal Society]] in London published the groundbreaking work of an Italian lensmaker in their journal ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', de Graaf wrote to the editor of the journal, [[Henry Oldenburg]], with a ringing endorsement of van Leeuwenhoek's microscopes which, he claimed, "far surpass those which we have hitherto seen". In response, in 1673 the society published a letter from van Leeuwenhoek that included his microscopic observations on mold, bees, and lice.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 37–41.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Antoni van Leeuwenhoek letters to the Royal Society 3.jpg|thumb|alt=Page in a handwritten manuscript volume|A 1677 letter from van Leeuwenhoek to Oldenburg, with the latter's English translation behind, the full correspondence remains in the [[Royal Society]] Library]]

Van Leeuwenhoek's work fully captured the attention of the Royal Society, and he began corresponding regularly with the society regarding his observations. At first he had been reluctant to publicize his findings, regarding himself as a businessman with little scientific, artistic, or writing background, but de Graaf urged him to be more confident in his work.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time van Leeuwenhoek died in 1723, he had written some 190 letters to the Royal Society, detailing his findings in a wide variety of fields, centered on his work in microscopy. He only wrote letters in his own colloquial Dutch; he never published a proper scientific paper in Latin. He strongly preferred to work alone, distrusting the sincerity of those who offered their assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The letters were translated into Latin or English by Henry Oldenburg, who had learned Dutch for this very purpose. Despite the initial success of van Leeuwenhoek's relationship with the Royal Society, soon relations became severely strained. In 1676, his credibility was questioned when he sent the Royal Society a copy of his first observations of microscopic single-celled organisms. Previously, the existence of single-celled organisms was entirely unknown. Thus, even with his established reputation with the Royal Society as a reliable observer, his observations of microscopic life were initially met with some skepticism.&lt;ref name="NickLane_RS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/370/1666/20140344 |authorlink=Nick Lane |last=Lane |first=Nick |title=The Unseen World: Reflections on Leeuwenhoek (1677) 'Concerning Little Animal' |publisher=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci 2015 Apr 19; 370(1666) |date=6 Mar 2015 |accessdate=16 Jan 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, in the face of van Leeuwenhoek's insistence, the Royal Society arranged for Alexander Petrie, minister to the English Reformed Church in Delft; Benedict Haan, at that time Lutheran minister at Delft; and Henrik Cordes, then Lutheran minister at the Hague, accompanied by [[Sir Robert Gordon, 3rd Baronet|Sir Robert Gordon]] and four others, to determine whether it was in fact van Leeuwenhoek's ability to observe and reason clearly, or perhaps, the Royal Society's theories of life that might require reform.

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was elected to the Royal Society in February 1680 on the nomination of [[William Croone]], a then-prominent physician.{{#tag:ref|He was also nominated as a "corresponding member" of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1699, but there is no evidence that the nomination was accepted, nor that he was ever aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} Van Leeuwenhoek was "taken aback" by the nomination, which he considered a high honor, although he did not attend the induction ceremony in London, nor did he ever attend a Royal Society meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 46–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific fame===
By the end of the seventeenth century, van Leeuwenhoek had a virtual monopoly on microscopic study and discovery. His contemporary [[Robert Hooke]], an early microscope pioneer, bemoaned that the field had come to rest entirely on one man's shoulders.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; He was visited over the years by many notable individuals, such as the Russian Tsar [[Peter the Great]]. To the disappointment of his guests, van Leeuwenhoek refused to reveal the cutting-edge microscopes he relied on for his discoveries, instead showing visitors a collection of average-quality lenses.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 54–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

An experienced businessman, van Leeuwenhoek believed that if his simple method for creating the critically important lens was revealed, the scientific community of his time would likely disregard or even forget his role in microscopy. He therefore allowed others to believe that he was laboriously spending most of his nights and free time grinding increasingly tiny lenses to use in microscopes, even though this belief conflicted both with his construction of hundreds of microscopes and his habit of building a new microscope whenever he chanced upon an interesting specimen that he wanted to preserve. He made about 200 microscopes with a different magnification.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Van Leeuwenhoek was visited by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[William III of England|William III of Orange]] and his wife, [[Mary II of England]], and the burgemeester (mayor) [[Joan Huydecoper II|Johan Huydecoper]] of Amsterdam, the latter being very interested in collecting and growing plants for the [[Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam]], and all gazed at the ''tiny creatures''. In 1698, van Leeuwenhoek was invited to visit the Tsar [[Peter the Great]] on his boat. On this occasion van Leeuwenhoek presented the Tsar an "eel-viewer", so Peter could study blood circulation whenever he wanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Bill |last1=Mesler |first2=H.

==Techniques and discoveries==
[[File:Van Leeuwenhoek's microscopes by Henry Baker.jpg|thumb|alt=Schematic drawings|van Leeuwenhoek's microscopes by [[Henry Baker (naturalist)|Henry Baker]]]]

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek made more than 500 optical lenses. He also created at least 25 single-lens microscopes, of differing types, of which only nine have survived. These microscopes were made of silver or copper frames, holding hand-made lenses. Those that have survived are capable of magnification up to 275 times. It is suspected that van Leeuwenhoek possessed some microscopes that could magnify up to 500 times. Although he has been widely regarded as a dilettante or amateur, his scientific research was of remarkably high quality.&lt;ref name="BrianJFord_1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brian J. Ford|date=1992 |title=From Dilettante to Diligent Experimenter: a Reappraisal of Leeuwenhoek as microscopist and investigator |journal=Biology History |volume= 5 |issue=3 |url= http://www.brianjford.com/a-avl01.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The single-lens microscopes of van Leeuwenhoek were relatively small devices, the largest being about 5&amp;nbsp;cm long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Anderson |first1=Douglas|title=Tiny Microscopes |url= http://lensonleeuwenhoek.net/content/tiny-microscopes |website=Lens on Leeuwenhoek |accessdate=3 March 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095106/http://lensonleeuwenhoek.net/content/tiny-microscopes |archivedate= 2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lens on Leeuwenhoek: [http://lensonleeuwenhoek.net/microscopes.htm How he made his tiny microscopes]. Lensonleeuwenhoek.net. Retrieved 15 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; They are used by placing the lens very close in front of the eye, while looking in the direction of the sun. The other side of the microscope had a pin, where the sample was attached in order to stay close to the lens. There were also three screws to move the pin and the sample along three axes: one axis to change the focus, and the two other axes to navigate through the sample.

Van Leeuwenhoek maintained throughout his life that there are aspects of microscope construction "''which I only keep for myself''", in particular his most critical secret of how he made the lenses. For many years no-one was able to reconstruct van Leeuwenhoek's design techniques, however, in 1957, C.L. Stong used thin glass thread fusing instead of polishing, and successfully created some working samples of a van Leeuwenhoek design microscope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.funsci.com/fun3_en/usph/usph.htm |title=A glass-sphere microscope |publisher=Funsci.com |accessdate=13 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611200259/http://www.funsci.com/fun3_en/usph/usph.htm |archivedate=11 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a method was also discovered independently by A.

By the end of his life, van Leeuwenhoek had written approximately 560 letters to the Royal Society and other scientific institutions concerning his observations and discoveries. Even during the last weeks of his life, van Leeuwenhoek continued to send letters full of observations to London. The last few contained a precise description of his own illness. He suffered from a rare disease, an uncontrolled movement of the [[midriff]], which now is named ''[[van Leeuwenhoek's disease]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Life and work of Antoni van Leeuwenhoek of Delft in Holland; 1632–1723 (1980) Published by the Municipal Archives Delft, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; He died at the age of 90, on 26 August 1723, and was buried four days later in the [[Oude Kerk (Delft)|Oude Kerk]] in Delft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Antoni |last=van Leeuwenhoek |title=On the circulation of the blood: Latin text of his 65th letter to the Royal Society, Sept. 7th, 1688 |year=1962 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill Hes &amp; De Graaf]] |page=28 |isbn=9789060040980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, the British microscopist [[Brian J. Ford]] found that van Leeuwenhoek's original specimens had survived in the collections of the Royal Society of London.

He constructed rational and repeatable experimental procedures and was willing to oppose received opinion, such as [[spontaneous generation]], and he changed his mind in the light of evidence.&lt;ref name="BrianJFord_1992"/&gt;''

On his importance in the history of microbiology and science in general, the British biochemist [[Nick Lane]] wrote that he was "the first even to think of looking—certainly, the first with the power to see." His experiments were ingenious and he was "a scientist of the highest calibre", attacked by people who envied him or "scorned his unschooled origins", not helped by his secrecy about his methods.&lt;ref name="NickLane_RS"/&gt;

A '''baccalaureate service''' (or, '''baccalaureate [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]]''' in the case of institutions affiliated with the [[Catholic Church]] and its [[religious institute]]s) is a celebration that honors a graduating senior class from a [[college]] or [[high school]] or [[eighth grade]]. The event is typically a [[Christianity]]-based [[interdenominational]] service, though it may also be of a strictly Catholic nature.

The service is held within a few days of the [[graduation]] and/or commencement ceremony, perhaps on the Sunday before, the day preceding, or immediately preceding the graduation. Speakers selected tend to be community leaders, faculty members, students, or local religious leaders, and may be elected by the graduating class. Speeches are often intermixed with musical performances, drama, and worship. A modern day '''Baccalaureate addresses''' generally lasts less than half an hour. In ancient times they could last as long as four hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.swarthmore.edu/past-commencements/baccalaureate-address-mark-wallace|title=Baccalaureate Address: Mark Wallace|last=|first=|date=May 2010|website=Swarthmore College|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

A claim much repeated is that "the baccalaureate service is believed to have originated at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1432 when each bachelor was required to deliver a [[sermon]] in [[Latin]] as part of his academic requirements."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://commencement.columbia.edu/baccalaureate-service|title=Baccalaureate Service|last=|first=|date=May 2018|website=Columbia University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it was "examinatory sermons" that were required of all Oxford bachelors before their "inception" or commencement; these were mentioned in a 1311 statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medieval Education|last=Ronald B. Begley &amp; Joseph W. Koterski, eds.|first=|publisher=Fordham Univ. Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=85-86}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The American '''baccalaureate service''' is an outgrowth of the bacclaureate sermon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://commencement.wfu.edu/general-faqs/baccalaureate-ceremony-faqs/|title=Baccalaureate Ceremony FAQs|last=|first=|date=May 2018|website=Wake Forest University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dickinson.edu/info/20054/leadership/3170/about_the_ceremonies/1|title=Baccalaureate Ceremony|last=|first=|date=May 2018|website=Dickinson College|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known in America is at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1760. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.princeton.edu/mudd/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2013/05/AC115B1F1_TheLastSermon.pdf|title=The Last Sermon|last=Sack|first=Daniel|date=1993|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of [[United States Supreme Court]] rulings{{Specify|date=May 2011}} regarding the [[separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]], baccalaureate services are not official, school-sponsored events at [[United States|American]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.org/faq/state-church/item/14024-school-involvement-in-baccalaureate-services|title=School Involvement in Baccalaureate Services - Freedom From Religion Foundation|work=ffrf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many have student-initiated services at private facilities not paid for with government funds, and as such are fully permitted by law. Until recent years{{Specify|date=June 2016}}, school-sponsored baccalaureate services were common in American public schools, on school grounds{{citation needed|reason='Common' is a weasel-word|date=June 2016}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6463">[[File:Dalija..jpg|thumb|BiArtis handbag model Dalija.]]'''BiArtis''' is the first brand in the world that made unique luxury [[handbag]]s  made in leather with originally sewn [[oil on canvas]]. The name BiArtis comes from a Greek-Latin word that means "double art".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/scena/mozaik/clanak/id/243778/luksuzni-unikati-kliska-damska-torba-od-12-tisuca-kuna-krece-u-osvajanje-svijeta|title=Luksuzni unikati: kliška damska torba od 12 tisuća kuna kreće u osvajanje svijeta|website=Slobodna Dalmacija|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This bags are designed to be inherited as a permanent value, as it is not just a utilitarian object and attractive fashion accessories but also a work of [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lions.hr/biznis/biartis|title=BIARTIS {{!}} Lions Hrvatska|website=lions.hr|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All artists working for BiArtis are acknowledged academic painters. Each bag is followed by a handmade painted silk scarf by the same author with fragments of painting which are sewn in to the purse.

Prices for these bags range from €1000 to 2500. Costs escalate according to the motifs on a painting sewn onto it. Discounts are not given for as the painting gets older the bag gains more value as a peace of art.

== History ==
[[File:Creator Elizabeth Suzana Kozina..jpg|thumb|The creator and inventor Elizabeth Suzana Kozina, on the left, with one of her bags.]]
The creator and inventor of BiArtis bags, Elizabeth Suzana Kozina, as every woman is crazy for shoes and bags. In the end of 2012, she wanted to put art work on something else than walls, so she thought: I can put painting on a bag.

In the beginning of 2013, she draw her dream on paper and she ordered oil on canvas from a painter and went to a factory for them to sew it into a bag prototype.

But, what they did was not good, so she wanted another one but it wasn't good either. So the factory said it could not be done. You can't sew oil on canvas on a bag, and she literally was kicked out of factory.  In the meantime, she found out about another factory, 5 minutes away from last one, she showed the ruined bag to an owner and asked: "Can you do better than this?". He replied: "Not only I can but I WILL", and that is how BiArtis bag was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wow.hr/vijesti/399308/luksuzne-torbe-s-klisa-za-12-ti|title=WOW.HR - Hrvatska društvena mreža|last=WOW.HR|website=wow.hr|language=hr|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First publicly shown BiArtis bag, that satisfied the inventor's criteria, was introduced in May 2015.

== Design ==
*[[File:BiArtis handbag models Diana and Dalga..jpg|thumb|BiArtis handbag models Diana and Dalga.]]BiArtis bags are sold in 5 different models: Dalia, Talija, Diana, Dalga and Cygnus. Each one may be made to order with different customer-chosen motifs and in one of seven available [[leather]] colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/stil/moda/clanak/id/285774/luksuzne-torbe-s-klisa-za-12-tisuca-kuna-dobijete-i-certifikat-o-jedinstvenosti|title=Luksuzne torbe s Klisa: za 12 tisuća kuna dobijete i certifikat o jedinstvenosti|website=Slobodna Dalmacija|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://extravagant.com.hr/article/988/like-dana:-biartis-torbe|title=Extravagant - prvi riječki modni portal - Like dana: Biartis torbe|website=extravagant.com.hr|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Each bag comes with painted [[silk]] scarf and the painting uniqueness certificate with a special generated number to protect it against copying and stealing.
* No serigraph and printing.
* Any painting from a purse can also be ordered in XXL format, but then contract needs to be signed to agree that painting is not only one in the world since one already exists on the bag but in a smaller format.

== Craftsmanship ==
[[File:BiArtis handbag model Dalga..jpg|thumb|BiArtis handbag model Dalga.]]
The bags are handmade in [[Croatia]]. First blueprint is made, then academic painter paints a painting and a scarf .The painting needs 20 days to dry. Next thing is choosing model and color for the bag. Painting then is taken to a factory where sawing painting and bag is handmade at same time and it is done with gloves, because painting is applied in bag, not on it.  Then, completed bag is taken to photographer to take photo after which certificate of uniqueness is made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sd.live.sistemi.hr/stil/moda/clanak/id/306394/unikatne-torbe-s-klisa-idu-na-sajam-luksuza-u-moskvu|title=Unikatne torbe s Klisa idu na sajam luksuza u Moskvu|website=Slobodna Dalmacija|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bag and certificate is put in exclusive satin bag and than in exclusive white box  with declarations.
[[File:Cosmo HR.jpg|thumb|BiArtis handbags featured in Croatian edition of Cosmopolitan magazine]]
Time needed for one bag to be done is two months.

== Demands ==
[[File:The Museum of Bags and Purses.jpg|thumb|BiArtis bag in front of The Museum of Bags and Purses]]
The rarity of these bags are purportedly designed to increase demand by collectors of art for as the painting gets older the bag gains more value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://magazin.hrt.hr/322801/luksuzne-hrvatske-torbice-koje-su-osvojile-svjetske-metropole|title=Luksuzne hrvatske torbice koje su osvojile svjetske metropole|website=Hrvatska radiotelevizija|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the result, BiArtis bag is currently in The Museum of Bags and Purses (Dutch: [[Museum of Bags and Purses|Tassenmuseum Hendrikje]]), located in [[Amsterdam]], The Netherlands. It is a museum devoted to historic [[handbag]]s, [[Handbag|purses]] and [[suitcase]]s. The museum's collection includes 4,000 items dating back to the 16th century and a BiArtis bag is among them.

A BiArtis bag is also presented to buyers on a delivered BiArtis pad and with white BiArtis gloves.

With each passing day, BiArtis brand is more and more recognized, both in fashion and business life circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lider.media/aktualno/tvrtke-i-trzista/poduzetnici/elizabeth-suzana-kozina-poduzetnica-koja-torbom-osvaja-svijet/|title=Elizabeth Suzana Kozina, poduzetnica koja torbom osvaja svijet - Lider Media|date=2016-07-08|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of the Middle East''', numbering some 330,000 works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/middle_east/research.aspx|title=British Museum – Research| work=britishmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; forms a significant part of the collections of the [[British Museum]], and the world's largest collection of [[Mesopotamia]]n antiquities outside [[Iraq]]. The collections represent the civilisations of the ancient Near East and its adjacent areas.

These cover [[Mesopotamia]], [[Iran|Persia]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Anatolia]], the [[Caucasus]], parts of Central Asia, [[Syria]], the [[Holy Land]] and [[Phoenicia]]n settlements in the western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] from the [[Prehistory|prehistoric period]] and include objects from the beginning of [[Islam]] in the 7th century. A collection of immense importance, the holdings of [[Assyria]]n, [[Babylonia]]n and [[Sumeria]]n antiquities are among the most comprehensive in the world with entire suites of rooms panelled in alabaster bas-reliefs from Assyrian palaces at [[Nimrud]], [[Nineveh]] and [[Khorsabad]].  Only the Middle East collections of the [[Louvre]] and the [[Pergamon Museum]] rival it in the range and quality of artefacts.

==History==

The first significant addition of [[Mesopotamian]] objects was from the collection of [[Claudius James Rich]] in 1825. The collection was later dramatically enlarged by the excavations of [[Austen Henry Layard|A. H. Layard]] at the [[Assyria]]n sites of [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]] between 1845 and 1851. At Nimrud, Layard discovered the North-West Palace of [[Ashurnasirpal II]], as well as three other palaces and various temples. He later uncovered the Palace of [[Sennacherib]] at Nineveh with 'no less than seventy-one halls'. As a result, a large numbers of [[Lamassu]]'s, bas-reliefs, [[Stele|stelae]], including the [[Black Obelisk]] of [[Shalmaneser III]], were brought to the British Museum.

[[File:London 307.JPG|thumbnail|Room 52 – Ancient Iran with the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], considered to be the world's first charter of [[human rights]], 559–530 BC]]
Layard's work was continued by his assistant, [[Hormuzd Rassam]] and in 1852–1854 he went on to discover the North Palace of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh with many magnificent reliefs, including the famous Royal Lion Hunt scenes. He also discovered the [[Library of Ashurbanipal|Royal Library of Ashurbanipal]], a large collection of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] of enormous importance that today number around 130,000 pieces. [[William Loftus|W. K. Loftus]] excavated in Nimrud between 1850 and 1855 and found a remarkable hoard of [[Nimrud ivories|ivories]] in the Burnt Palace. Between 1878 and 1882 Rassam greatly improved the Museum's holdings with exquisite objects including the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] from [[Babylon]], the bronze gates from [[Balawat]], important objects from [[Sippar]], and a fine collection of [[Urartu|Urartian]] bronzes from [[Toprakkale]].

In the early 20th century excavations were carried out at [[Carchemish]], [[Turkey]] by [[David George Hogarth|D. G. Hogarth]] and [[Leonard Woolley]], the latter assisted by [[T. E. Lawrence]]. The Mesopotamian collections were greatly augmented by excavations in southern [[Iraq]] after the [[First World War]]. From [[Ubaid period|Tell al-Ubaid]] came the bronze furnishings of a [[Sumer]]ian temple, including life-sized lions and a panel featuring the lion-headed eagle Indugud found by [[Henry Hall (Egyptologist)|H. R. Hall]] in 1919–24. Woolley went on to excavate [[Ur]] between 1922 and 1934, discovering the 'Royal Cemeteries' of the 3rd millennium BC. Some of the masterpieces include the '[[Standard of Ur]]', the 'Ram in a Thicket', the '[[Royal Game of Ur]]', and two bull-headed [[lyres]]. The department also has three [[diorite]] statues of the ruler [[Statues of Gudea|Gudea]] from the ancient state of [[Lagash]] and a series of limestone [[kudurru]] or boundary stones from different locations across ancient [[Mesopotamia]].

Although the collections centre on Mesopotamia, most of the surrounding areas are well represented. The [[Achaemenid]] collection was enhanced with the addition of the [[Oxus Treasure]] in 1897 and objects excavated by the German scholar [[Ernst Herzfeld]] and the Hungarian-British explorer [[Marc Aurel Stein|Sir Aurel Stein]]. Reliefs and sculptures from the site of [[Persepolis]] were donated by Sir [[Gore Ouseley]] in 1825 and the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 5th Earl of Aberdeen|5th Earl of Aberdeen]] in 1861. Moreover, the museum has been able to acquire one of the greatest assemblages of Achaemenid [[Household silver|silverware]] in the world. The later [[Sasanian Empire]] is also well represented by ornate silver plates and cups, many representing ruling monarchs hunting lions and deer. Phoenician antiquities come from across the region, but the [[Tharros]] collection from [[Sardinia]] and the large number of Phoenician stelae from [[Carthage]] are outstanding. Another often overlooked highlight is [[Ancient history of Yemen|Yemeni]] antiquities, the finest collection outside that country. Furthermore, the museum has a representative collection of [[Dilmun]] and [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] material excavated from various burial mounds at the ancient sites of [[A'ali]] and [[Shakhura]] in Bahrain.

From the modern state of [[Syria]] come almost forty funerary busts from [[Palmyra]] and a group of stone [[reliefs]] from the excavations of [[Max von Oppenheim]] at [[Tell Halaf]] that was purchased in 1920. More material followed from the excavations of [[Max Mallowan]] at [[Chagar Bazar]] and [[Tell Brak]] in 1935–1938 and from Woolley at [[Alalakh]] in the years just before and after the [[Second World War]]. Mallowan returned with his wife [[Agatha Christie]] to carry out further digs at Nimrud in the postwar period which secured many [[Nimrud Ivories|important artefacts]] for the museum. The collection of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] material was strengthened by the work of [[Kathleen Kenyon]] at [[Jericho]] in the 1950s and the acquisition in 1980 of around 17,000 objects found at [[Lachish]] by the Wellcome-Marston expedition of 1932–1938.  Archaeological digs are still taking place where permitted in the Middle East, and, depending on the country, the museum continues to receive a share of the finds from sites such as [[:de:Tell es-Sa'idiyeh|Tell es Sa'idiyeh]] in Jordan.

==Collections==

The museum's collection of [[Islamic art]], including archaeological material, numbers about 40,000 objects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/pm_partner.php?id=Mus01;uk&amp;type=museum&amp;theme=ISL&amp;|title=Museum With No Frontiers| publisher=Discover Islamic Art| accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the largest of its kind in the world. As such, it contains a broad range of pottery, paintings, tiles, metalwork, glass, seals, and inscriptions from across the Islamic world, from [[Spain]] in the west to [[India]] in the east. It is particularly famous for its collection of [[İznik pottery|Iznik]] ceramics (the largest in the world), a highlight of which is the mosque lamp from the [[Dome of the Rock]], mediaeval metalwork such as the Vaso Vescovali with its depictions of the [[Zodiac]], a fine selection of [[astrolabes]], and Mughal [[Mughal paintings|paintings]] and precious artwork including a large [[Jade Terrapin from Allahabad|jade terrapin]] made for the Emperor [[Jahangir]]. Thousands of objects were excavated after the war by professional archaeologists at Iranian sites such as [[Siraf]] by [[David Whitehouse]] and [[Alamut Castle]] by Peter Willey. The collection was augmented in 1983 by the [[Frederick DuCane Godman|Godman]] bequest of Iznik, [[Hispano-Moresque]] and early Iranian pottery. Artefacts from the Islamic world are on display in Gallery 34 of the museum.

A representative selection from the Department of Middle East, including the most important pieces, are on display in 13 galleries throughout the museum and total some 4,500 objects. A whole suite of rooms on the ground floor display the sculptured reliefs from the Assyrian palaces at Nineveh, Nimrud and Khorsabad, while 8 galleries on the upper floor hold smaller material from ancient sites across the [[Middle East]]. The remainder form the study collection which ranges in size from beads to large sculptures. They include approximately 130,000 [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] from Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/middle_east/history_of_the_collection.aspx |title=History of the Collection: Middle East |work=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cairo Symphony Orchestra''', ({{lang-ar|'''اوركسترا القاهرة السيمفونى'''}}; ''Orkestra el-Qāhera el-Semfōni''), is an orchestra based in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. It was founded in 1959 by its first music director and conductor, [[Franz Litschauer]]. Its current principal conductor is Ahmed El Saedi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cairo-symphony.com/Music%20Director.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Orchestra was founded in 1959 under its first music director and conductor, Franz Litschauer, and from mid-1959 to 1963 it was conducted by the Yugoslavian Serbs Gika Zdravkovitch (1959–1960) and Dushan Miladinovitch (1960–1963) (Serbian: Живојин Здравковић, Živojin Zdravković; Душан Миладиновић, Dušan Miladinović). Two Egyptian conductors, [[Ahmed Ebeid]] and [[Youssef Elsisi]], succeeded Litschauer as conductors of the Cairo Symphony Orchestra.

==Guest conductors and soloists==
Many international guest conductors such as [[Charles Munch (conductor)|Charles Munch]], [[Yehudi Menuhin]], [[Alexander Frey]], [[Patrick Fournillier]], Carlo Zecchi, [[Otakar Trhlik]], Ole Schmidt, [[Gennady Rozhdestvensky]], Janos Kukla, [[Alain Pâris]], [[Felix Carrasco]], and others have led the Cairo Symphony Orchestra. In April 2009, Israeli-Argentinean conductor and pianist [[Daniel Barenboim]] played Beethoven's piano sonata no. 8 (known as "[[Sonata Pathétique]]"), and conducted the Cairo Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Beethoven’s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]].&lt;ref name="TERYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8002684.stm |title=BBC News: Barenboim gets ovation in Cairo | date=2009-04-17 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5450">'''Criminal tradition''' - of the cultural transmission of criminal values. Criminal traditions are transmitted from the older generation to the younger generation, such as social customs are in other forms of society.

Studies of the criminal tradition involved  Clifford R. Shaw and Henry D. McKay. They put forward a theory of “cultural transmission”, focuses on the development in some urban neighborhoods of a criminal tradition that persists from one generation to another despite constant changes in population. This theory stresses the value systems of different areas

Also worth noting theory of “differential association,” in which  Edwin H. Sutherland described the processes by which criminal values are taken over by the individual. Edwin H. Sutherland asserted that criminal behavior is learned and that it is learned in interaction with others who have already incorporated criminal values.&lt;ref&gt;Criminology Theory: Selected Classic Readings, by Frank P. Williams III, Marilyn D. McShane&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Shaw and McKay on the concept of cultural transmission indicates that a criminal tradition or subculture does exist in areas of  larger cities.  According to their studies Criminal tradition arises and is maintained in areas of instability, and the values, norms, and behaviors of the participants in the criminal tradition are viewed as normal by these people.&lt;ref&gt;Hepburn J. R. Subcultures, violence, and the subculture of violence: An old rut or a new road? //Criminology. – 1971. – Т. 9. – №. 1. – С. 87-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Population categories subject to criminal traditions ==

Traditions are not personified, so adolescents and boys are easier to obey than direct instructions from specific individuals. This is the power of tradition. The norms of the life of groups in which the will of their members manifest themselves take the form of tradition most often. In the tradition that there is no personification, adolescents find it easier to obey them than to a particular person. Against this background, the criminal traditions that are prevalent in youth criminal groups, especially in closed educational and correctional institutions are especially dangerous. In a criminal environment, there are two kinds of traditions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravo.vuzlib.su/book_z686_page_12.html "Laws of the criminal world of youth (criminal subculture)" by Pirozhkov V.]&lt;/ref&gt;

* They came to us from the criminal environment of the distant past and transformed into modern ones, taking into account the conditions of life of society and the relations dominating in it;
* New traditions that have arisen and established in a criminal environment in modern conditions and have no analogues in the past.

At the same time, there is a transformation of existing criminal traditions and the emergence of new ones. The reason for this is the changes in the social, economic, legal and other spheres.

== World criminal tradition ==

On the criminal tradition in different countries of the world, there is a huge amount of work. There is an impressive number of works on the Russian criminal tradition, written in different languages. 
We can also highlight works by Jonny Steinberg on [[The Numbers Gang|the numbers gangs]] of South Africa

== Alternative opinions ==

There is also the view that it is impossible to consider all the traditions of the criminal environment as antisocial and harmful, including, for the reason that some of the traditions in the cells of the remand center, contribute to hygiene and the maintenance of sanitary norms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravo.vuzlib.su/book_z686_page_12.html "Laws of the criminal world of youth (criminal subculture)" by Pirozhkov V.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russian criminal tradition == 

In Russian criminal tradition adherents of the criminal (criminal) tradition are characterized by active participation in the life of the "thieves' community"; Living on tangible assets obtained by criminal means; Propaganda of "thieves' customs and traditions, as well as criminal way of life; Compulsion to keep a word not only before the "brother", but also the criminal-criminal world; Organization of collection of "obschekovyh" funds and control over their use; Guardianship and assistance to detainees and convicts, the so-called "vagabonds" and "honest prisoners"; Compliance with the decisions of "gatherings"; Demanding of "brotherhood" and control over their compliance; Organization of counteraction to state bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rulit.me/books/cvetnaya-mast-elita-prestupnogo-mira-read-10956-1.html ВМЕСТО ПРЕДИСЛОВИЯ "ВОРЫ В ЗАКОНЕ" — ИСТОРИЯ ПРОБЛЕМЫ] RuLit&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narrative ==
In the [[Sealdah South lines]] there is the station Dhapdhapi. A few miles away is a Dakshin Rai temple. The residents of the area worship this Tiger God. Once belonged to the area of the Sundarbans. His domain stretches from the south [[Namkhana]] [[Kakdwip]] the Bhagirathi- Hooghly River [[Ganga]] in the west to the Ghatal Bakla district in the east as well as [[Khulna District|Khulna]] [[Jessore District]] of Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Banglar Loukik Debota (Bengali)|last=Gopendra Krishna Basu|first=|publisher=Dey's Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-81-295-2582-6|location=Kolkata|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every new moon (Amavashya) he is revered and appeased with animal sacrifices. Dakshin Rai also likes music and attracts musicians. The local tribes are trying their best to the 'King of the South' to please, by dancing and singing night after night.

Dakshin Rai is depicted with large whiskers. The body is slender and has a shiny, yellow tinge, which is decorated with tiger-like stripes. Drool drips from both sides of his mouth and he has a six-meter-long tail.

Inhabitants of the Sundarbans praying to Dakshin Rai or [[Bonbibi]] before venturing into the mangroves, as they believe this affords them protection. Natives of some tribes bind a mask with the face of Dakshin Rai to the back of their heads, so as to confuse or scare an approaching tiger and ward off its attack.&lt;ref name=Thapar1997 /&gt;

[[File:The Merry Drinker WGA.jpg|thumb|right|''The Merry Drinker'' (c. 1628–1630) by [[Frans Hals]].]]
Although alcoholic beverages and social attitudes toward [[Drinking#Alcoholic beverages|drinking]] vary around the world, nearly every [[civilization]] has independently discovered the processes of [[brewing]] [[beer]], [[Fermentation (wine)|fermenting]] [[wine]] and [[Distillation|distilling]] [[Distilled beverage|spirits]].

[[Alcohol (drug)|Alcohol]] and its effects have been present in societies throughout history. Drinking is documented in the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew]] and [[Christian Bible|Christian]] Bibles, in the [[Qur'an]], in art history, in Greek and Roman literature as old as [[Homer]] and in [[Confucius|Confucius’s]] ''[[Analects]]''.

==Social drinking==
"Social drinking", also commonly referred to as "responsible drinking", refers to casual drinking of alcoholic beverages in a social setting without an intent to become [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]]. In [[Western world|Western]] cultures, good news is often celebrated by a group of people having a few alcoholic drinks. For example, alcoholic drinks may be served to "wet the baby's head" in the celebration of a birth. Buying someone an alcoholic drink is often considered a gesture of goodwill. It may be an expression of gratitude, or it may mark the resolution of a dispute.

===Drinking etiquette===
[[File:Reunion de gentilhommes autour d une table dans un interieur van Schuppen.jpg|thumb|left|''Reunion of gentlemen around a table in an interior'', by [[Jacob van Schuppen]].]]
For the purposes of buying rounds of alcoholic drinks in English [[public house]]s, William Greaves, a retired London journalist, devised a set of etiquette guidelines as a Saturday morning essay in the defunct ''[[Today (UK newspaper)|Today]]'' newspaper. Known as [[Greaves' Rules]], the guidelines were based upon his long experience of pubs and rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gentlemenranters.com/september_2010_266.html#bg_163 |title=Pub Talk |author=William Greaves |date=3 September 2010 |work=Gentlemen Ranters |issue=162 |accessdate=15 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925003637/http://www.gentlemenranters.com/september_2010_266.html#bg_163 |archivedate=25 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules were later re-commissioned by the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' and published in that newspaper on November 20, 1993. Copies of the rules soon appeared in many bars throughout the United Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

When an individual arrives at a pub, common practice invites the newcomer to unilaterally offer an alcoholic drink to a companion, with the unspoken understanding that when the drink has been nearly consumed, his/her companion will reciprocate. Trust and [[Sportsmanship|fair play]] are the root of the rules, though there are occasions (such as a requirement of one of the drinkers to need to carry out more important jobs, if any can be conceived of) where the rules can be broken, and were itemised by Greaves in his article.

[[Kate Fox]], a [[social anthropologist]], came up with a similar idea in her book ''[[Watching the English]]'', but concluded their rationale was the need to minimise the possibility of violence between drinking companions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sirc.org/news/watching_the_english.shtml |title=Watching the English - The hidden rules of English behaviour |publisher=Sirc.org |date=2004-04-22 |accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When taking alcohol to a BYOB (bring your own bottle/booze/beer) party, it is proper for a guest to leave any unconsumed alcohol behind when leaving the party. It shows appreciation to the host and shows responsibility on the guest's part. It is considered rude to take any alcohol back when departing.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} 

Drinking at early times of the day is frowned upon in some cultures.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Noon (12pm) is often seen as earliest appropriate time of day to consume alcohol, although there are some special exceptions such as drinking [[Buck's Fizz]]es on [[Christmas Day]] morning.&lt;ref&gt; "The etiquette of drinking before noon", by Olivia Rudgard, The Daily Telegraph, 2015.  Accessed on 14AUG18 @ https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/11658794/An-etiquettes-guide-to-drinking-before-noon.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free drinks===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}
Various [[culture]]s and [[tradition]]s feature the social practice of providing free alcoholic drinks for others. For example, during a [[wedding reception]] or a [[bar mitzvah]], free alcoholic drinks are often served to guests, a practice that is known as "an open bar". Free alcoholic drinks may also be offered to increase attendance at a social or business function. They are commonly offered to [[casino]] patrons to entice them to continue [[gambling]].

A further example is the "ladies drink free" policy of some [[Bar (establishment)|bars]], which is intended to attract more paying customers (i.e., men).

Large corporations (especially in [[Japan]]) may have a favored bar at which they hold private functions that offer free alcoholic drinks to attendees.

===Session drinking===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Beer]] --&gt;
Session drinking is a chiefly [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] term that refers to drinking a large quantity of beer during a "session" (i.e. a specific period of time) without becoming too heavily intoxicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jason and Todd Alström |url=http://beeradvocate.com/articles/653 |title=Session Beers, Defined |publisher=BeerAdvocate |date=2005-12-10 |accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A session is generally a social occasion.

A "session beer", such as a [[Bitter (beer)#Sub-types of bitter|session bitter]], is a beer that has a moderate or relatively low alcohol content.

In the United States, a recent session beer definition has been proposed by beer writer Lew Bryson. His Session Beer Project blog includes a definition of 4.5% ABV or less for session beer. Followers of this definition include Notch Brewing, a session only beer brand. The Brewer Association has adopted a new category within their Great American Beer Fest competition which states a "session beer" must not exceed 4.1% ABW (5.1% ABV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Papazian|first=Charlie|title=GABF Beer Style Guidelines |url=http://www.brewersassociation.org/attachments/0000/5183/BA_2011_Beer_Style_Guidlines.pdf|work=Great American Beer Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In British vernacular, "session" is commonly referred to as "sesh".

In Ireland, the term "[[pub session]]" refers to playing music in a pub.

==Binge drinking==
{{Main|Binge drinking}}
Binge drinking is defined as drinking to excess.

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [NIAAA] defines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking alcohol that brings blood alcohol concentration [BAC] to 0.08 grams percent or above. For the typical adult, this pattern corresponds to consuming five or more drinks [men], or four or more drinks [women], in about 2 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=US Department of Health and Human Services|year=2006|url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AA67/AA67.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a "binge" has been somewhat elastic over the years, implying consumption of alcohol far beyond that which is socially acceptable. In earlier decades, "going on a binge" meant drinking over the course of several days until one was no longer able to continue drinking. This usage is known to have entered the English language as late as 1854; it derives from an English dialectal word meaning to "soak" or to "fill a boat with water". (''[[OED]]'', ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'')

=== Geographic disparity ===
Understanding drinking in young people should be understood through a "developmental" framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Underage Drinking: Why Do Adolescents Drink, What Are the Risks, and How Can Underage Drinking Be Prevented?|journal=National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism|year=2006|issue=67|url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AA67/AA67.htm|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be referred to as a "whole system" approach to underage drinking, as it takes into account a particular adolescent’s unique risk and protective factors—from genetics and personality characteristics to social and environmental factors. It is widely observed that in areas of [[Europe]] where [[child]]ren and adolescents routinely experience alcohol early and with parental approval, binge drinking tends to be less prevalent.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Typically, a distinction is drawn between northern and southern Europe, with the northerners being the binge drinkers. The highest levels of both binge-drinking and drunkenness are found in the Nordic countries, UK, Ireland, Slovenia and Latvia. This contrasts with the low levels found in France, Italy, Lithuania, Poland and Romania – for example, binge-drinking more than twice in the last month was reported by 31% of boys and 33% of girls in Ireland, but in comparison 12–13% of boys and 5–7% of girls in France and Hungary.&lt;ref name="Binge Drinking – Nature, prevalence and causes"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Binge Drinking and Europe|journal=Institute of Alcohol Studies|date=9 April 2010|url=http://www.ias.org.uk/resources/papers/europe/phproject/bingedrinking-report.pdf|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the eighth century, [[Saint Boniface]] was writing to Cuthbert, [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to report how "In your diocese, the vice of drunkenness is too frequent. This is an evil peculiar to pagans and to our race. Neither the Franks nor the Gauls nor the Lombards nor the Romans nor the Greeks commit it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tristram Hunt |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,1558040,00.html |title=Tristram Hunt: We're still failing history |work=The Observer |date=2005-08-28|accessdate=2010-09-23 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is probable, however, that "the vice of drunkenness" was present in all European nations. The 16th-century Frenchman [[Rabelais]] wrote [[comedic]] and [[surreal humour|absurd]] [[satires]] illustrating his countrymen's drinking habits, and Saint Augustin used the example of a drunkard in Rome to illustrate certain spiritual principles.

Some studies have noted traditional, cultural differences between Northern and Southern Europe. A difference in perception may also account to some extent for historically noted cultural differences: Northern Europeans drink [[beer]], which in the past was often of a low alcohol content (2.5% compared to today's 5%).{{Dubious|date=June 2011}} In [[pre-industrial society]], beer was safer to drink than water, because it had been boiled and contained alcohol. Southern Europeans drink [[wine]] and [[fortified wines]] (10–20% alcohol by volume). Traditionally, wine was watered and honeyed; drinking full strength wine was considered barbaric in [[Republican Rome]]. Nor does binge drinking necessarily equate with substantially higher national averages of per capita/per annum litres of pure alcohol consumption. There is also a physical aspect to national differences worldwide, which has not yet been thoroughly studied, whereby some ethnic groups have a greater capacity for alcohol metabolization through the liver enzymes [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] and [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

These varying capacities do not, however, avoid all health risks inherent in heavy alcohol consumption. Alcohol abuse is associated with a variety of negative health and safety outcomes. This is true no matter the individual's or the ethnic group's perceived ability to "handle alcohol". Persons who believe themselves immune to the effects of alcohol may often be the most at risk for health concerns and the most dangerous of all operating a vehicle.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

"Chronic heavy drinkers display functional tolerance when they show few obvious signs of intoxication even at high blood alcohol concentrations (BAC's), which in others would be incapacitating or even fatal. Because the drinker does not experience significant behavioral impairment as a result of drinking, tolerance may facilitate the consumption of increasing amounts of alcohol. This can result in physical dependence and alcohol-related organ damage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa28.htm |title=Alcohol and Tolerance - Alcohol Alert No. 28-1995 |publisher=Pubs.niaaa.nih.gov |date=|accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speed drinking==
[[Image:Guinness beer record2.jpg|right|thumb|Steven Petrosino achieving the Guinness World Record for speed drinking in June 1977 at the Gingerbreadman Pub in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]].]]

Speed drinking or competitive drinking is the drinking of a small or moderate quantity of beer in the shortest period of time, without an intention of getting heavily intoxicated. Unlike binge drinking, its focus is on competition or the establishment of a record. Speed drinkers typically drink a light beer, such as [[lager]], and they allow it to warm and lose its carbonation to shorten the drinking time.

''[[Guinness World Records]]'' (1990 edition, p.&amp;nbsp;464) listed several records for speed drinking. Among these were:
* [[Peter Dowdeswell|Peter G. Dowdeswell]] (born July 29, 1940) of [[Earls Barton]], [[Northamptonshire]], England, drank 2 [[litre]]s (3.5 [[Imperial units|imperial pints]]; about 66.7 [[United States customary units|U.S.fluid ounces]]) in 6 seconds on February 7, 1975.
* Steven Petrosino (born November, 1951) of [[New Cumberland, Pennsylvania]], USA, drank 1 litre (33 U.S. fluid ounces) in 1.3 seconds on June 22, 1977, at the Gingerbread Man Pub in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beerrecord.com|title=Guinness World Beer Drinking Record set in 1977|website=www.beerrecord.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither of these records had been defeated when ''Guinness World Records'' banned all alcohol-related records from their book in 1991.

Former Australian Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] held a record for the fastest consumption of "a yard" of beer. He drank 2.5 pints (1.4 litres) in 12 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/50years/news/key_stories_nat/ksn_1983.htm |title=Key Stories - 1983 |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=|accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Educational evaluation''' is the [[evaluation]] process of characterizing and appraising some aspect/s of an [[education]]al process.

There are two common purposes in educational evaluation which are, at times, in conflict with one another. Educational institutions usually require evaluation data to demonstrate effectiveness to funders and other stakeholders, and to provide a measure of performance for marketing purposes. Educational evaluation is also a professional activity that individual educators need to undertake if they intend to continuously review and enhance the learning they are endeavoring to facilitate.

== Purpose for educational evaluation ==
The [[Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation]] published three sets of standards for educational evaluations. ''The Personnel Evaluation Standards'' {{ref|Personnel}} was published in 1988, ''The Program Evaluation Standards'' (2nd edition) {{ref|Program}} was published in 1994, and ''The Student Evaluations Standards'' {{ref|Students}} was published in 2003.

[[File:Filipino woman 3.jpg|thumb|300px|A Filipino lady, 1898]]
[[File:Filipino woman.jpg|thumb|300px|1890s woman wearing the Maria Clara dress]]

[[File:Naturales 5.png|thumb|150px|The [[Boxer Codex]], showing the attire of a Classical period Filipino, made of [[silk]] and [[cotton]].]]'''Fashion and clothing in the Philippines''' refers to the way the [[Filipino people|people]] of [[Philippines|Filipino society]] dress up in instances such as while they are at home, at work, travelling and when attending special occasions.

==Overview==
The clothing style and fashion sense of the Filipinos in the modern-day era have been influenced by their native ancestors: their Spanish colonizers (the Philippines was a [[Spain|Spanish]] colony for around 300 years), the Americans (the Philippines was a territory of the [[United States]] for about 50 years), and even the Japanese ([[Japanese Empire|Japan]] occupied the Philippines during [[World War II]] for around 4 years), as evidenced by the chronology of events that occurred in Philippine history.[1] At present, Filipinos conform their way of dressing, in addition to the above factors, as a result of the influence of what is shown by the media on televis
fashion shows, among others.[1]

Apart from "colonial influences" and "media influence", the Filipino style of clothing had been dictated by the climate in the Philippines. With a ''tropical climate'' (dry and rainy seasons), early Filipinos – as well as the still extant tribal groups in the Philippines – wore colorful woven clothes, often with "intricate beadwork" and other ornaments. Other items of native clothing during pre-Spanish Philippines were the canga and the bahag. The ''canga'' is a type of a collarless shirt – which later became adorned with laces, trimmings, buttons, and a collar – was where from the Barong Tagalog evolved. On the other hand, the ''bahag'' was a type of loincloth or [[G-string]].

Present-day Filipinos, due to climatic reasons, prefer to wear T-shirts combined with maong (jeans) trousers for men and skirts for women. The "jeans and T-shirts" combination was introduced to the Filipinos by the Americans.[1]

A common attire while at home are ordinary puruntongs (singular: ''puruntong'', a type of pair of shorts or Capri pants) combined with sleeveless shirts or T-shirts. During the rainy season and cold evenings in December and January, some Filipinos wear hooded jackets.[1]

==Evolution of Philippine fashion==
===Archaic epoch (10th – 16th century)===
[[File:Naturales 4.png|thumb|223x223px|left|An ancient form of [[Barong tagalog]] in [[Boxer Codex]] (c. 1500s)]]

[[File:Native of Visayan origin.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Attire of a young woman]]During the archaic epoch, before the colonizers from Europe discovered the islands, the different tribes and kingdoms wore their respective clothing. The Filipino style of clothing had been dictated by the tropical climate in the Philippines, with a dry and rainy season. Early Filipinos – as well as the still extant tribal groups in the Philippines – wore colorful woven clothes, often with "intricate beadwork" and other ornaments. 
The men wore pants or a loincloth and usually went topless, as well as wearing tattoos symbolizing power and strength as a warrior; while women went either topless or wore a robe-like dress.

Prior to the [[History of the Philippines (1521-1898)#Spanish expeditions and colonization|Spanish Era]], the [[tagalog people|Tagalogs]] of Luzon already wore a garment that was a forerunner of the [[Barong Tagalog]] – the '''Baro'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barongsrus.com/barong/history-barong-tagalog-i-20.html Barong Tagalog history]&lt;/ref&gt; Earliest reference to the Baro was in the historical account of ''Ma-i'' (Pre-Colonial name for the Philippines) that the Filipinos wore a sleeve-doublet of rough cotton cloth called ''kanga'', reaching slightly below the waist. It was collarless and had an opening in front. The doublets indicated the social status and badge of courage of a man; red was for the Chiefs and the bravest, while black and white were for the ordinary citizens. Their loins were covered with colored ''Bahague'' between legs to mid-thigh.

The early pre-colonial clothing of [[Ethnic groups of the Philippines|groups]] such as the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]]s and [[Visayan people|Visayan]]s included both the baro and saya made from silk in matching colours. This style was exclusively worn by the women from the upper caste, while those of lower castes wore baro made from pounded white bark fiber, and a floor-length wrap-around skirt. Women usually wore jewelry, such as gold necklaces and earrings, which symbolized wealth and beauty. In some tribes, women also wore tattoos signifying beauty, power and wealth.[[File:Visayans 3.png|thumb|227x227px|A fashion for a royal visayans|alt=]]
In contrast, the Visayans wore clothes similar to that of Indonesians and Malaysians. They wore a robe called ''Marlota'' or jacket called ''Baquero'' without a collar that reached the feet. The robes or jackets were brightly coloured. The Tagalogs and the Visayans bound their foreheads and temples with long, narrow strips of cloth called ''Putong''. Necks were covered with gold necklaces, and wrists with golden armlets called ''Calombigas'' – these had intricate patterns. Others would wear precious stones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mybarong2.com/history-barong-tagalog-art-99.html History of the Barong Tagalog by My Barong]&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual male headdress was the ''pudong'', a turban; though in [[Panay]], both men and women also wore a head cloth or bandana called ''saplung''. Commoners wore pudong of rough abaca cloth wrapped around only a few turns so that it was more of a headband than a turban and was therefore called ''pudong-pudong'' – as the [[crown (heraldry)|crown]]s and [[diadem]]s on Christian images were later called. A red ''pudong'' was called magalong, and was the insignia of braves who had killed an enemy.

When [[Rajah Humabon|Humabon]]'s queen went to hear mass during Magellan's visit, she was preceded by three girls carrying one of her [[hat]]s. A [[headdress]] from Cebu with a deep crown, used by both sexes for travel on foot or by boat, was called ''sarok'', which actually meant to go for water.&lt;ref name=PC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinoy-culture.tumblr.com/post/30479656512/pre-colonial-traditional-clothing-note-though|title=Pinoy-Culture ~ A Filipino Cultural &amp; History Blog - Pre-Colonial Traditional Clothing (Note: Though...|publisher=|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic kingdoms in [[Mindanao]] especially the  [[Maranao people]] have a fashion article for the female called ''malong'', which is a tubeskirt  or a light blanket wrapped around the body. More prestigious clothes, ''lihin-lihin'', were added for public appearances and especially on formal occasions – [[blouse]]s and [[tunics]], loose smocks with sleeves, capes, or ankle-length robes.&lt;ref name=PC/&gt;

===Spanish Era: New Spain (1521–1799) ===
[[File:Filipina mestizas, early 1800s.jpg|thumb|212x212px|left|Filipino women's fashion, 1700s - 1840s]]

When the Spaniards came and settled in the country, the fashion changed drastically as the Spanish culture influenced the succeeding centuries of Philippine history. The Spanish dissolved the kingdoms and united the country, resulting in a mixture of cultures from different ethnic groups and Spanish culture.

Throughout the 16th century up to the 18th century, women wore a Hispanicized version of the [[Baro't saya]], composed of a bodice – called a ''camisa'', often made in pineapple fiber or muslin – and a floor length skirt, while the men wore the ''[[Barong Tagalog]]'', a collared and buttoned lace shirt or a suit.

===Spanish Era: Spanish East Indies (1800–1899)===

[[File:Filipino Painting 43.jpg|left|thumb|271x271px|[[Barong Tagalog|Barong]]]]
By the 19th century, due to the continuing influence of the Western culture, the rising economy, globalization, and exposure from the European fashion scene, the women's clothing began to have a change; by 1850s, women's clothing was now full wide skirts that usually have long train rather than the simple floor length skirts, a bodice called ''camisa'' which means blouse in English and a ''panuelo'', a big square cloth folded triangularly and worn in the Philippines like a great ruffle or collar. The attire is composed of four pieces, namely the camisa, the saya, the pañuelo (a scarf, also spelled panuelo) and the tapis. The ''camisa'' is a collarless chemise whose hem is at the waist, and is made from flimsy, translucent fabrics such as pineapple fiber and jusi. The sleeves of the camisa are similar to the so-called "angel wings", or shaped like bells that have cuffs. The pañuelo is a stiff covering for the neck, which acts as an accent piece because of embellishments added to it. The purpose of the pañuelo is related to modesty, used to cover the low-necked camisa'. The ''saya'' is a skirt shaped like a bubble with a length that begins from the waist reaching the floor. These are usually comprised either of single or double sheets, called "panels" or ''dos panos'' (lit. "two panels/layers"); some examples are made out of seven gores or ''siete cuchillos'' (lit. "seven knives"). The ''tapis'' is a knee-length over-skirt that hugs the hips. Tapis designs may be plain, and is usually made of opaque fabrics such as muslin and the madras cloth, and also is used for the purposes of modesty as it keeps the lower torso from showing due to the thinness of the saya. Also, when going to the church or attending mass, the women usually wore a veil above their heads, similar to other Catholic countries at that time.

The men also continued to wear but a more intricate version [[Barong Tagalog]], a collarless shirt originated from the ethnic cloth called ''canga''. Throughout the centuries the Barong Tagalog has evolved. Buttons and collars were added, as well as intricate designs on its pina fabric and laces. Underneath the transparent Barong Tagalog is the ''Camisa de Chino'' a type of shirt, usually in white that said to have been originated from the Chinese.

The women wore this kind of fashion even when the Spanish Regime was finally overthrown and was replaced by the First Philippine Republic. Today, this type of clothing is now called  as the "[[Maria Clara gown|Maria Clara]]" dress, named after the character of Maria Clara from Dr. Jose Rizal's novel [[Noli me tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]] who became a symbol of the traditional Filipino woman, known as modest, elegant and conservative.

===American Era (1900s–1920s) ===
[[File:Woman's costume from the Philippines, Honolulu Museum of Art 5752.1.JPG|200px|thumb|The traje de mestiza ensemble rose in popularity during the 1900s. This example is from the late 1920s to the early 1930s, its silhouette influenced by the [[1920s in Western fashion|flapper dress]]]]

When the Americans came and became the second country to colonize the islands, the fashion remained the same for the first five years of the 20th century. But it has started to change and became more modern in contrast to the conservative style of the previous centuries as the Americans started to influence the modern Filipino culture.

The women then wore the ''Traje de Mestiza'', the more modern version of the [[Maria Clara gown|Maria Clara]]. It had bigger sleeves and a narrower floor length skirt with a long train called ''saya de cola'' and replaced the full wide skirt reflecting the Edwardian Fashion of the West.

By the 1920s, the style of the skirt still remained, influenced by the flapper dress; however, the wide sleeves had been replaced by butterfly sleeves (popularized by local couturier Pacita Longos), and the big ''pañuelo'' reduced its size. Such trends had gained prominence especially during the annual Manila Carnivals of 1920s and through the 1930s. Some Filipino women who had lived in United States and in Europe wore the western 1920's fashion with loose dresses and knee length skirt.

Men wore the ''Americana'', the suit and coat worn in the West, mostly Americans (hence the name), replacing the traditional Barong Tagalog.

=== Commonwealth Era and Second World War (1930s–1940s) ===
By the 1930s, young adult women and children finally abandoned the typical "Traje de Mestiza" as everyday wear and started to wear floral printed dresses with mid-calf length shirts. Though many women embraced the western ideals, the typical "Traje de Mestiza" was not fully gone. The elders and middle aged women still wore the traditional dress while the young adults considered it only as a formal dress for events such as carnivals, galas, etc.  

In 1930s, the Philippines was famous for its beauty pageants and carnivals that drew tourists from around the world, and resulted in influencing the fashion and beauty standards of the Filipino women. The women wore more elaborate and intricate dresses. The "Traje de Mestiza" was still popular to the people through the 1930s. Men's fashion remained the same as they continued to wear the "Americana" suit.

When 1940s came, the Philippines saw the breaking out of World War II resulting in the shortage of tailoring shops, clothing boutiques and dressmaking factories as the country was occupied by the Japanese Empire. The austerity era started when rations were implemented and the women wore simpler clothing. The ''terno'' gradually disappeared and stopped being manufactured. Only the older people wore their old ''terno'' dresses. Clothing boutiques only sold monochromatic dresses, mostly in dark tones. The shirtwaist dresses of the previous decade also became popular in the 1940s with a simpler look.  

The men's fashion still remained unchanged but became a more casual as started abandoning the coat as a casual wear, and wore it only for formal wear. 

During the mid-1940s, the clothing boutiques, tailoring shops, and dressmakers stopped operation as the final chapter of the World War II occurred in the Philippines. The capital city of Manila was bombed and was left 80% destroyed, and was considered being the second most devastated capital city in World War II,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/02/19/manila-was-known-as-the-pearl-of-the-orient-then-world-war-ii-happened/|title=Manila was known as the ‘Pearl of the Orient.’ Then World War II happened.|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; next only to Warsaw.

After the war, most of the people either lost their clothes or could not find new clothes. In 1946, the country began its reparation and Manila's restoration. However, the lack of dressmakers made the fashion of the 1930s and early 1940s remain popular for the rest of the decade.

===1950s===
[[File:Philippine terno exhibit.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The Filipiniana/Terno gown, the modernized Traje de Mestiza rose to popularity as a formal attire during latter half of the 20th Century.]]
When the decade started, the country saw the rise of economy, once again giving opportunities for people to have more necessities and live in the normal life. Women remained wearing the 1940s fashion during the first five years of the decade. By the late 1950s, women started to wear dresses and with floral prints and fuller knee-length skirts. The style was inspired by Christian Dior's "New Look" collection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dior.com/couture/en_gb/the-house-of-dior/the-story-of-dior/the-new-look-revolution/|title=The Story of Dior, The New Look Revolution.|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; characterized by a below-mid-calf length, full-skirt, pointed bust, small waist, and rounded shoulder line. Summer and Day dresses became popular, as well as the pencil skirts and cardigans.

Men's fashion changed slightly as the men started wearing youthful clothing such as sweaters, colorful printed polos, pants and flannels. "Chinos" became popular as well as white tee shirt, tartan plaids. The drape cut suits remained popular for formal wear.

The [[Barong Tagalog]] became popular once again to be worn as a formal wear, popularized by the then-President Ramon Magsaysay. The ''Terno'' was rarely worn by young women everyday; however, it was still worn at formal events such as galas, national events, government parties and film festivals.

===1960s===
When the 1960s entered, most of the styles from the late 1950s still remained; however, due to the rise of British pop culture that spread in United States and other parts of the world, fashion started to change. A new kind of dress invented by [[Mary Quant]], called the [[miniskirt]], mini dresses started to become popular and mod style fashions also emerged. Hair became very stylish as the hair were styled bigger and higher with the use of hairspray. By the mid-1960s, the hemlines rose and the clothes loosened, influenced by the mod culture.

Men's fashion shifted towards a more youthful vibe, influenced by the rising Teenage culture seen in Hollywood and by various Teen-oriented Filipino films where they started wearing polos and pants, replacing the suit and coats. Suits and coats, as well as the Barong Tagalog, were now only worn during events and by the older men.

===1970s===
With the popularity of the hippie culture in the late 1960s, many Filipinos embraced this culture which has continued until the early seventies. At the same time, the rise of Filipino Nationalism began and both movements influenced the way people lived and dressed.

Men also started to grow their hair long, the first time ever that such style became acceptable in Filipino society.

By the mid-1970s, men started wearing [[t-shirt]]s, which replaced the formal look with a more laid-back look. [[Denim jeans]] also started to emerge, as well as [[sweatshirt]]s.

Teenage boys also wore pastel and neon colored jackets, polos, pants, short shorts and t-shirts. Converse All-Stars shoes were also popular among the teenagers. 

colorful short shorts for both teen boys and girls were also one of the huge trends that defined the decade.

Sportswear also became popular for everyday clothing. Leggings rose to popularity as well as jogging pants, headbands and legwarmers.

By 1989, a drastic change in style emerged; a trend having oversized shirts and pants were in style, paving way to the 1990s loose fashion. 

===1990s===
The 1990s fashion was a laid back version of the 1980s fashion. This decade saw the beginning of the influence of rock music to mainstream fashion. Men started to wear dark, simple and mostly oversized clothes, moving away to the brightly colored clothes of the 1980s. Women also wore loose, simple and casual clothing such as oversized shirts, denim shorts, denim jeans, simple blouses and sneakers. Skirts weren't as popular as denim throughout the decade. Men's hairstyles also changed as they grew their hair longer for the first time since the decade of the 1970s. Also, a hairstyle called ''cachupoy'' was considered popular among teenage boys. It was a straight hairstyle that has a middle parting at the center, most teen celebrities sported this kind of hairstyle.

It was also the decade when people from all social classes wore the same style of clothes, with people having a hard time distinguishing who was from the upper class or from the lower class as everyone opted for a simple, laid-back style of dressing.

===2010s===

Due to the development of social media, many Filipino women and men were exposed to different styles. Also due to the rising economy of the country for the first time since the 1986 People Power Revolution, as well as the constant building of shopping malls and shopping centers, many Filipinos began buying more clothes.

The early 2010s began with a continuation of some of the late-2000s fashion; however; in 2011, a change began as people started to move away from the rock influenced 2000s fashion and create a more distinctive 2010s fashion. With the rise of social media, most of the women began wearing [https://www.tumblr.com Tumblr] inspired clothes. Also, women became interested in 1960s fashion and began replicating that style. Men also began wearing preppy clothes inspired by the British boy band [[One Direction]] who rose to fame in 2010. Skinny jeans and shorts proved to be popular among the men and these came up in different colors.

'''Female perversion''' is a term coined by [[Estela V. Welldon]] in 1992 to refer to women who commit violence, either against themselves or against others.&lt;ref name=Welldon&gt;Welldon, E.V. 1991 ''Psychology and psychopathology in women - a psychoanalytic perspective'', '''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]''' 158 pg 85-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Madonna&gt;[[Estela V. Welldon|Welldon, E.V.]] 1992 ''Mother, Madonna, Whore: The Idealization and Denigration of Motherhood'' [[Free Association Books]], 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the term can be used [[pejorative]]ly and sometimes has sexual connotations, its strict definition is an instance of [[human behavior]] that deviates from what is considered [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] or [[normality (behavior)|normal]], and it is in this sense that the term is used by psychologists. The term is also controversial as according to Welldon there is a prevailing denial of the existence of female violence, throughout the legal and mental health community.&lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body {{ISBN|978-0415126755}}'' pg 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model of female perversion==
Welldon (1992)&lt;ref name="Madonna" /&gt; put forward a model of female perversion that introduced the term into the psychological nomenclature. The model covers several categories of violent behavior that can be directed at one's own body, against children, or against adults.

Freudian psychoanalytic theory suggested that perversion fell solely within the male domain, that it was related to the [[phallus]], and that aggressive drive was unique to men. In her book ''Madonna, Whore: The Idealisation and Denigration of Motherhood'',&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt; Welldon challenges this notion, and argues that women are equally capable of perversion. Though they do not use the [[penis]] with violence, they instead use the whole body.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In doing so, they attack the whole body, and sometimes by extension the bodies of children. They are symbolically wreaking revenge on their own internalised, often cruel and perverse mother. They identify their own body with the body of the mother. Likewise when they attack their children, they express violence towards a [[narcissistic]] extension of themselves" (Motz, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body'' pg 16&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The major forms it can manifest itself are &lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body'' pg 5-8&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[self-harm]]
* [[eating disorders]]
* physical and sexual abuse of children
* [[infanticide]]
* [[Munchausen syndrome by proxy]]
* physical or sexual assault of others, including battered women who kill
 
Welldon argues that it can be seen as a form of sexualised aggression, and challenges the Freudian view that violence is a uniquely male phallic expression.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The reproductive functions and organs are used by both sexes to express perversion. Perverse men use their penises to attack and show hatred towards symbolic sources of humiliation..... If perversion in the man is focused through his penis, in the woman it will similarly expressed through her reproductive organs and the maternal representations of motherhood

(Welldon 1991) &lt;ref name="Welldon" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Anna Motz]], in her book ''The psychology of female violence'' suggests that the expression of this anger on the body or that of another is a communicative act, clearly sending a message of internal pain or of psychosis (Motz, 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body'' pg 6&lt;/ref&gt; She calls the message "the language of the body", and that the symbolic use of violence against the body can be likened to psychosomatic illness.

===Violence against the self===

Violence against the self can take several forms, including deprivation and starvation as is the case in [[anorexia nervosa]] and [[bulimia]], [[self-injury]] or suicide attempts, or other forms of self-harm.

===Violence against children===

Violence against children often goes unreported, and is largely hidden from view. It can take the form of direct physical or sexual assault, [[Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy]], or [[infanticide]]. Often the capacity of women to commit violence against children is denied, in the refusal to 'think the unthinkable'.&lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body'' pg 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence against adults===
Violence against others can take many forms, from domestic assault, physical assault, and when it escalates in the form of [[homicide]] and/or [[infanticide]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7628">'''Naming conventions''' in [[Fiji]] differ greatly, both between and within ethnic groups in Fiji. [[Fijians|Indigenous Fijians]] have a set of cultural practices which today are more loosely followed, and to some extent blended with elements of European culture with regard to names. In the [[Indians in Fiji|Indian community]], traditional Indian naming practices co-exist with influence from the Fijian and European cultures.

== [[Fijians|Indigenous Fijians]] ==
The use of [[surname]]s is not traditional in [[Culture of Fiji|Fijian culture]]. In recent years, it has become more common, but remains far from universal. Whether to have a surname, and if so, whether to use it, are very much a matter of personal preference. One’s last name is not always, therefore, a surname.

The majority of Fijians have two [[given name]]s, a Christian name taken usually from the [[Bible]], and a traditional name. A child may be [[Baptism|baptized]] or registered with a surname, usually derived from the father’s traditional given name. It is not unusual for persons baptized with surnames to discard them; some reclaim them later in life, and some who did not originally have one may later adopt their father’s traditional name as a surname. It is not unheard of for Fijians to be known by different names at different stages of their lives.

===Fijian naming examples===
Former [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]] [[Sitiveni Rabuka]] was known as "Sitiveni Ligamamada" in his earlier days as a [[Rugby football|rugby]] player. Another notable example is [[George Speight]], the instigator of a [[2000 Fijian coup d'état|coup d'état]] in 2000, who contested [[Fijian general election, 2001|the subsequent election]] under the name of "Ilikimi Naitini." He did not need to change his name by [[deed poll]]; he only had to register his candidacy with his surname and English given name omitted. [[Maciu Navakasuasua]], a convicted accomplice of Speight’s, revealed on October 28, 2005 that he had emigrated to [[Australia]] and avoided a blacklist against his name by using his grandfather’s surname, which was registered on both his birth certificate and his passport.

Given the non-universal use of surnames, it is not uncommon for several members of a family all to bear different last names. Well known examples include [[Epeli Nailatikau|Ratu Epeli Nailatikau]] (the [[President of Fiji]] since 2009) and his brother, [[Tu'uakitau Cokanauto]].

Many Fijians who do not have surnames register their children with their own traditional given name as a surname. Well known examples include the late [[Kamisese Mara|Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara]], Fiji's longtime Prime Minister and President, whose children are surnamed ''Mara,'' though it was his given name, not his surname as most foreigners wrongly suppose. President Nailatikau has likewise passed his given name on to his children as a surname.

[[Josefa Iloilo|Ratu Josefa Iloilovatu Uluivuda]], better known simply as "Ratu Josefa Iloilo", who served as President of Fiji from 2000 to 2009, is an example of a Fijian who had a surname, but did not generally use it, except for legal purposes. ''Iloilo,'' the name by which he was generally known, which most non-Fijians mistakenly assumed to be his surname, was thus a diminutive of his second given name. This shortening of names is another common Fijian custom; another notable example of this phenomenon is rugby star [[Rupeni Caucaunibuca]], widely referred to both inside and outside Fiji as ''Caucau''.

Fijians of [[Ratu|chiefly]] rank use [[title]]s with their names. In most parts of Fiji, the title used by male chiefs is ''Ratu;'' the female equivalent is ''[[Adi (title)|Adi]].'' In [[Rewa Province]], the local [[dialect]] substitutes '''Ro''' for both titles. In the [[Lau Islands]], male and female chiefs are both styled '''''Roko,''''' while in [[Kadavu Island]] and western areas female chiefs are titled '''''Bulou.''''' The title is used immediately before the name, or before another title (e.g., Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, [[Epeli Qaraninamu Nailatikau|Ratu Dr. Epeli Nailatikau]]). However, it follows military titles (e.g., [[Brigadier general]] [[Epeli Ganilau|Ratu Epeli Ganilau]]).

===Names in Tradition===
Today, names may be inherited or passed on between relatives, but traditionally, Fijian names have a meaning and a history surrounding them. Before the arrival of [[Christianity]] and European culture, Fijian names were often based on circumstances or events surrounding the birth of the child, as well as other aspects. A modern example of a name that reflects both traditional and modern naming conventions is [[Joni Madraiwiwi]], who served as [[Vice-President of Fiji|Vice-President]] from 2004 to 2006. ''Joni'' is the Fijian rendering of "John". ''Madraiwiwi'', which means "sour [[bread]]," was passed on from his grandfather, also ''Ratu'' [[Joni Madraiwiwi I|Joni Madraiwiwi]]. The elder Madraiwiwi was named by his father, [[Mara Kapaiwai]] (a namesake, not an ancestor, of the modern ''Ratu'' Mara), who was facing execution and eating his last meal. Even the taste of bread had turned sour to him, hence the naming of his son.&lt;ref&gt;20th Century Fiji ''Madraiwiwi details of the names history and meaning''&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all children were named for such dramatic events. Tanoa Senibua was named for the "fragrance of the Bua" flower which was in the [[air]] surrounding the child's birthplace, and "Tanoa" as the father of the child was drinking [[kava]] from a Tanoa when he received the news his son was born. A set protocol would be followed for the naming, but protocol is less strictly adhered to in this modern era.

== Indo-Fijians ==
* ''See main article: [[Indian name]]''
The names of Fiji Islanders of [[India]]n ancestry provide clues to an individual's [[religion]] and [[caste]], and to what part of India their ancestors came from. [[Muslim]]s very often have names taken from the [[Quran]], while [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] are almost invariably surnamed [[Singh]] (if male) or [[Kaur]] (if female). Contrary to a common misconception, however, not everybody bearing that name is a Sikh: the great majority are [[Hinduism|Hindu]] (such as arguably the most notable Indo-Fijian, [[golf]]er [[Vijay Singh]]). Surnames, although not universal in India, have been adopted by almost all Indo-Fijians (despite their less-than-universal use by indigenous Fijians).

===The caste system and names===
Although the caste system is all but dead among [[Indians in Fiji|Fiji Indians]], ''[[Brahmin]]s'' (priests) can be recognized by the surname, ''[[Sharma]]'', while the ''[[Kshatriya]]s'' (warriors) can be recognized by the surname [[Singh]].

[[File:Linnet kineograph 1886.jpg|thumb|1886 illustration of the kineograph]]

A '''flip book''' or '''flick book''' is a book with a series of pictures that vary gradually from one page to the next, so that when the pages are turned rapidly, the pictures appear to animate by simulating motion or some other change.  Flip books are often illustrated books for children, but may also be geared towards adults and employ a series of photographs rather than drawings.  Flip books are not always separate books, but may appear as an added feature in ordinary books or magazines, often in the page corners.  Software packages and Websites are also available that convert digital video files into custom-made flip books.

== Functionality ==
Rather than "reading" left to right, a viewer simply stares at the same location of the pictures in the flip book as the pages turn.  The book must also be flipped with enough speed for the illusion to work, so the standard way to "read" a flip book is to hold the book with one hand and flip through its pages with the thumb of the other hand.  The German word for flip book—''Daumenkino'', literally "thumb cinema"—reflects this process.

== History and cultural uses ==
[[File:Daumenkino kol.jpg|thumb|A flip book]]
It has sometimes been assumed that the relatively simple flip book has been around since long before the invention of the more complicated 19th century animation devices like the [[phenakistiscope]] (1832) and the [[zoetrope]] (1866), but no conclusive evidence has been found. There are some medieval illuminated books with sequential images, such as ''Sigenot'' (circa 1470).&lt;ref&gt;http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/cpg67/0001/thumbs?sid=cf04d0c1f1b9e65a5338bc1a06222e96#/current_page&lt;/ref&gt; The illustrations in ''Sigenot'' are consistently framed and have short intervals between different phases of action, but the images can not produce the illusion of a fluent motion. The necessary notion of instances smaller than a second would not really develop before the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ZeiAAAAAQBAJ|first=Suzanne|last=Buchan|title=Pervasive Animation|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The oldest known documentation of the flip book appeared in September 1868, when it was patented by [[John Barnes Linnett]] under the name ''kineograph'' ("moving picture").  They were the first form of animation to employ a linear sequence of images rather than circular (as in the older [[phenakistoscope]]).  The German film pioneer, [[Max Skladanowsky]], first exhibited his [[film|serial photographic images]] in flip book form in 1894, as he and his brother Emil did not develop their own [[image projector|film projector]] until the following year.  In 1894, [[Herman Casler]] invented a mechanized form of flip book called the [[Mutoscope]], which mounted the pages on a central rotating cylinder rather than binding them in a book.  The mutoscope remained a popular attraction through the mid-twentieth century, appearing as coin-operated machines in [[penny arcade (venue)|penny arcades]] and [[amusement park]]s. In 1897, the English filmmaker Henry William Short marketed his "Filoscope", which was a flip book placed in a metal holder to facilitate flipping.

Flip books are now largely considered a toy or novelty for children, and were once a common "prize" in cereal and [[Cracker Jack]] boxes.  However, in addition to their role in the birth of cinema, they have also been an effective promotional tool since their creation for such decidedly adult products as [[car|automobiles]] and cigarettes. They continue to be used in marketing today, as well as in art and published photographic collections. Vintage flip books are popular among collectors, and especially rare ones from the late 19th to early 20th century have been known to fetch thousands of dollars in sales and auctions.

Since 2007, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] has started its films with a [[production logo]] that initially evokes a flip book.  It starts with a view of an empty page of paper, then as the pages start to turn, details are drawn in to reveal [[Mickey Mouse]] in ''[[Steamboat Willie]]''.

The first international flip book festival was held in 2004, by the [[Akademie Schloss Solitude]] in [[Stuttgart]]. Another international flip book festival was held in [[Linz]], [[Austria]] in 2005.

In 2010 Hungary postal services released a flip book of stamps depicting a moving [[gömböc]].&lt;ref&gt;http://gomboc-shop.com/product/stamps-mini-booklet&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Israel Philatelic Federation]] released an "Israeli Animation Stamp Booklet" in November 2010 with 15 stamps designed by Mish to be animated when flipping the pages. It commemorated the 50th anniversary of [[ASIFA]], the 25th anniversary of ASIFA Israel and the "Flip Book 250th Anniversary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2IZ7DV2ppg|title=Flipbook / Stamps : ISRAELI ANIMATION STAMP BOOKLET|last=Doc HEEZA|date=20 December 2010|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://israelphilately.org.il/en/catalog/series/1191/Israeli%20Animation%20-%20Booklet&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Garden-based learning (GBL)''' encompasses programs, activities and projects in which the garden is the foundation for integrated learning, in and across disciplines, through active, engaging, real-world experiences that have personal meaning for children, youth, adults and communities in an informal outside learning setting. Garden-based learning is an instructional strategy that utilizes the garden as a teaching tool.  
[[File:Hierbas aromaticas.JPG|thumb|Hierbas aromaticas]]
The practice of garden-based learning is a growing global phenomenon largely seen in the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]]. As of 2010, the [http://assoc.garden.org National Gardening Association] reported over 3,000 school gardens in the United States alone.&lt;ref name="fisher"&gt;Fisher-Maltese C, Zimmerman T. 2015. "A Garden-Based Approach to Teaching Life Science Produces Shifts in Students' Attitudes toward the Environment," International Journal of Environmental and Science Education. 10(1): 51–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some settings garden-based learning strategies are used entirely as the educational curriculum for multiple subjects and in others it supports or enriches the curriculum. Garden-based learning can contribute to all aspects of basic education on varying levels depending on the student and consistency of the garden-based learning program. Aspects of basic education benefits include but are not limited to academic skills, personal development, social development, moral development, vocational and/or subsistence skills, and life skills.

== Benefits of garden-based learning among children and youth ==

[[Landscape design]]ers, teachers, and others consider school and community gardens to be one of the most notable positive trends in the nation today. These environments can foster [[scientific literacy|science literacy]] and [[social skills]], while enhancing an awareness of the link between plants in the landscape and our, food, clothing, shelter, and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;"Cornell Garden Based Learning: Resources for Gardeners &amp; Educators". 2015 Oct. Ithaca (NY): Cornell University Cooperative Extension: http://gardening.cce.cornell.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardening projects provide children and youth with the carefree exploration of the natural world that occurs rarely in today's era of indoor living; it can also give young people the chance to develop a wide range of academic and social skills.

Noted benefits of garden-based learning programs among youth include increased nutrition awareness, environmental awareness, higher learning achievements, and increased life skills.

===Increased nutrition awareness===

Research indicates that youth who participate in garden-based learning programs increase their consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, and gain new enthusiasm for fresh, nutritious vegetables they grow. It is the physical act of having the students' plant their own fruits and vegetables that gives them ownership and gets them more involved in their learning. Students can then learn about the nutritional values of food and multiple ways to prepare their own products in healthy ways to further progress their awareness of health issues. These two examples of physical acts of learning are what motivate healthier eating choices in and outside of the school setting.&lt;ref name="fisher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berezowitz"&gt;Berezowitz C, Bontrager Yoder A, Schoeller D. July 2015. "School Gardens Enhance Academic Performance and Dietary Outcomes in Children," Journal of School Health. 85(8): 508–518.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs L, Straiger P, Johnson B. 2013."Expanding Children's Food Experiences: The Impact of a School-Based Kitchen Garden Program," Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior. 45(2): 137–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Student Health ====
[[File:Rothschild Hospital garden.jpg|thumb|Garden view of the Meyer Rothschild Hospital, established at 37 Street of the Prophets, Jerusalem, in 1888.]]
Teachers also regarded the garden to be very effective at enhancing academic performance, physical activity, language arts, and healthy eating habits. Garden-based learning attempts to combat obesity by introducing students to healthy foods and providing opportunities to for outside experiential learning. Gardening intervention in schools may also aid in the improved health of children for the simple reason that students get 20% or more of their daily food intake from school depending on their socioeconomic backgrounds; families with lower income depending on school lunch even more than others.&lt;ref name="Berezowitz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bontrager Yoder A, Liebhart J, McCarty D. 2014. "Farm to Elementary School Programming Increases Access to Fruits and Vegetables and Increases Their Consumption Among Those With Low Intake," Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior. 46(5): 341–349.&lt;/ref&gt;

Students and teachers have also reported that using GBL programs reduce stress. Reducing stress can result in increased mental health and boosted immune system. A boosted immune system means that the human body is stronger and heals more efficiently. This could help patients recovering from all diseases, wounds, illnesses and more. Hospitals and Primary care facilities would be an ideal spot to incorporate garden based learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thirdage.com/community-gardens-are-growing-revolutions/|title=Community Gardens are Growing Revolutions|date=2018-10-16|work=thirdAGE|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increased environmental awareness===

Research highlights that high school students gain more positive attitudes about environmental issues after participating in a school garden program. Gardening has also been shown to increase scores on environmental attitude surveys of elementary school children.

Environmental attitude surveys generally include statements like the ones shown below and give the opportunity to rank those statements with a score of 1–5 (Strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree) The statements differ in complexity based on the grade level.&lt;ref name="fisher" /&gt;
* I am worried about animals that are going extinct.
* Trying to protect the environment is my responsibility.
* I would come to school on Saturday to plant flowers. 
Environmental awareness and attitudes toward the environment is also seen to improve especially in urban schools where the garden-based learning programs in the schools may be some of the only times these students can connect with the outdoors away from city streets.&lt;ref name="Berezowitz"/&gt;

===Higher Learning Achievements===

Studies indicate students that participated in school gardening activities scored significantly higher on science achievement tests compared to students that did not experience any garden-based learning activities. Other research has indicated that weekly use of gardening activities and related classroom activities help improve science achievement test scores. The reasoning behind these improvements is connected to the holistic, integrated, hands-on, project based, cooperative and experiential learning activities that are all aspects of garden based education. In other words, student engagement in class is increased because they are being intrinsically motivated by "real world" experiences in a more informal setting than the classroom.&lt;ref name="fisher" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner E, Chi U. 2012."Intrinsic Motivation and Engagement as 'Active Ingredients' in Garden-Based Education: Examining Models and Measures Derived From Self-Determination Theory," The Journal of Environmental Education. 43(1): 16–36.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to note the extent to which students improve varies because every student learns differently and has preferred learning styles, which work best for them.&lt;ref name="Berezowitz" /&gt;

===Increased Life Skills===
Research has highlighted the many improvements in life skills that can be attributed to children's garden programs. These skills include: enhancement of moral education, increasing appreciation for nature, increasing responsibility, developing patience, increases in relationship skills, and increases in self-esteem, help students develop a sense of ownership and responsibility, and helps foster relationships with family members, peers, and their community.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond, D., J. Grieshop, and A. Subramanium. (2002). Revisiting garden based learning in basic education: Philosophical roots, historical foundations, best practices and products, impacts, outcomes, and future directions.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increased Education for the Disabled ===
Research has shown that Garden-based learning can help improve important aspects of learning for people with special needs. GBL is used with special ed students to improve memory and motor skills. Some disabled students are not able to learn outside, but GBL inside has just the same impact as it would outdoors. Hands on projects such as Garden-based learning have been used to access a higher learning level for some disabled or special ed students. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=84e36d86-448e-4164-8afb-f410987ae4d1@sessionmgr104|title=Elementary School Garden Programs Enhance Science Education for All Learner...: EBSCOhost|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Keys to successful garden-based learning programs &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Keys to successful garden-based learning programs {{!}} K12 Academics|url = http://www.k12academics.com/educational-programs/garden-based-learning/keys-successful-garden-based-learning-programs|website = www.k12academics.com|accessdate = 2015-11-21|first = Chris|last = Glavin}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
Studies have been shown that children benefit from garden based learning programs. These benefits could include leadership growth, community involvement, and voluntary education which can lead to increased child development. Researched programs are more effective when one is to work through the entire process to understand how everything works in order. The orders involved in this education from beginning to end include planning, design, application, and review.

* Positive focus
* Children allowed to 'lead the way' in some aspects throughout the process.
* Proactive behavior
* Responsibility
* Availability to program
* Gives different view on education/academics or life itself.
* Participation
* Communication

'''School Grounds Greening'''
* Gardens provides practical productive strategies to transform sterile school grounds into attractive and productive learning centers through the process of [[greening]]
* Hands-on activities in outdoor classrooms make learning more interesting while demonstrating other benefits such as decreased absenteeism and discipline problems
*Can increase cognitive brain development &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-10-nature-good-learninghere-kids.html|title=Being in nature is good for learning—here's how to get kids outside|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship between humans and nature ==
It has been proven that children are spending less and less time outdoors as new technology is invented. This trend has been seen to impact educational and social aspects of the youth. Spending more time outside has been seen to improve test scores and overall concentration. Having green areas is important to increase a students interest in nature and further help them understand compared to learning in a classroom. It has been studied and proven that students learn more when studying 'hands on'. At the same time, teachers and parents begin to realize the ability of education through nature. Parents and teachers are suggested to give kids an hour of play outdoors for every hour indoors. Nature Provides a wide range of materials for creativity among the human race. It is the humans choice to utilize those materials or not, however using those materials will result in a benefit of education.

[[File:The idle servant.jpg|thumb|''The Idle Servant''; housemaid troubles were the subject of several of [[Nicolaes Maes]]' works]]

'''Genre art''' is the pictorial representation in any of various media of scenes or events from everyday life,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=genre&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;english=N&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=300139140 Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus, s.v. "genre"]. Accessed 2 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; such as markets, domestic settings, interiors, parties, inn scenes, and street scenes. Such representations (also called '''genre works''', '''genre scenes''', or '''genre views''') may be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Some variations of the term ''genre art'' specify the medium or type of visual work, as in ''genre painting'', ''genre prints'', ''genre photographs'', and so on.

Rather confusingly, the normal meaning of [[genre]], covering any particular combination of an artistic medium and a type of subject matter (as, for example, in the [[romance novel]]), is also used in the [[visual arts]].  Thus, genre works, especially when referring to the [[painting of the Dutch Golden Age]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]]—the great periods of genre works—may also be used as an umbrella term for painting in various specialized categories such as [[still-life]], [[marine painting]], [[architectural painting]] and animal painting, as well as genre scenes proper where the emphasis is on human figures. Painting was divided into a [[hierarchy of genres]], with [[history painting]] at the top, as the most difficult and therefore prestigious, and still life and architectural painting at the bottom. But history paintings are a genre in painting, not genre works.

The following concentrates on painting, but genre motifs were also extremely popular in many forms of the [[decorative arts]], especially from the [[Rococo]] of the early 18th century onwards. Single figures or small groups decorated a huge variety of objects such as [[porcelain]], furniture, [[wallpaper]] and textiles.

==Genre painting==
[[Image:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 014.jpg|thumb|280px|left|''Peasant Dance'', c. 1568, oil on wood, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]] the Elder]]

''Genre painting'', also called ''genre scene'' or ''petit genre'', depicts aspects of [[everyday life]] by portraying ordinary people engaged in common activities. One common definition of a genre scene is that it shows figures to whom no identity can be attached either individually or collectively—thus distinguishing ''petit genre'' from [[history painting]]s (also called ''grand genre'') and [[portrait]]s. A work would often be considered as a genre work even if it could be shown that the artist had used a known person—a member of his family, say—as a model. In this case it would depend on whether the work was likely to have been intended by the artist to be perceived as a portrait—sometimes a subjective question. The depictions can be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Because of their familiar and frequently sentimental subject matter, genre paintings have often proven popular with the [[bourgeoisie]], or [[middle class]].  Genre themes appear in nearly all art traditions. Painted decorations in ancient [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tombs often depict banquets, recreation, and agrarian scenes, and [[Peiraikos]] is mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] as a [[Hellenistic]] panel painter of "low" subjects, such as survive in [[mosaic]] versions and provincial wall-paintings at [[Pompeii]]: "barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects".&lt;ref&gt;Book XXXV.112 of ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] often illustrated scenes of everyday peasant life, especially in the ''[[Labours of the Months]]'' in the calendar section of [[books of hours]], most famously [[Les Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]].

===To 1800===
[[File:Merry company, by Dirck Hals.jpg|thumb|''[[Merry company]]'', by Dirck Hals]]
The [[Low Countries]] dominated the field until the 18th century, and in the 17th century both [[Flemish Baroque painting]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] produced numerous specialists who mostly painted genre scenes.  In the previous century, the Flemish [[Renaissance]] painter [[Jan Sanders van Hemessen]] painted innovative large-scale genre scenes, sometimes including a moral theme or a religious scene in the background in the first half of the 16th century.  These were part of a pattern of "[[Mannerist]] inversion" in [[Antwerp]] painting, giving "low" elements previously in the decorative background of images prominent emphasis.  [[Joachim Patinir]] expanded [[landscape painting|his landscapes]], making the figures a small element, and [[Pieter Aertsen]] painted works dominated by spreads of [[still life]] food and genre figures of cooks or market-sellers, with small religious scenes in spaces in the background.  [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] made peasants and their activities, very naturalistically treated, the subject of many of his paintings, and genre painting was to flourish in Northern Europe in Brueghel's wake.
[[File:Wybrand Hendriks - Interieur met naaiende vrouw.jpg|thumb|Interior with woman by [[Wybrand Hendriks]] ]] [[Adriaen van Ostade|Adriaen]] and [[Isaac van Ostade]], [[Jan Steen]], [[Adriaan Brouwer]], [[David Teniers the Younger|David Teniers]], [[Aelbert Cuyp]], [[Johannes Vermeer]] and [[Pieter de Hooch]] were among the many painters specializing in genre subjects in the Low Countries during the 17th century. The generally small scale of these artists' paintings was appropriate for their display in the homes of middle class purchasers. Often the subject of a genre painting was based on a popular ''emblem'' from an [[Emblem book]]. This can give the painting a double meaning, such as in [[Gabriel Metsu]]'s [[:Image:Gabriel Metsu 003.jpg|''The Poultry seller'', 1662]], showing an old man offering a [[rooster]] in a symbolic pose that is based on a lewd engraving by Gillis van Breen (1595–1622), with the same scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/jong076erot01_01/jong076erot01_01_0001.htm|title=E. de Jongh, 'Erotica in vogelperspectief. De dubbelzinnigheid van een reeks zeventiende-eeuwse genrevoorstellingen' |date=|website=DBNL|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[merry company]]'' showed a group of figures at a party, whether making music at home or just drinking in a tavern. Other common types of scenes showed markets or fairs, village festivities ("kermesse"), or soldiers in camp.
[[File:Jean-Baptiste Greuze - Filial Piety - WGA10664.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]], ''Filial Piety'', 1765]]

In [[Italy]], a "school" of genre painting was stimulated by the arrival in [[Rome]] of the Dutch painter [[Pieter van Laer]] in 1625. He acquired the nickname "Il Bamboccio" and his followers were called the ''[[Bamboccianti]]'', whose works would inspire [[Giacomo Ceruti]], [[Antonio Cifrondi]], and [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]] among many others.

[[Le Nain|Louis le Nain]] was an important exponent of genre painting in 17th-century France, painting groups of peasants at home, where the 18th century would bring a heightened interest in the depiction of everyday life, whether through the [[romanticism|romanticized]] paintings of [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]], or the careful [[realism (arts)|realism]] of [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin|Chardin]]. [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (1725-1805) and others painted detailed and rather sentimental groups or individual portraits of peasants that were to be influential on 19th-century painting.

In England, [[William Hogarth]] (1697–1764) conveyed comedy, social criticism and moral lessons through canvases that told stories of ordinary people ful of narrative detail (aided by long sub-titles), often in serial form, as in his ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', first painted in 1732–33, then engraved and published in print form in 1735.

Spain had a tradition predating [[The Book of Good Love]] of social observation and commentary based on the Old Roman Latin tradition, practiced by many of its painters and [[illuminated manuscript|illuminators]].  At the height of the Spanish Empire and the beginning of its slow decline, many [[picaresque]] genre scenes of street life—as well as the kitchen scenes known as [[bodegones]]—were painted by the artists of The [[Spanish Golden Age]], notably [[Velázquez]] (1599–1660) and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] (1617–82). More than a century later, the Spanish artist [[Francisco de Goya]] (1746–1828) used genre scenes in painting and [[printmaking]] as a medium for dark commentary on the human condition. His ''[[The Disasters of War]]'', a series of 82 genre incidents from the [[Peninsular War]], took genre art to unprecedented heights of expressiveness.

==19th century==
[[File:Wassilij Grigorjewitsch Perow 004.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Vasily Perov]], ''The Hunters at Rest'' (1871)]]
[[File:Jagerswoning Rijksmuseum SK-A-1157.jpeg|thumbnail|280px|Hunter's home, by Henry Voordecker, 1826]]
[[File:1820-Country-Wedding-John-Lewis-Krimmel.jpg|thumb|280px|[[John Lewis Krimmel]], ''Country Wedding'' (1820)]]

With the decline of religious and historical painting in the 19th century, artists increasingly found their subject matter in the life around them. [[Realism (art)|Realists]] such as [[Gustave Courbet]] (1819–77) upset expectations by depicting everyday scenes in huge paintings—at the scale traditionally reserved for "important" subjects—thus blurring the boundary which had set genre painting apart as a "minor" category. [[History painting]] itself shifted from the exclusive depiction of events of great public importance to the depiction of genre scenes in historical times, both the private moments of great figures, and the everyday life of ordinary people. In French art this was known as the [[Troubador style]].  This trend, already apparent by 1817 when [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] painted ''Henri IV Playing with His Children'', culminated in the [[pompier]] art of French academicians such as [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904) and [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier]] (1815–91).  In the second half of the century interest in genre scenes, often in historical settings or with pointed social or moral comment, greatly increased across Europe.

[[William Powell Frith]] (1819–1909) was perhaps the most famous English genre painter of the Victorian era, painting large and extremely crowded scenes; the expansion in size and ambition in 19th-century genre painting was a common trend. Other 19th-century English genre painters include [[Augustus Leopold Egg]], [[Frederick Daniel Hardy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hardy Family of Artists: Frederick Daniel, George, Heywood, James and their descendants|last=Hardy|first=Kimber|publisher=ACC Art Books|year=2016|isbn=978-185149-826-0|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk UK|pages=12–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Elgar Hicks]], [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[John Everett Millais]].  Scotland produced two influential genre painters, [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]] (1744–96) and [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] (1785–1841). Wilkie's ''The Cottar's Saturday Night'' (1837) inspired a major work by the French painter [[Gustave Courbet]], ''[[After Dinner at Ornans]]'' (1849). Famous [[Russia]]n realist painters like [[Pavel Fedotov]], [[Vasily Perov]], and [[Ilya Repin]] also produced genre paintings.

In Germany, [[Carl Spitzweg]] (1808–85) specialized in gently humorous genre scenes, and in Italy [[Gerolamo Induno]] (1825–90) painted scenes of military life. Subsequently, the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], as well as such 20th-century artists as [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Itshak Holtz]], [[Edward Hopper]], and [[David Park (painter)|David Park]] painted scenes of daily life. But in the context of modern art the term "genre painting" has come to be associated mainly with painting of an especially anecdotal or sentimental nature, painted in a traditionally realistic technique.

The first true genre painter in the United States was the German immigrant [[John Lewis Krimmel]], who learning from Wilkie and Hogarth, produced gently humorous scenes of life in Philadelphia from 1812–21. Other notable 19th-century genre painters from the United States include [[George Caleb Bingham]], [[William Sidney Mount]], and [[Eastman Johnson]].

The works of American painter [[Ernie Barnes]] (1938–2009) and those of illustrator [[Norman Rockwell]] (1894–1978) could exemplify a more modern type of genre painting.

While genre painting began, in the 17th century, with representations by Europeans of European life, the invention and early development of photography coincided with the most expansive and aggressive era of European imperialism, in the mid-to-late 19th century, and so genre photographs, typically made in the proximity of military, scientific and commercial expeditions, often also depict the people of other cultures that Europeans encountered throughout the world.

Although the distinctions are not clear, genre works should be distinguished from [[Ethnography|ethnographic studies]], which are pictorial representations resulting from direct observation and descriptive study of the culture and way of life of particular societies, and which constitute one class of products of such disciplines as [[anthropology]] and the [[behavioural sciences]].

The development of photographic technology to make cameras portable and exposures instantaneous enabled photographers to venture beyond the studio to follow other art forms in the depiction of everyday life. This category has come to be known as [[street photography]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bystander: A History of Street Photography'' by [[Joel Meyerowitz]] and [[Colin Westerbeck]], Boston: [[Bulfinch Press]], 1994. {{ISBN|0-82121-755-0}}.

[[Parian marble]], ca. 470–460 BC. From [[Pharsalos]], Thessaly.]]

In the earliest times the Greeks wore their hair ''kome'' (long), and thus [[Homer]] constantly calls them ''karekomoontes''. 

This ancient practice was preserved by the [[Sparta]]ns for many centuries. The Spartan boys always had their hair cut quite short (''en chroi keirontes'');&lt;ref&gt;Plut. Lyc. 16&lt;/ref&gt; but as soon as they reached the age of puberty, they let it grow long. They prided themselves upon their hair, calling it the cheapest of ornaments (''kosmon adapanotatos''), and before going to battle they combed and dressed it with especial care, in which act [[Leonidas]] and his followers were discovered by the Persian spy before the [[battle of Thermopylae]].&lt;ref&gt;Herod, vii. 208, 209.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that both [[Sparta]]n men and women tied their hair in a knot over the crown of the head.&lt;ref&gt;Comp. Aristoph. Lys. 1316, with Hor. Carm. ii. 11, in ''compium Lacenae more comas religata nodum''. Miiller, Dor. iv. 3. § 1.&lt;/ref&gt; At a later time the Spartans abandoned this ancient custom, and wore their hair short, and hence some writers erroneously attribute this practice to an earlier period.&lt;ref&gt;Pans. vii. 14. § 2; Philostr. Vit. Apoll. iii. 15. p. 106, ed. Olear.; Pint. Ale. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom of the [[Athens|Athenians]] was different. They wore their hair long in childhood, and cut it off when they reached the age of puberty. The cutting off of the hair, which was always done when a boy became an [[ephebus]], was a solemn act, attended with religious ceremonies. A [[libation]] was first offered to [[Heracles]], which was called ''oinisteria''  or ''oinesteria'';&lt;ref&gt;Hesych. and Phot. s. v.&lt;/ref&gt; and the hair after being cut off was dedicated to some deity, usually a [[river-god]].&lt;ref&gt;Aeschyl. Chotpli. 6; Paus. i. 37. §2.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a very ancient practice to go to [[Delphi]] to perform this ceremony, and Theseus is said to have done so.&lt;ref&gt;Plut. Tlies. 5; Theophr. Char. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ephebi are always represented on works of art with their hair quite short, in which manner it was also worn by the athletes.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, Died. Mer. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Athenians passed into the age of manhood, they again let their hair grow. In ancient times at Athens the hair was rolled up into a kind of knot on the crown of the head, and fastened with golden clasps in the shape of [[grasshopper]]s. This fashion of wearing the hair, which was called ''krobylos'', had gone out just before the time of [[Thucydides]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides i. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenian females also wore their hair in the same fashion, which was in their case called ''korymbos''.&lt;ref&gt;See Miillngen (Peintvres Antiques, plate 40). The word ''corymbium'' is used in a similar sense by [[Petronius]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On vases, the heads of females were most frequently shown covered with a kind of band or a coif of net-work. Of these coiffures one was called ''kredemnos'', which was a broad band across the forehead, sometimes made of metal, and sometimes of leather, adorned with gold; to this the name of ''stlengis'' was also given, and it appears to have been much the same as the ''[[ampyx]]''. But the most common kind of head-dress for females was called by the general name of ''cecryphalus'', and this was divided into the three species of cecryphalus, saccus, and mitra. The kekryphalos, in its narrower sense, was a [[caul]] or coif of net-work, corresponding to the Latin ''[[reticulum]]''. It was worn during the day as well as the night, and has continued in use from the most ancient times to the present day. It is mentioned by Homer,&lt;ref&gt;II. xxii. 469&lt;/ref&gt; and is still worn in Italy and Spain.

These [[hairnet]]s were frequently made of gold threads,&lt;ref&gt;Juv. ii. 96; Petron. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes of silk,&lt;ref&gt;Salmas. Eocerc. ad Solin. p. 3.92.&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Elean]] ''[[byssus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Paus. vii. 21. § 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and probably of other materials, which are not mentioned by ancient writers. The persons who made these nets were called ''kekryphaloplokoi''.&lt;ref&gt;Pollux, vii. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Females with this kind of head-dress frequently occur in paintings found at Pompeii, from one of which the preceding cut is taken, representing a woman wearing a ''Coa Vestis'' ([[Kos|Coan]] cloth).&lt;ref&gt;Museo Borlon. vol. viii. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''sakkos'' and the ''mitra'' were, on the contrary, made of close materials. The sakos covered the head entirely like a sack or bag; it was made of various materials, such as silk, byssus, and wool.&lt;ref&gt;Comp. Aristoph. Tltcsin. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Some times, at least among the Romans, a bladder was used to answer the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Mart. viii. 33. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''mitra'' was a broad band of cloth of different colours, which was wound round the hair, and was worn in various ways. It was originally an Eastern head-dress, and may, therefore, be compared to the modern [[turban]]. It is sometimes spoken of as characteristic of the [[Phrygia]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;Herod, i. 195, vii. 62; Virg. Aen. ix. 616, 617; Juv. iii. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; It was, however, also worn by the Greeks, and [[Polygnotus]] is said to have been the first who painted Greek women with ''mitrae''.&lt;ref&gt;Plin. //. N. xxxv. 9. s. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman ''calantica'' or ''calvatica'' is said by [[Servius]]&lt;ref&gt;ad Virg, Aen. ix. 616.&lt;/ref&gt; to have been the same as the mitra, but in a passage in the Digest&lt;ref&gt;34. tit. 2. s. 25. § 10.&lt;/ref&gt; they are mentioned as if they were distinct.

Regarding the Romans besides the generic ''coma'' we also find the following words signifying the hair: ''[[capillus]], caesaries, crines, cincinnus'' and ''cirrus'', the two last words being used to signify curled hair. In early times the Romans wore their hair long, as was represented in the oldest statues in the age of [[Varro]],&lt;ref&gt;De lie Rust. ii. 11. § 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and hence the Romans of the [[History of Rome#Roman Empire|Augustan age]] designated their ancestors ''intonsi''&lt;ref&gt;Ov. Fast. ii. 30&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[capillati]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Juv. vi. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; But after the introduction of [[barber]]s into Italy, it became the practice to wear their hair short. The women too originally dressed their hair with great simplicity, but in the Augustan period a variety of different head-dresses came into fashion, many of which are described by Ovid.&lt;ref&gt;de Art. Am. iii. 136, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes these head-dresses were raised to a great height by rows of false curls.&lt;ref&gt;Juv. Sat. vi. 502.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dressing of the hair of a Roman lady at this period was a most important affair. So much attention did the Roman ladies devote to it, that they kept slaves especially for this purpose, called ornatrices, and had them instructed by a master in the art.&lt;ref&gt;Ov. de Art. Am. iii. 239; Suet. Claud. 40; Dig. 32. tit. 1. s. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Greek head-dresses mentioned above were also worn by the Roman ladies; but the ''mitrae'' appear to have been confined to prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Juv. iii. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the simplest modes of wearing the hair was allowing it to fall down in tresses behind, and only confining it by a band encircling the head. Another favourite plan was [[braid|plaiting]] the hair, and then fastening it behind with a [[Hairpin (fashion)|large pin]].

False hair or wigs were worn both by Greeks and Romans.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Juv. vi. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Among both peoples in ancient times the hair was cut close in mourning ([[funus]]); and among both the slaves had their hair cut close as a mark of servitude.&lt;ref&gt;Aristoph. Aves, 911; Plant. Ampli. i. ]. 306; Decker, Ckaricles, vol. ii. p. 380, &amp;c.; Bottiger, Sabina, vol. i. p. 138, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1980s, there have been several attempts to investigate the possibility of '''harvesting lightning energy'''. A single bolt of [[lightning]] carries a relatively large amount of energy (approximately 5 billion joules&lt;ref name="physics.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Could you power a city with lightning?|url=http://www.physics.org/facts/toast-power.asp|publisher=physics.org|accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or about the energy stored in 145 litres of petrol).  However, this energy is concentrated in a small location and is passed during an extremely short period of time ([[microsecond]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Yasuhiro Shiraishi|author2=Takahiro Otsuka|title=Direct measurement of lightning current through a wind turbine generator structure|journal=Electrical Engineering in Japan|date=September 18, 2006|page=42|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eej.20250/abstract|accessdate=24 July 2014|ref=measurementtoko|doi=10.1002/eej.20250|volume=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;); therefore, extremely high [[electrical power]] is involved.&lt;ref&gt;"The Electrification of Thunderstorms," Earle R.

==Overview==
A technology capable of harvesting lightning energy would need to be able to rapidly capture the high power involved in a lightning bolt. Several schemes have been proposed, but the ever-changing energy involved in each lightning bolt renders lightning power harvesting from ground-based rods impractical – too high, it will damage the storage, too low and it may not work.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Additionally, lightning is sporadic, and therefore energy would have to be collected and stored; it is difficult to convert high-voltage electrical power to the lower-voltage power that can be stored.&lt;ref name=Boston/&gt;

In the summer of 2007, an [[alternative energy]] company called Alternate Energy Holdings, Inc. (AEHI) tested a method for capturing the energy in lightning bolts. The design for the system had been purchased from an [[Illinois]] inventor named Steve LeRoy, who had reportedly been able to power a 60-watt [[light bulb]] for 20&amp;nbsp;minutes using the energy captured from a small flash of artificial lightning. The method involved a tower, a means of shunting off a large portion of the incoming energy, and a [[capacitor]] to store the rest. According to Donald Gillispie, CEO of AEHI, they "couldn't make it work," although "given enough time and money, you could probably scale this thing up... it's not black magic; it's truly math and science, and it could happen."&lt;ref name=nytimeslightningfarms&gt;{{Cite news

According to [[Martin A. Uman]], co-director of the Lightning Research Laboratory at the [[University of Florida]] and a leading authority on lightning,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080706160058/http://www.agu.org/inside/awards/bios/uman_martina.html Uman Receives 2001 Fleming Medal]. www.agu.org&lt;/ref&gt; a single lightning strike, while fast and bright, contains very little energy, and dozens of lightning towers like those used in the system tested by AEHI would be needed to operate five 100-watt light bulbs for the course of a year. When interviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]'', he stated that the energy in a [[thunderstorm]] is comparable to that of an [[atomic bomb]], but trying to harvest the energy of lightning from the ground is "hopeless".&lt;ref name=nytimeslightningfarms/&gt;

Another major challenge when attempting to harvest energy from lightning is the impossibility of predicting when and where [[thunderstorms]] will occur. Even during a storm, it is very difficult to tell where exactly lightning will strike.&lt;ref name="physics.org"/&gt;

Lightning strikes the most in northwestern Venezuela and the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Breslin|first1=Sean|title=Think Lightning Strikes the Most in Florida?  Think Again.|url=https://weather.com/safety/thunderstorms/news/lightning-strikes-around-the-world|website=Weather.com|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Guinness Book of World Records lists Venezuela’s Lake Maracaibo as having 28 lightning flashes each minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Ella|title=The Most Electric Place on Earth|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150810-the-most-electric-place-on-earth|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Directed plasma channels ==
To facilitate the harvesting of lightning, a [[laser]]-induced [[plasma channel]] (LIPC) could theoretically be used to allow lightning to strike in a predictable location. A high power laser could be used to form an ionized column of gas, which would act as an atmospheric conduit for electrical discharges of lightning, which would direct the lightning to a ground station for harvesting. (Discovery News Lighting Control https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBzxn2LEJoE)

Teramobile,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teramobile.org/teramobile.html&lt;/ref&gt; an international project initiated jointly by a French-German collaboration of CNRS (France) and DFG (Germany), has managed to trigger electric activity in thunderclouds by ultrashort lasers. A large amount of power is necessary, 5 terawatts, over the short pulse duration. For the moment, the application of laser-channeled lightning is to use energy to divert the lightning and prevent damage instead of harvesting the lightning energy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jérôme Kasparian |author2=Jean-Pierre Wolf|title=On lightning control using lasers|journal= Progress in Ultrafast Intense Laser Science|date=2010|pages=109–122|url=http://www.teramobile.org/publications/PUILS_kasparian_lihgtning_revised_compact.pdf|volume=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Council of Organizations of Folklore Festivals and Folk Arts''' ('''CIOFF''', {{lang-fr|Conseil international des organisations de festivals de folklore et d'arts traditionnels}}) is an [[international nongovernmental organization]] (NGO) in Official Partnership with [[UNESCO]] and is accredited to provide advisory service to the Committee of the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]]. CIOFF has 66 full members, 8 associate members and 27 corresponding members worldwide. Its headquarters are in [[Confolens]] in [[France]]. Full members are National Sections with the aim to preserve traditional art, to organize Folklore Festivals or similar activities as well as unite voluntary organizations, working in the field of dance, music, costumes, customs and [[ethnography]]. The National Sections belong to sectors in the organization according to their geographic location.&lt;ref name="NPG"&gt;[http://nuevaprensa.com.ve/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7402:cioff-venezuela-lamenta-la-muerte-de-su-fundador-internacional&amp;catid=101:cultura&amp;Itemid=339 Andreína Delgado Puche: ''Cioff Venezuela lamenta la muerte de su fundador internacional''.] Nueva Prensa de Guayana, 30. März 2011 (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; CIOFF is a member of the [[International Music Council]].

== Aims ==
Aims of the organization are the preservation, promotion, and dissemination of traditional art and [[Folklore]].&lt;ref name="NPG"/&gt;

=== Events ===
Each year more than 350 Folklore Festivals organized by CIOFF take place worldwide &lt;ref name="NPG"/&gt; Every 4 years CIOFF world organization is holding Folkloriada. This is a major festival where all members of CIOFF are invited to send Folklore Groups from their countries to show the diversity of Folklore. CIOFF has organized 3 Folkloriadas
* 1996 in [[Brunssum]] in the Netherlands
* 2000 in [[Tokyo]] and other cities in Japan
* 2004 in [[Pécs]] and [[Budapest]] in Hungary
* 2012 in [[Anseong]] in Korea
* 2016 in [[Zacatecas]] in Mexico

2009 Folkloriada had to be cancelled because of a natural disaster in China.

=== Culture ===
Two very important aims of CIOFF are to disseminate the ideas of the ''([[Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]]&lt;ref&gt;Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. Paris, 20 October 2005.  UNESCO. General Conference, 33rd Session. Records of the General Conference. Thirty-third Session, Paris, 3–21 October 2005. Volume I: Resolutions. 33 C/Resolution 41.

UNESDOC database, accessed 8/12/2010: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001331/133171e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of the UNESCO.

=== Formation ===
The organization was founded on August 8, 1970 in Confolence in France by Henri Coursaget und 9 other people.&lt;ref name="NPG"/&gt;

On July 11, 1984 CIOFF was given the category of mutual informal Relations to UNESCO (Status C). From then on CIOFF became a member of the members of the International Nongovernmental Organizations of UNESCO. In September 1990 CIOFF was upgraded to the category Formal Consultative Relations with UNESCO (Status B).

=== Presidents of CIOFF ===
* Henri Coursaget, France (1970–1989)
* Guy Landry, Canada (1989–1997)
* Kari Bergholm, Finland (1997–2005)
* Dr. Udomsak Sakmunwong, Thailand (2005–2013)
* Philippe Beaussant, France (2013– )

== Organizational Structure of CIOFF ==
=== General Assembly ===
The General Assembly (GA) is the highest organ of CIOFF. It takes place every year in one of the member countries. It is the decision-making unit, because determines of the targets and the formal guidelines of the organization’s work and makes decisions on proposals presented by the council. The GA also elects the members of the Council for a period of 4 years. The council meets twice a year.

=== General Secretariat ===
The General Secretariat has its headquarters in [[Stockton on Tees]] in United Kingdom and is overseen by the Secretary General.

=== Commissions ===
For the development of basic themes in the comprehensive field of activities of CIOFF and for advising the council and the general Assembly permanent Commissions are established. These are the Festivals Commission, the Commission for Communication and Public Relations, the Legal Commission and the Cultural Commission.

=== Working Groups ===
To solve temporary problems or to do work on specific projects Working Groups can be established.

=== Management Bodies ===
The management bodies of CIOFF are the Executive Committee (EXCO), consisting of the President, two Vice Presidents, the Treasurer and the Secretary General and the Council consisting of the EXCO, the Chairmen of the Commissions, the Representatives of the Sectors, the Representative to UNESCO and the Chairman of the Youth Coordinating Committee.

{{Human growth and development}}
'''Language acquisition''' is the process by which humans acquire the capacity to perceive and comprehend [[language]], as well as to produce and use [[word]]s and [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s to communicate. Language acquisition is one of the quintessential human traits,&lt;ref name="Friederici 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Friederici | first1 = AD. | title = The brain basis of language processing: from structure to function | journal = Physiol Rev | volume = 91 | issue = 4 | pages = 1357–92 |date=Oct 2011 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.00006.2011 | pmid = 22013214 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.385.5620 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because [[Animal language|non-humans do not communicate by using language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 =Kosslyn  | first1 = Stephen M.  | last2 = Osherson | first2 = Daniel N. | title = An invitation to cognitive science | year = 1995 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Mass. | isbn = 978-0-262-65045-8 | oclc =  613819557 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Language acquisition usually refers to '''first-language acquisition''', which studies infants' acquisition of their [[First language|native language]], whether that be spoken language or signed language as a result of [[prelingual deafness]]. This is distinguished from ''[[second-language acquisition]]'', which deals with the acquisition (in both [[Language acquisition by deaf children|children]] and adults) of additional languages.  In addition to speech, reading and writing a language with an entirely [[multiscriptualism|different script]] compounds the complexities of true foreign language [[literacy]].

Linguists who are interested in child language acquisition for many years question how language is acquired, Lidz et al. states "The question of how these structures are acquired, then, is more properly understood as the question of how a learner takes the surface forms in the input and converts them into abstract linguistic rules and representations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lidz|first=Jeffrey|last2=Waxman|date=16 April 2003|title=What infants know about syntax but couldn't have learned:experimental evidence for syntactic structure at 18 months|url=https://unstable.nl/andreas/ai/psy/presentaties/Lidz2003.pdf|journal=Cognition 89 (2003) B65-B73|volume=|pages=|via=Elsevier science}}&lt;/ref&gt; So we know language acquisition involves structures, rules and representation. The capacity to successfully use language requires one to acquire a range of tools including [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and an extensive [[vocabulary]]. Language can be vocalized as in speech, or manual as in [[sign language|sign]]. Human language capacity is represented in the brain. Even though human language capacity is finite, one can say and understand an infinite number of sentences, which is based on a syntactic principle called [[recursion]]. Evidence suggests that every individual has three recursive mechanisms that allow sentences to go indeterminately. These three mechanisms are: ''relativization'', ''complementation'' and ''coordination''.&lt;ref name="Lightfoot, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lightfoot|first1=David|title=Language acquisition and language change|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|volume=1 |issue=5|year=2010|pages=677–684|issn=1939-5078|doi=10.1002/wcs.39|pmid=26271652}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are actually two main guiding principles in first-language acquisition, that is, [[speech perception]] always precedes [[speech production]] and the gradually evolving system by which a child learns a language is built up one step at a time, beginning with the distinction between individual [[phoneme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Fry, Dennis|year=1977|title=Homo loquens, Man as a talking animal|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages= 107–108|isbn=978-0-521-29239-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Learning box.svg|thumb|Learning box for language acquisition]]
Philosophers in ancient societies were interested in how humans acquired the ability to understand and produce language well before [[empirical methods]] for testing those theories were developed, but for the most part they seemed to regard language acquisition as a subset of man's ability to acquire knowledge and learn concepts.&lt;ref name="Innateness and Language"&gt;{{cite web|title=Innateness and Language|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/innateness-language/#ChoCasAgaSki|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some early observation-based ideas about language acquisition were proposed by [[Plato]], who felt that word-meaning mapping in some form was innate. Additionally, [[Sanskrit grammarians]] debated for over twelve centuries whether humans' ability to recognize the meaning of words was god-given (possibly innate) or passed down by previous generations and learned from already established conventions: a child learning the word for cow by listening to trusted speakers talking about cows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Matilal, Bimal Krishna |title=The word and the world: India's contribution to the study of language |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=978-0-19-562515-8 |oclc=24041690 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more modern context, empiricists, like [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]], argued that knowledge (and, for Locke, language) emerge ultimately from abstracted sense impressions. These arguments lean towards the "nurture" side of the argument: that language is acquired through sensory experience, which led to [[Rudolf Carnap]]'s Aufbau, an attempt to learn all knowledge from sense datum, using the notion of "remembered as similar" to bind them into clusters, which would eventually map into language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/82/2/understanding-human-language-an-in-depth-exploration-of-the-human-facility-for-language|title=Understanding Human Language: An In-Depth Exploration of the Human Facility for Language|author=Kendra A. Palmer|publisher=StudentPulse.com|year=2009|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of [[behaviorism]] argued that language may be learned through a form of [[operant conditioning]]. In [[B. F. Skinner]]'s ''[[Verbal Behaviour]]'' (1957), he suggested that the successful use of a sign, such as a word or [[lexical unit]], given a certain stimulus, [[reinforcement|reinforces]] its "momentary" or contextual probability. Since operant conditioning is contingent on reinforcement by rewards, a child would learn that a specific combination of sounds stands for a specific thing through repeated successful associations made between the two. A "successful" use of a sign would be one in which the child is understood (for example, a child saying "up" when he or she wants to be picked up) and rewarded with the desired response from another person, thereby reinforcing the child's understanding of the meaning of that word and making it more likely that he or she will use that word in a similar situation in the future. Some [[empiricism|empiricist]] theories of language acquisition include the [[statistical learning theory]]. Charles F. Hockett of language acquisition, [[relational frame theory]], [[functionalist linguistics]], [[social interactionist theory]], and usage-based language acquisition.

Skinner's behaviourist idea was strongly attacked by [[Noam Chomsky]] in a review article in 1959, calling it "largely mythology" and a "serious delusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Noam | first1 = Chomsky  | last2 = Skinner  | first2 = B. F.  | year = 1959 | title = A Review of B. F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior | url = http://cogprints.org/1148/ | journal = Language | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 26–58 | doi=10.2307/411334| jstor = 411334  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments against Skinner's idea of language acquisition through operant conditioning include the fact that children often ignore language corrections from adults. Instead, children typically follow a pattern of using an irregular form of a word correctly, making errors later on, and eventually returning to the proper use of the word. For example, a child may correctly learn the word "gave" (past tense of "give"), and later on use the word "gived". Eventually, the child will typically go back to learning the correct word, "gave". The pattern is difficult to attribute to Skinner's idea of operant conditioning as the primary way that children acquire language. Chomsky argued that if language were solely acquired through behavioral conditioning, children would not likely learn the proper use of a word and suddenly use the word incorrectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harley|first1=Trevor A.|title=Talking the Talk: Language, Psychology and Science|date=2010|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-84169-339-2|pages=68–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky believed that Skinner failed to account for the central role of syntactic knowledge in language competence. Chomsky also rejected the term "learning", which Skinner used to claim that children "learn" language through operant conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harris, Margaret |title=Language Experience and Early Language Development: From Input to Uptake |publisher=Psychology Press |location=UK |year=1992 |pages= |isbn= 978-0863772382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Chomsky argued for a mathematical approach to language acquisition, based on a study of [[Syntactic Structures|syntax]].

==General approaches==
[[File:Kituwah Academy.png|thumb|left|300px|A lesson at Kituwah Academy on the [[Qualla Boundary]] in [[North Carolina]]. The [[language immersion]] school, operated by the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]], teaches the same curriculum as other [[United States|American]] [[primary schools]], but the [[Cherokee language]] is the medium of instruction from [[pre-school]] on up and students learn it as a [[first language]]. Such schools have proven instrumental in the preservation and perpetuation of the Cherokee language.]]
A major debate in understanding language acquisition is how these capacities are picked up by [[infant]]s from the linguistic input.&lt;ref name="Kennison 2013"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1=Kennison | first1=Shelia M. | title=Introduction to language development | date =2013-07-30  | publisher=SAGE Publications  | location=Los Angeles  | isbn=978-1-4129-9606-8 | oclc=830837502 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Input in the linguistic [[Context (language use)|context]] is defined as "All words, contexts, and other forms of language to which a learner is exposed, relative to acquired proficiency in first or [[second language]]s". [[Psychological nativism|Nativists]] such as [[Noam Chomsky]] have focused on the hugely complex nature of human grammars, the finiteness and ambiguity of the input that children receive, and the relatively limited [[cognitive abilities]] of an infant. From these characteristics, they conclude that the process of language acquisition in infants must be tightly constrained and guided by the biologically given characteristics of the human brain. Otherwise, they argue, it is extremely difficult to explain how children, within the first five years of life, routinely master the complex, largely tacit [[Grammar|grammatical rules]] of their native language.&lt;ref name="Sakai, 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sakai|first=Kuniyoshi L.|title=Language Acquisition and Brain Development |journal=Science|year=2005 |volume=310|pages=815–819 |doi=10.1126/science.1113530 |pmid=16272114|issue=5749|bibcode=2005Sci...310..815S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the evidence of such rules in their native language is all indirect—adult speech to children cannot encompass what children know by the time they've acquired their native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Child Language Acquisition and Growth|last=Lust|first=Barbara|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780511803413|location=Cambridge|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars, however, have resisted the possibility that infants' routine success at acquiring the grammar of their native language requires anything more than the forms of learning seen with other cognitive skills, including such mundane motor skills as learning to ride a bike. In particular, there has been resistance to the possibility that human biology includes any form of specialization for language. This conflict is often referred to as the "[[nature and nurture]]" debate. Of course, most scholars acknowledge that certain aspects of language acquisition must result from the specific ways in which the human brain is "wired" (a "nature" component, which accounts for the failure of non-human species to acquire human languages) and that certain others are shaped by the particular language environment in which a person is raised (a "nurture" component, which accounts for the fact that humans raised in different societies acquire different languages). The as-yet unresolved question is the extent to which the specific cognitive capacities in the "nature" component are also used outside of language.

===Social interactionism===
{{Main|Social interactionist theory}}
Social interactionist theory is an explanation of [[language development]] emphasizing the role of social interaction between the developing child and linguistically knowledgeable adults. It is based largely on the socio-cultural theories of Soviet psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]], and made prominent in the Western world by [[Jerome Bruner]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, J. (1983). ''Child's Talk: Learning to Use Language''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other approaches, it emphasizes the role of feedback and reinforcement in language acquisition. Specifically, it asserts that much of a child's linguistic growth stems from modeling of and interaction with parents and other adults, who very frequently provide instructive correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moerk | first1 = E.L. | year = 1994 | title = Corrections in first language acquisition: Theoretical controversies and factual evidence | url = | journal = International Journal of Psycholinguistics | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 33–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus somewhat similar to [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] accounts of language, though it differs substantially in that it posits the existence of a social-cognitive model and other mental structures within children (a sharp contrast to the "[[black box]]" approach of classical behaviorism).

Another key idea within the theory of social interactionism is that of the [[zone of proximal development]]. Briefly, this is a theoretical construct denoting the set of tasks a child is capable of performing with guidance, but not alone.&lt;ref&gt;Vygotskii [Vygotsky], L.S. 1935. "Dinamika umstvennogo razvitiia shkol’nika v sviazi s obucheniem." In Umstvennoe razvitie detei v protsesse obucheniia, pp. 33–52. Moscow-Leningrad: Gosuchpedgiz.&lt;/ref&gt; As applied to language, it describes the set of linguistic tasks (proper syntax, suitable vocabulary usage, etc.) a child cannot carry out on their own at a given time, but can learn to carry out if assisted by an able adult.

===Relational frame theory===
{{Main|Relational frame theory}}
The [[relational frame theory]] (RFT) (Hayes, Barnes-Holmes, Roche, 2001), provides a wholly selectionist/learning account of the origin and development of language competence and complexity. Based upon the principles of [[B. F. Skinner|Skinnerian]] [[behaviorism]], RFT posits that children acquire language purely through interacting with the environment. RFT theorists introduced the concept of [[functional contextualism]] in language learning, which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events, such as thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context. RFT distinguishes itself from Skinner's work by identifying and defining a particular type of [[operant conditioning]] known as derived relational responding, a learning process that, to date, appears to occur only in humans possessing a capacity for language. Empirical studies supporting the predictions of RFT suggest that children learn language via a system of inherent reinforcements, challenging the view that language acquisition is based upon innate, language-specific cognitive capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Steven C. Hayes |editor2=Dermot Barnes-Holmes |editor3=Brian Roche |title= Relational Frame Theory: A Post-Skinnerian Account of Human Language and Cognition (Hardcover)|publisher= Plenum Press |year= 2001 |isbn= 978-0-306-46600-7 |oclc= 51896575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergentism===
[[Emergentism|Emergentist]] theories, such as [[Brian MacWhinney|MacWhinney's]] [[competition model]], posit that language acquisition is a [[cognitive process]] that emerges from the interaction of biological pressures and the environment. According to these theories, neither nature nor nurture alone is sufficient to trigger language learning; both of these influences must work together in order to allow children to acquire a language. The proponents of these theories argue that general cognitive processes subserve language acquisition and that the end result of these processes is language-specific phenomena, such as [[vocabulary development|word learning]] and [[syntax|grammar acquisition]]. The findings of many empirical studies support the predictions of these theories, suggesting that language acquisition is a more complex process than many believe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Brian MacWhinney| title=The Emergence of Language |year=1999|isbn=978-0-8058-3010-1 |oclc=44958022 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax and morphology==
As [[syntax]] began to be studied more closely in the early 20th century, in relation to language learning, it became apparent to linguists, psychologists, and philosophers that knowing a language was not merely a matter of associating words with concepts, but that a critical aspect of language involves knowledge of how to put words together—sentences are usually needed in order to communicate successfully, not just isolated words.&lt;ref name="Innateness and Language"/&gt; A child will use short expressions such as ''Bye-bye Mummy'' or ''All-gone milk'', which actually are combinations of individual [[noun]]s and an [[operator (linguistics)|operator]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Fry, Dennis|year=1977|title=Homo loquens, Man as a talking animal|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages= 117|isbn=978-0-521-29239-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; before it begins to use gradually more complex sentences. In the 1990s within the [[Principles and Parameters]] framework, this hypothesis was extended into a maturation-based [[Structure building model of child language]] regarding the acquisition of functional categories. In this model, children are seen as gradually building up more and more complex structures, with Lexical categories (like noun and verb) being acquired before Functional-[[syntactic categories]] (like determiner and complementiser).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Radford, Andrew|year=1990|title=Syntactic Theory and the Acquisition of English Syntax|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-16358-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When acquiring a language, it is also often found, in languages such as English, that the most frequently used verbs are [[irregular verbs]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Young children first begin to learn the past tense of verbs individually; however, when they acquire a "rule", such as adding -ed to form the past tense, they begin to exhibit occasional overgeneralization errors (e.g. "runned", "hitted") alongside correct past-tense forms. One influential proposal to the origin of these errors is as follows: the adult state of grammar stores each irregular verb form in memory as well as a "block" on the use of the regular rule for forming that type of verb. In the developing child's mind, retrieval of that "block" may fail, causing the child to erroneously apply the regular rule instead of retrieving the irregular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Marcus G, Pinker S, Ullman M, Hollander M, Rosen TJ, Xu F|lastauthoramp=y|year=1992|title=Overregularization in language acquisition|journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|volume=57|issue=4|series=Serial No. 228|pmid=1518508|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5834.1992.tb00313.x|url=http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gary/marcusArticles/Marcus%20et%20al%201992%20SRCD%20Mono.pdf|pages=1–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carlson, Neil  |author2=Heth, Donald|year=2007|title=Psychology the Science of Behaviour|publisher=Pearson Education:New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A [[Merge (linguistics)]]-based Theory'''. In Bare-Phrase structure ([[Minimalist Program]]), since theory-internal considerations define the specifier position of an internal-merge projection (phases vP and CP) as the only type of host which could serve as potential landing-sites for  move-based elements displaced from lower down within the base-generated VP structure – e.g., A-movement such as passives (["The apple was eaten by [John (ate the apple)"]]), or raising ["Some work does seem to remain [(There) does seem to remain (some work)"]])—as a consequence, any strong version of a [[Structure building model of child language]] which calls for an exclusive "external-merge/argument structure stage" prior to an "internal-merge/scope-discourse related stage" would claim that young children's stage-1 utterances lack the ability to generate and host elements derived via movement operations. In terms of a merge-base theory of language acquisition, complements and specifiers are simply notations for first-merge (= "complement-of" [head-complement]), and later second-merge (= "specifier-of" [specifier-head], with merge always forming to a head. First-merge establishes only a set {a, b} and is not an ordered pair—e.g., an {N, N}-compound of 'boat-house' would allow the ambiguous readings of either 'a kind of house' and/or 'a kind of boat'. It is only with second-merge that order is derived out of a set {a {a, b}} which yields the [[recursive]] properties of syntax—e.g., a 'house-boat' {house {house, boat}} now reads unambiguously only as a 'kind of boat'. It is this property of recursion that allows for projection and labeling of a phrase to take place;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Moro, A.  |year=2000|title=Dynamic Antisymmetry, Linguistic Inquiry Monograph Series 38|publisher=MIT Press}}).&lt;/ref&gt; in this case, that the Noun 'boat' is the Head of the compound, and 'house' acting as a kind of specifier/modifier. External-merge (first-merge) establishes substantive 'base structure' inherent to the VP, yielding theta/argument structure, and may go beyond the lexical-category VP to involve the functional-category light verb vP. Internal-merge (second-merge) establishes more formal aspects related to edge-properties of scope and discourse-related material pegged to CP. In a Phase-based theory, this twin vP/CP distinction follows the "duality of semantics" discussed within the [[Minimalist Program]], and is further developed into a dual distinction regarding a probe-goal relation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miyagawa, Shigeru  |year=2010|title=Why Agree? Why Move?|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, at the "external/first-merge-only" stage, young children would show an inability to interpret readings from a given ordered pair, since they would only have access to the mental parsing of a non-recursive set. (See Roeper for a full discussion of recursion in child language acquisition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roeper, Tom  |year=2007|title=The Prism of Grammar: How child language illuminates humanism|publisher=MIT Press}}).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to word-order violations, other more ubiquitous results of a first-merge stage would show that children's initial utterances lack the recursive properties of inflectional morphology, yielding a strict Non-inflectional stage-1, consistent with an incremental Structure-building model of child language.

[[Generative grammar]], associated especially with the work of [[Noam Chomsky]], is currently one of the approaches to children's acquisition of syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lillo-Martin, Diane C. |author2=Crain, Stephen |title=An introduction to linguistic theory and language acquisition |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |location=Cambridge, MA |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=978-0-631-19536-8 |oclc=799714148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leading idea is that human biology imposes narrow constraints on the child's "hypothesis space" during language acquisition. In the [[principles and parameters]] framework, which has dominated generative syntax since Chomsky's (1980) ''[[Lectures on Government and Binding|Lectures on Government and Binding: The Pisa Lectures]]'', the acquisition of syntax resembles ordering from a menu: the human brain comes equipped with a limited set of choices, from which the child selects the correct options by using the parents' speech, in combination with the context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Baker, Mark Raphael |title=The atoms of language |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=978-0-19-860632-1 |oclc=66740160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important argument, which favors the generative approach, is the [[poverty of the stimulus]] argument. The child's input (a finite number of sentences encountered by the child, together with information about the context in which they were uttered) is, in principle, compatible with an infinite number of conceivable grammars. Moreover, few, if any, children can rely on [[corrective feedback]] from adults when they make a grammatical error, due to the fact that adults generally provide feedback regardless of whether a child's utterance was grammatical or not, and children have no way of discerning if a response was intended to be a correction. Additionally, when children do understand that they are being corrected, they don't always reproduce accurate restatements.{{Dubious|More than a few children can rely on corrective feedback|reason=Children can distinguish corrective feedback from other responses|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marcus|first=Gary F.|year=1993|title=Negative evidence in language acquisition|journal=Cognition|volume=46|issue=1|pages=53–85|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(93)90022-n|pmid=8432090|url=http://www2.denizyuret.com/ref/marcus_gf/marcus93.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.466.3904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brown, Roger|author2=Camile Hanlon|year=1970|contribution=Derivational complexity and order of acquisition in child speech|title=Cognition and the development of language|editor=J.

Hayes|location=New York|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet barring situations of medical abnormality or extreme privation, all the children in a given speech-community converge on very much the same grammar by the age of about five years. An especially dramatic example is provided by children who, for medical reasons, are unable to produce speech and, therefore, can never be corrected for a grammatical error but nonetheless, converge on the same grammar as their typically developing peers, according to comprehension-based tests of grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lenneberg, Eric|year=1967|title=Biological Foundations of Language|location=New York|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Stromswold, Karin|title=Lessons from a mute child|conference=Rich Languages from Poor Inputs: A Workshop in Honor of Carol Chomsky|location=MIT, Cambridge, MA|date=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerations such as those have led Chomsky, [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Eric Lenneberg]] and others to argue that the types of grammar the child needs to consider must be narrowly constrained by human biology (the [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] position).&lt;ref name=Chomsky1975&gt;{{cite book|author=Chomsky, N.|title=Reflections on Language|location=New York|publisher=Pantheon Books|year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; These innate constraints are sometimes referred to as [[universal grammar]], the human "language faculty", or the "language instinct".&lt;ref name=Pinker&gt;{{cite book |author=Pinker, Steven |title=The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language (P.S.) |publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=978-0-06-133646-1 |oclc=778413074 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empiricism===

Although Chomsky's theory of a [[generative grammar]] has been enormously influential in the field of linguistics since the 1950s, many criticisms of the basic assumptions of generative theory have been put forth by cognitive-functional linguistics, who argue that language structure is created through language use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tomasello, Michael |title=Constructing a language: a usage-based theory of language acquisition |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2003  |isbn=978-0-674-01030-7 |oclc=62782600 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These linguists argue that the concept of a [[language acquisition device]] (LAD) is unsupported by evolutionary anthropology, which tends to show a gradual adaptation of the human brain and vocal cords to the use of language, rather than a sudden appearance of a complete set of binary parameters delineating the whole spectrum of possible grammars ever to have existed and ever to exist.&lt;ref name="Mameli 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Mameli | first1 = M. | last2 = Bateson | first2 = P. | title = An evaluation of the concept of innateness. | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 366 | issue = 1563 | pages = 436–43 |date=Feb 2011 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2010.0174 | pmid = 21199847 | pmc = 3013469}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, cognitive-functional theorists use this anthropological data to show how human beings have evolved the capacity for grammar and syntax to meet our demand for linguistic symbols. (Binary parameters are common to digital computers, but may not be applicable to neurological systems such as the human brain.){{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Further, the generative theory has several constructs (such as movement, empty categories, complex underlying structures, and strict binary branching) that cannot possibly be acquired from any amount of linguistic input. It is unclear that human language is actually ''anything like'' the generative conception of it. Since language, as imagined by nativists, is unlearnably complex,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} subscribers to this theory argue that it must, therefore, be innate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lidz|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Lasnik|first2=Howard|title=The Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Universal Grammar|volume=1|date=Dec 2016|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199573776.013.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nativists hypothesize that some features of syntactic categories exist before a child is exposed to any experience - categories on which the child maps words of their language as they learn their native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Child Language|last=L.|first=Bavin, Edith|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511576164|location=Cambridge|pages=15–34|oclc=798060196}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different theory of language, however, may yield different conclusions. While all theories of language acquisition posit some degree of innateness, they vary in how much value they place on this innate capacity to acquire language. Empiricism places less value on the innate knowledge, arguing instead that the input, combined with both general and language-specific learning capacities, is sufficient for acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tomasello|first1=Michael|title=First Steps Toward a usage-based theory of language acquisition|journal=Cognitive Linguistics|date=2000|volume=11|pages=61–82|doi=10.1515/cogl.2001.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1980, linguists studying children, such as [[Melissa Bowerman]],&lt;ref name="Majid Bowerman 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Majid|first1=Asifa|last2=Bowerman|first2=Melissa|last3=Staden|first3=Miriam van|last4=Boster|first4=James S| title=The semantic categories of cutting and breaking events: A crosslinguistic perspective| journal=Cognitive Linguistics| volume=18| issue=2| year=2007| issn=0936-5907| doi=10.1515/COG.2007.005 |url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:57738:2/component/escidoc:57739/majid_2007_semantic.pdf |format=PDF|citeseerx=10.1.1.1014.4819}}&lt;/ref&gt; and psychologists following [[Jean Piaget]], like [[Elizabeth Bates]]&lt;ref name="Bates 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Bates | first1 = E. | last2 = D'Amico | first2 = S. | last3 = Jacobsen | first3 = T. | last4 = Székely | first4 = A. | last5 = Andonova | first5 = E. | last6 = Devescovi | first6 = A. | last7 = Herron | first7 = D. | last8 = Lu | first8 = CC. | last9 = Pechmann | first9 = T. | last10 = Pléh | first10 = C | last11 = Wicha | first11 = N | last12 = Federmeier | first12 = K | last13 = Gerdjikova | first13 = I | last14 = Gutierrez | first14 = G | last15 = Hung | first15 = D | last16 = Hsu | first16 = J | last17 = Iyer | first17 = G | last18 = Kohnert | first18 = K | last19 = Mehotcheva | first19 = T | last20 = Orozco-Figueroa | first20 = A | last21 = Tzeng | first21 = A | last22 = Tzeng | first22 = O | title = Timed picture naming in seven languages | journal = Psychon Bull Rev | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 344–80 |date=Jun 2003 | doi =  | pmid = 12921412 | url = http://icn.ncu.edu.tw/upload/paper/201301301759502003_Hung_Timed%20picture%20naming%20in%20seven%20languages..pdf | pmc=3392189| display-authors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jean Mandler, came to suspect that there may indeed be many learning processes involved in the acquisition process, and that ignoring the role of learning may have been a mistake.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In recent years, the debate surrounding the nativist position has centered on whether the inborn capabilities are language-specific or domain-general, such as those that enable the infant to visually make sense of the world in terms of objects and actions. The anti-nativist view has many strands, but a frequent theme is that language emerges from usage in social contexts, using learning mechanisms that are a part of a general cognitive learning apparatus (which is what is innate).

====Statistical learning====
{{Main|Statistical learning in language acquisition}}
Some language acquisition researchers, such as [[Elissa L. Newport|Elissa Newport]], Richard Aslin, and [[Jenny Saffran]], emphasize the possible roles of general [[learning]] mechanisms, especially statistical learning, in language acquisition. The development of [[connectionist]] models that are able to successfully learn words and syntactical conventions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seidenberg |first=Mark S. |author2=J.L.

[[Statistical learning]] theory suggests that, when learning language, a learner would use the natural statistical properties of language to deduce its structure, including sound patterns, words, and the beginnings of grammar.&lt;ref name="Saffran, 2003"/&gt; That is, language learners are sensitive to how often [[syllable]] combinations or words occur in relation to other syllables.&lt;ref name="Saffran 1996 1926–1928"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saffran|first=Jenny|author2=Aslin, Newport |title=Statistical learning by 8-month-old infants|journal=Science|year=1996|volume=274|issue=5294|pages=1926–1928|doi=10.1126/science.274.5294.1926|pmid=8943209|bibcode=1996Sci...274.1926S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graf Estes 2007 254–260"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graf Estes|first=Katharine|author2=Evans, Alibali, Saffran|title=Can Infants Map Meaning to Newly Segmented Words?

These findings suggest that early experience listening to language is critical to vocabulary acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lany|first=Jill|author2=Saffran |title=From Statistics to Meaning: Infants' Acquisition of Lexical Categories|journal=Psychological Science|volume=21|issue=2|pages=284–91|date=January 2010|doi=10.1177/0956797609358570|pmid=20424058|url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/21/2/284|pmc=3865606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statistical abilities are effective, but also limited by what qualifies as input, what is done with that input, and by the structure of the resulting output.&lt;ref name="Saffran, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saffran|first1=Jenny R.|title=Statistical language learning: mechanisms and constraints| journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=12 |issue=4|year=2003 |pages=110–114 |issn=0963-7214|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.01243}}&lt;/ref&gt; One should also note that statistical learning (and more broadly, distributional learning) can be accepted as a component of language acquisition by researchers on either side of the "nature and nurture" debate. From the perspective of that debate, an important question is whether statistical learning can, by itself, serve as an alternative to nativist explanations for the grammatical constraints of human language.

==== Chunking ====

Chunking theories of language acquisition constitute a group of theories related to statistical learning theories, in that they assume the input from the environment plays an essential role; however, they postulate different learning mechanisms. The central idea of these theories is that language development occurs through the incremental acquisition of meaningful [[chunking (psychology)#Chunking as the learning of long-term memory structures|chunks]] of elementary [[constituent (linguistics)|constituents]], which can be words, [[phoneme]]s, or syllables. Recently, this approach has been highly successful in simulating several phenomena in the acquisition of [[syntactic category|syntactic categories]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Freudenthal |first=Daniel |author2=J.M.

Researchers at the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]] have developed a computer model analyzing early toddler conversations to predict the structure of later conversations. They showed that toddlers develop their own individual rules for speaking with slots, into which they could put certain kinds of words. A significant outcome of the research was that rules inferred from toddler speech were better predictors of subsequent speech than traditional grammars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bannard C, Lieven E, Tomasello M |title=Modeling children's early grammatical knowledge |journal=Proc.

==Representation in the brain==
Recent advances in functional [[Functional neuroimaging|neuroimaging technology]] have allowed for a better understanding of how language acquisition is manifested physically in the brain. Language acquisition almost always occurs in children during a period of rapid increase in brain volume. At this point in development, a child has many more neural connections than he or she will have as an adult, allowing for the child to be more able to learn new things than he or she would be as an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nadia|first=Steve|title=Kid's Brain Power|url=http://www.riggsinst.org/brainpower.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensitive period===
{{main|Sensitive periods#Language|Critical period hypothesis}}
Language acquisition has been studied from the perspective of [[developmental psychology]] and [[neuroscience]],&lt;ref name="White 2013"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = White | first1 = EJ. | last2 = Hutka | first2 = SA. | last3 = Williams | first3 = LJ. | last4 = Moreno | first4 = S. | title = Learning, neural plasticity and sensitive periods: implications for language acquisition, music training and transfer across the lifespan. | journal = Front Syst Neurosci | volume = 7 | issue =  | pages = 90 | year = 2013 | doi = 10.3389/fnsys.2013.00090 | pmid = 24312022 | pmc = 3834520 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which looks at learning to use and understand language parallel to a child's brain development. It has been determined, through empirical research on developmentally normal children, as well as through some extreme cases of language deprivation, that there is a "[[sensitive period]]" of language acquisition in which human infants have the ability to learn any language. Several findings have observed that from birth until the age of six months, infants can discriminate the phonetic contrasts of all languages. Researchers believe that this gives infants the ability to acquire the language spoken around them.  After such an age, the child is able to perceive only the phonemes specific to the language learned. The reduced phonemic sensitivity enables children to build phonemic categories and recognize stress patterns and sound combinations specific to the language they are acquiring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuhl P, Stevens E, Hayashi A, Deguchi T, Kiritani S, Iverson P|title= Infants show a facilitation effect for native language phonetic perception between 6 and 12 months |journal=Developmental Science |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=F13–F21 |date=February 2006 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00468.x |pmid= 16472309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Wilder Penfield noted, "Before the child begins to speak and to perceive, the uncommitted cortex is a blank slate on which nothing has been written.

At a very young age, children can already distinguish between different sounds but cannot produce them yet. However, during infancy, children begin to babble. Deaf babies babble in the same order when hearing sounds as non-deaf babies do, thus showing that babbling is not caused by babies simply imitating certain sounds, but is actually a natural part of the process of language development. However, deaf babies do often babble less than non-deaf babies and they begin to babble later on in infancy (begin babbling at 11 months as compared to 6 months) when compared to non-deaf babies.&lt;ref name="Schacter, 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schacter |first1=Daniel L. |authorlink1= |last2=Gilbert |first2=Daniel T. |authorlink2= |last3=Wegner |first3=Daniel M. |authorlink3=|editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |title=Psychology |trans-title=Second Edition |accessdate= |type= |edition=Second |series= |volume= |origyear=2009|year=2011 |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=United States of America |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=351–352 |trans-chapter= |chapter=9 |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |author-mask= |display-authors=|lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prelinguistic language abilities that are crucial for language acquisition have been seen even earlier than infantry. There have been many different studies examining different modes of language acquisition prior to birth. The study of language acquisition in fetuses started back in the late 1980s when different researchers discovered that very young infants could discriminate their native language from other languages. In Mehler et al. (1988),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mehler|first1=Jacques|last2=Jusczyk|first2=Peter|last3=Lambertz|first3=Ghislaine|last4=Halsted|first4=Nilofar|last5=Bertoncini|first5=Josiane|last6=Amiel-Tison|first6=Claudine|title=A precursor to language acquisition in young infants|journal=Cognition|volume=29|issue=2|pages=143–178|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(88)90035-2|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; infants underwent discrimination tests and it was shown that infants as young as 4 days old could discriminate utterances in their native language from an unfamiliar language, but could not discriminate between two languages when neither was native to them. These results suggest there are mechanisms for fetal auditory learning, and other researchers have found further behavioral evidence to support this notion. Fetus auditory learning through environment habituation has been seen in a variety of different modes, such as: fetus learning of familiar melodies (Hepper, 1988),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hepper|first1=Peter|title=Fetal "Soap" Addiction|journal=Lancet|date=11 June 1988|volume=331|issue=8598|pages=1347–1348|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(88)92170-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; story fragments (DeCasper &amp; Spence, 1986),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeCasper|first1=Anthony|last2=Spence|first2=Melanie|title=Prenatal maternal speech influences newborns' perception of speech sounds.|journal=Infant Behavioral Development|date=1986|volume=9|issue=2|pages=133–150|doi=10.1016/0163-6383(86)90025-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognition of mother's voice (Kisilevsky, 2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kisilevsky|first1=Barbara|last2=Hains|first2=Sylvia|last3=Lee|first3=Kang|last4=Xie|first4=Xing|last5=Huang|first5=Hefeng|last6=Ye|first6=Hai|last7=Zhang|first7=Ke|last8=We|first8=Zengping|title=Effects of experience on fetal voice recognition|journal=Psychological Science|date=2003|volume=14|issue=3|pages=220–224|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.02435|pmid=12741744}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more evidence of fetus adaptation to native linguistic environments (Moon, Cooper &amp; Fifer, 1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moon|first1=Christine|last2=Cooper|first2=Robin|last3=Fifer|first3=William|title=Two-day-olds prefer their native language|journal=Infant Behavioral Development|date=1993|volume=16|issue=4|pages=495–500|doi=10.1016/0163-6383(93)80007-U}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosody is the property of speech that conveys an emotional state of the utterance, as well as intended form of speech (whether it be a question, statement or command). Some researchers in the field of developmental neuroscience would argue that fetal auditory learning mechanisms are solely due to discrimination in prosodic elements. Although this would hold merit in an evolutionary psychology perspective (i.e. recognition of mother's voice/familiar group language from emotionally valent stimuli), some theorists argue that there is more than prosodic recognition in elements of fetal learning. Newer evidence shows that fetuses not only react to the native language differently from nonnative, but furthermore that fetuses react differently and can accurately discriminate between native and nonnative vowels (Moon, Lagercrantz, &amp; Kuhl, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moon|first1=Christine|last2=Lagercrantz|first2=Hugo|last3=Kuhl|first3=Patricia|title=Language experienced in utero affects vowel perception after birth: A two-country study.|journal=Acta Paediatr|date=2013|volume=102|issue=2|pages=156–160|doi=10.1111/apa.12098|pmid=23173548|pmc=3543479}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a new study in 2016 showed that newborn infants encode the edges of multisyllabic sequences better than the internal components of the sequence (Ferry et al., 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferry|first1=Alissa|last2=Fló|first2=Ana|last3=Brusini|first3=Perrine|last4=Cattarossi|first4=Luigi|last5=Macagno|first5=Francesco|last6=Nespor|first6=Marina|last7=Mehler|first7=Jacques|title=On the edge of language acquisition: inherent constraints on encoding multisyllabic sequences in the neonate brain.|journal=Developmental Science|date=2016|volume=19|issue=3|pages=488–503|doi=10.1111/desc.12323|pmid=26190466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these results suggest that newborn infants have learned important properties of syntactic processing in utero, that can be seen in infant knowledge of native language vowels and the sequencing of heard multisyllabic phrases. This ability to sequence specific vowels gives newborn infants some of the fundamental mechanisms needed in order to learn the complex organization of a language. 
From a neuroscientific perspective, there are neural correlates have been found that demonstrate human fetal learning of speech-like auditory stimulus that most other studies have been analyzing (Partanen et al., 2013).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Partanen|first1=Eino|last2=Kujala|first2=Teija|last3=Näätänen|first3=Risto|last4=Litola|first4=Auli|last5=Sambeth|first5=Anke|last6=Huotilainen|first6=Minna|title=Learning-induced neural plasticity of speech processing before birth|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=2013|volume=110|issue=37|pages=15145–15150|doi=10.1073/pnas.1302159110|pmid=23980148|pmc=3773755|bibcode=2013PNAS..11015145P}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by Partanen et al. (2013),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; researchers presented fetuses with certain word variants and saw that these fetuses exhibited higher brain activity to the certain word variants compared to controls. In this same study, there was "a significant correlation existed between the amount of prenatal exposure and brain activity, with greater activity being associated with a higher amount of prenatal speech exposure," pointing to the important learning mechanisms present before birth that is fine-tuned to features in speech (Partanen et al., 2013).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Vocabulary acquisition==

The capacity to acquire the ability to incorporate the pronunciation of new words depends upon many factors. Before anything the learner needs to be able to hear what they are attempting to pronounce. Another is the capacity to engage in [[speech repetition]].&lt;ref name="Bloom 1974"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bloom L.|author2=Hood L.|author3=Lichtbown P.|year=1974|title=Imitation in language: If, when, and why|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=6|issue=3|pages=380–420|oclc=65013247|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(74)90018-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller 1977"&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, George A. |title=Spontaneous apprentices: children and language |publisher=Seabury Press |location=New York |year=1977 |pages= |isbn=978-0-8164-9330-2 |oclc=3002566 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masur 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Masur EF|year=1995|title=Infants' early verbal imitation and their later lexical development|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|volume=41|issue=3|pages=286–306|oclc=89395784}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gathercole 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gathercole SE, Baddeley AD | year = 1989 | title = Evaluation of the role of phonological STM in the development of vocabulary in children, A longitudinal study | url = http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=7251627 | journal = Journal of Memory and Language | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 200–213 | doi = 10.1016/0749-596X(89)90044-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children with reduced abilities to repeat nonwords (a marker of speech repetition abilities) show a slower rate of vocabulary expansion than children for whom this is easy.&lt;ref name="Gathercole 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|year= 2006|url= http://www.york.ac.uk/res/wml/Gathercole06%20Applied%20PsyLinguistics.pdf|doi= 10.1017/S0142716406060383|author= Gathercole SE|title= Nonword repetition and word learning: The nature of the relationship|journal= Applied Psycholinguistics|volume= 27|issue= 4|pages= 513–543|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110605222602/http://www.york.ac.uk/res/wml/Gathercole06%20Applied%20PsyLinguistics.pdf|archivedate= 2011-06-05|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that the elementary units of speech have been selected to enhance the ease with which sound and visual input can be mapped into motor vocalization.&lt;ref name="Skoyles 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9572572|year=1998|last1=Skoyles|first1=JR|title=Speech phones are a replication code|volume=50|issue=2|pages=167–73|journal=Medical Hypotheses|doi=10.1016/S0306-9877(98)90203-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several computational models of vocabulary acquisition have been proposed so far.&lt;ref name="Prahlad"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gupta Prahlad |author2=MacWhinney Brian | year = 1997 | title = Vocabulary acquisition and verbal short-term memory: Computational and neural bases | url = | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 267–333 | doi = 10.1006/brln.1997.1819 | pmid = 9299067 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Regier 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Regier Terry | year = 2003 | title = Emergent constraints on word-learning: A computational review | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 6| pages = 263–268 | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00108-6 | pmid = 12804693 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.330.5309 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Regier 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Regier | first1 = T. | title = The emergence of words: attentional learning in form and meaning | journal = Cogn Sci | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 819–65 |date=Nov 2005 | doi = 10.1207/s15516709cog0000_31 | pmid = 21702796 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.531.1228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hadzibeganovic Tarik |author2=Cannas Sergio A | year = 2009 | title = A Tsallis' statistics based neural network model for novel word learning | url = | journal = Physica A | volume = 388 | issue = 5| pages = 732–746 | doi = 10.1016/j.physa.2008.10.042 | bibcode = 2009PhyA..388..732H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Roy Deb K. |author2=Pentland Alex P. | year = 2002 | title = Learning words from sights and sounds: A computational model | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 113–146 | doi = 10.1207/s15516709cog2601_4 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.61.2924 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fazly Afsaneh |author2=Alishahi Afra |author3=Stevenson Suzanne | year = 2010 | title = A Probabilistic Computational Model of Cross-Situational Word Learning | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 1017–1063 | doi = 10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01104.x | pmid = 21564243 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.639.8919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yu Chen |author2=Ballard Dana H | year = 2007 | title = A unified model of early word learning: Integrating statistical and social cues | url = | journal = Neurocomputing | volume = 70 | issue = 13–15| pages = 2149–2165 | doi = 10.1016/j.neucom.2006.01.034 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.218.7981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various studies have shown that the size of a child's vocabulary by the age of 24 months correlates with the child's future development and language skills. A lack of language richness by this age has detrimental and long-term effects on the child's cognitive development, which is why it is so important for parents to engage their infants in language. If a child knows fifty words or less by the age of 24 months, he or she is classified as a [[Language delay|late-talker]] and future language development, like vocabulary expansion and the organization of grammar, is likely to be slower and stunted.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Two more crucial elements of vocabulary acquisition are word segmentation and statistical learning (described above).  Word segmentation, or the segmentation of words and syllables from fluent speech can be accomplished by eight-month-old infants.&lt;ref name="Saffran 1996 1926–1928"/&gt; By the time infants are 17-months-old, they are able to link meaning to segmented words.&lt;ref name="Graf Estes 2007 254–260"/&gt;

Recent evidence also suggests that motor skills and experiences may influence vocabulary acquisition during infancy. Specifically, learning to sit independently between 3 and 5 months has been found to predict receptive vocabulary at both 10 and 14 months of age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Libertus Klaus |author2=Violi Dominic A | year = 2016 | title = Sit to talk: Relation between motor skills and language development in infancy | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 7| issue = | pages =  475| doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00475 | pmid=27065934|pmc=4815289}}&lt;/ref&gt; and independent walking skills have been found to correlate with language skills around 10 to 14 months of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walle Eric A, Campos Joe J | year = 2014 | title = Infant language development is related to the acquisition of walking | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages =  336–348| doi = 10.1037/a0033238| pmid = 23750505 | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/0h67063p }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=He M, Walle Eric A, Campos Joe J | year = 2015 | title = A cross-national investigation of the relationship between infant walking and language development | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/87b6p4gm| journal = Infancy | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages =  283–305| doi = 10.1111/infa.12071}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings show that language acquisition is an embodied process that is influenced by a child’s overall motor abilities and development.

==Meaning==

Children learn, on average, ten to fifteen new word meanings each day, but only one of these words can be accounted for by direct instruction.&lt;ref name="Landauer"/&gt; The other nine to fourteen word meanings need to be picked up in some other way. It has been proposed that children acquire these meanings with the use of processes modeled by [[latent semantic analysis]]; that is, when they meet an unfamiliar word, children can use information in its context to correctly guess its rough area of meaning.&lt;ref name="Landauer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Landauer | first1 = TK | last2 = Dumais | first2 = ST.  | year = 1997 | title = A solution to Plato's problem: The latent semantic analysis theory of acquisition | url = http://www.edtechpolicy.org/AAASGW/Session2/landauer_article.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 104 | issue = 2| pages = 211–240 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.104.2.211| citeseerx = 10.1.1.184.4759 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A child may expand the meaning and use of certain words that are already part of its [[mental lexicon]] in order to denominate anything that is somehow related but for which it does not know the specific words yet. For instance, a child may broaden the use of ''mummy'' and ''dada'' in order to indicate anything that belongs to its mother or father, or perhaps every person who resembles its own parents, or say ''rain'' while meaning ''I don't want to go out''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Fry, Dennis|year=1977|title=Homo loquens, Man as a talking animal|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages= 115–116|isbn=978-0-521-29239-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also reason to believe that children use various [[heuristic]]s to properly infer the meaning of words. [[Ellen Markman|Markman]] and others have proposed that children assume words to refer to objects with similar properties ("cow" and "pig" might both be "animals") rather than to objects that are thematically related ("cow" and "milk" are probably not both "animals").&lt;ref name="Markman 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markman|first1=Ellen M.|title=Constraints Children Place on Word Meanings|journal=Cognitive Science| volume=14| issue=1| year=1990| pages=57–77| url=http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/1990v14/i01/p0057p0077/MAIN.PDF| doi=10.1207/s15516709cog1401_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children also seem to adhere to the "whole object assumption" and think that a novel label refers to an entire entity rather than one of its parts.&lt;ref name="Markman 1990" /&gt; This assumption along with other resources, such as grammar and morphological cues or lexical constraints, may help aid the child in acquiring word-meaning, but they also conflict some of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hansen|first=Mikkel B.|last2=Markman|first2=Ellen M.|title=Children's use of mutual exclusivity to learn labels for parts of objects.|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=45|issue=2|pages=592–596|doi=10.1037/a0014838|pmid=19271842|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurocognitive research==

According to several linguists, neurocognitive research has confirmed many standards of language learning, such as: "learning engages the entire person (cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains), the human brain seeks patterns in its searching for meaning, emotions affect all aspects of learning, retention and recall, past experience always affects new learning, the brain's working memory has a limited capacity, lecture usually results in the lowest degree of retention, rehearsal is essential for retention, practice [alone] does not make perfect, and each brain is unique" (Sousa, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;274). In terms of genetics, the gene [[ROBO1]] has been associated with phonological buffer integrity or length.&lt;ref name="Bates 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Bates | first1 = TC. | last2 = Luciano | first2 = M. | last3 = Medland | first3 = SE. | last4 = Montgomery | first4 = GW. | last5 = Wright | first5 = MJ. | last6 = Martin | first6 = NG. | title = Genetic variance in a component of the language acquisition device: ROBO1 polymorphisms associated with phonological buffer deficits | journal = Behav Genet | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 50–7 |date=Jan 2011 | doi = 10.1007/s10519-010-9402-9 | pmid = 20949370 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is difficult to determine without invasive measures which exact parts of the brain become most active and important for language acquisition, [[fMRI]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] technology has allowed for some conclusions to be made about where language may be centered. [[Kuniyoshi Sakai]] proposed, based on several neuroimaging studies, that there may be a "grammar center", where language is primarily processed in the left lateral [[premotor cortex]] (located near the pre central sulcus and the [[inferior frontal sulcus]]). Additionally, these studies proposed that first language and second-language acquisition may be represented differently in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]].&lt;ref name="Sakai, 2005"/&gt;
In a study conducted by Newman et al., the relationship between cognitive neuroscience and language acquisition was compared through a standardized test procedure involving native speakers of English and native Spanish speakers who have all had a similar amount of exposure to the English language(averaging about 26 years). Even the number of times an examinee blinked was taken into account during the examination process. It was concluded that the brain does in fact process languages differently, but instead of it being directly related to proficiency levels, it is more so about how the brain processes language itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Newman | first1 = A.

During early infancy, language processing seems to occur over many areas in the brain. However, over time, it gradually becomes concentrated into two areas – [[Broca's area]] and [[Wernicke's area]]. Broca's area is in the left [[frontal cortex]] and is primarily involved in the production of the patterns in vocal and sign language.

==As a typically human phenomenon==
The capacity to acquire and use language is a key aspect that distinguishes [[FOXP2 and human evolution|humans]] from other beings. Although it is difficult to pin down what aspects of language are uniquely human, there are a few design features that can be found in all known forms of human language, but that are missing from forms of [[animal communication]]. For example, many animals are able to communicate with each other by signaling to the things around them, but this kind of communication lacks the arbitrariness of human vernaculars (in that there is nothing about the sound of the word "dog" that would hint at its meaning). Other forms of animal communication may utilize arbitrary sounds, but are unable to combine those sounds in different ways to create completely novel messages that can then be automatically understood by another. [[Charles F. Hockett|Hockett]] called this design feature of human language "productivity". It is crucial to the understanding of human language acquisition that we are not limited to a finite set of words, but, rather, must be able to understand and utilize a complex system that allows for an infinite number of possible messages. So, while many forms of animal communication exist, they differ from human languages in that they have a limited range of vocabulary tokens, and the vocabulary items are not combined syntactically to create phrases.&lt;ref name="=Tomasello, 2008"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tomasello, Michael |title=Origins of human communication |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=978-0-262-20177-3 |oclc=439979810 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelingual deafness==
{{Main|prelingual deafness}}{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}

Prelingual deafness is defined as hearing loss that occurred at birth or before an individual has learned to speak. In the United States, 2 to 3 out of every 1000 children are born deaf or hard of hearing. Even though it might be presumed that deaf children acquire language in different ways since they are not receiving the same auditory input as hearing children, many research findings indicate that deaf children acquire language in the same way that hearing children do and when given the proper language input, understand and express language just as well as their hearing peers. Babies who learn sign language produce signs or gestures that are more regular and more frequent than hearing babies acquiring spoken language. Just as hearing babies babble, deaf babies acquiring sign language will babble with their hands, otherwise known as [[manual babbling]]. Therefore, as many studies have shown, [[language acquisition by deaf children]] parallel the language acquisition of a spoken language by hearing children because humans are biologically equipped for language regardless of the modality.

=== Signed Language Acquisition ===
Deaf children's visual-manual language acquisition not only parallel spoken language acquisition but by the age of 30 months, most deaf children that were exposed to a visual language had a more advanced grasp with subject-pronoun copy rules than hearing children. Their vocabulary bank at the ages of 12–17 months exceed that of a hearing child's, though it does even out when they reach the two-word stage. The use of space for absent referents and the more complex handshapes in some signs prove to be difficult for children between 5 and 9 years of age because of motor development and the complexity of remembering the spacial use.  Despite certain myths about deaf children signing, their acquisition of a signed language not only develops normally, it exceeds that of a hearing child's at certain points.

=== Cochlear Implants ===
Other options besides sign language for kids with prelingual deafness include the use hearing aids to strengthen remaining sensory cells or [[cochlear implant]]s to stimulate the hearing nerve directly. Cochlear Implants are hearing devices that are placed behind the ear and contain a receiver and electrodes which are placed under the skin and inside the cochlea. Despite these developments, there is still a risk that prelingually deaf children are may not develop good speech and speech reception skills. Although cochlear implants produce sounds, they are unlike typical hearing and deaf and hard of hearing people must undergo intensive therapy in order to learn how to interpret these sounds. They must also learn how to speak given the range of hearing they may or may not have. However, deaf children of deaf parents tend to do better with language, even though they are isolated from sound and speech because their language uses a different mode of communication that is accessible to them; the visual modality of language.

Although cochlear implants were initially approved for adults, now there is pressure to implant children early in order to maximize auditory skills for mainstream learning which in turn has created controversy around the topic. Due to recent advances in technology, cochlear implants allow some deaf people to acquire some sense of hearing. There are interior and exposed exterior components that are surgically implanted. Those who receive cochlear implants earlier on in life show more improvement on speech comprehension and language. Spoken language development does vary widely for those with cochlear implants though due to a number of different factors including: age at implantation, frequency, quality and type of speech training. Some evidence suggests that speech processing occurs at a more rapid pace in some prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants than those with traditional hearing aids. However, cochlear implants may not always work.

Research shows that people develop better language with a cochlear implant when they have a solid first language to rely on to understand the second language they would be learning. In the case of prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants, a signed language, like [[American Sign Language]] would be an accessible language for them to learn to help support the use of the cochlear implant as they learn a spoken language as their L2. Without a solid, accessible first language, these children run the risk of language deprivation, especially in the case that a cochlear implant fails to work. They would have no access to sound, meaning no access to the spoken language they are supposed to be learning. If a signed language was not a strong language for them to use and neither was a spoken language, they now have no access to any language and run the risk of missing their [[Critical period]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11330">'''Language exposure''' is the act of making language readily available to children during the critical early years of [[language learning]]. The theory of the [[Critical period hypothesis|critical period]] for language exposure states that there is a certain window where children are able to and must learn a [[first language]], or multiple languages.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This exposure allows the brain to fully develop linguistic skills and leads to [[language fluency]] and [[language comprehension|comprehension]] later in life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Mayberry, Rachel I. "Early language acquisition and adult language ability: What sign language reveals about the critical."&amp;nbsp;The Oxford handbook of deaf studies, language, and education&amp;nbsp;2 (2010): 281.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Much of the research on language exposure, the critical period, and [[language acquisition]] are based on spoken languages and children who are hearing. In reality, these same ideas translate to deaf children as well. Language exposure is essential during the critical period for language acquisition for all children. Deaf children tend to face more hardships when it comes to ensuring that they will receive this input of language in formative years.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Language and development==
[[American Sign Language]] has only fairly recently been recognized as an official language. This recognition came about with research done around the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libguides.gallaudet.edu/content.php?pid=114804&amp;sid=991858|title=LibGuides. Sign Language. ASL: Academic acceptance and official recognition.|last=Henry|first=Sarah Hamrick, Laura Jacobi, Patrick Oberholtzer, Elizabeth|website=libguides.gallaudet.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; that proved that signed languages are in fact technical languages, with structure and [[grammar]] to match that of spoken language.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Meier, Richard P. "Language acquisition by deaf children."&amp;nbsp;American Scientist&amp;nbsp;79.1 (1991): 60-70.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, manual and verbal languages are all indeed full languages, with common properties like [[syntax]] and grammar. They both also use the same area of the brain in the [[left hemisphere]]. For years it was known that the left hemisphere dealt with speech, but now it is specifically the details of language organization that seem to be processed here.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Petitto, Laura Ann, et al. "Speech-like cerebral activity in profoundly deaf people processing signed languages: implications for the neural basis of human language."&amp;nbsp;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&amp;nbsp;97.25 (2000): 13961-13966.&lt;/ref&gt;

The deaf brain develops at the same rate as the hearing brain when learning language. Deaf babies [[Babbling|babble]] on their hands the same way hearing babies babble with their mouths,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and they acquire language in the same timeframe. This is true neurologically and behaviorally. In both areas they hit the same milestones around the same times.

Developments other than linguistic development, such as [[cognitive development]]s, actually develop independent of whether or not the deaf child is exposed to, learns, or develops language at all. Deaf children's bodies and minds develop normally outside of language ability.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Mayberry, Rachel I. "Cognitive development in deaf children: The interface of language and perception in neuropsychology."&amp;nbsp;''Handbook of neuropsychology''&amp;nbsp;8.Part II (2002): 71-107.
&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the lack of exposure to language, although independent of other developmental processes, is a problem for many deaf children, as language development is still crucial. Deaf children are an at-risk population for not receiving language during the critical period for learning language. This can be due to schooling options, their parent's inability to communicate, or lack of continuous and unlimited exposure to [[sign language]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Humphries, Tom, et al. "Ensuring language acquisition for deaf children: What linguists can do."&amp;nbsp;Language&amp;nbsp;90.2 (2014): e31-e52.&lt;/ref&gt; The cognitive, neurological, and regular development of children who happen to be deaf is completely normal. It is only that their access to an input language that is much more limited in comparison to a child learning a spoken language. This is due to the mainly hearing world we live in. However, if deaf children do receive that language acquisition during the critical period of language learning in the way that they're supposed to, the [[sensory loss]] of not being able to hear is not debilitating or harmful to their development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Providing language exposure ==
=== From birth ===

About 90% of deaf or hard of hearing children are born to hearing parents. Only 10% are born to deaf parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing|title=Quick Statistics About Hearing|date=2015-08-18|work=NIDCD|access-date=2017-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore only about 10% of deaf children have language exposure in their natural form of communication, without restriction, from birth. When a child is born deaf or hard of hearing, there are newborn hearing [[Newborn screening|screening]] practices that inform the parents whether or not the baby has [[hearing loss]] within the first few weeks after the baby is born. If a baby is diagnosed with hearing loss, hospitals usually provide access to a team that includes primary care physicians, audiologists, and other health care providers to help the family decide which path is most appropriate for their family or their child to ensure that the baby develops normally with language. However, some physicians report that they aren't confident about informing the parents of children who have hearing loss about the potential choices for their child&lt;ref&gt;Moeller, Mary Pat; Karl R. White; and Lenore Shisler. 2006. Primary care physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to newborn hearing screening. Pediatrics 118.1357–70.&lt;/ref&gt; other than just referring them to an audiologist. Based on that, there seems to be a lack of knowledge and education about the Deaf community for physicians and families alike.  

=== Cochlear implants and exposure ===

Many doctors recommend families with babies diagnosed with hearing loss see an [[audiologist]]. On one hand, people view this referral as an attempt to fix the pathological problem of hearing loss. On the other hand, some people view the referral and denial of allowing the baby to stay deaf as an intrusion on the child's potential life in the Deaf community. This is because audiologists specializes in the perception of sound. This could lead to ignoring the possibility that the child just may need someone to help them thrive in the Deaf community. Recently, there has been heated debate over research on [[cochlear implant]]s. This surgery is a common recommendation for children born deaf or hard of hearing, in order to attempt to get the child to hear, understand, and use spoken language rather than sign language. The debate mostly centers around the view that deafness is a problem that needs to be fixed. Members of the Deaf community, proud of their culture and language, see this as an insult and excessive means of forced conformity to the hearing world. Others view it as a very real possibility to open doors and give children the opportunity to function with more accessibility in a hearing society. In regards to language exposure, there has been recent research&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Karl R.|last2=Cooper|first2=Louis Z.|date=2017-07-01|title=Opportunities and Shared Decision-Making to Help Children Who Are Deaf to Communicate|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/140/1/e20171287|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=140|issue=1|pages=e20171287|doi=10.1542/peds.2017-1287|issn=0031-4005}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing that when given a cochlear implant, a child's use of only spoken language leads to higher intellectual development results in comparison to children who mix spoken language learning with sign language as well. However, this research&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; does note that they haven't studied children of parents who use sign language fluently, and give their child unlimited exposure to sign. 

=== Grade school ===

Unlimited language exposure includes having education options available in one's own language. The [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] states that a public education should be provided to each child with a disability in the "least restrictive environment" for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ada.gov/cguide.htm#anchor65310|title=A Guide to Disability Rights Laws|website=www.ada.gov|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a broad statement, this is up to interpretation. Often this means that children with hearing loss get access to public schools with an interpreter. The qualifications of this interpreter are required, but since they are not stated specifically, usually [[K-12]] interpreters aren't the most qualified to be teaching a child, as those qualifications mean those interpreters are more expensive for schools to provide. Additionally, going to a public school that is a majority of hearing students isolates the deaf child and does not provide unlimited access to their language. There are few schools that teach all in sign language, such as [[The Learning Center for the Deaf]] in Framingham, MA. Other deaf schools may teach in an [[oralist]] method, prohibiting signing and focusing only on speech, a [[Total Communication|total communication]] method, with a [[Contact sign|pidgin sign language]] accompanying a speaking teacher, also known as [[simultaneous communication]], and a [[bilingual]] approach that includes both sign and speech, but in a separated way.&lt;ref&gt;Gascon-Ramos, M. (2008). Wellbeing in deaf children: A framework of understanding.&amp;nbsp;''Educational &amp; Child Psychology'',&amp;nbsp;''25''(2), 57-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later language ability ==
There has been other research&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; done about fluent sign language users and their ability to pick up spoken language later in life. The results show that sign language as a first language produces equal language skills later on in life, whether it be reading, learning a second language, or basic linguistic skills, as long as it is learned in the critical period of language acquisition. 

Additionally, learning sign language alongside another language has been proven to produce the same development as a bilingual child who learns two spoken languages.&lt;ref&gt;Petitto, Laura Ann, et al. "Bilingual signed and spoken language acquisition from birth: Implications for the mechanisms underlying early bilingual language acquisition."&amp;nbsp;Journal of child language&amp;nbsp;28.2 (2001): 453-496.&lt;/ref&gt; This furthers the idea that exposing a child to sign language is comparable to exposing a child to spoken language. Again, the criteria for both of these languages being that they are learned during the critical period and with full exposure to learn the language fluently. When any language is learned in this way, language development is the same across the board.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9468">[[File:Maitum anthropomorphic jar (sketch).jpg|thumb|Sketch of an anthropomorphic jar]]

In 1991, the National Museum archaeological team discovered [[anthropomorphic]] [[secondary burial]] jars in Ayub Cave, Barangay Pinol, [[Maitum, Sarangani|Maitum, Sarangani Province]], Mindanao, Philippines. The jars are commonly known today as '''Maitum jars'''. They are made of [[earthenware]], and are characterized by their design that suggests human figures with complete or partial facial features of the first inhabitants in Mindanao. Furthermore, they give emphasis to the Filipinos’ popular belief of life after death.

According to [http://asp.upd.edu.ph/faculty/eusebiodizon.html Dr. Eusebio Dizon], head of the archaeological team, this type of burial jars are “remarkably unique and intriguing” because they have not been found elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Thus, many [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] from Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia, Burma and Indonesia gained interest on this initial find and a number of archaeological - either government or privately sponsored - [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] have been conducted to recover these artifacts.

These jars have characteristics that belong to the Developed Metal Age Period in the Philippines [calibrated date of 190 BC to 500 AD]. According to the laboratory results determined through [[radiocarbon dating]], these secondary burial jars date back to the [[Iron Age|Metal Age]]. Two conventional dates were 1830 +/-60 B.P. [calibrated date of AD 70 to 370] and 1920 +/- 50 B.P. [calibrated date of 5 BC to 225 AD]. Experts used [[soot]] samples taken from the walls of a small earthenware vessel found inside one of the larger burial jars.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Faces from Maitum: The archaeological excavation of Ayub Cave|last = Dizon|first = E.|publisher = National Museum of the Philippines|year = 1996|isbn = |location = Manila|pages = xi–xii, 51–53, 56–59, 73, 78–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of the Maitum Jars==

The information about “potteries bearing human forms encountered while treasure hunting for Pacific War treasures” was shared through a phone call, on June 3, 1991, between a consulting geologist named Michael Spadafora and an archaeologist named Dr. Eusebio Dizon. Three days after, the archaeologist received photographs of exceptional artifacts collected by local residents. The artifacts have high probability of significance not only to the history of [[Maguindanao]], but also to the entire [[Prehistory of the Philippines|Philippine prehistory]]. That’s why when they found a fund sponsor for Dr. Dizon’s trip to [[Mindanao]], he still went despite the unpredictable climate and safety risks.

The Maitum Archaeological Project of the National Museum team formally started on November 6, 1991. Ayub Cave, now referred to as Pinol Cave, is a [[Miocene]] [[limestone]] formation located approximately 1,000 meters due south of the Mindanao shoreline with an [[elevation]] of 6 meters. The site is on the [[Coast|coastal area]] of Pinol, Maitum (formerly a part of South Cotobato Province), Sarangani. The first phase of the excavation ended on December 1991, the second was from April 8 to May 3, 1992, and the third and final phase was from January 17 to February 15, 1995.

Unfortunately, the [[Moro Conflict|conflict]] between the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] and the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front|Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)]] during the 70’s resulted in irreversible casualties in this historical site. It threatened future discoveries and prevented preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://asiancorrespondent.com/2008/11/maitum-jars-the-other-casualty-of-the-war-in-mindanao/|title = Maitum jar: The other casualty of the war in Mindanao|date = November 4, 2008|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Espejo|first = E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; No complete Maitum jar in the form of a female has survived, but there are still evidence of its existence such as the many pottery shards of female breasts. This is an indication of equality in terms of the practice of [[jar burial]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Introduction. Fire in the hearth: Overview of prehistoric Philippine pottery with reference to burial jars.|last = Gatbonton|first = E.|publisher = National Museum of the Philippines|year = n.d.|isbn = |location = Manila|pages = 1, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altogether, a total of 29 burial jars and approximately 33 baskets or about 4 cubic meters of archaeological material have been collected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most of them are now in the possession and care of the National Museum while some are on display at the second level of Maitum Municipal Hall in an exhibit called as "The Treasures of Maitum". And because of its significance the Pinol Cave was declared by the [[National Museum of the Philippines]] as an “Important Cultural Property” on May 5, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.libotero.com/treasures-maitum-sarangani/|title = The treasures of Maitum, Sarangani|date = October 14, 2012|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Pineda|first = S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical Characteristics==
[[File:Maitum Jar with red face.png|thumb|150px|left|Another design of a Maitum jars with a red paint on the face ]].
Even though the burial jars are similar to that of the pottery found in Kulaman Plateau, Southern Mindanao and many more excavation sites here in the Philippines, what makes the Maitum jars uniquely different is how the anthropomorphic features depict “specific dead persons whose remains they guard”.

So far, there have been four classified kinds of cover and lid: (1) Anthropomorphic motif or head, (2) Trunconical with simple appliquéd design, (3) Simple ovaloid with four ear handles, and (4) Trunconical with adz shape and round spinning shape motif. While there are three types of heads: (1) Plain, (2) Perforated, and (3) Painted red and black from [[hematite]] and organic material.  The black paint may indicate where the hair of the dead has once been.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some jars are decorated with [[Glass beadmaking|glass beads]] and shell scoops, spoons and [[pendant]]s. All of these features represent and reflect the Maitum potters’ creativity and thinking abilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Heads===

The heads of the anthropomorphic covers portray different facial expressions and emotions, ranging from happiness and contentment to sadness and grief. Other heads also display full sets of teeth; others appear to be toothless (way by which the chin and lips recede).
 
The method of shaping the head is rather similar from the standard potting technique of creating a round pot with a high or long neck. The presence of paint may be an indication of status, while the size of the heads is an indication of age.

===Eyes===

Since the eyes are believed to be expressive, the eyes portrayed in Maitum jars are given high regard in describing the dead. The eyes are classified to four major shapes: (1) Almond, (2) Ovaloid, (3) Round, and (4) Rectangular.

There is also a variation between the eyelids of different individuals. Some are incised, appliquéd, protruding and flat. In addition, some eyes are ringed with black hematite paints.

===Ears===

The ears either have (1) a hole in the center or (2) an ovaloid shape with an extended curl. In the former style, the upper outer ear is formed into an ovaloid shaped with a hole in the center while the lower outer ear is formed by a lobe. On the other hand, the latter style explains the formation of the upper outer ear into an ovaloid shape with an extended curl going inside and the lower outer part consisting of the earlobe.

===Nose===

The base of the nose are either (1) Triangular, (2) Concave, (3) Beaklike, or (4) Bulbous.

===Mouth===

The mouth is generally distinguished by how many teeth are showing. Some mouth hold (1) two rows of incised teeth, (2) one row of incised teeth, (3) two rows of teeth and tongue, (4) row of teeth with holes on each base, or (5) one row of teeth with a hole in the middle of each tooth. To several who have no teeth, the feature is only a gaping hole with a tongue.

===Arms and Hands===

The most common type of arms and hands are appliquéd and [[Molding (process)|molded]]. These human-like forms were associated with metal implements like [[bracelet]]s.

===Breasts===

These feature were either applied or molded, and may be classified into male or female breasts with other qualities that may give hints on the age of the dead. To differentiate, male breasts are usually molded marked by a light curve topped with a nipple. On the other hand, several of the female breasts have no nipples distinguished by a shallow protrusion, and slightly sloping.

===Measurements===

The obtained measurements of Maitum jars without its anthropomorphic lid has the height of 43.5&amp;nbsp;cm, widest diameter of 36&amp;nbsp;cm, widest mouth diameter of 30&amp;nbsp;cm and a thickness of 0.7&amp;nbsp;cm. The shape was more of the torso of a male body. From the shoulder to the elbow, the arms measure 12&amp;nbsp;cm and, consequently, 17&amp;nbsp;cm from the elbow to the fingers. Along with its cover, the burial jar is noted to have a total height of 70&amp;nbsp;cm.

'''Mary, Untier of Knots''' or '''Mary, Undoer of Knots''' is the name of both a [[Marian devotions|Marian devotion]] and a [[Baroque]] painting ([[German language|German]]: ''Wallfahrtsbild'' or ''Gnadenbild'') which represents that devotion. The painting by [[Johann Georg Melchior Schmidtner]], of around&amp;nbsp;1700, is in the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[pilgrimage church]] of [[St. Peter am Perlach|St.&amp;nbsp;Peter am Perlach]], otherwise known as the Perlach church, in [[Augsburg]], [[Bavaria]], Germany. [[Pope Francis]] saw the image while in Germany as a student and promoted her veneration in Latin America.

==Painting==
The painting, executed in the Baroque style by Johann Georg Melchior Schmidtner (1625-1707), shows the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] standing on the crescent moon (the usual way of depicting Mary under her title of the [[Immaculate Conception]]), surrounded by angels and with the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] in the form of a [[dove]] hovering above her [[circle of stars]] as she unties knots into a long strip and at the same time rests her foot on the head of a "knotted" snake. The serpent represents the [[devil]], and her treatment of him fulfills the prophecy in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]&amp;nbsp;3:15: "I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."&lt;ref&gt;Douay-Rheims Bible, 1899 Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are shown a human figure and his dog accompanying a much smaller angel. This scene is often interpreted as [[Tobias]] with his dog and the [[Archangel]] [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]] traveling to ask Sara to be his wife.&lt;ref name=dayton&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Devotion to Mary, Untier of Knots|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/resources/MaryUntierKnots/UntierKnots.html|work=A Dictionary of Mary|author=Richard Lenar|publisher=University of Dayton|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Mary untying knots is derived from a work by St.&amp;nbsp;[[Irenaeus]] of Lyons, ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'' (''Against Heresies''). In Book&amp;nbsp;III, Chapter&amp;nbsp;22, he presents a parallel between [[Eve]] and Mary, describing how "the knot of Eve's disobedience was loosed by the obedience of Mary. For what the virgin Eve had bound fast through unbelief, this did the virgin Mary set free through faith."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103322.htm Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III, 22]&lt;/ref&gt;

The two small figures have also been interpreted as a representation of Wolfgang Langenmantel, the grandfather of the benefactor, guided in his distress by a [[guardian angel]] to Father [[Jakob Rem]] in [[Ingolstadt]].&lt;ref name=dayton /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Augsburg-Perlachkirche.jpg|thumb|160px|[[St. Peter am Perlach|St. Peter’s Church]] with the [[Perlachturm|Perlach-Tower]]]]
The painting was donated around 1700 by Hieronymus Ambrosius Langenmantel (1641-1718),&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [[:de:Hieronymus Ambrosius Langenmantel|“Hieronymus Ambrosius Langenmantel”]], ''Wikipedia:  Die freie Enzyklopädie''. Retrieved 16 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of the [[Monastery]] of [[Saint Peter]] in Augsburg. The donation is said to be connected with an event in his family.  His grandfather Wolfgang Langenmantel (1586-1637) was on the verge of the separation from his wife Sophia Rentz (1590-1649) and therefore sought help from Jakob Rem, the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest in Ingolstadt. Father Rem prayed to the Blessed Virgin Mary and said: "''In diesem religiösen Akt erhebe ich das Band der Ehe, löse alle Knoten und glätte es'' [In this religious act, I raise the bonds of matrimony, to untie all knots and smoothen them]".  Immediately peace was restored between the husband and wife, and the separation did not happen.  In the memory of this event, their grandson commissioned the painting of the "Untier of Knots".

==Devotion==
The first Chapel to be named "Mary, Untier of Knots" was completed in 1989 in [[Styria]], Austria, inspired as a supplication in response to the [[Chernobyl]] Nuclear Tragedy.&lt;ref name=fraternity&gt;International Fraternity of the Virgin Mary Untier of Knots, "[http://www.desatadora.com.ar/xlista-i.htm List of Churches, Chapels and Places] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628192405/http://www.desatadora.com.ar/xlista-i.htm |date=28 June 2012 }} where the Virgin Mary, Untier of Knots is venerated [as] Maria Knotenlöserin".  Retrieved 16 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The image of "Mary, Undoer of Knots" is especially venerated in [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]],&lt;ref name=dayton /&gt; where churches have been named for her and devotion to her has become widespread and which the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' called a "religious craze".&lt;ref name=bellos&gt;{{cite news|last=Bellos|first=Alex|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/dec/24/alexbellos|title=Virgin painting ties Brazilians in knots|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian (UK)|date=23 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[Catholic devotions|Catholic devotion]] has grown since [[Pope Francis|Jorge Mario Bergoglio]], S.J. (who would later become Pope Francis, after a tenure as Archbishop of Buenos Aires), brought a postcard of the painting to Argentina in the 1980s after seeing the original while studying in Germany.&lt;ref name=chalice&gt;{{cite news|last=Jiménez |first=Pablo |title=The Pope's chalice: silver-made, austere and featuring Our Lady of Luján |url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/126383/the-popes-chalice-silvermade-austere-and-featuring-our-lady-of-luj%C3%A1n |accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=Buenos Aires Herald|date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article114452124/Bergoglio-studierte-einst-in-Frankfurt-am-Main.html "''Bergoglio studierte einst in Frankfurt am Main'' &amp;#91;Bergoglio once studied in Frankfurt am Main"&amp;#93;] - (''[[Die Welt]]'', 14 March 2013, Online Edition).&lt;/ref&gt; The devotion reached Brazil near the end of the 20th century. According to Regina Novaes, of the Institute of Religious Studies in Rio de Janeiro, Mary, Untier of Knots "attracts people with small problems".&lt;ref name=bellos/&gt; Bergoglio had this image of Mary engraved on a chalice he presented to [[Pope Benedict XVI]] and another chalice bearing her image, the work of the same silversmith, is to be presented to Pope Francis on behalf of the Argentine people.&lt;ref name=chalice /&gt;

'''''Memnoch the Devil''''' (1995) is a horror novel by American writer  [[Anne Rice]], the fifth in her ''[[The Vampire Chronicles|Vampire Chronicles]]'' series, following ''[[The Tale of the Body Thief]]''. Many of the themes of this novel and in large part the title are re-borrowed from the 19th Century gothic novel [[Melmoth the Wanderer]] by Irish author [[Charles Maturin]]. In this story, [[Lestat de Lioncourt|Lestat]] is approached by the [[Devil]] and offered a job at his side.


After stalking and killing Roger, a ruthless but enthrallingly passionate [[mobster]], Lestat is approached by Roger's ghost. Roger's ghost asks him to take care of his daughter Dora, a devout and popular [[television]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]], whom he wants to spare from embarrassment. At the same time, Lestat has become increasingly paranoid that he's being stalked by a powerful force.

Eventually, Lestat meets the Devil, who calls himself Memnoch. He takes Lestat on a whirlwind tour of [[Heaven]], [[Hell]] and retells of the entirety of history from his own point of view in an effort to convince Lestat to join him as God's adversary. In his journey, Memnoch claims he is not evil, but merely working for [[God]] by ushering lost souls into Heaven. Lestat is left in confusion, unable to decide whether or not to cast his lot with the Devil.

After the tour, Lestat believes himself to have had a major [[revelation]]. Among other things, he believes that he has seen [[Christ]]'s [[crucifixion]] and that he has received [[Veil of Veronica|Saint Veronica's Veil]]. He has also lost an eye in Hell. Even though Lestat suspects the entire experience was some kind of deception, he tells his story to [[Armand (The Vampire Chronicles)|Armand]], [[David Talbot (The Vampire Chronicles)|David Talbot]] and Dora, who have joined him in [[New York City]]. When Lestat produces the veil as proof of his experience, Dora and Armand are deeply moved upon seeing it. Dora takes it and reveals it to the world, triggering a religious movement.  Armand goes into the sunlight and immolates himself in order to convince people that a [[miracle]] has occurred.

At the end of the novel, Lestat and David go to [[New Orleans]]. There, [[Maharet and Mekare|Maharet]] returns Lestat's eye to him, along with a note from Memnoch that reveals Memnoch may have been manipulating Lestat to serve his own agenda. Lestat then loses control of himself and Maharet is forced to chain him in the basement of the St. Elizabeth's [[convent]], which is owned by the [[vampire]]s, so that he will not hurt himself or others.

Although the novel fits into the storyline of ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]'', the vast majority of it consists of Memnoch's account of [[cosmology]] and [[theology]].

The novel follows up on claims made by David Talbot in ''[[The Tale of the Body Thief]]'' that God and the Devil are on better terms than most [[Christians]] believe. It also reinterprets [[Bible|biblical]] stories to create a complete history of Earth, Heaven and Hell that fit neatly with the history of vampires given in ''[[The Queen of the Damned]]''.

==Characters==

'''[[Lestat de Lioncourt]]''' – The main character of the story and the past four books, Lestat was created by a powerful vampire named Magnus, who promptly cremated himself after creating his heir. Lestat is a relatively "good" vampire, only feeding on those he deems evil after reading their minds. In previous books, Lestat made the man named David Talbot a vampire by force, an action that went against vampire law.

'''Theodora''', nicknamed "'''Dora'''" – A devout Christian who has a cable TV show. She is very beautiful and charismatic. She is waiting for a miracle to inspire her.  Dora is the daughter of Roger. She won't take anything from Roger because he is a mobster. Lestat becomes obsessed with her in the process of hunting her father. Despite the warnings of his vampire kin, he reveals himself to her and she takes it as the miracle she's been awaiting. When Lestat brings her Veronica's veil, Dora starts her own religion.

'''Roger''' – Dora's father. A mobster who runs a successful drug ring selling [[cocaine]]. When Dora's mother tried to take full custody over her, Roger killed her. After his death, he haunts Lestat, describing his own life and commanding Lestat to watch over Dora from then on.

'''God''' – Creator and ruler of the universe and all angels. According to Memnoch, he does not know how he came to be and therefore created the universe and life in an attempt to better understand himself.  In telling his account of creation, Memnoch characterizes God as aloof and uncaring.

'''Memnoch the Devil''' – The fallen angel of legend also known as Satan or Lucifer. He has long defied God in asking why humans should suffer and not immediately be placed in Heaven. Because of these questions and other actions that he makes, he alleges that he is put in charge of preparing the souls for their ascent into Heaven. Memnoch's domain thus serves as a place of punishment that will eventually earn access to Heaven. He may have sinister ulterior motives. In the novel Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis, it is alluded to that Memnoch may have been an inhuman spirit that dwelled in the place between the physical realm and Heaven.

== Cosmology ==
The universe as revealed to Lestat by the Devil follows the following cosmology:

God is a powerful and immortal being worshiped by [[angels]], His first creation, since before the existence of matter and time. The [[Earth]] was his creation. Because of this, angels spent much time admiring His handiwork and singing His praises. However, God does not appear to be [[omniscient]] or even entirely omnibenevolent. Despite assurances, Memnoch, an archangel, claims to have changed God's opinion on the importance and supernatural quality of humanity.

Through [[evolution]], creatures on the Earth developed into the image of God and angels and a "flame" of life which allowed pain and death. Eventually, humans developed their own [[souls]], invisible and incorporeal spiritual essences similar to God and the angels. This shocks and horrifies many of the angels. These souls collect in confusion around the world in an airy realm that the angels describe as "[[Sheol]]" or the Gloom, attempting to come to terms with their existence. Some dissipate into nothing, some do not realize or do not accept they are dead. Some take comfort and strength from their living descendants, becoming patron ancestors. Such interventions cause the tales of spirits, reincarnation and the first vampires.

The addle-brained spirits (mentioned in ''[[The Queen of the Damned]]'' and ''[[The Witching Hour (novel)|The Witching Hour]]'') are of two types. The first are angels who fell in love with certain parts of nature became spirits of rocks, mountains, and trees; they did not return to Heaven. The "invisible ones" are incorporeal human souls who never interacted with the angels, forgot they were ever human, and become demons—spirits or lesser gods whom the living worship.

Memnoch becomes impatient with God's constant assurances that all is well, despite the pain and suffering of life and death. Memnoch vehemently criticizes God's plan, accusing God of lacking vision and benevolence. Memnoch decides to collect evidence to persuade God that humanity is outside of nature by creating physical form.  When, as part of this, he experiences [[sex]], God bans Memnoch from heaven; Memnoch spends the next three months imparting his vast knowledge of science to humanity, thus inadvertently founding civilization, during which time Memnoch realizes that the characteristic that sets humans apart is their ability to love and feel passionate.

When God invites Memnoch to Heaven to explain his disturbance of the natural order of creation, Memnoch persuades God to allow him to find souls who are suitable for Heaven. After thousands of years wandering Sheol, Memnoch discovers an especially powerful group of souls who have forgiven God for his indifference and absence and appreciate the grandness of all creation. God accepts these souls into Heaven, permanently changing it forever.

God is highly pleased with the new composition of Heaven, but Memnoch continues to accuse God of not showing concern for the other souls of Sheol. Memnoch finally loses trust in God and demands that He should take human form to understand passion and, in fury, God banishes Memnoch from Heaven.

While Memnoch is in exile, God takes on a human form, [[Jesus]]. God believes that by appearing in human form, performing miracles, suffering and dying, he will create a [[religion]] that will allow more humans to attain the love of God by suffering and sacrifice. This is in sharp contrast to Memnoch's approach of attaining purity through love and experience of the wonders of creation.  The two confront each other in the desert. God continuously argues that Man is a creature of Nature and ruled by its laws; only through suffering and death can man evolve and eventually be worthy of Heaven. Memnoch continuously argues that suffering and death has no value, and Man needlessly suffers in Life and in Sheol while already worthy of God's light yet deprived of knowing Him.

Memnoch is awed and shocked by God's sacrifice. Nevertheless, he argues that God did not put himself through enough. Unlike a regular human, when God died on the cross he knew that he would survive and thus could never have known the true suffering of Man: the fear of death. Man does not know his immortal soul will survive for all eternity, and thus suffers from fear of the unknown. God knew he would survive death and could not truly know what it was to be a human. For God, this complaint is the last straw: He declares Memnoch to be his adversary, and commands him to rule Sheol and Earth in a devilish form, preparing souls for Heaven in his own fashion.

As human history progresses, God's religion only exacerbates the suffering of Man instead of alleviating it. Acts of hate—war, persecution, genocide—are carried out in His name. Working in Sheol, Memnoch creates a form of Hell, a place where people who have been bad in life, will be punished until their souls are able to forgive all (themselves, each other, and God) for the suffering and ignorance they endured in order to understand the joy of creation and the light of God enough to be ready for Heaven. Memnoch doesn't like this work and is constantly asking God to appoint someone else to the job (as David Talbot witnesses in ''The Tale of the Body Thief'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2678">A '''memory institution''' is an organization maintaining a ''repository of public knowledge'', a generic term used about institutions such as libraries, archives, museums, [[sites and monuments record]]s (SMR), clearinghouses, providers of [[digital libraries]] and [[data aggregation]] services which serve as memories for given societies or mankind. Increasingly such institutions are considered as a part of a unified [[documentation science|documentation]]/[[information science]] perspective.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

[[Lorcan Dempsey]] may have introduced the term into popular use in [[library and information science]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dempsey |first=Lorcan |date=1999 |title=Scientific, Industrial, and Cultural Heritage: A Shared Approach |url=http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue22/dempsey/ |journal=Ariadne |volume=5 |issue=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; although others, such as Joan Schwarz, used it earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwarz |first1=Joan M. |date=1995 |title="We make our tools and our tools make us": Lessons from Photographs for the Practice, Politics, and Poetics of Diplomatics |url=http://archivaria.ca/index.php/archivaria/article/view/12096/13082 |journal=Archivaria. The Journal of the Association of Canadian Archivists |volume=40 |pages=40-74 |access-date=2017-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also appeared in a 1972 report to the [[Council_on_Library_and_Information_Resources|Council on Library Resources]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=1972 |title=Libraries and Information Technology: A National System Challenge |url=https://doi.org/10.17226/20211 |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |page=19 |access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helena Robinson (2012) criticized the term when she wrote, "[r]ather than revealing the essential affiliation between museums, libraries and archives, their sweeping classification as 'memory institutions' in the public sector and the academy oversimplifies the concept of memory, and marginalises domain-specific approaches to the cataloguing, description, interpretation and deployment of collections that lead museums, libraries and archives to engage with history, meaning and memory in significantly different ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robinson |first=Helena |date=2012 |title=Remembering Things Differently: Museums, Libraries and Archives as Memory Institutions and the Implications for Convergence |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09647775.2012.720188 |journal=Museum Management and Curatorship |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=413-429 |access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''miner's habit''' ({{lang-de|Berghabit}} or ''Bergmannshabit'') is the traditional dress of miners in Europe. The actual form varies depending on the region, the actual mining function, and whether it is used for work or for ceremonial occasions.

== Elements ==
At work, the miner of the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe wore the normal costume for his local region – [[Trousers|pit trousers]] (''Grubenhose''), [[shoe]]s and miner's jacket (''Bergkittel'').

Only gradually was the typical miner's uniform created by the addition of unmistakable elements of miner's apparel such as the [[miner's apron]] (''Arschleder''), [[knee pad]]s (''Kniebügel''), [[miner's cap]] (''Fahrhaube'' or ''Fahrkappe'', later pit hat (''Schachthut''), the [[Gezähe|mining tools]] needed for work in the pit, such as [[hammer]]s (''Fäustel''), chisels (''Eisen''), [[Wedge (mechanical device)|wedges]], [[pick (tool)|pick]]s (''Keilhauen''), [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]s (''Kratze''), [[shovel]]s, [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbars]], pikes (''Brechstangen'') or miner's [[chisel]]s (''Bergeisen''), [[mallet]]s (''Schlägel'') or carpenter's [[hatchet]]s, the miners' [[safety lamp]]s (often a ''[[Froschlampe]]''), and the ''Tzscherper'' bag (for the miner's knife (''Tzscherpermesser'') and lamp accessories like [[rape oil]], [[flint]] and [[tinder]]).&lt;ref name="Fahrzeug"&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Lueger-1904/A/Fahrzeug Lexikoneintrag bei zeno.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were specific accoutrements for the individual trade groups. The mining foreman or ''[[Steiger (mining)|Steiger]]'', for example, carried the ''Steigerhäckel'', a simple [[hewer]] (''Häuer'') bore a miner's hatchet (''Grubenbeil''). Able miners (''Doppelhäuer'') carried a miner's axe (''Bergbarte'' or ''Bergparte''), which was simultaneously a tool and a weapon. The smelters (''Hüttenleute'') wore the [[miner's apron|leather apron]] as a [[pinafore]] (''Schürze'') in front of them (i.e. "back to front") and carried various implements: the ''Firke'' or ''Furkel'', the [[rake (tool)|rake]] (''Rechen'') and the [[tapping bar]] (''Stecheisen'' or ''Abstichlanze'').

In 1769 in Saxony, the [[Marienberg, Saxony|Marienberg]] [[Bergmeister]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich von Trebra|von Trebra]], introduced the wearing of the black mining habit.&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation/core|Surname1=C. Schiffner|Title=Aus dem Leben alter Freiberger Bergstudenten |Publisher=Verlagsanstalt Ernst Maucksch|PublicationPlace=Freiberg|Year=1935|Date=  1935|language=German}} p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

The variety of mining habits may still be seen in the mining processions typical of the old mining regions even today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25341">'''Multiliteracies''' is a term coined in the mid-1990s by the New London Group&lt;ref name=NewLondon&gt;[http://www.informationhabitat.org/mw/index.php/The_New_London_School The New London School], Information Habitat wiki, [[Michigan State University]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708022433/http://www.informationhabitat.org/mw/index.php/The_New_London_School |date=July 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is an approach to [[literacy]] theory and [[pedagogy]].  This approach highlights two key aspects of literacy: [[linguistic diversity]], and multimodal forms of linguistic expression and representation. The term was coined in response to two significant changes in [[globalized]] environments: the proliferation of diverse modes of communication through new [[communications technologies]] such as the [[internet]], [[multimedia]], and [[digital media]], and the existence of growing linguistic and [[cultural diversity]] due to increased transnational migration.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|title="Multiliteracies": New Literacies, New Learning|journal=Pedagogies: An International Journal|volume=4|issue=3|pages=164–195|doi=10.1080/15544800903076044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the way people communicate is changing due to new technologies, and shifts in the usage of the English language within different cultures, a new "literacy" must also be used and developed.
 
==Overview==
There are two major topics that demonstrate the way multiliteracies can be used. The first is due to the world becoming smaller, communication between other cultures/languages is necessary to anyone. The usage of the [[English language]] is also being changed. While it seems that English is the common, [[global language]], there are different dialects and subcultures that all speak different [[Englishes]]. The way English is spoken in Australia,  South Africa, India or any other country is different from how it is spoken in the original English speaking countries in the UK.
 
The second way to incorporate the term multiliteracies is the way technology and multimedia is changing how we communicate.  These days, text and speech are not the only and main ways to communicate. The definition of media is being extended to include text combined with sounds, and images which are being incorporated into movies, billboards, almost any site on the internet, and television. All these ways of communication require the ability to understand a multimedia world.

The formulation of  "A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies" by the New London Group expanded the focus of literacy from reading and writing to an understanding of multiple discourses and forms of representation in public and professional domains.  The new literacy pedagogy was developed to meet the learning needs of students to allow them to navigate within these altered technological, cultural, and linguistically diverse communities.  The concept of multiliteracies has been applied within various contexts and includes oral vernacular genres, visual literacies, information literacy, emotional literacy, and scientific multiliteracies and [[numeracy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Application to the real world ==

Due to changes in the world, especially [[globalization]] and an increase in [[immigration]], a debate has arisen about the way students are instructed and learning in school. English, and all subjects, should evolve to incorporate multimodal ways of communication. The New London Group (1996) proposes the teaching of all representations of meaning including, linguistic, visual, audio, spatial, and gestural, which are subsumed under the category of multimodal.  A pedagogy of multiliteracies includes a balanced classroom design of Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, Critical Framing and Transformed Practice.  Students need to draw on their own experiences and [[semiotic]] literacy practices to represent and communicate meaning.

The changes that transpire through the field of education affect learning processes, while the application of learning processes affects the use of multiliteracies (Selber, 2004). These include the functional, critical, and rhetorical skills that are applied in diverse fields and disciplines.

Educational pedagogies, including Purpose Driven Education, integrate the use of multi-literacy by encouraging student learning through exploration of their passions using their senses, technology, [[vernacular]]s, as well as alternative forms of communication. 

== The New London Group ==
The New London Group is a group of ten academics who met at New London, New Hampshire, in the United States in September 1994, to develop a new literacy pedagogy that would serve concerns facing educators as the existing literacy pedagogy did not meet the learning needs of students. Their focus was on replacing the existing monolingual, monocultural, and standardized literacy pedagogy that prioritized reading and writing, with a pedagogy that used multiple modes of meaning making. They emphasised the use of multiple modes of communication, languages, and multiple Englishes to reflect the impact of new technologies and linguistic and cultural diversity, instead of developing competence in a single [[national language]] and [[Standard English|standardized form of English]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ten academics brought to the discussion their expertise and personal experience from different national and professional contexts. Courtney Cazden from the United States has worked in the areas of classroom discourse and multilingual teaching and learning; [[Bill Cope (academic)|Bill Cope]] from Australia, on literacy pedagogy and linguistic diversity, and new technologies of representation and communication; [[Mary Kalantzis]] from Australia, on experimental social education and citizenship education; [[Norman Fairclough]] from the United Kingdom, on critical discourse analysis, social practices and discourse, and the relationship between discursive change and social and cultural change; [[Gunther Kress]] from the United Kingdom, on social semiotics, visual literacy, discourse analysis, and multimodal literacy; [[James Paul Gee|James Gee]] from the United States, on psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and language and literacy; [[Allan Luke]] from Australia on critical literacy  and [[applied linguistics]]; Carmen Luke from Australia, on feminism and critical pedagogy; Sarah Michaels from the United States, on classroom discourse; and [http://nuragili.unsw.edu.au/profilemartinnakata.html Martin Nataka] on [[indigenous education]] and [[higher education]] curriculum. The article "A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures" published in 1996,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=The New London Group|last2=Group|first2=The New London|title=A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=66|issue=1|pages=60–93|doi=10.17763/haer.66.1.17370n67v22j160u}}&lt;/ref&gt; documents the New London Group's "manifesto" of literacy pedagogy that is recommended for use in educational institutions, in the community, and within organizations.

== A pedagogy of multiliteracies ==
The multiliteracies pedagogical approach involves four key aspects: Situated Practice, Critical Framing, Overt Instruction, and Transformed Practice. Situated Practice involves learning that is grounded in students' own life experiences. Critical Framing supports students in questioning common sense assumptions found within discourses. Overt Instruction is the direct teaching of "[[metalanguage]]s" in order to help learners understand the components of expressive forms or grammars. Transformed Practice is where learners engage in situated practices based in new understandings of literacy practices.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Situated practice ==
Situated Practice, originally formulated by the New London Group (1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=The New London Group|year=1996|title=A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=66|issue=1|pages=60–93|doi=10.17763/haer.66.1.17370n67v22j160u}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the related components of Multiliteracies Pedagogy, is constituted by immersion in meaningful practices within a community of learners who are culturally and linguistically diversified. It involves situating meaning making in real-world contexts and taking account of the affective and sociocultural needs of learners. This aspect of the curriculum needs to draw on the lifeworld experiences of students, as well as their out-of-school communities and discourses, as an integral part of the learning experience. In order to apply Situated Practice to curriculum realities, Cope &amp; Kalantzis (2009)&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|date=2009-08-06|title="Multiliteracies": New Literacies, New Learning|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15544800903076044|journal=Pedagogies: An International Journal|volume=4|issue=3|pages=164–195|doi=10.1080/15544800903076044|issn=1554-480X}}&lt;/ref&gt; reframed it as “experiencing” (p.&amp;nbsp;184)''.'' They believe human cognition is situated and contextual, and meanings are grounded in the real world of patterns of experience, action and subjective interest. Experiencing takes two forms.
* Experiencing the known–learners bring their own, invariably diverse knowledge, experiences, interests and life-texts to the learning context. Activities of experiencing the known involve showing or talking about something familiar-listen, view, watch and visit, reflecting on learners' own experiences, interests and perspectives (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neamathisi.com/_uploads/Things_You_Do_to_Know_Cope__Kalantzis_2015.pdf|title=‘The Things You Do to Know: An Introduction to the Pedagogy of Multiliteracies.’ pp.1-36 in A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Learning By Design, edited by B. Cope and M. Kalantzis|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|year=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Experiencing the new–learners are immersed in new situations or information, observing or taking part in something that is new or unfamiliar, but within the zone of intelligibility and close to their own life-worlds. For example, teachers introduce something new but which makes sense by immersion in experiments, field trips and investigations in projects (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).

Situated Practice/experiencing connects with a tradition called 'authentic pedagogy'. [http://newlearningonline.com/literacies/chapter-5/kalantzis-and-cope-debating-authentic-pedagogy Authentic pedagogy]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139196581.007|title=literacy|last=Kalantzis|first=Mary|last2=Cope|first2=Bill|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|location=Cambridge|publication-place=Cambridge|pages=95–117|doi=10.1017/cbo9781139196581.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first formulated as a direct counterpoint to [http://newlearningonline.com/learning-by-design/glossary/didactic didactic pedagogy] in the twentieth century, initially through the work of [http://www.iep.utm.edu/dewey/ John Dewey] in the United States and [http://www.britannica.com/biography/Maria-Montessori Maria Montessori]  in Italy. It focuses on the learner's own meanings, the texts that are relevant to them in their everyday lives. When it comes to reading and writing, authentic literacy pedagogy promotes a process of natural language growth that begins when a child learns to speak, with a focus on internalized understanding rather than the formalities of rules. It is learner-centered and aims to provide space for self-expression.

However, the New London Group (1996) points out limitations to Situated Practice. First, while situated learning can lead to mastery in practice, learners immersed in rich and complex practices can vary significantly from each other and Situated Practice does not necessarily lead to conscious control and awareness of what one knows and does. Second, Situated Practice does not necessarily create learners who can critique what they are learning in terms of historical, cultural, political, ideological, or value-centered relations. Third, there is the question of putting knowledge into action. Learners might be incapable of reflexively enacting their knowledge in practice. Therefore, they clarify that Situated Practice must be supplemented by other components and powerful learning arises from weaving between Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, Critical Framing and Transformed Practice in a purposeful way.

== Critical framing ==
Critical Framing in multiliteracies requires an investigation of the socio-cultural contexts and purposes of learning and designs of meaning. Cope and Kalantzis (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Cope, B.  |author2=Kalantzis, M. |lastauthoramp=yes |date = 2001|title = Putting ‘multiliteracies’ to the test|url = https://www.alea.edu.au/documents/item/59|journal = Newsletter of the Australian Literacy Educators Association.|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; discuss this in the context of our increasingly diverse and globally interconnected lives where the forces of migration, multiculturalism, and global economic integration intensify the processes of change. The act of meaning-making is also diversifying as digital interfaces level the playing field.

Mills (2009)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Mills|first = Kathy A.|date = 2009|title = Multiliteracies: interrogating competing discourses|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500780802152762|journal = Language and Education, 23:2, 103-116|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses how multiliteracies can help us go beyond heritage print texts that reproduce and sustain dominant cultural values by creating affordances for thinking about textual practices that construct and produce culture. Another dimension of this critical framing may be extended to the diverse types and purposes of literacy in contemporary society. The traditional curricula operates on various rules of inclusion and exclusion in the hierarchical ordering of textual practices, often dismissing text types such as picture books or popular fiction. Similarly, items like blogs, emails, websites, visual literacies, and oral discourses may often be overlooked as "inferior literacies". In excluding them from mainstream literacy practices, we become prone to disenfranchise groups and may lose out on opportunities to sensitize learners to consider underlying issues of power, privilege, and prejudice, both in terms of identifying these in societal practices, as well as in questioning dominant discourses that normalize these. Mills also states how some scholars such as Unsworth (2006a, 2006b) and Mackey (1998) suggest an increased blurring of 'popular culture' and 'quality literature' facilitated by classical literature made available in electronic formats and supported by online communities and forums.

In addition to acknowledging increased socio-cultural contextualization and diversification of text-types, multiliteracies pedagogies also enable us to critically frame and reconceptualize traditional notions of writing, calling into question issues of authority, authorship, power, and knowledge. [http://eprints.ncrm.ac.uk/3084/1/D4Writing_and_Multimodal_social_semiotics.pdf Domingo, Jewitt, &amp; Kress (2014)]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Multimodal social semiotics: Writing in online contexts|last = Domingo, M., Jewitt, C. and Kress, G|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = 1317510607|location = London|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; address these concepts through a study of template designs on websites and blogs that empowers the readers through non-linear readings paths, with the modular layout allowing them to choose their own reading paths. They also discuss the varying affordances of different modes and how writing become just one part of the multimodal ensemble.

Multiliteracies transcend conventional print literacies and the centrality of cultures that have historically extolled it, offering much scope for arts-based approaches in decolonizing initiatives (Flicker et. al., 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Flicker, S., Danforth, J., Wilson, C., Oliver, V., Larkin, J., Restoule, J-P, Mitchell, C., Konsmo, E., Jackson, R. &amp; Prentice, T.|date = 2014|title = "Because we have really unique art": Decolonizing research with Indigenous youth using the arts.|url = http://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ijih/article/view/13271|journal = International Journal of Indigenous Health|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; or reflexive visual methodologies in situated contexts (Mitchell, DeLange, Moletsane, Stuart, &amp; Buthelezi, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Mitchell, C., DeLange, N., Moletsane, R., Stuart, J., &amp; Buthelezi, T.|date = 2005|title = Giving a face to HIV and AIDS: On the uses of photo-voice by teachers and community health care workers working with youth in rural South Africa|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1191/1478088705qp042oa|journal = Qualitative Research in Psychology  |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=257–270|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in so far as access to digital tools and infrastructures is concerned, we still need to take into account issues of agency, capital, socioeconomic status, and digital epistemologies (Prinsloo &amp; Rowsell, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Prinsloo, M., &amp; Rowsell, J.|date = 2012|title = Digital literacies as placed resources in the globalised periphery|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500782.2012.691511|journal = Language and Education |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=271–277|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the original formulation of the New London Group, Overt Instruction was one of the major dimensions of literacy pedagogy that was identified. The original view of overt instruction includes the teachers and other experts' supporting students through scaffolding and focusing the students on the important features of their experiences and activities within the community of learners (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;33). Cope and Kalantiz argue teachers and other experts allow the learner to gain explicit information at times by building on and using what the learner already knows and has achieved. Overt Instruction is not, as it is often misrepresented, direct transmission, drills, and rote learning. It includes the kinds of collaborative efforts between teacher and student in which the student can do a task that is much more complex than the task s/he can do it individually. According to Cope and Kalantzis, "Overt Instruction introduces an often overlooked element-the connection of the element of the importance of contextualization of learning experiences to conscious understanding of elements of language meaning and design" (p.&amp;nbsp;116) Use of metalanguages, Cope and Kalantzis argue, is one of the key features of Overt Instruction. Metalanguages refer to "languages of reflective generalization that describe the form, content, and function of the discourses of practice" (p.&amp;nbsp;34).

===Updated view===
After applying Overt Instruction orientation to curriculum practices for around a decade, this dimension of literacy pedagogy was reframed and translated in the Learning by Design project into the 'Knowledge Process' of conceptualizing (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2009, 2015).&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt; 
Conceptualizing involves "the development of abstract, generalizing concepts and theoretical synthesis of these concepts" (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;19). Using these Knowledge Processes, learners can categorize terms, and collect these into the mental models. Conceptualizing, according to Cope and Kalantzis (p.&amp;nbsp;19) occurs in two ways:
Conceptualizing by Naming-categorization is a Knowledge Process by means of which the learner learns to use abstract, generalizing terms. A concept not only names the particular; it also abstracts something general from that particular.

Activity type: define terms, make a glossary, label a diagram, sort or categorize like or unlike things
Conceptualizing with theory-schematization is a Knowledge Process by means of which learners make generalizations and put the key terms together into interpretative framework. They build mental models, abstract frameworks and transferable disciplinary schemas (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;185&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt;).  
Activity type: draw a diagram, make a concept map, or write a summary, theory or formula which puts the concepts together

== Transformed practice ==
Transformed Practice, originally framed by the New London Group (1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=The New London Group|year=1996|title=A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=66|issue=1|pages=60–93|doi=10.17763/haer.66.1.17370n67v22j160u}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the four components of Multiliteracies pedagogy, is embedded in [[Authentic Learning|authentic learning]], where activities are re-created according to the lifeworld of learners. Transformed Practice is transfer in meaning-making practice, which involves applied learning, real-world meanings, communication in practice, and applying understanding gained from Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, and Critical Framing to a new context. Once learners are aware of how context affects their learning, the "theory becomes [[reflective practice]]" (The New London Group, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;87). In other words, learners can reflect on what they have learned while they engage in reflective practice based on their personal goals and values in new contexts. For instance, learners design a personalized research project on a specific topic.

Transformed Practice subsequently underwent reformation and was renamed "Applying" as part of "Knowledge Processes" (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;184),&lt;ref name="Cope 164–195"/&gt; formerly known as Multiliteracy pedagogy. Applying is considered as the typical focus of the tradition of applied or [http://edglossary.org/competency-based-learning/ competency-based learning] (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neamathisi.com/_uploads/Things_You_Do_to_Know_Cope__Kalantzis_2015.pdf|title='The Things You Do to Know: An Introduction to the Pedagogy of Multiliteracies.' pp.1-36 in A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Learning By Design, edited by B. Cope and M. Kalantzis|last=Cope|first=Bill|last2=Kalantzis|first2=Mary|year=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; While learners actively learn by applying experiential, conceptual or critical knowledge in the real world, learners act on the basis of knowing something of the world, and learning something new from the experience of acting. That is, applying occurs more or less unconsciously or incidentally everyday in the lifeworld, since learners are usually doing things and learning by doing them. Applying can occur in two ways:
* Applying appropriately concerns how knowledge is perceived in a typical or predictable way in a particular situation. For instance, meanings are expressed in a way that corresponds to the conventions of a [[Semiotics|semiotic]] or [[meaning-making]] setting (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015). Applying appropriately also involves the application of knowledge and understanding of the complexity of real-world situations. Learners then examine if they are valid. Examples of activities include writing, drawing, solving a problem, or behaving in the usual and expected manner in a real-world situation/[[simulation]] (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).
* Applying creatively involves the way learners transform knowledge they have learned from a familiar context and use it in a different context, unfamiliar to learners. As applying creatively is related to being active in the innovative and creative world, learners’ interests, experiences, and aspirations can be promoted. Examples of activities are taking an intellectual risk, applying knowledge to a different setting, suggesting a new problem, and translating knowledge into a different mix of modes of meaning (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2015).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3483">The '''New Shakspere Society''' was founded in autumn 1873 by [[Frederick James Furnivall]] in order "to do honor to Shakspere, to make out the succession of his plays, and thereby the growth of his mind and art; to promote the intelligent study of him, and to print Texts illustrating his works and times..."&lt;ref name="prospectus"&gt;{{cite book|title=You are invited to join the New Shakspere Society|date=1873|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W2tdAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furnivall deliberately used an archaic [[Spelling of Shakespeare's name|spelling]] of Shakespeare's name in order to distinguish his Society from the earlier [[Shakespeare Society]] (1840&amp;ndash;1853) organized by [[John Payne Collier]].

==History==
Its first official meeting was held on 13 March 1874 at [[University College London]], and by the next year membership had reached 500 members.&lt;ref name="19th cent"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Hollingsworth|editor1-last=Marshall|editor1-first=Gail|title=Shakespeare in the Nineteenth Century|date=2012|isbn=9780521518246|page=441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members included prominent names of the day such as [[Eleanor Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, Mary. ''Love and Capital'': Karl and Jenny Marx. New York: Little Brown. 2011. p467&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[James Halliwell-Phillipps]], [[Richard Green Moulton]], and [[Edward Dowden]].&lt;ref name="19th cent" /&gt; In its early years, it hosted public paper discussions and published both ''Proceedings'' and ''Transactions'' as the official record of the society. The Society also devoted a significant portion of its energies to determining the exact chronology of Shakespeare's plays; Furnivall believed that Shakespeare's works had to be studied in the order they were written to "get at a right understanding of his mind."&lt;ref name="prospectus" /&gt;

The Society was disrupted several times by conflicts between Furnivall and other members. [[Frederick Gard Fleay]], an early member, resigned during the Society's first year after an argument with Furnivall, and a number of members left the society in the 1880s following a protracted argument between Furnivall and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]].&lt;ref name="19th cent" /&gt; Membership continued to decline throughout the next decade, and the Society officially disbanded in 1894.&lt;ref name="19th cent" /&gt;

==Publications==
Furnivall and many other members of the society were interested in quantifying Shakespeare's works, such as counting their lines or analyzing the meter of his poetry, which was reflected in their published papers and books. The Society also planned to publish [[Teena Rochfort-Smith]]'s "Four-text Hamlet," an innovative experiment which reproduced four versions of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in parallel columns to enable textual analysis, but had only completed a prototype of the first act before Rochfort-Smith's untimely death.&lt;ref name="SQ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Ann|title=Teena Rochfort Smith, Frederick Furnivall, and the New Shakespere Society's Four-Text Edition of Hamlet|journal=Shakespeare Quarterly|date=Summer 1998|volume=49|issue=2|pages=125|doi=10.2307/2902297|jstor=2902297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Although nomophobia does not appear in the current [[DSM-5|''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'', Fifth Edition]] (DSM-5), it has been proposed as a "specific phobia", based on definitions given in the DSM-IV.&lt;ref name="proposal1" /&gt;{{dubious|reason=DSM-5 was published a year before this study, the grammar is bad and the paper contradicts itself in places|date=June 2016}} According to Bianchi and Philips (2005) psychological factors are involved in the overuse of a mobile phone.&lt;ref name="Bianchi2005"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cpb.2005.8.39|title = Psychological Predictors of Problem Mobile Phone Use|authors = Adriana Bianchi and James G.

It is also highly possible that nomophobic symptoms may be caused by other underlying and preexisting mental disorders, with likely candidates including social phobia or social anxiety disorder, social anxiety,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and panic disorder.&lt;ref name=KingValencaNardi&gt;{{Cite journal|url= |title=Nomophobia: the mobile phone in panic disorder with agoraphobia: reducing phobias or worsening of dependence?|last = King, A.

The study found that nearly 53% of mobile phone users in Britain tend to be anxious when they "lose their mobile phone, run out of battery or credit, or have no network coverage". The study, sampled 2,163 people, found that about 58% of men and 47% of women suffer from the phobia, and an additional 9% feel stressed when their mobile phones are off. 55% of those surveyed cited keeping in touch with friends or family as the main reason that they got anxious when they could not use their mobile phones.&lt;ref name="cbs2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2940198|title=A Study to Evaluate Mobile Phone Dependence Among Students of a Medical College and Associated Hospital of Central India|doi=10.4103/0970-0218.66878|year=2010|last1=Dixit|first1=Sanjay|last2=Shukla|first2=Harish|last3=Bhagwat|first3=AK|last4=Bindal|first4=Arpita|last5=Goyal|first5=Abhilasha|last6=Zaidi|first6=Aliak|last7=Shrivastava|first7=Akansha|journal=Indian Journal of Community Medicine|volume=35|issue=2|pages=339–41|pmid=20922119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study compared stress levels induced by the average case of nomophobia to be on-par with those of "wedding day jitters" and trips to the dentist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=130002&amp;in_page_id=34 |title=13m Britons have 'no mobile phobia' |publisher=''Metro'' |date=2008-03-30 |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another study found that out of 547 male, undergraduate students in Health Services, 23% of the students were classified as nomophobic, while an additional 64% were at risk of developing nomophobia. Of these students,  approximately 77% checked their mobile phones 35 or more times a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bivin | first1 = J.

Retrieved August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The study and subsequent coverage of the phobia resulted in two editorial columns authored by individuals who minimized their mobile phone use or chose not to own one at all. These authors appeared to treat the condition with light undertones of mockery, or outright disbelief and amusement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article983702.ece |author=Peter Seabrook|title=I refuse to carry a mobile phone |publisher=''The Sun'' |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080405161056/http://media.www.siude.com/media/storage/paper1096/news/2008/04/03/Columns/Column.Nomophobia.no.More.Phobia-3299034.shtml Column: Nomophobia: "No more phobia"]. siude.com. March 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language classicists do not like this word or approve of it, because of its inherent confusion with the existing, though rare, nomophobia, a fear of laws, rules or regulations. The latter derives from the Greek ''nomos'' (a law, rule or regulation) seen in such other words as astronomy (rules about the stars), gastronomy (rules about food and eating), autonomy (ruling oneself), economy (rules governing the finances of the state or household), antinomy (a law contrary to another law), metronome (a device to regulate metre or beat), nomocracy (the rule of law in society), nomography (the law in written form), nomology (the study or science of law), nomothete (a lawgiver), and the archaic anomy (lawlessness). The neologistic meaning, relating to mobile phones, seems to have been adopted by the younger generations, and by those without a deeper understanding of the Oxford guidelines on word construction, in which typically Greek words are attached to Greek words (and Latin to Latin, etc.).

== Research evidence ==
With the changes of technologies, new challenges are coming up on a daily basis. New kinds of phobias have emerged (the so-called techno-phobias). Since the first mobile phone was introduced to the consumer market in 1983, these devices have become significantly mainstream in the majority of societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = AMTA 2003 Annual Report|last = Australian Mobile|first = Telecommunications Association|publisher = Canberra, Australian Capital Territory|year = 2003|isbn = |location = Australia|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shambare, Rugimbana &amp; Zhowa (2012) claimed that cell phones are "possibly the biggest non-drug addiction of the 21st century", and that colleges students may spend up to nine hours every day on their phones, which can lead to dependence on such technologies as a driver of modern life and an example of "a paradox of technology".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Paradoxes of technology: Consumer cognizance, emotions, and coping strategies.|last = Mick, D.

A survey conducted by SecurEnvoy showed that young adults and adolescents are more likely to suffer from nomophobia. The same survey reported that 77% of the teens reported anxiety and worries when they were without their mobile phones, followed by the 25-34 age group and people over 55 years old. Some psychological predictors to look for in a person who might be suffering of this phobia are "self negative views, younger age, low esteem and self-efficacy, high extroversion or introversion, impulsiveness and sense of urgency and sensation seeking".&lt;ref name="Bianchi2005" /&gt;

Among students, frequent cell phone usage has been correlated with decreases in [[grade point average]] (GPA) and increased anxiety that negatively impacts self-reported [[life satisfaction]] (well-being and happiness) in comparison to students with less frequent usage. GPA decreases may be due to the over-use of cell phone or computer usage consuming time and focus during studying, attending class, working on assignments, and the distraction of cell phones during class. Over-usage of cell phones may increase anxiety due to the pressure to be continually connected to social networks and could rob chances of perceived solitude, relieving daily stress, that has been linked as a component of well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The relationship between cell phone use, academic performance, anxiety, and satisfaction with life in college students.|last = Lepp, A., J.

According to one study, the first thing that 61% of people do after waking up in the morning is check their smartphones. Further, 77% of the teens reported anxiety when they are without mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://loveumarketing.com/mobile-phone-distracted-mind/|title=8 Ways To Not Get Distracted By Mobile Phone - LoveUMarketing|date=2017-12-17|work=LoveUMarketing|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other experiments ===
In Australia 946 adolescents and emerging adults between ages 15 and 24 participated in a mobile phone research study (387 males, 557 females, and two chose not to report a gender).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Needing to connect: The effect of self and others on young people's involvement with their mobile phones.|last = Walsh, S.

Researchers assessed several psychological factors that might influence participants' mobile phone use with the following questionnaires: Mobile Phone Involvement Questionnaire (MPIQ), Frequency of Mobile Phone Use, Self Identity, and Validation from others. The MPIQ assessed behavioral addictions using a seven-point Likert scale (''1 – strongly agree'') and (''7 – strongly disagree'') that included statements such as: "I often think about my mobile phone when I am not using it. ... I feel connected to others when I use my mobile phone."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The results demonstrated moderate difference between the participants' mobile phone use and their psychological relationships with the mobile phones. No pathological conditions were found, but there was an excessive use of mobile phone indicating signs of attachment. Participants who demonstrated signs of excessive mobile phone use were more likely to increase their use when receiving validation from others. Other factors considered, the population studied was focused on adolescents and emerging adults are more likely to develop mobile phone dependency because they may be going through a self-identity, [[self-esteem]], and [[social identity]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Sufferers of [[panic disorder]]s and anxiety disorders are prone to mobile phone dependency. A study in Brazil compared the symptoms experienced due to mobile phone use by heterosexual participants with panic disorders and a control group of healthy participants. Group 1 consisted of 50 participants with panic disorder and [[agoraphobia]] with an average age of 43, and group 2 consisted of 70 healthy participants with no disorders and an average age of 35. During the experiment participants were given a self-report mobile phone questionnaire which assessed the mobile phone use and symptoms reported by both groups. 

About 44% of group 1 reported that they felt "secure" when they had their mobile phones versus 46% of group 2 reported they would not feel the same without their mobile phone.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = 'Nomophobia': Impact of Cell Phone Use Interfering with Symptoms and Emotions of Individuals with Panic Disorder Compared with a Control Group.|date = 2014|journal = Clinical Practice and Epidemiology in Mental Health (CP &amp; EMH)|pages= 10, 28|doi = 10.2174/1745017901410010028|pmid = |access-date =|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results demonstrated that 68% of all participants reported mobile phone dependency, but overall the participants with panic disorder and agoraphobia reported significantly more emotional symptoms and dependency on mobile phones when compared to the control group when access to the mobile phone was prohibited.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Symptoms and signs ==
Nomophobia occurs in situations when an individual experiences anxiety due to the fear of not having access to a mobile phone. The "over-connection syndrome" occurs when mobile phone use reduces the amount of face-to-face interactions thereby interfering significantly with an individual’s social and family interactions. The term "[[Technostress|techno-stress]]" is another way to describe an individual who avoids face-to-face interactions by engaging in isolation including psychological mood disorders such as depression. 

Anxiety is provoked by several factors, such as the loss of a mobile phone, loss of reception, and a dead mobile phone battery.&lt;ref name="proposal1" /&gt; Some clinical characteristics of nomophobia include using the device impulsively, as a protection from social communication, or as a transitional object. Observed behaviors include having one or more devices with access to internet, always carrying a charger, and experiencing feelings of anxiety when thinking about losing the mobile. 

Other clinical characteristics of nomophobia are a considerably decreased number of face-to-face interactions with humans, replaced by a growing preference for communication through technological interfaces, keeping the device in reach when sleeping and never turned off, and looking at the phone screen frequently to avoid missing any message, phone call, or notification (also called [[ringxiety]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khilnani AK, Thaddanee R, Khilnani G | title = Phantom ringing syndrome: an Indian perspective | journal = International Journal of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 477–480 | date = March 2018 | doi = 10.18203/issn.2454-5929.ijohns20180710 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nomophobia can also lead to an increase of debt due to the excessive use of data and the different devices the person can have.&lt;ref name="proposal1" /&gt; Nomophobia may also lead to physical issues such as sore elbows, hands, and necks due to repetitive use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malcore|first1=Paul|title=Teen Smartphone Addiction: It's Physical|url=https://www.rawhide.org/blog/teen-issues/teen-smartphone-addiction/|website=www.rawhide.org|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irrational reactions and extreme reactions due to anxiety and stress may be experienced by the individual in public settings where mobile phone use is restricted, such as in airports, academic institutions, hospitals and work. Overusing a mobile phone for day-to-day activities such as purchasing items can cause the individual financial problems.&lt;ref name="proposal1" /&gt; Signs of distress and depression occur when the individual does not receive any contact through a mobile phone. Attachment signs of a mobile phone also include the urge to sleep with a mobile phone. The ability to communicate through a mobile phone gives the individual peace of mind and security.

Nomophobia may act as a proxy to other disorders.&lt;ref name="proposal1" /&gt; Those suffering from an underlying social disorder are likely to experience nervousness, anxiety, anguish, perspiration, and trembling when separated or unable to use their digital devices due to low battery, out of service area, no connection, etc. Such people will often insist on keeping their devices on hand at all times, typically returning to their homes to retrieve forgotten cell phones. 

Nomophobic behavior may reinforce social anxiety tendencies and dependency on using virtual and digital communications as a method of reducing stress generated by social anxiety and social phobia.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title =Nomophobia: Dependency on virtual environments or social phobia?|last = King, A.

Those with panic disorder will probably feel significantly more anxious and depressed with their cellphone use. Despite this, those suffering from panic disorder were significantly less likely to place voice calls.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Treatments ==
Currently, scholarly accepted and empirically proven treatments are very limited due to its relatively new concept. However, promising treatments include cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, EMDR, and combined with pharmacological interventions.&lt;ref name="proposal1"&gt;Bragazzi, N. L., &amp; G. D. Puenete (2014). A proposal for including nomophobia in the new DSM-V. Psychology Research and Behavior Management 7. 155-160.&lt;/ref&gt; Treatments using tranylcypromine and clonazepam were successful in reducing the effects of nomophobia.&lt;ref name=KingValencaNardi /&gt;

Cognitive behavioral therapy seems to be effective by reinforcing autonomous behavior independent from technological influences, however, this form of treatment lacks randomized trials. Another possible treatment is "Reality Approach," or Reality therapy asking patient to focus behaviors away from cell phones.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; In extreme or severe cases, neuropsychopharmacology may be advantageous, ranging from benzodiazepines to antidepressants in usual doses.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; Patients were also successfully treated using tranylcypromine combined with clonazepam. However, it is important to note that these medications were designed to treat social anxiety disorder and not nomophobia directly.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It may be rather difficult to treat nomophobia directly, but more plausible to investigate, identify, and treat any underlying mental disorders if any exist.

Even though nomophobia is a fairly new concept, there are validated psychometric scales available to help in the diagnostic, an example of one of these scales is the "Questionnaire of Dependence of Mobile Phone/Test of Mobile Phone Dependence (QDMP/TMPD)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://progress.umb.edu.pl/sites/progress.umb.edu.pl/files/33-44%20Choliz.pdf|title = Mobile Phone Addiction in Adolescence: The Test of Mobile Phone Dependence (TMD)|last = Chóliz|first = M.|date = 2012|journal = Progress in Health Science|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ottu barrage''', sometimes spelled as the '''Otu barrage''' and also known as '''Ottu Head''', is a masonry [[weir]] on the [[Ghaggar-Hakra River]] in [[Haryana]] state of [[India]] that creates a large water reservoir out of the formerly-small Dhanur lake, located near the village of [[Ottu, Haryana|Ottu]], which is about 8 miles from [[Sirsa, Haryana|Sirsa]] in Haryana.&lt;ref name="ref36hahor"&gt;{{Citation | title=Imperial gazetteer of India | author=Sir William Wilson Hunter, India Office | publisher=Clarendon Press, 1908 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUAKAQAAIAAJ | quote=''...

Mindful of the farmers' interests, the irrigation department has accelerated the work to deepen Ottu reservoir) ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The Ottu barrage was constructed in 1896-97 using low-cost labor that was available due to a famine in the region at that time.&lt;ref name="ref36hahor"/&gt; Prior to the construction of the barrage and its associated reservoir and canals, agriculture in the [[History of Bikaner|then princely state]] of [[Bikaner]] had come under pressure from fluctuating water-supply in the monsoon season caused by diversions in the Ghaggar by riparian farmers further upstream.&lt;ref name="ref46jicup"&gt;{{Citation | title=An archaeological tour along the Ghaggar-Hakra River |author1=Aurel Stein |author2=Amalananda Ghosh |author3=Swarajya Prakash Gupta | publisher=Kusumanjali Prakashan, 1989 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmtuAAAAMAAJ | quote=''... general opinion repeatedly expressed to me in the Hanumangarh area alleges that the volume of water available for cultivation both from the Nali and the Ghaggar canals has considerably diminished ...  increased diversion of flood water from the upper course of the Ghaggar ... ... complaints repeatedly raised by the Bikanir Durbar ... led to the construction in 1897 of the Otu barrage and the Ghaggar canals ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The barrage and canals cost 6.3 [[lakh]] [[rupees]] to construct, 2.8 lakhs of which was paid by the princely state of Bikaner and the remainder by the [[British raj|British-run Government of India]].&lt;ref name="ref46jicup"/&gt;

==Historical confusion with Talwara lake==
It was once assumed by some historians that Ottu lake was the site where [[Timur]] had encamped after overpowering Bhatnair fort in [[Hanumangarh]] (Rajasthan) during his invasion of India in 1398-99 CE. However, it is now known that the actual site of his camp, which he described as being ''Kinar-e-Hauz'' (i.e. on the banks of a tank or lake), was at the banks of [[Talwara Lake]], which is further 40 km downstream in [[Hanumangarh district]] between [[Ellenabad]] and [[Hanumangarh]] town.&lt;ref name="ref49momog"&gt;{{Citation | title=History of Sirsa Town | publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp;amp; Distri | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G0Z457ZOR44C | quote=''...

The assumption of some persons that Timur had relaxed on the bank of Ottu lake is not logical ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''kanun''', '''ganoun''' or '''kanoon''' ({{lang-ar|قانون|qānūn}};{{lang-el|κανονάκι|kanonaki}}; {{lang-he-n|קָנוֹן}}, ''qanon''; {{lang-fa|{{nastaliq|قانون|fa}}}}, ''qānūn''; {{lang-tr|kanun}}; {{lang-hy|քանոն|k’anon}}; {{lang-az|qanun}};  {{Lang-ug|ug=قالون|lat=qalon}}) is a [[string instrument]] played either solo, or more often as part of an ensemble, in much of the Middle East, [[Maghreb]], West Africa, Central Asia, and southeastern regions of Europe. The name derives from the Arabic word ''[[Qanun (law)|qanun]]'', meaning "rule, law, norm, principle", which is borrowed from the ancient Greek word and musical instrument {{wikt-lang|grc|κανών}} (rule), which in Latin was called [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon]] (not to be confused with the European polyphonic musical style and composition technique known by the same name). Traditional and Classical musics executed on the qanun are based on [[Arabic maqam|Maqamat]] or [[Makam]]lar. As the historical relative of [[santur]] from the same geography, qanun is thought to trace its origins back to [[Assyria]], where an ancestral homologue might have been used in [[Mesopotamia]]n royal courts and religious ceremonies. The instrument today is a type of large [[zither]] with a thin trapezoidal soundboard that is famous for its unique melodramatic sound.

==Regional variants and technical specifications==
Arabic qanuns are usually constructed with five skin insets that support a single long bridge resting on five arching pillars, whereas the somewhat smaller Turkish qanuns are based on just four. This allows Arabic variants of the instrument to have more room for the installation of extreme bass and treble strings. Kanuns manufactured in Turkey generally feature 26 [[course (music)|courses]] of strings, with three strings per course in the case of all regional variants. Contemporary [[Levant]]ine designs use [[Nylon]] or [[PolyVinyl Chloride|PVC]] strings that are stretched over the bridge poised on fish-skins as described on one end, and attached to wooden tuning pegs at the other end.

Ornamental [[sound hole]]s called ''kafes'' are a critical component of what constitutes the accustomed timbre of qanun. However, they normally occupy different locations on the soundboard of Turkish kanuns compared to Arabic qanuns, and may also vary in shape, size and number depending on geography or personal taste.

The dimensions of a Turkish kanun are typically 95 to 100&amp;nbsp;cm (37-39") in length, 38 to 40&amp;nbsp;cm (15-16") in width, and 4 to 6&amp;nbsp;cm (1.5-2.3") in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Aydoğdu |first1=Gültekin |last2=Aydoğdu |first2=Tahir |date= |title='Kanun' hakkında |publisher=turksanatmuzigi.org: Salih Bora |url=http://www.turksanatmuzigi.org/bilgiler/calgilarimiz/kanun |accessdate=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, an Arabic qanun measures a bit larger as mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About The Qanun |website=www.middleeasterndance.net |url=http://www.middleeasterndance.net/Music/Kanun/AboutKanun.html |access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qanun is played on the lap while sitting or squatting, or sometimes on trestle support, by plucking the strings with two [[tortoise]]-shell picks (one for each hand) or with fingernails, and has a standard range of three and a half [[octave]]s from A2 to E6 that can be extended down to F2 and up to G6 in the case of Arabic designs.

The instrument also features special metallic levers or latches under each course called ''mandals''. These small levers, which can be raised or lowered quickly by the performer while the instrument is being played, serve to slightly change the pitch of a particular course by altering effective string lengths.&lt;ref name="Kassabian2013"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kassabian |first=Anahid |year=2013 |title=Ubiquitous Listening: Affect, Attention, and Distributed Subjectivity |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-27515-7 |pages=79– |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rOfvO7fLuNAC&amp;pg=PA79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tuning and temperament==
On the regular [[Diatonic scale|diatonically]] tuned qanun, ''mandal'' technology was first implemented, according to Turkish musicologist [[Rauf Yekta]], some 30 years prior to his submission of his invited monograph on Turkish Music to the 1922 edition of Albert Lavignac's ''Encyclopédie de la Musique et Dictionnaire du Conservatoire''.&lt;ref name="Nasuhioğlu1985"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nasuhioğlu |first=Orhan |date=December 1986 |title=Türk Musikisi - Rauf Yekta Bey |publisher=Pan Yayıncılık |pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levantine qanuns, prior to that time, remained rather inflexible and cumbersome to perform on (especially as demanding modulations/transpositions came into vogue that were increasingly emulating Western [[tonality]] and [[key change]]s), requiring the player to use the fingernail of the thumb to depress on the leftmost ends of the courses to achieve on-the-fly intervallic alterations.

With the advent of [[electronic tuner]]s some decades later, standardization of the placement of ''reference mandals'' on the qanun began. While Armenian kanuns now employ only equidistant [[semitone|half-tones]] and Arabic qanuns exact [[quarter-tones]] as a result, Turkish kanun-makers went so far as dividing the electroacoustically referenced [[equal-tempered]] [[Semitone#Equal temperament|semitone of 100]] [[Cent (music)|cents]] into 6 equal parts, yielding - for all intents and purposes - 72 equal divisions (or [[comma (music)|commas]]) of the [[octave]] pitch resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yarman |first=Ozan |year=2008 |title=79-tone Tuning &amp; Theory For Turkish Maqam Music As A Solution To The Non-Conformance Between Current Model And Practice |publisher=unpublished Doctoral Dissertation |location=Istanbul Technical University: Institute of Social Sciences |pages=2–3,92,126 |url=http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/doctorate_thesis.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all pitches of [[72 equal temperament|72-tone equal temperament]] are available on the Turkish kanun, however, since kanun-makers affix mandals that only accommodate modulations/transpositions popularly demanded by performers. This has subsequently lead to the familiar interrupted and irregular pattern of mandals on the Turkish kanun becoming a visual guide for players, in facilitating modal and intonational navigation on an instrument which is ordinarily bereft of pitch markers. Some kanun-makers may also choose to divide the semitone distance from the nut of the lower registers into 7 parts instead for microtonal subtlety (and the highest registers, conversely, into 5 parts due to spacing constraints); but do so at the expense of [[octave equivalence]]s. Despite the mentioned discrepancies, hundreds of mandal configurations are at the player's disposal when performing on an ordinary Turkish kanun.

On the other hand, the nowadays widespread application of equidistant 24-tones on Arabic and 72-tones on Turkish qanun models presents an ongoing source of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Aydoğdu |first1=Tahir |display-authors=etal |date=2012 |title=1.

Pitch measurement analyses of relevant audio recordings reveal that, equal temperaments based on bike-chained "multiples of twelve" are essentially not compatible with authentic Middle Eastern performances; substantiating the notion instruments strictly based on them would clash audibly with a justly tuned/intoned [[Turkish tambur|tanbur]], [[oud]], [[ney]], or [[Classical kemençe|kemenche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bozkurt|first=Barış|last2=Yarman|first2=Ozan|date=2009|display-authors=etal|title=Weighing Diverse Theoretical Models on Turkish Maqam Music Against Pitch Measurements: A Comparison of Peaks Automatically Derived from Frequency Histograms with Proposed Scale Tones|url=http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/theoryVSpractice.pdf|journal=Journal of New Music Research, 38:1|pages=45–70|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Makam – Modal Practice in Turkish Art Music|last=Signell|first=Karl|publisher=Asian Music Publications|year=1977|isbn=|location=Washington|pages=37–47, 151–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative tuning approaches for the qanun thus also exist. Turkish music theorist Ozan Yarman has proposed, for example, an academical 79-tone temperament for the expression within tolerable error-margins of [[Arabic maqam|Maqamat]] / [[Makam]]lar / [[Dastgah]]a at all pitch levels, that was implemented by the renowned late [[luthier]] Ejder Güleç (1939-2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ejdermuzik.com/|title=Ejder Müzik Aletleri|last=Güleç|first=Levent &amp; Bülent|website=www.ejdermuzik.com|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a Turkish kanun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ozanyarman.com/79toneqanun.html|title=79-tone qanun recipe|website=www.ozanyarman.com|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the late Swiss-French qānūn performer Julien Jalâl Ed-Dine Weiss (1953-2015), who was critical of the tuning deficiency of Eurocentric octave divisions in approximating [[just interval]]s, is known to have conceived, since 1990, a number of prototypes that were entirely based on low [[Limit (music)|prime-limit]] or simple integer ratio [[Pythagorean tuning|Pythagorean]] and [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic]] intervals; which were once again built, on instructions from Weiss, by Ejder Güleç.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Julien Jalâl Ed-Dine Weiss: A Novel Tuning System for the Middle-Eastern Qānūn|last=Pohlit|first=Stefan|publisher=unpublished Doctorate Dissertation|year=2011|isbn=|location=Istanbul Technical University: Institute of Social Sciences|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Russian language}}
{{IPA notice}}
This article discusses the '''[[phonology|phonological]] system of [[standard language|standard]] [[Russian language|Russian]]''' based on the [[Moscow]] [[dialect]] (unless otherwise noted). For an overview of dialects in the Russian language, see [[Russian dialects]]. Most descriptions of Russian describe it as having five vowel phonemes, though there is some dispute over whether a sixth vowel, {{IPA|/ɨ/}}, is separate from {{IPA|/i/}}.  Russian has 34 consonants, which can be divided into two sets:
* ''hard'' ({{lang|ru|твёрдый}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-твёрдый.ogg|[ˈtvʲɵrdɨj]}}) or ''plain''
* ''soft'' ({{lang|ru|мягкий}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-мягкий.ogg|[ˈmʲæxʲkʲɪj]|help=no}}) or ''[[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]''

Russian also distinguishes hard consonants from soft (palatalized) consonants and from a soft consonant followed by {{IPA|/j/}} or a hard consonant followed by {{IPA|/j/}} (though the last is uncommon: {{IPA|/C Cʲ Cʲj Cj/}}), and preserves palatalized consonants that are followed by another consonant more often than other [[Slavic languages]] do. Like Polish, it has both hard postalveolars ({{IPA|/ʂ ʐ/}}) and soft ones ({{IPA|/t͡ɕ ɕː ʑː/}}).

Russian has [[vowel reduction]] in unstressed syllables. This feature applies in Slavic languages like [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], and is also found in [[English language|English]], but not in western Slavic languages, such as [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Czech language|Czech]].

C is hard (non-palatalized) consonant, Ç is soft (palatalized) consonant. This chart uses frequencies to represent the basic vowel triangle of the Russian language.]]
Russian has five or six vowels in stressed syllables, {{IPA|/i, u, e, o, a/}} and in some analyses {{IPA|/ɨ/}}, but in most cases these vowels have merged to only two to four vowels when unstressed: {{IPA|/i, u, a/}} (or {{IPA|/ɨ, u, a/}}) after hard consonants and {{IPA|/i, u/}} after soft ones.

A long-standing dispute among linguists is whether Russian has five vowel phonemes or six; that is, scholars disagree as to whether {{IPA|[ɨ]}} constitutes an allophone of {{IPA|/i/}} or if there is an independent phoneme {{IPA|/ɨ/}}.  The five-vowel analysis, taken up by the Moscow school, rests on the [[complementary distribution]] of {{IPA|[ɨ]}} and {{IPA|[i]}}, with the former occurring after hard (non-[[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]) consonants and {{IPA|[i]}} elsewhere.

The six-vowel view, held by the Saint-Petersburg (Leningrad) phonology school, points to several phenomena to make its case:
* Native Russian speakers' ability to articulate {{IPA|[ɨ]}} in isolation: for example, in the names of the letters {{angbr|{{lang|ru|[[и]]}}}} and {{angbr|{{lang|ru|[[ы]]}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{Harvcoltxt|Ozhegov|1953|p=10}}; {{Harvcoltxt|Barkhudarov|Protchenko|Skvortsova|1987|p=9}}; {{Harvcoltxt|Chew|2003|p=61}}. The traditional name of {{angbr|ы}}, {{lang|ru|еры}} {{IPA|[jɪˈrɨ]}} ''yery''; since 1961 this name has been replaced from the Russian school practice (compare the 7th and 8th editions of the standard textbook of Russian for 5th and 6th grades: {{Harvcoltxt|Barkhudarov|Kryuchkov|1960|p=4}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Barkhudarov|Kryuchkov|1961|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rare instances of word-initial {{IPA|[ɨ]}}, including the minimal pair {{lang|ru|и́кать}} 'to produce the sound {{lang|ru|и}}' and {{lang|ru|ы́кать}} 'to produce the sound ы'),{{Sfn|Chew|2003|p=61}} as well as borrowed names and toponyms, like {{lang|ru|Ыб}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-Ыб.ogg|[ɨp]}}, the name of a river and several villages in the [[Komi Republic]].
* Morphological alternations like {{lang|ru|гото́в}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-готов.ogg|[ɡɐˈtof]|help=no}} ('ready' predicate, m.) and {{lang|ru|гото́вить}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-готовить.ogg|[ɡɐˈtovʲɪtʲ]|help=no}} ('to get ready' trans.) between palatalized and non-palatalized consonants.{{Sfn|Chew|2003|p=62}}

The most popular view among linguists (and that taken up in this article) is that of the Moscow school,{{Sfn|Chew|2003|p=61}} though Russian pedagogy has typically taught that there are six ''vowels'' (the term ''phoneme'' is not used).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{Harvcoltxt|Shcherba|1950|p=15}}; {{Harvcoltxt|Matijchenko|1950|pp=40–41}}; {{Harvcoltxt|Zemsky|Kryuchkov|Svetlayev|1971|p=63}}; {{Harvcoltxt|Kuznetsov|Ryzhakov|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reconstructions of [[Proto-Slavic]] show that {{lang|sla|*i}} and {{lang|sla|*y}}  (which correspond to {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[ɨ]}}) were separate phonemes. On the other hand, numerous alternations between the two sounds in Russian indicate clearly that at one point the two sounds were reanalyzed as allophones of each other.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Russian vowels are subject to considerable [[allophony]], subject to both stress and the palatalization of neighboring consonants.  In most unstressed positions, in fact, only three phonemes are distinguished after hard consonants, and only two after soft consonants.  Unstressed {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} have merged to {{IPA|/a/}} (a phenomenon known as {{lang-rus|а́канье|[[akanye|ákan'je]]}}); unstressed {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/e/}} have merged  to {{IPA|/i/}} ({{lang-rus|и́канье|[[ikanye|íkan'je]]}}); and all four unstressed vowels have merged after soft consonants, except in absolute final position in a word.  None of these mergers are represented in writing.

==== Front vowels ====
When a preceding consonant is ''hard'', {{IPA|/i/}} is retracted to {{IPAblink|ɨ}}. Formant studies in {{Harvcoltxt|Padgett|2001}} demonstrate that {{IPAblink|ɨ}} is better characterized as slightly [[diphthong]]ized from the [[velarization]] of the preceding consonant,&lt;ref&gt;Thus, {{IPA|/ɨ/}} is pronounced something like {{IPA|[ɤ̯ɪ]}}, with the first part sounding as an on-glide {{Harvcoltxt|Padgett|2003b|p=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; implying that a phonological pattern of using velarization to enhance perceptual distinctiveness between hard and soft consonants is strongest before {{IPA|/i/}}. When unstressed, {{IPA|/i/}} becomes [[near-close vowel|near-close]]; that is, {{IPAblink|ɨ̞}} following a hard consonant and {{IPAblink|ɪ}} in most other environments.{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|pp=37-38}} Between soft consonants, both stressed and unstressed {{IPA|/i/}} are raised,{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|p=31}} as in {{lang|ru|пить}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-пить.ogg|[pʲi̝tʲ]}} ('to drink') and {{lang|ru|маленький}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-маленький.ogg|[ˈmalʲɪ̝nʲkʲɪj]|help=no}} ('small'). When preceded ''and'' followed by [[coronal consonant|coronal]] or [[dorsal consonant|dorsal]] consonants, {{IPAblink|ɨ}} is fronted to {{IPA|[ɨ̟]}}.{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|p=33}} After a cluster of a labial and {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPAblink|ɨ}} is retracted, as in {{lang|ru|плыть}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-плыть.ogg|[pɫɨ̠tʲ]|help=no}} ('to float'); it is also slightly diphthongized to {{IPA|[ɯ̟ɨ̟]}}.{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|p=33}}

In native words, {{IPA|/e/}} only follows unpaired (i.e. the [[retroflex consonant|retroflexes]] and {{IPA|/t͡s/}}) and soft consonants. After soft consonants (but not before), it is a mid vowel {{IPAblink|ɛ̝}} (hereafter represented without the diacritic for simplicity), while a following soft consonant raises it to close-mid {{IPAblink|e}}. Another allophone, an open-mid {{IPAblink|ɛ}} occurs word-initially and between hard consonants.{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|pp=41-44}} Preceding hard consonants retract {{IPA|/e/}} to {{IPA|[ɛ̠]}} and {{IPA|[e̠]}}{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|p=193}} so that {{lang|ru|жест}} ('gesture') and {{lang|ru|цель}} ('target') are pronounced {{Audio-IPA|Ru-жест.ogg|[ʐɛ̠st]|help=no}} and {{Audio-IPA|Ru-цель.ogg|[t͡se̠lʲ]|help=no}} respectively.

In words borrowed from other languages, {{IPA|/e/}} rarely follows soft consonants; this foreign pronunciation often persists in Russian for many years until the word is more fully adopted into Russian.{{sfn|Halle|1959|p=63}} For instance, {{lang|ru|шофёр}} (from French ''chauffeur'') was pronounced {{Audio-IPA|Ru-шофёр (20th cent).ogg|[ʂoˈfɛr]|help=no}} in the early twentieth century,&lt;ref&gt;As in [[Igor Severyanin]]'s poem, [http://poetrylibrary.ru/stixiya/severyanin-1.html {{lang|ru|Сегодня не приду}} . . .]&lt;/ref&gt; but is now pronounced {{Audio-IPA|Ru-шофёр.ogg|[ʂɐˈfʲɵr]|help=no}}. On the other hand, the pronunciations of words such as {{lang|ru|отель}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-отель.ogg|[ɐˈtɛlʲ]|help=no}} ('hotel') retain the hard consonants despite a long presence in the language.

==== Back vowels ====
Between soft consonants, {{IPA|/a/}} becomes {{IPAblink|æ}},{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|p=50}} as in {{lang|ru|пять}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-пять.ogg|[pʲætʲ]}} ('five'). When not following a soft consonant, {{IPA|/a/}} is retracted to {{IPAblink|ɑ|ɑ̟}} before {{IPA|/l/}} as in {{lang|ru|палка}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-палка.ogg|[ˈpɑ̟ɫkə]|help=no}} ('stick').{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|p=50}}

For most speakers, {{IPA|/o/}} is a mid vowel {{IPAblink|o̞}}, but it can be more open {{IPAblink|ɔ}} for some speakers.{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|p=56}} Following a soft consonant, {{IPA|/o/}} is [[Relative articulation#Centralized|centralized]] and [[Relative articulation#Raised and lowered vowels|raised]] to {{IPAblink|ɵ}} as in {{lang|ru|тётя}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-тётя.ogg|[ˈtʲɵtʲə]|help=no}} ('aunt').{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|p=62}}{{sfn|Halle|1959|p=166}}

As with the other back vowels, {{IPA|/u/}} is centralized to {{IPAblink|ʉ}} between soft consonants, as in {{lang|ru|чуть}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-чуть.ogg|[t͡ɕʉtʲ]|help=no}} ('narrowly'). When unstressed, {{IPA|/u/}} becomes near-close; central {{IPAblink|ʉ̞}} between soft consonants, centralized back {{IPAblink|ʊ}} in other positions.{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|pp=67-69}}

==== Unstressed vowels ====
{{Main|Vowel reduction in Russian}}

Russian [[unstressed vowel]]s have lower intensity and lower energy. They are typically shorter than stressed vowels, and {{IPA|/a e o i/}} in most unstressed positions tend to undergo [[merger (phonology)|mergers]] for most dialects:{{sfn|Crosswhite|2000|p=112}}
* {{IPA|/o/}} has merged with {{IPA|/a/}}: for instance, {{lang|ru|валы́}} 'bulwarks' and {{lang|ru|волы́}} 'oxen' are both pronounced {{IPA|/vaˈlɨ/}}, phonetically {{Audio-IPA|Ru-валы.ogg|[vɐˈɫɨ]|help=no}}.
* {{IPA|/e/}} has merged with {{IPA|/i/}} (or {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/ɨ/}} if {{IPA|/ɨ/}} is considered a phoneme): for instance, {{lang|ru|лиса́}} (''lisá'') 'fox' and {{lang|ru|леса́}} 'forests' are both pronounced {{IPA|/lʲiˈsa/}}, phonetically {{Audio-IPA|Ru-лиса.ogg|[lʲɪˈsa]|help=no}}.{{examples needed|reason=Need an example, preferably  a minimal pair, of |e| and |ɨ| (or /i/ after a hard consonant) both reducing to /ɨ/ or /i/.|date=July 2017}}
* {{IPA|/a {{clarify|date=July 2017|reason=/o/ after soft consonants is always stressed in native words and it is denoted by «ё»; even loans with «йо» /jo/ are mostly stressed.|text=o}}/}}{{#tag:ref|{{IPA|/o/}} has merged with {{IPA|/i/}} if words such as {{wikt-lang|ru|тепло́}} {{IPA|/tʲiˈpɫo/}} 'heat' are analyzed as having the same morphophonemes as related words such as {{wikt-lang|ru|тёплый}} {{IPA|/ˈtʲopɫij/}} 'warm', meaning that both of them have the stem {{IPA|{{!}}tʲopl-{{!}}}}. Alternatively, they can be analyzed as having two different morphophonemes, {{IPA|{{!}}o{{!}}}} and {{IPA|{{!}}e{{!}}}}: {{IPA|{{!}}tʲopɫ-{{!}}}} vs. {{IPA|{{!}}tʲepɫ-{{!}}}}. In that analysis, {{IPA|{{!}}o{{!}}}} does not occur in {{wikt-lang|ru|тепло́}}, so {{IPA|{{!}}o{{!}}}} does not merge with {{IPA|{{!}}i{{!}}}}. Historically, the {{IPA|{{!}}o{{!}}}} developed from {{IPA|{{!}}e{{!}}}}: see {{section link|History of the Russian language|The yo vowel}}.}} have merged with {{IPA|/i/}} after soft consonants: for instance, {{wikt-lang|ru|ме́сяц}} (''mésjats'') 'month' is pronounced {{IPA|/ˈmʲesʲit͡s/}}, phonetically {{audio-IPA|Ru-месяц.ogg|[ˈmʲesʲɪt͡s]|help=no}}.

The merger of unstressed {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} in particular is less universal in the [[pretonic]] (pre-accented) position than that of unstressed {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/a/}}. For example, speakers of some rural dialects as well as the "Old Petersburgian" pronunciation may have the latter but not the former merger, distinguishing between {{lang|ru|лиса́}} {{IPA|[lʲɪˈsa]}} and {{lang|ru|леса́}} {{IPA|[lʲɘˈsa]}}, but not between {{lang|ru|валы́}} and {{lang|ru|волы́}} (both {{IPA|[vɐˈɫɨ]}}). The distinction in some ''loanwords'' between unstressed {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}}, or {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} is codified in some pronunciation dictionaries ({{Harvcoltxt|Avanesov|1985|p=663}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Zarva|1993|p=15}}), for example, {{lang|ru|фо́рте}} {{IPA|[ˈfortɛ]}} and {{lang|ru|ве́то}} {{IPA|[ˈvʲeto]}}.

{{citation needed span|Unstressed {{IPA|/e/}} is sometimes preserved word-finally, for example in second-person plural or [[formal you|formal]] verb forms with the ending {{lang|ru|-те}}, such as {{wikt-lang|ru|де́лаете}} ("you do") {{IPA|/ˈdʲeɫajitʲe/}} (phonetically {{IPA|[ˈdʲeɫə(j)ɪtʲe]}}).|date=July 2017}}

As a result, in most unstressed positions, only three vowel phonemes are distinguished after hard consonants ({{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/a ~ o/}}, and {{IPA|/e ~ i/}}), and only two after soft consonants ({{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/a ~ o ~ e ~ i/}}). For the most part, [[Russian orthography]] (as opposed to that of closely [[genetic (linguistics)|related]] [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]) does ''not'' reflect vowel reduction. This can be seen in Russian {{wikt-lang|ru|не́бо}} (''nébo'') as against Belarusian {{wikt-lang|be|не́ба}} (''néba'') "sky", both of which can be phonemically analyzed as {{IPA|/ˈnʲeba/}}.

===== Vowel mergers =====
In terms of actual pronunciation, there are at least two different levels of vowel reduction: vowels are less reduced when a syllable immediately precedes the stressed one, and more reduced in other positions.{{Sfn|Avanesov|1975|p=105-106}} This is particularly visible in the realization of unstressed {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/a/}}, where a less-reduced allophone {{IPAblink|ɐ}} appears alongside a more-reduced allophone {{IPAblink|ə}}.

The pronunciation of unstressed {{IPA|/o ~ a/}} is as follows:

# {{IPAblink|ɐ}} (sometimes transcribed as {{IPAblink|ʌ}}; the former is phonetically correct for the standard Moscow pronunciation, whereas the latter is phonetically correct for the standard Saint Petersburg pronunciation;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yanushevskaya|Bunčić|2015|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; this article uses only the symbol {{IPAblink|ɐ}}) appears in the following positions:
#* In the syllable immediately before the stress, when a hard consonant precedes:{{sfn|Padgett|Tabain|2005|p=16}} {{lang|ru|паро́м}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-паром.ogg|[pɐˈrom]}} ('ferry'), {{lang|ru|трава́}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-трава.ogg|[trɐˈva]|help=no}} ('grass').
#* In absolute word-initial position.{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|p=51}}
#* In [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]], when the vowel occurs twice without a consonant between; this is written {{angbr|aa}}, {{angbr|ao}}, {{angbr|oa}}, or {{angbr|oo}}:{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|p=51}} {{lang|ru|сообража́ть}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-соображать.ogg|[sɐ.ɐbrɐˈʐatʲ]|help=no}} ('to use common sense, to reason').
# {{IPAblink|ə}} appears elsewhere, when a hard consonant precedes: {{lang|ru|о́блако}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-облако.ogg|[ˈobɫəkə]|help=no}} ('cloud').
# When a soft consonant or {{IPA|/j/}} precedes, both {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} merge with {{IPA|/i/}} and are pronounced as {{IPAblink|ɪ}}. Example: {{lang|ru|язы́к}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-язык.ogg|[jɪˈzɨk]|help=no}} 'tongue'). {{IPA|/o/}} is written as {{angbr|e}} in these positions.
#* This merger also tends to occur after formerly soft consonants now pronounced hard ({{IPA|/ʐ/}}, {{IPA|/ʂ/}}, {{IPA|/t͡s/}}),{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|p=194}} where the pronunciation {{IPAblink|ɨ̞}} (which after {{IPA|/t͡s/}} can be even lower {{IPAblink|ɘ}}){{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|p=38}} occurs. This always occurs when the spelling uses the soft vowel variants, e.g. {{lang|ru|жена́}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-жена.ogg|[ʐɨ̞ˈna]}} ('wife'), with underlying {{IPA|/o/}}.{{citation needed|reason=Wiktionary lists Proto-Slavic *žena, suggesting that the underlying sound is /e/.|date=September 2016}} However, it also occurs in a few word roots where the spelling writes a hard {{IPA|/a/}}.{{Sfn|Avanesov|1985|p=663}}{{Sfn|Zarva|1993|p=13}} Examples:
#** {{lang|ru|жал-}} 'regret': e.g. {{lang|ru|жале́ть}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-жалеть.ogg|[ʐɨˈlʲetʲ]|help=no}} ('to regret'), к сожалéнию {{Audio-IPA|Ru-к сожалению.ogg|[ksəʐɨˈlʲenʲɪju]|help=no}} ('unfortunately').
#** {{lang|ru|ло́шадь}} 'horse', e.g. {{lang|ru|лошаде́й}}, {{Audio-IPA|Ru-лошадей.ogg|[ɫəʂɨˈdʲej]|help=no}} (pl. gen. and acc.).
#** {{lang|ru|-дцать-}} in numbers: e.g. {{lang|ru|двадцати́}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-двадцати.ogg|[dvət͡sɨˈtʲi]|help=no}} ('twenty [gen., dat., prep.]'), {{lang|ru|тридцатью́}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-тридцатью.ogg|[trʲɪt͡sɨˈtʲju]|help=no}} ('thirty [instr.]').
#** {{lang|ru|ржано́й}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-ржаной.ogg|[rʐɨˈnoj]|help=no}} ('rye [adj. m. nom.]').
#** {{lang|ru|жасми́н}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-жасмин.ogg|[ʐɨˈsmʲin]|help=no}} ('jasmine').
#These processes occur even across word boundaries as in {{lang|ru|под морем}} {{IPA|[pɐd‿ˈmorʲɪm]}} ('under the sea').

The pronunciation of unstressed {{IPA|/e ~ i/}} is {{IPAblink|ɪ}} after soft consonants and {{IPA|/j/}}, and word-initially ({{lang|ru|эта́п}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-этап.ogg|[ɪˈtap]|help=no}} ('stage')), but {{IPAblink|ɨ̞}} after hard consonants ({{lang|ru|дыша́ть}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-дышать.ogg|[dɨ̞ˈʂatʲ]|help=no}} ('to breathe')).

There are a number of exceptions to the above vowel-reduction rules:
* Vowels may not merge in foreign borrowings,{{Sfn|Avanesov|1985|p=663-666}}{{Sfn|Zarva|1993|p=12-17}}{{sfn|Halle|1959}} particularly with unusual or recently borrowed words such as {{lang|ru|ра́дио}}, {{Audio-IPA|Ru-радио.ogg|[ˈradʲɪ.o]}} 'radio'.  In such words, unstressed {{IPA|/a/}} may be pronounced as {{IPAblink|ɐ}}, regardless of context; unstressed {{IPA|/e/}} does not merge with {{IPA|/i/}} in initial position or after vowels, so word pairs like {{lang|ru|эмигра́нт}} and {{lang|ru|иммигра́нт}}, or {{lang|ru|эмити́ровать}} and {{lang|ru|имити́ровать}}, differ in pronunciation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}
*Across certain word-final inflections, the reductions do not completely apply. For example, after soft or unpaired consonants, unstressed {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} of a final syllable may be distinguished from each other.{{Sfn|Avanesov|1975|p=121-125}}{{Sfn|Avanesov|1985|p=666}} For example, {{lang|ru|жи́тели}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-жители.ogg|[ˈʐɨtʲɪlʲɪ]|help=no}} ('residents') contrasts with both {{lang|ru|(о) жи́теле}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-о жителе.ogg|[(ɐ) ˈʐɨtʲɪlʲɪ̞]|help=no}} ('[about] a resident') and {{lang|ru|жи́теля}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-жителя.ogg|[ˈʐɨtʲɪlʲə]|help=no}} ('of a resident').
*If the first vowel of {{angbr|oa}}, or {{angbr|oo}} belongs to the conjunctions {{lang|ru|но}} ('but') or {{lang|ru|то}} ('then'), it is not reduced, even when unstressed.{{Sfn|Zarva|1983|p=16}}

===== Other changes =====
Unstressed {{IPA|/u/}} is generally pronounced as a lax (or [[near-close vowel|near-close]]) {{IPAblink|ʊ}}, e.g. {{lang|ru|мужчи́на}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-мужчина.ogg|[mʊˈɕːinə]}} ('man').  Between soft consonants, it becomes centralized to {{IPAblink|ʉ̞}}, as in {{lang|ru|юти́ться}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-ютиться.ogg|[jʉ̞ˈtʲit͡sə]|help=no}} ('to huddle').

Note a spelling irregularity in {{IPA|/s/}} of the reflexive suffix {{lang|ru|-ся}}: with a preceding {{lang|ru|-т-}} in third-person present and a {{lang|ru|-ть-}} in infinitive, it is pronounced as {{IPA|[t͡sə]}}, i.e. hard instead of with its soft counterpart, since {{IPA|[t͡s]}}, normally spelled with {{angbr|ц}}, is traditionally always hard. In other forms both pronunciations {{IPA|[sə]}} and {{IPA|[sʲə]}} alternate for a speaker with some usual form-dependent preferences: in the outdated dialects, reflexive imperative verbs (such as {{lang|ru|бо́йся}}, lit. "be afraid yourself") may be pronounced with {{IPA|[sə]}} instead of modern (and phonetically consistent) {{IPA|[sʲə]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wade|first=Terence Leslie Brian|title=A Comprehensive Russian Grammar|year=2010|page=10|isbn=978-1-4051-3639-6|edition=3rd|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In weakly stressed positions, vowels may become voiceless between two voiceless consonants: {{lang|ru|вы́ставка}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-выставка.ogg|[ˈvɨstə̥fkə]|help=no}} ('exhibition'), {{lang|ru|потому́ что}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-потому что.ogg|[pə̥tɐˈmu ʂtə]|help=no}} ('because'). This may also happen in cases where only the following consonant is voiceless: {{lang|ru|че́реп}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-череп.ogg|[ˈt͡ɕerʲɪ̥p]|help=no}} ('skull').

===== Phonemic analysis =====
Because of mergers of different phonemes in unstressed position, the assignment of a particular phone to a phoneme requires phonological analysis. There have been different approaches to this problem:{{Sfn|Avanesov|1975|p=37-40}}

*The Saint Petersburg phonology school assigns allophones to particular phonemes.  For example, any {{IPAblink|ɐ}} is considered as a realization of {{IPA|/a/}}.
*The Moscow phonology school uses an analysis with [[morphophoneme]]s ({{lang|ru|морфоне́мы}}, singular {{lang|ru|морфоне́ма}}). It treats a given unstressed allophone as belonging to a particular morphophoneme depending on morphological alternations, or on etymology (which is often reflected in the spelling). For example, {{IPAblink|ɐ}} is analyzed as either {{IPA|{{!}}a{{!}}}} or {{IPA|{{!}}o{{!}}}}. To make a determination, one must seek out instances where an unstressed morpheme containing {{IPAblink|ɐ}} in one word is stressed in another word.  Thus, because the word {{wikt-lang|ru|валы́}} {{IPA|[vɐˈɫɨ]}} ('shafts') shows an alternation with {{wikt-lang|ru|вал}} {{IPA|[vaɫ]}} ('shaft'), this instance of {{IPA|[ɐ]}} belongs to the morphophoneme {{IPA|{{!}}a{{!}}}}.  Meanwhile, {{wikt-lang|ru|волы́}} {{IPA|[vɐˈɫɨ]}} ('oxen') alternates with {{wikt-lang|ru|вол}} {{IPA|[voɫ]}} ('ox'), showing that this instance of {{IPAblink|ɐ}} belongs to the morphophoneme {{IPA|{{!}}o{{!}}}}. If there are no alternations between stressed and unstressed syllables for a particular morpheme, then the assignment is based on etymology.
*Some linguists&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Avanesov|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; prefer to avoid making the decision. Their terminology includes strong vowel phonemes (the five) for stressed vowels plus several weak phonemes for unstressed vowels: thus, {{IPAblink|ɐ}} represents the weak phoneme {{IPA|/ɐ/}}, which contrasts with other weak phonemes, but not with strong ones.

===Diphthongs===
Russian diphthongs all end in a non-syllabic {{IPA|[i̯]}}, an allophone of {{IPA|/j/}} and the only [[semivowel]] in Russian. In all contexts other than after a vowel, {{IPA|/j/}} is considered an approximant consonant. Phonological descriptions of {{IPA|/j/}} may also classify it as a consonant even in the coda. In such descriptions, Russian has no diphthongs.

The first part of diphthongs are subject to the same allophony as their constituent vowels. Examples of words with diphthongs: {{wikt-lang|ru|яйцо́}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-яйцо.ogg|[jɪjˈt͡so]}} ('egg'), {{lang|ru|ей}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-ей.ogg|[jej]|help=no}} ('her' dat.), {{lang|ru|де́йственный}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-действенный.ogg|[ˈdʲejstvʲɪnnɨj]|help=no}} ('effective'). {{IPA|/ij/}}, written {{angbr|-ий}} or {{angbr|-ый}}, is a common inflexional affix of adjectives, participles, and nouns, where it is often unstressed; at normal conversational speed, such unstressed endings may be monophthongized to {{IPAblink|ɪ̟}}.{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|p=37}}

; Notes
* Most consonant phonemes come in hard–soft pairs, except for always-hard {{IPA|/t͡s, ʂ, ʐ/}} and always-soft {{IPA|/t͡ɕ, ɕː, j/}} and formerly {{IPA|/ʑː/}}. There is a marked tendency of Russian hard consonants to be velarized, though this is a subject of some academic dispute.{{sfn|Padgett|2001|p=7}}&lt;ref name="ashby133"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ashby|2011|p=133}}: "Note that though Russian has traditionally been described as having all consonants either palatalized or velarized, recent data suggests that the velarized gesture is only used with laterals giving a phonemic contrast between {{IPA|/lʲ/}} and {{IPA|/ɫ/}} (...)."&lt;/ref&gt; Velarization is clearest before the front vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}}.{{sfn|Padgett|2003b|p=319}}&lt;ref&gt;Because of the acoustic properties of {{IPA|[u]}} and {{IPA|[i]}} that make velarization more noticeable before front vowels and palatalization before back vowels {{Harvcoltxt|Padgett|2003b}} argues that the contrast before {{IPA|/i/}} is between ''velarized'' and ''plain'' consonants rather than ''plain'' and ''palatalized''.&lt;/ref&gt;
** {{IPA|/ʐ/}} and {{IPA|/ʂ/}} are always hard in native words (even if spelling contains a "softening" letter after them, as in {{lang|ru|жена}}, {{lang|ru|шёлк}}, {{lang|ru|жить}}, {{lang|ru|мышь}}, {{lang|ru|жюри}}, {{lang|ru|парашют}} etc.), and for most speakers also in foreign proper names, mostly of French or Lithuanian origin (e.g. {{lang|ru|[[Gölcük, Kocaeli|Гёльджюк]]}} {{IPA|[ˈɡʲɵlʲdʐʊk]}}, {{lang|ru|[[Jeune Afrique|Жён Африк]]}} {{IPA|[ˈʐon ɐˈfrʲik]}}, {{lang|ru|[[Jules Verne|Жюль Верн]]}} {{IPA|[ˈʐulʲ ˈvɛrn]}}, {{lang|ru|[[Gerhard Schürer|Герхард Шюрер]]}} {{IPA|[ˈɡʲɛrxərt ˈʂurɨr]}}, {{lang|ru|[[Šiauliai|Шяуляй]]}}, {{lang|ru|[[Šešuvis|Шяшувис]]}}).&lt;ref&gt;See dicionaries of {{Harvcoltxt|Ageenko|Zarva|1993}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Borunova|Vorontsova|Yes'kova|1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Long phonemes {{IPA|/ʑː/}} and {{IPA|/ɕː/}} do not pattern in the same ways that other hard–soft pairs do. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
** {{IPA|/t͡s/}} is generally listed among the always-hard consonants; however, certain foreign proper names, including those of Ukrainian, Polish, Lithuanian, or German origin (e.g. {{lang|ru|[[Alexander Tsiurupa|Цюрупа]]}}, {{lang|ru|Пацюк}}, {{lang|ru|Цявловский}}, {{lang|ru|[[Zürich|Цюрих]]}}), as well as loanwords (e.g., {{lang|ru|хуацяо}}, from Chinese) contain a soft {{IPA|[t͡sʲ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;The dictionary {{Harvcoltxt|Агеенко|Зарва|1993}} explicitly says that the nonpalatalized pronunciation {{IPA|/t͡s/}} is an error in such cases.&lt;/ref&gt; The phonemicity of a soft {{IPA|/t͡sʲ/}} is supported by neologisms that come from native word-building processes (e.g. {{lang|ru|фрицёнок}}, {{lang|ru|шпицята}}).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} However, according to {{Harvcoltxt|Yanushevskaya|Bunčić|2015}}, {{IPA|/t͡s/}} really is always hard, and realizing it as palatalized {{IPA|[t͡sʲ]}} is considered "emphatically non-standard", and occurs only in some regional accents.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yanushevskaya|Bunčić|2015|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** {{IPA|/t͡ɕ/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} are always soft.
** {{IPA|/ɕː/}} is also always soft. A formerly common pronunciation of {{IPA|/ɕ/+/t͡ɕ/}}&lt;ref&gt;See Avanesov's pronunciation guide in {{Harvcoltxt|Borunova|Vorontsova|Yes'kova|1983|p=669}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates the sound may be two [[underlying representation|underlying]] phonemes: {{IPA|/ʂ/}} and {{IPA|/t͡ɕ/}}, thus {{IPA|/ɕː/}} can be considered as a marginal phoneme. In today's most widespread pronunciation, {{IPA|[ɕt͡ɕ]}} appears (instead of {{IPA|[ɕː]}}) for orthographical {{lang|ru|-зч-/-сч-}} where {{lang|ru|ч-}} starts the root of a word, and -з/-с belongs to a preposition or a "clearly distinguishable" prefix (e.g. {{lang|ru|без часо́в}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-без часов.ogg|[bʲɪɕt͡ɕɪˈsof]}}, 'without a clock'; {{lang|ru|расчерти́ть}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-расчертить.ogg|[rəɕt͡ɕɪrˈtʲitʲ]|help=no}}, 'to rule'); in all other cases {{IPA|/ɕː/}} is used ({{wikt-lang|ru|щётка}} {{audio-IPA|Ru-щётка.ogg|[ˈɕːɵtkə]|help=no}}, {{wikt-lang|ru|гру́зчик}} {{audio-IPA|Ru-грузчик.ogg|[ˈɡruɕːɪk]|help=no}}, {{lang|ru|перепи́счик}} {{IPA|[pʲɪrʲɪˈpʲiɕːɪk]}}, {{lang|ru|сча́стье}} {{audio-IPA|Ru-счастье.ogg|[ˈɕːæsʲtʲjə]|help=no}}, {{wikt-lang|ru|мужчи́на}} {{audio-IPA|Ru-мужчина.ogg|[mʊˈɕːinə]|help=no}}, {{lang|ru|исщипа́ть}} {{IPA|[ɪɕːɪˈpatʲ]}}, {{lang|ru|расщепи́ть}} {{IPA|[rəɕːɪˈpʲitʲ]}} etc.)
** The marginal{{sfn|Padgett|2003a|p=42}} phoneme {{IPA|/ʑː/}} is used only by speakers of the conservative Moscow accent, and is somewhat obsolete. The corresponding modern pronunciation is hard {{IPAblink|ʐ|ʐː}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yanushevskaya|Bunčić|2015|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sound may derive from an underlying {{IPA|/zʐ/}} or {{IPA|/sʐ/}}: {{lang|ru|заезжа́ть}} {{IPA|[zə(ɪ̯)ɪˈʑːætʲ]}}, modern {{audio-IPA|Ru-заезжать.ogg|[zə(ɪ̯)ɪˈʐːatʲ]|help=no}}. In modern accent it can only be formed by assimilative voicing of {{IPA|[ɕː]}} (including across words): {{wikt-lang|ru|вещдо́к}} {{IPA|[vʲɪʑːˈdok]}}. For more information, see [[alveolo-palatal consonant]] and [[retroflex consonant]].
* {{IPA|/ʂ/}} and {{IPA|/ʐ/}} are somewhat [[tongue shape|concave]] [[apical consonant|apical]] postalveolar.{{sfn|Hamann|2004|p=64}} They may be described as retroflex, e.g. by {{harvtxt|Hamann|2004}}, but this is to indicate that they are not laminal nor palatalized; not to say that they are [[subapical]].{{sfn|Hamann|2004|p=56|ps=, "Summing up the articulatory criteria for retroflex fricatives, they are all articulated behind the alveolar ridge, show a sub-lingual cavity, are articulated with the tongue tip (though this is not always discernible in the x-ray tracings), and with a retracted and flat tongue body."}}
* Hard {{IPA|/t, d, n/}} are laminal [[Denti-alveolar consonant|denti-alveolar]] {{IPA|[t̪, d̪, n̪]}}; unlike in many other languages, {{IPA|/n/}} does not become velar {{IPAblink|ŋ}} before velar consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jones|Ward|1969|pp=99 and 160}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hard {{IPA|/ɫ/}} has been variously described as pharyngealized apical alveolar {{IPAblink|ɫ|l̺ˤ}}&lt;ref name="SOWL187"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Koneczna|Zawadowski|1956|p=?}}, cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; and velarized laminal denti-alveolar {{IPAblink|ɫ|l̪ˠ}}.&lt;ref name="ashby133"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jones|Ward|1969|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Mathiassen|1996|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Soft {{IPA|/rʲ/}} is an apical dental tap {{IPA|[ɾ̪ʲ]}} or, less often, an apical dental trill {{IPA|[r̪ʲ]}}.&lt;ref name="SOWL221"/&gt;
* Soft {{IPA|/tʲ, dʲ, nʲ/}} are laminal alveolar {{IPA|[t̻ʲ&lt;sup&gt;sʲ&lt;/sup&gt;, d̻ʲ&lt;sup&gt;zʲ&lt;/sup&gt;, n̻ʲ]}}; as indicated in the transcription, in case of the first two the tongue is raised enough to produce slight frication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jones|Ward|1969|pp=104–105 and 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Soft {{IPA|/lʲ/}} is either laminal alveolar {{IPA|[l̻ʲ]}} or laminal denti-alveolar {{IPA|[l̪ʲ]}}.&lt;ref name="SOWL187"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jones|Ward|1969|p=172}}. This source mentions only the laminal alveolar realization.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/t͡s, s, sʲ, z, zʲ/}} are dental {{IPA|[t̪͡s̪, s̪, s̪ʲ, z̪, z̪ʲ]}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Zygis|2003|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. dentalized laminal alveolar. They are pronounced with the blade of the tongue very close to the upper front teeth, with the tip of the tongue resting behind lower front teeth.
* The voiced {{IPA|/v, vʲ/}} are often realized with weak friction {{IPA|[v̞, v̞ʲ]}} or even as approximants {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ʋ}}, {{IPA link|ʋ|ʋʲ}}]}}, particularly in spontaneous speech.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* A marginal phoneme {{IPA|/ɣ/}} occurs instead of {{IPA|/ɡ/}} in certain interjections: {{wikt-lang|ru|ага́}}, {{wikt-lang|ru|ого́}}, {{lang|ru|угу́}}, {{lang|ru|эге}}, {{lang|ru|о-го-го́}}, {{lang|ru|э-ге-ге}}, {{lang|ru|гоп}}. (Thus, there exists a minimal pair of [[homograph]]s: {{lang|ru|ага́}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-ага (ɣ).ogg|[ɐˈɣa]}} 'aha!' vs {{lang|ru|ага́}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-ага_(2).ogg|[ɐˈɡa]|help=no}} '[[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]'). The same sound {{IPA|[ɣ]}} can be found in {{wikt-lang|ru|бухга́лтер}} (spelled {{angle bracket|хг}}, though in {{lang|ru|цейхга́уз}}, {{angle bracket|хг}} is {{IPA|[x]}}), optionally in {{lang|ru|га́битус}} and in a few other loanwords. Also optionally (and less frequently than a century ago) {{IPA|[ɣ]}} can be used instead of {{IPA|[ɡ]}} in certain religious words (a phenomenon influenced by [[Church Slavonic]] pronunciation): {{lang|ru|Бо́га}}, {{lang|ru|Бо́гу}}... (declension forms of {{lang|ru|Бог}} 'God'), {{lang|ru|Госпо́дь}} 'Lord' (especially in the exclamation {{lang|ru|Го́споди!}} 'Oh Lord!'), {{lang|ru|благо́й}} 'good'.
* Some linguists (like I. G. Dobrodomov and his school) postulate the existence of a phonemic [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}}. This marginal phoneme can be found, for example, in the word {{lang|ru|не́-а}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-не-а.ogg|[ˈnʲeʔə]}}. Claimed minimal pairs for this phoneme include {{wikt-lang|ru|су́женный}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-суженный.ogg|[ˈsʔuʐɨnɨj]|help=no}} 'narrowed' (a participle from {{wikt-lang|ru|су́зить}} 'to narrow', with prefix {{wikt-lang|ru|с-}} and root {{lang|ru|-уз-}}, cf. {{lang|ru|у́зкий}} 'narrow') vs {{lang|ru|су́женый}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-суженый.ogg|[ˈsuʐɨnɨj]|help=no}} 'betrothed' (originally a participle from {{lang|ru|суди́ть}} 'to judge', now an adjective; the root is {{lang|ru|суд}} 'court') and {{lang|ru|с А́ней}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-с Аней.ogg|[ˈsʔanʲɪj]|help=no}} 'with Ann' vs {{lang|ru|Са́ней}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-Саней.ogg|[ˈsanʲɪj]|help=no}} '(by) Alex'.{{sfn|Dobrodomov|Izmest'eva|2002}}{{sfn|Dobrodomov|Izmest'eva|2009}}&lt;!--except with не-а, this spelling seems to appear only if forced to distinguish spelling. For {{lang|ru|суженный}} it's even difficult to reproduce for me.--&gt;

There is some dispute over the phonemicity of soft velar consonants. Typically, the soft–hard distinction is allophonic for velar consonants: they become soft before [[front vowel]]s, as in {{wikt-lang|ru|коро́ткий}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-короткий.ogg|[kɐˈrotkʲɪj]|help=no}} ('short'), unless there is a word boundary, in which case they are hard (e.g. {{lang|ru|к Ива́ну}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-к Ивану.ogg|[k‿ɨˈvanu]|help=no}} 'to Ivan').{{sfn|Padgett|2003a|pp=44, 47}} Hard variants occur everywhere else. Exceptions are represented mostly by:
* Loanwords:
** '''Soft''': {{lang|ru|гёзы}}, {{wikt-lang|ru|гюрза́}}, {{lang|ru|гяу́р}}, {{lang|ru|секью́рити}}, {{lang|ru|кекс}}, {{lang|ru|кяри́з}}, {{lang|ru|са́нкхья}}, {{lang|ru|хянга́}};
** '''Hard''': {{lang|ru|кок-сагы́з}}, {{lang|ru|гэ́льский}}, {{lang|ru|акы́н}}, {{lang|ru|кэб}} ({{lang|ru|кеб}}), {{lang|ru|хэ́ппенинг}}.
* Proper nouns of foreign origin:
** '''Soft''': {{lang|ru|Алигье́ри}}, {{lang|ru|Гёте}}, {{lang|ru|Гю́нтер}}, {{lang|ru|Гянджа́}}, {{lang|ru|Джокьяка́рта}}, {{lang|ru|Кёнигсберг}}, {{lang|ru|Кюраса́о}}, {{lang|ru|Кя́хта}}, {{lang|ru|Хью́стон}}, {{lang|ru|Хёндэ}}, {{lang|ru|Хю́бнер}}, {{lang|ru|Пюхяя́рви}};
** '''Hard''': {{lang|ru|Мангышла́к}}, {{lang|ru|Гэ́ри}}, {{lang|ru|Кызылку́м}}, {{lang|ru|Кэмп-Дэ́вид}}, {{lang|ru|Архы́з}}, {{lang|ru|Хуанхэ́}}.

The rare native examples are fairly new, as most them were coined in the last century:
* '''Soft''': forms of the verb {{lang|ru|ткать}} 'weave' ({{lang|ru|ткёшь}}, {{lang|ru|ткёт}} etc., and derivatives like {{lang|ru|соткёшься}}); {{lang|ru|догёнок}}/{{lang|ru|догята}}, {{lang|ru|герцогёнок}}/{{lang|ru|герцогята}}&lt;!--a heavy neologism--&gt;; and adverbial participles of the type {{lang|ru|берегя}}, {{lang|ru|стерегя}}, {{lang|ru|стригя}}, {{lang|ru|жгя}}, {{lang|ru|пекя}}, {{lang|ru|секя}}, {{lang|ru|ткя}} (it is disputed whether these are part of the standard language or just informal colloquialisms){{citation needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;!--at school I've learned that these cases are as incorrect as *the hypoctriticalest, and are heared by me similary as it by you--&gt;;
* '''Hard''': the name {{lang|ru|гэ}} of letter {{angle bracket|г}}, acronyms and derived words ({{lang|ru|кагебешник}}, {{lang|ru|днепрогэсовский}}), a few interjections ({{lang|ru|гы, кыш, хэй}}), some onomatopoeic words ({{lang|ru|гыгыкать}}), and colloquial forms of certain patronyms: {{lang|ru|Олегыч}}, {{lang|ru|Маркыч}}, {{lang|ru|Аристархыч}} (where {{lang|ru|-ыч}} is a contraction of standard language's patronymical suffix -ович rather than a continuation of ancient {{lang|ru|-ич}}).

In the mid-twentieth century, a small number of reductionist approaches made by [[structuralism|structuralists]]{{sfn|Stankiewicz|1962|p=131}} put forth that palatalized consonants occur as the result of a phonological processes involving {{IPA|/j/}} (or palatalization as a phoneme in itself), so that there were no underlying palatalized consonants.&lt;ref&gt;see {{Harvcoltxt|Lightner|1972}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Bidwell|1962}} for two examples.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such proposals, linguists have long agreed that the underlying structure of Russian is closer to that of its acoustic properties, namely that soft consonants are separate phonemes in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvcoltxt|Stankiewicz|1962}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Folejewski|1962}} for a criticism of Bidwell's approach specifically and the reductionist approach generally.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonological processes ==

===Final devoicing===
Voiced consonants ({{IPA|/b/, /bʲ/, /d/, /dʲ/ /ɡ/, /v/, /vʲ/, /z/, /zʲ/, /ʐ/}}, and {{IPA|/ʑː/}}) are [[Final-obstruent devoicing|devoiced word-finally]] unless the next word begins with a voiced obstruent.{{sfn|Halle|1959|p=22}} {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, in addition to becoming voiceless, also [[lenition|lenites]] to {{IPA|[x]}} in some words, such as {{lang|ru|бог}} {{IPA|[ˈbox]}}.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Voicing===
Russian features general regressive assimilation of voicing and palatalization.{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|p=156}} In longer clusters, this means that multiple consonants may be soft despite their underlyingly (and orthographically) being hard.{{sfn|Lightner|1972|p=377}} The process of voicing assimilation applies across word-boundaries when there is no pause between words.{{sfn|Lightner|1972|p=73}}
Within a morpheme, voicing is not distinctive before obstruents (except for {{IPA|/v/}}, and {{IPA|/vʲ/}} when followed by a vowel or sonorant). The voicing or devoicing is determined by that of the final obstruent in the sequence:{{sfn|Halle|1959|p=31}} {{lang|ru|просьба}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-просьба.ogg|[ˈpro'''zʲb'''ə]}} ('request'), {{lang|ru|водка}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-водка.ogg|[ˈvo'''tk'''ə]|help=no}} ('vodka'). In foreign borrowings, this isn't always the case for {{IPA|/f(ʲ)/}}, as in {{lang|ru|Адольф Гитлер}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-Адольф Гитлер.ogg|[ɐˈdolʲ'''f''' ˈɡʲitlʲɪr]|help=no}} ('Adolf Hitler') and {{lang|ru|граф болеет}} ('the count is ill'). {{IPA|/v/}} and {{IPA|/vʲ/}} are unusual in that they seem transparent to voicing assimilation; in the syllable onset, both voiced and voiceless consonants may appear before {{IPA|/v(ʲ)/}}:
*{{lang|ru|тварь}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-тварь.ogg|['''t'''varʲ]|help=no}}) ('the creature')
*{{lang|ru|два}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-два.ogg|['''d'''va]|help=no}} ('two')
*{{lang|ru|световой}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-световой (2 vers).ogg|['''s(ʲ)'''vʲɪtɐˈvoj]|help=no}} ('of light')
*{{lang|ru|звезда}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-звезда.ogg|['''z(ʲ)'''vʲɪˈzda]|help=no}} ('star')

When {{IPA|/v(ʲ)/}} precedes and follows obstruents, the voicing of the cluster is governed by that of the final segment (per the rule above) so that voiceless obstruents that precede {{IPA|/v(ʲ)/}} are voiced if {{IPA|/v(ʲ)/}} is followed by a voiced obstruent (e.g. {{lang|ru|к вдове}} {{IPA|['''ɡ'''vdɐˈvʲɛ]}} 'to the widow') while a voiceless obstruent will devoice all segments (e.g. {{lang|ru|без впуска}} {{IPA|[bʲɪs ˈfpuskə]}} 'without an admission').{{sfn|Lightner|1972|p=75}}

{{IPA|/t͡ɕ/}}, {{IPA|/t͡s/}}, and {{IPA|/x/}} have voiced allophones ({{IPAblink|d͡ʑ}}, {{IPAblink|d̪͡z̪|d͡z}} and {{IPAblink|ɣ}}) before voiced obstruents,{{sfn|Halle|1959|p=22}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chew|2003|p=67 and 103}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in {{lang|ru|дочь бы}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-дочь_бы.ogg|[ˈdod͡ʑ bɨ]|help=no}}{{sfn|Lightner|1972|p=82}} ('a daughter would') and {{lang|ru|плацдарм}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-плацдарм.ogg|[pɫɐd͡zˈdarm]|help=no}} ('bridge-head').

Other than {{IPA|/mʲ/}} and {{IPA|/nʲ/}}, nasals and liquids devoice between voiceless consonants or a voiceless consonant and a pause: {{lang|ru|контрфорс}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-контрфорс.ogg|[ˌkontr̥ˈfors]|help=no}}) ('buttress').{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|p=190}}

===Palatalization===
Before {{IPA|/j/}}, paired consonants (that is, those that come in a hard-soft pair) are normally soft as in {{lang|ru|пью}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-пью.ogg|[pʲju]|help=no}}} 'I drink' and {{lang|ru|бью}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-бью.ogg|[bʲju]|help=no}} 'I hit'. However, the last consonant of prefixes and parts of compound words generally remains hard in the standard language: {{lang|ru|отъезд}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-отъезд.ogg|[ɐˈtjest]|help=no}} 'departure', {{lang|ru|Минюст}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-Минюст.ogg|[ˌmʲiˈnjust]|help=no}} 'Min[istry of] Just[ice]'; and only when prefix ends in {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/z/}}, there exists an optional softening: {{lang|ru|съездить}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-съездить.ogg|[ˈs(ʲ)jezʲdʲɪtʲ]|help=no}} ('to travel').

Paired consonants preceding {{IPA|/e/}} are also soft; although there are exceptions from loanwords, alternations across morpheme boundaries are the norm.{{sfn|Padgett|2003a|p=43}} The following examples{{sfn|Lightner|1972|pp=9–11, 12–13}} show some of the morphological alternations between a hard consonant and its soft counterpart:

Velar consonants are soft when preceding {{IPA|/i/}}; within words, this means that velar consonants are never followed by {{IPA|[ɨ]}}.{{sfn|Padgett|2003a|p=39}}

Before hard dental consonants, {{IPA|/r/}}, labial and dental consonants are hard: {{lang|ru|орла}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-орла.ogg|[ɐrˈɫa]|help=no}} ('eagle' [[Genitive case|gen.]] sg).

==== Assimilative palatalization ====
Paired consonants preceding another consonant often inherit softness from it. This phenomenon in literary language has complicated and evolving rules with many exceptions, depending on what these consonants are, in what morphemic position they meet and to what style of speech the word belongs. In old Moscow pronunciation, softening was more widespread and regular; nowadays some cases that were once normative have become low colloquial or archaic. In fact, consonants can be softened to very different extent, become semi-hard or semi-soft.

The more similar the consonants are, the more they tend to soften each other. Also, some consonants tend to be softened less, such as labials and {{IPA|/r/}}.

Softening is stronger inside the word root and between root and suffix; it is weaker between prefix and root and weak or absent between a preposition and the word following.&lt;ref name=Avan&gt;{{cite book|last=Аванесов|first=Р. И.|title=Русское {{lang|ru|литературное}} произношение|year=1984|publisher=Просвещение|location=М.|pages=145–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Before soft dental consonants, {{IPA|/lʲ/}} and often soft labial consonants, dental consonants (other than {{IPA|/t͡s/}}) are soft.
*{{IPA|/x/}} is assimilated to the palatalization of the following velar consonant: {{lang|ru|лёгких}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-лёгких.ogg|[ˈlʲɵxʲkʲɪx]}}) ('lungs' gen. pl.).
* Palatalization assimilation of labial consonants before labial consonants is in free variation with nonassimilation, that is {{lang|ru|бомбить}} ('to bomb') is either {{IPA|[bɐmˈbʲitʲ]}} or {{IPA|[bɐmʲˈbʲitʲ]}} depending on the individual speaker.
* When hard {{IPA|/n/}} precedes its soft equivalent, it is also soft and likely to form a single long sound (see [[gemination]]). This is slightly less common across affix boundaries.

In addition to this, dental fricatives conform to the place of articulation (not just the palatalization) of following postalveolars: {{lang|ru|с частью}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-с частью.ogg|[ˈɕːæsʲtʲju]|help=no}}) ('with a part'). In careful speech, this does not occur across word boundaries.

Russian has the rare feature of nasals not typically being assimilated in place of articulation. Both {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/nʲ/}} appear before retroflex consonants: {{lang|ru|деньжонки}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-деньжонки.ogg|[dʲɪnʲˈʐonkʲɪ]|help=no}}) ('money' (scornful)) and {{lang|ru|ханжой}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-ханжой.ogg|[xɐnˈʐoj]|help=no}}) ('sanctimonious one' instr.). In the same context, other coronal consonants are always hard.

===Consonant clusters===
As a Slavic language, Russian has fewer phonotactic restrictions on consonants than many other languages,{{sfn|Davidson|Roon|2008|p=138}} allowing for clusters that would be difficult for English speakers; this is especially so at the beginning of a syllable, where Russian speakers make no sonority distinctions between fricatives and stops.{{Sfn|Rubach|2000|p=53}} These reduced restrictions begin at the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] level; outside of two morphemes that contain clusters of four consonants: встрет-/встреч- 'meet' ({{IPA|[ˈfstrʲetʲ/ˈfstrʲet͡ɕ]}}), and чёрств-/черств- 'stale' ({{IPA|[ˈt͡ɕɵrstv]}}), native Russian [[morpheme]]s have a maximum consonant cluster size of three:{{sfn|Halle|1959|p=57}}

If {{IPA|/j/}} is considered a consonant in the coda position, then words like {{lang|ru|айва́}} ('quince') contain semivowel+consonant clusters.

Affixation also creates consonant clusters. Some [[prefix]]es, the best known being вз-/вс- ({{IPA|[vz-]/[fs-]}}), produce long word-initial clusters when they attach to a morpheme beginning with consonant(s) (e.g. |{{IPA|fs}}|+  |{{IPA|pɨʂkə}}| → {{lang|ru|вспы́шка}} {{IPA|[ˈfspɨʂkə]}} 'flash'). However, the four-consonant limitation persists in the syllable onset.{{Sfn|Ostapenko|2005|p=143}}{{Sfn|Proctor|2006|p=2, 126}}

Clusters of three or more consonants are frequently simplified, usually through [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] of one of them,{{Sfn|Cubberley|2002|p=80}} especially in casual pronunciation.{{Sfn|Shapiro|1993|p=11}} Various cases of relaxed pronunciation in Russian can be seen [[Relaxed pronunciation#Russian|here]].

All word-initial four-consonant clusters begin with {{IPA|[vz]}} or {{IPA|[fs]}}, followed by a stop (or, in the case of {{IPA|[x]}}, a fricative), and a liquid:

Because [[preposition]]s in Russian act like [[clitic]]s,{{Sfn|Rubach|2000|p=51}} the syntactic phrase composed of a preposition (most notably, the three that consist of just a single consonant: [[wikt:к#preposition|к]], [[wikt:с#preposition|с]], and [[wikt:в#preposition|в]]) and a following word constitutes a [[phonological word]] that acts like a single grammatical word.{{sfn|Bickel|Nichols|2007|p=190}} For example, the phrase {{lang|ru|с друзья́ми}} ('with friends') is pronounced {{IPA|[zdrʊˈzʲjæmʲɪ]}}. In the syllable coda, suffixes that contain no vowels may increase the final consonant cluster of a syllable (e.g. {{lang|ru|Ноя́брьск}} 'city of [[Noyabrsk]]' |{{IPA|noˈjabrʲ}}|+  |{{IPA|sk}}| → {{IPA|[nɐˈjabrʲsk]}}), theoretically up to seven consonants: *{{lang|ru|мо́нстрств}} {{IPA|[ˈmonstrstf]}} ('of monsterships').{{sfn|Toporov|1971|p=155}} There is usually an audible release between these consecutive consonants at word boundaries, the major exception being clusters of [[homorganic consonants]].{{Sfn|Zsiga|2003|p=403}}

Consonant cluster simplification in Russian includes degemination, syncope, dissimilation, and weak vowel insertion. For example, {{IPA|/sɕː/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ɕː]}}, as in {{lang|ru|расще́лина}} ('cleft'). There are also a few isolated patterns of apparent cluster reduction (as evidenced by the mismatch between pronunciation and orthography) arguably the result of historical simplifications.{{Sfn|Cubberley|2002|p=82}} For example, [[dental consonant|dental]] [[stop consonant|stops]] are dropped between a dental continuant and a dental nasal or lateral: {{lang|ru|ле́с'''т'''ный}} {{IPA|[ˈlʲesnɨj]}} 'flattering'.{{Sfn|Halle|1959|p=69}} Other examples include:

The simplifications of consonant clusters are done selectively; bookish-style words and proper nouns are typically pronounced with all consonants even if they fit the pattern. For example, the word {{lang|ru|голла́ндка}} is pronounced in a simplified manner {{IPA|[ɡɐˈɫankə]}} for the meaning of '[[Dutch oven]]' (a popular type of oven in Russia) and in a full form {{IPA|[ɡɐˈɫantkə]}} for 'Dutch woman' (a more exotic meaning).

In certain cases, this syncope produces [[homophone]]s, e.g. {{lang|ru|ко́стный}} ('bony') and {{lang|ru|ко́сный}} ('rigid'), both are pronounced {{Audio-IPA|Ru-костный.ogg|[ˈkosnɨj]|help=no}}.

Another method of dealing with consonant clusters is [[epenthesis|inserting an epenthetic vowel]] (both in spelling and in pronunciation), {{angbr|о}}, after most prepositions and prefixes that normally end in a consonant. This includes both historically motivated usage and cases of its modern extrapolations. There are no strict limits when the epenthetic {{angbr|о}} is obligatory, optional, or prohibited. One of the most typical cases of the epenthetic {{angbr|о}} is between a morpheme-final consonant and a cluster starting with the same or similar consonant (e.g. {{lang|ru|со среды́}} 'from Wednesday' |{{IPA|s}}|+  |{{IPA|srʲɪˈdɨ}}| → {{IPA|[səsrʲɪˈdɨ]}}, not *с среды; {{lang|ru|ототру́}} 'I'll scrub' |{{IPA|ot}}|+  |{{IPA|ˈtru}}| → {{IPA|[ɐtɐˈtru]}}, not *оттру).

=== Supplementary notes ===

There are numerous ways in which Russian spelling does not match pronunciation. The historical transformation of {{IPA|/ɡ/}} into {{IPA|/v/}} in [[genitive]] case endings and the word for 'him' is not reflected in the modern [[Russian orthography]]: the pronoun {{lang|ru|его}} {{IPA|[jɪˈvo]}} 'his/him', and the adjectival declension suffixes -ого and -его. Orthographic г represents {{IPA|/x/}} in a handful of word roots: легк-/лёгк-/легч- 'easy' and мягк-/мягч- 'soft'. There are a handful of words in which consonants which have long since ceased to be pronounced even in careful pronunciation are still spelled, e.g., the 'l' in {{lang|ru|солнце}} {{IPA|[ˈsont͡sə]}} ('sun').

{{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/nʲ/}} are the only consonants that can be geminated within morpheme boundaries. Such gemination does not occur in loanwords.

Between any vowel and {{IPA|/i/}} (excluding instances across affix boundaries but including unstressed vowels that have merged with {{IPA|/i/}}), {{IPA|/j/}} may be dropped: {{lang|ru|аист}} {{IPA|[ˈa.ɪst]}} ('stork') and {{lang|ru|делает}} {{IPA|[ˈdʲɛɫəɪt]}} ('does').{{sfn|Lightner|1972|p=130}} ({{Harvcoltxt|Halle|1959}} cites {{lang|ru|заезжать}} and other instances of intervening prefix and preposition boundaries as exceptions to this tendency.)

Stress in Russian may fall on any syllable and words can contrast based just on stress (e.g. {{lang|ru|мука}} {{IPA|[ˈmukə]}} 'ordeal, pain, anguish' vs. {{IPA|[mʊˈka]}} 'flour, meal, farina'); stress shifts can even occur within an inflexional paradigm: {{lang|ru|до́ма}} {{IPA|[ˈdomə]}} ('house' gen. sg.) vs {{lang|ru|дома́}} {{IPA|[dɐˈma]}} ('houses'). The place of the stress in a word is determined by the interplay between the morphemes it contains, as some morphemes have underlying stress, while others do not. However, other than some compound words, such as {{lang|ru|морозоустойчивый}} {{IPA|[mɐˌrozəʊˈstojtɕɪvɨj]}} ('frost-resistant') only one syllable is stressed in a word.{{sfn|Lightner|1972|p=4}}

{{IPA|/ɨ/}} [[velarization|velarizes]] hard consonants: {{lang|ru|ты}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-ты.ogg|[tˠɨ]}} ('you' sing.). {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} velarize and [[labialisation|labialize]] hard consonants and labialize soft consonants: {{lang|ru|бок}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-бок.ogg|[bˠʷok]|help=no}} ('side'), {{lang|ru|нёс}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-нёс.ogg|[nʲʷɵs]|help=no}} ('(he) carried').{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|pp=79-80}}

Between a hard consonant and {{IPA|/o/}}, a slight {{IPA|[w]}} offglide occurs, most noticeably after labial, labio-dental and velar consonants (e.g. {{lang|ru|мок}}, 'side' {{IPA|[mˠwok]}}).{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|p=79}} Similarly, a weak palatal offglide may occur between certain soft consonants and back vowels (e.g. {{lang|ru|ляжка}} 'thigh' {{IPA|[ˈlʲjaʂkə]}}).{{sfn|Jones|Ward|1969|p=?}}

A '''tall tale''' is a story with unbelievable elements, related as if it were true and factual. Some stories such as these are [[exaggeration]]s of actual events, for example [[wikt:fish story|fish stories]] ("the fish that got away") such as, "That fish was so big, why I tell ya', it nearly sank the boat when I pulled it in!" Other tall tales are completely fictional tales set in a familiar setting, such as the [[Europe]]an [[countryside]], the [[American frontier]], the Canadian Northwest, or the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Things are often told in a way that makes the narrator seem to have been a part of the story, and are good-natured. The line between legends and tall tales is distinguished primarily by age; many legends exaggerate the exploits of their heroes, but in tall tales the exaggeration looms large, to the extent of becoming the whole of the story.

=={{anchor|American tall taIe}}American tall tale==
The tall tale is a fundamental element of [[Folklore of the United States|American folk literature]]. The tall tale's origins are seen in the bragging contests that often occurred when the rough men of the [[American frontier]] gathered. The tales of legendary figures of the Old West, some listed below, owe much to the style of tall tales.

The semi-annual speech contests held by [[Toastmasters International]] public speaking clubs may include a Tall Tales contest. Each and every participating speaker is given three to five minutes to give a short speech of a tall tale nature, and is then judged according to several factors. The winner proceeds to the next level of competition. The contest does not proceed beyond any participating district in the organization to the International level.

The [[comic strip]] ''[[Non Sequitur (comic strip)|Non Sequitur]]'' sometimes features tall tales told by the character Captain Eddie; it is left up to the reader to decide if he is telling the truth, exaggerating a real event, or just telling a [[wikt:whopper|whopper]].

===Examples===
====Historical individuals====
Some stories are told about exaggerated versions of actual historical individuals:
*[[Johnny Appleseed]] &amp;ndash; A friendly folk hero who traveled the [[West]] planting apple trees because he felt his guardian angel told him to
*[[John McNally (American football)|Johnny Blood]] &amp;ndash; An American football player whose reputation for wild behavior was as well known as his on-field play
*[[James Bowie|Jim Bowie]] &amp;ndash; A Kentuckian frontiersman, [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]], and land speculator who fought for the Texan cause in the [[Battle of the Alamo]]. He is known for the [[Bowie knife]] which he used to disembowel his opponent.
*[[Daniel Boone]] &amp;ndash; Blazed a trail across [[Cumberland Gap]] to found the first English-speaking colonies west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]
*Aylett C. "Strap" Buckner &amp;ndash; An [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] fighter of [[History of Texas#Republic of Texas|colonial Texas]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|work = [[Handbook of Texas Online]]
|publisher = [[Texas State Historical Association]]
|accessdate = August 23, 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Davy Crockett]] &amp;ndash; A pioneer and U.S. Congressman from Tennessee who later died at the [[Battle of the Alamo]]
*[[Mike Fink]] &amp;ndash; The toughest boatman on the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers, and a rival of Davy Crockett. Also known as the King of the Mississippi River [[Keelboat]]men
*[[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] &amp;ndash; A mighty steel-driving [[African American]]
*[[Calamity Jane]] &amp;ndash; A tough Wild West woman
*[[Jigger Johnson]] (1871-1935), a [[lumberjack]] and [[log driving|log driver]] from [[Maine]] who is known for his numerous off-the-job exploits, such as catching [[bobcats]] alive with his bare hands, and drunken brawls&lt;ref&gt;''Appalachia'' Appalachian Mountain Club, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monahan, Robert. "Jigger Johnson", ''New Hampshire Profiles magazine'', Northeast Publications, Concord, New Hampshire, April, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Casey Jones]] &amp;ndash; A brave and gritty [[railroad]] engineer
*[[Nat Love]], also known as "Deadwood Dick", was born a slave in Tennessee in 1854. Tales of his adventures after emancipation, as a cowboy and as a Pullman porter, gained such fantastical elements as to be considered tall tales
*[[Sam Patch]] &amp;ndash; An early 19th-century daredevil who died during a jump on Friday the 13th
*[[Molly Pitcher]] &amp;ndash; A heroine of the [[American Revolutionary War]]

====Legendary figures====
[[File:Klamath-CA-Babe.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Paul Bunyan's [[sidekick]], [[Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox|Babe the blue ox]], sculpted as a ten-meter tall roadside tourist attraction]]
Subjects of some American tall tales include legendary figures:
*[[Tony Beaver]] &amp;ndash; A [[West Virginia]] lumberjack and cousin of Paul Bunyan
*[[Pecos Bill]] &amp;ndash; legendary cowboy who "tamed the wild west"
*[[Paul Bunyan]] &amp;ndash; huge lumberjack who eats 50 pancakes in one minute and dug the [[grand canyon]] with his axe
*[[Cordwood Pete]] &amp;ndash; Younger brother to lumberjack Paul Bunyan
*[[Febold Feboldson]] &amp;ndash; A [[Nebraska]] farmer who could fight a drought
*[[Johnny Kaw]], a fictional [[Kansas|Kansan]] whose mythological status itself was in one sense a figment, in that it was created recently, in 1955. Adherents of this assessment deem such stories [[fakelore]]
*[[Joe Magarac]] &amp;ndash; A [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] steelworker made of steel
*[[Alfred Bulltop Stormalong]] &amp;ndash; An immense sailor whose ship was so big it scraped [[the moon]]

==Similar traditions in other cultures==
[[File:Skvader.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[skvader]], an example of a tall tale hunting story.]]
Similar [[storytelling]] traditions are present elsewhere. For instance:

===Australian tall tales===
The Australian frontier (known as the bush or the outback) similarly inspired the types of tall tales that are found in American folklore. The Australian versions typically concern a mythical [[Station (Australian agriculture)|station]] called [[The Speewah]]. The heroes of the Speewah include:
*[[Rodney Ansell]] 
*Big Bill &amp;ndash; The dumbest man on the Speewah who made his living cutting up [[mining]] shafts and selling them for post holes
*[[Crooked Mick]] &amp;ndash; A champion [[Sheep shearer|shearer]] who had colossal strength and quick wit.

Another folk hero in Australian folklore is [[Charlie McKeahnie]], the hero of [[Banjo Paterson]]'s poem "[[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|The Man from Snowy River]]", whose bravery, adaptability, and risk-taking could epitomise the new Australian spirit.

===Canadian tall tales===
The Canadian frontier has also inspired the types of tall tales that are found in American folklore, such as: 
*[[French Canadian]] tales of [[Big Joe Mufferaw]], a giant of a lumberjack and woodsman from the [[Ottawa Valley]], loosely based on real-life lumberjack  [[Joseph Montferrand]]
*Johnny Chinook, a Canadian cowboy and rancher [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] of the Canadian West's [[Alberta]]
*Ti-Jean, a giant 10-year-old French-Canadian lumberjack boy{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
*Sam McGee, the hero of Robert Service's poem "[[The Cremation of Sam McGee]]" (1907)

===European tall tales===
[[File:Giants causeway closeup.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The [[Columnar basalt]] that makes up the Giant's Causeway; in legend, a fine set of [[hexagonal]] stepping stones to Scotland, made by Fionn mac Cumhaill]] 
Some European tall tales include:
*[[Toell the Great]] was one of the great tall tales of Estonia.
*The [[Babin Republic]], in Renaissance Poland (1568) was a satirical society dedicated entirely to mocking people and telling tall tales
*Juho Nätti (1890–1964), known as Nätti-Jussi, was a Finnish lumberjack known for telling tall tales; his stories have also circulated as folk tales and been collected in books.
*''[[The Life of Gargantua and of Pantagruel]]'' (16th Century) by the French writer [[Rabelais]] told the tale of two giants; father and son.
*The many farfetched adventures of the fictional German nobleman [[Baron Munchausen]], some of which may have had a [[folklore]] basis.
*Legends of the Irish mythological hunter-warrior [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]], also known as Finn MacCool, have it that he built the [[Giant's Causeway]] as stepping-stones to Scotland, so as not to get his feet wet, and that he also once scooped up part of Ireland to fling it at a rival, but it missed and landed in the [[Irish Sea]]; the clump became the [[Isle of Man]], the pebble became [[Rockall]], and the void became [[Lough Neagh]].
*A [[brown bear]] coating himself in baking soda to be acceptable to humans as a [[polar bear]], a young boy selling frozen words, and a woman whose voice cuts through a giant tree to release oranges that light the Polar night are all tales told by a [[Pomor]] elder in the Soviet animation film ''[[Laughter and Grief by the White Sea]]'' (1988). 
*The Cumbrian Liars, a United Kingdom association who follow in the [[Seven-league boots|seven-league footsteps]] of Will Ritson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grizedale.org/lying/history/index.htm |title=Cumbrian Liars|website=grizedale.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern-day tall tales==
[[Arlo Guthrie]]'s ''[[Alice's Restaurant (album)|Motorcycle Song]]'' is often accompanied by a tall tale about the origin of the song.

'''"The Evil Eye"''' is a piece of short fiction written by [[Mary Shelley]] and published in ''[[The Keepsake]]'' for 1830. The tale is set in Greece and is about a man known as Dmitri of the Evil Eye. Dmitri's wife was murdered and his daughter abducted many years before the story begins. Dmitri's friend Katusthius Ziani enlists him to help recover his rightful inheritance, and during their journey they abduct a boy whom Dmitri discovers to be his grandson.

== Summary ==
The tale centres on a man known as Dmitri of the Evil Eye, an Arnaoot ([[Albani people|Albanian]]) [[Klepht]] leader who lives in [[Yannina]], Greece. Many years before the story begins, Dmitri's [[Sciote]] wife was murdered and his daughter kidnapped by [[Mainote]] pirates while he is away from home. Dmitri searched for his daughter for three years before giving up hope, gaining a scar across his eyebrow and cheek in a battle with Mainotes. This scar and his grief and anger transformed his features and character such that he is rumoured to possess the power of the [[Evil eye|Evil Eye]]. 

When the story begins, Dmitri's friend and sworn brother, the [[Moreot]] Katusthius Ziani visits Dmitri to ask for help recovering his father's fortune. Katusthius had joined a crew of [[Barbary corsairs]] after they boarded his merchant ship, and after leaving them had wandered through Europe before returning to his father's home in [[Corinth]]. When he returned, he discovered that his father, thinking him dead, had willed his fortune to another son, Cyril. Cyril shared the inheritance, but Katusthius is determined to regain it all, and asks Dmitri to help. 

Katusthius visits Cyril and his wife, Zella, and asks them to accompany him to Naples to see him off on a long journey. While they are away from home, Dmitri kidnaps their three year old son, Constans. Cyril is enraged when he finds out and goes in search of his son. He discovers that Dmitri is the man responsible, and that Katusthius is involved as well. Cyril enlists his father-in-law, Camaraz, a Mainote leader, to help him find Constans, and leaves Zella at home mourning her son and fearing for her husband's life. 

Dmitri becomes attached to and protective of Constans during their travels, but Katusthius plots against the child. One night, while Dmitri is sleeping, Katusthius takes the boy, conceals him in a nearby [[Caloyer]] monastery, and recruits [[Zagori|Sagori]] villagers to ostensibly protect the boy and monastery from Dmitri. Dmitri and his band attack the monastery and retrieve Constans. As they escape through the mountains, they encounter Katusthius and his party, as well as Cyril and Camaraz, who have been tracking the kidnappers. Camaraz declares himself a Mainote and the grandfather of the abducted boy, and Dmitri's feelings of affection for Constans transform instantly to revulsion for Mainotes. He threatens to kill Constans, but before he is able to, Camaraz explains that Constans is not a Mainote, as his mother was a Sciote, kidnapped as a young girl. Dmitri realizes that Constans is the son of his lost daughter, Zella, and returns home with Cyril to be reunited with her and his newfound grandson.

== Publication History ==
"The Evil Eye" was first published in ''The Keepsake'' for 1830, a British [[literary annual]], credited to "The Author of [[Frankenstein]]".&lt;ref name="Reynolds1830"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Reynolds|editor-first=Frederic Mansel|title=The Keepsake: 1830|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_fZLAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=23 January 2018|year=1830|publisher=Bogue|pages=150–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was accompanied by an illustration entitled ''Zella'', which was painted by [[Henry Corbould]] and engraved by [[Charles Heath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Keepsake for 1830|last=|first=|publisher=Hurst, Chance, and Co.|year=1829|isbn=|editor-last=Reynolds|editor-first=Frederic Mansel|location=London|pages=164|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_fZLAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA164}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since appeared in one collection of Shelley's work and of supernatural stories,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?98520|title=Title: The Evil Eye|website=www.isfdb.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is not widely read or studied.

== Themes and Influences ==
"The Evil Eye" is one of several tales Shelley published in ''The Keepsake''. Others include "Ferdinando Eboli" (1829), "[[Transformation (short story)|Transformation]]" (1831), "The Invisible Girl" (1832), "The Dream" (1833), and "[[The Mortal Immortal]]" (1834).  

"The Evil Eye" employs many motifs common in [[Gothic fiction]], including abduction, revenge, and the curse of the [[Evil eye|Evil Eye]]. The tale displays the aesthetics of Romantic [[Orientalism]], and can be categorized as an Oriental tale alongside [[William Beckford (writer)|William Beckford]]'s novel ''[[Vathek]]'' (1786), [[Lord Byron]]'s poems ''[[The Giaour]]'' and ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'' (1812–1818), [[Thomas Hope (1769–1831)|Thomas Hope]]'s ''[[Thomas Hope (1769–1831)#Anastasius|Anastasius]]'' (1819), and [[Prosper Mérimée]]'s ''[[La Guzla]]'' (1827).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collected Tales and Stories, with Original Engravings|last=Shelley|first=Mary|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1976|isbn=0801817064|editor-last=Robinson|editor-first=Charles E.|location=Baltimore; London|pages=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other Gothic tales by Shelley, such as "Transformation" and "[[The Mortal Immortal]]," and her Gothic novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'', "The Evil Eye" does not involve supernatural phenomena. 

The tale may have been inspired by ''[[La Guzla]]'', which Shelley reviewed in 1829.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

"The Evil Eye" is a variation on the Gothic fragment, a form exemplified by [[Anna Letitia Aikin|Anna Letitia Aiken]]'s "Sir Bertrand: A Fragment" (1773). Although it is now categorized as a [[short story]], that form was not named until the 1880s in Britain. It is more accurately classified as a Gothic tale, a story about an experience of the strange or supernatural, often narrated in the first or third person.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Short Story: An Introduction|last=March-Russell|first=Paul|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780748627738|location=Edinburgh|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Web conferencing''' may be used as an [[umbrella term]] for various types of online collaborative services including web seminars ("webinars"), [[webcasts]], and peer-level web meetings. It may also be used in a more narrow sense to refer only to the peer-level web meeting context, in an attempt to disambiguate it from the other types of collaborative sessions.&lt;ref name="Webinar Or Webcast - What's The Difference?"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wsuccess.typepad.com/webinarblog/2007/03/webinar_or_webc.html |title=Webinar Or Webcast - What's The Difference?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terminology related to these technologies is inexact, and no generally agreed upon source or standards organization exists to provide an established usage reference.

In general, web conferencing is made possible by [[Internet]] technologies, particularly on [[TCP/IP]] connections. Services may allow [[real-time text|real-time]] [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] communications as well as [[multicast]] [[communication]]s from one sender to many receivers. It offers data streams of [[text-based]] messages, voice and [[video chat]] to be shared simultaneously, across geographically dispersed locations. Applications for web conferencing include [[meeting]]s, training events, lectures, or [[presentation]]s from a web-connected [[computer]] to other web-connected computers.

==Installation and operation==
Web conferencing software is invoked by all participants in a web meeting. Some technologies include software and functionality that differs for presenters and attendees. Software may run as a web browser application (often relying on [[Adobe Flash]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], or [[WebRTC]] to provide the operational platform). Other web conferencing technologies require download and installation of software on each participant's computer, which is invoked as a local application. Many web conferencing vendors provide the central connectivity and provisioning of meeting "ports" or "seats" as a hosted [[web service]], while others allow the web conference host to install and run the software on its own local servers. Another installation option from certain vendors allows for use of a proprietary [[computer appliance]] that is installed at the hosting company's physical location.

Depending on the technology being used, participants may speak and listen to audio over standard telephone lines or via computer microphones and speakers. Some products allow for use of a [[webcam]] to display participants, while others may require their own proprietary encoding or externally provided encoding of a video feed (for example, from a professional video camera connected via an [[IEEE 1394]] interface) that is displayed in the session.

Vendor-hosted web conferencing is usually licensed as a service based on one of three pricing models: a fixed cost per user per minute, a monthly or annual flat fee allowing unlimited use with a fixed maximum capacity per session, or a sliding rate fee based on the number of allowed meeting hosts and per-session participants (number of "seats").

Presentation of visual materials most often is accomplished through one of two primary methodologies. The web conferencing software may show participants an image of the presenter's computer screen (or desktop). Again, depending upon the product, the software may show the entire visible desktop area or may allow selection of a physical area or application running on the presenter's computer. The second method relies on an upload and conversion process (most commonly consisting of [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] files, other [[Microsoft Office]] electronic documents, or [[Adobe PDF]] documents).

==Etymology==
The term "webinar" is a [[portmanteau]] of [[World Wide Web|web]] and [[seminar]], meaning a presentation, lecture, or workshop that is transmitted over the web. The coined term has been attacked for improper construction,&lt;ref name="Editorial Emergency: Webinar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.editorialemergency.com/component/content/article/386 |title=Editorial Emergency: Webinar}}&lt;/ref&gt; since "inar" is not a valid [[Root (linguistics)|root]]. Webinar was included on the Lake Superior University 2008 List of Banished Words,&lt;ref name="2008 List of Banished Words"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lssu.edu/banished/archive/2008.php |title=2008 List of Banished Words}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was included in the Merriam-Webster dictionary that same year.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster Dictionary: Webinar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/webinar |title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary: Webinar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[webcast]]" derives from its original similarity to a radio or television broadcast. Early usage referred purely to transmission and consumption of streaming audio and video via the [[World Wide Web]]. Over time, webcast software vendors have added many of the same functional capabilities found in webinar software, blurring the distinction between the two terms. Webcasts are now likely to allow audience response to polls, text communication with presenters or other audience members, and other two-way communications that complement the consumption of the streamed audio/video content.

==Features==
Other typical features of a web conference include:&lt;ref&gt;World Web Event Services Markets - N100-64, Frost and Sullivan, page 10, 2006, "The main features within the web event services market"&lt;/ref&gt;

*Slideshow [[presentations]] - where images are presented to the audience and markup tools and a remote mouse pointer are used to engage the audience while the presenter discusses slide content.
*Live or [[Streaming media|streaming]] video - where full motion webcam, digital video camera or [[multi-media]] files are pushed to the audience.
*[[VoIP]] - Real time audio communication through the computer via use of headphones and speakers.
* Web tours - where [[URL]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, data from forms, cookies, scripts and session data can be pushed to other participants enabling them to be pushed through web-based logons, clicks, etc.  This type of feature works well when demonstrating websites where users themselves can also participate.
* Meeting Recording - where presentation activity is recorded on the client side or server side for later viewing and/or distribution.
*[[Whiteboard]] with annotation (allowing the presenter and/or attendees to highlight or mark items on the slide presentation.  Or, simply make notes on a blank whiteboard.)
*[[Text chat]] - For live question and answer sessions, limited to the people connected to the meeting. Text chat may be public (echoed to all participants) or private (between 2 participants).
*Polls and surveys (allows the presenter to conduct questions with multiple choice answers directed to the audience)
*Screen sharing/desktop sharing/application sharing  (where participants can view anything the presenter currently has shown on their screen.  Some screen sharing applications allow for remote desktop control, allowing participants to manipulate the presenters screen, although this is not widely used.)

==Standards==
Web conferencing technologies are not standardized, which has reduced interoperability and transparency and increased platform dependence, security issues, cost and market segmentation. In 2003, the [[IETF]] established a [[working group]] to establish a standard for web conferencing, called "Centralized Conferencing (xcon)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/xcon-charter.html |title=Centralized Conferencing (xcon) |publisher=Ietf.org |date=2014-07-16 |accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The planned deliverables of xcon include:

* A binary [[floor control]] protocol. Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ietfreport.isoc.org/rfc/rfc4582.txt |title=Binary Floor Control Protocol |publisher=Internet Society IETF |date=November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; published as RFC 4582
* A mechanism for membership and authorization control
* A mechanism to manipulate and describe media "mixing" or "topology" for multiple media types (audio, video, text)
* A mechanism for notification of conference related events/changes (for example a floor change)

===Deployment models===

Web conferencing is available with three models: hosting service, software and appliance.

An appliance, unlike the online hosted solution, is offered as hardware. It is also known as "in-house" or "on-premises" web conferencing. It is used to conduct live meetings, remote training, or presentations via the Internet.

==History==
Real-time [[text chat]] facilities such as [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] appeared in the late 1980s. Web-based chat and [[instant messaging]] software appeared in the mid-1990s. The [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO computer learning system]] allowed students to collaborate on networked computers to accomplish learning tasks as early as the 1960s, but the early networking was not accomplished via the [[World Wide Web]] and PLATO's collaborative goals were not consistent with the presenter-audience dynamic typical of web conferencing systems.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Several point-to-point and private-network video conferencing products were introduced in the early 1990s,&lt;ref name="Nefsis: Video Conferencing History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nefsis.com/best-video-conferencing-software/video-conferencing-history.html |title=Nefsis: Video Conferencing History}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably [[CU-SeeMe]], which was used to link selected schools around the United States of America in real-time collaborative communications as part of the Global Schoolhouse project from [[Global SchoolNet]].&lt;ref name="Global SchoolNet History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalschoolnet.org/gsnabout/history/ |title=Global SchoolNet History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Video: Global Schoolhouse in use - 1993"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6uQuj6W3E4 |title=Video: Global Schoolhouse in use - 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1995, [[PictureTel]] announced LiveShare Plus&lt;ref name="PICTURETEL INTRODUCES LIVESHARE PLUS; DATA CONFERENCING SOFTWARE FOR COLLABORATIVE COMPUTING"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/PICTURETEL+INTRODUCES+LIVESHARE+PLUS%3B+DATA+CONFERENCING+SOFTWARE+FOR...-a016903099 |title=PICTURETEL INTRODUCES LIVESHARE PLUS; DATA CONFERENCING SOFTWARE FOR COLLABORATIVE COMPUTING}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a general-use data collaboration product for Windows-based personal computers. The software allowed application sharing, user-granted control of a remote PC, shared whiteboard markup, file transfer, and text messaging. List price was given as $249 per computer. PictureTel referenced an agreement with Microsoft in its announcement press release, and a May 26, 1995 memo from [[Bill Gates]] to Microsoft executive staff and direct reports said "Our PictureTel screen sharing client allowing Window sharing should work easily across the Internet."&lt;ref name="Letters of Note: The Internet Tidal Wave"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2011/07/internet-tidal-wave.html |title=Letters of Note: The Internet Tidal Wave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1996, [[Microsoft]] announced [[NetMeeting]] as an included component in Internet Explorer 3.0.&lt;ref name="Microsoft NetMeeting Conferencing Software Provides Easy Voice, Data Internet Communications; Available on the Web Now"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.microsoft.com/1996/05/29/microsoft-netmeeting-conferencing-software-provides-easy-voice-data-internet-communications-available-on-the-web-now/ |title=Microsoft NetMeeting Conferencing Software Provides Easy Voice, Data Internet Communications; Available on the Web Now}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Microsoft called NetMeeting "the Internet's first real-time communications client that includes support for international conferencing standards and provides true multiuser application-sharing and data-conferencing capabilities."

In 1996, [[PlaceWare]] was founded as a spinoff from [[Xerox PARC]]. In November of that year, PlaceWare Auditorium was described in a public talk at [[Stanford University]] as allowing "one or more people to give an interactive, online, multimedia presentation via the Web to hundreds or thousands of simultaneous attendees; the presentation can include slides (made in PowerPoint or any GIF-image editor), live annotation on the slide images, real-time polls of the audience, live audio from the presenter and those asking questions, private text and audio conversations in the auditorium's "rows", and other features."&lt;ref name="The PlaceWare Platform: Web-based Collaborative Apps Made Simple"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee380/9798fall/lect08.html |title=The PlaceWare Platform: Web-based Collaborative Apps Made Simple}}&lt;/ref&gt; PlaceWare Auditorium was formally announced in March 1997 at a price of $150 per simultaneous user.&lt;ref name="InfoWorld: March 31, 1997"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JDoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=placeware+auditorium+release&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TNz5gWjAbM&amp;sig=w-cQD2EUX7Kfaa43yocigbJVL4M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QWykVP_MGYSeyQTo44KgAw&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=placeware%20auditorium%20release&amp;f=false |title=InfoWorld: March 31, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1998, [[Starlight Networks]]&lt;ref name="Starlight Networks"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/1998/05/13/feat.html |title=Online broadcasting}}&lt;/ref&gt; released StarLive!
