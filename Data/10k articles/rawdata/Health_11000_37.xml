      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3481">'''Abortion in Namibia''' is restricted under the Abortion and Sterilisation Act of South Africa (1975), which [[Namibia]] inherited at the time of Independence from [[South Africa]] in March 1990. The act only allows for the termination of a pregnancy in cases of serious threat to the maternal or fetal health or when the pregnancy is a result of [[rape]] or [[incest]].

== Legal position ==
[[Abortion]]s are allowed only when continuing the pregnancy will "endanger the woman’s life or constitute a serious threat to her physical or mental health or there must be a serious risk that the child to be born will suffer from a physical or mental defect so as to be irreparably seriously handicapped, when the foetus is alleged to have been conceived in consequence of unlawful carnal intercourse (rape or incest); or when the foetus has been conceived in consequence of illegitimate carnal intercourse and the woman is, owing to a permanent mental handicap or defect, unable to comprehend the implications of or bear the parental responsibility for the “fruit of coitus”."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/population/publication/abortion/doc/namibia.doc]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to the woman’s doctor, two other doctors are required to certify the existence of grounds for an abortion, and the operation must be performed by a medical practitioner in a State hospital or an approved medical facility."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110607191917/http://www.namibian.com.na/news-articles/national/full-story/archive/2009/february/article/obama-stance-on-family-planning-praised/ Obama stance on family planning praised] The Namibian, 4 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement at the 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]] in [[Cairo]], then Minister of Health and Social Services [[Nickey Iyambo]] stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;
On the question of abortion, the position of Namibia is that it can only be performed under strict medical supervision within the confines of the laws, which state that consent to abortion can only be given in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in danger. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen it must be clearly understood that Namibia does not promote abortion as a means of family planning but as a public health issue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/popin/icpd/conference/gov/940909181253.html Statement of Namibia, H.E. Dr. N. Iyambo] 8 September 1994, Cairo&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Impact of abortion restrictions ==
The lack of [[Emergency contraception|emergency contraceptive]] use and access to safe legal abortions are contributing factors to the problem of abandonment of newborns, which is acknowledged to be a serious problem in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inamibia.co.na/news/africa/item/9936-namibia-information-on-safe-abortion-should-be-made-easily-accessible.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021180205/http://www.inamibia.co.na/news/africa/item/9936-namibia-information-on-safe-abortion-should-be-made-easily-accessible.html |archivedate=2013-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Hugh Freeland Barbour''' MD LLD [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] FRCPE (1856 - 11 June 1927) was a Scottish gynaecologist and noted medical author. He was President of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] and co-author of the world-acclaimed ''Manual of Gynaecology''.

==Life==
He was born in [[Edinburgh]] the youngest son of George Freeland Barbour of Bonskeid (1810-1887), a Director of the [[North British Railway]], and Margaret Fraser Sandeman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-royal-society-of-edinburgh/article/div-classtitlealexander-hugh-freeland-barbour-ma-md-bsc-lld-frcpe-18561927div/0AD0A42425C8316FC9FC22A25AD9B93F|title=Alexander Hugh Freeland Barbour, M.A., M.D., B.Sc., LL.D., F.R.C.P.E., (1856–1927)|first=J.

He received an MA and BSc in Natural Science before then studying Medicine, all within [[Edinburgh University]]. He graduated MD in 1884 having won a gold medal for his thesis: ''On Spinal Deformity in relation to Obstetrics''.

He was attracted to obstetrics and gynaecology through the influence of Professor Sir Alexander Russell Simpson, his brother-in-law, to whom he became University Assistant. Later he was appointed physician to the Simpson Memorial Maternity Hospital and gynaecologist to the  Royal Infirmary; at the same time he became lecturer on Midwifery and Gynaecology at the Extramural School.

He was President of the Royal College of Physicians in Edinburgh 1914 to 1916.

In later life he is listed as living at 4 [[Charlotte Square]], an elite Edinburgh address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/postofficeedinbu19081909edin|title=Post Office Edinburgh and Leith directory|first=|last=Edinburgh &amp; Leith Post Office Directory Limited|date=7 November 2017|publisher=Edinburgh : Postmaster General|accessdate=7 November 2017|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his retirement, the Universities of Edinburgh and Toronto honoured Dr Freeland Barbour with the degree of LL.D.

He died in Edinburgh and was buried in [[Dean Cemetery]] on the lower (concealed) south terrace.

His sister, Margaret Stewart Barbour, married [[Alexander Russell Simpson]]. Their son was [[George Freeland Barbour Simpson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amici del Mondo World Friends Onlus''' is an independent Italian non-profit association of social utility&lt;ref&gt;According to Italian [[Ministerial decree|Ministerial Decree]] 266/2003, is inscribed on the ONLUS Registry since 12 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Development aid|international cooperation]]World Friends is a Non-Governmental Organization recognized by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Law no. 125 of 2014 updated to July 16, 2016, registered in the register of ONLUS and the Register of Legal Persons D.P.R. 361. Recognized by the Government of [[Kenya]] as a [[Non-governmental organization]] (NGO),&lt;ref&gt;Acknowledgment obtained on 16 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011 obtained the same accreditation at the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. Established in 2001, the association has its head offices in [[Rome]] and has volunteer-based regional offices in [[Piedmont]], [[Liguria]], [[Lombardy]], [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], [[Veneto]], [[Emilia-Romagna]], [[Lazio]], [[Sicily]]. The association’s African office is based in [[Nairobi]].

==Aims and values==
The aim of World Friends is to contribute to the achievement of the principles established in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in all parts of the world, giving priority to fundamental rights for [[health]], housing and [[education]]. World Friends’ actions at present are focused on the African continent and  their final goal is to improve health, social and educational conditions in the most disadvantaged populations. Every action taken responds to actual needs and to a specific request from the local communities, and is undertaken with their full collaboration.

For this reason, the World Friends’ operative centre has taken the decision to live and work in the city of Nairobi in Kenya so as to assimilate better into the social structure of the area and be able to act as spokesman for the local communities.

==History==
World Friends began from an initiative of Gianfranco Morino, a medical doctor with more than 35 years’ experience in Africa. After having collaborated for a number of years on projects  with the Italian Cooperation for Development, in 1991 he took on responsibility with the Programme for Health Prevention and Education in the nomadic area of [[Moyale District|Sololo]], [[Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Kenya]], collaborating with the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UN High Commissioner for Refugees]]. Following work with the [[European Union]] in [[Somalia]], in 1994 he began to work in health prevention and education in the [[shanty towns]] of [[Korogocho]] and [[Mathare]] in Nairobi. In 2002 he then took over the direction of the Department of [[Surgery]] at Mbagathi Hospital, still in the Kenyan capital, being the only European to work in a state-run hospital.

In 2001, together with a group of friends and collaborators, all convinced of the need for an association to be created in Africa itself, Morino established "World Friends - Amici del mondo". The central idea was that of an organization that could properly integrate with the reality of the local population, not being thousands of miles away, and able to carry out projects deriving from the concrete needs of these populations. To respond to that need, World Friends has over the years prioritized the use of local personnel, relying minimally on the services of expatriate personnel.

==Projects==
The objective of all World Friends projects is to promote health, education and social development of the most disadvantaged populations in the south of the world. World Friends is active in Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia, meeting the needs of the local populations and with their full involvement. The ultimate goal remains to encourage self-sufficiency in the communities where the Association works, and it is for this reason that World Friends makes use above all of local personnel for its activities in Africa, contributing to their professional training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.foundationguide.org/foundations-trust/amici-del-mondo-foundation/|title=Amici del Mondo World Friends - Foundation Guide|website=www.foundationguide.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of World Friends approach is the construction of the Ruaraka Uhai Neema Hospital, a multi-functioning health centre opened by World Friends in November 2008 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3qgx9nmBTg Inauguration of R.U. Neema Hospital]. Situated near to the shanty towns of Nairobi the hospital treats more than 10,000 patients per month, thanks to a staff composed of 99% local personnel. The Ruaraka Uhai Neema Hospital dedicated not only to the treatment of the poorest sector of the population but also to the training of local medical personnel. This action will go on further to consolidate the work carried out by World Friends at the Mbagathi Hospital and at the surgeries located in the Nairobi shanty towns. In addition to health assistance, World Friends workers carry out action in the field of health prevention and education, above all to combat the spread of the [[HIV]] virus.
Services offered by the hospital: General clinic and Maternal-Infant Clinic with vaccination services, gynecology and pediatrics; Maternity Department with operating theatre; Diagnostics Centre offering laboratory tests, radiography and echography. Accident &amp; Emergency, minor surgery and day hospital; HIV tests and treatments; Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy; Pharmacy; Ambulance service; Centre for Professional Training; Pediatrics Department.

Since its inception in 2001, the association has focused its plan of action on achieving the eight [[Millennium Development Goals]], approved by the 193 member States of the [[United Nations]] for world development, to be achieved within 2015. Today, the new challenge are the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] to which all countries are called upon to contribute to bringing the world to a global, economic and social sustainability path without distinction Between South and North.
Our new goal is therefore the 2030: World Friends will not only continue to work against poverty in the South of the planet, expanding its collaboration with other communities in Africa and Latin America, but will also bring programs and experience in the suburbs of the North of the World, where injustice, inequality and the lack of rights are increasingly accentuated.

==Context==
World Friends works mainly in the sub-saharian countries of [[Africa]], such as [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Ethiopia]].
The projects of World Friends are mainly focused on populations in the shantytowns in the north - east area of Nairobi (Korogocho, Kariobangi, Babadogo,  Mathare Valley - Eastleigh, Huruma, Kahawa, Soweto).around 700,000 people, half of whom are under 15 years of age.

The beneficiaries of World Friends’ projects come from backgrounds marked by [[poverty]], [[violence]], [[criminality]], [[prostitution]], the precariousness of housing and work, [[pollution]], diseases. The health problems found by the health workers of World Friends are innumerable: [[gastroenteritis]] and severe [[respiratory diseases]], especially in children; a permanent status of [[malnutrition]] and the presence of [[typhoid fever]] and [[malaria]]. Tuberculosis is in [[Tuberculosis#Epidemiology|evident recrudescence]]; the number of children with physical [[disabled|handicaps]] is high. The diagnosis of ailments requiring surgery and the incidence of [[cancer]] – the latter showing a clear increase – is often delayed due to the intrinsic inefficiencies of the [[health systems]] in African countries. The lack of specialist services for diagnosis and treatment accessible to the poor worsens the outcomes of traumas and burns, very frequent among children, often causing permanent disabilities in a context where physical integrity is linked to the survival of the individual. The transmission of [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexual diseases]] is very widespread, AIDS in particular being a [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|very real scourge]].

Regarding trends for the rest of the city and for the country, access to reproductive health services in the Nairobi slums is minimal: only 15% of the health structures present provide basic [[Obstetrics|obstetrical assistance]] and only 35% of the births are assisted by qualified personnel. [[Maternal mortality]] in the shanty towns (590 mothers per 100,000 births in 1998)&lt;ref name=UNPF&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.unfpa.org/exbrd/2004/firstsession/dpfpa-cpd-ken-6.doc|title= Country programme document for Kenya|author= United Nations Population Fund|date= 2003-10-27|accessdate=2009-09-30}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; is higher than in any other region in Kenya. The [[infant mortality]] rate under 5 years of age (1,565 deaths for every 1000 babies, equal to 15.6%)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Negussie Taffa|author2=G.

Lastly, because the incidence off AIDS is decreasing at the National level, in the Nairobi slums adolescents and women are still strongly vulnerable, with 37% of women between 20 and 24 years of age resulting positive to the infection.&lt;ref name=UNPF/&gt;

'''Avram Steuerman-Rodion''', born '''Adolf Steuerman''' or '''Steuermann''' and often referred to as just '''Rodion''' (November 30, 1872 – September 19, 1918), was a [[Romania]]n poet, anthologist, physician and [[Socialism|socialist]] journalist. A member of [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romania's Jewish community]], he was a lifelong militant for [[Jewish emancipation]] and [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]], noted for poems which attack the prevailing [[antisemitism]] of his day. For a while, he was active as a propagandist of ''[[Hovevei Zion]]'' ideas among local Jews.

During the early stages [[World War I]], Rodion was a columnist at ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]'' daily, with articles which criticized Romania's prospects of joining the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]. Steuerman is himself described as a [[Germanophile]], but, upon Romania's entry into the war in 1916, earned distinction on the [[Romania in World War I|local front]]. He committed suicide upon [[demobilization]], following episodes of [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].

Married into the family of Jewish intellectuals [[Moses Schwartzfeld|Moses]] and [[Elias Schwartzfeld]], Steuerman-Rodion was thus related to poet-philosopher [[Benjamin Fondane]], who was his literary pupil. Steuerman himself is often described as an obscure contributor to [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]], but survives in cultural memory for having given a poetic voice to the ideals of Jewish integration.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
A native of [[Iași]] city, the historical capital of [[Moldavia]] region, Steuerman was a graduate of the National High School.&lt;ref name="sp303"&gt;Podoleanu, p.303&lt;/ref&gt; He published his first poem in ''Drapelul'', a Moldavian weekly, and debuted as a polemicist in the satirical journal ''Perdaful''.&lt;ref name="sp303"/&gt; A passionate writer and, according to his friend Blumenfeld-Scrutator, "the prototype of journalistic refinement",&lt;ref&gt;Blumenfeld-Scrutator, p.306&lt;/ref&gt; he moved on to establish his own newspaper. Addressed to the Moldavian Jews, it was called ''Răsăritul'' ("The East"), and stood for [[Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Podoleanu, p.303, 305&lt;/ref&gt; Steuerman also contributed to the Iași gazette ''Jurnalul'', an organ of a [[left-wing]] political movement spearheaded by [[George Panu]]. Known under the pen name ''As.'', he was a noted proponent of socialist literature and [[didacticism]] in art, following the theories of socialist thinker [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]].&lt;ref name="vdpierre"&gt;{{ro icon}} Victor Durnea, [http://revistacultura.ro/nou/2011/02/enigmaticul-i-saint-pierre/ "Enigmaticul I. Saint Pierre"], in ''Cultura'', Nr. 312, February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, Steuerman had his works published in the Moldavian socialist review, ''[[Contemporanul]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu ''et al.'', p.580&lt;/ref&gt; He fought to defend Dobrogeanu-Gherea against dissident socialists, in particular against a pseudonymous critic, ''I. Saint Pierre''. In November 1894, he and [[Anton Bacalbașa]] of ''[[Adevărul]]'' daily were each proposing ways to uncover Saint Pierre's real identity, and debating each other on the actual nature of Pierre's critique.&lt;ref name="vdpierre"/&gt; By then, Steuerman's own articles were being taken up by ''Adevărul''.&lt;ref&gt;Dafin, Vol. I, p.87; Podoleanu, p.303&lt;/ref&gt; As a correspondent, he was using a regional pen name: ''De la Iași'', later ''A. de la Iași''.&lt;ref&gt;Dafin, Vol. I, p.87; Massoff, p.37; Podoleanu, p.304&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1893, Steuerman had enlisted at the [[University of Iași]] Faculty of Medicine,&lt;ref&gt;Massoff, p.37&lt;/ref&gt; but was still preoccupied with literary studies. The Jewish printing house of [[Lazăr Șaraga]] hosted Steuerman's selection of [[Romanian literature]], ''Autori români'' ("Romanian Authors"). Published in or around 1893, it was divided into two volumes: the Anthology-proper and the [[Chrestomathy]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.555, 978; Massoff, p.37, 57; Podoleanu, p.304&lt;/ref&gt; Steuerman and Șaraga published a second edition in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Cornelia Pillat, [http://www.romlit.ro/voluptatea_lecturii "Voluptatea lecturii"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804110646/http://www.romlit.ro/voluptatea_lecturii |date=2012-08-04 }}, in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 35/1999&lt;/ref&gt; Between these, Steuerman and his editor worked on translations from the work of philosopher [[Vasile Conta]], putting out the ''Theory of Universal Undulation'' in 1894, and the ''Basic Metaphysics'' in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Massoff, p.45-46; Podoleanu, p.305&lt;/ref&gt; The same collaboration brought the posthumous edition of poems by the socialist [[Traian Demetrescu]], published by Șaraga and prefaced by Steuerman,&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu ''et al.'', p.819&lt;/ref&gt; and tales by [[Elisabeth of Wied|Carmen Sylva]], the [[List of Romanian consorts|Queen-consort of Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Massoff, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

In Moldavia, Steuerman made his name writing for the moderate left-wing paper ''[[Evenimentul]]''. Additionally, he worked with the ''Evenimenul'' men Al. Stroja-Flișki and Ioan Dafin on the literary magazine ''Cărticica Săptămânei''.&lt;ref&gt;Dafin, Vol. I, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; Writing years later, Dafin called Rodion "one of [Romania's] most talented journalists". According to Dafin, he wrote with "amazing ease", and was involved on all aspects of creative work.&lt;ref&gt;Dafin, Vol. I, p.87-89&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, Steuerman was studying to become a [[Doctor of Medicine]]: beginning in autumn 1896, he furthered his medical studies in France.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.318; Dafin, Vol. I, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, this departure would have brought a hiatus in his journalistic activity. Steuerman compensated by mailing daily contributions to ''Evenimentul'', and, as Dafin notes, "his absence from Iași was not at all felt by his readers."&lt;ref&gt;Dafin, Vol. I, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, he set up a medical practice in the city.&lt;ref name="lb318"&gt;Boia, p.318&lt;/ref&gt; His thesis, on the treatment of [[skin cancer]], was eventually printed in 1898.&lt;ref name="sp305"&gt;Podoleanu, p.305&lt;/ref&gt;

His writing career was consecrated by several volumes of [[lyrical poetry]]—''Sărăcie'' ("Poverty"), ''Lirice'' ("Lyricals"), ''Spini'' ("Thorns")—, a volume of short stories—''O toamnă la Paris'' ("An Autumn in [[Paris]]")—, a [[libretto]] for an opera about [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Moldavian Prince]] [[Petru Rareș]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr302_303/pagina20.pdf "Calendar. Aniversările și comemorările lunii septembrie"], in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', Nr. 302-303 (1102-1103), September 2008, p.20; [http://www.fcer.jewishfed.ro/public_html/downloads/realitatea/RE324-325.pdf "Calendar. Aniversările și comemorările lunii septembrie"], in ''Realitatea Evreiască'', Nr. 324-325 (1124-1125), September 2009, p.16; Massoff, p.57, 58; Podoleanu, p.304-305&lt;/ref&gt; and several translations. The latter work includes versions of plays or poems by [[Tristan Bernard]], [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Ada Negri]], [[Leo Tolstoy]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;Podoleanu, p.303-304, 305-306&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, Steuerman was a contributor to ''Noutatea'' ("The Novelty"), an independent daily published in Iași by the Jewish poet Berman Goldner-Giordano. This short-lived gazette had a relatively obscure history, and one of its contributors, the maverick socialist [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]] reportedly forgot to mention it in all his later accounts of the period.&lt;ref name="vdpseudo"&gt;{{ro icon}} Victor Durnea, [http://www.romlit.ro/pseudonimele_lui_g._ibrileanu_colaborator_la_noutatea_iai_1897 "Pseudonimele lui G. Ibrăileanu. Colaborator la ''Noutatea'' (Iași, 1897)"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804110624/http://www.romlit.ro/pseudonimele_lui_g._ibrileanu_colaborator_la_noutatea_iai_1897 |date=2012-08-04 }}, in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 11/2008&lt;/ref&gt; Its regular contributors were young supporters of [[left-wing]] ideologies: alongside Steuerman and Giordano, they include poet [[Mihail Codreanu]] and future jurist [[Eugen Heroveanu]].&lt;ref name="vdpseudo"/&gt; With Codreanu, Steuerman (who usually disguised his name under the signatures ''Rodion'', ''Aster'', ''Leander'' and ''Tristis'') took charge of the literary column and the poetry section.&lt;ref name="vdpseudo"/&gt; They were sporadically joined by other writers, among them [[Laura Vampa]], [[Alexandru Toma]], [[I. A. Bassarabescu]], [[George Ranetti]] etc.&lt;ref name="vdpseudo"/&gt;

===Rise to fame===
Steuerman focused on his work in the journalistic genre. In 1901, Goldner's edited a selection of his friend's contributions, as ''Ele'' ("Them").&lt;ref name="sp305"/&gt; Four years later, Dacia publishers issued Rodion's critical essay about the classical Jewish humorist [[Cilibi Moise]].&lt;ref name="sp305"/&gt; At that stage, the Jewish writer was encountering resistance from the antisemitic literary movement in Moldavia. One such incident occurred when, as ''A. Trestianu'', he published his poems in the magazine ''Arhiva, Organul Societății Științifice și Literare''. That collaboration ended abruptly, when [[Gheorghe Ghibănescu]], the editor in chief, discovered that Trestianu was a Jew, and ordered his staff to destroy the physical evidence of Rodion's correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isac Ludo]], ''Despre pseudonim'', Editura Răspântia, Bucharest, 1947, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903,&lt;ref&gt;Zăstroiu, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; Steuerman married Angela, daughter of Iași-based Jewish folklorist Moses Schwartzfeld, and was integrated into the Schwartzfeld family.&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, p.147; Daniel, p.602&lt;/ref&gt; Rodion also became a literary chronicler at ''Ordinea'' ("The Order"), published by the [[Conservative-Democratic Party]], and held a similar position at [[Alexandru Bădărău]]'s ''Opinia'' ("The Opinion"). The latter employed him as its main editor for several years on end: Steuerman wrote three simultaneous columns in ''Opinia'',&lt;ref name="sp303"/&gt; and (Dafin argues) was "the paper's true soul."&lt;ref&gt;Dafin, Vol. II, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; He was perpetually interested in new social and cultural developments, and enthusiastic about the birth of cinema, writing in ''Opinia'' about the coming demise of demise, and probably authoring the [[advertorial]]s about "moving-picture soirées" in Iași.&lt;ref&gt;Zăstroiu, p.23-25&lt;/ref&gt;

During those years, Rodion began a cordial correspondence with [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], the self-exiled Romanian playwright. Himself a noted proponent of Jewish emancipation and Jewish Romanian literature, Caragiale viewed Steuerman as one of his best Jewish friends, a group which also includes Dobrogeanu-Gherea, dramatist [[Ronetti Roman]], journalists [[Barbu Brănișteanu]] and [[Emil Fagure]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Dan Mănucă]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/MANUCAaug3.html "Scrisorile lui Caragiale"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', August 2003&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Steuerman's own publisher Șaraga.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Vasile Iancu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/IANCUnov.html "Înfațișările lui Caragiale în Iașii Junimii"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1907, Caragiale publicly stated his admiration for Steuerman and Ronetti Roman. His words of praise irritated [[Nationalism|nationalist]] historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], who published the antisemitic review ''[[Neamul Românesc]]'': in one of his articles for that magazine, Iorga reported that Caragiale was a sellout to Jewish interests.&lt;ref&gt;Voicu, p.148&lt;/ref&gt; Caragiale indirectly reacted to this accusation in 1908, when he satirized Iorga's scholarly ambitions with a mordant [[epigram]] that was first published in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Voicu, p.148-149&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Rodion was becoming a Romanian expert on the poetry of Heinrich Heine. In 1910, he published a comparative study of Heine and [[Édouard Grenier]]; a year later, the volume ''Complicele lui Heine'' ("Heine's Accomplice").&lt;ref name="sp305"/&gt; His work established Rodion's reputation outside Moldavia: in [[Transylvania]], critic [[Ilarie Chendi]] noted that, with [[Dumitru Karnabatt]] and some others, the "fecund" Steuerman was still maintaining alive the tradition of cultural journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ilarie Chendi]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/luceafarul/1912/BCUCLUJ_FP_280091_1912_011_003.pdf "Vieața literară în 1911 (o privire generală)"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 3/1912, p.61 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; Diversifying his contributions, he published in ''Opinia'' and ''Ordinea'' his introductions to the work of [[Oscar Wilde]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscholars.com/TO/Appendix/Bibliographies/romanian1.htm ''Oscar Wilde: A Romanian Bibliography of Secondary Sources''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107000937/http://www.oscholars.com/TO/Appendix/Bibliographies/romanian1.htm |date=2011-01-07 }}, at [http://www.oscholars.com/ ''The Oscholars'' network]; retrieved February 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Obtaining Caragiale's blessing, he regularly put out [[quatrain]]s with humorous commentary of political affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenfeld-Scrutator, p.307, 309-310&lt;/ref&gt; Rodion also rallied with ''[[Viața Socială]]'', a left-wing paper put out in [[Bucharest]] by the republican agitator [[N. D. Cocea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Angelo Mitchievici]], ''Decadență și decadentism în contextul modernității românești și europene'', [[Editura Curtea Veche]], Bucharest, 2011, p.99.  {{ISBN|978-606-588-133-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Iași, he and Goldner-Giordano were invited to write for a regional newspaper of record, ''[[Gazeta Moldovei]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dafin, Vol. II, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, Steuerman's review of [[French-language]] studies of Romanian literature, from [[Theodor Cornel]] to [[Léo Claretie]], saw print in the newspaper ''Românul'' of [[Arad, Romania|Arad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Rodion, [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/romanul/1912/BCUCLUJ_FP_P2581_1912_002_0223.pdf "Literatura franco-română"], in ''Românul (Arad)'', Nr. 223/1912, p.9 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, again signing ''A. Trestianu'', he returned to ''Arhiva'' with a translation from Carmen Sylva.&lt;ref name="sp304"&gt;Podoleanu, p.304&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite literary recognition, and probably because he was perceived as a foreigner, Steuerman was not invited to join the newly created [[Romanian Writers' Society]] (SSR). He ridiculed the SSR's [[xenophobia]] in a series of articles for ''Ordinea'' and ''Opinia''.&lt;ref&gt;Durnea (2005), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; His comments enlisted negative reactions in Chendi's ''Cumpăna'' magazine, where it was implied that Rodion risked awakening latent antisemitism, but were defended by his more liberal colleagues at ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Durnea (2005), p.25, 27&lt;/ref&gt; At around the same time, Rodion had become a sympathizer of [[Josef B. Brociner]] and his "Society of Romanian [[Israelites]]"—a local branch of ''[[Hovevei Zion]]'' and one of Romania's first [[Jewish political movements|Jewish political associations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr241/pagina10.pdf "Joseph Brociner – un strălucit lider al evreilor români"], in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', Nr. 241 (1041), November–December 2005, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

Steuerman befriended the much younger Benjamin Fondane (born ''Benjamin Wechsler'' in 1898), to whom he was known as ''bădi'' ("uncle") Adolf or Adolphe.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, p.602. See also Crăciun, p.147; Zăstroiu, p.23-24&lt;/ref&gt; Their camaraderie and kinship (Fondane was Moses Schwartzfeld's nephew) doubled as literary training: around 1912, when Fondane was aged 13, Steuerman reviewed his debut verse and encouraged him to continue.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, p.602. See also Zăstroiu, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Rodion also helped introduce his relative to the socialist circles of Iași.&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, p.147&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
During the first stage of [[World War I]], when the [[Kingdom of Romania]] maintained its neutrality, Rodion grew close to the political circles comprising [[Germanophile]]s, neutralist socialists or [[Pacifism|pacifists]]. Like his colleagues there, Rodion was not a keen supporter of making Romania part of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente camp]]; he looked with more sympathy toward the [[German Empire]] and the [[Central Powers]].&lt;ref name="lb318"/&gt; He was allied with [[Panait Zosin]] and [[Sebastian Moruzzi]], two left-wing dissidents from the Conservative-Democratic Party. Rodion contributed to Zosin's press organ, ''Îndrumarea'', which advanced election reform and complete Jewish emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;Dafin, Vol. II, p.101-103, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1915, Avram Steuerman was assigned a regular column in ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]'', a Bucharest newspaper founded by Germanophile agitator [[Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești]] and purchased from him by a German cartel. The ''Seara'' pieces, which he signed as Rodion and collectively titled ''Scrisori din Iași'' ("Letters from Iași"), sought to depict the Moldavian state of affairs in lively colors, with noted stress on the spread of Germanophile sentiment.&lt;ref name="lb318"/&gt; They notably covered the conflicts between the academics of Bucharest and Iași, in particular the largely unsuccessful attempt of [[University of Bucharest]] envoys to attract Iași University staff into a national pro-Entente organization. The project was opposed by the Germanophile group of former socialist [[Constantin Stere]] and rendered ineffectual when Stere's own rival, Rector [[Matei Cantacuzino]], also advised against it.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.120&lt;/ref&gt;

Drafted into the [[Romanian Land Forces]] as a [[Military medicine|military physician]], Rodion saw action throughout the [[Romania in World War I|Romanian Campaign]], retreating with the army into Moldavia after Bucharest fell to the Germans. His activity in the besieged province is said to have been exemplary throughout the period;&lt;ref name="lb318"/&gt; in 1917, Rodion had reached the rank of [[Major]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, p.596&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had discarded socialism, he was denounced as suspect following the leftist demonstration in Iași that was led by [[Max Wexler]]. Reportedly, he was assigned to a secluded army unit on the [[Tazlău River]], while his case was processed. He feared that a death squad would dispose of him, and became an [[insomnia]]c.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenfeld-Scrutator, p.307-308&lt;/ref&gt; He was later stationed in the village of [[Căiuți]], where he read in ''Opinia'' that Fondane's father Isac Wechsler had died. In a letter of condolence he addressed to the Wechslers, Rodion stated: "here [...] death stalks us with every step and makes us love life."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, p.596-597&lt;/ref&gt;

After Romania signed a [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|separate peace]] with the Central Powers, and following the [[demobilization]] of summer 1918, Steuerman returned to Iași. Back into civilian life, Rodion was, like [[George Topîrceanu]], one of the combatants whom the war years had rendered even more critical of the Ententist option; from Moldavia, he sent his texts to be published in Stere's explicitly Germanophile review, ''Lumina'', and, at the same time, began contributing to ''Scena'', the daily owned by [[conscientious objector]] [[A. de Herz]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.105, 318&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lumina'' hosted a second series of his ''Scrisori'', beginning in June 1918.&lt;ref name="lb318"/&gt; During the same month, Rodion was also a correspondent of the short-lived leftist tribune ''Umanitatea'', launched in Iași by the [[Bessarabia]]n Germanophile [[Alexis Nour]], and noted for its advocacy of total Jewish emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.260&lt;/ref&gt; On July 27, ''Opinia'' published Steuerman's eulogistic commentary on the political essays of Stere's follower [[Dimitrie D. Pătrășcanu]]; Pătrășcanu's text, grouped under the headline ''Vinovații'' ("The Guilty Ones"), constituted an indictment of both the Entente and the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]], Romania's main Ententist group.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.267-270, 290, 318&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicide===
Avram Steuerman-Rodion was haunted by memories of the war, and, according to historian [[Lucian Boia]], suffered episodes of [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]] which he both concealed and left untreated.&lt;ref name="lb318"/&gt; He was also addicted to [[hypnotic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenfeld-Scrutator, p.308&lt;/ref&gt; His condition steadily deteriorating, Rodion became suicidal. On September 19, 1918, he died after intentionally overdosing on [[morphine]].&lt;ref name="sp304"/&gt; He left several manuscripts, such as ''Frontul vesel'' ("The Merry Front", a collection of [[sonnet]]s) and ''Însemnări din război'' ("Notes from the War").&lt;ref&gt;Podoleanu, p.304, 305&lt;/ref&gt;

The news of Steuerman's suicide shocked his colleagues and friends in the political-literary community.&lt;ref name="lb318"/&gt; Homages and obituary pieces were printed in various Romanian press venues, including ''Lumina'', ''Scena'' and ''Opinia''—the latter also featured a special commemorative piece by future novelist [[Cezar Petrescu]], ''La mormântul unui confrate'' ("At the Tomb of a Brother in Arms", September 26, 1918).&lt;ref name="lb318"/&gt; A year later, in his columns for ''Scena'' daily and the Zionist paper ''[[Mântuirea]]'', Fondane paid homage to his deceased uncle. These texts linked Rodion's suicide to desperation over the surge of antisemitism, to chronic insomnia, and to [[gerontophobia]].&lt;ref name="zoiudaism"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/iudaismul_n_eseistica_lui_fundoianu "Iudaismul în eseistica lui Fundoianu"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403003413/http://www.romlit.ro/iudaismul_n_eseistica_lui_fundoianu |date=2016-04-03 }}, in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 48/1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary contributions==
According to literary historian [[Zigu Ornea]], Rodion, a "minor poet",&lt;ref name="zoiudaism"/&gt; was one of the young writers and activists instrumental in supporting the Romanian socialist patriarch [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], who was at the time caught in an ideological dispute with the dominant [[Conservatism|conservative]] group ''[[Junimea]]''. The other figures listed by Ornea in this context are Stere, Ibrăileanu, [[Dimitrie Anghel]], [[Anton Bacalbașa]], [[Traian Demetrescu]], [[Emil Fagure]], [[Raicu Ionescu-Rion]], [[Sofia Nădejde]] and [[Henric Sanielevici]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Z. Ornea]], ''Junimea și junimismul'', Vol. II, [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1998, p.357-358. {{ISBN|973-21-0562-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his earlier ''Istoria literaturii române'' synthesis, the influential literary critic [[George Călinescu]] chose to discuss Rodion and Berman Goldner-Giordano together, as two minor representatives of Dobrogeanu-Gherea's "[[Didacticism|tendentious art]]".&lt;ref name="gc555"&gt;Călinescu, p.555&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1894 articles, Steuerman defined himself as an advocate of socialist-themed literature, admonishing his colleague Bacalbașa for having strayed away from this path.&lt;ref name="vdpierre"/&gt;

Steuerman-Rodion left literary works which bridged socialist tendentiousness with his own cultural priority, [[Jewish assimilation]]. One of his poems reflected his dual identity, rendered dichotomous by the spread of [[antisemitism]]:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Voind prin versurile mele,
Cu două neamuri să mă-mpac,
La unul am luat durerea,
La celalt graiul – s-o îmbrac}}&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.555; Podoleanu, p.308&lt;/ref&gt;
|
Wishing, through my verses,
To make my peace with both peoples,
I took from one its sorrow,
From the other the speech – as cover}}

According to Fondane: "Rodion wanted to live. That is a habit people tend to have, and Rodion wanted life, the same as a leaf of grass or the bird of flight. The son of a people with [[Payot|sideburns]] and [[Kittel|robes]], that survives by assimilation with earthworms, with stones, with mankind, with plots of land, his force has bumped [...], like a fly, upon the wall of the world..."&lt;ref name="zoiudaism"/&gt; Fondane noted that Rodion, with his "painfully Romanian style of writing" at a time when Zionism was still "vague", could only opt in favor of erasing his own Jewish identity.&lt;ref name="zoiudaism"/&gt; Steuerman's Romanian [[patriotism]], frustrated by the antisemitic establishment, led him to write what are arguably his most-quoted lyrics:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Tu nu mă vrei, o, țară
Eu, totuși, sunt al tău,
Tu poți să-mi pui hotare,
Să mă-mpovări de rău.}}&lt;ref name="gc555"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msronetti"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Michael Shafir]], [http://www.ideeaeuropeana.ro/download/septembrie_2009_reader.pdf "Un 'desuet' (sau actualitatea lui Ronetti Roman)"] (II), in ''[[Contemporanul]]'', Nr. 9/2009&lt;/ref&gt;
|
You may not want me in, o country,
But, nonetheless, I'm yours,
However you may fence me out
And burden me with wrongs.}}

Rodion's verses were described as particularly eloquent in depicting the misfortune of Jewish intellectuals who sought integration into Romanian society but were still rejected—the piece is called "agonizing" by Zigu Ornea,&lt;ref name="zoiudaism"/&gt; and "immortal" by poet-essayist [[Radu Cosașu]].&lt;ref name="rcjurnalul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Radu Cosașu]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/la-centru-si-la-margine/articol/acum-10-ani-jurnalul "Acum 10 ani, ''Jurnalul''], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 154, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, Romanian and [[Israel]]i academic [[Michael Shafir]] noted that, with similar texts by [[Ronetti Roman]], Steuerman-Rodion's poem mostly reflected the disbelief with which Jewish intellectuals were reacting to the late-19th-century antisemitic barrage. According to Shafir, this reaction was an undignified "lament": "Steuerman-Rodion [...] sounds more like a lover rejected by his woman than a counter-combatant of the socialist persuasion".&lt;ref name="msronetti"/&gt;

Steuerman won more admiration for his prose. Writing in 2010, [[Lucian Boia]] noted that Rodion's ''Scrisori din Iași'' were "a veritable chronicle", "minutely researched and written with talent".&lt;ref name="lb318"/&gt; Boia found the overall Germanophile bias of ''Scrisori'' to be palatable: "the impression they leave is that Iași was sharing in only too little measure the 'Ententist' pathos of Bucharest; an exaggeration of sorts, but also a fair amount of truth."&lt;ref name="lb318"/&gt; An old adversary, [[Nicolae Iorga]], was particularly impressed by Rodion's memoirs from the battlefield. These, Iorga wrote in 1934, are "deeply sincere and truly emotional" notes.&lt;ref&gt;Massoff, p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
According to the overall verdict of George Călinescu, Rodion and Giordano were "insignificant" contributors to [[Romanian literature]], exclusively preoccupied with "the Semitic drama".&lt;ref name="gc555"/&gt; In the same generation, [[Șerban Cioculescu]] reviewed most such socialist poets as "second-rate" and "faint".&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu ''et al.'', p.580, 647&lt;/ref&gt; Such assessments were later issued by Michael Shafir, according to whom Rodion is "(justly) forgotten",&lt;ref name="msronetti"/&gt; and Cosașu, who calls him "obscure".&lt;ref name="rcjurnalul"/&gt;

One to be influenced by Rodion was his own nephew Fondane: according to Ornea, it was Rodion and poet [[Iacob Ashel Groper]] who first got Fondane interested in [[Judaism]] as a distinct literary subject.&lt;ref name="zoiudaism"/&gt; Fondane is also believed to have chosen the title of his column in the Zionist journal ''[[Lumea Evree]]'', ''Idei și oameni'' ("Ideas and People"), as a quote from and homage to Steuerman.&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, p.151&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, the same magazine hosted a [[Philo-Semitism|philosemitic]] essay by Romanian cultural promoter [[Gala Galaction]], which deplored the marginalization or persecution of Jewish writers, from [[Barbu Nemțeanu]] to Rodion.&lt;ref name="gvipostaze"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[George Voicu]], [http://193.226.7.140/~leonardo/n06/Voicu1.htm "Antisemitismul literar românesc: ipostaze istorico-ideologice"], in [http://193.226.7.140/~leonardo/ ''E-Leonardo''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212224825/http://193.226.7.140/~leonardo/ |date=2007-02-12 }}, Nr. 6; retrieved February 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Excluding reprints in the various Romanian magazines, three posthumous selections of Rodion's work were published, as books, after the war: ''Frontul Roșu'' ("The Red Front", sonnets, 1920); ''Cartea Băiatului meu'' ("My Boy's Book", memoirs, 1924); ''Îndepărtări'' ("Detachments", essays, 1936).&lt;ref&gt;Podoleanu, p.304, 305, 390&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodion's political case resurfaced during polemics launched by the Romanian antisemites and the antisemitic [[Fascism|fascists]], down to the end of [[World War II]]. Poet and [[Prime Minister of Romania|Premier]] [[Octavian Goga]] outlined his self-declared hatred for the Jews and call for discriminatory policies in his political tracts, but, unusually in this context, stated that he held no such grudge against either Rodion or Ronetti Roman.&lt;ref name="gvipostaze"/&gt; According to Radu Cosașu, Rodion's failure to integrate announced the similar drama of 1930s Jewish writer [[Mihail Sebastian]], who wanted to be perceived as Romanian but was in return vilified by the [[far right]].&lt;ref name="rcjurnalul"/&gt; In 1941, the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime of [[Ion Antonescu]] published a directory of Jewish Romanian authors, living or deceased, whose work was officially banned: Steuerman was included, under the erroneous spelling ''Steverman''.&lt;ref&gt;Rotman, p.174-175&lt;/ref&gt;

Although negative in substance, the brief profile published in George Călinescu's ''Istoria...'' (first edition 1941), alongside other portraits of Jewish literary men and women, is sometimes referred to as an act of defiance to Antonescu's cultural pronouncements.&lt;ref&gt;Rotman, p.175-177&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of recovering Steuerman's contribution was consciously taken up by Jewish scholar and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Eugen Relgis]], who wrote about him in one of his own literary essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Leon Volovici]], [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr306_307/pagina11.pdf "Prolog la suplimentul 'Eugen Relgis'. Eseurile despre iudaism ale lui Eugen Relgis"], in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', Nr. 306-307 (1106-1107), October–November 2008, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Michelle Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services''''', also known as '''''Cedillo''''',  was a court case involving the family of '''Michelle Cedillo''', an autistic girl whose parents sued the [[United States]] government because they believed that her [[autism]] was caused by her receipt of both the [[MMR vaccine controversy|measles-mumps-and-rubella vaccine]] (also known as the MMR vaccine) and [[thimerosal controversy|thimerosal-containing vaccines]]. The case was a part of the [[Omnibus Autism Proceeding]], where petitioners were required to present three test cases for each proposed mechanism by which vaccines had, according to them, caused their children's autism; ''Cedillo'' was the first such case for the MMR-and-thimerosal hypothesis.

The family sought compensation from the [[National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program]] (NVICP), but in order to qualify they were required to prove that it was more likely than not that their children's autism was caused by their vaccines. The scientific community had concluded that vaccines did not cause autism years before the first cases were heard, and concern was therefore expressed that the relatively lax evidentiary standards of the NVICP could lead to compensation being awarded in spite of the compelling scientific evidence to the contrary. This, some vaccine supporters argued, might have serious adverse public health effects by discouraging vaccine manufacturers from producing more childhood vaccines. Though the NVICP had existed since 1988, it was not designed to handle the thousands of cases it received from 1999 to 2007, which led to the establishment of the Omnibus Autism Proceeding in 2002.

The trial opened on June 11, 2007 in [[Washington, D. C.]]. The Cedillos' six expert witnesses argued that thimerosal-containing vaccines degraded Michelle's immune system, which in turn made it possible for the weakened [[measles virus]] in the MMR vaccine to cause a persistent infection leading to autism. In support of this hypothesis, the Cedillos' witnesses relied on the reported detection of measles virus in Michelle's gastrointestinal tract by John O'Leary's Unigenetics laboratory in [[Dublin]]. However, the government's expert witnesses conclusively demonstrated that O'Leary's positive results were caused by contamination in the Unigenetics lab rather than an actual infection.

On February 12, 2009, the [[special master]]s ruled that the Cedillos were not entitled to compensation as they had failed to demonstrate that thimerosal-containing vaccines in combination with the MMR vaccine could cause autism. The special masters concluded, among other things, that the government's experts were considerably more qualified than those testifying on behalf of the families, with special master George Hastings stating that "the Cedillos have been misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment."

==Background==
{{Main|Vaccine court}}
The [[Vaccine court|National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program]] was established in 1988 in the United States by the passing of the [[National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act]], and is funded by a 75-cent tax on each vaccine dose. The program's aims were to maintain a steady supply of vaccines while, at the same time, allowing victims of [[vaccine injury]] to be compensated more efficiently than was previously possible. The program operates according to a [[No-fault insurance|no-fault]] principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/index.html | title=National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program | publisher=[[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] | work=[[Health Resources and Services Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family of Michelle Cedillo sought compensation from this program. Cedillo, a then 12-year-old female wheelchair user from [[Yuma, Arizona]], was involved in the first of three test cases chosen by the government to represent the approximately 4,900 other vaccine-autism cases that had been brought before the court.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/conditions/03/24/autism.vaccines/ | title=Vaccine-autism question divides parents, scientists | work=[[CNN]] | date=March 2008 | accessdate=29 July 2013 | author=Martin, David S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michelle Cedillo was born on August 30, 1994, and received thimerosal-containing vaccines during the first fifteen months of her life. On December 20, 1995, she received an MMR vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1536580.html | title=Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services | work=[[Findlaw]] | date=27 August 2010 | accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theresa and Michael Cedillo filed a vaccine injury claim on behalf of their daughter on December 9, 1998 for encephalopathy, but on January 14, 2002, changed their petition to a causation-in-fact claim, meaning they were arguing that Michelle developed autism as a result of the combined effects of thimerosal and the MMR vaccine. They did this as a result of a meeting that had taken place the previous year, between Theresa Cedillo and [[Andrew Wakefield]], at a [[Defeat Autism Now!]] conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l_KwCOs3QhsC | title=The Panic Virus | publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | author=Mnookin, Seth | year=2012 | page=291 | isbn=978-1-4391-5865-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, many other families also filed suit in the NVICP, also because they believed their children's autism had been caused by vaccines and they were therefore entitled to compensation. The following year, the Office of Special Masters of the United States Court of Federal Claims held a series of meetings to decide how to deal with these claims, and that July, issued an order establishing the Omnibus Autism Proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/omnibusautism.html | title=About the Omnibus Autism Proceeding | work=Health Resources and Services Administration | date=19 August 2010 | accessdate=11 March 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209235500/http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/omnibusautism.html | archivedate=9 February 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Cedillos, Michelle was developmentally normal until she received her MMR vaccine at the age of 15 months, at which point she developed a 105-degree fever, began vomiting and developed diarrhea. Michelle was diagnosed with autism 18 months after receiving her MMR vaccine.&lt;ref name=moreland/&gt; According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the legal standard to which the cases were subjected in this trial meant that "the outcome will hinge not on scientific standards of evidence but on a legal standard of plausibility&amp;mdash;what one lawyer for the families called '50 percent and a feather'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/09/AR2007060901344.html | title=Fight over Vaccine-Autism Link Hits Court | work=[[Washington Post]] | date=10 June 2007 | accessdate=29 July 2013 | author=Vedantam, Shankar}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in 2002 that, given the large number of litigants seeking compensation from the NVICP, the Omnibus Autism Proceeding was established. Its aim was to resolve pending vaccine-autism claims "aggressively but fairly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1673&amp;context=lcp | title=Immunizing Against Bad Science: The Vaccine Court and the Autism Test Cases | author=Haertlein, Lauren L. | journal=[[Law and Contemporary Problems]] | year=2012 | volume=75 | issue=211 | pages=211–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Prior to the Cedillo case beginning, the scientific community had conducted considerable research into the hypothesized link between either the MMR vaccine and autism or thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. This research had consistently come to the conclusion that no such link existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/mmr_prog_summary.shtml | title=Does the MMR Jab Cause Autism? | work=[[BBC]] | date=29 May 2005 | accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/vaccine-autism-link-case-goes-to-court/ | title=Vaccine-Autism Link Case Goes To Court | work=[[CBS News]] | date=11 June 2007 | accessdate=11 March 2014 | author=Alfano, Sean | quote=Large scientific studies have found no association between autism and vaccines containing thimerosal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some vaccine supporters, such as [[Paul Offit]], argued that the standards for proving a vaccine had "caused" an adverse effect in the NVICP were far too low, and that the court might therefore find in favor of the Cedillos anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/31/opinion/31offit.html | title=Inoculated Against Facts | work=[[New York Times]] | date=31 March 2008 | accessdate=12 March 2014 | author=Offit, Paul | authorlink=Paul Offit}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also argued that if this happened, the vaccine manufacturers might be discouraged from manufacturing childhood vaccines, which might lead to more frequent vaccine shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/jun/14/20070614-085519-8098r/ | title=Science is not a democracy | work=[[The Washington Times]] | date=14 June 2007 | accessdate=12 March 2014 | author=Ross, Gilbert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Cedillo case, her family claimed that Michelle was normal until receiving her vaccines, as evidenced by a number of videos of her between the age of 6 and 8 months. They also argued that thimerosal-containing vaccines degraded her immune system, which made it possible for the measles virus to infect her and cause autism and the other health problems from which she suffers, which include inflammatory bowel disease, glaucoma and epilepsy.&lt;ref name=moreland&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moreland R |title=National vaccine injury compensation program: the potential impact of Cedillo for vaccine-related autism cases |journal=J Leg Med |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=363–80 |year=2008 |pmid=18726760 |doi=10.1080/01947640802297611 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence presented for this consisted primarily of the detection of measles virus in Michelle Cedillo's GI tract. According to the testimony of [[Marcel Kinsbourne]], a pediatric neurologist and professor of psychology at [[the New School]], the vaccine strain of measles virus caused autism by "...&amp;nbsp;infect[ing] the gut and enter[ing] the brain, causing dysfunction of [[astrocyte]]s and other brain cells, which in turn provokes high levels of the neurotransmitter [[glutamate]], causing a state of overstimulation which manifests itself in the symptoms of autism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arthur-allen/the-powerful-case-against_b_53233.html | title=The Powerful Case Against MMR in Autism | work=[[Huffington Post]] | date=21 June 2007 | accessdate=27 September 2013 | author=Allen, Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plaintiff's case===
The witnesses testifying on behalf of the state whose testimony attracted the most attention were [[Éric Fombonne]], a psychiatrist at [[McGill University]], [[Jeffrey Brent]], a medical toxicologist at the [[University of Colorado Health Sciences Center]], and [[Stephen Bustin]] of [[Queen Mary University of London]]. Other experts who testified on behalf of the state included Edwin Cook, a psychiatrist, [[Diane Griffin]], a virologist at [[Johns Hopkins University]], Stephen Hanauer, a gastroenterologist, Christine McCusker, a pediatric immunologist, Brian Ward, a virologist who, along with Fombonne, published some research which failed to replicate the Unigenetics lab's results, and [[Max Wiznitzer]], a pediatric neurologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9RrshCudnIAC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;lpg=PA215&amp;dq=jeffrey+brent+autism | title=Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Reference Handbook | publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |author1=Bernier, Raphael |author2=Gerdts, Jennifer | year=2010 | page=215 | isbn=978-1-59884-334-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who testified on behalf of the plaintiffs were [[H. Vasken Aposhian]], a toxicologist at the [[University of Arizona]], [[Arthur Krigsman]], a gastroenterologist at the [[Johnson Center for Child Health and Development]], Karin Hepner, a molecular biologist at [[Wake Forest University]], [[Vera Byers]], a retired immunologist, [[Ronald C. Kennedy]], a virus immunologist at [[Texas Tech University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arthur-allen/in-autismvaccine-case-rna_b_52408.html|title=In Autism-Vaccine Case, RNA and a Prayer|first=Arthur|last=Allen|date=18 June 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marcel Kinsbourne]], a retired pediatric neurologist.

On June 11, 2007, the plaintiffs presented their first argument, in which they contended that Michelle Cedillo, as well as other children with autism, suffered from a "mercury efflux disorder" which was described by Aposhian, their first expert witness, as "a problem with getting a metal, in this case mercury, out of a cell." As evidence that such disorders have been documented before, he pointed to [[Wilson's disease]].&lt;ref name="Day1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.autism-watch.org/omnibus/theory1/day01.pdf |title=Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services Day One Testimony |date=2007-06-11 |website=[[Autism Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|95}} Aposhian based this claim, in part, on three peer-reviewed papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first such study was co-authored by [[Boyd Haley]], and concluded that hair of children with autism contained less mercury than that of children without autism. Aposhian stated that "we know that the hair is an excretory organ and that the hair is reflective of the mercury or the metal in the blood, and the blood is a reflection of the mercury in the tissues, and so the fact that the children with autism had less mercury in their hair was a hint or indication that perhaps there was mercury efflux disorder."&lt;ref name=Day1/&gt;{{rp|99}} The second of these studies was conducted by [[James B. Adams (professor)|James B. Adams]], and found that baby teeth of children with autism had more than twice as much mercury as those of children without autism. Aposhian cited this study as evidence that "autistic children have a greater body burden of mercury."&lt;ref name=Day1/&gt;{{rp|102}} Another study which Aposhian used to back up this statement was one conducted by [[Jeff Bradstreet]] and [[Mark Geier]], which gave [[dimercaptosuccinic acid]], a chelating agent, to children and concluded that children with autism excreted much more mercury thereafter than children without autism.  Aposhian also cited a number of [[in vitro]] studies as evidence that thimerosal could cause immune system dysregulation.&lt;ref name=Agrawal&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Agrawal | first1 = A. | last2 = Kaushal | first2 = P. | last3 = Agrawal | first3 = S. | last4 = Gollapudi | first4 = S. | last5 = Gupta | first5 = S. | title = Thimerosal induces TH2 responses via influencing cytokine secretion by human dendritic cells | doi = 10.1189/jlb.0706467 | journal = Journal of Leukocyte Biology | volume = 81 | issue = 2 | pages = 474–482 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17079650| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goth&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Goth | first1 = S.

The following day, the plaintiffs presented their second argument, namely that the measles vaccine had caused intestinal damage. Their witness that day was gastroenterologist [[Arthur Krigsman]], who testified that his opinion in the case depended on whether measles virus had really been detected in the intestinal tissue of Michelle Cedillo and other children with autism by the Unigenetics lab, using a study conducted by him, Dr. Hepner, Steve Walker, and Jeff Segal as evidence that the Unigenetics lab's results were reliable. This study, however, was still in its preliminary stages at the time of the trial, and had only been presented as a poster at the [[International Meeting for Autism Research]] the year before,&lt;ref name=Decision/&gt;{{rp|64}} and Walker himself warned that "We haven't done anything to demonstrate that the measles virus is causing autism or even causing bowel disease."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wakehealth.edu/News-Releases/2006/Wake_Forest_Researcher_Warns_Against_Making_Connection_Between_Presence_of_Measles_Virus_and_Autism.htm | title=Wake Forest Researcher Warns Against Making Connection Between Presence of Measles Virus and Autism | publisher=[[Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center]] | year=2006 | accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Measles virus.JPG|thumbnail|right|The plaintiffs also relied on lab testing which had reported that the [[measles virus]], shown, had been detected in Michelle Cedillo's gastrointestinal tract. This argument was refuted by many of the government's witnesses.]]

On the trial's third day, the plaintiffs presented their next argument, which was that the Uhlmann paper, which had reported the presence of vaccine-strain measles virus in the GI tract of children with autism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uhlmann |first1=V |last2=Martin |first2=C M |year=2002 |title=Potential viral pathogenic mechanism for new variant inflammatory bowel disease |journal=Molecular Pathology |volume=55 |issue= 2|pages=84–90 |publisher= |doi=10.1136/mp.55.2.84  |pmc=1187154 |last3=Sheils |first3=O |last4=Pilkington |first4=L |last5=Silva |first5=I |last6=Killalea |first6=A |last7=Murch |first7=SB |last8=Walker-Smith |first8=J |last9=Thomson |first9=M |last10=Wakefield |first10=AJ |last11=O'Leary |first11=JJ |pmid=11950955}}&lt;/ref&gt; used reliable PCR techniques to detect said virus. Their witness for that day was molecular biologist Karin Hepner, who testified that "...&amp;nbsp;the positive and negative controls used by the Uhlmann authors [led by Dr. John J. O'Leary, who runs the Unigenetics lab in Dublin] were appropriate, that the operating procedure employed in the testing was appropriate to minimize the possibility of "contamination," and that the "assays" utilized were appropriately selected and implemented."&lt;ref name=Decision/&gt;{{rp|46}} She also contended that the two studies that had failed to replicate the Uhlmann paper's results were flawed for two reasons: because they looked at cells of children with autism rather than in their GI tract, and because they did not test children with autism with gastrointestinal dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/autism/OmnibusTrialsTranscripts/cedillo/20070613_cedillo_pps576-858.pdf |title=Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services Day Three Testimony |date=2007-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|629A}}

Immunologist [[Vera Byers]] testified that Michelle Cedillo had a [[immune dysregulation|dysregulated immune system]], which allowed the measles virus to persist in her system, and that her malfunctioning immune system was in part a result of the virus itself.&lt;ref name=Decision/&gt;{{rp|32}} She also stated that this dysregulation was caused by "a combination of genetics and the measles virus vaccination and the thimerosal-containing vaccines that she had received."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.autism-watch.org/omnibus/theory1/day04.pdf |title=Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services Day Four Testimony |date=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|872}}

Viral [[immunologist]] [[Ronald C. Kennedy]] testified that Michelle Cedillo had a "selective immune dysfunction". He also, like Dr. Hepner, testified that the Unigenetics lab was reliable and followed appropriate measures to prevent contamination, stating "that the laboratory of Dr. John O'Leary, Dr. Orla Sheils, and their colleagues has a good reputation."&lt;ref name=Decision/&gt;{{rp|47}} Kennedy also testified that he attended a meeting during which Dr. Cotter orally reported that his testing reached results similar to those reported by Uhlmann.&lt;ref name=Decision/&gt;{{rp|56}} However, he also acknowledged that this lab never published sequencing data, which is in line with the fact that the Uhlmann paper does not mention the sequencing process.&lt;ref name=Decision/&gt;{{rp|57}}

Retired pediatric neurologist [[Marcel Kinsbourne]] testified that Michelle was developing normally until December 20, 1995, when she was vaccinated with the [[MMR vaccine]], and that the fever and rash she experienced shortly thereafter was caused by this vaccine. He also testified that Michelle had [[regressive autism]], and that "since Michelle has experienced both chronic gastrointestinal problems and the chronic neurologic disorder known as autism, the most reasonable conclusion is that a single causative agent--i.e., the vaccine-strain measles virus--is the cause of both chronic conditions."&lt;ref name=Decision/&gt;{{rp|86}}

===Opposing arguments===
One of the key lines of evidence presented by the Cedillo family was that Michelle was developmentally normal before she received the MMR vaccine. This, they claimed, was evident from videos taken of her when she was 6 to 8 months old. However, Eric Fombonne testified that Michelle "...&amp;nbsp;displayed early signs of autism clearly visibly on family video taken prior to her receiving the MMR vaccine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/anti-vaccination_movement | title=The Anti-Vaccination Movement | work=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] | date=November–December 2007 | accessdate=6 October 2013 | author=Novella, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thiomersal-from-xtal-3D-vdW.png|thumbnail|left|Thimerosal, a preservative formerly used in vaccines. The plaintiffs claimed that vaccines containing this preservative could cause immune system dysregulation based on a number of in vitro studies, an argument which was refuted by some of the government's witnesses.]]
Jeffrey Brent, the past president of the [[American Academy of Clinical Toxicology]], was invited to testify about the potential role of thimerosal-containing vaccines in triggering Michelle's autism. He stated that "there was not a single study indicating that any form of mercury could cause serious neurological symptoms in the dosages that were used in vaccines" and criticized Aposhian's use of in vitro studies and his equating them to what happens in the actual animal, arguing that "the exposure to a cell in a petri dish was far more likely to cause damage than an equivalent dosage in a living system." With regard to specific in vitro studies, Brent argued that the Goth study&lt;ref name=Goth/&gt; was flawed because it tested thimerosal on mouse cells, not human cells; because these cells were exposed not to ethylmercury, as the human body would be after receiving a thimerosal-containing vaccine since thimerosal is quickly metabolized to ethylmercury, but to thimerosal itself, and because the cells were exposed to far higher concentrations of thimerosal than could ever occur as a result of the administration of thimerosal-containing vaccines. Brent highlighted similar problems with the Agrawal study,&lt;ref name=Agrawal/&gt; noting that the cells in that study, like those in the Goth study, were exposed to thimerosal, not ethylmercury, and to much higher doses than found in vaccines.&lt;ref name=Decision/&gt;{{rp|26}} He also examined the Bradstreet and Geier study and the Holmes study, noting that "much better studies from other investigators could not replicate the results of either the Holmes study or the Bradstreet/Geier study," citing two other peer-reviewed papers which had concluded that hair mercury levels were not significantly different between study participants with autism and controls,&lt;ref name=Day10&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/autism/OmnibusTrialsTranscripts/cedillo/20070622_cedillo_pps2278-2495.pdf | title=Day 10 of testimony| accessdate=13 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2354}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kern | first1 = J.

Many of the plaintiff's experts also relied on the reported detection of measles virus RNA in Michelle's intestinal tissue. This claim was based on results from O'Leary's Unigenetics lab, and was examined by Stephen Bustin, a world-renowned expert on [[polymerase chain reaction]] who has authored a number of scientific papers on the subject, as well as a book entitled A-Z of Quantitative PCR. He pointed out that this is based on results from the O'Leary lab, and concluded, based on a 2002 paper by Uhlmann that described their PCR methodology, that this lab contained a lot of contaminating DNA, and that the assays were actually detecting this DNA rather than the RNA which makes up the measles virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/dec/09/medical-research-mmr-vaccine | title=Fading claims of MMR link to autism | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=8 December 2008 | accessdate=8 October 2013 | author=Bustin, Stephen A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bustin pointed out that, among other things, O'Leary's Unigenetics lab which published this study neglected to use controls, and also did not discuss contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Bustin concluded that it was a "scientific certainty" that none of the children's samples analyzed by the Unigenetics lab actually contained the measles virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/top-irish-pathologist-criticised-in-us-court-1.950899 |title=Top Irish pathologist criticised in US court |last=Houston |first=Muiris |date=2007-07-23 |work=The Irish Times |access-date=2018-02-07 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Bustin and Bertus Rima both testified that Cotter was unable to replicate the Unigenetics lab's results, in contrast to Kennedy's claim that they were able to replicate these results.&lt;ref name=Decision/&gt;{{rp|56}}

While Byers had argued that Michelle's immune system was dysregulated, Christine McCusker demonstrated that when compared to values determined by other researchers for children of Michelle's age, her parameters were within the normal ranges.&lt;ref name=Z/&gt;{{rp|2}}]]
Byers' testimony was countered by that of Christine McCusker, who testified that "Dr. Byers had compared the results from several of the tests on Michelle to a set of "normal" values for such tests. The normal values utilized by Dr. Byers, however, were for adults, not children" and that "when she herself instead compared Michelle's results to an age-adjusted set of normal values, Michelle's results fell within the normal ranges,"&lt;ref name=Decision/&gt;{{rp|36}} with McCusker noting in her expert report that the only marker of [[Th2 cell]] activity that was assessed in Michelle's case, namely serum [[Immunoglobulin E]] level, was entirely normal.&lt;ref name=Z&gt;[http://www.autism-watch.org/omnibus/expert_reports/Z_McCusker_Report_98-916.pdf Respondent's Exhibit Z]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} Additionally, Ward's expert report stated that Byers' expert report contained "many statements that appear to be entirely unsubstantiated."&lt;ref name=BB/&gt;{{rp|8}}

Kinsbourne's testimony was countered by that of Ward, who noted that if Kinsbourne were correct and persisting measles virus were causing autism, then it ought to be detectable in the blood, since Kinsbourne himself had stated that MV would travel throughout the body via the bloodstream;&lt;ref name=Decision/&gt;{{rp|62}} he also criticized Kinsbourne's expert report for citing Bradstreet et al.'s case series which had been published in the ''Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bradstreet |first1=JJ |last2=Dahr |first2=JE |year=2004 |title=Detection of Measles Virus Genomic RNA in Cerebrospinal Fluid of Three Children with Regressive Autism: a Report of Three Cases |journal=Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=38–45 |publisher=[[Association of American Physicians and Surgeons]] |doi= |url=http://icdrc.org/documents/bradstreet.pdf |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to this study, Ward said that "the cerebrospinal antibody data from the three ASD children included in this manuscript actually argue powerfully AGAINST a persistent measles infection in the brains of these children."&lt;ref name=BB/&gt;{{rp|6}} Ward also noted that Krigsman had cited research conducted by [[Vijendra K. Singh]] of [[Utah State University]] which had concluded that more than 80% of children with autism had elevated measles antibodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Additionally, Ward noted that this paper made no mention of the potential link between MMR and autism.&lt;ref name=BB/&gt;{{rp|6}}

===Decision===
On February 12, 2009, the three special masters each ruled against the petitioners' causation claims. In his decision, George Hastings noted that, unlike Aposhian, Jeffrey Brent, who testified that there was no evidence that children with autism were uniquely susceptible to mercury exposure, was a medical doctor. Hastings also described Dr. Brent's testimony as "persuasive."&lt;ref name=Decision&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/vaccine_files/Hastings-Cedillo.pdf |title=Decision |last1=Hastings |first1=George|last2= |first2= |date=12 February 2009 |website=[[United States Court of Federal Claims]] website |publisher= |accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}} In addition, with regard to the theory that some children are genetically hypersusceptible to mercury toxicity, Hastings concluded that the "petitioners have failed to demonstrate that this theory has any validity."&lt;ref name=Decision/&gt;{{rp|26}}  According to Hastings' decision, Byers' testimony "was far outweighed by the testimony of Dr. Brent and respondent's other witnesses&amp;nbsp;...";&lt;ref name=Decision/&gt;{{rp|33}} he also concluded that "her insistence that it was acceptable to use adult norms to measure the immune function of infants and young children was, frankly, incredible."&lt;ref name=Offit&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_poH5CczDUC | title=Deadly Choices: How the Anti-Vaccine Movement Threatens Us All | publisher=[[Basic Books]] | author=Offit, Paul | authorlink=Paul Offit | year=2011 | page=100 | isbn=978-0-465-02149-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hastings also wrote that Kennedy made the same mistake that Byers made—namely, comparing the measurements of Michelle's immune system to the parameters for adults,&lt;ref name=Decision/&gt;{{rp|39–40}} and that while Kennedy testified that Cotter's results were evidence of the Unigenetics lab's testing, that "no conclusions can reasonably be drawn" regarding these results, noting that they had not yet been published.&lt;ref name=Decision/&gt;{{rp|56}} After examining Kinsbourne's testimony, Hastings concluded that it contained "...&amp;nbsp;contradictions and inconsistencies&amp;nbsp;... concerning the appropriate time period between MMR vaccination and onset of autism symptoms,"&lt;ref name=Decision/&gt;{{rp|88}} and also noted that Kinsbourne had not included measles virus as a cause of autism in a chart he wrote for a textbook, but had done so in the proceedings.&lt;ref name=Offit/&gt;

Hastings, in his decision, noted that "all of the petitioners' causation theories depend upon the validity of certain testing that purported to find evidence of persisting measles virus in the biological materials of Michelle and a number of other children with autism."&lt;ref name=Decision/&gt;{{rp|41}} However, Hastings concluded that this testing was "not reliable."&lt;ref name=Decision/&gt;{{rp|41}} In his decision, he noted that the authors of the D'Souza paper&lt;ref name=DSouza/&gt; first performed PCR on [[PBMC]]s from children with autism, which resulted in a large proportion of apparently positive results. However, "the D'Souza group&amp;nbsp;... subjected those apparently positive samples to additional testing techniques in order to determine whether the PCR testing using the Uhlmann primers was truly identifying measles virus and only measles virus.&amp;nbsp;... The application of those two techniques revealed that all but nine of the samples that had initially tested positive by the PCR test using the Uhlmann primers were, in fact, not measles virus." With regard to the 9 remaining samples, the D'Souza paper performed sequencing on 7 of those samples. This step "demonstrated that the material, which in the PCR testing had appeared to be measles virus material, was in fact not measles virus material, but human genetic material."&lt;ref name=Decision/&gt;{{rp|45}}

With regard to the Michelle Cedillo case in general, Hastings concluded that "The evidence was overwhelmingly contrary to the petitioners' contentions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.autism-watch.org/omnibus/overview.shtml | title=Omnibus Court Rules against Autism-Vaccine Link | publisher=Quackwatch | work=Autism Watch | date=6 October 2010 | author=Barrett, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that the Cedillo family had been "misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment."&lt;ref name=times/&gt; The Cedillos appealed this case in March 2009, but the court upheld its dismissal thereof in August 2010.&lt;ref name="Chart"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2010/09/01/autism-vaccine-appeal-ruling-disappoints-family/ | title=Autism-vaccine appeal ruling disappoints family | publisher=CNN | work=The Chart | date=1 September 2010 | author=Martin, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
In response to the second rulings in 2010, SafeMinds stated, "The denial of reasonable compensation to families was based on inadequate vaccine safety science and poorly designed and highly controversial epidemiology."&lt;ref name=Szabo/&gt; Similarly, Rebecca Estepp of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety said in a statement, "The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court. Government attorneys defend a government program, using government-funded science, before government judges,"&lt;ref name=Szabo/&gt; and [[Generation Rescue]]'s J.B. Handley argued that "the courts won't concede something that will bring down the vaccination program."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/13/science/la-sci-autism13-2010mar13 | title='Vaccines court' rejects mercury-autism link in 3 test cases | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | agency=13 March 2010 | accessdate=29 September 2013 | author=Maugh, Thomas H. | date=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, vaccine scientists praised the ruling, with Paul Offit stating "the autism theory had 'already had its day in science court and failed to hold up.{{'"}} Additionally, [[Autism Speaks]] said that "the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism. Thus, we strongly encourage parents to vaccinate their children to protect them from serious childhood diseases."&lt;ref name=Szabo&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2010-03-12-autism-vaccines_N.htm|title=Court: Thimerosal in vaccine didn't cause autism|last1=Szabo|first1=Liz|work=USA Today|date=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Department of Health and Human Services]] released a statement saying that "Hopefully, the determination by the special masters will help reassure parents that vaccines do not cause autism."&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/health/13vaccine.html|title=Court Says Vaccine Not to Blame for Autism|date=13 February 2009|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the chairman of the American Medical Association stated that the "recent rulings by the Special Masters of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims provide even more overwhelming evidence that there is no association between vaccines and autism or related disorders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/brain-and-behavior/articles/2009/02/12/court-says-vaccine-not-the-cause-of-autism | title=Court Says Vaccine Not the Cause of Autism | work=[[U.S. News]] | date=12 February 2009 | accessdate=27 September 2013 | author=Gardner, Amanda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ruling, Keelan and Wilson wrote that, in contrast to those who argued that the proceedings gave unnecessary publicity to the scientifically unsupported vaccine-autism hypothesis, "the NVICP was successful in its management of these proceedings and met the intent of the original legislation to protect the integrity of the vaccine supply, maintain public confidence in immunization, and provide those injured with a fair hearing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keelan|first=Jennifer|author2=Wilson, Kumanan|title=Balancing Vaccine Science and National Policy Objectives: Lessons From the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program Omnibus Autism Proceedings|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=November 2011|volume=101|issue=11|pages=2016–2021|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2011.300198|pmid=21940934|pmc=3222385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cock rock''' is a genre of [[rock music]] that emphasises a form of [[male sexuality]]. The style, developed in the later 1960s, came to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s, and it continues into the 21st century.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Auslander uses [[Simon Frith]]'s description of cock rock characteristics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"cock-rock performance means an explicit, crude, 'masterful' expression of sexuality ... Cock-rock performers are aggressive, boastful, constantly drawing audience attention to their prowess and control. Their bodies are on display ... mikes and guitars are phallic symbols (or else caressed like female bodies), the music is loud, rhythmically insistent, built around techniques of arousal and release. Lyrics are assertive and arrogant, but the exact words are less significant than the vocal styles involved, the shrill shouting and screaming."&lt;ref name="Frith, characteristics"&gt;{{cite book

==Use of the term==
The meaning of the term ''cock rock'' has changed over time. It was first mentioned by an anonymous author in the New York-based underground feminist publication ''[[Rat (newspaper)|Rat]]'' in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;T. Cateforis, ''The Rock History Reader'' (CRC Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0-415-97501-8}}, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the male dominated music industry and became a synonym for [[hard rock]], emphasising the aggressive expression of male sexuality, often misogynist lyrics and use of phallic imagery.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shuker, ''Popular Music: the Key Concepts'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2005, 2nd edn., 2005), {{ISBN|0-415-28425-2}}, pp. 130-1.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used by sociologists [[Simon Frith]] and [[Angela McRobbie]] in 1978 to point to the contrast between male dominated sub-culture of cock rock which was "aggressive, dominating and boastful" and the more feminised [[Teen pop|teenybop]] stars of [[pop music]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Leonard, ''Gender in the Music Industry: Rock, Discourse and Girl Power'' (Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing, 2007), {{ISBN|0-7546-3862-6}}, pp. 24-6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Led Zeppelin]] have been described as "the quintessential purveyors of 'cock rock'".&lt;ref name="Instruments of Desire"&gt;S. Waksman, ''Instruments of Desire: the Electric Guitar and the Shaping of Musical Experience'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-674-00547-3}}, pp. 238-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Other formative acts include the [[Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]] and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[The Doors]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Auslander, ''Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music'' (University of Michigan Press, 2006), {{ISBN|0-472-06868-7}}, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Frith described the characteristics of cock rock in a way that could apply to female performers, not just male ones.&lt;ref name="Frith, characteristics"/&gt; In 2004, Auslander used this description of cock-rock characteristics to show that Suzi Quatro (the first female bass player to become a major rock star) is a female cock-rocker.&lt;ref name="I Wanna Be Your Man"/&gt;

Since the 1980s, the term has been sometimes interchangeable with hair metal or [[glam metal]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Klosterman, ''Fargo Rock City: a Heavy Metal Odyssey in Rural Nörth Daköta'' (Simon and Schuster, 2001), {{ISBN|0-7434-0656-7}}, pp. 100-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this genre include: [[Mötley Crüe]], [[Ratt]], [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]], [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]], [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]], [[Pretty Boy Floyd (American band)|Pretty Boy Floyd]], [[Jackyl]], [[L.A. Guns]], and [[Poison (American band)|Poison]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/hair-metal-d2693 "Hair metal"], ''Allmusic'' retrieved 30 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the name, many of these bands had or have large numbers of female fans.&lt;ref&gt;R. Moore, ''Sells Like Teen Spirit: Music, Youth Culture, and Social Crisis'' (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|0-8147-5748-0}}, pp. 109-110.&lt;/ref&gt; The spoof documentary ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' is an acclaimed [[parody]] of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gottlieb and G. Wald, "Smells like teen spirit: riot girls, revolution and independent women in rock", in A. Ross and T. Rose, eds, ''Microphone Fiends: Youth Music &amp; Youth Culture'' (London: Routledge, 1994), {{ISBN|0-415-90908-2}}, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, there was a revival of the genre with the sleaze metal movement in Sweden, with acts including [[Vains of Jenna]].&lt;ref name=AllmusicVainsofJenna&gt;M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59373">'''Common factors theory''', a theory guiding some research in [[clinical psychology]] and [[counseling psychology]], proposes that different approaches and [[evidence-based practice]]s in [[psychotherapy]] and counseling share ''common factors'' that account for much of the effectiveness of a psychological treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Some sources summarizing common factors theory include: {{harvnb|Carr|2008|pp=49–67}}; {{harvnb|Imel|Wampold|2008}}; {{harvnb|McAleavey|Castonguay|2015}}; {{harvnb|Wampold|Imel|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to the view that the effectiveness of psychotherapy and counseling is best explained by specific or unique factors (notably, particular methods or procedures) that are suited to treatment of particular problems.&lt;ref name="ChamblessOllendick2001"&gt;{{harvnb|Chambless|Ollendick|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one review, "it is widely recognized that the debate between common and unique factors in psychotherapy represents a [[false dichotomy]], and these factors must be integrated to maximize effectiveness".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boswell|Sharpless|Greenberg|Heatherington|2014|p=118}}; this conclusion is also found in, for example, {{harvnb|Butler|Strupp|1986}}, {{harvnb|Arkowitz|1995}}, {{harvnb|McAleavey|Castonguay|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, "therapists must engage in specific forms of therapy for common factors to have a medium through which to operate".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carr|2008|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common factors is one route by which psychotherapy researchers have attempted to [[Integrative psychotherapy|integrate psychotherapies]].

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Carlrogers.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Rogers]], author of "The necessary and sufficient conditions of therapeutic personality change" (1957)]] --&gt;
[[Saul Rosenzweig]] started the conversation on common factors in an article published in 1936 that discussed some psychotherapies of his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenzweig|1936}}, {{harvnb|Rosenzweig|1940}}; {{harvnb|Duncan|2002|p=10}}; Lisa Wallner Samstag has argued that Saul Rosenzweig's contribution to common factors theory has often been misunderstood ({{harvnb|Samstag|2002}})&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dollard]] and [[Neal E. Miller]]'s 1950 book ''Personality and Psychotherapy'' emphasized that the psychological principles and social conditions of [[learning]] are the most important common factors.&lt;ref name="DollardMiller1950"&gt;{{harvnb|Dollard|Miller|1950}}; more recently, Warren Tryon has championed learning as a common factor, e.g. {{harvnb|Tryon|Tryon|2011|p=152}}: "Therapists, and the therapeutic approaches that currently divide us, differ only with regard to what is to be learned and how it is to be acquired... This makes learning and memory basic to our science and profession and should motivate us to search for mechanisms that underlie all effective psychological interventions..."&lt;/ref&gt; Sol Garfield (who would later go on to edit many editions of the ''Handbook of Psychotherapy and Behavior Change'' with [[Allen Bergin]]) included a 10-page discussion of common factors in his 1957 textbook ''Introductory Clinical Psychology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garfield|1957}}; {{harvnb|Duncan|2002|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, [[Carl Rogers]] published a paper outlining what he considered to be common factors (which he called "sufficient conditions") of successful therapeutic personality change, emphasizing the [[therapeutic relationship]] factors which would become central to the theory of [[person-centered therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rogers|1957}}; 50 years later, in 2007, a series of 13 articles reviewed Rogers' 1957 article; some of those articles argued that Rogers' "sufficient conditions" are not common factors: {{cite journal |title=Special section: The necessary and sufficient conditions at the half century mark |journal=[[Psychotherapy (journal)|Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training]] |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=239–299 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/pst/44/3/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, [[Jerome Frank (psychiatrist)|Jerome Frank]] published ''Persuasion and Healing'', a book entirely devoted to examining the common factors among psychotherapies and related healing approaches.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Frank|1991}}; the legacy of Frank's work is discussed in {{harvnb|Alarcón|Frank|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank emphasized the importance of (1) the [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectation]] of help (a component of the [[placebo]] effect), (2) the [[therapeutic relationship]], (3) a rationale or conceptual scheme that explains the given symptoms and prescribes a given [[ritual]] or procedure for resolving them, and (4) the active participation of both patient and therapist in carrying out that ritual or procedure.&lt;ref name="Frank1971"&gt;See also {{harvnb|Frank|1971|p=350}}: "A historical overview of Western psychotherapy reveals that the dominant psychotherapeutic approach of an era reflects contemporary cultural attitudes and values, and that the same techniques (e.g., abreaction) reappear under new names. Common to all psychotherapies are (a) an emotionally charged, confiding relationship; (b) a therapeutic rationale accepted by patient and therapist; (c) provision of new information by precept, example and self-discovery; (d) strengthening of the patient's expectation of help; (e) providing the patient with success experiences; and (f) facilitation of emotional arousal. Prevalent forms of disability and their treatment include drug therapy for constitutional vulnerabilities, emotional support for environmental crises, spiritual guidance for existential anxieties, and therapeutic maneuvers to correct faulty perceptual and behavioral habits learned early in life. Only the latter form requires therapists trained in specific psychotherapeutic methods."&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Lester Luborsky]] and colleagues published a literature review of empirical studies of psychotherapy outcomes in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Luborsky|Singer|Luborsky|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea that all psychotherapies are effective became known as the [[Dodo bird verdict]], referring to a scene from ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' quoted by Rosenzweig in his 1936 article; in that scene, after the characters race and everyone wins, the Dodo bird says, "everybody has won, and all must have prizes."&lt;ref&gt;The question of whether all psychotherapies are all roughly equally effective (known as the [[Dodo bird verdict]]) and the question of whether all effective psychotherapies share common factors (known as common factors theory) are two different questions: "Though many authors view outcome equivalence as the main reason to study common factors in psychotherapy, we cheerfully disagree. Regardless of outcome, it is noncontroversial to say that psychotherapies of many origins share several features of process and content, and it follows that better understanding the patterns of these commonalities may be an important part of better understanding the effects of psychotherapies. That is, irrespective of whether some psychotherapies are equivalent to others in symptomatic outcome, understanding what part of clients' improvement is due to factors that are shared by several approaches appears to us to be a conceptually and clinically important question." ({{harvnb|McAleavey|Castonguay|2015|p=294}})&lt;/ref&gt; Luborsky's research was an attempt (and not the first attempt, nor the last one) to disprove [[Hans Eysenck]]'s 1952 study on the [[efficacy]] of psychotherapy; Eysenck found that psychotherapy generally did not seem to lead to improved patient outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eysenck|1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies after 1975 presented more evidence in support of the general efficacy of psychotherapy,&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Smith|Glass|1977}}; {{harvnb|Lipsey|Wilson|1993}}; {{harvnb|Carr|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the question of how common and specific factors could enhance or thwart therapy effectiveness in particular cases continued to fuel theoretical and empirical research over the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the work of some prominent psychotherapy researchers who have explored this question, see: {{harvnb|Castonguay|Muran|Angus|Hayes|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landmark 1982 book ''Converging Themes in Psychotherapy'' gathered a number of chapters by different authors promoting common factors, including an introduction by Marvin R. Goldfried and Wendy Padawer, a [[reprint]] of Rosenzweig's 1936 article, and further chapters (some of them reprints) by [[John Dollard]] and [[Neal E. Miller]], [[Franz Alexander]], [[Jerome Frank (psychiatrist)|Jerome Frank]], [[Arnold Lazarus]], [[Hans Herrman Strupp]], Sol Garfield, John Paul Brady, [[Judd Marmor]], Paul L. Wachtel, [[Abraham Maslow]], Arnold P. Goldstein, [[Anthony Ryle]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldfried|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapter by Goldfried and Padawer distinguished between three levels of intervention in therapy:
#''theories'' of change (therapists' theories about how change occurs);
#''principles'' or strategies of change;
#therapy ''techniques'' (interventions that therapists suppose will be effective).&lt;ref name="GoldfriedPadawer1982"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldfried|1982|pp=3–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldfried and Padawer argued that while therapists may talk about their ''theories'' using very different [[jargon]], there is more commonality among skilled therapists at the (intermediate) level of ''principles'' or strategies. Goldfried and Padawer's emphasis on principles or strategies of change was an important contribution to common factors theory because they clearly showed how principles or strategies can be considered common factors (they are shared by therapists who may espouse different theories of change) and specific factors (they are manifested in particular ways within different approaches) at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McAleavey|Castonguay|2015|p=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, [[James O. Prochaska]] and colleagues, who were developing the [[transtheoretical model]] of change, proposed ten "processes of change" that categorized "multiple techniques, methods, and interventions traditionally associated with disparate theoretical orientations,"&lt;ref name="ProchaskaDiClementeNorcross1992"&gt;{{harvnb|Prochaska|DiClemente|Norcross|1992|p=1107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they stated that their processes of change corresponded to Goldfried and Padawer's level of common principles of change.&lt;ref name="ProchaskaDiClementeNorcross1992"/&gt;

In 1986, David Orlinsky and Kenneth Howard presented their ''generic model of psychotherapy'', which proposed that five process variables are active in any psychotherapy: the therapeutic contract, therapeutic interventions, the therapeutic bond between therapist and patient, the patient's and therapist's states of self-relatedness, and therapeutic realization.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Orlinsky|Howard|1986}}; for a more recent summary see: {{harvnb|Orlinsky|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Lisa Grencavage and [[John C. Norcross]] reviewed accounts of common factors in 50 publications, with 89 common factors in all, from which Grencavage and Norcross selected the 35 most common factors and grouped them into five areas: client characteristics, therapist qualities, change processes, treatment structure, and therapeutic relationship.&lt;ref name="GrencavageNorcross1990"&gt;{{harvnb|Grencavage|Norcross|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, [[Larry E. Beutler]] and colleagues published their ''systematic treatment selection model'', which attempted to integrate common and specific factors into a single model that therapists could use to guide treatment, considering variables of patient dimensions, environments, settings, therapist dimensions, and treatment types.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beutler|Clarkin|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beutler and colleagues would later describe their approach as "identifying common and differential principles of change".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beutler|Moleiro|Talebi|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, [[Michael J. Lambert]] summarized psychotherapy outcome research and grouped the factors of successful therapy into four areas, ordered by [[hypothesized]] percent of change in clients as a function of therapeutic factors: first, ''extratherapeutic change'' (40%), those factors that are qualities of the client or qualities of his or her environment and that aid in recovery regardless of his or her participation in therapy; second, ''common factors'' (30%) that are found in a variety of therapy approaches, such as empathy and the therapeutic relationship; third, ''expectancy'' (15%), the portion of improvement that results from the client's expectation of help or belief in the rationale or effectiveness of therapy; fourth, ''techniques'' (15%), those factors unique to specific therapies and tailored to treatment of specific problems.&lt;ref name="Lambert1992"&gt;{{harvnb|Lambert|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lambert's research later inspired a book on common factors theory in the practice of therapy titled ''The Heart and Soul of Change''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duncan|Hubble|Miller|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, as [[managed care]] in [[mental health]] services became more widespread in the [[United States]], more researchers began to investigate the efficacy of psychotherapy in terms of ''empirically supported treatments'' (ESTs) for particular problems, emphasizing [[randomized controlled trial]]s as the [[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]] of empirical support for a treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wampold|Imel|2015}}, ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the [[American Psychological Association]]'s Division 12 ([[clinical psychology]]) formed a [[task force]] that developed lists of empirically supported treatments for particular problems such as [[agoraphobia]], [[blood-injection-injury type phobia]], [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]], [[panic disorder]], etc.&lt;ref name="ChamblessOllendick2001"/&gt; In 2001, [[Bruce Wampold]] published ''The Great Psychotherapy Debate'', a book that criticized what he considered to be an overemphasis on ESTs for particular problems, and he called for continued research in common factors theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wampold|Imel|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, more research began to be published on common factors in [[couples therapy]] and [[family therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Sprenkle|Blow|2004}}; {{harvnb|Davis|Piercy|2007}}; {{harvnb|Blow|Morrison|Tamaren|Wright|2009}}; {{harvnb|Sprenkle|Davis|Lebow|2009}}; {{harvnb|Lebow|2014}}; {{harvnb|Karam|Blow|Sprenkle|Davis|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a series of ten articles on common factors theory was published in the [[American Psychological Association|APA]] journal ''[[Psychotherapy (journal)|Psychotherapy]]''.&lt;ref name="APA2014"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Special section: Common factors |journal=[[Psychotherapy (journal)|Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training]] |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=476–524 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/pst/51/4/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The articles emphasized the compatibility between ESTs and common factors theory, highlighted the importance of multiple variables in psychotherapy effectiveness, called for more empirical research on common factors (especially client and therapist variables), and argued that individual therapists can do much to improve the quality of therapy by rigorously using feedback measures (during treatment) and outcome measures (after termination of treatment).&lt;ref name="APA2014"/&gt; The article by [[Stefan G. Hofmann]] and [[David H. Barlow]], two prominent researchers in [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], pointed out how their recent shift in emphasis from distinct procedures for different diagnoses to a transdiagnostic approach was increasingly similar to common factors theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hofmann|Barlow|2014|p=511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==
There are many models of common factors in successful psychotherapy process and outcome.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Tschacher|Junghan|Pfammatter|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already in 1990, Grencavage and Norcross identified 89 common factors in a [[literature review]], which showed the diversity of models of common factors.&lt;ref name="GrencavageNorcross1990"/&gt; To be useful for purposes of psychotherapy practice and training, most models reduce the number of common factors to a handful, typically around five. Frank listed six common factors in 1971 and explained their interaction.&lt;ref name="Frank1971"/&gt; Goldfried and Padawer listed five common strategies or principles in 1982: corrective experiences and new behaviors, feedback from the therapist to the client promoting new understanding in the client, expectation that psychotherapy will be helpful, establishment of the desired therapeutic relationship, and ongoing reality testing by the client.&lt;ref name="GoldfriedPadawer1982"/&gt; Grencavage and Norcross grouped common factors into five areas in 1990.&lt;ref name="GrencavageNorcross1990"/&gt; Lambert formulated four groups of therapeutic factors in 1992.&lt;ref name="Lambert1992"/&gt; Joel Weinberger and Cristina Rasco listed five common factors in 2007 and reviewed the empirical support for each factor: the therapeutic relationship, expectations of treatment effectiveness, confronting or facing the problem (exposure), mastery or control experiences, and patients' attributions of successful outcome to internal or external causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberger|Rasco|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terence Tracy and colleagues modified the common factors of Grencavage and Norcross, and used them to develop a [[questionnaire]] which they provided to 16 [[board certified]] psychologists and 5 experienced psychotherapy researchers; then they analyzed the responses and published the results in 2003.&lt;ref name="Tracey2003"&gt;{{harvnb|Tracey|Lichtenberg|Goodyear|Claiborn|2003|pp=406–410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[multidimensional scaling]] analysis represented the results on a [[two-dimensional graph]], with one dimension representing hot processing versus cool processing (roughly, closeness and emotional experience versus technical information and persuasion) and the other dimension representing therapeutic activity. Their [[cluster analysis]] represented the results as three clusters: the first related to bond (roughly, [[therapeutic alliance]]), the second related to information (roughly, the meanings communicated between therapist and client), and the third related to role (roughly, a logical structure so that clients can make sense of the therapy process).&lt;ref name="Tracey2003"/&gt;

In addition to these models that incorporate multiple common factors, a number of theorists have proposed and investigated single common factors, common principles, and common mechanisms of change, such as [[learning]]. In one example, at least three independent groups have converged on the conclusion that a wide variety of different psychotherapies can be integrated via their common ability to trigger the neurobiological mechanism of [[Memory consolidation#Reconsolidation|memory reconsolidation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ecker|Ticic|Hulley|2012}}; {{harvnb|Welling|2012}}; {{harvnb|Lane|Ryan|Nadel|Greenberg|2015}}; for a more hesitant view of the role of memory reconsolidation in psychotherapy see {{harvnb|Alberini|2015}} and the objections in some of the invited comments in {{harvnb|Lane|Ryan|Nadel|Greenberg|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For further examples, see {{section link||Further reading}}, below.

==Empirical research==
While many models of common factors have been proposed, they have not all received the same amount of [[empirical research]]. There is general consensus on the importance of a good [[therapeutic relationship]] in all forms of psychotherapy and counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McAleavey|Castonguay|2015|pp=301–302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of common factors research in 2008 suggested that 30% to 70% of the [[variance]] in therapy outcome was due to common factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Imel|Wampold|2008|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of research in 2014 suggested that 11.5% of variance in therapy outcome was due to the common factor of [[goal]] consensus/[[collaboration]], 9% was due to [[empathy]], 7.5% was due to [[therapeutic alliance]], 6.3% was due to positive regard/affirmation, 5.7% was due to congruence/genuineness, and 5% was due to therapist factors; in contrast, treatment method accounted for roughly 1% of outcome variance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laska|Gurman|Wampold|2014|p=472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan E. Kazdin]] has argued that psychotherapy researchers must not only find statistical evidence that certain factors contribute to successful outcomes; they must also be able to fomulate evidence-based explanations for how and why those factors contribute to successful outcomes, that is, the [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanism]]s through which successful psychotherapy leads to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kazdin|2005}}; {{harvnb|Kazdin|2009}}; similarly, see also {{harvnb|Rosen|Davison|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common factors theory has been dominated by research on psychotherapy process and outcome variables, and there is a need for further work explaining the mechanisms of psychotherapy common factors in terms of emerging theoretical and empirical research in the [[neuroscience]]s and [[social science]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Imel|Wampold|2008|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; just as earlier works such as Dollard and Miller's ''Personality and Psychotherapy''&lt;ref name="DollardMiller1950"/&gt; or Frank's ''Persuasion and Healing''&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt; explained psychotherapy common factors in terms of the sciences of their time.

One frontier for future research on common factors is automated computational analysis of clinical [[big data]].&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Imel|Steyvers|Atkins|2015}}; {{harvnb|Chen|Wojcik|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
There are several criticisms of common factors theory: for example, that common factors theory dismisses the need for specific therapeutic techniques or procedures, that common factors are nothing more than a good [[therapeutic relationship]], and that common factors theory is not scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Imel|Wampold|2008|pp=256–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some common factors theorists have argued that these criticisms are based on a limited knowledge of the common factors literature; a thorough review of the literature shows that a coherent treatment procedure is a crucial medium for the common factors to operate, that most models of common factors define interactions between multiple variables (including but not limited to therapeutic relationship variables), and that some models of common factors provide evidence-based explanations for the [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanism]]s of the proposed common factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Imel|Wampold|2008|pp=258–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dean Tecumseh Jamison''' (born {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1943) is an American [[economist]] and leader in the study of [[global health]]. He is currently Senior Fellow in Global Health Sciences at [[University of California, San Francisco]] and an Emeritus Professor of Global Health at the [[University of Washington in Seattle]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;Dean Jamison. University of Washington, Accessed June 13, 2016 at http://globalhealth.washington.edu/faculty/dean-jamison&lt;/ref&gt; He has published in [[health economics]], global health, [[education economics]], and [[decision theory]].

== Early life ==
Jamison was born in about 1943 and moved often as a child as his father was a pilot in the [[US Air Force]]. As a child he loved mathematics and studied engineering at Stanford University before turning to economics at Harvard. He received his undergraduate and master's degrees from [[Stanford University]] and a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University under [[Kenneth Arrow]].&lt;ref name="lancetbio"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62613-6 |pmid=24315167 |title=Dean Jamison: Putting economics at the heart of global health |journal=The Lancet |volume=382 |issue=9908 |pages=1871 |year=2013 |last1=Lane |first1=Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His sister is renowned psychologist [[Kay Redfield Jamison]], his daughter is the author [[Leslie Jamison]], and his son, Julian Jamison, is also an economist. Also one of his latest kids [[Yue Wu-Jamison]] , which is the youngest of the family.

==Education==

* PhD - Economics, Harvard University, 1970
* MS - Engineering, Stanford University, 1967
* AB - Philosophy, Stanford University, 1966

== Career ==
After graduating, Jamison worked at [[the World Bank]] from 1976 to 1988. His early work at the bank was as an education economist. When [[China]] joined the World Bank in 1978 Jamison was assigned to analyse China's progress in health and nutrition. He then spent time heading up the bank's health work in China. During that time, he also served as director of the [[World Development Report]] Office and was lead author of the "World Development Report 1993: Investing in Health."  Also, at the WHO, he was lead author of the "[[World Health Report]] 1999."&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2001/924154550x.pdf |title=Macroeconomics and Health: Investing in Health for Economic Development |first=Jeffery |last=Sachs |year=2001 |work=Commission on Macroeconomics and Health: World Health Organization |accessdate=May 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first job in academia was as professor of education and public health at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] from 1988 to 2006, at first while on extended leave from the bank.&lt;ref name="lancetbio"/&gt; In the early 2010s, He was a professor of global health at the University of Washington in Seattle and worked as a co-PI at the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] (IHME). &lt;ref&gt;Developing countries devote more funding to health, except many in sub-Saharan Africa. eScienceNews.

He has also held positions at [[Harvard]], [[Harvard School of Public Health]], [[Peking University]] and the [[University of Queensland]].  He has also worked at the [[National Institute of Health]], and the [[World Health Organization]]. In 1994, he was elected to the [[Institute of Medicine]] of the [[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]]. He has been involved in a wide range of professional activities and served as Co-Chair and Study Director of [[the Lancet]] Commission on Investing in Health which published their results in 2013.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

He currently is co-leader of the [[Disease Control Priorities Project]], and was lead author of the ''Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries'', the first edition of which was published in 1993, the second edition, titled ''Global Burden of Disease and Risk Factors'', in 2006.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; The project is currently working on the third edition. In 2013, Jamison and [[Lawrence Summers]] developed the Global Health: 2035 report that considered the economic benefit of mortality reduction using approaches derived from economic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, Lawrence.

The '''Elephant Gate''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: Elefantporten), also referred to as the '''Elephant Tower''' (Danish: Elefanttårnet), is the most famous [[landmark]] of the [[Carlsberg (district)|Carlsberg area]], the original brewery site of the [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg Breweries]], which is now under redevelopment as a new neighbourhood in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. It takes its name from four large granite elephants which flank the gate, standing back to back, carrying a small tower on their backs.

==History==
Completed in 1901, the Elephant Gate was built at the same time as the [[Ny Carlsberg Brewhouse]]. Together with the [[Old Maltery, Carlsberg|original Ny Carlsberg building]] and the [[Dipylon, Carlsberg|Dipylon]], they completed the main Ny Carlsberg complex around a central courtyard.

The new Elephant Gate made the entrance to the brewery from the [[Valby]] side, complementing the Dipylon which marked the entrance coming from the city.

The architect was [[Vilhelm Dahlerup]] who also designed the previous stages but not the new brewhouse which was designed by [[Vilhelm Klein]].

The space above the gate originally served as a [[water tower]] and herb silo.

==Architecture==
Typically of Ny Carlsberg's architecture, as well as of [[Vilhelm Dahlerup]]'s work in general, the Elephant Gate is built to a colourful [[Historicism (art)|Historicist]] design which freely relies on inspiration from different periods and cultures.

===The elephants===
The elephant feature, which was Carl Jacobsen's own idea, was inspired by [[Bernini]]'s [[obelisk]]-carrying elephant on [[Piazza della Minerva]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitcarlsberg.dk/history/Footprints/Valby/Pages/TheElephantTower.aspx Visit Carlsberg]&lt;/ref&gt; The four elephants were created by the sculptor [[Hans Peder Pedersen-Dan]] based on a sketch by Dahlerup.

===The spire===
The upper tower, which has a floor area of only 115 square metres, is built in red, ornamental brick. It has tall, round-arched windows and is topped by a [[copper]]-clad [[onion dome]].

'''Dr. Ernir K. Snorrason''' (born Reykjavík, March 17, 1944, died Reykjavík, National Hospital, April 26, 2012), was a psychiatrist and neuropsychologist, a co-founder of [[DeCODE genetics]] and two pharmaceutical companies, and a novelist and poet.

==Biography==

Ernir was the son of Snorri Jónsson, a merchant, and Björg G. Kristjánsdóttir, a housewife. He grew up in Reykjavik, graduating in psychology in 1971 from the [[University of Strasbourg]]. He received a licence for general medical practice in Iceland in 1988, in Norway in 1993, and license as a specialist in psychiatry in 1994. Ernir worked in Iceland, France and Norway, as a doctor, teacher, and running his own medical practice in the Domus Medica in Iceland.

Ernir founded the development company Taugagreiningar hf; was a co-founder of [[deCODE genetics]] in 1994; and founded the British drug-discovery company Hunter-Fleming in 1999, sitting on its board as director of development. Ernir produced a number of scholarly articles and patents.

Ernir was also an occasional novelist and poet. His last novel, which was partly about the [[2008–11 Icelandic financial crisis]], unusually was published not only after his death but actually on the day of his funeral (May 8, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bók á útfarardegi höfundar |work=[[Morgunblaðið]] |date=May 8, 2012 |url=http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2012/05/08/bok_a_utfarardegi_hofundar/ |accessdate=June 21, 2014 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was keen on horse-breeding.

He was married twice, the first marriage giving him three children; his second marriage two children, one of whom survived him.

==Books==

Alongside a number of scholarly articles, and a few articles on artistic topics, Ernir wrote four books:

===Fiction and poetry===

* ''Bölverkssöngvar'' (Reykjavík: Helgafell, 1976)
* ''Óttar: skáldsaga'' (Reykjavík: Helgafell, 1977)
* ''[[Sýslumaðurinn sem sá álfa]]'' (Reykjavík: Sögur, 2012)

===Scholarship===

* ''Hópaflfræði: hópsálfræði'', collected by Ernir Snorrason (Bifröst: Samvinnuskólinn, 1971)

'''Evidence-based medicine''' ('''EBM''') is an approach to medical practice intended to optimize [[decision-making]] by emphasizing the use of [[evidence]] from well-designed and well-conducted [[research]]. Although all medicine based on [[science]] has some degree of [[empirical evidence|empirical]] support, EBM goes further, classifying evidence by its [[epistemology|epistemologic]] strength and requiring that only the strongest types (coming from [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]], [[systematic review]]s, and [[randomized controlled trial]]s) can yield strong recommendations; weaker types (such as from [[case-control study|case-control studies]]) can yield only weak recommendations. The term was originally used to describe an approach to teaching the practice of medicine and improving decisions by individual physicians about individual patients.&lt;ref name="Guyatt"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evidence-based medicine. A new approach to teaching the practice of medicine |journal=JAMA |volume=268 |issue=17 |pages=2420–25 |date=November 1992 |pmid=1404801 |doi= 10.1001/jama.268.17.2420 |author1= Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/JAMA/9675/jama_268_17_032.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the term rapidly expanded to include a previously described approach that emphasized the use of evidence in the design of guidelines and policies that apply to groups of patients and populations ("evidence-based practice policies").&lt;ref name="Eddy"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eddy DM|title=Practice Policies – Where Do They Come from?|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=1990|volume=263|issue=9|pages=1265, 1269, 1272, 1275|doi=10.1001/jama.263.9.1265 |pmid=2304243 |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?volume=263&amp;page=1265}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has subsequently spread to describe an approach to decision-making that is used at virtually every level of [[health care]] as well as other fields ([[evidence-based practice]]).

Whether applied to medical education, decisions about individuals, guidelines and policies applied to populations, or administration of health services in general, evidence-based medicine advocates that to the greatest extent possible, decisions and policies should be based on evidence, not just the beliefs of practitioners, experts, or administrators. It thus tries to assure that a [[clinician]]'s opinion, which may be limited by knowledge gaps or biases, is supplemented with all available knowledge from the [[scientific literature]] so that [[best practice]] can be determined and applied. It promotes the use of formal, explicit methods to analyze evidence and makes it available to decision makers. It promotes programs to teach the methods to medical students, practitioners, and policy makers.

==Background, history and definition==
In its broadest form, evidence-based medicine is the application of the scientific method into healthcare decision-making. Medicine has a long tradition of both basic and clinical research that dates back at least to [[Avicenna]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brater DC, Daly WJ |title=Clinical pharmacology in the Middle Ages: principles that presage the 21st century |journal=Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. |volume=67 |issue=5 |pages=447–50 See p. 449|date=May 2000 |pmid=10824622 |doi=10.1067/mcp.2000.106465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11058989"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Daly WJ, Brater DC |title=Medieval contributions to the search for truth in clinical medicine |journal=Perspect. Biol. Med. |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=530–40 See p. 536  |year=2000 |pmid=11058989 |doi=10.1353/pbm.2000.0037}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently to [[protestant]] [[reformation]] [[exegetical|exegesis]] of the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Gerber2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gerber A|author2=Lungen M|author3=Lauterbach KW |title=Evidence-based medicine is rooted in Protestant exegesis | year=2005  | publisher = Medical Hypotheses, Penrith, Eng., Eden Press | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | pages = 1034–38 | pmid = 15780507 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2004.12.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early critique of statistical methods in medicine was published in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Poisson, Dulong |author2=Larrey, Double |title=Statistical research on conditions caused by calculi by Doctor Civiale. |journal=Int J Epidemiol |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=1246–49 |year=2001 |doi=10.1093/ije/30.6.1246 |url=http://ije.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/6/1246 |origyear=1835 |pmid=11821317 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050429042527/http://ije.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/6/1246 |archivedate=2005-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, until recently, the process by which research results were incorporated in medical decisions was highly subjective.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  Called "clinical judgment" and "the art of medicine", the traditional approach to making decisions about individual patients depended on having each individual physician determine what research evidence, if any, to consider, and how to merge that evidence with personal beliefs and other factors.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In the case of decisions which applied to groups of patients or populations, the guidelines and policies would usually be developed by committees of experts, but there was no formal process for determining the extent to which research evidence should be considered or how it should be merged with the beliefs of the committee members.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} There was an [[implicit assumption]] that decision makers and policy makers would incorporate evidence in their thinking appropriately, based on their education, experience, and ongoing study of the applicable literature.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Clinical decision making===
Beginning in the late 1960s, several flaws became apparent in the traditional approach to medical decision-making. [[Alvan Feinstein]]'s publication of ''Clinical Judgment'' in 1967 focused attention on the role of clinical reasoning and identified biases that can affect it.&lt;ref name="feinstein"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alvan R. Feinstein|title=Clinical Judgement|date=1967|publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, [[Archie Cochrane]] published ''Effectiveness and Efficiency'', which described the lack of controlled trials supporting many practices that had previously been assumed to be effective.&lt;ref name="cochraneal"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cochrane A.L.| authorlink= Archie Cochrane | title=Effectiveness and Efficiency: Random Reflections on Health Services|date=1972|publisher=Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, [[John Wennberg]] began to document wide variations in how physicians practiced.&lt;ref name="wennberg"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Wennberg J.E. |author2=Gittelsohn A. |title=Small Area Variations in Health Care Delivery|journal=Science|volume=182|issue=4117|pages=1102–08|doi=10.1126/science.182.4117.1102 |year=1973 |pmid=4750608 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=4750608|bibcode=1973Sci...182.1102W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 1980s, [[David M.

&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of the 1980s, a group at [[RAND]] showed that large proportions of procedures performed by physicians were considered inappropriate even by the standards of their own experts.&lt;ref name="chassin"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chassin MR, Kosecoff J, Solomon DH, Brook RH |title=How Coronary Angiography Is Used: Clinical Determinants of Appropriateness|journal=JAMA|volume=258|issue=18|date=1987|pages=2543–47|doi=10.1001/jama.258.18.2543 |pmid=3312657 |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?volume=258&amp;page=2543}}&lt;/ref&gt; These areas of research increased awareness of the weaknesses in medical decision making at the level of both individual patients and populations, and paved the way for the introduction of evidence-based methods.

===Evidence-based===
The term "evidence-based medicine", as it is currently used, has two main tributaries. Chronologically, the first is the insistence on explicit evaluation of evidence of effectiveness when issuing clinical practice guidelines and other population-level policies. The second is the introduction of epidemiological methods into medical education and individual patient-level decision-making.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Evidence-based guidelines and policies===
The term "evidence-based" was first used by David M. Eddy in the course of his work on population-level policies such as clinical practice guidelines and insurance coverage of new technologies. He first began to use the term "evidence-based" in 1987 in workshops and a manual commissioned by the Council of Medical Specialty Societies to teach formal methods for designing clinical practice guidelines. The manual was widely available in unpublished form in the late 1980s and eventually published by the American College of Medicine.&lt;ref name="eddy1992"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Eddy DM|title=A Manual for Assessing Health Practices and Designing Practice Policies |publisher=American College of Physicians|date=1992 |isbn=0943126185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="field"&gt;{{cite book |author=Committee to Advise the Public Health Service on Clinical Practice Guidelines, Institute of Medicine |editor-last=Field |editor-first=M.J. |editor2-last=Lohr |editor2-first=K.N.  |title=Clinical Practice Guidelines: Directions for a New Program |publisher=National Academy of Sciences Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-309-07666-1 |page=32 |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1626&amp;page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy first published the term "evidence-based" in March, 1990 in an article in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' that laid out the principles of evidence-based guidelines and population-level policies, which Eddy described as "explicitly describing the available evidence that pertains to a policy and tying the policy to evidence. Consciously anchoring a policy, not to current practices or the beliefs of experts, but to experimental evidence. The policy must be consistent with and supported by evidence. The pertinent evidence must be identified, described, and analyzed. The policymakers must determine whether the policy is justified by the evidence. A rationale must be written."&lt;ref name="eddy6"/&gt; He discussed "evidence-based" policies in several other papers published in ''JAMA'' in the spring of 1990.&lt;ref name="eddy6"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Eddy DM|title=Practice Policies: Guidelines for Methods|journal=JAMA |volume=263 |issue=13 |date=1990|pages=1839–41|doi=10.1001/jama.263.13.1839 |pmid=2313855 |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?volume=263&amp;page=1839}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eddy7"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eddy DM|title=Guidelines for Policy Statements|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=263 |issue=16 |date=1990 |pages=2239–43 |doi=10.1001/jama.1990.03440160101046 |pmid=2319689 |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?volume=263&amp;page=2239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those papers were part of a series of 28 published in ''JAMA'' between 1990 and 1997 on formal methods for designing population-level guidelines and policies.&lt;ref name="eddy8"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eddy DM|title=Clinical Decision Making: From Theory to Practice. A Collection of Essays|publisher=American Medical Association|date=1996 |isbn=0763701432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical education===
The term "evidence-based medicine" was introduced slightly later, in the context of medical education. This branch of evidence-based medicine has its roots in clinical epidemiology. In the autumn of 1990, [[Gordon Guyatt]] used it in an unpublished description of a program at [[McMaster University]] for prospective or new medical students.&lt;ref name="howick"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeremy H. |last=Howick|title=The Philosophy of Evidence-based Medicine|publisher=Wiley |page=15|isbn= 978-1-4443-4266-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guyatt and others first published the term two years later (1992) to describe a new approach to teaching the practice of medicine.&lt;ref name="Guyatt"/&gt;

In 1996, David Sackett and colleagues clarified the definition of this tributary of evidence-based medicine as "the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. ... [It] means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research."&lt;ref name="sackett2"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sackett DL, Rosenberg WM, Gray JA, Haynes RB, Richardson WS |date=1996|title=Evidence based medicine: what it is and what it isn't| journal=BMJ| volume=312| issue=7023| pages=71–72| doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7023.71| pmid=8555924|pmc=2349778}}&lt;/ref&gt; This branch of evidence-based medicine aims to make individual decision making more structured and objective by better reflecting the evidence from research.&lt;ref name="katz"&gt;{{cite book| last = Katz| first = David L.| title = Clinical Epidemiology &amp; Evidence-Based Medicine: Fundamental Principles of Clinical Reasoning &amp; Research| year = 2001| publisher = SAGE| isbn = 978-0-7619-1939-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grobbee"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Grobbee| first1 = D.E.| last2 = Hoes| first2 = Arno W.| title = Clinical Epidemiology: Principles, Methods, and Applications for Clinical Research| year = 2009| publisher = Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning| isbn = 978-0-7637-5315-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Population-based data are applied to the care of an individual patient,&lt;ref name="doi"&gt;{{cite book| last = Doi| first = S.A.R.| title = Understanding evidence in health care: Using clinical epidemiology| year = 2012| publisher = Palgrave Macmillan| location = South Yarra, VIC, Australia| isbn = 978-1-4202-5669-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; while respecting the fact that practitioners have clinical expertise reflected in effective and efficient diagnosis and thoughtful identification and compassionate use of individual patients' predicaments, rights, and preferences.&lt;ref name=sackett2 /&gt;

This tributary of evidence-based medicine had its foundations in [[clinical epidemiology]], a discipline that teaches health care workers how to apply clinical and epidemiological research studies to their practices. Between 1993 and 2000, the Evidence-based Medicine Working Group at McMaster University published the methods to a broad physician audience in a series of 25 "Users’ Guides to the Medical Literature" in ''JAMA''. In 1995 Rosenberg and Donald defined individual level evidence-based medicine as "the process of finding, appraising, and using contemporaneous research findings as the basis for medical decisions."&lt;ref name="rosenberg2"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rosenberg W, Donald A |title=Evidence-based Medicine: An approach to Clinical Problem Solving| journal=BMJ| volume=310|issue=6987| pages=1122–26|doi=10.1136/bmj.310.6987.1122 |year=1995 |pmid=7742682 |pmc=2549505 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7742682}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Greenhalgh used a definition that emphasized quantitative methods: "the use of mathematical estimates of the risk of benefit and harm, derived from high-quality research on population samples, to inform clinical decision-making in the diagnosis, investigation or management of individual patients."&lt;ref name="greenhalgh1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenhalgh |first=Trisha |authorlink=Trisha Greenhalgh|date=2010|title=How to Read a Paper: The Basics of Evidence-Based Medicine (4th ed.)|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|page= 1|isbn=978-1-4443-9036-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other definitions have been offered for individual level evidence-based medicine, but the one by Sackett and colleagues is the most commonly cited.&lt;ref name=sackett2 /&gt;

The two original definitions{{which|date=June 2017}} highlight important differences in how evidence-based medicine is applied to populations versus individuals. When designing guidelines applied to large groups of people in settings where there is relatively little opportunity for modification by individual physicians, evidence-based policymaking stresses that there should be good evidence to document a test´s or treatment´s effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Eddy1990"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eddy DM|title=Practice Policies – Where Do They Come from?|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=1990|volume=263|issue=9|pages=1265, 1269, 1272, 1275|doi=10.1001/jama.263.9.1265|pmid=2304243}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the setting of individual decision-making, practitioners can be given greater latitude in how they interpret research and combine it with their clinical judgment.&lt;ref name=sackett2 /&gt;&lt;ref name="greenhalgh2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenhalgh |first=Trisha |authorlink=Trisha Greenhalgh|title=The limits of evidence-based medicine|journal= Respiratory care|volume=46|issue=12|pages=1435–40|pmid=11728302|date=December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Eddy offered an umbrella definition for the two branches of EBM: "Evidence-based medicine is a set of principles and methods intended to ensure that to the greatest extent possible, medical decisions, guidelines, and other types of policies are based on and consistent with good evidence of effectiveness and benefit."&lt;ref name="eddybmapproach"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Eddy, DM|title=Evidence-based Medicine: a Unified Approach|journal=Health Affairs |date=2005|issue=1 |volume=24 |pages=9–17 |pmid=15647211 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15647211 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.1.9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Progress===
Both branches of evidence-based medicine spread rapidly. On the evidence-based guidelines and policies side, explicit insistence on evidence of effectiveness was introduced by the American Cancer Society in 1980.&lt;ref name="guidelines"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eddy D |title=ACS report on the cancer-related health checkup |journal=CA Cancer J Clin |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=193–240 |year=1980 |pmid=6774802|doi=10.3322/canjclin.30.4.194 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) began issuing guidelines for preventive interventions based on evidence-based principles in 1984.&lt;ref name="taskforce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/about.htm|title=About the USPSTF|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association applied strict evidence-based criteria for covering new technologies.&lt;ref name="rettig"&gt;{{cite book |first=R.A. |last=Rettig |first2=P.D. |last2=Jacobson |first3=C.M. |last3=Farquhar |first4=W.M. |last4=Aubry |title=False Hope : Bone Marrow Transplantation for Breast Cancer: Bone Marrow Transplantation for Breast Cancer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bbcTZLRRVmoC&amp;pg=PA183 |date=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-974824-2 |pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1987, specialty societies such as the American College of Physicians, and voluntary health organizations such as the American Heart Association, wrote many evidence-based guidelines. In 1991, Kaiser Permanente, a managed care organization in the US, began an evidence-based guidelines program.&lt;ref name="kaiserpermanente"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davino-Ramaya C, Krause LK, Robbins CW, Harris JS, Koster M, Chan W, Tom GI |title=Transparency matters: Kaiser Permanente's National Guideline Program methodological processes |journal=Perm J |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=55–62 |year=2012 |pmid=22529761 |pmc=3327114 |doi=10.7812/tpp/11-134}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Richard Smith wrote an editorial in the ''British Medical Journal'' and introduced the ideas of evidence-based policies in the UK.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith RJ|title=Where's the Wisdom: The Poverty of Medical Evidence|journal=BMJ|volume=303 |issue=6806 |pages=798–99 |year=1991 |pmid=1932964 |pmc=1671173 |doi=10.1136/bmj.303.6806.798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the Cochrane Collaboration created a network of 13 countries to produce of systematic reviews and guidelines.&lt;ref name="cochrane"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cochrane.org|title=The Cochrane Collaboration|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (then known as the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, or AHCPR) established Evidence-based Practice Centers (EPCs) to produce evidence reports and technology assessments to support the development of guidelines.&lt;ref name="ahrq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/evidence-based-reports/overview/index.html|title=Agency for Health Care Policy and Research|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, a National Guideline Clearinghouse that followed the principles of evidence-based policies was created by AHRQ, the AMA, and the American Association of Health Plans (now America's Health Insurance Plans).&lt;ref name="guideline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guideline.gov|title=National Guideline Clearinghouse|accessdate=August 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819030216/http://www.guideline.gov/|archive-date=August 19, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) was created in the UK.&lt;ref name="nice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk|title=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A central idea of this branch of evidence-based medicine is that evidence should be classified according to the rigor of its experimental design, and the strength of a recommendation should depend on the strength of the evidence.

On the medical education side, programs to teach evidence-based medicine have been created in medical schools in Canada, the US, the UK, Australia, and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ilic|first1=D|last2=Maloney|first2=S|title=Methods of teaching medical trainees evidence-based medicine: a systematic review.|journal=Medical education|date=February 2014|volume=48|issue=2|pages=124–35|doi=10.1111/medu.12288|pmid=24528395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maggio|first1=LA|last2=Tannery|first2=NH|last3=Chen|first3=HC|last4=ten Cate|first4=O|last5=O'Brien|first5=B|title=Evidence-based medicine training in undergraduate medical education: a review and critique of the literature published 2006-2011.|journal=Academic Medicine|date=July 2013|volume=88|issue=7|pages=1022–8|doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e3182951959|pmid=23702528}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study of UK programs found the more than half of UK medical schools offered some training in evidence-based medicine, although there was considerable variation in the methods and content, and EBM teaching was restricted by lack of curriculum time, trained tutors and teaching materials.&lt;ref name="medteach"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Meats E1, Heneghan C, Crilly M, Glasziou P|title=Evidence-based medicine teaching in UK medical schools|journal=Med Teach|date=April 2009|volume=31|issue=4|pages=332–37|doi=10.1080/01421590802572791 |pmid=19404893 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01421590802572791}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many programs have been developed to help individual physicians gain better access to evidence. For example, UpToDate was created in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="uptodate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uptodate.com/home|title=UpToDate|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cochrane Collaboration began publishing evidence reviews in 1993.&lt;ref name=kaiserpermanente /&gt; BMJ Publishing Group launched a 6-monthly periodical in 1995 called Clinical Evidence that provided brief summaries of the current state of evidence about important clinical questions for clinicians.&lt;ref name="clinicalevidence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clinicalevidence.bmj.com|title=Clinical Evidence|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then many other programs have been developed to make evidence more accessible to practitioners.

===Current practice===
The term evidence-based medicine is now applied to both the programs that are designing evidence-based guidelines and the programs that teach evidence-based medicine to practitioners. By 2000, "evidence-based medicine" had become an umbrella term for the emphasis on evidence in both population-level and individual-level decisions. In subsequent years, use of the term "evidence-based" had extended to other levels of the health care system. An example is "evidence-based health services", which seek to increase the competence of health service decision makers and the practice of evidence-based medicine at the organizational or institutional level.&lt;ref name="gray"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gray, J. A. Muir|date=2009|title=Evidence-based Health Care &amp; Public Health|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|isbn=9780443101236}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has also spread outside of healthcare; for example, in his 1996 inaugural speech as President of the Royal Statistical Society, Adrian Smith proposed that "[[evidence-based policy]]" should be established for education, prisons and policing policy and all areas of government work.

The multiple tributaries of evidence-based medicine share an emphasis on the importance of incorporating evidence from formal research in medical policies and decisions. However they differ on the extent to which they require good evidence of effectiveness before promulgating a guideline or payment policy, and they differ on the extent to which it is feasible to incorporate individual-level information in decisions. Thus, evidence-based guidelines and policies may not readily 'hybridise' with experience-based practices orientated towards ethical clinical judgement, and can lead to contradictions, contest, and unintended crises.&lt;ref name=eddy5 /&gt; The most effective 'knowledge leaders' (managers and clinical leaders) use a broad range of management knowledge in their decision making, rather than just formal evidence.&lt;ref name=feinstein2 /&gt; Evidence-based guidelines may provide the basis for [[governmentality]] in health care and consequently play a central role in the distant governance of contemporary health care systems.&lt;ref name=sackett /&gt;

==Methods==

===Steps===
The steps for designing explicit, evidence-based guidelines were described in the late 1980s: Formulate the question (population, intervention, comparison intervention, outcomes, time horizon, setting); search the literature to identify studies that inform the question; interpret each study to determine precisely what it says about the question; if several studies address the question, synthesize their results (meta-analysis); summarize the evidence in "evidence tables"; compare the benefits, harms and costs in a "balance sheet"; draw a conclusion about the preferred practice; write the guideline; write the rationale for the guideline; have others review each of the previous steps; implement the guideline.&lt;ref name=eddy4/&gt;

For the purposes of medical education and individual-level decision making, five steps of EBM in practice were described in 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cook DJ, Jaeschke R, Guyatt GH |title=Critical appraisal of therapeutic interventions in the intensive care unit: human monoclonal antibody treatment in sepsis.

Systematic reviews of published research studies is a major part of the evaluation of particular treatments. The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] is one of the best-known programs that conducts systematic reviews. Like other collections of systematic reviews, it requires authors to provide a detailed and repeatable plan of their literature search and evaluations of the evidence.&lt;ref name="Tanjong2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tanjong-Ghogomu|first=E|author2=Tugwell, P|author3=Welch, V|title=Evidence-based medicine and the Cochrane Collaboration|journal=Bulletin of the NYU hospital for joint diseases|year=2009|volume=67|issue=2|pages=198–205|pmid=19583554|url=http://www.nyuhjdbulletin.org/Permalink.aspx?permalinkId=07a150ec-2275-4bbf-9003-6ea200b62a4f|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601140339/http://www.nyuhjdbulletin.org/Permalink.aspx?permalinkId=07a150ec-2275-4bbf-9003-6ea200b62a4f|archivedate=2013-06-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once all the best evidence is assessed, treatment is categorized as (1) likely to be beneficial, (2) likely to be harmful, or (3) evidence did not support either benefit or harm.

A 2007 analysis of 1,016 systematic reviews from all 50 Cochrane Collaboration Review Groups found that 44% of the reviews concluded that the intervention was likely to be beneficial, 7% concluded that the intervention was likely to be harmful, and 49% concluded that evidence did not support either benefit or harm. 96% recommended further research.&lt;ref name="Mapping2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=El Dib RP, Atallah AN, Andriolo RB |title=Mapping the Cochrane evidence for decision making in health care |journal=J Eval Clin Pract |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=689–92 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17683315 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2753.2007.00886.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2001 review of 160 Cochrane systematic reviews (excluding complementary treatments) in the 1998 database revealed that, according to two readers, 41% concluded positive or possibly positive effect, 20% concluded evidence of no effect, 8% concluded net harmful effects, and 21% of the reviews concluded insufficient evidence.&lt;ref name="Ezzo2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ezzo J, Bausell B, Moerman DE, Berman B, Hadhazy V | title= Reviewing the reviews.

===Assessing the quality of evidence===
{{Main|Levels of evidence}}
Evidence quality can be assessed based on the source type (from [[meta-analyses]] and [[systematic reviews]] of [[triple-blind]] randomized [[clinical trials]] with concealment of allocation and no attrition at the top end, down to [[conventional wisdom]] at the bottom), as well as other factors including statistical validity, clinical relevance, currency, and peer-review acceptance. Evidence-based medicine categorizes different types of clinical evidence and rates or grades them&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essentialevidenceplus.com/product/ebm_loe.cfm?show=grade |title=EBM: Levels of Evidence |publisher=Essential Evidence Plus |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the strength of their freedom from the various biases that beset medical research. For example, the strongest evidence for therapeutic interventions is provided by systematic review of [[randomized]], triple-blind, [[placebo-controlled trials]] with allocation concealment and complete follow-up involving a homogeneous patient population and medical condition. In contrast, patient testimonials, case reports, and even expert opinion (however, some critics have argued that expert opinion "does not belong in the rankings of the quality of [[empirical evidence]] because it does not represent a form of empirical evidence" and continue that "expert opinion would seem to be a separate, complex type of knowledge that would not fit into hierarchies otherwise limited to empirical evidence alone").&lt;ref name="Tonelli99"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tonelli MR |title=In defense of expert opinion |journal=Acad Med |volume=74 |issue=11 |pages=1187–92 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10587679  |doi=10.1097/00001888-199911000-00010}}&lt;/ref&gt; have little value as proof because of the placebo effect, the biases inherent in observation and reporting of cases, difficulties in ascertaining who is an expert and more.

Several organizations have developed grading systems for assessing the quality of evidence. For example, in 1989 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) put forth the following:&lt;ref name="USPrevServTaskForce"&gt;{{cite book|author=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|title=Guide to clinical preventive services: report of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQGJHgI_dR8C&amp;pg=PR24 |date=August 1989|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-56806-297-6|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Level I: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed [[randomized controlled trial]].
* Level II-1: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without [[randomization]].
* Level II-2: Evidence obtained from well-designed [[Cohort study|cohort studies]] or [[case-control]] studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.
* Level II-3: Evidence obtained from multiple [[time series]] designs with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence.
* Level III: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.

Another example is the [[Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence|Oxford (UK) CEBM Levels of Evidence]]. First released in September 2000, the Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence provides 'levels' of evidence for claims about prognosis, diagnosis, treatment benefits, treatment harms, and screening, which most grading schemes do not address. The original CEBM Levels was Evidence-Based On Call to make the process of finding evidence feasible and its results explicit. In 2011, an international team redesigned the Oxford CEBM Levels to make it more understandable and to take into account recent developments in evidence ranking schemes. The Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence have been used by patients, clinicians and also to develop clinical guidelines including recommendations for the optimal use of phototherapy and topical therapy in [[psoriasis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=OCEBM Levels of Evidence Working Group|title=The Oxford Levels of Evidence 2’|url=http://www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=5653}}&lt;/ref&gt; and guidelines for the use of the BCLC staging system for diagnosing and monitoring [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=C.|author2=Gallini A|author3=Archier E|title=Evidence-Based Recommendations on Topical Treatment and Phototherapy of Psoriasis: Systematic Review and Expert Opinion of a Panel of Dermatologists|journal=Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venerology|year=2012|volume=26 |issue=Suppl 3|pages=1–10|pmid=22512675 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-3083.2012.04518.x|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, a system was developed by the [[GRADE]] (short for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) working group and takes into account more dimensions than just the quality of medical research.&lt;ref name="GRADE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/ |title=GRADE working group |accessdate=2007-09-24 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5EyFnGxmY?url=http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/ |archivedate=2006-04-07 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires users of GRADE  who are performing an assessment of the quality of evidence, usually as part of a systematic review, to consider the impact of different factors on their confidence in the results. Authors of GRADE tables grade the quality of evidence into four levels, on the basis of their confidence in the observed effect (a numerical value) being close to what the true effect is. The confidence value is based on judgements assigned in five different domains in a structured manner.&lt;ref name="balshem2011"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Balshem H, Helfand M, [[Holger Jens Schünemann|Schünemann]] HJ, etal |title=GRADE guidelines: 3. Rating the quality of evidence |journal=J Clin Epidemiol |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=401–6 |date=April 2011 |pmid=21208779 |doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2010.07.015 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0895-4356(10)00332-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GRADE working group defines 'quality of evidence' and 'strength of recommendations' based on the quality as two different concepts which are commonly confused with each other.&lt;ref name=balshem2011/&gt;

Systematic reviews may include randomized controlled trials that have low risk of bias, or, observational studies that have high risk of bias. In the case of randomized controlled trials, the quality of evidence is high, but can be downgraded in five different domains.&lt;ref name="GRADE Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|title=GRADE handbook for grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendation|year=2009|url=http://tech.cochrane.org/gradepro|edition=Version 3.2|veditors=[[Holger Jens Schünemann|Schünemann]] H, Brożek J, Oxman A|access-date=2016-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305115426/http://tech.cochrane.org/gradepro|archive-date=2016-03-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Risk of bias: Is a judgement made on the basis of the chance that bias in included studies has influenced the estimate of effect.
* Imprecision: Is a judgement made on the basis of the chance that the observed estimate of effect could change completely.
* Indirectness: Is a judgement made on the basis of the differences in characteristics of how the study was conducted and how the results are actually going to be applied.
* Inconsistency: Is a judgement made on the basis of the variability of results across the included studies.
* Publication bias: Is a judgement made on the basis of the question whether all the research evidence has been taken to account.

In the case of observational studies per GRADE, the quality of evidence starts of lower and may be upgraded in three domains in addition to being subject to downgrading.&lt;ref name="GRADE Handbook"/&gt;

* Large effect: This is when methodologically strong studies show that the observed effect is so large that the probability of it changing completely is less likely.
* Plausible confounding would change the effect: This is when despite the presence of a possible confounding factor which is expected to reduce the observed effect, the effect estimate still shows significant effect.
* Dose response gradient: This is when the intervention used becomes more effective with increasing dose. This suggests that a further increase will likely bring about more effect.

Meaning of the levels of quality of evidence as per GRADE:&lt;ref name="balshem2011"/&gt;
* High Quality Evidence: The authors are very confident that the estimate that is presented lies very close to the true value. One could interpret it as "there is very low probability of further research completely changing the presented conclusions."
* Moderate Quality Evidence: The authors are confident that the presented estimate lies close to the true value, but it is also possible that it may be substantially different. One could also interpret it as: further research may completely change the conclusions.
* Low Quality Evidence: The authors are not confident in the effect estimate and the true value may be substantially different. One could interpret it as "further research is likely to change the presented conclusions completely."
* Very low quality Evidence: The authors do not have any confidence in the estimate and it is likely that the true value is substantially different from it. One could interpret it as "new research will most probably change the presented conclusions completely."

===Categories of recommendations===
In guidelines and other publications, recommendation for a clinical service is classified by the balance of risk versus benefit and the level of evidence on which this information is based. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force uses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherman|first=M|author2=Burak K|author3=Maroun J|title=Multidisciplinary Canadian Consensus Recommendations for the Management and Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma’|journal=Current Oncology|year=2012|volume=18|issue=5|pages=228–40|pmc=3185900|doi=10.3747/co.v18i5.952|pmid=21980250|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Level A: Good scientific evidence suggests that the benefits of the clinical service substantially outweigh the potential risks. Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients.
* Level B: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the benefits of the clinical service outweighs the potential risks. Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients.
* Level C: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that there are benefits provided by the clinical service, but the balance between benefits and risks are too close for making general recommendations. Clinicians need not offer it unless there are individual considerations.
* Level D: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the risks of the clinical service outweighs potential benefits. Clinicians should not routinely offer the service to asymptomatic patients.
* Level I: Scientific evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, such that the risk versus benefit balance cannot be assessed. Clinicians should help patients understand the uncertainty surrounding the clinical service.

GRADE guideline panelists may make strong or weak recommendations on the basis of further criteria. Some of the important criteria are the balance between desirable and undesirable effects (not considering cost), the quality of the evidence, values and preferences and costs (resource utilization).&lt;ref name="GRADE Handbook"/&gt;

Despite the differences between systems, the purposes are the same: to guide users of clinical research information on which studies are likely to be most valid. However, the individual studies still require careful critical appraisal.

===Statistical measures===
Evidence-based medicine attempts to express clinical benefits of tests and treatments using mathematical methods. Tools used by practitioners of evidence-based medicine include:

*Likelihood ratio {{main|Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing}} The [[pre-test odds]] of a particular diagnosis, multiplied by the likelihood ratio, determines the [[pre- and post-test probability|post-test odds]]. (Odds can be calculated from, and then converted to, the [more familiar] probability.) This reflects [[Bayes' theorem]]. The differences in likelihood ratio between clinical tests can be used to prioritize clinical tests according to their usefulness in a given clinical situation.
*AUC-ROC The area under the [[receiver operating characteristic]] curve (AUC-ROC) reflects the relationship between [[sensitivity and specificity]] for a given test. High-quality tests will have an AUC-ROC approaching 1, and high-quality publications about clinical tests will provide information about the AUC-ROC. Cutoff values for positive and negative tests can influence specificity and sensitivity, but they do not affect AUC-ROC.
*[[Number needed to treat]] (NNT)/[[Number needed to harm]] (NNH). Number needed to treat or number needed to harm are ways of expressing the effectiveness and safety, respectively, of interventions in a way that is clinically meaningful. NNT is the number of people who need to be treated in order to achieve the desired outcome (e.g. survival from cancer) in one patient. For example, if a treatment increases the chance of survival by 5%, then 20 people need to be treated in order to have 1 additional patient survive due to the treatment. The concept can also be applied to diagnostic tests. For example, if 1339 women age 50–59 have to be invited for breast cancer screening over a ten-year period in order to prevent one woman from dying of breast cancer,&lt;ref name="BandolierStatins2004"&gt;"Patient Compliance with statins" ''[[Bandolier (journal)|Bandolier]] [http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/cardiac/patcomp.html Review] 2004  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150512021122/http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/cardiac/patcomp.html |date=2015-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then the NNT for being invited to breast cancer screening is 1339.

===Quality of clinical trials===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
Evidence-based medicine attempts to objectively evaluate the quality of clinical research by critically assessing techniques reported by researchers in their publications.

*Trial design considerations. High-quality studies have clearly defined eligibility criteria and have minimal missing data.
*Generalizability considerations. Studies may only be applicable to narrowly defined patient populations and may not be generalizable to other clinical contexts.
*Follow-up. Sufficient time for defined outcomes to occur can influence the prospective study outcomes and the [[statistical power]] of a study to detect differences between a treatment and control arm.
*Power. A mathematical calculation can determine if the number of patients is sufficient to detect a difference between treatment arms. A negative study may reflect a lack of benefit, or simply a lack of sufficient quantities of patients to detect a difference.

==Limitations and criticism==
Although evidence-based medicine is regarded as the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] of [[conventional medicine|clinical practice]], there are a number of limitations and criticisms of its use.&lt;ref name="Timmermans2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Timmermans S, Mauck A |title=The promises and pitfalls of evidence-based medicine |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=18–28 |year=2005 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/24/1/18.long |pmid=15647212 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.1.18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two widely cited categorization schemes for the various published critiques of EBM include the three-fold division of Straus and McAlister ("limitations universal to the practice of medicine, limitations unique to evidence-based medicine and misperceptions of evidence-based-medicine")&lt;ref name="Straus-McAlister-2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Straus|first1=SE|last2=McAlister|first2=FA|title=Evidence-based medicine: a commentary on common criticisms|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=3 October 2000|volume=163|issue=7|pages=837–41|pmid=11033714|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/163/7/837.full.pdf|pmc=80509}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the five-point categorization of Cohen, Stavri and Hersh (EBM is a poor philosophic basis for medicine, defines evidence too narrowly, is not evidence-based, is limited in usefulness when applied to individual patients, or reduces the autonomy of the doctor/patient relationship).&lt;ref name="Cohen-2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=AM|last2=Stavri|first2=PZ|last3=Hersh|first3=WR|title=A categorization and analysis of the criticisms of Evidence-Based Medicine|journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics|date=February 2004|volume=73|issue=1|pages=35–43|doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2003.11.002|pmid=15036077|url=http://skynet.ohsu.edu/~hersh/ijmi-04-ebm.pdf|df=}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In no particular order, some published objections include:

* The theoretical ideal of EBM (that every narrow clinical question, of which hundreds of thousands can exist, would be answered by meta-analysis and systematic reviews of multiple RCTs) faces the limitation that research (especially the RCTs themselves) is expensive; thus, in reality, for the foreseeable future, there will always be much more demand for EBM than supply, and the best humanity can do is to triage the application of scarce resources.
* Research produced by EBM, such as from [[randomized controlled trial]]s (RCTs), may not be relevant for all treatment situations.&lt;ref name="pmid11489034"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Upshur RE, VanDenKerkhof EG, Goel V |title=Meaning and measurement: an inclusive model of evidence in health care |journal=J Eval Clin Pract |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=91–96 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11489034 |issn=1356-1294 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2753.2001.00279.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research tends to focus on specific populations, but individual persons can vary substantially from population norms. Since certain population segments have been historically under-researched (racial minorities and people with co-morbid diseases), evidence from RCTs may not be generalizable to those populations.&lt;ref name = "orvyhi"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rogers WA |title=Evidence based medicine and justice: a framework for looking at the impact of EBM upon vulnerable or disadvantaged groups |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=141–45 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15082806 |pmc=1733835 |doi=10.1136/jme.2003.007062 |url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/30/2/141.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus EBM applies to groups of people, but this should not preclude clinicians from using their personal experience in deciding how to treat each patient. One author advises that "the knowledge gained from clinical research does not directly answer the primary clinical question of what is best for the patient at hand" and suggests that evidence-based medicine should not discount the value of clinical experience.&lt;ref name="Tonelli99" /&gt; Another author stated that "the practice of evidence-based medicine means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research."&lt;ref name="Sackett96"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sackett |first1=DL | last2=Rosenberg |first2=WM |last3=Gray |first3=JA |last4=Haynes |first4=RB |last5=Richardson |first5=WS |title=Evidence based medicine: what it is and what it isn't |journal=BMJ |volume=312 |issue=7023 |pages=71–72 |date=January 1996 |pmid=8555924 |pmc=2349778  |doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7023.71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application of evidence in clinical settings ==
One of the ongoing challenges with evidence-based medicine is that some healthcare providers do not follow the evidence.  This happens partly because the current balance of evidence for and against treatments shifts constantly, and it is impossible to learn about every change.&lt;ref name="Epstein"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/when-evidence-says-no-but-doctors-say-yes|title=When Evidence Says No, But Doctors Say Yes|last=Epstein|first=David|date=2017-02-22|newspaper=ProPublica|access-date=2017-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even when the evidence is unequivocally against a treatment, it usually takes ten years for other treatments to be adopted.&lt;ref name="Epstein" /&gt;  In other cases, significant change can require a generation of physicians to retire or die, and be replaced by physicians who were trained with more recent evidence.&lt;ref name="Epstein" /&gt;

Another major cause of physicians and other healthcare providers treating patients in ways unsupported by the evidence is that these healthcare providers are subject to the same cognitive biases as all other humans.

A Campbell systematic review that included 24 trials examined the effectiveness of e-learning in improving evidence-based health care knowledge and practice. It was found that e-learning, compared to no learning, improves evidence-based health care knowledge and skills but not attitudes and behaviour. There is no difference in outcomes when comparing e-learning to face-to-face learning. Combining e-learning with face-to-face learning (blended learning) has a positive impact on evidence-based knowledge, skills, attitude and behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rohwer, Anke; Motaze, Nkengafac Villyen; Rehfuess, Eva; Young, Taryn|title=E-learning of evidence-based health care (EBHC) to increase EBHC competencies in healthcare professionals: a systematic review|journal=Campbell Systematic Reviews|date=2017|volume=4|doi=10.4073/csr.2017.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related to e-learning, medical school students have engaged with editing Wikipedia to increase their EBM skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Azzam|first1=A|last2=Bresler|first2=D|last3=Leon|first3=A|last4=Maggio|first4=L|last5=Whitaker|first5=E|last6=Heilman|first6=J|last7=Orlowitz|first7=J|last8=Swisher|first8=V|last9=Rasberry|first9=L|last10=Otoide|first10=K|last11=Trotter|first11=F|last12=Ross|first12=W|last13=McCue|first13=JD|title=Why Medical Schools Should Embrace Wikipedia: Final-Year Medical Student Contributions to Wikipedia Articles for Academic Credit at One School.|journal=Academic Medicine|date=February 2017|volume=92|issue=2|pages=194–200|doi=10.1097/ACM.0000000000001381|pmid=27627633|pmc=5265689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feed My Starving Children''' is a Christian [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] that coordinates the packaging and distribution of food to people in [[Developing country|developing nations]]. Founded in 1987, it has reached out to more than 70 countries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fmsc.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding===
Richard Proudfit, a Minneapolis business man and philanthropist, founded the organization after visiting Honduras after a hurricane. Proudfit witnessed dying starving children all around him and was moved to start Feed My Starving Children in 1987. Proudfit risked his life in war zones around the world to feed starving children. Proudfit passed away November 13th, 2018. Together with his second foundation Kids against hunger the two organizations feed over 1 billion children annually. Proudfit received the [[Jefferson Award for Public Service]] in 2012joining the ranks of Bill Gates and Paul Newman.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.startribune.com/feed-my-starving-children-founder-dies-at-88/500424401/&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization recruits volunteers including school children to assist in packing. They also employ paid staff to supervise the operations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fmsc.org&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2184">'''Fire water''' refers to water that has been used in [[firefighting]] and requires disposal. In many cases it is a highly polluting material and requires special care in its disposal. &lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/PMHO600BBUD-e-e.pdf Managing Fire water and major spillages - Environment Agency Guidance note PPG18( retrieved 19 April 2009)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219043323/http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/PMHO600BBUD-e-e.pdf |date=19 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many fire fighting situations, large quantities of water remain after the fire has been extinguished. The water contains materials present in the building and also contains dissolved and particulate materials from [[combustion]] processes and materials generated through quenching. Fire water can be particularly polluting when the building or site being extinguished itself contains potentially polluting materials such as [[pesticide]]s, [[organic chemical|organic]] and [[inorganic chemical]] reagents, [[fertilizer]]s, etc. Certain types of premises including [[farm]]s and the [[chemical industry]] pose special risks because of the types of materials present. Premises containing quantities of [[plastic]]s can also cause severe problems because of the taste and odor imparted to the fire water. Releasing contaminated fire water into a river or other water source subsequently used to supply  [[drinking water]] may render the untreated water supply unsuitable for drinking or food preparation.

Managing fire water frequently requires that the water be contained on site and then removed from site for specialised treatment. One of the recognised techniques is to contain the fire water in the drainage system using [[pneumatic bladder]]s or lockable non-return valves which can be activated either automatically or manually.

Fire water containment is one of the many environmental factors that is considered alongside spill and pollution containment as an essential part of any company's environmental policy for ISO14001 accreditation.

'''Glasgow Corporation Water Works''' and its successors have provided a public water supply and sewerage and sewage treatment services to the Scottish city of [[Glasgow]]. There were several schemes in the early part of the 1800s, with the Glasgow Company which was established in 1806 pumping filtered water from the [[River Clyde]] into the city. The Gorbals Gravitation Water Company was established in 1846, and brought water from reservoirs to the south-west of the city. However, an outbreak of [[cholera]] in 1848/1849, in which 4,000 people died, concentrated the minds of Glasgow Council, and in 1855 a scheme to use water from [[Loch Katrine]], {{convert|36|mi|km}} to the north, was authorised. The work required at Loch Katrine was quite modest, and the major construction work was the building of an aqueduct to carry the water to the city by gravity.

The civil engineer [[John Frederick Bateman]] managed the contract, but the engineer for final section into the city was James Morris Gale, who became the Engineer in Chief for the Glasgow Water Commissioners when the project was completed in 1859. He oversaw the development of the system, with levels in Loch Katrine being raised and a second aqueduct being constructed, until he retired in 1902. Extra water was obtained from Loch Arklet in 1914, when a dam and tunnel into Loch Katrine were completed, but a similar scheme to impound water in Glen Finglas and feed it through a tunnel to Loch Katrine was delayed by the First World War, and was not implemented until 1965. A new treatment works at Milngavie costing £120 million was completed in 2008 and opened [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]].

Glasgow also invested in sewerage, with sewage treatment works opening at Dalmarnock in 1894, Dalmuir in 1904 and Shieldhall in 1910. They carried out research into better ways to treat sewage, and until 1935 sold sludge cakes as "Globe Fertiliser". Surplus sludge was carried away by a fleet of sludge ships, to be dumped at sea, and the ships also took passengers along for the voyage, initially to help recuperating soldiers, but later for the general public. A major upgrade to the sewerage infrastructure took place in 2017, when a {{convert|3.1|mi|km|adj=on}} tunnel was completed, to provide storm water storage, a project which reduces flood risk, and should ensure that the River Clyde is not polluted by sewage overflows in storm conditions.

==History==
The earliest known records of activity concerning a public water supply in Glasgow date from 1805, when the civil engineer [[Thomas Telford]] produced a report on schemes for supplying Glasgow and its suburbs with water. In 1806 he produced a second report{{sfn |Skempton |2002 |p=693}} and an [[Act of Parliament]] was obtained to create the Glasgow Company. They took advice from the Scottish inventor and mechanical engineer [[James Watt]], and plans for a water treatment works on the north bank of the [[River Clyde]] were drawn up by Telford. The company constructed filtering beds and ponds, and bought two [[Boulton and Watt steam engine]]s, but the system did not work well, and a new works was constructed on the south bank. In order to filter water from the river, they constructed a tunnel below river level, with open joints between the bricks, which allowed water to seep through the river bank, which was formed of sand, and to be drawn off from the tunnel. Although the filtering was not particularly efficient, the system lasted for 30 years, and provided {{convert|3|e6impgal|Ml}} per day on average, with the amount available depending on the river level.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=190}}

A second company was established by Act of Parliament in 1812.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=190}} The civil engineer and statistician [[James Cleland (statistician)|James Cleland]] produced a report in 1813, on a scheme for raising and distributing water, and building public baths,{{sfn |Skempton |2002 |p=141}} and there was a flurry of activity in the 1830s. [[James Jardine]], who was engineer for much of the early work for the [[Edinburgh Water Company]], was consulted in 1834,{{sfn |Skempton |2002 |p=359}} [[Thomas Grainger]] published a report on the Glasgow water supply in 1835,{{sfn |Skempton |2002 |p=265}} and [[Robert Thom (engineer)|Robert Thom]], the designer of the self-cleaning sand filter used in water purification, produced another report in 1837.{{sfn |Skempton |2002 |pp=698-699}} The Glasgow Company took over the other company in 1838, but the quality of the water they supplied was poor, and there was general dissatisfaction with their performance. This resulted in a number of alternative schemes being considered.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=190}}

The first was a scheme to exploit the waters of [[Loch Lubnaig]], in the River Callender catchment, some {{convert|80|mi|km}} to the north of Glasgow. This was abandoned when it was discovered that more compensation water would be required than the loch could hold. The neighbouring [[Loch Katrine]] was also considered, but was not pursued at that time.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=190}} The engineer [[Nathaniel Beardmore]] moved to London in 1843, where he collaborated with [[James Meadows Rendel (engineer)|James Meadows Rendel]] on a project for the Glasgow Gravitation Water Company. The scheme was for a reservoir at Gilmerston, in the valley of the [[River Avon, Falkirk|River Avon]], and a {{convert|24|mi|km|adj=on}} aqueduct to transport the water to Glasgow. Some work was carried out in 1844, but the project was abandoned in early 1845.{{sfn |Cross-Rudkin |Chrimes |2008 |p=69}}

One successful scheme was the Gorbals Gravitation Water Company, which obtained an Act of Parliament in 1846, allowing them to supply water to the population living to the south of the Clyde, obtained from a catchment of {{convert|2560|acre|ha}} to the south-west of Glasgow. The engineer for the scheme was William Gale, who supervised the construction of the works and two earth dams to impound the water, at Waulkmill Glen and Ryat Linn. The initial phase was completed in 1848, and a second phase, which included the construction of a third reservoir at Balgray, was finished in 1854. The reservoir outlets were arranged so that water could be drawn off at several different levels, and the scheme produced about {{convert|5.5|e6impgal|Ml}} per day, of which {{convert|1.5|e6impgal|Ml}} were required for compensation water, to maintain flows in the river system, and the rest was available to the people of Glasgow. Some 75,000 benefitted from a constant supply of good quality filtered water, as Gale strongly advocated that water should be available all the time.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=190-191}}

Residents in other parts of the city were not so fortunate, as the insanitary conditions led to an outbreak of [[cholera]] in 1848/1849, in which around 4,000 people died.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=1244 |title=Loch Katrine and aqueducts |publisher=Engineering Timelines |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1852 there was an attempt to revive the Loch Lubnaig scheme, but this was opposed in Parliament by Glasgow Council, and in this they were assisted by the civil engineer [[John Frederick Bateman]]. Having defeated the bill, they asked Bateman for advice on a suitable water supply, and he favoured the Loch Katrine scheme. The council then sought advice from other engineers on that and other schemes, but both Stephenson and Brunel supported Bateman's proposal. The council therefore sought authorisation for it, and an Act of Parliament was obtained on 12 July 1855.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=191}}&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

===Loch Katrine===
[[File:Loch Venachar sluice house 2186860 geograph.jpg|thumb|right|The sluice house on Loch Venachar, which controlled the release of compensation water.]]
Compared to the massive earth dams that were being built to supply Edinburgh with water at a similar time, the reservoir works for the Loch Katrine scheme were rather modest. Water was stored in the loch by allowing the water levels to vary between {{convert|4|ft|mm}} above the normal level and {{convert|3|ft|mm}} below it. The Act allowed {{convert|50|e6impgal|Ml}} per day to be taken into the water supply, but in order to maintain flows on the river system below it, the outlet of [[Loch Venachar]] was also modified, so that it could be controlled to supply {{convert|40.5|e6impgal|Ml}} of compensation water per day. The water level of Loch Katrine is {{convert|364|ft|m}} above sea level, and water for Glasgow is conveyed by gravity along an aqueduct to a reservoir at Mugdock, some {{convert|10|mi|km}} from the city centre. The aqueduct is {{convert|26|mi|km}} long, of which {{convert|13|mi|km}} is tunnel, {{convert|9|mi|km}} consists of an open channel or bridges, and the rest is made from pipelines. The tunnelled sections and cuts were designed to carry the maximum allowed by the Act, but the pipelines were only sized to allow half of that volume initially. The service reservoir at Mugdock held {{convert|548|e6impgal|Ml}}, and from there it was conveyed into the city through twin {{convert|36|in|mm|adj=on}} pipes.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=191-192}} The scheme was completed in 1859 and was formally opened by [[Queen Victoria]],{{sfn |Cross-Rudkin |Chrimes |2008 |p=62}} having cost £918,000.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

The aqueduct includes 70 tunnels, with one just south of Loch Katrine being {{convert|2325|yd|m}} long and {{convert |600|ft|m|sigfig=3}} below the land surface at its deepest point. Twelve access shafts were constructed to allow work to proceed at multiple faces. 25 bridges were needed to carry the aqueduct pipes over depressions. That across the Duchray valley is {{convert|636|ft|m}} long, and its masonry piers are up to {{convert|52|ft|m|1}} high. It originally carried a single pipe, but a second was added above the first in the 1860s. A third pipe was added in 1881, carried by a steel trussed girder bridge on sandstone piers. The longest bridge is at Corrie, and is {{convert|996|ft|m}} long. Castle Burn is crossed by a bridge {{convert|441|ft|m|1}} long, and there are three bridges at Couligarten, with lengths of {{convert|372|ft|m|1}}, {{convert|462|ft|m|1}} and {{convert|636|ft|m}}. The masonry was built of dry stone, but mortar was added in the 1860s.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

While Bateman had managed the main pipeline, James Morris Gale became the resident engineer for the city section of the project. After it all opened in 1859, he became Engineer in Chief for the Glasgow Water Commissioners, a post he held for over 40 years until he retired in 1902. By 1882, the supply from Loch Katrine was no longer sufficient, and he suggested a scheme to double the pipeline, raise the levels in Loch Katrine a little more, and to obtain further sources from other lochs in the vicinity of Loch Katrine.{{sfn |Cross-Rudkin |Chrimes |2008 |p=325}} Acts of Parliament were obtained in 1883 and 1885, which allowed the level of Loch Katrine to be raised by {{convert|5|ft|m}}. This required the construction of a new dam, which was located just downstream of the first dam, and had nine sluices to control compensation water, rather than the four of the original dam.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; This work was carried out using direct labour between 1886 and 1896,{{sfn |Cross-Rudkin |Chrimes |2008 |p=325}} and an official opening took place on 21 June 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Canmore |num=284266 |desc=Blairhullichan, Loch Katrine Aqueduct, Stone |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gale chose a more direct route for the new aqueduct, which involved more tunnelling, but by this time pneumatic drills and better explosives were available, and he felt that the long bridges such as that at Duchray were the least satisfactory element of the original design. Friction in the tunnels of the first route had reduced the throughput below what had been expected, and the new tunnels were lines with concrete to improve flows. The revised route for the second aqueduct was {{convert|2.2|mi|km}} shorter, and the possible throughput with both aqueducts in use increased to {{convert|70|e6impgal|Ml}} per day.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

At [[Milngavie]], Mugdock Reservoir was built as a holding reservoir for water arriving from Loch Katrine. A number of buildings with rubble walls and slate roofs dating from this first phase survive.&lt;ref name=Mugdock&gt;{{Canmore |num=166747 |desc=Mugdock Reservoir |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1890s when the pipeline was doubled, Craigmaddie reservoir was built to act as a second holding reservoir. Work started on 1 May 1896 and it was completed on 11 June 1896, but there were problems with leakage, and a deep trench was cut to resolve the issue, so it was not operational until 1 January 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{Canmore |num=158786 |desc=Craigmaddie Reservoir |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A causeway and dam, which is faced with rubble, separates the two reservoirs. Both reservoirs have a draw-off tower and straining well, to remove debris from the water supply. The straining wells were decommissioned in 2007 as part of the construction of a new treatment works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Canmore |num=287523 |desc=Mugdock straining well |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mugdock/&gt;

A further Act was obtained in 1902, which authorised the construction of a {{convert|1050|ft|m|adj=on}} dam at the western end of Loch Arklet to impound the water, and a tunnel through a ridge of hills at the eastern end, allowing the water to flow into Loch Katrine. Work on this scheme began in 1909, and was completed in 1914. Construction of a dam across the River Turk to impound water in Glen Finglas and excavation of a connecting tunnel to Loch Katrine was authorised by an Act of 1903, but little work was done due to the start of the [[First World War]]. By the time hostilities ceased, construction costs had risen significantly, and the project was deferred, with the tunnel finally being completed in 1958 and the dam in 1965. As the Glen Finglas scheme did not proceed at that time, the level of Loch Katrine was raised by another {{convert|5|ft|m}} between 1919 and 1929, by raising the height of the dam. The extra height meant that the dam also had to be lengthened, and it was extended to {{convert|240|ft|m}}. When the work was completed, it allowed the top {{convert|17|ft|m}} of the loch to be used for water supply, representing a reserve of nine months.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

===Development===
Restructuring of the water industry has followed a different path in Scotland to that of England and Wales. The [[Water (Scotland) Act 1967]] was an attempt to consolidate the large number of water supply authorities, and created 13 regional water boards.{{sfn |Lobina |Terhorst |2005 |p=6}} Responsibility for Glasgow's water supply passed to the Lower Clyde Water Board, along with eleven other suppliers.{{sfn |Parliament |1967 |pp=2}} Under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], the functions of the water boards were taken over by regional councils, who were also given responsibility for sewerage and sewage treatment. Control of these functions works passed to [[Strathclyde]] Regional Council.{{sfn |Matthews |Gardiner |1999 |p=18}} It subsequently passed to the West of Scotland Water Authority in 1996, and in 2002 was transferred to the newly-formed [[Scottish Water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishwater.co.uk/old-education/all-about-water/history-of-water |title=The History of Water |publisher=Scottish Water |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As regulations for water quality have become more stringent, there has been a need for more water treatment before water enters the domestic supply system. For the Loch Katrine water supply, this is handled by a works at [[Balmore]] and a new treatment works at Milngavie, which is partly underground, cost £120 million and was completed in 2008.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; The need for a new works was highlighted in August 2002, when following the [[2002 Glasgow floods]], the waterborne parasite [[cryptosporidium]] was found in the Mugdock reservoir, and 140,000 people had to boil their water before drinking it, until the problem could be eradicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2171593.stm |title=Cryptosporidium strikes again |date=4 August 2002 |publisher=BBC News Online |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction project for the works was managed by [[Black &amp; Veatch]], and the impact on the landscape was reduced by constructing part of the works below ground, and using lamella clarifiers, which take up less room than sludge cone settlement tanks. The works was formally opened by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] and won the 2007 Utility Industry Achievement Award, having been completed ahead of its time schedule and for £10 million below its budgeted cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.waterbriefing.org/home/company-news/item/614-queen-opens-milngavie-water-treatment-works-in-scotland |title=Queen opens Milngavie water treatment works in Scotland |publisher=Water Briefing |date=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sewerage===
Since the publication of [[Edwin Chadwick]]'s ''Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain'' in 1842, there had been a growing understanding that the health of people in cities depended both on a clean water supply and an efficient method of disposal and treatment of sewage, to prevent the occurrence of waterborne diseases such as cholera.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=5-6}} Despite such knowledge, little was done to provide sewers until there was a general outcry about the state of the [[River Clyde]] and other watercourses.&lt;ref name=shieldhall&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ss-shieldhall.co.uk/Glasgow_fleet |title=History of the Glasgow Sludge Fleet |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Caledonian Railway]] wanted to construct tunnels below Glasgow's streets, a condition of their authorisation was that they had to reconstruct the sewers, such as they were, and on this they spent £200,000. The sewers became part of Glasgow Corporation's main drainage scheme, which served an area of {{convert|25000|acre|km2}}. Glasgow was effectively divided into three, with each sector having its own sewage treatment works. Dalmarnock Works was the first to open in 1894, to be followed by Dalmuir in 1904 and Shieldhall in 1910.&lt;ref name=timeline2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=1250 |title=Dalmarnock Sewage Treatment Works |publisher=Engineering Timelines |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalmarnock Sewage Treatment Works was the first large-scale installation of its type in Scotland. Gustav Valentine Alsing, who was Danish and an acknowledged expert on chemical precipitation, designed the works. Construction began in 1893 and it was completed the following year. Sewage flowed into the works through three {{convert|4|ft|m}} channels, were floating material was screened off and incinerated. Grit, sand and other heavy solids settled out in catch pits, and was transported away from the site by railway, as the Caledonian Railway had a siding into the works. The liquor passed into 24 settling tanks, each able to hold {{convert|81000|impgal|l|sigfig=3}}, was aerated, and then entered 60 coke filters, which covered an area of {{convert|3|acre|ha}}. Sand filters provided the final stage of treatment, before the liquid was discharged into the Clyde. The coke filters were not particularly successful, and were abandoned in favour of precipitation. Sludge from this process was mixed with lime and the water content removed in filter presses, to form sludge cakes, which were also removed from the site by rail.&lt;ref name=timeline2/&gt; A Cunmor drying plant was then installed, and the sludge cakes were marketed as "Globe Fertiliser", with sales reaching 32,000 tons per year by 1911. However, the works produced a greater volume than this, and the surplus was taken by boat to be dumped at sea near Garrock Head on the Isle of Bute.&lt;ref name=Dalmarnock&gt;{{Canmore |num=277713 |desc=Dalmarnock Sewage Treatment Works |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of "Globe Fertiliser" lasted until 1935.&lt;ref name=timeline2/&gt;

The works experimented with bacterial treatment in 1900, and eight bacterial beds were constructed. Filter beds covering {{convert|5|acre|ha|0}} followed in 1913, as a test bed for biological filtration.&lt;ref name=Dalmarnock/&gt; In 1914, a pumping main was constructed to carry untreated sludge from the works to the Shieldhall works, from where sludge boats took it to be dumped at sea. The pipeline was {{convert|6|mi|km}} long and {{convert|9|in|mm}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=timeline2/&gt; Ardern and Lockett had discovered the Activated Sludge Process while carrying out research at the [[Davyhulme Sewage Works]] in Manchester in 1914,{{sfn |Nicholls |2015 |p=25}} and when the works was in need of improvement in the 1930s, a Simplex Activated Sludge Plant was built to try out the new process. A full activated sludge plant was built between 1962 and 1968 by the consulting engineers Babtie, Shaw &amp; Morton, at a cost of £4 million.&lt;ref name=Dalmarnock/&gt;

The sewerage infrastructure was improved significantly in 2017, with the completion of a tunnel {{convert|3.1|mi|km}} long, which provides {{convert|20|e6impgal|Ml|sigfig=1}} of storm water storage. It will reduce the risk of flooding and the likelihood that sewage will overflow into the Clyde during storms. The tunnel runs between Craigton and Queen's Park in south Glasgow, is {{convert|15.5|ft|m}} in diameter, and was constructed by a consortium of [[Costain Group|Costain]] and [[Vinci SA|Vinci Construction Grand Projets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-44998611 |title=Shieldhall Tunnel now operational as Scotland's biggest sewer |publisher=BBC |date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sludge fleet===
Once sewage had been processed, much of the sludge was taken by ship to be dumped at sea. Glasgow Corporation owned six ships at various times, and borrowed a seventh briefly. ''Dalmuir'' was ordered for the opening of Dalmuir Works, and ''Shieldhall'' was ordered for the opening of Shieldhall Works. ''Dalmuir'' was replaced by ''Dalmarnock'', and the two ships shared the sludge workings. ''Shieldhall'' was loaned to Manchester Corporation between 1941 and 1947, as their vessel which carried sludge from Davyhulme Sewage Works had been destroyed by a mine. ''Dalmarnock'' was able to maintain the service from Glasgow, as the sludge was dumped near Loch Long, rather than near the Isle of Bute, due to the presence of a defence boom across the Firth of Clyde near Dunoon.&lt;ref name=shieldhall/&gt; Dumping of sludge at sea was discontinued in 1998, following the implementation of the EU [[Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive]].{{sfn |Lobina |Terhorst |2005 |p=30}}

Most of the ships also carried passengers on the sludge runs, a tradition the probably began during the First World War, as a way to help convalescing soldiers, although there are suggestions that some poor and elderly passengers may have been carried before that war. Subsequently, the ships carried organised groups of passengers during the summer months. After it had spent a few years working out of Southampton for the Southern Water Authority, the second ''Shieldhall'' was bought by the Solent Steam Packet Co in 1988 for preservation, and offers trips from Southampton.&lt;ref name=shieldhall/&gt;

This article documents the effort of the [[Health Level 7|Health Level Seven(HL7)]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hl7.org  Health Level Seven ]&lt;/ref&gt; community and specifically the HL7 Architecture Board &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hl7.org/Special/Committees/arb/index.cfm HL7 Architecture Board ]&lt;/ref&gt; (ArB) to develop an interoperability framework that would support services, messages, and [[Clinical Document Architecture| Clinical Document Architecture(CDA)]] [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 10871.

[[Health Level 7|HL7]] provides a framework and standards for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information.
==SAIF Overview==
The [[Health Level 7|HL7]] Services-Aware Interoperability Framework Canonical Definition (SAIF-CD) &lt;ref name=SAIFCD&gt;[http://www.hl7.org/permalink/?SAIFCDR1PUBLIC  SAIF-CD]&lt;/ref&gt; provides consistency between all artifacts, and enables a standardized approach to [[enterprise architecture]] (EA) development and implementation, and a way to measure the consistency.

SAIF is a way of thinking about producing specifications that explicitly describe the governance, conformance, compliance, and behavioral semantics that are needed to achieve computable semantic working interoperability. The intended information transmission technology might use a messaging, document exchange, or services approach.

SAIF is the framework that is required to rationalize interoperability of standards. SAIF is an ''architecture'' for achieving interoperability, but it is not a whole-solution design for enterprise architecture management.

The informative document may be found at [http://www.hl7.org/permalink/?SAIFCDR1PUBLIC Public SAIF CD].  Since the release of this document, the SAIF-CD has been balloted as a Draft Standard for Trial Use.  The document will be made available by the end of May, 2012.

A [http://www.vimeo.com/29805751 Short introduction to SAIF] was made to provide insight to users of the SAIF-CD.

==Document Divisions==
The SAIF-CD consists of the following sections:
*Introduction
*Governance Framework (GF)
*Behavioral Framework (BF)
*Information Framework(IF)
*Enterprise Consistency and Conformity Framework (ECCF)
*Interoperability Specification Matrix (ISM)
*Compliant SAIF Implementation Guides
*Appendix
===Introduction===
The SAIF Introduction and Overview describes the general constructs that frame the SAIF. SAIF represents a synthesis of best practices and concepts from multiple architectural frameworks. This introduction to SAIF goes into a lot of technical depth and assumes you are already familiar with architectural standards and the [[Health Level 7|HL7]] organization.

===Governance Framework ===
The Governance Framework (GF) describes the motivation for, the structure, content and utilization of the GF.  The [[HL7_Services_Aware_Interoperability_Framework#Enterprise Conformance and Compliance Framework|ECCF]] and  [[HL7_Services_Aware_Interoperability_Framework#Behavioral Framework|BF]]  are discussed in detail in separate documents, and are mentioned in the course of this document only when necessary to either contextualize or logically link GF content to the larger context of the Services Aware Interoperability Framework.

===Behavioral Framework ===
The Behavioral Framework (BF) provides a set of constructs for defining the behavioral semantics of specifications, which enable working interoperability. As a result, the focus of the BF is accountability – a description of “who does what when.” Accountability describes the perspective of the various technology components that are involved in a particular instance or scenario designed to achieve Working Interoperability. The BF is technology-neutral and, therefore, can be used within model-driven specification stacks.

===Information Framework===
The Information Framework (IF) is a  SAIF-compliant recasting of existing [[Health Level 7|HL7]] expertise regarding the specification of static semantics.
The Information Framework will draw on the information available from the following sources:
*Storyboards
*Domain Analysis Models (DAM)
*Reference Information Model (RIM) [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]21731
*Vocabulary concepts
*HL7 Core Principles

===Enterprise Consistency and Conformity Framework===
The major goal of the Enterprise Consistency and Conformity Framework  (ECCF) is enabling working interoperability between different users, organizations, and systems. The ECCF is manifest in a structure called the ECCF specification stack (SS). This structure identifies, defines, organizes, and relates a set of artifacts that collectively specify the relevant semantics of a software component specification or other system-of- interest. In summary, the ECCF SS provides an organizational framework in which inter-related artifacts are sorted by content –  for example a Unified Modeling Language (UML) activity diagram in the Business viewpoint that contains static data constructs (for example, documents or data structures) which passes between the various structures would all have the relevant static constructs detailed in artifacts, specifically, business rules, information constructors, behavioral contracts, and level-of-abstraction. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Interoperability Specification Matrix (ISM) ===
The Interoperability Specification Matrix (ISM) defines a 5-column-by-3-row matrix (“table”) which distributes the multiple aspects of a given component’s specification across the various cells of the matrix. The structure of the ISM is based on proven cognitive models for describing complex systems which revolve around the notion of partitioning complexity based on a number of Dimensions while simultaneously viewing each of these dimensions from multiple Perspectives.

===Compliant SAIF Implementation Guides===
This section defines the creation of a compliant implementation guide.

The '''Institute of Palliative Medicine''' is an education, training and research centre for [[palliative care]] located in [[Kozhikode]], [[India]].&lt;ref name="The best place to die in India"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fridaymagazine.ae/making-difference/the-best-place-to-die-in-india-1.1846459 | title=The best place to die in India | publisher=Friday Magazine | date=17 June 2016 | accessdate=June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute trains health care professionals in palliative care and related medical disciplines. Through its connection with [[Calicut Medical College]] and other clinics in the state of [[Kerala]], the institute supports between 4,500 and 5,000 patients per week. This institute is an organ of Pain and Palliative Care Society, Medical College, Calicut, which was founded in 1993.&lt;ref name="The best place to die in India" /&gt;

==History==
The institute began as an outpatient unit at [[Calicut Medical College|Government Medical College, Calicut]] in 1993. In 1999, the [[Pain and Palliative Care Society]] established the 'Neighbourhood Network in Palliative Care', aimed at increasing community participation in palliative care. In 2003, the Institute was shifted to a separate building for training, research and patient care. In 2008, this institute was recognized as a WHO collaborating centre in community participation in palliative care.

==Mission==
The Pain &amp; Palliative Care Society believes that individuals and families coping with a life-threatening illness deserve efficient access to services that are designed to enhance their quality of life and enable them to receive care in the setting of their choice.

==Services==
The outpatient department of Institute of Palliative Medicine receives about 250 patients per week. The inpatient department has 30 beds and admits around 15 patients per week. All services provided at this institute, including food and accommodation are free of cost for all patients. There are home-based care facilities to meet patients at their residences from 9 am to 5 pm everyday. The home-care wing reaches out to around 750 patients per week. Round-the-clock services are available for homecare to registered patients living in [[Kozhikode]] city.

==Recognition==
In 1996 the [[World Health Organization]] conferred on this society, the title 'Demonstration Project' and it became their model to the developing world. WHO has since accredited the institute as a ''World Health Organization Collaborating Center'' (WHOCC).&lt;ref name="World Health Organization Collaborating Center"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://palliumindia.org/2010/11/institute-of-palliative-medicine-who-collaborating-centre/ | title=World Health Organization Collaborating Center | publisher=Pallium India | date=29 November 2010 | accessdate=June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
Pain and Palliative Care Society, Kozhikode, has been chosen for a 'Person of the Year 2007' award by [[Indiavision]], a Kerala-based Malayalam television channel.&lt;ref name="Award and involving the community in the provision of palliative care"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pallcare.ru/en/?p=1201886110 | title=Award and involving the community in the provision of palliative care | publisher=Pallcare | date=2016 | accessdate=June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The honour is usually awarded to an outstanding individual. However this year the jury, headed by the distinguished writer [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], was unanimous in selecting Pain and Palliative Care Society (PPCS).&lt;ref name="Announcements"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hospicecare.com/news/08/01/announce.html | title=Announcements | publisher=Hospice Care | date=November 2008 | accessdate=June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This award was received by Dr Suresh Kumar, Mr. P. K. Ashok Kumar and Dr. [[M. R. Rajagopal]], co-founders of PPCS along with Mr. T. Balan Nair, the present secretary of PPCS at a function in Thiruvananthapuram.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The '''Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine''' (IPEM) is the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[British professional bodies|professional body]] and [[learned society]] for [[physicist]]s, [[engineer]]s and technologists within the field of [[medicine]], founded in 1995, changing its name from the '''Institution of Physics and Engineering in Medicine and Biology''' (IPEMB) in 1997.&lt;ref name="Jennings2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Jennings |first= Allan|date=December 2006|title= Introduction|journal= Scope|volume= 15|issue= Heritage Supplement|pages= 2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is governed by an elected Board of Trustees reporting to which are the Science, Research and Innovation Council and the Professional and Standards Council. The councils have operational responsibility for scientific and professional aspects of the Institute's work, respectively. Beneath the councils is a substructure of committees, groups and panels of members, which undertake the work of the Institute.

The Institute is licensed by the [[Engineering Council UK|Engineering Council]] to register [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineers]], Incorporated Engineers and Engineering Technologists and by the [[Science Council]] to register [[Chartered Scientist]]s,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charteredscientist.org&lt;/ref&gt; Registered Scientists and Registered Science Technicians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencecouncil.org/professional_registers&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the Institute and its members, set out in its charitable objects and articles of association, is to promote for the public benefit the advancement of physics and engineering applied to medicine and biology, and to advance public education in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=IPEM |year=2013 |title=2012 A Review of the Year |format=pdf |url=http://www.ipem.ac.uk/Portals/0/Images/2012%20Annual%20Review.pdf |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The organization can trace its origin to three societies:&lt;ref name="Jennings2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReynardAslib2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=K. Reynard|title=Aslib Directory of Information Sources in the United Kingdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hy5F6O18yrAC&amp;pg=PA646 |accessdate=7 January 2013|year=2003|publisher=Aslib|isbn=978-0-85142-472-9|page=646}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kolitsi2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zoi Kolitsi|editor=Zoi Kolitsi|title=Towards a European Framework for Education and Training in Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zt5zK69hsR8C&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=7 January 2013|year=2001|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=978-1-58603-151-0|page=12|chapter=Introduction|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the '''Hospital Physicists Association''' (HPA) founded in 1943,
*the '''Hospital Physics Technicians  Association''' (HPTA) founded in 1952, and
*the '''Biological Engineering Society''' (BES) founded in 1960.

The HPA created its scientific arm in 1984, the '''Institute of Physical Sciences in Medicine''' (IPSM). The trade union and scientific activities split in 1989: the scientific arm merged with the BES to form IPEMB while the trade union (HPA) joined the [[Manufacturing, Science and Finance]] Trades Union (MSF).&lt;ref name="Jennings2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kolitsi2001"/&gt;
The  '''Association of Medical Technologists''' (AMT), formerly HPTA, merged with IPEM in 2001.&lt;ref name="Jennings2006" /&gt;

==Annual Conference and Woolmer Lecture==
The Institute holds an annual conference on Medical Physics and Engineering. During this conference the flagship lecture of the Institute, the [[Woolmer Lecture]], is presented. The lecture is dedicated to Professor Ronald Woolmer who was the first Director of the Research Department of Anaesthetics at the [[Royal College of Surgeons]].&lt;ref name="ObitWoolmer63"&gt;{{cite journal |last= G.S.W.O|date=February 1963|title= In Memoriam: Professor R. F. Woolmer, V.R.D.|journal=  Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England |volume= 332|issue= 1|pages= 129–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woolmer convened a meeting at the Royal College of Surgeons, London, to discuss the evolving field of engineering applied to medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=April–June 1963|title= Prof. R. F. Woolmer, 1908–1962|journal= Medical electronics and biological engineering |volume= 2|issue= 1|pages= 161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was agreed that the group should hold regular meetings and as a result the Biological Engineering Society (BES) was formed with Ronald Woolmer as the first President. Woolmer died two years after the formation of the BES and it was agreed that a memorial lecture would be sponsored in recognition of his achievements.&lt;br&gt;

'''Intraocular lens''' ('''IOL''') is a [[lens (optics)|lens]] implanted in the [[human eye|eye]] as part of a treatment for [[cataracts]] or [[myopia]]. The most common type of IOL is the pseudophakic IOL. These are implanted during [[cataract surgery]], after the cloudy [[lens (anatomy)|eye's natural lens]] (colloquially called a cataract) has been removed. The pseudophakic IOL provides the same light focusing function as the natural [[crystalline]] lens. The second type of IOL, more commonly known as a [[phakic intraocular lens|phakic intraocular lens (PIOL)]], is a lens which is placed over the existing natural lens and is used in [[refractive surgery]] to change the eye's [[optical power]] as a treatment for myopia ([[nearsightedness]]).&lt;ref name=pmid21029908&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2010.08.014 |title=Phakic intraocular lenses |year=2010 |last1=Güell |first1=Jose Luis |last2=Morral |first2=Merce |last3=Kook |first3=Daniel |last4=Kohnen |first4=Thomas |journal=Journal of Cataract &amp; Refractive Surgery |volume=36 |issue=11 |pages=1976–1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IOLs usually consist of a small plastic lens with plastic side struts, called haptics, to hold the lens in place in the capsular bag inside the eye.&lt;ref name=pmid17172886&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/ICO.0b013e31802cbf3c |title=Comparison of Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL) and Laser-assisted in Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) for Low Myopia |year=2006 |last1=Sanders |first1=Donald |last2=Vukich |first2=John A |journal=Cornea |volume=25 |issue=10 |pages=1139–46 |pmid=17172886}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOLs were conventionally made of an inflexible material ([[Polymethyl methacrylate|PMMA]]), although this has largely been superseded by the use of flexible materials.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}} Most IOLs fitted today are fixed monofocal lenses matched to distance vision. However, other types are available, such as [[Multifocal intraocular lens|multifocal IOLs]] that provide the patient with multiple-focused vision at far and reading distance, and adaptive IOLs that provide the patient with limited visual accommodation.

Surgeons annually implant more than 6 million lenses.&lt;ref&gt;Gaudet, Jodie ed. 1001 Inventions That Changed the World, page 697, {{ISBN|978-0-7333-2536-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure can be done under local anesthesia with the patient awake throughout the operation. The use of a flexible IOL enables the lens to be rolled for insertion into the capsule through a very small incision, thus avoiding the need for stitches. This procedure usually takes less than 30 minutes in the hands of an experienced [[ophthalmologist]]. The recovery period is about 2–3 weeks. After surgery, patients should avoid strenuous exercise or anything else that significantly increases blood pressure. They should visit their ophthalmologists regularly for several months to monitor the implants.

IOL implantation carries several risks associated with eye surgeries, such as infection, loosening of the lens, lens rotation, inflammation and nighttime halos, but a systematic review of studies has determined that the procedure is safer than conventional laser eye treatment.&lt;ref name=Barsam2014 /&gt; Though IOLs enable many patients to have reduced dependence on glasses, most patients still rely on glasses for certain activities, such as reading.

==Medical uses==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
Intraocular lenses have been used since 1999 for correcting larger errors in [[myopic|near-sighted]], [[hyperopic|far-sighted]], and [[Astigmatism (eye)|astigmatic]] eyes. This type of IOL is also called [[phakic intraocular lens]] (PIOL), and the crystalline lens is not removed.

Phakic IOL appear to be less dangerous than excimer laser surgery in those with significant nearsightedness.&lt;ref name=Barsam2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barsam|first1=A|last2=Allan|first2=BD|title=Excimer laser refractive surgery versus phakic intraocular lenses for the correction of moderate to high myopia.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=17 June 2014|volume=6|pages=CD007679|pmid=24937100|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007679.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More commonly, aphakic IOLs (that is, not PIOLs) are implanted via clear lens extraction and replacement (CLEAR) surgery. During CLEAR, the crystalline lens is extracted and an IOL replaces it in a process that is very similar to cataract surgery: both involve lens replacement, local anesthesia, last approximately 30 minutes, and require making a small incision in the eye for lens insertion. People recover from CLEAR surgery 1–7 days after the operation. During this time, they should avoid strenuous exercise or anything else that significantly raises blood pressure. They should visit their ophthalmologists regularly for several months to monitor the IOL implants.

CLEAR has a 90% success rate (risks include wound leakage, infection, inflammation, and astigmatism). CLEAR can be performed only on patients ages 40 and older. This is to ensure that eye growth, which disrupts IOL lenses, will not occur post-surgery.

Once implanted, IOL lenses have three major benefits. First, they are an alternative to [[LASIK]], a form of eye surgery that does not work for people with serious vision problems. Effective IOL implants also entirely eliminate the need for glasses or contact lenses post-surgery for most patients.&lt;ref name="Zamora" /&gt; The cataract will not return, as the lens has been removed. The disadvantage is that the eye's ability to change focus (accommodate) has generally been reduced or eliminated, depending on the kind of lens implanted.

Some of the risks that FDA have been found so far during a three-year study of the Artisan are:
* a yearly loss of 1.8% of the [[endothelial cell]]s,
* 0.6% risk of [[retinal detachment]],
* 0.6% risk of [[cataract]] (other studies have shown a risk of 0.5 – 1.0%), and
* 0.4% risk of corneal swelling.

Other risks include:
* 0.03–0.05% eye infection risk, which in worst case can lead to blindness. This risk exists in all eye surgery procedures and is not unique for IOLs.
* [[glaucoma]],
* [[Astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]],
* remaining near or far sightedness,
* rotation of the lens inside the eye one or two days after surgery.

One of the causes of the risks above is that the lens can rotate inside the eye if the PIOL is too short, if the eye was incorrectly measured, or because the [[Sulcus (anatomy)|sulcus]] has a slightly oval shape (the height is slightly smaller than the width). Toric IOLs must be powered and aligned inside the eye on a meridian that corrects the patient's preexisting astigmatism. Again, these lenses can rotate inside the eye postoperatively or be placed incorrectly by the operating surgeon. Either way, the patient's preexisting astigmatism may not be corrected completely or may even increase.

When IOLs are implanted in the aphakic patient—either after clear lensectomy for the correction of refractive error or after cataract extraction to restore eyesight—astigmatism in these patients is mainly attributable to the [[cornea]]. The surgeon can ascertain the astigmatic, or steepest, meridian in a number of ways, including manifest refraction or [[corneal topography]]. Manifest refraction is the familiar test where the eye doctor rotates lenses in front of the eye, asking the patient, "Which is better (or clearer), this one or this one?" Corneal topography is considered a more quantitative test, and for purposes of aligning a toric IOL, most surgeons use a measurement called simulated keratometry (SimK), which is calculated by the internal programming of the corneal topography machine, to determine the astigmatic meridian on the surface of the cornea. The astigmatic meridian can also be identified using corneal wavefront technology or paraxial curvature matching.

==Accommodating IOLs==
One of the major disadvantages of conventional IOLs is that they are primarily focused for distance vision. Though patients who undergo a standard IOL implantation no longer experience clouding from [[cataracts]], they are unable to [[Accommodation (eye)|accommodate]], or change focus from near to far, far to near, and to distances in between. Accommodating IOLs interact with [[ciliary muscle]]s and [[zonules]], using hinges at both ends to “latch on” and move forward and backward inside the eye using the same mechanism as normal accommodation. These IOLs have a 4.5-mm square-edged optic and a long hinged plate design with polyimide loops at the end of the haptics. The hinges are made of an advanced [[silicone]] called BioSil that was thoroughly tested to make sure it was capable of unlimited flexing in the eye.&lt;ref&gt;Slade, Stephen. "Accommodating IOLs: Design, Technique, Results." Review of Ophthalmology. 2005. 20 Mar 2009. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revophth.com/index.asp?page=1_751.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017074609/http://www.revophth.com/index.asp?page=1_751.htm |archivedate=17 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
[[File:Intraocular-lens-in-holder.jpg|thumb|Acrylic MICS-IOL in holder]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
{{Expand section|reorganization, clarifications, better differentiation between the practices of different countries, and specific differences between [[Acrylic glass|PMMA]], silicone, and silicone acrylate|date=January 2008}}
The materials that have been used to manufacture intraocular lens implants include polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), silicone, hydrophobic acrylate, hydrophilic acrylate and collamer.&lt;ref&gt;Belluci R. An Introduction to Intraocular Lenses: Material, Optics, Haptics, Design and Aberration. In: Güell JL (ed): Cataract. ESASO Course Series. Basel, Karger, 2013, vol 3, pp 38–55&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) was the first material to be used successfully in intraocular lenses. British ophthalmologist [[Harold Ridley (ophthalmologist)|Sir Harold Ridley]] observed that [[Royal Air Force]] pilots who sustained [[eye injury|eye injuries]] during [[World War II]] involving PMMA windshield material did not show any rejection or [[foreign body]] reaction. Deducing that the transparent material was inert and useful for implantation in the eye, Ridley designed and implanted the first intraocular lens in a human eye.

Advances in technology have brought about the use of [[silicone]] and [[acrylic glass|acrylic]], both of which are soft foldable inert materials. This allows the lens to be folded and inserted into the eye through a smaller incision. Specifically, acrylic lenses are a better choice in people who have a history of [[uveitis]] or are likely to have to undergo retinal surgery requiring [[vitrectomy]] with replacement by silicone oil, such as persons with proliferative [[diabetic retinopathy]] or who are at high risk of [[retinal detachment]], such as persons with high [[myopia]]. A study found that in participants with a history of uveitis, eyes treated with hydrophobic acrylic IOLs were over 2 times more likely to have a best corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or more, compared to eyes treated with silicone IOLs.&lt;ref name="Alio"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Alio JL, Chipont E, BenEzra D, Fakhry MA, International ocular Inflammation Society, Study Group of Uveitic Cataract Surgery |title= Comparative performance of intraocular lenses in eyes with cataract and uveitis |journal=Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery |volume=28 |issue=12 |pages= 2096–2108 |date=2002 |pmid= 12498843 |doi=10.1016/s0886-3350(02)01452-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leung"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Leung TG, Lindsley K, Kuo IC |title= Types of intraocular lenses for cataract surgery in eyes with uveitis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages= CD007284 |date=2014 |pmid= 24590672|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD007284.pub2 |pmc=4261623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trademarked "Natural Yellow" material is available in three hydrophilic IOLs. Dr. Patrick H. Benz of Benz Research and Development created the first IOL material to incorporate the same UV-A blocking and violet light filtering [[chromophore]] that's present in the human crystalline lens. This breakthrough material provides the exact [[chromophore]] the human retina naturally has for light protection.

Other IOLs include:
* Blue light filtering IOLs filter the UV and high-energy blue light present in natural and artificial light, both of which can cause vision problems{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}; however too much filtering of blue light can increase depression, especially in the winter months ([[Seasonal affective disorder|SAD]]).
* [[Toric lens|Toric]] IOLs (1998) correct astigmatic vision.

== Types == &lt;!--Phakic redirects here--&gt;
[[File:Posterior capsular opacification on retroillumination.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Slit lamp]] photo of Pseudophakia: Posterior chamber Intraocular lens – note that Posterior capsular opacification is visible a few months after implantation of Intraocular lens in eye, as seen on retroillumination]]
* ''Phakia'' is the presence of the natural crystalline lenses.
* [[Aphakia]] is the absence of the natural crystalline lens. The aphakic state is usually due to surgery to remove a cataractous lens, but post-surgical aphakia is rare nowadays because of the ubiquity of intraocular lenses. Rarely, aphakia can be post-traumatic or congenital in nature.
* ''Pseudophakia'' is the substitution of the natural crystalline lens with an IOL, as is often done after cataract extraction or to correct refractive error.

The root of these words comes from the Greek word ''phakos'' 'lens'.&lt;ref name=yanoff&gt;{{cite book|author1=Myron Yanoff |author2=Jay S. Duker |title=Ophthalmology|year=2009|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|isbn=978-0-323-04332-8|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phakic IOLs are implanted without removal of the patient's original crystalline lens, and this is performed solely to correct refractive error in the presence of a clear crystalline lens.

Aphakic IOLs generally refer to lenses implanted secondarily in an eye already aphakic from previous surgery or trauma some time ago.

Pseudophakic IOLs refer to lenses implanted during cataract surgery, as a sequential step after removal of the cataractous lens of the person.

Many aphakic and pseudophakic IOLs such as anterior chamber IOLs or 3 piece posterior chamber IOLs can be used interchangeably. The exception are one piece IOLs, which must be placed within the capsular bag at the time of cataract surgery and hence cannot be used as secondary implants.

===PIOLs===
As with IOLs inserted after [[Cataract surgery|cataract extraction]], [[Phakic intraocular lens|phakic IOLs]] (PIOLs) can be spheric or toric. The difference is that they are placed in an eye that retains the natural human crystalline lens. As with aphakic eyes, toric PIOLs have to be aligned with the meridian of astigmatism; toric IOL misalignment or rotation can lead to residual or even greater astigmatism postoperatively.

Depending on their placement site in the eye, PIOLs can be divided into:&lt;ref name=yanoff /&gt;
* Angle-supported PIOLs: those IOLs are placed in the anterior chamber. They are notorious for their negative impact on the corneal endothelial lining, which is vital for maintaining a healthy clear cornea.
* Iris-supported PIOLs: The IOL is attached by claws to the mid-peripheral iris by a technique called enclavation. It is believed to have a lesser effect on corneal endothelium. The main complication with this type is their tendency to cause endothelial cell reduction.
* [[Implantable Collamer Lens|Sulcus-supported PIOLs]]: this type is gaining more and more popularity. These IOLs are placed in the posterior chamber in front of the natural crystalline lens. They have special vaulting so as not to be in contact with the normal lens. The main complication with older versions was a small possibility of cataract formation.

===Toric IOLs===
A toric IOL is a type of [[toric lens]] used to correct preexisting [[cornea]]l [[astigmatism]] at the time of [[cataract surgery]]. This astigmatism can also be treated with [[limbal relaxing incisions]] or an [[LASIK|excimer laser]] procedure.&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;Boyd, K.{{cite web|url=https://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/cataracts-iol-implants |title=IOL Implants: Lens Replacement and Cataract Surgery |publisher=American Academy of Ophthalmology |date=16 Nov 2016 |accessdate=2 Jun 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heiting&gt;Heiting, G.{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutvision.com/conditions/toric-iols.htm |title=Astigmatism and Cataract? A Toric IOL Can Fix Both |publisher=AllAboutVision.com |date=Sep 2016 |accessdate=2 Jun 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 40% of Americans have significant astigmatism and thus may be candidates for a toric IOL.&lt;ref name=Heiting /&gt;
 
[[Cataract surgery]] with implantation of a toric IOL is essentially the same as cataract surgery with a conventional IOL. Like toric [[contact lens]]es, toric IOLs have different powers in different meridians of the lens, and they must be positioned on the correct meridian to reverse the preexisting astigmatism. If the toric IOL is not on the correct meridian, it may need to be repositioned in a second procedure.&lt;ref name=Heiting /&gt;

==Pseudophakic IOLs that address presbyopia==
In the United States, a new category of intraocular lenses was opened with the approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 2003 of multifocal and accommodating lenses. These come at an additional cost to the recipient beyond what Medicare will pay and each has advantages and disadvantages.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Multifocal IOLs provide for simultaneous viewing of distance vision and near vision. Trifocal IOLs can provide intermediate vision.&lt;ref name="Zamora"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Zamora-De la Cruz D, Garzón M, Pulido-London D, Jimenez-Corona A, Zúñiga-Posselt M, Bartlett J, Gutierrez M, Chavez-Mondragón E |title= Trifocal intraocular lenses versus bifocal intraocular lenses after cataract extraction |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=5 |pages= CD012648 |date=2017 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD012648}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common adverse visual effects from multifocal IOLs include glare, halos, and a loss of contrast sensitivity, in low light conditions.&lt;ref name="Carson"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Carson D, Hill WE, Hong X, Karakelle M |title= Optical bench performance of AcrySof(®) IQ ReSTOR(®), AT LISA(®) tri, and FineVision(®) intraocular lenses |journal=Clin Ophthalmol |volume=8 |pages= 2105–2113 |date=2014 |pmid= 25342881 |doi=10.2147/OPTH.S66760 |pmc=4206402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monofocal lenses are standard lenses used in cataract surgery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; People who have a multifocal intraocular lens after their cataract is removed may be less likely to need additional glasses compared with people who have standard monofocal lenses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, people receiving multifocal lenses may experience more visual problems, such as glare or haloes (rings around lights), than with monofocal lenses.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Silva|first=Samantha R.|last2=Evans|first2=Jennifer R.|last3=Kirthi|first3=Varo|last4=Ziaei|first4=Mohammed|last5=Leyland|first5=Martin|date=12 December 2016|title=Multifocal versus monofocal intraocular lenses after cataract extraction|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=12|pages=CD003169|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003169.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=27943250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People receiving accommodative intraocular lenses had improvements in near vision but these improvements were small and reduced over time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; People who received accommodative intraocular lenses may have a higher risk of thickening and clouding of the tissue behind the intraocular lenses (posterior capsule opacification) but there is some uncertainty around this finding.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ong|first=Hon Shing|last2=Evans|first2=Jennifer R.|last3=Allan|first3=Bruce D.

==History==
[[File:Plaque for Harold Ridley's first intraocular lens at St Thomas' Hospital.jpg|thumb|right|150px|First permanent insertion of intraocular lens 8 February 1950]]
[[Harold Ridley (ophthalmologist)|Sir Harold Ridley]] was the first to successfully implant an intraocular lens on 29 November 1949, at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] at London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1724118/pdf/v085p01022.pdf|title = Sir Harold Ridley’s vision|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Ophthalmol|first = J. |pmc=1724118 |pmid=11520745 |volume=85 |year=2001 |journal=Br J Ophthalmol |pages=1022–3 |doi=10.1136/bjo.85.9.1022}}&lt;/ref&gt; That lens was manufactured by the [[Rayner (company)|Rayner]] company of Brighton, East Sussex, England from [[Perspex CQ]] [[polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) made by ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries). It is said the idea of implanting an intraocular lens came to him after an intern asked him why he was not replacing the lens he had removed during cataract surgery. The acrylic plastic material was chosen because Ridley noticed it was inert after seeing RAF (Royal Air Force) pilots of World War II with pieces of shattered canopies in their eyes (this acrylic resin is known by several trade names including [[Lucite]] and [[Plexiglas]]).

The intraocular lens did not find widespread acceptance in cataract surgery until the 1970s, when further developments in lens design and surgical techniques had come about.

As of the early 2000s, more than a million IOLs were implanted annually in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} That number was estimated by the [[World Health Organization]] to have increased to 20 million annually worldwide by 2010 (for cataract surgery), and has projected increased IOL surgeries to reach 32 million worldwide by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Global Intraocular Lens Market is Forecast to Reach $3.1 Billion b {{!}} ASDReports|url = https://www.asdreports.com/news-275/global-intraocular-lens-market-forecast-reach-31-billion-2017|website = www.asdreports.com|accessdate = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lake Malta''', known also as the Maltański Reservoir,&lt;ref name=Goldyn&gt;Gołdyn R., Kozak A., Kostka K. 1994. Causes of changes in the water quality of the restored Maltański Reservoir in Poznań. In: Gołdyn R. (ed.) Protection of the water of the catchment area of the river Cybina. Poznań: Poznańskie Towarzystwo Przyjaciół Nauk (PTPN), pp. 33-58.&lt;/ref&gt; is an artificial [[lake]] in [[Poznań]], [[Poland]].  It was formed in 1952 as a result of the [[dam]]ming of the [[Cybina]] River.  It is about 2.2&amp;nbsp;km long, which makes the lake the biggest man-made lake of the city. The water is 3.1 m deep on average with a maximum about 5 m.  There are a number of recreational attractions along the edge of the lake including:
*an artificial [[ski]] slope,
*an artificial [[ice rink]],
*a [[zoological garden]],
*[[Kolejka Parkowa Maltanka]] - a [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] railway,
*the [[Mound]] of Freedom,
*seasonal bikes rental - MaltaBike

The lake also has one of the oldest man-made [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] venues in Europe - ''The Malta Regatta Course''.  This dates back to 1952 and has held a number of [[Rowing World Cup]] events. It also hosted the [[ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships]] in [[1990 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships|1990]] and [[2001 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships|2001]], and did so again in [[2010 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships|2010]].

The lake also gives its name to the Malta theatre festival, held in Poznań annually in June, with some of the shows taking place next to the lake.

The name of the lake comes from the [[Knights Hospitaller]] also known as ''Knights of Malta''. The lake was built on land owned by [[Church of St. John of Jerusalem Outside the Walls]], given to the order in 1187 by duke [[Mieszko III the Old]].

Because of the importance of the lake for the city of Poznań, various methods to improve its water quality have been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Gołdyn R. (ed.) Protection of the water of the catchment area of the river Cybina. Poznań: Poznańskie Towarzystwo Przyjaciół Nauk (PTPN).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2680">'''List of criminal competencies''' is a listing of the various types of competencies relevant to the defendant in [[criminal law]] in the  [[United States]]. In the U.S. the  law is permeated with competency issues since a state may not subject an individual who is "incompetent" to trial on criminal charges. In insisting on this requirement the law is acting on the premise that society recognizes only the actions of an autonomous individual. This is a list of the most relevant competencies that must be evaluated (if a question of incompetency is raised) in order to proceed.&lt;ref name="melton1997"&gt;{{cite book

'''MedShare''' is a national non-profit organization that recovers surplus medical supplies and equipment from U.S. hospitals and manufacturers, and redistributes them to needy hospitals in developing countries.

==About==
Founded in 1998, MedShare's mission is "to bridge the gap between surplus and need through the efficient recovery and redistribution of [[surplus medical supplies]] and equipment to those in need." MedShare collects surplus medical supplies and used equipment from U.S. hospitals, manufacturers and distributors. They process these donated materials and make them available to under-served hospitals and clinics in two ways: direct shipments to international applicant institutions and supplying medical mission teams with commonly needed medical items.

MedShare is one of the leading medical supply recovery organizations in the United States with two distribution centers.  Its national headquarters and Southeastern distribution center is in [[Decatur, Georgia]], and its Western Region distribution center is in [[San Leandro, California]].  In 14 years of service, they have shipped over 750 forty-foot shipping containers of medical supplies and equipment valued at more than $100 million to needy health facilities in 88 countries around the world.

==History==
MedShare was founded in 1998 by A.B. Short, a nonprofit entrepreneur, and Bob Freeman, a retired businessman, after learning of the environmental threat imposed by hospitals and medical companies discarding thousands of tons of medical supplies and equipment, while underserved hospitals in developing countries were desperate for the most basic medical items.

Short and Freeman spent some time meeting with hospitals and medical professionals to find out if there was indeed a need for medical surplus supplies to be diverted from landfills.  During these meetings, not one hospital turned their medical surplus collection program down.  While performing their due diligence, they also learned of the importance of shipping medical supplies that the recipient needs, not simply shipping what they had, which led MedShare to employ a technology-based inventory system, where the qualified health recipient can custom-order the medical items for their shipment.

* 1999 – MedShare shipped their first 40-foot shipping container of medical supplies to Costa Rica.
* 2000 Woodruff Foundation awards their first major $250,000 grant

==Services and operations==
MedShare uses a variety of services to get recovered surplus medical supplies and equipment from U.S. hospitals and medical companies and to qualified health recipients abroad.

1) '''Medical Product Donations''' – MedShare collects hundreds of thousands of pounds of surplus medical supplies from both hospitals and medical companies.  They collect a weekly average of over 20,000 pounds of surplus medical supplies and equipment from both hospitals and medical companies.  MedShare only accepts unused medical supplies that have an expiration date of at least 12–18 months or more.  Biomedical equipment donations must be in working condition with the all the necessary accessories and operational manual included.  MedShare's biomedical engineers evaluate biomedical equipment donations to ensure they are in operable condition before they are sent to a health recipient abroad.

* '''Surplus Medical Recycling Program''' is a program for hospitals to donate their surplus medical supplies to MedShare.  Participating hospitals in Metro Atlanta and Northern California are periodically trained by MedShare staff on how the program works and what surplus medical supply donations are accepted.  Each hospital receives MedShare recycling barrels to place in designated hospital departments, and MedShare provides a regular pick-up service to collect the donated surplus supplies.
* '''Corporate Product Donations'''  About 65 percent of MedShare's product donations come from medical manufacturers and distributors.  Corporations often donate products that have cosmetically damaged packaging, production overages, usable returned products or simply to make a tax-deductible donation to a trusted humanitarian charity.
'''
2. '''Volunteers''' –  MedShare offers hands-on volunteer opportunities for people to help in getting vital medical supplies to needy health recipients abroad.  Each month, more than 1,500 volunteers serve at both the Southeastern and Western Distribution Centers to help sort and pack recovered surplus medical supplies.  There are different sorting levels where volunteers start with assorted donated medical supplies, and eventually sort them into boxes of individual medical items, such as a box of sutures and a box of surgical gloves and a box of surgical drapes.

3. '''Medical Product Shipments''' The main way MedShare distributes donated surplus medical supplies and equipment around the world is through customized 40-foot shipping containers.  They work with foreign governments, corporations, nonprofit organizations and individuals who wish to sponsor shipments of medical aid to specified recipient hospitals and clinics abroad.  Each sponsor must fill out an application detailing the needs of the recipient hospital and provide the necessary funding for the shipment.

4. '''MedShare Online Inventory'''  MedShare prides itself on its innovative use of technology to best use its resources and serve health recipients abroad.  Approved health recipients are able to custom-order the supplies needed for their facilities using an online inventory.  Once recovered surplus supplies have been sorted and packed by volunteers, they are entered into an online inventory database by MedShare staff.  The online inventory is refreshed every hour to reflect the most up-to-date items available for recipients to order.  Once a recipient's application is approved and funding in place, he/she is provided a personalized login to order the medical supplies for their 40-foot shipping container.  Because of limited availability of biomedical equipment, only medical supplies are listed on the online inventory. The health recipient must submit a written request to MedShare of any biomedical equipment needs.

5. '''Medical Mission Teams'''  MedShare also provides medical supplies to medical professionals traveling abroad on short term trips to provide medical treatment for those in need.  Medical teams must fill out an application detailing the nature of their medical trip and supply needs.  Once their application is approved, they can either set up an appointment to collect supplies at the MedTeam Store at either of our distribution centers in Decatur, GA or San Leandro, California.  MedShare asks for a $75 donation to collect up to 50 pounds of medical supplies from our MedTeam Store.  Teams needing more than 100 pounds of medical supplies can order from MedShare's online inventory.  If a medical mission team is unable to pick up the supplies at one of the distribution centers, the team can pay for MedShare to ship them the supplies they need.

==Funding==
MedShare is 100% reliant on philanthropic support from more than 4,000 corporations, foundations, and individuals to fund its operations and receives no government funding. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

MedShare is governed by a board of 19 diverse{{clarify|date=February 2014}} and distinguished{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} corporate, community and healthcare industry leaders.  100% of board members participate in annual and capital fund-raising campaigns at a personally sacrificial level. Throughout its 14-year history, MedShare has been spending on average less than four percent of total revenues on administration and fund-raising expenses.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Organizational structure==
MedShare is a U.S. nonprofit organization with an international mission that is overseen by a Board of Trustees that serves as MedShare's governing body, responsible for the fiduciary, strategic and generative oversight and direction of the organization. Board members support 100% of the organization's annual and capital fundraising campaigns. Members serve without compensation, and meet once a quarter.  The current Chairman of the Board of Trustees is James E. Arnett.

MedShare's national staff consists of 37 people, with 5 executive officers.

'''Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy''' (MNTI) is a very rare [[oral cavity]] [[tumor]] that is seen in patients usually at or around [[birth]]. It must be removed to be cured.Definitions:  A rare, [[biphasic disease|biphasic]], [[neuroblastic]], and [[pigment]]ed [[epithelial]] [[neoplasm]] of [[craniofacial]] sites, usually involving the oral cavity or [[gums]].

==Signs and symptoms ==
Most patients present with a very rapidly growing mass that often gives a bluish appearance in the mouth. This is because the [[pigmentation]] in the cells appears blue through the overlying epithelium (mucosa).&lt;ref name="Selim"/&gt; By imaging studies, there is usually a large expansive [[radiolucent]] (clear) mass without well defined borders. [[Calcification]]s within the mass may be seen.&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt; More than 70% involve the [[maxilla]] (usually maxillary anterior alveolar ridge), while the [[mandible]] and skull are affected less often.&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt; There is often an elevated vanilmandelic acid level.&lt;ref name="Selim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marston"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors  =Marston AP, Black A, Pambuccian SE, Hamlar DD |date=July 2014 |title=Mass originating from the maxillary alveolar crest in an infant |journal=JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg |pmid=24810545 |doi=10.1001/jamaoto.2014.632 |volume=140 |pages=667–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaiger de Oliveira"/&gt;

== Pathogenesis ==
It is considered to be a [[developmental]] anomaly, and thus is [[congenital]] in presentation. It is thought to be derived from [[neural crest]], which is one of the embryologic tissue types. The reason for this postulation is based on the expression of [[melanotransferrin]] (melanoma-specific peptide that may play role in [[iron metabolism]]).&lt;ref name="Selim"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Selim H, Shaheen S, Barakat K, Selim AA |date=June 2008 |title=Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy: review of literature and case report |journal=J Pediatr Surg |pmid=18558161 |doi=10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2008.02.068 |volume=43 |pages=E25–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Nelson BL, Thompson LD |date=June 2006 |title=Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy |journal=Ear Nose Throat J |pmid=16866106 |volume=85 |pages=365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaiger de Oliveira"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Gaiger de Oliveira M, Thompson LD, Chaves AC, Rados PV, da Silva Lauxen I, Filho MS |date=August 2004 |title=Management of melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy |journal=Ann Diagn Pathol |pmid=15290671 |volume=8 |pages=207–12 |doi=10.1053/j.anndiagpath.2004.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis==

=== Macroscopic ===
Usually there is a smooth, firm mass, with mottled white-gray to blue-black cut surfaces. The overall size ranges from 1–10&amp;nbsp;cm with a mean size 3.5&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="Selim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt;

=== Microscopic ===
The tumor is usually very well [[circumscribed]] but not encapsulated. There are two cell types present (biphasic), arranged in alveolar or tubular configurations.[[File:Oral melanotic neuroectodermal tumor infancy LDRT 369 13.tif|thumb|A high power of melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy showing pigmented large epithelioid cells and smaller primitive cells (hematoxylin and eosin stain).]] There are centrally located, small, darkly staining cells comprising the majority of cells. These cells have a fibrillary cytoplasm surrounding round nuclei with coarse and heavy [[Chromatin|nuclear chromatin]]. These cells are surrounded by much larger polygonal cells that have open nuclear chromatin and abundant opaque cytoplasm that has granular [[Melanin|melanin pigment]].[[File:Oral melanotic neuroectodermal tumor infancy LDRT 369 08.tif|thumb|A high power of melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy showing pigmented large epithelioid cells and smaller primitive cells in alveolar nests (hematoxylin and eosin stain).]] There is usually no hemorrhage, necrosis or increased mitoses.&lt;ref name="Selim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaiger de Oliveira"/&gt;

=== Immunohistochemistry ===
The lesional cells will show cross reactivity with several different families of [[immunohistochemistry]] markers (polyphenotype), including neural, melanocytic, and epithelial.
* Large tumor cells: [[Keratin]], [[vimentin]], [[HMB-45]], [[Neuron specific enolase|NSE]], [[CD57]]
* Small tumor cells: [[Synaptophysin]], [[Glial fibrillary acidic protein|GFAP]], NSE, CD57
* There is usually a variable expression of EMA and [[S100 protein]].&lt;ref name="Gaiger de Oliveira"/&gt;

=== Differential diagnoses ===
It is important in this age group to exclude other tumors that can have a similar appearance, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoma, Ewing sarcoma (primitive neuroectodermal tumor), or even a melanoma (although they are very very rare in infants).&lt;ref name="Selim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaiger de Oliveira"/&gt;

== Management  ==
Even though there is often a very dramatic and rapidly enlarging, destructive tumor, there is usually a benign clinical course after complete local excision (usually by partial maxillectomy) with clear or free surgical margins. In rare cases, chemotherapy may be used for recurrent or residual tumors. Overall, the outcome is good, although it is quite unpredictable, with about 30% of patients have a recurrence. In about 10% of cases, metastasis may be seen (lymph nodes, liver, bone and soft tissue).&lt;ref name="Selim"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="Gaiger de Oliveira"/&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
This tumor is exception, with fewer than 500 cases reported world wide. More than 95% of patients are less than 1 year of age at presentation, with about 80% less than 6 months. Females are affected more often than males (2:1).&lt;ref name="Selim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaiger de Oliveira"/&gt;

The '''Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS)''' is a four-part behavior rating scale designed to measure four types of aggressive behavior as witnessed in the past week.&lt;ref name=MOAS1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alderman|first1=N|last2=Knight|first2=C|last3=Morgan|first3=C|title=Use of a modified version of the Overt Aggression Scale in the measurement and assessment of aggressive behaviours following brain injury.|journal=Brain Injury|date=July 1997|volume=11|issue=7|pages=503–23|pmid=9210987|doi=10.1080/bij.11.7.503.523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each section consists of five questions, with the first section regarding verbal aggression, the second section focusing on aggression against property, the third section measuring autoaggression, and the fourth section concerning physical aggression. Respondents are asked to check whether each statement describes the child’s behavior over the previous week.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yudofsky|first1=SC|last2=Silver|first2=JM|last3=Jackson|first3=W|last4=Endicott|first4=J|last5=Williams|first5=D|title=The Overt Aggression Scale for the objective rating of verbal and physical aggression.|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|date=January 1986|volume=143|issue=1|pages=35–9|pmid=3942284|doi=10.1176/ajp.143.1.35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MOAS was originally intended for use by physicians in a clinical setting, but parents may also use it to track aggressive behaviors in their children over time. It is particularly helpful in assessing aggressive behaviors in patients with [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBIs). The scores of the scale have shown good [[reliability (research methods)|reliability]] and [[test validity|validity]] across multiple different study samples&lt;ref name="MOAS1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Risk ==
Frequent exposure to penetrating wounds by thorns or splinters is a risk factor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This risk can be reduced by disinfecting wounds and wearing shoes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Pathogenesis==
Mycetoma is caused by common [[saprotrophs]] found in the soil and on thorny shrubs in semi-desert climates.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/Disease_Search.php?lng=EN&amp;data_id=3539&amp;Disease_Disease_Search_diseaseGroup=mycetoma&amp;Disease_Disease_Search_diseaseType=Pat&amp;Disease(s)/group%20of%20diseases=Mycetoma&amp;title=Mycetoma&amp;search=Disease_Search_Simple|title=Orphanet: Mycetoma|last=RESERVED|first=INSERM US14 -- ALL RIGHTS|website=www.orpha.net|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common causative agents are:

* ''[[Madurella mycetomatis]]'' (fungus)
* ''[[Nocardia brasiliensis]]'' (bacteria)
* ''[[Actinomadure madura]]'' (bacteria)
* ''[[Streptomyces somaliensis]]'' (bacteria)
* ''[[Actinomadura pelletieri]]'' (bacteria)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Infection is caused as a result of localized skin trauma, such as stepping on a needle or wood splinter, or through a pre-existing wound.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The first visible symptom of mycetoma is a typically painless swelling beneath the skin; over several years, this will grow to a [[Nodule (medicine)|nodule]] (lump).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Affected people will experience massive swelling and hardening of the area, in addition to skin rupture and the formation of sinus tracts that discharge pus and grains filled with organisms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In many instances, the underlying bone is affected.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Some people with mycetoma will not experience pain or discomfort, while others will report itching and/or pain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
There are currently no rapid diagnostic tools for mycetoma.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mycetoma is diagnosed through microscopic examination of the grains in the nodule and by analysis of [[Cell culture|cultures]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since the bacterial form and the fungal form of mycetoma share similar features, diagnosis can be a challenge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Treatment==
While treatment will vary depending on the cause of the condition, it may include [[antibiotics]] or [[antifungal]] medication.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Actinomycetoma, the bacterial form, can be cured with antibiotics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Eumycetoma, the fungal form, is treated with antifungals and surgery.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For both forms, extended treatment is necessary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In cats, mycetoma can be treated with complete surgical removal. Antifungal drugs are rarely effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cat Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook|last=Eldredge|first=Debra M.|last2=Carlson|first2=Delbert G.|last3=Carlson|first3=Liisa D.|last4=Giffin|first4=James M.|publisher=Howell Book House|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PomBase''' is a [[model organism database]] that provides online access to the [[fission yeast]] [[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]] [[genome]] sequence and annotated features, together with a wide range of manually curated functional gene-specific data. The PomBase website was redeveloped in 2016 to provide users with a more fully integrated, better-performing service (described in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lock |first1=A |last2=Rutherford |first2=K |last3=Harris |first3=MA |last4=Hayles |first4=J |last5=Oliver |first5=SG |last6=Bähler |first6=J |last7=Wood |first7=V |title=PomBase 2018: user-driven reimplementation of the fission yeast database provides rapid and intuitive access to diverse, interconnected information. |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |date=13 October 2018 |doi=10.1093/nar/gky961 |pmid=30321395}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Data Organization ==
[[File:PomBase infographic.jpg|thumb|An overview of data provided by PomBase and ways to access it.]]
PomBase provides genome-wide datasets and gene-specific annotation. Genome-wide datasets (including protein datasets, all annotations, manually curated ortholog lists etc) can be accessed from the [https://www.pombase.org/datasets datasets] page. A genome browser (JBrowse instance) displays high-throughput datasets in the context of the genome sequence.

Gene annotation can be viewed either at a gene-specific level (on the gene pages) or at a term-specific level (on the ontology term pages). This makes it possible to either: 
* View all annotations created for gene Y
* View all genes annotated to term X

PomBase uses several biological ontologies to capture gene-specific information, including:
* [[Gene Ontology]] (GO) - used to describe the enzymatic functions, biological roles and cellular locations of gene products 
* Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO),&lt;ref name="PMID23658422"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Harris MA, Lock A, Bähler J, Oliver SG, Wood V | title = FYPO: The Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology |journal = [[Bioinformatics (journal)|Bioinformatics]]| volume = 29| issue = 13| pages = 1671–8|date= Jul 2013| pmid = 23658422| doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btt266 | issn = | pmc=3694669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used to associate phenotypes with alleles of genes, in comparison to the phenotype of the reference strain 
* [[Sequence Ontology]] - used to describe DNA or protein features 
* Protein modifications - using PSI-MOD

The [https://www.pombase.org/browse-curation/fission-yeast-go-slim-terms GO slim page] provides an overview of the biological role of all fission yeast genes. PomBase also maintains a list of [https://www.pombase.org/status/priority-unstudied-genes priority genes] - these are genes with orthologs in vertebrates, but where the biological role of the gene is unknown in any species, making them especially of interest for functional characterization.

== Data Input ==
To supplement the work of the small team of professional PomBase curators, fission yeast researchers contribute annotations directly to PomBase via an innovative community curation scheme, for which an online curation tool, Canto,&lt;ref name="PMID24574118"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rutherford KM, Harris MA, Lock A, Oliver SG, Wood V | title = Canto: an online tool for community literature curation.|journal = [[Bioinformatics (journal)|Bioinformatics]]| volume = 30| issue = 12| pages = 1791–2|date=Jun 2014| pmid = 24574118 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu103 | issn = | pmc=4058955}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been developed. Community curation is reviewed by PomBase staff, and this results in highly accurate, effectively co-curated, annotations.

== Documentation ==
Pombase provides both [https://www.pombase.org/documentation documentation] and an [https://www.pombase.org/faq FAQ].

Usage of PomBase as a research tool is explored in the "Eukaryotic Genomic Databases" (Methods and Protocols) book chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Lock |first1=A |last2=Rutherford |first2=K |last3=Harris |first3=MA |last4=Wood |first4=V |title=PomBase: The Scientific Resource for Fission Yeast |journal=Methods in Molecular Biology |date=2018 |volume=1757 |pages=49–68 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-7737-6_4 |pmid=29761456|series=Methods in Molecular Biology |isbn=978-1-4939-7736-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Developments and updates are described in the NAR Database Issue papers.&lt;ref name="pmid22039153"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wood V, Harris MA, McDowall MD, Rutherford K, Vaughan BW, Staines DM, Aslett M, Lock A, Bähler J, Kersey PJ, Oliver SG | title = PomBase: a comprehensive online resource for fission yeast| journal = [[Nucleic Acids Res.]]| volume = 40| issue = Database issue| pages = D695–9|date=Jan 2012| pmid = 22039153 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr853| issn = | pmc=3245111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25361970"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=McDowall MD, Harris MA, Lock A, Rutherford K, Staines DM, Bähler J, Kersey PJ, Oliver SG, Wood V | title = PomBase 2015: updates to the fission yeast database| journal = [[Nucleic Acids Res.]]| volume = 43| issue = Database issue| pages = D656–61|date=Jan 2015| pmid = 25361970 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gku1040| issn = | pmc=4383888}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a detailed overview of using [[S. pombe]] as a [[model organism]] see the genetics primer &lt;ref name="pmid26447128"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hoffman CS, Wood V, Fantes PA | title = An Ancient Yeast for Young Geneticists: A Primer on the ''Schizosaccharomyces pombe'' Model System|journal = [[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]| volume = 201| issue = 2| pages = 403–23|date=Oct 2015| pmid = 26447128 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.115.181503 | issn = | pmc=4596657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Roundabout PlayPump''' is a system that uses the energy created by children playing to operate a [[water pump]]. It is manufactured by the [[South Africa]]n company Roundabout Outdoor. It operates in a similar way to a [[windmill]]-driven water pump.

The PlayPump received heavy publicity and funding when first introduced, but has since been criticized for being too expensive, too complex to maintain or repair in low-resource settings, too reliant on child labor, and overall less effective than traditional handpumps. [[WaterAid]], one of the biggest water charities in the world, opposes the PlayPump for these reasons.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/24/africa-charity-water-pumps-roundabouts Africa's not-so-magic roundabout &amp;#124; Andrew Chambers &amp;#124; Comment is free &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Troubled Water"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/southernafrica904/video_index.html FRONTLINE/World &amp;#124; Southern Africa: Troubled Water &amp;#124; Synopsis And Video &amp;#124; PBS]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The PlayPump water system is a [[playground]] [[Roundabout (play)|merry-go-round]] attached to a water pump. The spinning motion pumps underground water into a 2,500-liter tank raised seven meters above ground. The water in the tank is easily dispensed by a [[tap (valve)|tap valve]]. According to the manufacturer the pump can raise up to 1400&amp;nbsp;liters of water per hour from a depth of 40&amp;nbsp;meters. Excess water is diverted below ground again.&lt;ref name="MediaClub"/&gt;

The storage tank has a four-sided advertising panel. Two sides are used to [[advertising|advertise]] products, thereby providing money for maintenance of the pump, and the other two sides are devoted to [[public health]] messages about topics like [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] prevention.&lt;ref name="MediaClub"/&gt;

==History==
The PlayPump was invented in South Africa by Ronnie Stuiver, a borehole driller and engineer, who exhibited it at an agricultural fair in 1989.&lt;ref name="MediaClub"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tapping into ingenuity|url=http://www.mediaclubsouthafrica.com/land-and-people/549-tapping-into-ingenuity010708|date=1 July 2008|accessdate=28 November 2014|publisher=Media Club South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trevor Field, an agricultural executive, saw the device at the fair and licensed it from Stuiver.&lt;ref name="WIPO"&gt;{{cite web|title=When Innovation Is Child's Play|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2009/02/article_0013.html|date=March 2009|accessdate=28 November 2014|publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Field installed the first two systems in [[KwaZulu-Natal]] province in South Africa in 1994, and began receiving media attention in 1999, when [[Nelson Mandela]] attended the opening of a school which had a PlayPump.&lt;ref name="MediaClub"/&gt;  In 2000, PlayPump received the [[World Bank Development Marketplace Award]],&lt;ref name="MediaClub"/&gt; and it became internationally prominent following a 2005 [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|PBS ''Frontline'']] report in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PlayPump not a Panacea for Africa’s Water Problems|url=http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2010/world/playpump-not-a-panacea-for-africas-water-problems/|date=24 July 2010|accessdate=28 November 2014|publisher=Circle of Blue}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At a 2006 [[Clinton Foundation#Clinton Global Initiative#CGI|Clinton Global Initiative]] ceremony, donors pledged $16.4 million to install more PlayPumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Problem With International Development - And A Plan to Fix It|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/120178/problem-international-development-and-plan-fix-it|publisher=New Republic|author=Michael Hobbes|date=17 November 2014|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2008, 1,000 PlayPumps had been installed, and Field set a goal of installing 4,000 by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PlayPumps International: Gaining User Buy-In|url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/phi/research/insights-series|accessdate=28 November 2014|date=April 2012|publisher=Stanford Graduate School of Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2009 PlayPumps International turned its inventory of uninstalled PlayPumps over to [[Water For People]], and stopped installing new PlayPumps in order to focus on maintenance of existing ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter from the CEO|publisher=PlayPumps International|date=27 October 2009|accessdate=28 November 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116160315/http://blog.playpumps.org/2009/10/27/ceo-letter/|archivedate=16 November 2009|url=http://blog.playpumps.org/2009/10/27/ceo-letter/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
''The Guardian'' calculated in 2009 that children would have to "play" for 27 hours every day to meet PlayPumps' stated targets of providing 2,500 people per pump with their daily water needs.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

In June 2010, PBS's ''Frontline/World'' aired an update about the failure of PlayPumps, particularly in Mozambique.&lt;ref name="Troubled Water"/&gt; Many older women, who were not consulted prior to the installation of the PlayPumps, found operating them to be difficult, especially when there were few children around. PlayPumps were also breaking down, with no way for villagers to make the expensive necessary repairs. A comprehensive report about these failures was released by UNICEF in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/southernafrica904/flash/pdf/unicef_pp_report.pdf Please note that page 9 of the report is missing at this link.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russell Michael Howarth''' (born 27 March 1982) is an English former professional [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]].

Howarth started his career in the youth system of hometown club [[York City F.C.|York City]] in 1996 while a schoolboy, before becoming a trainee in 1998. He made his first-team debut aged 17, playing in the first six matches of the 1999–2000 season. During this run in the team, he signed a professional contract with the club. However, he was unable to play regularly for York because of the form of [[Bobby Mimms]] and [[Alan Fettis]]. After having trials with [[Premier League]] and [[Football League First Division|First Division]] clubs, Howarth left York in November 2002 to sign for [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] for a five-figure fee. Here, he again played sporadically, only having runs in the team when first-choice goalkeeper [[John Achterberg]] was unavailable. After being released by Tranmere in 2005, Howarth signed for [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]]. However, he was unable to dislodge [[Donovan Ricketts]] in goal and was released in 2007. He retired from football and started working as a paramedic.

While at York, Howarth played for England at a number of youth levels. He was [[Cap (sport)|capped]] twice at [[England national under-16 football team|under-16]] level in 1999, while still a trainee at York. He competed with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'s [[Rhys Evans]] for a starting place in the [[England national under-18 football team|under-18]] team, playing for them in [[2001 UEFA European Under-18 Championship]] qualifying. After making four under-18 appearances from 2000 to 2001, he progressed to the [[England national under-20 football team|under-20]] team, competing with Evans, [[Stephen Bywater]] and [[Boaz Myhill]] for a place in the team. He was capped four times for the team from 2001 to 2002 before being given a late call-up to the [[England national under-21 football team|under-21]] squad for the [[2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]]. He was still included in under-21 squads after moving to Tranmere, but failed to be capped at that level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13379">'''Tobacco smoking in the United Kingdom''' is prevalent among a sizeable, but continuously reducing minority of the population. Smoking is legally permitted, with certain conditions upon location arising from the [[List of smoking bans#United Kingdom|bans]] enacted separately in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It has been argued that smoking puts considerable strain upon the [[National Health Service|NHS]] due to the [[Health problems of smoking|health problems]] which can be directly linked with smoking. Successive UK Governments have endeavoured to reduce the prevalence of smoking. As part of this commitment, the NHS currently offers free help to smokers who want to quit.

==Prevalence==

As recently as 1974, 45% of the British population smoked. This was down to 30% by the early-1990s, 21% by 2010, and 19.3% by 2013; the lowest level recorded for eighty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Ministers aim to halve number of people smoking by 2020 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8490490.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=1 February 2010 |accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An annual [[No Smoking Day]] has occurred in March since 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stoddard |first=Katy |date=14 March 2012 |title=When No Smoking Day was still big news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2012/mar/14/archive-no-smoking-day |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, it was reported smoking rates in England had fallen to just 16.9%; a record low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37406105|title=Smoking rates in England fall to lowest on record|date=20 September 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health issues==
It has been estimated by Cancer Research UK that smoking is the single greatest cause of preventable illness and early death, with around 107,000 people dying in 2007 from smoking-related diseases including cancers in the UK. Around 86% of lung cancer deaths in the UK are caused by tobacco smoking and overall tobacco smoking is estimated to be responsible for more than a quarter of cancer deaths in the UK, around 43,000 deaths in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/types/lung/smoking/ |title=Smoking |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=[[Cancer Research UK]] |accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Medical Journal]] states that due to the drive to help smokers quit smoking, Britain has the world's largest reduction in the number of deaths from lung cancer.  Previously in 1950, the UK had one of the highest rates in the world. The annual number of deaths from lung cancer in 2000 was half of what it was in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Perry |first=Keith |date=3 August 2000 |title=Cancer warning halves deaths due to smoking |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/aug/03/smoking.keithperry |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reducing the prevalence of smoking to 5% could avoid nearly 100,000 new cases of smoking-related disease including 35,900 cancers over twenty years and save £67,000,000 a year in health and social care costs according to research commissioned by [[Cancer Research UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cutting smoking rates could save the NHS and social care £67m a year|url=http://healthcareleadernews.com/article/cutting-smoking-rates-could-save-nhs-and-social-care-£67m-year|accessdate=3 June 2017|publisher=Healthcare Leader|date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age restrictions==

===England and Wales===

Until 1 October 2007, the minimum age to purchase and consume tobacco products in public was 16 years of age. From 1 October 2007 the [[Children and Young Persons (Sale of Tobacco etc.) Order 2007]] became effective, raising the minimum purchase age to 18 years of age. There is no stated age under which it is illegal to consume tobacco, although an officer has the right to confiscate tobacco if the individual concerned is in a public place and under sixteen years of age.
{{Quote|text='''Children and Young Persons Act 1933 – Section 7'''&lt;br /&gt;(1) Any person who sells to a person '''under the age of eighteen years''' any tobacco or cigarette papers, whether for his own use or not, shall be liable, on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 4 on the standard scale.&lt;br /&gt;(3) It shall be the duty of a constable and of a park-keeper being in uniform to seize any tobacco or cigarette papers in the possession of any person apparently '''under the age of sixteen years''' whom he finds smoking in any street or public place, and any tobacco or cigarette papers so seized shall be disposed of, if seized by a constable, in such manner as the police authority may direct, and if seized by a park-keeper, in such manner as the authority or person by whom he was appointed may direct.|sign=Children and Young Persons Act 1933|source=[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/23-24/12/section/7 Section 7 – Sale of tobacco, &amp;c. to persons under eighteen]}}

===Scotland===

Until 30 September 2007, the minimum age to purchase and consume tobacco products in public was 16 years of age. From 30 September 2007 the [[Tobacco and Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2010]] became effective, raising the minimum purchase, consumption and possession age to 18 years of age.

==Smoking ban==
{{Main|Smoking ban}}
Smoking in workplaces and enclosed public spaces has been illegal since 26 March 2006 in Scotland,  2 April 2007 in Wales, 30 April 2007 in Northern Ireland and 1 July 2007 in [[Smoking ban in England|England]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Scotland begins pub smoking ban |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4845260.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=26 March 2006 |accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Roxby |first=Philippa |date=1 July 2012 |title=Smoking ban's impact five years on |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-18628811 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further restrictions===

On 6 April 2012, the [[Tobacco display ban|display of tobacco products was banned]] in retailers larger than 280 square metres in England. With the ban coming into effect in small retailers three years later on 6 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Full implementation of display ban|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32188988|accessdate=11 April 2015|date=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, the [[Cameron-Clegg coalition|Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government]] committed itself to holding a public consultation on the introduction of [[plain tobacco packaging]]. Influenced by the introduction of plain packaging in [[Australia]], the House of Commons voted 367–113 in March 2015 to pass the Children and Families Act 2014 which would give the government the power to require plain packaging for tobacco products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plain packaging law|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/6/section/94/enacted|website=Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came into force on 20 May 2016, but tobacco companies were given one year to sell off remaining stock; in which afterwards, all tobacco products sold in the UK must follow plain packaging laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC article on plain packaging vote|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/36329053/whats-going-on-with-cigarette-packets-as-menthol-cigarettes-are-banned-from-2020|accessdate=20 May 2016|publisher=BBC|date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On October 1, 2015 a law was passed which banned smoking in vehicles with anyone under eighteen years of age present. The law does not apply to e-cigarettes, if the driver is seventeen years of age and alone in the vehicle or in a convertible with the roof completely down.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/smoking-in-vehicles&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronic cigarettes==
{{Main|Electronic cigarette}}
Despite the name, 'e-cigarette,' these devices contain no tobacco and produce no smoke, and therefore any reference to them, should be under e-cigarettes and not smoking. Exceptions to this might be their role as an alternative to smoking, or as devices where it increasingly looks like they are helping young people avoid smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6414a3.htm?s_cid=mm6414a3_w|title=Tobacco Use Among Middle and High School Students — United States, 2011–2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April 2014 the [[Welsh Government]] published a public health [[white paper]] in which it proposed a ban on the use of [[Electronic cigarette|e-cigarettes]] in public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |date=2 April 2014 |title=Listening to you: Your health matters |url=http://wales.gov.uk/docs/phhs/consultation/140402consultationen.pdf |publisher=[[Welsh Government]] |page=18 |accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bill was subsequently defeated.

The annual Smokefree GB survey, published in May 2017, concluded that 52% of the 2.9 million British e-cigarette users are now ex-smokers. 26% of respondents thought e-cigarettes were as harmful as real cigarettes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More than half of e-cigarette users have quit smoking tobacco, survey reveals|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20202738.article|accessdate=3 June 2017|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In March 2017, it was reported by [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] UK's e-cigarette boom is on a decline, with the number of people using e-cigarettes in Britain decreasing for the first time since their launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/01/britains-e-cigarette-boom-data-suggests/|title=Britain's e-cigarette boom is over, data suggests|last=Morley|first=Katie|date=2017-03-01|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-10-11|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-GMO activist coalition Genetically Engineered Food Alert, which detected and first reported the contamination, was [[Criticism of the Food and Drug Administration|critical of the FDA]] for not doing its job.  The recall of Taco Bell-branded taco shells, manufactured by [[Kraft Foods]] and sold in supermarkets, was the most publicized of the recalls. One settlement resulted in $60 million going to Taco Bell franchisees for lost sales due to the damage to the Taco Bell brand.

In 2000, Genetically Engineered Food Alert was launched by seven organizations ([[Center for Food Safety]], [[Friends of the Earth]], [[Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy]], National Environmental Trust, [[Organic Consumers Association]], [[Pesticide Action Network]] North America, and The State [[PIRG]]s) to lobby the FDA, Congress and companies to ban or stop using GMOs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000817211601/http://www.gefoodalert.org/html/whoisgefoodalert.htm Internet Archive capture of Genetically Engineered Food Alert webpage, August 17, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margot Roosevelt for Time Magazine.

January 29, 2001 [http://www.biotech-info.net/aventis_agreement.html Aventis, states reach agreement over StarLink corn]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bayer#Bayer CropScience|Aventis]] initiated a program called the StarLink Enhanced Stewardship (SES) program, under which StarLink corn, buffer corn, and any corn stored in [[grain elevators]] that had become mixed with StarLink, would be bought by Aventis and directed to animal feed and non-food industrial use (e.g. ethanol production); the program included free kits to test for StarLink, and covered costs of cleaning equipment, transport, and storage facilities, as well as increased transportation costs.&lt;ref&gt;D.

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB973211373330867246#articleTabs%3Darticle Corn-Recall Cost Could Reach Into the Hundreds of Millions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note:  Despite long searching, as of October 2013 editors could find no reliable source reporting on the actual cost of the StarLink buyback to Aventis.  The task is complicated due to the sale of Aventis CropScience to Bayer in October 2001, in which Aventis agreed to retain liability for matters related to StarLink ([http://cnnfn.cnn.com/2001/10/02/europe/bayer/ CNN News, October 2, 2001]), the subsequent merger of Sanofi and Aventis in 2004 ([http://en.sanofi.com/our_company/history/history.aspx Sanofi company history, Official site]), and the fact that Aventis and Sanofi are not US companies and their regulatory filings are not in English.  In a financial regulatory filing submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission in March 2003, in which Aventis provided consolidated financial reporting for the years 2000-2002, Aventis described the sale of Aventis CropScience to Bayer and communicated that it had indemnified Bayer for all matters related to StarLink and other environmental liabilities and that the sale had netted Aventis  €4.2B, and "This sale resulted in a gain for Aventis of €2.07 billion after provisions for indemnification related to the StarLink litigation, as well as environmental, tax, and product liability indemnification as stipulated in the Share Purchase Agreement between Aventis and Bayer."([http://www.sanofi.com/Images/16104_20F_Doc-Ref_2002_Aventis_EN.pdf Aventis Form F-20 for calendar years 2000-2002], F-43)  Therefore Aventis seems to have reserved about €2.1B euros in 2003, which at that time was US$2.3B.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was estimated that due to grain mixing StarLink corn could have existed in more than 50% of the US corn supply&lt;ref name=StarLinkAfter&gt;Staff, Cornell Cooperative Extension, 2002.

Following the recalls, 51 people reported adverse effects to the FDA; these reports were reviewed by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which determined that 28 of them were possibly related to StarLink.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, EPA review committee. [http://www.usda.gov/documents/LLP%20Incidents%202.docx LLP Incidents]&lt;/ref&gt;  The CDC studied the blood of these 28 individuals and concluded there was no evidence the reactions these people experienced were associated with hypersensitivity to the StarLink Bt protein.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehhe/Cry9cReport/default.htm CDC, National Center for Environmental Health.

The EPA was criticized by Joseph Mendelson III of the [[Center for Food Safety]], who said "Clearly they didn't do anything here until they became embarrassed."&lt;ref name="Pollack"&gt;{{Citation |last=Pollack|first=Andrew|date=September 4, 2001|title=Altered Corn Surfaced Earlier|publisher=New York Times |publication-place=New York|page=1|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/04/business/04STAR.html|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA and Aventis were also criticized for statements at the time of the recall that indicated they had no idea such a thing would happen.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{Citation |last=Pollack|first=Andrew|date=September 4, 2001|title=Altered Corn Surfaced Earlier|publisher=New York Times |publication-place=New York|page=2|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/04/business/04STAR.html|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If there has been a violation of our licensing process, then we would have a very great concern," was attributed to Stephen Johnson of the EPA. Margaret Gadsby of Aventis was quoted with her earlier statement "We have difficulty imagining how our corn could end up in the human food supply."

The registration for the StarLink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Janet E. Carpenter and Leonard P. Gianessi, US National Center for Food and Agricultural Policy. 2001. [http://ucbiotech.org/biotech_info/PDFs/Carpenter_2001_Updated_Benefits.pdf Agricultural Biotechnology: Updated Benefit Estimates],&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}  In February 2001, it was announced that the president, general counsel, and vice president of market development for Aventis CropScience (US), had been fired in response to the recall.&lt;ref name=guardian &gt;{{cite news|title=Aventis chiefs in GM blunder sacked|author1=Clark, A. |author2=Martinson, J. |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2001/feb/13/gm.food|newspaper=The Guardian|date=February 12, 2001|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2001 [[Yum! Brands#Tricon Global|Tricon Global Restaurants]], 20% owners of Taco Bell at the time, announced a $60 million settlement with some of the suppliers of the supermarket taco shells; under the terms of the settlement they could not disclose the identity of suppliers.&lt;ref name="NPI"&gt;{{Citation|date=June 12, 2001|title=Taco Bell Rings up $60 Million for StarLink-Contaminated Shells|publisher=Virgo Publishing|publication-place=Louisville, KY|page=|url=http://www.naturalproductsinsider.com/news/2001/06/taco-bell-rings-up-60-million-for-starlink-contam.aspx|accessdate=August 7, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020215847/http://www.naturalproductsinsider.com/news/2001/06/taco-bell-rings-up-60-million-for-starlink-contam.aspx|archivedate=October 20, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tricon stated that the settlement would go to Taco Bell franchisees and Tricon would not receive any of it.  Tricon also announced that it, along with the suppliers and franchisees, would initiate litigation against the parties responsible for StarLink entering the food chain.

In September 2001, a group of about 5,000 Taco Bell franchisees and a handful of taco shell suppliers brought a class-action lawsuit against Aventis, Garst Seed Co.; Gruma Corp., ("the largest producer and distributor of corn flour and tortillas in the United States) and Azteca Milling seeking damages.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, September 19, 2001.

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|65}}

In 2002, Aventis, Garst, Kraft Foods, Azteca Foods, Azteca Milling, and Mission Foods settled a lawsuit brought by two people, and the grandmother of a third, who claimed to have had allergic reactions to StarLink, for $9 million.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, Livestock Weekly.

In 2002, nongovernmental organizations claimed that aid sent by the UN and the US to Central American nations also contained some StarLink corn. The nations involved, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala refused to accept the aid.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Clapp. Hunger in the Balance: The New Politics of International Food Aid.

'''Stubble burning''' is the deliberate setting fire of the straw [[crop residue|stubble]] that remains after wheat and other grains have been harvested. The practice was widespread until the 1990s, when governments increasingly restricted its use.

==Effects==
[[File:NP India burning 48 (6315309342).jpg|thumb|Burning of rice residues after harvest, to quickly prepare the land for wheat planting, around [[Sangrur]], [[Punjab, India]].]]
The burning of stubble, contrasted with alternatives such as ploughing the stubble back into the ground has a number of consequences and effects on the environment&lt;ref name="vicgovau"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grains and Other Crops» Crop Production» Stubble Burning |url=http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/agriculture/grains-and-other-crops/crop-production/stubble-burning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stubble burning:
*Quickly clears the field and is cheap.
*Kills weeds, including those resistant to herbicide.
*Kills slugs and other pests.
*Can reduce nitrogen tie-up

However, it has a number of harmful effects on the environment:
* Loss of nutrients.
* Pollution from smoke.
* Damage to electrical and electronic equipment from floating threads of conducting waste.
* Risk of fires spreading out of control&lt;ref name="mailtimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ellison|first=Amelia|title=Stubble burns cause headache for firebrigades|url=http://www.mailtimes.com.au/story/976274/stubble-burns-cause-headaches-for-fire-brigades/|accessdate=24 August 2013|newspaper=The Wimmera Mail Times|date=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a perception that stubble burning contributes to atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. However carbon dioxide releases are only slightly greater than those from natural decomposition.&lt;ref name="vicgovau"/&gt;

==Attitudes to stubble burning==
*Stubble burning has been effectively prohibited since 1993 in England and [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1993/1366/contents/made|title=The Crop Residues (Burning) Regulations 1993|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A perceived increase in [[Alopecurus myosuroides|blackgrass]], and particularly herbicide resistant blackgrass, has led to a campaign by some arable farmers for its return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tasker|first=Johann|title=Farmers step up stubble burning campaign|url=http://www.fwi.co.uk/articles/30/07/2012/134162/farmers-step-up-stubble-burning-campaign.htm|accessdate=24 August 2013|date=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Australia]] stubble burning is "not the preferred option for the majority of farmers"&lt;ref name="vicgovau"/&gt; but is permitted and recommended in some circumstances. Farmers are advised to rake and burn windrows, and leave a fire break of 3 metres around any burn off.&lt;ref name="mailtimes"/&gt;
*In the [[United States]], fires are fairly common in mid-western states. Many of the fires in the video are started deliberately.

[[File:Fires observed in the United States From July 2002 through July 2011.ogv|thumb|This visualization shows fires detected in the United States from July 2002 through July 2011. Look for fires that reliably burn each year in western states and across the Southeast.]]

*In [[France]], stubble burning is said to be fairly common.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
*In [[China]], there is a governmental ban on stubble burning, however the practice remains fairly common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Farmers burn wheat stubble despite ban|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90882/8285589.html|accessdate=24 August 2013|newspaper=Peoples Daily|date=&lt;!-- 10:31 --&gt; June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In northern India, despite a ban by the Punjab Pollution Control Board, the practice of stubble burning is still practiced.  Authorities are starting to enforce this ban more proactively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paddy stubble burning: Two farmers booked in Sangrur|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/patiala/paddy-stubble-burning-two-farmers-booked-in-sangrur/article1-1281168.aspx|accessdate=23 November 2014|work=Hindustan Times|date=October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/india-is-trying-to-prevent-apocalyptic-air-pollution-step-1-stop-farmers-from-burning-their-fields/2018/10/15/79d3fd52-cb20-11e8-ad0a-0e01efba3cc1_story.html|title=India is trying to prevent apocalyptic air pollution.

* Stubble burning is allowed by permit in some Canadian provinces, including Manitoba where 5% of farmers were estimated to do it in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/smoke-from-stubble-fires-engulfs-winnipeg-1.678678|title=Smoke from stubble fires engulfs Winnipeg|date=September 6, 2007|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 9 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; For this, NGT (National Green Tribunal) slapped a fine of Rs. 2 lakh on the Delhi Government for not filing an action plan providing incentives and infrastructural assistance to farmers to stop them from burning crop residue to prevent air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/crop-burning-ngt-slaps-rs-2-lakh-as-costs-on-delhi-govt-for-not-filing-action-plan/story-IxLjRrWXOhSAYYcG1NaCKJ.html|title=Crop burning: NGT slaps Rs 2 lakh as costs on Delhi govt for not filing action plan|last=|first=|date=2018-04-03|work=Hindustan Times|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although harvesters are available such as the Indian-manufactured "Happy Seeder" that shred the crop residues into small pieces and uniformly spread them across the field, as an alternative to burning the crops, farmers complain that the cost of these machines is prohibitive compared to burning the fields.&lt;ref name="ashok2017" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16911">[[File:Mallon-Mary 01.jpg|thumb|[[Typhoid Mary]] pictured above in a 1909 tabloid was a famous case of a subclinical infection of ''[[Salmonella typhi|Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi]]'', the infectious agent of [[typhoid fever]]]]
A '''subclinical infection''' (sometimes called a '''preinfection''') is an [[infection]] that, being [[wikt:subclinical|subclinical]], is nearly or completely asymptomatic (no [[medical sign|signs]] or [[symptom]]s). A subclinically infected person is thus an [[asymptomatic carrier]] of a [[microbe]], [[intestinal parasite]], or [[virus]] that usually is a [[pathogen]] causing [[illness]], at least in some individuals. Many pathogens spread by being silently carried in this way by some of their [[Host (biology)|host]] population. Such infections occur both in humans and nonhuman animals. An example of an asymptomatic infection is a  mild [[common cold]] that is not noticed by the infected individual. Since subclinical infections often occur without eventual overt sign, their existence is only identified  by [[microbiological culture]] or DNA techniques such as [[polymerase chain reaction]].

==Infection transmission/signs==
An individual may only develop signs of an infection after a period of subclinical infection, a duration that  is called the [[incubation period]]. This is the case, for example, for subclinical [[sexually transmitted disease]]s such as [[AIDS]] and [[genital warts]].  Individuals with such subclinical infections, and those that never develop overt illness, creates a reserve of individuals that can [[Transmission (medicine)|transmit]] an [[infectious agent]] to [[infect]] other individuals. Because such cases of infections do not come to clinical attention, [[Epidemiological study|health statistics]] can often fail to measure the true [[prevalence]] of an infection in a [[Statistical population|population]], and this prevents the accurate [[Mathematical modelling in epidemiology|modeling of its infectious transmission]].{{medical citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Types of subclinical infections==

The following pathogens (together with their symptomatic illnesses) are known to be carried [[Asymptomatic#Types|asymptomatically]], often in a large percentage of the potential host population:

==Host tolerance==
[[Fever]] and [[sickness behavior]] and other signs of infection are often taken to be due to them. However, they are [[Evolutionary medicine#Evolved self-treatments|evolved physiological and behavioral responses]] of the host to clear itself of the infection. Instead of incurring the [[Deployment cost-benefit selection in physiology|costs of deploying]] these evolved responses to infections, the body opts to tolerate an infection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller MR, White A, Boots M |title=The evolution of host resistance: tolerance and control as distinct strategies |journal=J.

Biol. |volume=236 |issue=2 |pages=198–207 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16005309 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.03.005 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-5193(05)00094-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as an alternative to seeking to control or remove the infecting pathogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boots M, Bowers RG |title=The evolution of resistance through costly acquired immunity |journal=Proc.

Subclinical infections are important since they allow infections to spread from a reserve of carriers. They also can cause clinical problems unrelated to the direct issue of infection. For example, in the case of  [[urinary tract infection]]s in women, this infection may cause [[preterm delivery]] if the person becomes [[pregnancy|pregnant]] without proper [[Pharmacotherapy|treatment]].&lt;ref name=UTI&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Romero R, Espinoza J, Chaiworapongsa T, Kalache K |title=Infection and prematurity and the role of preventive strategies |journal=Semin Neonatol |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=259–74 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12401296 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1084275602901211 |doi=10.1053/siny.2002.0121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sugar tit''' is a folk name for a baby [[pacifier]], or dummy, that was once commonly made and used in North America and Britain. It was made by placing a spoonful of [[sugar]], or honey, in a small patch of clean cloth, then gathering the cloth around the sugar and twisting it to form a bulb. The bulb was then secured by twine or a rubber band. The baby's saliva would slowly dissolve the sugar in the bulb. 

In use the exposed outfolded fabric could give the appearance of a [[flower]] in the baby's mouth. David Ransel quotes a Russian study by Dr. N. E. Kushev while discussing a similar home-made cloth-and-food pacifier called a soska; there, the term "flower" as used colloquially by mothers, refers to a bloom of mold in the child's mouth caused by decay of the contents. &lt;ref&gt;David Ransel [https://books.google.com/books?id=LpUncmF-megC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=russian+soska+pacifier&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KcngNgART3&amp;sig=ilq47a9wzafpCcC5IGieaceJsT0&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=russian%20soska%20pacifier&amp;f=false "Village Mothers: three generations of change in Russia and Tataria"], 28-29&lt;/ref&gt; 

As early as 1802 a German physician, Christian Struve, described the sugar tit as "one of the most revolting customs".&lt;ref&gt;Gale and Martyn, [http://shm.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/8/2/231.pdf ''Dummies and the Health of Hertfordshire Infants, 1911–1930''], Soc Hist Med.1995; 8: 231-255, accessed February 21, 2007 (subscription only)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the merger of Thomson with [[Reuters Group]] to form [[Thomson Reuters]] in 2008, it became the "Scientific" business unit of the new company. In 2009, the Scientific business came together with the Healthcare business to form the Healthcare &amp; Science business of Thomson Reuters. The healthcare business was sold in 2012 and is now [[Truven Health Analytics]]. Prior to 2006 the two businesses were combined as Thomson Scientific &amp; Healthcare.

'''''Welfare, Choice and Solidarity in Transition: reforming the health sector in Eastern Europe''''' was written by [[János Kornai]] and [http://fsi.stanford.edu/people/kareneggleston/ Karen Eggleston], published in 2001.

This book focused on ten post-socialist Eastern European countries, including [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Slovenia]].

In 2007, (according to the definition of the [[World Bank]]) in these ten countries, Albania is a [[lower-middle-income economy]]; the Czech Republic and Slovenia are [[high-income economies]]; and others belong to [[upper-middle-income economies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20421402~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html Country Groups (The World Bank)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''xenoma''' (also known as a 'xenoparasitic complex') is a growth caused by various [[protists]] and [[fungi]], most notably [[microsporidia]]. It can occur on numerous [[organism]]s; however is predominantly found on [[fish]].&lt;ref name="Lom2005"&gt;
{{Cite journal |vauthors=Lom J, Dyková I | title=Microsporidian xenomas in fish seen in wider perspective | journal=Folia Parasitologica | volume=52 | issue=1–2 | pages=69–81 | doi=10.14411/fp.2005.010| pmid=16004366 | year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In most cases the [[host cell]] and [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] suffers from [[hypertrophy]] resulting in a change in organisation of the [[cell (biology)|cell]] and its structure and can result in [[polyploid]] [[cell nucleus|nuclei]]. This outcome is due to the microsporidian [[parasite]] proliferating inside the host cell. This results in a '[[symbiosis|symbiotic]] co-existence' between the [[parasite]] and the host cell.&lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt; This forms the xenoparasitic complex. They tend to contain numerous cellular components as well as microsporidia at different developmental stages and spores.&lt;ref name="Matos2003"&gt;
{{Cite journal |vauthors=Matos E, Corral L, Azevedo C | title=Ultrastructural details of the xenoma of ''Loma myrophis'' (phylum Microsporidia) and extrusion of the polar tube during autoinfection | journal=Diseases of Aquatic Organisms | volume=54 | issue=3 | pages=203–207 | doi=10.3354/dao054203| pmid=12803384 | year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all [[microsporidia]] infections result in the formation of xenomas; only a few [[microsporidia]] actually cause xenoma formation.&lt;ref name="Matos2003"/&gt;

==History==

Xenoparasitic complex was the term initially devised in the early twentieth century to describe specific type 'tumours' found on various organisms, specific as the infections were caused by multiple subclasses of [[microsporidia]]. A paper published in 1922 by Weissenberg came up with the term 'xenon' for the xenoparasitic complexes he observed on sticklebacks caused by ''[[Glugea|Glugea anomala]]'', before eventually changing it to xenoma ([[xenon]] was already the name of a newly discovered chemical element).&lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weissenberg1922"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Weissenberg R | title=Mikrosporidien und Chlamydozoen als Zellparasiten von Fischen | journal=Verh. Dtsch. Zool. Ges. | volume=27 | pages=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hypertrophy]] of cells caused by [[protists]] and [[fungi]] has been observed since the late nineteenth century. Scientists observed them in several organisms, of which the infection would have varied host cell specificity, ultimately leading to different cellular consequences.&lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt; For example, the [[dinoflagellate]] [[protist]] ''Sphaeripara catenata'' induces [[hypertrophy]], [[polyploid]] nuclei formation whilst forming a thick-walled hyposome where [[rhizoids]] extend into the cytoplasm for nutrient [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] in the [[Larvacea|appendicularian]] ''Fritillaria pellucida''.&lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chatton1920"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Chatton E | title=Un complexe xéno-parasitaire morphologique et physiologique ''Neresheimeria paradoxa'' chez ''Fritillaria pellucida''| journal=C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris | volume=171 | pages=55–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be contrasted to the ''Microsporidium cotti'' infection of the [[testes]] of ''Taurulus bubalis'' where a dense microvillus layer is present for improved nutrient absorption.&lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chatton1923"&gt;
{{Cite journal |vauthors=Chatton E, Courrier R | title=Formation d'un complexe xénoparasitaire géant avec bordure en brosse, sous l'influence d'une Microsporidie, dans le testicule de ''Cottus bubalis''| journal=C. R. Soc. Biol. (Paris) | volume=89 | pages=579–583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathogenesis==

Xenomas are provoked in various types of organisms, depending on the species of the [[parasite]]. [[Microsporidia]] are known to produce xenomas in [[oligochaeta|oligochaetes]], [[insects]], [[crustaceans]] and [[fish]].&lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt; In addition to organism specificity, different species of parasite will have distinct host cell specificity, even if targeting the same organism. For example, ''Microsporidium chaetogastris'' infects solely connective and muscle tissue cells of the [[annelid]] ''[[Chaetogaster]] diaphanus'',&lt;ref name="Schröder1923"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Schröder O | title=''Thelohania chaetogastris'', eine neue in ''Chaetogaster diaphanus'' Gruith schmarotzende Microsporidienart| journal=Arch. Protistenkd. | volume=14 | pages=119–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other species of microsporidia will target other tissue types. Another example is microsporidial gill disease in different species of fish caused by ''[[Loma (microsporidian)|Loma salmonae]]''. It was found that certain species had a higher prevalence of xenoma formation following infection with the same parasite i.e. xenomas per gill filament in chinook salmon was 8 to 33 times greater than in rainbow trout, showing differences in host cell susceptibility.&lt;ref name="Ramsay2002"&gt;
{{Cite journal |vauthors=Ramsay JM, Speare DJ, Dawe SC, Kent ML | title=Xenoma formation during microsporidial gill disease of salmonids caused by ''Loma salmonae'' is affected by host species (''Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, O. kisutch, O. mykiss'') but not by salinity| journal=Diseases of Aquatic Organisms | volume=48 | issue=2| pages=125–131 | doi=10.3354/dao048125| pmid=12005234| year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Once a host cell is infected with the [[microsporidian]] (or [[protist]]) [[parasite]], a complete restructuring of the host cell ensues. This occurs as the parasite seeks to take control of the [[metabolism]] of the cell, in order to survive and exploit the host cell's resources and [[reproduction]]. It provides the parasite with optimal growth conditions and protection from the host's immune response. The [[parasite]] [[cell proliferation|proliferates]] within the host cell where its mass replaces most of the host cell's [[cytoplasm]], with the rest being taken up by [[microvillus]] structures and [[rhizoids]]. Other structures may be present inside the infected host cell including [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]s, [[globules of fat|fat globules]] and bundles of [[fibril]]. The nucleus may be in varying locations including the centre of the cell and may also vary in structure i.e. lobed, branched or divided into multiple fragments, but it will always be [[hypertrophy|hypertrophic]].&lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt; The host also commonly envelops the proliferating parasite and the host cell itself in layers of membranes and cells.&lt;ref name="Matos2003"/&gt;

In microsporidian xenomas the whole [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] is restricted to the xenoma; this however differs between different [[protists]].&lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt; The life cycle predominantly follows a simple [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] consisting of merogony followed by sporogony. Occasionally the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] associates with meronts, which are formed during merogony, and is lost once sporogony ensues.&lt;ref name="Mansour2005"&gt;
{{Cite journal |vauthors=Mansour L, Prensier G, Jemaa SB, Hassine OK, Méténier G, Vivarès CP, Cornillot E | title=Description of a xenoma-inducing microsporidian, ''Microgemma tincae'' n. sp., parasite of the teleost fish ''Symphodus tinca'' from Tunisian coasts | journal=Diseases of Aquatic Organisms | volume=65 | issue=3 | pages=217–226 | doi=10.3354/dao065217| pmid=16119890 | year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The time it takes for a xenoma to develop varies entirely on the host organism and cell as well as the infecting [[parasite]]. It can vary, however it usually starts to form after a few weeks following infection, depending on the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] of the [[parasite]]. The size of xenomas also varies with the type of parasite and host organism, and can range from a few micrometres to several millimetres.&lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt;

While it is generally accepted that the xenoma prevents spread of the [[parasite]] throughout the host organism, it is not entirely accurate. As the [[species]] that cause xenomas are spore-forming, it is possible that their [[spores]] may release their [[sporoplasm]]s which penetrate the xenoma wall, infiltrating and infecting surrounding cells. In [[microsporidia]] this is mediated by a unique and highly specialised protein: the polar tube. This specialised protein is found inside the spore and is in contact with the sporoplasm. Specific environmental stimulation causes the spore to discharge the polar tube which penetrates the xenoma membrane and provides an exit route for the sporoplasm. This is thought to be a form of [[autoinfection]].&lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt; Rupture of the xenoma may also result in dispersal of the infectious spores.&lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt; This can lead to the formation of other and more persistent forms of xenomas.&lt;ref name="Matos2003"/&gt;

Transmission of such [[pathogen]]s occurs predominantly via [[oral administration]] when in contact or in the vicinity of diseased organisms via the release of infectious spores. However, there are reports of obtaining infection in some organisms through the skin.&lt;ref name="Lee2004"&gt;
{{Cite journal |vauthors=Lee SJ, Yokoyama H, Ogawa K | title=Modes of transmission of ''Glugea plecoglossi'' (Microspora) via the skin and digestive tract in an experimental infection model using rainbow trout, ''Oncorhyncus mykiss'' (Walbaum) | journal=J. Fish Dis. | volume=27 | issue=8 | pages=435–444 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2761.2004.00556.x| pmid=15291785 | year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experimentally inducing infection and xenoma formation can be performed intramuscularly, intravascularly and intraperitoneally.&lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt; It is widely thought that the first site of entry for many of these parasites is in the [[gastrointestinal tract]] where [[enzymes]] such as [[pepsin]] or even an alkaline [[pH]] shift (caused by the mucous layer prominent in this area) induces polar tube discharge.&lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee2003"&gt;
{{Cite journal |vauthors=Lee SJ, Yokoyama H, Ogawa K | title=Rapid ''in situ'' hybridisation technique for the detection of fish microsporidian parasites | journal=Fish Pathol. | volume=38 | issue=3 | pages=117–119 | doi=10.3147/jsfp.38.117| year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this their migration from their initial release to their final destination in the host cell varies considerably, depending on the [[pathogen]], the host organism and the host cell location. It was discovered through [[in situ hybridization|''in situ'' hybridization]] that the [[microsporidia]] ''[[Loma (microsporidian)|Loma salmonae]]'' enters the mucosal epithelium in the [[intestine]] and migrates to the [[lamina propria]] before arriving at the [[gills]], where it eventually resides, via infecting [[blood cells]].&lt;ref name="Sánchez2001"&gt;
{{Cite journal |vauthors=Sánchez JG, Speare DJ, Markham RJ, Wright GM, Kibenge FS | title=Localization of the initial developmental stages of ''Loma salmonae'' in rainbow trout (''Oncorhynchus mykiss'') | journal=Vet. Pathol. | volume=38 | issue=5 | pages=540–546 | doi=10.1354/vp.38-5-540| pmid=11572561 | year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other transport vehicles are thought to include [[T cells]], [[lymphocytes]], and other migratory cells including [[monocytes]] where they succumb to infection by means of either [[phagocytosis]] of the [[parasite]] in the [[lamina propria]] or by infiltration by sporoplasms using their polar tube. It is also very possible that these transport cells might themselves develop into a xenoma.&lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt;

==Xenomas in fish==

[[Microsporidia]] is a common cause of disease in fish and so xenomas tend to be seen more frequently in fish than in other organisms. A paper published in 2002 listed 15 genera and 157 microsporidian species that cause disease in fish,&lt;ref name="Matos2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lom2002"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Lom J | title=A catalogue of described genera and species of microsporidians parasitic in fish | journal=Syst Parasitol | volume=53 | issue=2 | pages=81–99 | doi=10.1023/a:1020422209539| pmid=12386417 | year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however only ten of these [[genus|genera]] induce xenoma formation.&lt;ref name="Mansour2005"/&gt; [[Microsporidia]] [[genus|genera]] that cause xenomas can therefore be quite diverse and so are characterised more comprehensively into several groups depending on their morphology:&lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt;

* Xenomas without a thick wall and where the complete volume of the original cell is not converted into a xenoma &lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt;
* Xenomas without a thick wall and where the complete volume of the original cell is converted into a xenoma &lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt;
* Xenomas with [[cell membrane|plasmalemma]] surrounded by host [[fibril]]s &lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt;
* Xenomas with a thick wall &lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt;

Recently fish-infecting [[microsporidia]] have been grouped into five classes depending on their molecular traits, a higher level of classification using SSU (small subunit) [[ribosomal DNA|rDNA]] analysis. However molecular data is still lacking for several [[genus|genera]] of [[microsporidia]].&lt;ref name="Lom2003 "&gt;
{{Cite journal |vauthors=Lom J, Nilsen F | title=Fish microsporidia: fine structural diversity and phylogeny | journal=International Journal for Parasitology | volume=33 | issue=2 | pages=107–127 | doi=10.1016/s0020-7519(02)00252-7| year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Xenomas found in other organisms===

Whilst xenomas are more highly characteristic of [[fish]], they can be quite extensive in other organisms including [[crustaceans]], [[insects]], [[oligochaeta|oligochaetes]] and other [[vertebrates]]. Microsporidian xenomas that develop in fish can also occur in [[crustaceans]].&lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt; Roughly 43 microsporidian [[genus|genera]] have been found to infect [[crustaceans]], with at least 23 microsporidian species found in [[shrimp]], most of them infecting [[muscle|muscular tissue]].&lt;ref name="Wang2013 "&gt;
{{Cite journal |vauthors=Wang TC, Nai YS, Wang CY, Solter LF, Hsu HC, Wang CH, Lo CF | title=A new microsporidium, ''Triwangia caridinae'' gen. nov., sp. Nov. parasitizing fresh water shrimp, ''Caridina formosae'' (Decapoda: Atyidae) in Taiwan | journal=Journal of Invertebrate Pathology | volume=112 | issue=3 | pages=281–293 | doi=10.1016/j.jip.2012.12.014| pmid=23318886 | year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other species also infect the digestive tract, [[sex organ|reproductive organs]] and their [[hepatopancreas]].&lt;ref name="Wang2013 "/&gt; Xenoma-like formations have also been found in species of [[shrew]] caused by ''Soricimyxum fegati'', a type of [[myxosporea]], showing they can also occur in mammals.&lt;ref name="Dyková2011"&gt;
{{Cite journal |vauthors=Dyková I, Tyml T, Kostka M | title=Xenoma-like formations induced by ''Soricimyxum fegati'' (Myxosporea) in three species of shrews (Soricomorpha: Soricidae), including records of new hosts | journal=Folia Parasitologica | volume=58 | issue=4 | pages=249–256 | doi=10.14411/fp.2011.024| year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

The host can eventually destroy the xenoma. Proliferative [[inflammation]] occurs in [[Cellular differentiation|mature]] xenomas and transforms them into [[granuloma]]s. [[Granuloma]] [[involution (medicine)|involution]] then ensues where [[phagocytosis]] kills the [[spore]]s.&lt;ref name="Lom2005"/&gt;

Studies have shown it is possible to [[vaccination|vaccinate]] against xenomas. One study showed that developing a [[vaccine]] using a 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; dose of killed spores from a low-virulence strain of ''[[Loma (microsporidian)|Loma salmonae]]'' resulted in [[rainbow trout]] producing 85% less xenomas in their gills after experimental infection (compared to the control). This ultimately offers much improved protection to microsporidial gill disease which is common amongst [[rainbow trout]].&lt;ref name="Speare2007"&gt;
{{Cite journal |vauthors=Speare DJ, Markham RJ, Guselle NJ | title=Development of an Effective Whole-Spore Vaccine To Protect against Microsporidial Gill Disease in Rainbow Trout (''Oncorhyncus mykiss'') by Using a Low-Virulence Strain of ''Loma salmonae'' | journal=Clinical and Vaccine Immunology | volume=14 | issue=12 | pages=1652–1654 | doi=10.1128/CVI.00365-07| pmid=17942613 | pmc=2168380 | year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therapeutic drugs have proved ineffective at treating this disease and harvesting whole-spores is a relatively easy technique.&lt;ref name="Speare2007"/&gt;
