'''Abell 400''' is a [[galaxy cluster]] which contains the [[galaxy]] [[NGC 1128]] with two [[supermassive black holes]] ([[3C 75]]) spiraling towards merger.

These two supermassive black holes are contained in NGC 1128. The galaxy, microwave radio jets, multi-million degree X-ray producing gas and resultant radio source is known as 3C 75. X-ray source 2A 0252+060 (1H 0253+058, XRS 02522+060) may be some additional or other portion of Abell 400.&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;{{ cite journal |doi=10.1086/190992 |author=Wood KS |author2=Meekins JF |author3=Yentis DJ |author4=Smathers HW |author5=McNutt DP |author6=Bleach RD |title=The HEAO A-1 X-ray source catalog |journal=Astrophys. J. Suppl. Ser. |date=December 1984 |volume=56 |issue=12 |pages=507–649 |bibcode=1984ApJS...56..507W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The black holes are an estimated 25,000 light years apart, and thus will take millions of years to collide. Should the two supermassive black holes merge, they will form a single super-supermassive black hole.

'''Analysis''' is the process of breaking a [[complexity|complex topic]] or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] since before [[Aristotle]] (384–322 [[Before Christ|B.C.]]), though ''analysis'' as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analysis/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Michael Beaney|accessdate=23 May 2012|author=Michael Beaney|year=Summer 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ἀνάλυσις (''analysis'', "a breaking up", from ''ana-'' "up, throughout" and ''lysis'' "a loosening").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=analysis (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=analysis|work=ONLINE ETYMOLOGY DICTIONARY|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=23 May 2012|author=Douglas Harper|year=2001–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a formal concept, the method has variously been ascribed to [[Alhazen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Haytham|title=Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Descartes]] (''[[Discourse on the Method]]''), and [[Galileo Galilei]]. It has also been ascribed to [[Isaac Newton]], in the form of a practical method of physical discovery (which he did not name).

==Applications==

===Science===
[[File:Clinical Chemistry Analyzer , Клинички биохемиски анализатор 3.jpg|thumb|A clinical chemistry analyser; hand shows size]]
{{See also|Analytical chemistry|List of chemical analysis methods}}
The field of [[chemistry]] uses analysis in at least three ways: to identify the components of a particular [[chemical compound]] (qualitative analysis), to identify the proportions of components in a [[mixture]] (quantitative analysis), and to break down [[chemical process]]es and examine [[chemical reaction]]s between [[chemical element|elements]] of [[chemical matter|matter]]. For an example of its use, analysis of the concentration of elements is important in managing a [[nuclear reactor]], so [[nuclear scientist]]s will analyse [[neutron activation analysis|neutron activation]] to develop discrete measurements within vast samples. A [[matrix (chemical analysis)|matrix]] can have a considerable effect on the way a chemical analysis is conducted and the quality of its results. Analysis can be done manually or with a [[analyzer|device]]. Chemical analysis is an important element of [[national security]] among the [[great power|major world powers]] with materials

====Isotopes====
{{See also|Isotope analysis|Isotope geochemistry}}
Chemists can use [[isotope analysis]] to assist analysts with issues in [[anthropology]], [[archeology]], [[food chemistry]], [[forensics]], [[geology]], and a host of other questions of [[physical science]]. Analysts can discern the origins of natural and man-made isotopes in the study of [[environmental radioactivity]].

===Business===
* [[Financial statement analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– the analysis of the accounts and the economic prospects of a firm
* [[Fundamental analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– a stock valuation method that uses financial analysis
* [[Technical analysis]] – the study of price action in securities markets in order to forecast future prices
* [[Business analysis]] – involves identifying the needs and determining the solutions to business problems
* [[Price analysis]] – involves the breakdown of a price to a unit figure
* [[Market analysis]] – consists of suppliers and customers, and price is determined by the interaction of [[supply and demand]]
* Opportunity analysis – consists of customers trends within the industry, customer demand and experience determine purchasing behavior

===Computer science===
* [[Requirements analysis]] – encompasses those tasks that go into determining the needs or conditions to meet for a new or altered product, taking account of the possibly conflicting requirements of the various stakeholders, such as beneficiaries or users.
* [[Competitive analysis (online algorithm)]] – shows how online algorithms perform and demonstrates the power of randomization in algorithms
* [[Lexical analysis]] – the process of processing an input sequence of characters and producing as output a sequence of symbols
* [[Object-oriented analysis and design]]&amp;nbsp;– à la [[Booch method|Booch]]
* [[Program analysis (computer science)]]&amp;nbsp;– the process of automatically analysing the behavior of computer programs
* [[Semantic analysis (computer science)]]&amp;nbsp;– a pass by a compiler  that adds semantical information to the parse tree and performs certain checks
* [[Static code analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs built from that
* [[Structured systems analysis and design methodology]]&amp;nbsp;– à la [[Yourdon]]
* [[Syntax analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– a process in compilers that recognizes the structure of programming languages, also known as parsing
* [[Worst-case execution time]]&amp;nbsp;– determines the longest time that a piece of software can take to run

===Economics===
* [[Agroecosystem analysis]]
* [[Input-output model]] if applied to a region, is called Regional Impact Multiplier System

===Engineering===
{{See also|Engineering analysis|Systems analysis}}
Analysts in the field of [[engineering]] look at [[Requirement analysis|requirements]], [[structural analysis|structures]], mechanisms, [[systems analysis|systems]] and [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]]. [[Electrical engineering|Electrical engineers]] analyse [[system analysis|systems]] in [[electronics]]. [[Whole-life cost|Life cycles]] and [[Accident analysis|system failures]] are broken down and studied by engineers. It is also looking at different factors incorporated within the design.

===Intelligence===
{{See also|Intelligence analysis}}
The field of [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] employs analysts to break down and understand a wide array of questions. [[Intelligence agency|Intelligence agencies]] may use [[heuristics]], [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[deductive reasoning]], [[social network analysis]], [[dynamic network analysis]], [[Social network#Social network analysis|link analysis]], and [[brainstorming]] to sort through problems they face. [[Military intelligence]] may explore issues through the use of [[game theory]], [[Red Team]]ing, and [[military simulation|wargaming]]. [[Signals intelligence]] applies [[cryptanalysis]] and [[frequency analysis]] to break [[code (cryptography)|codes]] and [[cipher]]s. [[Business intelligence]] applies theories of [[competitive intelligence|competitive intelligence analysis]] and [[competitor analysis]] to resolve questions in the [[Market (economics)|marketplace]]. [[Police|Law enforcement]] intelligence applies a number of theories in [[crime analysis]].

===Linguistics===
{{See also|Linguistics}}
[[Linguistics]] look at individual languages and [[language]] in general. It breaks language down and analyses its component parts: [[theoretical linguistics|theory]], [[phonology|sounds and their meaning]], [[pragmatics|utterance usage]], [[morphology (linguistics)|word origins]], the [[etymology|history of words]], the meaning of [[lexical semantics|words]] and [[phraseology|word combinations]], [[syntax|sentence construction]], [[discourse analysis|basic construction beyond the sentence level]], [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]], and [[conversation analysis|conversation]]. It examines the above using [[computational linguistics|statistics and modeling]], and [[semantic analysis (linguistics)|semantics]]. It analyses language in context of [[anthropological linguistics|anthropology]], [[biolinguistics|biology]], [[evolutionary linguistics|evolution]], [[language geography|geography]], [[historical linguistics|history]], [[neurolinguistics|neurology]], [[psycholinguistics|psychology]], and [[sociolinguistics|sociology]]. It also takes the [[applied linguistics|applied]] approach, looking at [[developmental linguistics|individual language development]] and [[clinical linguistics|clinical]] issues.

===Literature===
[[Literary criticism]] is the analysis of [[literature]]. The focus can be as diverse as the analysis of [[analysis (Homer)|Homer]] or [[psychoanalytic literary criticism|Freud]]. While not all literary-critical methods are primarily analytical in nature, the main approach to the teaching of literature in the west since the mid-twentieth century, literary formal analysis or close reading, is. This method, rooted in the academic movement labelled [[The New Criticism]], approaches texts – chiefly short poems such as [[sonnets]], which by virtue of their small size and significant complexity lend themselves well to this type of analysis – as units of discourse that can be understood in themselves, without reference to biographical or historical frameworks. This method of analysis breaks up the text linguistically in a study of [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] (the formal analysis of meter) and phonic effects such as [[alliteration]] and [[rhyme]], and cognitively in examination of the interplay of syntactic structures, figurative language, and other elements of the poem that work to produce its larger effects.

===Mathematics===
{{Main|Mathematical analysis}}

Modern mathematical analysis is the study of infinite processes. It is the branch of mathematics that includes calculus.  It can be applied in the study of [[classical mathematics|classical]] concepts of mathematics, such as [[real analysis|real numbers]], [[complex analysis|complex variables]], [[Fourier analysis|trigonometric functions]], and [[numerical analysis|algorithms]], or of [[non-classical analysis|non-classical]] concepts like [[constructivist analysis|constructivism]], [[harmonic analysis|harmonics]], [[non-standard analysis|infinity]], and [[functional analysis|vectors]].

[[Florian Cajori]] explains in [[wikiquote:A History of Mathematics|''A History of Mathematics'']] (1893) the difference between modern and ancient mathematical analysis, as distinct from logical analysis, as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The terms ''synthesis'' and ''analysis'' are used in mathematics in a more special sense than in logic. In ancient mathematics they had a different meaning from what they now have. The oldest definition of mathematical analysis as opposed to synthesis is that given in  [appended to] [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid]], XIII. 5, which in all probability was framed by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]]: "Analysis is the obtaining of the thing sought by assuming it and so reasoning up to an admitted truth; synthesis is the obtaining of the thing sought by reasoning up to the inference and proof of it." 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The analytic method is not conclusive, unless all operations involved in it are known to be reversible. To remove all doubt, the Greeks, as a rule, added to the analytic process a synthetic one, consisting of a reversion of all operations occurring in the analysis. Thus the aim of analysis was to aid in the discovery of synthetic proofs or solutions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

James Gow uses a similar argument as Cajori, with the following clarification, in his [https://books.google.com/books?id=KSe_ZEmHaXEC&amp; ''A Short History of Greek Mathematics''] (1884):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The synthetic proof proceeds by shewing that the proposed new truth involves certain admitted truths. An analytic proof begins by an assumption, upon which a synthetic reasoning is founded. The Greeks distinguished ''theoretic'' from ''problematic'' analysis. A theoretic analysis is of the following kind. To ''prove'' that A is B, ''assume'' first that A is B. If so, then, since B is C and C is D and D is E, therefore A is E. If this be known a falsity, A is not B. But if this be a known truth and all the intermediate propositions be [[wiktionary:convertible#Adjective|convertible]], then the reverse process, A is E, E is D, D is C, C is B, therefore A is B, constitutes a synthetic proof of the original theorem. Problematic analysis is applied in all cases where it is proposed to construct a figure which is assumed to satisfy a given condition. The problem is then converted into some theorem which is involved in the condition and which is proved synthetically, and the steps of this synthetic proof taken backwards are a synthetic solution of the problem.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Music===
* [[Musical analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– a process attempting to answer the question "How does this music work?"
* [[Schenkerian analysis]]

===Philosophy===
* [[Philosophical analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– a general term for the techniques used by philosophers
* ''[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]]'' is the name of a prominent journal in philosophy.

===Psychotherapy===
* [[Psychoanalysis]]&amp;nbsp;– seeks to elucidate connections among unconscious components of patients' mental processes
* [[Transactional analysis]]

===Public Policy===
* [[Policy Analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– The use of statistical data to predict the effects of policy decisions made by governments and agencies
* [[Qualitative research|Qualitative Analysis]]– The use of anecdotal evidence to predict the effects of policy decisions or, more generally, influence policy decisions

===Signal processing===
* [[Finite element analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– a computer simulation technique used in engineering analysis
* [[Independent component analysis]]
* [[Link quality analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– the analysis of signal quality
* [[Path quality analysis]]
* [[Fourier analysis]]

===Statistics===
In [[statistics]], the term ''analysis'' may refer to any method used
for [[data analysis]]. Among the many such methods, some are:
* [[Analysis of variance]] (ANOVA)&amp;nbsp;– a collection of statistical models and their associated procedures which compare means by splitting the overall observed variance into different parts
* [[Boolean analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– a method to find deterministic dependencies between variables in a sample, mostly used in exploratory data analysis
* [[Cluster analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– techniques for grouping objects into a collection of groups (called clusters), based on some measure of proximity or similarity

Krapovickas received a degree in 1948 in [[Agronomy|agronomic engineering]] from the [[University of Buenos Aires]] and began teaching in 1949 as Professor of [[Genetics]] and Systems Botany at the [[National University of Córdoba|University of Córdoba]]. He later became Professor of Plant [[Anatomy]] at the [[National University of Tucumán]].&lt;ref name="UNNE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eluniversitario.unne.edu.ar/2005/87/pagina/fbl00.htm |title=Homenaje a dos Docentes en el 85° Aniversario de la Facultad |publisher=''Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias de [[National University of the Northeast|UNNE]]'' |accessdate=2008-06-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413140939/http://eluniversitario.unne.edu.ar/2005/87/pagina/fbl00.htm |archivedate=2008-04-13 |language=es |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, he moved to [[Corrientes]] to accept a position at the [[National University of the Northeast]] (UNNE), becoming Chair of its Department of Botany and Ecology in 1977.

Krapovickas' research centered on [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the [[Malvaceae]] family and biology of species in the genus ''[[Arachis]]'' ([[Fabaceae]]). His publications in these fields, including over 110 papers, 8 book chapters, and a [[monograph]] on ''Arachis'' - the genus of the groundnut - that he coauthored with [[Walton C. Gregory]], are very influential and widely cited.&lt;ref name="UNNE"/&gt;

'''''Buran''''' ({{lang-ru|Бура́н}}, {{IPA-ru|bʊˈran|IPA}}, meaning "Snowstorm" or "Blizzard"; [[GRAU]] index [[serial number]]: "'''11F35 K1'''") was the first [[spaceplane]] to be produced as part of the Soviet/Russian [[Buran programme]]. It is, depending on the source, also known as "'''OK-1K1'''", "'''Orbiter K1'''", "'''OK 1.01'''" or "'''Shuttle 1.01'''". Besides describing the first operational Soviet/Russian shuttle orbiter, "Buran" was also the designation for the whole Soviet/Russian spaceplane project and its orbiters, which were known as "''Buran''-class spaceplanes".

OK-1K1 completed one unmanned spaceflight in 1988, and was destroyed in 2002 when the hangar it was stored in collapsed.&lt;ref name="spw20121015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/buran.html |title=Buran |publisher=Russian Space Web |date=15 October 2012 |accessdate=28 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215094534/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/buran.html |archivedate=15 February 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains the only Soviet reusable [[spacecraft]] to be launched into space. The ''Buran''-class orbiters used the expendable [[Energia]] rocket, a class of [[super heavy-lift launch vehicle]].

== Construction ==
{{Main|Buran programme}}

The construction of the ''Buran''-class space shuttle orbiters began in 1980, and by 1984 the first full-scale orbiter was rolled out. Construction of a second orbiter ([[Ptichka|OK-1K2]], informally known as ''Ptichka'') started in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KgIzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fBUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5326,7017539|title=Star-News - Google News Archive Search|author=|date=|website=news.google.com|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KgIzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fBUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5124,7018028|title=Star-News - Google News Archive Search|author=|date=|website=news.google.com|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Buran'' programme ended in 1993.&lt;ref name=astronautix /&gt;

== Operational history ==
[[File:Buran.jpg|thumb|upright|Orbiter OK-1K1 ''Buran'' during launch on 15 November 1988]]

=== Orbital flight ===
The only orbital launch of a ''Buran''-class orbiter occurred at 03:00:02&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on 15 November 1988 from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] launch [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 110|pad 110/37]].&lt;ref name="spw20121015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="energia20081114"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energia.ru/eng/news/news-2008/photo_11-14.html |title=S.P.Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia held a ceremony... |work=Energia.ru |date=14 November 2008 |accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Buran'' was lifted into space, on an unmanned mission, by the specially designed Energia rocket. The automated launch sequence performed as specified, and the Energia rocket lifted the vehicle into a temporary orbit before the orbiter separated as programmed. After boosting itself to a higher orbit and completing two orbits around the Earth, the ODU ({{lang-ru|объединённая двигательная установка}}, сombined propulsion system) engines fired automatically to begin the descent into the atmosphere, [[Return To Launch Site|return to the launch site]], and [[VTHL|horizontal landing]] on a runway.&lt;ref name="natGeo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160412-soviet-union-space-shuttle-buran-cosmonaut-day-gagarin/ |title=The Forgotten Soviet Space Shuttle Could Fly Itself |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |first=Brian |last=Handwerk |date=12 April 2016 |accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After making an automated approach to Site 251 (known as Yubileyniy Airfield),&lt;ref name="spw20121015" /&gt; ''Buran'' touched down under its own control at 06:24:42&amp;nbsp;UTC and came to a stop at 06:25:24,&lt;ref name="buran1stfl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buran-energia.com/bourane-buran/bourane-versvol-1erVol.php |title=Buran: 1st Flight |work=Buran-Energia.com |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 206 minutes after launch.&lt;ref name="rockets_and_people"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050010181_2005010059.pdf |title=Raketi i lyudi |trans-title=Rockets and People |publisher=NASA |series=History Series |first=Boris |last=Chertok |editor-first=Asif A. |editor-last=Siddiqi |page=179 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a lateral wind speed of {{convert|61.2|km/h|mph}}, ''Buran'' landed only {{convert|3|m|ft}} laterally and {{convert|10|m|ft}} longitudinally from the target mark.&lt;ref name="rockets_and_people" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sd20131119a"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Russia_starts_ambitious_super_heavy_space_rocket_project_999.html |title=Russia starts ambitious super-heavy space rocket project |work=Space Daily |date=19 November 2013 |accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first space shuttle to perform an unmanned flight, including landing in fully automatic mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-spacecraft-to-orbit-and-land-unmanned |title=Largest spacecraft to orbit and land unmanned |publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] |accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later found that ''Buran'' had lost only eight of its 38,000 thermal tiles over the course of its flight.&lt;ref name="sd20131119a" /&gt;

=== Projected flights ===
In 1989, it was projected that OK-1K1 would have an unmanned second flight by 1993, with a duration of 15–20 days.&lt;ref name="projected"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buran.ru/htm/pilots.htm |title=Экипажи "Бурана" Несбывшиеся планы |website=Buran.ru |language=ru |accessdate=5 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Buran programme was never officially cancelled, the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] led to funding drying up and this never took place.&lt;ref name=astronautix&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Wade|work=Encyclopedia Astronautics|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/buran.htm|title=Buran|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220144916/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/buran.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2008|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other flights ===
[[File:Bourane 1.01 détruite.jpg|thumb|Wreck of ''Buran'' among hangar debris after the collapse of the hangar roof]]
In June 1989, ''Buran'' was carried on the back of the [[Antonov An-225 Mriya|Antonov An-225]] and took part in the [[Paris Air Show|1989 Paris Air Show]].
In 1990, it appeared at the [[Farnborough Airshow]]. Another flight of the spacecraft did not occur as together with the Energia carrier it was later put in a hangar at the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]], [[Kazakhstan]].

== Fate ==
On 12 May 2002,&lt;ref name="spw20121015" /&gt; during a severe storm at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, the MIK 112 [[hangar]] housing OK-1K1 collapsed as a result of poor maintenance.

'''Charles Clifton Brittlebank''' (1 Jan 1863 - 3 Nov 1945) was an Australian plant pathologist, mycologist (fungi specialist), scientific illustrator, university lecturer and farmer (near Bacchus Marsh, Victoria).  In all of his endeavours he became outstanding in his field, gaining international acclaim for his discoveries and publications. In February 1992 he was officially commemorated by the naming of the road Brittlebank Circuit, in the suburb of Banks, in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory.&lt;ref&gt;''Canberra's suburb and street names: origins and meanings'' 1992, Deptartment of the Environment, Land and Planning, A.C.T. Government, Canberra, ACT, Tuggeranong volume, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancestors ==
From 17th to 19th centuries the Brittlebank family was well-established in [[Wirksworth]], in the [[Peak District]] of Derbyshire in England.  The family prospered as (amongst other things) members of the legal profession and owners of lead mines.  In 1700 Hugh Brittlebank (1675-1764) moved from Wirksworth to the village at the centre of lead mining, [[Winster]], becoming the owner of the substantial manor house and grounds, Oddo House.&lt;ref name=Oddo&gt;'Oddo House - Winster' 2018, ''Derbyshire Peak District National Park Heritage'', accessed 15 Jun 2018, url: http://www.derbyshireheritage.co.uk/Menu/Townsandvillages/Winster/oddo-house.php.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh Brittlebank's family came to own most of the village of Winster.&lt;ref name=Oddo /&gt; They were at the centre of dramatic events in 1821 when they seem to have overstepped the mark, as the ''Times (London, England)'' reported on 2 June 1821: three of Hugh's great-great-grandsons forced a local doctor, William Cuddie, into a duel at which he was mortally wounded. The shooter, William Brittlebank, then disappeared completely.  The other two brothers involved, Andrew and Francis,  were tried for murder but were acquitted, in August 1821.&lt;ref&gt;Small, C 2001, ‘The Brittlebank Murder’, ‘’Winster Local History Group, Newsletter’’, no. 20,  May 2001, accessed 17 Jun 2018, url: http://www.winster.org/pages/History/Newsletters/Newsletter20.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, S and Smith, R 2012, 'Doctor dies in duel', ''Reflections'', accessed 18 Jun 2018, url: http://www.reflections-magazine.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parents and siblings ==

A fourth brother, not involved in the duel, was Thomas Brittlebank (1797-1838) whose son, Andrew William Thomas Brittlebank (1838-1877), was recorded in the 1871 England Census &lt;ref&gt;Ancestry.com 2004, ''1871 England Census'', Ancestry.com Operations Inc, Provo, UT, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; as having moved away from the traditional family village of Winster to a small seaside village, [[Hornsea]], in the neighbouring county of Yorkshire. He was accompanied by his wife Ellen Sarah Leese (1837-1906), his mother-in-law Mary Leese (1805-1877), and three sons: Lewis Oswald (1861-1877), '''Charles Clifton (1863-1945)''' and Thomas Andrew (1865-1948). The head of the house was not employed - he enjoyed a private income derived from his investments.

Andrew WT Brittlebank took his wife and children overseas, spending two years in [[Vanuatu]] (known then as the Spanish East Indies, and later as the New Hebrides), before going to Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, where the passenger list of the ship ''Sam Mendel'' records their arrival on 28 July 1875 &lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, GJ 2012, 'Brittlebank, Charles Clifton (1862 - 1945)', ''Encyclopedia of Australian Science 2015'', accessed 5 Jun 2018, url: http://www.eoas.info/biogs/P000263b.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ancestry.com 2010, ''Queensland, Australia, Passenger Lists, 1848-1912'', Ancestry.com Operations Inc, Provo, UT, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876 and 1877 [[The Courier-Mail|''The Brisbane Courier'']] frequently reported local waves of epidemics such as smallpox, malaria and influenza.  In March and April 1877 Andrew WT Brittlebank and his eldest son, Lewis Oswald, both died and were buried in the South Brisbane Cemetery in Plot 11a, graves 268 and 269.  Administrative procedures appear to have taken two years, for the [[Telegraph (Brisbane)|''Brisbane Telegraph'']] reported, on Friday 14 March 1879, page 3, that "his widow Ellen S. Brittlebank was appointed guardian of the persons and the estates of Charles Clifton Brittlebank and Thomas Andrew Brittlebank".

[[File:Bacchus Marsh, Victoria.png|thumb|left|Myrniong is near Bacchus Marsh in central Victoria, Australia]][[File:BacchusMarshExpress.JPG|thumb|1866, The office of the ''Bacchus Marsh Express'']]

The family then went south to the island of Tasmania.&lt;ref&gt;Australian National Herbarium 2013, ''Biographical notes: Brittlebank, Charles Clifton (1862 - 1945)'', viewed 10 Dec 2017, url: https://www.anbg.gov.au/biography/brittlebank-charles-clifton.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they did not remain in Tasmania, but returned to the mainland and finally put down roots in [[Myrniong]], near Bacchus Marsh, in the state of Victoria. The ''[[Bacchus Marsh Express]]'', 28 November 1885, page 2, announced that a mixed farm of 363 acres (approximately 150 hectares) was up for lease, after the death of the owner, William Dunbar in July 1884.  It appears that the Brittlebanks took the lease, because the ''Bacchus Marsh Express'' reported in 1888 that the two brothers were the owners: &lt;blockquote&gt; The Messrs. Brittlebank, the present owners of Dunbar's farm, have done excellent work, and have almost entirely eradicated the rabbits from their property. They have also erected a quantity of wire net fence. - ''Bacchus Marsh Express'', 17 Nov 1888, p.3.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Throughout their lives, the work of the brothers Charles and Thomas, whether joint or individual, contributed significantly to the dissemination of new knowledge of Australian plants, animals and geology.  The ''[[Victorian Naturalist]]'' summarized their contribution as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt; They compiled one of the first comprehensive bird lists for the area [the Werribee Gorge]. Charles was a renowned artist and contributed illustrations of birds and their eggs, insects, fungi and mistletoes for pioneering works on those subjects by AJ Cambpell, JA Leach, Charles French, Daniel McAlpine and himself. He published widely and was considered an authority on the evidence for glacial action in Werribee Gorge. Thomas was a skilled egg collector, bird observer, landscape artist and contributor to his brother's and AJ Campbell's studies. Together they helped to lay the foundations of natural history study in Victoria. - Marilyn Hewish, ''Victorian Naturalist'', Oct 2006, pp.314-317.&lt;ref&gt;Hewish, M 2006, 'Historical Notes on Charles and Thomas Brittlebank, Pioneer Naturalists in the Werribee Gorge District, West of Melbourne', ''Victorian Naturalist'' v. 123, no. 5, pp. 314-317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The brothers remained at Myrniong until 1910 &lt;ref&gt;'The Bird Observers Club', 1910, ''Emu'', v. 10, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; after which the Australian Electoral Rolls show that Charles and family moved to Caulfield near Melbourne, whilst Thomas took up a position as the manager of the Agricultural High School Farm, in Sale, Gippsland and, later, the Agricultural High School Farm in Warnambool.

Charles Clifton Brittlebank and Sarah Jane Palmer (1861-1935) were married on 1 August 1894, in St Matthew's Church in Kensington, Victoria.

They had only one child, Cyril Clifton, born in Myrniong in 1895. When World War I occurred he enlisted in [[13th Light Horse Regiment (Australia)|Australian 13th Light Horse Regiment]] in May 1915. After fighting at Gallipoli and on many of the battlefields on the Western Front, and having survived typhoid and various wounds, he died of influenza on 25 May 1918.  He was buried in Etretat Cemetery, Le Havre, Haute-Normandie, France. His grave is listed on the Etretat Churchyard Extension web site [http://www.inmemories.com/Cemeteries/etretatchurchext.htm].&lt;ref&gt;Australia, Australian War Memorial, Roll Of Honour: Cyril Clifton Brittlebank, url: https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/R1677697.&lt;/ref&gt;

A couple of months before the wedding of Charles and Sarah, Brittlebank's brother Thomas Andrew had married Marion Margaret Myers (1869-1932), on 10 June 1894.  They had three children.

Their eldest son, Andrew Buxton Brittlebank was born 10 February 1895.  Like his cousin Cyril, he enlisted in 1915, as reported in the ''Melton Express'' on 19 June 1915, page 3.  He became a corporal in [[59th Battalion (Australia)|Australian 59th Battalion]], was repeatedly wounded, and died of pneumonia on 15 Oct 1917.  He was buried in Aeroplane Cemetery, Ypres, Flanders, Belgium, and is listed on the cemetery's web site [https://www.ww1cemeteries.com/aeroplane-cemetery.html].&lt;ref&gt;Ancestry.com 2010, ''Australia, Death Index, 1787-1985'', Ancestry.com Operations Inc, Provo, UT, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

As described on the history page of the Shrine's web site [https://www.shrine.org.au/About-Us/History] the [[Shrine of Remembrance]] in Melbourne, Victoria was originally erected to commemorate the 19,000 Victorian victims of World War I who, like the Brittlebank cousins, were buried overseas leaving their Australian families without graves at which to mourn.

The name Buxton was the maiden name of Andrew William Thomas Brittlebank's maternal grandmother, Margaret Buxton (1779-1820) who lived in Thorpe, Derbyshire, England. Furthermore, [[Buxton]] was also the name of one of the most important towns in the Peak District of Derbyshire.   Thus the name may have held sentimental value for the expatriate Thomas Andrew Brittlebank who had been brought to Australia as a child.  He and his wife Marion gave each of their children the middle name of Buxton: Andrew (1895-1917), Olive (1897-1984) and Tom (1899-1966).

== Career ==

The value of Charles Clifton Brittlebank's work can be appreciated from the excitement generated by the announcement of a discovery &lt;ref&gt;Smith B 2013, 'The holy grail of Victorian insects rises from archives', ''The Age'', 29 September 2013, url: https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-holy-grail-of-victorian-insects-rises-from-archives-20130928-2ulag.html.&lt;/ref&gt; reported on 29 September 2013, on ''[[The Age]]'' web site [https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-holy-grail-of-victorian-insects-rises-from-archives-20130928-2ulag.html]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Researchers have found "the holy grail of entomology" - a long-lost guide to Victoria's insects written by pioneer researcher Charles French.

The handwritten manuscript, beautifully illustrated with artwork by Charles Brittlebank and LC Vald Anderson, describes the state's bug life before insecticides were used. - Bridie Smith, ''The Age'', 29 September 2013.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File: Nests and eggs of Australian birds, including the geographical distribution of the species and popular observations thereon (1901) (14563488510).jpg |thumb|&lt;small&gt;Rose-breasted Robin, by CC Brittlebank, 1896, for ''Nests and eggs of Australian birds'' by AJ Campbell, printed in 1900&lt;/small&gt;]]

Recognition for his many and varied accomplishments in the field of natural history came to Brittlebank long before his official appointment as Government Plant Pathologist. Some of the significant milestones of his scientific life include the following:

* '''1894''': Brittlebank discovered the first evidences of Ice Age glaciation in the Werribee Gorge.  In collaboration with Professor Sir Edgeworth David and Mr George Sweet, he published many scientific papers on the Gorge, making it a famous Australian locality for the study of glacial geology.&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;Morrison C 1945, 'Obituary Mr C. C. Brittlebank', ''Wild Life'', v. 7, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1896''': the founding meeting of the Australasian Ornithologists’ Union was held at Britannia House, South Yarra, Melbourne, Victoria, on 15 August.  Both Charles and his brother Thomas Brittlebank were present with 18 other naturalists, including [[Archibald James Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;‘The Australasian Ornithologists Union: its origin’, 1901, ''The emu'', v. 1, part 1, pp. 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1900''': publication of Brittlebank's illustrations in Charles French's ''A Handbook of the Destructive Insects of Victoria'' published 1891-1900;  and Archibald James Campbell's ''Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds'', published 1900.&lt;ref name=BMEx&gt;'Myrniong’, ''Bacchus Marsh Express'', 31 March 1894, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1908''': appointed as Assistant to the highly-acclaimed Australian Government Botanist Daniel McAlpine (1849–1932).&lt;ref name=BMEx /&gt;
* '''1913-1924''': appointed as Plant Pathologist, Victorian Department of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, GJ 2006, 'McAlpine, Daniel (1849 - 1932)', ''Encyclopedia of Australian Science'', accessed 18 Dec 2017, url: http://www.eoas.info/biogs/P000586b.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fish, S 1976, 'Daniel McAlpine: a pioneer plant pathologist of Australia', ''Australian Plant Pathology Society Newsletter'', v. 5, no. 1, pp. 11-13.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he published more than two dozen scholarly papers, and set up a diagnostic and consultative service for the primary producers of Victoria.&lt;ref name=Fish&gt;Fish, S 1970, 'The History of plant pathology in Australia', ''Annual Revue of Phytopathology'', v. 8, pp. 13-36.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1923-1928''': lectured on fungus diseases of fruit, at the Burnley School of Horticulture, and on plant pathology, at the School of Agriculture, University of Melbourne.&lt;ref name=BMEx /&gt;
* '''1924-1928''': appointed as Biologist-in-Charge of the Science Branch, Australian Department of Agriculture.&lt;ref name=BMEx /&gt;
* '''1928''': officially retired from full-time paid employment
* '''1928-1945''' continued to conduct research and participate in the science of natural history; prepared an 11-part manuscript of a ''Catalogue of Australian Fungi'', which is held by CSIRO Black Mountain Library. He also completed an ''Index of Australian fungi and fungus diseases'', commissioned by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and circulated in manuscript to a select number of people.&lt;ref name=BMEx /&gt;

== Final years ==
[[File:Brittlebank Family Grave.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Brittlebank family grave, in Maddingley General Cemetery, Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, Australia|Brittlebank Family Grave, Maddingley General Cemetery, Bacchus Marsh]]
Charles Brittlebank's brother Thomas lost his wife, Marion, in July 1932, and Charles himself became widowed in 1935 when Sarah died.  After that time the brothers both lived at No. 48 York Street, Caulfield, near Melbourne.

Charles pre-deceased his younger brother by three years, dying in 1945, aged 83.  He is buried in the family grave in the Maddingley Central Cemetery, in Bacchus Marsh, Victoria.  The cemetery has been in use since the 1860s.  The Brittlebank grave also holds four other relatives of Charles, as follows:

* Ellen Sarah (nee Leese), died 1906 aged 69, mother 
* Marion Margaret (nee Myers), died 1931 aged 63, sister in law
* Sarah Jane (nee Palmer), died 1935 aged 73, wife
* Charles Clifton, died 1945 aged 83
* Thomas Andrew, died 1948 aged 83, brother

&lt;/Gallery&gt;

''' Obituaries'''
An insight into his character is found in the tribute to him from his colleague and successor Stanislaus Fish: &lt;Blockquote&gt;I worked with him for 3 years before he retired as a plant pathologist, [he was also an] artist, naturalist, successful farmer, professional boxer, and no mean golfer - an unforgettable character. - S. Fish, ''Annual Revue of Phytopathology'', 1970.&lt;ref name=Fish /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regret at the loss of a good friend, and appreciation for his contribution to science are also evident in other obituaries, such as that in ''Wild Life'' and in the ''Victorian Naturalist'':

&lt;blockquote&gt; he had not only left his mark upon Victorian natural history as a leading authority on fungi, but he had wide natural history interests, and was such a fine scientific draughtsman and water colorist that his services were always in demand when accurate, delicate and tasteful scientific illustrations were required. - C. Morrison, ''Wild Life'', 1945.&lt;ref name=Morrison /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; As a token of appreciation for his friend, the senior C. French, first Government Entomologist and founder of this [Field Naturalists’] Club, Brittlebank prepared a large series of water-colour drawings featuring every beetle that had been scientifically named after French.  These framed drawings, which cover seven large sheets of drawing paper, came into the possession of C. French junior, who had succeeded his father as Entomologist, and who later succeeded his friend Brittlebank as [Government] Biologist.  Mr French recently presented these beautiful illustrations to the National Museum where they will be exhibited as a permanent memorial to both men. - EE Prescott, ''Victorian Naturalist'', 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Prescott, EE 1946, 'The late Charles C Brittlebank', ''Victorian Naturalist'', v. 62: p.189&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Daniel Delander''' (died 1733), also known as De Lander or Delaunder, was a notable London clock and watch maker coming from a dynasty of clockmakers.

== Biography ==
Successor to Nathaniel Delander, Daniel Delander was apprenticed in 1692 to Charles Halstead and, later, to [[Thomas Tompion]]; he became a member of the [[Clockmakers' Company]] in 1699.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uuA1AQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;ots=pH-fF7ildZ&amp;dq=Daniel%20Delander%20English%20clockmaker&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Old English Clocks (the Wetherfield Collection) by David Arthur Fasham Wetherfield]&lt;/ref&gt; He opened his own shop at the Dial in [[Devereux Court]] in 1706 and worked there until 1712. Then he relocated to [[Temple Bar, London|Two Temple Gates]] where he stayed until 1717, and finally he moved to [[Fleet Street]], where he toiled until his death in 1733. Delander invented the lock spring for securing watch cases and was the first to produce an independent centre seconds stopwatch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walwynantiqueclocks.com/clock-news/a-biography-of-the-clockmaker-daniel-delander-2670 A biography of the clockmaker Daniel Delander], 26 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Delander also built many [[mantel clock]]s and [[longcase clock]]s. His son Nathaniel Delander II continued the family tradition.

== Legacy ==
There are clocks by Delander at the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] and [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall Museum]] in [[London]] and at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dd_WCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;ots=7k0mx7ZOcD&amp;dq=Daniel%20Delander%20English%20clockmaker&amp;pg=PA150#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false European Clocks and Watches in The Metropolitan Museum of Art by Clare Vincent and Jan Hendrik Leopold]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Museum]] (Ilbert Collection) has the oldest independent-seconds watch, built by Delander in 1720.&lt;ref&gt;[[Museo Galileo]].

In [[analytical chemistry]], '''dark current''' refers to the constant response produced by a spectrochemical receptor, even in the absence of radiation. This response adds to the signal produced when the receptor is used to measure [[light]] and so must be dealt with to determine how much of the detector response is actually due to the radiation. To compensate for this extra signal, the dark current may be measured in the absence of radiation and then subtracted from the final signal or reduced to zero by a compensating [[Electronic circuit|circuit]]. Dealing with dark current is a form of [[Blank (solution)|blank correction]].

'''Duban''' is a [[Impact crater|crater]] in the northern hemisphere of [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]].  Duban was first seen in ''[[Voyager 2]]'' images, though the crater has also been seen in much higher resolution ''[[Cassini-Huygens Mission|Cassini]]'' images.  It is located at {{Coord|58.38|N|282.91|W|globe:enceladus}} and is 19&amp;nbsp;kilometers across.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{Gpn|1652|Duban}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the ''Cassini'' image, evidence for significant tectonic deformation can be seen along the northwest rim of the crater. 

[[Duban (disambiguation)|Duban]] is named after a sage who cured [[King Yunan]] of [[leprosy]] in ''[[Arabian Nights]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8799">'''Eco-innovation''' is the development of products and processes that contribute to [[sustainable development]], applying the commercial application of knowledge to elicit direct or indirect ecological improvements. This includes a range of related ideas, from [[environmentally friendly]] technological advances to socially acceptable innovative paths towards [[sustainability]]. The field of research that seeks to explain how, why, and at what rate new "ecological" [[Idea|ideas]] and [[technology]] spread is called [[eco-innovation diffusion]].

==Concept==

The idea of eco-innovation is fairly recent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Díaz-García|first=Cristina|last2=González-Moreno|first2=Ángela|last3=Sáez-Martínez|first3=Francisco J.|date=2015|title=Eco-innovation: insights from a literature review|journal=Innovation: Management, Policy &amp; Practice|volume=17|issue=1|pages=6–23|doi=10.1080/14479338.2015.1011060|issn=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first appearances of the concept of eco-innovation in the literature is in the book by Claude Fussler and Peter James.&lt;ref&gt;Fussler, C. &amp; P. James, 1996; ''Driving Eco-Innovation: A Breakthrough Discipline for Innovation and Sustainability'', Pitman Publishing: London, 364 p.&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent article, Peter James defines eco-innovation as "new products and processes which provide customer and business value but significantly decrease environmental impacts".&lt;ref name="james"&gt;James, P., 1997; 'The Sustainability Circle: a new tool for product development and design', ''Journal of Sustainable Product Design'' 2: 52:57, http://www.cfsd.org.uk/journal&lt;/ref&gt; Klaus Rennings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rennings|first=Klaus|date=2000|title=Redefining innovation - eco-innovation research and the contribution from ecological economics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800999001123|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=32|issue=2|pages=319–332|doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(99)00112-3|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduces the term eco-innovation addressing explicitly three kinds of changes towards sustainable development: technological, social and institutional innovation.

Eco-innovation is closely linked to a variety of related concepts. It is often used interchangeably with "[[environmental innovation]]", and is also often linked with [[environmental technology]], [[eco-efficiency]], [[Ecodesign|eco-design]], [[environmental design]], [[sustainable design]], or [[sustainable innovation]]. While the term "environmental innovation" is used in similar contexts to "eco-innovation", the other terms are mostly used when referring to product or process design, and therefore focus more on the technological aspects of eco-innovation rather than the societal or political aspects. [[Ecovation]] is the process by which responsible capitalism aligns with ecological innovation to construct products which have a generative nature and are recyclable back into the environment for usage in other industries.

===As a technological term===

The most common usage of the term "eco-innovation" is to refer to [[innovative]] products and processes that reduce environmental impacts. This is often used in conjunction with eco-efficiency and eco-design. Leaders in many industries have been developing innovative technologies in order to work towards [[sustainability]]. However, these are not always practical, or enforced by policy and legislation.

===As a social process===

Another position held (for example, by the organisation [http://www.eco-innovation.net Eco Innovation]) is that this definition should be complemented: eco-innovations should also bring greater social and cultural acceptance. In this view, this "social pillar" added to James's&lt;ref name="james" /&gt; definition is necessary because it determines learning and the effectiveness of eco-innovations. This approach gives eco-innovations a social component, a status that is more than a new type of commodity, or a new sector, even though [[environmental technology]] and eco-innovation are associated with the emergence of new economic activities or even branches (e.g., [[waste treatment]], [[recycling]], etc.). This approach considers eco-innovation in terms of usage rather than merely in terms of product. The social pillar associated with eco-innovation introduces a governance component that makes eco-innovation a more integrated tool for [[sustainable development]].

== Diffusion ==
Literature in the field of eco-innovations often focuses on policy, regulations, technology, market and firm specific factors rather than [[Diffusion of innovations|diffusion]]. However, understanding of [[diffusion of eco-innovations]] recently has gained more importance given the fact that some eco-innovations are already at a mature stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karakaya|first=Emrah|last2=Hidalgo|first2=Antonio|last3=Nuur|first3=Cali|date=2014|title=Diffusion of eco-innovations: A review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032114001051|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=33|issue=|pages=392–399|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2014.01.083|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survey research shows that most customers hold positive attitudes towards various types of eco-innovations. At the same time, adoption rates of solutions such as dynamic electricity tariffs remain unsatisfactorily low.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kowalska-Pyzalska|first=A.|date=2015|title=Social acceptance of green energy and dynamic electricity tariffs - A short review|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=7477192|journal=2015 Modern Electric Power Systems (MEPS)|volume=|issue=|pages=1–7|doi=10.1109/MEPS.2015.7477192|pmid=|access-date=|via=|isbn=978-1-5090-3101-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NIMBY|"Not In My Back Yard" (NIMBY)]] concept is often used to describe what at first seems to be a confusing [[intention-behavior gap]] between high levels of public support for eco-innovations and frequent non-engagement or even local hostility towards specific project proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Renewable energy and the public: from NIMBY to participation|last=|first=|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Devine-Wright|editor-first=Patrick|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social psychology and economic behavior models could and should be used to overcome these challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gyamfi|first=Samuel|last2=[[Susan Krumdieck|Krumdieck]]|first2=Susan|last3=Urmee|first3=Tania|date=2013|title=Residential peak electricity demand response—Highlights of some behavioural issues|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032113002578|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=25|issue=|pages=71–77|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2013.04.006|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byrka|first=Katarzyna|last2=Jȩdrzejewski|first2=Arkadiusz|last3=Sznajd-Weron|first3=Katarzyna|last4=Weron|first4=Rafał|date=2016|title=Difficulty is critical: The importance of social factors in modeling diffusion of green products and practices|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136403211630096X|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=62|issue=|pages=723–735|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2016.04.063|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrostatic-pneumatic MEMS devices usually consist of two membranes with a sealed cavity in between.

With direct electrostatic actuation on membrane, a concave shape is achieved.

The '''European Pulsar Timing Array''' ('''EPTA''') is a European collaboration to combine five 100-m class radio-telescopes to observe an array of [[pulsars]] with the specific goal of detecting [[gravitational waves]]. It is one of three pulsar timing array projects in operation, the others being the [[Parkes Pulsar Timing Array]] and the [[North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves]].

==Pulsars and high-precision timing==
[[Pulsars]] are rapidly rotating, highly magnetised [[neutron stars]] that emit radio waves from their magnetic poles that are, due to the star's rotation, observed on Earth as a string of pulses. Due to the extremely high density of neutron stars, their rotation periods are very stable, hence the observed arrival time of the pulses are highly regular. These arrival times are called TOAs (time of arrival) and can be used to perform high-precision timing experiments.

The stability of the TOAs from most pulsars is limited due to the presence of [[red noise]], also called "timing noise".&lt;ref&gt;Z. Arzoumanian, D.J. Nice, J.H. Taylor, and S.E. Thorsett. "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=1994ApJ...422..671A&amp;link_type=ARTICLE&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high= Timing behavior of 96 radio pulsars]." ''The Astrophysical Journal,'' volume 422, February 1994 (pages 671-680).&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a special class of pulsars, called millisecond pulsars (MSP), that are shown to suffer from little or no timing noise.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Keeping track of the TOAs of different MSPs over the sky allows for a high-precision timing experiment to detect [[gravitational waves]].

==Detection of gravitational waves==
[[Gravitational waves]] (GW) are small disturbances in space-time, caused by the motion of masses, if the third time derivative of the mass quadrupole moment is non-zero. These waves are very weak, such that only the strongest waves, caused by the rapid motion of dense stars or black-holes, have a chance of being detected. A pulsar timing array (PTA) uses an array of MSPs as the endpoints of a Galaxy-scale [[Gravitational wave detector|GW detector]]. It is sensitive to GWs with a frequency in the nanohertz regime, which corresponds to the regime where the stochastic GW background, caused by the coalescence of super-massive black holes in the early Universe, is predicted to exist.{{citation needed|date = July 2013}} This makes PTAs complementary to other GW detectors such as [[LIGO]], [[Virgo interferometer|VIRGO]] and [[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna|LISA]].

==Telescopes==
The EPTA uses five European telescopes. These are the [[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope]], the [[Effelsberg Radio Telescope]], the [[Lovell Telescope]], the [[Nançay Radio Telescope]] and the [[Sardinia Radio Telescope]].

Since 2009, the EPTA has made some progress thanks to a project [[European Research Council]] funded project known as the Large European Array for Pulsars (LEAP). The aim of this project is to coherently combine the five EPTA telescopes to synthesise the equivalent of a fully steerable 194-m dish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leap.eu.org/ The Large European Array for Pulsars]&lt;/ref&gt; This will improve the accuracy with which the pulsar TOAs can be measured by an order of magnitude, essential for the first detection of [[gravitational waves]] within the next decade.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

'''Flora''' is the [[plant]] life occurring in a particular region or time, generally the naturally occurring or [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]]—[[native plant]] life. The corresponding term for [[animal]] life is [[fauna]]. ''Flora'', ''fauna'' and other forms of [[Kingdom (biology)|life]] such as [[fungus|fungi]] are collectively referred to as [[Biota (taxonomy)|biota]]. Sometimes [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] are also referred to as flora, as in the terms [[gut flora]] or [[skin flora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=flora|title=Merriam Webster Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/bitn/97-007/pdf/bitn97-007.pdf|author1=Clifford E.

==Etymology==
The word "flora" comes from the [[Latin]] name of [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]], the [[goddess]] of [[plant]]s, [[flower]]s, and fertility in [[Roman mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rengel|first1=Kathleen N. Daly ; revised by Marian|last2=Daly|first2=Kathleen|title=Greek and Roman mythology, A to Z|date=2009|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|location=New York|isbn=1604134127|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=may be the other way round, i.e. the goddess was named using a pre-existing word for flowers|date=December 2015}}

The distinction between [[vegetation]] (the general appearance of a community) and flora (the taxonomic composition of a community) was first made by [[Jules Thurmann]] (1849). Prior to this, the two terms were used indiscriminately.&lt;ref&gt;Thurmann, J. (1849). ''Essai de Phytostatique appliqué à la chaîne du Jura et aux contrées voisines.'' Berne: Jent et Gassmann, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/51540#/summary].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martins"&gt;Martins, F. R. &amp; Batalha, M. A. (2011). Formas de vida, espectro biológico de Raunkiaer e fisionomia da vegetação. In: Felfili, J. M., Eisenlohr, P. V.; Fiuza de Melo, M. M. R.; Andrade, L. A.; Meira Neto, J. A. A. (Org.). ''Fitossociologia no Brasil: métodos e estudos de caso.'' Vol. 1. Viçosa: Editora UFV. p. 44-85. [http://files.hisaias.webnode.com/200000112-37f2239e9a/Cap%202.pdf]. Earlier version, 2003, [http://www2.ib.unicamp.br/profs/fsantos/bt682/2003/Apostila-FormasVida-2003.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora classifications==

Plants are grouped into floras based on region ([[Phytochorion|floristic regions]]), period, special environment, or climate. Regions can be  distinct [[habitat]]s like mountain vs. flatland. Floras can mean plant life of a historic era as in ''fossil flora''. Lastly, floras may be subdivided by special environments:

*''Native flora''. The native and indigenous flora of an area.
*''Agricultural and horticultural flora (garden flora)''. The plants that are deliberately grown by humans.
*''Weed flora''. Traditionally this classification was applied to plants regarded as undesirable, and studied in efforts to control or eradicate them.  Today the designation is less often used as a classification of plant life, since it includes three different types of plants: [[weed]]y species, [[invasive species]] (that may or may not be weedy), and native and introduced non-weedy species that are agriculturally undesirable.  Many native plants previously considered weeds have been shown to be beneficial or even necessary to various [[ecosystem]]s.

==Documentation of floras==
[[File:WGSRPD World.svg|thumb|upright=2|The botanical continents of the [[World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions]], used for classifying floras geographically]]
{{main article|Flora (publication)}}
&lt;!-- Images Begin --&gt;
[[File:Floristic regions in Europe (english).png|thumb|right|Floristic regions in Europe according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer Lösch]]
&lt;!-- Images End --&gt;

The flora of a particular area or time period can be documented in a publication also known as a "[[Flora (publication)|flora]]" (often capitalized as "Flora" to distinguish the two meanings when they might be confused). Floras may require specialist botanical knowledge to use with any effectiveness. Traditionally they are [[book]]s, but some are now published on [[CD-ROM]] or [[website]]s.

It is said that the ''[[Flora Sinensis]]'' by the Polish [[Jesuit]] [[Michał Boym]] was the first book that used the name "Flora" in this meaning, a book covering the plant world of a region.&lt;ref name=boym&gt;[http://webapps.fundp.ac.be/moretus/flora_sinensis/index_flora_sinensis.html Flora Sinensis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206180105/http://webapps.fundp.ac.be/moretus/flora_sinensis/index_flora_sinensis.html |date=2010-02-06 }} (access to the facsimile of the book, its French translation, and an article about it)&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite its title it covered not only plants, but also some animals of the region.

A published flora often contains diagnostic keys. Often these are  [[identification key|''dichotomous'' keys]], which require the user to repeatedly examine a plant, and decide which one of two alternatives given best applies to the plant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3072">'''George Alexander Ehrman''' (2 February 1862,[[Pittsburgh]]- 30 January, 1926,Pittsburgh) was an [[United States|American]] [[entomologist]] who specialised in  [[Lepidoptera]] notably [[Papilionidae]].

Ehrman invented equipment which came into general use in the manufacture of blown and pressed glass for the [[Macbeth-Evans Glass Company]] and the [[United States Glass Company]]. In later years he was employed in the Research Laboratory of the [[Mesta Machinery|Mesta Machine Company]].

Financially secure Ehrman was able during his later life to devote himself to [[natural history]] including [[ornithology]]. He made extensive collections of the Lepidoptera and Coleoptera of western Pennsylvania then extended his 
collections worldwide. He specialised in [[Papilionidae]], the genus ''[[Catocala]]'', and the butterflies and moths of 
[[Liberia]], and the beetle genus ''[[Cychrus]]'' and its allies.

His collection of American und exotic Rhopalocera and Coleoptera was bequeathed to the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]].The species described by him are listed by Holland (1927) &lt;ref&gt;Holland, W. J., 1927. The Lepidoptera named by George A.  Ehrmann. ''Annals of the Carnegie Museum'', 17 No.2, Art. 10, Pittsburgh, pp. 299-364.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geuda''' ({{lang|si|ගෙවුඩ}}, pronounced gay-yoo-dah) is a form of the mineral [[corundum]], or [[sapphire]], found primarily in [[Sri Lanka]]. Around 70%-80% of gems mined in Sri Lanka belong to geuda varieties.   Because of its semitransparent and milky appearance due to [[rutile]] inclusions, these stones have little value as gemstones in their natural state.

Geuda was frequently stored in large drums or used to gravel home gardens prior to the 1970s discovery that heat treatment can drastically alter the stone's color.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M Voynick, Yogo: The Great American Sapphire.  Mountain Press Publishing Company, Missoula.  1985&lt;/ref&gt;  

Some geuda varieties turn to a blue color after heat treatments. Others turn to red after oxidizing. Kowangu pushparaga turns to yellow sapphire after oxidizing. After heating geuda to roughly 1800&amp;nbsp;°C, the [[aluminium oxide]] lattice-work of the gem is disrupted and cooling greatly improves both color and clarity.  Though many stones are destroyed by the heating and cooling process, those that survive are significantly altered and rival naturally blue sapphires in both appearance and price.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

}}'''Herbert Alois Wagner''' (22 May 1900, [[Graz]], [[Austria]] - 28 May 1982 in [[Newport Beach, California]], USA) was an Austrian scientist who developed numerous innovations in the fields of [[aerodynamics]], aircraft structures and [[guided weapons]]. He is most famous for Wagner's function describing [[Unsteady flow|unsteady lift]] on wings and developing the [[Henschel Hs 293]] [[glide bomb]].

==Early life==
Wagner attended the Austrian Naval Academy from 1914 to 1917 and served as an Ensign in the [[Austrian Navy]] during World War I.  He survived the sinking of his ship after it was struck by an enemy torpedo. After the war he returned to his studies, earning a doctorate from the [[Technical University of Berlin]] when he was only 23. His doctoral thesis entitled "Origin of the dynamic lift of wings"&lt;ref&gt;Ernst-Heinrich Hirschel, Horst Prem, Gero Madelung, "Aeronautical research in Germany: from Lilienthal until today", Volume 147. Springer, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; contained the solution of one of fundamental unsteady aerodynamics problems concerned with lift force on wings that are suddenly set into motion. The result later became known as "Wagner's function".

In the mid-1920s he worked for [[Rohrbach Metall-Flugzeugbau]] on new designs for [[flying boat]]s. During that time he also invented the so-called ''Wagner beam'',&lt;ref&gt;Based on a discovery related in the article "Über die Entstehung des dynamischen Auftriebes von Tragflügeln", ''Zeitschrift für angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik'' 5(1925) pp. 17-35, commonly known as the ''Wagner effect'', also known among [[Entomology|entomologists]].&lt;/ref&gt; a method of constructing aircraft structural components from sheet metal. Following a short stint as a professor at the [[Technical University of Berlin]], he returned to industry at [[Junkers|Junkers Flugzeugwerke]], helping to design aircraft and aircraft engines working together with [[Hans von Ohain]]. There he played an instrumental role in the development of the first [[jet engine]]s. He left Junkers following a disagreement with the management, and settled at [[Henschel &amp; Son|Henschel Flugzeugwerke]] in Berlin.

==World War II Research==
Wagner helped the computer pioneer [[Konrad Zuse]] as an intermediary concerning orders that Zuse got from the [[Ministry of Aviation (Germany)|Reich Ministry of Aviation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.3929/ethz-a-006313025 Konrad Zuse und die ETH Zürich], page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Henschel, Wagner began to study remotely controlled aircraft. In July 1940 he began work on a prototype [[glide bomb]] that could be used to attack thinly armored warships and merchant ships. This ultimately evolved into the [[Hs 293]] [[guided missile]], used with considerable effectiveness in late 1943 and early 1944. Several notable successes were achieved, including the first sinking of a ship by a remotely controlled weapon, the destruction of [[HMS Egret (L75)|HMS Egret]] on 27 August 1943.  Another notable success for the Hs 293 was the sinking of the transport [[HMT Rohna]] with the loss of over 1000 soldiers, sailors and crewmen.

However, the Allies developed several [[electronic countermeasures]] against the Hs 293 and other radio guides weapons, such as electronic jammers. Those and the increasing Allied air superiority prevented the Hs 293 from having any significant impact in the later war years.

He also designed the [[Henschel Hs 117]] ''Schmetterling'' surface-to-air guided missile.

==Post-War Activities==
After the war, Wagner was the first of many German scientists brought to America as part of [[Operation Paperclip]], arriving at Frederick, Maryland on 18 May 1945 with seven large cases of blueprints and other technical data.&lt;ref&gt;Clarence G. Lasby, ''Project Paperclip: German Scientists and the Cold War'' (New York: Atheneum, 1971), 3&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner and his team were moved to the Special Devices Center, a U.S.-Navy run research unit housed at the Castle Gould and Hempstead House, the former estate of [[Daniel Guggenheim|Daniel and Florence Guggenheim]] at Sands Point, Long Island. There he supported U.S. efforts to deploy glide bombs against Japan.

Wagner then moved to the new [[Naval Air Station Point Mugu|Naval Air Missile Test Center]] in Point Mugu, California, the centerpiece of the U.S. Navy's research into guided missiles. There he helped develop the control mechanisms for advanced missiles, several of which remain (in upgraded forms) in service today. A formerly classified FBI counterintelligence report describes his approach to his work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
An excellent German scientist of good character and who is not interested in politics... He has given no evidence of being either pro-Nazi or pro-Communist and is disinterested politically... Once belonged to the German SS for a four week’s instruction course but dropped out of same on his own volition... Is an opportunist who is interested only in science and does not subscribe to any political ideology... Since the death of his wife, Wagner has been drinking considerably but is not a drunkard.&lt;ref&gt;His abridged FBI file is available through the US National Archives and Records Administration, College Park, Maryland. Record Group 65 (Records of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]). "FBI HQ: Investigative Reports; Classified Subject Files. Released under the Nazi and Japanese War Crimes Disclosure Acts. Classification 105: Foreign Counterintelligence. File 105-10525 for Herbert Alois Wagner.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wagner left US government service and formed his own technical consulting firm, HA Wagner Company.  He sold this company to [[Curtiss-Wright]] in 1957 and returned to Germany to take up a position as professor of Technical Mechanics and Space Technology at the [[RWTH Aachen]]. He continued to serve as technical advisor to several U.S. defense companies during this period. Wagner was awarded the [[Ludwig-Prandtl-Ring]] from the [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Luft- und Raumfahrt]] (German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics) for "outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering" in 1980. He died aged 82 on 28 May 1982.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20515">The history of [[Experiment|experimental research]] is long and varied. Indeed, the definition of an experiment itself has changed in responses to changing norms and practices within particular fields of study. This article documents the history and development of experimental research from its origins in [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo's]] study of gravity into the diversely applied method in use today.

==Ibn al-Haytham==
[[File:Thesaurus_opticus_Titelblatt.jpg|thumb|right|"How does light travel through transparent bodies? Light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only.... We have explained this exhaustively in our ''[[Book of Optics]]''."&lt;ref name=Sambursky /&gt; —[[Alhazen]] ]]

The [[Islamic physics|Arab physicist]] [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) used experimentation to obtain the results in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021). He combined [[observation]]s, [[experiment]]s and [[Rationality|rational]] arguments to support his intromission theory of [[visual perception|vision]], in which [[Ray (optics)|rays]] of [[light]] are emitted from objects rather than from the eyes. He used similar arguments to show that the ancient [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory of vision]] supported by [[Ptolemy]] and [[Euclid]] (in which the eyes emit the rays of light used for seeing), and the ancient [[intromission theory]] supported by [[Aristotle]] (where objects emit physical particles to the eyes), were both wrong.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. C. Lindberg]], ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago, Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 60–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental evidence supported most of the propositions in his ''Book of Optics'' and grounded his theories of vision, light and colour, as well as his research in catoptrics and dioptrics.  His legacy was elaborated through the 'reforming' of his ''Optics'' by [[Kamal al-Din al-Farisi]] (d. c. 1320) in the latter's ''Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir'' (''The Revision of'' [Ibn al-Haytham's] ''Optics'').&lt;ref&gt;Nader El-Bizri, "A Philosophical Perspective on Alhazen’s Optics," ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy'', Vol. 15, Issue 2 (2005), pp. 189–218 (Cambridge University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nader El-Bizri, "Ibn al-Haytham," in ''Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia'', eds. Thomas F. Glick, Steven J. Livesey, and Faith Wallis (New York – London: Routledge, 2005), pp. 237–240.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen viewed his scientific studies as a search for [[truth]]: "Truth is sought for its own sake. And those who are engaged upon the quest for anything for its own sake are not interested in other things. Finding the truth is difficult, and the road to it is rough. ...&lt;ref&gt;Alhazen (Ibn Al-Haytham) ''Critique of Ptolemy'', translated by S. Pines, ''Actes X Congrès internationale d'histoire des sciences'', Vol '''I''' Ithaca 1962, as referenced on p.139 of Shmuel Sambursky (ed. 1974) ''Physical Thought from the Presocratics to the Quantum Physicists'' {{ISBN|0-87663-712-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen's work included the conjecture that "Light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only", which he was able to corroborate only after years of effort. He stated, "[This] is clearly observed in the lights which enter into dark rooms through holes. ... the entering light will be clearly observable in the dust which fills the air."&lt;ref name=Sambursky&gt;Alhazen, translated into English from German by M. Schwarz, from "Abhandlung über das Licht", J. Baarmann (ed. 1882) ''[[Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft]]'' Vol '''36''' as referenced on p.136 by Shmuel Sambursky (1974) ''Physical thought from the Presocratics to the Quantum Physicists'' {{ISBN|0-87663-712-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also demonstrated the conjecture by placing a straight stick or a taut thread next to the light beam.&lt;ref&gt;p.136, as quoted by Shmuel Sambursky (1974) ''Physical thought from the Presocratics to the Quantum Physicists'' {{ISBN|0-87663-712-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn al-Haytham also employed [[scientific skepticism]] and emphasized the role of [[empiricism]]. He also explained the role of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] in [[syllogism]], and criticized [[Aristotle]] for his lack of contribution to the method of induction, which Ibn al-Haytham regarded as superior to syllogism, and he considered induction to be the basic requirement for true scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Plott |first=C. |year=2000 |title=Global History of Philosophy: The Period of Scholasticism |isbn=81-208-0551-8 |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |page=462 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Something like [[Occam's razor]] is also present in the ''Book of Optics''. For example, after demonstrating that light is generated by luminous objects and emitted or reflected into the eyes, he states that therefore "the [[Emission theory (vision)|extramission]] of [visual] rays is superfluous and useless."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Alhacen's Theory of Visual Perception: A Critical Edition, with English Translation and Commentary of the First Three Books of Alhacen's De Aspectibus, the Medieval Latin Version of Ibn al-Haytham's Kitab al-Manazir|last1=[[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]]|first2=A.  Mark|last2=Smith|year=2001|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=0-87169-914-1|pages=372 &amp; 408}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may also have been the first scientist to adopt a form of [[positivism]] in his approach. He wrote that "we do not go beyond experience, and we cannot be content to use pure concepts in investigating natural phenomena", and that the understanding of these cannot be acquired without mathematics. After assuming that light is a material substance, he does not further discuss its nature but confines his investigations to the diffusion and propagation of light. The only properties of light he takes into account are those treatable by geometry and verifiable by experiment.&lt;ref name=Rashed&gt;{{Citation |last=Rashed |first=Roshdi |year=2007 |title=The Celestial Kinematics of Ibn al-Haytham |journal=Arabic Sciences and Philosophy |volume=17 |pages=7–55 [19] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |doi=10.1017/S0957423907000355 }}: {{quote|"In reforming optics he, as it were, adopted ‘‘positivism’’ (before the term was invented): we do not go beyond experience, and we cannot be content to use pure concepts in investigating natural phenomena.

Thus, once he has assumed light is a material substance, Ibn al-Haytham does not discuss its nature further, but confines himself to considering its propagation and diffusion. In his optics ‘‘the smallest parts of light’’, as he calls them, retain only properties that can be treated by geometry and verified by experiment; they lack all sensible qualities except energy."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Galileo Galilei==

[[Image:Drop time.jpg|thumb|300px|right| Measured fall time of a small steel sphere falling from various heights. The data is in good agreement with the predicted fall time of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2h/g}&lt;/math&gt;, where h is the height and g is the acceleration of gravity.]]

[[Galileo Galilei]] was a scientist who performed many quantitative experiments by addressing many topics. Using several different methods, Galileo was able to accurately measure time. Previously, most scientists had used distance to describe falling bodies using [[geometry]], which had been used and trusted since [[Euclid]].&lt;ref&gt;Drake, Stillman; Swerdlow, Noel M.; Levere, Trevor Hardly. Essays on Galileo and the history and philosophy of science, Volume 3. Page 22. University of Toronto Press. 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-8020-4716-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo himself used geometrical methods to express his results. Galileo's successes were aided by the development of a new mathematics as well as cleverly designed experiments and equipment. At that time, another kind of mathematics was being developed—[[algebra]]. Algebra allowed arithmetical calculations to become as sophisticated as geometric ones. Algebra also allowed the discoveries of scientists such as Galileo—as well as later scientists like [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] and [[Einstein]]—to be later summarized by mathematical [[equations]]. These equations described physical relationships in a precise, self-consistent manner.

One prominent example is the "ball and ramp experiment."&lt;ref&gt;Solway, Andrew. Exploring forces and motion. Page 17. The Rosen Publishing Group. 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-4042-3747-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this experiment Galileo used an inclined plane and several steel balls of different weights. With this design, Galileo was able to slow down the falling motion and record, with reasonable accuracy, the times at which a steel ball passed certain markings on a beam.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, James. Redlin, Lothar. Watson, Saleem. College Algebra. Page 562. Cengage Learning. 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-495-56521-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Galileo disproved Aristotle's assertion that weight affects the speed of an object's fall. According to Aristotle's Theory of Falling Bodies, the heavier steel ball would reach the ground before the lighter steel ball. Galileo's hypothesis was that the two balls would reach the ground at the same time.

Other than Galileo, not many people of his day were able to accurately measure short time periods, such as the fall time of an object. Galileo accurately measured these short periods of time by creating a pulsilogon. This was a machine created to measure time using a [[pendulum]].&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Medical Society, New England Surgical Society. The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, Volume 125. Page 314. Cupples, Upham &amp; Co. 1891&lt;/ref&gt; The pendulum was synchronized to the human [[pulse]]. He used this to measure the time at which the weighted balls passed marks that he had made on the inclined plane. He measured to find that balls of different weights reached the bottom of the [[inclined plane]] at the same time and that the distance traveled was proportional to the square of the elapsed time.&lt;ref&gt;Tiner, John Hudson. Exploring the World of Physics: From Simple Machines to Nuclear Energy. New Leaf Publishing Group. 2006.  {{ISBN|0-89051-466-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later scientists summarized Galileo's results as [[Equations for a falling body|The Equation of Falling Bodies]].&lt;ref&gt;Longair, M.S. Theoretical concepts in physics: an alternative view of theoretical reasoning in physics. Page 37. Cambridge University Press. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-521-52878-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schutz, Bernard F. Gravity from the ground up. Page 3. Cambridge University Press. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-521-45506-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These results supported Galileo's hypothesis that objects of different weights, when measured at the same point in their fall, are falling at the same speed because they experience the same gravitational acceleration.

==Antoine Lavoisier==

[[Image:Ice-calorimeter.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Lavoisier and Laplace's ice calorimeter device]]

[[Antoine Lavoisier]] (1743–1794) was a French chemist regarded as the founder of modern chemistry. Lavoisier's experiments were among the first truly quantitative chemical experiments. He showed that, although matter changes its state in a [[chemical reaction]], the quantity of [[matter]] is the same at the end as at the beginning of every chemical reaction. In one experiment, he burned phosphorus and sulfur in air to see whether the results further supported his previous conclusion ([[Law of Conservation of Mass]]). In this experiment, however, he determined that the products weighed more than the original phosphorus and sulfur. He decided to do the experiment again. This time he measured the mass of the air surrounding the experiment as well. He discovered that the mass gained in the product was lost from the air. These experiments provided further support for his [[Law of Conservation of Mass]].

One of Lavoisier's experiments connected the worlds of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and [[combustion]]. Lavoisier's hypothesis was that combustion and respiration were one and the same, and combustion occurs with every instance of respiration. Lavoisier, working with [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], designed an ice [[calorimeter]] apparatus for measuring the amount of heat given off during combustion or respiration. This machine consisted of three concentric compartments. The center compartment held the source of heat, in this case, the [[guinea pig]] or piece of burning [[charcoal]]. The middle compartment held a specific amount of ice for the heat source to melt. The outside compartment contained packed snow for insulation. Lavoisier then measured the quantity of carbon dioxide and the quantity of heat produced by confining a live guinea pig in this apparatus.  Lavoisier also measured the heat and carbon dioxide produced when burning a piece of charcoal in the calorimeter. Using this data, he concluded that respiration was in fact a slow combustion process. He also discovered through precise measurements that these processes produced carbon dioxide and heat with the same constant of proportionality. He found that for 224 grains of "fixed air" (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) produced, {{convert|13|oz|abbr=on}}. of ice was melted in the calorimeter.  Converting grains to grams and using the energy required to melt {{convert|13|oz|abbr=on}}. of ice, one can compute that for each gram of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced, about 2.02 kcal of energy was produced by the combustion of carbon or by respiration in Lavoisier's calorimeter experiments. This compares well with the modern published [[heat of combustion]] for carbon of 2.13 kcal/g.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (1987; p.188) The published value of the [[heat of combustion]] for carbon is usually expressed as 393.5 kJ/mol; unit conversion yields the figure in units for comparison of 2.13 kcal/g&lt;/ref&gt; This continuous slow combustion, which Lavoisier and Laplace supposed took place in the [[lungs]], enabled the living animal to maintain its body temperature above that of its surroundings, thus accounting for the puzzling phenomenon of animal heat.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (1987; p.197)&lt;/ref&gt;  Lavoisier concluded, "Lla respiration est donc une combustion," That is, respiratory gas exchange is combustion, like that of burning a candle.

Lavoisier was the first to conclude by experiment that the [[Law of Conservation of Mass]] applied to chemical change.&lt;ref&gt;Bell (2005; p.44)&lt;/ref&gt; His hypothesis was that  the mass of the reactants would be the same as the mass of the products in a [[chemical reaction]]. He experimented on vinous [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]]. He determined the amounts of [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[carbon]] in [[sugar]]. He weighed a quantity of sugar, added [[yeast]] and [[water]] in measured amounts, and allowed the mixture to ferment.  Lavoisier measured the mass of the carbonic acid gas and water that were given off during fermentation and weighed the residual liquor, the components of which were then separated and analyzed to determine their elementary composition.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (1987; p.382)&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way he controlled a couple of potential confounding factors. He was able to capture the carbonic acid gas and water vapor that were given off during fermentation so that his final measurements would be as accurate as possible. Lavoisier then concluded that the total mass of the reactants was equal to the mass of the final product and residue.&lt;ref&gt;Bell (2005; p.92)&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he showed that the total mass of each constituent element before and after the chemical change remained the same. Similarly, he demonstrated via experimentation that the mass of products of combustion is equal to the mass of the reacting ingredients.

==Louis Pasteur==

[[Image:Experiment Pasteur English.jpg|thumb|(Above) A swannecked flask with broth and no bacteria in it after being boiled to remove any germs or microorganisms. (Below) Another swannecked flask with outside contaminants in the air allowed in. This broth grows microorganisms.]]

The French [[biologist]] [[Louis Pasteur]] (1822-1895), regarded{{by whom|date=August 2014}} as the "Father of microbiological sciences and immunology", worked during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Simmers, Louise. Simmers-Nartker, Karen. Diversified Health Occupations. Page 10. Cengage Learning 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-4180-3021-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He postulated - and supported with experimental results - the idea that disease-causing agents do not spontaneously appear but are alive and need the right environment to prosper and multiply.  Stemming from this discovery, he used experimentation to develop vaccines for [[chicken cholera]], [[anthrax]] and [[rabies]], and to develop methods for reducing [[bacteria]] in some food products by heating them ([[pasteurization]]).  His work also led him to advocate (along with the English physician Dr. [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]]) for antiseptic surgical techniques. Most scientists of that day believed that microscopic life sprang into existence from nonliving matter. This idea was called [[spontaneous generation]].

Pasteur's observations of tiny [[organisms]] under the [[microscope]] caused him to doubt spontaneous generation. He designed an experiment to test it. His [[hypothesis]] was that life could not arise from where there is no life. He took care to control possible confounding factors. For example, he needed to make sure there was no life, even microscopic, in the flasks of broth he used as a test medium. He decided to kill any microscopic organisms already present by boiling the broth until he was confident that any microorganisms present were killed. Pasteur also needed to make sure that no microscopic organisms entered the broth after boiling, yet the broth needed exposure to air to properly test the theory.  A colleague suggested a flask with a neck the shape of an "S" turned sideways. Dust (which Pasteur thought contained microorganisms) would be trapped at the bottom of the first curve, but the air would flow freely through.&lt;ref&gt;Dubos (1986; p.169)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, if bacteria should really be spontaneously generated, then they should be growing in the flask after a few days. If spontaneous generation did not occur, then the contents of the flasks would remain lifeless. The experiment appeared conclusive: not a single microorganism appeared in the broth. Then Pasteur allowed the dust containing the microorganisms to mix with the broth. In just a few days the broth became cloudy from millions of organisms growing in it. For two more years, he repeated the experiment in various conditions and locales to assure himself that the results were correct. In this way Pasteur supported his hypothesis that spontaneous generation does not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Debré, Patrice. Louis Pasteur. Page 300. JHU Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-8018-6529-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the experimental results supporting his hypotheses and his success curing or preventing various diseases, correcting the public misconception of spontaneous generation proved a slow, difficult process.

As he worked to solve specific problems, Pasteur sometimes revised his ideas in the light of the results of his experiments, as when faced with the task of finding the cause of disease devastating the French [[sericulture|silkworm industry]] in 1865.  After a year of diligent work he correctly identified a culprit organism and gave practical advice for developing a healthy population of moths.  However, when he tested his own advice, he found disease still present. It turned out he had been correct but incomplete – there were two organisms at work.  It took two more years of experimenting to find the complete solution.&lt;ref&gt;Dubos (1986; p.210)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inessive case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''ine'''}}; from Latin ''inesse'' "to be in or at") is a [[locative case|locative]] [[grammatical case]].  This case carries the basic meaning of "in": for example, "in the house" is "talo·ssa" in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], "maja·s" in [[Estonian language|Estonian]], "куд·са" (kud·sa) in [[Moksha language|Moksha]], "etxea·n" in [[Basque language|Basque]], "nam·e" in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], "sāt·ā" in [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]] and "ház·ban" in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].

In Finnish the inessive case is typically formed by adding "ssa/ssä".  Estonian adds "s" to the genitive stem. In Moksha, "са" (sa) is added.  In Hungarian, the [[Affix|suffix]] "ban/ben" is most commonly used for inessive case, although many others, such as "on/en/ön" and others are also used, especially with [[cities]].

In the Finnish language, the inessive case is considered the first (in [[Estonian language|Estonian]] the second) of the six locative cases, which correspond to [[wikt:locational|locational]]  [[preposition]]s in [[English (language)|English]].  The remaining five cases are:
{{Wiktionary|inessive case}}
* [[Elative case]] ("out of")
* [[Illative case]] ("into")
* [[Adessive case]] ("on")
* [[Ablative case]] ("off")
* [[Allative case]] ("onto")
* [[Superessive case]] (''on top of, on the surface of'')
==Finnish==

The Finnish inessive uses the suffix -ssa or -ssä (depending on [[vowel harmony]]). It is usually added to nouns and associated adjectives.

It is used in the following ways:

* Expressing the static state of being in something.
::asumme Suome'''ssa''' ''we live in Finland''

* (with time expressions) stating how long something took to be accomplished or done
:possible English translations include ''in, within''
::kahde'''ssa''' vuode'''ssa''' ''within 2 years, during 2 years''

* when two things are closely connected
:English translations can include ''on'' in phrases of this type
::Katja Lehtinen puhelime'''ssa''' ''Katja Lehtinen on the phone''
::sormus on sorme'''ssa'''ni ''the ring is on my finger''

*as an existensial clause with the verb ''olla'' (to be), to express possession of objects
::sanomalehde'''ssä''' on 68 sivua ''the newspaper has 68 pages''

*with the verb ''käydä'', ''vierailla''
::minä käyn baari'''ssa''' ''I visit the bar''

In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], a '''large diffeomorphism''' is an equivalence class of [[diffeomorphism]]s under the equivalence relation where diffeomorphisms that can be continuously connected to each other are in the same equivalence class.

For example, a two-dimensional real [[torus]] has a [[special linear group|SL(2,Z)]] group of large diffeomorphisms by which the one-cycles &lt;math&gt;a,b&lt;/math&gt; of the torus are transformed into their integer linear combinations. This group of large diffeomorphisms is called the [[modular group]].

More generally, for a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] ''S'', the structure of [[homeomorphism|self-homeomorphism]]s up to [[homotopy]] is known as the [[mapping class group]]. It is known (for [[compact space|compact]], [[orientable]] ''S'') that this is isomorphic with the [[automorphism group]] of the [[fundamental group]] of ''S''. This is consistent with the [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] 1 case, stated above, if one takes into account that then the fundamental group is ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, on which the modular group acts as automorphisms (as a subgroup of [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 2 in all automorphisms, since the orientation may also be reverse, by a transformation with determinant &amp;minus;1).

This is a list of [[Chinese garden|Chinese-style gardens]] both within China and elsewhere in the world.

==Greater China==
This list is organized by region within the Greater China region, roughly following the structure laid out by Maggie Keswick in ''The Chinese Garden''. The names of Chinese gardens are very problematic in English; this list aims to capture all the major variants, both in Chinese and in English.

'''Mesotherapy''' (from Greek ''mesos'', "middle", and therapy from Greek ''therapeia'', "to treat medically") is a non-surgical cosmetic medicine treatment. Mesotherapy employs multiple injections of pharmaceutical and homeopathic medications, plant extracts, vitamins, and other ingredients into [[subcutaneous fat]]. Mesotherapy injections allegedly target adipose fat cells, apparently by inducing [[lipolysis]], rupture and cell death among [[adipocyte]]s.&lt;ref name="Rittes &amp; Carriel 2006"/&gt;

==Usage==
There are published studies on the clinical treatments and effects of these medications and numerous cocktails of combined chemical compounds on the body have been reported in Europe and South America for several years. There is no conclusive research proof that these chemical compounds work to target adipose (fat cells) specifically. Cell lysis, resulting from the detergent action of deoxycholic, may account for any clinical effect.&lt;ref name="Rotunda &amp; Kolodney 2006"/&gt;

In 2012, a French laboratory invented a way to insert a treatment of Mesotherapy into a liquid podlet. This podlet is then plugged into a facial steamer which applies the treatment to the user's facial pores via steam. This was the first invention of its kind to enable Mesotherapy treatments directly to consumers within their own home.

==History==
Michel Pistor (1924–2003) performed clinical research and founded the field of mesotherapy.  Multi-national research in intradermal therapy culminated with Pistor's work from 1948 to 1952 in human mesotherapy treatments.  The French press coined the term Mesotherapy in 1958.  The French [[Académie Nationale de Médecine]] recognized Mesotherapy as a Specialty of Medicine in 1987.  The French society of Mesotherapy recognizes its use as treatment for various conditions but makes no mention of its use in plastic surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfmesotherapie.com/en/What-is-that/default.asp?MenuActive=2|title=French Society of Mesotherapy : What's that ?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Popular throughout European countries and South America, mesotherapy is practiced by approximately 18,000 physicians worldwide.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Criticism==
Mesotherapy treatments have been performed throughout Europe, South America, and more recently the United States for over fifty years. However physicians have expressed concern over the efficacy of mesotherapy, arguing that the treatment hasn't been studied enough to make a determination. The primary issue is that mesotherapy for the treatment of cosmetic conditions hasn't been the subject of gold standard clinical trials; however the procedure has been studied for the pain relief of other ailments, such as tendonitis, tendon calcification, dental procedures, cancer, [[cervicobrachialgia]], arthritis, lymphedema, and venous stasis.&lt;ref name="Rotunda &amp; Kolodney 2006"/&gt; Further, there have been case series and numerous medical papers on the mesotherapy as a cosmetic treatment, as well as studies that employ the ingredients used in mesotherapy.&lt;ref name="Rotunda &amp; Kolodney 2006"/&gt;

The other side of the debate is expressed by [[Rod Rohrich]], M.D., Chairman, Dept. of Plastic Surgery, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas: "There is simply no data, no science and no information, to my knowledge, that mesotherapy works." The American Society of Plastic Surgeons issued a position statement not endorsing mesotherapy, but this non-endorsement is the subject of some controversy. Since mesotherapy isn't a surgical treatment but, rather, a non-invasive alternative to plastic surgery, the treatment competes with plastic surgery for the same patients.

The FDA cannot control the use of practitioners injecting various mixtures into patient's bodies because this practice falls under the jurisdiction of state medical boards. This is the case because the mesotherapy is considered a "procedure" by state medical boards. The FDA, on the other hand, is mandated to approve foods, dietary supplements, drugs, vaccines, biological medical products, blood products, medical devices, radiation-emitting devices, veterinary products and cosmetics.

Robin Ashinoff, speaking for the American Academy of Dermatology, says "A simple injection is giving people false hope. Everybody's looking for a quick fix. But there is no quick fix for fat or fat deposits or for cellulite." The American Society for Dermatologic Surgery informed its members in February 2005 that "further study is warranted before this technique can be endorsed."&lt;ref name="Matarasso et al. 2006"/&gt;

Many dermatologists and plastic surgeons are alarmed about the growing profile of mesotherapy. "No one says exactly what they put into the (syringe)," says Naomi Lawrence, a derma-surgeon at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. "One drug they often use, phosphatidylcholine, is unpredictable and causes extreme inflammation and swelling where injected. It is not a benign drug."&lt;ref name="Puente 2004"/&gt;

It is currently banned in a number of South American countries. Even Brazil, which is less strict than the USA in drug approvals, has banned the drug for these purposes.&lt;ref name="Puente 2004"/&gt;

In Australia, an alternative therapy salon is being investigated by the Health Department after several clients developed skin abscesses on the calves, buttocks, thighs, abdomen, shoulders, face and neck from the treatment, with one patient also developing a mycobacterial infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/06/26/2287178.htm|title=Cellulite therapy under investigation|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following undesirable effects observed on several patients of a French practitioner, an official ratification was published in France in April 2011 to ban Mesotherapy as a method for removing fat deposits.
This ban has been canceled in June 2011 by the French Council of State because the investigation proved that these undesirable effects weren’t due to the Mesotherapy itself, but to the fact it had been practiced in bad conditions and without respecting the hygiene principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-etat.fr/node.php?articleid=2372 Conseil d'État : Ordonnance du 17 juin 2011, SARL Cellusonic et autres, Madame Valérie A. et autres&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216205630/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/node.php?articleid=2372 |date=2012-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical studies==
In a prospective study, 10 patients underwent four sessions of facial mesotherapy using multivitamins at monthly intervals. This study found that there was no clinically relevant benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Amin S, Phelps R, Goldberg D | title = Mesotherapy for facial skin rejuvenation: a clinical, histologic, and electron microscopic evaluation | journal = Dermatol Surg | volume = 32 | issue = 12 | pages = 1467–72 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17199654 | doi = 10.1111/j.1524-4725.2006.32353.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deoxycholic acid received FDA approval as an injectable to dissolve submental fat June 2015.  This was based on a Phase III randomized trial of 2600 patients. 68.2% showed a response by measurement of the fat deposit. 81% had mild adverse reactions of bruising, swelling, pain, numbness, erythema, and firmness around the treated area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Deoxycholic acid injectable for submental Fat dissolution.| journal = The Dermatologist| volume = 23 | issue = 5 | page = 8 | year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitinol alloys exhibit two closely related and unique properties: [[shape memory]] effect (SME) and [[superelasticity]] (SE; also called [[pseudoelasticity]], PE). Shape memory is the ability of nitinol to undergo [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] at one temperature, then recover its original, undeformed shape upon heating above its "transformation temperature".  Superelasticity occurs at a narrow temperature range just above its transformation temperature; in this case, no heating is necessary to cause the undeformed shape to recover, and the material exhibits enormous elasticity, some 10-30 times that of ordinary metal.

==History==
The word Nitinol is derived from its composition and its place of discovery: (''Ni''ckel ''Ti''tanium-''N''aval ''O''rdnance ''L''aboratory). [[William J. Buehler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Buehler, W. J. |author2=Gilfrich, J. W. |author3=Wiley, R.

Having found that a 1:1 [[alloy]] of nickel and titanium could do the job, in 1961 he presented a sample at a laboratory management meeting. The sample, folded up like an [[accordion]], was passed around and flexed by the participants. One of them applied heat from his pipe lighter to the sample and, to everyone's surprise, the accordion-shaped strip stretched and took its previous shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Withers|first1=Neil|title=Nitinol|url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/podcasts/nitinol/6710.article|website=Chemistry World|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the potential applications for nitinol were realized immediately, practical efforts to commercialize the alloy did not take place until a decade later. This delay was largely because of the extraordinary difficulty of melting, processing and machining the alloy. Even these efforts encountered financial challenges that were not readily overcome until the 1980s, when these practical difficulties finally began to be resolved.

The discovery of the shape-memory effect in general dates back to 1932, when Swedish chemist [[Arne Ölander]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Ölander, A. | title = An Electrochemical Investigation of Solid Cadmium-Gold Alloys | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | year = 1932 | volume = 54 | issue = 10 | pages = 3819–3833 | doi = 10.1021/ja01349a004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; first observed the property in gold-cadmium alloys. The same effect was observed in Cu-Zn ([[brass]]) in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Hornbogen, E. |author2=Wassermann, G. | title = Über den Einfluβ von Spannungen und das Auftreten von Umwandlungsplastizität bei β1-β-Umwandlung des Messings | journal = Zeitschrift für Metallkunde | year = 1956 | volume = 47 | pages = 427–433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
[[File:Nitinol Austenite and martensite.jpg|thumb|3D view of austenite and martensite structures of the NiTi compound.]]

Nitinol's unusual properties are derived from a reversible solid-state phase transformation known as a [[martensitic transformation]], between two different martensite crystal phases, requiring {{convert|10000|-|20000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} of mechanical stress.

At high temperatures, nitinol assumes an interpenetrating simple cubic structure referred to as [[austenite]] (also known as the parent phase).  At low temperatures, nitinol spontaneously transforms to a more complicated [[monoclinic crystal structure]] known as [[martensite]] (daughter phase).&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Otsuka, K. |author2=Ren, X. | title = Physical Metallurgy of Ti-Ni-based Shape Memory Alloys | journal = Progress in Materials Science | volume = 50 | issue = 5 | year = 2005 | pages = 511–678 | doi = 10.1016/j.pmatsci.2004.10.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are four transition temperatures associated to the austenite-to-martensite and martensite-to-austenite transformations. Starting from full austenite, martensite begins to form as the alloy is cooled to the so-called ''martensite start temperature'', or M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, and the temperature at which the transformation is complete is called the ''martensite finish temperature'', or M&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;. When the alloy is fully martensite and is subjected to heating, austenite starts to form at the ''austenite start temperature'', A&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, and finishes at the ''austenite finish temperature'', A&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nitinol facts |url=http://www.nitinol.com/nitinol-university/nitinol-facts/ |year=2013 |publisher=Nitinol.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Nitinol transformation hysterisis.svg|left|thumb|Thermal hysteresis of nitinol's phase transformation]]The cooling/heating cycle shows thermal [[hysteresis]]. The hysteresis width depends on the precise nitinol composition and processing. Its typical value is a temperature range spanning about 20-50 K (20-50&amp;nbsp;°C; 36-90&amp;nbsp;°F) but it can be reduced or amplified by alloying&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chluba|first=Christoph|last2=Ge|first2=Wenwei|last3=Miranda|first3=Rodrigo Lima de|last4=Strobel|first4=Julian|last5=Kienle|first5=Lorenz|last6=Quandt|first6=Eckhard|last7=Wuttig|first7=Manfred|date=2015-05-29|title=Ultralow-fatigue shape memory alloy films|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6238/1004|journal=Science|language=en|volume=348|issue=6238|pages=1004–1007|doi=10.1126/science.1261164|issn=0036-8075|pmid=26023135|bibcode=2015Sci...348.1004C}}&lt;/ref&gt; and processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spini|first=Tatiana Sobottka|last2=Valarelli|first2=Fabrício Pinelli|last3=Cançado|first3=Rodrigo Hermont|last4=Freitas|first4=Karina Maria Salvatore de|last5=Villarinho|first5=Denis Jardim|last6=Spini|first6=Tatiana Sobottka|last7=Valarelli|first7=Fabrício Pinelli|last8=Cançado|first8=Rodrigo Hermont|last9=Freitas|first9=Karina Maria Salvatore de|date=2014-04-01|title=Transition temperature range of thermally activated nickel-titanium archwires|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1678-77572014000200109&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=Journal of Applied Oral Science|volume=22|issue=2|pages=109–117|doi=10.1590/1678-775720130133|issn=1678-7757|pmc=3956402|pmid=24676581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crucial to nitinol properties are two key aspects of this phase transformation.  First is that the transformation is "reversible", meaning that heating above the transformation temperature will revert the crystal structure to the simpler austenite phase. The second key point is that the transformation in both directions is instantaneous.

Martensite's crystal structure (known as a monoclinic, or B19' structure) has the unique ability to undergo limited deformation in some ways without breaking atomic bonds. This type of deformation is known as [[Crystal twinning|twinning]], which consists of the rearrangement of atomic planes without causing slip, or permanent deformation. It is able to undergo about 6–8% strain in this manner.  When martensite is reverted to austenite by heating, the original austenitic structure is restored, regardless of whether the martensite phase was deformed.  Thus the name "shape memory" refers to the fact that the shape of the high temperature austenite phase is "remembered," even though the alloy is severely deformed at a lower temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Funakubo | first = Hiroyasu | title = Shape memory alloys | publisher= University of Tokyo | year = 1984 | pages = 7, 176}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:NiTi structure transformation.jpg|thumb|2D view of nitinol's crystalline structure during cooling/heating cycle]]

A great deal of pressure can be produced by preventing the reversion of deformed martensite to austenite — from 35,000 psi to, in many cases, more than 100,000 psi (689 MPa). One of the reasons that nitinol works so hard to return to its original shape is that it is not just an ordinary metal alloy, but what is known as an [[intermetallic compound]]. In an ordinary alloy, the constituents are randomly positioned in the crystal lattice; in an ordered intermetallic compound, the atoms (in this case, nickel and titanium) have very specific locations in the lattice.&lt;ref name="nitinol.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nitinol SM495 Wire |format=properties, PDF |url=http://www.nitinol.com/media/files/material-properties-pdfs/sm495_wire_data%20%5BConverted%5D_v2.pdf |year=2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714184605/http://www.nitinol.com/media/files/material-properties-pdfs/sm495_wire_data%20%5BConverted%5D_v2.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fact that nitinol is an intermetallic is largely responsible for the complexity in fabricating devices made from the alloy.{{why|date=January 2017}}

[[File:Nitinol Ms vs Ni content.jpg|thumb|left|The effect of nitinol composition on the M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; temperature.]]
The scenario described above (cooling austenite to form martensite, deforming the martensite, then heating to revert to austenite, thus returning the original, undeformed shape) is known as the thermal shape memory effect. To fix the original "parent shape," the alloy must be held in position and heated to about {{convert|abbr=on|500|°C|F}}. This process is usually called ''shape setting''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://memry.com/nitinol-iq/nitinol-fundamentals/fabrication-heat-treatment|title=Fabrication &amp; Heat Treatment of Nitinol|last=|first=|date=2011-01-26|website=memry.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second effect, called superelasticity or pseudoelasticity, is also observed in nitinol.  This effect is the direct result of the fact that martensite can be formed by applying a stress as well as by cooling.  Thus in a certain temperature range, one can apply a stress to austenite, causing martensite to form while at the same time changing shape.  In this case, as soon as the stress is removed, the nitinol will spontaneously return to its original shape.  In this mode of use, nitinol behaves like a super spring, possessing an elastic range 10–30 times greater than that of a normal spring material.  There are, however, constraints: the effect is only observed about 0-40 K (0-40&amp;nbsp;°C; 0-72&amp;nbsp;°F) above the A&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; temperature. This upper limit is referred to as M&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=R Meling|first1=Torstein|last2=Ødegaard|first2=Jan|title=The effect of temperature on the elastic responses to longitudinal torsion of rectangular nickel titanium archwires|journal=The Angle Orthodontist|date=August 1998|volume=68|issue=4|pages=357–368|pmid=9709837|url=http://www.angle.org/doi/10.1043/0003-3219(1998)068%3C0357:TEOTOT%3E2.3.CO;2?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed&amp;code=angf-site|doi=10.1043/0003-3219(1998)068&lt;0357:TEOTOT&gt;2.3.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds to the highest temperature in which it is still possible to stress-induce the formation of martensite. Below M&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, martensite formation under load allows superelasticity due to twinning. Above M&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, since martensite is no longer formed, the only response to stress is slip of the austenitic microstructure, and thus permanent deformation.

Nitinol is typically composed of approximately 50 to 51% nickel by atomic percent (55 to 56% weight percent).&lt;ref name="nitinol.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Nitinol SE508 Wire  |format=properties, PDF  |url=http://www.nitinol.com/media/files/material-properties-pdfs/se508_wire_data%20%5BConverted%5D_v2.pdf  |year=2013  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714184648/http://www.nitinol.com/media/files/material-properties-pdfs/se508_wire_data%20%5BConverted%5D_v2.pdf  |archivedate=2011-07-14  |df=  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Making small changes in the composition can change the transition temperature of the alloy significantly. Transformation temperatures in nitinol can be controlled to some extent, where A&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; temperature ranges from about −20&amp;nbsp;°C to +110&amp;nbsp;°C. Thus, it is common practice to refer to a nitinol formulation as "superelastic" or "austenitic" if A&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is lower than a reference temperature, while as "shape memory" or "martensitic" if higher. The reference temperature is usually defined as the [[room temperature]] or the human body temperature (37&amp;nbsp;°C; 98&amp;nbsp;°F).

One often-encountered effect regarding nitinol is the so-called [[R-Phase|R-phase]].  The R-phase is another martensitic phase that competes with the martensite phase mentioned above. Because it does not offer the large memory effects of the martensite phase, it is usually of non practical use.

==Manufacturing process==
Nitinol is exceedingly difficult to make, due to the exceptionally tight compositional control required, and the tremendous reactivity of titanium.  Every atom of titanium that combines with oxygen or carbon is an atom that is robbed from the NiTi lattice, thus shifting the composition and making the transformation temperature that much lower. There are two primary melting methods used today:

; [[Vacuum arc remelting]] (VAR):  This is done by striking an electrical arc between the raw material and a water-cooled copper strike plate.  Melting is done in a high vacuum, and the mold itself is water-cooled copper.
; [[Vacuum induction melting]] (VIM):  This is done by using alternating magnetic fields to heat the raw materials in a crucible (generally carbon). This is also done in a high vacuum.

While both methods have advantages, it has been demonstrated that an industrial state-of-the-art VIM melted material has smaller inclusions than an industrial state-of-the-art VAR one, leading to a higher fatigue resistance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Urbano|first=Marco|last2=Coda|first2=Alberto|last3=Beretta|first3=Stefano|last4=Cadelli|first4=Andrea|last5=Sczerzenie|first5=Frank|date=2013-09-01|title=The Effect of Inclusions on Fatigue Properties for Nitinol|url=https://www.astm.org/DIGITAL_LIBRARY/STP/PAGES/STP155920120189.htm|language=English|doi=10.1520/STP155920120189|journal=Fatigue and Fracture Metallic Medical Materials and Devices|pages=18–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research report that VAR employing extreme high-purity raw materials may lead to a reduced number of inclusions and thus to an improved fatigue behavior.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Scott W.|last2=Launey|first2=Maximilien|last3=Shelley|first3=Oren|last4=Ong|first4=Ich|last5=Vien|first5=Lot|last6=Senthilnathan|first6=Karthike|last7=Saffari|first7=Payman|last8=Schlegel|first8=Scott|last9=Pelton|first9=Alan R.|date=2015-11-01|title=A statistical approach to understand the role of inclusions on the fatigue resistance of superelastic Nitinol wire and tubing|journal=Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials|volume=51|pages=119–131|doi=10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.07.003|issn=1878-0180|pmid=26241890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods are also used on a boutique scale, including plasma arc melting, induction skull melting, and e-beam melting. [[Physical vapour deposition]] is also used on a laboratory scale.

[[Hot working]] of nitinol is relatively easy, but [[cold working]] is difficult because the enormous elasticity of the alloy increases die or roll contact, leading to tremendous frictional resistance and tool wear.  For similar reasons, machining is extremely difficult—to make things worse, the thermal conductivity of nitinol is poor, so heat is difficult to remove. [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)]], [[Electrical discharge machining]] (EDM) and [[laser cutting]] are all relatively easy.

Heat treating nitinol is delicate and critical. It is a knowledge intensive process to fine-tune the transformation temperatures. Aging time and temperature controls the precipitation of various Ni-rich phases, and thus controls how much nickel resides in the NiTi lattice; by depleting the matrix of nickel, aging increases the transformation temperature. The combination of heat treatment and cold working is essential in controlling the properties of nitinol products.&lt;ref name=Pelton&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Pelton, A. |author2=Russell, S. |author3=DiCello, J. | title = The Physical Metallurgy of Nitinol for Medical Applications | journal = JOM | volume = 55 | issue = 5 | year = 2003 | pages = 33–37 | doi = 10.1007/s11837-003-0243-3 | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11837-003-0243-3#page-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==
Fatigue failures of nitinol devices are a constant subject of discussion.  Because it is the material of choice for applications requiring enormous flexibility and motion (e.g., peripheral stents, heart valves, smart thermomechanical actuators and electromechanical microactuators), it is necessarily exposed to much greater fatigue strains compared to other metals. While the strain-controlled fatigue performance of nitinol is superior to all other known metals, fatigue failures have been observed in the most demanding applications. There is a great deal of effort underway trying to better understand and define the durability limits of nitinol.

Nitinol is half nickel, and thus there has been a great deal of concern in the medical industry regarding the release of nickel, a known allergen and possible carcinogen.&lt;ref name=Pelton/&gt; (Nickel is also present in substantial amounts in [[stainless steel]] and cobalt-chrome alloys.)  When properly treated (via [[electropolishing]] and/or [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]]), nitinol forms a very stable protective TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer that acts as a very effective and self-healing barrier against ion exchange. It has been repeatedly shown that nitinol releases nickel at a slower pace than stainless steel, for example.  With that said, very early medical devices were made without electropolishing, and corrosion was observed.  Today's nitinol vascular [[self-expandable metallic stent]]s, for example, show no evidence of corrosion or nickel release, and the outcomes in patients with and without nickel allergies are indistinguishable.

There are constant and long-running discussions regarding inclusions in nitinol, both TiC and Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.  As in all other metals and alloys, inclusions can be found in Nitinol. The size, distribution and type of inclusions can be controlled to some extent. Theoretically, smaller, rounder and few inclusions should lead to increased fatigue durability.  In literature, some early works report to have failed to show measurable differences,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Morgan, N. |author2=Wick, A. |author3=DiCello, J. |author4=Graham, R. | chapter = Carbon and Oxygen Levels in Nitinol Alloys and the Implications for Medical Device Manufacture and Durability | title = SMST-2006 Proceedings of the International Conference on Shape Memory and Superelastic Technologies | year = 2006 | publisher = ASM International | pages = 821–828 | doi = 10.1361/cp2006smst821 | isbn = 978-0-87170-862-5 | lccn = 2009499204 | url = http://www.nitinol.com/media/reference-library/151_Morgan_Wick_DiCello_Graham_2008.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Miyazaki, S. |author2=Sugaya, Y. |author3=Otsuka, K. | chapter = Mechanism of Fatigue Crack Nucleation in Ti-Ni Alloys | title = Shape memory materials : May 31-June 3, 1988, Sunshine City, Ikebukuro, Tokyo, Japan | series = Proceedings of the MRS International Meeting on Advanced Materials | volume = 9 | publisher = Materials Research Society | year = 1989 | pages = 257–262 | isbn = 1-55899-038-0 | lccn = 90174266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while novel studies demonstrate a dependence of fatigue resistance on the typical inclusion size in an alloy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asminternational.org/conferences/resources/conference-proceedings?p_p_auth=JbQd1FjJ&amp;p_p_id=101&amp;p_p_lifecycle=0&amp;p_p_state=maximized&amp;_101_struts_action=/asset_publisher/view_content&amp;_101_assetEntryId=5918779&amp;_101_type=content&amp;_101_groupId=10192&amp;_101_urlTitle=the-influence-of-microcleanliness-on-the-fatigue-performance-of-nitinol|title=The Influence of Microcleanliness on the Fatigue Performance of Nitinol - Conference Proceedings - ASM International|website=www.asminternational.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225396994_Smartflex_NiTi_Wires_for_Shape_Memory_Actuators|title=Academic paper (PDF): Smartflex NiTi Wires for Shape Memory Actuators|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahim|first=M.|last2=Frenzel|first2=J.|last3=Frotscher|first3=M.|last4=Pfetzing-Micklich|first4=J.|last5=Steegmüller|first5=R.|last6=Wohlschlögel|first6=M.|last7=Mughrabi|first7=H.|last8=Eggeler|first8=G.|date=2013-06-01|title=Impurity levels and fatigue lives of pseudoelastic NiTi shape memory alloys|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645413001870|journal=Acta Materialia|volume=61|issue=10|pages=3667–3686|doi=10.1016/j.actamat.2013.02.054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitinol is difficult to weld, both to itself and other materials. Laser welding nitinol to itself is a relatively routine process. More recently, strong joints between NiTi wires and stainless steel wires have been made using nickel filler.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent | inventor = Hall, P.

More research is ongoing into other processes and other metals to which nitinol can be welded.

Actuation frequency of nitinol is dependent on the heat management, especially during the cooling phase.

==Applications==
There are four commonly used types of applications for nitinol:

'''Free recovery'''
: Nitinol is deformed at a low temperature, and heated to recover its original shape through the Shape Memory effect.
'''Constrained recovery'''
:  As for free recovery, except that recovery is rigidly prevented and thus a stress is generated.
'''Work production'''
: Here the alloy is allowed to recover, but to do so it must act against a force (thus doing work).
'''Superelasticity'''
: Nitinol acts as a super spring through the Superelastic effect.
: 
In 1989 a survey was conducted in the United States and Canada that involved seven organizations. The survey focused on predicting the future technology, market, and applications of SMAs. The companies predicted the following uses of nitinol in a decreasing order of importance: (1) Couplings, (2) Biomedical and medical, (3) Toys, demonstration, novelty items, (4) Actuators, (5) Heat Engines, (6) Sensors, (7) Cryogenically activated die and bubble memory sockets, and finally (8) lifting devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Miller, R.

Today, nitinol finds application in the listed industrial applications:

===Thermal and electrical actuators===
*Nitinol can be used to replace conventional [[actuator]]s ([[solenoid]]s, [[servo motor]]s, etc.), such as in the [[Stiquito]], a simple [[hexapod (robotics)|hexapod]] [[robot]].
*Nitinol springs are used in thermal valves for [[fluidics]], where the material both acts as a temperature sensor and an actuator.
*It is used as [[autofocus]] actuator in action cameras and as an [[Image stabilization|Optical Image Stabilizer]] in mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Actuator Solutions|title=SMA AF / OIS Mechanism|date=2015-12-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orlrmErs9cU|accessdate=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It is used in pneumatic valves for comfort seating and has become an industry standard.
*The 2014 Chevrolet Corvette incorporates nitinol actuators, which replaced heavier motorized actuators to open and close the hatch vent that releases air from the trunk, making it easier to close.

===Biocompatible and biomedical applications===
{{Main|Nitinol biocompatibility}}
*Nitinol is highly [[Biocompatibility|biocompatible]] and has properties suitable for use in orthopedic implants. Due to Nitinol's unique properties it has seen a large demand for use in less invasive medical devices. Nitinol tubing is commonly used in catheters, stents, and superelastic needles.
*In colorectal surgery [http://www.nitisurgical.com/patient_education.htm], the material is used in devices for reconnecting the intestine after removing the pathology.
*Nitinol is used for devices developed by [[Franz Freudenthal]] to treat [[Patent ductus arteriosus]], blocking a blood vessel that bypasses the lungs and has failed to close after birth in an infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/noticias/2014/10/141002_medico_boliviano_corazon_am|date=2014-10-02  |author=Alejandra Martins |title=The inventions of the Bolivian doctor who saved thousands of children|journal=BBC Mundo|accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In dentistry, the material is used in [[orthodontics]] for brackets and wires connecting the teeth. Once the SMA wire is placed in the mouth its temperature rises to ambient body temperature. This causes the nitinol to contract back to its original shape, applying a constant force to move the teeth. These SMA wires do not need to be retightened as often as other wires because they can contract as the teeth move unlike conventional stainless steel wires. Additionally, nitinol can be used in [[endodontics]], where nitinol files are used to clean and shape the root canals during the [[root canal]] procedure.  Because of the high fatigue tolerance and flexibility of nitinol, it greatly decreases the possibility of an endodontic file breaking inside the tooth during root canal treatment, thus improving safety for the patient.
*Another significant application of nitinol in medicine is in [[stent]]s: a collapsed stent can be inserted into an artery or vein, where body temperature warms the stent and the stent returns to its original expanded shape following removal of a constraining sheath; the stent then helps support the artery or vein to improve blood flow. It is also used as a replacement for [[Surgical suture|sutures]] - nitinol wire can be woven through two structures then allowed to transform into its preformed shape, which should hold the structures in place.
*Similarly, collapsible structures composed of braided, microscopically-thin nitinol filaments can be used in neurovascular interventions such as stroke thrombolysis, embolization, and intracranial angioplasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Keith|title=Nitinol Micro-Braids for Neurovascular Interventions|url=http://www.usbiodesign.com/biomedical-textile-specialties/neurovascular|website=US BioDesign}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A more recent application of nitinol wire is in female contraception, specifically in [[intrauterine device]]s.

=== Damping systems in structural engineering ===
* Superelastic Nitinol finds a variety of applications in civil structures such as bridges and buildings. One such application is Intelligent Reinforced Concrete (IRC), which incorporates Ni-Ti wires embedded within the concrete. These wires can sense cracks and contract to heal macro-sized cracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www-2.unipv.it/compmech/publications/2014_3b.pdf|title=Shape Memory Alloy Engineering|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=9781322158457|location=|pages=369–401}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another application is active tuning of structural natural frequency using Nitinol wires to dampen vibrations.

=== Other applications and prototypes ===
*Demonstration model [[heat engine]]s have been built which use nitinol wire to produce mechanical energy from hot and cold heat sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesco.com/nitinol/heat-engine.html|title=Nitinol Heat Engine Kit|year=2007|publisher=Images Scientific Instruments|accessdate=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prototype commercial engine developed in the 1970s by engineer Ridgway Banks at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], was named the Banks Engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1975|title=The Banks Engine|journal=Die Naturwissenschaften|volume=62|issue=7|pages=305–308|doi=10.1007/BF00608890|author=Banks, R.|bibcode=1975NW.....62..305B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/45924783 Vimeo posting of "The Individualist", documentary on Ridgway Banks]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US4450686 "Single wire nitinol engine", Ridgway M.

*Nitinol is also popular in extremely resilient glasses frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hero Khan|title=Nitinol Glasses|date=2013-11-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPrg8EZlD1E|accessdate=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used in some mechanical watch springs.

*It can be used as a temperature control system; as it changes shape, it can activate a switch or a [[variable resistor]] to control the temperature.
*It is used in cell-phone technology as a retractable antenna, or microphone boom, due to its highly flexible and mechanical memory nature.
*It is used to made certain surgical implants, such as the [[SmartToe]].
*It is used in some novelty products, such as [[Spoon bending|self-bending spoons]] which can be used by amateur and stage magicians to demonstrate "psychic" powers or as a [[practical joke]], as the spoon will bend itself when used to stir tea, coffee, or any other warm liquid.
*It can also be used as wires which are used to locate and mark breast tumours so that the following surgery can be more exact.
*Due to the high damping capacity of Superelastic nitinol, it is also used as a [[Golf club (equipment)|golf club]] insert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinoff1997/ch8.html|title=Memory Golf Clubs|website=spinoff.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1294">'''Nuclear shaped charges''' refers to [[nuclear weapon]]s that focus the energy of their explosion into certain directions, as opposed to a spherical explosion. [[Edward Teller]] referred to such concepts as '''third-generation weapons''', the first generation being the [[atom bomb]] and the second the [[H-bomb]].

The basic concept has been raised on several occasions, with the first known references being part of the [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] nuclear-powered spacecraft project in the 1960s. This used [[beryllium oxide]] to convert the [[X-rays]] released by a small bomb into [[infrared]] light, which explosively vaporized a tamper material, normally [[tungsten]], causing it to carry away much of the bomb's energy as [[kinetic energy]] in the form of tungsten [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The same concept was explored as a weapon in the [[Casaba Howitzer]] proposals.

The ideas were explored by [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] as part of the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]].

The [[Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control|Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control problem]] is one of the most fundamental [[optimal control]] problems. It concerns uncertain [[linear system]]s disturbed by [[additive white Gaussian noise]], incomplete state information (i.e. not all the state variables are measured and available for feedback) also disturbed by additive white Gaussian noise and quadratic [[cost functional|cost]]s. Moreover, the solution is unique and constitutes a linear dynamic feedback control law that is easily computed and implemented. Finally the LQG controller is also fundamental to the optimal perturbation control of non-linear systems.&lt;ref name="Athans"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Athans M. |title=The role and use of the stochastic Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian problem in control system design |journal=IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control |volume=AC-16 |issue=6 |pages=529–552 |year=1971 |doi=10.1109/TAC.1971.1099818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LQG controller itself is a dynamic system like the system it controls. Both systems have the same state dimension. Therefore, implementing the LQG controller may be problematic if the dimension of the system state is large. The '''reduced-order LQG problem''' (fixed-order LQG problem) overcomes this by fixing a-priori the number of states of the LQG controller. This problem is more difficult to solve because it is no longer separable. Also the solution is no longer unique.

==Mathematical problem formulation and solution==

===Continuous-time===

The reduced-order LQG control problem is almost identical to the [[Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control|conventional full-order LQG control problem]]. Let &lt;math&gt; \hat{\mathbf{x}}_r(t) &lt;/math&gt; represent the state of the reduced-order LQG controller. Then the only difference is that the state dimension &lt;math&gt; n_r=dim(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_r(t)) &lt;/math&gt; of the LQG controller is a-priori fixed to be smaller than &lt;math&gt; n=dim({\mathbf{x}}(t)) &lt;/math&gt;, the state dimension of the controlled system.

The reduced-order LQG controller is represented by the following equations:

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{\hat{\mathbf{x}}}_r(t) = A_r(t)\hat{\mathbf{x}}_r(t) + B_r(t){\mathbf{u}}(t)+K_r(t) \left( {\mathbf{y}}(t)-C_r(t)\hat{\mathbf{x}}_r(t) \right),\hat{\mathbf{x}}_r(0)={\mathbf{x}}_r(0),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; {\mathbf{u}}(t)= -L_r(t) \hat{\mathbf{x}}_r(t).&lt;/math&gt;

These equations are deliberately stated in a format that equals that of the [[Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control|conventional full-order LQG controller]]. For the reduced-order LQG control problem it is  convenient to rewrite them as

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{\hat{\mathbf{x}}}_r(t) = F_r(t)\hat{\mathbf{x}}_r(t) + K_r(t) {\mathbf{y}}(t),\hat{\mathbf{x}}_r(0)={\mathbf{x}}_r(0),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; {\mathbf{u}}(t)= -L_r(t) \hat{\mathbf{x}}_r(t),&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}F_r(t)=A_r(t)-B_r(t)L_r(t)-K_r(t)C_r(t).&lt;/math&gt;

The matrices &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}F_r(t), K_r(t), L_r(t) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{x}}_r(0)&lt;/math&gt; of the reduced-order LQG controller are determined by the so-called '''optimal projection equations''' ('''OPE''').&lt;ref name="Haddad1"/&gt;

The square optimal projection matrix &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}\tau(t)&lt;/math&gt; with dimension &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}n&lt;/math&gt; is central to the '''OPE'''. The rank of this matrix is almost everywhere equal to &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}n_r.&lt;/math&gt; The associated projection is an oblique projection: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}\tau^2(t)=\tau(t).&lt;/math&gt; The '''OPE''' constitute four matrix differential equations. The first two equations listed below are generalizations of the matrix Riccati differential equations associated to the [[Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control|conventional full-order LQG controller]]. In these equations &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}\tau_\perp(t)&lt;/math&gt; denotes &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}I_n-\tau(t)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}I_n&lt;/math&gt; is the identity matrix of dimension &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}n&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{P}(t) = A(t)P(t)+P(t)A'(t)-P(t)C'(t)W^{-1}(t)
C(t)P(t)+V(t)&lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;+\tau_\perp (t)P(t)C'(t)W^{-1}(t)
C(t)P(t)\tau'_\perp (t),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; P(0)= E \left({\mathbf{x}}(0){\mathbf{x}}'(0) \right),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; -\dot{S}(t) = A'(t)S(t)+S(t)A(t)-S(t)B(t)R^{-1}(t)B'(t)S(t)+Q(t)&lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;+ \tau'_\perp (t)S(t)B(t)R^{-1}(t)B'(t)S(t) \tau_\perp (t),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;  {\mathbf{}}S(T) = F.&lt;/math&gt;

If the dimension of the LQG controller is not reduced, that is if &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}n=n_r&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\tau(t)=I_n, \tau_\perp(t)=0&lt;/math&gt; and the two equations above become the uncoupled matrix Riccati differential equations associated to the [[Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control|conventional full-order LQG controller]]. If &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}n_r&lt;n&lt;/math&gt; the two equations are coupled by the oblique projection &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}\tau(t).&lt;/math&gt; This reveals why the reduced-order LQG problem is not '''separable'''. The oblique projection &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}\tau(t)&lt;/math&gt; is determined from two additional matrix differential equations which involve '''rank conditions'''. Together with the previous two matrix differential equations these are the '''OPE'''. To state the additional two matrix differential equations it is convenient to introduce the following two matrices:

: &lt;math&gt; \Psi_1(t)=(A(t)-B(t)R^{-1}(t)B'(t)S(t))\hat{P}(t)+\hat{P}(t)
(A(t)-B(t)R^{-1}(t)B'(t)S(t))'&lt;/math&gt;
:::: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}+P(t)C'(t)W^{-1}(t)C(t)P(t),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \Psi_2(t)=(A(t)-P(t)C'(t)W^{-1}(t)
C(t))'\hat{S}(t)+\hat{S}(t)(A(t)-P(t)C'(t)W^{-1}(t)C(t))&lt;/math&gt;
:::: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}+S(t)B(t)R^{-1}(t)B'(t)S(t).&lt;/math&gt;

Then the two additional matrix differential equations that complete the '''OPE''' are as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{\hat{P}}(t)=1/2 \left(\tau(t)\Psi_1(t)+\Psi_1(t)\tau'(t) \right),\hat{P}(0)=E({\mathbf{x}}(0))E({\mathbf{x}}(0))', rank(\hat{P}(t))=n_r&lt;/math&gt;  almost everywhere,

: &lt;math&gt; -\dot{\hat{S}}(t)=1/2 \left(\tau'(t)\Psi_2(t)+\Psi_2(t)\tau(t) \right),\hat{S}(T)=0, rank(\hat{S}(t))=n_r&lt;/math&gt; almost everywhere,

with

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}\tau(t)= \hat{P}(t) \hat{S}(t) \left( \hat{P}(t) \hat{S}(t) \right)^*.&lt;/math&gt;

Here * denotes the group generalized inverse or [[Drazin inverse]] that is unique and given by

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}A^*=A(A^3)^+A.&lt;/math&gt;

where + denotes the [[Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse]].

The matrices &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}P(t),S(t),\hat{P}(t),\hat{S}(t)&lt;/math&gt; must all be '''nonnegative symmetric'''. Then they constitute a solution of the '''OPE''' that determines the reduced-order LQG controller matrices &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}F_r(t), K_r(t), L_r(t) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{x}}_r(0)&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}F_r(t)=H(t)\left( A(t)-P(t)C'(t)W^{-1}(t)
C(t)-B(t)R^{-1}(t)B'(t)S(t) \right)G(t)+\dot{H}(t)G'(t),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}K_r(t)=H(t)P(t)C'(t)W^{-1}(t),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}L_r(t)=R^{-1}(t)B'(t)S(t)G'(t),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{x}}_r(0)=H(0)E({\mathbf{x}}(0)).&lt;/math&gt;

In the equations above the matrices &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}G(t),H(t)&lt;/math&gt; are two matrices with the following properties:

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}G'(t)H(t)=\tau(t),G(t)H'(t)=I_{n_r}&lt;/math&gt; almost everywhere.

They can be obtained from a projective factorization of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}\hat{P}(t)\hat{S}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Wil1"/&gt;

The '''OPE''' can be stated in many different ways that are all equivalent. To identify the equivalent representations the following identities are especially useful:

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}\tau(t)\hat{P}(t)=\hat{P}(t)\tau'(t)=\hat{P}(t), \tau'(t)\hat{S}(t)=\hat{S}(t)\tau(t)=\hat{S}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Using these identities one may for instance rewrite the first two of the optimal projection equations as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{P}(t) = A(t)P(t)+P(t)A'(t)-P(t)C'(t)W^{-1}(t)C(t)P(t)+V(t)+\tau_\perp(t)\Psi_1(t)\tau'_\perp (t),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; P(0)= E \left({\mathbf{x}}(0){\mathbf{x}}'(0) \right),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; -\dot{S}(t) = A'(t)S(t)+S(t)A(t)-S(t)B(t)R^{-1}(t)B'(t)S(t)+Q(t)+\tau'_\perp\Psi_2(t)\tau_\perp(t),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;  {\mathbf{}}S(T) = F.&lt;/math&gt;

This representation is both relatively simple and suitable for numerical computations.

If all the matrices in the reduced-order LQG problem formulation are time-invariant and if the horizon &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}T&lt;/math&gt; tends to infinity, the optimal reduced-order LQG controller becomes time-invariant and so do the '''OPE'''.&lt;ref name="Bern1"/&gt; In that case the derivatives on the left hand side of the '''OPE''' are zero.

===Discrete-time===

Similar to the continuous-time case, in the discrete-time case the difference with the [[Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control|conventional discrete-time full-order LQG problem]] is the a-priori fixed reduced-order &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}n_r&lt;n&lt;/math&gt; of the LQG controller state dimension. As in continuous-time, to state the '''discrete-time OPE''' it is convenient to introduce the following two matrices:

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}\Psi^1_i=\left(A_i-B_i(B'_iS_{i+1}B_i+R_i)^{-1}B'_iS_{i+1}A_i)\right)\hat{P}_i
\left(A_i-B_i(B'_iS_{i+1}B_i+R_i)^{-1}B'_iS_{i+1}A_i)\right)'&lt;/math&gt;
:::: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}+A_iP_iC'_i(C_iP_iC'_i+W_i)^{-1}C_iP_iA'_i&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}\Psi^2_{i+1}=\left(A_i-A_iP_iC'_i(C_iP_{i}C'_i+W_i)^{-1}C_i\right)'\hat{S}_{i+1}
\left(A_i-A_iP_iC'_i(C_iP_{i}C'_i+W_i)^{-1}C_i\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:::: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}+A'_iS_{i+1}B_i(B'_iS_{i+1}B_i+R_i)^{-1}B'_iS_{i+1}A_i&lt;/math&gt;

Then the '''discrete-time OPE''' is

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}P_{i+1} = A_i \left( P_i - P_i C'_i \left( C_i P_i C'_i+W_i \right)^{-1} C_i P_i \right) A'_i+V_i+\tau_{\perp i+1}\Psi^1_i \tau'_{\perp i+1}, P_0=E \left( {\mathbf{x}}_0{\mathbf{x'}}_0 \right)&lt;/math&gt;.
: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}S_{i} = A'_i \left( S_{i+1} - S_{i+1}B_i \left( B'_iS_{i+1}B_i+R_i \right)^{-1} B'_i S_{i+1} \right) A_i+Q_i+\tau'_{\perp i}\Psi^2_{i+1} \tau_{\perp i}, S_N=F&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}\hat{P}_{i+1}=1/2(\tau_{i+1}\Psi_i^1+\Psi_i^1\tau'_{i+1}),\hat{P}_0=E({\mathbf{x}}(0))E({\mathbf{x}}(0))', rank(\hat{P}_i)=n_r&lt;/math&gt;  almost everywhere,
:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}\hat{S}_{i}=1/2(\tau'_{i}\Psi_{i+1}^2+\Psi_{i+1}^2\tau_{i}),\hat{S}_N=0, rank(\hat{S}_i)=n_r&lt;/math&gt; almost everywhere.

The oblique projection matrix is given by

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}\tau_i=\hat{P}_i\hat{S}_i \left(\hat{P}_i\hat{S}_i \right)^*.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''nonnegative symmetric matrices''' &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}P_i,S_i,\hat{P}_i,\hat{S}_i&lt;/math&gt; that solve the '''discrete-time OPE''' determine the reduced-order LQG controller matrices &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}F_i^r, K_i^r, L_i^r &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{x}}_0^r&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}F_i^r=H_{i+1}\left( A_i-P_i C'_i \left( C_i P_i C'_i+W_i \right)^{-1}C_i-B_i\left( B'_iS_{i+1}B_i+R_i \right)^{-1} B'_i S_{i+1}\right)G'_i,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}K_i^r=H_{i+1}P_i C'_i \left( C_i P_i C'_i+W_i \right)^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}L_i^r=\left( B'_iS_{i+1}B_i+R_i \right)^{-1} B'_i S_{i+1}G'_i,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{x}}_0^r=H_0E({\mathbf{x}}_0).&lt;/math&gt;

In the equations above the matrices &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}G_i,H_i&lt;/math&gt; are two matrices with the following properties:

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}G'_iH_i=\tau_i, G_iH'_i=I_{n_r}&lt;/math&gt; almost everywhere.

They can be obtained from a projective factorization of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}\hat{P}_i\hat{S}_i&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Wil1"/&gt; To identify equivalent representations of the '''discrete-time OPE''' the following identities are especially useful:

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}\tau_i\hat{P}_i=\hat{P}_i\tau'_i=\hat{P}_i, \tau'_i\hat{S}_i=\hat{S}_i\tau_i=\hat{S}_i&lt;/math&gt;

As in the continuous-time case if all the matrices in the problem formulation are time-invariant and if the horizon &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{}}N&lt;/math&gt; tends to infinity the reduced-order LQG controller becomes time-invariant. Then the discrete-time OPE converge to a steady state solution that determines the time-invariant reduced-order LQG controller.&lt;ref name="Bern2"/&gt;

The '''discrete-time OPE''' apply also to discrete-time systems with '''variable state, input and output dimensions''' (discrete-time systems with time-varying dimensions).&lt;ref name="Wil2"/&gt; Such systems arise in the case of digital controller design if the sampling occurs asynchronously.

The [[United Nations]], through its [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] per Chapter VII of its [[United Nations Charter|charter]], has the ability to authorize force to enforce its resolutions and ceasefires already created.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundgren|first=Magnus|year=2016|title=Conflict management capabilities of peace-brokering international organizations, 1945–2010: A new dataset|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0738894215572757|journal=Conflict Management and Peace Science|volume=33|pages=198-223|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peace enforcement differs from [[peacekeeping]] as peace enforcement activities are generally used to create a peace from a broken ceasefire or to enforce a peace demanded by the United Nations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Compared to peacekeeping, peace enforcement requires more military force and is thereby best done by heavily armed forces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, it is generally unable to create lasting peace, as it does nothing to deal with the underlying problems which caused the conflict itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CHAPTER III -- PEACE ENFORCEMENT|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/call/call_93-8_chap3.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous examples of peace enforcement was the UN intervention during the [[Gulf War]] to force Saddam Hussein's Iraqi army from Kuwait. The United Nations was thereby able to compel Iraq's compliance with the UN Resolutions which demanded its withdrawal from the region.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Perspectives on International Relations|last = Nau|first = Henry R|publisher = CQ Press|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-4522-4148-7|location = Washington DC|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report on peacekeeping and peace enforcement in the 1990s for the United States Army established this difference between peace enforcement and peacekeeping: &lt;blockquote&gt;Peacekeeping, a role the U.N. has played over the years, is relatively straightforward and, despite its difficulties, comparatively easy. Peacekeeping involves monitoring and enforcing a cease-fire agreed to by two or more former combatants. It proceeds in an atmosphere where peace exists and where the former combatants minimally prefer peace to continued war. Peace-enforcement, as it is used by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff|United States Joint Chiefs of Staff]], entails the physical interposition of armed forces to separate ongoing combatants to create a cease-fire that does not exist. [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali|Boutros-Ghali]], on the other hand, uses the term to refer to actions to keep a cease-fire from being violated or to reinstate a failed cease-fire. It is a subtle difference, but it does imply the existence of some will for peace. The American version more realistically portrays another, far more difficult matter. By definition, in a situation for which peace-enforcement is a potentially appropriate response, war and not peace describes the situation, and one or more of the combatants prefer it that way. This means that, unlike peacekeepers, peace enforcers are often not welcomed by one or either side(s). Rather, they are active fighters who must impose a cease-fire that is opposed by one or both combatants; in the process, the neutrality that distinguishes peacekeepers will most likely be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub348.pdf |title=Peacekeeping, Peacemaking and Peace-Enforcement: The U.S. Role in the New International Order |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Hevelius-Quadrant.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Crüger's Azimuthal Quadrant, completed by [[Johannes Hevelius]] 1644'' (the observer is Hevelius)]]

'''Peter Crüger''' or '''Peter Krüger''' (20 October 1580 – 6 June 1639) was a  mathematician, astronomer, [[polymath]], and teacher of [[Johannes Hevelius]].

==Life==
Crüger was born in [[Königsberg]], [[Duchy of Prussia]], a fief of the [[Crown of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]].

In scientific documents published in Latin, his common name ''Krüger'' ([[German language|German]] for ''potter'' or ''innkeeper'')&lt;ref&gt;Spelled ''Krueger'' when the [[Umlaut (diacritic)]] [[Ü]] is not available&lt;/ref&gt; was Latinized and spelled ''Crüger''. (Compared to the frequency of the family name ''[[Krüger]]'', the name ''[[:de:Crüger|Crüger]]'' is relatively uncommon.)

Crüger studied at the universities in [[Albertina University|Königsberg]], [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|Wittenberg]], graduating from Wittenberg in 1606. Among his teachers were [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]]. He then moved to the city of [[Danzig]] (Gdańsk) in the [[Crown of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], where he worked for the rest of his life as a professor of [[poetry]] and [[mathematics]] at the ''[[Academic Gymnasium Danzig|Danziger Akademikum]]'' (Danzig Academy). 

As a philosopher and poet, Crüger was associated with the poet [[Johannes Plavius]], who in his ''Institutio Poetica'' mentions Crüger in the opening letter. Crüger dedicated an extremely laudatory poem to Plavius, which appears in the preface to Plavius' ''Praecepta logicalia''.

At the time of the [[Thirty Years' War]] a number of [[Silesia]]ns took refuge in Danzig from the ravages of war in their towns, among them [[Andreas Gryphius]], who, when he studied at the Danzig academy from 1634 to 1636, had Crüger as a teacher&lt;ref&gt;{{de-ADB|10|73|82|Gryphius, Andreas|Palm, Hermann}}; here: p.&amp;nbsp;74.&lt;/ref&gt; and was very much influenced by the famous mathematician and astronomer. Professors Crüger and Mochingert made Gryphius aware of the new style of German-language poetry. Gryphius wrote memorial verses, when in 1638 Crüger's child died. Years earlier Crüger had already developed a great friendship with [[Martin Opitz]], "father of German poetry", who also lived in Danzig.

Crüger published treatises on many scientific subjects and contributed to the progress of trigonometry, geography and astronomy, and to the development of astronomical instruments. In the years 1627 to 1630, Crüger was the teacher of a teenager of the Hewelke family who would become known later as [[Johannes Hevelius]], the astronomer. After Hevelius had returned to Danzig in 1634, the dying Crüger appealed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/iss/library/speccoll/bomarch/bomoct04.html Selenographia] {{la-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manfredholl.de/kart2.htm Geschichte der Mondkarten] {{de-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; to him to pursue astronomy. Hevelius gratefully mentions Crüger in his ''Machina coelestis''.&lt;ref&gt;Hevelius, Johannes (1673). [https://books.google.com/books?id=XlpGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA37 ''Machina coelestis'', vol. 1]. p.&amp;nbsp;37 {{la-icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Danzig]].

The crater [[Crüger (crater)|Crüger]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him.

'''Port-aux-Français''' is the capital settlement of the [[Kerguelen Islands]], [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]], in the south [[Indian Ocean]]. The port station is located on the [[Gulf of Morbihan (Kerguelen)|Gulf of Morbihan]], at {{Coord|49.35|S|70.219|E}}.

==Research station==
The station was selected in 1949 by the chief of mission [[Pierre Sicaud]] because of its sheltered position which was suitable for a runway that was never built. From 1955 to 1957, and using [[Australia]]n equipment, a French [[slaughterhouse]] company called Sidap constructed  a [[seal hunting|sealing factory]]. The factory opened following the first marriage on the islands, that of Marc Pechenart and Martine Raulin on 16 December 1957. The factory closed in 1960, and the equipment was sent to [[Réunion]] in 2005.  It has about 45 inhabitants in winter; the population can rise to more than 120 in summer.

Port-aux-Français has a shallow [[port|seaport]] and a [[quay]] for unloading supply ships, including the ''[[Marion Dufresne (1995)|Marion Dufresne]]''. The station, in addition to logistics necessary to its operation, consists of scientific laboratories ([[biology]], [[geophysics]]), technical installations ([[meteorology]], [[telecommunication]]s, satellite tracking, et cetera), a cinema and a small medical centre.

==Tidal gauges==
The base of Port-aux-Français is equipped with a recently installed marigraphic station, having 3 measuring devices:
* two [[tide gauges]] to measure pressure at sea bottom
* a [[Wave radar|radar]] measuring the sea level.
The two marigraphs and the radar send data to a local server, which relays them hourly to the Internet via the [[Argos System|Argos]] satellite system.

==Climate==
Port-aux-Français has an ocean moderated [[Köppen climate classification#Group E: Polar and alpine (montane) climates|mild tundra climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''ET'').&lt;ref name=Peel&gt;{{cite journal | author=Peel, M.

'''''Public Culture''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]], interdisciplinary [[academic journal]] of [[cultural studies]], published three times a year—in January, May, and September—by [[Duke University Press]]. It is sponsored by the [[Institute for Public Knowledge]] at [[New York University]].

A four-time [[The Council of Editors of Learned Journals|CELJ]] award winner, ''Public Culture'' has been publishing field-defining ethnographies and analyses of the cultural politics of globalization for more than twenty-five years. The journal provides a forum for the discussion of the places and occasions where cultural, social, and political differences emerge as public phenomena, manifested in everything from highly particular and localized events in popular or folk culture to global advertising, consumption, and information networks. Artists, activists, and both well-established and younger scholars, from across the humanities and social sciences and around the world, present some of their most innovative and exciting work in the pages of ''Public Culture''.

The journal was established in 1988 by anthropologists [[Carol Breckenridge]] and [[Arjun Appadurai]]. Professor of [[Sociology]] and Director of the Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University [[Eric Klinenberg]] served as Public Culture's [[editor-in-chief]] from 2010 to 2015, during which time he initiated the online [[book review]] offshoot ''Public Books''.&lt;ref name="CHE"&gt;Monaghan, Peter.

A '''resultant force''' is the single force and associated [[torque]] obtained by combining a system of [[forces]] and torques acting on a rigid body.  The defining feature of a resultant force, or resultant force-torque, is that it has the same effect on the rigid body as the original system of forces.&lt;ref&gt;H. Dadourian, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yHIOjycr8H4C&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=analytical+dynamics+resultant+of+forces+and+torques&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EktYFECIX2&amp;sig=wK8JU2ozIhncDFzTVcmoJbPc2h4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mpMZULaIEMiWiALqt4CoCA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=analytical%20dynamics%20resultant%20of%20forces%20and%20torques&amp;f=false ''Analytical Mechanics for Students of Physics and Engineering,''] Van Nostrand Co., Boston, MA 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

The point of application of the resultant force determines its associated torque.  The term ''resultant force'' should be understood to refer to both the forces and torques acting on a [[rigid body]], which is why some use the term '''resultant force-torque'''. 

==Illustration==
The diagram illustrates simple graphical methods for finding the line of application of the resultant force of simple planar systems.
#Lines of application of the actual forces &lt;math&gt; {\scriptstyle \vec{F}_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{F}_{2}&lt;/math&gt; in the leftmost illustration intersect. After vector addition is performed "at the location of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{F}_{1}&lt;/math&gt;", the net force obtained is translated so that its line of application passes through the common intersection point. With respect to that point all torques are zero, so the torque of the resultant force &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{F}_{R}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the sum of the torques of the actual forces.
#Illustration in the middle of the diagram shows two parallel actual forces. After vector addition "at the location of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\vec{F}_{2}&lt;/math&gt;", the net force is translated to the appropriate line of application, whereof it becomes the resultant force &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{F}_{R}&lt;/math&gt;. The procedure is based on decomposition of all forces into components for which the lines of application (pale dotted lines) intersect at one point (the so-called pole, arbitrarily set at the right side of the illustration). Then the arguments from the previous case are applied to the forces and their components to demonstrate the torque relationships.
#The rightmost illustration shows a [[couple (mechanics)|couple]], two equal but opposite forces for which the amount of the net force is zero, but they produce the net torque &lt;math&gt;  \scriptstyle\tau = Fd &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle  d &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; is the distance between their lines of application. This is "pure" torque, since there is no resultant force.

==Bound vector==
A force applied to a body has a point of application.  The effect of the force is different for different points of application.  For this reason a force is called a ''bound vector'', which means that it is bound to its point of application.

Forces applied at the same point can be added together to obtain the same effect on the body.  However, forces with different points of application cannot be added together and maintain the same effect on the body.

It is a simple matter to change the point of application of a force by introducing equal and opposite forces at two different points of application that produce a pure torque on the body.  In this way, all of the forces acting on a body can be moved to the same point of application with associated torques.  

A system of forces on a rigid body are combined by moving the forces to the same point of application and computing the associated torques.  The sum of these forces and torques yields the resultant force-torque.

==Associated torque==
If a point '''R''' is selected as the point of application of the resultant force '''F''' of a system of ''n'' forces '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; then the associated torque '''T''' is determined from the formulas
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{F}_i,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} = \sum_{i=1}^n (\mathbf{R}_i-\mathbf{R})\times \mathbf{F}_i. &lt;/math&gt;

It is useful to note that the point of application '''R''' of the resultant force may be anywhere along the line of action of '''F''' without changing the value of the associated torque.  To see this add the vector k'''F''' to the point of application '''R''' in the calculation of the associated torque,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} = \sum_{i=1}^n (\mathbf{R}_i-(\mathbf{R}+k\mathbf{F}))\times \mathbf{F}_i. &lt;/math&gt;
The right side of this equation can be separated into the original;formula for '''T''' plus the additional term including k'''F''',
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} = \sum_{i=1}^n (\mathbf{R}_i-\mathbf{R})\times \mathbf{F}_i - \sum_{i=1}^n k\mathbf{F}\times \mathbf{F}_i=\sum_{i=1}^n (\mathbf{R}_i-\mathbf{R})\times \mathbf{F}_i,&lt;/math&gt;
because the second term is zero.  To see this notice that '''F''' is the sum of the vectors '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; which yields
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n k\mathbf{F}\times \mathbf{F}_i = k\mathbf{F}\times(\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{F}_i )=0,&lt;/math&gt;
thus the value of the associated torque is unchanged.

==Torque-free resultant==
It is useful to consider whether there is a point of application '''R''' such that the associated torque is zero.  This point is defined by the property
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R} \times \mathbf{F} = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{R}_i \times \mathbf{F}_i, &lt;/math&gt;
where '''F''' is resultant force and '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; form the system of forces.

Notice that this equation for '''R''' has a solution only if the sum of the individual torques on the right side yield a vector that is perpendicular to '''F'''.  Thus, the condition that a system of forces has a torque-free resultant can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}\cdot(\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{R}_i \times \mathbf{F}_i )=0.&lt;/math&gt;
If this condition is satisfied then there is a point of application for the resultant which results in a pure force.  If this condition is not satisfied, then the system of forces includes a pure torque for every point of application.

==Wrench==
The forces and torques acting on a rigid body can be assembled into the pair of vectors called a [[Wrench (screw theory)|''wrench'']].&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Murray, Z. Li, and S. Sastry, [https://books.google.com/books?id=D_PqGKRo7oIC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=screw+theory+wrench&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=djPkCiYbpx&amp;sig=pRSbDjrT2ZBBu3H_tknhlT4HbGY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n5QZUM3sOqLqiwL04oHYAQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=screw%20theory%20wrench&amp;f=false ''A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation,''] CRC Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;If a system of forces and torques has a net resultant force '''F''' and a net resultant torque '''T''', then the entire system can be replaced by a force '''F''' and an arbitrarily located couple that yields a torque of '''T'''. In general, if '''F''' and '''T''' are orthogonal, it is possible to derive a radial vector '''R''' such that &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R}\times\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{T} &lt;/math&gt;, meaning that the single force '''F''', acting at displacement '''R''', can replace the system.  If the system is zero-force (torque only), it is termed a ''screw'' and is mathematically formulated as [[screw theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qu9IAAAAMAAJ&amp;ots=wwsm6pBaJa&amp;dq=The%20theory%20of%20screws%3A%20A%20study%20in%20the%20dynamics%20of%20a%20rigid%20body&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false R. S. Ball, ''The Theory of Screws: A study in the dynamics of a rigid body'', Hodges, Foster &amp; Co., 1876]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jv9mQyjRIw4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=geometric+design+of+linkages&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3L_5TcvZGaHV0QG2wMiDAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  J. M. McCarthy and G. S. Soh, ''Geometric Design of Linkages''. 2nd Edition, Springer 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The resultant force and torque on a rigid body obtained from a system of forces '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; i=1,...,n, is simply the sum of the individual wrenches W&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, that is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathsf{W} = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathsf{W}_i = \sum_{i=1}^n (\mathbf{F}_i, \mathbf{R}_i\times\mathbf{F}_i). &lt;/math&gt;
Notice that the case of two equal but opposite forces '''F''' and '''-F''' acting at points '''A''' and '''B''' respectively, yields the resultant W=('''F'''-'''F''',  '''A'''×'''F''' - '''B'''× '''F''') = (0, ('''A'''-'''B''')×'''F''').  This shows that wrenches of the form W=(0, '''T''') can be interpreted as pure torques.

He was killed in a crash of his [[Su-27]] [[fighter plane]] during an airshow in Salgareda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacefacts.de/english/bio_cosm.htm spacefacts.de re Stankevičius]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/astros/staicius.htm astronautix.com re Stankevičius] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412041701/http://www.astronautix.com/astros/staicius.htm |date=2015-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
In 1966 he has graduated from [[Chernigov Higher Aviation School]]. After that he served as an [[USSR]] pilot in [[Germany]], [[Egypt]], [[Turkmenistan|Turkmenia]]. In 1975 Stankevičius has graduated from the [[Fedotov Test Pilot School]] and became a [[test pilot]].&lt;ref name="ShLI2002"&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |date=2002 |editor-last=Знаменская |editor-first=Наталья |title=ШЛИ со временем |trans-title=ShLI in Time |url=https://search.rsl.ru/ru/search#yf=2002&amp;yt=2002&amp;q=%D1%88%D0%BB%D0%B8%20%D1%81%D0%BE%20%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BC |language=RU |edition=2 |location=Жуковский |publisher=ООО "Редакция газеты "Жуковские вести" |pages=400 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has accomplished [[spin (flight)|spin]] testing of [[MiG-29]]. He flew 57 types of aircraft and had over 4000 hours of flying experience. In 1982 he was graded as a 1st class test-pilot.

In 1979 he was assigned to prepare for 11F35 ([[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]], USSR space shuttle). In February 1982 he passed all the required exams and became the first Lithuanian [[astronaut|cosmonaut]]. After September 1984 he trained to fly the space shuttle Buran. Stankevičius accomplished 14 test-flights with Buran's counterpart [[OK-GLI|BTS-02]] aircraft and 6 taxi tests with Buran. He was both the pilot and the commander of the space shuttle.

In 1990 Rimantas Stankevičius participated the [[Everett Air Show]] with a [[Su-27]] fighter jet. Soon after his return home, he went to Italy to replace another USSR pilot in [[Salgareda Air Show]]. On 9 September, during a flight in the show in a Su-27, he started a [[Aerobatic maneuver|loop]] in a lower altitude than he estimated and made an unintentional touchdown. He died in the crash. The crash resulted in only one fatality aside from the pilot.

Stankevičius, along with Soviet Cosmonauts Igor Volk and Sergei Tresvyatskiy, worked closely with Americans in the late 1980s to improve relations during the Cold War. The three were involved in what is believed to be the first formation flight with Soviet SU-27 fighter planes and American F-16s in history in July 1990 (before the breakup of the USSR) at the Opening Ceremonies of the Goodwill Games in Seattle. The three also flew the first Americans, (8 members of the Organizing Committee of the 1990 Goodwill Games) since World War II in an [[Ilyushin Il-62]] from Seattle to [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]], USSR in 1989. Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky was one of the most important and secretive air and submarine bases in the USSR. ref {{ISBN|1-883697-67-0}} "Who the Hell is Bob?" pages 255-260; 278-280

==Death==
Stankevičius was killed in the crash of a [[Sukhoi Su-27]] fighter, '14 Red', at the Salgareda Air Show at [[Treviso, Italy]] on 9 September 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/staicius.htm|title=Stankiavicius|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412041701/http://www.astronautix.com/astros/staicius.htm|archivedate=12 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Footage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wlnnZZsx2k

'''SIT Graduate Institute''' (formally, the '''School for International Training''') is an accredited institution of higher education administered by [[World Learning]], a [[non-profit]] [[international development]] and [[education]] organization. The Graduate Institute offers [[master's degree]]s and graduate certificates in a variety of fields related to [[international education]] and [[sustainable development]]. Located in [[Brattleboro, Vermont]], the school also maintains a branch campus in downtown [[Washington, D.C.]]

==History==
The School for International Training (SIT) was established in 1964.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://graduate.sit.edu/sit-graduate-institute/sn/about-sit/history-and-mission/ SIT Graduate Institute, "History".] Accessed: Feb 22, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; SIT filled a need of returned [[Peace Corps]] volunteers by offering a graduate degree in international development. The Vermont campus originally consisted of a small collection of dorms around a Carriage House on a scenic farm on the north end of Brattleboro. These early Peace Corps volunteers took lessons in foreign languages with materials and teachers from the language training from their service, and The School for International Training began to expand its offerings. By 1968, the small but increasing number of returned Peace Corps volunteers were requesting a degree in Teaching English as a Second Language, a new specialty. In 1969, two graduate programs were developed, International Career Training (ICT), and Masters in Teaching Languages (MAT) ([[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[ESL]]). An undergraduate program, the World Issues Program (WIP), was developed in 1973 and resulted in 26 graduating classes. The WIP program was based on an experiential learning model. Students received their BA in International or Community Development, and International Studies. The last WIP class graduated in 1999.

The first MAT class consisted of three students, the second of 28 students, and the third of 38; in the fourth year the class size reached 50 students and stayed there for many years. ICTs spent part of their program on campus and part in internships around the world. MATs originally went to [[Mexico]] or [[Quebec]] for student teaching but by 1972, students began to develop other sites around the world. Eventually, the ICT program changed to PIM: Programs in Intercultural Management and developed specializations in NGS's and Civil Society, Peace and Conflict Transformation, Social Justice, Socially Responsible Management, Sustainable Development, International Education, Language and Culture, Teacher Preparation. [[Jody Williams]], an MAT graduate, won the [[Nobel Prize]] for her work on banning [[land mine]]s. [[Wangari Maathai]], former Trustee Emerita, won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for her work on sustainable development and [[democracy]] in [[Kenya]].

In the late 1990s the MAT department created the Teacher Knowledge Project as a way for teachers to work together using the reflective cycle (to inquire into their practice) and principles of Experiential Learning. This project resulted in research in schools in [[New England]] focusing on [[reflective teaching]], [[mentoring]] and structured [[language immersion]]. Other offshoots of the MAT program include a four-week [[English as a foreign or second language|TESOL]] Certificate program that offers basic preparation for teaching English as a second or foreign language and the ACCESS program that helps content teachers develop skills for working with English language learners in their classes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sit.edu/graduate/6882.htm SIT Graduate Institute, "TESOL Overview"] Accessed: May 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the School for International Training hosted and worked with [[North American Summer Esperanto Institute|Nord-Amerika Somera Kursaro]] (NASK), [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]], OTEP, [[USAID]] and other international groups through the World Learning network.

'''Sheila Christina Tinney''' (''née'' Power, 15 January 1918 – 27 March 2010) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[mathematical physicist]]. Her 1941 PhD from the [[University of Edinburgh]], completed under the supervision of [[Max Born]] in just two years, is believed to make her the first Irish-born and -raised woman to receive a doctorate in the mathematical sciences.&lt;ref name=mactutor&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Tinney|title=Sheila Christina Power Tinney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:DIAS 1942 photo.jpg|thumb|350px|Sheila Tinney, Paul Dirac, and other physicists and mathematicians at DIAS in 1942]]
Sheila Christina Power was the fourth of six children born in [[Galway]] city to Michael Power (aka Mícheál de Paor, originally from rural [[Kilkenny]], Chair of Mathematics at [[University College Galway]] from 1912–1955) and Christina Cunniffe (who died in childbirth when Sheila was 12). She was educated by the Dominican nuns, both in Galway and in Dublin, and was awarded Honours in Mathematics in the Leaving Certificate Examination (the nation's secondary school exit exam), one of only 8 girls to do so in the whole country. After one year attending UCG, she switched to [[University College Dublin]], from which she graduated with a BSc in 1938, with First Class Honours in Mathematics, and ranked at the top of her class. She did her Master's at UCD in 1939, and was subsequently awarded a [[National University of Ireland]] travelling studentship, which enabled her to undertake research at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in Scotland.  Two years later, in 1941, she earned her doctorate under the supervision of the celebrated physicist [[Max Born]] on the stability of [[crystal lattice]]s.&lt;ref name=times_obit&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/pioneer-in-field-of-mathematical-physics-1.683814 The Irish Times Obituary: Sheila Tinney] Pioneer in field of mathematical physics&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Dublin, she became an assistant lecturer at University College Dublin, and was also one of the first three scholars appointed to the brand new [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]] (DIAS),  in October 1941. While at the DIAS she worked with [[Paul Dirac]], [[Arthur Eddington]] and [[Erwin Schrödinger]].&lt;ref name=times_obit/&gt;  She developed a great interest in [[quantum physics]], and wrote papers with Schrödinger, [[Hideki Yukawa]], and [[Walter Heitler]].  From September 1948 to June 1949 she took a leave of absence from UCD and was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton where worked in an environment that included [[Freeman Dyson]], [[Hermann Weyl]], [[Harish-Chandra]], and [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ias.edu/scholars/sheila-christina-power IAS Scholars: Sheila Christina Power]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mactutor/&gt;

She developed the first mathematical courses on quantum mechanics at UCD and taught the subject to generations of students there, until her early retirement in 1979.

In 1952, she married Seán Tinney, a former engineering student she had lectured, and the couple's three children include classical pianist [[Hugh Tinney]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://coraifeartaigh.wordpress.com/2014/05/23/dyson-are-brains-analog-or-digital/ Freeman Dyson and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies] [[Lochlainn O’Raifeartaigh]] blog, 23 May 2014, "The connection is that Hugh’s late mother, Professor Sheila Tinney, was an accomplished mathematician who spent time at Princeton IAS"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pioneer and role model for women in academia==
By 1900 the campaign for the acceptance of women in academia was largely successful, and even [[Trinity College Dublin]] began admitting women in 1904.  But the [[Royal Irish Academy]] (RIA) threw up legal obstacles and did not bow to the inevitable until 1949 when it finally admitted four women–one of them Sheila Tinney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyireland.com/18th-19th-century-history/better-without-the-ladies-the-royal-irish-academy-and-the-admission-of-women-members/ Better without the ladies: the Royal Irish Academy and the admission of women members] History of Ireland Magazine, Vol 19, Nov/Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/how-to-draw-more-women-into-stem-1.2729542 How to draw more women into Stem] [[The Irish Times]], 28 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016 the RIA honoured Tinney by hanging her portrait along with 11 other female academic leaders on its walls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rte.ie/culture/2016/1209/837738-women-on-walls/ Putting Ireland's groundbreaking Women on Walls at the RIA] Royal Irish Academy, 7 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Even at University College Dublin, Tinney faced the entrenched prejudice against women.  One professor emeritus recalls the sympathy she received when, early in her career, she was passed over for promotion in favour of a younger, and demonstrably less academically qualified, male colleague.  During her time at UCD she gained a reputation for helping younger female colleagues who were trying to develop their careers.&lt;ref name=times_obit/&gt;

==Legacy==
The special medal cast for the 25 Global Winners of [[The Undergraduate Awards]] in 2016 (presented 10 November in Dublin) honoured Sheila Tinney, "trail-blazing and brilliant academic, who achieved astounding success through self-belief and determination."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undergraduateawards.com/undergraduate-awards-2016-medal/ The Undergraduate Awards 2016 Medal] UA Blog, 13 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, a plaque was unveiled in UCD in honour of Tinney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/newsandopinion/news/2018/august/30/conferencecelebratesdrsheilatinneyfirstirishwomanawardedphdinmathematics/|title=Conference celebrates Dr Sheila Tinney: first Irish woman awarded PhD in Mathematics|last=|first=|date=|website=University College Dublin|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Social and Behavioral Sciences Team''' is a group of experts in applied behavioral science that translates findings and methods from the social and behavioral sciences into improvements in Federal policies and programs for the benefit of the American people. The SBST is chaired by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and represents a dozen member agencies across the Federal Government, as well as offices within the Executive Office of the President. SBST also receives critical support from the General Services Administration. The Executive Order charges SBST with providing advice and policy guidance to Federal agencies in support of the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/15/fact-sheet-president-obama-signs-executive-order-white-house-announces|title=Fact Sheet: President Obama Signs Executive Order; White House Announces New Steps to Improve Federal Programs by Leveraging Research Insights|date=2015-09-15|newspaper=whitehouse.gov|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1428">'''Flight 14P''' of [[SpaceShipOne]] was its third powered flight, which occurred on May 13, 2004.  The [[pilot (spaceflight)|pilot]] was [[Mike Melvill]].

SpaceShipOne was released from [[Scaled Composites White Knight|White Knight]] at an altitude of 46,000 feet (14.0 km) and a speed of 120 [[knot (unit)|knot]]s (62 [[Metre per second|m/s]]).  After ten seconds the [[rocket]] was lit, for a 55 [[second]] burn.

At burn-out the altitude was 150,000 feet (45.7 km) and the [[Mach number]] was 2.5.  The craft then coasted to an [[apogee]] altitude of 211,400 feet (64.3 km).

At one point during the flight, the [[avionics]] computer froze up and had to be rebooted. Melvill flew the aircraft manually until the computer became operable again.

During reentry, the craft attained Mach 1.9 and deceleration of 3.5 [[g-force|''g'']] (34 m/s²).  The craft switched to glider configuration at 55,000 feet (17.4 km). The craft returned to the [[Mojave Spaceport|spaceport]] and landed safely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2959">In [[science]] and [[research]], an '''attribute''' is a characteristic of an object (person, thing, etc.).&lt;ref name=babbie&gt;[[Earl R. Babbie]], ''The Practice of Social Research", 12th edition, Wadsworth Publishing, 2009, {{ISBN|0-495-59841-0}}, p. 14-18&lt;/ref&gt; Attributes are closely related to variables. A '''variable''' is a [[logic]]al set of attributes.&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt; Variables can "vary" - for example, be high or low.&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt; How high, or how low, is determined by the value of the attribute (and in fact, an attribute could be just the word "low" or "high").&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt; ''(For example see: [[Binary option]])''

While an attribute is often intuitive, the '''variable''' is the [[operationalization|operationalized]] way in which the attribute is represented for further [[data processing]]. In data processing [[data]] are often represented by a combination of ''items'' (objects organized in rows), and multiple variables (organized in columns).

Values of each variable statistically "vary" (or are distributed) across the variable's domain. A domain is a set of all possible values that a variable is allowed to have. The values are ordered in a logical way and must be defined for each variable. Domains can be bigger or smaller. The smallest possible domains have those variables that can only have two values, also called ''binary'' (or dichotomous) variables. Bigger domains have ''non-dichotomous'' variables and the ones with a higher [[level of measurement]]. (See also [[domain of discourse]].)

Semantically, greater precision can be obtained when considering an object's characteristics by distinguishing 'attributes' (characteristics that are attributed to an object) from '[[Phenotypic_trait|traits]]' (characteristics that are inherent to the object).

==Examples==
[[Ageing|Age]] is an attribute that can be operationalized in many ways. It can be dichotomized so that only two values - "old" and "young" - are allowed for further data processing. In this case the attribute "age" is operationalized as a binary variable. If more than two values are possible and they can be ordered, the attribute is represented by ordinal variable, such as "young", "middle age", and "old". Next it can be made of rational values, such as 1, 2, 3.... 99&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt;

The "social class" attribute can be operationalized in similar ways as age, including "lower", "middle" and "upper class" and each class could be differentiated between upper and lower, transforming thus changing the three attributes into six (see the [[Social_class#William_Lloyd_Warner|model proposed by William Lloyd Warner]]) or it could use different terminology (such as the [[working class]] as in the [[Social_class#Gilbert_.26_Kahl|model by Gilbert and Kahl]]).

'''Zipf's law''' ({{IPAc-en|z|ɪ|f}}) is an [[empirical law]] formulated using [[mathematical statistics]] that refers to the fact that many types of data studied in the [[physical science|physical]] and [[social science|social]] sciences can be approximated with a Zipfian distribution, one of a family of related discrete [[power law]] [[probability distribution]]s.  ''Zipf distribution'' is related to the [[zeta distribution]], but is not identical.

For example, Zipf's law states that given some [[Text corpus|corpus]] of [[natural language]] utterances, the frequency of any word is [[inversely proportional]] to its rank in the [[frequency table]]. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc.: the [[rank-frequency distribution]] is an inverse relation. For example, in the [[Brown Corpus]] of American English text, the word ''[[English articles#Definite article|the]]'' is the most frequently occurring word, and by itself accounts for nearly 7% of all word occurrences (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf's Law, the second-place word ''of'' accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by ''and'' (28,852). Only 135 vocabulary items are needed to account for half the Brown Corpus.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=An introduction to textual econometrics|first1=Stephen|last1=Fagan|first2=Ramazan|last2=Gençay|pages=133–153|title=Handbook of Empirical Economics and Finance|editor1-first=Aman|editor1-last=Ullah|editor2-first=David E.

The law is named after the American [[linguistics|linguist]] [[George Kingsley Zipf]] (1902–1950), who popularized it and sought to explain it (Zipf 1935, 1949), though he did not claim to have originated it.&lt;ref name=Powers1998&gt;{{cite journal| last = Powers | first = David M W| url=http://aclweb.org/anthology/W98-1218 |title=Applications and explanations of Zipf's law| year = 1998| conference = Joint conference on new methods in language processing and computational natural language learning| pages = 151–160| publisher = Association for Computational Linguistics }}&lt;/ref&gt; The French stenographer [[Jean-Baptiste Estoup]] (1868–1950) appears to have noticed the regularity before Zipf.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher D.

The appearance of the distribution in rankings of cities by population was first noticed by Felix Auerbach in 1913.&lt;ref name="Auerbach1913"/&gt; Empirically, a data set can be tested to see whether Zipf's law applies by checking the goodness of fit of an empirical distribution to the hypothesized power law distribution with a [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]], and then comparing the (log) likelihood ratio of the power law distribution to alternative distributions like an exponential distribution or lognormal distribution.&lt;ref name="Clausetetal2009"&gt;Clauset, A., Shalizi, C. R., &amp; Newman, M. E. J. (2009). Power-Law Distributions in Empirical Data. SIAM Review, 51(4), 661–703. doi:10.1137/070710111&lt;/ref&gt; When Zipf's law is checked for cities, a better fit has been found with exponent ''s'' = 1.07; i.e. the &lt;math&gt;n^{th}&lt;/math&gt; largest settlement is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n^{1.07}}&lt;/math&gt; the size of the largest settlement.

==Theoretical review==
Zipf's law is most easily observed by [[graph of a function|plotting]] the data on a [[log-log]] graph, with the axes being [[logarithm|log]] (rank order) and log (frequency). For example, the word ''"the"'' (as described above) would appear at ''x'' = log(1), ''y'' = log(69971). It is also possible to plot reciprocal rank against frequency or reciprocal frequency or interword interval against rank.&lt;ref name=Powers1998/&gt; The data conform to Zipf's law to the extent that the plot is [[linear equation|linear]].

Formally, let:
* ''N'' be the number of elements;
* ''k'' be their rank;
* ''s'' be the value of the exponent characterizing the distribution.
Zipf's law then predicts that out of a population of ''N'' elements, the normalized frequency of elements of rank ''k'', ''f''(''k'';''s'',''N''), is:

:&lt;math&gt;f(k;s,N)=\frac{1/k^s}{\sum\limits_{n=1}^N (1/n^s)}&lt;/math&gt;

Zipf's law holds if the number of elements with a given frequency is a random variable with power law distribution &lt;math&gt;p(f) = \alpha f^{-1-1/s}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Adamic2000&gt;Adamic, Lada A. (2000) [http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/idl/papers/ranking/ranking.html "Zipf, Power-laws, and Pareto - a ranking tutorial", originally published at http://www.parc.xerox.com/istl/groups/iea/papers/ranking/ranking.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026062626/http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/idl/papers/ranking/ranking.html |date=2007-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that this representation of Zipf's law is more suitable for statistical testing, and in this way it has been analyzed in more than 30,000 English texts. The goodness-of-fit tests yield that only about 15% of the texts are statistically compatible with this form of Zipf's law. Slight variations in the definition of Zipf's law can increase this percentage up to close to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Moreno-Sánchez|first = I|last2 = Font-Clos|first2 = F|last3 = Corral|first3 = A|date = 2016|title = Large-Scale Analysis of Zipf’s Law in English Texts|url =|journal = PLoS ONE|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0147073|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the example of the frequency of words in the English language, ''N'' is the number of words in the English language and, if we use the classic version of Zipf's law, the exponent ''s'' is 1. ''f''(''k'';&amp;nbsp;''s'',''N'') will then be the fraction of the time the ''k''th most common word occurs.

The law may also be written:

:&lt;math&gt;f(k;s,N)=\frac{1}{k^s H_{N,s}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''H&lt;sub&gt;N,s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''N''th generalized [[harmonic number]].

The simplest case of Zipf's law is a "&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; function." Given a set of Zipfian distributed frequencies, sorted from most common to least common, the second most common frequency will occur ½ as often as the first.  The third most common frequency will occur ⅓ as often as the first. The fourth most common frequency will occur ¼ as often as the first. The ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; most common frequency will occur &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as often as the first. However, this cannot hold exactly, because items must occur an integer number of times; there cannot be 2.5 occurrences of a word. Nevertheless, over fairly wide ranges, and to a fairly good approximation, many natural phenomena obey Zipf's law.

In human languages, word frequencies have a very heavy-tailed distribution, and can therefore be modeled reasonably well by a Zipf distribution with an ''s'' close to 1.

As long as the exponent ''s'' exceeds 1, it is possible for such a law to hold with infinitely many words, since if ''s''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 then
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta (s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s}&lt;\infty. \!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ζ'' is [[Riemann zeta function|Riemann's zeta function]].

Although Zipf’s Law holds for all languages, even non-natural ones like [[Esperanto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Bill Manaris |author2=Luca Pellicoro |author3=George Pothering |author4=Harland Hodges |title=INVESTIGATING ESPERANTO’S STATISTICAL PROPORTIONS RELATIVE TO OTHER LANGUAGES USING NEURAL NETWORKS AND ZIPF’S LAW |url=http://www.cs.cofc.edu/~manaris/uploads/Main/IASTED2006.pdf |journal=[[Artificial Intelligence and Applications]] |date=13 February 2006 |location=Innsbruck, Austria |pages=102–108 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305040450/http://www.cs.cofc.edu/~manaris/uploads/Main/IASTED2006.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the reason is still not well understood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Léon Brillouin]], ''La science et la théorie de l'information'', 1959, réédité en 1988, traduction anglaise rééditée en 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may be partially explained by the statistical analysis of randomly generated texts. Wentian Li has shown that in a document in which each character has been chosen randomly from a uniform distribution of all letters (plus a space character), the "words" follow the general trend of Zipf's law (appearing approximately linear on log-log plot).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wentian Li |title=Random Texts Exhibit Zipf's-Law-Like Word Frequency Distribution |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.164.8422&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Information Theory]] |volume=38 |issue=6 |year=1992 |pages=1842–1845 |doi=10.1109/18.165464 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527030629/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.164.8422&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |archivedate=2016-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Vitold Belevitch]] in a paper, ''On the Statistical Laws of Linguistic Distribution'' offered a mathematical derivation.  He took a large class of well-behaved [[statistical distribution]]s (not only the [[normal distribution]]) and expressed them in terms of rank. He then expanded each expression into a [[Taylor series]]. In every case Belevitch obtained the remarkable result that a first-order truncation of the series resulted in Zipf's law. Further, a second-order truncation of the Taylor series resulted in [[Zipf–Mandelbrot law|Mandelbrot's law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter G.

The [[principle of least effort]] is another possible explanation:
Zipf himself proposed that neither speakers nor hearers using a given language want to work any harder than necessary to reach understanding, and the process that results in approximately equal distribution of effort leads to the observed Zipf distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Similarly, [[preferential attachment]] (intuitively, "the rich get richer" or "success breeds success") that results in the [[Yule–Simon distribution]] has been shown to fit word frequency versus rank in language&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.4846.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610173330/http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.4846.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and population versus city rank&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.08535.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-01-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610203644/http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.08535.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; better than Zipf's law. It was originally derived to explain population versus rank in species by Yule, and applied to cities by Simon.

==Related laws==

[[Image:Wikipedia-n-zipf.png|thumb|left|320px|A plot of word frequency in Wikipedia (November 27, 2006). The plot is in [[log-log]] coordinates. ''x''&amp;nbsp; is rank of a word in the frequency table; ''y''&amp;nbsp; is the total number of the word’s occurrences. Most popular words are "the", "of" and "and", as expected. Zipf's law corresponds to the middle linear portion of the curve, roughly following the green (1/''x'')&amp;nbsp; line, while the early part is closer to the magenta (1/''x''&lt;sup&gt;0.5&lt;/sup&gt;) line while the later part is closer to the cyan (1/(''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2.0&lt;/sup&gt;) line. These lines correspond to three distinct parameterizations of the Zipf–Mandelbrot distribution, overall a [[broken power law]] with three segments: a head, middle, and tail.]]

''Zipf's law'' in fact refers more generally to frequency distributions of "rank data," in which the relative frequency of the ''n''th-ranked item is given by the [[Zeta distribution]], 1/(''n''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;''ζ''(''s'')), where the parameter ''s''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 indexes the members of this family of [[probability distribution]]s.  Indeed, ''Zipf's law'' is sometimes synonymous with "zeta distribution," since probability distributions are sometimes called "laws". This distribution is sometimes called the '''Zipfian''' distribution.

A generalization of Zipf's law is the [[Zipf–Mandelbrot law]], proposed by [[Benoît Mandelbrot]], whose frequencies are:

:&lt;math&gt;f(k;N,q,s)=\frac{[\text{constant}]}{(k+q)^s}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The "constant" is the reciprocal of the [[Hurwitz zeta function]] evaluated at ''s''. In practice, as easily observable in distribution plots for large corpora, the observed distribution can be modelled more accurately as a sum of separate distributions for different subsets or subtypes of words that follow different parameterizations of the Zipf–Mandelbrot distribution, in particular the closed class of functional words exhibit ''s'' lower than 1, while open-ended vocabulary growth with document size and corpus size require ''s'' greater than 1 for convergence of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|Generalized Harmonic Series]].&lt;ref name=Powers1998/&gt;

Zipfian distributions can be obtained from [[Pareto distribution]]s by an exchange of variables.&lt;ref name="Adamic2000"/&gt;

The Zipf distribution is sometimes called the '''discrete Pareto distribution'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Univariate Discrete Distributions|edition=second|year=1992|author1=N. L. Johnson |author2=S. Kotz |author3=A. W. Kemp  |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-471-54897-9|ref=harv}}, p. 466.&lt;/ref&gt; because it is analogous to the continuous [[Pareto distribution]] in the same way that the [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|discrete uniform distribution]] is analogous to the [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|continuous uniform distribution]].

The tail frequencies of the [[Yule–Simon distribution]] are approximately

:&lt;math&gt;f(k;\rho) \approx \frac{[\text{constant}]}{k^{\rho+1}}&lt;/math&gt;

for any choice of ''ρ'' &gt; 0.

In the [[parabolic fractal distribution]], the logarithm of the frequency is a quadratic polynomial of the logarithm of the rank. This can markedly improve the fit over a simple power-law relationship.&lt;ref name="Galien"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.zonnet.nl/galien8/factor/factor.html |title=Factorial randomness: the Laws of Benford and Zipf with respect to the first digit distribution of the factor sequence from the natural numbers |author=Johan Gerard van der Galien |date=2003-11-08 |accessdate=8 July 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305150334/http://home.zonnet.nl/galien8/factor/factor.html |archivedate=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like fractal dimension, it is possible to calculate Zipf dimension, which is a useful parameter in the analysis of texts.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Eftekhari (2006) Fractal geometry of texts. ''Journal of Quantitative Linguistic'' 13(2-3): 177–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that [[Benford's law]] is a special bounded case of Zipf's law,&lt;ref name="Galien"/&gt; with the connection between these two laws being explained by  their both originating from scale invariant functional relations from statistical physics and critical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;L.

== Applications ==
In [[information theory]], a symbol (event, signal) of probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;\log_2(1/p)&lt;/math&gt; [[bit]]s of information. Hence, Zipf law for natural numbers: &lt;math&gt;\Pr(x) \approx 1/x&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent with number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;\log_2(x)&lt;/math&gt; bits of information. To add information from a symbol of probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; into information already stored in a natural number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, we should go to &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\log_2(x') \approx \log_2(x) + \log_2(1/p)&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently &lt;math&gt;x' \approx x/p&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, in standard binary system we would have &lt;math&gt;x' = 2x + s&lt;/math&gt;, what is optimal for &lt;math&gt;\Pr(s=0) = \Pr(s=1) = 1/2&lt;/math&gt; probability distribution. Using &lt;math&gt;x' \approx x/p&lt;/math&gt; rule for a general probability distribution is the base of [[Asymmetric Numeral Systems]] family of  [[entropy coding]] methods used in [[data compression]], which state distribution is also governed by Zipf law.

Zipf's law also has been used for extraction of parallel fragments of texts out of comparable corpora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2016/pdf/BUCC04.pdf |title=Parallel Document Identification using Zipf's Law |last1=Mohammadi |first1=Mehdi |author-link1= |date=2016 |publisher= |book-title=Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora |pages=21–25, |location=Portorož, Slovenia |conference=LREC 2016 |id= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323154706/https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2016/pdf/BUCC04.pdf |archivedate=2018-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
