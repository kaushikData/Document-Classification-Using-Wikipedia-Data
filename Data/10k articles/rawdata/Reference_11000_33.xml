      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3978">'''ALA-LC''' ([[American Library Association]] - [[Library of Congress]]) is a set of standards for [[romanization]], the representation of text in other [[writing system]]s using the [[Latin script]].

==Applications==
The system is used to represent bibliographic information by North American libraries and the British Library (for acquisitions since 1975)&lt;ref name=British_Library&gt;"[http://www.bl.uk/help/search-for-cyrillic-items Searching for Cyrillic items in the catalogues of the British Library: guidelines and transliteration tables]"&lt;/ref&gt;
and in publications throughout the English-speaking world.

The [[Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules]] require catalogers to romanize access points from their non-Roman originals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agenbroad|first1=James E.|title=Romanization Is Not Enough|journal=Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly|date=5 June 2006|volume=42|issue=2|pages=21–34|doi=10.1300/J104v42n02_03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as the [[MARC standards]] have been expanded to allow records containing [[Unicode]] characters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCallum|first1=S.H.|title=MARC: keystone for library automation|journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing|volume=24|issue=2|pages=34–49|doi=10.1109/MAHC.2002.1010068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aliprand|first1=Joan M.|title=The Structure and Content of MARC 21 Records in the Unicode Environment|journal=Information Technology and Libraries|date=22 January 2013|volume=24|issue=4|doi=10.6017/ital.v24i4.3381}}&lt;/ref&gt;
many cataloguers now include bibliographic data in both Roman and original scripts. The emerging [[Resource Description and Access]] continues many of AACR's recommendations but refers to the process as "transliteration" rather than "Romanization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seikel|first1=Michele|title=No More Romanizing: The Attempt to Be Less Anglocentric in RDA|journal=Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly|date=9 October 2009|volume=47|issue=8|pages=741–748|doi=10.1080/01639370903203192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scripts==
The ALA-LC Romanization includes over 70 romanization tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALA-LC Romanization Tables|url=https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/roman.html|website=Cataloging and Acquisitions|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here are some examples of tables:
* A [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] Romanization table was created by the LC and ALA in 2012 and subsequently approved by the Cherokee Tri-Council meeting in [[Cherokee, North Carolina]]. It was the first ALA-LC Romanization table for a Native American syllabary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cherokee Romanization Table|url=https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/roman_cherokee.html|website=Cataloging and Acquisitions|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=2 June 2014|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] Romanization table used the [[Wade–Giles]] transliteration system until 1997, when the Library of Congress (LC) announced a decision to switch to the [[Pinyin]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Council on East Asian Libraries (CEAL) Pinyin Liaison Group|title=Final Report on Pinyin Conversion|journal=Chinese Librarianship: an International Electronic Journal|date=March 2000|volume=9|url=http://www.white-clouds.com/iclc/cliej/cl9ceal.htm|accessdate=2 June 2014|issn=1089-4667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Catalogue of Crime''''' is a [[critique]] of [[crime fiction]] by [[Jacques Barzun]] and Wendell Hertig Taylor, first published in 1971. The book was awarded a Special [[Edgar Award]] from the [[Mystery Writers of America]] in 1972. A revised and enlarged edition was published in 1989.

==Purpose==
{{quotation|This book is for readers of crime fiction. By offering fact and opinion about authors and their works, from Voltaire's ''Zadig'' to the latest tale published at the time of our going to press (1988), it enables the connoisseur and the neophyte to find, with greater confidence than luck provides, stories good to read or good to avoid.|Jacques Barzun in the preface to the second edition of ''A Catalogue of Crime''&lt;ref name="COC 2"/&gt;{{Rp|ix}}}}

In the preface to the 1989 second edition of ''A Catalogue of Crime'', Jacques Barzun credits the contributions of Wendell Hertig Taylor, who died in November 1985. "He had finished, I am happy to say, his half of the substantive work [and] is therefore as fully co-author of this edition as of the first. Had he lived, it would have appeared much sooner."&lt;ref name="COC 2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barzun |first1=Jacques |authorlink1=Jacques Barzun |last2=Taylor |first2=Wendell Hertig |date=1989 |orig-year=1971 |title=A Catalogue of Crime |location=New York |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Harper (publisher)|Harper &amp; Row]] |page= |isbn=0060157968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|x}}

==Layout==
The work contains 952 pages. It is divided as follows:

*''Part I    Novels of Detection, Crime, Mystery, and Espionage'' (pages 1–566)
*''Part II   Short Stories, Collections, Anthologies, Magazines, Pastiches, and Plays'' (pages 569-698)
*''Part III  Studies and Histories of the Genre, Lives of Writers, and the Literature of "Edwin Drood"'' (pages 701-754)
*''Part IV   True Crime: Trials, Narratives of Cases, Criminology and Police Science, Espionage and Cryptography'' (pages 757-858)
*''Part V    The Literature of [[Sherlock Holmes]] : Studies and Annotations of the Tales,  Nonfiction Parodies, and Critical Pastiches'' (pages 859-874)

===Entries===
The book contains a total of 5,045 entries sorted, in each of the sections, in alphabetical order by the author's last name; where there is more than one entry for an author, each is in alphabetical order of the name of the work. Some entries are very short (one might say curt): one such—the only one for the author named—is:

1587 GRIFFIN, FRANK, ''Appointment with My Lady''  West 1946

''A good opening chapter, after which everything goes to pieces. The narrator-hero always shouts and commits acts, including murder, without rhyme or reason.''

The "West 1946" refers to the publisher, [[John Westhouse Publishers]], and to the year of publication.

However, there are fifty-one entries for the prolific [[Agatha Christie]]. Christie wrote many other mystery stories, using several different detectives but Barzun and Taylor chose to review these only.

The first entry (no. 749) for her ''After the Funeral'', published in 1953, says in part:

''Not one of Agatha's best. The scheme is obvious and worked repetitiously.''

The last entry (no. 799)  for her ''Why Didn't They Ask Evans?'', published in 1935, contains three sentences, one of which is:

''The merit consists largely in Agatha's maintaining suspense about the small mystery of a name.''

The other forty-nine entries for Christie are quite mixed. They range in praise (or lack thereof) from:

''A Poirot story, and very dull...'' (entry no. 768, re ''Hickory, Dickory, Death'', published in 1956) to:

''A triumph of her art...of motive-building. That is where A.C. is unrivaled. She knows how to make plausible the divergence between action and motive that maintains uncertainty until the physical clues...mesh with motive to disclose the culprit.'' (entry no. 769 re ''The Hollow'', published in 1946).

Part V  ''The Literature of Sherlock Holmes...'' contains 81 entries (numbers 4965 through 5045). Included are, of course,  [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] himself, the originator of Holmes and the author of the 60 Holmes stories (56 short stories and four novelas). Also represented are a host of writers, some well-known from their works in other fields, and others little known to the general public but recognized by Sherlockian scholars as having made notable contributions to the Holmesian literature.

Among the former are [[Isaac Asimov]], the renowned science-fiction writer; the [[Roman Catholic]] clergyman [[Ronald Knox]]; and [[Christopher Morley]], a long-time writer for the ''[[Saturday Review of Literature]]'' and author of some 50 literary works, among the best known of which are ''Kitty Foyle'' and ''Parnassus on Wheels''; and, of course, [[Jacques Barzun]] himself. In the latter category are [[Dorothy Sayers]], the British crime novelist (whose Lord Peter Wimsey stories are the best known); [[Howard Haycraft]], a U.S. publishing executive whose ''The Art of the Mystery Story'' (published in 1946) is a recognized survey of the mystery genre; and Edgar Smith, a [[General Motors]] corporate executive who was one of the U.S. founders of the [[Baker Street Irregulars]], the first organized group in the United States dedicated to the formation of local groups of Holmes aficionados around the country (called "scion societies") for the purpose of meeting regularly for the scholarly study of the Holmes adventures and to participate in such activities of other scion societies, in the United States and around the world.

==Reception==
''A Catalogue of Crime'' received a Special [[Edgar Award]] in 1972 from the [[Mystery Writers of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theedgars.com/awards/ |title=Search the Edgars Database |publisher=[[Mystery Writers of America]] |access-date=2015-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book won immediate praise for its sections on studies and histories of crime fiction, true crime, the Sherlock Holmes canon and stories of the supernatural, and for assembling the most complete annotated bibliography of mystery and detective fiction then known. But upon its publication and in the years since, ''A Catalogue of Crime'' has been criticized for its errors, omissions and genteel point of view. [[Ross Macdonald]]'s May 1971 review for ''The New York Times'' is headed, "A study of mystery and detective fiction—massive and limited":&lt;ref name="Macdonald"&gt;{{cite news |last=Macdonald |first=Ross |authorlink=Ross Macdonald |date=May 16, 1971 |title=A Catalogue of Crime (review) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/16/archives/a-catalogue-of-crime-by-jacques-barzun-and-wendell-hertig-taylor.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location= |access-date=2015-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are given pages of descriptions of books by such respectable but pedestrian writers as [[Cecil Street|John Rhode]] and [[Freeman Wills Crofts]], while a brilliant innovator and master of construction like [[Eric Ambler]] is represented in the main descriptive text by two books. [[Graham Greene]], perhaps the most distinguished crime novelist of this century, is represented by a single early work, "A Gun for Sale," with the thumbs-down comment, "Suspense only." [[Georges Simenon]] has just one entry. [[Jorge Luis Borges]], probably Poe's greatest living literary descendant, is left out entirely. ... An even more striking and inexplicable omission is that of [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s ''[[The Glass Key]]'', which was Hammett's own favorite among his novels.&lt;ref name="Macdonald"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"While any ambitious bibliographical/critical work of this scope is bound to contain errors, ''A Catalogue of Crime'' has some true honkers," wrote Kevin Burton Smith, editor of The Thrilling Detective website. "Some of the omissions are truly jaw-dropping, and some of the critiques are almost cute in their old-fashioned, damn-the-facts way. Its age is showing, more than most. ... Nonetheless, it's an important source, albeit more entertaining at this point than informative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thrillingdetective.com/trivia/triv73.html |title=Bibliography, General Reference |last=Smith |first=Kevin Burton |date= |website=The Thrilling Detective |publisher= |access-date=2015-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aide-mémoire''' is a [[List of French expressions in English|French loanword]] meaning "a memory-aid; a reminder or memorandum, especially a book or document serving this purpose".

In [[international relations]], an '''aide-mémoire''' ({{IPA-fr|ɛdmemwaʁ}}, ''memory aid'') is a proposed agreement or negotiating text circulated informally among delegations for discussion without committing the originating delegation's country to the contents. It has no identified source, title, or attribution and no standing in the relationship involved. Such a text is also referred to as a '''non-paper''' in many international organizations, including the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]]/[[World Trade Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.enhancedif.org/en/file/291/download?token=JlSPv1g_ |title=AIDE MEMOIRE INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK DIAGNOSTIC STUDY – YEMEN PRELIMINARY VISIT FEBRUARY 4 –13, 2002.

Anthony Judge's work at the UIA, from the sixties until 2007, involved the adaptation of a wide range of emerging technologies to [[data management]] and [[knowledge management]], such as in-house computers, computer [[typesetting]], email, extension of email access to developing countries, [[metadata]] structure, [[collaborative editing]], [[Machine translation]], [[World Wide Web|web technology]],  [[VRML]], and inter-institutional data integration. A particular focus of his activities was on the possibilities of visualizing networks of organizations, world problems and other sets of data.&lt;ref name=cvUIA /&gt;

His work also involved the production of many research papers relevant to the strategic position of international organizations and the organized response to world problems. He wrote papers for instance on [[facilitation (business)|dialogue facilitation]], transformative conferencing, information system design, relevance of metaphor for governance and communication, transdisciplinarity, and concepts of human development.&lt;ref name=intercept&gt;http://www.un-intelligible.org/projects/intercept/intercept_proposal_1998.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Judge's direction the UIA developed the most extensive databases on global [[civil society]] and its networks. Those databases contain entries on international nonprofit bodies (61,000+), biography profiles (24,000+), international meetings (240,000+, past and future), world problems (56,000+), global strategies (32,000+), concepts of human development (4,800+), human values (3,300+), and more. Additionally, the number of links between different entries in the databases reaches over 2,000,000.&lt;ref name="UIA Databases"&gt;[http://www.uia.be/sites/uia.be/db/db/x.php UIA Online Databases].&lt;/ref&gt; Publications based on those databases include the [[Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential]], the [[Yearbook of International Organizations]], the [[International Congress Calendar]], and many other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laetusinpraesens.org/themes/bio_uia.php UIA-related Publication and Meeting Initiatives]&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge carried out also consulting and related activities with such institutions as the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), UNESCO, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), UN University (Tokyo), and the Commonwealth Science Council. One of his continuing research interests has been innovation in international meeting processes, especially in conferences with special problems. He thus played advisory and facilitatory roles in several events such as Inter-Sectoral Dialogue (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), World Futures Studies Conference (Turku, 1993), and Parliament of the World's Religions (Chicago, 1993).&lt;ref name=intercept /&gt;

== Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential ==
{{main|Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential}}

The ''Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential'', of which Anthony Judge has been the main architect, is a monumental work that came into being thanks to a partnership between the UIA and Mankind 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.m2000.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Initiated in 1972, that collaborative project gave rise to a succession of editions of the ''Encyclopedia'' in 1976, 1986, 1990, and 1995, while in 2000 a new edition was made available as a collection of online databases through the UIA website.&lt;ref name="UIA Databases" /&gt; In 2005, following disagreement over the partnership contract, and as Executive Secretary of Mankind 2000, Judge reframed the ''Encyclopedia'' as having been a strategic initiative of the Union of Intelligible Associations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-intelligible.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Slaughter]], in a review article, praised in particular the ''Encyclopedia'' introductory and commentary texts (available online),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-intelligible.org/projects/encycom.php Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential - Explanatory Comments]&lt;/ref&gt;  which were mainly written by Judge himself. Slaughter emphasized that the significance of this work is not its size or the scope of its tens of thousands of references, impressive though these are. It is rather in the nature of what has been attempted. Those numerous accompanying texts, he said, are good enough to be published separately because they contain highly cogent observations on the "global problematique", commentaries on the work of numerous great thinkers from a wide variety of fields, and an impressive array of insights about the epistemology, symbolism, metaphysics, metaphors and linguistic representations of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uia.org/reviews/slaught.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writings ==
Over the years Judge has produced more than 1,600 papers on information, knowledge organization, and other topics of relevance to governance, [[policy]] and strategy-making. Most of these papers are freely available on his personal website ''Laetus in Praesens'' (translated from Latin: ''Joy in the Present''),&lt;ref name=site /&gt; where they are listed by themes&lt;ref&gt;[http://laetusinpraesens.org/themes/ Research Themes and Papers]&lt;/ref&gt; and dates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laetusinpraesens.org/themes/alphayr.php Chronological Index: Titles Only (all years)]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them evolve around the quest to create a wiser and more functional world, especially in the perspective of learning from the relative lack of success of past initiatives in view of the dimensions and urgency of challenges. His work has a high level of novelty, for instance innovation in the use of [[metaphors]], [[art]], [[poetry]], [[debate]], [[data visualization|data-visualization]] and system structures. The exploratory interdisciplinary methodology of [[futures studies]], with which Judge has long been associated, also significantly gives form to his whole, unique, work.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20100114162806/http://www.ceptualinstitute.com/genre/judge/homepageAJ.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Now retired from the UIA, Anthony Judge is continuing to write within the context of an initiative called ''Union of Imaginable Associations'',&lt;ref name=imagin /&gt; and its associated projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-imagine.org/context/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Cape Matapan ''' ({{lang-el|Ναυμαχία του Ταινάρου}}) was a [[World War II|Second World War]] [[naval battle|naval engagement]] between British and Axis forces, fought from 27–29 March 1941. The [[Cape Matapan|cape]] is on the south-west coast of the [[Peloponnesus|Peloponnesian]] peninsula of [[Greece]]. Following the interception of Italian signals by the [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&amp;CS) at [[Bletchley Park]],&lt;ref name="Batey 2011 79–92"&gt;{{cite book |last=Batey |first=Mavis |editor-first=Michael |editor-last=Smith |title=The Bletchley Park Codebreakers |publisher=Biteback Publishing |year=2011 |pages=79–92 |chapter=Chapter 6: Breaking Italian Naval Enigma|isbn=978-1849540780 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ships of the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Australian Navy]], under the command of Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Cunningham]], intercepted and sank or severely damaged several ships of the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' under [[Squadron vice-admiral|Squadron-Vice-Admiral]] [[Angelo Iachino]]. The opening actions of the battle are also known in Italy as the '''Battle of Gaudo'''.

==Background==
In late March 1941, as British ships of the Mediterranean Fleet covered troop movements to Greece, [[Mavis Batey]], a cryptographer at [[Ultra|Bletchley Park]], made a breakthrough, reading the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Italian naval Enigma|Italian naval Enigma]] for the first time. The first message, the cryptic "Today’s the day minus three,"&lt;ref name=mavis&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/special-forces-obituaries/10447712/Mavis-Batey-obituary.html|title=Mavis Batey - obituary|work=Daily Telegraph|date=13 Nov 2013|accessdate=14 Nov 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was followed three days later by a second message reporting the sailing of an Italian battle fleet comprising one [[battleship]], six [[Heavy cruiser|heavy]] and two [[light cruiser]]s, plus [[destroyer]]s to attack the  merchant convoys supplying British forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/docview.rhtm/666218 |title=Spanish Enigma Welcomed To Bletchley Park |publisher=Bletchley Park |date=5 July 2012 |accessdate=13 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002234331/http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/docview.rhtm/666218 |archivedate=2 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As always with Enigma, the intelligence breakthrough was concealed from the Italians by ensuring there was a plausible reason for the Allies to have detected and intercepted their fleet. In this case, it was a carefully directed reconnaissance plane.&lt;ref&gt;See the report in the official Admiralty publication of 1943, ''East of Malta, West of Suez:'' The Admiralty Account of the Naval War in the Mediterranean (London, His Majesty's Stationery Office, 1943), where the detection of the Italian force is credited to "one of ''Formidable's'' aircraft on reconnaissance." (P. 56)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a further deception, Admiral Cunningham made a surreptitious exit after dark from a golf club in Alexandria to avoid being seen boarding his [[flagship]], the battleship {{HMS|Warspite|03|6}}. He had made a point of arriving at the club the same afternoon with his suitcase as if for an overnight stay, and spent time on the golf course within sight of the Japanese consul.&lt;ref name="Batey 2011 79–92"/&gt; An evening party on his flagship was advertised for that night but was never meant to take place.

At the same time, there was a failure of intelligence on the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] side. The Italians had been wrongly informed by the Germans that the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]] had only one operational battleship and no aircraft carriers.  In fact the Royal Navy had three battleships, while the damaged British [[aircraft carrier]] [[HMS Illustrious (87)|''Illustrious'']] had been replaced by [[HMS Formidable (67)|HMS ''Formidable'']].&lt;ref&gt;Admiralty: ''East of Malta, West of Suez'' (London, His Majesty's Stationery Office, 1943) P. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
===Opposing forces===
The [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] force was the British [[Mediterranean]] fleet, consisting of the aircraft carrier HMS ''Formidable'' and the [[battleship]]s {{HMS|Barham|04|6}}, {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}}, and ''Warspite''. The main fleet was accompanied by the [[10th Destroyer Flotilla]] ({{HMS|Greyhound|H05|6}} and {{HMS|Griffin|H31|2}}, and {{HMAS|Stuart|D-00/100|6}}, commanded by Commander [[Hector Waller|"Hec" Waller]], RAN), and the [[14th Destroyer Flotilla]] ({{HMS|Jervis|F00|6}}, {{HMS|Janus|F53|2}}, {{HMS|Mohawk|F31|2}}, and {{HMS|Nubian|F36|2}}, commanded by [[Philip Mack]]); also present were {{HMS|Hotspur|H01|6}} and {{HMS|Havock|H43|2}}. [[Force B]], under Admiral Sir [[Henry Pridham-Wippell]], consisted of the British [[light cruiser]]s {{HMS|Ajax|22|6}}, {{HMS|Gloucester|C62|2}}, and {{HMS|Orion|85|2}}, the Australian light cruiser {{HMAS|Perth|D29|6}}, and the British destroyers {{HMS|Hasty|H24|6}}, {{HMS|Hereward|H93|2}}, and {{HMS|Ilex|D61|2}}. The Australian {{HMAS|Vendetta|D69|6}} had returned to [[Alexandria]]. Allied warships attached to [[convoy]]s were available: {{HMS|Defender|H07|6}}, {{HMS|Jaguar|F34|2}}, and {{HMS|Juno|F46|2}} waited in the [[Cythera (island)|Kithira]] Channel and {{HMS|Decoy|H75|6}}, {{HMS|Carlisle|D67|2}}, {{HMS|Calcutta|D82|2}}, and {{HMS|Bonaventure|31|2}} and {{HMAS|Vampire|D68|6}} were nearby.

The Italian fleet was led by Iachino's flagship, the modern battleship {{Ship|Italian battleship|Vittorio Veneto||2}}, screened by destroyers ''Alpino'', ''Bersagliere'', ''Fuciliere'', and ''Granatiere'' of the 13th Flotilla. The fleet also included most of the Italian heavy cruiser force: {{Ship|Italian cruiser|Zara||2}}, {{Ship|Italian cruiser|Fiume||2}}, and {{Ship|Italian cruiser|Pola||2}}, accompanied by four destroyers (''[[Oriani class destroyer#Ships|Alfredo Oriani]]'', {{Ship|Italian destroyer|Giosué Carducci||2}}, ''Vincenzo Gioberti'', and {{Ship|Italian destroyer|Vittorio Alfieri||2}}) of the 9th Flotilla; and ''[[Italian cruiser Trieste|Trieste]]'', ''[[Italian cruiser Trento|Trento]]'', and ''[[Italian cruiser Bolzano|Bolzano]]'', accompanied by three destroyers (''Ascari'', ''Corazziere'', and ''Carabiniere'') of the 12th Flotilla. Joining them were the light cruisers {{Ship|Italian cruiser|Duca degli Abruzzi||2}} and {{Ship|Italian cruiser|Giuseppe Garibaldi|1936|2}} (8th division) and two destroyers of the 16th Flotilla (''Emanuele Pessagno'' and ''Nicoloso de Recco'') from [[Brindisi]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony M. Scalzo (2001) [http://www.historynet.com/battle-of-cape-matapan-world-war-ii-italian-naval-massacre.htm/2 – Battle of cape Matapan (2)] history.net "Originally published by World War II magazine"&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, none of the Italian ships had radar, unlike several of the Allied ships.&lt;ref name=pola/&gt;

==Battle==
On 27 March, Vice-Admiral Pridham-Wippell—with the cruisers ''Ajax'', ''Gloucester'', ''Orion'' and ''Perth'' and a number of destroyers—sailed from Greek waters for a position south of Crete. Admiral Cunningham with ''Formidable'', ''Warspite'', ''Barham'' and ''Valiant'' left Alexandria on the same day to meet the cruisers.&lt;ref name=spotted/&gt;

The Italian Fleet was spotted by a [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]] [[flying boat]] at 12:00, depriving Iachino of any advantage of surprise. The Italian Admiral also learned that ''Formidable'' was at sea, thanks to the decryption team aboard ''Vittorio Veneto''. Nevertheless, after some discussion, the Italian headquarters decided to go ahead with the operation, to show the Germans their will to fight and confidence in the higher speed of their warships.&lt;ref name=spotted&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, pp. 148–150&lt;/ref&gt;

===Action off Gavdos===
[[Image:Veneto guns at Gaudos.jpg|thumb|The battleship ''Vittorio Veneto'' firing upon the Allied cruisers during the action off Gavdos]]

On 28 March, an [[IMAM Ro.43]] [[floatplane]] launched by ''Vittorio Veneto'' spotted the British cruiser squadron at 06:35. At 07:55, the ''Trento'' group encountered Admiral Pridham-Wippell's cruiser group south of the Greek island of [[Gavdos]]. The British squadron was heading to the south-east. Thinking they were attempting to run from their larger ships, the Italians gave chase, opening fire at 08:12 from {{convert|24000|yd|m|abbr=on}}. The three heavy cruisers fired repeatedly until 08:55, with ''Trieste'' firing 132 armour piercing rounds, ''Trento'' firing 204 armour-piercing and 10 explosive shells and ''Bolzano'' firing another 189 armour piercing shells, but the Italians experienced trouble with their [[rangefinder|rangefinding]] equipment and scored no significant hits.&lt;ref name=GV/&gt; HMS ''Gloucester'' fired three salvos in return. These fell short but did cause the Italians to make a course change.&lt;ref name=GV/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraccaroli, Aldo 2001"&gt;Fraccaroli, Aldo: ''Lo combattimento navale di Gaudo'', Storia militare magazine jan 2001, Albertelli editions, Parma&lt;/ref&gt;

As the distance had not been reduced after an hour of pursuit, the Italian cruisers broke off the chase, turning to the north-west on a course to rejoin ''Vittorio Veneto''. The Allied ships changed course in turn, following the Italian cruisers at extreme range. Iachino let them come on in hopes of luring the British cruisers into the range of ''Vittorio Veneto''{{'}}s guns.&lt;ref name=GV/&gt;

An officer on ''Orion''{{'}}s bridge remarked to a companion, "What's that battleship over there? I thought ours were miles away." The Italians eavesdropped on ''Orion''{{'}}s signal that she had sighted an unknown unit and was going to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, 2009 p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; At 10:55, ''Vittorio Veneto'' joined the Italian cruisers and immediately opened fire on the shadowing Allied cruisers. She fired 94 rounds from a distance of {{convert|25000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, all well aimed but again with an excessive dispersal of her salvos. The Allied cruisers, until then unaware of the presence of a battleship, withdrew, suffering slight damage from {{convert|381|mm|in|abbr=on}} shell splinters.&lt;ref name=GV&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, pp. 150–151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spl&gt;''E fecero tutti il loro dovere:Cause ed effetti'', by Enrico Cernuschi. Rivista Maritima, November 2006 {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lif/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perthone.com/pmat.html Battle of Matapan] from [http://www.perthone.com/pmat.html "A Brief History of the Australian Cruiser HMAS Perth"]&lt;/ref&gt; A series of photographs taken from HMS ''Gloucester'' showing Italian salvos falling amongst Allied warships was published by [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] on 16 June 1941.&lt;ref name=lif&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kkwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=gloucester+matapan&amp;hl=en&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=gloucester%20matapan&amp;f=false "Matapan: British fleet won sea victory over Italians"]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vittorio'' ''Veneto'' fired a total of 94 shells in 29 salvos. Another 11 rounds got jammed in the barrels.&lt;ref&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, pp. 151-152&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--HMS ''Gloucester'' was capable of holding the speed of the formation, despite a fault in the shaft which had previously reduced her speed to only 24 knots; despite this, she was able to make 30–31 knots. Therefore, after 20 minutes of pursuit, ''Veneto'' was dropped back to 26,000 metres (3,000 more than the start) and as the visibility was worsened by smokescreen and bad weather, she ceased to fire at the British ships, it being impossible to observe the fall of shot and with the British being faster than the Italian battleship. Just a few moments later, the Italians saw several biplanes closing. Initially they thought that they were CR.42s but they were British [[torpedo-bomber]]s, escorted by some [[Fairey Fulmar]]s.--&gt;

===Air attacks===
[[Image:Veneto sailing out of the battle area.jpg|thumb|''Vittorio Veneto'' withdraws from the battle area after being torpedoed by RN aircraft.]]
Cunningham's force, which had been attempting to rendezvous with Pridham-Wippell, had launched an attack by [[Fairey Albacore]] [[torpedo bomber]]s from HMS ''Formidable'' at 09:38. They attacked ''Vittorio Veneto'' without direct effect, but the required manoeuvring made it difficult for the Italian ships to maintain their pursuit. The Italian ships fired 152, 100 and 90&amp;nbsp;mm guns and also 37, 20 and 13.2&amp;nbsp;mm guns when at close range, repelling the attack, while one of the two [[Junkers Ju 88]]s escorting the Italian fleet was shot down by a [[Fairey Fulmar]].&lt;ref name="Fraccaroli, Aldo 2001"/&gt; Iachino broke off the pursuit at 12:20, retiring towards his own air cover at [[Taranto]].&lt;ref&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, pp. 152–153&lt;/ref&gt;

A second aerial attack at 15:09 surprised the Italians; Lieutenant-Commander Dalyell-Stead was able to fly his Albacore to within {{convert|1094|yd|m}} of ''Vittorio Veneto'' before releasing a torpedo which hit her outer port propeller and caused {{convert|4000|LT|t|lk=on}} of flooding. Dalyell-Stead and his crew were killed when their aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft fire from the battleship. The ship stopped while the damage was repaired, but she was able to get under way again at 16:42, making {{convert|19|kn|lk=on}}. Cunningham heard of the damage to ''Vittorio Veneto'', and started a pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bolzano under air torpedo attack.jpg|thumb|[[Italian cruiser Bolzano|''Bolzano'']] under torpedo attack by Fairey Swordfish]]

A third attack by six Albacores and two [[Fairey Swordfish]] of [[826 NAS|826]] and [[828 NAS|828]] Naval Air Squadrons from ''Formidable'' and two Swordfish of [[815 NAS|815]] squadron from Crete took place between 19:36 and 19:50. Admiral Iachino deployed his ships in three columns and used smoke, searchlights, and a heavy barrage to protect the ''Vittorio Veneto''. The tactics prevented further damage to the battleship, but one torpedo hit the ''Pola'', which had nearly stopped to avoid running into the ''Fiume'' and could not take any evasive action. This blow knocked out five boilers and the main steam line, causing ''Pola'' to lose electric power and drift to a stop.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, 2009 p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The torpedo was apparently dropped by Lieutenant  [[Michael Torrens-Spence|F.M.A. Torrens-Spence]].

Unaware of Cunningham's pursuit, a squadron of cruisers and destroyers was ordered to return and help ''Pola''. This squadron included ''Pola''{{'}}s [[sister ship]]s, ''Zara'' and ''Fiume''. The squadron did not start to return towards ''Pola'' until about an hour after the order had been given by Iachino, officially due to communication problems, while ''Vittorio Veneto'' and the other ships continued to Taranto.&lt;ref&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, pp. 152–156&lt;/ref&gt;

===Night action===
At 20:15, ''Orion''{{'}}s radar picked up a ship six miles to port, apparently dead in the water; she was the crippled ''Pola''. The bulk of the Allied forces detected the Italian squadron on radar shortly after 22:00, and were able to close without being detected. The Italian ships had no radar and could not detect British ships by means other than sight; Italian thinking did not envisage night actions and their main gun batteries were not prepared for action. At 22:20 they spotted the Allied squadron, but thought them to be Italian ships. The battleships ''Barham'', ''Valiant'', and ''Warspite'' were able to close to {{convert|3800|yd|m|-2}} – point blank range for battleship guns – at which point they opened fire. The Allied searchlights (including those aboard ''Valiant'', under the command of a young [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]]&lt;ref&gt;Philip: How I Sunk Italian Cruisers, by Tom Sykes, The Daily Beast, The Royalist, 24 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;) illuminated their enemy. Some British gunners witnessed cruiser main turrets flying dozens of metres into the air. After just three minutes, ''Fiume'' and ''Zara'' had been destroyed. ''Fiume'' sank at 23:30, while ''Zara'' was finished off by a torpedo from the destroyer HMS ''Jervis'' at 02:40 of 29 March.&lt;ref&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Italian destroyers, {{ship|Italian destroyer|Vittorio Alfieri||2}} and {{ship|Italian destroyer|Giosué Carducci||2}}, were sunk in the first five minutes. The other two, ''Gioberti'' and ''Oriani'', managed to escape in a [[smoke screen]], the former with heavy damage, after being chased and fired at by the British destroyers ''[[HMS Griffin (H31)|Griffin]]'' and ''[[HMS Greyhound (H05)|Greyhound]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conlapelleappesaaunchiodo.blogspot.com/search|title=Vincenzo Gioberti|last=Colombo|first=Lorenzo|date=2017-03-13|website=Con la pelle appesa a un chiodo|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sea Battles in Close-Up: World War 2|last=Stephen|first=Martin|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1988|isbn=0-87021-556-6|location=Annapolis, MD|pages=65-67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towing ''Pola'' to Alexandria as a prize was considered, but daylight was approaching, and it was thought that the danger of enemy air attack was too high.&lt;ref name=pola&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, pp. 157–159&lt;/ref&gt; British boarding parties seized a number of much-needed [[Breda Model 35|Breda]] anti-aircraft machine guns.&lt;ref&gt;Pack, S. W. C. (1961). ''The Battle of Matapan''. British Battles Series. MacMillan, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pola''{{'}}s crew was taken off and she was sunk by torpedoes from the destroyers ''Jervis'' and ''Nubian'' shortly after 04:00. The only known Italian reaction after the shocking surprise was a fruitless torpedo charge by ''Oriani'' and ''Gioberti'' and the aimless fire of one of ''Zara''{{'}}s 40&amp;nbsp;mm guns in the direction of the British warships.&lt;ref name=pola/&gt;

The Allied ships took on survivors but left the scene in the morning, fearing Axis air strikes. Admiral Cunningham ordered a signal to be made on the Merchant Marine emergency band. This signal was received by the Italian High Command. It informed them that, due to the risk of air strikes, the Allied ships had ceased their rescue operations and granted safe passage to a hospital ship for rescue purposes. The location of the remaining survivors was broadcast, and the Italian hospital ship ''Gradisca'' came to recover them.&lt;ref name=pola/&gt; Allied casualties during the battle were a single torpedo bomber shot down by ''Vittorio Veneto''{{'}}s 90&amp;nbsp;mm (3.5-inch) anti-aircraft batteries, with the loss of the three-man crew. Italian losses were up to 2,303 sailors, most of them from ''Zara'' and ''Fiume''. The Allies rescued 1,015 survivors, while the Italians saved another 160.&lt;ref name=pola/&gt;

==Aftermath==
===Balance of naval power===
Matapan was Italy's greatest defeat at sea, subtracting from its order of battle a cruiser division. The British in the Mediterranean lost the heavy cruiser {{HMS|York|90|2}} and the new light cruiser ''Bonaventure'' in the same period (26–31 March 1941), but while the Royal Navy lost four heavy cruisers during the war (''York'', ''Exeter'', ''Cornwall'' and ''Dorsetshire''), at Matapan the Regia Marina lost three in a night. That the Italians had sortied so far to the east established a potential threat that forced the British to keep their battleships ready to face another sortie during the operations off Greece and Crete.&lt;ref name="O'Hara, 2009 p. 98"&gt;O'Hara, 2009 p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat at Cape Matapan, the Italian Admiral Iachino wrote that the battle had

{{Quote|... the consequence of limiting for some time our operational activities, not for the serious moral effect of the losses, as the British believed, but because the operation revealed our inferiority in effective aero-naval cooperation and the backwardness of our night battle technology.|Iachino&lt;ref name="O'Hara, 2009 p. 98"/&gt;}}

The Italian fleet did not venture into the Eastern Mediterranean again until the [[Battle of Crete|fall of Crete]] two months later. Despite his impressive victory, Admiral Cunningham was somewhat disappointed with the failure of the destroyers to make contact with ''Vittorio Veneto''. The escape of the Italian battleship was, in the words of the British Admiral, "much to be regretted".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, David (2002). ''The Royal Navy and the Mediterranean: November 1940 – December 1941''. Routledge, p. 76. {{ISBN|0-7146-5205-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bletchley Park (GC&amp;CS)===
For reasons of secrecy, code breakers at the GC&amp;CS were rarely informed of the operational effects of their work, but their impact on the Battle of Cape Matapan was an exception. A few weeks after the end of the battle, Admiral Cunningham dropped into [[Bletchley Park]] to congratulate '[[Dilwyn Knox|Dilly]] and his girls, with a positive impact on morale:&lt;ref name="Batey 2011 79–92"/&gt; [[Mavis Batey|Mavis Batey (née Lever)]], one of the code breakers remembers: "Our sense of elation knew no bounds when Cunningham came down in person to congratulate us".&lt;ref name="Batey 2011 79–92"/&gt; [[John Henry Godfrey|Admiral John Godfrey]], the [[Naval Intelligence Division (UK)|Director of Naval Intelligence]], stated: "Tell Dilly that we have won a great victory in the Mediterranean and it is entirely due to him and his girls".&lt;ref name="Batey 2011 79–92"/&gt;

===Post war===
There is still controversy in Italy regarding the orders given by the Italian Admiral Angelo Iachino to the ''Zara'' division to recover the ''Pola'', when it was clear that an enemy battleship force was steaming from the opposite direction.&lt;ref name=pola/&gt;

{{Rquote|right| When Cunningham won at Matapan

By the grace of God and Dilly

He was the brains behind them all

And should ne'er be forgotten. Will he?|[[William Clarke (cryptographer)|'Nobby' Clarke]], codebreaker &lt;ref name="Batey 2011 79–92"/&gt;}}

For decades after the end of the [[Second World War]], the involvement of the GC&amp;CS, as well as the code breaking methods used, were kept secret. A number of controversial theories were published before more complete accounts emerged after records were declassified in 1978. Only later, after [[Dilly's rodding method]] was demonstrated by Mavis Batey to the Admiral in charge of naval history, were Italian official records corrected.&lt;ref name="Batey 2011 79–92"/&gt; In 1966, [[H. Montgomery Hyde]] published a story alleging that a spy ([[codename]] [[Amy Elizabeth Thorpe|Cynthia]]) seduced [[Alberto Lais|Admiral Alberto Lais]] (the Italian [[naval attaché]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]) and that she obtained a [[codebook]] used by the British to defeat the Italians at Matapan. Hyde was found guilty of libelling the dead, but evidence of GC&amp;CS involvement was not made public at that time.&lt;ref name="Batey 2011 79–92"/&gt; In 1980, the [[BBC]] series ''Spy!'' included similar allegations about a spy called 'Cynthia' who obtained a codebook.&lt;ref name="Batey 2011 79–92"/&gt; In 1974, [[Frederick Winterbotham]] in ''The Ultra Secret'' falsely credited the decryption of ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] traffic.&lt;ref name="Batey 2011 79–92"/&gt;

'''''Billy Boy''''' is a 1954 animated short cartoon released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], produced by [[Fred Quimby]], and directed by [[Tex Avery]]. It is a spin-off of Avery's previous creation, [[Droopy]], and stars his unnamed Southern-accented wolf, who previously appeared opposite Droopy in ''The Three Little Pups'' and in ''Blackboard Jumble'' and ''Sheepwrecked.'' He would later serve as a basis for the character of McWolf, Droopy's archenemy in ''[[Droopy, Master Detective]].''

==Plot==
The Southern-accented Wolf is having breakfast on his farm when there is a knock on his door. A letter is pushed under it, which reads:

::Please take care of my little Billy goat. P.S. You will have no trouble feeding him — &lt;u&gt;HE EATS ANYTHING&lt;/u&gt;.

True to the letter's contents, the wolf opens the door and finds a basket with a baby goat, Billy, who walks around inside the wolf's house, eating anything in its path, such as the carpet, part of the sofa, the wallpaper, the calendar, the globe, the curtains, and the wolf's trousers. The wolf, here presented with [[palilalia]], addresses the audience: "''You know? Now there's a pretty hungry little billy goat-goat-goat-goat-goat-goat.''" Oblivious to Billy's limitless hunger, the wolf gives him a bottle of milk, but Billy spills the milk and eats the bottle, the pacifier, the cutlery and crockery (like a sandwich), the coffeepot (along with all the coffee inside it), and the napkin.

Realizing that Billy will be more than a handful to deal with, the wolf tries to tie him in the garden to a hook hammered into the ground, but Billy eats the rope and comically eats the top part of the wolf's shoe when he tries to stop him. The wolf checks his foot and finds all ''ten'' of his toes still there, to his relief. Billy then tries to eat the wolf's spare tire, but is unable to chew the rubber and ends up shaped like the tire as soon as he swallows it whole.

The wolf then tries tying Billy to the windmill, but once again, Billy eats not only the rope, but the entire windmill, leaving the blades spinning at the top even with no support. He then attempts to take him away in a wheelbarrow and release him into the wild, but Billy eats the wheelbarrow ''and'' the wheel. The wolf ties Billy to a kite and releases him into the sky, but Billy eats the kite, the string and starts chewing on the wolf's arm. Unaffected, the wolf merely tells him to stop. He wraps Billy in chains and tries to tie him to a tree on a small island, but Billy proceeds to eat some of the film itself.

Next, the wolf places Billy in the trunk of his car and tries to drive him somewhere, but Billy somehow eats his way through the car and ends up devouring the motor. The wolf then ties Billy to a horse and hits it on the bottom to make it run away and take Billy with it. However, Billy eats the horse's hair, and the angry horse repeats the same tactic with the wolf, whose hair Billy eats as well. The wolf looks irritably at the horse and says "''Copycat''".

As a final attempt to rid himself of Billy for good, the wolf places pepper on a railroad track and has Billy eat the railway, following it all the way to California, which is 2360 miles away. With Billy gone, the wolf tucks himself into bed. That night, Billy returns, eating the other side of the railway and covered in stamps of all the States he crossed eating the railway. The wolf suddenly awakens to see that Billy has eaten his entire house. Feigning joy, the wolf welcomes Billy back but ties him to a rocket, which the wolf sends to the moon. Even this isn't enough to satisfy the little goat, as Billy then eats the [[moon]], taking the moonlight along with it and leaving the Earth in darkness.

The wolf lights a match and says "''Goodnight, y'all-y'all-y'all-y'all''" as the cartoon closes.

The recurring melody played by woodwinds and/or whistled from 2:21 onward is the Civil War tune "[[Kingdom Coming]]" or "The Year of Jubilo".

==History==
{{see also|History of Georgia Tech}}
The first issue was edited by John G. Chapman. It was published for the Georgia School of Technology, as Georgia Institute of Technology was known at the time. It featured sections on the history of the school, the classes, sports, organizations, fraternities, and advertisements. Sections were broken up with poems inserted throughout the book.&lt;ref name="story"&gt;{{cite book | last = Brittain | first = Marion L. | authorlink = Marion L.

'''''Caro diario''''' ({{lang-en|Dear Diary}}) is an [[Italian language]], semi-autobiographical film in the style of a documentary directed by [[Nanni Moretti]] in 1993. Moretti also played the central character.

==Plot==
The film consists of three autobiographical chapters (''capitoli'') of an open diary—that of [[film director]] and [[film producer]] Nanni Moretti.

===Capitolo I: In vespa (On my Vespa)===
The first episode follows the director/protagonist riding a [[Vespa]] through the neighbourhoods of a summery and half-deserted [[Rome]]. Shots of landscape, architecture, and beautiful monuments accompany his thoughts, which range from critiques of [[Hollywood]] [[film|cinema]] (specifically the contemporary movie ''[[Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer]]''), to critiques of banalization of the Italian cinema, to a chance meeting with [[Jennifer Beals]], to [[sociology]] and [[urbanism]]. The episode ends at [[Ostia (town)|Ostia]], close to the place where [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] was killed.

===Capitolo II: Isole (Islands)===
The second episode cuts to Moretti escaping from the frenzy of city life on a journey through the [[Aeolian Islands]]. Travelling by [[ferry]], his first stop is [[Lipari]] where he visits his friend Gerardo ([[Renato Carpentieri]]), a scholar studying [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' who had moved to the island eleven years earlier. He retires to study on the lost island where he can't even receive the television signal. But he is unable to find the tranquillity he desires, due to the number of tourists. So Nanni, accompanied by Gerardo, moves to [[Salina Island]]. The two are welcomed by a couple, friends of Gerardo, who seem incapable of managing the education of an extremely over-indulged child. (Indeed, the entire island seems to be under the rule of children.) Gerardo lets himself be influenced by the boy, who spends hours in front of the television, and discovers [[soap opera]]. Gradually Gerardo becomes entirely dependent upon the genre. Nanni, now even more exasperated, decides to move, still accompanied by Gerardo, to the island of [[Stromboli]], but even this choice proves unfortunate: the two now have to deal with a megalomaniac mayor who wants to involve them in the most odd projects. While visiting the volcano Gerardo becomes still more gripped by the ''soap operas'', to the point of asking American tourists what happens in the episodes of ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', which haven't been broadcast in Italy yet.

Disgruntled by the latest failure Nanni decides to move on the island of [[Alicudi]], the least civilized of all, lacking water and electricity. At last Nanni seems satisfied with the accommodation, but Gerardo is impelled to escape from the island as soon as he realizes he cannot follow his favourite soap opera there.

===Capitolo III: Medici (Doctors)===
The final episode narrates the difficult diagnosis of a disease that affected Moretti in real life and has the symptoms of persistent itching and disturbing insomnia. Nanni goes through a load of doctors and specialists who, between superficiality and false knowledge, suggest the most bizarre diagnoses. His desperation is such that he also tries alternate treatments, like [[Acupuncture]]. After having tried them all, another doctor suggests an X-ray after noticing his developing cough. This X-ray reveals a mass on the lung which after a [[biopsy]] he is diagnosed as suffering from a malignant, but treatable [[lymphatic system]] [[tumour]].
The illness symptoms, which Nanni found in a medical encyclopedia, are those he declared to the "deaf" doctors. The episode concludes with a bitter and sarcastic toast ''alla salute!'' ({{lang-en|To health!}}), accompanied by a glass of water.

==Summary==

The Chief Inspector Armand Gamache book series is written by Louise Penny. Prior to writing full-time, she worked 20 years as a radio journalist and host for CBC Radio in Thunder Bay, Ontario and Winnipeg, Manitoba.&lt;ref name=GMEveryoLoves/&gt; Penny originally began writing a historical novel, but changed to mystery writing after finding trouble finishing. She entered the first book of the series, ''Still Life'', in the "Debut Dagger" competition in the United Kingdom, placing second out of 800 entries.&lt;ref name=QAQuire&gt;{{cite web|title=Louise Penny's second chance|url=http://www.quillandquire.com/authors/louise-penny-s-second-chance/|website=Quill and Quire|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series is based on the character of Chief Inspector Armand Gamache.&lt;ref name=WSJdebutnovels&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Donnell|first1=Lisa|title=Debut novels, nonfiction highlight Clemmons library reading list|url=http://www.journalnow.com/journal_west/news/debut-novels-nonfiction-highlight-clemmons-library-reading-list/article_546c59e6-251b-11e5-b2a7-d7e0d65ce6ce.html|accessdate=22 July 2015|publisher=Winston-Salem Journal|date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stories take place usually in the village of Three Pines, with Gamache investigating the murders of various people in each novel. The native French speaker Gamache speaks English with a British accent.  In the first book ''Still Life'', he is said to have learned English while he was an undergraduate at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officiallanguages.gc.ca/en/cyberbulletin_newsletter/2012/may|title=A murder by any other name|work=Beyond Words - Canada's Official Languages Newsletter, May 2012|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, where according to ''A Great Reckoning'' he read for a degree in History.

The books have been described as "character-driven" mysteries that explore the relationships between characters with each book in the series.&lt;ref name=WSJdebutnovels/&gt; Three Pines is a fictional location set in the province of Quebec, with Penny setting up the characters using the history of old Canada to show their personalities and backgrounds.&lt;ref name=HuffPostMysterbeauti/&gt; In the series, a few of the plots are set outside of Three Pines.&lt;ref name=HuffPostMysterbeauti/&gt;

The Chief Inspector Armand Gamache book series contains little or no sex or violence and has been referred to as a kinder and gentler alternative to modern crime fiction.&lt;ref name=Washposttrick&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Patrick|title=Louise Penny's 'A Trick of the Light' A cozy mystery|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/louise-pennys-a-trick-of-the-light-a-cozy-mystery/2011/08/29/gIQADq5I2J_story.html|accessdate=22 July 2015|publisher=The Washington Post|date=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==

There are a total of 13 books in the series, all published by Minotaur Books, an imprint of [[St. Martin's Press]]. The first book was released in 2005, not in the U.S., with the most recent in 2017.

This does not form part of the series and was written as a simple story for adults learning to read English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE HANGMAN - grade 3 level novella|url=http://www.louisepenny.com/literacy.htm|website=Louise Penny|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an intricate old map is found stuffed into the walls of the bistro in Three Pines, it at first seems no more than a curiosity. But the closer the villagers look, the stranger it becomes.

When a mysterious figure appears in Three Pines one cold November day, Armand Gamache and the rest of the villagers are at first curious. Then wary. Through rain and sleet, the figure stands unmoving, staring ahead.
From the moment its shadow falls over the village, Gamache, now Chief Superintendent of the Sûreté du Québec, suspects the creature has deep roots and a dark purpose. Yet he does nothing. What can he do? Only watch and wait. And hope his mounting fears are not realized.
But when the figure vanishes overnight and a body is discovered, it falls to Gamache to discover if a debt has been paid or levied.

Book will be released November 27, 2018. When a peculiar letter arrives inviting Armand Gamache to an abandoned farmhouse, the former head of the Sûreté du Québec discovers that a complete stranger has named him one of the executors of her will. Still on suspension, and frankly curious, Gamache accepts and soon learns that the other two executors are Myrna Landers, the bookseller from Three Pines, and a young builder.

None of them had ever met the elderly woman.

The will is so odd and includes bequests that are so wildly unlikely that Gamache and the others suspect the woman must have been delusional. But what if, Gamache begins to ask himself, she was perfectly sane?

When a body is found, the terms of the bizarre will suddenly seem less peculiar and far more menacing.

But it isn't the only menace Gamache is facing.

The investigation into what happened six months ago—the events that led to his suspension—has dragged on, into the dead of winter. And while most of the opioids he allowed to slip though his hands, in order to bring down the cartels, have been retrieved, there is one devastating exception.

Enough narcotic to kill thousands has disappeared into inner city Montreal. With the deadly drug about to hit the streets, Gamache races for answers.

As he uses increasingly audacious, even desperate, measures to retrieve the drug, Armand Gamache begins to see his own blind spots. And the terrible things hiding there.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamacheseries.com/kingdom-of-the-blind/&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|GI-CE}}Windows Embedded Compact===
[[Windows Embedded Compact]] (Windows CE) is a variation of Microsoft's Windows operating system for minimalistic computers and embedded systems. Windows CE is a distinctly different kernel, rather than a trimmed-down version of desktop Windows. It is supported on Intel x86 and compatibles, MIPS, ARM, and Hitachi SuperH processors.

It is possible to install the [[MS-DOS]] variants 7.0 and 7.1 without the graphics user interface of Windows. If an independent installation of both, DOS and Windows is desired, DOS ought to be installed prior to Windows, at the start of a small partition. The system must be transferred by the (dangerous) "SYSTEM" DOS-command, while the other files constituting DOS can simply be copied (the files located in the DOS-root and the entire COMMAND directory). Such a stand-alone installation of MS-DOS 8 is not possible, as it's designed to work as real mode for Windows Me and nothing else.

==Supported file systems==
Various versions of Windows support various [[file systems]], including: [[FAT12]], [[FAT16]], [[FAT32]], [[High Performance File System|HPFS]], or [[NTFS]], along with [[distributed file system|network file system]]s shared from other computers, and the [[ISO 9660]] and [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] file systems used for [[CD]]s, [[DVD]]s, and other optical discs such as [[Blu-ray]]. Each file system is usually limited in application to certain media, for example CDs must use ISO 9660 or UDF, and as of [[Windows Vista]], NTFS is the only file system which the operating system can be installed on. [[Windows Embedded CE 6.0]], Windows Vista Service Pack 1, and [[Windows Server 2008]] onwards support [[exFAT]], a file system more suitable for [[USB flash drive]]s.

==Hardware requirements==
Installing Windows requires an internal or external optical drive.  A [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] are the recommended input devices, though some versions support a [[touchscreen]]. For operating systems prior to Vista, the drive must be capable of reading CD media, while in Windows Vista onwards, the drive must be DVD-compatible.  The drive may be detached after installing Windows.

The '''''Control of Communicable Diseases Manual''''' (CCDM) is one of the most widely recognized reference volumes on the topic of [[infectious disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benjamin|first1=Georges C|title=Foreword. Control of Infectious Diseases Manual|date=2015|publisher=Unbound Medicine|location=Charlottesville, Virginia|edition=Unbound mobile platform|url=http://www.unboundmedicine.com/ccdm|accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is useful for physicians, epidemiologists, global travelers, emergency volunteers and all who have dealt with or might have to deal with [[public health]] issues.

The title of the book, as registered in the [[Library of Congress]], is ''Control of Communicable Diseases Manual 20th edition, An Official Report of the American Public Health Association.'' The editor of CCDM is [[David L. Heymann]], MD.
[[File:1917Edition1.ControlofCommunicableDisease.png|thumb|First edition (1917).]]

==History==
The first edition, published in 1917 by the [[US Public Health Service]], titled '''''Control of Communicable Diseases'''''. The first edition was a 30-page booklet with 38 diseases (Public Health Reports 32:41:1706-1733), adopted from a pamphlet written by Dr. Francis Curtis, health officer for Newton, Massachusetts, and sold for 5¢.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malloy|first1=CD|last2=Marr|first2=JS|title=Evolution of the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual: 1917 to 2000.|journal=Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP|date=September 2001|volume=7|issue=5|pages=97–104|pmid=11680036|doi=10.1097/00124784-200107050-00013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes over the years reflect the new discoveries of infectious agents over the past century. The second edition in 1926 included 42 diseases, but only two [[arthropod]] (usually mosquito) - borne diseases, yellow and dengue fever and one protozoan disease, malaria.  The causative organism of smallpox, dengue and chickenpox was listed as 'unknown.' The third edition in 1932 included two new arthropod infestations and a new disease, coccidioidal granuloma, with a note that it was 100% fatal. Eight diseases were listed as [[Notifiable disease|"reportable"]]: diphtheria, epidemic influenza, measles, meningococcal meningitis, polio, scarlet fever, smallpox, and typhoid fever. The fourth edition in 1935 included 13 new infections. The fifth edition erroneously listed [[pemphigus]] as being infectious. In the sixth edition the [[rickettsioses]] were reorganized. In the seventh edition (1950) [[leprosy]] became Hansen's disease and cat-scratch disease was added as a probable viral disease (now known to be caused by the bacterium, [[Bartonella henselae]]. The eight edition (1955) erroneously listed [[actinomycosis]] as a fungal disease. In the ninth edition, arthropod-borne viral diseases were reclassified, with 49 additional diseases, resulting in substantially more viral entries. By the twelfth edition (1975) there were 118 arboviral illnesses. The 16th edition included "neoplastic, malignant viral-associated diseases" for the first time. In 2004 (18th edition) there were six "tick-borne" diseases, which was later corrected to include a "mite-borne" disease, [[rickettsialpox]]. The title was changed to "Control of Communicable Disease Manual" in 1995 (16th edition) to remove any perception of gender bias.

For a long time the paperback edition was a handy pocket book, the 17th edition still fitting in one hand or a pocket . Now, the softcover version can only fit in the largest pocket of a spacious winter coat. However, the entire contents are now available as an app for  [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and in PDF format.

The paperback is 729 pages with dimensions of 1.5 x 4.2 x 7 inches.  The ISBN is 978-0-87553-018-5.

===Latest edition===

The [[American Public Health Association]] published the 20th edition of the ''CCDM'' in 2014 under the editorship of [[David L. Heymann]], MD. International infectious disease and public health experts, at both the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the [[World Health Organization]], have updated this version.

The 20th edition includes two new chapters on [[Noma (disease)|noma]] and animal/human communicable diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Control of Communicable Diseases Manual|url=http://www.apha.org/ccdm|publisher=American Public Health Association|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; New arboviral agents were added ([[Banna virus|Banna]], [[Cache Valley virus|Cache Valley]], [[Orthobunyavirus|Iquitos]], and the [[Alphavirus|Me Tri virus]], but the number of arboviruses and other pathogens also contracted, apparently to make the manual less encyclopedic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marr|first1=JS|last2=Cathey|first2=JT|title=A Century in the Life of the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual: 1917 to 2017.|journal=Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP|date=NaN|volume=22|issue=6|pages=597–602|pmid=27682728|doi=10.1097/phh.0000000000000435}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous edition had eleven new chapters on topics fundamental to a global public health landscape. Chapter topics include: risk management, public health security in a globalized world, international health regulations, reporting of communicable diseases, outbreak response in bioterrorism, communicable disease control in humanitarian emergencies and handling of infectious materials. Other new chapters offer guidance on disease control at mass gatherings, after natural disasters or in emergency situations.

==Content==

''The Control of Communicable Diseases Manual'' (''CCDM'') compiles comprehensive scientific data about communicable diseases, which significantly contribute to mortality and morbidity around the world. The ''CCDM'' emphasizes the epidemiological aspects of communicable diseases and provides information about their identification, reporting, control and prevention.

===Disease Descriptions===

The ''CCDM'' lists diseases in alphabetical order and includes information on each disease using the following 12 sections:

# Clinical Features
# Causative agent(s)
# Diagnosis
# Occurrence
# Reservoir(s)
# Incubation period
# Transmission
# Risk groups
# Prevention
# Management of patient
# Management of contacts and the immediate environment
# Special considerations

The size of each section varies considerably.  For instance, the occurrence section for [[smallpox]] is less than a line long, since this disease is officially present only in the freezers of laboratories at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] in the United States and the [[State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR|Vector Institute]] in Russia.

==Availability==

The book has been published in a number of languages, including  Arabic, Catalan, French, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, and Thai, a testament to its global audience.

The ''CCDM'' is available as an online PDF version and as apps for iOS and Android for $50.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2481">'''''Coutts v Jacobs'''''&lt;ref&gt;1927 EDL 120.&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South African contract law]], with especial resonance for trade usage in the area of implied terms.

== Facts ==
Coutts sent [[wool]] for sale to Jacobs, [[broker]]s of [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]] in the [[Eastern Cape]], with the request that they should "do the best for me." Jacobs sold odd bales, but eventually Coutts caused the remainder of the wool to be removed from Jacobs and handed to other brokers for sale, paying a sum claimed by Jacobs as brokerage on the unsold portion subject to Coutts's right to recover same. Jacobs claimed the brokerage in virtue of a custom or trade usage, whereby, if wool is removed from one broker to another by the owner, the first broker is entitled to a charge on the transfer equal to the amount of commission which would be earned on the price offered or reserved. It was shown that the custom had been observed in East London and other ports for many years, but that recently one broker had not made the charge for eighteen months. It was not shown, however, that plaintiff knew of the custom.

== Judgment ==
The court held, on appeal, that the [[law of South Africa]] is not less favourable to a person relying upon a trade usage than the [[law of England]], there being no difference between the two systems on this point. The custom or trade usage in question was found to be certain and reasonable. In the circumstances, in sending his wool to be disposed of by Jacobs, Coutts must be taken to have bound himself to have entrusted the wool to be dealt with by Jacobs in accordance with the usage of brokers in East London. The court held, furthermore, that the fact that one broker in East London had not observed the custom did not destroy the custom's validity.

== Overview ==

The product offers three primary types of views — phone book views, calendar views, and notepad views.  Central to the program's design is an [[outline (summary)|outlining]] structure and the ability to easily manipulate [[information]] regardless of in which view it was entered.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  Multiple notepad, calendar, and phonebook views can be opened, and each item seen in each view can be a collapsible outline,  with each line assignable to folders/categories which can themselves be their own views, text field, pulldown menu, calendar date (including repeating date), or phonebook entry.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

ECCO version 2.0, released in 1994, added support for workgroups, including group scheduling via email systems compliant with [[Messaging Application Programming Interface|MAPI]] or [[Vendor Independent Messaging|VIM]] protocols, and [[Microsoft Schedule Plus]], and sharing of contacts, calendars, and outlines, as well as file synchronization and reconciliation via [[intranet]] connections or email.&lt;ref name="pc_1994-06-14"&gt;

"So what happened to the paragon of a program? The market killed it. First it was sold to a much larger company, Netmanage; presumably doing this made the original programmers a lot of money. Then Netmanage panicked when Microsoft Outlook came along as a "free" part of the Office suite, and killed development on the program."&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt; NetManage chief executive officer Zvi Alon noted that 'As soon as Microsoft decided to give away Outlook with Office, we started getting phone calls questioning the value of Ecco Pro'.&lt;ref name="PCAZ"&gt;{{cite news

Even though the source code for Ecco Pro is not open source, development of plugin extensions to the software continues. According to Scott Rosenberg, a programmer using the handle "slangmgh" developed an extension to Ecco Pro posted to ecco_pro users group on Yahoo which includes fixes and upgrades to the program, and may incorporate the [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] scripting language.&lt;ref name="wordyard1"&gt;

'''Ernest Francisco Fenollosa''' (February 18, 1853 – September 21, 1908) was an [[United States|American]] art historian of [[Japanese art]], professor of [[philosophy]] and [[political economy]] at [[Tokyo Imperial University]]. An important educator during the modernization of [[Japan]] during the [[Meiji Era]], Fenollosa was an enthusiastic [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] who did much to preserve traditional Japanese art.

==Biography==
Fenollosa was the son of Manuel Francisco Ciriaco Fenollosa, a Spanish pianist,&lt;ref&gt;[http://libsysdigi.library.illinois.edu/oca/Books2008-02/epochsofchinesej00feno/epochsofchinesej00feno_djvu.txt  Foreword]&lt;/ref&gt; and Mary Silsbee and attended Hacker Grammar School in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], and the [[Salem High School (Massachusetts)|Salem High School]] before going on to study [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]] at [[Harvard College]], where he graduated in 1874. After a year at the art school of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], during which time he married Elizabeth Goodhue Millett, he traveled to Japan in 1878 at the invitation of American zoologist and Orientalist [[Edward S. Morse]] to teach political economy and philosophy at the [[Imperial University at Tokyo]]. There he studied ancient temples, shrines and art treasures with his assistant, [[Okakura Kakuzō]].

During his time in Japan, Fenollosa helped create the ''[[nihonga]]'' (Japanese) style of painting with Japanese artists [[Kanō Hōgai]] (1828–1888) and [[Hashimoto Gahō]] (1835–1908). In May 1882 he delivered a lecture on "An Explanation of the Truth of Art", which was widely circulated and quoted.&lt;ref&gt;Marra, Michael F. (2002). {{google books|VCcLEBldTagC|''Japanese hermeneutics,'' pp. 97–98.|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After eight years at the University, he helped found the [[Tokyo University of the Arts|Tokyo School of Fine Arts]] and the [[Tokyo National Museum|Tokyo Imperial Museum]], and subsequently acted as its director in 1888.  In this period, he helped to draft the text of a law for the preservation of temples and shrines and their art treasures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/204302/Ernest-F-Fenollosa  "Ernest F. Fenollosa" in ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fenollosa converted to [[Buddhism]] and was given the name Teishin. He was also granted the name Kano Eitan Masanobu, placing him in the lineage of the [[Kanō school]], who had served as painters to the Tokugawa shoguns. While resident in Japan, Fenollosa's accomplishments included the first inventory of [[National Treasure of Japan|Japan's national treasures]], leading to the discovery of ancient Chinese scrolls brought to Japan by traveling monks centuries earlier, and rescuing many Buddhist artifacts which would otherwise have been destroyed under the [[Haibutsu kishaku]] movement. For these achievements, the [[Emperor Meiji]] of Japan decorated him with the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] and the [[Order of the Sacred Treasures]].

Fenollosa was able to amass a large collection of Japanese art during his stay in Japan. In 1886, he sold his art collection to Boston physician [[Charles Goddard Weld]] (1857–1911) on the condition that it go to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and in 1890 he returned to Boston to serve as curator of the department of Oriental Art. There Fenollosa was asked to choose Japanese art for display at the 1893 [[World Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]]. He also organized Boston's first exhibition of [[Chinese painting]] in 1894. In 1896, he published ''Masters of Ukiyoe'', a historical account of Japanese paintings and [[ukiyo-e]] prints exhibited at the New York Fine Arts Building. However, his public divorce and immediate remarriage in 1895 to the writer [[Mary McNeill Scott]] (1865–1954) outraged Boston society, leading to his dismissal from the Museum in 1896.

He returned to Japan in 1897 to accept a position as Professor of [[English Literature]] at the [[Tokyo Higher Normal School]] at Tokyo.  [[Lafcadio Hearn]] considered Fenollosa a friend; and Hearn almost believed that he visited the professor's home too often.&lt;ref&gt;Bisland, pp. 412–414.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, he returned to the United States to write and lecture on Asia. His 1912 work in two volumes concentrates on art before 1800 but offers [[Hokusai]]'s prints as a window of beauty after Japanese art had become too modern for Fenollosa's taste: "Hokusai is a great designer, as [[Kipling]] and [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]] are great poets. He has been called the [[Dickens]] of Japan." [[Arthur Wesley Dow]] said of Fenollosa 'he was gifted with a brilliant mind of great analytical power, this with a rare appreciation gave him an insight into the nature of fine art such as few ever attain'&lt;ref&gt;Dow, Arthur Wesley, ''Composition: A Series of Exercises in Art Structure for the Use of Students and Teachers'', Boston Double day Page 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death in London in 1908, Fenollosa's unpublished notes on [[Chinese poetry]] and Japanese [[Noh]] drama were confided by his widow to noted poet [[Ezra Pound]] who, with [[William Butler Yeats]], used them to solidify the growing interest in Far Eastern literature among modernist writers. Pound subsequently finished Fenollosa's work with the aid of [[Arthur Waley]], the noted British [[sinologist]].&lt;ref&gt;"Fenollosa, Pound and the Chinese Character", ''Yale Literary Magazine'' 126.5  (1958): 24–36. Reprinted: ''Pinyin.info'' (2010)  [http://pinyin.info/readings/texts/ezra_pound_chinese.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fenollosa's body was cremated in London, and his ashes returned to the Hōmyō-in chapel of [[Mii-dera]] high above Lake Biwa, (where he had been tonsured) for burial. His tombstone was paid for by the Tokyo School of Fine Arts.&lt;ref&gt;"Asleep Under the Maples at Homyo-in", ''[[The Detroit Free Press]]'', 30 January 1910, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
At a Harvard lecture of 2011, [[Benjamin Elman]] refers to the ''Epochs of the Chinese and Japanese Art'' (1912) where Fenollosa compares "degeneration" of the late imperial Chinese art to that which befell the high antique art of Europe in Byzantium ("the poorest of the Byzantine mosaics"; "the only hope for the hopeless is to perceive itself to be hopeless"). According to Elman, Fenollosa's perception was influenced by the political and military defeats of the Qing empire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.clip4play.com/?w=Pn4rI6JqSI4&amp;title=the-great-reversal-the-rise-of-japan-and-the-fall-of-china-after-1895-as-historical-fables Reischauer Lectures, Harvard University 2011] 00:52 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commissioner |vol=762 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=264 |pinpoint= |court=2d Cir. |date=1985 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/762/264/406661/ |accessdate=2017-11-27 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a case in which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] held that [[Internal Revenue Code section 162(a)|section 162(a)]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] only allows deductions against income for expenses that occur while carrying on a trade or business.

==Facts of the case==
[[Nelson Rockefeller]] had incurred $550,159.78 worth of legal fees and services with regard to his 1974 vice presidential confirmation hearings. Mr. Rockefeller then claimed a $63,275 deduction on his 1974 [[Tax return (United States)|income tax return]], which was the amount of his salary as vice-president.

==Determination of the court==
The 2nd Circuit affirmed the Tax Courts ruling that the deductions were not allowed under IRC section 162.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|162}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court essentially compared Rockefeller’s past job as [[List of Governors of New York|Governor of New York]] with his position as [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] and found that the two positions did not constitute the same trade or business. Mr. Rockefeller’s estate argued that his trade or business was that of public service, but there was no authority that supported such a broad interpretation. Thus, the legal and consulting fees were not incurred in carrying out a trade or business, but in anticipation of doing so. Essentially, the court ruled that the expenses could not be deducted because Rockefeller was not yet “carrying on” the business of being Vice President.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="132531">{{Book of Mormon}}
According to [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saint]] belief, the '''golden plates''' (also called the '''gold plates''' or in some 19th-century literature, the '''golden bible''')&lt;ref&gt;Use of the terms ''golden bible'' and ''gold bible'' by both believers and non-believers dates from the late 1820s. See {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=167}} (use of the term ''gold bible'' by [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] in 1827); {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=102, 109, 113, 145}} (use of the term ''gold Bible'' in 1827–29 by believing Palmyra neighbors); {{Harvtxt|Grandin|1829}} (stating that by 1829 the plates were "generally known and spoken of as the 'Golden Bible'"). Use of those terms has been rare since the 1830s.&lt;/ref&gt; are the source from which [[Joseph Smith]] claimed to have translated the [[Book of Mormon]], a sacred text of the faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/mopi/learn/historyculture/index.htm|title=History &amp; Culture - Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some witnesses described the plates as weighing from {{convert|30|to|60|lb|kg}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|p=600n65; 601n96}}. Vogel estimates that solid gold plates of the same dimensions would weigh about {{convert|140|lb|kg}}.&lt;/ref&gt; golden in color, and composed of thin metallic pages engraved on both sides and bound with three D-shaped rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith said that he found the plates on September 22, 1823 on [[Cumorah|a hill]], near his home in [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester, New York]], after the [[angel Moroni]] directed him to a buried stone box. He said that the angel prevented him from taking the plates but instructed him to return to the same location in a year. He returned to that site every year, but it was not until September 1827 that he recovered the plates on his fourth annual attempt to retrieve them. He returned home with a heavy object wrapped in a frock, which he then put in a box. He allowed others to heft the box but said that the angel had forbidden him to show the plates to anyone until they had been translated from their original "[[reformed Egyptian]]" language. Smith dictated the text of the [[Book of Mormon]] over the next several years, claiming that it was a translation of the plates. He did so by using a [[seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seer stone]] which he placed in the bottom of a hat and then placed the hat over his face to view the words written within the stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=71–72}}; {{Harvtxt|Marquardt|Walters|1994|pp=103–04}}; {{Harvtxt|Van Wagoner|Walker|1982|pp=52–53}} (citing numerous witnesses of the translation process); {{Harvtxt|Quinn|1998|pp=169–70, 173}} (describing similar methods for both the two-stone Urim and Thummim and the chocolate-colored seer stone). Smith's use of a single stone is well documented {{Harv|Wagoner|1982|pp=59–62}}, although Smith said that his earliest translation used a set of stone spectacles called the Urim and Thummim which he found with the plates {{Harv|Smith|Mulholland|Thompson|Phelps|1838a|p=5}}. Smith's mother [[Lucy Mack Smith]] was the only known witness of the Urim and Thummim, which she said she had observed when covered by a thin cloth {{harv|Smith|1853|p=101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith published the translation in 1830 as the [[Book of Mormon]].

Smith eventually obtained testimonies from 11 men who said that they had seen the plates, known as the [[Book of Mormon witnesses]].&lt;ref&gt;Critics question whether [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] physically saw the plates. Harris continued to testify to the truth of the [[Book of Mormon]] even when he was estranged from the church, at least during the early years of the movement. He "seems to have repeatedly admitted the internal, subjective nature of his visionary experience." Vogel, ''Early Mormon Documents'', 2: 255. The foreman in the Palmyra printing office that produced the first Book of Mormon said that Harris "used to practice a good deal of his characteristic jargon and 'seeing with the spiritual eye,' and the like." [[Pomeroy Tucker]], ''Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism'' (New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1867) p. 71 in ''EMD'', 3: 122. John H. Gilbert was the typesetter for most of the book, and he said that he had asked Harris, "Martin, did you see those plates with your naked eyes?" Harris "looked down for an instant, raised his eyes up, and said, 'No, I saw them with a spiritual eye.'" John H. Gilbert, "Memorandum," 8 September 1892, in ''EMD'', 2: 548. Two other Palmyra residents said that Harris told them that he had seen the plates with "the eye of faith" or "spiritual eyes." Martin Harris interviews with John A. Clark, 1827 &amp; 1828 in ''EMD'', 2: 270; Jesse Townsend to Phineas Stiles, 24 December 1833, in ''EMD'', 3: 22. In 1838, Harris told an Ohio congregation that "he never saw the plates with his natural eyes, only in vision or imagination." Stephen Burnett to [[Lyman E. Johnson]], 15 April 1838 in ''EMD'', 2: 291. A neighbor of Harris in Kirtland, Ohio said that Harris "never claimed to have seen [the plates] with his natural eyes, only spiritual vision." Reuben P. Harmon statement, c. 1885, in ''EMD'', 2: 385.&lt;/ref&gt; After the translation was complete, Smith said that he returned the plates to the angel Moroni, so they could never be examined. Latter Day Saints believe the account of the golden plates as a matter of faith, and critics often assert that either Smith manufactured them himself&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, 98: "His remark that a plate was not quite as thick as common tin may have been meant to divert attention from the possibility that they were actually made from some material otherwise readily available to him. Indeed, his prohibition against visual inspection seems contrived to the skeptic who might explain that the would-be prophet constructed a set of plates to be felt through a cloth."&lt;/ref&gt; or that the Book of Mormon witnesses based their testimony on visions rather than physical experience.

==Origin and historicity==
{{See also|Origin of the Book of Mormon|Historicity of the Book of Mormon}}

In the words of Mormon historian [[Richard Bushman]], "For most modern readers, the plates are beyond belief, a phantasm, yet the Mormon sources accept them as fact."&lt;ref name="harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=58"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith said that he returned the plates to the [[angel Moroni]] after he finished translating them, and their authenticity cannot be determined by physical examination. They were reportedly shown to [[Book of Mormon witnesses|several close associates]] of Smith.&lt;ref&gt;Only close associates of Smith were allowed to become official witnesses to the plates; he invited no strangers to view them. The first witnesses were a group of three: [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], [[Oliver Cowdery]], and [[David Whitmer]]; then a group of eight: five members of the Whitmer family, Smith's father [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]], and of his brothers [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] and [[Samuel H. Smith (Latter Day Saints)|Samuel]]. They all said that they "saw and hefted" the plates. See Jan Shipps, "Mormonism: The Story of a New Religious Tradition," University of Illinois Press, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Mormon scholars have formed collaborations such as [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] to provide apologetic answers to critical research about the golden plates and topics in the field of Mormon studies. The credibility of the plates has been a "troublesome item", according to Bushman.&lt;ref&gt;"The Mormon sources constantly refer to the single most troublesome item in Joseph Smith's history, the gold plates on which the Book of Mormon was said to be written." {{harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=58}}. Richard N. Ostling and Joan K. Ostling, ''Mormon America: The Power and the Promise (HarperSanFrancisco, 1999)'' begin a chapter called "The Gold Bible" (pp. 259–77) with a question posed by liberal Mormon Brigham D. Madsen: "'Were there really gold plates and ministering angels, or was there just Joseph Smith seated at a table with his face in a hat dictating to a scribe a fictional account of the ancient inhabitants of the Americas?' Resolving that problem haunts loyal Mormons." (at p. 259).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:caractors large.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A reputed transcript of reformed Egyptian characters which Smith said were copied from the golden plates in 1828. The characters are not linked to any known language, although several appear in many alphabets.]]

The Book of Mormon itself portrays the golden plates as a historical record, engraved by two pre-Columbian prophet-historians from around the year AD 400: Mormon and his son Moroni.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvtxt|Metcalfe|1993}}, which outlines the main arguments for and against Book of Mormon authenticity.&lt;/ref&gt; Mormon and Moroni, the book says, had abridged earlier historical records from other sets of metal plates. Their script, according to the book, was described as "reformed Egyptian", a language unknown to linguists or Egyptologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1830|p=538}}. Standard language treatises contain no reference to "reformed Egyptian", including {{Harvtxt|Daniels|Bright|1996}}; {{Harvtxt|Crystal|1997}}; and {{Harvtxt|Woodard|2004}}. "Reformed Egyptian" is also not discussed in {{Harvtxt|Robinson|2002}}, although it is mentioned in {{harvtxt|Williams|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly reference works on languages do not acknowledge the existence of either a "reformed Egyptian" language or "reformed Egyptian" script as it has been described in Mormon belief, and there is no archaeological, linguistic, or other evidence of the use of Egyptian writing in ancient America. Historically, Latter Day Saint movement denominations have taught that the Book of Mormon's description of the plates' origin is accurate, and that the Book of Mormon is a translation of the plates.&lt;ref&gt;Book of Mormon (LDS edition), Introduction expressing the LDS view that the Book of Mormon "is a record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas", and that the book is a translation of the golden plates "into the English language".&lt;/ref&gt; The Community of Christ, however, accepts the Book of Mormon as scripture but no longer takes an official position on the historicity of the golden plates.&lt;ref name=mcmurray&gt;W. Grant McMurray|McMurray, W. Grant, [https://archive.is/20070817021355/http://cofchrist.org/docs/NativeAmericanConference/keynote.asp "They 'Shall Blossom as the Rose': Native Americans and the Dream of Zion,"] an address delivered February 17, 2001, accessed September 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Some adherents accept the Book of Mormon as inspired scripture but do not believe that it is a literal translation of a physical historical record, even in the more theologically conservative Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).&lt;ref&gt;Osling 1999, 264&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-believers and some liberal Mormons have advanced naturalistic explanations for the story of the plates. For example, it has been theorized that the plates were fashioned by Smith or one of his associates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|pp=98, 600 note 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Smith had the ability to convince others of their existence through illusions or hypnosis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Riley|1903|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that witnesses were having ecstatic visions.

==Story==
[[Image:Joseph Smith receiving golden plates.jpg|175px|thumb|An 1893 engraving depicting [[Joseph Smith]]'s description of receiving artifacts from the [[angel Moroni]]. The artifacts include the golden plates and a set of spectacles made of [[seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seer stones]], which Smith called the Urim and Thummim. The [[sword of Laban]] and an ancient breastplate are shown nearby.]]
The story of the golden plates consists of how, according to [[Joseph Smith]] and his contemporaries, the plates were found, received from the [[angel Moroni]], translated, and returned to the angel before the publication of the [[Book of Mormon]]. Smith is the only source for a great deal of the story because much of it occurred while he was the only human witness. Nevertheless, Smith told the story to his family, friends, and acquaintances, and many of them provided second-hand accounts. Other parts of the story are derived from the statements of those who knew Smith, including [[Book of Mormon witnesses|several witnesses]] who said that they saw the golden plates.

The best-known elements of the golden plates story are found in an account told by Smith in 1838 and incorporated into the official church histories of some [[Latter Day Saint movement]] denominations.&lt;!--

===Background===
{{Main|Early life of Joseph Smith}}

During the [[Second Great Awakening]], [[Joseph Smith]] lived on his parents' farm near [[Palmyra (village), New York|Palmyra, New York]]. At the time, churches in the region contended so vigorously for souls that western New York later became known as the "[[burned-over district]]" because the fires of religious revivals had burned over it so often.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Shipps, "Mormonism: The Story of a New Religious Tradition," University of Illinois Press, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Western New York was also noted for its participation in a "craze for treasure hunting".&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bennett|1893}}. The treasure-seeking culture in early-19th-century [[New England]] is described in {{Harvtxt|Quinn|1998|pp=25–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Beginning as a youth in the early 1820s, Smith was periodically hired, for about $14 per month, as a [[scrying|scryer]], using what were termed "[[seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seer stones]]" in attempts to locate lost items and buried treasure.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1838b|pp=42–43}} (stating that he was what he called a "money digger" but that it "was never a very profitable job to him, as he only got fourteen dollars a month for it").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Smith's contemporaries described his method for seeking treasure as putting the stone in a white [[stovepipe hat]], putting his face over the hat to block the light, and then "seeing" the information in the reflections of the stone.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1833|pp=253–54}}; {{Harvtxt|Hale|1834|p=265}}; {{Harvtxt|Clark|1842|p=225}}; {{Harvtxt|Turner|1851|p=216}}; {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=164}}; {{Harvtxt|Tucker|1867|pp=20–21}}; {{Harvtxt|Lapham|1870|p=305}}; {{Harvtxt|Lewis|Lewis|1879|p=1}}; {{Harvtxt|Mather|1880|p=199}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=50–51, 54–55}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
--&gt;

Smith did not consider himself to be a "peeper" or [[crystal gazing|"glass-looker"]], a practice he called "nonsense".&lt;!--FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=50–51}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Rather, Smith and his family viewed their folk magical practices as [[spiritual gift]]s.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=50–51}}. [[Lucy Mack Smith]] later remembered that the family did not abandon its labor "to win the faculty of Abrac, drawing magic circles, or sooth saying to the neglect of all kinds of business. We never during our lives suffered one important interest to swallow up every other obligation but whilst we worked with our hands we endeavored to remember the service of &amp; the welfare of our souls."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Although Smith later rejected his youthful treasure-hunting activities as frivolous and immaterial, he never repudiated the stones themselves,  denied their presumed power to find treasure, or ever relinquish the magic culture in which he was raised.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=50–51}} Smith "never repudiated the stones or denied their power to find treasure. Remnants of the magical culture stayed with him to the end;" Jan Shipps, ''Mormonism: The Story of a New Religious Tradition,'' University of Illinois Press, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; He came to view seeing with a stone in religious terms as the work of a "seer".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's first stone, apparently the same one that he used at least part of the time to translate the golden plates, was chocolate-colored and about the size of a chicken egg,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1930|p=129}}. Roberts was at the time the official historian of the LDS Church.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; found in a deep well he helped dig for one of his neighbors.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=163}}; {{Harvtxt|Lapham|1870|pp=305–06}}. The stone was found in either 1819 ({{Harvnb|Tucker|1867|pp=19–20}} {{Harvnb|Bennett|1893}}) or 1822 {{Harv|Chase|1833|p=240}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church released photographs of the stone on August 4, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mormon-church-to-release-historical-documents-that-shed-light-on-joseph-smith_55c0e22ae4b0c9fdc75dfd79|title=Religion|website=www.huffingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Fielding Smith]] (an [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] of the LDS Church): "The statement has been made that the Urim and Thummim was on the altar in the [[Manti Utah Temple|Manti Temple]] when that building was dedicated. The Urim and Thummim so spoken of, however, was the seer stone which was in the possession of the Prophet Joseph Smith in early days. This seer stone is currently in the possession of the Church." (''Doctrines of Salvation'' 3: 225).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finding the plates===
According to Smith, he found the plates after he was directed to them by a heavenly messenger&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith referred to the visitor as an "angel of the Lord" at least as early as 1832 {{Harv|Smith|1832|p=4}}, and possibly as early as 1829 (''Early Mormon Documents'' 1:151–52). Some early accounts related by non-Mormons described this angel as a "spirit" ({{Harvnb|Hadley|1829}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|1833|p=253}}; {{Harvnb|Chase|1833|p=242}}) or a "ghost" {{Harv|Burnett|1831}}; see also {{Harvtxt|Lewis|Lewis|1879|p=1}} (a later-published account using the "ghost" terminology). In 1838, however, Smith later said that the "angel" was a man who had been "dead, and raised again therefrom" {{Harv|Smith|1838b|pp=42–43}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; whom he later identified as the [[angel Moroni]].&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Cowdery|Rigdon|1835|p=180}}; {{Harvnb|Smith|1838b|pp=42–43}}. In distinction from his other accounts, Smith's 1838 autobiography said that the angel's name was Nephi {{Harv|Smith|1838a|p=4}}; nevertheless, modern historians and Latter Day Saints generally refer to the angel as Moroni.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; According to the story, the angel first visited Smith's bedroom late at night, on September 22&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;September 22 was listed in a local [[almanac]] as the [[autumn equinox|autumnal equinox]], which has led [[D. Michael Quinn]] to argue that the date had astrological significance in Smith's worldview {{Harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=144}}; however, that astrological significance was never mentioned by Smith or his contemporaries.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; in 1822 or 1823.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith's first mention of the angel in later histories is an appearance on the eve of September 22, 1823 {{Harv|Smith|1838a|p=4}}; however, other accounts say or imply that the angel may have appeared a year earlier in 1822. Smith's first history in 1832 said that the angel's first visit was on September 22, 1822, although he also said he was "seventeen years of age" {{Harv|Smith|1832|p=3}}, which would have made the year 1823 (he turned 17 in December 1822). In 1835, after [[Oliver Cowdery]] initially dated the angel's visit to the "15th year of our brother J. Smith Jr.'s, age", Cowdery changed the statement to read the 17th year of his age (16 years old, or 1822)—but he said this visit in Smith's "17th year" occurred in 1823 {{Harv|Cowdery|1835a|p=78}}. Smith's father is quoted by an inquirer, who visited his house in 1830, as saying that the first visit by the angel took place in 1822 but that he did not learn about it until 1823 {{Harv|Lapham|1870|p=305}}. A neighbor who said Smith told him the story in 1823 said the angel appeared "a year or two before" the death of Joseph's brother [[Alvin Smith (brother of Joseph Smith)|Alvin]] in November 1823.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Moroni told Smith that the plates could be found buried in a prominent hill near his home, later called ''[[Cumorah]]'', a name found in the [[Book of Mormon]].&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1838a|p=4}} (identifying the hill but not referring to it by a name); {{Harvtxt|Cowdery|1835b|p=196}} (referring to the hill as ''[[Cumorah]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Before dawn, Moroni reappeared two more times and repeated the information.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1832|p=7}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1842|p=707}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the angel would not allow Smith to take the plates until he obeyed certain "commandments".&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1838a|p=6}} (saying the angel told him to obey his charge concerning the plates; "otherwise I could not get them"); {{Harvtxt|Clark|1842|pp=225–26}} (the angel "told him that he must follow implicitly the divine direction, or he would draw down upon him the wrath of heaven"); {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=83}} (characterizing the angel's requirements as "commandments of God" and saying Smith could receive the plates "not only until he was willing, but able" to keep those commandments).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Smith recorded some of these commandments but made it clear the main thrust of Moroni's message was that he had to keep God's commandments in general. Some contemporaries who later claimed he told them the story said there were others, some of which are relevant to the modern debate about whether or how closely events of early Mormonism were related to the practice of contemporary [[folk magic]].&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{Harvtxt|Quinn|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Smith's writings say that the angel required at least the following: (1) that he have no thought of using the plates for monetary gain,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1832|p=5}} (saying he was commanded to "have an eye single to the glory of God"); {{Harvtxt|Smith|1838a|p=6}} (saying the angel commanded him to "have no other object in view in getting the plates but to glorify God.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; (2) that he tell his father about the vision,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith's mother [[Lucy Mack Smith]] said he was commanded to tell his father during the third vision {{Harv|Smith|1853|p=81}}, but he disobeyed because he thought that his father would not believe him, and the angel appeared a fourth time to rebuke him and reiterate the commandment (p. 82). Joseph Smith and his sister [[Katharine Smith Salisbury|Katharine]] said the angel gave him the commandment in his fourth visit, but they did not say whether he had received the commandment earlier that night ({{Harvnb|Smith|1838a|p=7}}; {{Harvnb|Salisbury|1895|p=12}}). Smith's father is quoted by a skeptical interviewer to say that in 1830, Smith delayed telling his father about the vision for about a year {{Harv|Lapham|1870|p=305}}. Smith's brother [[William Smith (Latter Day Saints)|William]], who was 11 at the time, said the angel commanded him to tell his entire family {{Harv|Smith|1883|p=9}}, but he may have been remembering Smith tell the story that night ''after'' he visited the hill, according to their mother's recollection {{Harv|Smith|1853|p=83}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; and (3) that he never show the plates to any unauthorized person.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hadley|1829}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1838a|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Smith's contemporaries who claimed to have heard the story, both sympathetic and unsympathetic, generally agreed that Smith mentioned the following additional commandments: (4) that Smith take the plates and leave the site in which they had been buried without looking back,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This commandment is described in the account of [[Joseph Knight, Sr.]], a loyal Latter Day Saint friend of Smith {{Harv|Knight|1833|p=2}}, and Willard Chase, an associate of Smith's in Palmyra during the 1820s {{Harv|Chase|1833|p=242}}. Both Knight and Chase were treasure seekers, but while Knight remained a loyal follower until his death, Chase was a critic of Smith by the early 1830s.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; and (5) that the plates never directly touch the ground until they were safe at home in a locked chest.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There is agreement on this commandment by Smith's mother {{Harv|Smith|1853|pp=85–86}} and sister {{Harv|Salisbury|1895|p=14}} and by two non-Mormons ({{Harvnb|Chase|1833|p=242}}; {{Harvnb|Lapham|1870|p=305}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Some unsympathetic listeners who allegedly heard the story from Smith or his father recalled that Smith had said the angel required him (6) to wear "black clothes" to the place where the plates were buried,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Chase|1833|p=242}} (an affidavit of Willard Chase, a non-Mormon treasure seeker who believed Smith wrongly appropriated his seer stone). Chase said he heard the story from Smith's father in 1827. Fayette Lapham, who traveled to Palmyra in 1830 to inquire about the Latter Day Saint movement and heard the story from Joseph Smith, Sr., said Smith was told to wear an "old-fashioned suit of clothes, of the same color as those worn by the angel", but Lapham did not specify what color of clothing the angel was wearing {{Harv|Lapham|1870|p=305}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; (7) to ride a "black horse with a switchtail",&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Chase|1833|p=242}} (affidavit of Willard Chase, relating story heard from Smith's father in 1827). A friendly but non-believing Palmyra neighbor, Lorenzo Saunders, heard the story in 1823 from Joseph Smith and also said that Smith was to required to ride a black horse to the hill {{Harv|Saunders|1884b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; (8) to call for the plates by a certain name,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Chase|1833|p=242}} (affidavit of the skeptical Willard Chase).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; and (9) to "give thanks to God."&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Saunders|1893}} (statement of Orson Saunders of Palmyra, who heard the story from Benjamin Saunders, who heard the story from Joseph Smith).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mormon Hill engraving (1841).gif|right|300px|thumb|An 1841 engraving of "[[Cumorah|Mormon Hill]]" (looking south), where Smith said he found the golden plates on the west side, near the peak.]]

In the morning, Smith began work as usual and did not mention the visions to his father&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1838a|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; because, he said, he did not think his father would believe him.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=82}}; {{Harvtxt|Salisbury|1895|p=12}} (stating that Smith told the angel during the fourth visit that he was afraid his Father would not believe him).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Smith said he then fainted because he had been awake all night, and while unconscious, the angel appeared a fourth time and chastised him for failing to tell the visions to his father.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=82}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1838a|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; When Smith then told all to his father, he believed his son and encouraged him to obey the angel's commands.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=82}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1838a|p=7}}. Smith's brother [[William Smith (Latter Day Saints)|William]], who was 11 at the time, said he also told the rest of his family that day prior to visiting the hill {{Harv|Smith:1883|pp=9–10}}, but he may have been remembering Smith tell the story the night ''after'' he visited the hill, according to their mother's recollection {{Harv|Smith|1853|p=83}}. Smith's sister [[Katharine Smith Salisbury|Katharine]] said that Joseph told his father and the two oldest brothers [[Alvin Smith (brother of Joseph Smith)|Alvin]] and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] the morning before visiting the hill, but Katharine was too young (10 years old) to understand what they were talking about {{Harv|Salisbury|1895|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Smith then set off to visit the hill, later stating that he used his seer stone to locate the place that the plates were buried&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1833|p=252}} (statement by Henry Harris, a non-Mormon Palmyra resident); {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=163}} (statement by [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], a Latter Day Saint who became one of the [[Three Witnesses]] of the golden plates). According to one hearer of the account, Smith used the seer stone to follow a sequence of landmarks by horse and on foot until he arrived at the place that the plates were buried.{{Harvtxt|Lapham|1870|p=305}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; but that he "knew the place the instant that [he] arrived there."&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1838a|pp=6–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith said he saw a large stone covering a box made of stone (or possibly iron).&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Most accounts, including those written by Smith, say the plates were found in a stone box ({{Harvnb|Cowdery|1835b|p=196}}; {{Harvnb|Smith|1838a|pp=15–16}}; {{Harvnb|Whitmer|1875}}, calling it a "stone casket," and stating that Smith had to dig down for the box "two and a half or three feet"); according to two non-believing witnesses, however, Smith said they were buried in an iron box ({{Harvnb|Bennett|1831|p=7}}; {{Harvnb|Lewis|Lewis|1879|p=1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Using a stick to remove dirt from the edges of the stone cover and prying it up with a lever,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Salisbury|1895|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Smith saw the plates inside the box, together with other artifacts.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1838a|pp=15–16}}. According to various accounts, the artifacts may have included a breastplate ({{Harvnb|Cowdery|1835b|p=196}}; {{Harvnb|Smith|1838a|p=16}}; {{Harvnb|Salisbury|1895|p=13}}, saying it was the "breast-plate of Laban"), a set of large spectacles made of seer stones ({{Harvnb|Chase|1833|p=243}}; {{Harvnb|Smith|1838a|p=16}}; {{Harvnb|Salisbury|1895|p=13}}), the [[Liahona (Book of Mormon)|Liahona]], the [[sword of Laban]] ({{Harvnb|Lapham|1870|pp=306, 308}}; {{Harvnb|Salisbury|1895|p=13}}), the [[brass plates]] of Laban {{Harv|Salisbury|1895|p=13}}, the vessel in which the gold was melted, a rolling machine for gold plates, and three balls of gold as large as a fist {{Harv|Harris|1833|p=253}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unsuccessful retrieval attempts===
According to Smith's followers, Smith said he took the plates from the box, put them on the ground, and covered the box with the stone to protect the other treasures that it contained.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=2}} (account by [[Joseph Knight, Sr.]], a loyal lifelong follower who had worked with Smith in treasure expeditions); {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=85}} (account by Smith's mother, saying this occurred on Smith's ''second'' visit to the hill); {{Harvtxt|Salisbury|1895|p=14}} (account of Smith's sister, saying this occurred on Smith's ''third'' visit to the hill but that it happened prior to their brother Alvin's death, which was in November 1823); {{Harvtxt|Cowdery|1835b|p=197}} (account by Smith's second-in-command [[Oliver Cowdery]], stating that when Smith was looking in the box for other artifacts, he had not yet removed the plates).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Nevertheless, the accounts say that when Smith looked back at the ground after closing the box, the plates had once again disappeared into it.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=85}} (account by Smith's mother); {{Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=2}} (account by Smith's lifelong friend Joseph Knight, Sr.); {{Harvtxt|Salisbury|1895|p=14}} (account of Smith's sister).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; When Smith once again raised the stone and attempted to retrieve the plates, he said that he was stricken by a supernatural force that hurled him to the ground as many as three times.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Writing with Smith's assistance for a church periodical, [[Oliver Cowdery]] said that Smith was stricken three times with an ever-increasing force, persisting after the second blow because he thought that the plates were held by the power of an "enchantment" (like hidden-treasure stories he had heard) that could be overcome by physical exertion {{Harv|Cowdery|1835b|pp=197–98}}. Smith's mother said that he was stricken by a force but did not say how many times {{Harv|Smith|1853|p=86}}. Willard Chase, who heard the story from Smith's father in 1827, said that Smith was stricken at least twice by a toad-like creature {{Harv|Chase|1833|p=242}}. Account of Benjamin Saunders, a sympathetic nonbeliever who heard the story from Smith in 1827 {{Harvtxt|Saunders|1884a}}. Fayette Lapham, who said he heard the story in about 1830 from Smith's father, said Smith was stricken three times with ever-increasing force {{Harv|Lapham|1870|p=306}}. Two neighbors who heard the story from Smith in Harmony in the late 1820s said Smith was knocked down three times {{Harv|Lewis|Lewis|1879|p=1}}. Smith himself said he made three unsuccessful attempts to take the plates that day but he did not mention his being stricken {{Harv|Smith|1832|p=3}}. Smith's sister [[Katharine Smith Salisbury|Katharine]] stated that three times, "he felt a pressure pushing hom [him] away" {{Harv|Salisbury|1895|p=14}}. [[David Whitmer]] said that the angel struck Smith three times with such force that he was knocked off the hill onto the surrounding plain and had to reascend it {{Harv|Whitmer|1875}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disconcerted by his inability to obtain the plates, Smith said he briefly wondered whether his experience had been a "dreem of Vision" [sic].&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1832|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Concluding that it was not, he said he prayed to ask why he had been barred from taking the plates.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1832|p=3}}; {{Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=2}} (saying Smith exclaimed, "why Cant I stur this Book?"); {{Harvtxt|Cowdery|1835b|p=198}} (saying that Smith exclaimed, without premeditation, "Why can I not obtain this book?"); {{Harvtxt|Salisbury|1895|p=14}} (saying Smith asked, "Lord, what have I done, that I can not get these records?")&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to his question, Smith said the angel appeared and told him he could not receive the plates because he "had been tempted of the advisary and saught the Plates to obtain riches and kept not the commandments that I should have an eye single to the Glory of God" [sic].&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1832|p=5}}; {{Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=2}} (saying the angel said "you cant have it now," to which Smith responded, "when can I have it?" and the angel said "the 22nt Day of September next if you Bring the right person with you".); {{Harvtxt|Cowdery|1835b|pp=197–98}} (stating that although Smith "supposed his success certain," his failure to keep the "commandments" led to his inability to obtain them). In Smith's 1838 account he said the angel had already told him that he would not receive the plates for another four years {{Harv|Smith|1838a|p=7}}. Smith's brother, who was 11 at the time, said "upon his return [he] told us that in consequence of his not obeying strictly the commandments which the angel had given him, he could not obtain the record until four years from that time" {{Harv|Smith|1883|p=10}}. Smith's sister Katharine (who was 10 at the time) said that Moroni told Smith, "You have not obeyed the commandments as you were commanded to; you must obey His commandments in every particular. You were not to lay them out of your hands until you had them in safe keeping" {{Harv|Salisbury|1895|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; According to Smith's followers, Smith had also broken the angel's commandment "not to lay the plates down, or put them for a moment out of his hands,"&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=85}}; {{Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; and according to a nonbeliever, Smith said, "I had forgotten to give thanks to God," as required by the angel.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Saunders|1893}} (statement of Orson Saunders, who heard the account from his uncle Benjamin Saunders, who heard it from Smith in 1827).&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith said the angel instructed him to return the next year, on September 22, 1824, with the "right person": his older brother [[Alvin Smith (brother of Joseph Smith)|Alvin]].&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=2}} (account of Joseph Knight, Sr., a lifelong follower of Smith); {{Harvtxt|Lapham|1870|p=307}} (account of Fayette Lapham, who became a skeptic after hearing the story from Smith's father in 1830); {{Harvtxt|Salisbury|1895|p=14}} (account of Smith's sister Katharine).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Alvin died in November 1823, and Smith returned to the hill in 1824 to ask what he should do.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Salisbury|1895|p=14}}. {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=85}} (account of Smith's mother). About the time of the scheduled September 22, 1824 meeting with the angel that Alvin was to attend, there were rumors in Palmyra that Alvin's body had been dug up and dissected. To quell such rumors, Smith's father brought witnesses to exhume the body three days after Smith's reported meeting with the angel (September 25) and then ran a notice in a local newspaper, stating that the body remained undisturbed, except, of course, by Smith, Sr., and the witnesses. {{Harv|Smith|1824}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Smith said he was told to return the following year (1825) with the "right person" but the angel did not tell Smith who that person might be.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=2}}; {{Harvtxt|Salisbury|1895|p=14}} (saying the angel said, "You will know her when you see her.").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; However, Smith determined after looking into his seer stone that the "right person" was [[Emma Smith|Emma Hale]], his future wife.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=2}}; {{Harvtxt|Salisbury|1895|p=15}} (saying that Smith "knew when he saw her that she was the one to go with him to get the records").&lt;/ref&gt; For the visit on September 22, 1825, Smith may have attempted to bring his treasure-hunting associate [[Samuel Tyler Lawrence|Samuel T. Lawrence]].&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Chase|1833|p=243}}; {{Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=3}} (saying Lawrence was a seer and had been to the hill and knew what was there); {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=164}} (identifying Samuel T. Lawrence as a practitioner of [[crystal gazing]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt;

Smith said that he visited the hill "at the end of each year" for four years after the first visit in 1823,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1838a|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; but there is no record of him being in the vicinity of Palmyra between January 1826 and January 1827, when he returned to New York from Pennsylvania with his new wife.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=99–100}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; In January 1827, Smith visited the hill and then told his parents that the angel had severely chastised him for not being "engaged enough in the work of the Lord,"&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=99}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; which may have meant that he had missed his annual visit to the hill in 1826.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith's father is cited as stating Smith was late one year and missed the date for visiting the hill and therefore was chastised by the angel {{Harv|Lapham|1870|p=307}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Receiving the plates===
The next annual visit on September 22, 1827 would be, Smith told associates, his last chance to receive the plates.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=3"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; According to [[Brigham Young]], as the scheduled final date to obtain the plates approached, several Palmyra residents expressed concern "that they were going to lose that treasure" and sent for a skilled [[necromancer]] from 60 miles (96&amp;nbsp;km) away, encouraging him to make three separate trips to Palmyra to find the plates.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Young|1855|p=180}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; During one of the trips, the unnamed necromancer is said to have discovered the location but was unable to determine the value of the plates.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Young|1855|pp=180–81}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; A few days prior to the September 22, 1827 visit to the hill, Smith's loyal treasure-hunting friends Josiah Stowell and [[Joseph Knight, Sr.]] traveled to Palmyra, in part, to be there during Smith's scheduled visit to the hill.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=3}} (Saying Knight went to Rochester on business and then passed back through Palmyra so that he could be there on September 22); {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=99}} (Smith's mother, stating Knight and Stowell arrived there September 20, 1827 to inquire on business matters but stayed at the Smith home until September 22).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Smith's former treasure-hunting associates, [[Samuel T. Lawrence]], was also apparently aware of the approaching date to obtain the plates, and Smith was concerned that he might cause trouble.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=3}} (saying Lawrence was a seer, had been to the hill, and knew what was there).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Therefore, on the eve of September 22, 1827, the scheduled date for retrieving the plates, Smith dispatched his father to spy on Lawrence's house until dark. If Lawrence attempted to leave, the elder Smith was to tell him that his son would "thrash the stumps with him" if he found him at the hill.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=3"/&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Late at night, Smith took a horse and carriage to the hill [[Cumorah]] with Emma.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=100}}; {{Harvtxt|Salisbury|1895|p=15}} (Emma "didn't see the records, but she went with him").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; While Emma stayed behind kneeling in prayer,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1853|p=164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Smith walked to the site of the buried plates. Some time in the early morning hours, he said that he retrieved the plates and hid them in a hollow log on or near Cumorah.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Chase|1833|p=246}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1850|p=104}} (Smith had cut away the bark of a decaying log, placed the plates inside and then covered the log with debris); {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=165}}; {{Harvtxt|Salisbury|1895|p=15}} (saying Smith "brought them part way home and hid them in a hollow log").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; At the same time, Smith said he received a pair of large spectacles he called the Urim and Thummim or "Interpreters," with lenses consisting of two [[Seer stones and the Latter Day Saint movement|seer stones]], which he showed [[Lucy Mack Smith|his mother]] when he returned in the morning.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=101}}. Smith's friend Joseph Knight, Sr., said that Smith was even more fascinated by the Interpreters than the plates {{Harv|Knight|1833|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next few days, Smith took a well-digging job in nearby [[Macedon (town), New York|Macedon]] to earn enough money to buy a solid lockable chest in which to put the plates.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=101}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; By then, however, some of Smith's treasure-seeking company had heard that Smith had said that he had been successful in obtaining the plates, and they wanted what they believed was their share of the profits from what they viewed as part of a joint venture in treasure hunting.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=167"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=167}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Spying once again on the house of Samuel Lawrence, Smith, Sr., determined that a group of ten to twelve of these men, including Lawrence and [[Willard Chase]], had enlisted the talents of a renowned and supposedly talented seer from 60 miles (96&amp;nbsp;km) away, in an effort to locate where the plates were hidden by means of [[divination]].&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=102}}; {{Harvtxt|Salisbury|1895|p=15}} (saying that Smith's father "heard that they had got a conjurer, who they said would come and find the plates."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; When Emma heard of that, she rode a stray horse to Macedon and informed Smith,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=103}}; {{Harvtxt|Salisbury|1895|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; who reportedly determined through his Urim and Thummim that the plates were safe. He nevertheless hurriedly rode home with Emma.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=103–104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once home in [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]], he said he walked to [[Cumorah]], removed the plates from their hiding place, and walked home through the woods and away from the road with the plates wrapped in a linen frock under his arm.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=104–06}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; On the way, he said a man had sprung up from behind a log and struck him a "heavy blow with a gun.... Knocking the man down with a single punch, Joseph ran as fast as he could for about a half mile before he was attacked by a second man trying to get the plates. After similarly overpowering the man, Joseph continued to run, but before he reached the house, a third man hit him with a gun. In striking the last man, Joseph said, he injured his thumb."&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|p=99}}{{Harvtxt|Salisbury|1895|p=15}}; {{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=246}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=104–06}}; {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; He returned home with a dislocated thumb and other minor injuries.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=104–06}} (mentioning the dislocated thumb); {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=166}} (mentioning an injury to his side); {{Harvtxt|Salisbury|1895|p=15}} (mentioning the dislocated thumb and an injury to his arm).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Smith sent his father, [[Joseph Knight, Sr.|Joseph Knight]], and Josiah Stowell to search for the pursuers, but they found no one.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=105–06}}; {{Harvtxt|Salisbury|1895|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith is said to have put the plates in a locked chest and hid them in his parents' home in Manchester.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=106}}; {{Harvtxt|Salisbury|1895|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; He refused to allow anyone, including his family, to view the plates or the other artifacts that he said he had in his possession, but some people were allowed to heft them or feel what were said to be the artifacts through a cloth.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=264}}; {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|169–70}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1884}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; A few days after retrieving the plates, Smith brought home what he said was an ancient breastplate, which he said had been hidden in the box at Cumorah with the plates. After letting his mother feel through a thin cloth what she said was the breastplate, he placed it in the locked chest.&lt;!--

FOOTNORE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=107}} (saying she saw the glistening metal, and estimating the breastplate's value at over 500 dollars).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smith home was approached "nearly every night" by villagers hoping to find the chest, where Smith said the plates were kept.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Salisbury|1895|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; After hearing that a group of them would attempt to enter the house by force, Smith buried the chest under the hearth,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=108}}; {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|pp=166–67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; and the family was able to scare away the intended intruders.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Fearing the chest might still be discovered, Smith hid it under the floor boards of his parents' old log home nearby that was then being used as a [[cooper (profession)|cooper]] shop.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=167"/&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Later, Smith told his mother he had taken the plates out of the chest, left the empty chest under the floor boards of the cooper shop, and hid the plates in a barrel of [[flax#Flax seeds|flax]]. Shortly thereafter the empty box was discovered and the place ransacked by Smith's former treasure-seeking associates,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=107–09}}; {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=167}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; who had enlisted one of the men's sisters to find the hiding place by looking in her seer stone.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=109}} The [[scrying|seer]] was the sister of Willard Chase, who said that she had "found a green glass, through which she could see many very wonderful things."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translating the plates===
{{See also|Life of Joseph Smith from 1827 to 1830}}

Smith said that the plates were engraved in an unknown language, and he told associates that he was capable of reading and translating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution-url = https://www.lds.org/topics/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng | contribution = Book of Mormon Translation | title = Gospel Topics | publisher = LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt; The translation took place mainly in [[Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania|Harmony, Pennsylvania]] (now [[Oakland Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania|Oakland Township]]), Emma's hometown, where Smith and his wife had moved in October 1827 with financial assistance from a prominent, though superstitious, Palmyra landowner [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]].&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The local Presbyterian minister, Jesse Townsend, described Harris as a "visionary fanatic." An acquaintance, Lorenzo Saunders, said, "There can't anybody say word against Martin Harris... a man that would do just as he agreed with you. But he was a great man for seeing spooks." {{Harv|Walker|1986|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; The translation occurred in two phases: the first, from December 1827 to June 1828, during which Smith [[Anthon transcript|transcribed some of the characters]] and then dictated [[Lost 116 pages|116 manuscript pages]] to Harris, which were lost. The second phase began sporadically in early 1829 and then in earnest in April 1829 with the arrival of [[Oliver Cowdery]], a schoolteacher who volunteered to serve as Smith's full-time scribe. In June 1829, Smith and Cowdery moved to [[Fayette, New York]], completing the translation early the following month.

[[Image:JosephSmithTranslating.jpg|200px|thumb|left| A 21st-century artistic representation of Joseph Smith translating the golden plates by examining a seer stone in his hat.]]
Smith used scribes to write the words he said were a translation of the golden plates, dictating the words while peering into [[Seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seer stones]], which he said allowed him to see the translation. Smith's translation process evolved from of his previous use of seer stones in treasure-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=73}}; {{Harvtxt|Quinn|1998|p=173}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the earliest phase of translation, Smith said he used what he called Urim and Thummim, two stones set in a frame like a set of large spectacles.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|Mulholland|Thompson|Phelps|1838a|p=5}}. Early followers of Smith used the term ''Urim and Thummim'' to refer to both the large spectacles and Smith's other seer stones, most notably one that was commonly called the "Chase stone" and found by Smith in a Palmyra well in the early 1820s{{Harv|Van Wagoner|Walker|1982|pp=59–62}}; {{Harvtxt|Quinn|1998|p=171}}. {{Harvtxt|Tucker|1867|p=35}} (referring to the Urim and Thummim as "mammoth spectacles").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Witnesses said Smith placed the Urim and Thummim in his hat while he was translating.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Quinn|1998|pp=169–70}}. [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], one of Smith's scribes, is reported to have said that the spectacles were made for a giant and could not have been worn by Smith {{Harv|Anton|1834}}. [[David Whitmer]], another scribe, also said that the spectacles were larger than normal spectacles and indicated that Smith placed them in his hat while translating, rather than wearing them {{Harv|Whitmer|1875}}. However, a man who interviewed Smith's father in 1830 said that Smith did at least some of the translation while he wore the spectacles {{Harv|Lapham|1870}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the loss of the first 116 manuscript pages, Smith translated with a single seer stone, which some sources say he had previously used in treasure-seeking.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hale|1834|p=265}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1879|pp=536–40}}; {{Harv|Van Wagoner|Walker|1982|pp=59–62}} (containing an overview of witnesses to the translation process); {{Harvtxt|Quinn|1998|p=171}} (Whitmer said that the angel had taken the Urim and Thummim after Smith lost the first 116 pages of manuscript but allowed Smith to continue translating with the brown stone); {{Harvtxt|Van Wagoner|1982|p=53}};{{Harvtxt|Givens|2002|p=34}}; {{Harvtxt|Quinn|1998|p=172}}: "Most of Smith's disciples did not emphasize the fact that he was now using for religious purposes the brown seer stone he had previously used for the treasure-quest." Smith's father-in-law, Isaac Hale, said that the "manner in which he pretended to read and interpret was the same as when he looked for the money-diggers, with the stone in his hat, and his hat over his face, while the Book of Plates were at the same time hid in the woods!" {{Harv|Hale|1834|p=265}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith placed the stone in a hat, buried his face in it to eliminate all outside light, and peered into the stone to see the words of the translation.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Whitmer|1875}} ("Having placed the Urim and Thummim in his hat, Joseph placed the hat over his face, and with prophetic eyes read the invisible symbols syllable by syllable and word by word."). Michael Morse, Smith's brother-in-law, stating that he watched Smith on several occasions: "The mode of procedure consisted in Joseph's placing the Seer Stone in the crown of a hat, then putting his face into the hat, so as to entirely cover his face." ({{Harvnb|Van Wagoner|Walker|1982|52–53}}, quoting [[William W. Blair|W. W. Blair]], ''[[Latter Day Saints' Herald]]'' '''26''' (15 November 1879): 341, who was quoting Michael Morse). Smith's wife, Emma, stated that she took dictation from her husband as she sat next to him and that he would put his face into a hat with the stone in it, dictating for hours at a time. {{Harv|Smith|1879|pp=536–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; A few times during the translation, a curtain or blanket was raised between Smith and his scribe or between the living area and the area where Smith and his scribe worked.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Cook|1991|p=173}}. However, Elizabeth Ann Whitmer, later to be the wife of scribe [[Oliver Cowdery]], said that she had never seen a curtain raised between Smith and Cowdery or her brothers while translation was taking place in the Whitmer home {{Harv|Van Wagoner|Walker|1982|p=51}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Sometimes, Smith dictated to Harris from upstairs or from a different room.&lt;!--

Smith's translation did not require the use of the plates themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Marquardt|2005|p=97}}; {{Harv|Van Wagoner|Walker|1982|pp=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Smith himself said very little about the translation process, his friends and family said that as he looked into the stone, the written translation of the ancient script appeared to him in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=72}} (Joseph said almost nothing about his method); {{Harvtxt|Quinn|1998|p=170}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several proposed explanations for how Smith composed his translation. In the 19th century, the most common explanation was that he [[Spalding–Rigdon theory of Book of Mormon authorship|copied the work]] from a manuscript written by [[Solomon Spaulding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Quinn|1998|p=455 n.273}} (most common 19th-century theory); {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=68}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That theory is repudiated by Smith's preeminent modern biographers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=143–44}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=90–91}}; {{Harvtxt|Quinn|1998|p=455 n.273}} (arguing that the theory has been repudiated).&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent modern theory is that Smith composed the translation in response to the provincial opinions of his time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=69}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=72}}).&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps while in a magical trance-like state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bloom|1992|p=86}}; {{Harvtxt|Riley|1902|pp=84, 195}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a matter of faith, Latter Day Saints generally view the translation process as either an automatic process of transcribing text written within the stone&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=72}} (arguing that this transcription method is the only one consistent with the historical record).&lt;/ref&gt; or an intuitive translation by Smith, assisted by a [[Christian mysticism|mystical]] connection with God, through the stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Quinn|1998|pp=479 n.302, 482 n.335}} (expressing his personal view shared by several other [[Mormon apologetics|Mormon apologists]] and noting that while that view might pose problems because of the historical record, it helps to explain the origin of the Book of Mormon's grammatical mistakes).&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's dictations were written down by a number of assistants, including Emma Smith, Martin Harris, and Oliver Cowdery.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Clark|1842}} ("Although in the same room, a thick curtain or blanket was suspended between them, and Smith concealed behind the blanket, pretended to look through his spectacles, or transparent stones, and would then write down or repeat what he saw, which when repeated aloud, was written down by Harris."); {{Harvtxt|Benton|1831}} ("Oliver Cowdery, one of the three witnesses to the book, testified under oath, that said Smith... translated his book [with] two transparent stones, resembling glass, set in silver bows. That by looking through these, he was able to read in English, the reformed Egyptian characters, which were engraved on the plates.").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; In May 1829, after Smith had lent [[lost 116 pages|116 unduplicated manuscript pages]] to Harris, and Harris had lost them, Smith dictated a revelation explaining that Smith could not simply retranslate the lost pages because his opponents would attempt to see if he could "bring forth the same words again."&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Phelps|1833|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; According to [[Grant H. Palmer|Grant Palmer]], Smith believed "a second transcription would be identical to the first. This confirms the view that the English text existed in some kind of unalterable, spiritual form rather than that someone had to think through difficult conceptual issues and idioms, always resulting in variants in any translation."&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Palmer|2002|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location of the plates during translation===
When Smith and Emma moved to Pennsylvania in October 1827, they transported a wooden box, which Smith said contained the plates, hidden in a barrel of beans.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=113}}; {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=170}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; For a time, the couple stayed in the home of Emma's father, Isaac Hale, but when Smith refused to show Hale the plates, Hale banished the concealed objects from his house.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hale|1834|p=264}}; {{Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Afterward, Smith told several of his associates that the plates were hidden in the nearby woods.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hale|1834|p=264}}; {{Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=3}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=115}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Emma said that she remembered the plates being on a table in the house, wrapped in a linen tablecloth, which she moved from time to time when it got in the way of her chores.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Smith|1879"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1879}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; According to Smith's mother, the plates were also stored in a trunk on Emma's bureau.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; However, Smith did not require the physical presence of the plates to translate them.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Stevenson|1882}}; {{Harvtxt|Hale|1834|pp=264–65}}; {{Harvtxt|Van Horn|1881}}; {{Harvtxt|Whitmer|1875}} ("The plates were not before Joseph while he translated, but seem to have been removed by the custodian angel."). [[Isaac Hale]] said that while Joseph was translating, the plates were "hid in the woods" {{Harv|Hale|1834|p=264}}. [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]] said they were "hid in the mountains" {{Harvtxt|Palmer|2002|pp=2–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1828, [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]]'s wife, [[Lucy Harris|Lucy]], visited Harmony with her husband and demanded to see the plates. When Smith refused to show them to her, she searched the house, grounds, and woods. According to Smith's mother, during the search Lucy was frightened by a large, black snake and so was prevented from digging up the plates.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=115–116}}. Lucy may have caused the "loss" of [[lost 116 pages|the 116 manuscript pages]], which Smith had lent her husband.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; As a result of Martin Harris's loss of the [[lost 116 pages|116 pages]] of manuscript, Smith said that between July and September 1828, the [[angel Moroni]] took back both the plates and the Urim and Thummim as a penalty for his having delivered "the manuscript into the hands of a wicked man."&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=125}} (stating that the angel took back the Urim and Thummim but referring to the revelation, which stated the plates were taken too); {{Harvtxt|Smith|1832|p=5}} (referring only to the plates); {{Harvtxt|Phelps|1833|loc=9:1, p. 22}} (a revelation referring only to the plates and to Smith's "gift" to translate).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; According to Smith's mother, the angel returned the objects to Smith on September 22, 1828, the anniversary of the day that he first received them.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=126}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1829, Martin Harris visited Harmony and asked to see the plates. Smith told him that he "would go into the woods where the Book of Plates was, and that after he came back, Harris should follow his tracks in the snow, and find the Book, and examine it for himself."  Harris followed the directions but could not find the plates.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hale|1834|pp=264–265}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early June 1829, the unwanted attentions of locals around Harmony necessitated Smith's move to the home of [[David Whitmer]] and his parents in [[Fayette, New York]]. Smith said that during this move the plates were transported by the [[angel Moroni]], who put them in the garden of the Whitmer house, where Smith could recover them. The translation was completed at the Whitmer home.&lt;!--

===Returning the plates===

After translation was complete, Smith said he returned the plates to the angel, but he did not elaborate about this experience.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Van Horn|1881}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; According to accounts by several early Mormons, a group of Mormon leaders, including [[Oliver Cowdery]], [[David Whitmer]], and possibly others&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Young|1877|p=38}} (mentioning only Smith and Cowdery); {{Harvtxt|Packer|2004|pp=52, 55}} (including David Whitmer in the list and describing Whitmer's account of the event and citing William Horne Dame Diary, 14 January 1855, stating that [[Hyrum Smith]] was also in the group).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; accompanied Smith and returned the plates to a cave inside the [[Hill Cumorah]].&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Packer|2004|p=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; There, Smith is said to have placed the plates on a table near "many wagon loads" of other ancient records, and the [[Sword of Laban]] hanging on the cave wall.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Young|1877|p=38}} (Young said he heard this from [[Oliver Cowdery]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; According to [[Brigham Young]]'s understanding, which he said that he had gained from Cowdery, on a later visit to the cave, the Sword of Laban was said to be unsheathed and placed over the plates and inscribed with the words: "This sword will never be sheathed again until the kingdoms of this world become the kingdom of our God and his Christ."&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Young|1877|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith taught that part of the golden plates were "sealed."&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Smith|1842|p=707"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1842|p=707}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; The "sealed" portion is said to contain "a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof."&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 27:7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Many Latter Day Saints believe that the plates will be kept hidden until a future time, when the sealed part will be translated&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Packer|2004|p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; and, according to one early Mormon leader, transferred from the hill to one of the Mormon temples.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Packer|2004|p=55}} (quoting a statement by [[Orson Pratt]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Whitmer]] is quoted as stating that he saw just the ''untranslated'' portion of the plates sitting on the table with the sword (and also a breastplate).&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Packer|2004|p=55}} (citing reporter Edward Stevenson's 1877 interview with Whitmer).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Apparently, Whitmer was aware of expeditions at Cumorah to locate the sealed portion of the plates through "science and mineral rods," which, he said, "testify that they are there."&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Packer|2004|p=55}}. At least one Mormon scholar doubts the existence of a Cumorah cave and instead argues that early Mormons saw a vision of a cave in another location.{{Harvtxt|Tvedtnes|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptions of the plates==
{{Main|Book of Mormon witnesses}}

Smith said the [[angel Moroni]] had commanded him not to show the plates to any unauthorized person.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; However, Smith eventually obtained the written statement of [[Book of Mormon witnesses|several witnesses]] who saw the plates. It is unclear whether the witnesses believed they had seen the plates with their physical eyes or had seen them in a vision. For instance, although Martin Harris continued to testify to the truth of the [[Book of Mormon]] even when he was estranged from the church, at least during the early years of the movement, he "seems to have repeatedly admitted the internal, subjective nature of his visionary experience."&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, ''Early Mormon Documents'', 2: 255. The foreman in the Palmyra printing office that produced the first Book of Mormon said that Harris "used to practice a good deal of his characteristic jargon and 'seeing with the spiritual eye,' and the like." [[Pomeroy Tucker]], ''Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism'' (New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1867), 71 in ''EMD'', 3: 122. John H. Gilbert, the typesetter for most of the book, said that he had asked Harris, "Martin, did you see those plates with your naked eyes?" According to Gilbert, Harris "looked down for an instant, raised his eyes up, and said, 'No, I saw them with a spiritual eye.'" John H. Gilbert, "Memorandum," 8 September 1892, in ''EMD'', 2: 548. Two other Palmyra residents said that Harris told them that he had seen the plates with "the eye of faith" or "spiritual eyes." Martin Harris interviews with John A. Clark, 1827 &amp; 1828 in ''EMD'', 2: 270; Jesse Townsend to Phineas Stiles, 24 December 1833, in ''EMD'', 3: 22. In 1838, Harris is said to have told an Ohio congregation that "he never saw the plates with his natural eyes, only in vision or imagination." Stephen Burnett to [[Lyman E. Johnson]], 15 April 1838 in ''EMD'', 2: 291. A neighbor of Harris in Kirtland, Ohio, said that Harris "never claimed to have seen [the plates] with his natural eyes, only spiritual vision." Reuben P. Harmon statement, c. 1885, in ''EMD'', 2: 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some sources, Smith initially intended that the first authorized witness be his firstborn son;&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Chase|1834}} (citing Martin Harris as stating in 1829 that Smith’s unborn son would translate the plates at the age of two (this son was stillborn), and thereafter, "you will see Joseph Smith Jr. walking through the streets of Palmyra, with the Gold Bible under his arm, and having a gold breast-plate on, and a gold sword hanging by his side."); {{Harvtxt|Hale|1834|p=264}} (stating that the first witness would be "a young child”).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; but this child was stillborn in 1828.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=269}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; In March 1829, [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] came to Harmony to see the plates, but was unable to find them in the woods where Smith said they could be found.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In March 1829, Martin Harris returned to Harmony and wanted to see the plates firsthand. Smith reportedly told Harris that Smith "would go into the woods where the Book of Plates was, and that after he came back, Harris should follow his tracks in the snow, and find the Book, and examine it for himself"; after following these directions, however, Harris could not find the plates {{Harv|Hale|1834|pp=264–265}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; The next day,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hale|1834|p=265}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Smith dictated a revelation stating that Harris could eventually qualify himself&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;To qualify as a witness, Harris had to “humble himself in mighty prayer and faith” {{Harv|Phelps|1833|pp=10–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; to be one of three witnesses with the exclusive right to "view [the plates] as they are".&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Phelps|1833|pp=11–12}}. Smith’s dictated text of the [[Book of Ether]] (chapter 2) also made reference to three witnesses, stating that the plates would be shown to them "by the power of God" {{Harv|Smith|1830|p=548}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 1829, Smith determined that there would be eight additional witnesses, a total of twelve including Smith.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In June 1829, around the time these eleven additional witnesses were selected, Smith dictated a revelation commanding [[Oliver Cowdery]] and [[David Whitmer]] (two of the eventual [[Three Witnesses]]) to seek out twelve "disciples", who desired to serve, and who would "go into all the world to preach my gospel unto every creature", and who would be ordained to baptize and to ordain priests and teachers {{Harv|Phelps|1833|p=37}}. According to [[D. Michael Quinn]], this was a reference to selecting the [[witnesses of the Book of Mormon]], who would be a leading body of Smith's [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. Mormon religious and apologetic commentators understand this revelation as referring to the eventual (in 1835, six years later) formation of the first [[Quorum of the Twelve]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; During the second half of June 1829,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Van Horn|1881}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Smith took Harris, [[Oliver Cowdery]] and [[David Whitmer]] (known collectively as the [[Three Witnesses]])&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Smith's mother, upon hearing news in June 1929 that Smith had completed the translation of the plates {{Harv|Smith|1853|p=138}}, [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] accompanied the Smith parents to the Whitmer home in [[Fayette, New York]], where Smith was staying {{Harv|Smith|1853|p=138}}, to inquire about the translation {{Harv|Roberts|1902|p=51}}. When Harris arrived, he joined with [[Oliver Cowdery]] and [[David Whitmer]] to request that the three be named as the [[Three Witnesses]], and Smith's dictated revelation designating the three of them as the witnesses {{Harv|Smith|Cowdery|Rigdon|Williams|1835|p=171}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; into woods in Fayette, New York, where they said they saw an angel holding the golden plates and turning the leaves.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|pp=54–55}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1830b|loc=appendix}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; The four also said they heard "the voice of the Lord" telling them that the translation of the plates was correct, and commanding them to testify of what they saw and heard.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|pp=54–55}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1830b|loc=appendix}}. [[David Whitmer]] later stated that the angel showed them "the breast plates, the [[Liahona (Book of Mormon)|Ball or Directors]], the [[Sword of Laban]] and other plates". ({{Harvtxt|Van Horn|1881}}; {{Harvtxt|Kelley|Blakeslee|1882}}; see also {{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|p=171}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; A few days later, Smith took a different group of [[Eight Witnesses]]&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Eight Witnesses]] consisted of two groups: (1) the males of the Whitmer home, including [[David Whitmer]]'s brothers [[Peter Whitmer Jr.|Peter]], [[Christian Whitmer|Christian]], [[Jacob Whitmer|Jacob]], and [[John Whitmer|John]], and his brother-in-law [[Hiram Page]]; and (2) the older males of the Smith family, including is father [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]] and his brothers [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] and [[Samuel H. Smith (Latter Day Saints)|Samuel]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; to a location near Smith's parents' home in [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra]]&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853}}. Because of a foreclosure on their [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]] property, the Smith family was then living in a log cabin technically in [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra]] ({{Harvnb|Smith|1883|p=14}}; {{Harvnb|Berge|1985}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; where they said Smith showed them the golden plates.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|p=57}}. Though the Eight Witnesses did not refer, like the Three, to an angel or the voice of God, they said that they had hefted the plates and seen the engravings on them: “The translator of this work, has shown unto us the plates of which hath been spoken, which have the appearance of gold; and as many of the leaves as the said Smith has translated we did handle with our hands; and we also saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of ancient work, and of curious workmanship" {{Harv|Smith|1830b|appendix}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Statements over the names of these men, apparently drafted by Smith,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This is the conclusion of {{Harvtxt|Palmer|2002|pp=195–96}}, who compared "The Testimony of Three Witnesses" to part of the Doctrine and Covenants written in 1829 (first published at {{Harvtxt|Smith|Cowdery|Rigdon|Williams|1835|p=171}}), and concluding that they show "the marks of common authorship". Palmer also compares a letter from Oliver Cowdery to Hyrum Smith dated June 14, 1829, quoting the language of this revelation (Joseph Smith letterbook (22 November 1835 to 4 August 1835), 5-6). Commentators generally agree that this letter refers to the revelation. See Larry C. Porter, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1979/06/dating-the-restoration-of-the-melchizedek-priesthood "Dating the Restoration of the Melchizedek Priesthood"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', June 1979, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1830b|appendix}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; According to later statements ascribed to [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], he viewed the plates in a vision and not with his "natural eyes."&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gilbert|1892}} (during the printing of the Book of Mormon, when asked whether Harris had seen the plates with his bodily eyes, he replied, "No, I saw them with a spiritual eye."); {{Harvtxt|Burnett|1838}} (Burnett "came to hear Martin Harris state in public that he never saw the plates with his natural eyes only in vision or imagination, neither Oliver nor David &amp; also that the eight witnesses never saw them &amp; hesitated to sign that instrument for that reason, but were persuaded to do it, the last pedestal gave away"); {{Harvtxt|Parrish|1838}} ("Martin Harris, one of the subscribing witnesses, has come out at last, and says he never saw the plates, from which the book purports to have been translated, except in vision, and he further says that any man who says he has seen them in any other way is a liar, Joseph not excepted."; Metcalf in ''EMD'', 2: 347 (quoting Harris, near the end of his long life, as saying he had seen the plates in "a state of entrancement"). Harris was resolute, however, as to his position that he had seen the plates in a vision. See Letter of Martin Harris, Sr., to Hanna B. Emerson, January 1871, Smithfield, Utah Territory, ''[[Saints' Herald]]'' '''22''' (15 October 1875):630, in ''EMD'' 2: 338 ("No man heard me in any way deny the truth of the Book of Mormon, the administration of the angel that showed me the plates; nor the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints under the administration of Joseph Smith Jr."). See also [[Richard Lloyd Anderson]], ''Investigating the ''Book of Mormon'' Witnesses'' (Salt Lake City: [[Deseret Book Company]], 1981), 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Smith and the other eleven who claimed to be witnesses, a few other early Mormons said they saw the plates. For instance, Smith's mother [[Lucy Mack Smith]] said she had "seen and handled" the plates.&lt;!--

--&gt; Smith's wife Emma and his younger brother [[William Smith (Latter Day Saints)|William]] and younger sister [[Katharine Smith Salisbury|Katharine]] also said they had examined and lifted the plates while they were wrapped in fabric.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1879}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1884}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Others said they had visions of the plates or had been shown the plates by an angel, in some cases years after Smith said he had returned the plates.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For instances of people testifying to having seen the golden plates ''after'' Smith returned them to the angel, see the affirmations of John Young and Harrison Burgess in {{Harvtxt|Palmer|2002|p=201}}. In 1859, Brigham Young referred to one of these "post-return" testimonies: "Some of the witnesses of the Book of Mormon, who handled the plates and conversed with the angels of God, were afterwards left to doubt and to disbelieve that they had ever seen an angel. One of the Quorum of the Twelve, a young man full of faith and good works, prayed, and the vision of his mind was opened, and the angel of God came and laid the plates before him, and he saw and handled them, and saw the angel." ''[[Journal of Discourses]]'', June 5, 1859, '''7''':164.&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt; In 1859 Harris said that the plates "were seven inches [18 cm] wide by eight inches [20 cm] in length, and were of the thickness of plates of tin; and when piled one above the other, they were altogether about four inches [10 cm] thick; and they were put together on the back by three silver rings, so that they would open like a book".&lt;!--

--&gt; [[David Whitmer]], another of the [[Three Witnesses]], was quoted by an 1831 Palmyra newspaper as having said the plates were "the thickness of tin plate; the back was secured with three small rings ... passing through each leaf in succession".&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Cole|1831"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Cole|1831}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Anomalously, [[Joseph Smith, Sr.|Smith's father]] is quoted as saying that the plates were only half an inch (1.27 centimeter) thick.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lapham|1870|p=307}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; [[Lucy Mack Smith|Smith's mother]], who said she had "seen and handled" the plates, is quoted as saying they were "eight inches [20 cm] long, and six [15 cm] wide ... all connected by a ring which passes through a hole at the end of each plate".&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Smith|1842b|p=27"/&gt;

[[Hyrum Smith]] and [[John Whitmer]], also [[Eight Witnesses|witnesses in 1829]], are reported to have stated that the rings holding the plates together were, in Hyrum's words, "in the shape of the letter D, which facilitated the opening and shutting of the book".&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Statement by Hyrum Smith as reported by [[William E. McLellin]] in the ''Huron Reflector'', October 31, 1831. See also {{Harvtxt|Poulson|1878|}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Smith's wife Emma and his younger brother [[William Smith (Mormonism)|William]] said they had examined the plates while wrapped in fabric. Emma said she "felt of the plates, as they thus lay on the table, tracing their outline and shape. They seemed to be pliable like thick paper, and would rustle with a metallic sound when the edges were moved by the thumb, as one does sometimes thumb the edges of a book".&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Smith|1879"/&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; William agreed that the plates could be rustled with one's thumb like the pages of a book.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1884}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith did not provide his own published description of the plates until 1842, when he said in a letter that "each plate was six inches [15 cm] wide and eight inches [20 cm] long, and not quite so thick as common tin. They were ... bound together in a volume, as the leaves of a book, with three rings running through the whole. The volume was something near six inches [15 cm] in thickness".&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Smith|1842"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1842}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Described composition and weight===
The plates were first described as "gold", and beginning about 1827, the plates were widely called the "gold bible".&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=167}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=102, 109, 113, 145}}; {{Harvtxt|Grandin|1829}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; When the Book of Mormon was published in 1830, the [[Eight Witnesses]] described the plates as having "the appearance of gold".&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Smith|1830|loc=appx"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1830|loc=appx.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; The Book of Mormon describes the plates as being made of "ore".&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1830|loc=Mormon 8:5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; In 1831, a Palmyra newspaper quoted [[David Whitmer]], one of the [[Three Witnesses]], as having said that the plates were a "''whitish yellow'' color", with "three small rings of the same metal".&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Cole|1831"/&gt;

Smith's first published description of the plates said that the plates "had the appearance of gold",&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Smith|1842"/&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; and Smith said that Moroni had referred to the plates as "gold."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Smith–History]] 1:34.&lt;/ref&gt; Late in life, [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] stated that the rings holding the plates together were made of silver,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris 1859 165"/&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; and he said the plates themselves, based on their heft of "forty or fifty pounds" (18–23&amp;nbsp;kg),&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; "were lead or gold".&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=169}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Joseph's brother [[William Smith (Latter Day Saints)|William]], who said he felt the plates inside a pillow case in 1827, said in 1884 that he understood the plates to be "a mixture of gold and copper ... much heavier than stone, and very much heavier than wood".&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different people estimated the weight of the plates differently. According to Smith's one-time-friend [[Willard Chase]], Smith told him in 1827 that the plates weighed between 40 and 60 pounds (18–27&amp;nbsp;kg), most likely the latter.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Chase|1833|p=246}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Smith's father [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]], who was one of the [[Eight Witnesses]], reportedly weighed them and said in 1830 that they "weighed thirty pounds" (14&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lapham|1870}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Smith's brother William, who had lifted the plates, thought they "weighed about sixty pounds [27 kg] according to the best of my judgment".&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1883}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Others who lifted the plates while they were wrapped in cloth or enclosed in a box thought that they weighed about 60 pounds [27&amp;nbsp;kg]. Martin Harris said that he had "hefted the plates many times, and should think they weighed forty or fifty pounds [18–23 kg]".&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|pp=166, 169}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Smith's wife Emma never estimated the weight of the plates but said they were light enough for her to "move them from place to place on the table, as it was necessary in doing my work".&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Smith|1879"/&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Based on some of the descriptions of the plates' dimensions, one scholar speculates that, had the plates been made of 24-karat gold (which Smith never claimed), they would have weighed about 140 pounds (64&amp;nbsp;kg),&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|loc=p. 600, n. 65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; while LDS writers have speculated that the plates were made of a copper-gold alloy like [[tumbaga]], which would have weighed significantly less.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Putnam|1966}}; {{citation |last=Smith |first=Robert F. |title=The "Golden" Plates |url=http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/books/?bookid=71&amp;chapid=847#6 |publisher=The Maxwell Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Sealed" portion===
According to Smith and others, the golden plates contained a "sealed" portion&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Smith|1842|p=707"/&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; containing "a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof."&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 27:7. The "sealing" of apocalyptic revelations in a book has precedents in the [[Bible]]. See, for example, Isaiah 29:11, Daniel 12:4, and Revelation 5:1–5. The Book of Mormon states that this vision was originally given to the [[Brother of Jared]], recorded by Ether on a set of 24 plates later found by [[Limhi]], and then "sealed up". Book of Mormon, Ether 1:2. According to this account, [[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]] copied the plates of Limhi onto the sealed portion of the golden plates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Smith never described the nature of the seal, and the language of the [[Book of Mormon]] may be interpreted to describe a sealing that was spiritual, metaphorical,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;i.e. that the book was "sealed" in the sense that its contents were hidden or kept from public knowledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; physical, or a combination of these elements.

The Book of Mormon refers to other documents and plates as being "sealed" to be revealed at some future time. For example, the [[Book of Mormon]] says the entire set of plates was "sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord"&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Smith|1830|loc=title page}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; and that separate records of [[John the Apostle]] were "sealed up to come forth in their purity" in the [[end times]].&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Book of Mormon, 1 Nephi 14:26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; One set of plates to which the Book of Mormon refers was "sealed up" in the sense that they were written in a language that could not be read.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Book of Mormon, Ether 3:22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith may have understood the sealing to be a [[supernatural]] or spiritual sealing "by the power of God" (2 Nephi 27:10),&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Quinn|1998|pp=195–196}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; an idea supported by a reference in the Book of Mormon to the "interpreters" with which Smith said they were buried or "sealed."&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Book of Mormon, Ether 4:5. According to [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], anyone who looked into the "interpreters", "except by the command of God", would "perish" {{Harv|Harris|1859|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Oliver Cowdery also stated that when Smith visited the hill, he was stricken by a supernatural force because the plates were "sealed by the prayer of faith."&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Cowdery|1835b|p=198}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several witnesses described a physical sealing placed on part of the plates by Mormon or Moroni. [[David Whitmer]] said that when an angel showed him the plates in 1829, "a large portion of the leaves were so securely bound together that it was impossible to separate them,"&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Whitmer interview, ''Chicago Tribune'', 24 January 1888, in David Whitmer Interviews, ed. Cook, 221. Near the end of his life, Whitmer said that one section of the book was "loose, in plates, the other solid". {{Harvtxt|Storey|1881}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; that the "sealed" part of the plates were held together as a solid mass "stationary and immovable,"&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Cole|1831}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; "as solid to my view as wood,"&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Poulson|1878}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; and that there were "perceptible marks where the plates appeared to be sealed"&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Storey|1881"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Storey|1881}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; with leaves "so securely bound that it was impossible to separate them."&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Whitmer|1888}}. [[Orson Pratt]], who said he had spoken with many witnesses of the plates,{{Harv|Pratt|1859|p=30}}, assumed that Smith could "break the seal" if only he had been "permitted" {{Harv|Pratt|1877|pp=211–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; In 1842, [[Lucy Mack Smith]] said that some of the plates were "sealed together" while others were "loose."&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Smith|1842b|p=27" /&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; The account of the [[Eight Witnesses]] says they saw the plates in 1829 and handled "as many of the leaves as Smith has translated," implying that they did not examine untranslated parts, such as the sealed portion.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Smith|1830|loc=appx"/&gt; In one interview, David Whitmer said that "about half" the book was unsealed;&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Cole|1831}}; {{Harvtxt|Poulson|1878}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; in 1881, he said "about one-third" was unsealed.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Storey|1881"/&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Whitmer's 1881 statement is consistent with an 1856 statement by [[Orson Pratt]], an associate of Smith's who never saw the plates himself but who had spoken with witnesses,&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pratt|1859|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; that "about two-thirds" of the plates were "sealed up".&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pratt|1856|p=347}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engravings===
{{Main|Reformed Egyptian}}

The golden plates were said to contain engravings that the Book of Mormon describes as [[reformed Egyptian]].&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Smith|1830|loc=Mormon 9:32}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Smith described the writing as "Egyptian characters ... small, and beautifully engraved," exhibiting "much skill in the art of engraving."&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Smith|1842"/&gt;

[[John Whitmer]], one of the [[Eight Witnesses]], said the plates had "fine engravings on both sides,"&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Roberts|1906|p=307}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; and [[Orson Pratt]], who did not see the plates himself but who had spoken with witnesses, understood that there were engravings on both sides of the plates, "stained with a black, hard stain, so as to make the letters more legible and easier to be read."&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pratt|1859|pp=30–31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance in the Latter Day Saint tradition==
{{Main|Mormonism and engraved metal plates}}

The golden plates are significant within the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] because they are the reputed source for the [[Book of Mormon]], which Smith called the "most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion."&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1908|p=461}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; However, the golden plates are just one of many known and reputed metal plates with significance in the Latter Day Saint movement. The Book of Mormon itself refers to a long tradition of writing historical records on plates, of which the golden plates are a culmination (see [[List of plates (Latter Day Saint movement)]]). In addition, Smith once believed in the authenticity of a set of engraved metal plates called the [[Kinderhook plates]],&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=490}};{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=291}}: "The whole of Nauvoo soon buzzed with the discovery. The ''Times and Seasons''  published full reproductions as further proof of the authenticity of the Book of Mormon, and the printing office sold facsimiles at one dollar a dozen."  The original source is William Clayton's Journal, May 1, 1843 (See also, ''Trials of Discipleship — The Story of William Clayton, a Mormon,'' 117): ''"I have seen 6 brass plates ... covered with ancient characters of language containing from 30 to 40 on each side of the plates. Prest J. has translated a portion and says they contain the history of the person with whom they were found and he was a descendant of Ham through the loins of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and that he received his kingdom from the ruler of heaven and earth."'' The information was deemed important enough to be republished in the first person (as if Smith had said it) in the ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'': ''"I insert facsimiles of the six brass plates found near Kinderhook ... I have translated a portion of them, and find they contain the history of the person with whom they were found. He was a descendant of Ham, through the loins of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and that he received his kingdom from the Ruler of heaven and earth."'' More than six pages of ''History of the Church'', 5:372–79 discuss the Kinderhook plates, and Smith directed Reuben Hedlock to make woodcuts of the plates. {{Harvtxt|Palmer|2002|p=31}} "Church historians continued to insist on the authenticity of the Kinderhook plates until 1980 when an examination conducted by the Chicago Historical Society, possessor of one plate, proved it was a nineteenth-century creation." {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; although these plates turned out to be a hoax by non-Mormons who sought to entice Smith to translate them in order to discredit his reputation.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bushman, ''Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005), 489–90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt;

Two other sets of alleged plates, the [[Voree plates]] and the [[Book of the Law of the Lord]], were translated by [[James J. Strang|James Strang]]—one of three major contenders to succeed Smith—who went on to lead the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)]].&lt;ref&gt;The Voree plates were alleged to have been written by an ancient inhabitant of what is now [[Burlington, Wisconsin]], while the Book of the Law of the Lord was alleged by Strang to be a translation of the [[Plates of Laban]] mentioned in the Book of Mormon. Neither of these alleged discoveries by Strang is accepted as authentic outside of the Strangite community.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Latter Day Saints, especially those within the [[Community of Christ]], have doubted the historicity of the golden plates and downplayed their significance.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref name = mcmurray/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ostling|1999|p=259}}: "'Were there really gold plates and ministering angels, or was there just Joseph Smith Seated at a table with his face in a hat dictating to a scribe a fictional account of the ancient inhabitants of the Americas?' Resolving that problem haunts loyal Mormons. The blunt questioner quoted is Brigham D. Madsen, a liberal Mormon and onetime history teacher at Brigham Young University."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; For most Latter Day Saints, however, the physical existence and authenticity of the golden plates are essential elements of their faith. For them, the message of the Book of Mormon is inseparable from the story of its origins.&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Givens|2003|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hugh Nibley]] said in 1957 that proof of the actual existence of the golden plates would not settle disputes about the Book of Mormon and the story of its origin.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Nibley, [http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1107&amp;index=5 ''An Approach to the Book of Mormon'']: "Critics of the Book of Mormon often remark sarcastically that it is a great pity that the golden plates have disappeared, since they would very conveniently prove Joseph Smith's story. They would do nothing of the sort. The presence of the plates would only prove that there were plates, no more: it would not prove that Nephites wrote them, or that an angel brought them, or that they had been translated by the gift and power of God; and we can be sure that scholars would quarrel about the writing on them for generations without coming to any agreement, exactly as they did about the writings of Homer and parts of the Bible. The possession of the plates would have a very disruptive effect, and it would prove virtually nothing. On the other hand, a far more impressive claim is put forth when the whole work is given to the world in what is claimed to be a divinely inspired translation—in such a text any cause or pretext for disagreement and speculation about the text is reduced to an absolute minimum: it is a text which all the world can read and understand, and is a far more miraculous object than any gold plates would be."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Versailles - plan of premier étage of Enveloppe - Berger 1985 Fig12 (Queen's apartment in yellow).jpg|thumb|Plan of the Palace of Versailles {{Circa|1676}} (before the [[History of the Palace of Versailles#Third building campaign|third building campaign]]), with the Queen's grand apartment marked in yellow]]

The '''''grand appartement de la reine''''' is the Queen's grand apartment of the [[Palace of Versailles]].

Forming a parallel [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]] with that of the ''[[grand appartement du roi]]'', the ''grand appartement de la reine'' served as the residence of three queens of France — [[Marie-Thérèse d’Autriche]], wife of [[Louis XIV]]; [[Marie Leszczyńska]], wife of [[Louis XV]]; and [[Marie-Antoinette]], wife of [[Louis XVI]]. Additionally, Louis XIV’s granddaughter-in-law, [[Marie-Adélaïde de Savoie]], as duchesse de Bourgogne, occupied these rooms from 1697, the year of her marriage, to her death in 1712.

[[Image:Versailles Queen's Chamber.jpg|thumb|right|280px|The Queen's bedchamber. There is a barely discernible hidden door in the corner near the jewel cabinet by Schwerdfeger (1787) through which Marie Antoinette escaped the night of 5/6 October 1789 when the Paris mob stormed Versailles.]]

When [[Louis Le Vau]]’s envelope of the ''château vieux'' (old palace) was completed, the ''grand appartement de la reine'' came to include a suite of seven enfilade rooms on the main floor in the left wing with an arrangement that mirrored almost exactly the ''grand appartement du roi'' in the right wing. The configuration was:

# Chapel — corresponding to the salon de Diane in the King's grand apartment&lt;ref&gt;This chapel was the second of chapels built in the château of Versailles&lt;/ref&gt;
# Salle de gardes — corresponding to the salon de Mars in the King's grand apartment
# Antichambre — corresponding to the salon de Mercure in the King's grand apartment
# Chambre — corresponding to with the salon d’Apollon in the King's grand apartment
# Grand cabinet — corresponding to the salon de Jupiter in the King's grand apartment
# Oratory — corresponding to the salon de Saturne in the King's grand apartment
# Petit cabinet — corresponding to the salon de Vénus in the King's grand apartment&lt;ref&gt;Owing to the construction of the Hall of Mirrors — the central project of Louis XIV’s 3rd building campaign — and the death of Marie-Thérèse in 1683, the grand cabinet, the oratory, and the petit cabinet were destroyed for the construction of the Hall of Mirrors and the Salon de la paix.  Of these three rooms, only fragments of the ceiling decoration of the Grand cabinet have survived; no evidence regarding the decoration of the oratory or the petit cabinet has been found.  See Nicole Reynaud and Jacques Villain, “Fragments retrouvés de la décoration du Grand Appartement de la Reine Marie-Thérèse,” Revue du Louvre, #4-5 (1970): 231-238.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the decoration of the ceiling in the ''grand appartement du roi'', which depicted the heroic actions of Louis XIV as allegories from events taken from the antique past, the decoration of the ''grand appartement de la reine'' likewise depicted heroines from the antique past and harmonized with the general theme of a particular room’s decor.&lt;ref&gt;On an interesting note, not only were women depicted in the decoration of the ''grand appartement de la reine'', but women contributed to the decoration of these rooms.  Most notable of these ladies would be Madeleine de Boulogne, who painted the over-door painting in the ''salle des gardes''.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the construction of the [[Hall of Mirrors]], which began in 1678, the configuration of the ''grand appartement de la reine'' changed. The chapel was transformed into the ''salle des gardes de la reine'' and it was in this room that the decorations from the ''salon de Jupiter'' were reused.&lt;ref&gt;With the creation of this room, a new chapel — the château’s third — was built in the adjacent room to the east.  In 1682, when the third chapel was built (where the ''salon d’Hercule'' is now located), this room was renamed ''la grande salle des gardes de la reine''.  In the 19th century, this room was rebaptized ''salle du sacre'' owing to the installation of Jean-Louis David’s Coronation of Napoléon I.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''salle des gardes de la reine'' communicates with a loggia that issues from the ''escalier de la reine'' (Queen's staircase), which corresponded (albeit a smaller, though similarly-decorated example) to the ''escalier des ambassadeurs'' (Ambassador's Staircase) in the ''grand appartement du roi''.  The loggia also provides access to the ''appartement du roi'', the suite of rooms in which Louis XIV lived.  Toward the end of Louis XIV’s reign, the ''escalier de la reine'' became the principal entrance to the château, with the ''escalier des ambassadeurs'' used on rare state occasions.  After the destruction of the ''escalier des ambassadeurs'' in 1752, the ''escalier de la reine'' became the main entrance to the château.

From 1682, the ''grand appartement de la reine'' included:

* Salle des gardes de la reine
* Antichambre (formerly the salle des gardes)
* Grand cabinet
* Chambre de la reine

With the death of Louis XIV in 1715, the court moved to [[Vincennes]] and later to Paris.  In 1722, Louis XV reinstalled the court at Versailles and began modifications to the château’s interior.  Among the most noteworthy of the building projects during Louis XV’s reign, the redecoration of the ''chambre de la reine'' must be cited.

To commemorate the birth of his only son and heir, [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729–1765)|Louis]], in 1729, Louis XV ordered a complete redecoration of the room.  Elements of the ''chambre de la reine'' as it had been used by Marie-Thérèse and Marie-Adélaïde de Savoie were removed and a new, more modern decor was installed.&lt;ref&gt;The decoration of this room was an important expression in French interior design.  It heralded the transition from the [[Régence|Regency]] style, which prevailed from the death of Louis XIV through to 1732 (with the decoration of the Salon de la princesse at the [[Hôtel de Soubise]]), and the Rococo (or style Louis XV), the style that prevailed for the greater part of the reign of Louis XV.&lt;/ref&gt;

During her life at Versailles, [[Marie Leszczynska]] (1703–1768) lived in the ''grand appartement de la reine'', to which she annexed the ''salon de la paid'' to serve as a music room.  In 1770, when the Austrian archduchess Marie-Antoinette married the dauphin, later Louis XVI, she took up residence in these rooms.  Upon Louis XVI’s ascension to the throne in 1774, Marie-Antoinette ordered major redecoration of the ''grand appartement de la reine''.  At this time, the queen’s apartment achieved the arrangement that we see today.

* Salle des gardes de la reine — this room remained virtually unchanged by Marie-Antoinette.&lt;ref&gt;It was via this room that the Paris mob, which stormed the château during the night of 6/7 October 1789, gained access to the château.  During the mêlée, members of the garde Suisse, which formed part the queen’s bodyguard, were killed in their attempts to protect the queen.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Antichambre — this room was transformed into the antichambre du grand couvert.  It was in this room that the king, queen, and members of the royal family dined in public.  Occasionally, this room served as a theater for the château.
* Grand cabinet — this room was transformed into the salon des nobles.  Following the tradition established by her predecessor, Marie-Antoinette would hold formal audiences in this room. When not used for formal audiences, the salon des nobles served as an antechamber to the queen’s bedroom.
* Chambre de la reine — this room was used as the queen’s bedroom, and was of exceptional splendor.  On the night of 6/7 October 1789, Marie-Antoinette fled from the Paris mob by escaping through a private corridor that connected her apartment with that of the king.

A '''herbarium''' (plural: '''herbaria''') is a collection of preserved [[plant]] specimens and associated data used for scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rbge.org.uk/science/herbarium/what-is-a-herbarium|title=Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh - What is a herbarium|last=Edinburgh|first=Royal Botanic Garden|website=www.rbge.org.uk|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

The specimens may be whole plants or plant parts; these will usually be in dried form mounted on a sheet of paper (called "''exsiccatae''") but, depending upon the material, may also be stored in boxes or kept in alcohol or other preservative.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-12.pdf|title=Preparing and Storing Herbarium Specimens|last=|first=|date=November 2009|website=Conserve O Gram|publisher=National Park Service|access-date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specimens in a herbarium are often used as reference material in describing plant [[taxon|taxa]]; some specimens may be [[Type (botany)|types]].

The same term is often used in [[mycology]] to describe an equivalent collection of preserved [[fungi]], otherwise known as a '''fungarium'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fungarium|url=http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/collections/fungarium|website=www.kew.org|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''[[xylarium]]''' is a herbarium specialising in specimens of wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wood collection (xylarium)|url=http://www.kew.org/kew-science/collections/economic-botany/explore-collection/wood-collection-xylarium|website=www.kew.org|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''hortorium''' (as in the [[Liberty Hyde Bailey|Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium]]) has occasionally been applied to a herbarium specialising in preserving material of [[horticulture|horticultural]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium|url=https://plantbio.cals.cornell.edu/hortorium|website=plantbio.cals.cornell.edu|publisher=Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The oldest traditions of making herbarium collection or ''Hortus sicci'' have been traced to Italy. Luca Ghini and his students created herbaria of which the oldest extant one is that of [[Gherardo Cibo]] from around 1532.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1931.tb00596.x|title=The Herbal of Leonhart Fuchs|journal=Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Botany|volume=48|issue=325|pages=545|year=1931|last1=Sprague|first1=T. A.|last2=Nelmes|first2=E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most of the early herbaria were prepared with sheets bound into books, [[Carl_Linnaeus|Carolus Linnaeus]] came up with the idea of maintaining them on free sheets that allowed their easy re-ordering within cabinets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Müller-Wille|first=Staffan|date=2006-06-01|title=Linnaeus' herbarium cabinet: a piece of furniture and its function|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160932706000330|journal=Endeavour|volume=30|issue=2|pages=60–64|doi=10.1016/j.endeavour.2006.03.001|pmid=16600379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specimen preservation ==
[[File:HerbPrepLG.jpg|thumb|right|Preparing a plant for mounting]]
Commensurate with the need of wildlife conservation, it is often desirable to include in a herbarium sheet as much of the plant as possible (e.g., flowers, stems, leaves, seed, and fruit), or at least representative parts of them in the case of large specimens.&lt;ref name=Chater/&gt; To preserve their form and colour, plants collected in the field are carefully arranged and spread flat between thin sheets, known as 'flimsies', (equivalent to sheets of newsprint) and dried, usually in a [[plant press]], between blotters or absorbent paper.&lt;ref name=Chater/&gt; During the drying process the specimens are retained within their flimsies at all times to minimise damage, and only the thicker, absorbent drying sheets are replaced. For some plants it may prove helpful to allow the fresh specimen to wilt slightly before being arranged for the press. An opportunity to check, rearrange and further lay out the specimen to best reveal the required features of the plant occurs when the damp absorbent sheets are changed during the drying/pressing process.  

The specimens, which are then mounted on sheets of stiff white paper, are labelled with all essential data, such as date and place found, description of the plant, altitude, and special habitat conditions. The sheet is then placed in a protective case. As a precaution against insect attack, the pressed plant is frozen or poisoned, and the case disinfected.

Certain groups of plants are soft, bulky, or otherwise not amenable to drying and mounting on sheets. For these plants, other methods of preparation and storage may be used. For example, [[conifer cone]]s and [[Arecaceae|palm]] fronds may be stored in labelled boxes. Representative flowers or fruits may be pickled in [[formaldehyde]] to preserve their three-dimensional structure.  Small specimens, such as [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s, are often air-dried and packaged in small paper envelopes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

No matter the method of preservation, detailed information on where and when the plant was collected, habitat, color (since it may fade over time), and the name of the collector is usually included.

The value of a herbarium is much enhanced by the possession of “types”, that is, the original specimens on which the study of a species was founded. Thus the herbarium at the [[British Museum]], which is especially rich in the earlier collections made in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, contains the types of many species founded by the earlier workers in [[botany]]. It is also rich in types of Australian plants from the collections of [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] and Robert Brown, and contains in addition many valuable modern collections. &lt;ref&gt; "Herbarium", Parkstone Press International 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections management ==
[[Image:Field fg15.jpg|thumb|A large herbarium may have hundreds of cases filled with specimens.]]
Most herbaria utilize a standard system of organizing their specimens into herbarium cases.  Specimen sheets are stacked in groups by the [[species]] to which they belong and placed into a large lightweight [[File folder|folder]] that is labelled on the bottom edge. Groups of species folders are then placed together into larger, heavier folders by [[genus]]. The genus folders are then sorted by taxonomic [[family (biology)|family]] according to the standard system selected for use by the herbarium and placed into pigeonholes in herbarium cabinets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.kew.org/herbcat/gotoWhatIsHerbarium.do|title=HerbWeb - What is a Herbarium|website=apps.kew.org|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locating a specimen filed in the herbarium requires knowing the [[botanical nomenclature|nomenclature]] and [[scientific classification|classification]] used by the herbarium.  It also requires familiarity with possible name changes that have occurred since the specimen was collected, since the specimen may be filed under an older name.

Modern herbaria often maintain electronic databases of their collections. Many herbaria have initiatives to [[Digitizing|digitize]] specimens to produce a [[virtual herbarium]]. These records and images are made publicly accessible via the [[Internet]] when possible.

== Uses ==
Herbarium collections can have great significance and value to science, and have a large number of uses.&lt;ref name="Funk2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Funk|first1=Vicki|title=The Importance of Herbaria|journal=Plant Science Bulletin|date=January 2003|volume=49|issue=3|pages=94|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245183622|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Funk"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Funk|first1=Vicki|title=100 Uses for an Herbarium (Well at Least 72)|url=http://peabody.yale.edu/sites/default/files/documents/botany/100_uses.pdf|website=peabody.yale.edu|publisher=The Yale University Herbarium|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Herbaria are essential for the study of [[plant taxonomy]], the study of geographic distributions, and the stabilizing of nomenclature. 
[[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]'s herbarium now belongs to the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]] in England.

Specimens housed in herbaria may be used to catalogue or identify the [[flora]] of an area.  A large collection from a single area is used in writing a field guide or manual to aid in the identification of plants that grow there.  With more specimens available, the author of the guide will better understand the variability of form in the plants and the natural distribution over which the plants grow.

Herbaria also preserve a historical record of change in [[vegetation]] over time.  In some cases, plants become [[Extinction|extinct]] in one area or may become extinct altogether.  In such cases, specimens preserved in a herbarium can represent the only record of the plant's original distribution.  Environmental scientists make use of such data to track changes in [[climate]] and human impact.

Herbaria have also proven very useful as sources of plant [[DNA]] for use in taxonomy and [[molecular systematics]]

Many kinds of scientists and naturalists use herbaria to preserve voucher specimens; representative samples of plants used in a particular study to demonstrate precisely the source of their data, or to enable confirmation of identification at a future date.&lt;ref name="Chater"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chater|first1=Arthur O.|title=Collecting and Pressing Specimens|url=http://bsbi.org.uk/Collecting.pdf|website=www.bsbi.org.uk|publisher=Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They may also be a repository of viable seeds for rare species.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119311319/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 Wiley online library]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Iraq War documents leak''' is the disclosure to [[WikiLeaks]] of 391,832&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq War logs|url=https://wikileaks.org/irq/|accessdate=28 May 2015|publisher=WikiLeaks|date=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Army]] field reports, also called the '''Iraq War Logs''', of the [[Iraq War]] from 2004 to 2009 and published on the [[internet|Internet]] on {{Nowrap|22 October}} 2010.&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;{{cite news |title=The WikiLeaks Iraq War Logs: Greatest Data Leak in US Military History |newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=22 October 2010 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,724845,00.html |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |title=Iraq war logs: secret files show how US ignored torture |first1=Nick |last1=Davies |first2=Jonathan |last2=Steele |first3=David |last3=Leigh |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=22 October 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-military-leaks |accessdate=23 October 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AlJazeera&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks releases secret Iraq file |first=Gregg |last=Carlstrom |newspaper=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=22 October 2010 |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/secretiraqfiles/2010/10/2010102217631317837.html |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The files record [[Casualties of the Iraq War|66,081 civilian deaths out of 109,000 recorded deaths]].&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=AlJazeera /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks website publishes classified military documents from Iraq |newspaper=[[CNN]] |date=22 October 2010 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/US/10/22/wikileaks.iraq/index.html?hpt=T1 |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Enthüllung von US-Geheimdokumenten: Die Irak-Protokolle |newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=22 October 2010 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,724473,00.html |language=German |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nya dokument avslöjas från Irak-kriget |publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |date=22 October 2010 |url=http://svt.se/2.22584/1.2204694/nya_dokument_avslojas_fran_irak-kriget |language=Swedish |accessdate=23 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025091116/http://svt.se/2.22584/1.2204694/nya_dokument_avslojas_fran_irak-kriget |archivedate=25 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leak resulted in the [[Iraq Body Count project]] adding 15,000 civilian deaths to their count, bringing their total to over 150,000, with roughly 80% of those civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wikileaks: Iraq war logs increase pressure for openness |author=Paul Reynolds |newspaper=[[BBC]] |date=27 October 2010 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11613349 |accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the biggest leak in the [[military history of the United States]],&lt;ref name=spiegel /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news |title=Chemical Weapons, Iranian Agents and Massive Death Tolls Exposed in WikiLeaks’ Iraq Docs |first1=Spencer |last1=Ackerman |first2=Noah |last2=Shachtman |newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=22 October 2010 |url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/10/chemical-weapons-iranian-agents-and-massive-death-tolls-exposed-in-wikileaks-iraq-docs/ |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; surpassing the [[Afghan War documents leak]] of 25 July 2010.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks data shows U.S. failed to probe Iraqi abuse cases |first=Phil |last=Stewart |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=23 October 2010 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE69L54J20101023 |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The logs contain numerous reports of previously unknown or unconfirmed events that took place during the war.
* According to the [[Iraq Body Count project]], a sample of the deaths found in about 800 logs, extrapolated to the full set of records, shows an estimated 15,000 civilian deaths that had not been previously admitted by the US government. 66,000 civilians were reported dead in the logs, out of 109,000 deaths in total.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iraq Body Count project"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iraqbodycount.org/analysis/numbers/warlogs/ |title=Iraq War Logs: What the numbers reveal |publisher=[[Iraq Body Count project]] |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IBC has so far added a total of 3,334 of these previously unrecorded civilian deaths to its database from their ongoing analysis of the war logs. A list of these incidents, added as of 2 January 2013, has been published on the IBC website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iraqbodycount.org/analysis/numbers/2012/ "Iraqi deaths from violence in 2012" by Iraq Body Count, 1 January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iraqbodycount.org/database/incidents/list/wl2012 "Incidents added to the IBC database from the Iraq War Logs released by WikiLeaks, as of 2 January 2012" by Iraq Body Count]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that the logs show "US authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse, torture, rape and even murder by Iraqi police and soldiers"; the coalition, according to ''The Guardian'', has "a formal policy of ignoring such allegations", unless the allegations involve coalition forces.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;
* Sometimes US troops classified civilian deaths as enemy casualties. For example, the [[July 12, 2007, Baghdad airstrike]] by US helicopter gunships which killed two [[Reuters]] journalists along with several men thought to be armed suspected to be insurgents. They, including the journalists, were all listed as "enemy killed in action".&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;
* ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' said that even after the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse incident]] came to light in 2004, abuse of prisoners or detainees by Iraqi security forces continued; in one recorded case, US troops confiscated a "hand cranked generator with wire clamps" from a Baghdad police station, after a detainee claimed to have been brutalized there.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;
* One report analyzed by the [[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]] seems to show that "the US military cleared an [[Boeing AH-64 Apache|Apache]] helicopter gunship to open fire on Iraqi insurgents who were trying to surrender".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US Apache guns down surrendering insurgents |first=Angus |last=Stickler |work=iraqwarlogs.com |publisher=[[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]] |date=22 October 2010 |url=http://www.iraqwarlogs.com/2010/10/22/us-commits-%E2%80%9Cwar-crime%E2%80%9D-as-apache-helicopter-cleared-to-gun-surrendering-insurgents/ |accessdate=23 October 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to ''[[Wired Magazine]]'', "WikiLeaks may have just bolstered one of the Bush administration’s most controversial claims about the Iraq war: that Iran supplied many of the Iraq insurgency’s deadliest weapons and worked hand-in-glove with some of its most lethal militias. The documents indicate that Iran was a major combatant in the Iraq war, as its elite [[Quds Force]] trained Iraqi Shiite insurgents and imported deadly weapons like the shape-charged [[explosively formed penetrator]] bombs into Iraq for use against civilians, Sunni militants and U.S. troops."&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;
* It was reported in the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' that the documents show Iraqi operatives being trained by [[Hezbollah]] in precision military-style kidnappings. Reports also include incidents of US surveillance aircraft lost deep in Iranian territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leaks shine light on Iran’s role as backer of Iraq’s Shi’ite militias |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=23 October 2010 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2010/10/23/leaks_shine_light_on_irans_role_as_backer_of_iraqs_shiite_militias/ |accessdate=23 October 2010 |first1=Michael R. |last1=Gordon |first2=Andrew W. |last2=Lehren}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Hizbullah trained Iraqis how to kidnap soldiers' |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=23 October 2010 |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=192465 |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A number of the documents, as defined by ''[[Al Jazeera English]]'', describe how US troops killed almost 700 civilians for coming too close to checkpoints, including pregnant women and the mentally ill. At least a half-dozen incidents involved Iraqi men transporting pregnant family members to hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iraq files reveal checkpoint deaths |first=Gregg |last=Carlstrom |newspaper=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=23 October 2010 |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/secretiraqfiles/2010/10/2010102216241633174.html |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the reports contain evidence of many abuses, including civilian deaths, committed by contractors. ''The New York Times'' points out some specific reports, such as one which says "after the IED strike a witness reports the [[Blackwater Worldwide|Blackwater]] employees fired indiscriminately at the scene."&lt;ref name="ny times contractors"/&gt; In another event on 14 May 2005, an American unit "observed a Blackwater PSD shoot up a civ vehicle" killing a father and wounding his wife and daughter.&lt;ref name="ny times contractors"&gt;{{cite news |title=Use of Contractors Added to War’s Chaos in Iraq |first1=James |last1=Glanz |first2=Andrew |last2=Lehren |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=23 October 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/world/middleeast/24contractors.html?_r=1&amp;hp |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A document from December 2006, as defined by ''[[The Australian]]'', describes a plan by a Shia militia commander to kidnap US soldiers in Baghdad in late 2006 or early 2007." Also, The Australian reports that "detainee testimony" and "a captured militant's diary" are cited among the documents, in order to demonstrate "how Iran provided Iraqi militias with weapons such as rockets and lethal roadside bombs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks confirms influences on Iraq |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=25 October 2010 |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/wikileaks-confirms-influences-on-iraq/story-e6frg6so-1225942950352 |accessdate=24 October 2010 }} {{Dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the trove of documents released by WikiLeaks in October 2010 "portrays the long history of tensions between Kurds and Arabs in the north of Iraq and reveals the fears of some American units about what might happen after American troops leave the country by the end of 2011."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tensions High Along Kurdish-Arab Line |first=Michael R. |last=Gordon |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=23 October 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/world/middleeast/24kurds.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to ''[[Dagbladet Information]]'', which has been looking through the documents for information on the actions of soldiers from Denmark in Iraq, Danish soldiers "passed on responsibility for a much higher number of prisoners to Iraqi police than has previously been made public. The practice continued even though the coalition witnessed, and was continually warned of widespread torture and mistreatment of prisoners in the hands of the Iraqi police."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Danish forces involved in giving over detainees to abusive police |first=Sebastian |last=Gjerding |newspaper=[[Dagbladet Information]] |date=23 October 2010 |url=http://www.information.dk/248544 |accessdate=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An analysis published by ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' argues the leaked documents indicates a double standard in the international community views of human rights towards Israel's military policy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Analysis: Lies, leaks, death tolls &amp; statistics |first=Yaakov |last=Katz |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=29 October 2010 |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=193196 |accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to an editorial in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the leak "mainly demonstrates that the truth about Iraq 'already has been told', while it 'has at least temporarily complicated negotiations to form a new government'".  The editor also charged that "claims such as those published by the British journal The Lancet that American forces slaughtered hundreds of thousands are the real 'attack on truth.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wikileaks's leaks mostly confirm earlier Iraq reporting | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=26 October 2010 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/25/AR2010102504643.html |accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After criticism over the Afghan War documents leak, more material, including certain names and details, were redacted from these documents by WikiLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks redacted more information in latest documents release |first=Larry |last=Shaughnessy |newspaper=[[CNN]] |date=23 October 2010 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/US/10/22/wikileaks.editing/ |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

===International organizations===

*The [[United Nations|UN's]] chief investigator on torture, [[Manfred Nowak]], states that "if the files released through WikiLeaks pointed to clear violations of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] the Obama administration had an obligation to investigate them."&lt;ref name=cat&gt;{{cite news |title=Iraq war logs: UN calls on Obama to investigate human rights abuses |first1=David |last1=Batty |first2=Jamie |last2=Doward |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=23 October 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/23/united-nations-call-obama-investigation-abuses-iraq |accessdate=23 October 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention, according to Nowak, forbids the US from turning over detainees to the Iraqi government, if doing so meant they might be subjected to torture.&lt;ref name=cat /&gt;
*The UN [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Navanethem Pillay]] said that "the US and Iraq should investigate claims of abuse contained in files published on the Wikileaks website". In addition, the UN [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on Torture [[Manfred Nowak]] called "for a wider inquiry to include alleged US abuses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UN urges US and Iraq to probe Wikileaks torture claims |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=26 October 2010 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11632839 |accessdate=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Other'''
*[[NATO]]'s Secretary-General [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] stated that the release could cause "a very unfortunate situation", and that "such leaks ... may have a very negative security impact for people involved." US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also condemned the leak, saying that it "puts the lives of United States and its partners' service members and civilians at risk."&lt;ref name="guard1"/&gt; WikiLeaks dismissed these concerns.&lt;ref name=khaleej&gt;{{cite news |title=Evidence of war crimes in Iraq: WikiLeaks  |newspaper=[[Khaleej Times]] |date=23 October 2010 |url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle09.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2010/October/middleeast_October381.xml&amp;section=middleeast |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Countries===

*In preparation for the leak, the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] created an Information Review Task Force, comprising 120 people led by the Defense Intelligence Agency.&lt;ref name="guard1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Iraq war logs: disclosure condemned by Hillary Clinton and Nato |first=Amy |last=Fallon |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=22 October 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-nato-pentagon |accessdate=23 October 2010|quote=''I can't comment on the details of the exact impact on security, but in general I can tell you that such leaks ... may have a very negative security impact for people involved'' |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] said the reports were considered to be simple observations and reports by military personnel and civilian informants, but nevertheless called their release a "tragedy," and the [[US Department of Defense]] requested the return of the documents.&lt;ref name="bbc 11612731"/&gt; WikiLeaks founder [[Assange]] dismissed the Pentagon's concerns that the publication of the documents could endanger US troops and Iraqi civilians, asserting that the Pentagon "cannot find a single person that has been harmed" due to WikiLeaks’ previous release of documents related to the US-led war in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=khaleej /&gt;
*The U.S. military responded to the information in the documents about civilian deaths, saying that "it did not under-report the number of civilian deaths in the Iraq war or ignore prisoner abuse by Iraqi forces". Pentagon spokesman [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Dave Lapan added that "the U.S. military never claimed to have an exact count of the number of civilians killed in Iraq."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. says did not under-report Iraq civilian deaths |first1=Phil |last1=Stewart | first2=Andrea | last2=Shalal-Esa |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=25 October 2010 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE69L54J20101025 |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also added that both WikiLeaks and the Pentagon had the same database to collate a civilian death toll and was further sceptical WikiLeaks "made any new discovery." General George Casey, the army chief of staff, said US forces went to morgues to collect data and he did not "recall downplaying civilian casualties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2010/10/2010102623451234976.html |title=US defends Iraq record |newspaper=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=26 October 2010 |accessdate=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In response to the allegations of torture by Iraqi soldiers under US oversight, US General [[George W. Casey, Jr.|George Casey]], in command of the Iraq War between 2004 and 2007, said that "[o]ur policy all along was if American soldiers encountered prisoner abuse, to stop it and report it immediately up the US [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] and up the Iraqi chain of command."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11623828|title=US rebuffs Wikileaks Iraq torture claims|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=25 October 2010|accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Nick Clegg]] also expressed his support for an investigation into the "allegations of killings, torture and abuse" in the documents, having stated, "We can bemoan how these leaks occurred, but I think the nature of the allegations made are extraordinarily serious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wikileaks: Nick Clegg backs calls for investigation |first=Richard |last=Spencer |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=24 October 2010 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/8084116/Wikileaks-Nick-Clegg-backs-calls-for-investigation.html |accessdate=24 October 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Prime Minister of Iraq]] [[Nouri al-Maliki]] dismissed the records as politically timed smear and as a series of "media games and bubbles" as a defense against the information contained in the documents, which included "allegations [his administration] had permitted the abuse of prisoners and other misuses of power." This was echoed by Hassan al-Sneid, a "leader of Maliki's governing State of Law coalition", who stated, in terms of the images contained in the documents, "These are all just fakes from the Internet and Photoshop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks' Iraq logs put Maliki in a tight spot |first=Jack |last=Healy |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=25 October 2010 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article847328.ece |accessdate=24 October 2010 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal government of Iraq|Iraqi Government]] has stated that it plans to investigate the role of private contractors, specifically [[Blackwater Worldwide]], in deaths that occurred during the war and were revealed in the logs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baghdad to investigate role of Blackwater in deaths |first=Patrick |last=Cockburn |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=25 October 2010 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/baghdad-to-investigate-role-of-blackwater-in-deaths-2115636.html |accessdate=25 October 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Iraqi News Network stated that "The WikiLeaks documents revealed very important secrets, but the most painful among them are not those that focus on the occupier, but those that reveal what the Iraqi forces, Iraqi government and politicians did against their citizens. Those leaders who returned to remove Iraq from oppression toppled the dictator but then carried out acts that were worse than Saddam himself. If these documents make the US apologise to Iraqis, they should compel Mr Maliki to leave the political arena altogether and apologise to everyone."&lt;ref name=media-reaction&gt;{{cite news |title=Iraq war logs: media reaction around the world |first1=Martin |last1=Chulov |first2=Chris |last2=McGreal |first3=Lars |last3=Eriksen |first4=Tom |last4=Kington |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=28 October 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/28/iraq-war-logs-media-reaction |accessdate=31 October 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Iranian politician [[Mohammad-Javad Larijani]] claimed on Iranian state-owned news network [[Press TV]] on 25 October 2010 that the leaks were "made upon the order of the US", and that "The message of Wikileaks documents is that the Iraqi people have been tortured by Iraq's security forces, and the only wrongdoing of Americans is that they witnessed the incidents and remained silent.  This is while the US had the main role in these incidents and is the defendant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/148225.html |title=Iran: US behind Wikileaks revelations | publisher=[[Press TV]] |date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Spokesman for Iran's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Iran)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] Ramin Mehmanparast was quoted as saying, "Serious ambiguity and doubt linger regarding the intentions behind the suspicious release of WikiLeaks documents," and that Iran will "confront this mischievous act".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran slams 'mischievous' WikiLeaks |newspaper=[[News24]] |date=26 October 2010 |url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/Iran-slams-mischievous-WikiLeaks-20101026 |accessdate=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-government organizations===
*[[Amnesty International]] said that the actions taken by American and coalition troops in turning over prisoners from American to Iraqi custody when it was known that the prisoners were likely to be tortured may have broken international law.&lt;ref name="la times"/&gt; An Amnesty official said that the organization had "concern[s] that the U.S. authorities committed a serious breach of international law when they summarily handed over thousands of detainees to Iraqi security forces who they knew were continuing to torture and abuse detainees on a truly shocking scale."&lt;ref name="la times"&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks documents indicate U.S. forces failed to stop prisoner abuse by Iraqis |first1=David S. |last1=Cloud |first2=Ned |last2=Parker |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=23 October 2010 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-iraq-wikileaks-20101023,0,1676465.story |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other reactions===
*Retired U.S. [[General (United States)|General]] [[Stanley McChrystal]] was quoted as saying, "I think it's sad. The decision to leak classified information is something that is illegal, and individuals are making judgments about threats and information they are not qualified to make. There is a level of responsibility toward our people that needs to be balanced with a right or need to know. It's likely that a leak of that information could cause the death of our own people or some of our allies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gen.

==Media coverage==
Wikileaks made the documents available under embargo to a number of media organisations: ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Al Jazeera]]'', ''[[Le Monde]]'', the [[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]], and the [[Iraq Body Count project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Iraq war logs: nearly 400,000 files document the war on a daily basis |publisher=[[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]] |date=22 October 2010 |url=http://thebureauinvestigates.com/2010/10/22/the-iraq-war-logs/ |accessdate=31 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029220523/http://thebureauinvestigates.com/2010/10/22/the-iraq-war-logs/ |archivedate=29 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the lifting of the embargo, the media coverage by these groups was followed by further coverage by other media organisations.  ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that "the ''New York Times'', ''Washington Post'' and other papers were accused by web publications and some bloggers of downplaying the extent to which the documents revealed US complicity in torture and provided evidence that politicians in Washington "lied" about the failures of the US military mission".&lt;ref name=media-reaction /&gt; ''The Guardian'' had reported that "fresh evidence that US soldiers handed over detainees to a notorious Iraqi torture squad has emerged in army logs published by WikiLeaks",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iraq war logs: US turned over captives to Iraqi torture squads |first1=David |last1=Leigh |first2=Maggie |last2=O'Kane |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=24 October 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/24/iraq-war-logs-us-iraqi-torture |accessdate=31 October 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Glenn Greenwald]] of [[Salon.com]] commented that "media outlets around the world prominently highlighted this revelation, but not ''The New York Times''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NYT v. the world: WikiLeaks coverage |first=Glenn |last=Greenwald |newspaper=[[Salon.com]] |date=25 October 2010 |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/10/25/nyt/index.html |accessdate=31 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101222857/http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/10/25/nyt/index.html |archivedate=1 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; calling their coverage of the document leak "subservient" to the Pentagon, and criticising them for what he called a "gossipy, People Magazine-style 'profile' of Assange".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=More on the media's Pentagon-subservient WikiLeaks coverage |first=Glenn |last=Greenwald |newspaper=[[Salon.com]] |date=27 October 2010 |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/10/27/burns/index.html |accessdate=31 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030225028/http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/10/27/burns/index.html |archivedate=30 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''King Solomon's Mines''''' (1885) is a [[popular fiction|popular novel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review: ''King Solomon's Mines'' by H. Rider Haggard|journal=The Athenaeum|issue=3027|page=568|date=31 October 1885|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101077276432;view=1up;seq=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the English  [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] adventure writer and [[fable|fabulist]] Sir [[H. Rider Haggard]]. It tells of a search of an unexplored region of Africa by a group of adventurers led by [[Allan Quatermain]] for the missing brother of one of the party. It is the first English [[adventure novel]] set in Africa, and is considered to be the genesis of the [[Lost World (genre)|Lost World]] [[literary genre]].

==Background==
The book was first published in September 1885 amid considerable fanfare, with billboards and posters around London announcing "The Most Amazing Book Ever Written". It became an immediate best seller. By the late 19th century, explorers were uncovering [[ancient civilisations]] around the world, such as Egypt's [[Valley of the Kings]], and the empire of [[Assyria]]. Inner Africa remained [[European exploration of Africa|largely unexplored]] and ''King Solomon's Mines'', the first novel of African adventure published in English, captured the public's imagination.

The "[[Solomon|King Solomon]]" of the book's title is the Biblical king renowned both for his wisdom and for his wealth. A number of sites have been suggested as the location of his mines, including the workings at the [[Timna valley]] near [[Eilat]]. Research published in September 2013 has shown that this site was in use during the 10th century BC as a copper mine possibly by the [[Edomites]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-09-proof-solomon-israel.html |title=Proof of Solomon's mines found in Israel |publisher=Phys.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Proof of Solomon's mines found in Israel|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/proof-of-solomons-copper-mines-found-in-israel/2013/09/08/|accessdate=17 September 2013|newspaper=The Jewish Press|date=8 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who the Bible reports were rivals of and frequently at war with King Solomon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edom#Biblical Edom]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0006_0_05562.html |title=Edom |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boyle|first=Alan|title=Reality check on King Solomon's mines: Right era, wrong kingdom|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/reality-check-king-solomons-mines-right-era-wrong-kingdom-f8C11073742|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=NBC News|date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haggard knew Africa well, having travelled deep within the continent as a 19-year-old during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] and the [[First Boer War]], where he had been impressed by South Africa's vast mineral wealth and by the ruins of ancient lost cities being uncovered, such as [[Great Zimbabwe]]. His original Allan Quatermain character was based in large part on [[Frederick Courtney Selous]], the British [[white hunter]] and explorer of [[Colonial Africa]].&lt;ref name="mandiringana"&gt;{{Cite journal|quotes= |last=Mandiringana |first=E.  |authorlink= |author2=T.

Haggard also owed a considerable debt to [[Joseph Thomson (explorer)|Joseph Thomson]], the Scottish explorer whose book ''Through Masai Land'' was a hit in January 1885.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;!-- need source supporting "hit" --&gt; Thomson claimed he had terrified warriors in Kenya by taking out his false teeth and claiming to be a magician, just as Captain Good does in ''King Solomon's Mines''. Contemporary [[James Runciman]] wrote an article entitled ''King Plagiarism and His Court'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JVQmAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=%22king+plagiarism+and+his+court%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22king%20plagiarism%20and%20his%20court%22&amp;f=false |title=King Plagiarism and His Court |date=April 1890 |publisher=The Literary News |author=James Runciman }}&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted as accusing Haggard of plagiarism for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=545NAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA269&amp;lpg=PA269&amp;dq=%22joseph+thomson%22+plagiarism+haggard#v=onepage&amp;q=%22joseph%20thomson%22%20plagiarism%20haggard&amp;f=false |title=The Speaker |volume=1 |year=1890 |publisher=Mather &amp; Crowther}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London in And Out of Season |date=7 March 1890 |publisher=Otago Witness |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=OW18900501.2.64&amp;l=mi&amp;e=-------10--1----2-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson was so outraged at Haggard's alleged plagiarism that he published a novel of his own, ''Ulu: an African Romance'', which, however, failed to sell.

==Plot summary==
[[File:Kukuanaland.jpg|thumb|right|The way to Kukuanaland]]
[[Allan Quatermain]], an adventurer and [[white hunter]] based in [[Durban]], in what is now South Africa, is approached by aristocrat [[Sir Henry Curtis]] and his friend Captain Good, seeking his help finding Sir Henry's brother, who was last seen travelling north into the unexplored interior on a quest for the fabled King Solomon's Mines. Quatermain has a mysterious map purporting to lead to the mines, but had never taken it seriously. However, he agrees to lead an expedition in return for a share of the treasure, or a stipend for his son if he is killed along the way. He has little hope they will return alive, but reasons that he has already outlived most people in his profession, so dying in this manner at least ensures that his son will be provided for. They also take along a mysterious native, Umbopa, who seems more regal, handsome and well-spoken than most porters of his class, but who is very anxious to join the party.

Travelling by oxcart, they reach the edge of a desert, but not before a hunt in which a wounded elephant claims the life of a servant. They continue on foot across the desert, almost dying of thirst before finding the oasis shown halfway across on the map. Reaching a mountain range called Suliman Berg, they climb a peak (one of "[[Queen of Sheba|Sheba]]'s Breasts") and enter a cave where they find the frozen corpse of [[José Silvestre]] (also spelt Silvestra), the 16th-century Portuguese explorer who drew the map in his own blood. That night, a second servant dies from the cold, so they leave his body next to Silvestra's, to "give him a companion".
They cross the mountains into a raised valley, lush and green, known as Kukuanaland. The inhabitants have a well-organised army and society and speak an ancient dialect of [[IsiZulu]]. Kukuanaland's capital is Loo, the destination of a magnificent road from ancient times. The city is dominated by a central royal [[kraal]].

They soon meet a party of Kukuana warriors who are about to kill them when Captain Good nervously fidgets with his false teeth, making the Kukuanas recoil in fear. Thereafter, to protect themselves, they style themselves "white men from the stars"—sorcerer-gods—and are required to give regular proof of their divinity, considerably straining both their nerves and their ingenuity.

They are brought before King Twala, who rules over his people with ruthless violence. He came to power years before when he murdered his brother, the previous king, and drove his brother's wife and infant son, Ignosi, out into the desert to die. Twala's rule is unchallenged. An evil, impossibly ancient hag named Gagool is his chief advisor. She roots out any potential opposition by ordering regular witch hunts and murdering without trial all those identified as traitors. When she singles out Umbopa for this fate, it takes all Quatermain's skill to save his life.

Gagool, it appears, has already sensed what Umbopa soon after reveals: he is Ignosi, the rightful king of the Kukuanas. A rebellion breaks out, the Englishmen gaining support for Ignosi by taking advantage of their foreknowledge of a [[lunar eclipse]] to claim that they will black out the moon as proof of Ignosi's claim. (In early editions, this was a solar eclipse; Haggard changed it after realising that his description of a solar eclipse was not realistic&lt;ref name="owc"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) The Englishmen join Ignosi's army in a furious battle. Although outnumbered, the rebels overthrow Twala, and Sir Henry lops off his head in a duel.

The Englishmen also capture Gagool, who reluctantly leads them to King Solomon's Mines. She shows them a treasure room inside a mountain, carved deep within the [[rock-cut architecture|living rock]] and full of gold, diamonds, and ivory. She then treacherously sneaks out while they are admiring the hoard and triggers a secret mechanism that closes the mine's vast stone door. However, a brief scuffle with a beautiful Kukuana woman named Foulata—who had become attached to Good after nursing him through his injuries sustained in the battle—causes her to be crushed under the stone door, though not before fatally stabbing Foulata. Their scant store of food and water rapidly dwindling, the trapped men prepare to die also. After a few despairing days sealed in the dark chamber, they find an escape route, bringing with them a few pocketfuls of diamonds from the immense trove, enough to make them rich.

The Englishmen bid farewell to a sorrowful Ignosi and return to the desert, assuring him that they value his friendship but must return to be with their own people, Ignosi in return promising them that they will be venerated and honoured among his people forever. Taking a different route, they find Sir Henry's brother stranded in an oasis by a broken leg, unable to go forward or back. They return to Durban and eventually to England, wealthy enough to live comfortable lives.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Haggard wrote the novel as a result of a five-[[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] wager with his brother, who said that he could not write a novel half as good as [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Treasure Island]]'' (1883).&lt;ref name=bandw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/haggard.htm |title=Henry Rider Haggard |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205022814/http://kirjasto.sci.fi/haggard.htm |archivedate= 5 December 2006 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Monsman&gt;Gerald Monsman (ed.), ''King Solomon's Mines'', Broadview Press, 2002. {{ISBN|1-55111-439-9}}. [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1551114399&amp;id=WFf3SjK8J0kC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;ots=AGCXOesM67&amp;dq=%22king+solomon%27s+mines%22+%22treasure+island%22+roger+lancelyn+green&amp;sig=lkPc-EtHuI1n225MICgPIygKycc#PPA11,M1 Page 11].&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote it in a short time, somewhere between six&lt;ref name=bandw/&gt; and sixteen&lt;ref name="owc"&gt;Dennis Butts, 'Introduction' in ''King Solomon's Mines'' ed. by Dennis Butts (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. vii–xviii&lt;/ref&gt; weeks between January and 21 April 1885. However, the book was a complete novelty and was rejected by one publisher after another.  After six months, ''King Solomon's Mines'' was published, and the book became the year's best seller, with printers struggling to print copies fast enough.&lt;ref name=Monsman/&gt;

In the process, ''King Solomon's Mines'' created a new genre known as the "[[Lost World (genre)|Lost World]]", which would inspire [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' ''[[The Land That Time Forgot (novel)|The Land That Time Forgot]]'', [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'', [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Man Who Would Be King]]''&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Morsberger, "Afterword" in ''King Solomon's Mines'' ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' edition 1994. {{ISBN|0-89577-553-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]''. [[Lee Falk]]'s ''[[The Phantom]]'' was initially written in this genre. A much later Lost World novel was [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[Congo (novel)|Congo]]'', which involves a quest for King Solomon's lost mines, supposedly located in a lost African city called [[Congo (novel)|Zinj]].

As in ''Treasure Island'', the narrator of ''King Solomon's Mines'' tells his tale in the first person in an easy conversational style. Almost entirely missing (except in the speech of the Kukuanas) is the ornate language usually associated with novels of this era. Haggard's use of the first person subjective perspective also contrasts with the omniscient third-person viewpoint then in vogue among influential writers such as [[Anthony Trollope]], [[Thomas Hardy]], and [[George Eliot]].

The book has scholarly value for the [[colonialism|colonialist]] attitudes that Haggard expresses,&lt;ref&gt;Etheridge, ibid., pp. 91–106&lt;/ref&gt; and for the way that he portrays the relationships between the white and African characters. Haggard portrays some African characters as barbarians, such as Twala and Gagool, but their barbarity has more to do with their roles as antagonists in the story than with their African heritage. He also presents the other side of the coin, showing some black Africans as heroes and heroines (such as Ignosi), and showing respect for their culture. The book expresses much less prejudice than some of the later books in this genre. Indeed, Quatermain states that he refuses to use the word "nigger" and that many Africans are more worthy of the title of "gentleman" than the Europeans who settle or adventure in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2166/2166-h/2166-h.htm#chap01 |title=The Project Gutenberg E-text of King Solomon's Mines, by H. Rider Haggard |website=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haggard even includes an interracial romance between a Kukuana woman, Foulata, and the white Englishman Captain Good. The narrator tries to discourage the relationship, dreading the uproar that such a marriage would cause back home in England; however, he has no objection to the lady, whom he considers very beautiful and noble. Haggard eventually kills off Foulata, who dies in Good's arms.

Kukuanaland is said in the book to be forty [[League (unit)|leagues]] north of the [[Kafue River|Lukanga river]] in modern Zambia, which would place it in the extreme southeast of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. The culture of the Kukuanas shares many attributes with other South African tribes, such as [[Zulu language|Zulu]] being spoken and the [[kraal]] system being used.

==Adaptations in other media==
===Films===
The novel has been adapted to film [[King Solomon's Mines (film)|at least six times]]. The first version premiered in 1937, ''[[King Solomon's Mines (1937 film)|King Solomon's Mines]]'', and was directed by [[Robert Stevenson (director)|Robert Stevenson]]. The best known version premiered in 1950, ''[[King Solomon's Mines (1950 film)|King Solomon's Mines]]'', directed by [[Compton Bennett]] and [[Andrew Marton]], which was followed by a sequel, ''[[Watusi (film)|Watusi]]'' (1959). In 1979 a low-budget version was directed by [[Alvin Rakoff]], ''[[King Solomon's Treasure]]'', combining both ''King Solomon's Mines'' as well as ''[[Allan Quatermain]]'' in one story. The 1985 film, ''[[King Solomon's Mines (1985 film)|King Solomon's Mines]]'', was a more tongue-in-cheek parody of the story, followed by a sequel in the same vein: ''[[Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold]]'' (1987). Around the same period an Australian animated TV film came out, ''[[King Solomon's Mines (1986 telemovie)|King Solomon's Mines]]''. In December 2006, the movie, “[[The Librarian: Return to King Solomon’s Mines]]” was released as the second in a trilogy that follows one man’s fantastical adventures. In 2008 a direct-to-video adaptation, ''[[Allan Quatermain and the Temple of Skulls]]'' was released by [[Mark Atkins (director)|Mark Atkins]], which bore more resemblance to [[Indiana Jones]] than the novel.

===Comics===
British comics artist [[Dudley D. Watkins]] adapted the story into a [[text comics]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/watkins_dudley.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222152413/https://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/watkins_dudley.htm |archivedate=22 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television programs===
In 2002 a documentary was made by National Geographic Television in collaboration with Channel 4 in the UK: ''[[The Search for King Solomon's Mines]]''.

In 2004 a TV mini-series was created: ''[[King Solomon's Mines (2004 film)|King Solomon's Mines]]''.

===Radio===
[[Kenneth Colley]] starred as Allan Quatermain in a 1990 [[BBC Radio 4]] adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonelms.org.uk/saturday-playhouse.html |title=radio plays, drama, BBC, Saturday Playhouse, 1990-1998, DIVERSITY website |website=Suttonelms.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A two-part [[BBC Radio 4]] adaptation was broadcast in April 2017 starring [[Tim McInnerny]] as Allan Quatermain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08lljv3 |title=BBC Radio 4 - Drama, King Solomon's Mines |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Liber Pontificalis''''' ([[Latin]] for 'pontifical book' or ''Book of the Popes'') is a book of [[biography|biographies]] of [[pope]]s from [[Saint Peter]] until the 15th century. The original publication of the ''Liber Pontificalis'' stopped with [[Pope Adrian II]] (867–872) or [[Pope Stephen V]] (885–891),&lt;ref name="levillain"/&gt; but it was later supplemented in a different style until [[Pope Eugene IV]] (1431–1447) and then [[Pope Pius II]] (1458–1464).&lt;ref name="catholic"&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Liber Pontificalis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although quoted virtually uncritically from the 8th to 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, 2006, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Liber Pontificalis'' has undergone intense modern scholarly scrutiny. The work of the French priest [[Louis Duchesne]] (who compiled the major scholarly edition), and of others has highlighted some of the underlying redactional motivations of different sections, though such interests are so disparate and varied as to render improbable one popularizer's claim that it is an "unofficial instrument of pontifical propaganda."&lt;ref name="levillain"/&gt;

The title ''Liber Pontificalis'' goes back to the 12th century, although it only became current in the 15th century, and the canonical title of the work since the edition of Duchesne in the 19th century. In the earliest extant manuscripts it is referred to as '''''Liber episcopalis in quo continentur acta beatorum pontificum Urbis Romae''''' ('episcopal book in which are contained the acts of the blessed pontiffs of the city of Rome') and later the '''''Gesta''''' or '''''Chronica pontificum'''''.&lt;ref name="levillain"&gt;Levillain, Philippe. 2002. ''The Papacy: An Encyclopedia''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-92228-3}}. p. 941.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
[[Image:Raban-Maur Alcuin Otgar.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rabanus Maurus]] (left) was the first to attribute the ''Liber Pontificalis'' to [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]].]]
During the Middle Ages, [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]] was considered the author of all the biographies up until those of [[Pope Damasus I]] (366–383), based on an [[apocrypha]]l letter between Saint Jerome and Pope Damasus published as a preface to the Medieval manuscripts.&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt; The attribution originated with [[Rabanus Maurus]] and is repeated by [[Martin of Opava]], who extended the work into the 13th century.&lt;ref name="levillain"/&gt;  Other sources attribute the early work to [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]] and [[Irenaeus]], having been continued by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]].&lt;ref name="tuker"/&gt;
[[Image:Martin von Troppau.PNG|thumb|left|[[Martin of Opava]] continued the ''Liber Pontificalis'' into the 13th century.]]
In the 16th century, [[Onofrio Panvinio]] attributed the biographies after Damasus until [[Pope Nicholas I]] (858–867) to [[Anastasius Bibliothecarius]]; Anastasius continued to be cited as the author into the 17th century, although this attribution was disputed by the scholarship of [[Caesar Baronius]], [[Ciampini]], [[Schelstrate]] and others.&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt;
[[Image:Eusebius of Caesarea.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eusebius of Caesarea]] may have continued the ''Liber Pontificalis'' into the 4th century.]]
The modern interpretation, following that of [[Louis Duchesne]], is that the ''Liber Pontificalis'' was gradually and unsystematically compiled, and that the authorship is impossible to determine, with a few exceptions (e.g. the biography of [[Pope Stephen II]] (752–757) to papal "Primicerius" Christopher; the biographies of Pope Nicholas I and [[Pope Adrian II]] (867–872) to Anastasius).&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt; Duchesne and others have viewed the beginning of the ''Liber Pontificalis'' up until the biographies of [[Pope Felix III]] (483–492) as the work of a single author, who was a contemporary of [[Pope Anastasius II]] (496-498), relying on ''[[Liberian Catalogue|Catalogus Liberianus]]'', which in turn draws from the papal catalogue of [[Hippolytus of Rome]],&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt; and the ''[[Leonine Catalogue]]'', which is no longer extant.&lt;ref&gt;Lightfoot, Joseph Barber. 1890. ''The Apostolic Fathers: A Revised Text with Introductions, Notes, Dissertations, and Translations''. Macmillan. p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars believe the ''Liber Pontificalis'' was first compiled in the 5th or 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lightfoot, 1890, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the use of the ''[[vestiarium]]'', the records of the [[Apostolic Camera|papal treasury]], some have hypothesized that the author of the early ''Liber Pontificalis'' was a clerk of the papal treasury.&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt; [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1788) summarised the scholarly consensus as being that the ''Liber Pontificalis'' was composed by "apostolic librarians and notaries of the viii&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and ix&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries" with only the most recent portion being composed by Anastasius.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon, Edward]]. 1788. ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''. Vol V. Chapter XLIX. Note 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchesne and others believe that the author of the first addition to the ''Liber Pontificalis'' was a contemporary of [[Pope Silverius]] (536–537), and that the author of another (not necessarily the second) addition was a contemporary of [[Pope Conon]] (686–687), with later popes being added individually and during their reigns or shortly after their deaths.&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt;

==Content==
The ''Liber Pontificalis'' originally only contained the names of the bishops of Rome and the durations of their pontificates.&lt;ref name="tuker"&gt;Tuker, Mildred Anna Rosalie, and Malleson, Hope. 1899. ''Handbook to Christian and Ecclesiastical Rome''. A. and C. Black. pp. 559-560.&lt;/ref&gt; As enlarged in the 6th century, each biography consists of: the birth name of the pope and that of his father, place of birth, profession before elevation, length of pontificate, historical notes of varying thoroughness, major theological pronouncements and decrees, administrative milestones (including building campaigns, especially of [[Rome|Roman]] [[Church (building)|churches]]), [[ordination]]s, date of death, place of burial, and the duration of the ensuing ''[[sede vacante]]''.&lt;ref name="levillain"/&gt;

[[Pope Adrian II]] (867–872) is the last pope for which there are extant manuscripts of the original ''Liber Pontificalis'': the biographies of [[Pope John VIII]], [[Pope Marinus I]], and [[Pope Adrian III]] are missing and the biography of [[Pope Stephen V]] (885–891) is incomplete. From Stephen V through the 10th and 11th centuries, the historical notes are extremely abbreviated, usually with only the pope's origin and reign duration.&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt;

==Extension==
It was only in the 12th century that the ''Liber Pontificalis'' was systematically continued, although papal biographies exist in the interim period in other sources.&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt;

===Petrus Guillermi===
Duchesne refers to the 12th century work by [[Petrus Guillermi]] in 1142 at the [[monastery of St. Gilles]] ([[Diocese of Reims]]) as the ''Liber Pontificalis of Petrus Guillermi (son of William)''.&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt; Guillermi's version is mostly copied from other works with small additions or excisions from the papal biographies of Pandulf, nephew of [[Hugo of Alatri]], which in turn was copied almost verbatim from the original ''Liber Pontificalis'' (with the notable exception of the biography of [[Pope Leo IX]]), then from other sources until [[Pope Honorius II]] (1124–1130), and with contemporary information from [[Pope Paschal II]] (1099–1118) to [[Pope Urban II]] (1088–1099).&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt;

Duchesne attributes all biographies from [[Pope Gregory VII]] to Urban II to [[Pandolfo da Lucca|Pandulf]],&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt; while earlier historians like [[Giesebrecht]]&lt;ref&gt;"Allgemeine Monatsschrift", Halle, 1852, 260 sqq.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Watterich]]&lt;ref&gt;Romanorum Pontificum vitæ, I, LXVIII sqq.&lt;/ref&gt; attributed the biographies of Gregory VII, Victor III, and Urban II to [[Cardinal Petrus Pisanus|Petrus Pisanus]], and the subsequent biographies to Pandulf. These biographies until those of [[Pope Martin IV]] (1281–1285) are extant only as revised by Petrus Guillermi in the manuscripts of the monastery of St. Gilles having been taken from the Chronicle of [[Martin of Opava]].&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt;

Early in the 14th century, an unknown author built upon the continuation of Petrus Guillermi, adding the biographies of popes [[Pope Martin IV|Martin IV]] (d. 1285) through [[Pope John XXII|John XXII]] (1316–1334), with information taken from the "[[Chronicon Pontificum]]" of [[Bernard Gui|Bernardus Guidonis]], stopping abruptly in 1328.&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt;

===Boso===
Independently, the [[cardinal-nephew]] of [[Pope Adrian IV]], [[Boso Breakspeare|Cardinal Boso]] intended to extend the ''Liber Pontificalis'' from where it left off with Stephen V, although his work was only published posthumously as the ''[[Gesta Romanorum Pontificum]]'' alongside the ''[[Liber Censuum]]'' of [[Pope Honorius III]]. Boso drew on [[Bonizo of Sutri]] for popes from [[Pope John XII|John XII]] to [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], and wrote from his own experiences about the popes from [[Pope Gelasius II|Gelasius II]] (1118–1119) to [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]] (1179–1181).&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt;

===Western Schism===
An independent continuation appeared in the reign of [[Pope Eugene IV]] (1431–1447), appending biographies from [[Pope Urban V]] (1362–1370) to [[Pope Martin V]] (1417–1431), encompassing the period of the [[Western Schism]]. A later recension of this continuation was expanded under [[Pope Eugene IV]].&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt;

===15th century===
The two collections of papal biographies of the 15th century remain independent, although they may have been intended to be continuations of the ''Liber Pontificalis''. The first extends from popes [[Pope Benedict XII|Benedict XII]] (1334–1342) to [[Pope Martin V|Martin V]] (1417–1431), or in one manuscript to [[Pope Eugene IV|Eugene IV]] (1431–1447). The second extends from [[Pope Urban VI]] (1378–1389) to [[Pope Pius II]] (1458–1464).&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt;

==Editions==
[[Image:Theodor Mommsen by Ludwig Knaus (1881).jpg|thumb|right|[[Theodor Mommsen]]'s 1898 edition of the ''Liber Pontificalis'' terminates in 715.]]
The ''Liber Pontificalis'' was [[editio princeps|first edited]] by J. Busæus under the title ''Anastasii bibliothecarii Vitæ seu Gesta. Romanorum Pontificum'' (Mainz, 1602). A new edition, including the ''[[Historia Ecclesiastica (disambiguation)|Historia ecclesiastica]]'' of Anastasius, was edited by Fabrotti (Paris, l647). Another edition, editing the older ''Liber Pontificalis'' up to [[Pope Adrian II]] and adding [[Pope Stephen VI]], was compiled by Fr. Bianchini (4 vols., Rome, 1718–35; a projected fifth volume did not appear).&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt; Muratori reprinted Bianchini's edition, adding the remaining popes through [[Pope John XXII|John XXII]] (Scriptores rerum Italicarum, III). Migne also republished Bianchini's edition, adding several appendixes (P. L., CXXVII-VIII).&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt;

Modern editions include those of [[Louis Duchesne]] (''Liber Pontificalis. Texte, introduction et commentaire'', 2 vols., Paris, 1886–92) and [[Theodor Mommsen]] (''Gestorum Pontificum Romanorum pars I: Liber Pontificalis'', [[Mon. Germ. hist.]], Berlin, 1898). Duchesne incorporates the ''[[Annales Romani]]'' (1044–1187) into his edition of the ''Liber Pontificalis'', which otherwise relies on the two earliest known recensions of the work (530 and 687).&lt;ref name="tuker"/&gt; Mommsen's edition is incomplete, extending only until 715.&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt; Translations and further commentaries appeared throughout the 20th century.

The '''Maritime Museum of the Atlantic''' is a [[maritime museum]] located in [[Downtown Halifax|downtown]] [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], Canada.

The museum is a member institution of the [[Nova Scotia Museum]] and is the oldest and largest maritime museum in Canada with a collection of over 30,000 artifacts including 70 small craft and a [[steamship]]: the [[CSS Acadia|CSS ''Acadia'']], a 180-foot steam-powered hydrographic survey ship launched in 1913.

==History==

The museum was founded in 1948. It was first known as the Maritime Museum of Canada and located at [[CFB Halifax|HMC Dockyard]], the naval base on Halifax Harbour.  Several naval officers served as volunteer chairs of the museum until 1959 when [[Niels Jannasch]] was hired as the museum's founding director, serving until 1985. The museum moved through several locations over the next three decades before its current building was constructed in 1981 as part of a waterfront redevelopment program.  The museum received the CSS ''Acadia'' in 1982.  Today the museum is part of the Nova Scotia Museum system.

==Location==
[[File:Maritime_Museum_of_the_Atlantic_9-04-04.JPG|thumb|right|The waterfront side to the museum]]

The museum was one of the first attractions to open on the redeveloped [[Halifax Boardwalk|Halifax Waterfront]]. Its location provides the museum with several piers and boatsheds, as well as a strategic view of the [[Halifax Harbour]] looking seaward towards the [[Harbourmaster]] office and [[Georges Island (Nova Scotia)|Georges Island]] and across to [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]]. Among its facilities is the restored 1880s Robertson Store [[ship chandler]] building, as well as modern exhibit galleries in the Devonian Wing (the modern museum building). [[HMCS Sackville (K181)|HMCS ''Sackville'']], a [[World War II]] Flower-class [[corvette]] is docked adjacent to the museum in the summer months but is not owned or administered by the museum.

==Collection==
In addition to the over 30,000 artifacts, the museum also has a collection of 30,000 photographs as well as a large collection of charts and rare books. A reference library, open to the public, is named after the Museum's founding director, The [[Niels Jannasch]] Library. The museum has Canada's largest collection of ship portraits including the oldest ship portrait in Canada as well as a large collection of [[ship model]]s including the original production models of the television show [[Theodore Tugboat]]. Ongoing restoration of ''Whim'', a 1937 C-Class sloop can be found in one of the boatsheds on the wharf behind the museum.  In addition to this current restoration project, the boatsheds house some of the museum's small craft collection. During the summer months three boats in the working small craft collection can be found moored next to the CSS ''Acadia''. In July 2017 the museum also completed restoration of the small schooner Hebridee II.

==Exhibits==
[[File:NorwegianNavyMemorial.jpg|thumb|150px|Norwegian Memorial beside the museum]]
Public galleries include the Days of Sail, the Age of Steam, Small Craft, the Canadian Navy, the [[Halifax Explosion]], and Shipwrecks. A special permanent exhibit explores the sinking of [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] with an emphasis on Nova Scotia's connection to recovering the bodies of ''Titanic'' victims. The museum has the world's foremost collection of wooden artifacts from ''Titanic'', including one of the few surviving [[deck chair]]s. The ''Titanic'' exhibit also includes a child's pair of shoes which helped identify ''Titanic''{{'}}s "unknown child" as [[Sidney Leslie Goodwin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/history/titanic-unknown-child-identified-110426.html "Titanic's Unknown Child Identified"], Discovery Channel News, April 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The adjacent exhibit "Shipwreck Treasures of Nova Scotia" explores the many other shipwrecks off the coast of Nova Scotia including archaeological discoveries on naval shipwrecks in [[Louisbourg]] Harbour and an unknown 1750s schooner at [[Lower Prospect, Nova Scotia]]. The results of treasure hunting are also featured in a section on Cape Breton treasure wrecks which has displays of weapons, instruments, gold and silver from wrecks such as the 1711 [[HMS Feversham|HMS ''Feversham'']], the 1725 wreck of [[French ship Chameau|''Chameau'']] and the 1761 wreck of the ship [[Auguste (ship)|''Auguste'']].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Marsters, ''Shipwreck Treasures of Nova Scotia: Disaster and Discovery on Canada's East Coast'', Formac Publishing Halifax (2002), pp. 26–27, 40, 44&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Age of Steam gallery includes a special display on [[Samuel Cunard]], the Nova Scotian who created the [[Cunard Line]]. The restored 1880s Robertson building includes the fully restored Robertson [[ship chandler]]ly which features hands on foghorns, ropes and ship fittings.

The Navy gallery includes the "Convoy Exhibit" about the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] which includes the [[Canadian Merchant Navy]] Book of Remembrance.  Monuments to the Canadian and Norwegian Merchant Navy are located just outside the museum along with a unique children's playground in the shape of a submarine.

The museum also has a changing exhibits gallery.  A 2009 exhibit ''Ship of Fate: The Tragic Voyage of the St. Louis'' was the first Canadian exhibit to explore the 1939 voyage of the Jewish refugee ship {{MS|St. Louis||6}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.ns.ca/news/details.asp?id=20091105005 "Maritime Museum Exhibit on Tragic Voyage of MS St. Louis", November 5, 2010, Nova Scotia Government Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Museum became the first museum in North America to present an exhibit about the lives of gay seafarers in 2011 when it presented ''Hello Sailor: Gay Life on the Ocean Waves'', adapted from an exhibit developed at the [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]] in [[Liverpool]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110705001800/http://www.halifaxnewsnet.ca/Entertainment/2011-05-18/article-2516312/Museum-marks-a-first-with-Hello-Sailor%21-exhibit-/1 "Museum Marks a First with Hello Sailor Exhibit", ''Halifax News Net'' May 18, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2012 exhibit explores the experiences of the [[Cable layer|cable ships]] based in Halifax who recovered most of the victims of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] sinking.

==Event location==
[[File:Symphony Nova Scotia performs at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic.jpg|thumb|[[Symphony Nova Scotia]] performs at the Museum's Small Craft Gallery]]

The museum's location on the Halifax waterfront has made the Museum the site of several significant public events. In addition to being a stop on most Canadian federal election campaigns, the museum hosted meetings from the [[21st G7 summit|1995 G7 Summit]], as well a September 11 commemorative event in 2006 attended by [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)|Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Peter MacKay]] and [[United States Secretary of State]], [[Condoleezza Rice]].  The Museum hosts an annual commemoration of the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] on the first Sunday of every May and [[Canadian Merchant Navy]] day every September 3.

In '''''Minister of Safety and Security v Xaba''''' (2003), an important case in [[South Africa]]n [[Criminal procedure in South Africa|criminal procedure]], a bullet was lodged in Xaba's thigh. The Minister wanted to remove it, as the police believed that the bullet would connect X to the crime of a [[Carjacking|motor-vehicle hijacking]].

The court held that section 12 of the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]], enshrining the right to dignity, would be unjustifiably infringed if it ordered such a removal.

The court further held that the word "search," when used in the context of the powers of [[search and seizure]], does not include an operation under [[general anaesthetic]]. Even if it did, police could not delegate this power (or the right to use reasonable force in terms of section 27) to a doctor.

Furthermore, the court held that section 37(1)(c) does not intend to allow a police official to empower a medical practitioner to perform an operation; only limited [[surgery]] associated with the taking of a blood sample is allowed thereby.

'''''More Letters of Charles Darwin''''', a sequel to ''[[The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin]]'' of 1887, was a book in two volumes, published in 1903, edited by [[Francis Darwin]] and [[A. C. Seward]], containing as the title implies, additional publications of 782 letters from the [[correspondence of Charles Darwin]].

''[[The Times]]'' noted that "the two volumes of ''More Letters of Charles Darwin'' form a fitting supplement to ''The Life and Letters''", which it had in turn described as "one of the best biographies ever written".&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Monday, Sep 21, 1925; pg. 14; Issue 44072; col D&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Darwin letters trilogy it was followed by ''[[Emma Darwin: A Century of Family Letters]]'' (1905/1915)

[[R. B. Freeman]] noted that it "contains almost entirely new matter although some extracts and a few whole letters are also found in Life and letters. It also contains a brief autobiographical piece (pp. 1-5) which is sometimes found in modern editions and translations of his main autobiography."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_MoreLetters.html|title=Darwin Online: More Letters|work=darwin-online.org.uk|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is dedicated "with affection and respect, to [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] in remembrance of his lifelong friendship with [[Charles Darwin]]".

It contains a timeline of Darwin's life.

The [[Darwin Correspondence Project]] has further letters available, many published online.

== Lawsuits ==
Nearly all materials in the New York City Municipal Archives are subject to the New York State [[Freedom of Information Law]] (FOIL), and copies of almost any document or microfilm can be requested by any member of the public. In 2015, a genealogist brought an "Article 78" lawsuit against the Archives in the Supreme Court of New York under FOIL, after her request to purchase copies of 48 rolls of microfilmed records was denied. The Archives attempted to claim that its holdings were not legally subject to FOIL, which was then disputed in a published Advisory Opinion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advisory Opinion # F19289|url=https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/F19289.pdf|website=Committee on Open Government|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the New York State Committee on Open Government (COOG), a statewide FOIL watchdog group funded by the state legislature. The Archives finally admitted its coverage and settled the lawsuit in September 2015, providing all the copies to the genealogist. That lawsuit, ''Brooke Schreier Ganz, et al, v. The City of New York, No. 101643/2015 [Sup Ct, NY Cnty]'', led to the founding of the national non-profit activist group [[Reclaim The Records]].

The '''Piraeus Athena''' is a [[bronze]] statue dated to the fourth century BCE. It currently resides in the [[Archaeological Museum of Piraeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pedley, John Griffiths, Greek art and archaeology. (Upper Saddle River, N.J., 2012). p.306&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The Piraeus Athena was discovered in 1959, by workers who were drilling underground to install pipes. Bronze was first hit 1.5 meters below the ground; a few days later, they uncovered the statue at the intersection of Georgiou I Street and Philonos Street. The excavation of the statue was led by Efthymios Mastrokostas. The Piraeus Athena was found with three more large bronze statues, along with other artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauer, Georgios, “The Piraeus bronze statues,” in Valavanis, Panos [et.al], Great Moments in Greek Archaeology. (Los Angeles, 2007). p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; The Piraeus Athena was discovered in very good condition; however, it underwent irreparable damage after being abandoned on the damp floor of the Piraeus Museum according to the scholar, Steinhauer.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauer, Georgios, “The Piraeus bronze statues,” in Valavanis, Panos [et.al], Great Moments in Greek Archaeology. (Los Angeles, 2007). p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and dating==
There are various theories about the origins of the Piraeus Athena. Because the room the statue was found in was very close to the main harbor,&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauer, Georgios, “The Piraeus bronze statues,” in Valavanis, Panos [et.al], Great Moments in Greek Archaeology. (Los Angeles, 2007). p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; many scholars believe that the statue had been stored in a harbor’s [[stoa]] and were just about to be shipped.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauer, Georgios, “The Piraeus bronze statues,” in Valavanis, Panos [et.al], Great Moments in Greek Archaeology. (Los Angeles, 2007). p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Piraeus Athena and other statues were not in random order but seemed to be packed.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauer, Georgios, “The Piraeus bronze statues,” in Valavanis, Panos [et.al], Great Moments in Greek Archaeology. (Los Angeles, 2007). p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; A coin found near the statues had a date equivalent to 87/86 BC on it, along with a picture of King Mithridates VI.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauer, Georgios, “The Piraeus bronze statues,” in Valavanis, Panos [et.al], Great Moments in Greek Archaeology. (Los Angeles, 2007). p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is known that Piraeus was captured by Sulla in 86 BC, many have further speculated two theories.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauer, Georgios, “The Piraeus bronze statues,” in Valavanis, Panos [et.al], Great Moments in Greek Archaeology. (Los Angeles, 2007). p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; One theory is that the statues were going to be shipped in order to save them from the Roman attack.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauer, Georgios, “The Piraeus bronze statues,” in Valavanis, Panos [et.al], Great Moments in Greek Archaeology. (Los Angeles, 2007). p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; The second theory is that the statues were being shipped by the Romans to Italy as part of their spoils.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauer, Georgios, “The Piraeus bronze statues,” in Valavanis, Panos [et.al], Great Moments in Greek Archaeology. (Los Angeles, 2007). p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that the statue may have originally come from the sanctuary of Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira in Piraeus.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauer, Georgios, “The Piraeus bronze statues,” in Valavanis, Panos [et.al], Great Moments in Greek Archaeology. (Los Angeles, 2007). p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the peplos in the statue is similar to the drapery of the peplos in the statue of Eirene by [[Cephisodotus the Elder]], who was also known to have made a statue of Athena that resided in the sanctuary of Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauer, Georgios, “The Piraeus bronze statues,” in Valavanis, Panos [et.al], Great Moments in Greek Archaeology. (Los Angeles, 2007). p. 330&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waywell, G. B., “Athena mattei,” in The Annual of the British School at Athens 66. (1971). p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars believe that the statue may have come from [[Delos]], since three of the statues found with the Piraeus Athena were of Artemis, and Delos was considered the birthplace of Artemis.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauer, Georgios, “The Piraeus bronze statues,” in Valavanis, Panos [et.al], Great Moments in Greek Archaeology. (Los Angeles, 2007). p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Delos (Site),” in Perseus Digital Library Tufts University, (2014). &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Delos&amp;object=site&gt;. p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Romans had captured Delos in 88 BC and therefore the statues could have been part of the scared funds Mithradates’ general had sent to Delos.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauer, Georgios, “The Piraeus bronze statues,” in Valavanis, Panos [et.al], Great Moments in Greek Archaeology. (Los Angeles, 2007). p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the dating, it has been estimated that the Piraeus Athena probably dates back to 360-340 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;“Piraeus Athena (Sculpture),” in Perseus Digital Library Tufts University, (2014). &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact;jsessionid=11BC2A7C671270C807E2C9C6CA2ECED9?name=Piraeus+Athena&amp;object=Sculpture&gt;. p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and representation==
It is over-life sized, with a height of 2.35 meters (approximately 8 feet).&lt;ref&gt;Pedley, John Griffiths, Greek art and archaeology. (Upper Saddle River, N.J., 2012). p.306&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
“Piraeus Athena (Sculpture),” in Perseus Digital Library Tufts University, (2014). &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact;jsessionid=11BC2A7C671270C807E2C9C6CA2ECED9?name=Piraeus+Athena&amp;object=Sculpture &gt;. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; It is identified as a cult statue.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauer, Georgios, “The Piraeus bronze statues,” in Valavanis, Panos [et.al], Great Moments in Greek Archaeology. (Los Angeles, 2007). p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

Athena is wearing a [[peplos]] that is open on the right side.&lt;ref&gt;
“Piraeus Athena (Sculpture),” in Perseus Digital Library Tufts University, (2014). &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact;jsessionid=11BC2A7C671270C807E2C9C6CA2ECED9?name=Piraeus+Athena&amp;object=Sculpture &gt;. 
p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The cloth of the peplos appears heavy, as evidenced from the deep cloth lines in the sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Neer, Richard T., Greek Art and Archaeology: A new history, c.2500 - c.150 BCE. (New York, 2012). p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy material hints that the statue was not from early in the fourth century, but probably towards the middle, since earlier in the fourth century, luxurious transparent cloth was the style.&lt;ref&gt;Pedley, John Griffiths, Greek art and archaeology. (Upper Saddle River, N.J., 2012). p.306&lt;/ref&gt; Here, on the other hand, we see Athena wearing a peplos made from thick cloth that became fashionable later during the fourth century, according to the scholar, John Pedley.&lt;ref&gt;Pedley, John Griffiths, Greek art and archaeology. (Upper Saddle River, N.J., 2012). p.306&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy cloth is also noted to re-emphasize her physical presence.&lt;ref&gt;Neer, Richard T., Greek Art and Archaeology: A new history, c.2500 - c.150 BCE. (New York, 2012). p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

The Piraeus Athena is often mentioned to seem approachable by the scholar, Neer. This serves as a stark contrast from the Archaic style, where gods were often depicted as stern according to Neer&lt;ref&gt;Neer, Richard T., Greek Art and Archaeology: A new history, c.2500 - c.150 BCE. (New York, 2012). p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; One reason Athena here is perceived approachable is due to her stance. The Piraeus Athena, here is in [[contrapposto]] stance, meaning that her left leg is more relaxed, while she is putting her weight on the right leg.&lt;ref&gt;“Piraeus Athena (Sculpture),” in Perseus Digital Library Tufts University, (2014). &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact;jsessionid=11BC2A7C671270C807E2C9C6CA2ECED9?name=Piraeus+Athena&amp;object=Sculpture &gt;. p.1&lt;/ref&gt; This position portrays the idea that she is almost stooping towards the mortal viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Neer, Richard T., Greek Art and Archaeology: A new history, c.2500 - c.150 BCE. (New York, 2012). p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; The passive and gentle expression on her face is also denoted with an air of approachability according.&lt;ref&gt;Neer, Richard T., Greek Art and Archaeology: A new history, c.2500 - c.150 BCE. (New York, 2012). p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

Athena is shown to have an [[aegis]] diagonally across her peplos in the sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;“Piraeus Athena (Sculpture),” in Perseus Digital Library Tufts University, (2014). &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact;jsessionid=11BC2A7C671270C807E2C9C6CA2ECED9?name=Piraeus+Athena&amp;object=Sculpture &gt;. 
p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The aegis has a miniature [[Gorgon]]'s head on it along with a border of snakes.&lt;ref&gt;“Piraeus Athena (Sculpture),” in Perseus Digital Library Tufts University, (2014). &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact;jsessionid=11BC2A7C671270C807E2C9C6CA2ECED9?name=Piraeus+Athena&amp;object=Sculpture &gt;. p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Its small dimensions make it to be more like a marker of Athena’s identity than an actual piece of armament.&lt;ref&gt;
“Piraeus Athena (Sculpture),” in Perseus Digital Library Tufts University, (2014). &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact;jsessionid=11BC2A7C671270C807E2C9C6CA2ECED9?name=Piraeus+Athena&amp;object=Sculpture &gt;. p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The diagonal positioning of the aegis is seen to give Athena a swaying motion — some say in order to have the viewer’s eye look towards what Athena was holding in her right hand.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauer, Georgios, “The Piraeus bronze statues,” in Valavanis, Panos [et.al], Great Moments in Greek Archaeology. (Los Angeles, 2007). p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; There is a hole in the palm of the right hand and the right thumb indicating that Athena was originally holding an item, but that item's identity it is not certain. Some suggest it might have been an owl or the representation of victory, [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]].&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauer, Georgios, “The Piraeus bronze statues,” in Valavanis, Panos [et.al], Great Moments in Greek Archaeology. (Los Angeles, 2007). p. 330&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Piraeus Athena (Sculpture),” in Perseus Digital Library Tufts University, (2014). &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact;jsessionid=11BC2A7C671270C807E2C9C6CA2ECED9?name=Piraeus+Athena&amp;object=Sculpture &gt;. 
p.1&lt;/ref&gt; It is also thought that Athena may have held in her left hand a spear or a shield.&lt;ref&gt;“Piraeus Athena (Sculpture),” in Perseus Digital Library Tufts University, (2014). &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact;jsessionid=11BC2A7C671270C807E2C9C6CA2ECED9?name=Piraeus+Athena&amp;object=Sculpture &gt;. 
p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Athena additionally wears a helmet, which also helps to date the statue. This is because Athena wears a Corinthian helmet, which in fourth century B.C became very popular, as opposed to an Attic helmet where she is shown wearing in other sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;Waywell, G. B., “Athena mattei,” in The Annual of the British School at Athens 66. (1971). p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; The helmet in the Piraeus Athena has griffins on each side of the crest, and two owls on the visor.&lt;ref&gt;“Piraeus Athena (Sculpture),” in Perseus Digital Library Tufts University, (2014). &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact;jsessionid=11BC2A7C671270C807E2C9C6CA2ECED9?name=Piraeus+Athena&amp;object=Sculpture &gt;. p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Piraeus Athena has been determined to be an original, and many believe that the Athena Mattei exposed in the Louvre is the sole existing copy of it, even though the position of the right arm is in a different position.&lt;ref&gt;“Piraeus Athena (Sculpture),” in Perseus Digital Library Tufts University, (2014). &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact;jsessionid=11BC2A7C671270C807E2C9C6CA2ECED9?name=Piraeus+Athena&amp;object=Sculpture &gt;. 
p.1&lt;/ref&gt; There are various artists who have been thought to have possibly made the Piraeus Athena. Some say it could be the work of [[Cephisodotos]], who is known to have made a statue of Athena during the fourth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Waywell, G. B., “Athena mattei,” in The Annual of the British School at Athens 66. (1971). p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; Others say that it may be the work of [[Euphranor]] because it shares similarities with one of his other works, the Apollo Patroos.&lt;ref&gt;“Piraeus Athena (Sculpture),” in Perseus Digital Library Tufts University, (2014). &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact;jsessionid=11BC2A7C671270C807E2C9C6CA2ECED9?name=Piraeus+Athena&amp;object=Sculpture &gt;. 
p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities include a full face and long neck that indicates a similarity in style, according to the scholar, Olga Palagia.&lt;ref&gt;Palagia, Olga, Euphranor. (Netherlands, 1980). p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''[[Planned Parenthood]] v. Rounds''''', 686 F.3d 889 (8th Cir. 2012) (en banc),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Planned Parenthood v. Rounds |vol=686 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=889 |pinpoint= |court=[[8th Cir.]] |date=2012 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20120724142 |accessdate=2018-07-11 |quote=}} {{Include-FedCourts}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a decision by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] that upheld a provision of a South Dakota law that requires a doctor to inform a patient, prior to providing an abortion, that one of the "known medical risks of the procedure and statistically significant risk factors" is an "increased risk of suicide ideation and suicide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Planned Parenthood v. Rounds |vol=375 |reporter=F. Supp. 2d |opinion=881 |pinpoint=884 |court=[[United States District Court for the District of South Dakota|D.S.D.]] |date=2005 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/20051256375fsupp2d88111172 |accessdate=2018-07-11 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district court, in setting the initial injunction against enforcing this law, relied on studies that showed some correlation between abortion and suicide, but showed no evidence that an abortion causes a woman to be at greater risk for suicide.  Rather, the studies indicated that the same factors that cause a woman to seek an abortion, like emotional distress, domestic violence and socioeconomic disadvantage, also make them more likely to be depressed and suicidal. [[Abortion and mental health|The scientific consensus is that abortion does not increase the risk of any mental health problems]].

The Eighth Circuit noted that states may mandate disclosures as part of obtaining informed consent, so long as those disclosures are neither false nor misleading. The Eighth Circuit acknowledged that the record did not support an inference that abortion causes suicide.  However, the court said that the South Dakota law does not require doctors to inform women that abortion causes suicide; it requires only that women hear that abortion is associated with an increased risk of suicide, and as used in its scientific sense, "association" does not imply causation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18067">A '''press pass''' (alternatively referred to as a '''press card''' or a '''journalist pass''') grants some type of special privilege to [[journalist]]s.  Some cards have recognized [[legal]] status; others merely indicate that the bearer is a practicing journalist.  The nature of the benefits is determined by the type of issuing agency, of which there are three major categories: [[news organization]]s, [[police|law-enforcement agencies]], and event organizers (usually for a specific single affair like a corporate [[press conference]]).  Each type of card grants different authorizations, thus it is often necessary or desirable for reporters to hold multiple press passes simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Photos"&gt;{{cite web

Police departments at a [[city]], [[county]], or [[State (country subdivision)|state/provincial]] level may issue press passes in some countries.&lt;ref name="Photos"/&gt;  Such passes allow the bearer to cross police or fire lines to report [[breaking news]], or grant access to [[crime scene]]s or other restricted areas&lt;ref name="SFPD"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;– though admission may be denied if it would interfere with the duties of emergency personnel. Popular media of the mid-20th century often depicted reporters at a crime scene with their press passes tucked into their [[hat band]]s, which was unusual in reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CzwtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=or4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2437%2C1843017|title=Press card – ticket into harm's way|last=McDonnell|first=Pat J.|date=July 21, 1982|work=Evening Herald|page=4|accessdate=29 October 2012|location=Rock Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the exceptional dispensation endowed by police press passes, they are issued with discretion–some jurisdictions require an in-person [[interview]] with all prospective applicants, complete set of fingerprints, and a background check.&lt;ref name="Gothamist"&gt;{{cite web

Police-issued passes do not grant access to government press conferences or any other such privileges: they are only recognized by emergency response personnel, and only valid within the jurisdiction of the issuing agencies.&lt;ref name="SFPD"/&gt;

===Parking permits===
Police [[parking]] permits, issued in some jurisdictions, exempt news vehicles from certain [[Parking violation|parking restrictions]] while on the job.  They may be offered to any news-gathering organization that covers breaking news for use in company vehicles employed by full-time reporters, photographers, and camera operators. Often, these permits are only granted to journalists who already carry a police press card.

When conspicuously displayed, these permits may allow the bearer to park in restricted "[[Residential zoned parking|resident-only]]" parking zones, and may exempt him or her from [[Parking meter|parking-meter]] costs. These privileges apply only for the duration of breaking-news coverage, and do not nullify all parking restrictions: red zones, [[fire hydrant]]s, [[crosswalk]]s, [[Bus stop|bus zones]], [[Disabled parking permit|disabled parking]] zones or access ramps, commercial loading zones, [[taxi cab]] zones, "no stopping" or "no parking" zones, transit lanes, and other towaway zones are still off-limits.&lt;ref name="SFPD"/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many events publicity in [[Mass media|news media]] and elsewhere is of great importance, and granting privileges to the press can help in this. The privileges granted to holders of press badges, and who is eligible to receive them, depends on the nature of the affair.

Generally, prospective recipients must apply in advance, offering evidence of their affiliation.  Event sponsors may request past [[publishing|published]] material, or a letter from the news agency on its letterhead, detailing the job assignment.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web

===Open events===
[[File:Bryan1900press.JPG|thumb|1900 press pass to a [[William Jennings Bryan]] speech]]

===Closed events===
For events closed to the general public, police- or news organization-issued press passes sometimes grant access, but almost all require advance application for admittance.  Greater exclusivity, however, means more restrictions on potential pass recipients.  For professional conferences or trade shows, passes may be granted only to journalists who regularly cover the industry or who hold a title of "[[industry analyst]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| title =Press Registration| work =| publisher =Cambridge Health Institution| date =| url =http://www.healthtech.com/press.ASP| format =| doi =| accessdate =2007-05-07| archiveurl =https://www.webcitation.org/5jxfn4LFL?url=http://www.healthtech.com/press.ASP| archivedate =2009-09-21| deadurl =yes| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or with an editorial or reporting designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| title =Press Pass Request Form| work =| publisher =Bike Information Association| date =| url =https://www.diahome.org/DIAHome/AboutDIA/Resources/Docs/DIAPressPassFinal.pdf| archive-url =http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081028233108/https://www.diahome.org/DIAHome/AboutDIA/Resources/Docs/DIAPressPassFinal.pdf| dead-url =yes| archive-date =2008-10-28| format =| doi =| accessdate =2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==News agency cards==

  2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To this end, journalistic agencies issue press cards to their reporters, editorialists, writers, and photographers.  These do not have the legal merits of government-issued cards, and they will not replace event-specific passes; the card only serves as proof of its bearer's status as a legitimate newsperson according to the issuing organization.  As such, card-carriers may be better able to obtain interviews, acquire information from law-enforcement, or gain access to exclusive venues.

In the United Kingdom, the UK Press Card Authority (a voluntary consortium of news agencies) issues a nationally standardized card to United Kingdom-based news gatherers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| title =The UK Press Card Authority| work =| publisher =The UK Press Card Authority| date =| url =http://www.presscard.uk.com/| format =| doi =| accessdate =2007-05-07| archiveurl =https://www.webcitation.org/5jxg0As3A?url=http://www.ppa.co.uk/press-and-media/press-cards/about-press-cards/| archivedate =2009-09-21| deadurl =yes| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most other European countries, cards are issued by national trade unions of journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| title =How to get a national press card from 28 countries| work =| publisher =Press.Cards| date =| url =http://press.cards/index.php/blog/18-how-to-get-a-national-press-card-from-28-countries| format =| doi =| accessdate =2018-05-14| archiveurl =http://press.cards/index.php/blog/18-how-to-get-a-national-press-card-from-28-countries| archivedate =2018-05-14| deadurl =no| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some require membership or government approval.

For [[freelance journalist]]s, organizations like the [[National Writers Union]], [[Professional Publishers Association]] issue cards. 

==Fake cards==
Genuine press cards can be obtained by people not entitled to them, counterfeit copies of real cards can be made, and plausible-looking cards can be issued by anybody, or made. The reasons and consequences range from the trivial (free drinks) to the catastrophic (access by terrorists&lt;ref name=cioj/&gt; to rulers).

;Spurious cards
Press passes not issued by a recognised publication can be obtained or made, with the intention of gaining benefits offered to holders of legitimate press cards. Joan Stewart of the [[Public Relations Society of America]] reports, “Fake press passes abound at [[restaurant]] and [[theater]] openings, [[sporting events]], [[concert|music festivals]], [[political rally|political rallies]], celebrity parties and even crime scenes. With a decent [[computer]] and color [[Computer printer|printer]], almost anybody can crank out an official-looking pass within minutes.”&lt;ref&gt;

;Counterfeit cards
Counterfeit copies of cards issued by legitimate publications can be made. Issuers of cards have taken measures to prevent [[counterfeit]]ing of their cards, creating cards with [[Holographic#Mass replication|holographic foil]] blocking, [[signature]] strips, and tamper-resistant [[laminate|lamination]].&lt;ref name=cioj&gt;{{cite web

In '''''R v Schoonwinkel''''',&lt;ref&gt;1953 (3) SA 136 (C).&lt;/ref&gt; an important case in [[South African criminal law]], particularly as it applies to the defence of [[automatism (law)|automatism]], the driver of a motor vehicle was charged with culpable homicide, having collided with and killed a passenger in another car. The accused had suffered an epileptic fit at the time of the accident, rendering his mind a blank. The nature of his epilepsy was such that he would normally not have realised or foreseen the dangers of driving, having had only two previous minor attacks, the last a long time before the accident. This evidence, distinguishing this case from ''[[R v Victor]]'', exonerated him from criminal responsibility. The court found additionally that this was not a case falling under the provisions of the Mental Disorders Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act 38 of 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; read with section 219 of the Criminal Procedure Act.&lt;ref&gt;Act 31 of 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1309">In '''''S v Tembani''''', an important case in [[South Africa]]n [[criminal law]], especially in respect of the issue of [[legal causation]], it seemed to the Witwatersrand Local Division, following the approach of English law, to be "of overriding importance that the original wound inflicted by the accused was an operating and substantial cause of the death of the deceased." If, at the time of death, the original wound is still an operating and substantial cause of death, then the death is a result of the wound, even if another cause was also operating. The court thus appeared to endorse the "proximate-cause" criterion, also known as direct-consequences or individualisation theory, of legal causation. The court added that death is not the result of the original wound if it is just the setting in which another cause operates. Only if the second cause is so overwhelming as to make the original wound merely part of the history may it be said that death does not flow from the wound.

The '''Statue of Sobekneferu''' was a sculpture of the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian queen [[Sobekneferu]] (about 1800 BC), who reigned during the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th dynasty]].

The bust with the ruler's preserved face is the first known statue of the queen with a face. The sculpture was kept in the [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin]], but was lost in [[World War II]]. The bust was bought in 1899 (inventory no. 14475). The bust was about 14&amp;nbsp;cm high and made of [[greywacke]]. The identity of the woman shown was for a long time unknown,&lt;ref&gt;Biri Fay proposed already in 1988 Sobekneferu as the women depicted: B. Fay: ''Amenemhat V -Vienna/Aswan'', in: ''Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts, Kairo'' 44 (1988), 74-75, note 64&lt;/ref&gt; as the piece is uninscribed. The face of the woman shows clearly signs of age and dates therefore stylistically to the late [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], when most sculptures show people no longer ageless young as in other periods of Egyptian history. Today, the bust is known from photographic images,&lt;ref&gt;see for example: Hedwig Fechheimer: ''Die Plastik der Ägypter.'' Cassirer, Berlin 1914, plates 57–58; B. Fay: ''Amenemhat V -Vienna/Aswan'', in: ''Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts, Kairo'' 44 (1988), pl. 29c&lt;/ref&gt; and also from preserved [[plaster cast]]s.

The [[Egyptologist]] Biri Fay was able to locate the remaining part of the statue. It is now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts in Boston]] (MFA 24.742, 21.4&amp;nbsp;cm high&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/lower-body-fragment-of-a-female-statue-seated-on-a-throne-145757 Lower body fragment of a female statue seated on a throne].'' Boston Museum of Fine Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;), but was once found in the temple of [[Taharqa]] in the [[Nubia]]n fortress of [[Semna]].&lt;ref&gt;Dows Dunham, Jozef M. A. Janssen: ''Second cataract forts.'' Band 1: ''Semna Kumma.'' Museum of Fine Arts, Boston 1960, 33, plate 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The lower part of the statue is also uninscribed but shows on the throne the hieroglyphic signs ''uniting the two lands'' (zm3-t3wy). This is a royal symbol and only attested for kings. Therefore, this (now photographically united) statue shows a woman that ruled as king and must belong to Sobekneferu, the only ruling queen of the late Middle Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Biri Fay, R. E. Freed, T. Schelper, Friederike Seyfried: ''Neferusobek Project: Part I''. In: G. Miniaci, W.

[http://egittologia.cfs.unipi.it/it/download/mks1/ online]&lt;/ref&gt; There are several statues known belonging to this ruling queen. However, each one is headless.

}} '''''The Haunting of Sunshine Girl''''' is an ongoing supernatural horror [[web series]] that is currently broadcast on [[YouTube]]. The series was created by Paige McKenzie, Nick Hagen, and [[Mercedes Rose]], and is produced by Coat Tale Productions. The series first launched in 2010 and its premiere episode was uploaded on December 10, 2010. ''The Haunting of Sunshine Girl'' quickly rose in popularity and between December 2010 to October 2011 the show received more than 4.3 million total hits.&lt;ref name="columbian1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vorenberg |first=Sue |url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2011/oct/16/sunshines-shadowy-side-vancouver-made-web-series-t/ |title=Sunshine’s shadowy side |publisher=The Columbian |date=2011-10-16 |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average length of the episodes is about two minutes but can run less depending on the episode and content.

The cast of ''The Haunting of Sunshine Girl'' is composed mostly of professional actors. McKenzie, the series's lead actress, did not initially identify herself by her real name, choosing instead to use the pseudonyms Sunshine Girl and Frances Jones until she revealed her real name in June 2013.&lt;ref name="Bustle2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/71368-the-haunting-of-sunshine-girl-creator-paige-mckenzie-talks-her-unexpected-biggest-fear-and-all-things|title='The Haunting of Sunshine Girl' Creator Paige McKenzie Talks Her Unexpected Biggest Fear And All Things Spooky|publisher=Bustle|last1=White|first1=Caitlin|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stars in the series along with her mother [[Mercedes Rose]], Maxwell Arnold, Seth Renne, and Adrienne Vogel. The series is filmed at Hagen's home in [[Vancouver, Washington]] and other places in Washington and Oregon.&lt;ref name="columbian1"/&gt;

''The Haunting of Sunshine Girl'' tells the story of a teenage girl documenting the [[paranormal]] activity in her house. She uploads the short episodes on her YouTube channel.

==Plot==

===Season #1: The Original Haunting===
When Sunshine and her mother (Mercedes Rose) move into a new house, Sunshine  begins experiencing paranormal activity.  She decides to document her experiences in order to prove to her mother that the activity is real.  Later, a strange woman (Adrienne Vogel) shows up at her house and warns Sunshine that the house is not safe.  Meanwhile, the paranormal activity grows and gets more intense.

Sunshine receives a photograph of a man and a girl, both with bags over their heads, along with a note reading: "They are watching you." Later, the two ghosts show themselves.  The strange woman returns to give a box to Sunshine Girl, warning her not to open it.  The box seems to stop the haunting, but it has a foul odor, and Sunshine and her mother open it.  The ghosts return, worse than before. One of the ghosts attacks Sunshine Girl, keeping her locked in a bathroom, while the other ghost burns the strange photograph.

Sunshine asks the mysterious woman for help. Using a [[smudge stick]], the stranger purifies Sunshine's house.  The ghosts vanish, and Sunshine's mother finally believes they were real.

===Season #2: The Oregon Coast Road Trip===
This season has more of a [[Documentary film|documentary]] feel, featuring interviews with real people, while continuing the plot. Sunshine and her mother take a roadtrip to Oregon in search of more haunted places.  Along the way, Sunshine meets Anna, one of the ghosts haunting her house.  Sunshine records strange [[Electronic voice phenomena|EVP]] and hears a voice say "don't trust her."

===Season #3: The Cult and the Demon===
After returning home, Sunshine Girl begins a search for her father. She finds an address that her mother was keeping from her, and, believing it might be her father's new home, she visits the place only to learn that it is a frightening abandoned house.  Inside the house, she finds a copy of the same photograph of the man and girl, who she now knows are the spirits haunting her house. While returning home, a strange man tries to kill her. She hits him with her car, only to have him stand up again.  Finally she escapes.

Sunshine discovers that her mom is possessed by a demon.  She finds a local paranormal expert that is calling himself "LeMaster" (Rhyan Schwartz) and a medium called Alistair (Christopher Toyne). Alistair visits the home, where his mouth begins to bleed.  He warns Sunshine not to trust her mom.  Furious, Sunshine's mom orders the medium to leave.  Later, Sunshine calls Alistair, only to learn that he has died.

Meanwhile, LeMaster discovers that two ghosts belonged to a cult. The members have to sacrifice their first-born daughters to a demon—the same demon that has possessed Sunshine's mom.  LeMaster does not want to become involved in this haunting and rejects Sunshine's pleas for help.

Desperate, Sunshine uses her [[ouija board]] to contact the spirits.  At that moment, the mysterious woman returns, revealing that her name is Victoria.  She shows Sunshine the place where the cultists sacrificed their daughters, and tells Sunshine that the only way to save her mom is by pretending to sacrifice herself.

During the sacrificial ceremony, the demon appears.  Victoria tries to protect Sunshine, but the demon cuts her throat. Victoria disappears.

While Sunshine waits in the rain with a bag sheltering her head, the man from the abandoned house appears, removes the bag, and tells her that the demon cannot take her because she is a ''luiseach'': a person with paranormal powers used to fight evil.  After the man has gone, Sunshine's mom and Uncle Tommy (Seth Renne) find her. In the next video Sunshine reveals that her name is Frances Jones.

===Season #4: Paranormal Powers===
At the beginning of Season 4, Nolan, a 19-year-old boy, learns that Sunshine Girl is a ''luiseach''.  Nolan persuades Sunshine to stay a night in his grandmother's haunted house.  There they meet Frederick, a very violent and dangerous ghost. With Victoria's help, Sunshine delivers Frederick from being a ghost and ends the haunting.

Sunshine finds another anonymous letter in the mail showing a warehouse. Sunshine and Nolan go there, but can find nothing—until they see a man driving away.  The man appears to have followed them.

Nolan tells Sunshine that he hears voices. He invites a paranormal expert to go to Sunshine's house, but the expert turns out to be LeMaster.  Nolan's voices tell Nolan that LeMaster is evil and is after Sunshine because of her ''luiseach'' powers.  Nolan, terrified and desperate of protecting Sunshine, shoots LeMaster, who at first appears dead.  Suddenly he stands up and threatens Sunshine with a demonic voice.  Nolan and LeMaster both disappear.

Nolan begins to appear and disappear in Sunshine's house.  Sunshine searches for any evidence that Nolan really existed, but even Nolan's grandmother does not remember him.  Sunshine returns to the photograph of the warehouse and finds a hidden message reading ''3 a.m.''.  At 3 AM, Sunshine, her mother, and Uncle Tommy go to the warehouse, where they meet Victoria. Victoria tells Sunshine that Nolan is an awaken - a person that had a [[Near Death Experience]] and after that has paranormal abilities such as [[Astral projection]]. She then tells Sunshine after they find Nolan that her father was a luiseach, but he turned over to the Markons and turned evil.

Sunshine finds an 8&amp;nbsp;mm film in her garden.  This film shows a girl being sacrificed by a strange man and a woman Sunshine recognizes as Victoria.  The season ends with Sunshine meeting the ghost-girl Anna.  She removes the bag from Anna's head, finally revealing that she is the sacrificed girl from the film.

===Season #5: Stranger Turns===
Victoria suddenly shows up to ask Sunshine if she still trusts her. Sunshine answers: "Not really." Despite that Victoria gives the ceremonial knife to Sunshine and asks her to sacrifice her once she has to. Then one night Sunshine hears her mother screaming and Sunshine went downstairs and Victoria showed up telling Sunshine that she needs to know the difference between what is real and what is paranormal. Later, Victoria introduces Sunshine to a man that is claimed to be her mentor. Sunshine experiences lots of paranormal activity. Nolan visits Sunshine's house and tells her that he had a dream when Sunshine's father had a demon on a leash and he kept on repeating, "We're coming to get you!" A third ghost shows itself in one of her videos. She has a white dress and her hair is almost completely over her face. The paranormal activity in the house is getting worse, and in one video Uncle Tommy spit up that compost again and was bleeding from his face. Victoria comes and says that she wants to do another ritual (the first ritual was the sacrifice) but this one involves burning the house down. Sunshine has also confirmed that they are moving. Victoria returns and tells Sunshine that she was not a Luiseach but a normal teenage girl (which may be hinted that Sunshine's powers were possibly removed for her safety). The Markons had decided to forget about Anna and she did not need Sunshine's help any more. The seasons ends with Sunshine and her mom moving out of the house.

===Season #6: The Cabin in the Woods===
For Sunshine's high school graduation, her mother decides to take her to a "haunted" cabin in the woods. They stay in the cabin for a few days and they start experiencing paranormal activity going on.  Sunshine then finds a guest book to the house that contains a name that says that the ghost wants his dog Rex. They later on go outside and they find a metal gold box that contains the dog, Rex in it. It turns out that Rex is a stuffed animal dog. Later on they leave the house for a little bit to get away from the ghost. They come home and the dog is on a bed upstairs. A few nights later the lights go out and there is crazy stuff happening. The boy was not found but he touched Sunshine. Then they leave.

===Season #7: The Haunted River House===
In this less spooky, more humorous season, Sunshine meets Nolan's mom, who says that she knows of a haunted house that Sunshine should check out. Also, the "paranormal investigators" from The Investigation of Haunting of Sunshine Girl keep calling her. They meet up at the haunted river house and they check it out but not that much happens. At the end they do however find out what causes the so-called hauntings.

===Season #8: A New Haunted House===
Sunshine and her mom Kat have moved to a different house, but they are still experiencing paranormal phenomena; voices coming from the ventilation system and kitchen drawers opening by themselves. When Sunshine visits Nolan in his new apartment, the ghost seems to have followed her there.

Since the Halloween events, Nolan is missing. Sunshine is worried about him and starts to investigate. She meets Nolan's brother Colin, who is also looking for Nolan. She tricks Nolan in showing up, using some psychology, after which Nolan and Colin become rivals for Sunshine's friendship.

The first part it set in Sunshine’s home, where paranormal activities are more prominent than before. The second part is set at the haunted house of a couple, Jamie and Patrick, who are not telling the whole truth. In the third part Sunshine and Nolan visit the haunted recording and sound editing studio of Marc, where they experience very strange and frightening phenomena. The fourth part is mostly set at Sunshine’s home again, followed by a part where Victoria takes her to a training house to further develop her skills. In the final part Sunshine, Nolan and uncle Tommy set out to find Sunshine’s father, which leads to a dramatic climax.

==Production==
In December 2010 Hagen approached actress Mercedes Rose with the idea to create a paranormal web-based show, as he noted that the word "ghost" was a common search term.&lt;ref name=WW /&gt; Rose later described the idea as "''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' meets ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'' with a little ''[[Easy A]]'' thrown in."&lt;ref name="showfax1"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://more.showfax.com/plus/pov/2011/09/actors_are_liars.html |title=Actors Are Liars (The Actors Voice - POV) |publisher=More.showfax.com |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show would be unscripted and center around a "girl trying to prove her house is haunted".&lt;ref name="showfax1" /&gt; Hagen and Rose then enlisted Rose's daughter, Kat McKenzie, to star as the series's main character.&lt;ref name=Bustle&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Caitlin|title='The Haunting of Sunshine Girl' Creator Paige McKenzie Talks Her Unexpected Biggest Fear And All Things Spooky|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/71368-the-haunting-of-sunshine-girl-creator-paige-mckenzie-talks-her-unexpected-biggest-fear-and-all-things|publisher=Bustle|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there the three worked on the series's concept and chose to develop the story as the series progressed, as they "wanted something that we could keep doing on YouTube but could also be expanded into a bigger "universe" with these paranormal rules and characters we’ve set up."&lt;ref name=NewMediaRockstars&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klima|first1=Jeff|title='The Haunting of Sunshine Girl’s’ Paige McKenzie Talks Her YouTube Series and New Major Book/Movie Deal [INTERVIEW]|url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/05/the-haunting-of-sunshine-girls-paige-mckenzie-talks-her-youtube-series-and-new-major-bookmovie-deal-interview/|publisher=[[NewMediaRockstars]]|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKenzie chose to base the character upon herself, as she felt that the channel "wouldn’t feel genuine if it felt like I was putting on some sort of act."&lt;ref name=NewMediaRockstars /&gt; McKenzie did not initially reveal her name to viewers until 2013, a move that she later stated was due to fear of stalkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Samotin|first1=Perrie|title=The Haunting of Sunshine Girl: The YouTube Series About to be the Next YA Hit|url=http://stylecaster.com/the-haunting-of-sunshine-girl-the-youtube-series-about-to-be-the-next-ya-hit/|publisher=StyleCaster|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most episodes are filmed with a flip camera by the actors themselves. This filming format was chosen as it would allow them to film multiple episodes at a time, which would make it easier to post new videos each week. Hagen noted that he had to use specific keywords that would allow for the best [[search-engine optimization]], which made it easier for users to find and enable them to have "100,000 views within weeks" without having to actively promote the channel.&lt;ref name=WW /&gt; Aside from optimization, McKenzie found that interacting with fans also raised the series's visibility and viewership numbers. Fans can interact with McKenzie via her social media accounts and by sharing videos.&lt;ref name=WW /&gt; The channel became a [[YouTube Partner]] in 2011 and during 2014 made $4,000 to $6,000 a month via ads.&lt;ref name=WW /&gt;

In 2013 McKenzie took part in a scholarship competition in ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine, where she ran under her real name and mentioned ''The Haunting of Sunshine Girl''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MEET THE PRETTY AMAZING FINALISTS!|url=http://www.seventeen.com/life/g369/2013-pretty-amazing-finalists/?slide=2|publisher=Seventeen|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contest attracted the attention of a literary agent, who helped finalize a deal with the [[Weinstein Company]] to produce a book and television series based on ''The Haunting of Sunshine Girl''.&lt;ref name=WW /&gt;

==Spin-Offs==

===Sunshine's World===
Sunshine's World is another YouTube channel by Coat Tale Productions. There is no plot. Sunshine Girl just posts videos about her visiting a pumpkin farm, a shop in Portland or showing her posters to the audience. It is the [[vlog]] of an 18-year-old girl. The last upload to this channel was March 9, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/user/SunshinesVlog|title = Sunshine's Vlog YouTube Channel|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sunshine Screen Prints===
In "Sunshine Screen Prints," Sunshine Girl shows her audience the basics of [[screen printing]].

===Uncle Tommy's YouTube Confessions===
''Uncle Tommy's YouTube Confessions'' is the first spin-off based on a supporting character of "The Haunting of Sunshine Girl". It is an interactive series in which the audience sends secret confessions via comment or email to "Uncle Tommy," which he and friends might then read on the show.  Occasionally Kat or Sunshine Girl appear in Uncle Tommy's videos.

==Feature films==

=== ''Sunshine Girl and the Hunt for Black Eyed Kids'' ===
In November 2011 Coat Tale Productions launched a [[Kickstarter]] project to fund a feature film, ''In Search of Black Eyed Kids'' (later retitled ''Sunshine Girl and the Hunt for Black Eyed Kids'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Unknown Horror: In Search of Black Eyed Kids (Feature)|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1592594525/an-unknown-horror-in-search-of-black-eyed-kids-fea?lang=en|publisher=Kickstarter|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film would follow Sunshine and other series characters as they search for [[black-eyed children]], an [[urban legend]] surrounding supernatural creatures. The Kickstarter campaign met its goals, but Mercedes Rose later stated that the majority of the funding came from friends, family, and members of their film community.&lt;ref name="Kickstarter BEK"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rose |first1=Mercedes |title=I Hate Roller Coasters (Or, The Highs and Lows of Crowd Funding) |url=http://unscripted.backstage.com/2011/12/i-hate-roller-coasters-or-the-highs-and-lows-of-crowd-funding.html |publisher=Backstage (archived) |accessdate=26 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426014125/http://unscripted.backstage.com/2011/12/i-hate-roller-coasters-or-the-highs-and-lows-of-crowd-funding.html |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming for ''Sunshine Girl and the Hunt for Black Eyed Kids'' began in January 2012 in Portland, Oregon, and was produced in association with [[Lyon Films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Zachary |url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2012/jan/10/in-search-of-black-eyed-kids/ |title=‘Black Eyed Kids’ sought for movie |publisher=The Columbian |date=2012-01-10 |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was released on DVD in December 2012 and is available via download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunshine Girl and the Hunt for Black Eyed Kids (review)|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/dvd-reviews/sunshine-girl-and-the-hunt-for-black-eyed-kids|publisher=JoBlo.com|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== THR33 ===
In November 2013 McKenzie launched an [[Indiegogo]] project to fund a second feature film, then temporarily titled ''Alone'', and the campaign raised [[USD|$]]2,480.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alone - Feature Film Pre-Order - *Temporary Title|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/alone-feature-film-pre-order-temporary-title#/story|publisher=IndieGoGo|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is set during the 1980s and centers around a girl (played by McKenzie) stuck in a cabin with a ghost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YouTube star Paige McKenzie to star in horror film "Thr33"|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/2015/02/12/youtube-star-paige-mckenzie-to-star-in-horror-film-thr33-2685870?lt_source=external,manual|publisher=MoviePilot|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's name was later changed to ''Three'' (also stylized as ''Thr33'') and filming commenced in 2014.&lt;ref name=WW&gt;{{cite web|last1=JACOBSON|first1=REBECCA|title=80 Million Paige Views|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-22863-80-million-paige-views.html|publisher=Wiliamette Week|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thr33 was released on 29 January 2016.

==Books==
In 2014 the Weinstein Co. announced that they had closed a multiplatform deal to adapt ''The Haunting of Sunshine Girl'' into a [[young adult novel]] and film franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/weinstein-adapting-haunting-sunshine-girl-701365 |title=Weinstein Co.

On March 1, 2016 the sequel to The ''Haunting of Sunshine Girl'' was released titled ''The Awakening of Sunshine Girl''  in hardback, e-book, and audiobook via [[Weinstein Books]], and like its predecessor had many praises for the scary plot and deep character development and criticism for the lack originality based on other supernatural young adult novels.

The third and final book, "The Sacrifice of Sunshine girl", was released April 4, 2017. The book completed the trilogy and was also based on the hit YouTube channel.

==TV show==
In March 2015 McKenzie announced that there were plans for the Weinstein Co. to adapt ''The Haunting of Sunshine Girl'' into either a feature film or television show, along with a novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Cory|title=Behind the scenes: "The Haunting of Sunshine Girl"|url=http://www.katu.com/news/local/Behind-the-scenes-The-Haunting-of-Sunshine-Girl-296380171.html|publisher=KATU|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month McKenzie issued a [[press release]] stating that it had been decided that they would progress with a television show rather than a film, as they felt that "TV would be an easier transition."&lt;ref name=PR&gt;{{cite web|title=The Haunting of Sunshine Girl's Paige McKenzie Talks Book Adaptation and Reveals It Will Now Be Adapted Into a TV Show Instead of a Movie|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/04/prweb12668600.htm|publisher=PR Web (press release)|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series will be based on the novel released in September 2015 and will have McKenzie in the starring role.&lt;ref name=nytbook /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6850">As letters became more and more popular as a means of communication, guides sprang up accordingly about just how one was to write a letter, what was proper, and what was out of the question. Many Victorian conventions shine through the guides, and are a valuable way of understanding certain tensions in nineteenth century England, such as a certain "artful artlessness" that came about as the result of the urge to speak from the heart, but never more than was proper.

==Physical concerns==
A letter’s physical appearance, in addition to content, was a key concern for letter-writing guides. For men, they advocated as plain [[paper]] as could be made available, and for women a light spritz of [[perfume]] was sometimes acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous 1851, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources, however, disagreed, and suggested high outward ornamentation such as ribbons, flowery drawings, and interesting colors could be used by females, but part of this may have been the date of the guide, as vogue changed by the decade.&lt;ref&gt;Frost 1867, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the century, ribbons were very popular, but fashion changed to heavy cream paper in the 1880s and then monogrammed letterheads by the end of the nineteenth century. The manner of sealing the letter also changed over the course of the years. Originally it had been wax wafers and dried gum, but as time went on [[Sealing wax|colored wax]] became more prevalent, the use of which was dictated by social conventions. Black wax was always associated with mourning, but red wax was to be used in letters between men, particularly those dealing with business, and letters from men to women.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques 1857, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Women were free to use a range of colors, no matter the correspondent. Even [[ink]] was hotly debated; though all sides agreed on bold black ink, blue was sometimes suggested as an alternative, and all other colors shunned, though most letter-writing guides acknowledged that they had once been in fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous 1851, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contradictions==
Letter writing guides simultaneously advised writing with absolute feeling and being cautious about saying too much, or saying the wrong things, regardless of whether or not these wrong things had real feeling behind them. Many guides cautioned that anyone could read your letters and thereby make inferences about you, even if those who you corresponded with assured you that they burnt your epistles.&lt;ref&gt;Frost 1867, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matrimonial Letters===
The caution about appearance in letters was doubly stressed in matrimonial letters, even as women and men were encouraged to still write from the heart. Men were warned against complimenting their chosen bride too heavily, as it seemed insincere; rather, their moral traits and the feminine virtue of indifference were set as prime subjects to appreciate in a marriage proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Frost 1867, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Women, meanwhile, were urged not to be too unguarded in their letters, even in the acceptance of a proposal, to only thank and address the man’s moral qualities. Love letters did not end in ‘love,’ but more frequently simply as ‘ever your friend.’

==Example Letters==
{{cquote|'''From a Gentleman to a Lady confessing a Change of Sentiment.''' &lt;ref&gt;From Frost 1867, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miss Rachel,--Your note has opened my eyes to the fully and wrong of the course I have pursued of late. All night I have been pacing my floor, trying to decide what course it was my duty to pursue, and I have decided to answer you as frankly as you desire.

I will not attempt to excuse myself, for I deserve your anger, but I will only say that I was myself deceived in my own feelings. When I asked you to marry me, I believed that we were congenial, and that I could make you happy. I was not rich, but had sufficient, as I thought, for comfort, and thinking you would be content with a moderate competency, I invited you to share mine. Closer intimacy has proved my error. Your extravagant wishes are utterly beyond my means, and your bitter and sarcastic remarks upon those of your friends who are not wealthy prove that you covet a life of luxury.

Again, for you ask for frankness, you have so often pained me by your uneven and sullen temper, that I foresee a life of misery for both after marriage.

I know that honor binds me to you, and therefore will not ask for my release if you do not desire it, but will, if we marry, endeavor faithfully to make you demand the reasons for my coldness, I have given them.

Leaving our engagement entirely in your hands, I am,
Ever your friend,
Henry Hendricks.}}
{{cquote|'''From a Gentleman to a Lady Requesting an Explanation of Unfavorable Comments upon him.'''&lt;ref&gt;Frost 1867, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dear Lucy,--I have just had a long interview with a mutual friend of yours and mine, who has surprised me by repeating your unfounded assertions with regard to me. Of course, what is merely your opinion, I have no right to resent, though I regret that it should be so unfavorable, but I have a right to demand your grounds for asserting that I am an arrant flirt, a hypocrite, and concerned in more than one dishonorable transaction.

Will you have the kindness to inform me with whom I have flirted, how played the hypocrite, and in what dishonorable transactions I have been concerned.

Paul Smith.}}
{{cquote|'''Reply to the Foregoing.'''&lt;ref&gt;Frost 1867, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Smith, Esq.,--The high tone of your letter might impose upon one who was not so well acquainted with your history previous to your arrival at this place as I happen to be. My opinion was founded upon a knowledge of your life while you resided in St. Louis.

When I inform you that Mrs. Carrie Ryder is one of my most intimate friends and constant correspondent, you will not again request a list of your misdoings. If you consider your course of conduct in deceiving your uncle, endeavoring to ruin your young cousin Charles, and attempting to elope with an heiress of fifteen, honorable, I can only say that I differ in opinion.

Lucy Johnston.}}

{{Refimprove|article|date=September 2007}}
'''''Vishuddha Siddhanta Panjika''''' ({{lang-bn|বিশুদ্ধ সিদ্ধান্ত পঞ্জিকা}}) is a [[panjika]] ([[almanac]]) that was first published in 1297 [[Bengali people|Bengali]] year (1890 AD).  Madhab Chandra Chattopadhyay of the [[Bengal]] of undivided [[India]] was the first editor.

== Accuracy ==
The 19th century [[Bengali language|Bengali]] almanacs that gave details of [[tithi]], [[nakshatra]], etc. were generally not in conformity with the position of [[planets]]. A true [[panjika]] has to tally with the scientific observation. To meet this end, prominent [[astrologer]]s of that time — almanac reformist of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] Mahamahopadhyay Chandrashekhar Sinha Samanta, Lokmanya [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] of [[Pune]], Western India, scriptural scholars like Bapudev Shastri and Ketkar, experts from Kashi like [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]], Maha mahopadhyay Maheshchandra Nyayaratna, Sasadhar Tarkachudamani, [[Acharya]] Yogesh Chandra Roy Vidyanidhi of Bengal — advised the publication of ''Vishuddha Siddhanta Almanac''.

== Approval and adoption ==
''Vishuddha Siddhanta Almanac'' is recognized by scholars of scriptures such as Deshikottama Dr Srijiv Nyayaratna, [[mathematics]] scholar Nirmal Chandra Lahiri, internationally known scientist Prof [[Megh Nad Saha]], et al.

This almanac is approved and followed by [[Sankaracharya]] [[Jayendra Saraswati]] of [[Kanchi matha]], Sri [[Tarakeshwar Math]], worldwide [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]], [[Satsanga Ashrama]] of [[Deoghar]] and other religious organisations.

== Rashtriya panchang ==
The calculations of the almanac are fully done with the help of computers to show the accuracy of the renderings and, therefore, the timing of the [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]] and [[parvan (Hinduism)|parvan]] for occasions are free from any mistake. Hence the [[Indian national calendar]] (Rashtriya Panchang) published by the [[Government of India]] fully tallies with the almanac.

However, the traditional school also has its validity. Jyotish Shastra is not astronomy, and it is based on the words of Parashara, Garga, Mantreshwara who never used computers or western astronomy. Further, the planetary positions of Jyotish-nakshatra, rashi-or rahu, Ketu etc. depend more on belief and assumptions than science.

==Contents==
''Vishuddha Siddhanta Panjika'' provides articles on [[astrology]] and [[astronomy]]; annual predictions for the nation on subjects ranging from [[agriculture]] to [[politics]]; predictions on individual [[lagnas]]; and annual predictions on the basis of birth-stars. There are other regular sections like [[Jyotiṣa|vedic]] months and dates from the [[Indian national calendar]].

Daily declination of the Sun, equation of time, [[sidereal time]], planetary aspects, correct times of the [[eclipses]], rising and setting times of the moon in different places, rising and setting times of the sun in [[Kolkata]] and seven other cities, monthly description of the night sky and locations of the [[star]]s and [[planets]] with explanatory [[sky maps]] are given. The dates of the main celebrations for the coming year are mentioned. An important addition is the dates of birth and death of many savants and saints of India irrespective of denominational adherence.

[[File:CeciliaCheung MadameTussauds.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A typical modern wax sculpture of [[Cecilia Cheung]] at [[Madame Tussauds Hong Kong]].]]
[[File:Satyajit Ray at Mother's Wax Museum, Calcutta.jpg|alt=Satyajit Ray at Mother's Wax Museum, Calcutta|thumb|Satyajit Ray at Mother's Wax Museum, Calcutta]]
A '''wax museum''' or '''waxworks''' usually consists of a collection of [[wax sculpture]]s representing famous people from history and contemporary personalities exhibited in lifelike poses, wearing real clothes.

Some wax [[museum]]s have a special section dubbed the "[[Chamber of Horrors (Madame Tussauds)|Chamber of Horrors]]", in which the more grisly exhibits are displayed. Some collections are more specialized, as, for example, collections of wax medical models once used for training medical professionals. Many museums or displays in historical houses that are not wax museums as such use wax figures as part of their displays. The origin of wax museums goes back to the early 18th century at least, and wax funeral [[effigies]] of royalty and some other figures exhibited by their tombs had essentially been tourist attractions well before that.

==History before 1800==
[[File:Elizabeth of york - funeral effigy.jpg|thumb|left|The funeral effigy (without clothes) of [[Elizabeth of York]], mother of [[King Henry VIII]], 1503, [[Westminster Abbey]]]]
The making of life-size wax figures wearing real clothes grew out of the funeral practices of European royalty. In the [[Middle Ages]] it was the habit to carry the corpse, fully dressed, on top of the coffin at royal funerals, but this sometimes had unfortunate consequences in hot weather, and the custom of making an [[effigy]] in wax for this role grew, again wearing actual clothes so that only the head and hands needed wax models. After the funeral these were often displayed by the tomb or elsewhere in the church, and became a popular attraction for visitors, which it was often necessary to pay to view.&lt;ref name="westminster-abbey.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/royals/funerals|title=Royals|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum of [[Westminster Abbey]] in London has a collection of British royal wax effigies going back to that of [[Edward III of England]] (died 1377), as well as those of figures such as the naval hero [[Horatio Nelson]], and [[Frances Stewart, Duchess of Richmond]], who also had her parrot stuffed and displayed. From the funeral of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1680 they were no longer placed on the coffin but were still made for later display.&lt;ref name="westminster-abbey.org"/&gt; The effigy of Charles II, open-eyed and standing, was displayed over his tomb until the early 19th century, when all the Westminster effigies were removed from the abbey itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/users/node/6623|title=The page you were looking for doesn't exist (404)|website=www.vam.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson's effigy was a pure tourist attraction, commissioned the year after his death in 1805, and his burial not in the Abbey but in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] after a government decision that major public figures should in future be buried there. Concerned for their revenue from visitors, the Abbey decided it needed a rival attraction for admirers of Nelson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/horatio,-viscount-nelson Westminster Abbey, "Horatio, Viscount Nelson"].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cabinet de cire, Musée de la Révolution française.jpg|thumb|Wax museum in 1792 with the three fathers of the French Revolution, [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]], [[Voltaire]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], installed at [[Elysium]].&lt;br&gt;([[musée de la Révolution française]])]]
In European courts including that of France the making of posed wax figures became popular. [[Antoine Benoist]] (1632–1717) was a French court painter and sculptor in wax to [[King Louis XIV]]. He exhibited forty-three [[wax]] figures of the French ''Royal Circle'' at his residence in Paris. Thereafter, the king authorized the figurines to be shown throughout France. His work became so highly regarded that [[James II of England]] invited him to visit [[England]] in 1684. There he executed works of the English king and members of his court. A seated figure of [[Peter the Great]] of Russia survives, made by an Italian artist, after the Tsar was impressed by the figures he saw at the [[Chateau of Versailles]]. The Danish court painter [[Johann Salomon Wahl]] executed figures of the Danish king and queen in about 1740.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Moving Wax Works of the Royal Court of England', a museum or exhibition of 140 life-size figures, some apparently with clockwork moving parts, opened by Mrs Mary in [[Fleet Street]] in London was doing excellent business in 1711. [[Philippe Curtius]], waxwork modeller to the French court, opened his ''Cabinet de Cire'' as a tourist attraction in Paris in 1770, which remained open until 1802. In 1783 this added a ''Caverne des Grandes Voleurs'' ("Cave of the Great Thieves"), an early "Chamber of Horrors". He bequeathed his collection to his protegé [[Marie Tussaud]], who during the [[French Revolution]] made [[death mask]]s of the executed royals.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 37-38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable wax museums==
[[Madame Tussauds]], historically associated with [[London]], is the most famous name associated with wax museums, although it was not the earliest wax museum, as is sometimes thought. In 1835 Madame Tussaud established her first permanent exhibition in [[London]]'s [[Baker Street]]. By the late 19th century most large cities had some kind of commercial wax museum, like the [[Musée Grévin]] in Paris or the [[Panoptikum Hamburg]], and for a century these remained highly popular. In the late 20th century it became harder for them to compete with other attractions.

Today there are also Madame Tussauds in [[Dam Square]], [[Amsterdam]]; [[Berlin]]; [[Madame Tussauds Hong Kong]]; [[Shanghai]]; and five locations in the [[United States]]: the [[The Venetian (Las Vegas)|Venetian Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas, Nevada]], [[Times Square]] in [[New York City]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf]] in [[San Francisco]] and [[Hollywood]].

Louis Tussaud's wax museum in [[San Antonio, Texas]], is across the street from the historic [[Alamo]]. Others are located on the Canadian side of [[Niagara Falls]], and [[Grand Prairie, Texas]].

One of the most popular wax museums in the United States for decades was The [[Movieland Wax Museum]] in [[Buena Park, California]], near [[Knott's Berry Farm]]. The museum opened in 1962 and through the years added many wax figures of famous show business figures. Several stars attended the unveilings of the wax incarnations. The museum closed its doors on October 31, 2005, after years of dwindling attendance.

However, the most enduring museum in the United States is the [[Hollywood Wax Museum]] located in [[Hollywood, California]] which features almost exclusively figures of movie actors displayed in settings associated with their roles in popular movies. This group of museums includes [[Hollywood Wax Museum Branson]] in [[Branson, Missouri]] along with [[Hollywood Wax Museum Pigeon Forge]] in [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee]] and [[Hollywood Wax Museum Myrtle Beach]] in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]. With the original location having been developed in the mid-1960s, the most recent reports suggest that this group of museums is experiencing brisk business with the Branson location having undergone a substantial expansion and remodeling in 2008 and 2009 including an animated ride and a mirror maze.

Another popular wax museum is the Musée Conti Wax Museum in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], which features wax figures portraying the city's history as well as a "Haunted Dungeon" section of wax figures of famous characters from horror films and literature. This museum is currently closed as the Conti building is being converted into condos. The museum should reopen at Jazzland Theme Park some time in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wgno.com/2016/07/19/the-musee-conti-wax-museum-plans-to-move-to-the-new-jazzland-theme-park-eventually/|title=The Musee Conti Wax Museum plans to move to the new Jazzland theme park – eventually|date=20 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular wax museum in the U.S. is the [[Wax Museum at Fisherman's Wharf]] in [[San Francisco, California]].

[[BibleWalk]] is a Christian wax museum in [[Mansfield, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="contact"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblewalk.us/contact/|title=About Us|website=BibleWalk|access-date=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb6y53pdN4M |title=Biblewalk Wax Museum |date=July 2, 2010 |website=[[YouTube]]|access-date=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has received attention for its use of celebrity wax figures in its religious scenes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/11802032/Wax-figures-of-British-royals-appear-at-US-Biblical-museum.html |title=Wax figures of British royals appear at US Biblical museum |last=Lawler |first=David |date=August 13, 2015 |website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |publisher= |access-date=May 22, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; originally a cost-saving measure when new wax figures were deemed too expensive.&lt;ref name="contact" /&gt;

The [[Royal London Wax Museum]] was open in downtown [[Victoria, British Columbia]], Canada, from 1970 to 2010 in the Steamship Terminal building, it featured "royalty to rogues and the renowned." It was forced to close when the building required seismic upgrades.

The [[National Wax Museum (Ireland)|National Wax Museum]] in [[Dublin]], Ireland is a wax museum which hosts well over a hundred figures. For many years it has had only one sculptor, PJ Heraty, who continued producing figures even while the museum was closed. Meanwhile, it could be re-opened at a new location. During the last few years some other new wax museums are starting around the world. In 2009 Dreamland Wax Museum opened in Gramado, in the south of Brazil.

[[The National Presidential Wax Museum]] in Keystone, South Dakota is the only wax museum in the world to feature every U.S. President. Their exhibits also include other notable figures from history such as General George Custer, Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, and Sitting Bull. Originally created by the famed sculptress Katherine Stubergh, the museum includes death and life masks of notable Hollywood celebrities including Mae West Sid Grauman. Their most revered exhibit is a depiction of George W. Bush standing on the rubble of the World Trade Center with NYFD fireman Bob Beckwith following the attacks on September 11, 2001.

==In India==
India's first wax museum opened in December 2005 in Kanyakumari. Now located to Lonavala it contains 100 wax statues of celebrities at Lonavala Square Mall. The biggest in India wax museum named [[Mother's Wax Museum]] was opened in November 2014 in [[Rajarhat|New Town, Kolkata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Amitabh-Bachchan-and-Shah-Rukh-Khans-wax-statues-at-Kolkatas-wax-museum/articleshow/45022680.cms|title=Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan's wax statues at Kolkata's wax museum - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another branch opened in July 2008 at the historical site of Old Goa with a collection of religious statues.

A wax museum on musicians and musical instruments named "Melody World" opened at Mysore in October 2010.

A wax museum opened at Jaipur, Rajasthan in 18 December 2016.

[[Madame Tussauds]] opened its first museum in India at New Delhi in 2017.

'''Whiteleg shrimp''' (''Litopenaeus vannamei'', formerly ''Penaeus vannamei''), also known as '''Pacific white shrimp''' or '''king prawn''', is a variety of [[Dendrobranchiata|prawn]] of the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] commonly caught or farmed for [[food]].

==Description==

==Distribution and habitat==
Whiteleg shrimp are native to the eastern Pacific Ocean, from the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Sonora]]  to as far south as northern [[Peru]].&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/species/3404/en |work=Species Fact Sheets |title=''Penaeus vannamei'' (Boone, 1931) |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is restricted to areas where the water temperatures remain above {{convert|20|C|F}} throughout the year.&lt;ref name="CASIP"/&gt;

During the 20th century, ''L.&amp;nbsp;vannamei'' was an important species for Mexican [[inshore]] fishermen, as well as for [[Fishing trawler|trawler]]s further offshore.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; In the late 20th century, the wild fishery was overtaken by the use of [[aquaculture]]; this began in 1973 in [[Florida]] using prawns captured in [[Panama]].&lt;ref name="CASIP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/culturedspecies/Litopenaeus_vannamei/en |work=Cultured Aquatic Species Information Programme |title=''Penaeus vannamei'' (Boone, 1931) |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin America, the culture of ''L.&amp;nbsp;vannamei'' showed peaks of production during the warm [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]] years, and reduced production during the cooler [[La Niña]] years, due to the effects of disease.&lt;ref name="CASIP"/&gt; Production of ''L.&amp;nbsp;vannamei'' is limited by its susceptibility to various diseases, including [[white spot syndrome]], [[Taura syndrome]], [[infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis]], [[baculoviral midgut gland necrosis]], and ''[[Vibrio]]'' infections.&lt;ref name="CASIP"/&gt; By 2004, global production of ''L.&amp;nbsp;vannamei'' approached 1,116,000&amp;nbsp;t, and exceeded that of ''[[Penaeus monodon]]''.&lt;ref name="CASIP"/&gt;

In 2010, [[Greenpeace]] International has added the whiteleg shrimp to its seafood red list. This lists fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from [[Unsustainable fishing methods|unsustainable fisheries]].&lt;ref name="redlist"&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood Greenpeace International Seafood Red list]&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons given by Greenpeace were "destruction of vast areas of [[mangroves]] in several countries, overfishing of juvenile shrimp from the wild to supply [[shrimp farm]]s, and significant [[human rights abuses]]".&lt;ref name=redlist/&gt;

&lt;!--not encyclopedic how-to ==Aquarium trade==
In the saltwater [[reef aquarium]], young ''P. vannamei'' shrimp can be used as live food for fish and invertebrates, particularly to entice picky eaters to start eating in a new tank. It is often added to the aquarium's refugium to allow aquarists to easily raise the shrimp as food in the main display tank.
