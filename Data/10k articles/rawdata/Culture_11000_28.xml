'''[[Afrocentric]] [[education]]''' is designed to empower peoples of the [[African diaspora]]. A central premise behind it is that many Africans have been subjugated by limiting their awareness of themselves and indoctrinating them with ideas that work against them.&lt;ref&gt;Woodson, Dr. Carter G. (1933). ''The Mis-Education of the Negro''. Khalifah's Booksellers &amp; Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Akbar, Dr. Na'im.(1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Paulo Freire|educational leaders of other cultures]], proponents assert that what educates one group of people does not necessarily educate and empower another group, so they assert educational priorities distinctly for the ''Africans'' in a given context.

==Philosophy==
Afrocentric education has, as one of its tenets, the decolonization of the African mind. The central objective in decolonizing the African mind is to overthrow the authority that alien traditions may exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Chinweizu (1987). ''Decolonizing the African Mind'', Sundoor Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Education was understood to be a process of harnessing the inner potential, and thus it is imperative to equip the youth with an awareness of their identity. The term "miseducation" was coined by Dr. [[Carter G. Woodson]] to describe the process of systematically depriving [[African American]]s of their knowledge of self. Dr. Woodson believed that miseducation was the root of the problems of the masses of the African-American community and that if the masses of the African-American community were given the correct knowledge and education from the beginning, they would not be in the situation that they find themselves in today. Dr. Woodson argues in his book ''[[The Mis-Education of the Negro]]'' that African Americans often valorize European culture to the detriment of their own culture.

The problem concerning formal education is seen by Afrocentrists to be that African students are taught to perceive the world through the eyes of another culture, and unconsciously learn to see themselves as an insignificant part of their world.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} An Afrocentric education does not necessarily wish to isolate Africans from a Eurocentric education system but wishes to assert the autonomy of Africans and encompass the cultural uniqueness of all learners.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

A school based on African values, it is believed, would eliminate the patterns of rejection and alienation that engulf so many African-American school children, especially males. The movement for African-centered education is based on the assumption that a school immersed in African traditions, rituals, values, and symbols will provide a learning environment that is more congruent with the lifestyles and values of African-American families.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==History==
This has been an active area of [[Afrocentrism]] for many decades.

===19th and early 20th century===
[[Edward Wilmot Blyden]], an [[Americo-Liberian]] educator and diplomat active in the [[Pan-Africanism|pan-Africa]] movement, perceived a change in perception taking place among Europeans towards Africans in his 1908 book ''African Life and Customs'', which originated as a series of articles in the [[Sierra Leone]] ''Weekly News''.&lt;ref name="alc"&gt;{{cite book |last=Blyden |first=Edward Wilmot |authorlink=Edward Wilmot Blyden |coauthors= |title=African Life and Customs |publisher=Black Classic Press |date=1 March 1994 |isbn=978-0-933121-43-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he proposed that Africans were beginning to be seen simply as different and not as inferior, in part because of the work of English writers such as [[Mary Kingsley]] and [[Flora Shaw|Lady Lugard]], who traveled and studied in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Blyden, ''African Life and Customs'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such an enlightened view was fundamental to refute prevailing ideas among Western peoples about African cultures and Africans.

Blyden used that standpoint to show how the traditional social, industrial, and economic life of Africans untouched by "either European or Asiatic influence", was different and complete in itself, with its own organic wholeness.&lt;ref&gt;Blyden, ''African Life and Customs'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter responding to Blyden's original series of articles, [[Fante people|Fante]] journalist and politician [[J. E. Casely Hayford]] commented, "It is easy to see the men and women who walked the banks of the [[Nile]]" passing him on the streets of [[Kumasi]].&lt;ref&gt;Blyden, ''African Life and Customs'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hayford suggested building a university to preserve African identity and instincts. In that university, the history chair would teach
{{cquote|Universal history, with particular reference to the part [[Ethiopia]] has played in the affairs of the world. I would lay stress upon the fact that while [[Ramses II]] was dedicating temples to 'the God of gods, and secondly to his own glory,' the [[Yahweh|God of the Hebrews]] had not yet appeared unto [[Moses]] in the burning bush; that Africa was the cradle of the world's systems and philosophies, and the nursing mother of its religions. In short, that Africa has nothing to be ashamed of in its place among the nations of the earth. I would make it possible for this seat of learning to be the means of revising erroneous current ideas regarding the African; of raising him in self-respect; and of making him an efficient co-worker in the uplifting of man to nobler effort.&lt;ref&gt;Blyden, ''African Life and Customs'', p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}
The exchange of ideas between Blyden and Hayford embodied the fundamental concepts of Afrocentrism.

In the United States, during the early 20th century and the [[Harlem Renaissance]], many writers and historians gathered in major cities, where they began to work on documenting achievements of Africans throughout history, in United States and Western life. They began to set up institutions to support scholarly work in African-American history and literature, such as the American Negro Academy (now the Black Academy of Letters and Arts), founded in [[Washington, DC]], in 1874.  Some men were self-taught; others rose through the academic system. Creative writers and artists claimed space for African-American perspectives.

Leaders included bibliophile [[Arthur Schomburg]], who devoted his life to collecting literature, art, slave narratives, and other artifacts of the [[African diaspora]]. In 1911, along with [[John Edward Bruce]], he founded the Negro Society for Historical Research in [[Yonkers, New York]].  The value of Schomburg's personal collection was recognized, and it was purchased by the [[New York Public Library]] in 1926 with the aid of a [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Corporation]] grant.  It became the basis of what is now called the [[Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture]], based in [[Harlem, New York]]. Schomburg used the money from the sale of his collection for more travel and acquisition of materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/research/sc/sc.html NYPL, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207083811/http://nypl.org/research/sc/sc.html |date=7 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hubert Henry Harrison]] used his intellectual gifts in street lectures and political activism, influencing early generations of Black Socialists and Black Nationalists.  Dr. [[Carter G. Woodson]] co-founded the [[Association for the Study of African American Life and History]] (as it is now called) in 1915, as well as ''[[The Journal of Negro History]]'', so that scholars of black history could be supported and find venues for their work.

Among their topics, editors of publications such as [[NAACP]]'s ''[[The Crisis]]'' and  ''Journal of Negro History'' sought to include articles that countered the prevailing view that Sub-Saharan Africa had contributed little of value to human history that was not the result of incursions by Europeans and [[Arab]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"The African Origin of the Grecian Civilisation", ''Journal of Negro History'', 1917, pp. 334-344.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians began to theorize that Ancient Egyptian civilization was the culmination of events arising from the origin of the human race in Africa. They investigated the history of Africa from that perspective.

In March 1925, Schomburg published an essay "The Negro Digs Up His Past" in an issue of the ''Survey Graphic'' devoted to Harlem's intellectual life.  The article had widespread distribution and influence, as he detailed the achievements of people of African descent.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schomburg, [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/harlem/SchNegrF.html "The Negro Digs Up His Past"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219225428/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/harlem/SchNegrF.html |date=19 February 2009 }}, ''The Survey Graphic'', Harlem: March 1925, University of Virginia Library, accessed 2 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alain Locke]] included the essay in his collection ''[[The New Negro]]''.

Afrocentrists claimed ''[[The Mis-Education of the Negro]]'' (1933) by [[Carter G. Woodson]], an African-American historian, as one of their foundational texts. Woodson critiqued education of African Americans as "mis-education" because he held that it denigrated the black while glorifying the white. For these early Afrocentrists, the goal was to break what they saw as a vicious cycle of the reproduction of black self-abnegation.  In the words of ''The Crisis'' editor [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], the world left African Americans with a "double consciousness," and a sense of "always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity."&lt;ref name="BlackAesthetics"&gt;Tejumola Olaniyan, [http://www.westafricareview.com/issue9/olaniyan2.html "From Black Aesthetics to Afrocentrism"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303111022/http://www.westafricareview.com/issue9/olaniyan2.html |date=3 March 2009 }}, ''West Africa Review'', Issue 9 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early years,  W. E. B. Du Bois, researched [[West Africa]]n cultures and attempted to construct a [[pan-Africanism|pan-Africanist]] value system based on West African traditions. In the 1950s Du Bois envisioned and received funding from [[Ghana]]ian president [[Kwame Nkrumah]] to produce an ''[[Encyclopedia Africana]]'' to chronicle the history and cultures of Africa.  Du Bois died before being able to complete his work. Some aspects of Du Bois's approach are evident in work by [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] in the 1950s and 1960s.

Du Bois inspired a number of authors, including [[Drusilla Dunjee Houston]]. After reading his work ''The Negro'' (1915), Houston embarked upon writing her ''Wonderful Ethiopians of the Ancient Cushite Empire'' (1926).  The book was a compilation of evidence related to the historic origins of [[Kingdom of Kush|Cush]] and Ethiopia, and assessed their influences on Greece.

===1960s and 1970s===
The 1960s and 1970s were times of social and political ferment. In the U.S. were born new forms of [[Black nationalism|Black Nationalism]], [[Black Power movement|Black Power]] and the [[Black Arts Movement|Black Arts Movements]], all began to be driven, to a degree, driven to some degree by an identification with "Mother Africa."  Afrocentric scholars and Black youth also challenged Eurocentric ideas in academia.

The work of [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] became very influential.  In the following decades, histories related to Africa and the diaspora gradually incorporated a more African perspective. Since that time, Afrocentrists have increasingly seen African peoples as the makers and shapers of their own histories.&lt;ref name="Africana"&gt;[[Henry Louis Gates]] and [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] (eds), ''[[Encyclopedia Africana|Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African-American]]'' Vol. 1, p. 114, Oxford University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-517055-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''You have all heard of the African Personality; of African democracy, of the African way to socialism, of [[negritude]], and so on. They are all props we have fashioned at different times to help us get on our feet again. Once we are up we shan't need any of them any more. But for the moment it is in the nature of things that we may need to counter racism with what [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] has called an anti-racist racism, to announce not just that we are as good as the next man but that we are much better.''
&lt;br /&gt;—Chinua Achebe, 1965&lt;ref&gt;[[Chinua Achebe]], ''The Novelist as Teacher'', 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this context, ethnocentric Afrocentrism was not intended to be essential or permanent, but was a consciously fashioned strategy of resistance to the Eurocentrism of the time.&lt;ref name="BlackAesthetics"/&gt; Afrocentric scholars adopted two approaches: a deconstructive rebuttal of what they called "the whole archive of European ideological racism" and a reconstructive act of writing new self-constructed histories.&lt;ref name="BlackAesthetics"/&gt;

At a 1974 UNESCO symposium in Cairo titled "The Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Decipherment of Meroitic Script", [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] brought together scholars of Egypt from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce G. Trigger, "The Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Decipherment of Meroitic Script: Proceedings of the Symposium Held in Cairo from 28 January to 3 February 1974 by UNESCO", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Vol. 13, No. 2 (1980), pp. 371-373.&lt;/ref&gt;

Key texts from this period include:

*''The Destruction of Black Civilization'' (1971) by Chancellor Williams
*''The African Origins of Civilization: Myth or Reality'' (1974) by Cheikh Anta Diop
*''They Came Before Columbus: The African Presence in Ancient America'' (1976) by Ivan Van Sertima

Some Afrocentric writers focused on study of indigenous African civilizations and peoples, to emphasize African history separate from European or [[Arab]] influence. Primary among them was  [[Chancellor Williams]], whose book  ''The Destruction of Black Civilization: Great Issues of a Race from 4500 B.C. to 2000 A.D.'' set out to determine a "purely African body of principles, value systems (and) philosophy of life".&lt;ref&gt;''The Destruction of Black Civilization: Great Issues of a Race from 4500 B.C. to 2000 A.D.'', 1987, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s and 1990s===
In the 1980s and 1990s, Afrocentrism increasingly became seen as a tool for addressing social ills and a means of grounding community efforts toward self-determination and political and economic empowerment.

In his (1992) article "Eurocentrism vs. Afrocentrism", US anthropologist Linus A. Hoskins wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The vital necessity for African people to use the weapons of education and history to extricate themselves from this psychological dependency complex/syndrome as a necessary precondition for liberation. [...] If African peoples (the global majority) were to become Afrocentric (Afrocentrized), ... that would spell the ineluctable end of European global power and dominance. This is indeed the fear of Europeans. ... Afrocentrism is a state of mind, a particular subconscious mind-set that is rooted in the ancestral heritage and communal value system.&lt;ref&gt;Linus A. Hoskins, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2784533 "Eurocentrism vs. Afrocentrism: A Geopolitical Linkage Analysis"], ''[[Journal of Black Studies]]'' (1992), pp. 249, 251, 253.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

American educator [[Jawanza Kunjufu]] made the case that [[hip hop]] culture, rather than being creative expression of the culture, was the root of many social ills.&lt;ref&gt;Jawanza Kunjufu, ''Hip-Hop vs MAAT:  A Psycho/Social Analysis of Values'', 1993. {{ISBN|978-0913543320}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For some Afrocentrists, the contemporary problems of the [[ghetto]] stemmed not from race and class inequality, but rather from a failure to inculcate Black youth with Afrocentric values.&lt;ref name="AchievingBlackness"&gt;Algernon Austin, ''Achieving Blackness: Race, Black Nationalism, and Afrocentrism''.  {{ISBN|0-8147-0707-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the West and elsewhere, the European, in the midst of other peoples, has often propounded an exclusive view of reality; the exclusivity of this view creates a fundamental human crisis.  In some cases, it has created cultures arrayed against each other or even against themselves.  Afrocentricity’s response certainly is not to impose its own particularity as a universal, as Eurocentricity has often done.  But hearing the voice of African American culture with all of its attendant parts is one way of creating a more sane society and one model for a more humane world. –Asante, M. K. (1988)&lt;ref&gt;Asante, M. K. (1988), ''Afrocentricity''. Trenton, NJ: Africa World Press Inc., p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1997, US cultural historian Nathan Glazer described Afrocentricity as a form of multiculturalism.  He wrote that its influence ranged from sensible proposals about inclusion of more African material in school curricula to what he called senseless claims about African primacy in all major technological achievements. Glazer argued that Afrocentricity had become more important due to the failure of mainstream society to assimilate all African Americans.  Anger and frustration at their continuing separation gave black Americans the impetus to reject traditions that excluded them.&lt;ref name="Glazer1997"&gt;Nathan Glazer, ''We Are All Multiculturalists Now'', Harvard University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-674-94836-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
Today, Afrocentricity takes many forms, including striving for a more multicultural and balanced approach to the study of history and sociology. Afrocentrists contend that race still exists as a [[social construct|social]] and political construct.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, ''Achieving Blackness'', p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that for centuries in academia, Eurocentric ideas about history were dominant: ideas such as blacks having no civilizations, no [[written language]]s, no cultures, and no histories of any note before coming into contact with Europeans. Further, according to the views of some Afrocentrists, European history has commonly received more attention within the academic community than the history of sub-Saharan African cultures or those of the many Pacific Island peoples. Afrocentrists contend it is important to divorce the historical record from past racism. [[Molefi Kete Asante]]'s book ''Afrocentricity'' (1988) argues that African-Americans should look to African cultures "''as a critical corrective to a displaced agency among Africans''." Some Afrocentrists believe that the burden of Afrocentricity is to define and develop African agency in the midst of the [[Culture war|cultural wars]] debate.  By doing so, Afrocentricity can support all forms of multiculturalism.&lt;ref name=Teasley2007&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afrocentrists argue that Afrocentricity is important for people of all ethnicities who want to understand African history and the [[African diaspora]]. For example, the Afrocentric method can be used to research African indigenous culture. Queeneth Mkabela writes in 2005 that the Afrocentric perspective provides new insights for understanding African indigenous culture, in a multicultural context. According to Mkabela  and others, the Afrocentric method is a necessary part of complete scholarship and without it, the picture is incomplete, less accurate, and less objective.&lt;ref&gt;Queeneth Mkabela, "Using the Afrocentric Method in Researching Indigenous African Culture", ''The Qualitative Report'', Vol. 10, No. 1, March 2005, pp. 178–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of African and African-diaspora cultures have shifted understanding and created a more positive acceptance of influence by African religious, linguistic and other traditions, both among scholars and the general public. For example, religious movements such as [[West African Vodun|Vodou]] are now less likely to be characterized as "mere superstition", but understood in terms of links to African traditions.

In recent years [[Africana Studies]] or Africology&lt;ref&gt;Gates and Appiah, ''Encyclopedia Africana'', Vol. 1, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; departments at many major universities have grown out of the Afrocentric "Black Studies" departments formed in the 1970s. Rather than focusing on black topics in the African diaspora (often exclusively African American topics), these reformed departments aim to expand the field to encompass all of the African diaspora. They also seek to better align themselves with other University departments and find continuity and compromise between the radical Afrocentricity of the past decades and the [[multicultural]] scholarship found in many fields today.&lt;ref&gt;Delores P. Aldridge, Carlene Young. ''Out of the Revolution: The Development of Africana Studies'', Lexington Books, 2000. {{ISBN|0-7391-0547-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

African Centered Leadership-Fellowship (ACL-F)
2000

Dr. Uhuru Hotep, co-director of the Kwame Ture Leadership Institute, established an ethnocentric approach to leadership specifically based on the four principles of restoration of sovereignty, Sankofa, Maat restoration, and Johari Sita installation.

Restoration of sovereignty is a concept that surrounds cultural, political and economic entities of society. Sovereignty is synyonmous with self-determination. In the tradition of a self-sufficient creation of communities, seshemet (leadership) was developed to restore the Moroon tradition of kilombo construction.

Sankofa is a leadership technique of Ghana that emphasizes living in the present to learn from the past. This concept requires its followers to learn about the contributions of their ancestral leaders and to continue with their struggles. It mandates that African centered leaders reconnect with their ancestors.

Maat restoration is a collaboration of the central themes of truth, justice, order, harmony, balance, reciprocity and propriety. which is based on the teachings of ancient Kemet. This concept is characterized by the restoring of public confidence and the promotion of psychological and fiscal prosperity among the leaders and their followers.

Johari Sita is a multifaceted Afrocentric approach to leadership-followership development. It can best be described as the processes, procedures and practices of ACL-F. This model of leadership is the foundation for nationwide workshops called "Preparing African Youth for 21st Century Leadership and Service."

The internal loci of control for Africa centered leaders and followers are contrary to the political and financial dependency of followers of external loci of control of many mainstream middle class Black American leadership practices.

== Plot ==

In a cabin by Cutter's Creek, three bank robbers are murdered by an axe-wielding [[mountain man]]. Later, a group of friends, led by Brian, are brought to the same cabin by a guide, who is apprehensive about being in the area. After settling in, Brian mentions that the reason he got the cabin for such a low price is because it supposedly once belonged to a family that was massacred by the Axeman, an unidentified serial killer whose reign of terror ended as mysteriously as it started. When the discussion concludes, Randy goes off to spy on Vivian, and is murdered by the Axeman, who rips his head off.

The next morning, Doug gets into an argument with his girlfriend, Cassidy, accusing her of still having feelings for her ex, Brian, who is now dating Cassidy's best friend, Stacy. Doug storms off into the woods, where he stumbles onto the money that the bank robbers stole. While looking for somewhere to hide the cash, Doug is impaled and dismembered by the Axeman, his death going unnoticed by his friends, who are searching for Randy. Everyone soon regroups at the cabin, and Cassidy, unsatisfied with every explanation that they can come up with for why Randy, and now Doug, are gone, leaves to continue searching for them alone.

Tammy enters the garage, where she uncovers the robbers' money, and is forced to hide when the Axeman enters with her girlfriend, Liz, who he has fatally wounded. Before he can finish Liz off, the Axeman is distracted by a knock on the door, and answers it to reveal it is the sheriff, who he identifies himself to as "Bill". Annoyed by the sheriff's abrasive attitude and persistent questioning, Bill twists her head around, and returns to the garage, just as Tammy exits it with Liz. Liz succumbs to her injuries, and Tammy is strangled by Bill, who also bites off and eats her cheeks.

Returning to the cabin, Bill rips Brian's brain out, knifes Vivian in the eye, beats Darren nearly to death, and chases Stacy through the property, catching and stabbing her when she trips over Cassidy's body. In the morning, the [[Hangover|hungover]] Deputy Whitfield ventures to the cabin in search of the sheriff, and finds Darren, who begs her for help. Before Darren can elaborate on what happened, Bill attacks him and Whitfield.

== Reception ==

''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' panned the film overall, criticizing the script for not delving into the reasons that the titular Axeman was killing people, as this would give the film more depth and differentiate it from multiple similarly plotted films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Patrick|title=''Axeman'' Is a Shallow, Frustrating Slasher|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3292428/bd-review-axeman/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theron Moore of Horror News praised the film's villain and kills, but criticized the glacial pace, uninteresting subplots, stiff acting, and two-dimensional dialogue and writing.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://horrornews.net/85844/film-review-axeman-cutters-creek-2013/|title = Film Review: ''Axeman at Cutter's Creek'' (2013)|last = Moore|first = Theron|publisher = Horror News|date = 22 June 2014|website = horrornews.net|accessdate = 6 January 2015}} &lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Ain't It Cool News]]'' gave a mostly favorable review for ''Axeman'', commenting that while the movie was not "reinventing the slasher genre" it "does feel like a throwback to a time when the slashers weren't so passé."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AICN HORROR has advance reviews of MEET ME THERE!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4297">The term '''Caledonian Antisyzygy''' refers to the "idea of dueling polarities within one entity",&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Maureen M. (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=5HZYPW17S34C&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22caledonian+antisyzygy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gnwUTK7pGdKbOIaxoK4M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAzgo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22caledonian%20antisyzygy&amp;f=false Maureen M. ''The Mighty Scot'', p. 84].&lt;/ref&gt; thought of as typical for the Scottish psyche and literature. It was first coined by [[George Gregory Smith|G. Gregory Smith]] in his 1919 book ''Scottish Literature: Character and Influence''&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, Gerard. (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=hHUQTMtwRFkC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22caledonian+antisyzygy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BnYUTK2JHp-UOMSuyLMM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22caledonian%20antisyzygy&amp;f=false ''Scottish Literature'', p. 11].&lt;/ref&gt; in which he wrote:

&lt;!--Quote needs to be either paraphrased or summarised.--&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;the literature [of Scotland] is the literature of a small country... it runs a shorter course than others... in this shortness and cohesion the most favourable conditions seem to be offered for a making of a general estimate. But on the other hand, we find at closer scanning that the cohesion at least in formal expression and in choice of material is only apparent, that the literature is remarkably varied, and that it becomes, under the stress of foreign influence, almost a zigzag of contradictions. The antithesis need not, however, disconcert us. Perhaps in the very combination of opposites—what either of the two Thomases, [[Thomas Browne|of Norwich]] and [[Thomas Urquhart|Cromarty]], might have been willing to call "'''the Caledonian antisyzygy'''"—we have a reflection of the contrasts which the Scot shows at every turn, in his political and ecclesiastical history, in his polemical restlessness, in his adaptability, which is another way of saying that he has made allowance for new conditions, in his practical judgement, which is the admission that two sides of the matter have been considered. If therefore, Scottish history and life are, as an old northern writer said of something else, 'varied with a clean contrair spirit', we need not be surprised to find that in his literature the Scot presents two aspects which appear contradictory. Oxymoron was ever the bravest figure, and we must not forget that disorderly order is order after all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The poet [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] elaborated on the concept in his essay, ''The Caledonian Antisyzygy and the Gaelic Idea'', published in two parts in ''The Modern Scot'' 1931–1932. The notion is most frequently cited in reference to the seemingly morally contradictory quality of the works of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] (''Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde'') and [[James Hogg]] (''The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner''), but is also applied to contrasts between the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] and the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]], Protestantism and Catholicism, Britishness and Scottishness, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Dobson and [[Glenn Hook|Glenn D. Hook]]. (1993).

{{Rights}}
The '''cultural rights''' movement has provoked attention to protect the rights of groups of people, or their [[culture]], in similar fashion to the manner in which the [[human rights]] movement has brought attention to the needs of individuals throughout the world.

==Protecting a culture==
Cultural Rights are rights related to art and culture, both understood in a large sense. The objective of these rights is to guarantee that people and communities have an access to culture and can participate in the culture of their selection. Cultural rights are human rights that aim at assuring the enjoyment of culture and its components in conditions of equality, human dignity and non-discrimination. They are rights related to themes such as [[linguistic rights|language]]; cultural and artistic production; participation in cultural life; cultural heritage; intellectual property rights; [[cultural diversity|author’s rights]]; [[minority group|minorities]] and access to culture, among others. Focusing less on the preservation of cultures as an end in itself and more on the realization of "ecological" relations between cultural groups as a condition for equitable interactions and the potential for organic cultural change, Meyjes proposes the interchangeable terms cultural justice &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|1999|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|2012|p=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ethno-cultural justice&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|2012|pp=12, 381ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[intercultural justice]] — which he defines as the principle of maximally accommodating the culturally-specific values and practices of minority groups and their members, in the form of rights, within the overall legal, regulatory, or policy limits of the institution, community, or society concerned (also see [[universalization]]).

==Ethnic Groups Cultural preservation==
Cultural rights of groups focus on such things as religious and ethnic minorities and indigenous societies that are in danger of disappearing. Cultural rights include a group’s ability to preserve its way of life, such as child rearing, continuation of [[language]], and security of its economic base in the nation, which it is located. The related notion of indigenous '''''intellectual property rights''''' (IPR) has arisen in attempt to conserve each society’s culture base and essentially prevent [[ethnocide]].

The cultural rights movement has been popularized because much traditional cultural knowledge has commercial value, like ethno-medicine, cosmetics, cultivated plants, foods, [[folklore]], arts, crafts, songs, dances, costumes, and [[rituals]]. Studying ancient cultures may reveal evidence about the history of the human race and shed more light on our origin and successive cultural development. However, the study, sharing and commercialization of such cultural aspects can be hard to achieve without infringing upon the cultural rights of those who are a part of that culture.

Cultural rights should be taken into consideration also by local policies. In that sense, the [[Agenda 21 for culture]], the first document with worldwide mission that advocates establishing the groundwork of an undertaking by cities and local governments for cultural development, includes as cultural rights as one of the principles and states: “''Local governments recognize that cultural rights are an integral part of human rights, taking as their reference the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948)''”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agenda21culture.net Agenda 21 for culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural anthropology==
"Cultural rights are vested not in individuals but in groups, such as religious and ethnic [[minority group|minorities]] and [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] societies." All cultures are brought up differently, therefore cultural rights include a group's ability to preserve its culture, to raise its children in the ways it forebears, to continue its language, and to not be deprived of its economic base by the nation in which it is located." Anthropologists sometimes choose not to study some cultures beliefs and rights, because they believe that it may cause misbehavior, and they choose not to turn against different diversities of cultures. Although anthropologists sometimes do turn away from studying different cultures they still depend a lot on what they study at different archaeological sites.

{{Denmark culture}}

'''Danish art''' is the visual arts produced in [[Denmark]] or by Danish artists. It goes back thousands of years with significant artifacts from the 2nd millennium BC, such as the [[Trundholm sun chariot]].  For many early periods, it is usually considered as part of the wider [[Nordic art]] of [[Scandinavia]].  Art from what is today [[Denmark]] forms part of the art of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]], and then [[Norse art|Norse]] and [[Viking art]].  Danish medieval painting is almost entirely known from [[church frescos in Denmark|church frescos]] such as those from the 16th-century artist known as the [[Elmelunde Master]].

The Reformation greatly disrupted Danish artistic traditions, and left the existing body of painters and sculptors without large markets. The requirements of the court and aristocracy were mainly for portraits, usually by imported artists, and it was not until the 18th century that large numbers of Danes were trained in contemporary styles. For an extended period of time thereafter art in Denmark either was imported from Germany and the Netherlands or Danish artists studied abroad and produced work that was seldom inspired by Denmark itself. From the late 18th century on, the situation changed radically. Beginning with the [[Danish Golden Age]], a distinct tradition of Danish art began and has continued to flourish until today.  Due to generous art subsidies, contemporary Danish art has a big production per capita.

Though usually not especially a major centre for art production or exporter of art, Denmark has been relatively successful in keeping its art; in particular, the relatively mild nature of the [[Danish Reformation]], and the lack of subsequent extensive rebuilding and redecoration of churches, has meant that with other Scandinavian countries, Denmark has unusually rich survivals of medieval church paintings and fittings.  One period when Nordic art exerted a strong influence over the rest of northern Europe was in Viking art, and there are many survivals, both in stone monuments left untouched around the countryside, and objects excavated in modern times.

==Nordic Bronze Age==
[[File:Gundestrupkarret1.jpg|thumb|The Gundestrup cauldron]]
[[Lur]]s are a distinctive type of giant curving Bronze Age horn, of which 35 of the 53 known examples have been found in bogs in Denmark, very often in pairs.  They are normally made of bronze, and often decorated.

A possibly alien find in Denmark is the [[Gundestrup cauldron]], a richly decorated [[Silversmithery|silver vessel]], thought to date to the 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic-art/101803/112224/Gundestrup-Caldron-a-Celtic-ritual-vessel-1st-century-BC Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; It was found in 1891 in a [[peat bog]] near the hamlet of Gundestrup in north-eastern Jutland. The silversmithing of the plates is very skilled. The bowl, 70&amp;nbsp;cm across, was beaten from a single ingot.{{cn|date=December 2016}}  Now in the [[National Museum of Denmark]], it is the largest known example of European silver work from the period. The style and workmanship suggest [[Thracian]] origin, while the imagery seems [[Celtic art|Celtic]], so it may not reflect local styles.

==Norse art==
The [[Germanic Iron Age]] period of about 400-800 AD is represented by the [[Golden Horns of Gallehus]], now known only from drawings since they were stolen and melted down in 1802, and significant deposits from [[weapons sacrifice]] such as that at [[Illerup Ådal]], where 15,000 items were found, deposited during the period 200-500.

Danish sites have given their names to two of the six main styles of Viking or [[Norse art]], [[Jelling style]] (10th century) and its successor [[Mammen style]] (10-11th centuries), though the other styles are also represented in Denmark.  Only one Danish [[ship burial]] is known, from Ladbyskibet.  The images on the [[runestone]]s at [[Jelling stones|Jelling]] are probably the best known Danish works of the period.  Although little of their original paint remains today, copies of the largest stone in the [[National Museum of Denmark]] and in the museum at Jelling have been redecorated in vivid colours based on the fragments of paint which remained on the original.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emu.dk/gsk/fag/his/historie-kanon/jellingsten.html Jellingstenen - en del af historiekanonen.

==Renaissance to the 18th century==
[[File:Landschaft mit Nordlicht.jpg|thumb|left|''Landscape with Northern Lights - Attempt to Paint the Aurora Borealis'', 1790s, by [[Jens Juel (painter)|Jens Juel]].]]
Danish [[panel painting]] and painted [[wood-carving]] of the late Middle Ages was mostly by, or heavily influenced by, the prevailing North German styles, especially those of [[Hamburg]] and other [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities.  At the [[Protestant Reformation]] religious painting virtually ceased, and for a long period the most notable portraits of the royal family were made by foreign artists, such as [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]'s portrait of [[Christina of Denmark]]. [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s portrait of her father [[Christian II of Denmark]], painted in [[Brussels]] in 1521, has not survived, though portraits of him by other foreign artists have.

The establishment of the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1754 followed the general European pattern, and was intended to develop a national school and reduce the need to import artists from other countries.  After a period of development its pupils were indeed to lead the creation of a distinct Danish style.  After an architect, the third and fifth Director was [[Johannes Wiedewelt]] (1772–1777) and from (1780-1789), a [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] sculptor trained in Italy and France, who had followed his father as court sculptor, and is remembered for his memorials and garden decorations including the monument of [[Frederick V of Denmark|King Frederick V]] in [[Roskilde Cathedral]] and the Naval Monument in Holmens Cemetery.  The first painter to lead it was the Swedish-born [[Carl Gustaf Pilo]] (c. 1711 – 1793), a portraitist and history painter in the grand style, and the next [[Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard]] (1743–1809), himself an ex-student, who developed a [[Neoclassicism|Neo-Classical]] style.  Leading Danish artists teaching at the Academy included [[Christian August Lorentzen]] and [[Jens Juel (painter)|Jens Juel]], also later Director.  Unlike in England, for example, most leading Danish artists for at least the next century trained at the Academy and often returned to teach there, and the tension between [[academic art]] and other styles is much less a feature of Danish art history than that of France, England or other countries.
[[File:Thorvaldsens Ganymedes.jpg|thumb|''Ganymede and the Eagle'' by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]],  1817]]

A student of Abildgaard's period at the Academy was [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] (1770–1844), by far the most famous Danish sculptor, who along with the Italian [[Canova]] was recognised across Europe as the leading Neoclassical sculptor.  Among his works are the colossal series of statues of [[Jesus|Christ]] and the twelve [[Twelve apostles|Apostles]] for the rebuilding of [[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Vor Frue Kirke]] in Copenhagen. Motifs for his works (reliefs, statues, and busts) were drawn mostly from [[Greek mythology]], but he also created portraits of important personalities, as in his [[tomb monument]] for [[Pope Pius VII]] in [[St Peter's Basilica, Rome]]. His works can be seen in many European countries, but there is a very large collection at the [http://www.thorvaldsensmuseum.dk/ Thorvaldsen Museum] in Copenhagen.  He was based in Rome for many years, and played an important role in encouraging young Danish artists spending time in the city. Another important Neoclassicist produced by the Academy was the painter [[Asmus Jacob Carstens]], whose later career was all spent in Italy or Germany.

The establishment in 1775 of the [[Royal Copenhagen]] [[Porcelain]] Factory was another royal initiative, typical of monarchies in the period, though the business has outlasted the great majority of such factories, and survives today as part of a larger group, which also includes the [[Kosta Glasbruk]] glass company, founded in 1742 by two army officers, and the [[Orrefors Glasbruk]] (founded 1898), all known internationally.

==The Golden Age==
{{main|Danish Golden Age}}
[[File:C W Eckersberg 1841 - Kvinde foran et spejl.jpg|thumb|[[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]], ''Woman in front of a Mirror'', 1841. French Neo-Classicism transmuted into [[Biedermeier]] style.]]
Around the beginning of the 19th century the [[Golden Age of Danish Painting]] emerged to form a distinct national style for the first time since the Middle Ages; the period lasted until the middle of the 19th century.  It has a style drawing on [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], especially its [[landscape painting]],&lt;ref&gt;Dutch paintings, and landscapes, dominated in the 18th century Danish collections that we have records of. North, 308-9 [https://books.google.com/books?id=XGui9XJ3ObIC&amp;pg=PA309&amp;dq=Danish+Golden+Age+painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=a43wSteONozIyQTslY38AQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; and depicting northern light that is soft but allows strong contrasts of colour.  The treatment of scenes is typically an idealized version of reality, but unpretentiously so, appearing more [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] than is actually the case. Interior scenes, often small portrait groups, are also common, with a similar treatment of humble domestic objects and furniture, often of the artist's circle of friends.  Little Danish art was seen outside the country (indeed it mostly remains there to this day) and the Danish-trained leader of German Romantic painting [[Caspar David Friedrich]] was important in spreading its influence in Germany.

A crucial figure was [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]], who had studied in Paris with [[Jacques-Louis David]] and was further influenced towards [[Neo-Classicism]] by Thorwaldsen.  Eckersberg taught at the Academy from 1818 to 1853, becoming director from 1827 to 1828, and was an important influence on the following generation, in which landscape painting came to the fore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/eckersberginfo.shtm Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg.

*[[Wilhelm Bendz]] (1804–1832), remembered for his many technically accomplished portraits of fellow artists such as [[Ditlev Blunck]] and Christen Christensen, a scene from the Academy's anatomy class, as well as the group portraits "A Tobacco Party" and "Artist in the Evening at Finck's Coffee House in Munich";
*[[Constantin Hansen]] (1804–1880), deeply interested in [[literature]] and [[mythology]], and inspired by [[Niels Laurits Høyen]], he developed national [[history painting|historical painting]] based on [[Norse mythology]] and painted many portraits, including the historical The Constitutional Assembly (''Den grundlovgivende Rigsforsamling'');
*[[Christen Købke]] (1810–1848), influenced by [[Niels Laurits Høyen]], an art historian who promoted a nationalistic approach calling for artists to search for subject matter in the folk life of their country instead of searching for themes in other countries such as Italy;
*[[Wilhelm Marstrand]] (1810–1873), a vastly productive artist who mastered a remarkable variety of genres, remembered especially for a number of his works which have become familiar signposts of Danish history and culture: scenes from the drawing-rooms and streets of Copenhagen during his younger days; the festivity and public life captured in Rome; the many representative portraits of citizens and innovators; even the monumentalist commissions for universities and the monarchy;
*[[Martinus Rørbye]] (1803–1848), remembered for his [[genre painting]]s of Copenhagen, for his landscapes and for his [[architectural painting]]s, as well as for the many sketches he made during his travels to countries rarely explored at the time.
Among other artists, [[C.A. Jensen]] (1792–1870) specialized almost exclusively in portraits.

At the end of the period painting style, especially in landscape art, became caught up in the political issue of the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]], a vital matter for Danes, but notoriously impenetrable for most others in Europe.

==Later 19th century==
[[File:FrdrksbrgBySkovgaard.jpg|thumb|right|[[P.C. Skovgaard]]: Frederiksborg Palace]]
Danish painting continued many of the characteristics of the Golden Age, but gradually moved closer to styles of the rest of Europe, especially Germany.  Artists include:
*[[Jørgen Roed]] (1808–1888), who painted many portraits as well as a number of altarpieces and religious paintings, including ''Jesu Korsfæstelse'' (Crucifixion of Jesus) for the restored church at [[Frederiksborg Palace]];
[[File:Gethsemane Carl Bloch.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carl Heinrich Bloch|Carl Bloch]], ''Gethsemane'']]
*[[Johan Lundbye]] (1818–1848), remembered for his animal paintings and landscapes, especially those of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Sealand]] including the large ''Kystparti ved Isefjord'' (Coast View by Isefjord);
*[[P.C. Skovgaard]] (1817–1875), primarily known for his landscape paintings, for the special role he played in portraying Denmark’s nature, helping to develop a unique Danish art form, and his growing interest in portraying atmosphere and light.
[[Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann]] (1819–1881) was born in [[Żoliborz]] (Jolibord) a [[borough]] of [[Warsaw]] but moved to Denmark when she married Danish sculptor [[Jens Adolf Jerichau]] in 1846. She is best known for her portraits and was commissioned by the [[Danish Royal Family]] to paint their portraits to the annoyance and jealousy of local artists. The mild eroticism of a few of her paintings was looked upon unfavourably by many at the time but she remained aloof, perhaps reassured by the fact that some of her husband's sculptures were erotic in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Ellery Berg, (1884), ''The Drama, Painting, Poetry, and Song'', P.F. Collier, New York. digitized by Google.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Heinrich Bloch]] (1834–1890) was a rare Danish [[history painter]], mostly of Biblical subjects, who developed his [[academic art|academic]] style in Italy before returning to Copenhagen in 1866. He was commissioned to produce 23 paintings for the Chapel at [[Frederiksborg Palace]] consisting of scenes from the life of [[Christ]] which have become very popular as illustrations. For over 40 years [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has made much use of Carl Bloch's paintings, especially those from the Frederiksborg Palace collection, in its church buildings and printed media.

[[Edvard Eriksen]] (1876–1959) is best known as the sculptor of the bronze ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|Little Mermaid]]'' statue in [[Copenhagen]]. Based on the story by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], he completed the work in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gravsted.dk/person.php?navn=edvarderiksen Edvard Christian Johannes Eriksen.

In 1871, [[Holger Drachmann]] (1846–1908) and [[Karl Madsen]] (1855–1938) visited [[Skagen]] in the far north of [[Jutland]] where they quickly built up one of Scandinavia's most successful [[Skagen Painters|artists' colonies]]. They were soon joined by [[P.S. Krøyer]] (1851–1909), [[Carl Locher]] (1851–1915), [[Laurits Tuxen]] (1853–1927), the Norwegian [[Christian Skredsvig]] (1854–1924) and [[Michael Ancher|Michael]] (1849–1927) and [[Anna Ancher]] (1859–1935). All participated in painting the natural surroundings and local people. The symbolist [[Jens Ferdinand Willumsen]] (1863–1958) also visited the Skagen community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/skagen Art Encyclopedia: Skagen.] Retrieved 9 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A little later, at the very beginning of the 20th century, a similar phenomenon developed on the island of [[Funen]] with the encouragement of [[Johannes Larsen]] (1867–1961) and the inspiration of [[Theodor Philipsen]]. ''Fynboerne'' or the [[Funen Painters]] included: [[Peter Hansen (painter)|Peter Hansen]], [[Fritz Syberg]], [[Jens Birkholm]], [[Karl Schou]], [[Harald Giersing]], [[Anna Syberg]], [[Christine Swane]] and [[Alhed Larsen]].

[[Paul Gustave Fischer]] (1860–1934) was a romantic impressionistic painter specialising in city street scenes and bright bathing compositions.

[[Vilhelm Hammershøi]] (1864–1916) was considered something of an enigma in his lifetime but is now remembered mainly for his subdued paintings of interiors, usually empty spaces (as in ''[[Dust Motes Dancing in Sunbeams]]'') but occasionally with a solitary figure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityam.com/index.php?news=16058 The weird soul of Danish painting from City A.M.] Retrieved 6 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Danish [[expressionism|expressionist]] landscape painting developed between the world wars with [[Jens Søndergaard]] and [[Oluf Høst]] as its main representatives. In parallel, younger artists such as [[Niels Lergaard]], [[Lauritz Hartz]] and [[Karl Bovin]] adopted the light French colours and formalism of [[modernism]], founding the [[Corner painters|Corner group of artists]] in 1932. Around the same time, [[Edvard Weie]], the Swedish artist [[Karl Isakson]], [[Olaf Rude]], [[Kræsten Iversen]], [[Oluf Høst]] and [[Niels Lergaard]] were attracted by the natural beauty of the Baltic islands of [[Bornholm]] and the much smaller [[Christiansø]]. Together they initiated the so-called [[Bornholm school of painters|Bornholm School]] providing the basis of the permanent exhibition at the [[Bornholm Art Museum]] near [[Gudhjem]].  Painters of nature and everyday life such as [[Erik Hoppe]] and [[Knud Agger]] initiated the highly successful [[Grønningen]] association which provided a platform for exhibitions in [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denmark.dk/en/menu/About-Denmark/Arts-Culture/Visual-Arts/1900-1945/Expressionism/ Expressionism from denmark.dk.] Retrieved 9 December 2008.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234141/http://denmark.dk/en/menu/About-Denmark/Arts-Culture/Visual-Arts/1900-1945/Expressionism/ |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Danish design]] became of international importance in the decades after World War II, especially in furniture, where it pioneered a style sometimes known as [[Danish modern]], the forerunner of the general [[Scandinavian Design]] style popularized by [[IKEA]].  Important designers include [[Finn Juhl]] (1912–1989), [[Hans Wegner]] (1914–2007) and [[Arne Jacobsen]] (1902–1971).

*[[Richard Winther]] (1926–2007) a talented Danish artist, started his long career in the arts aged 10.  He worked on themes exploring mediums such as painting, photography, and ceramics.  He is considered as one of the founders of the Linien II movement, part of concrete art at the time.  Several {{who|date=October 2011}} known artists today have been greatly influenced by Richard Winther.  Many of his paintings were done on canvas and [[masonite]], but in an effort to simplify his art he not only diminished the number of colors he used but also switched to paint on cardboard. He was not shy about revisiting a theme and many years later amended some of his works.  Also several of his works are presented on both sides of the same cardboard. He used photographic cameras to compose art and when he was not satisfied with the capabilities of the machines, he started making his own designs.  He is known for his 360 degree cameras, instruments which are objects of art in themselves. Among the many prizes he was awarded, were the Eckersberg Medal (1971), Thorvaldsen Medal (1997) and the Prince Eugen Medal.
*[[Per Kirkeby]] (born 1938) has produced an impressive body of [[neo-expressionism|neo-expressionistic]] artwork on [[masonite]], canvas, blackboards and paper as well as various sculptures and even architecture.

===Margrethe II's tapestries===
On the occasion of her 50th birthday in 1990, [[Queen Margrethe II]] decided to use a gift from industry of 13 million Danish crowns to produce a series of tapestries tracing the history of Denmark from the beginnings to the present day. Woven by the historic [[Gobelins Manufactory|Manufacture des Gobelins]] in Paris, the tapestries were based on full-sized sketches by the versatile Danish artist [[Bjørn Nørgaard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjoernnoergaard.dk/gobeliner/index_eng.html Tapestries for the Queen of Denmark.

===Architecture===
{{main|Architecture of Denmark}}
Following in the footsteps of [[Arne Jacobsen]], Denmark has had some outstanding successes in contemporary architecture. [[Johann Otto von Spreckelsen]], relying on simple geometrical figures, designed the [[Grande Arche]] at [[La Défense]] in [[Puteaux]], near [[Paris]]. Prolific [[Henning Larsen]] designed the Foreign Ministry building in [[Riyadh]], as well as a variety of prestige buildings throughout [[Scandinavia]], including the recently completed [[Copenhagen Opera House]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Arkitektur/Danmark/Henning_Larsen Henning Larsen from Den Store Danske.] In Danish.

The '''Dolch word list''' is a list of frequently used [[English language|English]] words compiled by Edward William Dolch, a major proponent of the [[Whole-word method|"whole-word" method]] of beginning reading instruction. The list was first published in a journal article in 1936&lt;ref&gt;Dolch, E. W. "A Basic Sight Vocabulary." ''The Elementary School Journal'', vol. 36, no. 6, 1936, pp.456-460.&lt;/ref&gt; and then published in his book ''Problems in Reading'' in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Dolch, Edward William. ''Problems in Reading''. Garrard Press, 1948, pp.99-106.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Dolch compiled the list based on children's books of his era, which is why nouns such as "kitty" and "Santa Claus" appear on the list instead of more high-frequency words. The list contains 220 "service words" that have to be easily recognized in order to achieve reading fluency in the English language. The compilation excludes [[noun]]s, which comprise a separate 95-word list. Between 50% and 75% of all words used in schoolbooks, library books, newspapers, and magazines are a part of the Dolch basic [[sight word]] vocabulary.

These lists of words are still assigned for memorization in American elementary schools. Although most of the 220 Dolch words are phonetic, children are sometimes told that they can't be "sounded out" using common sound-to-letter [[analytical phonics|implicit]] [[phonics]] patterns and have to be learned by sight; hence the alternative term, "sight word". The list is divided according to the grades in which it was intended that children would memorize these words.

'''Doors Open Canada''' is a national program by [[Heritage Canada]], based on the [[Doors Open Days]] concept. It aims to expose [[architecture]] and [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] through the exploration of hidden historical, architectural and cultural gems. Buildings that are normally closed to the public, or which charge an entrance fee, welcome visitors to look around for free. 

The premiere Doors Open event in Canada, in age and repetition, is [[Doors Open Ontario]], which has run continuously since 2000. Since 2003, [[Doors Open Newfoundland and Labrador]] has been constantly growing, with new communities added each year.

'''Education sciences''' (traditionally often called '''pedagogy''')&lt;ref&gt;[https://ies.ed.gov/director/board/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://learn.org/articles/What_is_Education_Science.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; and '''education theory''' seek to describe, understand, and prescribe educational policy and practice. Education sciences include many topics, such as [[pedagogy]], [[andragogy]], [[curriculum]], [[Learning theory (education)|learning]], and education [[policy]], [[organizational theory|organization]] and [[leadership]]. Educational thought is informed by many disciplines, such as [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[sociology]], and [[psychology]]. 

Faculties, departments, degree programs, and degrees on educational sciences are often called simply ''Faculty of Education'' etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uta.fi/en/faculty-of-education ]&lt;/ref&gt; It is likewise common, especially in North America, to say ''she is studying education'', which is generally called ''studying educational science(s)'' nowadays and was traditionally called ''studying pedagogy'' (in English) in most European countries.

For example, a cultural theory of education considers how education occurs through the totality of culture, including prisons, households, and religious institutions as well as schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Philip H.

The earliest known attempts to understand education in Europe were by [[Ancient Greeks|classical Greek]] [[philosophers]] and [[sophists]], but there is also evidence of contemporary (or even preceding) discussions among Arabic, Indian, and Chinese scholars.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Educational thought==
{{see also|Philosophy of education|History of Education}}
Educational thought is not necessarily concerned with the construction of theories as much as the "reflective examination of educational issues and problems from the perspective of diverse disciplines."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Journal of Thought| url = http://www.journalofthought.com| accessdate = 19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normative theories of education==
Normative theories of education provide the norms, goals, and standards of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theradicalacademy.org/phillangames1.html|title=Philosophy of Education and Wittgenstein's Concept of Language-Games|website=www.theradicalacademy.org|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational philosophies===
{{Main|Philosophy of education}}
"Normative philosophies or theories of education may make use of the results of [philosophical thought] and of factual inquiries about human beings and the psychology of learning, but in any case they propound views about what education should be, what dispositions it should cultivate, why it ought to cultivate them, how and in whom it should do so, and what forms it should take.  In  a full-fledged philosophical normative theory of education, besides analysis of the sorts described, there will normally be propositions of the following kinds:
1.	Basic normative premises about what is good or right;
2.	Basic factual premises about humanity and the world;
3.	Conclusions, based on these two kinds of premises, about the dispositions education should foster;
4.	Further factual premises about such things as the psychology of learning and methods of teaching; and
5.	Further conclusions about such things as the methods that education should use."&lt;ref name=POEE&gt;{{Citation   | last1 = Frankena   | first1 = William K.   | last2 =  Raybeck   | first2 = Nathan | last3 =  Burbules   | first3 = Nicholas | contribution =  Philosophy of Education  | year = 2002   | title = Encyclopedia of Education, 2nd edition   | editor-last =  Guthrie  | editor-first = James W.  | place =  New York, NY  | publisher =  Macmillan Reference  | isbn= 0-02-865594-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of the purpose of schools include:&lt;ref&gt;Webb, DL, A Metha, and KF Jordan (2010). ''Foundations of American Education'', 6th Ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Merill, pp. 55-91&lt;/ref&gt; to develop reasoning about perennial questions, to master the methods of scientific inquiry, to cultivate the intellect, to create change agents, to develop spirituality, and to model a democratic society.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, W.

ISSN 2225-7063, pp. 69-81, http://issuu.com/ijosc.net/docs/ijosc?mode=window&amp;viewMode=doublePage&lt;/ref&gt;

Common educational philosophies include: [[educational perennialism]], [[educational progressivism]], [[educational essentialism]], [[critical pedagogy]], [[montessori method|Montessori education]], [[Waldorf education]], and [[democratic education]].

===Curriculum theory===
{{Main|Curriculum theory}}
Normative [[curriculum theory|theories of curriculum]] aim to "describe, or set norms, for conditions surrounding many of the concepts and constructs" that define [[curriculum]].&lt;ref name="Beauchamp pp. 23–27"&gt;{{Cite journal   | last = Beauchamp  | first = George A. | title = Curriculum Theory: Meaning, Development, and Use   | journal = Theory into Practice   | volume = 21  |number = 1 | pages =23–27   | date = Winter 1982 | doi=10.1080/00405848209542976}}&lt;/ref&gt; These normative propositions differ from those above in that normative curriculum theory is not necessarily untestable.&lt;ref name="Beauchamp pp. 23–27"/&gt;  A central question asked by normative curriculum theory is: given a particular educational philosophy, what is worth knowing and why? Some examples are: a deep understanding of the [[Great Books]], direct experiences driven by student interest, a superficial understanding of a wide range knowledge (e.g. [[Core knowledge]]), social and community problems and issues, knowledge and understanding specific to cultures and their achievements (e.g. [[African-Centered Education]]).

=== Feminist educational theory ===

==== Background ====
Scholars such as Robyn Wiegman argue that, “academic feminism is perhaps the most successful institutionalizing project of its generation, with more full-time faculty positions and new doctoral degree programs emerging each year in the field it inaugurated, Women's Studies”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Feminism against Itself|last = Wiegman|first = Robyn|date = 2002|journal = NWSA Journal|volume=14.2|pp=18-37|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist educational theory stems from four key tenets, supported by empirical data based on surveys of feminist educators.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Feminist Pedagogy in Theory and Practice: An Empirical Investigation|last = Hoffmann|first = Frances L|date = 1998|journal = NWSA Journal|volume=10.1|pp=79-97|doi = |pmid = |first2 = Jayne E|last2 = Stake}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first tenet of feminist educational theory is, “Creation of participatory classroom communities”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Participatory classroom communities often are smaller classes built around discussion and student involvement. The second tenet is, “Validation of personal experience”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Classrooms in which validation of personal experience occur often are focused around students providing their own insights and experiences in group discussion, rather than relying exclusively on the insight of the educator. The third tenet is, “Encouragement of social understanding and activism”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This tenet is generally actualized by classrooms discussing and reading about social and societal aspects that students may not be aware of, along with breeding student self-efficacy. The fourth and final tenet of feminist education is, “Development of critical thinking skills/open-mindedness”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Classrooms actively engaging in this tenet encourage students to think for themselves and prompt them to move beyond their comfort zones, working outside the bounds of the traditional lecture-based classroom. Though these tenets at times overlap, they combine to provide the basis for modern feminist educational theory, and are supported by a majority of feminist educators.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Feminist educational theory derives from the [[feminist movement]], particularly that of the early 1970s, which prominent feminist [[bell hooks]] describes as, “a movement to end sexism, sexist exploitation, and oppression”.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Feminism is for Everybody|last = hooks|first = bell|publisher = South End Press|year = 2000|isbn = |location = Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic feminist Robyn Weigman recalls that, “In the early seventies, feminism in the U.S. academy was less an organized entity than a set of practices: an ensemble of courses listed on bulletin boards often taught for free by faculty and community leaders”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While feminism traditionally existed outside of the institutionalization of schools (particularly universities), feminist education has gradually taken hold in the last few decades and has gained a foothold in institutionalized educational bodies. “Once fledgling programs have become departments, and faculty have been hired and tenured with full-time commitments”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Opposition ====
Opposition to feminist educational theory comes from both those who oppose feminism in general and feminists who oppose feminist educational theory in particular. Critics of feminist educational theory argue against the four basic tenets of the theory, “… [contesting] both their legitimacy and their implementation”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Lewis Lehrman]] particularly describes feminist educational ideology as, “… 'therapeutic pedagogy' that substitutes an 'overriding' (and detrimental) value on participatory interaction for the expertise of the faculty” (Hoffman). Lehrman argues that the feminist educational tenets of participatory experience and validation of person experience hinder education by limiting and inhibiting the educator’s ability to share his or her knowledge, learned through years of education and experience.

Others challenge the legitimacy of feminist educational theory, arguing that it is not unique and is instead a sect of liberatory education. Even feminist educational scholars such as Frances Hoffmann and Jayne Stake are forced to concede that, “feminist pedagogy shared intellectual and political roots with the movements comprising the liberatory education agenda of the past 30 years”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These liberatory attempts at the democratization of classrooms demonstrate a growth in liberatory education philosophy that some argue feminist educational theory simply piggybacks off of.

The harshest critiques of feminist educational theory often come from feminists themselves. Feminist scholar Robyn Wiegman argues against feminist education in her article “Academic Feminism against Itself,” arguing that feminist educational ideology has abandoned the [[intersectionality]] of feminism in many cases, and has also focused exclusively on present content with a singular perspective. Wiegman refers to feminist scholar James Newman's arguments, centered around the idea that, “When we fail… to challenge both students and ourselves to theorize alterity as an issue of change over time as well as of geographic distance, ethnic difference, and sexual choice, we repress… not only the ‘thickness’ of historical difference itself, but also… our (self) implication in a narrative of progress whose hero(in)es inhabit only the present”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Newman (and Wiegman) believe that this presentist ideology imbued within modern academic feminism creates an environment breeding antifeminist ideologies, most importantly an abandonment of the study of difference, integral to feminist ideology. Wiegman believes that feminist educational theory does a great disservice to the feminist movement, while failing to instill the critical thinking and social awareness that feminist educational theory is intended to.

==== Support ====
There are supporters of feminist education as well, many of whom are educators or students. Student-turned-professor Becky Ropers-Huilman recounts one of her positive experiences with feminist education from the student perspective, explaining that she “… felt very ‘in charge’ of [her] own learning experiences,” and “… was not being graded-or degraded... [while completing] the majority of the assigned work for the class (and additional work that [she] thought would add to class discussion),” all while “… [regarding] the teacher’s feedback on [her] participation as one perspective, rather than the perspective”.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Scholarship on the Other Side: Power and Caring in Feminist Education|last = Ropers-Huilman|first = Becky|date = 1998|journal = NWSA Journal|volume=11.1|pp=118-135|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ropers experienced a working feminist classroom that successfully motivated students to go above and beyond, succeeding in generating self-efficacy and caring in the classroom. When Ropers became a teacher herself, she embraced feminist educational theory, noting that, “[Teachers] have an obligation as the ones who are vested with an assumed power, even if that power is easily and regularly disrupted, to assess and address the effects that it is having in our classrooms”.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ropers firmly believes that educators have a duty to address feminist concepts such as the use and flow of power within the classroom, and strongly believes in the potential of feminist educational theory to create positive learning experiences for students and teachers as she has personally experienced.

Becky Ropers-Huilman also celebrates the feminist classroom’s inclusivity, noting that in a feminist classroom, “in which power is used to care about, for, and with others… educational participants can shape practices aimed at creating an inclusive society that discovers and utilizes the potential of its actors”.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ropers believes that a feminist classroom carries the ability to greatly influence the society as a whole, promoting understanding, caring, and inclusivity. Ropers actively engages in feminist education in her classes, focusing on concepts such as [[active learning]] and [[critical thinking]] while attempting to demonstrate and engage in caring behavior and atypical classroom settings, similar to many other feminist educators.

Leading feminist scholar bell hooks argues for the incorporation of feminism into all aspects of society, including education, in her book ''[[Feminism is for Everybody]].'' hooks notes that, “Everything [people] know about feminism has come into their lives thirdhand”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; hooks believes that education offers a counter to the, “… wongminded notion of feminist movement which implied it was anti-male”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; hooks cites feminism’s negative connotations as major inhibitors to the spread and adoption of feminist ideologies. However, feminist education has seen tremendous growth in adoption in the past few decades, despite the negative connotations of its parent movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Descriptive theories of education==
Descriptive theories of education provide descriptions or explanations of the processes of education.

===Curriculum theory===
{{Main|Curriculum theory}}
Descriptive theories of curriculum explain how curricula "benefit or harm all publics it touches".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation   | last =  Connelly  | first =  F. Michael   | last2 =  Fang He  | first2 =  Ming  | last3 =  JoAnn  | last4 = Phillion | title =  The SAGE Handbook of Curriculum and Instruction  | publisher =  Sage  | year =  2008  | chapter = Curriculum in Theory  | page = 394 | isbn = 978-1-4129-0990-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal   | last = Scott  | first = Harry V. | title = A Primer of Curriculum Theory: Descriptive Theory   | journal = Educational Theory   | volume = 18  |number = 2 | pages =118–124   | date = April 1968 | doi=10.1111/j.1741-5446.1968.tb00342.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[hidden curriculum]] describes that which is learned simply by being in a [[learning environment]]. For example, a student in a teacher-led classroom is learning submission. The hidden curriculum is not necessarily intentional.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Jane. “What Should We Do with a Hidden Curriculum When We Find One?” The Hidden Curriculum and Moral Education. Ed. Giroux, Henry and David Purpel. Berkeley, California: McCutchan Publishing Corporation, 1983. 122–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instructional theory===
{{main|Pedagogy}}
{{see also|Educational technology}}
Instructional theories focus on the methods of instruction for teaching [[curriculum|curricula]].  Theories include the methods of: [[Self-paced instruction|autonomous learning]], [[coyote teaching]], [[inquiry-based instruction]], [[lecture]], [[maturationism]], [[socratic method]], [[outcome-based education]], [[taking children seriously]], [[transformative learning]]

===The nature of the learner and of learning===
{{main|Philosophical anthropology|Philosophy of education|Educational psychology|Educational neuroscience}}

'''Philosophical Anthropology'''

[[Philosophical anthropology]] is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] study of [[human nature]].  In terms of learning, examples of descriptive theories of the learner are: a mind, soul, and spirit capable of emulating the Absolute Mind ([[Idealism]]); an orderly, sensing, and rational being capable of understanding the world of things ([[Philosophical realism|Realism]]), a rational being with a soul modeled after God and who comes to know God through reason and revelation ([[Neo-Thomism]]), an evolving and active being capable of interacting with the environment ([[Pragmatism]]), a fundamentally free and individual being who is capable of being authentic through the making of and taking responsibility for choices ([[Existentialism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Webb, DL, A Metha, and KF Jordan (2010). ''Foundations of American Education'', 6th Ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Merill, pp. 55-62&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosophical concepts for the process of education include ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726015042/http://www.eaea.org/index.php?k=15098 Bildung]'' and ''[[paideia]]''.

'''Educational Psychology'''

[[Educational psychology]] is an [[Empiricism#Scientific usage|empirical science]] that provides descriptive theories of how people learn.  Examples of theories of education in psychology are: [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]], [[behaviorism]], [[Cognitive psychology|cognitivism]], and [[Motivational Theory|motivational theory]]

'''Educational Neuroscience'''

[[Educational neuroscience]] is an emerging field that brings together researchers in diverse disciplines to explore the interactions between biological processes and education.&lt;ref name = AnsariCoch&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ansari | first1 = D | authorlink1 = | last2 = Coch | first2 = D | year = 2006 | title = Bridges over troubled waters: Education and cognitive neuroscience | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 146–151 | publisher = Elsevier Science | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2006.02.007 | pmid = 16530462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology of education===
{{main|Sociology of education}}
The [[sociology of education]] is the study of how public [[institution]]s and individual experiences affect [[education]] and its outcomes. It is most concerned with the public schooling systems of modern industrial societies, including the expansion of [[higher education|higher]], [[further education|further]], [[adult education|adult]], and [[continuing education|continuing]] education.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Gordon Marshall (ed) ''A Dictionary of Sociology'' (Article: Sociology of Education), Oxford University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of theories of education from sociology include: [[Sociology of education#Structural functionalism|functionalism]], [[Sociology of education#Education and social reproduction|conflict theory]], [[social efficiency]], and [[social mobility]].

===Educational anthropology===
{{main|Educational anthropology}}
[[Educational anthropology]] is a sub-field of [[anthropology]] and is widely associated with the pioneering work of [[George Spindler]].  As the name would suggest, the focus of educational anthropology is obviously on education, although an anthropological approach to education tends to focus on the cultural aspects of education, including informal as well as formal education. As education involves understandings of who we are, it is not surprising that the single most recognized dictum of educational anthropology is that the field is centrally concerned with cultural transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Comitas, L. and Dolgin, J. 1979. '[http://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1220&amp;context=faculty_scholarship On Anthropology and Education: Retrospect and Prospect]'. Anthropology and Education Quarterly. 9(1): 87-89&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cultural transmission]] involves the transfer of a sense of identity between generations, sometimes known as [[enculturation]]&lt;ref&gt;Page, J.S. Education and Acculturation on Malaita: An Ethnography of Intraethnic and Interethnic Affinities'.The Journal of Intercultural Studies. 1988. #15/16:74-81.&lt;/ref&gt; and also transfer of identity between cultures, sometimes known as [[acculturation]].&lt;ref&gt;Page, J.S. Education and Acculturation on Malaita: An Ethnography of Intraethnic and Interethnic Affinities'.The Journal of Intercultural Studies. 1988. #15/16:74-81, available on-line at http://eprints.qut.edu.au/archive/00003566/&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, thus it is also not surprising that educational anthropology has become increasingly focussed on ethnic identity and ethnic change.&lt;ref&gt;Dynneson, T.L. 1984. 'An Anthropological Approach to Learning and Teaching'. Social Education. 48(6): 410-418.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schensul, J.J. 1985.

[[File:Chateau Versailles petit appartement Reine salle a manger.jpg|thumb|Encoignure cupboards at Versaille]]
'''Encoignure''' is a type of [[furniture]] located in a corner of a room. In French, it literally means the angle, or return, formed by the junction of two walls. Since the 20th century, the word is chiefly used to designate a small [[armoire]], [[commode]], [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]] or [[cupboard]] made to fit a corner. A chair placed in a corner is referred to as a chaise encoignure.

Originally the object comes from France, hence the name, famous pieces by [[Louis Quinze]] or [[Louis Seize]] in [[lacquer]] or in [[mahogany]], elaborately mounted in gilded bronze, are delightfully alluring pieces from the period of grand French furniture. It was made in a vast variety of forms but is strictly limited by its destination. As a rule these delicate and dainty pieces were in pairs and placed in opposite angles; frequently the tops were finished in expensive colored [[marble]].

The '''European Film Gateway''' (EFG) is a single access point to the digitized holdings of historical European film documents from numerous film archives and cinematheques, including over 600,000 individual objects from over 60 collections.&lt;ref&gt;July, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The European Film Gateway gives access to images, textual materials, and moving images. The vast contents include film stills, set photos, posters, set drawings, portrait photographs, scripts, correspondences, film censorship and visa rulings, out-of-print books, film programs and reviews, as well as newsreels, documentaries, commercials, and feature films. The portal facilitates access to the archives which hold the original materials.

==Background==
The online portal European Film Gateway is the main outcome of the EU-funded project “EFG – European Film Gateway”. Working with 22 partner organizations from 16 European countries, EFG addressed issues for access to digital content, namely, technical and semantic interoperability, metadata standards, practices for rights’ clearance, and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) management of cinematographic works. The project was coordinated by the [[Deutsches Filminstitut]] (DIF) and funded by the European Commission under eContentplus, the Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme (ICT PSP). It ran from September 2008 to August 2011 was supported by the Association des Cinematheques Europeennes (ACE) as well as the EDL Foundation.

==Key issues==

===Technical interoperability and access===
All metadata provided by the contributing archives is stored centrally in the EFG metadata repository, which was developed in the EFG project.&lt;ref&gt;Franca Debole, Pasquale Savino, Detlev Balzer: "[http://www.efgproject.eu/downloads/D22_Common_Interoperability_Schema_V3_2_4.pdf%20 Common interoperability schema for archival resources and filmographic descriptions]", 24 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The EFG metadata model is mostly based on the EN 15907: Film identification - Enhancing interoperability of metadata - Element sets and structures standard. Also other models, such as [[FRBR]] as well as WPE defined by the [[OLAC]] have been considered during establishing the EFG data model.&lt;ref&gt;http://efgproject.eu/guidelines_and_standards.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The multilingual and non-standardised metadata delivered by content providers is harmonised and cleaned before it is ingested in the EFG system. In contrast to the metadata, which is stored centrally, the digital objects remain on individual online platforms run by the archives. Deep links refer the user directly to the objects.

The EFG implemented the technology developed by the Digital Repository Infrastructure Vision for European Research (DRIVER) project. This open service system enables the creation and maintenance of infrastructures capable of supporting the construction of Information Spaces of digital objects collected from various archives. It also permits the creation of service-oriented applications where services can be shared and re-used in other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efgproject.eu/workplan.php EFG Project Workplan], 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===IPR management and administration===
The EFG project assessed copyright regulations and legal framework for online use of archival contents through research reports on open content models as well as working with organisations engaged with online publishing of copyrighted archival film material. EFG provided individual network partners with tools for consultations with representatives from rights owners’ and producers’ organisations in order to make the archival material available online.&lt;ref&gt;Ñusta Nina, Leontien Bout, Géraldine Vooren: "
[http://www.efgproject.eu/downloads/D_5_3_Final_Guidelines_Copyright_Clearance_online.pdf Final Guidelines on Copyright Clearance and IPR Management]", 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Follow-up project==

EFG1914 is the follow-up project of EFG. It began in February 2012 and runs for two years. Coinciding with the centenary of the [[First World War]], EFG1914 focuses on the digitization of films and other documents from and relating to the war, making the contents available through the European Film Gateway and Europeana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.project.efg1914.eu EFG1914 project website]&lt;/ref&gt; Like EFG, it is funded by the European Commission and coordinated by Deutsches Filminstitut. The project consortium consists of 26 partners, 21 of which are film archives.

To date, only about 20% of the silent film production of the time remains safe-guarded in the archives and was largely unavailable to the public. EFG1914 significantly simplifies access to these films, covering various fields, from newsreels to documentary, fiction, and propaganda films.

The national '''[[flag]] of [[Qatar]]''' ({{lang-ar|علم قطر}}) is in the ratio of 11:28. It is [[maroon]] with a broad white serrated band (nine white points) on the [[Hoist (flag)|hoist]] side. It was adopted shortly before the country's declaration of independence from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] on September 3, 1971.

The flag is very similar to the [[Flag of Bahrain|flag of the neighbouring country Bahrain]], which has fewer points, a 3:5 proportion, and a red colour instead of maroon. Qatar's flag is the only national flag having a width more than twice its height.&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|ar|.(28:11) عند استخدام العلم خارج المباني، داخل دولة قطر، فإنه يجب أن تكون النسبة بين طول وعرض العلم}}" (When using a flag outside of buildings within the State of Qatar, the ratio between the length and the width of the flag should be 11:28.) - [http://www.almeezan.qa/ClarificationsNoteDetails.aspx?id=8750&amp;language=ar Law No. 14 on the Flag of Qatar - Qatar Legal Portal]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Qatar's historic flag was plain red, in correspondence with the red banner traditionally used by the [[Khawarij|Kharjite]] [[Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Complete Flags of the World (Dk)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1yahq8im86kC|publisher=DK Publishing|year=2014|isbn=978-1409353713|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, the country modified its entirely red flag with the addition of a white vertical stripe at the hoist to suit the British directive.&lt;ref name="britishempire"/&gt; After this addition, Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Thani]] officially adopted a patterned purple-red and white flag which bore a strong resemblance to its modern derivative.&lt;ref name="gov1"/&gt; Several additions were made to the Qatari flag in 1932, with the nine-pointed serrated edge, diamonds and the word "Qatar" being integrated in its design.&lt;ref name="gov1"/&gt; The maroon color was standardized in 1949. In the 1960s, Sheikh [[Ali bin Abdullah Al Thani|Ali Al Thani]] removed the wording and diamonds from the flag.&lt;ref name="gov1"/&gt; The flag was officially adopted on July 9, 1971 and was virtually identical to the 1960s flag, with the exception of the height-to-width proportion.&lt;ref name="gov1"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
===Pattern===
Nine serrated edges separate the colored and white portions. They signify Qatar's inclusion as the 9th member of the 'reconciled Emirates' of the [[Persian Gulf]] at the conclusion of the Qatari-British treaty in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2081.html|title=FIELD LISTING :: FLAG DESCRIPTION|publisher=CIA|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Color===
In 2015, the Qatari government defined the exact shade of the Qatari flag as [[Pantone]] 1955 C, or 'Qatar maroon'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/flags/countrys/mideast/qatar.htm|title=Qatar's flag|publisher=World Atlas|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.qatarliving.com/forum/qatar-living-lounge/posts/qatars-national-color-pantone-222c-not-maroon|title=Qatar's national color is Pantone 1955 C (not maroon)|last=mohdnoor|date=2015-01-12|work=Qatar Living|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1932, the British Navy suggested an official flag should be designed. They proposed that the flag be white and red, but Qatar rejected the red coloring and continued using a mixture of purple and red instead.&lt;ref name="gov1"/&gt; Due to the country's subtropical desert climate, the flag's colors were prone to being tinted darker by the sun, which resulted in the eventual adoption of a maroon coloring in 1949.&lt;ref name="gov1"/&gt; The white portion of the flag symbolizes the peace procured from signing anti-piracy treaties with the British.&lt;ref name="britishempire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/qatar.htm|title=Imperial era flag of Qatar|publisher=British Empire in the Middle East|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1456">'''Folly''' ({{Lang-la|Moria}}) was a common allegorical figure in [[medieval]] [[morality plays]] and in [[allegorical]] artwork through the [[Renaissance]].  The depiction is generally of a young man, often similar in appearance to a [[jester]] or the tarot card, [[The Fool (tarot card)|The Fool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Costumes and Scenery for Amateurs|last=Mackay|first=Constance D'Arcy|page=197|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|year=1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to the many obvious [[classical antiquity|classical]] allusions in such works, the depictions owe little to the Greek goddess [[Atë]].

[[File:Giotto- The Seven Vices - Foolishness.JPG|thumb|A standard medieval [[allegory]] of Folly, painted by [[Giotto]].]]

In drama, the character tempts the protagonist into foolish action, successfully or not.  In an allegorical painting, the figure may be counterpoised to Prudence, representing a choice, or alone, representing the unwisdom of the actors in the painting.

The '''Hindu Mahajana Sangam''' ({{lang-ta|இந்து மகாஜன சங்கம்}}) is an association of Indian workers. It is one of the Indian non-profitable organization at Penang, Malaysia which has been officially established in 1935 by waterfronts workers. Before 1935, it known as Kootakkadai ({{lang-ta|கூட்டக்கடை}}).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hmsgandhiji.byethost13.com/index.htm
| title= Hindu Mahajana Sangam Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Mahajana comes from two words, ''maha'' meaning great and ''jana'' meaning people. So Mahajana can be described as ''great people'' in Tamil, though in Sanskrit, it is translated as ''great vehicle''. The Indian workers who arrived here were farmers back home. They preferred to call themselves Kootakadai, because they work as a ''kootam'' ({{lang-ta|கூட்டம்}}) which is gang or group, rather than calling themselves coolies or labourers.

The Hindu Mahajana Sangam was established in 1935 after following the first consecration of the [[Sri Mahamariamman Temple, Penang|Sri Muthu Mariamman Temple]] in Queen Street which was held in 1933. It was established for religious observances, to promote education, social/cultural development, participates in the administration/development of the Sri Muthu Mariamman, [[Arulmigu Balathandayuthapani Temple, Penang|Arulmigu Balathandayuthapani]] and act as union for the workers.

The sangam’s ''madam'' (hall) located at 674, Jalan Kebun Bunga (formerly known as Waterfall Road) near the foothill of the Waterfall Arulmigu Balathandayuthapani hilltop temple, is named as ''Gandhiji Ashram'' in remembrance of Mahatma Gandhi on 22nd Feb 1948.

==History==
The Indian farmers for economic reasons came to Penang from South India in the early 18th Century to work in the Penang waterfront as labourers, they worked for the Indian merchants and contributed to the development of import and export spice trade in the Island.

There were also Tamil Indian freedom fighters [[Maruthu Pandiyar]] relatives and 72 soldiers were deported to [[Penang]] in the year 1802 by the Madras Presidency Government (British India Government).&lt;ref&gt;சிவகங்கைச் சரித்திர அம்மானை. Madras Government Oriental Manuscripts Series No: 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Koottakadai===
There were more than 2,000 workers and their dependents lived in the prewar houses in the town centre than known as simpang lelong or ''elam muchanthi'' in Tamil, today this area is known as [[Little India, Penang|Little India]]. They worked in groups/gangs (''kootam'' in Tamil) each gang consist of 50 to 30 workers with a head (''Thandal'' in Tamil) and a clerk (''Kanakku Pillai'' in Tamil) in charge of daily working income account which will be divided and distributed to the workers at the end of the month. They worked for the Indian merchant houses in handling their goods in the import/export trade. These workers are referred to as ''Kootakadai'' as they work as a group (Kootam). There were more than 50 groups operating in the Weld Quay waterfront handling cargo in the tongkangs or wooden barges in the import and export trade. In the many open concrete fields in the town, some of the workers were involved in storing; drying and re-bagging of betel nuts imported from Indonesia for re-export. For the workers relaxation in the evening, the authorities operated 2 government toddy shops in the town centre, one in Market Lane/Muda Lane junction which still exist today and the other in King Street which was bombed by the Japanese during the 2nd World War, this site have been since rebuilt into a warehouse for the customs department. During the War many workers joined the Indian National Army. They also had a unique form of a gathering to raise emergency funds for their needs call ''Needs'' (''Thaevai'' in Tamil)  where each worker contribute and his amount and name recorded and same amount return to him in another function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hmsgandhiji.byethost13.com/index.htm

===Sri Muthu Mariamman Temple===
In 1833 the workers founded the Queen Street Sri Muthu Mariamman Temple (The temple was renamed Arulmigu Mahamariamman Temple in 1980 by the Hindu Endowment Board).  The waterfront workers contributed to the development, construction and management of the Queen Street and Waterfall temples. The inner city Hindu population was mostly waterfront workers who established the Hindu Mahajana Sangam in 1935. The sangam was established with the main purpose of managing the Queen Street and Waterfall hilltop temples. The Queen street temple which was then managed by a few trustees appointed by the Board. One of these trustees was Mr K.V. Karuppiah Thandal, who became the inaugural secretary of the sangam.

The sangam was also involved in promoting religious observance, developing Tamil education and Indian culture. It was also involved in arbitrating disputes within the community which served as an avenue to discuss and address social problems affecting Indian workers. It set up a panchayat committee to solve these problems. The sangam started Tamil schools to educate the Tamil children, and was active in promoting cultural activities and religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hmsgandhiji.byethost13.com/index.htm
| title= Hindu Mahajana Sangam Official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Union for the workers===
The Hindu Mahajana Sangam was a channel in bring up the grievances of the Indian community to the proper authorities and acted as a union for the workers until 1950, when the Waterfront Workers Union was formed. This later became known as the Weld Quay Workers Union. In the early 1970s, when the Government established the Penang Labour Board, the Weld Quay Workers Union was amalgamated with the Prai Cargo Handlers and the Penang Stevedores Union to form the Penang Port Workers Union, with its office in King Street.

The sangam’s Hon. Secretary, the late K. V. Karuppiah Thandal, the head of one of the numerous groups of workers was a trustee of the Queen Street Sri Muthu Mariamman temple and the sangam members were regularly appointed to the Hindu Endowment Board and the members held various positions in the temples management committees and contributed to the temples development.

The sangam’s President, the late Mr. M. Doraisamy Thevar JP, PJK was the last Hindu Endowment Board member representing the Hindu Mahajana Sangam and was also the chairman of the Temples Management Committee, which carried out the 2nd consecration ceremony of the Queen Street, Sri Muthu Mariamman Temple.

Between 1960s and 70s many of the workers living in the inner city became jobless due to the Indonesian confrontation and also because the Indian merchants began to reduce the usage of the tongkangs/barges in transporting cargo to vessels and used the newly built PPC Butterworth deepwater wharves in the mainland to be cost effective. Therefore, many of the workers due to lack of job opportunities and their expanded families gradually left the town centre for economic reasons to various parts of the Island, to the slums in the Weld Quay reclamation area, Noordin Street Flats, mainland and far South, some of them even left Penang permanently to settle in India.

===Building===
The Hindu Mahajana Sangam operated out of 47 Church Street from 1935 until 1947, when it moved to 40 Church Street. The sangam moved out of 40 Church Street in 1988 after the property was sold. It was then that it moved to its own building, the Gandhiji Ashram, at 674 Jalan Kebun Bunga.

Today it is based at the Gandhiji Ashram, a community hall at the foot of the Balathandayuthapani Temple near the Penang Botanic Gardens. The hall was built by the early Indian settles who were the waterfront workers in late 1920s and was originally known as ''Madaalayam'' or ''Kootakadai Madam''.  The Sangam intends to preserve the Dewan Mahatma Gandhi building as a heritage building as in our view this is the only building that exist today which is based on the South Indian Architecture left in the whole of Malaysia. This building is of significant historic value need to be preserved for our future generation to appreciate our heritage.

==Contributions==
The Sangam to strengthen the religious beliefs in the community every year organizes various festivals and celebrations in Queen Street Sri Maha Mariamman Temple, Waterfall Sri Bala Thendayuthapani Hilltop temple, Penang Road Sri Kunj Bihari Krishna Temple and Dewan Mahatma Gandhi.

===Dewan Mahatma Gandhi===
The members of the Sangam built the hall (''madam'' in Tamil) in the Waterfall Balathandayuthapani Temple compound to cater for the devotees attending the annual Thaipusam (during Jan/Feb) and the annual Chitraparuvam Festivals (during April/May). This is a rare heritage building representing the South Indian architecture. Not only Dewan Mahatma Gandhi is used as a religious retreat, it also provides shelter to estate workers who come to Penang during the festivals. Due to lack of transport and accommodation in the earlier years, the sangam provided free temporary accommodation for the devotees from outstation attending the festivals and free vegetarian lunch to the public. This tradition is still being carried out by the Sangam members till today. On 22 February 1948 during a condolences gathering for the late Mahatma Gandhi, the members unanimously named the Sangam’s hall Dewan Mahatma Gandhi (Ganhdhiji Ashram).
On 5 October 2008, A ceremony was held at the Gandhiji Ashram to unveil a life size statue of Mahatma Gandhi. The ceremony was also to celebrate United Nation's International Day against violence and to commemorate the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi. 
Beginning from August 2013, an exhibit of rare photographs of Mahatma Gandhi is open to the public from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, on every Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.

===Pillaiyar Temple===
In 1951 the Sangam built the Pillaiyar Temple in the Waterfall Temple compound and held its first [[consecration]] ceremony. In the late 1970s the Hindu Endowment Board rebuilt this temple and renamed it Arulmigu Sri Ganesar Temple.

=== Chitraparuvam===
The Hindu Mahajana Sangam, with notable among the festivals, the annual Chitraparuvam Festival which is celebrated in the Tamil month of Chithirai (April/May) every year, is organised with a chariot procession of the [[Panchaloha]] ({{lang-ta|ஐம்பொன்}}) deity of Lord Subramaniyaswami from Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman Temple. It is the day of the first full moon of the first Tamil month. In early years, the festival starts with special pooja and ubayam for the Hindu Mahajana Sangam (Koota Kadai) in Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman temple, the chariot procession commences in the early morning 7.00&amp;nbsp;am and reached Waterfall Dewan Mahatma Gandhi (Gandhiji Ashram) in the afternoon, the deity then carried and placed in the ashram until the return journey of the chariot to Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman temple in the evening of the same day.

=== Navarathiri ===
The [[Navratri|Navarathiri]] festival begins with the lion flag raising ceremony and ends with a procession where the [[Panchaloha]] ({{lang-ta|ஐம்பொன்}}) deity of Mahamariamman is paraded in a decorated wooden chariot through the streets of Little India. Navarathiri is nine nights’ vegetarian festival. According to the Hindu [[Puranas]], the festival is held to commemorate the victory of Goddess [[Adi Parashakti]] over the demon king [[Mahishasura]]n. It was stated that the evil king ill-treated the people that they turned to the goddess, who is the consort of Lord Shiva, to save them. Goddess Adi Parasakthi fought a battle for nine days and ultimately destroyed him on the 10th day, which is known as [[Vijayadashami]].

Various Indian organisations and communities would sponsor the prayers for each of the nights. On the Final tenth day of the celebration, [[Vijayadashami]] is celebrated by Hindu Mahajana Sangam. The sangam organised the chariot procession for many years from Queen Street, Sri Mahamariamman Temple to [[Dhoby Ghaut, Penang|Dhoby Ghaut]]. The festival celebration is concluded after shooting of arrows from the chariot in the evening in the Dhoby Ghaut. The chariot returns to the temple at about midnight the same day. Since the late 1970s, the organisation of the chariot procession had been taken over from the sangam by the Temple committee and the Hindu Endowments Board. The chariot procession is now confined to [[Fort Cornwallis]] area, nearby the Kedah Pier Muneeswarar Temple in the Esplanade. However, the sangam still continues to celebrate the annual Navarathiri festival’s final tenth day Vijayadashami Ubayam every year without fail.

[[File:Корона св. Стефана.jpg|thumb|upright|Back of the Holy Crown]]
[[File:Coat of Arms of Hungary.svg|thumb|upright|The [[coat of arms of Hungary]] with the Holy Crown on top]]

The '''Holy Crown of Hungary''' ({{lang-hu|Szent Korona}},&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-de|Stephanskrone}}, {{lang-hr|Kruna svetoga Stjepana}}, {{lang-la|Sacra Corona}}, {{lang-sk|Svätoštefanská koruna}})&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''Crown of [[Stephen I of Hungary|Saint Stephen]]''') was the [[coronation crown]] used by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] for most of its existence; kings have been crowned with it since the twelfth century.
The Crown was bound to the [[Lands of the Hungarian Crown]] (sometimes the ''Sacra Corona'' meant the Land, the Carpathian Basin, but it also meant the coronation body, too). No king of Hungary was regarded as having been truly legitimate without being crowned with it. In the [[history of Hungary]], more than fifty kings were crowned with it, up to the last, [[Charles I of Austria|Charles IV]], in 1916 (the only kings who were not so crowned were [[John II Sigismund]], [[Gabriel Bethlen]] and [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]).

The enamels on the crown are mainly or entirely Byzantine work, presumed to have been made in [[Constantinople]] in the 1070s. The crown was presented by the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VII Doukas]] to King [[Géza I of Hungary]]; both are depicted and named in Greek on enamel plaques in the lower crown. It is one of the two known Byzantine crowns to survive, the other being the slightly earlier [[Monomachus Crown]], which is also in Budapest, in the [[Hungarian National Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 214; Bàràny-Oberschall (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Monomachus Crown may have had another function, and the Holy Crown has probably been remodelled, and uses elements of different origins.  The date assigned to the present configuration of the Holy Crown varies, but is most commonly put around the late 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;László, 425&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Coronation of the Hungarian monarch|Hungarian coronation]] insignia consists of the Holy Crown, the sceptre, the orb, and the mantle. The orb has the coat-of-arms of [[Charles I of Hungary]] (1310–1342).  In popular tradition the Holy Crown was thought to be older, dating to the time of the first King [[Stephen I of Hungary]], crowned in 1000/1001.

It was first called the Holy Crown in 1256. During the 14th century, royal power came to be represented not simply by a crown, but by just one specific object: the Holy Crown. This also meant that the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was a special state: they were not looking for a crown to inaugurate a king, but rather, they were looking for a king for the crown; as written by Crown Guard [[Péter Révay]]. He also depicts that "the Holy Crown is for the Hungarians what the [[Ark of the Covenant|Lost Ark]] is for the Jewish people".&lt;ref&gt;"De sacra corona regni Hungariae ortu, virtuti, victoria, fortuna... brevis commentarius, 1613&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, the Holy Crown has been on display in the central Domed Hall of the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]].

*The Crown’s shape is elliptic (the width is 203.9&amp;nbsp;mm, the length is 215.9&amp;nbsp;mm) and is larger than a (healthy) human head. During coronations, the king had to wear a leather 'kapa' liner, made to fit, inside the crown.
*The weight of the Crown is 2056&amp;nbsp;g. (4&amp;nbsp;lb 8.52 oz)
*The gold-silver alloys in the upper and the lower parts of the Crown differ in alloy ratio.
*The lower part of the Crown is asymmetric.&lt;ref&gt;Németh Zsolt: A magyar Szent Korona, BKL Kiadó, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crown, Sword and Globus Cruciger of Hungary2.jpg|thumb|The Crown, Sword, Sceptre and [[Globus Cruciger]] of Hungary, in the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]]]]
As is the case with all European Christian crowns, it symbolizes a halo and thus signifies that the wearer rules by [[Divine right of kings|Divine Right]]. According to popular tradition, [[Stephen I of Hungary|St Stephen I]] held up the crown before his death (in the year 1038) to offer it to the [[Virgin Mary]] to seal a divine contract between her and the divine crown. After this, Mary was depicted not only as ''patrona'' (patron saint) for the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] but also as ''regina'' (i.e. "queen"). This contract was supposed to empower the crown with divine force to help the future kings of Hungary and did help reinforce the political system based on the so-called "Doctrine of the Holy Crown" ({{lang-hu|Szentkorona-tan}}).

[[Péter Révay]], a Crown Guard, expounded this doctrine in his works ''Commentarius De Sacra Regni Hungariae Corona'' (Explanation of the Holy Crown of the Kingdom of Hungary, published in [[Augsburg]], 1613) and ''De monarchia et Sacra Corona Regni Hungariae'' (About the Monarchy and the Holy Crown of Hungary, [[Frankfurt]], 1659).
At the core of this doctrine was the notion that the crown itself had personhood and as a legal entity is identical to the state of Hungary. It is superior to the ruling monarch, who rules "in the name of the crown".

According to the most accepted theory, which is represented in the publications of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and also of the Hungarian Catholic Episcopal Conference,&lt;ref name='Zombori'&gt;Zombori, I, Cséfalvay, P., Maria Antonietta De Angelis: A Thousand Years of Christianity in Hungary – Hungariae Christianae Millennium – Published by the Hungarian Catholic Episcopal Conference, Budapest, 2001, for the exhibition in the Musea of Vatican, Vatican City, 10 October 2001 – 12 January 2002 – under the auspices of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán&lt;/ref&gt; the Holy Crown of Hungary consists of two main parts: "abroncs" (rim, hoop) the ''corona graeca'', and "keresztpántok" (cross straps) the ''corona latina''. It was created during the reign of [[Béla III]] under [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] influence. (The Hungarian king Béla III was brought up in the Byzantine court and was for a period the official heir to the throne there.)
The [[coronation|crowning]] of Stephen I, the first king of [[Hungary]], who was later [[canonization|canonized]] Saint Stephen, marks the beginning of Hungarian statehood. The date is variously given as Christmas 1000 or 1 January 1001.

One version of the origin of the crown is written by bishop [[Hartvik]] (between 1095–1116), in which the "Pope" has sent King Stephen I "his blessings and a crown". The basis for this belief is a biography by bishop Hartvik written around 1100-1110 at the request of King [[Könyves Kálmán]]. According to "Hartvik’s legend", St Stephen sent Archbishop [[Astrik]] of [[Esztergom]] to [[Rome]] to ask for or require (both are possible from original [[Latin]] script) a crown from the "[[Pope]]", but it does not tell the name of the Pope. No matter how much Astrik hurried, the [[Poland|Polish]] prince, [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]]'s envoy was quicker, and the crown was prepared for the future Polish king. The Pope had seen a dream during the night, seeing the angel of the Lord telling him there will be another envoy from another nation, asking for a crown for their own king. The angel told the Pope: "There will be another envoy from an unknown folk, who will ask for [or require] a crown, too, please give the crown to them, as they deserve it". The next day Astrik approached the Pope so he gave the crown to him. "Hartvik’s legend" appeared in the [[liturgical book]]s and breviaries in Hungary around 1200, recalling the then-existing Pope, [[Pope Sylvester II]].

Consequently, the story of how the crown had been sent by Pope Sylvester II spread throughout the Christian world, so in 1613, crown guard Péter Révay states that the entire crown was given to St Stephen by [[Pope Sylvester II]]. However, this legend can be considered a myth, as Mieszko I was not living at the same time as either St. Stephen I or Pope Sylvester II. Also, in the "Greater Legend" of St Stephen, written around the time he was canonised (1083), we learn only that "in the fifth year after the death of his father (...) they brought a Papal letter of blessings (...) and the Lord’s favoured one, Stephen, was chosen to be king, and was anointed with oil and fortunately crowned with the diadem of royal honour". This legend clearly lacks the information that the crown was from Rome. Moreover, there are no documents found in [[Vatican City]] on the granting of the crown, even though the Vatican has a clear interest in handing over the crown from Rome, as it is representing dominance over the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

There is another version on the origin of Holy Crown, which is a popular fallacy: Thietmar von Merseburg (died in 1018) reports that [[Otto III]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] has consented to the coronation of St. Stephen, and the Pope is sending his blessings; so many historians argued he has also sent a crown, however, does not report on any crown, so it cannot follow any fact.

Beside the two main theories – donation by the pope and creation in the time of Béla III – there exist a number of different theories of the more romantic kind, putting the origin of the crown into the far past and into Asia.

The question to what extent the upper part of the Holy Crown indeed belonged to the crown of King Stephen I remained open until 1978, when the coronation insignia was returned to Hungary and a thorough examination could be carried out.

The differing styles and techniques used in making the enamel pictures and the fact that the inscriptions on the diadem are in Greek and on the bands in Latin suggest that the two parts were probably made in two different periods. However, we have to note that there are no known representations of any kind in which the crown is separated: the Holy Crown is always shown as one.

==Type==
The Crown is a [[coronation crown]], which should be worn only on the occasion of a coronation, and for the rest of the time two crown guards (koronaőr) guard it. Apart from this, there are only two other people who can touch it, the ''[[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|nádorispán]]'' (the highest secular title), who puts it onto a pillow during coronation, and the [[Archdiocese of Esztergom|Archbishop of Esztergom]] ([[primate (bishop)|primate]] of Hungary, the highest ecclesiastical title), who places it on the head of the king.

==Structure of the crown and its icons==
[[File:SztKoronaEN.jpg|thumb|360px|Sketch of the enamel icons of the Saints on the Holy Crown (top view, the crown's front side is on the bottom of the image)]]
The Holy Crown was made of gold and decorated with nineteen enamel "pantokrator" picture (pantokrator is a Greek word meaning "the master of the universe") as well as semi-precious stones, genuine pearls, and [[almandine]]. It has three parts: "abroncs" (rim, hoop) (''corona graeca''),  "keresztpántok" (cross straps) (''corona latina''), and the cross on the top, which is today crooked.

There are four hanging pendants ([[pendilia]]) dangling from chains on each side of the diadem and one in the back.

===Corona graeca===
The "abroncs" (rim, hoop) ''corona graeca'' ("Greek Crown") is 5.2&amp;nbsp;cm wide with a diameter of 20.5&amp;nbsp;cm.

The two aquamarine stones with cut surfaces on the back of the diadem were added as replacements by [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|King Matthias II]] (1608–1619). The enamel picture on the front depicts [[Christ Pantokrator]]. On the rim to the right and left of Jesus are pictures of the archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel (archangel)|Gabriel]], followed by half-length images of the Saints [[Saint George|George]] and [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Demetrius]], and [[Saints Cosmas and Damian|Cosmas and Damian]].

[[File:Géza I.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hungarian King [[Géza I of Hungary|Géza I]] on the ''corona graeca'' of the Holy Crown of Hungary]]

In the arched frame on the back of the diadem [[Michael VII Doukas|Emperor Michael VII Doukas]] (1071–1078) is depicted. Below it to the left is the half-length picture of "Kon. Porphyrogennetos", this probably being either Emperor Michael’s brother and co-emperor [[Konstantios Doukas]] or of his son and heir [[Constantine Doukas]], both having been [[Porphyrogenitos|born in the purple]]. To the right there is a picture of the Hungarian King [[Géza I]] (1074–1077), with the [[Greek language|Greek]] inscription: "ΓΕΩΒΙΤΖΑϹ ΠΙΣΤΟϹ ΚΡΑΛΗϹ ΤΟΥΡΚΙΑϹ" (''Geōbitzas pistós králēs Tourkías'', meaning "[[Géza I]], faithful [[kralj]] of the [[Hungary|land of the Turks]]").&lt;ref name="constantine_vii"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3al15wpFWiMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Constantine+VII+Porphyrogenitus+(Emperor+of+the+East)%22&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-eYdUs3tHcSihgfG6YHIAg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=De Administrando Imperio by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus|last=Jenkins|first=Romilly James Heald|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Center for Byzantine Studies|year=1967|isbn=0-88402-021-5|edition=New, revised|series=Corpus fontium historiae Byzantinae|location=Washington, D.C.|page=65|accessdate=28 August 2013}} According to Constantine Porphyrogenitus, writing in his ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (ca. 950 AD) ''"Patzinakia, the [[Pechenegs|Pecheneg realm]], stretches west as far as the [[Siret River]] (or even the [[Carpathian Mountains|Eastern Carpathian Mountains]]), and is four days distant from Tourkia (i.e. Hungary)."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carterfindley"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=ToAjDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT67&amp;dq=khazar+hungary+tourkia&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikypjIuM7cAhXpNpoKHZ5BAfAQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=khazar%20hungary%20tourkia&amp;f=false|title=The Turks in World History|author=Carter Vaughn Findley|page=51|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780195177268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="istvanbaan"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZDgivj7_RAC&amp;pg=PA46|title=Byzanz und Ostmitteleuropa 950–1453: Beiträge zu einer table-ronde des XIX.

The saints and the Greek rulers have [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] while Géza does not. The inscriptions of the emperors’ names are in red, while the Hungarian king’s is in dark blue or black.

The enamel plaques on the circular band, the panel depicting Christ Pantokrator, and the picture of Emperor Michael were all affixed to the crown using different techniques. The picture of the emperor could not be attached to the rim in the same way as the Pantokrator picture on the front. The frame was folded upwards and the picture of the emperor was nailed to the edge. We can thus conclude that the picture of Michael VII was not originally designed for this crown, but was probably used first somewhere else.

The corona graeca with its pointed and arched plaques is identical to the form of the crowns of the Byzantine empresses&lt;ref&gt;missing&lt;/ref&gt; – in other words it was a woman’s crown. It was given by Emperor Michael Dukas VII to King Géza’s wife, known only as [[Synadene]], around 1075. The gift was not a new crown, but rather an old crown designed for a woman that had to be selected from the Emperor’s treasury and remodelled. The enamel pictures that become outdated were removed, since either represented earlier historical figures or were not appropriate for the Hungarian queen according to court protocol. It was in this form that the crown was sent to [[Hungary]].&lt;br /&gt;
There is another view that the Géza depicted on the ''corona graeca'' is not King Géza I but [[Géza, Grand Prince of the Hungarians|St Stephen's father]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Gallus, "The structural aspect: towards a plural society", Quest for a new Central Europe, ed. J. Varsányi, 1976, pp. 130-176, at p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; This view is confirmed by the fact that Grand Prince Géza is depicted on the ''corona gracea'' without a crown, although carrying a royal sceptre.&lt;ref name="Endrey"&gt;

===Corona Latina===
The "keresztpántok" (cross straps) ''corona latina'' ("Latin Crown") is made of four 5.2-cm-wide gold strips welded to the edge of a square central panel (7.2*7.2&amp;nbsp;cm); the strips are usually assumed to have been originally made for some other object, and adapted for the crown. It is not an independent object, as it has no function alone. It was designed to be attached to the top rim of the ''Corona Græca'' and provide a dome-shaped top.

The inscription on the pictures of the saints and the style of their lettering suggest the date when they were made. Amidst the antique-style capital letter, the T in Thomas and the second U in Paulus are formed in the style characteristic of the Latin letters used on Byzantine coins, a practice abandoned in the middle of the eleventh century. They may have decorated a reliquary box or a portable altar given to István I by the pope, or possibly the [[treasure binding]] of a book. It is also possible, although cannot be verified, that István I received a crown as a gift from one of the popes, reciprocating his – historically documented - gifts. The picture of the apostles, however, based on their style, cannot be dated to around 1000.

The intersecting bands are edged with beaded gold wire that closes off the lower end of the bands and finishes off the system of decoration. There are twelve pearls on the central panel and a total of seventy-two altogether on the Corona Latina, symbolising the number of Christ’s disciples,. (Acts 10.1).

The central panel is decorated with a square cloisonné enamel picture depicting Christ Pantokrator. Each band has two (altogether eight) pictures of standing apostles identical to the first eight listed in Acts 1.13.

Éva Kovács and Zsuzsa Lovag&lt;ref name="Kovacs"&gt;''Magyar koronazasi jelvenyek'', Eva Kovacs and Zsuzsa Lovag Budapest: Corvina Kiado, 1980; ''The Hungarian crown and other regalia'' translated by Peter Balban; translated and revised by Mary and Andras Boros-Kazai, pp. 79-80&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the ''corona latina'' was originally a large Byzantine [[liturgical asterisk]] from a Greek monastery in Hungary.  In order to get it to fit into it new role the apostles at the bottom of each of the four arms of this asterisk were cut off before it was very crudely attached to the inside of the corona graeca to transform this Byzantine open crown into a closed crown (i.e., the type of crown proper to the ''Autocrat'', the senior emperor or monarch in Byzantine imperial protocol) and to provide a base for the reliquary cross at its summit  (see '''Cross''').

===Cross===
[[File:Matthias II of Hungary.jpg|thumb|upright|Engraving of [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias II of Hungary]], showing the cross in vertical position]]

The cross is attached to the crown in a rough manner, rising from the midriff of Christ in the central enamel plaque at the top of the crown. This addition might have taken place during the 16th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The cross was knocked crooked in the 17th century when the crown was damaged, possibly by the top of the iron chest housing the insignia being hastily closed without the crown having been placed in it properly.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}  The cross has since been left in this slanted position, and is now typically depicted as such.

Éva Kovács suggests that the present plain cross on the top of the crown is a replacement of an original double-barred reliquary cross containing three pieces of the [[True Cross]] and that it was this presence of the True Cross in the Holy Crown which made it holy.  She states that “Szabolcs Vajay, called to my attention a strange incident in the crown’s history which had completely escaped everybody’s attention. Before [[Isabella Jagiellon|Queen Isabella]] handed over the regalia to [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]] in 1551, she broke the cross off the crown’s peak for her son, John Sigismund.  According to a contemporary Polish chronicler, John Sigismund wore this cross on his chest till the end of his life, “ ... because he who possess this cross will again come into possession of the missing parts which, subjected to the power of the cross, had belonged to it".{{citequote|date = June 2015}}

Later, the cross became the property of Sigismund Bathory who, persuaded by his confessor, bestowed it on Emperor Rudolf II.  This was reported by an Italian envoy in Prague who also told the Isabella-John Sigismund story.”  She also notes that “Several small fragments of the True Cross were in possession of the Arpad dynasty.  As a point of interest, it is precisely the smallest ones, those set into the cross on the chest, that are attributed to St. Stephen.  About a tiny fragment of the True Cross, a Russian chronicler recording King Geza II’s campaigns wrote that it had been the holy king’s property and, despite its small size, it was a relic of great force.  We are, perhaps, not off the track when surmising that the Hungarian crown was holy because it had once been reinforced with a fragment of the victory-bringing relic. . . . we know quite few reliquary crowns.  To mention but the most obvious example, let us cite Charles IV’s crown provided with a cross containing a thorn relic.”&lt;ref name=Kovacs/&gt;

Later, it was the Crown itself, rather than St. Stephen's cross reliquary that came to be regarded as holy through its traditional association with St. Stephen.  Éva Kovács further notes in this regard the early use of the patriarchal or double-barred cross and crown in the ancient Hungarian royal coat of arms.  Since reliquary crosses frequently take such a double-barred form, the use of a patriarchal cross in the royal arms would be a direct reference to and representation of this royal relic.  This association between the crown and this royal relic would also help to substantiate the theory that the Holy Crown was always intended to serve its historical role of legitimatizing the position of its wearer as the true divinely appointed king of Hungary.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}

===The crown as a whole===
[[File:Ferenc József.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph I]] crowned with the Holy Crown as Hungarian king]]

The form of the Holy Crown is identical to that of the [[kamelaukion]]-type crowns with closed tops introduced in the Byzantine Empire. The use of many pictures is also typical of Byzantine crowns. When the intersecting bands were added to the corona graeca during the rule of Béla III, who had been brought up in Constantinople, the bands were decorated just as the corona graeca was, perhaps with the intention of imitating the Byzantine crowns.

===Links to the first Hungarian king, Saint Stephen===
Beside the using of the intersecting bands of the ''corona latina'', which probably came from the treasury of St. István, at the time of the creation of the crown there existed further expectation that the coronation insignia would eventually include additional gold works that could be linked to the first, beatified Hungarian king, István.

The inscription embroidered onto the '''coronation mantle''' indicates with all certainty that István I and Queen Gizella had it made in 1031.

The '''coronation sceptre''' with the orb at the end can also be dated to the time of St István. On the seals of [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]], the rulers are holding identically shaped sceptres. Such short-staffed sceptres ending in orbs were not in use as insignia earlier or later.

==The regalia in modern times==
[[File:HUF 2000 2000 obverse.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Holy Crown on the commemorative 2000 [[Hungarian forint|HUF]] banknote, issued in 2000, the millennium anniversary of the coronation of [[King Saint Stephen]]]]
The Holy Crown has had a lively history, having been stolen, hidden, lost, recovered, and taken abroad many times. During the [[Árpád dynasty]] (1000–1301), the coronation insignia were kept in the coronation city of [[Székesfehérvár]]. Later, the crown was housed in one of three locations: [[Visegrád]] (in [[Pest county]]); [[Bratislava|Pozsony]] (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia); or [[Buda]]. In 1805–1806 the Crown was kept for about three months in the castle at [[Mukachevo|Munkács]] (now Mukachevo, Ukraine). [[Lajos Kossuth]] took the crown and the coronation jewels with him after the collapse of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] and buried them in a wooden box in a willow forest, near [[Orşova]] in [[Transylvania]] (Romania). They were subsequently dug up and returned to the royal castle in Buda in 1853.

At the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] the [[crown jewels]] were recovered in [[Mattsee]], Austria, on 4&amp;nbsp;May 1945 by the [[86th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 86th Infantry Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/history/marshall/military/mil_hist_inst/h/hungary.asc|title=Hungary: Recovery of Crown Jewels 1945|accessdate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crown jewels were transported to Western Europe and eventually given to the [[United States Army]] by the [[Hungarian Crown]] Guard for safekeeping from the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/museum/crown.phtml|title=Jimmy Carter Library: The Crown of St. Stephen|accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For much of the [[Cold War]] the crown was held at the [[United States Bullion Depository]] ([[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]]) alongside the bulk of America's gold reserves and other priceless historical items. After undergoing extensive historical research to verify the crown as genuine, it was returned to Hungary by order of U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] on 6&amp;nbsp;January 1978. Most current academic knowledge about Hungarian royal garments originates from this modern research. Following substantial U.S. political debate, the agreement to return the jewels contained many conditions to ensure the people of Hungary, rather than its Communist government, took possession of the jewels.&lt;ref name='The Gulya Pot'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegulyaspot.com/site/?q=node/148 |title=The Hungarian Crown |accessdate=2009-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220123521/http://www.thegulyaspot.com/site/?q=node%2F148 |archivedate=February 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St stephens crown mukachevo plaque.JPG|thumb|right|Plaque at [[Mukacheve|Munkács]] Castle commemorating the guarding of the Crown there in 1805–1806]]After the fall of [[Communism]], the crown was reincorporated into the [[Coat of arms of Hungary|national coat of arms]] in 1990, the National Assembly choosing the pre-war coat of arms in preference to the crown-less [[Lajos Kossuth|Kossuth]] arms of 1849.

==Other coronation regalia==
Uniquely in Europe, most of the medieval ensemble of [[coronation regalia]] has survived. On 1&amp;nbsp;January 2000, the Holy Crown of Hungary was moved to the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]] from the [[Hungarian National Museum]]. The [[sceptre]], [[globus cruciger|orb]] and the coronation sword were also moved to the Parliament.

The very large [[coronation]] [[Mantle (royal garment)|mantle]] remains in a glass [[Inert gas#Applications|inert gas vault]] at the National Museum due to its delicate, faint condition. Unlike the crown and accompanying insignia, the originally red coloured mantle is considered to date back to Stephen I, and was made circa 1030. Old records describe the robe as handiwork of the queen and her [[sister]]s and the mantle's middle back bears the king's only known portrait (which shows his crown was not the currently existing one). A circular inscription sewn in Latin identifies the coat as a bishop's [[chasuble]].

The sceptre is considered the artistically most valuable piece of the Hungarian royal inventory. It contains a solid [[quartz|rock crystal]] ball decorated with engraved lions, a rare product of the 10th-century [[Fatimid]] caliphate. Its handle contains a wooden rod surrounded by very fine wrought silver ornaments.

The ceremonial straight sword kept in the Holy Crown collection is a 14th-century Italian product. However, what is said to be an original coronation sword of Stephen I has been in [[Prague]]'s [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] since 1368.&lt;ref&gt;The sword has a walrus-tooth hilt decorated in the [[Mammen style]], dated to the 10th century.

A [[lance]] claimed to have belonged to King Stephen I, and seen in the Mantle portrait, was reportedly obtained by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] circa 1100.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13196">'''Interprofessional education''' (also known as inter-professional education or “IPE”) refers to occasions when students from two or more professions in health and social care learn together during all or part of their [[professional training]] with the object of cultivating collaborative practice&lt;ref&gt;Centre for the Advancement of Interprofessional Education (CAIPE), 1997. ''Interprofessional education - a definition''. London: CAIPE Bulletin 13, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; for providing client- or [[patient]]-centered [[health care]].

==Overview==
Interprofessional learning involves students learning from students from other professions, as well as learning with students from other professions, for example in the classroom, and learning about other professions. Interprofessional learning and teaching can take place at an academic institution, but also regularly occurs in workplace environments where students gain applicable and practical experience.

Associated terms include "multi-professional education", "common learning", "shared learning", and "[[interdisciplinary]] learning." In contrast to multiprofessional education interprofessional education involves interactive learning focused on active collaboration. It is primarily used in the domains of health and social care, where collaborative and patient-centred practice are expected to improve the effectiveness of health care and the quality of life of health &amp; social service users.

There is debate about the effectiveness of interprofessional education in enabling collaborative practice. Research and [[systematic review]]s continue to identify some evidence of effectiveness in changing [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} But more empirical evidence of longer term impact is needed, particularly in respect of effects on [[Quality (business)|service quality]] and service [[Consumer|users]]’ and [[patient]]s’ experience. Nevertheless, more evaluations of IPE have been conducted than for many other commonly accepted educational approaches.

==WHO Study Group and World Committee on Interprofessional Education &amp; Collaborative Practice==
Recognizing the importance of interprofessional education as one of the innovative approaches that can help tackle the global [[Health Human Resources|health workforce]] challenge, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) convened a WHO Study Group on Interprofessional Education &amp; Collaborative Practice in 2007&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, 2007. [http://www.who.int/hrh/professionals/announcement.pdf ''World Health Organization Study Group on Interprofessional Education and Collaborative Practice''], accessed 15 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; to articulate a greater understanding of this issue within a global context. It was tasked with providing guidance to Member States on how they could use interprofessional collaboration to scale-up and build more flexible health workforces that enable local health needs to be met efficiently and effectively while maximizing resources.

The WHO Study Group engaged various partners and undertook a program of work that culminated in the publication of WHO’s ''Framework for Action on Interprofessional Education and Collaborative Practice''&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, 2010. [http://www.who.int/hrh/resources/framework_action/en/index.html ''Framework for action on interprofessional education and collaborative practice'']. Geneva: WHO Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in March 2010. The Framework highlights the current status of interprofessional collaboration around the world, identifies the mechanisms that shape successful collaborative teamwork, and outlines a series of action items that policymakers can apply within their local [[health system]]. It provides strategies and ideas that can help [[health policy]]makers implement the elements of interprofessional education and collaborative practice that will be most beneficial in their own jurisdiction.

The WHO Study Group consisted of almost 30 top education, practice and policy experts from across every region of the world. Overall leadership was provided by Co-Chairs Prof. John HV Gilbert (University of British Columbia &amp; Canadian Interprofessional Health Collaborative) and Dr. Jean Yan (World Health Organization) and a secretariat led by Mr. Steven J. Hoffman (World Health Organization). This led to a report describing the necessity to act on changes in (higher) education and in clinical institutions to implement and secure interprofessional collaborative practice.

Partners included the following organizations:
*Australasian Interprofessional Practice and Education Network
*Canadian Interprofessional Health Collaborative
*European Interprofessional Practice and Education Network
*International Association for Interprofessional Education and Collaborative Practice
*Journal of Interprofessional Care
*National Health Sciences Students’ Association, Canada
*Nordic Interprofessional Network
*The Network: Towards Unity for Health
*UK Centre for the Advancement of Interprofessional Education

Since 2012 a World Committee is active, supervising the biennial All Together Better Health (ATBH) Conferences and overarching the regional networks around the world. The management structure of this World Committee was restructured in 2015, with Prof. Andre Vyt serving as first chair.

==Medical School Curriculum==
Interprofessional education (IPE) is becoming a more common component of medical school curriculum in the United States. IPE programs have existed transiently at various schools since the 1960s, but interprofessional education programs are growing, as they are increasingly viewed as a means of reducing medical errors and improving the health care system.&lt;ref name=USNews&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/articles/2012/03/19/medical-schools-push-teamwork |title=Medical Schools Push Teamwork |author=Kathryn Roethel |date=March 19, 2012 |work= |publisher=US News &amp; World Report |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coalition members discuss value of collaboration in diabetes patient care |author=Coalition for Patients' Rights |url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/20120409/Coalition-members-discuss-value-of-collaboration-in-diabetes-patient-care.aspx |newspaper=News Medical |date=April 9, 2012 |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following medical schools currently have interprofessional programs as a part of their curriculum:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2668">'''Konstantin Romanovich Eiges''' (surname sometimes spelt '''Eyges''', [[Russian language|Russian]] Константин Романович Эйгес,  24 May ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]])/ 5 June 1875—2 Dec 1950) was a Russian composer, teacher and pianist.

Eiges was born in [[Bogodukhov]] (now Bohodukhiv in [[Kharkiv oblast]], [[Ukraine]]), to [[Jew]]ish parents, the doctor Ruvim Manasiyevich (also known as Roman Mikhailovich)  Eiges (born [[Vilnius]], 1840) and his wife Sofiya (Shifra) Iosifovna, née Eltsin. He was one of ten children, many of whom went on to artistic or academic careers; Vladimir Eiges (1877-1949) was a professor of mathematics, Aleksandr (1880-1943), also a mathematician, was an authority on [[Anton Chekhov]], Veniamin (1888-1956) was an artist, Yekaterina (1890-1958) was a poet and sometime girlfriend of [[Sergei Esenin]].&lt;ref&gt;Powell (2015), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eiges attended [[Moscow Conservatory]] between 1900 and 1905, where his teachers included  [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov]] (composition), [[Sergei Taneyev]] (counterpoint) and Adolf Yaroshevsky (piano).&lt;ref&gt;Powell (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; He was a colleague of [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] and [[Nikolai Medtner]]. His pupils included  [[Alexei Stanchinsky]]. Most of his compositions are for piano solo, though he also wrote songs and chamber works, a [[cantata]] ''The Song of Oleg the Wise'', and a [[symphonic poem]], ''The Snowstorm''. Eiges wrote numerous essays on music and philosophy, including essays on [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Alexander Skriabin]].

Eiges was the father of the composer Oleg Eiges (1905-1992) and the artist Sergei Eiges (1910-1944).

Lewes is home to the largest and most celebrated of the festivities in the [[Sussex Bonfire Societies|Sussex bonfire tradition]].  There are seven societies putting on six separate parades and firework displays throughout Lewes on November the 5th. As well as this, 25-30 societies from all around Sussex come to Lewes on the fifth to march the streets. This can mean up to 5,000 people taking part in the celebrations, and up to 80,000 spectators attending in the county market town with a population of just over 17,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Daily Telegraph|title=Flaming passions|last=Hanna|first=Nick|date=2005-10-08|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/artsandculture/733760/Flaming-passions.html|accessdate=2010-11-06|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/viewFullDataset.do?instanceSelection=03070&amp;productId=779&amp;$ph=60_61&amp;datasetInstanceId=3070&amp;startColumn=1&amp;numberOfColumns=8&amp;containerAreaId=790382|publisher=Office for National Statistics|title=Census 2001: Parish Headcounts: Lewes|accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of bonfire celebrations on 5 November throughout the United Kingdom have their origins with the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605, where a group of [[Catholic Church in England and Wales|English Catholics]], including the now infamous [[Guy Fawkes]], were foiled in their plot to blow up the [[House of Lords]].  

The following January, an act entitled ‘An Acte for a publique Thanksgiving to Almighty God ever year of the Fifth day of November’ was passed, which held that 5 November should be held in perpetual remembrance of the plot, with a special service held in every [[Church of England]] parish church.&lt;ref name="cliffehistory"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Cliffe Bonfire Society|title=History of Bonfire|url=http://www.cliffebonfire.com/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrations in Lewes were not planned or carried out annually, but were more random events that more closely resembled riots. They continued until they were banned by [[Oliver Cromwell]] during [[Commonwealth of England|the Commonwealth]]. However, they were reintroduced when [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] returned, but still on a random basis. Interest waned by the end of the 18th century but in the 1820s large groups of Bonfire Boys started celebrating with fireworks and large bonfires. The celebrations became rowdier and rowdier until 1847, when police forces were drafted in from London to sort out the Bonfire Boys. There were riots and fighting, and restrictions were clamped down on the celebrators, their locations moved to Wallands Park, at that time fields, not the suburb it is today. However, in 1850 they were allowed back to the High Streets. By this time the former riots had become much more like the processions carried out today. In 1853 the first two societies, [[Lewes Bonfire#Cliffe|Cliffe]] and [[Lewes Bonfire#Lewes Borough|Lewes Borough]] were founded, and most of the others were founded later in the same century.  The cult of the Sussex martyrs was instigated at a time of the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy in England, bolstered by an increase in the Irish Catholic population, as well as the high-profile conversion to Catholicism of members of the Oxford movement, including Cardinal Newman and former [[Archdeacon of Chichester]], [[Henry Edward Manning]].  In the mid 19th century the practice of burning an effigy of Pope Paul V at the Lewes Bonfire celebrations began.  Paul V was a peaceable man who happened to be pope at the time of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and who cannot be held responsible for the Gunpowder Plot or the persecution protestants in the reign of Mary I, which were linked at this time by a misunderstanding of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goring|2003|p=157.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1893 William Richardson, rector of the Southover district of Lewes, held sermons on the Sunday before 5 November warning about the perils of Catholicism.  Many attendees were members of the newly-formed [[Orange Lodge]] in Lewes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goring|2003|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a history of religious antagonism and anti-popery around the bonfire celebrations in Lewes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flint|Kelly|2013|p=89.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1930s the mayor of Lewes requested that 'no popery' banners be removed and an end to the burning of effigies of Pope Paul V.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flint|Kelly|2013|p=89.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1950s the Cliffe Bonfire Society was banned from the Bonfire Council from taking part in the United Grand Procession for its refusal to stop carrying a 'no popery' banner and banners commemorating the 16th century Protestant martyrs burned at Lewes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flint|Kelly|2013|p=89.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1981 [[Ian Paisley]] visited Lewes on Bonfire Night and tried to fan the flames of conflict by handing out anti-Catholic pamphlets.  His intervention back-fired and the following year he was burned in effigy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goring|2003|p=157.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, anti-Catholic attitudes are rare and the militant Calvinism that continues in Northern Ireland is all but extinct in Lewes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goring|2003|p=157.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 21st century, controversy continues to be associated around the Bonfire societies and competing definitions of tradition and bigotry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flint|Kelly|2013|p=89.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, the burning in effigy of Pope Paul V was described in 2012 as "a scandalous piece of stone-cold bigotry"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://leftfootforward.org/2012/11/bonfire-night-bigotry-lewes/|title=Bonfire Nightbigotry is alive and well in Lewes|last=Meagher|first=Kevin|publisher=[[Left Foot Forward]]|date=5 November 2012|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017 the Lewes Borough Bonfire Society agreed to end the tradition of blacking-up and wearing skulls and horns as part of its Zulu costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/05/lewes-bonfire-society-ends-tradition-criticised-for-being-racist|title=Lewes bonfire society ends tradition of blacking-up|publisher=The Guardian|first=Robert|last=Booth|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==

To mark the demise of the [[Lewes Martyrs|17 Lewes Martyrs]], 17 [[burning cross]]es are carried through the town, and a wreath-laying ceremony occurs at the War Memorial in the centre of town. Ladies’ and men’s races take place, pulling flaming tar barrels in a "barrel run", which takes place along Cliffe High Street at the start of the evening. A flaming tar barrel is then thrown into the [[River Ouse, Sussex|River Ouse]]; this is said to symbolise the throwing of the magistrates into the river after they read the [[Riot Act]] to the bonfire boys in 1847. The festivities culminate in five separate bonfire displays.

A number of large [[effigy|effigies]] are drawn through the streets before being burned at the bonfires. Each year these include [[Guy Fawkes]], as well as [[Pope Paul V]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cliffebonfire.com/ |title=Cliffe Bonfire Society web site |publisher=Cliffebonfire.com |date=2010-10-21 |accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; who became head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in 1605. In addition, each of the five main local societies creates a topical "tableau",(a large three-dimensional model packed with fireworks) and the Cliffe and Southover societies display on pikes the heads (also in effigy) of its current "Enemies of Bonfire", who range from nationally reviled figures to local officials who have attempted to place restrictions on the event. In 2001 effigies of [[Osama bin Laden]] were burned by the Cliffe, Commercial Square and Lewes Borough bonfire societies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sussex Express Report 2001 - Lewes Bonfire Night Celebrations|url=http://www.lewesbonfirecelebrations.com/article/lewes-bonfire-sussex-express-report-2001/|work=Lewes Bonfire Celebrations|quote=Cliffe had him sitting on a lavatory in their main tableau. Borough produced him in effigy and Commercial Square displayed him in the ‘flesh’, walking in front of a hissing crowd in the united procession.}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing the Lewes Bonfire to receive more press attention than usual, being featured on the front page of some national newspapers, as did the Firle Bonfire Society’s 2003 choice of a [[Romani people|gypsy]] caravan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1446744/How-tradition-lit-the-fuse-for-gipsy-effigy.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Toby | last=Helm | title=How tradition lit the fuse for gipsy effigy | date=2003-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 police investigated complaints about plans to burn two effigies of [[Alex Salmond]], the [[First Minister of Scotland]], and one model was subsequently withdrawn from the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-29921797 | title=Police investigate Alex Salmond bonfire effigy | publisher=BBC News | date=6 November 2014 | accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 effigies of [[David Cameron]] [[Piggate|with a pig]], [[Jeremy Clarkson]] and [[Sepp Blatter]] were burned.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/lewes-bonfire-naked-david-cameron-6777404&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' has described the night as "a head-on collision of [[Halloween]] and [[Mardi Gras]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Daily Telegraph|title=Ten Guy Fawkes celebrations|date=2008-11-01|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/3362168/Ten-Guy-Fawkes-celebrations.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 80,000 people have been known to attend this local spectacle, coming from all over the South and sometimes further afield. As the event has grown in recent years, the police presence on the night has increased to deal with the large crowds attracted to the event. The event is organised by the local [[Sussex Bonfire Societies|bonfire societies]], under the auspices of the Lewes Bonfire Council&lt;ref name="Lewes Bonfire Council"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewesbonfirecouncil.org.uk/ |title=Lewes Bonfire Council |publisher=Lewes Bonfire Council |date= |accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with [[Sussex Police]], [[Surrey Police]] and [[East Sussex Fire &amp; Rescue Service]]. [[St John Ambulance (England and the Islands)|St John Ambulance]] has treatment centres and ambulances around procession routes and bonfire sites to care for anyone who has been injured. In recent years, railway stations at Lewes, Falmer, Glynde at Southease have had planned closures for the duration of the event due to foreseeable overcrowding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lewes-eastbourne.gov.uk/leisure-and-events/lewes-bonfire/lewes-bonfire-travel-information/|title=Lewes bonfire travel information|last=|first=|date=2018-09-24|website=Lewes and Eastbourne Councils|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bonfire societies==
Bonfire night in Lewes hosts seven bonfire societies from nearby towns and villages. All societies attend "outmeetings" or "outfires" (the nomenclature varies between the societies), where they march with the societies from other towns and villages nearby on their respective bonfire nights, before or after the Fifth in Lewes. On the Fifth, the first six societies process separately around their own particular quarters before all except the Cliffe and South Street join together in Western Road to parade down St. Anne's Street, the High Street and School Hill, followed by societies from other towns and villages. After several processions, including acts of Remembrance for the war dead, each society marches to its own fire site on the edge of the town, where there is a large bonfire and firework display, and effigies are burned. The societies then return to their headquarters for [[Guy Fawkes Night#Traditional rhymes|Bonfire Prayers]]. Whilst marching nearly all members carry torches, some ignite and drop [[firecrackers|bangers]] (locally called "rookies", short for rook scarers),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portek.co.uk/Banger%20Ropes_Index.html |title=Portek Ltd Banger Ropes |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some carry burning crosses, banners, musical instruments or burning letters spelling out the initials of the society. Many of those processing wear "smuggler uniforms" (striped jumpers, white trousers, black boots and optional red hats), with each society having a different coloured jumper. Members have to make or buy their own costumes. Torch-making is a time-consuming process and begins in September, with many society members joining in. 

===Cliffe===

The Cliffe, founded in 1853, traditionally represents the Cliffe and Lansdown areas of Lewes (centred around Cliffe High Street), but recently they've also claimed the South Malling suburb with the addition of the "Malling Bonfire Society". Their smugglers' jumpers are black and white, and the pioneer fronts are [[Viking]]s and French Revolutionaries. The Dorset Arms is the society's headquarters, and the local church is [[St. Thomas à Becket]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewesbonfirecouncil.org.uk/societies/cbs/index.html |title=The Member Societies: Cliffe Bonfire Society |publisher=Lewes Bonfire Council |date=2006-10-30 |accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the only society to march under a "No Popery" banner and to continue in the tradition to "burn" (more accurately explode with fireworks)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Dea|first1=Sharon|title=Burning the Pope|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/highgateharridan/289642278/|publisher=flickr}}&lt;/ref&gt; an effigy of [[Pope Paul V]] at Bonfire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lewes Bonfire Night guide: What time do the processions and fireworks start and what is the history of the event?|url=https://www.crawleynews.co.uk/times-Lewes-Bonfire-Night-fireworks-procession/story-24186416-detail/story.html|accessdate=15 April 2015|work=Crawley News|quote=Cliffe Bonfire Society still marches under the No Popery banner and they also burn the Pope.  Not the current Pope, though, the Pope in 1605 - Paul V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial Square===

Founded in 1855, they represent the St. John's area north of Lewes Castle, based on Commercial Square, which is where their headquarters, the Elephant and Castle pub, is based. The pioneers are [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s (this theme was picked after Lewesians visited the US in the 19th century and realised their hardships) and [[American Civil War]] soldiers, and the smugglers wear gold and black jumpers. The society also claims the Wallands Park and Landport suburbs. The local church is [[Church of St John sub Castro, Lewes|St John sub Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewesbonfirecouncil.org.uk/societies/commercial/index.html |title=The Member Societies: Commercial Square Bonfire Society |publisher=Lewes Bonfire Council |date=2006-10-30 |accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lewes Borough===

Lewes Borough is the joint oldest society with Cliffe, formed in 1853. Until 1859 they were known as the ‘Lewes Bonfire Society’ and have been marching the streets of the town for over 150 years.
Borough is the ‘home’ of the Zulu which is their First Pioneer Group and the Tudor which is the Society’s Second Pioneer Group. Their jumpers are blue and white.  
In 1863 the famous Monster Iron Key of the Ancient Borough of Lewes weighing nearly a quarter hundredweight,(over 12 kilos) was carried in the procession for the first time. The same key is still carried today in the Borough’s processions and is a symbol that on 5 November the ‘Borough Boys’ are given the freedom of the streets of Lewes. Representing the western half of Lewes and located on Western Road, their headquarters is St. Mary's Social Club, which unlike the others, is not a pub. The local church is [[St. Anne]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewesbonfirecouncil.org.uk/societies/borough/index.html |title=The Member Societies: Lewes Borough Bonfire Society |publisher=Lewes Bonfire Council |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southover===

Southover has roots in the mid-19th century but it disbanded in 1985, and then reformed in 2005. It represents the Cranedown and St. Pancras areas as well as the old village of Southover. Located on Southover High Street, the local church is [[St. John the Baptist]]'s, where there is a war memorial, and the headquarters is the King's Head. Their jumpers are red and black and their pioneers are [[monk]]s (representing the remains of the Priory of St. Pancras nearby) and [[buccaneer]]s. Southover march with the British Imperial Marching Band, the Pentacle Drummers, and either Pandemonium or Earthquake drumming bands. Banners carried include a large [[Tudor rose]] (to represent [[Anne of Cleves' House]] on Southover High Street) and a banner bearing a picture of [[William III of England|William of Orange]] landing at Brixham in southwest England on 5 November 1688.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewesbonfirecouncil.org.uk/societies/southover/index.html |title=The Member Societies: Southover Bonfire Society |publisher=Lewes Bonfire Council |date=2008-10-22 |accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southover's firesite is at the Convent Field, behind Lewes Football Club. Southover has a particular affinity with Remembrance, and holds a service at its own war memorial as well as one at the main town war memorial.

===South Street===

South Street was formed in 1913 as a society for the children of members of the Cliffe;  however, both Cliffe and South Street now accept members of all ages. Their jumpers are brown and cream, and their pioneers are (first) [[Colonialism|Colonial Period]] (mid-18th century) and (second) [[English Civil War]] (mid-17th century) soldiers. They are based on South Street and the small area to the west between it and the [[River Ouse, Sussex|River Ouse]], and their headquarters is The Snowdrop, South Street. Their firesite is on the Railway Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewesbonfirecouncil.org.uk/societies/southstreet/index.html |title=The Member Societies: South Street Bonfire Society |publisher=Lewes Bonfire Council |date=2006-10-30 |accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waterloo===

Waterloo was reformed in 1954&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Member Societies:  Waterloo Bonfire Society|url=http://www.lewesbonfirecouncil.org.uk/societies/waterloo/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and represents the area just to the east of the main Commercial Square part (there is a fair bit of overlap between the two) based on Market Street, a quarter of Lewes with little population as it was heavily destroyed by the local planning council to make way for roads. Waterloo's jumpers are red and white and their pioneers are [[Mongol]]s and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]]s and [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s. Their headquarters is the Lamb Inn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewesbonfirecouncil.org.uk/societies/waterloo/index.html |title=The Member Societies: Waterloo Bonfire Society |publisher=Lewes Bonfire Council |date=2008-10-16 |accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nevill Juvenile===

Founded in 1967 specifically for children, Nevill has remained a juvenile society and represents the Nevill Estate. Their headquarters is St. Mary's Social Centre. They hold their celebrations a week or two before the other societies with help from those six. Their pioneers are [[Valencia (province)|Valencians]], Medieval, and British Military (1900-1950)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njbs.co.uk/members.htm |title=Nevill Juvenile Bonfire Society |publisher=Njbs.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; their jumpers green and white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewesbonfirecouncil.org.uk/societies/nevill/index.html |title=The Member Societies: Nevill Juvenile Bonfire Society |publisher=Lewes Bonfire Council |date=2006-10-30 |accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Luck &amp; Logic'''''|ラクエンロジック|Raku en Rojikku}} is a media franchise created by [[Bushiroad]] with five other companies: [[Bandai Visual]], [[Doga Kobo]], [[Nitroplus]], [[Lantis (company)|Lantis]], and Yuhodo. It consists of a [[trading card game]], with the first products released on February 28, 2016, and an [[anime]] television series by [[Doga Kobo]].

==Plot==
The story takes place in the year L.C. 922, where the whole of mankind is facing an unprecedented crisis. Following the end of a 100-year war on the mythical world of Tetraheaven, the Majins who lost the war sought a safe haven and invaded the human world (called 'Septpia'). The government was forced to fight by dispatching Logicalists who are part of the ALCA, a special police force dedicated to protecting the streets from the foreigners of another world. These Logicalists are given a special power that will allow them to enter a 'trance' with the Goddesses from the other world.

One day, Yoshichika Tsurugi, a seemingly ordinary civilian living peacefully with his family and lacking 'Logic' meets the beautiful Goddess [[Athena]] after saving some people from a Majin attack. [[Athena]] possesses the 'Logic' that Yoshichika should have lost. What kind of unexpected destiny awaits these two? The fate of the world's future is decided by the 'Luck' and 'Logic' of these Logicalists.

== Trading Card Game ==
The Luck &amp; Logic trading card game was officially released in Japan on January 28, 2016. Trial deck 1 and 2, Brave Logic and Rinne Logic respectively, as well as the first booster expansion, Growth &amp; Genesis, was released in English on the 24th of June 2016. Booster set 5, Trance Re:union, was the last set released for English edition of the game, which released the 31st of March 2017.

=== Gameplay ===
Luck &amp; Logic is played between two players with pre-constructed decks. Players take turns playing cards, using abilities, and initiating battles. The game ends when one of two win conditions are met.

=== Win Conditions ===
There are two win conditions in Luck &amp; Logic. A player wins by destroying all six of his opponent's gates or when his opponent refreshes twice. Refreshing is the act of shuffling one's drop zone back into the deck.

=== Deck Construction ===
These decks consist of 60 cards in total, 50 cards in the main deck and 10 cards in the gate deck. The main deck contains member, tactics, and paradox cards, and the gate deck must consist of exactly 10 gate cards. You may have up to four cards of the same name in the main deck, and up to two cards of the same Gate number in the gate deck.

=== Card Types ===

==== Member ====
There are three types of members in Luck &amp; Logic: Logicalists, Foreigners, and Tranceunions.

Logicalists and Foreigners are members that can combine through Trance to form Tranceunions. These members can be played from hand or "sortied" by paying its cost using "stock," as long as its level is equal to or less than the number of cards in the player's level zone. Tranceunions may have a Logic Drive ability that can be played in the main phase, as long as the Tranceunion has "soul" under it. Tranceunions obtain "soul" when they are played through the Trance method. If they are played from the hand without using Trance, they do not have "soul" and cannot use their Logic Drive.

==== Tactics ====
Tactics cards are "event" cards that can be played during a battle, and they give the player's member an advantage in the battle.

==== Paradox ====
Paradoxes are horizontal cards that, like Tactics cards, can be played during a battle. These paradoxes change the rules of the battle and may swing the outcome of the battle.

==== Gate ====
These are the cards that make up the gate deck. The gate cards are placed face-down on every circle. When a gate is destroyed, it is flipped face-up. Destroying all of the opponent's gates is a win condition.

'''Maore Comorian''', or '''''Shimaore''''' ([[French language|French]] ''Mahorais''), is one of the two indigenous languages spoken in the [[France|French]]-ruled [[Comoro Islands|Comorian]] islands of [[Mayotte]]; Shimaore being a dialect of the [[Comorian language|Comorian]] language, while [[Bushi language|ShiBushi]] is an unrelated [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language]] originally from [[Madagascar]].  Historically, Shimaore- and ShiBushi-speaking villages on Mayotte have been clearly identified, but Shimaore tends to be the ''de facto'' indigenous ''[[lingua franca]]'' in everyday life, because of the larger Shimaore-speaking population.  Only Shimaore is represented on the local television news program by [[Réseau France Outre-mer|RFO]].  The 2002 census references 80,140 speakers of Shimaore in Mayotte itself, to which one would have to add people living outside the island, mostly in metropolitan France.  There are also 20,000 speakers of Comorian in Madagascar, of which 3,000 are Shimaore speakers.

The same 2002 census indicates that 37,840 persons responded as knowing how to read or write Shimaore.  However this number has to be taken with caution, since it was a few years after this census was taken that a standard writing system was introduced.

From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, [[French language|French]] tends to be regarded by many Shimaore speakers as the language of higher education and prestige, and there is a temptation by native Mahorans to provide an all-French education to their children.  This puts a lot of pressure on Shimaore and the language may become endangered in the near future if nothing is done.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Although French remains the official language in Mayotte, Shimaore will probably be taught in Mahoran schools starting in the next few years, and a pilot project began in fall 2004.  As in many parts of France where local languages are introduced in the school system, this has led to tensions between partisans of a French-centered education system and administrations, versus those promoting a more diversified approach.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  Shimaore's position in this regard is however different from other French regions (such as [[Brittany]]), since the language is locally spoken by a majority of the population.  The project in Mayotte has been inspired by similar projects involving [[Swahili language|Swahili]] in eastern Africa countries.

Mayotte is a geographically small territory, but frequent exchanges between villages have not started until the last quarter of the twentieth century.  As of 2004, linguistic differences between the east and west part of the island, and between the main city of Mamoudzou and the remote villages, are still noticeable, especially when it comes to phonological differences.  One typical example is the word ''u-la'' (to eat), notably pronounced this way in the city due to the influence of a brand of yogurt bearing the same name, but pronounced ''u-dja'' in other parts of the island.

==Orthography==
Shimaore was traditionally written with an informal [[French alphabet|French]]-based [[Latin script|Latin]] alphabet.  On 22 February 2006, the ''Conseil de la Culture, de l'Education et de l'Environnement de Mayotte'' introduced an official alphabet developed by ''Association ShiMé'' that utilizes the basic Latin alphabet without c, q, and x and adds three letters: ɓ, ɗ, and v̄.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shime.free.fr/linguist_04.htm Alphabet du Shimaore] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720225949/http://shime.free.fr/linguist_04.htm |date=2011-07-20 }} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jennings collated the excerpts between 1937 and his early death in 1950.

Cottrell Boyce commented "Danny had a very clear idea that in the first 15 minutes [of the ceremony] you had to have a great, startling image that could go around the world. It had to climax with something that made people go, Oh my God!", and Boyle decided that "the journey from the pastoral to the industrial, ending with the forging of the Olympic rings" was that image.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6608">A '''pastoral society''' is a social group of pastoralists, whose way of life is based on [[pastoralism]], and is typically nomadic.  Daily life is centered upon the tending of herds or flocks.

==Social organization==
There is not an explicit form of social organization associated with pastoralism. Pastoral societies are often organized in [[tribe]]s, with the ‘household,' often incorporating the extended family, as a basic unit for organization of labor and expenses&lt;ref&gt;(Bates, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lineage (anthropology)|Lineages]] are often the root for property rights. Mobility allows groups of pastoralists to leave and regroup as resources permit, or as sought after with changes in social relations.

==Cross-border pastoralism==
Sometimes pastoralists move their herds across international borders in search of new grazing or for trade. This cross-border activity can occasionally lead to tensions with national governments as this activity is often informal and beyond their control and regulation. In East Africa, for example, over 95% of cross-border trade is through unofficial channels and the unofficial trade of live cattle, camels, sheep and goats from [[Ethiopia]] sold to [[Somalia]], [[Kenya]] and [[Djibouti]] generates an estimated total value of between US$250 and US$300 million annually (100 times more than the official figure).&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Pavanello, Sara 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4997&amp;title=working-across-borders-harnessing-potential-cross-border-activities-improve-livelihood-security-horn-africa-drylands Working across borders - Harnessing the potential of cross-border activities to improve livelihood security in the Horn of Africa drylands]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions and promote regional integration.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; However, there are also risks as the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allow disease to spread more easily across national borders. Furthermore, governments are unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

There have been initiatives seeking to promote cross-border trade and also document it, in order to both stimulate regional growth and food security, but also allow the effective vaccination of livestock.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Initiatives include Regional Resilience Enhancement  Against Drought (RREAD), the Enhanced Livelihoods in Mandera Triangle/Enhanced Livelihoods in Southern Ethiopia (ELMT/ELSE) as part of the Regional Enhanced Livelihoods in Pastoral Areas (RELPA) programme in East Africa, and the Regional Livelihoods Advocacy Project (REGLAP) funded by the [[European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office|European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHAO)]].&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

===Modern===
One of the consequences of the break-up of the Soviet Union and the subsequent political independence and economic collapse of its [[Central Asian]] republics is the resurgence of pastoral [[nomadism]]. Taking the [[Kyrgyz people]] as a representative example, nomadism was the centre of their economy prior to Russian colonization at the turn of the C19/C20, when they were settled into agricultural villages. The population became increasingly urbanized after World War II, but some people continued to take their herds of horses and cows to the high pasture (''jailoo'') every summer. Since the 1990s, as the cash economy shrank, unemployed relatives were absorbed back on the family farm, and the importance of this form of nomadism has increased. The symbols of nomadism, specifically the crown of the grey felt tent known as the [[yurt]], appears on the national flag, emphasizing the centrality of their nomadic history and past in the creation of the modern nation of [[Kyrgyzstan]].

'''Peckerwood''' is a term used in the [[Southern United States]] for a [[woodpecker]] which is also used as a derogatory term for white people, especially [[poor white|poor rural whites]].&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite OED|peckerwood}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally an [[ethnic slur]], the term has been embraced by a subculture related to [[prison gangs]] and [[outlaw motorcycle club]]s.&lt;ref name= "Etym-Online"&gt;{{OEtymD|peckerwood|accessdate=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mezzrow"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mezzrow |first=Mezz |author-link= |title=Really the Blues |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=V_qO1Foszj8C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=peckerwoods&amp;redir_esc=y |access-date= |year=1946 |publisher=Kensington |location=New York |isbn=9780806512051 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Killens"&gt;{{cite book |last=Killens |first=John Oliver |author-link= |title=Sippi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKxiAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=peckerwood |access-date=10 May 2016 |year=1967 |publisher=Trident Press |location=New York |lccn=67016400 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ADL"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/peckerwood.html| title =Hate On Display: Peckerwood| publisher =ADL| access-date =10 May 2016|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originates in [[Glossary of jive talk|Jive]] and was in use as an inversion of ''woodpecker'' by the 1830s, with the sense referring to white people documented from the 1850s.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; African-American folklore in the 1920s contrasted the white "peckerwood" bird with the African-American [[New World blackbird|blackbird]].&lt;ref name="ADL" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|peckerwood|accessdate=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Use of the term, an inversion of [[woodpecker]], dates to the early 19th century. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' traces the earliest printed use to an [[Alabama]] newspaper in 1835.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; ''Peckerwood'' was in use in reference to white people by 1859; it often suggested a white person who was rustic or poor.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Etym-Online"/&gt; The shortened form ''peck'' was in use in the same sense in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|peck, n.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In African-American folklore during the 1920s, the woodpecker symbolically represented white people, in contrast to the [[New World blackbird|blackbird]] that represented [[African-Americans]].&lt;ref name= "Etym-Online"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADL" /&gt;

Historically, the term "peckerwood" was commonly applied to white prisoners in general.&lt;ref name="ADL" /&gt; The cemetery at [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|Leavenworth Penitentiary]], officially known as Mount Hope, is informally known as "Peckerwood Hill" by prisoners and guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Early|first1=Pete|title=The Hot House|date=November 9, 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=9780307808318|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kle8Cs5pMWIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22aryan%20brotherhood%22&amp;pg=PT45#v=snippet&amp;q=peckerwood&amp;f=false|chapter=Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later half of the 20th century the term narrowed to apply to a white [[subculture]] associated with street gangs and prison gangs, such as the [[Aryan Brotherhood]]. This subculture is also known as PW, P-Dub, or collectively as "the Woodpile".&lt;ref name="ADL" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waywordradio.org/peckerwood_1/ |title=Double-Tongued Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men in this group are called "peckerwoods" and women "featherwoods". The [[woodpecker]] is often used as a general symbol for the group, such as in [[Prison tattooing|prison tattoos]].&lt;ref name="ADL" /&gt; It is usually drawn with a long beak, sometimes drawn to resemble [[Woody Woodpecker]] or [[Mr. Horsepower]].&lt;ref name="AntiSem"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antisemitism.org.il/eng/Peckerwood |title=Peckerwood |publisher=The Coordination Forum for Countering Antisemitism (CFAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Becoming a higher-ranking member involves the act of committing more and more serious crimes.&lt;ref name="Hate CrimesPrison"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/27726/hate_crimes_in_prison |title=Hate Crimes in Prison |publisher=Alternet |author=David Holthouse |date=November 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=madera&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maderatribune.com/news/gang-%E2%80%98lifelong-commitment%E2%80%99 |title=Gang a 'lifelong commitment' |work=The Madera Tribune |author=Glenna Jarvis |date=July 16, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007222124/http://www.maderatribune.com/news/gang-%E2%80%98lifelong-commitment%E2%80%99 |archivedate=October 7, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peckerwood is also used by some prison systems as a generic name for any white supremacist threat group, which has sometimes been a source of confusion.&lt;ref name="joomag" /&gt; In and out of prison, the peckerwood subculture is most common in [[California]], [[Texas]] and the U.S. [[Southern United States|south]] and [[Southwestern United States|southwest]], but less in the [[Midwestern United States|midwest]] and [[Northeast United States|northeast]].&lt;ref name="ADL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="joomag" /&gt;

Much of the peckerwood prison subculture had its beginnings in the desegregation of United States prisons. Aryan Brotherhood had its beginnings in the [[San Quentin State Prison]] in 1964 as a response to the newly formed black prison gang [[Black Guerilla Family]].&lt;ref name="joomag" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;Coverson, Laura.

ABT originally formed as a hybrid of the two gangs Aryan Society and Aryan Brothers. In 1985, the [[Aryan Circle]] formed out of peckerwoods who didn't join the newly formed Aryan Brotherhood of Texas. Aryan Circle members believed ABT didn't truly stand for white supremacy. Fronted by Mark "Cowboy" Gaspard, the group was originally called Aryan Christians but changed its name due to members' varying beliefs.&lt;ref name="AryanCircle"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE ARYAN CIRCLE: Crime in the Name of Hate|url=http://www.adl.org/assets/pdf/combating-hate/Aryan-Circle-Report.pdf|website=ADL|publisher=ADL|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/domestic-extremism-terrorism/c/aryan-brotherhood-texas-report.html#.V0qRa5MrL_Q|title=The Aryan Brotherhood of Texas|publisher=ADL|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group known as the "International Peckerwood Syndicate" has been listed by in the [[Oregon Department of Justice]] as operating in Oregon prisons.

The peckerwood subculture has established street gangs that mix elements from [[white power skinhead]] culture and conventional street gang activity, such as illegal drugs. These "Peckerwood" street gangs generally form in lower-income white neighborhoods. These gangs are the manifestation of a modern "white power" subculture that combines the elements of California Latino culture, [[extreme sports]] and [[cannabis]] subculture.&lt;ref name="ADL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="currentstate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/m/state-of-white-supremacy-in-the-united-states/#TheFourteenWords |title=The State of White Supremacy in the United States |date=July 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stylistically these gangs combine elements of Latino gang culture (Pendleton flannel and baggy pants) and skinhead culture ([[Doc Marten]] boots, [[bomber jacket]]s, and shaved heads).&lt;ref name="Lexicon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gangenforcement.com/uploads/2/9/4/1/29411337/lexicon_of_hate_-_5th_edition.pdf |title=The New Lexicon of HATE |publisher=Simon Wiesenthal Center |date=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, Peckerwood gang members identify with the color white and are known for wearing white caps and handkerchiefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.visalia.ca.us/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?blobid=4474 |title=Street Gangs in Tulare County |publisher=Tulare County Office of Education |author=Mel J. Borbolla }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common [[gang signal|gang sign]] for Peckerwoods is forming the thumb, index finger and middle finger of the right hand to form the letter "P," and the four fingers of the left to form the letter "W".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/peckerwood-hand-sign.html#.V1ZWmZMrJZ0 |title=Peckerwood (hand sign) |publisher=ADL }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these Peckerwood gangs in California are subservient to the authority of Nazi Lowriders, which includes the punk gangs [[Punk rock in California#1980–1986|Vicious Circle]] and [[La Mirada Punks]], as well as Insane White Boys, Independent Skins, Orange County Skins, and a rigid alliance with Southern California Skinhead Alliance (SoCal Skins).&lt;ref name="NLRpage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adl.org/issue_combating_hate/nazi_low_riders2.html#.V0tnrZMrKu4 |title=Nazi Low Riders: A Prison Gang Emerges in California |date=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading the alliance with Nazi Lowriders, the Peckerwood gang [[Public Enemy No. 1 (street gang)|Public Enemy No. 1]] (PEN1) was established in [[Long Beach, California]] during the late 80's, and known for recruiting middle-class "[[latchkey kids]]" within the Southern California [[Punk rock in California|punk]] scene. PEN1 also known by its derivative Peni Death Squad, gained establishment as a Peckerwood gang in the late 90s in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], being recruited by the Nazi Lowriders. Members of PEN1 also established a regional chapter of the [[straight edge]] street gang [[Friends Stand United|FSU]] (Fuck Shit Ups) in [[Huntington Beach]] as well.&lt;ref name="Lexicon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NLRpage" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PENI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20070304/news_1n4gang.html |title=Public Enemy No. 1 more brazen since teaming with Aryan Brotherhood |publisher=[[San Diego Union Tribune]] |date=March 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305204429/http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20070304/news_1n4gang.html |archivedate=March 5, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AdlCal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.adl.org/racist_skinheads/states/california.html |title=Racist Skinhead Project: California |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |date=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the gang Insane White Boys (IWB) was incepted in Orange County and came into prominence being recruited by the Nazi Lowriders as well.&lt;ref name="Lexicon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AdlCal" /&gt; The smaller gangs such as Public Enemy No. 1 and Insane White Boys are considered "kids" within the Peckerwood gang world, where as Nazi Lowrider groups are led by "seniors" who induct "kids" into membership. A kid can become a "junior", and a junior can become a senior if elected by three other seniors.&lt;ref name="NLRpage" /&gt;  Within the U.S. court system, membership within a Peckerwood group has not always been accepted as indicating the existence of a larger Peckerwood gang. Peckerwood groups tend to lack a constitution, and to be more loosely organized than formal gangs. The Smalltown Peckerwoods, a gang of about a hundred members on the U.S. West Coast, was not ruled to be part of a larger Peckerwood organization in the 2008 ''People v. Williams'' case, as the main commonalities were ideology and the name, rather than organizational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ofgang|first1=Kenneth|title=C.A.

On May 4, 2013, Charles Gaskin, who was a member of the gang according to his probation report, was sentenced for 26 years to life for the murder of registered sex offender Neil Lee Hayes. According to the report, Gaskin was required to physically harm a white person with a history of child molestation under "peckerwood law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White Supremacist Gets 26 Years For Killing Child Molester|url=http://www.hngn.com/articles/2553/20130504/white-supremacist-gets-26-years-killing-child-molester.htm|accessdate=2013-05-04|work=Headlines &amp; Global News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Morality and religious beliefs */ No, this is the more neutral wording. The fundamentalist Christians who say those kind of things also believe that Christians who don't believe those kind of things aren't "real" Christians (hence they're believing Christianity to be a minority religion in the US, etc.) and tend to use the word "Christian" as though it included only them; Wikipedia should not (accidentally, through clumsy wording) be attacking non-fundamentalist Christians in this way.</comment>

==Concept==
{{See also|Gameplay of Pokémon}}
[[File:The Story of Satoshi Tajiri.webm|thumb|An animated history of how Satoshi Tajiri came to conceive ''Pokémon''.]]

''Pokémon'' executive director [[Satoshi Tajiri]] first thought of ''Pokémon'', albeit with a different concept and name, around 1989, when the [[Game Boy]] was released. The concept of the [[Pokémon universe]], in both the video games and the general fictional world of ''Pokémon'', stems from the hobby of [[insect collecting]], a popular pastime which Tajiri enjoyed as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2040095,00.html|title=The Ultimate Game Freak|work=Time|date=November 22, 1999|accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players are designated as [[Pokémon Trainer]]s and have three general goals: to complete the regional [[Pokédex]] by collecting all of the available Pokémon species found in the fictional region where a game takes place, to complete the national Pokédex by transferring Pokémon from other regions, and to train a team of powerful Pokémon from those they have caught to compete against teams owned by other Trainers so they may eventually win the Pokémon League and become the regional Champion. These themes of collecting, training, and battling are present in almost every version of the Pokémon franchise, including the [[Pokémon (video game series)|video games]], the [[Pokémon (anime)|anime]] and manga series, and the [[Pokémon Trading Card Game]].

In most incarnations of the Pokémon universe, a Trainer who encounters a wild Pokémon is able to capture that Pokémon by throwing a specially designed, mass-producible spherical tool called a [[Poké Ball]] at it. If the Pokémon is unable to escape the confines of the Poké Ball, it is considered to be under the ownership of that Trainer. Afterwards, it will obey whatever commands it receives from its new Trainer, unless the Trainer demonstrates such a lack of experience that the Pokémon would rather act on its own accord. Trainers can send out any of their Pokémon to wage non-lethal battles against other Pokémon; if the opposing Pokémon is wild, the Trainer can capture that Pokémon with a Poké Ball, increasing their collection of creatures. In ''Pokémon Go'', and in ''Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'', wild Pokémon encountered by players can be caught in Poké Balls, but generally cannot be battled. Pokémon already owned by other Trainers cannot be captured, except under special circumstances in certain side games. If a Pokémon fully defeats an opponent in battle so that the opponent is knocked out ("faints"), the winning Pokémon gains [[experience point]]s and may [[Levels up|level up]]. Beginning with [[Pokémon X and Y|''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'']], experience points are also gained from catching Pokémon in Poké Balls. When leveling up, the Pokémon's battling aptitude statistics ("[[Pokémon statistics|stats]], such as Attack and Speed") increase. At certain levels, the Pokémon may also learn new [[Pokémon moves|moves]], which are techniques used in battle. In addition, many species of Pokémon can undergo a form of [[metamorphosis]] and transform into a similar but stronger species of Pokémon, a process called [[Pokémon evolution|evolution]].

In the main series, each game's single-player mode requires the Trainer to raise a team of Pokémon to defeat many [[non-player character]] (NPC) Trainers and their Pokémon. Each game lays out a somewhat linear path through a specific region of the ''Pokémon'' world for the Trainer to journey through, completing events and battling opponents along the way (including foiling the plans of an 'evil' team of Pokémon Trainers who serve as antagonists to the player). Excluding [[Pokémon Sun and Moon|''Pokémon Sun'' and ''Moon'']] and [[Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|''Pokémon Ultra Sun'' and ''Ultra Moon'']], the games feature eight powerful Trainers, referred to as [[Gym Leader]]s, that the Trainer must defeat in order to progress. As a reward, the Trainer receives a Gym Badge, and once all eight badges are collected, the Trainer is eligible to challenge the region's Pokémon League, where four talented trainers (referred to collectively as the "[[Elite Four]]") challenge the Trainer to four Pokémon battles in succession. If the trainer can overcome this gauntlet, they must challenge the Regional Champion, the master Trainer who had previously defeated the Elite Four. Any Trainer who wins this last battle becomes the new champion.

===Morality and religious beliefs===
''Pokémon'' has been criticized by some fundamentalist Christians over perceived [[occult]] and [[violence|violent]] themes and the concept of "Pokémon evolution", which they feel goes against the Biblical creation account in Genesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokémon: The Movie (1999)|url=http://www.capalert.com/capreports/pokemonthemovie.htm|publisher=ChildCare Action Project|accessdate=August 10, 2013|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sat2000]], a satellite television station based in [[Vatican City]], has countered that the Pokémon Trading Card Game and video games are "full of inventive imagination" and have no "harmful moral side effects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.|title=Pokemon Gets Religion|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,620818,00.html|publisher=[[People (American magazine)|People]]|accessdate=August 10, 2013|date=December 9, 1997|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67nazpLEQ?url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,620818,00.html|archivedate=May 20, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrett|first=Devlin|title=POKEMON EARNS PAPAL BLESSING|url=http://www.nypostonline.com/news/2630.htm|work=New York Post|accessdate=August 10, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818054740/http://www.nypostonline.com/news/2630.htm|archivedate=August 18, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the "Christian Power Cards" game was introduced in 1999 by David Tate who stated, "Some people aren't happy with Pokémon and want an alternative, others just want Christian games." The game was similar to the Pokémon Trading Card Game but used Biblical figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pokémon trumped by pocket saints|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/808361.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=August 10, 2013|date=June 27, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Nintendo stopped manufacturing the Japanese version of the "Koga's Ninja Trick" trading card because it depicted a [[swastika#Other Asian traditions|manji]], a traditionally [[Buddhist]] symbol with no negative connotations. The [[Jewish]] civil rights group [[Anti-Defamation League]] complained because the symbol is the reverse of a [[swastika]], a [[Nazism|Nazi]] symbol. The cards were intended for sale in Japan only, but the popularity of ''Pokémon'' led to import into the United States with approval from Nintendo. The Anti-Defamation League understood that the issue symbol was not intended to offend and acknowledged the sensitivity that Nintendo showed by removing the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4525479.html |title='Swastika' Pokemon card dropped |last=Fitzgerald|first=Jim|date=December 3, 1999|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|via=[[HighBeam]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, two nine-year-old boys from [[Merrick, New York|Merrick]], New York sued Nintendo because they claimed the Pokémon Trading Card Game caused their [[problem gambling|problematic gambling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kieran|last=Crowley|url=http://www.nypost.com/news/14579.htm |title=Lawsuit Slams Pokemon As Bad Bet for Addicted Kids|publisher=[[New York Post]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001022030204/http://www.nypost.com/news/14579.htm |archivedate=October 22, 2000|date=October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Saudi Arabia]] banned ''Pokémon'' games and the trading cards, alleging that the franchise promoted [[Zionism]] by displaying the [[Star of David]] in the trading cards (a six-pointed star is featured in the card game) as well as other religious symbols such as [[cross]]es they associated with Christianity and triangles they associated with [[Freemasonry]]; the games also involved gambling, which is in violation of [[Muslim]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/meast/03/26/saudi.pokemon/ |title=Saudi bans Pokemon |date=March 26, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118135529/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/meast/03/26/saudi.pokemon |archivedate=January 18, 2008 | publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1243307.stm|title=Saudi Arabia bans Pokemon|date=March 26, 2001|work=BBC News|accessdate=February 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal cruelty===
In 2012, [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] criticized the concept of ''Pokémon'' as supporting [[cruelty to animals]]. PETA compared the game's concept, of capturing animals and forcing them to fight, to [[cockfight]]s, [[dog fighting]] rings and circuses, events frequently criticized for cruelty to animals. PETA released a game spoofing ''Pokémon'' where the Pokémon battle their trainers to win their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/peta-wages-war-on-pokemon-for-virtual-animal-cruelty/|title=PETA wages war on Pokemon for virtual animal cruelty|website=[[CNET]]|date=October 8, 2012|access-date=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; PETA reaffirmed their objections in 2016 with the release of ''Pokémon Go'', promoting the hashtag #GottaFreeThemAll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2016-07-24/pokemon-go-criticised-peta-animal-cruelty-gottafreeemall/|title=#GottaFreeEmAll: Pokémon Go criticised by PETA for 'animal cruelty' parallels|access-date=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2000, Morrison Entertainment Group, a toy developer based at [[Manhattan Beach, California]], sued Nintendo over claims that ''Pokémon'' infringed on its own ''[[Monster in My Pocket]]'' characters.

Professor of Education [[Joseph Tobin]] theorizes that the success of the franchise was due to the long list of names that could be learned by children and repeated in their peer groups. Its rich fictional universe provides opportunities for discussion and demonstration of knowledge in front of their peers. For the French versions of ''Pokémon'' media, Nintendo took care to translate the name of the creatures so that they reflected French culture and language. The names of the creatures were linked to its characteristics, which converged with the children's belief that names have symbolic power. Children can pick their favourite Pokémon and affirm their individuality while at the same time affirming their conformance to the values of the group, and they can distinguish themselves from others by asserting what they liked and what they did not like from every chapter. ''Pokémon'' gained popularity because it provides a sense of identity to a wide variety of children, and lost it quickly when many of those children found that the identity groups were too big and searched for identities that would distinguish them into smaller groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pikachu's global adventure: the rise and fall of Pokémon |author=Joseph Jay Tobin |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=0-8223-3287-6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=U7hthImoc5AC&amp;q=naming#v=snippet&amp;q=naming&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pokémon''{{'}}s history has been marked at times by rivalry with the ''[[Digimon]]'' media franchise that debuted at a similar time. Described as "the other 'mon'" by [[IGN]]'s Juan Castro, ''Digimon'' has not enjoyed ''Pokémon''{{'}}s level of international popularity or success, but has maintained a dedicated fanbase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=E3 2005: Digimon World 4 |url=http://xbox.ign.com/articles/617/617917p1.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67ncKfZXX?url=http://xbox.ign.com/articles/617/617917p1.html |archivedate=May 20, 2012 |last=Castro |first=Juan |publisher=IGN |date=May 20, 2005 |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN's Lucas M.

While ''Pokémon''{{'}}s target demographic is children, early purchasers of ''Pokémon Omega Ruby'' and ''Alpha Sapphire'' were in their 20s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/12/01/pokemons-audience-growing-older/|title=Pokémon's Audience Is Growing Older|website=Siliconera|date=December 1, 2014|accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many fans are adults who originally played the games as children and later returned to the series.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

A significant community around the ''Pokémon'' video games' metagame has existed for a long time, analyzing the best ways to use each Pokémon to their full potential in competitive battles. The most prolific competitive community is Smogon University, which has created a widely accepted tier-based battle system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/02/20/competitive-pokemon/|title=Inside the Secret World of Competitive Pokémon|last=Magdaleno|first=Alex|date=February 20, 2014|work=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Smogon is affiliated with an online ''Pokémon'' game called ''Pokémon Showdown'', in which players create a team and battle against other players around the world using the competitive tiers created by Smogon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/the-most-popular-pokemon-used-by-top-players-in-one-im-1683821224|title=The Most Popular Pokémon Used By Top Players, In One Image|access-date=November 15, 2016|website=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Univision Communications]]|date=May 2, 2015|first=Patricia|last=Hernandez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A challenge called the Nuzlocke Challenge was created in order for older players of the series to enjoy ''Pokémon'' again—but with a twist. The player is only allowed to capture the first Pokémon encountered in each area. If they do not succeed in capturing that Pokémon, there are no second chances. When a Pokémon faints, it is considered "dead" and must be released or stored in the PC permanently.&lt;ref name="Nuzlocke1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuzlocke.com/challenge.php|access-date=May 28, 2015|website=Nuzlocke.com|date=2010|title=What is the Nuzlocke Challenge?}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the player faints, the game is considered over, and the player must restart.&lt;ref name="Nuzlocke2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idigitaltimes.com/pok%C3%A9mon-nuzlocke-challenge-20-years-playing-pok%C3%A9mon-and-most-stressful-experience-440270|date=May 14, 2015|access-date=May 28, 2015|first1=Phillip|last1=Martinez|title=Pokémon Nuzlocke Challenge: 20 Years Of Playing Pokémon And This Is The Most Stressful Experience Ever|publisher=[[iDigitalTimes]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528114800/http://www.idigitaltimes.com/pok%C3%A9mon-nuzlocke-challenge-20-years-playing-pok%C3%A9mon-and-most-stressful-experience-440270|archivedate=May 28, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original idea consisted of 2 to 3 rules that the community has built upon.

[[File:Poush Mela Bazaar 2012.jpg|thumb|220px|Poush Mela Bazaar, 2012.]]
'''Poush Mela''' ({{lang-bn|পৌষ মেলা}}) is an annual fair and festival that takes place in [[Santiniketan]], in [[Birbhum District]] in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[West Bengal]], marking the harvest season. Commencing on the 7th day of the month of [[Poush]], the fair officially lasts for three days, although vendors may stay until the month-end. From 2017, Mela will last for six days. The key characteristic of this fair include live performances of Bengali folk music, notably [[baul]] music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wbtourism.com/fairs_festivals/festival_bengal.htm | title = Poush Mela| accessdate = 2009-02-14 | work =  | publisher =West Bengal Tourism}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Culture of Bengal}}

==Background==
[[Devendranath Tagore]] with twenty followers accepted the [[Brahmo Samaj|Brahmo]] creed from [[Ram Chandra Vidyabagish]] on 21 December 1843 (7 Poush 1250 according to the Bengali calendar). This was the basis of ''Poush Utsav'' (the Festival of Poush) at Santiniketan&lt;ref name=Basak&gt;Basak, Tapan Kumar, ''Rabindranath-Santiniketan-Sriniketan (An Introduction)'', p. 36, B.B.Publication&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Brahma mandir'' was established at Santiniketan on 21 December 1891 (7 Poush 1298 according to the Bengali calendar). A small fair was organised in 1894 in connection with the establishment anniversary of the ''Brahma mandir'', in the ground opposite the mandir. What started as a small homely Poush Mela now attracts attention of not only the people of [[Birbhum district]] but tourists from all around.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Swapan Kumar, ''Santiniketan-Visva Bharati &amp;ndash; Birbhumer Srestha Tirtha'',''Paschim Banga'', February 2006, (in Bengali), Birbhum special issue, p. 250, Information and Culture department, Govt. of West Bengal&lt;/ref&gt;

In earlier days the ''mela'' (fair) was held in the ground on the north side of ''Brahma mandir'' (also referred to as glass temple). On that day, a firework display was held in earlier days after evening prayers. As the mela increased in size, it was shifted to the field in Purbapalli.

==Inauguration==
Poush Utsav is inaugurated on 7 Poush (around 23 December). At dawn, Santiniketan wakes up to the soft music of [[shehnai]]. The first to enter the scenario is the Vaitalik group, who go round the ashrama (hermitage) singing songs. It is followed by a prayer-meeting at Chhatimtala. Then the entire congregation moves on to Uttarayan singing songs.&lt;ref name=Basak/&gt;

==Other days==
Poush Mela is characterized by the live performances of Bengali folk music, especially the baul music. It includes folk songs, dances and tribal sports. This fair offers a perfect insight of true heritage of the state. The students of Santiniketan present their magnificent performance and make this festival more enjoyable and glamorous. Each day of this festival is filled with different activities. The last day of this fair is devoted to those who are related to Santiniketan.

==The fair==
[[File:Poush_Mela_Bazaar.JPG|thumb|250px|Shoppers at the Poush Mela Fair]]
Some 1,500 stalls take part in the fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/poush-mela-to-start-from-dec-23/253169/| title = Poush Mela to start from Dec 23| accessdate = 2009-02-14 | work =  | publisher =Financial Express, 22 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of tourists pouring in for the three-day fair is around 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://indiantourism.wordpress.com/2007/12/24/poush-mela-in-shantiniketan/ | title = Poush Mela in Santiniketan| accessdate = 2009-02-14 | work =  | publisher =Indian Tourism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government statistics put the daily inflow of tourists in to Santiniketan at around 3,500 per day; but during major festival such as Pous Utsav, Basanta Utsav, Rabindra  Paksha,  and Naba Barsha it goes up to an average 40,000 per day or more. Obviously, many of them do stay back in Santiniketan, which has 85 lodges with accommodation for 1,650. Beside of this, room on rent can be hired for some days.&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{cite web | url= http://birbhum.gov.in/birtour4.htm | title = Santiniketan-Bolpur | accessdate = 2009-03-05 | last =  | first =  | work = | publisher =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local printed fabrics and handicrafts are available in the stalls erected during the fair.

'''Project Rastko — Internet Library of Serb Culture''' ({{lang-sr|Пројекат Растко — Електронска библиотека српске културе, Projekat Rastko — Elektronska biblioteka srpske kulture}}) is a non-profit and non-governmental publishing, cultural and educational project dedicated to [[Serbs|Serb]] and Serb-related [[art]]s and [[humanities]]. It is named after [[Rastko Nemanjić]].

==Project==
The project was established in 1997 as a part of a pan-regional Balkans Cultural Network Initiative {{Fact|date=November 2007}}. Its main activities are:
* [[electronic publishing]] in the fields of [[Serbia]]n and Serbian-related arts and humanities
* scientific and cultural conferences and studies about [[Balkan]] cultural-civilizational integration {{Fact|date=November 2007}}
* bilateral and multilateral activities with other Balkan and world countries
* establishing regional centres
* technical training

The apex of the project is its [[digital library|electronic library]] with more than half a [[gigabyte]] of material, comprising [[e-book|electronic books]] and [[essay |articles]], [[photograph]]s and [[comic strip| comic]]s. Though most texts are in [[Serbian language]] there is a body of material in other languages, again mostly in [[English language|English]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], but also in [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language |Spanish]] and other languages. 

The library contains material in both the [[public domain]] and [[copyright]]ed texts published with the authors' permissions{{Fact|date=November 2007}}, dating from earliest [[medieval]] Serb texts to contemporary [[science fiction]]. The site of the project also hosts several sites not directly related to the project.

Project Rastko also hosts the European version of [[Distributed Proofreaders]], which intends to supply [[Project Gutenberg]] with public domain texts in European languages. Project Rastko is organising a coalition of European e-libraries for the purpose of collecting public domain works, aiming to eventually have a node of Distributed Proofreaders in each European country.

[[File:Resurrectionists by phiz.png|thumb|upright|250px|''Resurrectionists'' (1847), by [[Hablot Knight Browne]].  This illustration accompanies an account of John Holmes and Peter Williams who, for unearthing cadavers in 1777, were publicly whipped from [[Holborn]] to [[St Giles, London|St Giles]].]]
'''Resurrectionists''' were commonly employed by [[anatomy|anatomists]] in the United Kingdom during the 18th and 19th centuries to [[Exhumation|exhume]] the bodies of the recently dead.  Between 1506 and 1752 only a very few [[cadaver]]s were available each year for anatomical research.  The supply was increased when, in an attempt to intensify the deterrent effect of the [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|death penalty]], [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] passed the {{nowrap|[[Murder Act 1752]].}}  By allowing judges to substitute the [[gibbeting|public display]] of executed criminals with [[dissection]] (a fate generally viewed with horror), the new law significantly increased the number of bodies anatomists could legally access.  This proved insufficient to meet the needs of the [[hospital]]s and teaching centres that opened during the 18th century.  Corpses and their component parts became a commodity, but although the practice of disinterment was hated by the general public, bodies were not legally anyone's property.  The resurrectionists therefore operated in a legal [[loophole|grey area]].

Nevertheless, resurrectionists caught plying their trade ran the risk of physical attack.  Measures taken to stop them included the use of increased security at graveyards.  Night watches patrolled grave sites, the rich placed their dead in secure [[coffin]]s, and physical barriers such as [[mortsafe]]s and heavy stone slabs made extraction of corpses more difficult.  [[Body snatcher]]s were not the only people to come under attack; in the public's view, the 1752 Act made anatomists agents of the law, enforcers of the [[death penalty]].  Riots at execution sites, from where anatomists collected legal corpses, were commonplace.

Matters came to a head following the [[Burke and Hare murders]] of 1828.  Parliament responded by setting up the 1828 [[Select Committee]] on anatomy, whose report emphasised the importance of anatomical science and recommended that the bodies of paupers be given over for dissection.  In response to the discovery in 1831 of a gang known as the [[London Burkers]], who apparently modelled their activities on those of Burke and Hare, Parliament debated a [[Bill (law)|bill]] submitted by [[Henry Warburton]], author of the Select Committee's report.  Although it did not make body snatching illegal, the [[Anatomy Act 1832|resulting Act of Parliament]] effectively put an end to the work of the resurrectionists by allowing anatomists access to the [[workhouse]] dead.

==Legal background==
[[File:Henry VIII and the Barber Surgeons, by Hans Holbein the Younger, Richard Greenbury, and others.jpg|right|thumb|''Henry VIII and the Barber Surgeons'' (1543), by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]].  Anatomical research on human [[cadaver]]s was legalised in England in 1540.]]
Human cadavers have been dissected by physicians since at least the 3rd century BC, but throughout history, prevailing religious views on the desecration of corpses often meant that such work was performed in secrecy.{{sfnp|Grauer|2011|p=18|ps=}}  The Christian church forbade human dissection until the 14th century, when the first recorded anatomisation of a cadaver took place in [[Bologna]].  Until then, anatomical research was limited to the dissection of animals.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{Citation | last = Frank | first = Julia Bess | title = Body Snatching: A Grave Medical Problem | journal = The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine | volume = 49 | pages = 399–410 | date = 3 March 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Britain, human dissection was proscribed by law until 1506, when King [[James IV of Scotland]] gave royal [[patronage]] to the [[Barber-Surgeons of Edinburgh]], allowing them to dissect the "bodies of certain executed criminals".  England followed in 1540, when [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] gave patronage to the [[Company of Barber-Surgeons]], allowing them access to four executed felons each year ([[Charles II of England|Charles II]] later increased this to six felons each year).{{sfnp|Cheung|2007|p=36|ps=}}&lt;ref name="Richardsonp32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Richardson|1987|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|McNally|2011|pp=51–52|ps=}}  [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] granted the [[Royal College of Physicians|College of Physicians]] the right to anatomise four felons annually in 1564.&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt;

Several major hospitals and teaching centres were established in Britain during the 18th century, but with only a very few corpses legally available for dissection, these institutions suffered from severe shortages.  Some local authorities had already attempted to alleviate the problem, with limited success; in 1694, Edinburgh allowed anatomists to dissect corpses "found dead in the streets, and the bodies of such as die violent deaths&amp;nbsp;... who shall have nobody to own them".&lt;ref name="Cheungp37"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cheung|2007|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Suicide victims were given over, as were infants who had died while being born and also the unclaimed bodies of abandoned children.&lt;!-- this section is closely worded to the source, struggled for ages to reword but its very difficult --&gt;  But even though they were supported by the [[common law]], anatomists occasionally found it difficult to collect what was granted to them. Fuelled by resentment of how readily the [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|death penalty]] was used, and imbued with superstitious beliefs, crowds sometimes sought to keep the bodies of executed felons away from the authorities.  Riots at execution sites were commonplace; worried about possible disorder, in 1749 the [[Sheriffs of the City of London|Sheriff of London]] ignored the surgeons and gave the dead to their relatives.&lt;ref name="Cheungp37"/&gt;{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|p=53|ps=}}

These problems, together with a desire to enhance the deterrent effect of the death penalty, resulted in the passage of the [[Murder Act 1751|Murder Act 1752]].&lt;ref name="Cheungp37"/&gt;  It required that "every murderer shall, after execution, either be dissected or hung in chains".{{sfnp|Woods|2002|p=122|ps=}}  Dissection was generally viewed as "a fate worse than death";{{sfnp|Cheung|2007|p=38|ps=}} giving judges the ability to substitute [[gibbeting]] with dissection was an attempt to invoke that horror.&lt;ref name="McNallyp53"&gt;{{Harvnb|McNally|2011|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Act gave anatomists [[Statutory law|statutory]] access to many more cadavers than were previously available, it proved insufficient.  Attempting to bolster the supply, some surgeons offered money to pay the prison expenses and funeral clothing costs of condemned prisoners, while bribes were paid to officials present at the gallows, sometimes leading to an unfortunate situation in which corpses not legally given over for dissection were taken anyway.{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|pp=52–53|ps=}}

==Commodification==
Documented cases of grave robbery for medical purposes can be found as far back as 1319.  The 15th-century [[polymath]] [[Leonardo da Vinci]] may have secretly dissected around 30&amp;nbsp;corpses, although their provenance remains unknown.{{sfnp|Gordon|2009|pp=8–9|ps=}}{{efn|During the 16th and 17th centuries Italy became a European leader in the study of [[anatomy]], with English anatomists travelling there to study.  For instance, [[William Harvey]], the first physician to demonstrate the human body's circulatory system, studied at the [[University of Padua]].{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|pp=31–32|ps=}}}}  In Britain, the practice appears to have been common early in the 17th century.  For example, [[William Shakespeare]]'s epitaph reads "Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear, To dig the dust enclosed here.  Blessed be the man that spares these stones, And cursed be he that moves my bones"{{efn|Good frend for Iesvs sake forbeare, To digg the dvst encloased heare. Bleste be ye man yt spares thes stones, And cvrst be he yt moves my bones"}} and in 1678, anatomists were suspected of being involved in the disappearance of an executed gypsy's body.  Contracts issued in 1721 by the Edinburgh College of Surgeons include a clause directing students not to become involved in exhumation, suggesting, according to historian Ruth Richardson, that students had already done the exact opposite.{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|p=54|ps=}}  Pupils accompanied professional [[body snatching|body snatchers]] as observers, and were reported to have obtained and paid for their studies with human corpses, perhaps indicating that their tutors were complicit.  The unauthorised removal of bodies from London graveyards became commonplace and by the 1720s, probably as a direct result of the lack of legally available bodies for anatomical research, fresh corpses had likely undergone [[commodification]].&lt;ref name="Richardsonpp5455"&gt;{{Harvnb|Richardson|1987|pp=52,&amp;nbsp;54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corpses and parts thereof were traded like any other merchandise: packed into suitable containers, salted and preserved, stored in cellars and [[wharf|quays]] and transported in carts, [[waggon]]s and boats.{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|pp=71–72|ps=}}  Encouraged by fierce competition, anatomy schools usually paid more promptly than their peers, who included individual surgeons, artists and others with an interest in human anatomy.  As one body snatcher testified, "a man may make a good living at it, if he is a sober man, and acts with judgement, and supplies the schools".{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|p=58|ps=}}
[[File:Rowlandson - Resurrection Men.png|left|upright|thumb|''Resurrection Men'', by [[Thomas Rowlandson]].  Watched by a skeleton, two body snatchers place an exhumed corpse into a sack.]]

In London, late 18th-century anatomists may have delegated their grave-robbing almost entirely to body snatchers, or, as they were commonly known, resurrectionists. A fifteen-strong gang of such men, exposed in Lambeth in 1795, supplied "eight surgeons of public repute, and a man who calls himself an Articulator".{{efn|"To restore order, and discover the offenders if possible, a large reward was offered, and the committee aforesaid appointed; by whose enquiries, it was found that the Grave Digger, and three other persons were the robbers, and that the bodies had been conveyed away in a coach to different people for various purposes, as was made appear to them by informations upon oath; the material parts of one of which informations being now read, showed, that within the knowledge of the informant, eight surgeons of public repute, and a man who calls himself an Articulator (and by hand-bills openly avows the trade, exclusive of others of less note) are in the constant habit of buying stolen dead bodies, during the winter half year; in whose service the following fifteen persons are generally employed, namely, Samuel Arnot, alias Harding; John Gilmore, Thomas Gilmore, Thomas Pain, Peter McIntire, alias Mc Intosh, James Profit, Jeremiah Keese, Moris Hogarty, White, a man called Long John the Coachman, John Butler, John Howison, Samuel Hatton, John Parker; and Henry Wheeler, whose depredations have extended to thirty Burial Grounds that the informant knows of; and that grave diggers, and those intrusted with the care of Burial Grounds, are frequently accessory to the robberies, and receive five shillings per Corpse for every one, that with their privily is carried off, by which means many hundreds are taken from their grave annually."&lt;ref name="thomasparish"&gt;{{Citation | title = St. Thomas's Parish Vestry Records and a Body-Snatching Incident | pmid = 18132430 | journal = British Medical Journal | date = 9 July 1949 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.2.4618.69 | volume=2 | pmc=2052208 | pages=69 | last1 = Dopson | first1 = L}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The report into their activities lists a price of two [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] and a [[Crown (British coin)|crown]] for a dead body, six [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]] for the first foot, and nine [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|pence]] per inch "for all it measures more in length".&lt;ref name="thomasparish"/&gt;  These prices were by no means fixed; the [[black market]] value of corpses varied considerably.  Giving evidence to the 1828 [[Select Committee]] on Anatomy, the surgeon [[Astley Cooper]] testified that in 1828 the price for a corpse was about eight guineas, but also that he had paid anything from two to fourteen guineas previously; others claimed they had paid up to twenty guineas per corpse.{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|p=57|ps=}}  Compared to the five shillings an [[East End of London|East End]] silk weaver could earn each week, or the single guinea a manservant to a wealthy household was paid, these were considerable sums of money and body snatching was therefore a highly profitable business.&lt;ref name="Wisep30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2004|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Surgeons at the Royal College in Edinburgh complained that resurrectionists were [[Profiteering (business)|profiteering]], particularly when local shortages forced prices up.  One surgeon told the Select Committee that he thought the body snatchers were manipulating the market for their own benefit, though no criticism was made of the "Anatomy Club", an attempt by anatomists to control the price of corpses for their benefit.{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|p=103|ps=}}

Prices also varied depending on what type of corpse was for sale.  With greater opportunity for the study of musculature, males were preferable to females,&lt;ref name="Wisep30"/&gt; while [[freak]]s were more highly valued.  The body of [[Charles Byrne (giant)|Charles Byrne]], the so-called "Irish Giant", fetched about £500 when it was bought by [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]].{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|pp=57–58|ps=}}  Byrne's skeleton remains on display at the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Royal College of Surgeons rejects call to bury skeleton of 'Irish giant' | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/dec/22/irish-giant-skeleton-museum-display | publisher = guardian.co.uk | date = 22 December 2011 | accessdate = 15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children's bodies were also traded, as "big smalls", "smalls" or foetuses.  Parts of corpses, such as a scalp with long hair attached, or good quality teeth, also fetched good prices—not because they held any intrinsic value to the anatomist, but rather because they were used to refurbish the living.{{sfnp|Wise|2004|pp=30–31|ps=}}

{{Quote box | quote = "Resurrection was one of the most covert underworld activities of the day, and tantalisingly little about it has ever come to light". | source = Sarah Wise{{sfnp|Wise|2004|p=35|ps=}} | align = right | width = 33%}}
With no reliable figures for the number of dissections that took place in 18th-century Britain, the true scale of body snatching can only be estimated.  Richardson suggests that nationally, several thousand bodies were robbed each year.{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|p=87|ps=}}  The 1828 Select Committee reported that in 1826, 592&amp;nbsp;bodies were dissected by 701&amp;nbsp;students.&lt;ref name="Richardsonpp5455"/&gt;  In 1831, only 52&amp;nbsp;of 1,601&amp;nbsp;death penalties handed down were enacted, a number far too small to meet demand.&lt;ref name="Wisep31"/&gt;  Since corpses were not viewed as property and could neither be owned nor stolen,{{efn|For more detail on the legal status of corpses, see {{Citation | last1 = Ross | first1 = Ian | last2 = Ross | first2 = Carol Urquhart | title = Body Snatching in Nineteenth Century Britain | journal = British Journal of Law and Society | issue = 1 | volume = 6 | date = Summer 1979 | publisher = Wiley | pages = 108–118 | jstor=1409709}}}} body snatching remained quasi-legal, the crime being committed against the grave rather than the body.{{sfnp|Lantos|2011|p=11|ps=}}  On the rare occasions they were caught, resurrectionists might have received a public whipping, or a sentence for crimes against public [[wikt:mores|mores]], but generally the practice was treated by the authorities as an open secret and ignored.{{sfnp|Gordon|2009|p=8|ps=}}{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|p=59|ps=}}  A notable exception occurred in [[Great Yarmouth]] in 1827, with the capture of three resurrectionists.  At a time when thieves were regularly [[Penal transportation|transported]] for theft, two of the body snatchers were discharged and the third, sent to London for trial, was imprisoned for only six months.{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|pp=83–86|ps=}}  Resurrectionists were also aided by the corpse's anatomisation; since the process also destroyed the evidence, a successful prosecution was unlikely.{{sfnp|Wise|2004|p=33|ps=}}

==Resurrection==

===Method===
[[File:The Anatomist Overtaken by the Watch.jpg|thumb|''The Anatomist Overtaken by the Watch'' (1773), by [[William Austin (caricaturist)|William Austin]].  A caricature of [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] makes his escape from two [[Watchman (law enforcement)|watchmen]].{{sfnp|Haslam|1996|p=281|ps=}}]]
Resurrectionists usually found corpses through a network of informers.  [[Sexton (office)|Sextons]], gravediggers, undertakers, local officials; each connived to take a cut of the proceeds.  Working mostly in small gangs at night with a "dark lanthorn",{{efn|A dark lanthorn or dark lantern has a sliding panel that can obscure the light swiftly without extinguishing the flame of the candle within.}} their ''[[modus operandi]]'' was to dig a hole—sometimes using a quieter, wooden spade—down to one end of the coffin.  To disguise this activity, the spoil was sometimes thrown onto a piece of canvas at the side of the grave.  A sound-deadening sack was placed over the lid, which was then lifted.  The weight of soil on the remainder of the lid snapped the wood, enabling the robbers to hoist the body out.  The corpse was then stripped of its clothing, tied up, and placed into a sack.  The entire process could be completed within 30&amp;nbsp;minutes.  Moving the corpse of a pauper was less troublesome, as their bodies were often kept in [[mass grave]]s, left open to the environment until filled—which often took weeks.&lt;ref name="Wisep31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wise|2004|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|pp=59–61|ps=}}

If caught in the act, body snatchers could find themselves at the mercy of the local population.  A violent confrontation took place in a Dublin churchyard in 1828, when a party of mourners confronted a group of resurrectionists.  The would-be body snatchers withdrew, only to return several hours later with more men.  The mourners had also added to their number, and both groups had brought firearms.  A "volley of bullets, slugs, and swan-shot from the resurrectionists" prompted a "discharge of fire-arms from the defenders".

===Gangs===
[[File:Banchory Devenick mortsafe.jpg|thumb|A mortsafe in [[Banchory-Devenick]], Scotland]]
As many as seven gangs of resurrectionists may have been at work in 1831.  The 1828 Select Committee on Anatomy believed that there were about 200&amp;nbsp;London resurrectionists, most of them working part-time.{{sfnp|Wise|2004|p=36|ps=}}  The London Borough Gang, which operated from about 1802 to 1825, at its peak consisted of at least six men, led first by a former hospital porter named Ben Crouch, and later by a man called Patrick Murphy.  Under the protection of Astley Cooper, Crouch's gang supplied some of London's biggest anatomical schools, but relations were not always amicable.  In 1816 the gang cut off supplies to the [[St Thomas' Hospital|St Thomas Hospital School]], demanding an increase of two guineas per corpse.  When the school responded by using freelancers, members of the gang burst into the dissecting rooms, threatened the students and attacked the corpses.  The police were called, but worried about adverse publicity, the school paid their attackers' bail and opened negotiations.  The gang also attempted to put rivals out of business, sometimes by desecrating a graveyard (thereby rendering it unsafe to rob graves from for weeks thereafter) and other times by reporting freelance resurrectionists to the police, recruiting them once freed from prison.&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt;  Joshua Naples, who wrote ''The Diary of a Resurrectionist'', a list of his activities from 1811–1812,{{efn|Anatomical sessions took place from October to May, and Naples' book therefore contains no entries for May, June and July 1812.{{sfnp|Bailey|1896|p=124|ps=}}}} was one such individual.  Among entries detailing the graveyards he plundered, the institutions he delivered to, how much he was paid and his drunkenness, Naples diary mentions his gang's inability to work under a full Moon, being unable to sell a body deemed "putrid", and leaving a body thought to be infected with [[smallpox]].{{sfnp|Bailey|1896|pp=139–176|ps=}}

Violent mobs were not the only problems body snatchers faced.  Naples also wrote of how he met "patrols" and how "dogs flew at us",{{sfnp|Bailey|1896|pp=139–176|ps=}} references to some of the measures taken to secure graves against his ilk.  The aristocracy and very rich placed their dead in [[triple coffin]]s, [[Burial vault (tomb)|vaults]] and private chapels, sometimes guarded by servants.  For the less wealthy, double coffins were available, buried on private land in deep graves.  More basic defences included the placing of heavy weights over the coffin, or simply filling the grave with stones rather than soil.  Such deterrents were sometimes deployed in vain; at least one London graveyard was owned by an anatomist who, it was reported, "obtained a famous supply [of cadavers]&amp;nbsp;... and he could charge pretty handsomely for burying a body there, and afterwards get from his pupils from eight to twelve guineas for taking it up again!"{{sfnp|Anon|1829|p=563|ps=}}  Ever more elaborate creations included ''The Patent Coffin'', an iron contraption with concealed springs to prevent any levering of its lid.  Corpses were sometimes secured inside their caskets by iron straps, while other designs used special screws to reinforce metal bands placed around the coffin.{{sfnp|Shultz|2005|p=44|ps=}}{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|pp=80–81|ps=}}  In Scotland, iron cages called mortsafes either encased buried coffins, or were set in a concrete foundation and covered the whole grave.{{efn|The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''{{'}}s historical definition of mortsafe is "an iron frame placed over a coffin or at the entrance to a grave as a protection against resurrectionists in Scotland."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = mort, n.1 | url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/122428?redirectedFrom=mortsafe#eid36111795 | title = Oxford English Dictionary | date = December 2002 | edition = 3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Some covered more than one coffin, while others took the form of iron lattices fixed beneath large stone slabs, buried with the coffin.{{sfnp|Shultz|2005|p=44|ps=}}{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|pp=80–81|ps=}}  They may not have been secure enough; as one 20th-century writer observed, an empty coffin found beneath a buried mortsafe in [[Aberlour]] had probably been "opened during the night succeeding the funeral, and carefully closed again, so that the disturbance of the soil had escaped notice or had been attributed to the original burial."{{sfnp|Ritchie|1921|p=224|ps=}}

===Other methods===
Occasionally, resurrectionists paid women to pose as grieving relatives, so that they might claim a body from a workhouse.  Some parishes did little to stop this practice, as it reduced their funeral expenditure.  Bodies were also taken from [[dead house]]s; Astley Cooper's servant was once forced to return three bodies, worth £34 2s, to a dead house in [[Newington (parish)|Newington parish]].  Bribes were also paid, usually to servants of recently deceased employers then lying in state, although this method carried its own risks as corpses were often placed on public display before they were buried.{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|pp=64–65|ps=}}  Some were taken from private homes; in 1831 ''The Times'' reported that "a party of resurrectionists" burst into a house in Bow Lane and took the body of an elderly woman, who was being {{" '}}waked' by her friends and neighbours".  The thieves apparently "acted with the most revolting indecency, dragging the corpse in its death clothes after them through the mud in the street".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = An Affair Took Place in the Public Street on Tuesday Night Week | url = http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=mclib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=&amp;docId=CS51404189&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 | newspaper = The Times | date = 29 December 1831 | page = 3 | accessdate = 20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bodies were even removed—with no legal authority—from prisons and naval and military hospitals.{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|p=106|ps=}}

While some surgeons eschewed human cadavers in favour of artificial facsimiles, plaster casts, wax models and animals, bodies were also taken from hospital burial grounds.{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|p=104|ps=}}  Recent excavations at the [[Royal London Hospital]] appear to support claims made almost 200&amp;nbsp;years earlier that the hospital's school was "entirely supplied by subjects, which have been their own patients".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Gone to earth—the burial grounds of the Royal London Hospital | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)60630-2/fulltext | volume = 377 | issue = 9777 | pages = 1564–1565 | date = 7 May 2011 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60630-2 | accessdate = 4 January 2013 | last1 = Boyce | first1 = Niall | journal = The Lancet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissection and anatomy==

===Public view===
[[File:Cruelty4.JPG|right|thumb|''[[The Four Stages of Cruelty|The Reward of Cruelty]]'' (1751) by [[William Hogarth]].  A criminal is dissected by surgeons.  The image contains several references to popular superstitions regarding the human corpse and its treatment by English law.{{sfnp|Paulson|1993|p=29|ps=}}]]
The moving in 1783 of London's executions, from [[Tyburn]] to [[Newgate Prison]], reduced the likelihood of public interference and strengthened the authorities' hold over felons.  However, society's view of dissection remained unequivocal; most preferred gibbeting to the laying open of a corpse.  Martin Gray, sentenced to death in 1721 for returning early from transportation, was "greatly frighted, least his Body should be cut, and torn, and mangled after Death, and had sent his Wife to his Uncle to obtain some money to prevent it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Old Bailey Online | url = http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=OA17210403&amp;div=OA17210403 | publisher = oldbaileyonline.org | work = Ordinary's Account | pages = 4–5 | date = 3 April 1721 | accessdate = 17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vincent Davis, convicted in 1725 of murdering his wife, said he would rather be "hang'd in Chains" than "anatomiz'd", and to that effect had "sent many Letters to all his former Friends and Acquaintance to form a Company, and prevent the Surgeons in their Designs upon his Body".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Old Bailey Online | url = http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?path=ordinarysAccounts%2FOA17250430.xml | publisher = oldbaileyonline.org | work = Ordinary's Account | pages = 5–6 | date = 30 April 1725 | accessdate = 17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are cases of criminals who survived the [[short drop]], but dissecting the body removed any hope of escape from death's embrace.  Anatomists were popularly thought to be interested in dissection only as enactors of the law, a relationship first established by kings James IV and Henry VIII.&lt;ref name="Richardsonp32"/&gt;  Thomas Wakley, editor of ''[[The Lancet]]'', wrote that this lowered "the character of the profession in the public mind."{{sfnp|Anon|1829|p=921|ps=}}  It was also thought that the anatomists' work made the body's owner unrecognisable in the afterlife.  Therefore, while less hated than the resurrectionists they employed, anatomists remained at risk of attack.  Relatives of a man executed in 1820 killed one anatomist and shot another in the face,{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|pp=75–76|ps=}}{{sfnp|Morris|1976|p=101|ps=}} while in 1831, following the discovery of buried human flesh and three dissected bodies, a mob burnt down an [[anatomical theatre|anatomy theatre]] in [[Aberdeen]].  The theatre's proprietor, Andrew Moir, escaped through a window, while two of his students were chased through the streets.{{sfnp|Anon 3|1832|p=479|ps=}}

Some aspects of the popular view of dissection were exemplified by the final panel of [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[The Four Stages of Cruelty]]'', a series of engravings that depict a felon's journey to the anatomical theatre.{{sfnp|Paulson|1993|pp=28–29|ps=}}  The chief surgeon ([[John Freke (surgeon)|John Freke]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haslam|1996|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; appears as a magistrate, watching over the examination of the murderer Tom Nero's body by the Company of Surgeons.  According to author Fiona Haslam, the scene reflects a popular view that surgeons were "on the whole, disreputable, insensitive to human suffering and prone to victimis[ing] people in the same way that criminals victimised their prey."{{sfnp|Haslam|1996|p=257|ps=}}  Another popular belief alluded to by Hogarth was that surgeons were so ignorant of the respect due to their subjects, that they allowed the remains to become [[offal]].  In reality, the rough treatment exacted by body snatchers on corpses continued on the premises they delivered to.  [[Joshua Brookes]] once admitted that he had kicked a corpse in a sack down a flight of stairs,{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|pp=96–97|ps=}} while [[Robert Christison]] complained of the "shocking indecency without any qualifying wit" demonstrated by a male lecturer who dissected a woman.{{sfnp|Christison|1885|p=199|ps=}}  Pranks were also common; a London student who jokingly dropped an amputated leg down a household chimney, into a housewife's stewpot, caused a riot.{{sfnp|Malchow|1996|p=114|ps=}}

===Anatomy Act 1832===
[[File:Henry Warburton.jpeg|thumb|[[Henry Warburton]] (1833), by [[George Hayter]].  Warburton authored the 1828 Select Committee on Anatomy's report and also presented two bills to Parliament, the second of which became the [[Anatomy Act 1832]].]]
In March 1828, in [[Liverpool]], three defendants charged with conspiracy and unlawfully procuring and receiving a corpse buried in [[Warrington]] were acquitted, while the remaining two were found guilty of possession.  The presiding judge's comment, that "the disinterment of bodies for dissection was an offence liable to punishment", prompted [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to establish the 1828 Select Committee on Anatomy.&lt;ref name="Richardsonpp107108"&gt;{{Harvnb|Richardson|1987|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The committee's administrative records were lost in the 1834 [[Burning of Parliament]] and only its [[minutes]] and report are extant.&lt;ref name="Richardsonpp107108"/&gt;}}  The committee took evidence from 40&amp;nbsp;witnesses: 25&amp;nbsp;members of the medical profession, 12&amp;nbsp;public servants and 3&amp;nbsp;resurrectionists, who remained anonymous.{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|pp=114–115|ps=}}  Discussed were the importance of anatomy, the supply of subjects for dissection and the relationship between anatomists and resurrectionists.  The committee concluded that dissection was essential to the study of human anatomy and recommended that anatomists be allowed to appropriate the bodies of paupers.{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|pp=120,&amp;nbsp;131|ps=}}

The first [[Bill (law)|bill]] was presented to Parliament in 1829 by [[Henry Warburton]], author of the Select Committee's report.{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|p=108|ps=}}  Following a spirited defence of the poor by peers in the [[House of Lords]], it was withdrawn,{{efn|The [[William Howley|Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Earl]]s of [[James Harris, 2nd Earl of Malmesbury|Malmesbury]] and [[Henry Lascelles, 2nd Earl of Harewood|Harewood]], and the Lord Chief Justice, [[Charles Abbott, 1st Baron Tenterden|Lord Tenterden]], argued that the poor had a right to a decent burial and questioned if people who had broken no laws should be classed alongside murderers.  An "unconquerable objection" to dissection held by many paupers was also mentioned.{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|pp=157–158|ps=}}}} but almost two years later Warburton introduced a second bill, shortly after the execution of John Bishop and Thomas Williams.{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|pp=143,&amp;nbsp;194,&amp;nbsp;197|ps=}}  The [[London Burkers]], as the two men were known, were inspired by a series of murders committed by [[Burke and Hare murders|William Burke and William Hare]], two Irishmen who sold their victims' bodies to [[Robert Knox]], a Scottish surgeon.&lt;!-- details of their crimes aren't cited here - but citing them would be like asking for a cite to prove that water is wet --&gt;  Even though Burke and Hare never robbed graves, their case lowered the public's view of resurrectionists from desecraters to potential murderers.{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|p=195|ps=}}  The resulting wave of social anxiety helped speed Warburton's bill through Parliament,{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|pp=197–198|ps=}} and despite much public opprobrium, with little Parliamentary opposition the [[Anatomy Act 1832]] became law on 1&amp;nbsp;August 1832.{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|pp=202,&amp;nbsp;215|ps=}}  It abolished that part of the 1752 Act that allowed murderers to be dissected, ending the centuries-old tradition of anatomising felons, although it neither discouraged nor prohibited body snatching, or the sale of corpses (whose legal status remained uncertain).{{efn|The Act left Burking, the crime that had helped push Warburton's bill through Parliament, still feasible.}}  Another clause allowed a person's body to be given up for "anatomical examination", provided that the person concerned had not objected.  As the poor were often barely literate and therefore unable to leave written directions in the event of their death, this meant that masters of charitable institutions such as [[workhouse]]s decided who went to the anatomist's table.  A stipulation that witnesses could intervene was also abused, as such witnesses might be fellow inmates who were powerless to object, or workhouse staff who stood to gain money through wilful ignorance.{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|pp=205–208|ps=}}

Despite the passage of the Anatomy Act, resurrection remained commonplace, the supply of unclaimed paupers' bodies at first proving inadequate to fulfil the demand.  Reports of body snatching persisted for some years; in 1838, [[Poor Law Commissioner]]s reported on two dead resurrectionists who had contracted an illness from a putrid corpse they had unearthed.{{sfnp|Wise|2004|p=276|ps=}}{{sfnp|Richardson|1987|pp=237,&amp;nbsp;245,&amp;nbsp;263|ps=}}  By 1844, the trade no longer existed.{{sfnp|Wise|2004|p=287|ps=}}

The right to education is reflected in international law in Article 26 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and Articles 13 and 14 of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;[https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html Article 26, Universal Declaration of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm#art13 Article 13, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303114220/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm |date=2012-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm#art14 Article 14, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303114220/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm |date=2012-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 26 states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit. Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace. Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.claiminghumanrights.org/udhr_article_26.html#at28|title=Article 26|website=claiminghumanrights.org|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The right to education has been reaffirmed in the 1960 UNESCO [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]], the 1981 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]],&lt;ref name="UNESCO and UNICEF"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Human Rights-Based Approach to Education for All |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=UNESCO/UNICEF |location= |isbn=|pages=7|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0015/001548/154861E.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2006 [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]],g&lt;ref&gt;Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Article 24&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights / Legal Instruments |url = http://www.achpr.org/instruments/achpr/|website = achpr.org|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [http://study-abroad-admissions.com/best-top-higher-overseas-education-consultant Europe], Article 2 of the first Protocol of 20 March 1952 to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] states that the right to education is recognized as a human right and is understood to establish an entitlement to education. According to the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], the right to education includes the right to free, compulsory primary education for all, an obligation to develop secondary education accessible to all in particular by the progressive introduction of free secondary education, as well as an obligation to develop equitable access to higher education in particular by the progressive introduction of free higher education. The right to education also includes a responsibility to provide basic education for individuals who have not completed primary education. In addition to these access to education provisions, the right to education encompasses also the obligation to eliminate discrimination at all levels of the educational system, to set minimum standards, and to improve quality. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] in Strasbourg has applied this norm for example in the [[Belgian linguistic case]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO and UNICEF"/&gt; Article 10 of the [[European Social Charter]] guarantees the right to [[vocational education]].&lt;ref&gt;European Social Charter, Article 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[Education]] is formal institutional instructions. Generally, international instruments use the term in this sense and the right to education, as protected by [[international human rights instruments]], refers primarily to education in a narrow sense. The 1960 [[UNESCO]] Convention against Discrimination in Education defines education in Article 1(2) as: "all types and levels of education, (including such) access to education, the standard and quality of education, and the conditions under which it is given."&lt;ref name="pg19"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beiter|first=Klaus Dieter|title=The Protection of the Right to Education by International Law|year=2005|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|location=The Hague|isbn=90-04-14704-7|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a wider sense [[education]] may describe "all activities by which a human group transmits to its descendants a body of knowledge and skills and a moral code which enable the group to subsist".&lt;ref name="pg19"/&gt; In this sense education refers to the transmission to a subsequent generation of those skills needed to perform tasks of daily living, and further passing on the social, cultural, spiritual and philosophical values of the particular community. The wider meaning of education has been recognised in Article 1(a) of [[UNESCO]]'s 1974 ''Recommendation concerning Education for International Understanding, Co-operation and Peace and Education relating to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Protection of the Right to Education by International Law |last=Beiter |first=Klaus Dieter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location= |isbn=9789004147041|pages=226–227 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWs2UCuG-XQC&amp;dq=%22right+to+education%22&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"the entire process of social life by means of which individuals and social groups learn to develop consciously within, and for the benefit of, the national and international communities, the whole of their personal capabilities, attitudes, aptitudes and knowledge."&lt;ref name="pg19"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[European Court of Human Rights]] has defined education in a narrow sense as "teaching or instructions... in particular to the transmission of knowledge and to intellectual development" and in a wider sense as "the whole process whereby, in any society, adults endeavour to transmit their beliefs, culture and other values to the young."&lt;ref name="pg19"/&gt;

==Assessment of fulfilment==
The fulfilment of the right to education can be assessed using the 4 As framework, which asserts that for education to be a meaningful right it must be available, accessible, acceptable and adaptable. The 4 As framework was developed by the former UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Education, [[Katarina Tomasevski]], but is not necessarily the standard used in every [[international human rights instrument]] and hence not a generic guide to how the right to education is treated under national law.&lt;ref name="4as"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.right-to-education.org/node/226 |title=Right to education – What is it? Education and the 4 As |accessdate=2009-02-21 |work= |publisher=Right to Education project |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4 As framework proposes that governments, as the prime duty-bearers, have to respect, protect and fulfil the right to education by making education available, accessible, acceptable and adaptable. The framework also places duties on other stakeholders in the education process: the child, which as the privileged subject of the right to education has the duty to comply with [[compulsory education]] requirements, the parents as the ‘first educators’, and professional educators, namely [[teacher]]s.&lt;ref name="4as"/&gt;

The 4 As have been further elaborated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.right-to-education.org/node/232 |title=Right to education – What is it? Primer on the right to education |accessdate=2009-02-21 |work= |publisher=Right to Education project |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302065906/http://www.right-to-education.org/node/232 |archivedate=2009-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Availability]] – funded by governments, education is universal, [[free education|free]] and compulsory. There should be proper infrastructure and facilities in place with adequate books and materials for students. Buildings should meet both safety and sanitation standards, such as having clean [[drinking water]]. Active recruitment, proper training and appropriate retention methods should ensure that enough qualified staff is available at each school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.right-to-education.org/node/227 |title=Right to education – What is it? Availability |accessdate=2010-09-11 |work= |publisher=Right to Education project |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Accessibility]] – all children should have equal access to school services, regardless of gender, race, religion, ethnicity or socio-economic status. Efforts should be made to ensure the inclusion of marginalized groups including children of refugees, the homeless or those with disabilities in short there should be [[universal access to education]] i.e. access to all. Children who fall into&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.right-to-education.org/page/understanding-education-right|title=Understanding education as a right|work=Right to Education Project|access-date=2017-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; poverty should be granted the access of education because it enhances the growth of their mental and social state. There should be no forms of segregation or denial of access to any students. This includes ensuring that proper laws are in place against any [[child labour]] or [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] to prevent children from obtaining primary or secondary education. Schools must be within a reasonable distance for children within the community, otherwise transportation should be provided to students, particularly those that might live in rural areas, to ensure ways to school are safe and convenient. Education should be affordable to all, with textbooks, supplies and uniforms provided to students at no additional costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.right-to-education.org/node/228 |title=Right to education – What is it? Accessibility |accessdate=2010-09-11 |work= |publisher=Right to Education project |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[acceptabilities|Acceptability]] – the quality of education provided should be free of discrimination, relevant and culturally appropriate for all students. Students should not be expected to conform to any specific religious or ideological views. Methods of teaching should be objective and unbiased and material available should reflect a wide array of ideas and beliefs. Health and safety should be emphasized within schools including the elimination of any forms of corporal punishment. Professionalism of staff and teachers should be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.right-to-education.org/node/229 |title=Right to education – What is it? Acceptability |accessdate=2010-09-11 |work= |publisher=Right to Education project |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Adaptability]] – educational programs should be flexible and able to adjust according to societal changes and the needs of the community. Observance of religious or cultural holidays should be respected by schools in order to accommodate students, along with providing adequate care to those students with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.right-to-education.org/node/230 |title=Right to education – What is it? Adaptability |accessdate=2010-09-11 |work= |publisher=Right to Education project |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of international NGOs and charities work to realise the right to education using a [[rights-based approach to development]].&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

==Historical development==
In Europe, before the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the eighteenth and nineteenth century, education was the responsibility of parents and the [[Christian Church|church]]. With the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution]] education was established also as a public function. It was thought that the state, by assuming a more active role in the sphere of education, could help to make education available and accessible to all. Education had thus far been primarily available to the upper social classes and public education was perceived as a means of realising the [[egalitarian]] ideals underlining both revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Protection of the Right to Education by International Law |last=Beiter |first=Klaus Dieter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location= |isbn=9789004147041|pages=21–22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWs2UCuG-XQC&amp;dq=%22right+to+education%22&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, neither the [[American Declaration of Independence]] (1776) nor the [[French Declaration of the Rights of Man]] (1789) protected the right to education as the liberal concepts of [[human rights]] in the nineteenth century envisaged that parents retained the primary duty for providing education to their children. It was the states obligation to ensure that parents complied with this duty, and many states enacted legislation making school attendance compulsory. Furthermore, [[child labour]] laws were enacted to limit the number of hours per day children could be employed, to ensure children would attend school. States also became involved in the legal regulation of [[curricula]] and established minimum educational standards.&lt;ref name="Beiter 2005 22"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Protection of the Right to Education by International Law |last=Beiter |first=Klaus Dieter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location= |isbn=9789004147041|pages=22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWs2UCuG-XQC&amp;dq=%22right+to+education%22&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[On Liberty]]'' [[John Stuart Mill]] wrote that an "education established and controlled by the State should only exist, if it exists at all, as one among many competing experiments, carried on for the purpose of example and stimulus to keep the others up to a certain standard of excellence." Liberal thinkers of the nineteenth century pointed to the dangers to too much state involvement in the sphere of education, but relied on state intervention to reduce the dominance of the church, and to protect the right to education of children against their own parents. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, educational rights were included in domestic bills of rights.&lt;ref name="Beiter 2005 22"/&gt; The 1849 ''[[Paulskirchenverfassung]]'', the constitution of the [[German Empire]], strongly influenced subsequent European constitutions and devoted Article 152 to 158 of its bill of rights to education. The constitution recognised education as a function of the state, independent of the church. Remarkable at the time, the constitution proclaimed the right to free education for the poor, but the constitution did not explicitly require the state to set up educational institutions. Instead the constitution protected the rights of citizens to found and operate schools and to provide [[home education]]. The constitution also provided for freedom of [[science]] and [[teaching]], and it guaranteed the right of everybody to choose a vocation and train for it.&lt;ref name="Beiter 2005 23"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Protection of the Right to Education by International Law |last=Beiter |first=Klaus Dieter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location= |isbn=9789004147041|pages=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWs2UCuG-XQC&amp;dq=%22right+to+education%22&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nineteenth century also saw the development of [[socialist]] theory, which held that the primary task of the state was to ensure the economic and social well-being of the community through government intervention and regulation. Socialist theory recognised that individuals had claims to basic welfare services against the state and education was viewed as one of these welfare entitlements. This was in contrast to [[Liberalism|liberal]] theory at the time, which regarded non-state actors as the prime providers of education. Socialist ideals were enshrined in the 1936 [[Soviet Constitution]], which was the first constitution to recognise the right to education with a corresponding obligation of the state to provide such education. The constitution guaranteed free and compulsory education at all levels, a system of state scholarships and vocational training in state enterprises. Subsequently, the right to education featured strongly in the constitutions of socialist states.&lt;ref name="Beiter 2005 23"/&gt; As a political goal, right to education was declared in F. D. Roosevelt's 1944 speech on the [[Second Bill of Rights]].

==Implementation==
[[International law]] does not protect the right to pre-[[primary education]] and international documents generally omit references to education at this level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Protection of the Right to Education by International Law |last=Beiter |first=Klaus Dieter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location= |isbn=9789004147041|pages=19–20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWs2UCuG-XQC&amp;dq=%22right+to+education%22&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that everyone has the right to education, hence the right applies to all individuals, although children are considered as the main beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Protection of the Right to Education by International Law |last=Beiter |first=Klaus Dieter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location= |isbn=9789004147041|pages=20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWs2UCuG-XQC&amp;dq=%22right+to+education%22&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rights to education are separated into three levels: 
* Primary (Elemental or Fundamental) Education. This shall be compulsory and free for any child regardless of their nationality, gender, place of birth, or any other discrimination. Upon ratifying the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] States must provide free primary education within two years. 
* Secondary (or Elementary, Technical and Professional in the [[UDHR]]) Education must be generally available and accessible. 
* At the University Level, Education should be provided according to capacity. That is, anyone who meets the necessary education standards should be able to go to university. 
Both secondary and higher education shall be made accessible "by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights#Article 13|Article 13 (2) (a) to (c), International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compulsory education===
The realisation of the right to education on a national level may be achieved through [[compulsory education]], or more specifically free compulsory primary education, as stated in both the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_cescr.htm Article 14, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Right to education for children==
The rights of all children from early childhood stem from the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The declaration proclaimed in article 1: ‘All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights’. The declaration states that human rights begin at birth and that [[childhood]] is a period demanding special care and assistance [art. 25 (2)]. The 1959 [[Declaration of the Rights of the Child]] affirmed that: ‘mankind owes to the child the best it has to give’, including education. This was amplified by the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 which states that: ‘education shall be directed to the full development of the [[Personality|human personality]] and the sense of its dignity, and shall strengthen the respect for [[human rights]] and fundamental freedoms. [art. 13 (1)]&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002335/233558E.pdf|title=Investing against Evidence: The Global State of Early Childhood Care and Education|last=Marope|first=P.T.M.|last2=Kaga|first2=Y.|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100113-0|location=|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Declaration on [[Education For All|Education for All]] (EFA) adopted in 1990 in [[Jomtien Beach|Jomtien, Thailand]], states in article 5 that: ‘Learning begins at birth [...] This calls for [[Early childhood education|early childhood care and initial education]].’ A decade later, the Dakar Framework for Action on EFA established six goals, the first of which was: ‘expanding and improving early childhood care and education, especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children.’ Protection of children of all ages from exploitation and actions that would jeopardize their health, education and well-being has also been emphasized by the [[International Labour Organization]] in Conventions No. 138 on the Minimum Age of Employment (1973) and No. 182 on the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour (1999). The United Nations contributed to such endeavours by the Declaration of the Rights of the Child unanimously adopted by the General Assembly in 1959.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==The impact of privatization on the right to education==
The [[privatization]] of education can have a positive impact for some [[social group]]s, in the form of increased availability of learning opportunities, greater parental choice and a wider range of [[Curriculum|curricula]]. However, it can also have negative effects resulting from insufficient or inadequate monitoring and regulation by the public authorities (schools without licences, hiring of untrained [[teacher]]s and absence of quality assurance), with potential risks for social cohesion and solidarity. Of particular concern: "Marginalised groups fail to enjoy the bulk of positive impacts and also bear the disproportionate burden of the negative impacts of privatisation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Privatisation of Education: Global Trends of Human Rights Impacts|url=http://www.right-to-education.org/sites/right-to-education.org/files/resource-attachments/RTE_Privatisation%20of%20Education_Global%20Trends%20of%20Human%20Rights%20Impacts_2014.pdf|author=Right to Education Project|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, uncontrolled fees demanded by private providers could undermine [[universal access to education]]. More generally, this could have a negative impact on the enjoyment of the right to a good quality education and on the realization of equal educational opportunities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supplemental private tutoring, or ‘shadow education’, which represents one specific dimension of the privatization of education, is also growing worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Confronting the shadow education system. What government policies for what private tutoring?|last=|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO-WEEPIE|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often a symptom of badly functioning school systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UNESCO|first=|year=2014|title=Teaching and Learning: Achieving quality for all|url=|journal=EFA Global Monitoring Report 2013-2014|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; private tutoring, much like other manifestations of private education, can have both positive and negative effects for learners and their teachers. On one hand, teaching can be tailored to the needs of slower learners and teachers can supplement their school salaries. On the other hand, fees for private tutoring may represent a sizeable share of [[household income]], particularly among the poor, and can therefore create inequalities in learning opportunities. And the fact that some teachers may put more effort into private tutoring and neglect their regular duties can adversely affect the quality of teaching and learning at school.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bray|first=M.|last2=Kuo|first2=O.|year=2014|title=Regulating Private Tutoring for Public Good. Policy options for supplementary education in Asia|url=|journal=CERC Monograph Series in Comparative and International Education and Development|publisher=Hong Kong, Comparative Education Research Center and UNESCO Bangkok Office|volume=No. 10|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of shadow education, the financial resources mobilized by individuals and families, and the concerns regarding possible teacher misconduct and corruption are leading some ministries of education to attempt to regulate the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As well, teachers always forcibly indoctrinate their students in private school settings.

'''Ritual servitude(trokosi system)
''' is a practice in [[Ghana]], [[Togo]], and [[Benin]] where traditional religious shrines (popularly called [[fetish shrines]] in Ghana) take human beings, usually young virgin girls, in payment for services, or in religious atonement for alleged misdeeds of a family member. In Ghana and in Togo it is practiced by the [[Ewe people|Ewe tribe]] in the Volta region; in Benin it is practiced by the [[Fon people|Fon]].&lt;ref&gt;FAQ About the Form of Slavery Called Trokosi, ECM Publications, 2002, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

These shrine slaves serve the priests, elders, and owners of a traditional religious shrine without remuneration and without their consent, although the consent of the family or clan may be involved.  Those who practice ritual servitude usually feel that the girl is serving the god or gods of the shrine and is married to the gods of the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;''Field Findings on the System of Slavery Commonly Known as Trokosi'', L W Rouster, M.R.E., ECMAfrica Publications, 2005, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a girl runs away or dies, she must be replaced by another girl from the family. Some girls in ritual servitude are the third or fourth girl in their family suffering for the same crime, sometimes for something as minor as the loss of trivial property.

It is still practiced in the Volta region in Ghana, in spite of being outlawed in 1998, and despite carrying a minimum three-year prison sentence for conviction. Among the Ewes who practice the ritual in Ghana, variations of the practice are also called ''trokosi'', ''fiashidi'', and ''woryokwe'', with "trokosi" being the most common of those terms.&lt;ref&gt;"The Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery/Human Rights Violations" by Stephen Awudi Gadri, Authorhouse, UK, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In Togo and Benin it is called ''voodoosi'' or ''vudusi''.&lt;ref&gt;"Field Findings on the System of Slavery Commonly Known as Trokosi", L W Rouster, M.R.E., ECMAfrica Publications, 2005, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Victims are commonly known in Ghana as fetish slaves because the gods of African Traditional Religion are popularly referred to as fetishes and the priests who serve them as fetish priests.

==Use of the terms "servitude", "slave" and "slavery"==
Human rights organizations and other NGO's commonly use the words "servitude", "slaves", and "slavery" as non-technical, popularly understood terms that describe the reality of this practice.  They point out that the practice meets all the commonly accepted definitions of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;''Rouster, Wives of the gods'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
Shrine slaves perform services which are not voluntary and are not paid.  Their lives are totally controlled by the shrines, who in a sense become their owners.

Proponents of the system  of ritual servitude by any of its names object to this term, but except for the technical terms "trokosi", "vudusi", "fiashidi", "woryokoe", the problem is coming up with a suitable alternative.  Sometimes they have compared the trokosi to traditional queen mothers, implying a sense of respect for them, but one representative of an NGO who claims to have interviewed hundreds of participants reports that the participants themselves are offended at being called queens and insist they are/were simply slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, ''Wives of the gods'' p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Juliana Dogbadzi, who served 17 years as a trokosi, says she was "slave to a fetish priest".&lt;ref&gt;Juliana Dogbadzi, PARADE magazine, "One Voice," September 24, 2000, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Cudjoe Adzumah made a study of the practice in the Tongu Districts of Ghana and defined "trokosi" as "slaves of the gods".&lt;ref&gt;Cudjoe Adzumah, "The Trokosi Practice in N Tongu: Its Impact on the Rights of Women and Children, BA Thesis, Sociology Department, University of Ghana, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emmanuel Kwaku Akeampong, a native Ghanaian of Harvard University, says that "tro" means a "god" and "kosi" is used at different times to mean either "slave", "virgin", or "wife".&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Kwaku Akeampong, ''Between the Sea and the Lagoon, an Eco-Social History of the Anlo of Southeastern Ghana c. 1850 to Recent Times,'' Ohio University Press, Athens, OH, James Currey, Oxford, 2001, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Anita Ababio, a Ghanaian lawyer who has extensively researched the issue, explains that the Adangbe and Ga word, "woryokwe" comes from "won" meaning cult, and "yokwe", meaning "slave".  Thus, she claims, a "woryokwe" is a "slave of a cult".&lt;ref&gt;Anita Mamusina Heymann Ababio, "Trokosi, Woryokwe, Cultural and Individual Rights: A Case Study of Women's Empowerment and Community Rights in Ghana, St. Mary's University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, August 22, 2000, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Kwame Amen in ''Ghana Studies'' also refers to trokosi as an institution of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;
Robert Kwame Amen, ''Trokosi (Child Slavery) in Ghana, a Policy Approach'', Ghana Studies I, 1998, p. 35-62.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, Stephen Awudi Gadri, President of the Trokosi Abolition Fellowship of Ghana, and also himself from a shrine family, claims that trokosi are "slaves of the deities of the shrines".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Awudi Gadri, ''History of the Trokosi System in Ghana'', Vol. 1, Paper presented to the First National Congress on the Trokosi System, June 29, 2000, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;   "Though euphemistically, they are called the 'deity's wives', yet they serve the priests and elders of the shrine and do all the hard chores, as well as becoming sexual partners of the priest," Gadri says.&lt;ref&gt;Gadri, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also says, "the trokosi works for the priest without any form of remuneration whatsoever", and "it is a form of slavery".&lt;ref&gt;Gadri, p. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;
Ababio claims, "The servile status of the trokosi is seen in the duties they perform in the shrines, for which no payment is made...unfortunately for most trokosi, when they are freed they are still bound by rituals which keep them connected or attached to a shrine for life. Practically it means that these victims of ritual servitude always have the rights of ownership exercised over them."&lt;ref&gt;Ababio, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; She then goes on to quote Article 7 of ''The Convention on Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery'', which defines a slave as "a person over whom any or all powers attaching to the rights of ownership are exercised".  Angela Dwamena-Aboagye, a Ghanaian lawyer, says ritual servitude is "slavery, pure and simple.  It violates every human right."&lt;ref&gt;Ababio, quoting ''The Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery'', 1956, ECOSOC, Res. 608, XXI, 1956.  This convention has been ratified and acceded to by Ghana.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the traditional priests also admit the trokosi are slaves.  For example, Togbe Adzimashi Adukpo, a shrine priest, admitted in an interview with BBC in February 2001, "Yes, the girls are my slaves.  They are the property of my shrine."&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Hawaley, "Ghana's Trapped Slaves", BBC News, February 8, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the question of whether trokosi is a form of slavery and whether sexual abuse is involved the answers are polarized into two camps.  Some traditionalists defend the system saying that it is simply a cultural practice of certain shrines and as such should be protected.  These defenders claim that while instances of sexual abuse may occur, there is no evidence that sexual or physical abuse is an ingrained or systematic part of the practice.  According to them, the practice explicitly forbids a Trokosi to engage in sexual activity or contact.  The other camp is represented by NGOs working with the trokosi and by former trokosi who have been liberated.  These opponents of the practice have recorded testimony of hundreds of former (now liberated) trokosi who say that sexual abuse was a regular part of their time at the shrine, claiming the number of children born to them by the priest and shrine elders is a witness.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, Field Findings, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although virtually everyone recognizes that the victims themselves have no choice or say in their lot, Stephen Awudi Gadri says that "both the parents (of the victims) and the girls (that is, the victims) have no choice".&lt;ref&gt;The Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery", p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious connections==
Simon Abaxe has researched the practice in Ghana.  He says that ritual servitude is part of African Traditional Religion in some places, but not a universal practice of that religion.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Abaxer, "Trokosi Situation on the Ground in Volta Region", ECMAfrica Publications, 2007, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  A form of it is also practiced in India and Nepal as part of Hindu religion, and various forms of it were part of ancient religious traditions of devotion to various gods and goddesses.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  It is distinguished from the Christian monastic tradition at a basic level since ritual servitude is involuntary on the part of the participant, in contrast to Christian monasticism, which is voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, ''Field Findings'' p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons==
There are two major reasons for the practice of ritual servitude.  Most common is the concept of atonement.  A girl is given to the shrine or to the gods as a kind of "living sacrifice" to atone for the real or alleged crimes of a family member or ancestor, as discerned by the priest of the shrine.  During a process of divination he calls on the gods of the shrine to reveal this information.  Girls given to atone for such crimes in a sense are considered a kind of savior, for as long as she remains in the shrine or under its control, the anger of the god is believed to be averted from the rest of the family.&lt;ref name="Rouster, Field Findings p. 5"&gt;Rouster, ''Field Findings'' p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second most frequent reason for the practice of ritual servitude is that the girl is given for the continuous repayment of the gods for services believed to have been obtained or favors believed to have been rendered from the shrine.  Thus a girl may be given into ritual servitude when someone believes a child has been conceived or a person has been healed, for example, through the intervention of the shrine.&lt;ref name="Rouster, Field Findings p. 5"/&gt;

Proponents of the practice claim that some participants choose a life of ritual servitude of their own volition, but human rights organizations claim that while this may be theoretically possible, they haven't found one yet.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, ''Field Findings'' p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, the traditions of the shrines were veiled in secrecy, and people dared not discuss them, fearing the wrath of the gods if they dared to do so.  For this reason, the practice was neither widely known nor well understood.  In more recent times, since the 1990s at least, abolitionists and human rights advocates have penetrated the veil of secrecy.  The issue has been widely discussed, for instance, in the newspapers and on the radio in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;Every Child Ministries, ''The Three Pillars of Trokosi'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and history==

===In the Dahomey Empire===
The giving of virgin girls to the gods was part of many ancient religions.  In West Africa, the practice has gone on for at least several hundred years.  Similar practices using similar terminology were found in the royal court of the Kingdom of Dahomey (in what is now Benin) in the 18th and 19th centuries.  Wives, slaves, and in fact all persons connected with the royal palace of Dahomey were called "ahosi", from "aho" meaning "king", and "si" meaning "dependent" or "subordinate."&lt;ref&gt;Wives of the Leopard-- Gender, Politics &amp; Culture in the Kingdom of Dahomey, Edna G. Bay, University of Virginia Press, 1998, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;   By one estimate there were 5,000 to 7,000 ahosi living in the palace at Abomey,&lt;ref&gt;Warrior Women, The Amazons of Dahomey &amp; the Nature of War", Robert B. Edgerton, University of California at Los Angeles, Westview Press, 2000, p. 15 &amp; 52.&lt;/ref&gt; and no men lived there except for a few hundred eunuchs were charged with controlling the women.  After sunset no men at all were allowed in the palace except the king, and he was guarded by women guards called Amazons.  The king controlled every aspect of the lives and even the deaths of the ahosi.  Visitors to old Abomey today are shown a mass grave and told that the king's wives "volunteered," on his death, to be buried alive with him in order to accompany him and serve him in the world to come.  One researcher pointed out, "Of course, one should not make the mistake of ascribing modern democratic meaning to the word "volunteered" as if the wives wanted to die or had any choice in the matter.&lt;ref&gt;"Lorella Rouster, Report on Visit to the Ancient Kingdom of Dahomey, May 2006, ECM Publications, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahosi who became too powerful or too independently minded were simply sacrificed (literally and physically) in the annual office ceremony lasting several days in which the power of the king was renewed by hundreds of human sacrifices, usually performed by public beheadings.&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, Warrior Women, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice was documented by [[A. B. Ellis]] who was an eyewitness of the practice in the Dahomey Empire (now Benin) in 1879. According to Ellis, one god called "Khebioso" had 1500 wives in Dahomey alone, the women being called "kosio".  He said they cared for the shrines of the gods, but their main business was religious prostitution.  According to Ellis, most of the gods of the Ewe-speaking people at that time had such women who were similarly consecrated to their service and were commonly considered "wives" of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Ellis, Major, First Battalion West India Regiment, ''The Ewe-Speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast of West Africa'', Bahamas, 1890, republished by Benin Press, Chicago, 1965, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

One might argue that those ahosi were wives of the king and lived in the palace, not wives of the gods living in the shrines.  But that distinction is not as clearcut as it might first seem, for the palace was the center of Dahomean religious life, and the place where sacrifices were made and rituals to the ancestors were performed.  Over time, then, it was an easy jump from being ahosi living lives totally controlled by the king in the palace where sacrifices were offered and rituals were performed, to being trokosi living lives totally controlled by a priest in a shrine where sacrifices were offered and rituals were performed.  It was a very easy transition indeed.  Even in the time of the Kingdom of Dahomey, one reads of the vodun or gods successfully demanding that someone become a devotee or vodunsi (wife or follower of the god).&lt;ref&gt;Wives of the Leopard, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Ghana===
As people migrated within West Africa, the practice spread.  Sandra Greene has noted that in Ghana, the practice dates to at least the late 18th century.  At the time the Amlade clan Sui became very powerful, and began to demand female slaves from those who sought its services.  The practice called "replacement" also began in Ghana at that time.  Under this practice, if a shrine slave died or ran away, the family was required to replace her with another girl.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra E. Greene, Gender, Ethnicity and Social Change on the Upper Slave Coast: A History of the Anlo-Ewe, Portsmouth, 1996, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 19th century, Nyigbla became the chief Anlo deity, and its shrines also began to demand slaves for its services.  Involuntary slavery, however, was not at that time and in that place common, since Nyigbla also instituted a practice called foasi, whereby two servants were recruited annually on a more-or-less voluntary basis.  At that time, the slaves were often married to members of powerful priestly families.&lt;ref&gt;Akeampong,p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of opposition to the practice==

===In colonial times===
It is reported by traditionalists that since the mid-18th century the Bremen missionaries decried the practice and purchased freedom for individual trokosi, which were then called "new made slaves", converting them to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mypage.bluewin.ch/yehwehpyramid/trokosi.html Pyramid of Yahweh, about trokosi, p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ghana (then [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]]) was under colonial rule, a few citizens complained about the practice, but the colonial masters turned their heads.  They derided him{{who|date=July 2012}} as "the blind man who wants to help others see".  The colonial government did investigate the practice at Atigo shrine near Battor from 1919 to 1924.  The investigating District Commissioner, W. Price Jones, called it "a pernicious habit of handing girls over to the fetish", but for economic reasons, decided not to interfere.  As a result of that inquiry, shrine slaves held at the Atigo shrine were told they could return home if they wished.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives of Ghana, Accra, ADM 11/1/768 Acting District Commissioner of Ada, W. Price Jones to Commissioner for the Eastern Province (CEP), 10 March 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after, the colonial government ignored another complaint that the shrine was still keeping trokosi.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives of Ghana, CEP, to Secretary of Native Affairs, Koforidua, 10 September 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the practice slid back into secrecy and was not brought to the public consciousness again until 1980.

===In the 1980s===
The practice was drawn into the national spotlight at that time when [[Mark Wisdom]], a Baptist pastor, responded to what he claims was a vision from God, and challenged the system in the national media. Wisdom claimed that as he prayed, he saw a vision of women in bonds, crying out for help.  Wisdom claimed to have later discovered these same women on one of his evangelistic missions, held in bondage in a shrine just across the Volta River from his home, but previously unknown to him.  He began publicly denouncing the practice, so much so that headlines in Ghana screamed that he was not afraid of the shrine priests.  Wisdom wrote a book on the subject, founded FESLIM (Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement), and was instrumental in some of the earliest liberations, but it was his bold public statements reported in the news that pricked the national consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Mark Wisdom granted to the VR staff of Every Child Ministries, June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the 1990s===
In the early 1990s, Ghanaian journalist Vincent Azumah found courage to write publicly about the practice and sparked a nationwide debate.  Then the International Federation of Women Laywyers in Ghana (FIDA) organized an investigation into shrine practices and issued a report in 1992.  These events took place while [[Jerry Rawlings]] still held the presidency of Ghana with an iron fist.  Rawlings and his administration were defenders of African Traditional Religion, calling it the "African Heritage" and a cause for national pride.  One example of this was his granting of free air time to the founder of the Afrikania movement, Okomfo Damuah, at a time when Christian churches were virtually denied access to both radio and TV.  Azumah and FIDA's actions were very bold in the light of the political climate of the day.&lt;ref name="Ababio, p. 21"&gt;Ababio, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ghana National Commission on Children brought attention to the issue during the celebration of the Organization of African Unity Day of the African Child on June 16, 1993. In 1994 and 1995 Ghanaian lawyer Anita Heymann Ababio researched the practice in the light of Ghanaian law, and recommendations from this research later became a Law Reform Commission report to the Ghana government in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Heymann, Ababio A., ''The Impact of the Constitutional Provisions on the Customary Disabilities of Women in Ghana'', Report on the Abolition of Ritual Slavery, Forced Labour and Other Related Practices, Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, University of London, April 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Emmanuel Kweku Akeampong, a Ghanaian professor of history at Harvard University, the practice of trokosi was much in the national attention in 1996 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Akeampong, p. 221-226.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outlawed in Ghana 1998===
In 1998 the Law Reform Commission, drawing on the recommendations of Ababio and others, drafted a law specifying "ritual or customary servitude" as a crime.  The law passed, requiring a mandatory three-year prison term for those found guilty.&lt;ref name="Ababio, p. 21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Criminal Code of Ghana, Act. 1998 Act. 554.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International award 1999===
In 1999 Juliana Dogbadzi, a former trokosi, won the Reebok Human Rights Award for her efforts in speaking up on behalf of her fellow trokosi.&lt;ref&gt;James Aidoo, "Ghana, Liberating the Trokosi" p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===NGOs oppose the practice===
Although the practice was outlawed in Ghana in 1998, it continued, due to fear and the reluctance of the government to interfere with traditional practices.  Some NGOs had already worked to liberate shrines, but after the law did not solve the problem, NGOs began to get even more seriously involved in advocating against the practice and in working for agreements to reduce the practice by liberating individual shrines.
Some of the organizations that have joined the effort are UNICEF, International Needs Network Ghana, the Swiss "Sentry Movement", Trokosi Abolition Fellowship, the Anti-Slavery Society, and Every Child Ministries.  Survivors for Change is a group of former trokosi who have banded together to speak up against the practice.  Organizations that have been most active in liberating ritual slaves are FESLIM (Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement), founded by Mark Wisdom, International Needs, and Every Child Ministries.  Christian NGOs and human rights organizations have been fighting it—working to end the practice and to win liberation for the shrine slaves.  They have carried out their activities with strong support from CHRAJ—The Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice—and the Ministry of Women's and Children's Affairs.  A Court of Women was organized in Accra in 2003 to continue the fight against the practice.

==Meaning of "Trokosi" and "Vudusi"==
The word '''''trokosi''''' comes from the [[Ewe language|Ewe]] words "tro", meaning deity or fetish, and "kosi", meaning female slave.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Trokosi Terms, www.trokosi.com&lt;/ref&gt; The "tro" deity is not, according to African traditional religion, the Creator or what might be called the "High" or Ultimate God.  "Tro" refers to what African Traditional Religion calls the "small gods" or "lesser deities"—spirits of nature, etc. which are venerated in traditional religion.  The term '''''trokosi''''' is commonly used in English in Ghana, as a [[loanword]].

===Categories of ''Tro'' adherents===

#Those who join the ''Tro'' of their own volition (extremely rare) and those who were born to women associated with the ''Tro'' and initiated as children (''Trovivo'');
#Those thought to have been born through the intervention of the ''Tro'' (''Dorflevivo'') and thus incur a lifetime obligation of servitude to the tro;
#Those allegedly called by the tro to serve as priest and priestesses of the shrine (''Tronua'');
#Those who were forced to become ''Trokosi'' to repay the ''Tro'' because their family supposedly benefited from it.
#Those ''Trokosi'' who are sent by families, often against the will of the girl involved, out of fear that if they do not do so, further calamities may afflict them through the anger of the shrine deities. This last group consists of those vestal virgins who are sent into servitude at the shrines of the ''Troxovi'' due to crimes allegedly committed by their senior or elder family members, almost always males like fathers, grandfathers, and uncles.  The trokosi is sort of a "living sacrifice," who by her suffering is thought to save the family from trouble.

Opponents of the practice claim that all except those who joined of their own volition are virtually slaves in every normal sense of the word.

NGO's point out that practices in traditional shrines vary, but trokosi are usually denied education, suffer a life of hardship, and are a lonely lot, stigmatized by society.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, Field Findings, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of servitude varies from a few months to life.  In some cases it involves payment of a heavy fine to the shrine, which can require many years of hard labor or even a lifetime of service to pay.  In shrines where the period of servitude is limited, after a ritual and sometimes after months or years in the shrine, the Trokosi returns to her family, but her life is still controlled by the shrine for the rest of her life. Supporters of the practice claim that in the vast majority of cases, there is no particular stigma attached to one's status as a former Trokosi shrine participant. NGOs working to rehabilitate former trokosi say that the social stigma is immense and that it is the most enduring and difficult aspect of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Lorella Rouster, International Director of Every Child Ministries, June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main variations in the practice==
Ritual slavery shows a high degree of cohesiveness, but there are many significant differences as it is practiced in various shrines and in various areas.  Every Child Ministries, a Christian NGO that has done much research on the topic, lists these as variations that they have observed in their work:&lt;ref name="Interview with Rouster, ECM, 2006"&gt;Interview with Rouster, ECM, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entry age of the participants===
Most frequently those in ritual servitude are young virgin girls at the time of entry into the shrine.  Of course, the girls grow up, so where their servitude is long or lifetime, the participants are of all ages.

===Length of service===
There are two basic lengths of service—perpetual or lifetime service and limited service.  One traditional priest expressed the view that once a crime had been committed, it had to be atoned for until the end of time.  This is the view of lifetime or perpetual service.  Shrine slaves serving for a lifetime have no hope of ever getting free unless outsiders intervene on their behalf.  In some shrines, in some areas, and for some alleged crimes, the service is limited to a specific number of years.  In other cases, a substantial fee is exacted from the shrine slave or her family.  The girls work to try to earn that fee, but in reality the fee is so high and their means of paying it so low that there is virtually no hope of ever paying off the debt that has been laid on them.
Some shrines have taken so many slaves that they cannot contain them all.  Some slaves become unattractive or unuseful to the priest.  In these cases trokosia may be given what is called "temporary" release.  This is actually a misnomer, since it is a permanent condition.  The temporary part only gives the slave permission to live outside the shrine temporarily.  All the important decisions of her life are still controlled by the shrine, she is still at the beck and call of the priest, and she has to serve at the annual festival of the god every year, for which she is required to bring gifts that may take her all year to accumulate.
One child of a trokosi on "temporary release" said, "whenever my mother goes fishing or does any work, she must divide it into three, with two parts going to the priest."&lt;ref&gt;"Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery", p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practice of replacement===
Where perpetual or lifetime servitude is practiced, the shrines often, but not always, practice what they call "replacement."  when a trokosi or vudusi dies or runs away, she has to be replaced by another virgin from the same family or clan.  Some human rights interviewers report that they have interviewed numerous girls who were the third or fourth replacements for their families for a crime that was allegedly committed long ago.&lt;ref name="Interview with Rouster, ECM, 2006"/&gt;

===Practice of rape by the priest and elders of the shrine===
In most shrines it is considered a duty of the shrine slaves to have obligatory sex with the priest and sometimes the elders.  The priest's genital organs have been dedicated to the gods of the shrine, so having sex with him is considered a sacred act - in a sense, copulating with the gods.  This is the origin and meaning of the term "wives of the gods."  Many trokosi and vudusi have described beatings and other severe punishments imposed on them for refusing sex with the priest.  In Ghana, human rights organizations monitoring the practice of "trokosi" claim that shrine slaves often end up with an average of four children while in servitude, many of them by the priest or elders of the shrines.  Proponents of ritual servitude deny that this is a part of the practice.  There seem to be wide differences between practices in different districts, but Rouster claims that the problem of forced sex in many of the shrines is too well documented to be disputed.&lt;ref name="Interview with Rouster, ECM, 2006"/&gt;
Stephen Awudi Gadri, founder of Trokosi Abolition Fellowship, speaks of "ritual violation after menarche" (first menses) as the beginning of a life of coerced sex.&lt;ref&gt;"The Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery", p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to the trokosi as "vestal virgins." &lt;ref&gt;Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of shrine slaves===
Treatment of girls in the shrine varies as to feeding practices, reasons for and severity of punishments, sleeping and living conditions.  Severe and widespread problems have been documented in all these areas by human rights organizations.  Many of the shrine slaves are required to do heavy physical labor like cultivating fields with a hand hoe.  Other common duties are weaving mats, making and selling firewood (with all profits going to the priest or the shrine), fetching wood and water, sweeping the compound and attending the images of the gods.

==Liberation of shrine slaves==
[[NGO]]'s and other [[human rights]] organizations are fighting the practice.  Since the 1990s, these groups have actively sought to liberate girls held in ritual servitude.  Liberation has been done on a shrine-by-shrine basis, with NGO's seeking to reach community-wide agreements that all the slaves of a particular shrine will be liberated and the practice of slavery or ritual servitude will be permanently ended in that place.  When such an agreement is reached, a public ceremony is held for the signing of the documents and often, liberation certificates for the former slaves.  The shrine is compensated for its loss and the former trokosi begin a process of rehabilitation which usually includes learning vocational skills.

The most active groups in liberating shrine slaves through negotiated community agreements have been FESLIM, Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement, International Needs Network, and Every Child Ministries.

The first liberation ceremonies were held at Lomo and Me shrines in Volo in October 1996, at three shrines in Dorfor in December 1996, and at Atigo shrine in Battor in January 1997.[54] International Needs Network liberated 400 trokosi from a group of small shrines in November 2000, and 126 at Adidome in November 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Nirit Ben-Ari, "Liberating Girls from Trokosi" from Africa Recovery, Vol 15, #4, Dec. 2001, p. 26.
&lt;/ref&gt; Every Child Ministries cooperated with International Needs Network to liberate 465 trokosi from three shrines of the Agave area in January 2003 and with Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement to liberate 94 shrine slaves from Aklidokpo shrine near Adidome in January 2004.  They continued the effort, liberating 120 from Sovigbenor shrine in Aflao in December 2005, and 52 "yevesi" or servants of the thunder god from the Kadza Yevesi Shrine at Aflao in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;"African Jewels",a 2nd Quarter 2010, Every Child Ministries&lt;/ref&gt; Shrines of the Anlo clan in Ghana also hold trokosi, but have resisted liberation and defended the practice, defending their practice of trokosi as being more humane than the practices of other districts. Human rights organizations insist that the practice must be totally eradicated.

==Universities==
The most prestigious universities generally attract excellent scientists and have fine science programs. University campuses are usually open to the public, though permission from guards is sometimes required, and there may be some café or cafeteria or mensa or restaurant or even a university shop on site. Universities usually offer public lectures about ongoing research. Otherwise, their seminars and buildings are reserved for the students and the working faculty including post-doctoral researchers or professors. On weekends or holidays, many universities require special permits to enter. Universities compete on a worldwide basis; hence, they are not ordered by geographical position or alphabetized. Below is a list of the 20 highest-ranked universities according to 2013/2014 QS world university ranking (of course rankings may differ according to year and specific subject).

The term '''sewing circle''' usually refers to a group of people, usually women, who meet regularly for the purpose of [[sewing]], often for charitable causes while chatting, gossiping, and/or discussing.

==Application to sewing==
Sewing circle participants, usually women, typically meet regularly for the purpose of sewing. They often also support charitable causes while chatting, gossiping, and/or discussing.

For example, in [[History of the United States (1789–1849)|ante-bellum America]], local anti-slavery or missionary "sewing circles were complementary, not competing, organisations that allowed [women] to act on their concern for creating a more just and moral society".&lt;ref name=Lawes&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and Reform in a New England Community, 1815-1860|year=2000|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|location=Kentucky, US|isbn=0-8131-2131-0|page=78|editor=Carolyn J. Lawes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of sewing circles include the [[Fragment Society]], the [[Sewing circle (Mennonite)|Mennonite Sewing Circle]], and those organized by [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] survivor [[Frank John William Goldsmith|Emily Goldsmith]] aboard the rescue ship [[RMS Carpathia|RMS ''Carpathia'']]: Goldsmith, "a talented seamstress, organized sewing circles to make garments out of cloth and blankets for those passengers dressed in nightclothes when they entered the lifeboats."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=TITANIC - A Voyage of Discovery |title=The Search for the Dead |url=http://www.euronet.nl/users/keesree/dead.htm |accessdate=March 13, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991023113336/http://www.euronet.nl/users/keesree/dead.htm |archivedate=October 23, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from charitable purposes, contemporary sewing circles may be formed into organisations on a national level, such as the Guilds in Australia and America "for people who regard sewing as a creative and rewarding activity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Australian Sewing Guild|url = http://www.aussew.org.au|accessdate = 11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The American Sewing Guild|url=http://www.asg.org/|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Chew the rag"===
It has been speculated that the phrase [[Chew the fat|"chew the rag"]], is related to gossiping while working in a sewing circle.

== Other uses ==
'''Sewing circle''' is also a phrase used (by [[Marlene Dietrich]], for instance&lt;ref name=freeman&gt;{{cite news|last=Freeman|first=David|title=Closet Hollywood: A gossip columnist discloses some secrets about movie idols|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/01/07/reviews/010107.07freemat.html?_r=1|accessdate=18 April 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=7 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to describe the underground, [[closeted]] [[lesbian]] and [[bisexual]] film actresses and their relationships in [[Hollywood]], [[United States]], particularly during Hollywood's golden age from the 1910s to the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Madsen|first=Axel|title=The Sewing Circle: Sappho's Leading Ladies|year=2002|publisher=Kensington Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7582-0101-0|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwxFfhiFcAAC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=%22sewing%20circles%22%20lesbian&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage was coined by the actress [[Alla Nazimova]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtqarchive.com/arts/film_actors_lesbian_A.pdf Film Actors: Lesbian], glbtq.com.

'''Sistema Sac Actun''' (from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Yucatec Maya]] meaning "White Cave System") is an underwater cave system situated along the Caribbean coast of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] with passages to the north and west of the village of [[Tulum, Quintana Roo|Tulum]]. Discovery of a connection to the [[Sistema Dos Ojos]] has made it the longest known underwater cave system as of (2018).

The remains of a [[mastodon]] and a human female that might be the oldest evidence of [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|human habitation]] in this area to date have been found in the cave.

==History of exploration==
Exploration started from ''Gran [[Cenote]]'' {{convert|5|km|sp=us}} west of Tulum. The whole of the explored cave system lies within the [[Tulum Municipality|Municipality of Tulum]] (state of [[Quintana Roo]]).

In early 2007, the underwater cave [[Sistema Nohoch Nah Chich]] was connected into and subsumed into Sac Actun making it the [[List of longest caves|longest surveyed underwater cave system]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= John Roach | title=World's Longest Underground River Discovered in Mexico | date= {{Date|2007-03-05|mdy}} | publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] | url =http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/03/070305-cave-river.html | work =National Geographic News | accessdate= {{Date|2011-01-14|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sac Actun measured {{convert|230.8|km|sp=us}} (after connecting ''Sistema Aktun Hu'' with {{convert|34|km|sp=us}} in January 2011) and is as of May 2017 with an explored length of {{convert|259.5|km|sp=us}} only surpassed by [[Sistema Ox Bel Ha]] at {{convert|270.2|km|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="QRSS1" /&gt; Since early 2007, these two caves frequently exchanged the title of the longest Quintana Roo Speleological Survey underwater cave system in the world.&lt;ref name="Gulden1"&gt;{{cite web | author = Michael Poucher, Bob Gulden | title = World longest underwater caves | publisher = NSS | work = Geo2 Committee on Long and Deep Caves | url = http://www.caverbob.com/uwcaves.htm | date = {{Date|2017-03-21|mdy}} | accessdate = {{Date|2017-05-26|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Including connected dry caves makes Sistema Sac Actun with {{convert|347.7|km|sp=us}} the longest cave in Mexico&lt;ref name="QRSS2" /&gt; and the second longest worldwide.&lt;ref name="Gulden2"&gt;{{cite web | author = Bob Gulden | title = Worlds longest caves | publisher = NSS | work = Geo2 Committee on Long and Deep Caves | url = http://www.caverbob.com/wlong.htm | date = {{Date|2016-11-28|mdy}} | accessdate = {{Date|2017-05-26|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, a discovery of link between the Sac Actun system (reported to be 263 km long) and the [[Sistema Dos Ojos|Dos Ojos system]] in Tulum, Quintana Roo (84 km long) has been reported.&lt;ref&gt;"Underwater cave is the world’s biggest", Mexico Daily News, January 15, 2018, https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/underwater-cave-is-worlds-biggest/ (accessed 2018-01-17).&lt;/ref&gt;  The combined system is reported to be the world's largest underwater cave system known.

==Upper Paleolithic remains==
In March 2008, three members of the ''Proyecto Espeleológico de Tulum'' and [[Global Underwater Explorers]] dive team, Alex Alvarez, Franco Attolini, and Alberto Nava, explored a section of ''Sistema Aktun Hu'' known as the pit ''Hoyo Negro''.&lt;ref name="cindaqnewsletter_dec2010"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cave Archeology of Early Americans |publisher=El Centro Investigador del Sistema Aquífero de Quintana Roo |journal=News from the Field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4223">{{unreferenced|date=July 2016}}'''Smart film''', also called '''Switchable film''', is a product that is capable of adjusting light transmission between [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] and [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] using AC power. Due to moisture sensitivity, earlier versions of the film were used only to make [[smart glass]] by lamination on glass. With continual improvement in moisture resistance, the new (3rd) generation of the film can be directly installed on existing windows with special glue or self-adhesive. It combines many functions, such as light adjustment, UV and infrared blocking, advertising and security.

Most of the film applications are via glass, acrylic or polycarbonate laminates, mainly having to do with the voltage (110VAC) required to operate the film. Companies continue to attempt various installation methods in order to use the film by itself without having to add the lamination cost.

One of the advantages of smart film is that it eliminates the need for blinds, shades or window treatments.

== Technology ==

[[Smart glass#Polymer dispersed liquid crystal devices|Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystals (PDLCs)]]
 
1. Without power the liquid crystal molecules (microdroplets) are disordered. This prevents light from penetrating the film, rendering it opaque.

2. When power is applied to the smart film the liquid crystal molecules are forced into alignment, rendering it transparent.

== Application ==

===Electric curtain===
Environmental and energy-saving for green building material. It uses transparent or haze temperature control film, makes the smart film a haze state when the indoor temperature is high, when the light reduces, the smart film is in a translucent state; when the light is weak, the smart film is in a transparent state.

===Projection screen===
Smart film can be used as a '''switchable projection screen''' on a store window for advertising. 3G smart film is good for both front and rear projection and projected images can be viewed from both sides.

===Multi-function===
* Combines touch IR and control by voice commands and the product to give customers more choice.
* Combines full color LED tube
* Combines laser membrane and many translucent printing membranes. 
* Combines the projector, effect of suspended particulate as transparent state.
* Combines multiple movies and advertise to appear in transparent glass.
* Combines with control system; upon all function can be used with smart film.

== Examples of use ==

;In the office 
* Applied to the glass enclosure of a conference room. When the glass is transparent, one can see into or out of the room, and when it is non-transparent it can be used as a projection screen. 
* Energy-saving function of glass curtain wall

;Indoor decoration of up-scale residence
*Lighting cover glass curtain, sunshine house, living room and bathroom compartment. The glass is in a cloudy state when out of use, which protects privacy, and when it turns to transparent, one may fully bathed in sunshine.

;Product display and commercial advertisement 
*Glass display window, protect the products when it is non-transparent, and may used for projection to introduce products; when it is transparent, it may be used for store advertising.

;Use for special occasions
*The glass door of a rest room is transparent when not in use, and immediately turns to a cloudy state when the door is closed.
*Glass floor and stairs on the second floor appear cloudy when walked upon, otherwise they are transparent.
*Privacy uses in hospitals, e.g., windows of infants' room and intensive care units, replacing curtains, to reduce dust and noise.
*Applied to dust-free rooms and cleaning rooms, smart films may be used to switch between transparent and non-transparent, and can reduce inconvenience for customers having to wear dust-free clothes passing in and out of the room.

== Colors ==

New generations of smart film include low haze and colors that include: milky white, gray, and blue.

'''''TEG''''' is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] strategy [[board wargame]] published in [[1976 in games|1976]], based on the game ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]''. The name is an acronym of ''Plan Táctico y Estratégico de la Guerra'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for ''Tactics and Strategy for War''.

==Gameplay==
''TEG'' follows a gameplay quite similar to the strategy board game ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]'', since it also features a board divided in many different regions and sub-regions along with the implementation of [[dice]] to decide battle results.

===Goal===
The goal of the game is to be the first player to fulfill the requisites of an objective,  without mattering whether it is the ''common objective'' '''or''' the ''secret objective''.

====Common Objective====
The Common objective is to conquer 30 countries; this objective is the same for all players.

====Secret Objective====
Apart from the ''common objective'', players have a secret objective; unlike the ''common objective'', the secret objective is:

* Hidden to other players
* Unique, it varies per player

===Board===
The board is divided into six continents which consist of a certain number of countries each; the total number of countries present in the game board is 50. These countries were randomly selected, and continents are slightly misrepresented.

The 50 Countries sorted into their respective continents are the following:

==Variants==
* ''TEG 2'', an advanced version of ''TEG'' with different types of armies.
* ''TEG: La Revancha'', an advanced version of ''TEG'' with same core rules, but far more countries and the addition of [[ICBM|missiles]].

==Popular culture==
The game appeared once in the film ''[[Kamchatka (film)|Kamchatka]]''. Although the film takes place in 1976 and their protagonists ([[Ricardo Darín]] and [[Cecilia Roth]]) are shown playing ''TEG'', the game was still not released for public sale.

It has been also referenced in a diapers TV advertisement, in which -among other criteria- the mother and the father play TEG in order to decide who cleans the baby ("China ataca Kamchatka" : "[[China]] attacks [[Kamchatka]]" the woman says).

{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}

'''Tape trading''' is an unofficial method of distribution of musical or video content through the [[mail|postal system]], which was prominent in the 1980s and 1990s. Although most commonly used to distribute and publicize limited-release musical [[demo (music)|demo]] tapes in underground musical genres such as [[punk rock|punk]], [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]], and [[extreme metal]], the system has also been used to distribute [[bootleg recording]]s of live concerts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bootlegging: romanticism and copyright in the music industry| first=Lee | last=Marshell |publisher=SAGE |year=2005|isbn= 978-0-7619-4490-4|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; recordings of radio broadcasts,&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;Trevor Pinch and Karin Bijsterveld, ''The Oxford Handbook of Sound Studies''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2012. {{ISBN|9780195388947}}. p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt; original radio-style programming by amateur broadcasters,&lt;ref name=transformations&gt;[http://www.transformationsjournal.org/journal/issue_10/article_05.shtml "Community radio in post-apartheid South Africa: The case of Bush Radio in Cape Town"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410022707/http://www.transformationsjournal.org/journal/issue_10/article_05.shtml |date=April 10, 2013 }}. ''Transformations'', February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and videotapes of underground [[films]].&lt;ref name=undergroundfilm&gt;[http://www.undergroundfilmjournal.com/tale-of-the-tape-trading/ "Tale Of The Tape Trading"]. ''Underground Film Journal'', October 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The practice faded in prominence in the 2000s, as the rise of [[internet]] technologies such as audio and video streaming, [[file sharing]] services and [[podcasting]] largely supplanted the need to mail out physical copies of recorded content. However, a smaller scale network of tape traders still exists as a sort of [[nostalgia|nostalgic]] hobby among fans of some musical genres.

==History==
Tape trading was a postal system reliant, penfriend style nature of an underground network that relied heavily on the cooperation of fans of different musical genres worldwide as well as the acts being promoted this way themselves eschewing any [[copyright]] in order to further spread their notoriety. Acts that gained a following through this might land a [[record deal]].

The [[ad hoc]] system relied on a system of trust, meaning that tapes were swapped in a kind of [[honor system]]; those who did not subscribe to this ethos and received tapes without returning the favor accordingly would become known as 'rip-offs' or 'rip-off traders' and were regarded with scorn. Flyers advertising gigs, recordings and other merchandises for sale were often swapped in conjunction with tape trading. Music that had been licensed to record companies (therefore subject to [[copyright]]) and released in the format of [[Vinyl records]], [[CD]] and MC ([[musicassette]]) was also pirated onto blank [[compact cassette]] medium and traded, although this was in infringement of both unofficial 'rules' of the network and actual copyright law itself.

Many traders would, unrequested, fill unused space on the C-60 and C-90 tapes of demos they compiled for fellow traders with local bands in which they were members, or acolytes of. This led to a musical cross-pollination between geographically diverse and disparate areas such as Scandinavia, USA and the UK and their own bands/scenes. One notable example of how initial contact through tape trading lent to this trend is in the case of [[Righteous Pigs]] guitarist [[Mitch Harris]] who hailed from [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and [[Birmingham]]'s [[Mick Harris]], drummer with [[Napalm Death]] (not related) who would later collaborate writing and recording music, Mitch Harris would eventually relocate to the UK for this purpose. The very nature of the system ensured that recordings would decrease in sound quality with each trade and would in extreme circumstance become almost unlistenable, although the advent of [[recordable CD]]s helped the preservation of sound quality of recordings throughout trades. The popularization of broadband internet and digital music in its various forms has led to music by unsigned acts being swapped electronically and therefore tape trading through the postal system is considered by most to be outdated.

Heavy metal tape trading (notably [[black metal]], [[death metal]], [[doom metal]]) through the postal system is still in practice, but mainly as a nostalgic hobby.  Most contact is made via email or penfriend-style mail conversation.

==Radio==
Tape trading was also in some respects an early precursor of podcasting, as the method could be used to redistribute radio programs to fans outside of a radio station's local broadcast area,&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Heylin, ''Bootleg: The Rise &amp; Fall of the Secret Recording Industry''. [[Music Sales Group]], 2003. {{ISBN|9781844491513}}. p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; or even as the main distribution method of non-broadcast amateur programming. This form of trading was especially, but not exclusively, used as an underground distribution method for content that was politically [[censorship|censored]]: for instance, the Cassette Education Trust, an anti-apartheid activist organization in [[South Africa]], used tape trading as the "broadcast" platform for its political and cultural programming prior to its launch as [[Bush Radio (South Africa)|Bush Radio]], the country's first licensed [[community radio]] station,&lt;ref name=transformations/&gt; and the Hungarian punk rock band [[CPg]] used its tape trading network to redistribute anti-Communist political commentary from [[Radio Free Europe]] alongside its music.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt;

==Video==
A related phenomenon of [[videotape]] trading also existed, to redistribute underground films in specialty genres such as [[cult films]], [[foreign film]]s or [[pornographic film|pornography]].&lt;ref name=undergroundfilm/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1749">'''The 2010 Imperative''' is an initiative issued by [[Architecture 2030]] that requires  [[ecology|ecological literacy]], largely missing from the curriculum in the United States, to become a key element of design education by 2010, in order to combat [[global warming]] and world [[resource depletion]].

==The initiative==
The 2010 Imperative calls for the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*Beginning in 2007, educators should add to all design studio problems the following requirement:
"Solutions to design problems must engage the environment in a way that dramatically reduces or eliminates the need for [[fossil fuel]]."&lt;br /&gt;

*By 2010, all academic design curricula shall achieve complete ecological literacy in design education, including the following areas of study:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	design / studio&lt;br /&gt;
	history / theory&lt;br /&gt;
	materials / technology&lt;br /&gt;
	structures / construction&lt;br /&gt;
	professional practice / ethics&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*By 2010, all design school campuses shall achieve a [[carbon-neutral footprint]].  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This may be accomplished by implementing innovative sustainable design strategies, generating on-site renewable power and/or purchasing a maximum of 20% renewable energy and/or certified renewable energy credits (RECs, [[Renewable Energy Certificate (United States)|Green tags]]).

==Development==
The series was first inspired to make a spy show but for Family and Kids also a series wanted something similar to Totally Spies! So Vincent Chalvon-Demersary and David Michel started the series, and the spiez diceded to relocate to Calgary, Alberta. The series was in production and build by production company [[Marathon Media]] and was also co production company [[Image Entertainment Corporation]] with in association and aired on [[TF1]] and [[Teletoon]]. The Funds were assistance from The Canadian Film or Video Production Tax credit, Quebec Film or Television production tax credit, Telefilm Canada and Bell Fund.

==Characters==
* '''Lee Clark''': Lee is the oldest at 13 and considered the strongest one. He is very athletic and the most powerful spy in the group. While his two brothers share funny and immature traits, Lee is part big brother/part father figure. Nothing is more important than his siblings that he would do anything to protect them.&lt;ref name="disneychannel-asia1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.disneychannel-asia.com/DisneyChannel/supersites/amazingspiez/ |title=The Amazing Spiez |publisher=Disney Channel Asia |date=2012-12-21 |accessdate=2013-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217083006/http://www.disneychannel-asia.com/DisneyChannel/supersites/amazingspiez/ |archivedate=2013-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His spy suit and his MPCom are red. He is also the jet pilot and is often shown to be claustrophobic. In addition, he has a habit of going crazy over girls, which is similar to Clover's boy-craziness. In his normal appearance, Lee has auburn colored hair that seems to be in the style of a flat top. He has pale blue (sometimes grey) eyes, wears a red short sleeved shirt with a white "W" on it, burgundy colored pants, red shoes, and a red and white wrist band. He is currently working part-time at a restaurant called Siber Smoothie. He is studying in the 8th grade. He is voiced by [[Andrew Sabiston]].
* '''Megan Clark''': Megan is an optimistic and high energy 12-year-old girl. She always hangs out with her brothers. She usually cracks up at jokes that are not funny at all. She often puns but always notes that her puns are not intended. She is often reminded by her brothers that she is 'just a girl', but this pushes her to be even more competitive.&lt;ref name="disneychannel-asia1"/&gt; Her spy suit and MPCom are pink. She sometimes switches places with Lee as the jet pilot. Megan is almost the spitting image of Alex from the original series, 'Totally Spies!'. She is in the seventh grade like Marc. Growing up with her 3 brothers made her develop a sort of tomboyish personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theamazingspiez.com/megan.html |title=The Series |publisher=The Amazing SpieZ |date= |accessdate=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her normal appearance, Megan has black hair that's swept up in the backside (almost like Alex's). She has green eyes and wears a pink hoodie that exposes her stomach, a pink skirt with white leggings, and pink shoes with fuchsia pink pom-poms on them. Her dark skin is probably from her aunt Trudy who is seen with a dark complexion and hair color from her father. On TV, she wears pink, and on the Internet (such as YouTube) she wears purple. Megan is the second oldest, She is voiced by [[Alyson Court]].
* '''Marc Clark''': Marc is the smartest one in the group at 12 - and WOOHP, as proven in episode WOOCSI-. Much like Sam, his intelligence is sometimes considered freaky by his siblings. He calls himself the 'Family Geek'. He has the knowledge of every single subject known to man, but 'like most geeks' cannot get a date. He likes to fiddle around with the gadgets and alter their functions.&lt;ref name="disneychannel-asia1"/&gt; His spy suit and his MPCom are blue. Sometimes he switches places with Lee or Megan as the jet pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theamazingspiez.com/marc.html |title=The Series |publisher=The Amazing SpieZ |date= |accessdate=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and Megan get along very well. In most episodes they are seen with an arm or an elbow around each other. In his normal appearance, Marc has short light brown hair in the normal style that a 12-year-old boy would have. He has hazel eyes and wears a blue hoodie with white sleeves, cargo pants, and blue shoes. He and Lee are the only two siblings that look like their mom - with the hair and skin tone. Marc is voiced by Peter Cugno.
* '''Tony Clark''': Tony is the youngest sibling of the Clark family who is 11 years old. Tony is a no-nonsense go-getter and very hyperactive boy. He is impatient and relies too much on intuition, and he doesn't like 'thinking', which sometimes leads the spies into deep trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theamazingspiez.com/tony.html |title=The Series |publisher=The Amazing SpieZ |date= |accessdate=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; His spy suit and MPCom are yellow and the Freezdiscs seem to be his favorite gadget. He shares a room with Marc. In his normal appearance, Tony, like Megan, has black hair that is swept up one way and down the other and also has green eyes. He wears a yellow long sleeve shirt under a blue jacket, blue pants, yellow shoes, and a grey belt. He and Megan are the only ones to look like Alex from Totally Spies! and to look like their dad - skin tone and hair style. He is in the 6th grade. He is voiced by [[Julie Lemieux]].
* '''Jerry''': [[List of Totally Spies! characters#Jerry|Jerry]] is the founder and administrator of WOOHP (World Organization of Human Protection). He is a middle-aged, and very serious British gentleman. He briefs the Spiez on their missions, distributes their gadgets, and provides mission support with information or direct involvement. He is often the butt of jokes when it comes to his absence of a full head of hair and his age. He is voiced by [[Adrian Truss]].
* '''Tami''': Tami is a popular 13-year-old girl in the Spiez' school. She's a rival to Megan. Sometimes she's a bit annoying and Megan hates her for being spoiled and snobby all the time. She has also seen Megan in full spy gear, but then her memory was erased by WOOHP. She is somewhat like Mandy from [[Totally Spies!]].  She is the only character that wears more than one outfit in the whole show, aside from Megan in some episodes. In "Operation: Evil Paparazzi", Tami is shown to have a crush on Lee, but the feelings are not returned. She is voiced by [[Sugar Lyn Beard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theamazingspiez.com/tammy.html |title=The Series |publisher=The Amazing SpieZ |date= |accessdate=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cal Clark''': The husband of Karen and the father of the Spiez. He is a former OOPSIE agent who beat Alpha and Omega (episode 22-24) with his partner and now wife, Karen. He has no idea his children are WOOHP agents. He owns a sports store and has a very healthy way of life. As the head of the Clark family, Cal wishes to instill his kids to follow a certain kind of discipline.&lt;ref name="disneychannel-asia1"/&gt; He is voiced by [[Dan Petronijevic]].
* '''Karen Clark''': The wife of Cal, the younger sister of Aunt Trudy, and the mother of the Spiez.  Karen is a former OOPSIE agent who, like her husband, has no idea her children are WOOHP agents. She is now a real estate agent, voiced by [[Liz Ramos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theamazingspiez.com/caletkaren.html |title=The Series |publisher=The Amazing SpieZ |date= |accessdate=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Butcher Boy''''' is a 1997 Irish-American [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] [[drama film]] [[Film adaptation|adapted]] to [[film]] by [[Neil Jordan]] and [[Patrick McCabe (novelist)|Patrick McCabe]] from McCabe's [[The Butcher Boy (novel)|1992 novel of the same name]].&lt;ref name="mov"&gt;{{cite magazine | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Wettbewerb/In Competition |magazine=[[Moving Pictures (magazine)|Moving Pictures]], Berlinale Extra | volume = | issue = | pages =14–16 | publisher = | location = Berlin | date = 11–22 February 1998 | url = | format = | issn = 0959-6992 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Set in the early 1960s, ''The Butcher Boy'' is about Francie Brady ([[Eamonn Owens]]), a 12-year-old boy who retreats into a violent fantasy world to escape the reality of his dysfunctional family; as his circumstances worsen, his sanity deteriorates and he begins acting out, with increasing brutality. The film won the [[Silver Bear for Best Director]] at the [[48th Berlin International Film Festival]] in 1998 and a Special Mention for Owens "astonishing lead". It also won the [[European Film Award]] for Best Cinematographer for [[Adrian Biddle]]. ''The Butcher Boy'' is Neil Jordan's tenth feature film and [[Geffen Pictures]]' final production.

==Plot==
The film is set in Ireland in the early 1960s in the small town of [[Clones, County Monaghan|Clones]]. Francie Brady is a 12-year-old boy whose imagination is fuelled by [[television]] - [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], [[Communism|communists]], the [[Atomic Age]].&lt;ref name=industry&gt;{{cite web | last = Byrne | first = Paul | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Neil Jordan (The Butcher Boy): The Provocative Son | work = | publisher = industrycentral.net | date = 7 December 1999 | url = http://www.industrycentral.net/director_interviews/NJ01.HTM | doi = | accessdate = 30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When his mother suffers a [[nervous breakdown]] and ultimately commits suicide, he is left in the care of his father, an emotionally distant and ill-tempered [[alcoholic]]. Francie spends most of his time with his best friend Joe Purcell talking about "gangsters, cowboys and Indians, [[Comic book|comic-book]] monsters and the early-1960s threat of [[Doomsday device|nuclear annihilation]]."&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite web | last = O'Hehir | first = Andrew | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Butcher Boy | work = | publisher = Salon Entertainment | date = 10 April 1998 | url = http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/1998/04/10butcher.html | doi = | accessdate = 30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Francie's growing conflict with another boy, Phillip Nugent, and his mother begins to go too far, he ends up at [[reform school]]. Here, he is [[child molestation|molested]] by Father Sullivan, and finds solace only in his fantasies about a foul-mouthed [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]]. He returns home to find Joe has outgrown him and befriended Phillip Nugent. Before long, his father has drunk himself to death. Faced with being left completely alone in the world, Francie loses his grip on reality and lashes out with uncontrollable brutality, which shocks his provincial hometown.&lt;ref name="mov"/&gt;

==Cast==
* [[Eamonn Owens]] as Francie Brady
* [[Stephen Rea]] as Benny Brady (Da) / Adult Francie (uncredited)
* [[Fiona Shaw]] as Mrs. Nugent
* Andrew Fullerton as Phillip Nugent
* [[Aisling O'Sullivan]] as Annie Brady (Ma)
* Alan Boyle as Joe Purcell
* [[Seán McGinley]] as Sergeant
* [[Ian Hart]] as Uncle Alo
* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Father Bubbles
* [[Milo O'Shea]] as Father Sullivan
* [[Sinéad O'Connor]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] / Colleen
* Gina Moxley as Mary
* [[John Kavanagh (actor)|John Kavanagh]] as Doctor Boyd
* [[Niall Buggy]] as Father Dom

==Production==
This was the final film produced by [[Geffen Pictures]], which distributed its films through [[Warner Bros.]] Geffen Pictures would be sold to [[Universal Studios]] years later.

The screen rights to the book were bought by [[Neil Jordan]] in 1992 during the filming of ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]''.&lt;ref name=industry/&gt; The [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] is mostly faithful to the novel, but there are some differences, the principal change being the ending. In the book, Francie is not seen to leave prison, and attempts to forge a friendship with an inmate similar to the one he had with Joe. In the film, a much older Francie is released from prison at the end to be brought to a [[halfway house]]. He picks a [[snowdrop]], echoing the opening of the film.

[[Casting (performing arts)|Casting]] the child to play Francie was difficult. With no previous filming experiences, Eamonn Owens and Alan Boyle (who played Francie's best friend, Joe) were found at the local school in [[Killeshandra]] in [[County Cavan]] where casting assistant Maureen Hughes went to visit her uncle. Owens younger brother Ciaran was also cast. Jordan cast O'Connor  because "she looks like the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]]."&lt;ref name=industry/&gt;

==Adaptation==
[[Patrick McCabe (novelist)|Patrick McCabe]]'s accomplishment with ''[[The Butcher Boy (novel)|The Butcher Boy]]'' was deemed unattainable in a film.&lt;ref name=industry/&gt;&lt;ref name=salon/&gt; During the [[screenwriting]] process, author McCabe wrote two drafts that digressed from the original novel, like "planets within planets within planets" according to Neil Jordan, consequently, Jordan wrote the third draft that was more faithful to the novel.&lt;ref name=industry/&gt; Jordan cast McCabe in the role of town drunk Jimmy the Skite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McKella|first=Barbara|title=Neil Jordan ponders The Butcher Boy|url=https://barbaramackellar.wordpress.com/2012/05/28/neil-jordan-ponders-the-butcher-boy|work=Celtic Curmudgeon Arts &amp; Entertainment Review|accessdate=20 September 2016|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neil Jordan captures Francie's [[schizophrenia]] by using [[voice-over]]s where the adult narrator Francie speaks with the child Francie. Andrew O'Hehir at Salon Entertainment criticizes Jordan and McCabe for an occasional "flavor of an after-school special purveying [[didactic]] lessons about [[physical abuse|abuse]] and victimization," and losing "the novel's [[Samuel Beckett|Beckettian]] ambiguity." However, he argues that Jordan "brings a tenderness and sweetness" to the otherwise unforgiving [[wikt:subject-matter|subject matter]].&lt;ref name=salon/&gt;

==Reception==
The reception of the film has been generally good. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] shows a 77% rating based on 61 reviews and an average rating of 7.4/10.&lt;ref name=rotten/&gt; Andrew O'Hehir at Salon Entertainment says "Neil Jordan's sweetly tragicomic movie" has "elaborate [[fantasy]] sequences [that] feel like irrelevant amusements." He also praises the film as "a compelling exploration of the permeable border between normal childhood and full-on [[insanity]]."&lt;ref name=salon/&gt;
Jeffrey M. Anderson at Combustible Celluloid calls the film "a roller-coaster ride for your brain. It's the most alive and deeply-felt movie I've seen in 1998."&lt;ref name=comb&gt;{{cite web | last = M. Anderson | first = Jeffrey | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Butcher Boy (1998): Off to the Garage | work = | publisher = Combustible Celluloid | date = 12 October 1998 | url = http://www.combustiblecelluloid.com/butcherboy.shtml | doi = | accessdate = 30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emanuel Levy]] at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' says it is "Neil Jordan's most accomplished and brilliant film to date."&lt;ref name="rotten"&gt;{{cite web|title = The Butcher Boy (1998)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/butcher_boy/ |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owens performance was hailed unanimously; as such, he was awarded a Special Mention at the [[Berlin Film Festival]] in 1998.

The cumulative [[box office]] according to ''Variety'' is $1,963,654.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;

It aimed to mobilise the [[Irish diaspora]] to return to Ireland during 2013 to be part of specially organised local gatherings and events during the year. It was a [[Government of Ireland|government]] supported initiative driven primarily by [[Fáilte Ireland]], the National Tourism Development Authority, and [[Tourism Ireland]]. The concept relied on [[grassroots]] initiatives of private individuals, and non-governmental organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/roots/Top-ten-events-to-check-out-for-Irelands-The-Gathering-2013-155905675.html
 |title=&gt; Top Ten Events To Check Out For The Gathering |publisher=IrishCentral.com |date=2012-05-31 |accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gathering was not a single event but provided an umbrella framework for varied activities throughout 2013, from family reunions and clan gatherings to sports fixtures. While the initiative was primarily directed at the Irish diaspora, and those with other links to the country, the organisers hoped the experience for the general tourist would also be enhanced.

It began on 1 January 2013 and ended on 31 December 2013.

==Background==
The concept for The Gathering Ireland 2013 first emerged at the 2009 [[Global Irish Economic Forum]] held in [[Farmleigh]], [[Dublin]]. The Forum had two broad objectives: to examine ways in which the Republic could develop more strategic relationships with its diaspora; and to provide a platform for those living overseas who claim Irish ancestry to contribute to the Republic’s economic recovery. The Gathering Ireland 2013 was seen as an opportunity to address both of these objectives, the latter achieved through additional overseas visitors and tourism revenue which in turn may stimulate job creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0512/1224315982871.html |title=&gt; Gathering to Promote Ireland All Next Year |publisher=IrishTimes.com |date=2012-05-12 |accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The initiative has been publicly criticised by entrepreneur [[Michael O'Leary (businessman)|Michael O'Leary]] and actor [[Gabriel Byrne]]. In a broad criticism of fiscal policy at a Dublin conference, O'Leary referred to the initiative as "The Grabbing", though he went on to say “We like, actually, the Gathering. I thought it wasn’t a bad idea. There’s no reason not to welcome everyone back to Ireland". 
Byrne, who previously served as a cultural ambassador for Ireland, said many Irish emigrants in US felt abandoned by the Government and described the initiative as "a scam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/1106/the-gathering-gabriel-byrne.html|title= Actor Gabriel Byrne labels The Gathering a 'scam'|date=6 November 2012|work=RTÉ News|accessdate=16 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/ryanair-boss-michael-oleary-lashes-out-at-aviation-conference-3315291.html|title= Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary lashes out at aviation conference|date=3 December 2012|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=16 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Picture of Dorian Gray''''' is a [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] and [[philosophical fiction|philosophical novel]] by [[Oscar Wilde]], first published complete in the July 1890 issue of ''[[Lippincott's Monthly Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="Penguin Intro pg ix"&gt;''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (Penguin Classics) – Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | last = McCrum | first = Robert | title =The 100 best novels: No 27 – The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (1891) | work =[[The Guardian]]| date = March 24, 2014 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/24/100-best-novels-picture-dorian-gray-oscar-wilde | accessdate = 2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing the story was indecent, the magazine's editor without Wilde's knowledge deleted roughly five hundred words before publication. Despite that censorship, ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers, some of whom said that Oscar Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding the public morality. In response, Wilde aggressively defended his novel and art in correspondence with the British press, although he personally made excisions of some of the most controversial material when revising and lengthening the story for book publication the following year.

The longer and revised version of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' published in book form in 1891 featured an [[Aphorism|aphoristic]] preface—a defence of the artist's rights and of art for art's sake—based in part on his press defences of the novel the previous year. The content, style, and presentation of the preface made it famous in its own right, as a literary and artistic manifesto. In April 1891, the publishing firm of Ward, Lock and Company, who had distributed the shorter, more inflammatory, magazine version in England the previous year, published the revised version of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray''.&lt;ref name="Publish"&gt;[http://www.turksheadreview.com/library/notes-doriangray.html Notes on The Picture of Dorian Gray] – An overview of the text, sources, influences, themes, and a summary of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray''&lt;/ref&gt;

The only novel written by Wilde, ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' exists in several versions: the 1890 magazine edition (in 13 chapters), with important material deleted before publication by the magazine's editor, J. M. Stoddart; the "uncensored" version submitted to ''Lippincott's Monthly Magazine'' for publication (also in 13 chapters), with all of Wilde's original material intact, first published in 2011 by Harvard University Press; and the 1891 book edition (in 20 chapters).&lt;ref&gt;[http://withgoodreasonradio.org/2012/07/the-censorship-of-dorian-gray-With Good Reason radio show, "The Censorship of 'Dorian Gray' "]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As literature of the 19th century, ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' "pivots on a gothic plot device" with strong [[#Themes and motifs|themes]] interpreted from ''[[Faust]]''.&lt;ref name="gothhorror"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ghost and Horror Fiction |website=GLBTQ Encyclopedia |publisher=glbtq, Inc |location=Chicago, IL |date=2002–2006 |archive-url=https://archive.fo/20130102232629/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/ghost_horror.html |archive-date=2 January 2013 |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/ghost_horror.html |access-date=2017-08-23 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[Dorian Gray (character)|Dorian Gray]] is the subject of a full-length portrait in oil by Basil Hallward, an artist who is impressed and infatuated by Dorian's [[Aesthetics|beauty]]; he believes that Dorian's beauty is responsible for the new mood in his art as a painter. Through Basil, Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, and he soon is enthralled by the aristocrat's [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] world view: that beauty and sensual fulfilment are the only things worth pursuing in life.

Newly understanding that his beauty will fade, Dorian expresses the desire to sell his soul, to ensure that the picture, rather than he, will age and fade. The wish is granted, and Dorian pursues a [[libertine]] life of varied and amoral experiences, while staying young and beautiful; all the while his portrait ages and records every sin.&lt;ref name="gutenberg_20_1"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/174 The Picture of Dorian Gray] (Project Gutenberg 20-chapter version), line 3479 et seq. in plain text (Chapter VII).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' begins on a beautiful summer day in [[Victorian era]] England, where Lord Henry Wotton, an opinionated man, is observing the sensitive artist Basil Hallward painting the portrait of Dorian Gray, a handsome young man who is Basil's ultimate [[muse]]. While sitting for the painting, Dorian listens to Lord Henry espousing his [[hedonistic]] world view, and begins to think that [[Aesthetics|beauty]] is the only aspect of life worth pursuing. This prompts Dorian to wish that the painted image of himself would age instead of himself.

Under the hedonistic influence of Lord Henry, Dorian fully explores his sensuality. He discovers the actress Sibyl Vane, who performs [[Shakespeare]] plays in a dingy, working-class theatre. Dorian approaches and courts her, and soon proposes marriage. The enamoured Sibyl calls him "Prince Charming", and swoons with the happiness of being loved, but her protective brother, James, warns that if "Prince Charming" harms her, he will murder him.

Dorian invites Basil and Lord Henry to see Sibyl perform in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. Sibyl, too enamoured with Dorian to act, performs poorly, which makes both Basil and Lord Henry think Dorian has fallen in love with Sibyl because of her beauty instead of her acting talent. Embarrassed, Dorian rejects Sibyl, telling her that acting was her beauty; without that, she no longer interests him. On returning home, Dorian notices that the portrait has changed; his wish has come true, and the man in the portrait bears a subtle sneer of cruelty.

[[File:Doriangray 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Dorian Gray observes the corruption recorded in his portrait, in the film ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945 film)|The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1945).]]

Conscience-stricken and lonely, Dorian decides to reconcile with Sibyl, but he is too late, as Lord Henry informs him that Sibyl has killed herself. Dorian then understands that, where his life is headed, lust and beauty shall suffice. Dorian locks the portrait up, and over the following eighteen years, he experiments with every vice, influenced by a morally poisonous French novel that Lord Henry Wotton gave him.

One night, before leaving for Paris, Basil goes to Dorian's house to ask him about rumours of his self-indulgent [[sensualism]]. Dorian does not deny his debauchery, and takes Basil to see the portrait. The portrait has become so hideous that Basil is only able to identify it as his work by the signature he affixes to all his portraits. Basil is horrified, and beseeches Dorian to pray for salvation. In anger, Dorian blames his fate on Basil, and stabs him to death. Dorian then calmly blackmails an old friend, the scientist Alan Campbell, into using his knowledge of chemistry to destroy the body of Basil Hallward. Alan later kills himself over the deed.

[[File:Opium smoking 1874.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A 19th century London opium den (based on fictional accounts of the day).]]

To escape the guilt of his crime, Dorian goes to an [[opium den]], where James Vane is unknowingly present. James had been seeking vengeance upon Dorian ever since Sibyl killed herself, but had no leads to pursue: the only thing he knew about Dorian was the name Sibyl called him, "Prince Charming". In the opium den however he hears someone refer to Dorian as "Prince Charming", and he accosts Dorian. Dorian deceives James into believing that he is too young to have known Sibyl, who killed herself 18 years earlier, as his face is still that of a young man. James relents and releases Dorian, but is then approached by a woman from the opium den who reproaches James for not killing Dorian. She confirms that the man was Dorian Gray and explains that he has not aged in 18 years. James runs after Dorian, but he has gone.

James then begins to stalk Dorian, causing Dorian to fear for his life. However, during a shooting party, a hunter accidentally kills James Vane, who was lurking in a thicket. On returning to London, Dorian tells Lord Henry that he will live righteously from now on. His new probity begins with deliberately not breaking the heart of the naïve Hetty Merton, his current romantic interest. Dorian wonders if his new-found goodness has reverted the corruption in the picture, but when he looks he sees only an even uglier image of himself. From that, Dorian understands that his true motives for the self-sacrifice of moral reformation were the vanity and curiosity of his quest for new experiences, along with the desire to restore beauty to the picture.

Deciding that only full [[Confession (religion)|confession]] will [[absolve]] him of wrongdoing, Dorian decides to destroy the last vestige of his conscience, and the only piece of evidence remaining of his crimes—the picture. In a rage, he takes the knife with which he murdered Basil Hallward, and stabs the picture. The servants of the house awaken on hearing a cry from the locked room; on the street, passers-by who also heard the cry call the police. On entering the locked room, the servants find an unknown old man, stabbed in the heart, his face and figure withered and decrepit. The servants identify the disfigured corpse by the rings on its fingers which belonged to their master, Dorian Gray. Beside him, the portrait is now restored to its former appearance of beauty.

==Characters==
[[Oscar Wilde]] said that, in the novel ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1891), three of the characters were [[alter ego|reflections]] of himself:

{{quotation|Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks of me: Dorian is what I would like to be—in other ages, perhaps.&lt;ref name="The Modern Library Gray"&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780553901672 The Modern Library] – a synopsis of the novel coupled with a short biography of Oscar Wilde. (retrieved 3 November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Doriangray.jpg|thumb|275px|The painter Basil Hallward and the aristocrat Lord Henry Wotton observe the picture of Dorian Gray.]]

;The characters of the story are
* '''[[Dorian Gray (character)|Dorian Gray]]''' – a handsome, [[narcissistic]] young man enthralled by Lord Henry's "new" [[hedonism]]. He indulges in every pleasure and virtually every 'sin', studying its effect upon him, which eventually leads to his death.
* '''Basil Hallward''' – a deeply moral man, the painter of the portrait, and infatuated with Dorian, whose patronage realises his potential as an artist. The picture of Dorian Gray is Basil's masterpiece.
* '''Lord Henry "Harry" Wotton''' – an imperious [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]] and a decadent [[dandy]] who espouses a philosophy of self-indulgent hedonism. Initially Basil's friend, he neglects him for Dorian's beauty. The character of witty Lord Harry is a [[Cultural criticism|critique]] of [[Victorian era#Culture|Victorian culture]] at the ''[[Fin de siècle]]'' – of Britain at the end of the 19th century. Lord Harry's [[Libertinism|libertine]] world view corrupts Dorian, who then successfully emulates him. To the aristocrat Harry, the observant artist Basil says, "You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing."  Lord Henry takes pleasure in impressing, influencing, and even misleading his acquaintances (to which purpose he bends his considerable wit and eloquence) but appears not to observe his own hedonistic advice, preferring to study himself with scientific detachment.  His distinguishing feature is total indifference to the consequences of his actions. Scholars generally accept the character is partly inspired by Wilde's friend [[Lord Ronald Gower]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, Oscar; Frankel, Nichols (ed.) ''The Picture of Dorian Gray: An Annotated, Uncensored Edition'' The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, London 2011, p68&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sibyl Vane''' – a talented actress and singer, she is the beautiful girl, of a poor family, with whom Dorian falls in love. Her love for Dorian ruins her acting ability, because she no longer finds pleasure in portraying fictional love as she is now experiencing real love in her life. She kills herself on learning that Dorian no longer loves her; at that, Lord Henry likens her to [[Ophelia]], in ''Hamlet''.
* '''James Vane''' – Sibyl's brother, a sailor who leaves for Australia. He is very protective of his sister, especially as their mother cares only for Dorian's money. Believing that Dorian means to harm Sibyl, James hesitates to leave, and promises vengeance upon Dorian if any harm befalls her. After Sibyl's suicide, James becomes obsessed with killing Dorian, and [[Stalking|stalks]] him, but a hunter accidentally kills James. The brother's pursuit of vengeance upon the lover (Dorian Gray), for the death of the sister (Sibyl) parallels that of [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]] vengeance against Prince Hamlet.
* '''Alan Campbell''' – chemist and one-time friend of Dorian who ended their friendship when Dorian's libertine reputation devalued such a friendship. Dorian blackmails Alan into destroying the body of the murdered Basil Hallward; Campbell later shoots himself dead.
* '''Lord Fermor''' – Lord Henry's uncle, who tells his nephew, Lord Henry Wotton, about the family [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]] of Dorian Gray.
* '''Adrian Singleton''' – A youthful friend of Dorian's, whom he evidently introduced to opium addiction, which induced him to forge a cheque and made him a total outcast from his family and social set.
* '''Victoria, Lady Henry Wotton''' – Lord Henry's wife, whom he treats disdainfully; she later divorces him.

==Themes and motifs==

===Aestheticism and duplicity===
The main theme in ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1891) is [[aestheticism]] and its conceptual relation to living a [[double life]]. Throughout the story, the narrative presents aestheticism as an absurd abstraction, which disillusions more than it dignifies the concept of Beauty. Despite Dorian being a hedonist, when Basil accuses him of making a "by-word" of the name of Lord Henry's sister, Dorian curtly replies, "Take care, Basil. You go too far ..."; thus, in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] society, public image and social standing do matter to Dorian.&lt;ref name="DorianGray Chapter XI"&gt;''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (Penguin Classics) – Chapter XI&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, Wilde highlights the protagonist's hedonism: Dorian enjoyed "keenly the terrible pleasure of a double life", by attending a high-society party only twenty-four hours after committing a murder.&lt;ref name="DorianGray Chapter XI"/&gt;

Moral duplicity and self-indulgence are evident in Dorian's patronage of London's opium dens. Wilde conflates the images of the upper-class man and lower-class man in Dorian Gray, a gentleman slumming for strong entertainment in the poor parts of London town. Lord Henry philosophically had earlier said to him that: "Crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders. ... I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us, simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations"—implying that Dorian is two men, a refined aesthete and a coarse criminal. That authorial observation is a thematic link to the double life recounted in ''[[The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' (1886), by Robert Louis Stevenson, a novella admired by Oscar Wilde.&lt;ref name="Penguin Intro pg ix" /&gt;

==Allusions==

===''The Republic''===
In Book 2 of [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Glaucon and Adeimantus present the myth of the [[Ring of Gyges]], by means of which Gyges made himself invisible. They then ask [[Socrates]], "If one came into possession of such a ring, why should he act justly?" Socrates replies that although no one can see one's body, the soul is disfigured by the evils one commits. The disfigured and corrupted soul (antithesis of the beautiful soul) is imbalanced and disordered, and, in itself, is undesirable, regardless of any advantage derived from acting unjustly. The picture of Dorian Gray is the means by which other people, such as his friend Basil Hallward, may see Dorian's distorted soul.

===''Tannhäuser''===
Dorian attends a performance of [[Tannhäuser (opera)|''Tannhäuser'']], by [[Richard Wagner]], and the narrative identifies him with the protagonist of the opera. Disruptive beauty is the thematic resemblance between the opera and ''The Picture of Dorian Gray''. Based upon a medieval historical figure, Tannhäuser is a singer whose art is so beautiful that [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] becomes enamoured of him. The Roman goddess of love then offers him eternal life with her in the Venusberg, and he accepts; yet, Tannhäuser becomes dissatisfied with life in the Venusberg, and returns to the harsh reality of the mortal world. After participating in a singing contest, Tannhäuser is censured for the sensuality of his art; eventually, he dies searching for repentance and the love of a good woman.

===''Faust''===
About the literary hero, the author Oscar Wilde said, "in every first novel the hero is the author as Christ or [[Faust]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s8klNRZBYBAC&amp;pg=PT21&amp;dq=%22in+every+first+novel+the+hero+is+the+author+as+Christ+or+Faust.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FJXjTeKTKYzB8QPV4r3rBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22in%20every%20first%20novel%20the%20hero%20is%20the%20author%20as%20Christ%20or%20Faust.%22&amp;f=false |title=The Picture of Dorian Gray |publisher=Magnum Books |date=1969 |author=Oscar Wilde |accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in the legend of ''Faust'', in ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' a temptation (ageless beauty) is placed before the protagonist, which he indulges. In each story, the protagonist entices a beautiful woman to love him, and then destroys her life. In the preface to the novel (1891), Wilde said that the notion behind the tale is "old in the history of literature", but was a thematic subject to which he had "given a new form".&lt;ref name="DorianGray Preface"&gt;''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (Penguin Classics) – Preface&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the academic ''Faust'', the gentleman Dorian makes no [[deal with the Devil]], who is represented by the cynical hedonist Lord Henry, who presents the temptation that will corrupt the [[virtue]] and innocence that Dorian possesses at the start of the story. Throughout, Lord Henry appears unaware of the effect of his actions upon the young man; and so frivolously advises Dorian, that "the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing."&lt;ref name="DorianGray Chapter II"&gt;''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (Penguin Classics) – Chapter II&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the devilish Lord Henry is "leading Dorian into an unholy pact, by manipulating his innocence and insecurity."&lt;ref name="Devil's Advocate"&gt;[http://education.yahoo.com/homework_help/cliffsnotes/the_picture_of_dorian_gray/10.html The Picture of Dorian Gray] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207212634/http://education.yahoo.com/homework_help/cliffsnotes/the_picture_of_dorian_gray/10.html |date=7 February 2009 }} – a summary of and a commentary on Chapter II of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (retrieved 29 July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shakespeare===
In the preface to ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1891), Wilde speaks of the sub-human [[Caliban]] character from ''[[The Tempest]]''. In chapter five, he writes: "He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban". When Dorian tells Lord Henry about his new love Sibyl Vane, he mentions the Shakespeare plays in which she has acted, and refers to her by the name of the heroine of each play. Later, Dorian speaks of his life by quoting [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]], a privileged character who impels his potential suitor ([[Ophelia]]) to suicide, and prompts her brother (Laertes) to swear mortal revenge.

===Joris-Karl Huysmans===
The anonymous "poisonous French novel" that leads Dorian to his fall is a thematic variant of ''[[À rebours]]'' (1884), by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]. In the biography, ''Oscar Wilde'' (1989), the literary critic [[Richard Ellmann]] said that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Wilde does not name the book, but at his trial he conceded that it was, or almost [was], Huysmans's ''À rebours'' ... to a correspondent, he wrote that he had played a 'fantastic variation' upon ''À rebours'', and someday must write it down. The references in ''Dorian Gray'' to specific chapters are deliberately inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann, ''Oscar Wilde'' (Vintage, 1988), p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Literary significance==

===Possible Disraeli influence===

Some commentaters have suggested that ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' was influenced by the British Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]]'s (anonymously published) first novel ''[[Vivian Grey]]'' (1826) as, "a kind of homage from one outsider to another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCrum|first1=Robert|title=The 100 best novels: No 11 – Sybil by Benjamin Disraeli (1845)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/02/sybil-benjamin-disraeli-100-best-novels|website=theguardian.com|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of Dorian Gray's love interest, Sibyl Vane, may be a modified fusion of the title of Disraeli's best known novel ([[Sybil (novel)|''Sybil'']]) and Vivian Grey's love interest Violet Fane, who, like Sibyl Vane, dies tragically.&lt;ref name="Disraeli (1853)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Disraeli|first1=Benjamin|title=Vivian Grey|date=1826|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co|location=London|pages=263–5|edition=1853 version}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a scene in ''Vivian Grey'' in which the eyes in the portrait of a "beautiful being" move when its subject dies.&lt;ref&gt;Disraeli (1853) p101-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication history===
''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' originally was a [[novella]] submitted to ''[[Lippincott's Monthly Magazine]]'' for serial publication. In 1889, J. M. Stoddart, an editor for Lippincott, was in London to solicit novellas to publish in the magazine. On 30 August 1889, Stoddart dined with Oscar Wilde, [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[T. P. Gill]]&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Wilde, ''Selected Letters'' ed Hart-Davis, R Oxford University Press, 1979, p95&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Langham Hotel, London|Langham Hotel]], and commissioned novellas from each writer.&lt;ref name="FrankelIntro"&gt;{{cite book |last=Frankel |first=Nicholas |editor1-first=Oscar |editor1-last=Wilde |editor1-link=Oscar Wilde |title=The Picture of Dorian Gray: An Annotated, Uncensored Edition |year=2011 |origyear=1890 |publisher=Belknap Press ([[Harvard University Press]]) |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |isbn=978-0-674-05792-0 |pages=38–64 |chapter=Textual Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conan Doyle promptly submitted ''[[The Sign of the Four]]'' (1890) to Stoddart, but Wilde was more dilatory; Conan Doyle's second Sherlock Holmes novel was published in the February 1890 edition of ''Lippincott's Monthly Magazine'', yet Stoddart did not receive Wilde's manuscript for ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' until 7 April 1890, nine months after having commissioned the novel from him.&lt;ref name="FrankelIntro" /&gt;

[[File:The title card of an 1891 print of The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde.png|thumb|right|230px|The [[title page]] of the [[Ward Lock &amp; Co]] 1891 edition of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' with decorative lettering, designed by [[Charles Ricketts]].]]
The literary merits of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' impressed Stoddart, but, as an editor, he told the publisher, George Lippincott, "in its present condition there are a number of things an innocent woman would make an exception to. ..."&lt;ref name="FrankelIntro" /&gt; Among the pre-publication deletions that Stoddart and his editors made to the text of Wilde's original manuscript were: (i) passages alluding to homosexuality and to homosexual desire; (ii) all references to the fictional book title ''Le Secret de Raoul'' and its author, Catulle Sarrazin; and (iii) all "mistress" references to Gray's lovers, Sibyl Vane and Hetty Merton.&lt;ref name="FrankelIntro" /&gt;

''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' was published on 20 June 1890, in the July issue of ''Lippincott's Monthly Magazine''. British reviewers condemned the novel's immorality, and said condemnation was so controversial that the [[W H Smith]] publishing house withdrew every copy of the July 1890 issue of ''Lippincott's Monthly Magazine'' from its bookstalls in railway stations.&lt;ref name="FrankelIntro" /&gt;
Consequent to the harsh criticism of the 1890 magazine edition, Wilde ameliorated the [[homoerotic]] references, to simplify the moral message of the story.&lt;ref name="FrankelIntro" /&gt; In the magazine edition (1890), Basil tells Lord Henry how he "worships" Dorian, and begs him not to "take away the one person that makes my life absolutely lovely to me." In the magazine edition, Basil concentrates upon love, whereas, in the book edition (1891), Basil concentrates upon his art, saying to Lord Henry, "the one person who gives my art whatever charm it may possess: my life as an artist depends on him."

The magazine edition of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1890) was expanded from thirteen to twenty chapters; and the magazine edition’s final chapter was divided into two chapters, the nineteenth and twentieth chapters of the book edition of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1891). Wilde's textual additions were about "fleshing out of Dorian as a character" and providing details of his ancestry that made his "psychological collapse more prolonged and more convincing."&lt;ref name="DorianGray ANoteOnTheText"&gt;''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (Penguin Classics) – A Note on the Text&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the James Vane character to the story develops the socio-economic background of the Sibyl Vane character, thus emphasising Dorian's selfishness and foreshadowing James's accurate perception of the essentially immoral character of Dorian Gray; thus, he correctly deduced Dorian’s dishonourable intent towards Sibyl. The sub-plot about James Vane's dislike of Dorian gives the novel a Victorian tinge of class struggle. With such textual changes, Oscar Wilde meant to diminish the moralistic controversy about the novel ''The Picture of Dorian Gray''.

===Preface===
Consequent to the harsh criticism of the magazine edition of the novel, the textual revisions to ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' included a preface in which Wilde addressed the criticisms and defended the reputation of his novel.&lt;ref name="Preface Quote"&gt;[http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/titles/dorian/section2.html GraderSave: ClassicNote] – a summary and analysis of the book and its preface (retrieved 5 July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; To communicate how the novel should be read, in the Preface, Wilde explains the role of the artist in society, the purpose of art, and the value of beauty. It traces Wilde's cultural exposure to [[Taoism]] and to the philosophy of Chuang Tsǔ ([[Zhuang Zhou]]). Earlier, before writing the preface, Wilde had written a book review of [[Herbert Giles]]'s translation of the work of Zhuang Zhou. The preface was first published in the 1891 edition of the novel; nonetheless, by June 1891, Wilde was defending ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' against accusations that it was a bad book.&lt;ref&gt;''The Letters of Oscar Wilde'', Merlin Holland and Rupert Hart-Davis, eds., Henry Holt (2000), {{ISBN|0-8050-5915-6}}; and ''The Artist as Critic'', Richard Ellmann, ed., University of Chicago (1968), {{ISBN|0-226-89764-8}} – containing Wilde's book review of Giles's translation, and Chuang Tsǔ (Zhuang Zhou) is incorrectly identified as [[Confucius]]. Wilde's book review of Giles's translation was published in ''The Speaker'' magazine of 8 February 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the essay ''The Artist as Critic'', Oscar Wilde said that:

{{quotation|The honest ratepayer and his healthy family have no doubt often mocked at the dome-like forehead of the philosopher, and laughed over the strange perspective of the landscape that lies beneath him. If they really knew who he was, they would tremble. For Chuang Tsǔ spent his life in preaching the great creed of Inaction, and in pointing out the uselessness of all things.&lt;ref name="Artist as Critic 222"&gt;Ellmann, ''The Artist as Critic'' p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Criticism===
In the 19th century, the critical reception of the novel ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1890) was poor. The book critic of ''The Irish Times'' said, ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' was "first published to some scandal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Battersby |first=Eileen |title=Wilde's Portrait of Subtle Control |newspaper=Irish Times |date=7 April 2010 |url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?hid=111&amp;sid=854409f9-be37-4c57-9f99-5ca010d27ef7%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=4&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=n5h&amp;AN=9FY4146686689 |accessdate=9 March 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such book reviews achieved for the novel a "certain notoriety for being 'mawkish and nauseous', 'unclean', 'effeminate' and 'contaminating'."&lt;ref name="The Modern Library"&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780679642091 The Modern Library] – a synopsis of the novel and a short biography of Oscar Wilde. (retrieved 6 July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[Moralism|moralistic]] scandal arose from the novel's [[homoeroticism]], which offended the sensibilities (social, literary, and aesthetic) of Victorian book critics. Yet, most of the criticism was personal, attacking Wilde for being a hedonist with a distorted view of conventional morality of Victorian Britain. In the 30 June 1890 issue of the ''[[Daily Chronicle (United Kingdom)|Daily Chronicle]]'', the book critic said that Wilde's novel contains "one element ... which will taint every young mind that comes in contact with it." In the 5 July 1890 issue of the ''[[Scots Observer]]'', a reviewer asked "Why must Oscar Wilde 'go grubbing in muck-heaps?'" In response to such criticism, Wilde obscured the homoeroticism of the story and expanded the personal background of the characters.&lt;ref name="Addition"&gt;[http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/id-144,pageNum-2.html CliffsNotes:The Picture of Dorian Gray] – an introduction and overview the book (retrieved 5 July 2006) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319200835/http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/id-144,pageNum-2.html |date=19 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Textual revisions===
After the initial publication of the magazine edition of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1890), Wilde expanded the text from 13 to 20 chapters and obscured the [[homoerotic]] themes of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=listverse.com| url=http://listverse.com/2013/01/14/deleted-book-chapters/|date=14 January 2013| title=10 Deleted Chapters that Transformed Famous Books|author=Symon, Evan V.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel version of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1891), chapters 3, 5, and 15 to 18, inclusive, are new; and chapter 13 of the magazine edition was divided, and became chapters 19 and 20 of the novel edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://mdoege.github.io/Dorian_Gray_diff/ |title=Differences between the 1890 and 1891 editions of "Dorian Gray" |publisher=Github.io |date= |accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, at his [[Oscar Wilde#Trials|trials]], Oscar Wilde said he revised the text of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' because of letters sent to him by the cultural critic [[Walter Pater]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawler, Donald L., ''An Inquiry into Oscar Wilde's Revisions of 'The Picture of Dorian Gray{{'}}'' (New York: Garland, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Passages revised for the novel'''
* (Basil about Dorian) "He has stood as Paris in dainty armour, and as Adonis with huntsman's cloak and polished boar-spear. Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms, he has sat on the prow of Adrian's barge, looking into the green, turbid Nile. He has leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland, and seen in the water's silent silver the wonder of his own beauty."
* (Lord Henry describes "fidelity") "It has nothing to do with our own will. It is either an unfortunate accident, or an unpleasant result of temperament."
* "You don't mean to say that Basil has got any passion or any romance in him?" / "I don't know whether he has any passion, but he certainly has romance," said Lord Henry, with an amused look in his eyes. / "Has he never let you know that?" / "Never. I must ask him about it. I am rather surprised to hear it."
* (Basil Hallward described) "Rugged and straightforward as he was, there was something in his nature that was purely feminine in its tenderness."
* (Basil to Dorian) "It is quite true that I have worshipped you with far more romance of feeling than a man usually gives to a friend. Somehow, I had never loved a woman. I suppose I never had time. Perhaps, as Harry says, a really ''grande passion'' is the privilege of those who have nothing to do, and that is the use of the idle classes in a country."
* (Basil confronts Dorian) "Dorian, Dorian, your reputation is infamous. I know you and Harry are great friends. I say nothing about that now, but surely you need not have made his sister's name a by-word." (The first part of this passage was deleted from the 1890 magazine text; the second part of the passage was inserted to the 1891 novel text.)

'''Passages added to the novel'''
* "Each class would have preached the importance of those virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives. The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity of labour."
* "A ''grande passion'' is the privilege of people who have nothing to do. That is the one use of the idle classes of a country. Don't be afraid."
* "Faithfulness! I must analyse it some day. The passion for property is in it. There are many things that we would throw away, if we were not afraid that others might pick them up."

'''The uncensored edition'''

In 2011, the Belknap Press published ''The Picture of Dorian Gray: An Annotated, Uncensored Edition''. The edition includes text that was deleted by JM Stoddart, Wilde's initial editor, before the story's publication in ''Lippincott's Monthly Magazine'' in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?recid=31147 |title=The Picture of Dorian Gray – Oscar Wilde, Nicholas Frankel – Harvard University Press |publisher=Hup.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alison Flood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/27/dorian-gray-oscar-wilde-uncensored |title=Uncensored Picture of Dorian Gray published |work=The Guardian |date=27 April 2011|accessdate=30 May 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/thursday-the-uncensored-dorian-gray/2011/03/28/AFw5cD6B_story.html |title=Thursday: The Uncensored "Dorian Gray" |work=The Washington Post |date=4 April 2011|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilde |first=Oscar |authorlink=Oscar Wilde |editor1-first=Nicholas |editor1-last=Frankel |title=The Picture of Dorian Gray: An Annotated, Uncensored Edition |year=2011 |origyear=1890 |publisher=Belknap Press ([[Harvard University Press]]) |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |isbn=978-0-674-05792-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uberfic''' (short for '''uber fanfic''', '''uberXena''') or simply '''uber''', '''über''', or '''ueber''' (from {{lang-de|über-}}, for 'over-' or 'supra-') is a genre of [[Alternate universe (fan fiction)|alternate universe]] [[fan fiction]] in which characters or events are portrayed somewhat closely to original [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] but usually in a different time period, place, or reality, many times featuring the [[ancestors]], [[Kinship|descendants]], or [[reincarnation]]s of canon characters, known as uber-characters. The uber-characters' names are never{{Cn|date=August 2015}} [[canon (fiction)|canon]].  The term originated in ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' fandom, coined in 1997 by Kym Taborn, the webmaster of the fansite Whoosh.org.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.whoosh.org Whoosh.org - The International Association of Xena Studies (IAXS)]&lt;/ref&gt;  This sort of story was used by the series itself, beginning with the second season episode "[[The Xena Scrolls]]".&lt;ref name="lunacy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lunacyreviews.com/terms.shtm#Uber-Xena |title=Definitions |accessdate=2007-02-04 |author=Lunacy |date=2006-02-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070127090906/http://www.lunacyreviews.com/terms.shtm#Uber-Xena &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A common trend in Xena fanfics was to write Uber stories in which the characters' analogues discover that they are soulmates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genders.org/g34/g34_hamming.html Whatever Turns You On: Becoming-Lesbian and the Production of Desire in the Xenaverse]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) maintains many cemeteries specifically devoted to veterans. Most have various rules regarding what must take place in order to be interred there.

==Procedure==
The VA only permits graphics on Government-furnished headstones or markers that are approved emblems of belief, the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Union Army|Union Shield]] (including those who served in the U.S. military through the [[Spanish–American War]]), the [[Confederate States of America|Civil War Confederate]] [[Southern Cross of Honor]], and the [[Medal of Honor]] insignia. [[Arlington National Cemetery]] has similar restrictions on headstones, though it is maintained by [[US Department of the Army]].

The [[religious symbol]]s are rendered as simple [[Monumental inscription|inscriptions]] without sculptural [[relief]] or coloring other than [[black]]. The emblem of belief is an optional feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Funerals/Scheduling-a-Funeral/Headstones-and-Niche-Covers/Government-Headstone-Niche-Covers |title=Arlington National Cemetery &gt; Funerals &gt; Scheduling a Funeral &gt; Headstones and Niche Covers &gt; Government Headstone/Niche Covers |quote=White marble niche covers (15¾ x 11¼ x ¼) generally contain 11 lines of text with or without  an optional emblem of belief.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the VA adds a new symbol a few months after receiving a petition from a faith group.&lt;ref name=Banerjee /&gt; However, the [[Wicca]]n symbol was only added in 2007 to settle a lawsuit filed on behalf of several families by [[Americans United for the Separation of Church and State]] in November 2006.&lt;ref name=Banerjee&gt;{{cite news|last=Banerjee|first=Neela|title=Use of Wiccan Symbol on Veterans’ Headstones Is Approved|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/24/washington/24wiccan.html?_r=0|accessdate=August 1, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 24, 2007}} The VA added emblem of belief #37 – "WICCA (Pentacle)".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.au.org/media/press-releases/veterans-affairs-department-must-accommodate-wiccan-symbol-on-memorial-markers|title=Veterans Affairs Department Must Accommodate Wiccan Symbol On Memorial Markers At Government Cemeteries, Says Americans United|publisher=AU|date=June 8, 2006|accessdate=July 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stewart v.

The first interfaith headstone, which includes a Wiccan [[pentacle]] for Jan Deanna O'Rourke and a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Cross]] for her husband, was installed at Arlington National Cemetery on May 1, 2007, and dedicated on July 4, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackwell|first=Christopher|title=A First Dedication at Arlington|journal=Action|year=2007|url=http://aren.org/newsletter/2007-lammas/action.php?num=2|accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3928">The '''Uzawa–Lucas model''' is an [[economic model]] of [[Endogenous growth theory|endogenous growth]] developed by [[Robert Lucas, Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lucas, Robert |title=On the Mechanics of Economic Development |journal=[[Journal of Monetary Economics]] |year=1988 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=3–42 |doi=10.1016/0304-3932(88)90168-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; building upon initial contributions by [[Hirofumi Uzawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Hirofumi |last=Uzawa |title=Optimum Technical Change in An Aggregative Model of Economic Growth |journal=[[International Economic Review]] |volume=6 |issue=1 |year=1965 |pages=18–31 |jstor=2525621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It extends the [[AK model]] by a two-sector setup, in which physical and [[human capital]] are produced by different technologies. The model explains long-run economic growth as consequence of human capital accumulation.

== Background ==
Lucas approaches in a series of papers published in the 1970s were a challenge to the classic principles of [[Keynesian economics]] when he suggested an amassed version of microeconomics models and then emphasized on human capital accumulation. In his 1988 dissection, using [[Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model|Ramsey framework]] and [[Cobb–Douglas production function|Cobb-Douglas production function]] Lucas gave more attention to formal education rather than [[learning-by-doing]]. While in [[Solow–Swan model|Solow-Swan model]] human capital is constant which leads to no transitional dynamics, Lucas measures total capital as the ratio of physical to human capital, not as sum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.maplesoft.com/applications/view.aspx?sid=7170&amp;view=html|title=I like this Maple Application - The Uzawa Lucas Growth Model|website=www.maplesoft.com|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In the original paper, Lucas described the properties of both centralized and decentralized economics evolving with balanced paths.

==Categories==

Park uses the term ''voodoo science'' (see the quote section below, Page 10) as covering four categories which evolve from [[Delusion|self-delusion]] to [[fraud]]:

* [[pathological science]], wherein genuine scientists deceive themselves
* [[junk science]], speculative theorizing which bamboozles rather than enlightens
* [[pseudoscience]] proper, work falsely claiming to have a scientific basis, which may be dependent on supernatural explanations
* fraudulent science, exploiting [[Pseudoscience|bad science]] for the purposes of [[fraud]]

Park criticizes junk science as the creature of "scientists, many of whom have impressive credentials, who craft arguments deliberately intended to deceive or confuse."&lt;ref name=Park2000p171&gt;Robert L. Park. (2000). p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Park also discusses the [[Daubert standard]] for excluding junk science from litigation.

==Quotes==
* ''I came to realize that many people choose scientific beliefs the same way they choose to be Methodists, or Democrats, or Chicago Cubs fans. They judge science by how well it agrees with the way they want the world to be.'' (Pages VIII-IX)
* ''[P]ractitioners [of ''pseudoscience''] may believe it to be science, just as witches and faith healers may truly believe they can call forth supernatural powers. What may begin as an honest error, however, has a way of evolving through almost imperceptible steps from self-delusion to fraud. The line between foolishness and fraud is thin. Because it is not always easy to tell when that line is crossed, I use the term ''voodoo science'' to cover them all: pathological science, junk science, pseudoscience and fraudulent science. This book is meant to help the reader to recognize voodoo science and to understand the forces that seem to conspire to keep it alive.'' (Page 10)
* ''The integrity of science is anchored in the willingness of scientists to test their ideas and results in direct confrontation with their scientific peers.'' (Page 16)
* ''America's astronauts have been left stranded in low-Earth orbit, like passengers waiting beside an abandoned stretch of track for a train that will never come, bypassed by the advance of science.'' (Page 91)
* ''Few scientists or inventors set out to commit fraud.  In the beginning, most believe they have made a great discovery.  But what happens when they finally realize that things are not behaving as they believed?'' (Page 104)
* ''[T]he uniquely American myth of the self-educated genius fighting against a pompous, close-minded establishment.'' (Page 112)
* ''They are betting against the laws of thermodynamics.  No one has ever won that wager.'' (Page 138)

==Warning signs==

Drawing on examples used in ''Voodoo Science'', Park outlined seven warning signs that a claim may be pseudoscientific in a 2003 article for ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Robert L.

# Discoverers make their claims directly to the popular media, rather than to fellow scientists.
# Discoverers claim that a [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] has tried to suppress the discovery.
# The claimed effect appears so weak that observers can hardly distinguish it from [[Signal noise|noise]].  No amount of further work increases the signal.
# [[Anecdotal evidence]] is used to back up the claim.
# [[True-believer syndrome|True believers]] cite ancient traditions in support of the new claim.
# The discoverer or discoverers work in isolation from the mainstream [[scientific community]].
# The discovery, if true, would require a change in the understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.

==Reception==

Matt Nisbet in the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' noted that the reaction to ''Voodoo Science'' has been mostly favorable.&lt;ref&gt;
Matt Nisbet. (2001). [http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/a_look_back_at_the_best_skeptic_book_of_2000/ "A Look Back at the Best Skeptic Book of 2000"]. Csicop.org. Retrieved 2014-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bob Goldstein in a book review for ''[[Nature Cell Biology]]'' described Park as an equivalent to [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]], scientific writers who have "talent for defending a view of the world that is perfectly rational and free of witchcraft and superstition."&lt;ref&gt;Bob Goldstein. (2000). ''The Professional Debunker (review of the book Voodoo Science: the Road from Foolishness to Fraud, by Robert L. Park)''. ''[[Nature Cell Biology]]''. Vol 2. p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

American chemist [[Nicholas Turro]] wrote "the book is entertaining and provocative reading... Whether or not you agree with Park's take on voodoo science, a message of the book is that if scientists do not take a more significant role in the way that science is disseminated to the public and especially to politicians, voodoo science will continue to survive."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Turro]]. (2002). ''Book Review: Voodoo Science. The Road from Foolishness to Fraud. Edited by Robert L. Park''. ''[[Angewandte Chemie]]''. Vol. 41, Issue 14. p. 2436.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematician Malcolm Sherman in the ''[[American Scientist]]'' gave the book a positive review stating "Park does more than analyze and expose various kinds of bad ("voodoo") science. He demonstrates how valid science is distorted or ignored by the media and by those (including scientists) seeking to influence public policy."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm J. Sherman. (2000). [http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/exposing-fools-gladly "Exposing Fools Gladly"]. ''[[American Scientist]]''. Vol. 88, No. 5. pp. 461-462.&lt;/ref&gt; The physicist Kenneth R. Foster also positively reviewed the book concluding "Park is an articulate and skeptical voice of reason about science."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth R. Foster. (2000). ''Unreal Science''. ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. New Series, Vol. 288, No. 5471. p. 1595.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the book for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Ed Regis (author)|Ed Regis]] compared it positively to the 1957 book by [[Martin Gardner]], ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]'', calling ''Voodoo Science'' a "worthy successor" and praising it for explaining why various purportedly scientific claims were in fact impossible.&lt;ref name="Regis2000"/&gt; Science writer [[Kendrick Frazier]] wrote "Robert Park has brought us a book that has a freshness and originality—and an importance and potential for influence—perhaps not seen since Gardner’s first."&lt;ref&gt;[[Kendrick Frazier]]. (2000). ''Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud''. ''[[Physics Today]]''. Vol 53, No. 10. pp. 78-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robin McKie for ''[[The Observer]]'' described it as "an admirable analysis: wittily written, vivid and put together without a hint of malice."&lt;ref&gt;
Robin McKie. (2002). [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/mar/17/features.review1 "Paperback of the Week"]. ''[[The Observer]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachel Hay in a review wrote that Park had "debunked expertly" pseudoscience topics such as [[homeopathy]], [[cold fusion]] and [[perpetual motion|perpetual motion machines]] but the book is not easily accessible to students.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Hays. (2001). ''Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud by Robert L. Park''. ''[[National Association of Biology Teachers|The American Biology Teacher]]''. Vol. 63, No. 2. p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; However, S. Elizabeth Bird an anthropology professor recommended it for "students who need to establish a grasp of the scientific method."&lt;ref&gt;S. Elizabeth Bird. (2002). ''Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud by Robert L. Park''. ''[[Human Biology (journal)|Human Biology]]''. Vol. 74, No. 4. pp. 621-623.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce Lewenstein wrote a critical review claiming Park had lumped together [[pathological science]], junk science, pseudoscience and fraud all together as voodoo science but this is problematic as "each category alone is fraught with definitional, historical, and analytical difficulties."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce V. Lewenstein. (2004). ''Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud''. ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]''. Vol. 95, No. 2. p. 341,&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Josephson]] wrote that the book, while giving "the official story regarding a number of 'mistaken beliefs' ", did not provide "the additional information that might lead one to conclude that the official view does not tell the whole story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Josephson|first1=Brian|title=Grey areas on the blacklist|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/grey-areas-on-the-blacklist/155556.article|website=[[Times Higher Education|Times Higher Education Supplement]]|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Zone 66''''' is a top down shooting video game released in 1993 for [[DOS]] as shareware. The game was created by a North American [[Demo Scene]] group called Renaissance, and was published by [[Epic MegaGames]].{{cn|date=January 2018}} The group developed a 386 protected-mode ([[PMODE]]) extender to enable the game to play on a 386 processor clocked at 16&amp;nbsp;MHz with full screen updates. This required the PC to be rebooted before and after play, so the game could bypass MS-DOS and boot into its own environment, much like [[PC booter]] games of the 1980s.

==Plot==
In the distant future, an ex-[[Army Special Forces Brigade|GSA]] pilot has been tipped by a stranger that his hometown is in danger, but by the time he reaches the city limits, a [[nuclear bomb]] destroys the city along with his beloved wife and baby girl. The pilot uses a ship on a landing pad to meet with the stranger at a certain location. When the pilot reaches the location, he finds the stranger is dying but obtains some vital information. The pilot then gets a fighter plane and heads to a group of islands to begin his vigilante revenge.

As the pilot progresses from nation to nation destroying each base, the plot thickens and he begins to understand who and what he is dealing with and why the [[terrorism]] started.

==Gameplay==
Before starting the selected mission, the player must choose a type of aircraft. Different planes have different statistics. When the plane has been selected the player can decide what weapons to take to the extent of the payload limit. After the plane inventory has been arranged the mission can begin from a starting supply bay. The player can also return to the supply bay to restock and repair, change aircraft type to use and change weapon types and quantities.

The player makes use of the loaded weapons to destroy air and land targets. Bombs are launched at the target indicator right in front of the plane. In addition to weapons the player has two types of maneuvers to counter hostilities with ease. The player has infinite chances unless all the supply bays are destroyed. The player also has a radar as a guide. All main ground targets must be destroyed to complete a mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gunstar|first1=Desert|title=Zone 66 for the PC General Strategy Guide|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/579132-zone-66/faqs/28369|website=GameFAQs|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtracks==
Three different soundtracks were available for the game, depending on the user's sound card. [[The Sound Blaster]] soundtrack was composed of a mix of FM synthesis sounds and digital samples. This particular method of music creation and playback was unique to the [[Renaissance (demogroup)|Renaissance]] demogroup. The [[Ad Lib, Inc.|AdLib]] soundtrack consisted solely of FM synthesis sounds, due to most AdLib sound cards being incapable of playing digital audio. Some songs in the AdLib soundtrack were arrangements of those in the Sound Blaster soundtrack, while others are completely different songs altogether.,

A third, separately downloadable soundtrack was available for owners of the [[Gravis Ultrasound]] sound card featuring high quality music. Like the AdLib soundtrack, some of the Ultrasound's tracks were completely different songs, whereas others were arrangements of songs found in the AdLib or Sound Blaster versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zone 66 (DOS)|url=http://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php?title=Zone_66_(DOS)|website=Video Game Music Preservation Foundation|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the separate "GUS" music download was due to the size of the Gravis music: as it was nearly as large as the original game, users who only had a Sound Blaster or AdLib didn't have to waste time downloading music they would never hear. Disc versions of the game included all three, as players did not need to download the game.

==Release==
Zone 66 was released primarily as shareware, on floppy disks, and CD-ROM. The first mission was released and distributed as shareware by GT Software. B&amp;N Software released the first four missions of the game via floppy disk; Missions 1 and 2 were released together on one floppy disk, as were Missions 3 and 4. Epic MegaGames released all of the first four missions on two floppy disks. Finally, all eight missions were released on CD-ROM.

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1993 recommended ''Zone 66'' to "joystick jockeys", but stated that "occasional thumb twitchers may find the action a bit much to bear, as this title is quite intense".&lt;ref name="miller199312"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=113 | title=Stocking Up On Holiday Joy With Our Holiday Shareware Picks | work=Computer Gaming World | date=December 1993 | accessdate=29 March 2016 | author=Miller, Chuck | pages=86, 88}}&lt;/ref&gt;
