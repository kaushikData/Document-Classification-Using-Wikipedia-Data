'''ANDi''' is the first [[genetically modified]] [[rhesus monkey]] who was born at [[Oregon Health Sciences University]] (OHSU) on October 2, 2000. OHSU named the monkey ANDi because it stands for “inserted DNA” spelled backward.

==Birth circumstances==
ANDi was born with an extra glowing gene called [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP). This GFP gene, which is naturally occurring in [[jellyfish]], was taken from a jellyfish and genetically added to ANDi’s DNA sequence through his [[chromosomes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chiang|first=Mona|title=Monkey See, Monkey Glow|journal=Science World|date=12 February 2001|pages=pg. 7|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?&amp;id=GALE{{!}}A70872765&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=sunysuffolk&amp;it=r&amp;p=ITOF&amp;sw=w|accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  OHSU used rhesus monkeys because they share 95% of the same genes as humans.

==Genetic modification method==
During the method in which ANDi was created, two hundred and twenty-four eggs were injected with the protein and only 166 or 75% were successfully fertilized. 126 or 76% of these fertilized eggs developed to the four-cell-stage embryos. 40 of the fertilized embryos were implanted in 20 surrogate rhesus mothers, each carrying two embryos. 5 of the surrogates became pregnant. From these five surrogates, three live births proceeded. In these three monkey births only one infant, ANDi, carried the transgene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunnett|first=Stephen|title=Reverse transcription of inserted DNA in a monkey gives us ANDi|journal=Trends in Pharmacological Sciences|date=May 2001|volume= 22|issue=5|pages=221|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=447666d5-c86b-4e3b-8b7f-ef15f147c2d5%40sessionmgr115&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=109&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&amp;AN=5020846|doi=10.1016/s0165-6147(00)01707-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research team leader Gerald Schatten said the technique that created ANDi would become a vital tool for scientists investigating therapies for human diseases.&lt;ref name="Australian12"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Glowing future for GM monkey|journal=The Australian|pages=12|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=d3c7de00-38c2-41ed-bba4-8b6b7563d573%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=109&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=n5h&amp;AN=200101131012274211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
By being able to genetically modify a monkey, a new breakthrough in technology was formed.  ANDi was created in the hope of finding a cure for complicated human diseases such as [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sawicki|first=Stephen|title=Genetic Engineering Results in First Primate Deliberately Mutated|journal=Animals|year=2001|pages=2|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?action=interpret&amp;id=GALE{{!}}A73623663&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=sunysuffolk&amp;it=r&amp;p=ITOF&amp;sw=w&amp;authCount=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since ANDi was born, scientists want to introduce more significant DNA changes. Scientists are looking to make genetic modifications such as those that would make primates closely mimic human diseases like breast cancer or [[HIV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCall|first=WilliM|title=Meet ANDi the first GM monkey|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=5d4fc080-db5a-41c4-925d-e8591eaa9b30%40sessionmgr112&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=109&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=n5h&amp;AN=200101123011507169}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists also want to try to study and cure other diseases through trans genetics such as [[Alzheimer's]], AIDS, and [[diabetes]].&lt;ref name="Australian12" /&gt;

Although ANDi is a carrier of the gene it does not appear to be functional - ANDi does not actually glow.&lt;ref name="New Scientist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coghlan|first=Andy|title=GM monkey passes jellyfish gene to offspring|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17194-gm-monkey-passes-jellyfish-gene-to-offspring.html|work=New Scientist|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''academic dress of the Robert Gordon University''' is normally only worn at [[graduation]] ceremonies and occasionally at other very formal events. In common with most British universities, a graduand of the [[Robert Gordon University]] begins the ceremony wearing the dress of the degree to which they are being admitted except for the hood. This is in contrast to the practice at some universities such as [[Academic dress of the University of Oxford|Oxford]] where a graduand only dons the dress of a degree ''after'' it has been conferred. The current pattern of [[academic dress]] dates from 1992 when the institution became a university.

==Gowns==

For all bachelor's degrees (e.g. BA, BSc, etc.) and [[Master's degree#Types|integrated Masters]] (e.g. MPharm, MEng etc.) a black gown is worn, ending 12&amp;nbsp;inches (30&amp;nbsp;cm) from the ground. For all other master's degrees except MPhil (e.g. MSc, MBA), a black gown is worn, ending 8&amp;nbsp;inches (20&amp;nbsp;cm) from the ground, while for MPhil the gown is the same but also has facings of white silk 2.5&amp;nbsp;inches (6&amp;nbsp;cm) in width. For Doctoral degrees (e.g. PhD), the Doctor's black robe (a black Panama gown) is worn; the Doctor's robe has front edges and sleeves in white silk. The Chancellor's robe is of black silk with front edges and fringes of pale gold, while the Principal/Vice-Chancellor's gown is the same but with front edges and fringes in white. For higher doctorates (including honorary doctorate), the robe is scarlet with white front edges.

==Hoods and headdress==

All hoods are black and white and do not vary in colour by academic discipline, and all are of [[Academic dress in the United Kingdom#Hood|Cambridge shape]].&lt;ref&gt;Groves, N. (2012). Shaw's Academical Dress of Great Britain and Ireland. (3rd ed.). London: The Burgon Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The hood is only put on after the degree has been awarded. For all bachelor's degrees, the hood is black, partially lined with white silk embossed with symbols from the University's coat of arms (the castle, torch, and mechanical cog) and has a black square backpiece (known as the "cape"). For master's degrees, the hood is black and fully lined and edged in white silk embossed with the same symbols from the coat of arms, and the cape also edged in white silk 0.5 inches (1.25&amp;nbsp;cm) in width . For Doctoral degrees the hood is as for master's degrees but with a 1-inch (2.5&amp;nbsp;cm) band of white silk around the cape, while for higher doctorates and honorary doctorates the hood is scarlet and lined with white silk. For all bachelor's and master's degrees, headdress is a plain black [[Square academic cap|mortarboard]] while for Doctoral degrees, headdress consists of a black [[Tudor bonnet]] with white cord and tassels. Recipients of higher doctorates and honorary doctorates wear the same bonnet but with gold cord and tassels.&lt;ref&gt;Groves, N. (2012). Shaw's Academical Dress of Great Britain and Ireland.

[[File:Red flag II.svg|thumb|left|upright|The red flag was one of the first anarchist symbols]]

The red flag was one of first anarchist symbols and it was widely used in late 19th century by anarchists worldwide.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cia.media.pl/symbole_ruchu_anarchistycznego|title=Barwy anarchistyczne: Skąd czarne i czarno-czerwone flagi?|author=&lt;!-- Not stated. --&gt;|date=19 June 2012|website=cia.media.pl|publisher=Centrum Informacji Anarchistycznej|language=pl|trans-title=Anarchist colours: Where are black and black-red flags from|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Kropotkin]] preferred the use of the red flag.&lt;ref name="PK"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|author-link=Peter Kropotkin|year=1998|title=Act for Yourselves.

Use of the red flag by anarchists disappeared after the [[October Revolution]], when red flags started to be associated only with [[Communist party|communist parties]] and bureaucratic, reformist and authoritarian [[social democracy]].&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;

== Black flag ==
[[File:BlackFlagSymbol.svg|thumb|left|upright|The black flag is, among other things, the traditional anarchist symbol]]
The black flag and the color [[black]] in general have been associated with anarchism since the 1880s. Many anarchist [[collective]]s contain the word "black" in their names. There have been a number of anarchist periodicals entitled ''[[Black Flag (newspaper)|Black Flag]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evren|first=Sureyyya|title=Black Flag White Masks: Anti-Racism and Anarchist Historiography|url=https://queens.scholarsportal.info/ojs-archive/index.php/affinities/article/view/6107/5752|journal=Affinities: A Journal of Radical Theory, Culture, and Action|volume=8|issue=1|date=Summer 2014|pages=23–43|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The uniform blackness of the flag is in stark contrast to the colorful flags typical of most [[nation state]]s. Additionally, as a [[white flag]] has been used to request parley or to surrender, the black flag symbolizes defiance and opposition to surrender.

=== Historical origins ===
The black flag represents the absence of a flag and thus stands in opposition to the very notion of nation states. In that light, the flag can be seen as a rejection of the concept of representation, or the idea that any person or institution can adequately represent a group of individuals. [[History of anarchism|Modern anarchism]] has a shared ancestry with—amongst other ideologies—[[socialism]], a movement strongly associated with the [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]]. As anarchism became more and more distinct from socialism in the 1880s, it adopted the black flag in an attempt to differentiate itself.&lt;ref name="An Anarchist FAQ"/&gt; Some anarchists at the time, such as [[Peter Kropotkin]], preferred to continue using the red flag rather than adopt the black.&lt;ref name="PK"/&gt;

=== Subsequent use ===
The black flag first became associated with anarchism in the 1880s. The French anarchist paper, ''Le Drapeau Noir'' (''The Black Flag''), which existed until 1882, is one of the first published references to use black as an anarchist color. Black International was the name of a [[London]] anarchist group founded in July 1881. [[Louise Michel]], participant in the [[Paris Commune|Paris Commune of 1871]], flew the black flag during demonstration of the unemployed in Paris in March 1883. An open-air meeting of the unemployed was broken up by the police and around 500 demonstrators, with Michel at the front carrying a black flag and shouting "Bread, work, or lead!" marched off towards the boulevard Saint-Germain. The crowd pillaged three baker's shops before the police attacked. Michel was arrested and sentenced to six years solitary confinement. Public pressure soon forced the granting of an amnesty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodcock|first=George|title=Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements|year=1962|pp=251–252}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Michel, the "black flag is the flag of strikes and the flag of those who are hungry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michel|first=Louise|author-link=Louise Michel|title=The Red Virgin: Memoirs of Louise Michel|year=1981|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=3uQMzo8yyD8C&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=%22the+black+flag+is+the+flag+of+strikes+and+the+flag+of+those+who+are+hungry%22 168]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The black flag soon made its way to the United States. The black flag was displayed in Chicago at an anarchist demonstration in November 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Avrich|first=Paul|author-link=Paul Avrich|title=The Haymarket Tragedy|year=1986|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the English language newspaper of the Chicago anarchists, it was "the fearful symbol of hunger, misery and death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Avrich|first=Paul|author-link=Paul Avrich|title=The Haymarket Tragedy|year=1986|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bisected flag==
{{See also|Communist symbolism#Red and black flag}}
[[File:Anarchist_flag.svg|150px|thumb|right|upright|A diagonally bisected red and black flag]]
The colors black and red have been used by anarchists since at least the late 1800s, when they were used on cockades by Italian anarchists in the 1864 [[Anarchism_in_Italy#Origins|Bologna insurrection]], and in 1877 when anarchists entered the Italian town [[Letino]] carrying red and black flags to promote the [[First International]].&lt;ref name="An Anarchist FAQ"/&gt; Diagonally divided red and black flags were popularized during the [[Spanish Civil War]] by the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] labor union [[Confederación_Nacional_del_Trabajo|CNT]],&lt;ref name="An Anarchist FAQ"/&gt; and are used to this day by anarchist organizations. Similar flags but with different colors are commonly used to represent specific anarchist ideologies, such as black and purple for [[anarcha-feminism]], black and green for [[green anarchism]], and black and orange for [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=BDaddyUS |title=Anarchist Flags: The Symbols of Anarchism |url=https://terlinguatradewinds.wordpress.com/2017/08/25/anarchist-flags-anarchism-symbols-anarchy/ |website=Green is the New Red |publisher=WordPress.com |accessdate=16 October 2018 |date=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circle-A is almost certainly the best-known present-day symbol for anarchy. It is a [[monogram]] that consists of the capital letter "[[A]]" surrounded by the capital letter "[[O]]". The letter "A" is derived from the first letter of "anarchy" or "anarchism" in most European languages and is the same in both [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic script]]s. The "O" stands for order and together they stand for "society seeks order in anarchy" ({{lang-fr|la société cherche l'ordre dans l'anarchie}}), a phrase written by [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in his 1840 book ''[[What Is Property?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Proudhon|first=Piere-Joseph|author-link=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|title=Proudhon: What is Property?|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ELTq6WIulyEC&amp;printsec=frontcover|editor-last1=Kelley|editor-first1=Donald R.|editor-last2=Smith|editor-first2=Bonnie G.|editor-link2=Bonnie G.

The circle-A long predates the [[anarcho-punk]] movement, which was part of the [[punk rock]] movement of the late 1970s. However, the punk movement helped spread the circle-A symbol more widely and helped raise awareness of it among non-anarchists. This process began with the use of anarchist imagery when members of the band [[Crass]] became aware of the symbol while traveling through France.&lt;ref name="The only way to be - Anarchy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Appleford|first=Steve|url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=2696&amp;IssueNum=122|title=The Only Way to Be – Anarchy!|date=10 June 2005|work=[[LA CityBeat]]|publisher=[[Southland Publishing]]|location=Los Angeles, California|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224205914/http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=2696&amp;IssueNum=122|archivedate=24 December 2005|accessdate=30 August 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Linear visible spectrum.svg|thumb|350px|The notion of "green" in modern European languages corresponds to about 520&amp;ndash;570&amp;nbsp;nm, but many historical and non-European languages make other choices, e.g. using a term for the range of ca. 450&amp;ndash;530&amp;nbsp;nm ("blue/green") and another for ca. 530&amp;ndash;590&amp;nbsp;nm  ("green/yellow").]]

Many languages do not distinguish between what in English are described as "blue" and "green" and instead use a cover term spanning both. To describe this English [[lexical gap]], linguists use the [[portmanteau]] word ''grue'', from ''green'' and ''blue'', which the philosopher [[Nelson Goodman#Induction and "grue"|Nelson Goodman]] coined in his 1955 ''[[Fact, Fiction, and Forecast]]'' to illustrate the "[[new riddle of induction]]".

The exact definition of "blue" and "green" may be complicated by the speakers not primarily distinguishing the hue, but using terms that describe other color components such as saturation and luminosity, or other properties of the object being described. For example, "blue" and "green" might be distinguished, but a single term might be used for both if the color is dark. Furthermore, green might be associated with yellow, and blue with black or gray.

According to [[Brent Berlin]] and [[Paul Kay]]'s 1969 study ''[[Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution]]'', distinct terms for [[brown]], [[purple]], [[pink]], [[orange (colour)|orange]] and [[grey]] will not emerge in a language until the language has made a distinction between green and blue. In their account of the development of color terms the first terms to emerge are those for [[white]]/[[black]] (or [[light]]/[[dark]]), [[red]] and [[green]]/[[yellow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = David | last = Crystal | authorlink = David Crystal | title = The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-521-55050-5 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | location = New York | oclc = 132687558 | page = 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Afro-Asiatic==

===Amazigh===
The word for blue in [[Amazigh]] language is ''Azerwal''. In some dialects of [[Amazigh]], like [[Shilha language|Shilha]], the word ''Azegzaw'' is used for both green and blue.

===Arabic===
The color of the sky is sometimes referred to as "the green" in Classical Arabic poetry, in which it is al-khaḍrā' ({{lang|ar|الخضراء}}). In [[Arabic language|Arabic]] the word for blue is generally ''azraq'' ({{lang|ar|أزرق}}). The Arabic word for green is  ''akhḍar'' ({{lang|ar|أخضر}}).

In [[Moroccan Arabic]], the word for light blue is ''šíbi'', whereas ''zraq'' ({{Script|Arab|زرق}}) stands for blue and ''khḍar'' ({{Script|Arab|خضر}}) for green. The word ''zrag'' ({{Script|Arab|زرڭ}}) is used to describe the color of [[cyanosis|a suffocated person]], and is also used pejoratively as synonym to "dumb".

===Egyptian===
The ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] word ''[[wadjet]]'' covers the range of blue, blue-green, and green. On the one hand, it was the name of a goddess, the patroness of Lower Egypt, represented as a cobra called Wadjet, "the green one," or as the [[Eye of Horus]], also called by the same name. On the other hand, ''wedjet'' was the word used for [[Egyptian blue]] in faience ceramics.

===Hebrew===
In Hebrew, the word "{{Hebrew|כחול}}" (pronounced {{IPA|/kaˈχol/}}) means blue, while "{{Hebrew|ירוק}}" (pronounced {{IPA|/jaˈʁok/}}) means green and has the same [[Semitic root|root]], {{Hebrew|י־ר־ק}} (j-r-q), as the word for vegetables ({{Hebrew|ירקות}}, {{IPA|jeʁaˈkot}}). However, in classical Hebrew, {{Hebrew|ירוק}} can mean both green and yellow, giving rise to such expressions as {{Hebrew|ירוק כרישה}} (pronounced {{IPA|/jaˈʁok kriʃ'ʔa/}}), "leek green", to specify green to the exclusion of yellow. 
Like Russian and Italian, Hebrew has a separate name for light blue ({{Hebrew|תכלת}}, "[[Tekhelet|t'khelet]]")—the color of the sky and of fringes on the ritual garment ''[[Tzitzit]]''. This color has [[Blue in Judaism|special symbolic significance]] in [[Judaism]] and Jewish culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/530127/jewish/Techelet-Blue-Thread.htm |title=Techelet |website=chabad.org |publisher= Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center |location=Brooklyn, NY |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indo-European==

===Albanian===
Albanian has two major words for "blue": ''kaltër'' refers to a light blue, such as that of the sky, but it is derived from Vulgar Latin ''calthinus'', itself derived from ''caltha'', a loan from Ancient Greek that meant "marigold" a small and in fact yellow flower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Vladimir Orel |authorlink= Vladimir Orel |year=2000 |publisher=Brill |location= Leiden |title= A Concise Historical Dictionary of the Albanian language |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Vladimir Orel |year=1988 |publisher=Brill |pages=166–7 |title= Albanian Etymological Dictionary |location= [[Leiden]]; [[Boston]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other word, ''blu'', refers to a darker shade of blue, and like many similar words across many European languages, derives ultimately from Germanic (see also: Italian ''blu''). There is a separate word for green, ''gjelbër'', which derives from the Latin ''galbinus'', which originally meant "yellow"; the original Latin word for green on the other hand, ''viridis'', is the source of the Albanian word for "yellow", ''verdhë''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Vladimir Orel |year=2000 |publisher=Brill |location= Leiden |title= A Concise Historical Dictionary of the Albanian language |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltic===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
There are separate words for green (''zaļš'') and blue (''zils'') in [[Latvian language|Latvian]]. Both ''zils'' and ''zaļš'' stem from the same Proto-Indo-European word for yellow (''*ghel''). Several other words in Latvian have been derived from these colors, namely grass is called ''zāle'' (from ''zaļš''), while the name for iris is ''zīlīte'' (from ''zils'').

The now archaic word ''mēļš'' was used to describe both dark blue and black (probably indicating that previously ''zils'' was used only for lighter shades of blue). For instance, blueberries and blackberries are called ''mellenes''.

In Latvian black is "melns" (in some local dialects "mells").

In Lithuanian ''žalias'' is green, ''mėlynas'' is blue and ''žilas'' is grey (hair), grizzled.

===Slavic===
[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], a [[South Slavic language]], makes a clear distinction between blue (синьо, ''sinyo''), green (зелено, ''zeleno''), and black (черно, ''cherno'').

In the [[Polish language]], blue (''niebieski'' from ''niebo'' – sky) and green (''zielony'') are treated as separate colors. The word for [[sky blue]] or [[azure (color)|azure]]—''błękitny''—might be considered either a basic color or a [[shades of blue|shade of blue]] by different speakers. Similarly dark blue or [[navy blue]] (''granatowy''—deriving from the name of [[pomegranate]] (granat), some [[cultivar]]s of which are dark purplish blue in color) can be considered by some speakers as a separate basic color. Black (''czarny'') is completely distinguished from blue. As in English, Polish distinguishes pink ("różowy") from red ("czerwony").

The word ''siwy'' means blue-gray in Polish (literally it means the color of gray hair). The word ''siny'' refers to violet-blue and is used to describe the color of bruises ("siniaki"), [[hematoma]], and the blue skin discoloration that can result from moderate [[hypothermia]].

[[Russian language|Russian]] does not have a single word referring to the whole range of colors denoted by the English term "blue". Instead, it traditionally treats light blue (голубой, ''goluboy'') as a separate color independent from plain or dark blue (синий, ''siniy''), with all seven "basic" colors of the spectrum (red–orange–yellow–green–[[wikt:голубой#Russian|голубой]] / ''goluboy'' (sky blue, light azure, but ''does not equal'' [[cyan]])–[[wikt:синий#Russian|синий]] / ''siniy'' ("true" deep [[blue]], like synthetic [[ultramarine]])–violet) while in English the light blues like azure and cyan are considered mere shades of "blue" and not different colors.&lt;br/&gt;
To better understand this, consider that English makes a similar distinction between "[[red]]" and light red ([[pink]], which is considered a different color and not merely a kind of red), but such a distinction is unknown in several other languages; for example, both "red" ({{lang|zh|红}} / {{lang|zh|紅}}, ''hóng'') and "pink" ({{lang|zh|粉红}}, ''fěn hóng'', lit. "powder red") have traditionally been considered varieties of a single color in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. The Russian language also distinguishes between red (красный, krasniy) and pink (розовый, rozoviy).

Similarly English descriptions of rainbows have often distinguished between blue or [[turquoise (color)|turquoise]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gmax.co.za/think/history/2004/040628-rainbowflag.html | title = What is the history of the rainbow flag? | author = |publisher=Gmax.co.za | date = 2004-06-28|accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[indigo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eo.ucar.edu/rainbows/ |title=About Rainbows |publisher=Eo.ucar.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter of which is often described as dark blue or [[ultramarine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Littell's Living Age | volume = 145 | issue = 1869 | url = http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Littell's_Living_Age/Volume_145/Issue_1869/Definition_of_the_Color_Indigo | title = Definition of the Color Indigo | date = 1880-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Serbo-Croatian]] color system makes a distinction between blue, green and black:

*Blue: ''plava'' (indicates any blue) or ''modra''. 
**Navy blue: ''teget''
*Green: ''zelena''
*Black: ''crna''

''Modra'' may also mean dark purple and is used to describe a bruise, ''modrica''. Native speakers cannot pinpoint a color on the spectrum which would correspond to ''modra''.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

''Sinje'', analogue to Bulgarian синьо, ''sinyo''/Russian синий, ''siniy'', is archaic, and denotes blue-gray, usually used to describe dark skies or seas.

''Mrka'' "dusky" can refer either to dark grey or dark brown, or even black. It is etymologically derived from the word for "darkness" (''mrak''), but it is distinct from "dark" (''taman'').

Turquoise is usually described as "tirkizna", and similarly, azure will use a loan word "azurna".  There is no specific word for cyan. Blond hair is called ''plava'' ('blue'), reflecting likely the archaic use of "plav" for any bright white/blue colors (like the sky).

Shades are defined with a prefix (e.g. "tamno-" for dark, or "svetlo-" for light), for example, dark blue = "tamnoplava".

===Celtic===
The [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word ''glas'' is usually translated as "blue"; however, it can also refer, variously, to the color of the sea, of grass, or of silver (cf. greek γλαυκός). The word ''gwyrdd'' (a borrowing from Latin ''viridis'') is the standard translation for "green". In traditional [[Welsh language|Welsh]] (and related languages), ''glas'' could refer to certain shades of green and grey as well as blue, and ''llwyd'' could refer to various shades of grey and brown; however, modern Welsh is tending toward the [[Color term|11-color Western scheme]], restricting ''glas'' to blue and using ''gwyrdd'' for green, ''llwyd'' for grey and ''brown'' for brown.

In [[Irish language|Modern Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] the word for "blue" is ''gorm'' (whence the name [[Cairngorm mountains]] derives) – a borrowing of the now obsolete Early Welsh word ''gwrm'', meaning "dark blue" or "dusky". A relic of the original meaning ("dusky") survives in the Irish term ''daoine gorma'', meaning "[[Black people]]".

[[File:Colours in Irish.png|thumb|300xpx|Colour wheel in Irish with notes on their usage]]
In [[Old Irish|Old]] and [[Middle Irish]], like in Welsh, ''glas'' was a blanket term for colors ranging from green to blue to various shades of grey (e.g. the ''glas'' of a sword, the ''glas'' of stone, etc.). In Modern Irish, it has come to mean various shades of green, with specific reference to plant hues,  and grey (like the sea); other shades of green{{Vague|date=January 2015}} would be referred to in Modern Irish as ''uaine'' or ''uaithne'', while ''liath'' is grey proper (like a stone).

Scottish Gaelic uses the term ''uaine'' for "green". However, the dividing line between it and ''gorm'' is somewhat different than between the English "green" and "blue", with ''uaine'' signifying a light green or yellow-green, and ''gorm'' extending from dark blue (what in English might be navy blue) to include the dark green or blue-green of vegetation. Grass, for instance, is ''gorm'', rather than ''uaine''. In addition, ''liath'' covers a range from light blue to light grey. However, the term for a green apple, such as a Granny Smith, would be ''ubhal glas''.

The boundary between colors varies much more than the "focal point": e.g. an island known in [[Breton language|Breton]] as ''Enez glas ("the blue island")'' is called in French ''l'Île Verte ("the green island")'', in both cases referring to the greyish-green color of its bushes, even though both languages distinguish green (as in lawn grass) from blue (as in a cloudless midday sky).

===Romance===
The Romance terms for "green" (Catalan ''{{wiktca|verd}}'', French ''{{wiktfr|vert}}'', Italian, Portuguese, Romanian and Spanish ''{{linktext|verde}}'') are all from Latin ''{{wiktla|viridis}}''. The terms for "blue", on the other hand, vary: Catalan ''{{wiktca|blau}}'', Occitan ''{{wiktoc|blau}}'', French ''{{wiktfr|bleu}}'' and Italian ''{{wiktit|blu}}'' come from a Germanic root, whereas the Spanish and Portuguese ''azul'' is likely to come from Arabic. French ''bleu'' was in turn loaned into many other languages, including English. Latin itself did not have a word covering all shades of blue, which may help explain these borrowings. It did, however, recognise ''{{wiktla|caeruleus}}'' (dark blue, sometimes greenish), and ''{{wiktla|lividus}}'' (greyish blue, like lead).

[[French language|French]], as most Romance languages, makes roughly the same distinctions as English and has a specific term for each of blue ("{{wiktfr|bleu}}"), green ("{{wiktfr|vert}}") and grey ("{{wiktfr|gris}}"). For all three, different shades can be indicated with different (compound) terms, none of them being considered as basic color terms: "bleu {{wiktfr|clair}}" (light blue), "bleu {{wiktfr|ciel}}" (sky blue), "bleu {{wiktfr|marine}}" (Navy blue), "bleu {{wiktfr|roi}}" (royal blue); "vert clair" (light green), "vert {{wiktfr|pomme}}" (literally: apple green); "gris {{wiktfr|anthracite}}" (very dark grey), "gris {{wiktfr|souris}}" (literally: mouse grey). French also uses "{{wiktfr|azur}}" for the lighter shade of blue of the sunny sky, that was in turn loaned to English as "azure".

[[Catalan language|Catalan]] distinguishes blue (''{{wiktca|blau}}'') from green (''{{wiktca|verd}}'') and grey (''{{wiktca|gris}}''). Other basic or common colors by its own right are ''{{wiktca|porpra}}'' "purple", ''{{wiktca|groc}}'' "yellow", ''{{wiktca|taronja}}'' "orange", ''{{wiktca|vermell}}'' "red", ''{{wiktca|rosa}}'' "pink", ''{{wiktca|marró}}'' "brown", ''{{wiktca|gris}}'' "grey", ''{{wiktca|negre}}'' "black" and ''{{wiktca|blanc}}'' "white". For all these colors except black and white it is possible to indicate different shades using ''{{wiktca|clar}}'' "light" and ''{{wiktca|fosc}}'' "dark"; for blue, though, it generally is ''blau cel'' "sky blue" and ''blau marí'' "sea blue". Other words and compounds are common to indicate more elaborated shades (''verd llimona'' "lemon green", ''rosa pàlid'' "pale pink", ''lila'' "lilac", ''granat'' "carmine", ''ocre'' "ochre", ''verd oliva'' "olive green", etc.). Catalan actually distinguishes two reds with different and common words: while ''{{wiktca|vermell}}'' refers to the color of arterial blood, ''{{wiktca|roig}}'' is a red tending towards yellow or the color of clay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibiloni.cat|url=http://bibiloni.cat/ambbonesparaules/roig1.html|accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Italian language|Italian]] distinguishes blue (''{{wiktit|blu}}''), green (''{{wiktit|verde}}'') and grey (''{{wiktit|grigio}}''). There are also common words for light blue (e.g. the color of the cloudless sky): ''{{wiktit|azzurro}}'' and ''{{wiktit|celeste}}'', and other for darker shades, e.g. ''{{wiktit|indaco}}'', indigo. ''{{wiktit|azzurro|Azzurro}}'', the English equivalent of [[azure (color)|azure]], is usually considered a separate basic color rather than a shade of ''blu'' (similar to  the distinction in English between red and pink). Some sources even go to the point of defining ''blu'' as a darker shade of ''azzurro''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gabrielli|first=Aldo|title=Grande Dizionario Italiano|url=http://dizionari.hoepli.it/Dizionario_Italiano/parola/blu.aspx?idD=1&amp;Query=blu|accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Celeste'' literally means '(the color) of the sky' and can be used as synonym of ''azzurro'', although it will more often be considered a less saturated hue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dizionario Italiano - Celeste|url=http://dizionari.corriere.it/dizionario_italiano/C/celeste_1.shtml|work=Sabatini Coletti - Dizionario Italiano|accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gabrielli|first=Aldo|title=Grande Dizionario Italiano|url=http://www.grandidizionari.it/Dizionario_Italiano/parola/C/celeste_1.aspx?query=celeste+(1)|accessdate=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{wiktit|Acquamarina}}'' (aquamarine) literally "sea water", indicates an even lighter, almost transparent, shade of blue. To indicate a mix of green and blue, Italians might say ''verde {{wiktit|acqua}}'', literally ''water green''. The term ''{{wiktit|glauco}}'', not common in standard italian and perceived as a literary term, is used in scientific contexts (esp. botany) to indicate a mix of blue, green and gray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dizionario Italiano - Glauco|url=http://dizionari.corriere.it/dizionario_italiano/G/glauco.shtml|work=Sabatini Coletti - Dizionario Italiano|accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar terms are ''{{wiktit|ceruleo}}'' and ''{{wiktit|turchese}}'' (turquoise/teal); they are more saturated hues (especially turchese) and differ in context of use: the first is a literary or bureaucratic term (used for example to indicate light green eyes in identity cards); the second is more common in any informal speech, along with the variant ''turchino'' (for instance, the fairy of [[The Adventures of Pinocchio]] is called ''fata turchina'').

In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the word "{{wiktpt|azul}}" means blue and the word "{{wiktpt|verde}}" means green. Furthermore, "azul-{{wiktpt|claro}}" means light-blue, and "azul-{{wiktpt|escuro}}" means dark-blue. More distinctions can be made between several hues of blue. For instance, "azul-{{wiktpt|celeste}}" means sky blue, "azul-{{wiktpt|marinho}}" means navy-blue and "azul-{{wiktpt|turquesa}}" means turquoise-blue. One can also make the distinction between "verde-claro" and "verde-escuro", meaning light and dark-green respectively, and more distinctions between several qualities of green: for instance, "verde-{{wiktpt|oliva}}" means olive-green and "verde-{{wiktpt|esmeralda}}" means emerald-green. [[Cyan]] is usually called "azul-celeste" (sky blue) or "azul-{{wiktpt|piscina}}", meaning pool blue, but also less commonly "{{wiktpt|ciano}}", and "verde-{{wiktpt|água}}", meaning water green.

[[Romanian language|Romanian]] clearly distinguishes between the colors green (''{{wiktro|verde}}'') and blue (''{{wiktro|albastru}}''). It also uses separate words for different hues of the same color, e.g. light blue (''{{wiktro|bleu}}''), blue (''albastru''), dark-blue (''bleu-{{wiktro|marin}}'' or ''{{wiktro|bleomarin}}''), along with a word for turquoise (''{{wiktro|turcoaz}}'') and azure (''{{wiktro|azur}}'' or ''{{wiktro|azuriu}}'').

Similarly to French, Romanian, Italian and Portuguese, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] distinguishes blue (''{{wiktes|azul}}'') and green (''{{wiktes|verde}}'') and has an additional term for the tone of blue visible in the sky, namely "{{wiktes|celeste}}", which is nonetheless considered a shade of blue.

=== Germanic ===
In [[Old Norse]], the word ''{{linktext|blár}}'' "blue" (from [[proto-Germanic language|proto-Germanic]] {{linktext|blēwaz}}) was also used to describe [[black]] (and the common word for people of African descent was thus ''{{linktext|blámenn}}'' 'blue/black men'). In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], ''{{linktext|blå}}'', the modern word for blue, was used this way until the early 20th century, and it still is to a limited extent in modern [[Faroese language|Faroese]].

German and Dutch distinguish blue (respectively ''{{linktext|blau}}'' and ''{{linktext|blauw}}'') and green (''{{linktext|grün}}'' and ''{{linktext|groen}}'') very similarly to English. There are (compound) terms for light blue (''{{linktext|hellblau}}'' and ''{{linktext|lichtblauw}}'') and darker shades of blue (''{{linktext|dunkelblau}}'' and ''{{linktext|donkerblauw}}''). In addition, adjective forms of most traditional color names are inflected to match the corresponding noun's case and gender.

=== Greek ===
The terms for "blue" and "green" have changed completely in the transition from [[Ancient Greek]] to [[Modern Greek]].  Ancient Greek had γλαυκός (''glaukós'') "clear light blue", also with a turquoise/teal/green hue (it was a typical term for goddess Athena's eyes, portrayed in green or light blue) contrasting with χλωρός (''khlōrós'') "bright green" but also "acid yellow" (cf. words such as chlorophyll). κυανός (''kuanós'', which turned into "cyan" in English) meant either a "dark blue/green substance" or just "blue".

We{{who|date=November 2018}} know the terms changed in Byzantine Era through the name of two political factions of Constantinople: the Green ones (Πράσινοι) and the Blue ones (Bένετοι); we don't know if the names of those groups influenced the change or if they have been named from the new color terms.

Modern Greek has πράσινο (''prásino'') for green and γαλάζιο (''galázio'') or θαλασσί (''thalassí'', 'sea colored') for light blue/sea blue: the previous term for blue is therefore disappeared. 
The recent loan μπλε (''mple'', from French ''bleu'') is used for blue.
In the Modern Greek language, there are additional names for light and dark blues/greens:
# τυρκουάζ (''tyrkouáz'') for turquoise
# κυανό (''kyanó'') for azure
# λαχανί (''lachaní'' 'cabbage colored') for lime green
# λαδί (''ladí'') for olive green
# χακί (''chakí'') for dark [[khaki]]
# κυπαρισσί (''kyparissí'' 'cypress colored') for brownish green.

As a rule, the first two words of the list are accepted as shades of blue, and the rest as shades of green. Also βιολέ (''violé'') / βιολετί (''violetí'') for violet blue (which is, however, usually considered as a shade of purple, rather than blue).

===Iranian===

[[Ossetian language|Ossetian]] has one word for blue, light blue and green—цъæх (tsəh), which also means "grey" and "glaucous"—but it also has a separate word for green, кæрдæгхуыз (kərdəghuɨz), literally "grassy" (from кæрдæг "grass"). The latter derives from кæрдын (kərdɨn) "to mow" (like in German ''Heu'' (''hau'') &lt; ''hauen'' (to mow)).

Ossetian also has separate words for these colors:
* light blue: æрвхуыз (ərvhuɨz) from æрвон "sky"
* glaucous: бæлонхуыз (bəlonhuɨz) from бæлон "pigeon" (a [[calque]] from Russian, cf. голубой (light blue) &lt; голубь (pigeon)); also фæздæгхуыз (fəzdəghuɨz) from ''fazdag'' "smoke", from Old Persian *pazdaka-, cognate of Latin ''pedis'' (louse) and Russian (obscene) ''пизда'' (cunt), because of its stinking.
* blue: копрадзхуыз (kopradzhuɨz), from копрадз (kopradz) - bluing for laundering, transliteration of Russian купорос "vitriol" from Latin ''cuprum'' "copper"
* grey: фæныкхуыз (fənykhuɨz), from фæнык "ashes", originating from Persian *pa(s)nu-ka, cognate or Russian песок "sand"

[[Pashto]] uses the word ''shīn'' to denote blue as well as green. ''Shinkay'', a word derived from ''shīn'', means 'greenery' but ''shīn āsmān'' means 'blue sky'. When there is ambiguity, it is common to ask (as in Vietnamese), "''Shīn'' like the sky? Or ''shīn'' like plants?"

[[Persian language|Persian]] words for blue include {{lang|fa|آبی}} ''ābi'' (literally the color of water, from ''āb'' 'water'), for blue generally; {{lang|fa|نیلی}} ''nili'' (from ''nil'', '[[indigo dye]]'), for deeper shades of blue such as the color of rain clouds; {{lang|fa|فیروزه}} ''fayruzeh'' '[[turquoise]] stone', used to describe the color of blue eyes; {{lang|fa|لاجوردی}} ''lājvardi'' or {{lang|fa|لاژوردی}} ''lāzhvardi'' '[[lapis lazuli]] color', source of the words ''lazuli'' and ''azure''; {{lang|fa|نیلوفری}} ''nilufari'' '[[Nymphaeaceae|water lily]] color'; and {{lang|fa|کبود}} ''kabud'', an old literary word for 'blue'.

The Persian word for green is {{lang|fa|سبز}} ''sabz''. As in [[Sudan]], dark-skinned people may be described as "green".

The color of the sky is variously described in [[Persian poetry]] using the words ''sabz'', ''fayruzeh'', ''nil'', ''lājvardi'', or ''nilufari''— literally "green", "indigo", "turquoise", "azure" or "the color of water lilies". For example, ''sabz-ākhor'' "green stable", ''sabz-āshyāneh'' "green ceiling", ''sabz-ayvān'' "green balcony", ''sabz-bādbān'' "green sail", ''sabz-bāgh'' "green garden", ''sabz-farsh'' "green carpet", ''sabz-golshan'' "green flower-garden", ''sabz-kārgāh'' "green workshop", ''sabz-kh''&lt;sup&gt;''v''&lt;/sup&gt;''ān'' "green table", ''sabz-manzareh'' "green panorama", ''sabz-maydān'' "green field" ''sabz-pol'' "green bridge", ''sabz-tāq'' "green arch", ''sabz-tasht'' "green bowl", and ''sabz-tā'us'' "green peacock" are poetic epithets for the sky—in addition to similar compounds using the words for blue, e.g. ''lājvardi-saqf'' "lapis lazuli-colored roof" or ''fayruzeh-tasht'' "turquoise bowl". Moreover, the words for green of Arabic origin {{lang|fa|اخضر}} ''akhzar'' and {{lang|fa|خضرا}} ''khazrā'' are used for epithets of the sky or heaven, such as ''charkh-e akhzar'' "green wheel".&lt;ref&gt;[[F. Steingass]], ''A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary'', s.v. {{lang|fa|سبز}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indo-Aryan ===
[[Indo-Aryan languages]] distinguish blue from green. In Urdu, blue is نیلا (''nīlā'') and green is سبز (''sabz''). There are some names of shades of blue as well, like فیروزی (''ferozī'') "[[turquoise (colour)|turquoise]]".
In Hindi, blue is नीला (''nīlā'') and green is हरा (''harā'').
In Marathi, blue is निळा (''niḽā'') and green is हिरवा (''hiravā'').

==Basque==
In the Basque language there are three native color words derived from "ur" (water). ''Urdin'', is nowadays used in most cases for blue. "Ubel", originally meant flash flood and, with respect to colors, is often used in relation to bruises. "Begi ubela" would be translated into English by "a black and blue eye". But in Basque, unlike English, ubel remains in use after the hit skin has lost its purple color and become pale, why this word is used for both purple in particular and pale hue in general. "Uher", originally meant dirty, still water or rusty and is used for gray or sienna tones or impure, dark color in general. Green is usually expressed with the loan-word ''berde'' from Spanish "verde"/ French "vert". The authenticity of the less common Basque terms for green ''(h)orlegi'' and ''musker'' is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euskara.euskadi.net/r59-738/es/contenidos/informacion/eu_mintzagai_bilduma_aurkezpen/es_aurkezp/adjuntos/06-Eusk_koloreak.pdf |format=PDF |title=Euskarak erakutsi koloreak ikusten |publisher=Euskara.euskadi.net |accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uralic==

=== Finnish ===
[[Finnish language|Finnish]] makes a distinction between ''vihreä'' (green) and ''sininen'' (blue). [[Turquoise (color)|Turquoise]] or [[teal]] (''turkoosi'' or ''sinivihreä'') is considered to be a separate, intermediate color between green and blue, and black (''musta'') is also differentiated from blue.

The name for blue, ''sininen'', is shared with other [[Finnic languages]] and is thus dated to the era of the [[Proto-Finnic language]] (ca. 5000 years old). However, it is also shared with the unrelated Russian language (синий, ''siniy''), suggesting that it is a loanword. (Alternatively, the Russian word синий could represent Finnic [[substratum]]). The word ''vihreä'' (''viher-'', archaic ''viheriä'', ''viheriäinen'') is related to ''vehreä'' "verdant" and ''vihanta'' "green", and ''viha'' "hate", originally "poison". It is not shared with Estonian, in which it is ''roheline'', probably related with the Estonian word ''rohi'' "grass". However, the form ''viha'' does have correspondences in related languages as far as [[Permic languages]], where it means not only "poison" but "bile" or "green or yellow". It has been originally loaned from an Indo-Iranian protolanguage and is related to Latin ''virus'' "poison". Furthermore, the word ''musta'' "black" is also of Finnic origin.

The differentiation of several colors by [[hue]] is at least [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] (a major subgroup of Uralic) in origin. Before this, only red (''punainen'') was clearly distinguished by hue, with other colors described in terms of brightness (''valkea'' vs. ''musta''), using non-color adjectives for further specificity. Alternatively, it appears that the distinction between ''valkea'' and ''musta'' was in fact "clean, shining" vs. "dirty, murky". The original meaning of ''sini'' was possibly either "black/dark" or "green". Mauno Koski's theory is that dark colors of high saturation—both blue and green—would be ''sini'', while shades of color with low saturation, such as dark brown or black, would be ''musta''. Although it is theorized that originally ''vihreä'' was not a true color name and was used to describe plants only, the occurrence of ''vihreä'' or ''viha'' as a name of a color in several related languages shows that it was probably [[polysemy|polysemic]] (meaning both "green" and "verdant") already in early Baltic-Finnic. However, whatever the case with these theories, differentiation of blue and green must be at least as old as the Baltic-Finnic languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/6067/varinnim.pdf?sequence=2 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306131349/http://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/6067/varinnim.pdf?sequence=2 |date=March 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hungarian ===
[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] makes the distinction between green (''zöld'') and blue (''kék''), and also distinguishes black (''fekete''). Intermediate colors between green and blue are commonly referred to as ''zöldeskék'' (literally greenish-blue) or ''kékeszöld'' (bluish-green), but names for specific colors in this continuum—like turquoise (''türkiz'')—also exist. Particular shades of a color can also have separate names, such as azure (''azúr'').

==Turkic==
The [[Kazakh language]], like many [[Turkic languages]], distinguishes between ''kök'' for blue and ''jasâl'' for green. In Kazakh, many adjectival variations can be found referring to perceived gradations in saturation level of "blue", such as ''kögildir'', ''kökshil'', and ''kökboz'', which respectively denominate the gradual decrease in the intensity, ''kökboz'' being often used as a color referent in its own right. ''Kök'' is occasionally used to denote green plants (e.g. 'kök' shöp'), but such usage is mostly confined to poetic utterances or certain localized dialects.

[[Turkish language|Turkish]] treats dark or navy blue (''lacivert'', from the same Persian root as English ''azure'' and ''[[lapis lazuli]]'') as a separate color from plain or light blue (''mavi''). ''Mavi'' is derived from the Arabic word مائي ''mā'ī'' 'like water' (ماء ''mā''' being the Arabic word for water) and ''lacivert'' is derived from Persian لاجورد ''lājvard'' '[[lapis lazuli]]', a semiprecious stone with the color of navy blue. In the [[Tengrism|pre-Islamic religion of the Turks]], blue is the color that represented the east, as well as the zodiac sign Aquarius (the Water Bearer). A characteristic tone of blue, [[turquoise (color)|turquoise]], was much used by the Turks for their traditional decorations and jewelry.

In traditional pre-Islamic Turkic culture, both blue and green were represented by the same name, ''gök'' 'sky'. The name is still in use in many rural areas. For instance, in many regions of Turkey, when mold is formed on cheese, the phenomenon is called ''gögermek'' 'turning into the color of ''gök''/sky'.

== Dravidian ==
The [[Tamil language]] clearly distinguishes between the colors {{lang|ta|பச்சை}} green (''paccai''), {{lang|ta|நீலம்}} blue (''neelam'') and {{lang|ta|கருப்பு}} black (''karuppu''). The prefix ''karu-'' would indicate dark colors while the suffix ''iḷam'' would indicate light colors. Thus {{lang|ta|கரும்பச்சை}} ''karumpaccai'' would be dark green.

The [[Telugu language]] uses a single word, {{lang-te|పచ్చ}} ''pacca'', for green and yellow. To differentiate between the two shades, another word is prefixed in some cases. For example, green will be called {{lang|te|ఆకుపచ్చ}} ''ākupacca'' "leaf-''pacca''" and yellow {{lang|te|పసుపుపచ్చ}} ''pasupupacca'' "[[turmeric]]-''pacca''".

==East Asian languages==

===Chinese===
The modern [[Chinese language]] has the blue–green distinction ([[wikt:蓝|蓝]]/ [[wikt:藍|藍]] ''lán'' for blue and [[wikt:绿|绿]] / [[wikt:綠|綠]] ''lǜ'' for green); however, [[青|another word]] that predates the modern vernacular, ''qīng'' ({{zh|[[wikt:青|青]]}}), is also used. The [[Chinese character|character]] depicts the budding of a young plant and it could be understood as "[[wikt:verdant|verdant]]", but the word is used to describe colors ranging from light and yellowish green through deep blue all the way to black, as in ''xuánqīng'' ({{zh|{{linktext|玄青}}}}). For example, the [[Flag of the Republic of China]] is today still referred to as ''qīng tiān, bái rì, mǎn dì hóng'' ("'Blue' Sky, White Sun, Whole Ground Red"—{{zh|[[wikt:青|青]]天，白日，滿地紅}}); whereas ''qīngcài'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|青菜}}}}) is the Chinese word for "green [[bok choy]]". A [[cucumber]] is known as either huángguā ({{zh|{{linktext|黃瓜}}}}) "yellow melon" while ({{zh|{{linktext|青瓜}}}}) meaning "green melon" is more commonly used in Cantonese. ''Qīng'' 青 was the traditional designation of both blue and green for much of the history of the Chinese language, while 蓝 ''lán'' ('blue') originally referred to the [[indigo plant]].&lt;ref&gt;The ''Shuowen Jiezi'' defines ''lán'' as 'grass for ''qīng'' dye' (藍，染靑艸也。）&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the character 绿 ''lǜ'' ('green'), as a particular 'shade' of ''qīng'' applied to cloth and clothing,&lt;ref&gt;The ''Shuowen Jiezi'' defines ''lǜ'' as 'cloth of yellowish ''qīng'' color' （綠，帛靑黃色也。）&lt;/ref&gt; has been attested since the ''[[Classic of Poetry|Book of Odes]]'' (1000 to 600 B.C.) (e.g., the title of Ode 27 《邶风·绿衣》 'Green Upper Garment' in the ''Airs of Bei'').  As a part of the adoption of modern [[Vernacular Chinese]] as the social norm, replacing [[Classical Chinese]], the modern terms for blue and green are now more commonly used than ''qīng'' as standalone color terms, although ''qīng'' is still part of many common noun phrases. The two forms can also be encountered combined as 青蓝 and 青绿, with 青 being used as an [[intensifier]].

===Japanese===
[[File:Arrows in Okazaki edit.jpeg|thumb|276px|right|A billboard in [[Okazaki, Aichi]], depicting [[traffic light]]s with a blue, rather than green, 'go' signal. The distinction of blue and green ({{nihongo|''[[ao (color)|ao]]''|[[wikt:青|青]]}}) in Japanese is fluid enough to allow these variances in the depiction of the color.]]
The Japanese word {{nihongo|''[[ao (color)|ao]]''|[[wikt:青|青]]|extra=[[noun|n.]], {{nihongo||[[wikt:青|青]]い|aoi|[[adjective|adj.]]}}}}, the same [[kanji]] character as the Chinese ''qīng'', can refer to either blue or green depending on the situation. Modern [[Japanese language|Japanese]] has a word for {{nihongo|green|[[wikt:緑|緑]]|midori}}, but it is a relatively recent usage.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Ancient Japanese did not have this distinction: the word ''midori'' only came into use in the [[Heian period]], and at that time (and for a long time thereafter) ''midori'' was still considered a shade of ''ao''.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Educational materials distinguishing green and blue only came into use after [[World War II]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.empiricalzeal.com/2012/06/05/the-crayola-fication-of-the-world-how-we-gave-colors-names-and-it-messed-with-our-brains-part-i/ | title=The crayola-fication of the world: How we gave colors names, and it messed with our brains (part I) | first=Aatish | last=Bhatia | website=Empirical Zeal | date=June 5, 2012 | access-date=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus, even though most Japanese consider them to be green, the word ''ao'' is still used to describe certain [[vegetable]]s, [[apple]]s, and [[chlorophyll|vegetation]]. ''Ao'' is also the word used to refer to the color on a [[traffic light]] that signals one to "go".  However, most other objects—a green [[automobile|car]], a green [[sweater]], and so forth—will generally be called ''midori''. Japanese people also sometimes use the word {{nihongo3||グリーン|gurīn}}, based on the English word "green", for colors. The language also has several other words meaning specific shades of green and blue.

===Korean===
The native [[Korean language|Korean]] words {{lang|ko|푸르다}} ([[Revised Romanization]]: ''pureu-da'') or 파랗다 (parah-ta) may mean either blue or green, or bluish green. These adjectives {{lang|ko|푸르다}} and  파랗다 are used for blue as in {{lang|ko|푸른 하늘}} (''pureu-n haneul'')  or 파란 하늘 (para-n haneul) meaning 'blue sky', or for green as in {{lang|ko|푸른 숲}} (''pureu-n sup'', green forest) or 파란 잔디 (parah-n jandi,  green grass). 파란 (paran) is also used for the traffic green light meaning 'go' as in 파란 불 (paran pul). In general, however, 파랗다 "parah-ta" is more associated with blue, and 푸르다 "pureu-da" with green. 푸른 (pur-n) and 파란 (parah-n) are noun-modifying forms, and 파랗다 "parah-ta" can also be used in a noun form; ({{lang|ko|파랑}} ''parang'' [[noun|n.]]). There are Sino-Korean expressions that refer to green and blue. {{lang|ko|초록/草綠}} (''chorok'' [[Adjective|adj.]]/[[noun|n.]]), {{lang|ko|초록색/草綠色}} (''choroksaek'' [[noun|n.]] or for short, {{lang|ko|녹색/綠色}} ''noksaek'' [[noun|n.]]) is used for green. ''Cheong'' {{lang|ko|청/靑}}, another expression borrowed from Chinese ([[pinyin]]: ''qing''), is mostly used for blue, as in 청바지/靑-- (cheong-baji, blue jean" and Cheong Wa Dae ({{lang|ko|청와대}} or [[Hanja]]: {{lang|ko|[[wikt:靑|靑]]瓦臺}}), the [[Blue House]], which is the executive office and official residence of the President of the Republic of Korea, but is also used for green as well, as in 청과물/靑果物 (cheong-gwamul, fruits and vegetables) and 청포도/靑葡萄 (cheong-podo, green grape).

===Tibetan===
In [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]], སྔོན་པོ། ([[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]] sngon po) is the term traditionally given for the color of the sky and of grass.&lt;ref&gt;Yisun Zhang. "Bod rgya tshig mdzod chen mo". University of Virginia: Mi rigs dpe skrun khaṅ. (1993: 718)&lt;/ref&gt; This term also falls into the general pattern of naming colors by appending the suffix "po", as in "mar po" (red); "ser po" (yellow); "nag po" (black); and "dkar po" (white). Conspicuously, the term for "green" is "ljang khu", likely related to "ljang bu", and defined as—"the grue (sngon po) sprout of wheat or barley".&lt;ref&gt;Yisun Zhang. "Bod rgya tshig mdzod chen mo". University of Virginia: Mi rigs dpe skrun khaṅ. (1993: 921)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnamese===
[[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] usually does not use separate words for green and refers to that color using a word that can also refer to [[blue]]. In Vietnamese, blue and green are denoted by ''xanh'' (青). This is a colloquial rendering of ''thanh'' (青), as with Chinese and Japanese. Blue is specifically described as ''xanh'', as in the skin of the sky (''xanh da trời'') or "''xanh'', as in the ocean" (''xanh dương, xanh nước biển'') and green as "''xanh'', as in the leaves" (''xanh lá cây'').

Modern Vietnamese occasionally does employ the terms ''xanh lam'' and ''xanh lục'' (in which the second syllables derive from the Chinese: [[wikt:藍|藍]] and [[wikt:綠|綠]]) for ''blue'' and ''green'', respectively.

===Mongolian===
In [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], the word for green is ногоон (''nogoon''). Mongolian distinguishes between dark and light blue. The word for light blue is цэнхэр (''tsenher'') and the word for dark blue is хөх (''höh'').

== Austronesian languages ==

===Filipino (Tagalog)===
Speakers of [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] most commonly use the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] [[List of loanwords in Tagalog|loanwords]] for blue and green—''asul'' (from Spanish ''azul'') and ''berde'' (from Spanish ''verde''), respectively. Although these words are much more common in spoken use, Tagalog has native terms: ''bugháw'' for blue and ''lunti(án)'' for green, which are seen as archaic and more flowery. These are mostly confined to formal and academic writings, alongside artistic fields such literature, music, and poetry.

In [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], another major [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine language]], the native words for "blue" and "green" end in the same syllable: ''pughaw'' and ''lunhaw'', respectively. Pughaw means sky blue, while lunhaw is fresh leaf green (i.e. neither brownish nor yellowish).

Humour and jokes of a sexual or derogatory nature are called "green" in [[Philippine English]] while they would otherwise be described as "blue" in English (e.g. "[[blue comedy]]", "[[dirty joke|blue joke]]"). This is a [[calque]] of the [[Hispanidad|Hispanic]] term ''chiste verde''.

=== Javanese ===
[[Javanese language|Modern Javanese]] has distinct words for blue ''biru'' and green ''ijo''.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Robson and Singgih Wibisono. ''Javanese English Dictionary''. Hong Kong: Periplus (2002: 97, 278)&lt;/ref&gt; These words are derived from [[Old Javanese language|Old Javanese]] ''birū'' and ''hijo''.&lt;ref&gt;P.J. Zoetmulder with the collaboration of S.O. Robson. ''Old Javanese-English Dictionary''. Leiden: KITLV (1982: 246, 624).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Old Javanese ''birū'' could mean pale blue, greyish blue, greenish blue or even turquoise, while ''hijo'' which means green, could also means the blue-green colour of clear water. ''Biru'' and ''ijo'' in Modern Javanese are cognates of [[Malay language|Malay]]/[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''biru'' and ''hijau'' which have the same meaning.

==Niger-Congo==
The [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] word for green is ''àwö ewéko'', which translates to "color of leaves", and blue is ''àwö sánmà'', which translates to "color of sky".

== Bantu ==
The [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word for blue is ''buluu'', which is derived directly from English and has been in the language for a relatively short time. For other colors, Swahili uses either ''rangi ya ___'' (''the color of ___'') or a shortened version, ''-a ___''. For example, green is ''rangi ya kijani'' or ''rangi ya majani'', which means ''the color of grass/leaves''. Sky blue is ''rangi ya samawati'', or ''the color of the sky'' from the Arabic word for sky. (Note: all of these can be written as ''-a kijani'', ''-a majani'', ''-a samwati'', etc.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://kamusiproject.org/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722065436/http://kamusiproject.org/ |date=July 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zulu language|Zulu]] and [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] use the word ''-luhlaza'' (the prefix changes according to the class of the noun) for ''blue/green''.

[[Tswana language|Tswana]] uses the same word ''tala'' to refer to both blue and green. One has to deduce from the context and prior knowledge, of what is being talked about, to be able to pinpoint exactly the color in question.

The [[Himba people]] use a single word for shades of green and blue: ''buru''. They curiously have only three other colour names, and their color perception has been studied by anthropologists.

==American languages==
The language of the [[Mohawk Nation|Kanien'kehá:ka]] Nation at [[Akwesasne]] is at Stage VII on the [[Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution|Berlin–Kay Scale]], and thus possesses distinct terms for a broad range of [[Spectral color|spectral]] and non-spectral colours, including blue (''oruía''), green (''óhute''), black (''kahúji''), white (''karákA'''), and grey (''atakArókwa''). According to one researcher, the Nation's term for purple (''arihwawakunéha''), which translates to 'bishop['s colour]', a recent coinage.&lt;ref name="Frisch Mohawk"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frisch, Jack A. |title=Mohawk Colour Terms |journal=Anthropological Linguistics |volume=14 |issue=8 |year=1972 |pages=306–310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way in which purple was categorized and referenced prior to the addition of the latter term is not clear.

In the [[Lakota Sioux]] [[Lakota language|language]], the word ''tȟó'' is used for both blue and green, though the word ''tȟózi'' (a mixture of the words ''tȟó'' meaning "blue (green)," and ''zí'' meaning "yellow") has become common (''zítȟo'' can also be used). This is in line with common practice of using ''zíša/šázi'' for Orange (''šá'' meaning "red"), and ''šátȟo/tȟóša'' for "purple/violet."&lt;ref&gt;Ullrich, Jan. (2008). New Lakota Dictionary. Lakota Language Consortium. {{ISBN|0-9761082-9-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Choctaw]] [[Choctaw language|language]] has two words, ''okchʋko'' and ''okchʋmali'', which have different meanings depending on the source. In 1852 ''okchakko'' is translated variously as pale blue or pale green, ''okchakko chohmi'' (''somewhat okchakko'') is given as swarthy, and ''okchamali'' is defined as deep blue, gray, green, or sky blue.&lt;ref&gt;Byington, Cyrus. (1852). An English and Choctaw Definer.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880 ''okchakko'' and ''okchʋmali'' are both given as blue, and green is not specifically listed as a color.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Allen. (1880). Choctaw in English Definition.&lt;/ref&gt; In an 1892 dictionary, ''okchamali'' is deep blue or green, ''okchakko'' is pale blue or bright green, and a third word ''kili̱koba'' is bright green (resembling a ''kili̱kki'', a species of parrot).&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Ben. (1892). Complete Choctaw Definer.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1915, the authoritative Byington dictionary gives ''okchako'' as blue and ''okchamali'' as green, blue, gray, verdant.&lt;ref&gt;Byington, Cyrus. (1915). A Dictionary of the Choctaw Language.&lt;/ref&gt; A current coursebook differentiates based on brightness, giving ''okchʋko'' as bright blue/green and ''okchʋmali'' as pale or dull blue/green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haag|first1=Marcia|last2=Willis|first2=Henry|title=Choctaw language and culture : Chahta Anumpa|date=2001|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman, OK|isbn=978-0-8061-3339-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern usage in the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]] language school is to use ''okchʋko'' for blue and ''okchʋmali'' for green, with no distinction for brightness.

Single words for blue/green are also found in [[Mayan languages]]; for example in the [[Yukatek Maya language]] ''blue/green'' is ''yax''.

[[Tupian languages]] did not originally differ between the two colors, though they may now as a result of interference of Spanish (in the case of [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]]) or Portuguese (in the case of [[Nheengatu language|Nheengatu]]). The [[Old Tupi language|Tupi]] word ''oby'' ({{IPA-all|ɔˈβɨ}}) meant both as does the [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] ''hovy'' ({{IPA-all|hɔʋɨ}}). In modern tupi ([[nheengatu]]) you can use the word "suikiri" for green and "iakira/akira" for blue, but they are still interchangeable, because "iakira/akira" also means immature, as in "pakua akira" (green banana/immature banana), and "suikiri" can also mean blue. In modern [[guarani language|guarani]], they use "hovy" for blue and "hovy'û" (which literally means "dark green/blue) for green. So "hovy" can still be used for green" and "hovy'û" can be used for dark blue shades. They also have the word "aky", cognate with nheengatu "akira", and it means green/immature too.

The Yebamasa of the Rio Piraparana region in [[Vaupés Department]], southeastern [[Colombia]], use the term ''sumese'' for blue/green. The letter "u" is pronounced like the German "ü".&lt;ref&gt;Fieldword Deltgen/Scheffer in 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mapuche language|Mapudungun]] distinguishes between black (''kurü''), blue (''kallfü'') and green (''karü'', also meaning "raw" or "immature"). The word ''payne'' was formerly used to refer to a sky blue, and also refers to the bluish color of stones (Zúñiga, 2006).

'''Caijia''' ({{zh|蔡家话}}) is an endangered [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language spoken in an area centred on [[Bijie]], in the west of the Chinese province of [[Guizhou]]. It was discovered in the 2000s. It has been described by different authors as a relative of [[Bai language|Bai]] or an early branching from [[Old Chinese]]. The autonym is ''{{IPA|men˧˩ni˧}}''.

==Classification==

Similarities among [[Old Chinese]], [[Waxiang Chinese|Waxiang]], Caijia, and [[Bai language|Bai]] have been pointed out by Wu &amp; Shen (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Wu Yunji, Shen Ruiqing [伍云姬、沈瑞清]. 2010. ''An Investigative Report of Waxianghua of Guzhang County, Xiangxi Prefecture'' [湘西古丈瓦乡话调查报告]. Shanghai Educational Press [上海教育出版社].&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_8967627a0101rnbv.html|title=湘西瓦乡话"吃饭"【柔摸】读音来历考_侯小辉_新浪博客|author=|date=|website=blog.sina.com.cn|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_8967627a0101du6j.html|title=沅陵乡话（船溪）与白语蔡家话个别读音对比_侯小辉_新浪博客|author=|date=|website=blog.sina.com.cn|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Zhengzhang Shangfang]] (2010) argued that Bai and Caijia formed a [[Greater Bai languages|Greater Bai]] subgroup of Sino-Tibetan.&lt;ref name="Zhengzhang2010"&gt;Zhèngzhāng Shàngfāng [郑张尚芳]. 2010. Càijiāhuà Báiyǔ guānxì jí cígēn bǐjiào [蔡家话白语关系及词根比较]. In Pān Wǔyún and Shěn Zhōngwěi [潘悟云、沈钟伟] (eds.). Yánjūzhī Lè, The Joy of Research [研究之乐-庆祝王士元先生七十五寿辰学术论文集], II, 389–400. Shanghai: Shanghai Educational Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt;
Caijia also appears to be related to the extinct [[Longjia language|Longjia]] and [[Luren language|Luren]] languages,&lt;ref name="Guizhou1984"/&gt; but they are too poorly documented for definitive classification.

In contrast, Sagart (2011) groups Caijia with [[Waxiang Chinese|Waxiang]], a divergent Chinese variety spoken in northwestern [[Hunan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Talk given at Centre de recherches linguistiques sur l’Asie orientale, Norgent sur Marne.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sagart (2011) lists the following features of Old Chinese retained by both Caijia and Waxiang:
*[[Old Chinese|OC]] *lˤ- and *lr- &gt; Caijia and Waxiang l- (where [[Middle Chinese]] has d-), as in OC *lˤiŋ ({{linktext|田}}) &gt; Caijia len³¹, Waxiang lɛ¹³ 'field'
*[[Old Chinese|OC]] *r- &gt; Caijia ɣ- and Waxiang z- (where Middle Chinese has l-), as in OC *mə.rˤək ({{linktext|來}}) &gt; *rˤə &gt; Caijia ɣɯ³¹, Waxiang zɛ¹³ 'to come'
Sagart identifies two words as shared innovations:
*'two': Caijia ta⁵⁵, Waxiang tso⁵³, from OC *tsˤə(ʔ)-s 'twice' ({{linktext|再}})
*'milk': Caijia mi⁵⁵, Waxiang mi⁵⁵, which Sagart (2011) suggests is a non-Sinitic word

''"Caijia" minzu chengfen diaocha baogao'' ["蔡家"民族成分调查报告]. m.s.&lt;/ref&gt; reports the Caijia people are found in the seven counties of [[Bijie]] prefecture – [[Qixingguan District|Qixingguan]], [[Dafang County|Dafang]], [[Qianxi County, Guizhou|Qianxi]], [[Zhijin County|Zhijin]], [[Nayong County|Nayong]], [[Weining County|Weining]], and [[Hezhang County|Hezhang]] – comprising a total of over 3,100 households and over 18,000 individuals. Bijie (1983) reports that smaller populations of Caijia people are found in [[Anshun]] (with over 400 people) and [[Liupanshui]] (with over 3,500 people) prefectures (to the southeast and southwest respectively), as well as [[Zhaoyang District|Zhaoyang]], [[Yiliang County, Zhaotong|Yiliang]], and [[Zhenxiong County|Zhenxiong]] counties in [[Zhaotong]] prefecture, Yunnan (to the northwest). Bijie (1983) also contains linguistic data for the Caijia language of Hezhang County.

Caijia speakers are distributed in the following locations in Bijie prefecture (Bo Wenze 2004).&lt;ref name="Bo2004"&gt;Bo Wenze (2004). [http://d.wanfangdata.com.cn/periodical_mzyw200402012.aspx 蔡家话概况]. 北京大学外国语学院东语系.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialects===
Guizhou (1982) lists the following two dialects of the Caijia language.&lt;ref name="Guizhou1982"&gt;Guizhou provincial ethnic classification commission, linguistic division [贵州省民族识别工作队语言组]. 1982. ''The language of the Caijia'' [''Caijia de yuyan'' 蔡家的语言]. m.s.&lt;/ref&gt; The Caijia dialect documented in Guizhou (1982) is that of Yangjiazhai 杨家寨, Liangyan Village 亮岩公社, Xingfa District 兴发区, [[Hezhang County]].
#Xingfa District 兴发区, Hezhang County: Liangyan Village 亮岩公社 (including the main datapoint of Yangjiazhai 杨家寨), Yeli Village 野里公社, and Wocun Village 窝皮寸&lt;ref&gt;Note: 皮寸 form a single character, with 皮 on the left and 寸 on the right&lt;/ref&gt;
#Kaiping Village 开坪公社, Longchang District 龙场区, [[Weining County]] (located near Xinfa Township 新发布依族乡)

Guizhou (1982)&lt;ref name="Guizhou1982"/&gt; notes that the -''an'' [[Syllable rime|rime]] in Caijia of Xingfa 兴发 corresponds to the ''-aŋ'' rime in Caijia of Longchang 龙场.

Hsiu (2018)&lt;ref name="Hsiu2018"&gt;Hsiu, Andrew. 2018. [https://zenodo.org/record/1249165/files/Caijia_dialects_2.pdf The Niujiaojing dialect of Caijia in Weining County, Guizhou, China]. Manuscript draft. {{doi|10.5281/zenodo.1249165}}&lt;/ref&gt; reports the discovery of a previously undocumented Caijia dialect that is spoken in Niujiaojing 牛角井村, Yangjie Town 羊街镇, Weining County. This Caijia dialect is also spoken in the villages of Xinglongchang 兴隆场村, Niuchishui 牛吃水, and Fadi 发地.

===Names and ethnic subdivisions===
The Caijia people are ethnoculturally related to the [[List of unrecognized ethnic groups of Guizhou|Lu (卢)]] people (''Luren'' 卢人), who are classified as Manchu by the Chinese government. [[Luren language|Luren]] (Lu) and Caijia are also closely related to [[Longjia language|Longjia]] (龙家).&lt;ref name="Gazetteer"&gt;Guizhou Province Gazetteer: Ethnic Gazetteer [贵州省志. 民族志] (2002). Guiyang: Guizhou Ethnic Publishing House [貴州民族出版社].&lt;/ref&gt; Caijia, Longjia, and Lu are all spoken in western [[Guizhou#Demographics|Guizhou]].

In [[Weining County]], Caijia speakers are officially classified by the Chinese government as ethnic [[Gelao people|Gelao]] (Hsiu 2017), while in [[Hezhang County]] they are classified as [[Bai people|Bai]] (Bo 2004).

Caijia people with the autonym "Menni" (门尼 or 门你) have also been reported in [[Puding County]], Guizhou, where they were classified as ethnic [[Gelao people|Gelao]] during the 1980s (Zhou Guoyan 2004).

In [[Zhijin County]], Guizhou, Caijia people are called Silie 斯列 by the local Miao and Awuna 阿乌纳 by the local Yi (''Zhijin County Almanac'' 1997:166).

Ethnic subdivisions of the Caijia people include the Black 黑, White 白, Qingshangshui 青上水, Xiashui 下水, Hanzhan 捍毡, Zhuazhua 抓抓, Datou 大头, Qianqiaoba 乾乔巴, Laohu 老虎, Luoluo 倮倮, Xuejiao 削角 (Xieguo 写果), and Jiandao 剪刀.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_48fa33d90100a6jf.html|title=白族家园——讲义寨_liyuzhi_新浪博客|author=|date=|website=blog.sina.com.cn|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically recorded names for the Caijia include Caijiazi 蔡家子 and Gantan Caijia 擀毡蔡家.&lt;ref name="Liupanshui"/&gt; The Yi call the Caijia "Sha'awu 沙阿乌", the Miao call them "Sini 斯你",&lt;ref name="Liupanshui"/&gt; and other ethnic groups also call them "Xieguo 写果".&lt;ref name="Liupanshui"/&gt;

Bijie (1983:2-3)&lt;ref name="Bijie1983"/&gt; lists the following [[exonym and endonym|autonyms and exonyms]] for the Caijia people.
*Autonym: Menni 门你 ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: ''men31 ȵen33'')
*[[Yi people|Yi]] (in [[Dafang County]] and [[Zhijin County]]) exonym: Xieguo, Awuna 阿武哪
*[[Yi people|Yi]] (in [[Shuicheng County]]) exonym: Awuna 阿乌纳

'''Children's street culture''' refers to the cumulative [[culture]] created by young [[children]]. Collectively, this body of knowledge is passed down from one generation of urban children to the next, and can also be passed between different groups of children (e.g. in the form of [[fad|craze]]s, but also in intergenerational mixing). It is most common in children between the ages of seven and twelve. It is strongest in urban [[working class]] [[industrial district]]s where children are traditionally free to "play out" in the streets for long periods without supervision.

Children's street culture is invented and largely sustained by children themselves, although it may come to incorporate fragments of [[media culture]] and toys in its activities.  It is not to be confused with the commercial [[Mass media|media]]-culture produced ''for'' children (e.g., [[comics]], [[television]], mass-produced [[toy]]s, and clothing), although it may overlap.

==Location and play materials==

Young children's street culture usually takes place on quiet backstreets and sidewalks, and along routes that venture out into local [[park]]s, [[playground]]s, scrub and wasteland, and to local shops. It can often incorporate many found and scavenged materials such as old car seats, tyres, planks, bricks, etc. Sometimes found materials will be combined to create objects (e.g. making [[Guy Fawkes#Popularity|guys]] for [[Guy Fawkes Night]] &amp;mdash; ''see Beck 1984'').  Play will often incorporate [[fad|craze]]s (sometimes incorporating seasonal elements that are freely collected, such as [[conkers]], snowballs, sycamore seeds). It also imposes imaginative status on certain sections of the urban realm (local buildings, street objects, road layouts, etc.). In summer children may use scavenged materials to create a temporary and semi-hidden "den" or "hideout" or "HQ" in a marginal area near their homes, that serves as an informal meeting and relaxation place during the summer (see: Sobel, 2001). An urban area that looks faceless or neglected to an adult may have deep "[[spirit of place]]" meanings in children's street culture.

==History and research==

Although it varies from place to place, research shows that it appears to share many commonalities across many cultures. It is a traditional phenomenon that has been closely investigated and documented in the western world during the 20th century by [[anthropologist]]s and [[folklore|folklorists]] such as [[Iona Opie]]; [[street photography|street photographers]] such as [[Roger Mayne]], [[Helen Levitt]], [[David Trainer]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060430124026/http://www.boltonmuseums.org.uk/html/spender/images_gallery_children_01.html Humphrey Spender] and [[Robert Doisneau]]; urbanists such as [[Colin Ward]] and [[Robin C. Moore|Robin Moore]], as well as being described in countless novels of childhood. The research of Robin Moore stresses children's need for 'marginal' unsupervised areas 'within running distance' of homes (scrubby bushes and  hedges, disused buildings).  There are now two academic journals devoted to this area, the [http://journalsonline.tandf.co.uk/openurl.asp?genre=journal&amp;issn=1473-3285 ''Journal of Children's Geographies''] and [http://museumvictoria.com.au/About/Books-and-Journals/Journals/Play-and-Folklore/ ''Play &amp; Folklore''].

It has occasionally been central to feature films, such as the ''[[Our Gang]]'' ("Little Rascals") series, [[Ealing Studios|Ealing]]'s ''[[Hue and Cry (film)|Hue and Cry]]'' (1947) and some [http://tv.cream.org/lookin/cff/index.htm Children's Film Foundation] films such as ''Go Kart, Go!'' and ''Soap Box Derby''.

Since the advent of distractions such as [[video games]], and [[television]], concerns have been expressed about the vitality - or even the survival - of children's street culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/03/hey-parents-leave-those-kids-alone/358631/|title=The Overprotected Kid|quote=The child culture from my Queens days, with its own traditions and codas, its particular pleasures and distresses, is virtually extinct.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's urban legends==

Many informal groups of small children will develop some level of superstitious beliefs about their local area. For instance, they may believe that there are certain places that are "unlucky" to step on (e.g.: certain large cracks in a sidewalk) or touch (e.g.: gateposts of a certain colour) or pass beyond (such as the end of the [[sidewalk]], beyond which is another [[Parallel universe (fiction)|dimension]] inhabited by the [[bogeyman]]), or that an old woman is a "[[witch]]", or that an abandoned house is "haunted". But in some extreme circumstances a consistent myth may emerge among young children, and across a large area. One example dates from 1997; the ''[[Miami New Times]]'' published Lynda Edwards' report "Myths Over Miami",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1997-06-05/news/myths-over-miami/ |title=Myths Over Miami |author=Lynda Edwards |date=5 June 1997 |publisher=Miami New Times |accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes a huge consistent mythology spreading among young [[homeless]] children in the American South. The story has been picked up and reprinted many times on internet blogs and websites.&lt;ref&gt;Allie Conti, [http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/how-a-1997-new-times-feature-on-homeless-kids-folklore-exploded-the-internet-6551125 How a 1997 New Times Feature on Homeless Kids' Folklore Exploded the Internet.] ''New Times'', September 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no known verification or confirmation that the mythology she describes actually exists, but these "secret stories" are clearly based on known elements of street culture, such as labeling certain places "haunted" or recycling legends of dangerous spirits such as [[Bloody Mary (folklore)|Bloody Mary]]. The article was the basis for [[Mercedes Lackey]]'s novel ''Mad Maudlin'', co-written with [[Rosemary Edghill]].

'''Asian cinema''' refers to the [[Film industry|film industries]] and [[film]]s produced in the continent of [[Asia]], and is also sometimes known as '''Eastern cinema'''. More commonly, however, it is most often used to refer to the cinema of [[East Asia|Eastern]], [[Southeast Asia|Southeastern]] and [[South Asia|Southern Asia]]. [[West Asian cinema]] is sometimes classified as part of [[Cinema of the Middle East|Middle Eastern]] cinema, along with the [[cinema of Egypt]]. The [[cinema of Central Asia]] is often grouped with the Middle East or, in the past, the [[cinema of the Soviet Union]] during the [[Soviet Central Asia]] era. [[North Asia]] is dominated by [[Siberia]]n [[Cinema of Russia|Russian cinema]], and is thus considered part of [[European cinema]].

[[East Asian cinema]] is typified by the [[cinema of Japan]], [[Cinema of China|China]], [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[cinema of Taiwan|Taiwan]], and [[Cinema of South Korea|South Korea]], including the Japanese [[anime]] industry and [[Hong Kong action cinema|action films of Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=David|title=East Asian Cinema|date=May 15, 2007|publisher=Oldcastle Books Ltd|pages=315 Pages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nydlzbe2LhEC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Asian cinema]] is typified by the [[cinema of India]] (including [[Bollywood]], [[South Indian film industry|South Indian]], [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali]] and [[Punjabi cinema]]), the [[cinema of Pakistan]] (including Punjabi and [[Urdu cinema]]), the [[cinema of Bangladesh]] (Bengali cinema), and the [[cinema of Nepal]]. [[Southeast Asian cinema]] is typified by the cinema of the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], and other Southeast Asian countries. The [[cinema of Central Asia]] and the [[southern Caucasus]] is typified by [[Iranian cinema]] and the [[cinema of Tajikistan]]. [[West Asia]]n cinema is typified by [[Arab cinema]], [[Iranian cinema]], [[cinema of Israel|Israeli cinema]], [[Jewish cinema]], and [[Turkish cinema]].

[[Mo-Ti]], a [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosopher]] ''circa'' 500 BC, pondered the phenomenon of inverted light from the outside world beaming through a small hole in the opposite wall in a darkened room. [[Shadow play]]s first appeared during the [[Han Dynasty]] and later gain popularity across [[Asia]]. Around 180 AD, [[Ting Huan]] (丁緩) created an elementary [[zoetrope]] in China.

In 1021, [[Alhazen]], an [[Science in medieval Islam|Iraqi scientist]], experimented with the same [[Optics|optical]] [[principle]] described by Mo-Ti, and wrote of the results in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'', which provided the first clear description&lt;ref name=Kelley&gt;David H.

===Silent film era===
The first short films from Asia were produced during the 1890s. The first short films produced in Japan were ''Bake Jizo'' (''Jizo the Spook'') and ''Shinin no Sosei'' (''Resurrection of a Corpse''), both from 1898.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seekjapan.jp/article-1/765/J-Horror:+An+Alternative+Guide Seek Japan | J-Horror: An Alternative Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; The first Indian short film was also produced in 1898, ''The Flower of Persia'', directed by [[Hiralal Sen]].&lt;ref name="Hiralal2"&gt;{{cite web |last = McKernan	|first = Luke|date = 1996-12-31|url = http://www.victorian-cinema.net/sen.htm|title = Hiralal Sen (copyright British Film Institute)|accessdate = 2006-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s, [[State of Israel|Israeli]] silent movies were screened in sheds, cafes and other temporary structures.&lt;ref name="boeliem2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeliem.com/content/2007/783.html |title=Cinemas in Eretz Yisrael |last=Shalit |first=David |work=Boeliem.com |date=January 3, 2011 |accessdate=August 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, Cafe Lorenz opened on Jaffa Road in the Jewish neighborhood of [[Neve Tzedek]]. From 1909, the Lorenz family began screening movies at the cafe. In 1925, the Kessem Cinema was housed there for a short time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paraszczuk |first=Joanna |url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/FrontLines/Article.aspx?id=177436 |title=Reviving Tel Aviv's Valhalla |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=June 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first East Asian [[feature film]] was Japan's ''The Life Story of Tasuke Shiobara'' (1912). It was followed by India's first feature-length silent film, the [[period piece]] drama ''[[Raja Harishchandra]]'' (1913), by [[Dadasaheb Phalke]], considered the father of [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]]. By the next decade, the output of Indian cinema was an average of 27 films per year.  On the other hand, in the Philippines, the first film produced and made in the Philippines was La Vida de Jose Rizal in 1912 by Edward Meyer Gross. [[José Nepomuceno]],  bought his first film equipment from Albert Yearsley and Edward Meyer Gross on May 15, 1917 and for the next two years, Nepomuceno practiced using the equipment in preparation for making the first locally produced feature film of the Philippines. The first locally produced film in the Philippines is [[Dalagang Bukid]]. The film was released with English, Spanish, and Tagalog subtitles. During its theatrical run, leading actress [[Atang de la Rama]] had to sing ''Nabasag ang Banga'' (a song which is a part of the film) for every screening of the film in Manila, along with three others playing a violin, a [[cornet]], and a piano&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/138317/article-1G1-179133604/jose-nepomuceno-and-creation-filipino-national-consciousness|title=Jose Nepomuceno Father of Philippine Cinema|accessdate=2014-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, the newborn [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet cinema]] was the most radically innovative. There, the craft of editing, especially, surged forward, going beyond its previous role in advancing a story. [[Sergei Eisenstein]] perfected the technique of so-called [[intellectual montage|dialectical or intellectual montage]], which strove to make [[Nonlinear (arts)|non-linear]], often violently clashing, images express ideas and provoke emotional and intellectual reactions in the viewer.

[[Jewish cinema]], particularly the Yiddish theater of [[Ashkenazi Jews]], made its mark from the 1930s onward. Over 100 films were made in Yiddish, although many are now lost. Prominent films included ''[[Shulamith (1931 film)|Shulamith]]'' (1931), the first Yiddish musical on film ''[[His Wife's Lover]]'' (1931), ''[[A Daughter of Her People]]'' (1932), the anti-Nazi film ''[[Wandering Jew|The Wandering Jew]]'' (1933), ''The [[Yiddish King Lear (film)|Yiddish King Lear]]'' (1934), ''[[Shir Hashirim (film)|Shir Hashirim]]'' (1935), the biggest Yiddish film hit of all time ''[[Yidl Mitn Fidl]]'' (1936), ''[[Where Is My Child?]]'' (1937), ''[[Green Fields]]'' (1937), ''[[The Dybbuk (play)|Dybuk]]'' (1937), ''[[The Singing Blacksmith]]'' (1938), ''[[Tevya (film)|Tevya]]'' (1939), ''[[Mirele Efros]]'' (1939), ''[[Lang ist der Weg]]'' (1948), and ''[[God, Man and Devil]]'' (1950). Additionally, the films of the [[Marx Brothers]], [[Mel Brooks]], and [[Woody Allen]] have left a lasting mark on cinema.

===Early sound era===
[[Sound film]]s began being produced in Asia from the 1930s. Notable early talkies from the [[cinema of Japan]] included Kenji Mizoguchi's ''[[Sisters of the Gion]]'' (''Gion no shimai'', 1936), ''[[Osaka Elegy]]'' (1936) and ''[[The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums]]'' (1939), along with [[Sadao Yamanaka]]'s ''[[Humanity and Paper Balloons]]'' (1937) and [[Mikio Naruse]]'s ''Wife, Be Like A Rose!'' (''Tsuma Yo Bara No Yoni'', 1935), which was one of the first Japanese films to gain a theatrical release in the U.S. However, with increasing censorship, the left-leaning [[tendency film]]s of directors such as Daisuke Ito also began to come under attack.  A few Japanese sound shorts were made in the 1920s and 1930s, but Japan's first feature-length talkie was ''Fujiwara Yoshie no furusato'' (1930), which used the 'Mina Talkie System'. In 1935, [[Yasujirō Ozu]] also directed ''An Inn in Tokyo'', considered a precursor to the [[Neorealism (art)|neorealism]] genre.

[[Ardeshir Irani]] released ''[[Alam Ara]]'', the first Indian talking film, on March 14, 1931. Following the inception of 'talkies' in India some film stars were highly sought after and earned comfortable incomes through acting. As sound technology advanced the 1930s saw the rise of music in Indian cinema with musicals such as ''Indra Sabha'' and ''Devi Devyani'' marking the beginning of song-and-dance in India's films.&lt;ref name=Burra&amp;Rao253&gt;Burra &amp; Rao, 253&lt;/ref&gt; Studios emerged across major cities such as [[Chennai]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Mumbai]] as filmmaking became an established craft by 1935, exemplified by the success of ''[[Devdas (1935 film)|Devdas]]'', which had managed to enthrall audiences nationwide.&lt;ref name=Burra&amp;Rao254&gt;Burra &amp; Rao, 254&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golden Age===
Following the end of [[World War II]] by the mid-1940s, the period from the late 1940s to the 1960s is considered the 'Golden Age' of Asian cinema.&lt;ref name=Totaro&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The "Sight &amp; Sound" of Canons|first=Donato|last=Totaro|journal=Offscreen Journal|publisher=[[Canada Council|Canada Council for the Arts]]|date=January 31, 2003|url=http://www.horschamp.qc.ca/new_offscreen/canon.html|accessdate=2009-04-19|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite web|title=A Slanted Canon|author=Kevin Lee|publisher=Asian American Film Commentary|date=2002-09-05|url=http://www.asianamericanfilm.com/archives/000026.html|accessdate=2009-04-24|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/684ysTg3l?url=http://www.asianamericanfilm.com/archives/000026.html|archive-date=2012-05-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Daniels&gt;{{cite web|title=Hybrid Cinematics: Rethinking the role of filmmakers of color in American Cinema|author=Tracy K.

During [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese cinema]]'s 'Golden Age' of the 1950s and 1960s, successful films included ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' (1950), ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'' (1958) by [[Akira Kurosawa]], as well as [[Yasujirō Ozu]]'s ''[[Tokyo Story]]'' (1953) and [[Ishirō Honda]]'s ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1954).&lt;ref&gt;Dave Kehr, [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/20/movies/film-anime-japanese-cinema-s-second-golden-age.html Anime, Japanese Cinema's Second Golden Age], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 20, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These films have had a profound influence on world cinema. In particular, Kurosawa's ''Seven Samurai'' has been remade several times as [[Western (genre)|Western films]], such as ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' (1960) and ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980), and has also inspired several [[Bollywood]] films, such as ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) and ''[[China Gate (1998 film)|China Gate]]'' (1998). ''Rashomon'' was also remade as ''[[The Outrage]]'' (1964), and inspired films with "[[Rashomon effect]]" storytelling methods, such as ''[[Andha Naal]]'' (1954), ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995) and ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' (2002). ''The Hidden Fortress'' was also the inspiration behind [[George Lucas]]' ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977). The [[Japanese New Wave]] began in the late 1950s and continued into the 1960s. Other famous Japanese filmmakers from this period include [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Mikio Naruse]], [[Hiroshi Inagaki]] and [[Nagisa Oshima]].&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; Japanese cinema later became one of the main inspirations behind the [[New Hollywood]] movement of the 1960s to 1980s.

During [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]]'s 'Golden Age' of the 1950s and 1960s, it was producing 200 films annually, while [[Parallel Cinema|Indian independent films]] gained greater recognition through international [[film festival]]s. One of the most famous was ''[[The Apu Trilogy]]'' (1955–1959) from critically acclaimed [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali film]] director [[Satyajit Ray]], whose films had a profound influence on world cinema, with directors such as Akira Kurosawa,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The [[cinema of China]] experienced a 'Golden Age' in the late 1940s. In 1946, Cai Chusheng returned to Shanghai to revive the Lianhua name as the "Lianhua Film Society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/directors_ccwlc.html#cai |title=Chinese Cinema - Cai Chusheng |accessdate=2007-04-25 |author=Zhang Yingjin |date=2007-01-04 |publisher=University of California-San Diego |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307193958/http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/directors_ccwlc.html#cai |archivedate=2007-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn became Kunlun Studios which would go on to become one of the most important Chinese studios of the era, putting out the classics, ''Myriads of Lights'' (1948), ''[[The Spring River Flows East]]'' (1947), and ''[[Crows and Sparrows]]'' (1949).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/organisation/13907 | title =  Kunlun Film Company| accessdate = 2007-04-25| author =  |year= 2004| publisher = British Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wenhua's romantic drama ''[[Spring in a Small Town]]'' (1948), a film by director [[Fei Mu]] shortly prior to the revolution, is often regarded by Chinese film critics as one of the most important films in the history of Chinese cinema, with it being named by the [[Hong Kong Film Awards]] in 2004 as the greatest Chinese-language film ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.hkfaa.com/news/100films.html | title =  Welcome to the Hong Kong Film Awards| accessdate = 2007-04-04 | author =  |year= 2004| publisher =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cinema of Malaysia]] also had its 'Golden Age' in the post-war period of the 1950s and 1960s. The period saw the introduction of the studio system of filmmaking in Malaysia and influx of influences from [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], the emerging [[cinema of Hong Kong]], and particularly the Indian and Japanese film industries which were themselves experiencing a Golden Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Malaysian cinema, Asian film: border crossings and national cultures|first=William|last=Van der Heide|publisher=[[Amsterdam University Press]]|year=2002|pages=132–45|isbn=90-5356-580-9|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Historical Poetics, Malaysian Cinema, and the Japanese Occupation |first=Timothy |last=White |journal=Kinema: A Journal for Film and Audiovisual Media |date=19 November 2002 |url=http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/white962.htm |accessdate=2009-05-23 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913062618/http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/white962.htm |archivedate=September 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the quality and quantity of filmmaking had increased rapidly by the end of the 1950s. South Korean films, such as Lee Byeong-il's 1956 comedy ''Sijibganeun nal (The Wedding Day)'', had begun winning international awards. In contrast to the beginning of the 1950s, when only 5 movies were made per year, 111 films were produced in South Korea in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Darcy Paquet|title=1945-1959|publisher=Korean Film Page|url=http://koreanfilm.org/kfilm45-59.html|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The year 1960 saw the production of Kim Ki-young's ''[[The Housemaid (1960 film)|The Housemaid]]'' and [[Yu Hyun-mok]]'s ''[[Obaltan|Aimless Bullet]]'', both of which have been listed among the best Korean films ever made.&lt;ref&gt;Min, p.46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The late 1950s and 1960s was also a 'Golden Age' for [[Cinema of the Philippines|Philippine cinema]], with the emergence of more artistic and mature films, and significant improvement in cinematic techniques among filmmakers. The studio system produced frenetic activity in the local film industry as many films were made annually and several local talents started to earn recognition abroad. One such honor was bestowed to [[Manuel Conde]]'s  immortal movie ''[[Genghis Khan (1950 film)|Gengis Khan]]'' (1950) when it was accepted for screening at the [[13th Venice Film Festival]].  Other awards include Gerardo de Leon's "Ifugao" (1954) and Lamberto Avellana's "[[Child of Sorrow (film)|Anak Dalita]]". By the end of the decade Philippine cinema had developed into a major force in the Asian region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbirth.com/philippines.html|title=History of Cinema in PHILIPPINES|accessdate=2014-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916104601/http://www.filmbirth.com/philippines.html|archive-date=2014-09-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premiere Philippine directors of the era included [[Gerardo de Leon]], [[Gregorio Fernandez]], [[Eddie Romero]], [[Lamberto Avellana]], and [[Cirio Santiago]].&lt;ref name="curtain"&gt;[http://www.philnews.com/2005/wa.html Is the Curtain Finally Falling on the Philippine Kovie Industry?].

The 1960s is often cited as being the 'golden age' of [[Cinema of Pakistan|Pakistani cinema]]. Many A-stars were introduced in this period in time and became legends on the [[silver screen]]. As black-and-white became obsolete, Pakistan saw the introduction of its first colour films, the first being Munshi Dil's ''[[Azra]]'' in early 1960s, Zahir Rehan's ''Sangam'' (first full-length coloured film) in 1964, and ''[[Mala (1965 film)|Mala]]'' (first coloured cinemascope film). In 1961, the political film ''Bombay Wallah'' was released, based on the city of [[Mumbai|Bombay]] in neighbouring India, in the wake of the growing tension between the nations.&lt;ref name="CITEREFScriptnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scriptnet.org.uk/_charity/Pages/Pakistan/Pakistan_film-background.php|title=History of Lollywood|publisher=Scripnet Charity|accessdate=2008-07-06}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, ''Shaheed'' (''Martyr'') pronounced the [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] issue on the silver screen and became an instant hit, leading to a changing tide in the attitude of filmmakers.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The 1960s was the "golden age" of [[Cinema of Cambodia|Cambodian cinema]]. Several production companies were started and more movie theaters were built throughout the country. More than 300 movies were made in Cambodia during the era.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2006/01/06/2003287766 "Cambodian films are undergoing a rebirth"], [[Associated Press]], January 6, 2006. (Retrieved from ''[[Taipei Times]]'' website on December 24, 2006.)&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[Khmer language]] films were well received in its neougbouring countries at the time.&lt;ref name = "Cambodia's film industry rebounds, but it's schlock vs. art"&gt;[http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Soc/soc.culture.cambodia/2006-01/msg00030.html], NEWSGROUP.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the classic films from [[Cambodia]] during this period were ''Lea Haey Duong Dara'' (''Goodbye Duong Dara'') and ''[[The Snake King's Wife|Pos Keng Kang]]'' (''The Snake King's Wife'') by Tea Lim Kun and Sabbseth, and ''[[An Euil Srey An]]'' (''Khmer After Angkor'') by Ly Bun Yim.

The range of Jewish entrepreneurs in the American film industry is considerable: Samuel Goldwyn, Louis B. Mayer, the Warner Brothers, David O. Selznick, Marcus Loew, and Adolph Zukor, Fox, and so forth. A more specifically Jewish sensibility can be seen in the films of the Marx Brothers, Mel Brooks, or Woody Allen; other examples of specifically Jewish films from the Hollywood film industry are the Barbra Streisand vehicle Yentl (1983), or John Frankenheimer's The Fixer (1968). In 1966, 2.6 million Israelis went to the cinema over 50 million times. From 1968, when [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|television broadcasting]] began, theaters began to close down, first in the periphery, then in major cities. 330 standalone theaters were torn down or redesigned as multiplex theaters.&lt;ref name="boeliem2007"/&gt;

===Modern era===
By the late '60s and early '70s, [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese cinema]] had begun to become seriously affected by the collapse of the studio system.  As Japanese cinema slipped into a period of relative low visibility, the cinema of Hong Kong entered a dramatic renaissance of its own, largely a side effect of the development of the ''wuxia'' blending of action, history, and spiritual concerns. Several major figures emerged in Hong Kong at this time - perhaps most famously, [[King Hu]], whose 1966 ''[[Come Drink With Me]]'' was a key influence upon many subsequent Hong Kong cinematic developments.  Shortly thereafter, the American-born [[Bruce Lee]] became a global icon in the 1970s.

From 1969 onwards, the [[Iranian New Wave]] led to the growth of [[Cinema of Iran|Iranian cinema]], which would later go on to achieve international acclaim in the 1980s and 1990s. The most notable figures of the Iranian New Wave are [[Abbas Kiarostami]], [[Jafar Panahi]], [[Majid Majidi]], [[Bahram Beizai]], [[Darius Mehrjui]], [[Mohsen Makhmalbaf]], [[Masoud Kimiay]], [[Sohrab Shahid-Saless]], [[Parviz Kimiavi]], [[Samira Makhmalbaf]], [[Amir Naderi]], and [[Abolfazl Jalili]]. Features of New Wave Iranian film, in particular the works of Kiarostami, have been classified by some as [[postmodern]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.ie/~galfilm/filmwest/32abbas.htm Abbas Kiarostami ? The Truth Behind Reality]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970s also saw the establishment of [[Cinema of Bangladesh|Bangladeshi cinema]] following the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|country's independence]] in 1971. One of the first films produced in [[Bangladesh]] after independence was ''[[Titash Ekti Nadir Naam]]'' (''A River Called Titas'') in 1973 by acclaimed director [[Ritwik Ghatak]], whose stature in [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali cinema]] is comparable to that of [[Satyajit Ray]] and [[Mrinal Sen]]. Another great film of Bangladesh is Mita's 'Lathial' (The striker), were the best movies of the year of 1975. 'Lathial' got first National Award as the best film, and mita got first National Award as best director.

In the [[cinema of India]], the 1970s saw a decline in '[[Parallel Cinema]]' and the rise of commercial [[Bollywood|Hindi cinema]] in the form of enduring [[Masala (film genre)|''masala'' films]], such as the [[Mumbai underworld]] film ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975) and "[[Curry Western]]" movie ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), which solidified [[Amitabh Bachchan]]'s position as a lead actor. Commercial cinema further grew throughout the 1980s and the 1990s with the release of films such as ''[[Mr. India (1987 film)|Mr. India]]'' (1987),  ''[[Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak]]'' (1988), ''[[Tezaab]]'' (1988), ''[[Chandni]]'' (1989),  ''[[Maine Pyar Kiya]]'' (1989), ''[[Baazigar]]'' (1993), ''[[Darr]]'' (1993), ''[[Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!]]'' (1994) and ''[[Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge]]'' (1995).&lt;ref name=Rajadhyaksa96-688&gt;Rajadhyaksa, 688&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, Japanese cinema - aided by the rise of independent filmmaking and the spectacular success of [[anime]] - began to make something of an international comeback.  Simultaneously, a new post-[[Mao Zedong]] generation of [[Chinese film]]makers began to gain global attention.  Another group of filmmakers, centered around [[Edward Yang]] and [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]], launched what has become known as the "Taiwanese New Wave".

The 1980s is also considered the Golden Age of [[Hong Kong action cinema]]. [[Jackie Chan]] reinvented the [[martial arts film]] genre with a new emphasis on elaborate and dangerous stunts and slapstick humour, beginning with ''[[Project A]]'' (1983). [[John Woo]] began the "[[heroic bloodshed]]" genre based on [[Triad (underground society)|triads]], beginning with ''[[A Better Tomorrow]]'' (1986). The [[Hong Kong New Wave]] also occurred during this period, led by filmmakers such as [[Tsui Hark]].

With the post-1980 rise in popularity of East Asian cinema in the West, Western audiences are again becoming familiar with many of the industry's filmmakers and stars. A number of these key players, such as [[Chow Yun-fat]] and [[Zhang Ziyi]], have "crossed over", working in Western films. Others have gained exposure through the international success of their films, though many more retain more of a "[[Cult film|cult]]" appeal, finding a degree of Western success through DVD sales rather than cinema releases.

In the modern era, the success of [[Israeli cinema|Israeli]] and [[Jewish cinema|diaspora Jewish]] cinema can be observed in industry giants ranging from [[Michael Ovitz]], [[Michael Eisner]], [[Lew Wasserman]], [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Steven Spielberg]], and [[David Geffen]]. However, few of these ever focused on Jewish issues with the sometime exception of Spielberg. In the first decade of the 21st century, several Israeli films won awards in film festivals around the world. Prominent films of this period include ''[[Late Marriage (film)|Late Marriage]]'' ([[Dover Koshashvili]]), ''[[Broken Wings (film)|Broken Wings]]'', ''[[Walk on Water (film)|Walk on Water]]'' and ''[[Yossi &amp; Jagger]]'' ([[Eytan Fox]]), ''[[Nina's Tragedies]]'', ''[[Campfire (film)|Campfire]]'' and ''[[Beaufort (film)|Beaufort]]'' ([[Joseph Cedar]]), ''[[Or (My Treasure)]]'' ([[Keren Yedaya]]), ''[[Turn Left at the End of the World]]'' ([[Avi Nesher]]), ''[[The Band's Visit]]'' ([[Eran Kolirin]]) ''[[Waltz With Bashir]]'' ([[Ari Folman]]), and ''[[Ajami]]''. In 2011, [[Strangers No More]] won the Oscar for best Short Documentary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telavivfoundation.org/strangers.html Film about Tel Aviv school wins Academy Award] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809021448/http://telavivfoundation.org/strangers.html |date=August 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Clash of the Titans''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]]–[[United States|American]] fantasy action film franchise based on characters and myths of Ancient Greek mythology. The first film, ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'', was released in 1981 with a [[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|remake]] made in 2010.  The remake spawned a sequel, ''[[Wrath of the Titans]]'', in 2012.

== Films ==
The series began with ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' in 1981. It was followed by a [[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|remake of the same name]] in 2010, and a sequel ''[[Wrath of the Titans]]'' in 2012.

In 1984, a concept for a sequel for the original 1981 film was proposed to MGM, but was never made. The film would have been called ''Force of the Trojans''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rayharryhausen.com/filmography.php|title=Filmography |publisher=RayHarryhausen.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, [[Warner Bros.]] hired [[Dan Mazeau]] and [[David Leslie Johnson]] to develop and write a treatment for a third installment, ''Revenge of the Titans''. The pair had previously written ''Wrath of the Titans'', which was still in post-production at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kit |first=Borys |date=2011-11-02 |title=Warner Bros.

In 2009, a one-shot sequel titled ''Wrath of the Titans: Cyclops'' was released. In 2011, ''Revenge of the Medusa'', was released as a four-part series. The 2012 film of the same name is not based on the comics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30184">The '''creative industries''' refers to a range of economic activities which are concerned with the generation or exploitation of knowledge and information. They may variously also be referred to as the [[cultural industry|cultural industries]] (especially in Europe {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=14}} or the creative economy {{harv|Howkins|2001}}, and most recently they have been denominated as the Orange Economy in Latin America and the Caribbean ([http://www.iadb.org/en/publications/publication-detail,7101.html?id=70896 Buitrago &amp; Duque 2013]).

Howkins' creative economy comprises [[advertising]], [[architecture]], [[art]], [[crafts]], [[design]], [[fashion]], [[film industry|film]], [[music industry|music]], [[performing arts]], [[publishing]], [[research and development|R&amp;D]], [[software]], [[toy]]s and [[game]]s, [[Television|TV]] and [[radio]], and [[video game]]s {{harv|Howkins|2001|pp=88–117}}. Some scholars consider that education industry, including public and private services, is forming a part of creative industry.&lt;ref&gt;Kultur &amp; Kommunikation for Nordic Innovation Centre (2007), [http://www.nordicinnovation.org/Global/_Publications/Reports/2008/Creative%20Industries%20education%20in%20the%20Nordic%20countries%20-%20A%20brief%20portrait.pdf "Creative Industries Education in the Nordic Countries"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518105107/http://www.nordicinnovation.org/Global/_Publications/Reports/2008/Creative%20Industries%20education%20in%20the%20Nordic%20countries%20-%20A%20brief%20portrait.pdf |date=2015-05-18 }}; Mœglin, Pierre (2001), Les Industries éducatives, Paris, Puf&lt;/ref&gt; There remain, therefore, different definitions of the sector {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=12}}{{harv| DCMS| 2006}}.

The creative industries have been seen to become increasingly important to economic well-being, proponents suggesting that "[[human creativity]] is the ultimate economic resource" {{Harvard citation|Florida|2002|p=xiii}}, and that "the industries of the twenty-first century will depend increasingly on the generation of knowledge through creativity and innovation" {{Harv|Landry|Bianchini|1995|p=4}}.

==Definitions==
Various commentators have provided varying suggestions on what activities to include in the concept of "creative industries" {{harv|DCMS|2001|p=04}}{{harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=12}}{{harv|Howkins|2001|pp=88–117}}{{Harv|UNCTAD|2008|pp=11–12}}, and the name itself has become a contested issue – with significant differences and overlap between the terms "creative industries", "cultural industries" and "creative economy" {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|pp=11–14}}{{Harv|UNCTAD|2008|p=12}}.

Lash and Urry suggest that each of the creative industries has an "irreducible core" concerned with "the exchange of finance for rights in [[intellectual property]]", {{harv|Lash|Urry|1994|p=117}}. This echoes the [[United Kingdom|UK]] Government [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS) definition which describes the creative industries as:

:"those industries which have their origin in individual creativity, skill and talent and which have a potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property" {{harv|DCMS|2001|p=04}}

{{As of | 2015}} the DCMS definition recognizes nine ''creative sectors'', namely:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/394668/Creative_Industries_Economic_Estimates_-_January_2015.pdf|title=Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport – Creative Industries Economic Estimates January 2015|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=13 January 2015|website=gov.uk|publisher=|access-date=16 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210124534/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/394668/Creative_Industries_Economic_Estimates_-_January_2015.pdf|archivedate=10 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Advertising]] and [[marketing]]
# [[Architecture]] &lt;!--and [[landscaping]] (e.g. [https://www.salford.gov.uk/d/Development_Prospectus.pdf Development prospectus])--&gt;
# [[Crafts]]
# [[Design]]: [[product design|product]], [[graphic design|graphic]] and [[fashion design]]&lt;!--(see also [[communication design]])--&gt;
# [[film]], [[Television|TV]], [[Videography|video]], [[radio]] and [[photography]]
# [[Information technology|IT]], [[software engineering|software]] and [[computer services]]
# [[Publishing]]
# [[Museum]]s, [[art gallery|galleries]] and [[libraries]]
# [[Music industry|Music]], [[performing arts|performing]] and [[visual arts]]

To this list [[John Howkins]] would add [[toys]] and games, also including the much broader area of [[research and development]] in science and technology {{harv|Howkins|2001|pp=88–117}}. It has also been argued{{by whom|date=June 2013}} that [[gastronomy]] belongs in such a list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macedefence.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/does-cuisine-have-a-place-in-the-creative-economy-and-what-role-does-creative-leadership-play-in-its-production/|title=Does cuisine have a place in the Creative Economy and what role does Creative Leadership play in its production?|author=|date=18 May 2011|website=wordpress.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503134414/https://macedefence.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/does-cuisine-have-a-place-in-the-creative-economy-and-what-role-does-creative-leadership-play-in-its-production/|archivedate=3 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various fields of [[engineering]] do not appear on this list, that emerged from the DCMS reports. This was due, probably, to the fact that engineers occupy relevant positions in "non-cultural" corporations, performing activities of project, management, operation, maintenance, risk analysis and supervision, among others. However, historically and presently, several tasks of engineers can be regarded as highly creative, inventive and innovative. The contribution of engineering is represented by new products, processes and services.

Hesmondhalgh reduces the list to what he terms "the core cultural industries" of [[advertising]] and marketing, [[broadcasting]], [[Film industry|film]], internet and [[Music industry|music]] industries, [[publishing|print]] and [[electronic publishing]], and [[computer games|video and computer games]]. His definition only includes those industries that create "texts"' or "cultural artefacts" and which engage in some form of industrial reproduction {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|pp=12–14}}.

The DCMS list has proven influential, and many other nations{{which|date=June 2013}} have formally adopted it. It has also been criticised. It has been argued{{by whom|date=June 2013}} that the division into sectors obscures a divide between [[lifestyle business]], non-profits, and larger businesses, and between those who receive state subsidies (e.g., film) and those who do not (e.g., computer games). The inclusion of the antiques trade often comes into question, since it does not generally involve production (except of reproductions and fakes). The inclusion of all computer services has also been questioned {{harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=13}}.

Some areas, such as [[Hong Kong]], have preferred to shape their policy around a tighter focus on copyright ownership in the [[value chain]]. They adopt the [[WIPO]]'s classifications, which divide up the creative industries according to who owns the copyrights at various stages during the production and distribution of creative content.

The [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) has denominated them for Latin America and the Caribbean as the Orange Economy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iadb.org/en/publications/publication-detail,7101.html?id=70896|title=The Orange Economy: An Infinite Opportunity|first1=Buitrago Restrepo, Pedro|last1=Felipe|first2=Duque Márquez,|last2=Iván|date=1 October 2013|website=iadb.org|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110092916/http://www.iadb.org/en/publications/publication-detail,7101.html?id=70896|archivedate=10 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is defined as the "group of linked activities through which ideas are transformed into cultural goods and services whose value is determined by intellectual property."

Others{{who|date=June 2013}} have suggested a distinction between those industries that are open to mass production and distribution (film and video; videogames; broadcasting; publishing), and those that are primarily craft-based and are meant to be consumed in a particular place and moment ([[visual arts]]; [[performing arts]]; cultural heritage).

==How creative workers are counted==
The DCMS classifies enterprises and occupations as creative according to what the enterprise primarily produces, and what the worker primarily does. Thus, a company which produces records would be classified as belonging to the music [[industrial sector]], and a worker who plays piano would be classified as a [[musician]].

The primary purpose of this is to quantify – for example it can be used to count the number of firms, and the number of workers, creatively employed in any given location, and hence to identify places with particularly high concentrations of creative activities.

It leads to some complications which are not immediately obvious. For example, a security guard working for a music company would be classified as a creative employee, although not as creatively occupied.

The total number of creative employees is then calculated as the sum of:

* All workers employed in creative industries, whether or not creatively occupied (e.g. all musicians, security guards, cleaners, accountants, managers, etc. working for a record company)
* All workers that are creatively occupied, and are not employed in creative industries (for example, a piano teacher in a school). This includes people whose second job is creative, for example somebody who does weekend [[Gig (musical performance)|gigs]], writes books, or produces artwork in their spare time

==Properties or characteristics==
[[File:Township Cat.JPG|thumb|200px|A toy cat produced in a South-African township, made from used plastic bags and old wire]]

According to Caves (2000), creative industries are characterized by seven economic properties:

#''Nobody knows principle'': Demand uncertainty exists because the consumers' reaction to a product are neither known beforehand, nor easily understood afterward.
#''Art for art's sake'': Workers care about originality, technical professional skill, harmony, etc. of creative goods and are willing to settle for lower wages than offered by 'humdrum' jobs.
#''Motley crew principle'': For relatively complex creative products (e.g., films), the production requires diversely skilled inputs. Each skilled input must be present and perform at some minimum level to produce a valuable outcome.
#''Infinite variety'': Products are differentiated by quality and uniqueness; each product is a distinct combination of inputs leading to infinite variety options (e.g., works of creative writing, whether poetry, novel, screenplays or otherwise).
#''A list/B list'': Skills are vertically differentiated. Artists are ranked on their skills, originality, and proficiency in creative processes and/or products. Small differences in skills and talent may yield huge differences in (financial) success.
#''Time flies'': When coordinating complex projects with diversely skilled inputs, time is of the essence.
#''Ars longa'': Some creative products have durability aspects that invoke [[copyright]] protection, allowing a creator or performer to collect rents.

The properties described by Caves have been criticized for being too rigid (Towse, 2000). Not all creative workers are purely driven by 'art for art's sake'. The 'ars longa' property also holds for certain noncreative products (i.e., licensed products). The 'time flies' property also holds for large construction projects. Creative industries are therefore not unique, but they score generally higher on these properties relative to non-creative industries.

==Difference from the 'cultural industries'==
There is often a question about the boundaries between creative industries and the similar term of '''[[Cultural industry|cultural industries]]'''. Cultural industries are best described as an adjunct-sector of the creative industries. Cultural industries include industries that focus on [[cultural tourism]] and [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], [[museum]]s and [[Library|libraries]], [[sports]] and [[outdoor activities]], and a variety of 'way of life' activities that arguably range from local pet shows to a host of [[Hobbies|hobbyist]] concerns. Thus cultural industries are more concerned about delivering other kinds of value—including cultural wealth and social wealth—rather than primarily providing monetary value. (See also [[Cultural Institutions Studies|cultural institutions studies]].)

==The creative class==
Some authors, such as the American [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]], argue for a wider focus on the products of [[knowledge workers]], and judge the '[[creative class]]' (his own term) to include nearly all those offering professional knowledge-based services.

===The creative class and diversity===
Florida's focus leads him to pay particular attention to the nature of the creative [[workforce]]. In a study of why particular US cities such as San Francisco seem to attract creative producers, Florida argues that a high proportion of workers from the '[[creative class]]' provide a key input to creative production, which enterprises seek out. He seeks to quantitatively establish the importance of [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and [[multiculturalism]] in the cities concerned, for example the existence of a significant public gay community, ethnic and religious variety, and tolerance. {{Harvard citation|Florida|2002}}

==Economic contribution==
Globally, Creative Industries excluding software and general scientific [[research and development]] are said to have accounted for around 4% of the world's economic output in 1999, which is the last year for which comprehensive figures are currently available. Estimates of the output corresponding to scientific [[Research and Development]] suggest that an additional 4-9% might be attributable to the sector if its definition is extended to include such activities, though the figures vary significantly between different countries.

Taking the [[United Kingdom|UK]] as an example, in the context of other sectors, the creative industries make a far more significant contribution to output than [[hospitality]] or [[utilities]] and deliver four times the output due to [[agriculture]], [[fisheries]] and [[forestry]]. In terms of employment and depending on the definition of activities included, the sector is a major employer of between 4-6% of the UK's [[working population]], though this is still significantly less than employment due to traditional areas of work such as [[retail]] and [[manufacturing]].

Within the creative industries sector and again taking the UK as an example, the three largest sub-sectors are [[design]], [[publishing]], and [[television]] and [[radio]]. Together these account for around 75% of revenues and 50% of employment.

The complex [[supply chains]] in the creative industries sometimes make it challenging to calculate accurate figures for the [[gross value added]] by each sub-sector. This is particularly the case for the service-focused sub-sectors such as [[advertising]], whereas it is more straightforward in product-focused sub-sectors such as [[crafts]]. Not surprisingly, perhaps, competition in product-focused areas tends to be more intense with a tendency to drive the production end of the supply chain to become a [[commodity business]].

There may be a tendency for publicly funded creative industries development services to inaccurately estimate the number of creative businesses during the mapping process. There is also imprecision in nearly all tax code systems that determine a person's profession, since many creative people operate simultaneously in multiple roles and jobs.  Both these factors mean that official statistics relating to the Creative Industries should be treated with caution.

The creative industries in Europe make a significant contribution to the EU economy, creating about 3% of EU GDP – corresponding to an annual market value of €500 billion – and employing about 6 million people. In addition, the sector plays a crucial role in fostering innovation, in particular for devices and networks. The EU records the second highest TV viewing figures globally, producing more films than any other region in the world. In that respect, the newly proposed [[Creative Europe|'Creative Europe' programme]] (July 2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/opportunities/index_en.htm|title=Creative Europe - European Commission|author=|date=|website=Creative Europe|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430180132/http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/opportunities/index_en.htm|archivedate=30 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; will help preserve cultural heritage while increasing the circulation of creative works inside and outside the EU. The programme will play a consequential role in stimulating cross border co-operation, promoting peer learning and making these sectors more professional. The Commission will then propose a financial instrument run by the European Investment Bank to provide debt and equity finance for cultural and creative industries. The role of the non-state actors within the governance regarding Medias will not be neglected anymore. Therefore, building a new approach extolling the crucial importance of a European level playing field industry may boost the adoption of policies aimed at developing a conducive environment, enabling European companies as well as citizens to use their imagination and creativity – both sources of innovation -, and therefore of competitiveness and sustainability. It supposes to tailor the regulatory and institutional frameworks in supporting private-public collaboration, in particular in the Medias sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }} with Violaine Hacker&lt;/ref&gt; The EU therefore plans to develop clusters, financing instruments as well as foresight activities to support this sector. The European Commission wishes to assist European creators and audiovisual enterprises to develop new markets through the use of digital technology, and asks how policy-making can best help achieve this. A more entrepreneurial culture will have to take hold with a more positive attitude towards risk-taking, and a capacity to innovate anticipating future trends. Creativity plays an important role in human resource management as artists and creative professionals can [[Lateral thinking|think laterally]]. Moreover, new jobs requiring new skills created in the post-crisis economy should be supported by labour mobility to ensure that people are employed wherever their skills are needed.

===In the US===
In the introduction to a 2013 special issue of ''Work and Occupations'' on artists in the US workforce, the guest editors argue that by examining the work lives of artists, one can identify characteristics and actions that help both individual workers and policy makers adapt to changing economic conditions.  Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper cite multiple sources to suggest artists' skill sets allow them to "work beyond existing markets and create entirely new opportunities for themselves and others".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), [http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506232653/http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html |date=2015-05-06 }}, in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Lingo and Tepper suggest artistic workers are "catalysts of change and innovation" because they "face special challenges managing ambiguity, developing and sustaining a relative identity, and forming community in the context of an individually based enterprise economy" (2013). Because of these adaptive skills, the suggestion is that "studying how artists cope with uncertainty and the factors that influence their success should be relevant for understanding these broader social and economic trends facing today's (and tomorrow's) workforce."&lt;ref&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), [http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506232653/http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html |date=2015-05-06 }} in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of artist-as-change-agent changes the questions researchers ask of creative economies. Old research questions would focus on topics like "skills, work practices, contracts, wage differentials, employment incentives, formal credentials, employment pipelines, and labor flows of differentiated occupational categories". Examples of new questions include:
# How do artists both create changes in the labor market itself and the way cultural work is done?
# What is their process of innovation and enterprise?
# What is the nature of their work and the resources they draw upon?
# How do different network structures produce different opportunity spaces?
# How do artistic workers create and manage planned serendipity—the spaces and exchanges that produce unexpected collaborations and opportunities? 
# How do creative workers broker and synthesize across occupational, genre, geographic, and industry boundaries to create new possibilities? (Tepper &amp; Lingo, 2013)&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Wider role==
As some first world countries struggle to compete in traditional markets such as [[manufacturing]], many now see the creative industry as a key component in a new [[knowledge economy]], capable perhaps of delivering [[urban regeneration]], often through initiatives linked to exploitation of [[cultural heritage]] that leads to increased [[tourism]]. It is often argued that, in future, the ideas and imagination of countries like the [[United Kingdom]] will be their greatest asset; in support of this argument, a number of universities in the UK have started to offer [[creative entrepreneurship]] as a specific area for study and research. Indeed, UK government figures reveal that the UK's creative industries account for over a million jobs and brought in £112.5 billion to the UK economy (DCMS ''Creative Industries Mapping Document'' 2001), although the data sets underlying these figures are open to question.

In recent years, creative industries have become 'increasingly attractive to governments outside the developed world'.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Stuart, Ryan, Mark David, Keane, Michael &amp; Ordonez, Diego (2008), ‘Financing Creative Industries in Developing Countries’, in Diana Barrowclough and Zeljka Kozul-Wright eds, [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/17984/1/17984.pdf "Creative Industries and Developing Countries: Voice, Choice and Economic Growth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050038/http://eprints.qut.edu.au/17984/1/17984.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, Routledge, London and New York, pp. 65-110.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) XI High Level Panel on Creative Industries and Development commissioned several studies to identify challenges and opportunities facing the growth and development of creative industries in developing industries. As Cunningham ''et al.'' (2009) put it, 'the harnessing of creativity brings with it the potential of new wealth creation, the cultivation of local talent and the generation of creative capital, the development of new export markets, significant multiplier effects throughout the broader economy, the utilisation of information communication technologies and enhanced competitiveness in an increasingly global economy'. A key driver of interest in creative industries and development is the acknowledgement that the value of creative production resides in ideas and individual creativity, and developing countries have rich cultural traditions and pools of creative talent which lay a basic foundation for creative enterprises. Reflecting the growing interest in the potential of creative industries in developing countries, in October 2011 a Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy was created within the Indonesian government with well-known economist [[Mari Pangestu|Dr Mari Pangestu]] appointed as the first minister to hold the position.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19193">[[File:Eastern World.svg|thumb|275x275px|A world map highlighting the "[[Eastern world]]", defined as [[Asia]] or the "[[Far East]]", which consists of three overlapping cultural regions: [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], and [[Southeast Asia]] (in green, orange, and blue, respectively)]]

In [[sociology]], the '''East–West dichotomy''' is the perceived difference between the [[Eastern world|Eastern]] and [[Western world|Western]] worlds. [[culture|Cultural]] rather than [[geography|geographical]] in division, the boundaries of East and West are not fixed, but vary according to the criteria adopted by individuals using the term. Historically, [[Asia]] (excluding Siberia) was regarded as the East, and [[Europe]] was regarded as the West. Today, the "West" usually refers to [[Australasia]], [[Europe]], and [[Americas|America]]. Used in discussing such studies as [[management]], [[economics]], [[international relations]], and [[linguistics]], the concept is criticized for overlooking regional [[hybridity]].

== Divisions ==
Conceptually, the boundaries are cultural, rather than geographical, as a result of which [[Australia]] is typically grouped in the 
West (despite being geographically in the east), while Islamic nations are, regardless of location, grouped in the East.&lt;ref name=Mestrovic&gt;{{cite book | last = Meštrovic | first = Stjepan | title = Balkanization of the West: The Confluence of Postmodernism and Postcommunism | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-203-34464-2 | page = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are a few Muslim-majority regions in Europe which do not fit this dichotomy.{{fact|date=November 2018}} The culture line can be particularly difficult to place in regions of cultural diversity such as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], whose citizens may themselves identify as East or West depending on ethnic or religious background.&lt;ref name=Mestrovic/&gt; Further, residents of different parts of the world perceive the boundaries differently; for example, some European scholars define [[Russia]] as East, but most agree that it is the West's second complementary part,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/616571/Metaphorical_politics_Is_Russia_western&lt;/ref&gt; and Islamic nations regard it and other predominantly [[Christian]] nations as the West.&lt;ref name=Mestrovic/&gt; Another unanswered question is whether Siberia (North Asia) is "Eastern" or "Western."

==Historical contrast between East and West==
[[File:Reeve and Serfs.jpg|thumb|250px|Serfs in [[kingdom of England|feudal England]], c. 1310]]
[[File:Spisska nova ves...castle.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] led to construction of mighty stone castles, such as [[Spiš Castle]], today in [[Slovakia]].]]
During the [[Middle Ages]], there were many different types of civilizations that were comparable in some ways, but contrast each other in other ways. The Eastern civilizations and empires of the West are not comparable because of [[social class]] system, the way of making money and leadership. Special jobs for the people caused the rift between the East and West to grow, it was the difference between [[feudalism]] and the Eastern social system, the difference between [[trade]] and [[agriculture]] and the difference between the stability of government. The West and the Eastern Civilizations are not only different because of where they are, but also because of their social class system, the way of making money and leadership.&lt;ref name=ganshof&gt;[[François Louis Ganshof]] (1944). ''Qu'est-ce que la féodalité''.  Translated into English by [[Philip Grierson]] as ''Feudalism'', with a foreword by [[F. M. Stenton]], 1st ed.: New York and London, 1952; 2nd ed: 1961; 3d ed: 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[daily life]] of the common people in the West and the Eastern Civilizations differed greatly based on how their society was run, and what it was focused on. One of the major differences between the West and the Eastern Civilizations was feudalism and [[manorialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jones, "The Rise and Fall of the Manorial System: A Critical Comment" ''The Journal of Economic History'' '''32'''.4 (December 1972:938–944) p. 938; a comment on D. North and R. Thomas, "The rise and fall of the manorial system: a theoretical model", ''The Journal of Economic History'' '''31''' (December 1971:777–803).&lt;/ref&gt; They both shaped the [[social hierarchy]] and the overall life of the common person in the East. The manorial system was set up with a lord at the top who owned a large amount of land. He had [[serfs]] and [[peasants]] that he employed, the peasants in exchange for the land they got, for working, paid a rent of crop to the lord. This feudal society was every man for himself and did not help in the expansion of a civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Stubbs]]. ''The Constitutional History of England''. Oxford: 1875.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. McMullan and D. Matthews, ''Reading the medieval in early modern England'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[social system]] of the West and East were different. [[Mongolia]] rose from [[nomad]]ic tribes united by [[Genghis Khan]]. He conquered much of the surrounding land and created a large empire. They would give the defenders a choice to either join them or die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Saunders|first = John Joseph|title = History of the Mongol Conquests|year = 2001|publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press|location = Philadelphia|isbn = 0-8122-1766-7|orig-year = First published 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This brutal mentality was shown when they conquered the vast majority of Asia and some of Europe and the Middle East. One thing that set the [[Tang dynasty]] of [[China]] apart was their increased social mobility. They had a series of tests that could be taken to better social status. Instead of the high-ranking positions being exclusively for the [[aristocrat]]s, they were easier for the poor to gain access to. In the West, it was harder to move up or down in the social classes, but in Eastern Civilizations, mobility was possible. In China, it was possible to move up in social status through tests and, in Mongolia it was possible to gain rank in the army through military skill because the society was based on its military prowess.&lt;ref name="Lewis2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Early Chinese Empires: Qin and Han|first=Mark Edward|last=Lewis|publisher=Belknap Press|location=London|year=2007|isbn=978-0-674-02477-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The West and the Eastern civilizations differed politically because the common people of the East were not always content with their leadership. While the West had many rulers in a short period of time, there was no [[Civil unrest|unrest]] with the people. Eastern civilizations had [[rebellion]]s and long gaps between rulers that caused unrest. In [[England]], there was a major war for the [[throne]] that lasted for almost a century. During a major war in the 14th and [[15th century]], England had many struggles for the throne that lead to much bloodshed. [[France]] also had problems in their government. Throughout all of this, England was still able to fight the French and almost win in the [[Hundred Years War]]. In Eastern civilizations the government was not always stable.&lt;ref&gt;H. Damico, J. B. Zavadil, D. Fennema, and K. Lenz, ''Medieval Scholarship: Philosophy and the arts: biographical studies on the formation of a discipline'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1995), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; In China, one of the deadliest events in human history occurred during the Tang dynasty. The [[An Lushan Rebellion]] was very bloody and shows the instability in the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turchin|first1=Peter|last2=Adams|first2=Jonathan M.|last3=Hall|first3=Thomas D | title = East-West Orientation of Historical Empires | journal = Journal of world-systems research|date=December 2006 |volume=12|issue=2 |page=222 |url =http://jwsr.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/jwsr/article/view/369/381 |issn= 1076-156X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economically, the West and the Eastern civilizations were drastically different because of how they acquired money. In China, one of the major economic factors was the trade. They were connected to Europe with the [[Silk Road]], this was a series of trade routes from [[East Asia]] to Europe. The Silk Road was not only used to trade [[goods]], it was also a place for trading ways of thought or religion. The [[English people|English]] employed a special type of feudalism called [[bastard feudalism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Livery and Maintenance'', ''Encyclopedia of The Wars of the Roses'', ed. John A. Wagner, (ABC-CLIO, 2001), 145.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of feudalism, prominent in the [[War of the Roses]], was different from regular feudalism because it introduces money into the social hierarchy.&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9034150/feudalism "Feudalism"], by [[Elizabeth A. R. Brown]]. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=halsall&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/sbook1i.html#Feudalism "Feudalism?"], by Paul Halsall. [[Internet Medieval Sourcebook]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Nobles could now pay their knights for their service in money instead of giving them land. This strengthened the feudal system because if there was a weak ruler, the strong government of the new nobles would support the people. The British nobles also created the [[Magna carta]] to reduce the kings power. This monetization of the class system changed how England was ruled and made it very different from the Eastern Civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080229034347/http://www.wku.edu/~rob.harbison/projects/Gfeudal.html "The Problem of Feudalism: An Historiographical Essay"], by Robert Harbison, 1996, [[Western Kentucky University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical concepts ==
[[File:Modern Asia (1796).tif|thumb|245px|In the 1700s, the Eastern world comprised the continents of Asia and Australia ([[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]).]]
The concept has been used in both "Eastern" and "Western" nations. [[Japan|Japanese]] [[sinology|sinologist]] Tachibana Shiraki, in the 1920s, wrote of the need to unify Asia&amp;mdash;[[East Asia]], [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] but excluding [[Central Asia]] and the [[Middle East]]&amp;mdash;and form a "New East" that might combine culturally in balancing against the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Li | first= Lincoln | title = The China factor in Modern Japanese thought: the case of Tachibana Shiraki, 1881-1945 | series = SUNY Series in Chinese Philosophy and Culture | publisher = [[SUNY Press]] | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-7914-3039-1 | pages = 104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan continued to make much of the concept, known as [[Pan-Asianism]], throughout [[World War II]], in [[propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Iriye | first = Akira | title = Global community: the role of international organizations in the making of the contemporary world | publisher = [[University of California Press]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-520-23127-9 | page = 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, it was encapsulated during the [[Cold War]] in a 1957 speech by [[Mao Zedong]],&lt;ref name=Zedong&gt;{{cite book | last = Kau | first = John K. |author2=Leung | chapter = Notes | title = The Writings of Mao Zedong, 1949-1976: January 1956-December 1957 | volume = 2 | series = Writings of Mao Zedong | publisher = [[M.

To Western writers, in the 1940s, it became bound up with an idea of aggressive, "frustrated nationalism", which was seen as "intrinsically anti- or non-Western"; sociologist [[Frank Furedi]] wrote, "The already existing intellectual assessment of European nationalism adapted to the growth of the Third World variety by developing the couplet of mature Western versus immature Eastern nationalism.... This East-West dichotomy became an accepted part of Western political theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Füredi | first = Frank | title = Colonial wars and the politics of Third World nationalism | publisher = I.B.Tauris | year = 1994 | pages = 115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The 1978 book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'', by [[Edward Said]], was highly influential in further establishing concepts of the East–West dichotomy in the Western world, bringing into college lectures a notion of the East as "characterized by religious sensibilities, familial social orders, and ageless traditions" in contrast to Western "rationality, material and technical dynamism, and individualism."&lt;ref name=Barnett&gt;{{cite book | last = Barnett | first= Suzanne Wilson |author2=Van Jay Symons | title = Asia in the undergraduate curriculum: a case for Asian studies in liberal arts education | series = East Gate | publisher = M.E. Sharpe | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-7656-0546-5 | page = 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the divide has also been posited as an Islamic "East" and an American and European "West."&lt;ref&gt;Meštrovic, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite book | last = Chahuán | first = Eugenio | chapter = An East-West dichotomy: Islamophobia | title = Islamophobia and anti-Semitism | series = A Palestine-Israel Journal Book | editor1-last = Schenker | editor1-first=Hillel | editor2-last = Ziad | editor2-first = Abu Zayyad | publisher = Markus Wiener Publishers | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-55876-403-8 | pages = 25–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics note that an Islamic/non-Islamic East–West dichotomy is complicated by the global dissemination of [[Islamic fundamentalism]] and by cultural diversity within Islamic nations, moving the argument "beyond that of an East-West dichotomy and into a tripartite situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Khatib | first = Lina | title = Filming the modern Middle East: politics in the cinemas of Hollywood and the Arab world | volume = 57 | series = Library of Modern Middle East Studies, Library of International Relations | publisher = [[I.B. Tauris]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-84511-191-5 | pages = 166–167, 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
The East–West dichotomy has been used in studying a range of topics, including management, economics and linguistics. ''Knowledge Creation and Management'' (2007) examines it as the difference in [[organizational learning]] between [[Western culture]]s and the [[Eastern world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Knowledge creation and management: new challenges for managers | last = Ichijō | first = Kazuo |author2=Ikujirō Nonaka | publisher = Oxford University Press US | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-19-515962-4 | page = 280}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been widely used in exploring the period of rapid economic growth that has been termed the "East-Asian miracle" in segments of [[East Asia]], particularly the [[Four Asian Tigers|Asian Tigers]], following [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Norberg | first = Johan | title = In defense of global capitalism | publisher = Cato Institute | year = 2003 | isbn = 1-930865-46-5 | page = 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sociologists, in line with the West as a model of [[modernity]] posited by [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], have perceived the economic expansion as a sign of the "[[Westernization]]" of the region, but others look for explanation in cultural/racial characteristics of the East, embracing concepts of fixed Eastern cultural identity in a phenomenon described as "New Orientalism".&lt;ref name=Mestrovic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berger&gt;{{cite book| last = Berger | first = Mark T. | chapter = The triumph of the East? The East-Asian Miracle and post-Cold War capitalism | title = The rise of East Asia: critical visions of the Pacific century | editor1-last = Borer | editor1-first = Douglas A. | publisher = Routledge | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-415-16168-1 | pages = 260–261, 266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both approaches to the East-West dichotomy have been criticized for failing to take into account the historical [[hybridity]] of the regions.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has also been brought to bear on examinations of [[intercultural communication]]. Asians are widely described as embracing an "inductive speech pattern" in which a primary point is approached indirectly, but Western societies are said to use "deductive speech" in which speakers immediately establish their point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cheng | first = Winnie | title= Intercultural conversation | volume = 118 | series = Pragmatics &amp; Beyond | publisher = [[John Benjamins Publishing Company]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 90-272-5360-9 | page = 51}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is attributed to a higher priority among Asians in harmonious interrelations, but Westerners are said to prioritize direct communication.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; 2001's ''Intercultural Communication: A Discourse Approach'' described the East–West dichotomy linguistically as a "false dichotomy", noting that both Asian and Western speakers use both forms of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scollon | first = Ronald | title= Intercultural communication: a discourse approach | volume = 21 | series= Language in Society | edition = 2 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-631-22418-1 | pages = 94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In addition to difficulties in defining regions and overlooking hybridity, the East–West dichotomy has been criticized for creating an artificial construct of regional unification that allows one voice to claim authority to speak for multitudes. In "The Triumph of the East?", Mark T. Berger speaks to the issue as relates to examination of the "East-Asian miracle": 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The historical power of the East-West dichotomy, and the fixed conceptions of culture/race to which it is linked, have increasingly allowed the national elites of the region to speak not only for their 'nations,' but even for Asia and Asians.... There are numerous instances of Western scholars, intent on challenging North American and/or Western hegemony in both material and discursive terms, ending up uncritically privileging the elite narratives of power-holders in Asia as authentic representatives of a particular non-Western nation or social formation (and also contributing to the continued use of the East-West dichotomy).&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 276&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Egg Fu''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[DC Comics]] publications and related media, commonly as an adversary for the superheroine [[Wonder Woman]].

==Publication history==
Most frequently represented as an enormous sentient egg (and often, inexplicably, of Chinese descent), he was created by [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[Ross Andru]]&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Egg Fu | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 113  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he first appeared in ''Wonder Woman'' #157. Over the years, multiple versions of the character have appeared with varying backstories and alternative names (including '''Egg Fu the Fifth''', '''Chang Tzu''', and '''Dr. Yes''') to battle not only Wonder Woman, but also the [[Metal Men]], [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] and [[Harley Quinn]].

In early appearances, the character was a [[Yellow Peril]] ethnic stereotype, complete with caricaturish Asian facial features and dialogue written in a phoneticized Chinese accent. His name is an obvious play on the name of a Chinese ethnic dish, [[egg foo young]]. Certain 21st-century updates, such as changing his name to ''Chang Tzu'' and affiliating him with DC Comics' Chinese superhero team the [[Great Ten]], maintain his Asian ethnicity while striving to de-emphasize problematic aspects of his historically racialized characterization. Appearances in ''Harley Quinn'' in 2014 and ''Harley Quinn and Power Girl'' in 2015, though restoring the name Egg Fu, have expunged overt associations with Chinese culture and language.

==Fictional character biography==

===Pre-crisis history===

====Original Egg Fu====
[[Image:Wwoman158.jpg|''Wonder Woman'' #158 (Nov. 1965). Cover art by [[Ross Andru]] and [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]]|left|thumb]]

Egg Fu debuted in ''Wonder Woman'' #157 (Oct. 1965).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.comics.org/issue/19518/  ''Wonder Woman'' #157] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Chinese Communist agent, perplexingly shaped like an egg the size of a house, with a [[Charlie Chan]]-like speech pattern, who used his mustaches as whips against his enemies. In Egg Fu's first appearance, [[Steve Trevor]] is captured by the Chinese mastermind and turned into a human bomb. Egg Fu then launches Steve and a doomsday missile at the American fleet. Wonder Woman intercepts Steve, who has become a deadly menace. She is unable to save him, but she redirects his path into the enemy missile. The explosion destroys the missile, Steve, and Wonder Woman herself, but the fleet is saved. Informed of her daughter's demise, [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] gathers the remains of Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor and returns them to a laboratory on [[Paradise Island]]. Using an atomic structure reassembly beam, she restores Steve and her daughter. However, Steve's body is still infused with explosive energy. Wonder Woman finds that her own body has also become explosive, making them both a danger to the world. They leave Paradise Island. Wonder Woman plans to use the explosive power against Egg Fu. The Chinese leader sends his troops against her, but they fail in their task to overcome her. A piece of anti-matter removes the explosive matter from Steve and Wonder Woman, then the Amazon defeats Egg Fu.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' #157–158 (Oct.-Nov. 1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Egg Fu the Fifth====
Egg Fu the Fifth, a relative of the original Egg Fu, debuted in ''Wonder Woman'' #166 (November 1966).

Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor investigate the disappearance of an American submarine. While flying over the ocean where it disappeared, Wonder Woman's plane is fired upon by an enemy freighter. Steve boards the ship, then disappears too.
[[Image:Wwoman166.jpg|Egg Fu the Fifth appears in ''Wonder Woman'' #166  (Nov. 1966). Cover art by Ross Andru and Mike Esposito|right|thumb]]

Wonder Woman's plane is drawn underwater into a giant seashell. [[Frogman|Frogmen]] attack her and take her prisoner. She is brought to a secret base controlled by Egg Fu the Fifth. Held prisoner by [[Lasso of Truth|her own magic lasso]], Wonder Woman offers to dance for Egg Fu. She then performs a bracelet-clashing dance which cracks Egg Fu and allows her to escape and rescue the stolen submarine.

====Dr. Yes====
Dr. Yes (a reference to [[Julius No|Dr. No]]), Egg Fu's robot twin, appears in ''[[Metal Men]]'' #20 (June/July 1966).{{Or|date=August 2010}} In the story, he uses a giant robot to capture [[Will Magnus]], thereby luring the Metal Men to his base where he brainwashes them, believing that "when the Amelicans see how these gleat heroes of theirs have turned tlaitors-- they will doubt ''anyone's'' stlength to lesist us!"

The giant robot takes the Metal Men to a football stadium that is celebrating "[[I am an American Day]]". Fighting the urge to say "Down with America!" in front of everyone, the Metal Men self-destruct instead. An angry Dr. Yes tries having the giant robot destroy the crowd instead, but the various pieces of the Metal Men attack and destroy the robot, freeing Magnus who had been trapped inside. Afterwards, Magnus rebuilds the superhero team. Dr. Yes is still at large at the story's end.

===Post-crisis history===

====Post-crisis Egg Fu====
Following the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', a new version of Egg Fu was introduced in ''Wonder Woman'' vol. 2, #128 (December 1997). This Egg Fu is a nineteenth-century super-computer, recently rediscovered and turned into one of many carnival attractions along [[Gateway City]]'s Oceanside boardwalk, despite public protests that the attraction is racially insensitive.

Egg Fu is actually a product of [[Apokolips|Apokoliptian]] technology created from a device [[Mister Miracle|Scott Free]] accidentally left behind on a visit to Earth. Once activated, it begins dominating people's minds and preparing them for transport to Apokolips. Egg Fu is defeated by Hippolyta (at the time acting as Diana's successor as Wonder Woman), [[Donna Troy]], [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]] and [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]]. An associate of Mister Miracle, [[Metron (comics)|Metron]], removes it.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;

====Chang Tzu====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Science Squad]] --&gt;
{{See also|52 (comics)}}
Following the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', a new version of Egg Fu appears, calling himself Chang Tzu (likely{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} a reference to [[Zhuang Zhou|Chuang Tzu]], or possibly [[Sun Tzu]].), an agent of [[Apokolips]].

Chang Tzu (Chung Zhu) is the mastermind, along with [[Bruno Mannheim|Bruno "Ugly" Mannheim]], behind the kidnappings of many mad scientists in the comic book series ''52''. They are forcibly recruited into Chang's "[[Science Squad]]" based on [[Oolong Island]]. Chang has a large, egg-shaped body with facial features and cracked skin, mounted in a spider-legged chair for mobility. He is equipped with small prosthetic hands that allow him to manipulate items and equipment; he is also armed with hidden weaponry.

Shortly after [[Black Adam]] escapes confinement on Oolong Island, Chang Tzu is shot apart by one of his kidnapped scientists, Dr. [[Will Magnus]].&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt; Magnus claims to be acting irrationally due to a lack of medication. A new, smouldering egg was seen hidden in Chang's shattered remains.&lt;ref&gt;''52'' Week 49&lt;/ref&gt; When he later reappears and is asked about his seeming destruction, he explains, "My third incubation ended four months ago."&lt;ref&gt;''Checkmate'' #15&lt;/ref&gt;

Chang Tzu later re-appears as the main villain in 2007's "Checkout" storyline that crossed over between the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] and [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] series. The UN-sponsored clandestine agency devoted to meta-human special operations capture the then-wanted super-hero team led by [[Nightwing]] and coerce them into helping invade Oolong Island. A team of operatives from both groups reaches the island, but [[Sasha Bordeaux]] and [[Captain Boomerang]] are taken captive by Chang Tzu, who subjects them both to excruciatingly torturous studies in order to examine their own respective meta-abilities. Their teammates eventually free them and the group retreats, their mission a failure, with Chang Tzu still remaining at large. While studying her unique physiology consisting of human tissue and artificially intelligent nanotechnology, Chang Tzu takes a morbid interest in Bordeaux, remarking:

:"Never in my wildest dreams... did I imagine I would meet a creature I pitied more than myself."&lt;ref&gt;''Checkmate'' vol. 2 #16&lt;/ref&gt;

As revealed to [[Alan Scott]] by [[Thundermind]], Chang Tzu and his Science Squad are members of the [[Great Ten]] that provide, among other things, the funds to operate the organization and the technology they use.

His name is unclear as it has been inconsistently presented; he is introduced as Chang Tzu,&lt;ref&gt;''52'' Week 25&lt;/ref&gt; but is subsequently referred to as both Chung Zhu&lt;ref name="52 Week 29"&gt;''52'' Week 29&lt;/ref&gt; and Chung Tzu.&lt;ref&gt;''52'' Week 45&lt;/ref&gt; It may be possible that he has multiple names; Chang himself explains that "Egg Fu" is one of his "Nine thousand and nine unmentionable names", and immediately kills a guard who laughs at his mention of it.&lt;ref name="52 Week 29"/&gt;

Chang Tzu reappeared in a short story published in ''Wonder Woman'' #600, where he was defeated by Wonder Woman, [[Power Girl]], and [[Cassandra Cain|Batgirl]].

In the New 52, Egg Fu appeared in ''Harley Quinn Annual'' #1. In the comic, he is Edgar Fullerton Yeung, a giant egg scientist who is secretly experimenting on Poison Ivy at Arkham Asylum. However, he ends up reforming with the help of Harley Quinn and gets himself a job.

Egg Fu appears throughout the [[DC Rebirth]] iteration of the ''Harley Quinn'' series.&lt;ref&gt;Issues #1-8, 12-14, 17, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

| AU1951
| George Allen &amp; Unwin LTD of London, 1951. Covers and dust jacket in same art as AU1937 but size has changed. Tolkien modified the story (particularly ''Riddles in the Dark'') to match what ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' had evolved into.

Identical sheets and illustrations as the 6th UK printing (second printing of AU1951), but the binding reverted to a design similar to HM1938, only smaller and without the bowing hobbit insignia on the front cover. Unlike the corresponding UK edition, the American covers changed color roughly every printing, though samples can be found with sheets from one UK printing and binding color prevalent on a neighboring US printing. Unlike the UK impressions, most of the US printings of the second edition did not declare the impression on the reverse of the title page, making them difficult to identify. 13.0&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;19.0&amp;nbsp;cm, 315 numbered pages.

'''Extension transference''' is the symbolic sub-division of a particular goal or purpose so that the sub-divided concepts seem fragmented from the original purpose.

''"…when applied to language and experience, becomes a useful theoretical concept. Thus, spoken language is a symbolization of something that happened, is happening or will happen. Written language as an extension of the spoken form is therefore a symbolization of symbolization! This intellectual manoeuvre Hall terms extension transference. The extension can become confused with or take the place of the process described."'' (Lago, p68).

''"Extension transference is a phenomenon that occurs when we create systems to help us do things more efficiently and effectively and in ways that we can measure and control. Often these are processes that we once did quite naturally on our own."'' (Hanson, p.&amp;nbsp;43).

The term was coined by the American anthropologist [[Edward T. Hall]] in his book ''[[Beyond Culture]]'' (1976).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4167">'''Flight sharing''' is the sharing of the costs of non-commercial [[general aviation]] aircraft flights between a licensed pilot and their passengers.

==Websites==
With the rise of the Internet, numerous websites have appeared to coordinate the meeting of private pilots with willing passengers for particular flights.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com 2014-04-02"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/02/airpooler/ |title=AirPooler Is Lyft For Private Planes |last=Constine |first=Josh |work=techcrunch.com |date=2014-04-02 |accessdate=2014-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal issues===

==== United States ====
Flight sharing is legal in the [[United States]], under the terms of the [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] (FARs) prescribed by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA). However, the FARs include a few caveats.

"'''Flipmode'''" is a 2017 song by [[Fabolous]], [[Chris Brown]], and [[Velous]]. The song's title is derived from the [[Busta Rhymes]] led record label [[Flipmode Enterntainment]]. The song also includes a reference to Flipmode artist [[Spliff Star]]. Originally released by Velous, the song was later remixed by Fabolous to be included on his ''Summertime Shootout 3'' mixtape. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2017/10/fabolous-velous-chris-brown-flipmode-video/|title=Watch Fabolous, Velous and Chris Brown's|website=XXL Mag|author=Emmanuel C.M.|date=October 31, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion==

'''''Hyperdrive''''' is a [[British television]] [[science fiction]] [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] broadcast by [[BBC Two]] in 2006 and 2007. The [[working title]] was ''Full Power''. In a 2008 interview, Kevin Eldon commented that he considered a third series was unlikely to be commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kevin Eldon speaks!|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/features/2008/08/07/7191/kevin_eldon_speaks|date=7 August 2008|website=Chortle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set in 2151 and 2152, it follows the crew of [[Her Majesty's Ship|HMS]] ''[[Camden Lock]]'' as they stumble through their heroic mission to protect British interests in a changing galaxy.

The series is written by [[Kevin Cecil]] and [[Andy Riley]], directed by [[John Henderson (director)|John Henderson]] and produced by Alex Walsh-Taylor.&lt;ref name="sit"&gt;{{cite web | title=British Sitcom Guide - Hyperdrive |url=http://www.sitcom.co.uk/hyperdrive/ |accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first episode was broadcast on [[BBC Two]] on 11 January 2006. A second series began on 12 July 2007 on [[BBC Two]].

==Cast and characters==
* [[Nick Frost]] plays the character of Space Commander Michael "Mike" "Lucky Jack" "Hendo" Henderson – according to the official website of the series, Henderson's "Space Force File" describes Henderson's career arc this way: ''"Henderson rose through the ranks in exactly the way we say people can in the recruitment ads, yet endeavour to prevent in practice. Henderson shows initiative; always a dangerous sign."'' It also says Henderson's education was received at [[Dagenham]] [[Secondary Modern]] and New [[Portsmouth]] Cadet Camp. The website further describes Henderson as an [[idealistic]] explorer, eager to meet new races, and feels he is undervalued given his low-priority assignments. Frost's character also has a recurring theme, his favourite show, ''Captain Helix''. He is very protective of his Commander's chair, which he refers to as "[[Spinning Jenny]]."
* [[Kevin Eldon]] as First Officer Eduardo Pauline York – a brilliant scientist and tactician, second in command of the ''Camden Lock''. He is also a borderline [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]], obsessed with and taking immense joy in violence, needing only the slightest provocation to attack someone. He believes in a hardline [[doctrine]] and feels Commander Henderson is too lenient regarding the crew and application of regulations. He does not trust Technical Officer Jeffers, and has the ability to hold his breath for seven and a half hours to avoid the effects of sedative gas. He also shows great affection towards Sandstrom, appearing to be in love with her at certain points in the show, even becoming jealous when Vine is kissing Sandstrom in his "Pub-conscious".  Like his friend Henderson, York also watches ''Captain Helix''.  At times, he can be quite poetic when describing acts of violence.
* [[Miranda Hart]] as Diplomatic Officer Chloe Alice Teal – Teal has a large and obvious crush on Commander Henderson, who has not responded to her advances. Teal's skills as a diplomat could be questioned, as during the episode ''Hello, Queppu'', her drunken outburst results in the Queppu imprisoning the three senior officers of the ''Camden Lock.'' She failed her final exam to become an officer, and is only present on the ''Camden Lock'' as her father is an ambassador. In series two it is revealed that Teal is a devout agnostic, a belief which has apparently become a more formal religion in the future. She is also the [[yoga]] instructor on the ship.
* [[Stephen Evans (actor)|Stephen Evans]] as Navigator Dave Vine – Vine's greatest apparent achievement to date is purchasing a planet in an auction. The planet was quickly renamed Vineworld with such locations as Vine City 1 and Vine Ridge. Vine is a quiet member of the crew, uncomfortable with standing up to the outgoing personality of Jeffers or the [[authoritarianism]] of York. He is a collector of 1990s "antiques", believing it to be a simpler time; this is reflected by his "pub-conscious", which is the only dream he has, a pub in 1995, where it is revealed that he, like York, is attracted to Sandstrom.
* [[Dan Antopolski]] as Technical Officer Karl Jeffers – an easy going and lax member of the bridge crew who has been placed in command of the ''Camden Lock'' on at least two occasions by Commander Henderson. He dislikes York and makes written notes on all the senior officer's mistakes. Jeffers has a liking for alien music; in particular, he enjoyed listening to the Lallakiss war anthem, ''"Kill the Humans"'', whilst on duty.
* [[Petra Massey]] as Sandstrom – an "enhanced human", a cyborg interface needed to ensure the ''Camden Lock'' keeps functioning. She agreed to have her body and mind modified in exchange for the Space Force paying off her [[student loan]], assuming the offer would not be made if the procedure was not safe. Her personality was then overwritten and she functions much like an [[Android (robot)|android]], although chocolate seems to have an adverse emotional effect on her, leading to [[hypersexuality]]. She seems to have a lot of affection for York, and is much more obvious about her feelings for him than he is about his for her. She gets very jealous whenever another Enhanced comes on board.  She appears to interact with the ship via deliberate, dance like, movements and rubbing or stroking the luminescent tubes that surround her usual working space.
* [[Maggie Service]] as a variety of Computer Voices – these serve primarily as throwaway lines and interstitials, and include user interfaces (''To access the toilet, enter the second, fourth and eighty-third numbers in your security code'') and shipwide announcements (''Attention all crew: Today is Take Your Clone to Work Day. If you don't have a clone, go and see the Clone Officer on Level 7''). In series two, other computer voices are played by Ewan Bailey.
* [[Waen Shepherd]] as Gareth Stannis, the actor who plays the title part in the television drama ''Captain Helix'', watched obsessively by Captain Henderson in the privacy of his cabin as a source of emotional comfort. Captain Helix &amp;mdash; who resembles a somewhat [[camp (style)|camp]]er version of [[Doctor Who]] &amp;mdash; may also not be quite what he seems.

==HMS ''Camden Lock''==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Hyperdriveship.jpg|thumb|150px| Concept drawing of HMS ''Camden Lock''. {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;
[[File:BT Tower 2004.jpg|thumb|150px| The shape of HMS ''Camden Lock'' is based on the [[BT Tower]]]]
The design for HMS ''Camden Lock'' was based loosely upon the [[BT Tower]] in London. It is a '[[Wendover]]' class ship and measures {{convert|376|m|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|90|m|0|abbr=on}} wide. The ship's registration is XH558 - the same serial number as the last flying [[Avro Vulcan]] bomber. Shuttlebay doors on the ''Camden'' are shown with the [[Union Jack]] embossed on them, which is part of the comic jingoism of the series. [[Camden Lock]] is the name of a [[Lock (water transport)|lock]] on a [[canal]] in the real [[Camden Town|Camden]] in [[London]].

The ''Camden Lock'' is powered by "P-Rods", with the P standing for ''Perfectly safe'', although it is rumoured to stand for ''Plutonium''.  Her maximum speed is 170 Vs—any higher and the reactors overheat. Her maximum crush depth is {{convert|197|atm}}

The ''Camden Lock'' is armed with missiles and pulse weapons of some form.  The laser guns wielded by her crew bear a striking resemblance to crutches.

The Green Javelins (a "space-o-batics" [[precision flying]] team that appear in Series 2, Episode 1) also use 'Wendover' class ships. (The [[Red Arrows]] are the [[Royal Air Force]]'s aerobatic team.)

==Alien races==

=== The Glish ===
The Glish are repulsive-looking, slimy creatures who like to communicate by drooling and licking. Commander Henderson causes a diplomatic conflict by not allowing the Glish ambassadors to rub their genitals on his face.

=== The Queppu ===
A [[Medieval]]-ish race living on a mostly desert planet. They have a pseudo-feudal society with monarchical (if not totalitarian) government. Typical dress includes jester-like bright red latex suits. The despotic and insane king desires that everyone ''marvel'' at his civilization, for example, he possesses a "Doom Ray", with which he threatens Henderson, Teal, and York and at which he expects them to marvel.  The "Doom Ray" apparently takes three days to disintegrate a single person and a week to recharge. The princess bears a remarkable resemblance to [[Lucrezia Borgia]]. As revealed in "Artifact", they gained a space-faring capability after half of the population was sold as food to an insectoid species to 'grind up in their mandibles to feed to their larval young.' The King described this as a good trade.

=== The Lallakkis ===
A pseudo-Medieval race. They dress in somber brown leather, appear unkempt, have the mental capability of 10-year-olds, and are eager to play chicken and use violence at slightest irritation. Every war the race participates in, a battle song is written. One of their battle songs is "Kill the Humans", which includes a death threat for Commander Henderson in the lyrics. The race is possibly caricatures of the British [[Chav]] subculture, or the Ali G stereotype of youth.

=== The Bulaagh ===
A highly advanced race,  but very haughty, looking down on everyone else. Not as trigger-happy as the Lallakkis, but nevertheless ally themselves against Britain with the Lallakkis after Commander Henderson caused the destruction of an asteroid that was the subject of a dispute between the two races.  They seem able to communicate with each other, telepathically, by touching a gem like marking on their long chins.

=== The Red Shiny Robots of Vortis ===
A [[parody]] of the [[Star Trek: The Next Generation]] [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]]. A race eager to absorb information and knowledge of various races, exterminating them in the process. They appear to be clad in red latex, they extract the minds of the lifeforms into the "data-sphere" which leaves the bodies dead, although it has the weakness of disruption if those who are having their minds "harvested" think of falsehoods (allusion to the Starfleet attempt to plant an optical illusion computational [[Computer worm|worm]] in the Borg collective in the [[I, Borg]] episode).

There is also a model of Red Shiny Robot of Vortis used for infiltration, designed to look like attractive women, though based on the episode, it's debatable whether they truly understand the concept of attractive.

'''Improvisational theatre''', often called '''provisation ''' or '''improv''', is the form of [[theatre]], often [[comedy]], in which most or all of what is performed is unplanned or unscripted: created spontaneously by the performers. In its purest form, the dialogue, action, story, and characters are created collaboratively by the players as the improvisation unfolds in present time, without use of an already prepared, written [[Play (theatre)|script]].

Improvisational theatre exists in performance as a range of styles of improvisational comedy as well as some non-comedic theatrical performances. It is sometimes used in film and television, both to develop characters and scripts and occasionally as part of the final product.

Improvisational techniques are often used extensively in drama programs to train actors for stage, film, and television and can be an important part of the rehearsal process. However, the skills and processes of improvisation are also used outside the context of performing arts - [[Applied improvisation|Applied Improvisation]]. It is used in classrooms as an educational tool and in businesses as a way to develop communication skills, creative problem solving, and supportive team-work abilities that are used by improvisational, ensemble players&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hainselin|first=Mathieu|last2=Aubry|first2=Alexandre|last3=Bourdin|first3=Béatrice|date=2018|title=Improving Teenagers’ Divergent Thinking With Improvisational Theater|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01759/full|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=9|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01759|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is sometimes used in [[psychotherapy]] as a tool to gain insight into a person's thoughts, feelings, and relationships.

==History==
The earliest well documented use of improvisational theatre in Western history is found in the [[Atellan Farce]] of 391 BC. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' performers improvised based on a broad outline in the streets of Italy. In the 1890s, theatrical theorists and directors such as the Russian [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and the French [[Jacques Copeau]], founders of two major streams of acting theory, both heavily utilized improvisation in acting training and rehearsal.&lt;ref&gt;''Twentieth Century Acting Training''. ed. Alison Hodge. New York: Routledge, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
[[File:Dario Fo in Venice Film Festival 02.jpg|thumb|Italian Nobel-winner [[Dario Fo]] received international acclaim for his highly improvisational style]]
Modern theatrical improvisation games began as drama exercises for children, which were a staple of drama education in the early 20th century thanks in part to the [[progressive education]] movement initiated by [[John Dewey]] in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interactiveimprov.com/tspwb1hist.html|title=TheatreSports History|work=interactiveimprov.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people credit American [[Dudley Riggs]] as the first [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]] to use audience suggestions to create improvised sketches on stage. Improvisation exercises were developed further by [[Viola Spolin]] in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, and codified in her book ''Improvisation For The Theater'',&lt;ref name="Spolin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Improvisation for the Theater Third Edition|author=Viola Spolin|year=1999|ISBN=0-8101-4008-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first book that gave specific techniques for learning to do and teach improvisational theater. In the 1970s in Canada, British playwright and director [[Keith Johnstone]] wrote ''[[Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre]]'', a book outlining his ideas on improvisation, and invented [[Theatresports]], which has become a staple of modern improvisational comedy and is the inspiration for the popular television show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]''

Spolin influenced the first generation of modern American improvisers at [[The Compass Players]] in [[Chicago]], which led to [[The Second City]]. Her son, [[Paul Sills]], along with [[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]], started The Compass Players. Following the demise of the Compass Players, Paul Sills began The Second City. They were the first organized troupes in Chicago, and the modern Chicago improvisational comedy movement grew from their success.&lt;ref name=Wonderful&gt;The story of the Compass Players and its development into The Second City is told by first-hand interviews in Jeffrey Sweet's book "Something Wonderful Right Away" (Limelight Editions, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Compass&gt;Janet Coleman's "The Compass: The Improvisational Theatre that Revolutionized American Comedy" (Centennial Publications of The University of Chicago Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the current "rules" of comedic improv were first formalized in Chicago in the late 1950s and early 1960s, initially among The Compass Players troupe, which was directed by Paul Sills. From most accounts, David Shepherd provided the philosophical vision of the Compass Players, while [[Elaine May]] was central to the development of the premises for its improvisations. [[Mike Nichols]], Ted Flicker, and [[Del Close]] were her most frequent collaborators in this regard. When The Second City opened its doors on December 16, 1959, directed by Paul Sills, his mother Viola Spolin began training new improvisers through a series of classes and exercises which became the cornerstone of modern improv training. By the mid-1960s, Viola Spolin's classes were handed over to her protégé, [[Josephine Forsberg|Jo Forsberg]], who further developed Spolin's methods into a one-year course, which eventually became [[The Players Workshop]], the first official school of improvisation in the USA. During this time, Forsberg trained many of the performers who went on to star on The Second City stage.&lt;ref name=Wonderful /&gt;&lt;ref name=Compass /&gt;

Many of the original cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' came from The Second City, and the franchise has produced such comedy stars as [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], [[Tina Fey]], [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Amy Sedaris]], [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Jack McBrayer]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Chris Farley]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], and [[John Belushi]].

Simultaneously, Keith Johnstone's group The Theatre Machine, which originated in [[London]], was touring Europe. This work gave birth to [[Theatresports]], at first secretly in Johnstone's workshops, and eventually in public when he moved to Canada. [[Toronto]] has been home to a rich improv tradition.

In 1984, [[Dick Chudnow]] (Kentucky Fried Theater) founded [[ComedySportz]] in [[Milwaukee]], WI. Expansion began with the addition of ComedySportz-Madison (WI), in 1985. The first Comedy League of America National Tournament was held in 1988, with 10 teams participating. The league is now known as CSz Worldwide and boasts a roster of 29 international cities.

In San Francisco, [[The Committee (improv group)|The Committee]] theater was active in North Beach during the 1960s. It was founded by alumni of Chicago's Second City, [[Alan Myerson]] and his wife Jessica. When The Committee disbanded in 1972, three major companies were formed: The Pitchell Players, The Wing, and Improvisation Inc. The only company that continued to perform Close's [[Harold (improvisation)|Harold]] was the latter one. Its two former members, Michael Bossier and John Elk, formed Spaghetti Jam in San Francisco's [[Old Spaghetti Factory]] in 1976, where shortform improv and Harolds were performed through 1983. Stand-up comedians performing down the street at the [[Intersection for the Arts]] would drop by and sit in. In 1979, Elk brought shortform to England, teaching workshops at [[Jacksons Lane]] Theatre, and he was the first American to perform at [[The Comedy Store, London]], above a Soho strip club.

Modern political improvisation's roots include [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s work in Poland during the late 1950s and early 1960s, [[Peter Brook]]'s "happenings" in England during the late 1960s, [[Augusto Boal]]'s "Forum Theatre" in South America in the early 1970s, and San Francisco's [[Diggers (theater)|The Diggers]]' work in the 1960s. Some of this work led to pure improvisational performance styles, while others simply added to the theatrical vocabulary and were, on the whole, [[avant-garde]] experiments.

[[Joan Littlewood]], an English actress and director who was active from the 1930s to 1970s, made extensive use of improv in developing plays for performance. However, she was successfully prosecuted twice for allowing her actors to improvise in performance. Until 1968, British law required scripts to be approved by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]]. The department also sent inspectors to some performances to check that the approved script was performed exactly as approved.

In 1987, [[Annoyance Theatre]] began as a club in Chicago that emphasizes longform improvisation. The Annoyance Theatre has grown into multiple locations in Chicago and New York City. It is the home of the longest running musical improv show in history at 11 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theannoyance.com/about-the-annoyance/history-of-the-annoyance/|title=History of the Annoyance {{!}} The Annoyance Theatre &amp; Bar|website=theannoyance.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, Lebanese writer and director [[Lucien Bourjeily]] used improvisational theater techniques to create a multi-sensory play entitled ''66 Minutes in Damascus''. This play premiered at the London International Festival of Theater, and is considered one of the most extreme kinds of interactive improvised theater put on stage. The audience play the part of kidnapped tourists in today's Syria in a hyperreal sensory environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exeuntmagazine.com/reviews/66-minutes-in-damascus/|title=Review of 66 Minutes in Damascus at Shoreditch Town Hall - Exeunt Magazine|author=Lois Jeary|work=exeuntmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rob Wittig and Mark C. Marino have developed a form of improv for online theatrical improvisation called [[netprov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dichtung-digital.de/en/journal/aktuelle-nummer/?postID=577|title=Current Issue - Dichtung Digital|work=dichtung-digital.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form relies on [[social media]] to engage audiences in the creation of dynamic fictional scenarios that evolve in real-time.

==Improvisational comedy==
[[File:Improvisers in Chicago.jpeg|thumb|Three improvisers performing longform improv comedy at the Gorilla Tango Theatre in Chicago.]]
Modern improvisational comedy, as it is practiced in the West, falls generally into two categories: shortform and longform.

Shortform improv consists of short scenes usually constructed from a predetermined [[Theater game|game]], structure, or idea and driven by an audience suggestion. Many shortform exercises were first created by Viola Spolin, who called them theater games, influenced by her training from recreational games expert [[Neva Boyd]].&lt;ref name="Spolin"/&gt; The shortform improv comedy television series ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (disambiguation)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'' has familiarized American and British viewers with shortform.

Longform improv performers create shows in which short scenes are often interrelated by story, characters, or themes. Longform shows may take the form of an existing type of theatre, for example a full-length play or [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-style [[musical theater|musical]] such as [[Spontaneous Broadway]]. One of the better-known longform structures is [[Harold (improvisation)|the Harold]], developed by [[IO Theater|ImprovOlympic]] co-founder [[Del Close]]. Many such longform structures now exist. Longform improvisation is especially performed in [[Chicago]], [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]]; has a strong presence in [[Austin]], [[Boston]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Philadelphia]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]], [[Detroit]], [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]], [[Washington, D.C.]]; and is building a growing following in [[Denver]], [[Montreal]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[New Orleans]], [[Omaha]], [[Rochester, NY|Rochester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rochesterhomepage.net/fulltext?nxd_id=351262 |title=Fall Back Comedy Festival this weekend |accessdate=2015-01-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103093553/http://rochesterhomepage.net/fulltext?nxd_id=351262 |archivedate=November 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hawaii]]. Outside the [[United States]], longform improv has a growing presence in the [[United Kingdom]], especially in cities such as [[London]],&lt;ref&gt;[[List of improvisational theatre companies]]{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bristol]], and at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

==Non-comedic, experimental, and dramatic, narrative-based improvisational theater==
Other forms of improvisational theatre training and performance techniques are [[Experimental theatre|experimental]] and avant-garde&lt;ref&gt;Experimental Theatre from Stanislavsky to Peter Brook by James Roose Evans&lt;/ref&gt; in nature and not necessarily intended to be [[comedy|comedic]]. These include [[Playback Theatre]] and [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], the [[Jerzy Grotowski|Poor Theatre]], [[the Open Theatre]], to name only a few.

[[The Open Theatre]] was founded in New York City by a group of former students of acting teacher [[Nola Chilton]], and joined shortly thereafter by director [[Joseph Chaikin]], formerly of [[The Living Theatre]], and Peter Feldman. This avante-garde theatre group explored political, artistic, and social issues. The company, developing work through an improvisational process drawn from Chilton and [[Viola Spolin]], created well-known exercises, such as "sound and movement" and "transformations", and originated radical forms and techniques that anticipated or were contemporaneous with [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s "[[poor theater]]" in Poland.[1]{{clarify|date=October 2016|reason="[1]"? Was someone trying to make a citation there?}} During the sixties Chaikin and the Open Theatre developed full theatrical productions with nothing but the actors, a few chairs and a bare stage, creating character, time and place through a series of transformations the actors physicalized and discovered through improvisations.

Longform, dramatic, and narrative-based improvisation is well-established on the west coast with companies such as San Francisco's [[BATS Improv]]. This format allows for full-length plays and musicals to be created improvisationally.

==Applying improv principles in life==
Many people who have studied improv have noted that the guiding principles of improv are useful, not just on stage, but in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/embracing-the-dark-side/200908/everything-i-need-know-i-learned-improv|title=Everything I Need to Know, I Learned from Improv|work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Stephen Colbert]] in a commencement address said,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Colbert 2006 Commencement Address at Knox College [http://departments.knox.edu/newsarchive/news_events/2006/x12547.html Transcript]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Well, you are about to start the greatest improvisation of all. With no script. No idea what's going to happen, often with people and places you have never seen before. And you are not in control. So say "yes." And if you're lucky, you'll find people who will say "yes" back.}}

[[Tina Fey]] in her book ''[[Bossypants]]'' lists several rules of improv that apply in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.women2.org/tina-feys-rules-for-improv-and-your-career/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109232959/http://www.women2.org/tina-feys-rules-for-improv-and-your-career/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-01-09 |title=Tina Fey's Rules For Improv… And Your Career |work=Women 2.0 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been much interest in bringing lessons from improv into the corporate world. In a New York Times article titled [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/business/02unbox.html "Can Executives Learn to Ignore the Script?"], Stanford professor and author, Patricia Ryan Madson notes, "executives and engineers and people in transition are looking for support in saying yes to their own voice. Often, the systems we put in place to keep us secure are keeping us from our more creative selves."

==In film and television==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
Many directors have made use of improvisation in the creation of both mainstream and experimental films. Many [[silent film]]makers such as [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]] used improvisation in the making of their films, developing their gags while filming and altering the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] to fit. The [[Marx Brothers]] were notorious for deviating from the script they were given, their [[ad lib]]s often becoming part of the standard routine and making their way into their films. Many people, however, make a distinction between ad-libbing and improvising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/improvise-v-ad-lib.2495051/|title=improvise v. ad-lib|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British director [[Mike Leigh]] makes extensive use of improvisation in the creation of his films, including improvising important moments in the characters' lives that will not even appear in the film. ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' and other [[mockumentary]] films of director [[Christopher Guest]] are created with a mix of scripted and unscripted material and ''[[Blue in the Face]]'' is a 1995 comedy directed by Wayne Wang and Paul Auster created in part by the improvisations during the filming of ''[[Smoke (film)|Smoke]]''.

Some of the best known American film directors who are noted for their use of improvisation in their work with actors are [[John Cassavetes]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Christopher Guest]] and [[Rob Reiner]].

Improv comedy techniques have also been used in television and [[Stand-up comedian|stand-up comedy]] in hit shows such as [[HBO|HBO's]] television show ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' created by [[Larry David]], the UK Channel 4 and ABC television series ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway]]'' (and its spinoffs ''[[Drew Carey's Green Screen Show]]'' and ''[[Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza]]''), Nick Cannon's improv comedy show ''[[Wild 'N Out]]'', and ''[[Thank God You're Here]]''. In Canada, the series ''[[Train 48]]'' was improvised from scripts which contained a minimal outline of each scene, and the comedy series ''[[This Sitcom Is...Not to Be Repeated]]'' incorporated dialogue drawn from a hat during the course of an episode. The American show ''Reno 911!'' also contained improvised dialogue based on a plot outline. ''[[Fast and Loose (TV series)|Fast and Loose]]'' is an improvisational game show, much like ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?''. The BBC sitcoms ''[[Outnumbered (UK TV series)|Outnumbered]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/06/television-bbc|title=BBC sitcom lets kids improvise|author=Ben Dowell|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Thick of It]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/the-thick-of-it-back-in-the-loop-1805589.html|title=The Thick of It: Back in the loop|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; also had some improvised elements in them.

==Psychology==
In the field of the psychology of [[consciousness]], Eberhard Scheiffele explored the altered state of consciousness experienced by actors and improvisers in his scholarly paper ''Acting: an altered state of consciousness''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scheiffele |first1=Eberhard |journal=Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance |title=an altered state of consciousness |date=2001 |volume= 6 |issue=2 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13569780120070722#preview |doi=10.1080/13569780120070722 |pages=179–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to G. William Farthing in ''The Psychology of Consciousness'' comparative study, actors routinely enter into an altered state of consciousness (ASC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci-con.org/2004/12/levels-of-consciousness/ |title=Levels of Consciousness |work=sci-con.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acting is seen as altering most of the 14 dimensions of changed subjective experience which characterize ASCs according to Farthing, namely: attention, perception, imagery and fantasy, inner speech, memory, higher-level thought processes, meaning or significance of experiences, time experience, emotional feeling and expression, level of arousal, self-control, suggestibility, body image, and sense of personal identity.

In the growing field of [[Drama Therapy]], [[psychodrama]]tic improvisation, along with other techniques developed for [[Drama Therapy]], are used extensively. The ''[[Yes, and...|"Yes, and"]]'' rule has been compared to [[Milton Erickson]]'s ''utilization'' process and to a variety of acceptance-based psychotherapies. Improv training has been recommended for [[couples therapy]] and therapist training, and it has been speculated that improv training may be helpful in some cases of [[social anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfxmachine.com/docs/yes,_and.pdf|title=Yes, and: Acceptance, Resistance, and Change in Improv, Aikido, and Psychotherapy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05xcvc2|title=BBC World Service - People Fixing The World, Improvising Your Way Out of Anxiety|last=|first=|date=|website=[[BBC]]|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and process==
Improvisational theatre often allows an interactive relationship with the audience. Improv groups frequently solicit suggestions from the audience as a source of inspiration, a way of getting the audience involved, and as a means of proving that the performance is not scripted. That charge is sometimes aimed at the masters of the art, whose performances can seem so detailed that viewers may suspect the scenes are planned.

In order for an improvised [[scene (fiction)|scene]] to be successful, the improvisers involved must work together responsively to define the parameters and action of the scene, in a process of [[co-creation]]. With each spoken word or action in the scene, an improviser makes an ''offer'', meaning that he or she defines some element of the reality of the scene. This might include giving another character a name, identifying a relationship, location, or using [[Mime artist|mime]] to define the physical environment. These activities are also known as ''endowment''. It is the responsibility of the other improvisers to accept the offers that their fellow performers make; to not do so is known as blocking, negation, or denial, which usually prevents the scene from developing. Some performers may deliberately block (or otherwise break out of character) for comedic effect—this is known as ''gagging''—but this generally prevents the scene from advancing and is frowned upon by many improvisers. Accepting an offer is usually accompanied by adding a new offer, often building on the earlier one; this is a process improvisers refer to as ''[[Yes, and...|"Yes, And..."]]'' and is considered the cornerstone of improvisational technique. Every new piece of information added helps the improvisers to refine their characters and progress the action of the scene. The ''"Yes, And..."'' rule, however, applies to a scene's early stage since it is in this stage that a "base (or shared) reality" is established in order to be later redefined by applying the ''"if (this is true), then (what else can also be true)"'' practice progressing the scene into comedy, as explained in the 2013 manual by the ''[[Upright Citizens Brigade]]'' members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/arts/upright-citizens-brigade-writes-its-book-on-improv.html?_r=0 Get the Laughs, but Follow the Rules], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 20 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The unscripted nature of improv also implies no predetermined knowledge about the [[Theatrical property|props]] that might be useful in a scene. Improv companies may have at their disposal some number of readily accessible props that can be called upon at a moment's notice, but many improvisers eschew props in favor of the infinite possibilities available through [[mime artist|mime]]. In improv, this is more commonly known as 'space object work' or 'space work', not 'mime', and the props and locations created by this technique, as 'space objects' created out of 'space substance,' developed as a technique by Viola Spolin.&lt;ref name="Spolin"/&gt; As with all improv ''offers'', improvisers are encouraged to respect the validity and [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of the imaginary environment defined by themselves and their fellow performers; this means, for example, taking care not to walk through the table or "miraculously" survive multiple bullet wounds from another improviser's gun.

Because improvisers may be required to play a variety of roles without preparation, they need to be able to construct characters quickly with physicality, [[gesture]]s, [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]], [[human voice|voice]] changes, or other techniques as demanded by the situation. The improviser may be called upon to play a character of a different age or sex. Character motivations are an important part of successful improv scenes, and improvisers must therefore attempt to act according to the objectives that they believe their character seeks.

==Community==
Many theatre troupes are devoted to staging improvisational performances and growing the improv community through their training centers.

In addition to for-profit theatre troupes, there are many college-based improv groups in the United States and around the world.

In Europe the special contribution to the theatre of the abstract, the surreal, the irrational and the subconscious have been part of the stage tradition for centuries. From the 1990s onwards a growing number of European [[Improv groups]] have been set up specifically to explore the possibilities offered by the use of the abstract in improvised performance, including dance, movement, sound, music, mask work, lighting, and so on. These groups are not especially interested in comedy, either as a technique or as an effect, but rather in expanding the improv genre so as to incorporate techniques and approaches that have long been a legitimate part of European theatre.

==Notable Contributors To The Field==
Some key figures in the development of improvisational theatre are [[Viola Spolin]] and her son [[Paul Sills]], founder of Chicago's famed [[The Second City|Second City]] troupe and originator of [[Theater Games]], and [[Del Close]], founder of [[ImprovOlympic]] (along with [[Charna Halpern]]) and creator of a popular longform improv format known as [[The Harold]]. Other luminaries include [[Keith Johnstone]], the British teacher and writer–author of ''[[Impro]]'', who founded the Theatre Machine and whose teachings form the foundation of the popular shortform [[Theatresports]] format, [[Dick Chudnow]], founder of [[ComedySportz]] which evolved its family-friendly show format from Johnstone's Theatersports, and Bill Johnson, creator/director of [https://web.archive.org/web/20071115124528/http://magicmeathands.com/ The Magic Meathands], who pioneered the concept of "Commun-edy Outreach" by tailoring performances to non-traditional audiences, such as the homeless and foster children.

[[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]], with Paul Sills, founded [[The Compass Players]] in Chicago. Shepherd was intent on developing a true "people's Theatre", and hoped to bring political drama to the stockyards. The Compass went on to play in numerous forms and companies, in a number of cities including NY and Hyannis, after the founding of The Second City. A number of Compass members were also founding members of The Second City. In the 1970s, Shepherd began experimenting with group-created videos. He is the author of "That Movie In Your Head", about these efforts. In the 1970s, David Shepherd and Howard Jerome created the Improvisational Olympics, a format for competition based improv. The Improv Olympics were first demonstrated at Toronto's Homemade Theatre in 1976 and have been continued on as the [[Canadian Improv Games]]. In the United States, the Improv Olympics were later produced by Charna Halpern under the name "ImprovOlympic" and now as "IO"; IO operates training centers and theaters in Chicago and Los Angeles. At IO, Halpern combined Shepherd's "Time Dash" game with Del Close's "Harold" game; the revised format for the Harold became the fundamental structure for the development of modern longform improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;An account of this process which lead up to the development of modern longform improvisation, as seen through first-person accounts of Shepherd and Halpern, can be found in the following documentary film: {{cite AV media |people=Mike Fly |date= |year=2010 |title=David Shepherd: A Lifetime in Improvisational Theatre |trans-title= |medium= |language= |url=https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5wgtkgCH3A |access-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 Jonathan Fox founded [[Playback Theatre]], a form of improvised community theatre which is often not comedic and replays stories as shared by members of the audience.

[[The Groundlings]] is a popular and influential improv theatre and training center in [[Los Angeles]], California. [[Gary Austin]], founder of The Groundlings, continues to teach improvisation around the country, focusing especially in Los Angeles. He is widely acclaimed as one of the greatest acting teachers in America. His work is grounded in the lessons he learned as an improviser at The Committee with Del Close, as well as in his experiences as founding director of The Groundlings. The Groundlings is often seen as the Los Angeles training ground for the "second generation" of improv luminaries and troupes. Stan Wells developed the "Clap-In" style of longform improvisation here, later using this as the basis for his own theatre, The Empty Stage which in turn bred multiple troupes utilizing this style.

In the late 1990s, [[Matt Besser]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Ian Roberts (American actor)|Ian Roberts]], and [[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]] founded the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] in New York and later they founded one in Los Angeles, each with an accompanying improv/sketch comedy school. In September 2011 the UCB opened a third theatre in New York City's East Village, known as UCBeast.

Gunter Lösel compared the existing improvisational theater theories (from Moreno, Spolin, Johnstone, Close...), structured them and wrote a general theory of improvisational theater.&lt;ref&gt;''Das Spiel mit dem Chaos - Zur Performativität des Improvisationstheaters''.

[[Sharia]] or sharia law is the basic Islamic [[religious law]] derived from the religious precepts of [[Islam]], particularly the [[Quran]] and the opinions and life example of [[Muhammad]] ([[Hadith]] and [[Sunnah]]) which are the primary [[sources of sharia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Dictionar Definition of sharia in English|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/sharia|website=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Esposito, John 2001"&gt;[[John Esposito|John L.

[[Syracuse University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0815629085}}. Quote: "[...], by the ninth century, the classical theory of law fixed the sources of Islamic law at four: the ''Quran'', the ''Sunnah'' of the Prophet, ''qiyas'' (analogical reasoning), and ''ijma'' (consensus)."&lt;/ref&gt; For topics and issues not directly addressed in these primary sources, sharia is derived. The derivation differs between the various [[Islamic schools and branches|sects of Islam]] ([[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] are the majority), and various jurisprudence schools such as [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] and [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Jafari]].&lt;ref name=hmr&gt;Hisham M.

The first military rulings were formulated during the first hundred years after Muhammad [[Hijra (Islam)|established an Islamic state in Medina]]. These rulings evolved in accordance with the interpretations of the Quran (the Muslim Holy scriptures) and Hadith (the recorded traditions of Muhammad). The key themes in these rulings were the [[Justice|justness]] of war (see [[Justice in the Quran]]), and the injunction to jihad. The rulings do not cover [[feud]]s and armed conflicts in general.&lt;ref name=Zuhur&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aboul-Enein|first1=H.

Some have pointed out that the current Western view of the need for a clear separation between Church and State was only [[Separation of church and state#Jefferson and the Bill of Rights|first legislated into effect]] after 18 centuries of Christianity in the Western world.&lt;ref name="church state evolution"&gt;[http://counterjihad.com/separation-church-state-west-sharia "Separation of Church and State: In the West and Under Sharia"] By Immanuel Al-Manteeqi.

Additionally, some notable Muslim clerics, such as [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] have developed alternative non-violent Muslim theologies.

According to [[Jonathan Berkey]], jihad in the Quran was maybe originally intended against Muhammad's local enemies, the [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|pagans]] of Mecca or the [[Banu Qurayza|Jews of Medina]], but the Quranic statements supporting jihad could be redirected once new enemies appeared.&lt;ref name="Berkey2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkey|first=Jonathan Porter|authorlink=Jonathan Berkey|title=The Formation of Islam: Religion and Society in the Near East, 600-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mLV6lo4mvj0C&amp;pg=PA73|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-58813-3|page=73|quote=The Koran is not a squeamish document, and exhort the believers to jihad. Verses such as "Do not follow the unbelievers, but struggle against them mightily" (25.52) and "fight [those who have been given a revelation] who do not believe in God  and the last day" (9.29) may originally have been directed against Muhammad's local enemies, the pagans of Mecca or the Jews of Medina, but could be redirected once a new set of enemies appeared.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first documentation of the law of Jihad was written by 'Abd al-Rahman al-Awza'i and [[Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Shaybani]].

The first forms of military Jihad occurred after the migration ([[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]) of Muhammad and his small group of followers to [[Muhammad in Medina|Medina]] from [[Muhammad in Mecca|Mecca]] and the conversion of several inhabitants of the city to Islam. The first revelation concerning the struggle against the Meccans was [[Al-Hajj|surah 22]], verses 39–40:&lt;ref&gt;William M. Watt: ''Muhammad at Medina'', p. 4; q.v. the [[Tafsir]] regarding these verses&lt;/ref&gt;
The main focus of Muhammad's later years was increasing the number of allies as well as the amount of territory under Muslim control.&lt;ref name="DavidCook2005"&gt;David Cook, ''Understanding Jihad''; University of California Press: CA, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Richard Edwards and [[Sherifa Zuhur]], offensive jihad was the type of jihad practiced by the early Muslim community, because their weakness meant "no defensive action would have sufficed to protect them against the allied tribal forces determined to exterminate them." Jihad as a collective duty (''[[Fard]] Kifaya'') and offensive jihad are synonymous in classical Islamic law and tradition, which also asserted that offensive jihad could only be declared by the caliph, but an "individually incumbent jihad" (''Fard Ayn'') required only "awareness of an oppression targeting Islam or Islamic peoples."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards |first1=Richard |last2=Zuhur|first2=Sherifa |title=The Encyclopedia of the Arab-Israeli Conflict: A Political, Social, and|page=553|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YAd8efHdVzIC&amp;pg=PA553&amp;dq=jihad+declared+by+caliph&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMIh7D86LCfyAIVFxKSCh1bnQiW#v=onepage&amp;q=jihad%20declared%20by%20caliph&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tina Magaard, associate professor at the [[Aarhus University]] Department of Business Development and Technology, has analyzed the texts of the 10 largest religions in the world.

She has also argued that they contain direct incitements to terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Jyllands-Posten|url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE5097347/Islam-er-den-mest-krigeriske-religion/|title=Islam er den mest krigeriske religion|date=Oct 9, 2005|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Ghazi (warrior)|Ghazi]] ([[Wiktionary:ghazi|غازي]]) is an Arabic term originally referring to an individual who participates in Ghazw (غزو), meaning military expeditions or raiding; after the emergence of Islam, it took on new connotations of religious warfare. The related word Ghazwa (غزوة) is a singulative form meaning a battle or military expedition, often one led by Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Aboul-Enein, H. Yousuf and Zuhur, Sherifa,"''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1428910395&amp;id=5F-JEmNr9yUC&amp;printsec=frontcover Islamic Rulings on Warfare'']", Strategic Studies Institute, US Army War College, Diane Publishing Co., Darby PA, {{ISBN|1-4289-1039-5}} p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Caravan raids]] were a series of raids in which Muhammed and his [[Sahabah|companions]] participated. The raids were generally offensive and carried out to gather intelligence or seize the trade goods of [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]] financed by the [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]].&lt;ref name="Watt1974"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Montgomery Watt|title=Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RV7uAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=26 February 2016|year=1974|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The raids were intended to weaken the economy of [[Mecca]] by Muhammad. His followers were also impoverished.&lt;ref name="Gabriel2007"/&gt; Muhammad broke an Arab tradition of not attacking one's own kinsmen by raiding caravans.&lt;ref name="Gabriel2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard A.

Islamic Doctrines teachings on matters of war and peace have become topics of heated discussion in recent years. Charles Matthews writes that there is a "large debate about what the Quran commands as regards the '[[sword verses]]' and the 'peace verses'".  According to Matthews, "the question of the proper prioritization of these verses, and how they should be understood in relation to one another, has been a central issue for Islamic thinking about war."&lt;ref name=Mathewes&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Religious Ethics |first=Charles T. |last=Mathewes|publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2010 |page=197 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EyCsZE_iHp4C&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=Koran+%22sword+verses%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dipak Gupta, "much of the religious justification of violence against nonbelievers (Dar ul [[Kufr]]) by the promoters of jihad is based on the Quranic “sword verses.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=

On the other hand, other scholars argue that such verses of the Qur'an are interpreted out of context,&lt;ref name="Boundries_Princeton"&gt;Sohail H. Hashmi, David Miller, ''Boundaries and Justice: diverse ethical perspectives'', Princeton University Press, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www-rohan.sdsu.edu"&gt;Khaleel Muhammad, professor of religious studies at San Diego State University, states, regarding his discussion with the critic Robert Spencer, that "when I am told ... that Jihad only means war, or that I have to accept interpretations of the Qur'an that non-Muslims (with no good intentions or knowledge of Islam) seek to force upon me, I see a certain agendum developing: one that is based on hate, and I refuse to be part of such an intellectual crime." {{cite web|url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708102707/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/ |archivedate= 8 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Micheline R. Ishay has argued that "the Quran justifies wars for self-defense to protect Islamic communities against internal or external aggression by non-Islamic populations, and wars waged against those who 'violate their oaths' by breaking a treaty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|9|12|end=15|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|42|39|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ishay, Micheline|title=The history of human rights |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley |year=|page=45 |isbn=0-520-25641-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner]] stated that jihad, even in self-defence, is "strictly limited".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaiil.org/uk/newsletters/2002/0302ukbulletin.pdf Article on Jihad] by Dr. G. W. Leitner (founder of The Oriental Institute, UK) published in Asiatic Quarterly Review, 1886. ("Jihad, even when explained as a righteous effort of waging war in self defense against the grossest outrage on one's religion, is strictly limited..")&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Oliver Leaman, a number of Islamic jurists asserted the primacy of the “sword verses” over the conciliatory verses in specific historical circumstances.&lt;ref name="Leaman2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oliver Leaman|authorlink=Oliver Leaman|title=Jewish Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DLLKcZuGCQ4C&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=13 December 2015|year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-08868-5|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to Diane Morgan, [[Ibn Kathir]] (1301–1372) asserted that the Sword Verse [[Naskh (tafsir)|abrogated]] all [[Hudna|peace treaties]] that had been promulgated between Muhammad and idolaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Essential Islam: a comprehensive guide to belief and practice |first=Diane |last=Morgan|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2010 |page=89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U94S6N2zECAC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=sword+verses+quran#v=onepage&amp;q=sword%20verses%20quran&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic Modernism|Islamic modernists]] reject the abrogating status of the sword verses, which would result in the abrogation (naskh) of numerous Quranic verses that counsel peace and reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Shariʻa as discourse: legal traditions and the encounter with Europe |first1=Jørgen S.|last1=Nielsen |first2=Lisbet |last2=Christoffersen |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year=2010 |page=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0VJ_t0F7ZGEC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Quran+%22sword+verses%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20%22sword%20verses%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Muslims and modernity: an introduction to the issues and debates |first=Clinton |last=Bennett |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2005|page=220 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D0vYYovH7OQC&amp;dq=Koran+%22sword+verses%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] travel Muhammad struggled non-violently against his oppressors in Mecca.&lt;ref name="cultures"&gt;Boulding, Elise. "Cultures of Peace: The Hidden Side of History", p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until after the exile that the [[Muhammad's first revelation|Quranic revelations]] began to adopt a more defensive perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Lawrence.

====Hadiths====

{{See also|Criticism of Hadith}}
The context of the Quran is elucidated by Hadith (the teachings, deeds and sayings of Muhammad). Of the 199 references to jihad in perhaps the most standard collection of hadith—[[Sahih Bukhari|Bukhari]]—all refer to warfare.&lt;ref name=bukhari&gt;Muhammad ibn Isma'il Bukhari, The Translation of the Meaning of Sahih al-Bukhari, trans.

===== Quranism =====
{{main article|Quranism}}
[[Quranists]] reject the hadith and follow the Quran only.

====Ahmadiyya====
{{Main article|Ahmadiyya view on Jihad|Ahmadiyya#Abrogation|Persecution of Ahmadis}}

According to [[Ahmadi]] Muslim belief, Jihad can be divided into three categories: ''Jihad al-Akbar'' (Greater Jihad) is that against the self and refers to striving against one's low desires such as anger, lust and hatred; ''Jihad al-Kabīr'' (Great Jihad) refers to the peaceful propagation of Islam, with special emphasis on spreading the true message of Islam by the ''pen''; ''Jihad al-Asghar'' (Smaller Jihad) is only for self-defence under situations of extreme religious persecution whilst not being able to follow one's fundamental religious beliefs, and even then only under the direct instruction of the [[Ahmadiyya Caliphate|Caliph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whyahmadi.org/3_10.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414065050/http://www.whyahmadi.org/3_10.html | archivedate=2012-04-14 | title=Suspension of Jihad | accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valentine2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Ross Valentine|title=Islam and the Ahmadiyya Jama'at: History, Belief, Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MdRth02Q6nAC&amp;pg=PA190|year=2008|publisher=C.

{{Quote|As far as Islam is concerned, it categorically rejects and condemns every form of terrorism. It does not provide any cover or justification for any act of violence, be it committed by an individual, a group or a government.}}

Various Ahmadis scholars, such as [[Muhammad Ali (writer)|Muhammad Ali]], [[Maulana Sadr-ud-Din]] and [[Basharat Ahmad]], argue that when the Quran's verses are read in context, it clearly appears that the Quran prohibits initial aggression, and allows fighting only in self-defense.&lt;ref name="Ali, Maulana Muhammad - p. 414"&gt;Ali, Maulana Muhammad; The Religion of Islam (6th Edition), Ch V "Jihad" p. 414 "When shall war cease".

[http://www.aaiil.org/text/books/mali/religionislam/religionofislam.pdf link]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadi Muslims believe that no verse of the Quran abrogates or cancels another verse. All Quranic verses have equal validity, in keeping with their emphasis on the "unsurpassable beauty and unquestionable validity of the Qur'ān".&lt;ref name="Friedmann"&gt;[[Yohanan Friedmann|Friedmann]], ''Jihād in Ahmadī Thought'', {{ISBN|965-264-014-X}}, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; The harmonization of apparently incompatible rulings is resolved through their juridical deflation in Ahmadī ''[[fiqh]]'', so that a ruling (considered to have applicability only to the specific [[asbab al-nuzul|situation for which it was revealed]]), is effective not because it was revealed last, but because it is most suited to the situation at hand.&lt;ref name="Friedmann"/&gt;

Ahmadis are considered non-Muslims by the mainstream Muslims since they consider [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], founder of Ahmadiyya, as the promised [[Mahdi]] and [[Messiah]].&lt;ref name="Naeem Osman Memon 1994"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/3in1/chap2/index.html | title=An Enemy a Disbeliever a Liar, Claims of Hadhrat Ahmad | publisher=Islam International Publications | author=Naeem Osman Memon | year=1994 |isbn=1-85372-552-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B.A Rafiq 1978"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/truth/reflection.html | title=Truth about Ahmadiyyat, Reflection of all the Prophets |publisher=London Mosque | author=B.A Rafiq | year=1978 |isbn=0-85525-013-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirza Tahir Ahmad 1998"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_7_section_1.html | title=Revelation Rationality Knowledge and Truth, Future of Revelation|publisher=Islam International Publications | author=Mirza Tahir Ahmad | authorlink=Mirza Tahir Ahmad | year=1998 |isbn=1-85372-640-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lago2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Lago|title=The Handbook of Transcultural Counselling and Psychotherapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9vREBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA312|accessdate=13 December 2015|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK)|isbn=978-0-335-23851-4|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of Islamic countries, especially Sunni-dominated nations, Ahmadis have been considered heretics and non-Muslim, and have been subject to various forms of [[Persecution of religious minorities by Muslims|religious persecution]], [[Religious discrimination|discrimination]] and systematic oppression since the movement's inception in 1889.&lt;ref name="Naeem Osman Memon 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B.A Rafiq 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lago2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060819140154/http://www.theasa.org/conferences/asa04/panels/panel21.htm "Localising Diaspora: the Ahmadi Muslims and the problem of multi-sited ethnography".] Association of Social Anthropologists, 2004 conference panel.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam and crime===
{{Main article|Islamic criminal jurisprudence|Hudud|Qisas|Tazir}}

The Islamic criminal law is [[criminal law]] in accordance with Sharia. Strictly speaking, Islamic law does not have a distinct corpus of "criminal law."

In contrast to human rights activists, Islamic scholars and Islamist political parties consider 'universal human rights' arguments as imposition of a non-Muslim culture on Muslim people, a disrespect of customary cultural practices and sexual codes that are central to Islam.

==Terrorism==

{{Islamism sidebar}}
[[Islamic terrorism]] is, by definition, [[Terrorism|terrorist acts]] committed by Muslim groups or individuals who profess Islamic or [[Islamism|Islamist]] motivations or goals. Islamic terrorists have relied on particular interpretations of the tenets of the Quran and the Hadith, citing these scriptures to justify violent tactics including mass murder, genocide, [[Islam and Pedophilia|child-molestation]] and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/12/world/meast/isis-justification-female-slaves/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|title=ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with 'unbelieving' women, girls is OK |author=Greg Botelho|date=12 December 2014|work=CNN|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, incidents of Islamic terrorism have occurred on a global scale, occurring not only in Muslim-majority states in Africa and Asia, but also abroad in [[Terrorism in the European Union|Europe]], [[Terrorism in Russia|Russia]], and the [[Terrorism in the United States|United States]], and such attacks have targeted Muslims and non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/24/isis-ideology-islamic-militants-british-appeal-iraq-syria|title=Isis: a contrived ideology justifying barbarism and sexual control|author=Mona Siddiqui|work=the Guardian|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of the worst-affected Muslim-majority regions, these terrorists have been met by armed, independent resistance groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/01/kurdish-peshmerga-kobani-isis-syria|title=Kurdish peshmerga forces arrive in Kobani to bolster fight against Isis|author=Constanze Letsch|work=the Guardian|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; state actors and their [[proxy war|proxies]], and politically liberal Muslim protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/388593/moderate-muslims-stand-against-isis-christine-sisto|title=Moderate Muslims Stand against ISIS |author=Christine Sisto|work=National Review Online|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pacifism in Islam ==
Islam does not have any normative tradition of [[pacifism]], and [[Islam and war|warfare]] has been integral part of Islamic history both for the defense and the spread of the faith since the time of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="Johnson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=James Turner|title=Holy War Idea in Western and Islamic Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoEjpRsvuzUC&amp;pg=PA20|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04214-1|pages=20–25|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300198171/islamic-imperialism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lews, Bernard, Islam and the West, Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] travel Muhammad struggled non-violently against his opposition in Mecca.&lt;ref name="cultures"&gt;Boulding, Elise. "Cultures of Peace: The Hidden Side of History", p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until after the exile that the [[Muhammad's first revelation|Quranic revelations]] began to adopt a more violent perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Lawrence. "Terrorism: Roots, Impact, Responses", p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting in self-defense is not only legitimate but considered obligatory upon Muslims, according to the Qur'an. The Qur'an, however, says that should the enemy's hostile behavior cease, then the reason for engaging the enemy also lapses.&lt;ref name =afsaruddin&gt;Afsaruddin, Asma (2007). ''Views of Jihad Throughout History''. Religion Compass 1 (1), pp. 165–69.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, different Muslim movements through history had linked pacifism with [[Muslim theology]].&lt;ref name="Osborn2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emily Lynn Osborn|title=Our New Husbands Are Here: Households, Gender, and Politics in a West African State from the Slave Trade to Colonial Rule|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vFHBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|date=10 October 2011|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=978-0-8214-4397-2|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Müller2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louise Müller|title=Religion and Chieftaincy in Ghana: An Explanation of the Persistence of a Traditional Political Institution in West Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T890Drkv9AoC&amp;pg=PA207|year=2013|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-643-90360-0|pages=207–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An American Witness to India's Partition by Phillips Talbot Year (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception of Islam==
===Negative perceptions===
Philip W. Sutton and Stephen Vertigans describe Western views on Islam as based on a [[stereotype]] of it as an inherently violent religion, characterizing it as a 'religion of the sword'. They characterize the image of Islam in the [[Western world]] as "dominated by conflict, aggression, 'fundamentalism', and global-scale violent terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Resurgent Islam: a sociological approach |first1=Philip W. |last1=Sutton |first2=Stephen |last2=Vertigans |publisher=Polity |year=2005 |page=7 |quote=Stereotypical views which portray Islam as an inherently violent religion, a 'religion of the sword' and an increasing global threat have thus been reinforced and even extended over recent years. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jhx1XlbhFhgC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QN4FTaL-Jo7msQOepuWODQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan Eduardo Campo writes that, "Europeans (have) viewed Islam in various ways: sometimes as a backward, violent religion; sometimes as an [[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]] fantasy; and sometimes as a complex and changing product of history and social life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Islam |first=Juan Eduardo |last=Campo |page=374 |publisher = Infobase Publishing| year= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Gleave writes that, "at the centre of popular conceptions of Islam as a violent religion are the punishments carried out by regimes hoping to bolster both their domestic and international Islamic credentials."&lt;ref name="HinnellsKing2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Hinnells|author2=Richard King|title=Religion and Violence in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wb1OBi3zvdkC&amp;pg=PA79|accessdate=26 February 2016|year=2007|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-08869-2|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attack on the US]] has led many non-Muslims to indict Islam as a violent religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion, power &amp; violence: expression of politics in contemporary times|first=Ram |last=Puniyani |publisher=SAGE |year=2005 |pages=97–98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fd5Fm79VMk8C&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=X30ETYusGcq-nAfihpnmDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Corrigan and Hudson, "some conservative Christian leaders (have) complained that Islam (is) incompatible with what they believed to be a Christian America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion in America: an historical account of the development of American religious life |first1=John|last1=Corrigan |first2=Winthrop Still |last2=Hudson |publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall |year=2004 |page=444 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVTuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Pat+Robertson+Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;dq=Pat+Robertson+Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TdQFTa6ZAY72tgPb9aDHDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of [[evangelical Christian]]s who have expressed such sentiments include [[Franklin Graham]], an [[Christianity in the United States|American Christian]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and [[missionary]], and [[Pat Robertson]], an American [[media mogul]], [[executive chairman]], and a former [[Southern Baptist]] minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Nation Challenged: The Religious Right; Islam Is Violent in Nature, Pat Robertson Says |publisher=New York Times |date=23 February 2002 |quote=The religious broadcaster Pat Robertson has described Islam as a"violent religion that wants to 'dominate and then, if need be, destroy'."|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/23/us/nation-challenged-religious-right-islam-violent-nature-pat-robertson-says.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a survey conducted by [[LifeWay Christian Resources|LifeWay Research]], a research group affiliated with the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], said that two out of three [[Protestantism|Protestant]] pastors believe that Islam is a "dangerous" religion.

Dr. Johannes J.G. Jansen was an Arabist who wrote an essay called “Religious Roots of Muslim Violence”, in which he discusses at length all aspects of the issue and unequivocally concludes that Muslim violence is mostly based on Islamic religious commands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabistjansen.nl/Arabist/pub_list_Engl_files/RelRootsMusViol.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage on terrorist attacks play a critical role in creating negative perceptions on Islam and Muslims. Powell  &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powell|first=Kimberly|date=2011|title=Framing Islam: An Analysis of U.S. Media Coverage of Terrorism Since 9/11|url=|journal=Communication Studies|volume=62|pages=90-112|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; described how Islam initially appeared in U.S. news cycles because of its relationships to oil, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and terrorism (92). Thus the audience was provided the base to associate Muslims to control of the resource of oil, war, and terrorism. A total of 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. soil since the 9/11 and their content coverage (in 1,638 news stories) in the national media had been analyzed "through frames composed of labels, common themes, and rhetorical associations" (Powell 94)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The key findings are summarized below: 
* The media coverage of terrorism in the U.S. feeds a culture of fear of Islam and describes  the United States as a good Christian nation (Powell 105). 
* A clear pattern of reporting had been detected that differentiates "terrorists who were Muslim with international ties and terrorists who were U.S. citizens with no clear international ties" (Powell 105). This was utilized to frame "war of Islam on the United States".
* "Muslim Americans are no longer ‘‘free’’ to practice and to name their religion without fear of prosecution, judgment, or connection to terrorism." (Powell 107)

===Favorable perceptions===
{{See also|Liberal Muslim movements|Cultural Muslim}}

In response to these perceptions, [[Ram Puniyani]], a [[secular]] activist and writer, says that "Islam does not condone violence but, like other religions, does believe in self-defence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion, power &amp; violence: expression of politics in contemporary times |first=Ram |last=Puniyani|publisher=SAGE |year=2005 |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fd5Fm79VMk8C&amp;pg=PA98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Juergensmeyer]] describes the teachings of Islam as ambiguous about violence. He states that, like all religions, Islam occasionally allows for force while stressing that the main spiritual goal is one of nonviolence and peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Terror in the mind of God: the global rise of religious violence |first=Mark |last=Juergensmeyer |publisher=University of California Press |year=2003 |page=80 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lpb1mbaHjGQC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=Qur%27an+violence&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eUsMTZ37PIqcsQON5uCJCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Qur%27an%20violence&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ralph W. Hood]], Peter C. Hill and Bernard Spilka write in ''The Psychology of Religion: An Empirical Approach'', "Although it would be a mistake to think that Islam is inherently a violent religion, it would be equally inappropriate to fail to understand the conditions under which believers might feel justified in acting violently against those whom their tradition feels should be opposed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Psychology of Religion: An Empirical Approach|first1=Ralph W. |last1=Hood |first2=Peter C.|last2=Hill |first3=Bernard |last3=Spilka |publisher=Guilford Press |year=2009|page=257 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETVk59xbc90C&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZbcFTb21G4uosAOp3ZiKDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Chandra Muzaffar]], a [[political scientist]], [[Liberal Muslim movements#Reform|Islamic reformist]] and [[activist]], says, "The Quranic exposition on resisting aggression, oppression and injustice lays down the parameters within which fighting or the use of violence is legitimate.

[[Pew Research Center|Pew research]] in 2010 found that in [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Nigeria]], roughly 50% of Muslims had favourable views of [[Hezbollah]], and that [[Hamas]] also saw similar support.&lt;ref name=PewDivided&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/|title=Muslim Publics Divided on Hamas and Hezbollah|date=2 December 2010|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Counter-terrorism]] researchers suggests that support for suicide bombings is rooted in opposition to real or perceived foreign military occupation, rather than Islam, according to a Department of Defense-funded study by University of Chicago researcher Robert Pape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rozen |first=Laura |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/laurarozen/1010/Researcher_Suicide_terrorism_linked_to_military_occupation.html?showall |title=Researcher: Suicide terrorism linked to military occupation - Laura Rozen |publisher=Politico.Com |date=2010-10-11 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for the [[National Post]], [[Barbara Kay]] stated that [[honor killing]] is not strictly a Muslim phenomenon and that it is enabled by factors including [[sexism]], dowries and a lack of a dependable legal system. Nevertheless, Kay says that the murders are a Muslim phenomenon in the West, where 95% of honor killings are perpetrated by "Muslim fathers and brothers or their proxies". Kay warns that females do not dissent as one might expect either: The women may describe victims of honor killing as having needed punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[Continue calling ‘honour killings’ by its rightful name, Barbara Kay, September 21, 2011, Full comment, National Post.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pew Research Center also found that support for the [[Islam and capital punishment|death penalty]] as punishment for "people who leave the Muslim religion" was 86% in Jordan, 84% in Egypt, 76% in Pakistan, 80% in Nigeria (all very large Muslim populations) and yet lower in some other countries.&lt;ref name=PewDivided/&gt; The different factors at play (e.g. sectarianism, poverty, etc.) and their relative impacts are not clarified.

According to 2006 data, Pew says that 46% of [[Islam in Nigeria|Nigerian Muslims]], 29% of [[Islam in Jordan|Jordan Muslims]], 28% of [[Islam in Egypt|Egyptian Muslims]], 15% of [[Islam in the United Kingdom|British Muslims]], and 8% of [[Islam in the United States|American Muslims]] thought suicide bombings are often or sometimes justified.&lt;ref name=PewMuslimAmericans&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/files/old-assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf|title=Muslim Americans – Middle class and mostly mainstream|date=22 May 2007|publisher=Pew Research Center|page=60|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure was unchanged – still 8% – for American Muslims by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/2011/08/30/muslim-americans-no-signs-of-growth-in-alienation-or-support-for-extremism/|title=Muslim Americans: No Signs of Growth in Alienation or Support for Extremism|date=30 August 2011|work=Pew Research Center for the People and the Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polls have found Muslim-Americans to report less violent views than any other religious group in America. 89% of Muslim-Americans claimed that the killing of civilians is never justified, compared to 71% of Catholics and Protestants, 75% of Jews, and 76% of atheists and non-religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/148763/Muslim-Americans-No-Justification-Violence.aspx|title=Most Muslim Americans See No Justification for Violence|publisher=gallup.com|date=2 August 2011|author=Nicole Naurath|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pew Research Center's 2013 poll showed that the majority of 14,244 Muslim, Christian and other respondents in 14 countries with substantial Muslim populations are concerned about Islamic extremism and hold negative views on known terrorist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/01/concerns-about-islamic-extremism-on-the-rise-in-middle-east/|title=Concerns about Islamic Extremism on the Rise in Middle East|publisher=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|date=1 July 2014|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gallup poll====
Gallup poll collected extensive data in a project called "Who Speaks for Islam?". [[John Esposito]] and [[Dalia Mogahed]] present data relevant to Islamic views on peace, and more, in their book ''Who Speaks for Islam?'' The book reports Gallup poll data from random samples in over 35 countries using Gallup's various research techniques (e.g. pairing male and female interviewers, testing the questions beforehand, communicating with local leaders when approval is necessary, travelling by foot if that is the only way to reach a region, etc.) &lt;ref name=GallupEM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/press/108457/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307065817/http://www.gallup.com/press/108457/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx|archivedate=2009-03-07|title=FAQs: Who Speaks for Islam?|publisher=gallup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a great deal of data. It suggests, firstly, that individuals who dislike America and consider the September 11 attacks to be "perfectly justified" form a statistically distinct group, with much more extreme views. The authors call this 7% of Muslims "Politically Radicalized".&lt;ref name=GallupEM/&gt; They chose that title "because of their radical political orientation" and clarify "we are not saying that all in this group commit acts of violence. However, those with extremist views are a potential source for recruitment or support for terrorist groups."&lt;ref name=GallupRadical&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/104941/what-makes-radical.aspx|publisher=Gallup.com|title=What Makes a Radical?|author=Gallup Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data also indicates that poverty is not simply to blame for the comparatively radical views of this 7% of Muslims, who tend to be better educated than moderates.&lt;ref name=GallupRadical/&gt;

The authors say that, contrary to what the media may indicate, most Muslims believe that the September 11 attacks cannot actually be justified at all. The authors called this 55% of Muslims "Moderates". Included in that category were an additional 12% who said the attacks ''almost'' cannot be justified at all (thus 67% of Muslims were classified as Moderates). 26% of Muslims were neither moderates nor radicals, leaving the remaining 7% called "[[Political radicalism|Politically Radicalized]]". Esposito and Mogahed explain that the labels should not be taken as being perfectly definitive. Because there may be individuals who would generally not be considered radical, although they believe the attacks were justified, or vice versa.&lt;ref name=GallupEM/&gt;

'''Killer toys''' are [[fiction]]al characters based on [[toy]]s, [[doll]]s or [[puppet]]s that commit violent acts. Reasons for these actions have included [[Demonic possession|possession]] by [[demon]]s, [[devil]]s, [[monster]]s, [[ghost]]s, [[supernatural]] creatures, [[Black magic|dark magic]], and malevolent or malfunctioning technology.

==Concept==
Toys coming to life is a common and historical concept in [[children's literature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nme7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA34 |title=Media Myths, Children's Nightmares |quote=Stories of toys that come to life can of course be found throughout the history of children's literature...}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the idea has been adapted into numerous [[horror film]]s and other [[horror fiction]]. The 1978 film ''[[Magic (1978 film)|Magic]]'' represents a key inspiration for subsequent films, while the subgenre's best-known films are the [[Child's Play (franchise)|''Child's Play'' franchise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Buckingham | first=David | year=1996 | title=Moving Images: Understanding Children's Emotional Responses to Television | publisher=Manchester University Press | isbn=978-0-7190-4595-0 | page=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lennard1"&gt;Lennard, Dominic W. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10304312.2012.630142 All fun and games…: children's culture in the horror film, from Deep Red (1975) to Child's Play (1988)], ''[[Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies]]'', Vol. 26, No. 1, pp. 133-142 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several works have used [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist's dummies]] as antagonists, with the dummies either being outlets for their operator's psychosis or acting malevolently on their own.&lt;ref name=io9vent&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trendacosta|first1=Katherine|title=The 10 Creepiest Ventriloquist Dummies of All Time|url=http://io9.com/the-10-creepiest-ventriloquist-dummies-of-all-time-458555695|website=io9|accessdate=12 October 2015|date=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Evil dolls are antagonists in episodes of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', both the 1959–1964 series and the 2002 version:
** 1962: "[[The Dummy]]" (3.33) with a ventriloquist dummy that attempts to exact revenge when he is replaced
** 1963: "[[Living Doll (The Twilight Zone)|Living Doll]]" (5.6) features Talky Tina (voiced by [[June Foray]]), a doll belonging to the stepdaughter of Erich Streator (played by [[Telly Savalas]])
** 1964: "[[Caesar and Me]]" (5.28)  features a ventriloquist dummy that goads his owner into committing robberies and deserts him when the police come for him
** 2002: "The Collection" features a young girl's strange collection of dolls which were made from her past babysitters
* The theme of evil toys has also been used in ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episodes:
** 1966: "[[The Celestial Toymaker]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Dr Who 10th Anniversary Special. Chapter: Dodo Chaplet / Jackie Lane |magazine=[[Radio Times]] |year=1973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{DWRG | id=cele | title=The Celestial Toymaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OG review | id=y | title=The Celestial Toymaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** 2011: "[[Night Terrors (Doctor Who)|Night Terrors]]"
* 1986: ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|Smurfs]]'' episode "Gargamel's Dummy," the series' antagonist [[Gargamel]] casts an [[dark magic|evil spell]] on a ventriloquist's dummy Jokey Smurf had created for a talent show, hoping to use it to help him destroy the Smurf village and ultimately, the Smurfs. The dummy was a parody of Gargamel, and the real Gargamel, angered upon learning of it, casts the spell to begin exacting his revenge.
* 1992: ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Treehouse of Horror III]]", the segment "Clown Without Pity" features a [[Krusty the Clown|Krusty]] doll that tries to kill [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]. The segment borrows elements from the ''Twilight Zone'' episode "Living Doll", the ''Child's Play'' films, ''[[Gremlins]]'', the 1975 TV film ''[[Trilogy of Terror]]'' segment "Amelia" about a killer [[Zuni mythology|Zuni]] [[Fetishism|fetish doll]] as well as its 1996 cinematic sequel ''[[Trilogy of Terror II]]'' segment "He Who Kills", which are both in turn adaptations of [[Richard Matheson]]'s 1969 short story, "Prey". The segment also borrows elements from ''[[Cape Fear (1991 film)|Cape Fear]]''. In a different episode, "[[The Ziff Who Came to Dinner]]", a possessed killer doll named "Baby Button Eyes" appears in a horror film, ''The Re-Deadening'' (a parody of ''Dolly Dearest''). The doll is most likely based on the real-life appearance of "Annabelle", a possessed [[Raggedy Ann]] doll.
* 1994: The ''[[Mega Man (1994 TV series)|Mega Man]]'' episode "Crime of the Century," Dr. Wily reprograms a bunch of dolls and other toys to perform robberies all over the city. However, it's all just a diversion so Wily can get his hands on something much more valuable: a giant black pearl.
* Ventriloquist dummies and dolls are also portrayed as evil in the works of [[R. L. Stine|R.L. Stine]]:
** 1994: The ''[[Goosebumps]]'' books and [[Goosebumps (TV series)|TV series]] had the "Night of the Living Dummy" stories which featured a sentient ventriloquist dummy named Slappy
** 2010: ''[[R. L. Stine's The Haunting Hour: The Series|R.L. Stine's The Haunting Hour]]'' featured Lilly D. in the episodes "Really You" Pt. 1 and 2 and "The Return of Lilly D"
* 2003: In the ''[[What's New, Scooby Doo?]]'' episode "Toy Scary Boo," the gang investigates a store with living toys that are taking it over.
* 2013: In the ''[[Grojband]]'' episode "No Strings Attached," Trina Riffin suffers from pupaphobia after she had wicked visions of puppets when she was a child.

[[File:Otsuriki Uguisu 02.jpg|thumb|From ''Otsuriki'' by Jippensha Ikku, the book about how to make shadow pictures, 1810]]
The {{Nihongo|'''''kokkeibon'''''|滑稽本||extra=literally "comical book"}} was a genre and type of early modern [[Japan]]ese [[novel]]. It came into being late in the [[Edo period]] during the 19th century. As a genre, it depicted the comical behavior occurring in daily life of the commoners.

The kokkeibon genre is the successor of the [[dangibon]] genre. [[Jippensha Ikku|Jippensha Ikku's]] ''[[Tōkaidōchū Hizakurige]]'' (1802–1822) is identified as the first representative novel. A less strict definition includes the dangibon as an "early kokkeibon".

Kokkeibon generally consists of dialogue between the main characters and includes illustrations. The genre was most popular between 1804 and 1830 and is most representative by the works of Jippensha Ikku and [[Shikitei Sanba]].

{{main|Literature|date=September 2018}}
A '''literary genre''' is a category of literary composition. Genres may be determined by [[literary technique]], [[setting tone|tone]], [[Content (media)|content]], or even (as in the case of fiction) length. The distinctions between genres and categories are flexible and loosely defined, often with subgroups.

The most general genres in literature are (in loose chronological order) [[epic poetry|epic]], [[tragedy]],&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 1983, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[comedy]], and [[creative nonfiction]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} They can all be in the form of [[prose]] or [[poetry]]. Additionally, a genre such as [[satire]], [[allegory]] or [[pastoral]] might appear in any of the above, not only as a subgenre (see below), but as a mixture of genres. Finally, they are defined by the general [[cultural movement]] of the [[historical period]] in which they were composed.

Genre should not be confused with age categories, by which literature may be classified as either adult, [[young adult fiction|young adult]], or [[children's literature|children's]]. They are also not the same as format, such as [[graphic novel]] or picture book.

==Genres==
{{details|List of writing genres}}
[[File:Britannica Shakespeare Roubiliac.jpg|thumb|200px|William Shakespeare's statue]]

Just as there are different types of painting: landscape, still life, portrait; there are different types of literary works. These types tend to share specific characteristics. Genres describe those works which share specific conventions.&lt;ref name=malani/&gt;

[[Genre]]s are often divided into [[subgenres]]. [[Literature]] is divided into the classic three forms of Ancient Greece, [[poetry]], [[drama]], and [[prose]].  Poetry may then be subdivided into the genres of [[lyric poetry|lyric]], [[epic poetry|epic]], and [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|dramatic]]. The lyric includes all the shorter forms of poetry, e.g., [[song]], ode, ballad, elegy, sonnet.&lt;ref name=malani&gt;[http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/cs6/genres.html "Genres", ''A Guide to the Study of Literature: A Companion Text for Core Studies 6, Landmarks of Literature'', English Department, Brooklyn College]&lt;/ref&gt; Dramatic poetry might include [[comedy]], [[tragedy]], [[melodrama]], and mixtures like [[tragicomedy]].

The standard division of drama into tragedy and comedy derives from Greek drama.&lt;ref name=malani/&gt; This parsing into subgenres can continue: ''comedy'' has its own subgenres, including, for example,  [[comedy of manners]], sentimental comedy, [[Burlesque|burlesque comedy]], and satirical comedy.

Often, the criteria used to divide up works into genres are not consistent, and may change constantly, and be subject of argument, change and challenge by both authors and critics. However, even a very loose term like [[fiction]] ("literature created from the imagination, not presented as fact, though it may be based on a true story or situation") is not universally applied to all fictitious literature, but instead is typically restricted to the use for novel, short story, and novella, but not fables, and is also usually a prose text. Types of fiction genres are science fiction and fantasy, historical fiction, realistic fiction and mysteries.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Semi-fiction spans stories that include a substantial amount of non-fiction. It may be the retelling of a true story with only the names changed.  The other way around, semi-fiction may also involve fictional events with a semi-fictional character, such as [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry Seinfeld]].

Genres may easily be confused with [[literary technique]]s, but, though only loosely defined, they are not the same; examples are [[parody]], [[frame story]], [[constrained writing]], [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]].

==Major forms==
* [[Poetry]] ([[sonnets]], [[haiku]], [[limerick]])
* [[Prose]] ([[notebook]], [[novel]], [[novella]], [[short story]])

'''''Lottovoittaja UKK Turhapuro''''' is a [[Finland|Finnish]] 1976 comedy film written by [[Spede Pasanen]] and directed by [[Ere Kokkonen]]. It is the third film in the [[Uuno Turhapuro]] series. The film's title translates to "Lottery winner UKK Turhapuro", UKK being an apparent reference to former President of Finland [[Urho Kekkonen]].

==Plot==

It is the first anniversary of Uuno ([[Vesa-Matti Loiri]]) and Elisabet ([[Marjatta Raita]]). Uuno has placed a bet with his friend Härski-Hartikainen ([[Spede Pasanen]]) a year ago, that if Uuno can take just one year of marriage with Elisabet, Hartikainen will treat him a festive dinner. However, Hartikainen buys a lottery ticket for Uuno, who agrees to deduct it from his debt &amp;ndash; and the festive dinner is reduced to a can of milk and half a sausage. As it happens, Uuno becomes the lottery winner of 1.5 million [[Finnish mark|marks]], only to soon realize he doesn't own a single penny yet. Mister Tossavainen ([[Seppo Laine]]) arrives and offers to finance Uuno before he actually gets the jackpot. Thus, Uuno gets to live a rich live on credit. He buys a raccoon fur, leopard swimming trunks and a couple of [[Mercedes-Benz]]es. Women begin to fancy Uuno and so does his [[Councillor Tuura|father-in-law]] ([[Tapio Hämäläinen]]). As time goes by it is revealed, though, that Uuno is not actually a lottery winner, and so he has to escape the anger of others to Härski's car repair shop.

==Naming==
The Mombar in Egypt is known in [[Syria]] as qubawat or sausages; and palsin in [[Lebanon]] is known as Fawaregh, also known in [[Libya]] as usban, but in [[Morocco]] [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]] it is known as Merguez (lamb or sheep small intestines stuffed with rice). The filling varies by country but rice remains the main ingredient.

==Variants==
Several varieties of usban exist, and the herbs and spices used can vary but typically include cayenne pepper, black pepper, turmeric and cinnamon, as well as dried mint, parsley and dill. This is added to spring onion, tomato, vegetable oil and rice. The mixture is stuffed into sheep intestines or commercial sausage casings and then tied off with thread at the ends.

A '''monstration''' is a public performance similar to a [[Demonstration (protest)|demonstration]], but intended as creative [[performance art]], often [[parody]]ing a serious demonstration. It is principally a [[Russia]]n phenomenon.&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite news|title= Russian Labor Day: Rallies, ridicule and revelry as tens of thousands take part|url=http://rt.com/politics/labor-day-russia-politics-671/|accessdate=1 May 2013|newspaper=Russia Today|date=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==

=== Poland ===
[[Orange Alternative]] ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Pomarańczowa Alternatywa'') was a Polish [[anti-communist]] underground movement, started in [[Wrocław]], a city in south-west [[Poland]], in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 1992|title=Between the State and Solidarity|journal=The British Journal of Sociology|volume=43|issue=1|pages=55–78|doi=10.2307/591201|author=Bronislaw Misztal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main purpose was to offer a wider group of citizens an alternative way of opposition against the [[authoritarian]] regime by means of peaceful street protests that used absurd and nonsensical elements.

=== Russia ===
In 2004, [[Artyom Loskutov]] and members of the ''Contemporary Art Terrorism'' group in [[Novosibirsk]] joined the annual [[International Workers' Day|May Day demonstration]]. They were carrying posters with deliberately absurd slogans in an attempt to shake up a boring political procession and to make fun. 
Fellow [[Siberian]] artist Ivan Dyrkin named the march "Monstration," a [[Demonstration (acting)|demonstration]] without the prefix ''de,'' which he considered a negative connotation as in [[deconstruction]] or [[Biodegradation|degradation]].&lt;ref name=TheSiberianTimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Liesowska|first=Anna|title= The Siberian phenomenon of 'Monstrating'|url=http://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/the-siberian-phenomenon-of-monstrating/|accessdate=1 May 2013|newspaper=The Siberian Times|date=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern monstration incorporates signs and messages that are deliberately absurd, nonsensical and apolitical that indirectly defy the government and express a conceptual [[paradox]]. Although monstrations are apolitical, participants have been arrested for [[political agitation]]. In 2010, Monstrations took place in 20 cities like [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]], and [[Vladivostok]].&lt;ref name=France24&gt;{{cite news||title= Russian youths invent absurd way to by-pass demonstration banurl=http://observers.france24.com/content/20110517-russian-youths-invent-absurd-way-pass-demonstration-ban|newspaper=France 24|date=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kursk====
The first monstration in [[Kursk]] took place on May 1, 2014.
About 30 people with the main slogan "For the rights of butterflies  in the stomach".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.46tv.ru/new/society/002757/ 46tv.ru, В Курске прошла "Монстрация" (фото)]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In 2015, the main slogan was "We did not watch 50 Shades".

==Recognition==
In 2011 Monstration was recognized for "Innovation" by a government agency of [[modern art]] and selected as "Best in the Region."&lt;ref name=NewsRU&gt;{{cite news|last=Liesowska|first=Anna|title= Русская служба BBC по требованию Роскомнадзора внесла правки в материал о "Марше за федерализацию Сибири"|url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/05aug2014/federalization.html|accessdate=5 August 2014|newspaper=News RU|date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government outrage==
In 2014, Artyom Loskutov attempted to organize a routine monstration for August 17, when he ran into trouble. “We were talking about having a march, which is absolutely allowed under law,” Loskutov says. “But in writing about it, we wrote about creating a [[Siberian Republic]] within the [[Russian Federation]]. There was no talk about [[separatism]] or anything, it’s just that Moscow doesn’t govern the regions very effectively.”&lt;ref name=PRI&gt;{{cite news|last=Maynes|first=Charles|title= As Snowden looks on, Russia cracks down on Internet freedom|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2014-08-05/snowden-looks-russia-cracks-down-internet-freedom|accessdate=5 August 2014|newspaper=PRI|date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The purpose of the protest was to ridicule Kremlin's hypocrisy in the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] and to raise awareness about politics in Siberia. "They decided to tell us how great it is when some republic moves for [[self-determination]]. Okay, well let's apply this to other regions. Can Siberia allow itself this same rhetoric? It turns out it can't."&lt;ref name=TheGuardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Luhn|first=Alec|title= Russia bans Siberia independence march|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/05/russia-bans-siberia-independence-march-extremism-law|accessdate=5 August 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian telecommunications regulator [[Roskomnadzor]] launched a [[media blackout]] of the event, issued warnings to 14 media outlets that ran the story and threatened to close [[BBC Russian Service]] for reporting the announcement.&lt;ref name=TheSiberianTimes&gt;{{cite news|title= Authorities in Novosibirsk ban march to press for changing Siberia's status in Russia|url=http://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/authorities-in-novosibirsk-ban-march-to-press-for-changing-siberias-status-in-russia/|accessdate=5 August 2014|newspaper=The Siberian Times|date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roskomnadzor also launched an official investigation against BBC to confirm "an apparent violation of the law." In response, BBC added a description of the event as a “parody” that in no way promoted Siberia's independence from Moscow.&lt;ref name=Itar-Tass&gt;{{cite news|last=Rain|first=Andy|title= Russia to further examine provocative interview on BBC website|url=http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/743661|accessdate=5 August 2014|newspaper=Itar-Tass|date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian authorities compared the potential monstration protest to [[Euromaidan]] that led to the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]]. [[Nikolai Valuyev]] called it the "first attempt of global efforts to promote separatism in Russia."&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title= Russia: Siberian autonomy web page shut down|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-28643523|accessdate=4 August 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dmitry Zhuravlyov, director of [[Russian Academy of Sciences#Institutions|Institute for Regional Problems]] based in Moscow, "I can understand the position of these people [organizers of the march] on a psychological level," Zhuravlyov said. "They want to have more control over the riches of Siberia, and that is understandable. But what is unacceptable to Russia is that this whole idea goes against the Constitution. You cannot change the status of your region just like that." President [[Vladimir Putin]] recently signed legislation that introduced prison sentences for violations of [[territorial integrity]] in Russia.&lt;ref name=TheMoscowTimes&gt;{{cite news|title= Blocked BBC Interview Highlights Authorities' Insecurities|url= http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/blocked-bbc-interview-highlights-authorities-insecurities/504637.html|accessdate=5 August 2014|newspaper=The Moscow Times|date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Musical Interpretation Research''''' ('''MIR''') is a series of monographs on the performance of [[classical music]] authored by [[Nils-Göran Areskoug]] (Sundin). The focus is on integrating the perspectives of the audience, artist and musicologist alike. The series covers aesthetic experience in music appreciation with the aim of bridging theory and practice of interpretive processes among performer and conductor, by providing in-depth analyses of masterworks, elaborating a methodology for researching interpretative cognition and designing a set of criteria for excellence in music performance. The publications, originating in a project pioneering new music research in the Nordic countries at Uppsala University and Stockholm School of Music, were funded initially by grants from The Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation and Torsten and Ragnar Söderberg Foundations jointly,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torstensoderbergsstiftelse.se/ Torsten Söderbergs Stiftelse]&lt;/ref&gt; during 1979–1988.

The MIR series was first presented in 1983 at University of California San Diego, La Jolla (lecture in the C.A.R.L. series) and on invitation by Professor David Lewin at a visit to the Music Department, Harvard University; then premiered at a lecture-performance event in Stockholm, Sweden, on May 10, 1984, according to the press release issued by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muakad.se/ Kungliga Musikaliska Akademien (KMA)]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent research for the MIR series contains 'real world new music research', including dialogues with leading orchestra conductors (such as Sergiu Celibidache) and instrumentalists (pianists and violinists such as Hans Leygraf, Guido Agosti and Isaac Stern, respectively) along with studies of their rehearsal working processes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/coleur/aremus Are Akademi]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''O Jerusalem''''' is the fifth book in the [[Mary Russell (fictional)|Mary Russell]] series by [[Laurie R. King]].

Set during the voyage of Mary Russell and [[Sherlock Holmes]] to the [[Holy Land]], the action of this novel takes place chronologically during the action of ''[[The Beekeeper's Apprentice]]''. In [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] Mary and Sherlock meet up with Mahmoud and Ali Hazr, two apparently [[Bedouin]] guides, to counter a plot against the British in Jerusalem under General [[Edmund Allenby]].

==Brief character overview==
[[Mary Russell (fictional)|Mary Russell]]: She is nineteen, and currently on a break from studying theology at Oxford University.  During the escapade, she is dressed as a young Bedouin man and must learn the Arabic language on the go.  She keeps throwing knives in her boots and has excellent aim.

[[Sherlock Holmes]]: The aging detective has recently had his back badly hurt in ''[[The Beekeeper's Apprentice]]''.  He visited Palestine previously, and so already has experience with the customs and language, to a certain degree.

Mahmoud Hazr: He works as a traveling scribe, which covers up that he and Ali are British spies.  He has a scar on his face from being previously tortured.  He is taciturn and is described as being as steady as a rock.

Ali Hazr-: He is Mahmoud's younger brother, and dresses very flamboyantly.  He uses a large unwieldy knife for everything, including carving small wooden figures.  He has excellent night vision, and is said to have, “Eyes like a cat.”  He is highly distrustful of Holmes and Russell when they first come.

Joshua: He is a spymaster, whom the Hazrs report to.  He collects reports from a small shack outside of Beersheva.  He was in France fighting in the trenches for six months during World War I and works for the British Empire.

[[Image:Essai-Piefort.jpg|thumb|240px|''Regular coin'' (left), ''pattern coin'' (center) and ''[[piedfort]]'' (right)]]
A '''pattern coin''' is a [[coin]] which has not been approved for release, produced for the purpose of evaluating a proposed coin design.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.uspatterns.com/ |title=uspatterns.com |publisher=Society of U.S. Pattern Collectors |last1=Lustig |first1=Andy |last2=Teichman |first2=Saul}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often off-metal strike, to [[Proof coinage|proof]] standard or [[piedfort]]s. They are collected or studied by many [[Numismatics|coin collectors]] because of their historical importance. A high number of the world's most valuable coins are patterns, and nearly a quarter of the pieces listed in ''100 Greatest US Coins'' are pattern coins. &lt;ref&gt;''100 Greatest US Coins'' – Jeff Garrett; Whitman Publishing; 4th Edition (10/18/2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==English patterns==
{{Main|Coins of the pound sterling}}
The first English coin that can be identified with certainty is a [[Groat (coin)|groat]], originally worth fourpence. This piece, an example of which was illustrated and sold in the Dodsley Cuff sale of the mid-19th century, had crowns in place of the usual three pellets in each quarter of the reverse.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Patterns are particularly identifiable and exist in larger numbers from the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] onwards. The experimental base metal issues of all coinage prior to the mid-18th century have been well preserved.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Boulton's [[Soho Mint|mint in Soho]] produced large quantities of patterns, which were supplemented by Taylor some fifty or so years later from the same [[Die (manufacturing)|dies.]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Early United States patterns==
{{Main|Coins of the United States dollar}}
{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center| align = right| direction = vertical| width = 200| header = 1792 pattern coins|footer=Silver center cent, disme, quarter| image1 = NNC-US-1792-1C-Pattern Silver Center Cent (J-2).jpg | alt1 = | caption1 =  | image2 = NNC-US-1792-10C-Pattern Disme Copper (J-10).jpg| alt2 = | caption2  = | image3 = NNC-US-1792-25C-Pattern Quarter Dollar (J-12).jpg | alt3 = | caption3  = }}
After the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] was signed on July 4, 1776, discussion arose over what sort of [[currency]] should be adopted in the United States.  At the time, people in North America relied upon a mixture of foreign coins, none of which were struck to a consistent standard, making day to day financial transactions difficult. In 1783, Congress resolved to create a mint, tasking [[Superintendent of Finance of the United States|Superintendent of Finance]] [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] with developing a plan for a system of coinage. The first coins struck by the United States – the [[Nova Constellatio]] patterns – were made to illustrate this plan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coinworld.com/news/us-coins/2015/07/nova-constellatio-patterns-among-earliest-us-coins.all.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1792 the [[United States Mint]] opened in [[Philadelphia]]. In that year several more patterns were created, including the [[half dime]], then known as a "half disme". It is believed that {{circa}} 1,500 pieces were struck as patterns, and that these patterns themselves entered circulation during the next decade.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Over the next 40 years, more patterns were created but there is little information currently known about these pieces. Technically, these coins were not patterns but rather off-metal strikes, with the coins struck in a different metal than those destined for general use in circulation. An example is an [[Half Eagle#Draped Bust|1807 Half Eagle]], or five dollar gold piece struck in copper.

==Mid-19th century United States patterns==
[[File:1868 nickel dime pattern.jpg|thumb|right|1868 pattern for a large cent-sized, copper-nickel, ten-cent piece.  From the [[Harry W. Bass, Jr.]] Collection.]]
Starting in 1836, more patterns were created by the United States Mint in Philadelphia. These consisted of several types of patterns:
* Real pattern coins for proposed coinage
* Off-metal strikes
* Transitional pieces
* Fantasy pieces

One example of a pattern coin for proposed coinage is the [[half-union]], a gold pattern coin with a face value of 50 [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] that was minted in 1877 and weighed {{convert|2.5|oz|abbr=out}}. The U.S. Mint deemed the idea of a 2.5-ounce gold coin infeasible, and only two were ever minted.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Transitional pieces are patterns dated before coins with the new design officially went into circulation. These were often produced during final stage of the pattern process, used to present the newly adopted design to the public. One famous example is the 1856 [[Flying Eagle cent]], although that coin has been commonly and incorrectly believed to be regular issue due to its high mintage for collectors.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Fantasy pieces include many struck in the 1860s and 1870s as patterns and sold to numismatists for the sole purpose of raising cash for the mint. This practice ended in the 1880s, when the [[United States Mint|U.S. Mint]] enforced regulations to prevent the sale of pattern coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Guidebook of United States Coins 2016|last=Yeoman|first=R.S.|publisher=Whitman Publishing, LLC|year=2015|isbn=|editor-last=Bressett|editor-first=Kenneth|edition=69|series=The Official Red Book|location=3101 Clairmont Road, Suite G, Atlanta GA 30329|pages=374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern patterns==
The U.S. Mint experiments with new coinage occasionally, such as when silver was removed from coin designs. The Mint began using dies with [[Martha Washington]] for trial strikings, since they would not be confused with real circulating money&lt;ref&gt;[http://uspatterns.com/1965.html Lustig and Teichman, 1965]&lt;/ref&gt; since they do not resemble money. Thus, no restrictions exist on the sale of Martha Washington pieces. Mint-produced modern patterns are very rare, with only a few pieces existing in private collections. The United States mint has placed restrictions on the sale of modern patterns that do resemble coins, such as the [[1974 aluminum cent]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} One of the most expansive collections of American pattern coins is the [[Harry W. Bass, Jr.]] collection housed at the [[American Numismatic Association]] Money Museum in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.harrybassfoundation.org/patmenu.asp |title=HBF Pattern Menu |publisher=Harry W. Bass, Jr. Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries==
Pattern coins of [[France]] and of French-speaking countries such as [[Monaco]] are described by the French term ''[[Essai (coin)|essai]]''. The essai coins of [[New Hebrides]] are of interest to collectors of British Commonwealth coinage, as New Hebrides gained independence in 1980 as the Republic of [[Vanuatu]].

The word ''essai'' is found inscribed on the pattern coins of [[Namibia]] along with the German word ''Probe''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

'''''Permutation City''''' is a 1994 science-fiction novel by [[Greg Egan]] that explores many concepts, including [[quantum ontology]], through various philosophical aspects of [[artificial life]] and [[simulated reality]]. Sections of the story were adapted from Egan's 1992 short story "Dust", which dealt with many of the same philosophical themes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/INTERVIEWS/Interviews.html#Aurealis Aurealis Interview (2009) by Russell Blackford].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Permutation City'' won the [[Campbell award (best novel)|John W. Campbell Award]] for the best science-fiction novel of the year in 1995 and was nominated for the [[Philip K. Dick Award]] the same year. The novel was also cited in a 2003 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article on [[multiverses]] by [[Max Tegmark]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Tegmark]], [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=parallel-universes Parallel Universes], ''[[Scientific American]]'', May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Tegmark]], [http://cosmos.phy.tufts.edu/~zirbel/ast21/sciam/ParalellUniverse.pdf Parallel Universes]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620211331/http://cosmos.phy.tufts.edu/~zirbel/ast21/sciam/ParalellUniverse.pdf |date=20 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes and setting==
''Permutation City'' asks whether there is a difference between a computer [[simulation]] of a person and a "real" person. It focuses on a model of consciousness and reality, the ''Dust Theory'', similar to the [[Mathematical universe hypothesis|Ultimate Ensemble Mathematical Universe hypothesis]] proposed by [[Max Tegmark]]. It uses the assumption that human consciousness is [[Turing-computable]]: that consciousness can be produced by a computer program. The book deals with consequences of human consciousness being amenable to mathematical manipulation, as well as some consequences of simulated realities. In this way, Egan attempts to deconstruct notions of self, memory, and mortality, and of physical reality.

The '''Autoverse''' is an [[artificial life]] simulator based on a [[cellular automaton]] complex enough to represent the substratum of an [[artificial chemistry]]. It is deterministic, internally consistent and vaguely resembles real chemistry. Tiny environments, simulated in the Autoverse and filled with populations of a simple, designed lifeform, ''Autobacterium lamberti'', are maintained by a community of enthusiasts obsessed with getting ''A. lamberti'' to evolve, something the Autoverse chemistry seems to make extremely difficult.

Related explorations go on in [[Virtual reality|virtual realities]] (VR), which make extensive use of patchwork [[heuristic]]s to crudely simulate immersive and convincing physical environments, albeit at a maximal speed of seventeen times slower than "real" time, limited by the [[Optical computer|optical crystal computing]] technology used at the time of the story. Larger VR environments, covering a greater internal volume in greater detail, are cost-prohibitive even though VR worlds are computed selectively for inhabitants, reducing redundancy and extraneous objects and places to the minimal details required to provide a convincing experience to those inhabitants; for example, a mirror not being looked at would be reduced to a reflection value, with details being "filled in" as necessary if its owner were to turn their model-of-a-head towards it.

Within the story, "[[Mind uploading|Copies]]" – digital renderings of human brains with complete subjective consciousness, the technical descendants of ever more comprehensive medical simulations – live within VR environments after a process of "scanning". Copies are the only objects within VR environments that are simulated in full detail, everything else being produced with varying levels of generalisation, [[lossy compression]], and [[Hash function|hashing]] at all times.

Copies form the conceptual spine of the story, and much of the plot deals directly with the "lived" experience of Copies, most of whom are copies of wealthy billionaires suffering terminal illnesses or fatal accidents, who spend their existences in VR worlds of their creating, usually maintained by [[trust fund]]s, which independently own and operate large computing resources for their sakes, separated physically and economically from most of the rest of the world's computing power, which is privatized as a [[Fungibility|fungible]] [[commodity]]. Although the wealthiest copies face no financial difficulties, they can still be threatened because copies lack political and legal rights (they are considered software), especially where the global economy is in [[recession]]. Hence they cannot afford to retreat into solipsism and ignore what is happening in the real world.

At the opposite end from the wealthy Copies are those who can only afford to live in the virtual equivalent of "Slums", being bounced around the globe to the cheapest physical computing available at any given time in order to save money, while running at much slower speeds compared to the wealthy Copies. Their slowdown rate depends on how much computer power their meager assets can afford, as computer power is traded on a global exchange and goes to the highest bidder at any point in time. When they cannot afford to be "run" at all, they can be frozen as a "snapshot" until computer power is relatively affordable again. A Copy whose financial assets can only generate sufficient interest to run at a very slow rate is stuck in a rut because he/she/it becomes unemployable and is unable to generate new income, which may lead to a downward spiral.

By creating this scenario, Egan postulates a world where [[economic inequality]] can persist even in one's (virtual) afterlife.

The concept of [[solipsism]] is also examined prominently, with many less-wealthy Copies attending social functions called Slow Clubs, where socialising Copies agree to [[Synchronization|synchronise]] with the slowest person present. Many of these less-wealthy Copies become completely deracinated from their former lives and from world events, or else become ''Witnesses'', who spend their time observing (at considerable time lapse) world events unfold, at the cost of any meaningful relationships with their fellow Copies. A subculture of lower/middle-class Copies, calling themselves ''Solipsist Nation'' after a philosophical work by their nominal founder, choose to completely repudiate the "real" world and any Copies still attached to it, reprogramming their models-of-brains and their VR environments in order to design themselves into their own personal vision of [[paradise]], of whatever size and detail, disregarding slowdown in the process.

Egan's later novels ''[[Diaspora (novel)|Diaspora]]'' and ''[[Schild's Ladder]]'' deal with related issues from other perspectives.

==Story==
The plot of Permutation City follows the lives of several people in a near future reality where the Earth is ravaged by the effects of climate change, the economy and culture are largely globalised, and civilisation has accumulated vast amounts of [[cloud computing]] power and memory which is distributed internationally and is traded in a [[Stock market|public market]] called the QIPS Exchange (Quadrillion Instructions Per Second, see [[Instructions per second|MIPS]]).

Most importantly, this great computing capacity has enabled the creation of Copies, whole [[Mind uploading|brain emulations]] of "scanned" humans which are detailed enough to allow for subjective conscious experience on the part of the emulation. Scanning has become safe enough and common enough to allow for a few wealthy or dedicated humans to afford to create backups of themselves. Copies do not yet possess human rights under the laws of any nation or international body.

===Part one===
In 2050, Paul Durham, a Sydney man having experimented on Copies of himself, offers wealthy Copies prime real estate in an advanced supercomputer which, according to his pitch, will never be shut down and never experience any slowdown whatsoever. Durham predicts that efforts to utilise [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] effects will clash with Copy rights, as both Copies and weather simulations will demand increasing QIPS Exchange shares. All that each Copy must do is to make the comparatively small investment of two million ecus in order to bring Durham's fantasy computer into existence.

Durham hires Maria Deluca, an Autoverse enthusiast, to design an Autoverse program which, given a powerful enough computer, could generate a planet's worth of evolvable Autoverse life. He also clandestinely commissions a famous virtual reality architect, Malcolm Carter, to build a full scale VR city; outside of Durham's knowledge, Carter secretly hacks two Slum-dwelling Solipsist Nation Copies (Peer and Kate) into this city's [[machine code]]. When Maria learns of a [[computer fraud]] investigation on Durham, she confronts him.

Durham reveals that his self-experiments convinced him that there is no difference, even in principle, between physics and mathematics, and that all mathematically possible structures exist, among them our physics and therefore our spacetime, a belief he refers to as "Dust Theory".  The dust theory implies that all possible universes exist and are equally real, emerging spontaneously from their own mathematical self-consistency. Because Copies exist in virtual realities held together by heuristics merely for the sake of their experience, it should be the case that when a Copy is terminated and deleted, its own conscious experience will continue. Indeed, Durham himself claims to have been through such a process dozens of times.

Durham uses the money from his financial backing to simulate a minute or two of a "[[Garden of Eden (cellular automaton)|Garden of Eden]]" configuration of an infinitely-expanding, massively complex cellular automaton universe, in which each iteration of the expansion serves to "manufacture" an extra layer of blocks of a computing configuration.&lt;ref&gt;This is similar to what is known as a "Spacefiller" configuration in [[Conway's Game of Life]]) based on a fictional, [[Turing-complete]] cellular automaton and referred to as a TVC ("''Turing/Von Neumann/Chiang''"), named after its conceiver and designer.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his Dust Theory, such a simulation would create a self-consistent "TVC universe" to persist in its own terms even after its termination and deletion. His and his investors' Copies [[Closure (computer science)|would therefore persist]] indefinitely in the simulation. The Autoverse planetary seed program designed by Maria is included in the TVC universe package for his investors to explore once life had evolved there after it had been run on a significantly large segment of the TVC universe (referred to as "Planet Lambert").

After a successful launch, simulation, termination, and deletion of the TVC universe, Durham and Maria have uncomfortable sex in awkward celebration, and later that night, while Maria is asleep, Durham disembowels himself with a kitchen knife in his bathtub, believing his role as the springboard for his deleted TVC Copy to discover its true identity to be fulfilled.

===Part two===
Maria wakes in Permutation City seven thousand years of subjective time after the launch, furious at Durham for awakening her. He explains to her that intelligent life has arisen on Planet Lambert in the form of complex swarms of insect-like eusocial beings, evolved from Maria's original ''Autobacterium hydrophilus''. He wishes to use Maria's slice of the universe's processing power (as a founder of the world she was given de facto control of a continuously-growing zone of the processor network as well) to make forbidden first contact with Lambertians. He believes this is necessary because he has lost the ability to pause the Autoverse simulation or slow it down past a constant multiple of the size of the processor network it occupies. Durham is worried that the rules of their simulated universe are breaking down.

They discover that the combined intelligence of Lambertians has exceeded that of Permutation City; as such, the TVC universe is being overwritten into a system existing solely as a byproduct of the self-perpetuation of the Autoverse. Durham, Maria, and some other companions quickly launch an emergency expedition into the Autoverse to attempt to convince the Lambertians of the validity of the creator hypothesis and its methodological perferentiality over their own newly formulated theory. Unfortunately, the Lambertians reject the creator theory, prompting Permutation City and the entirety of TVC processor-networks to begin collapsing into nothing. Durham and Maria inform the inhabitants of Permutation City, who launch a new TVC Garden of Eden in their universe's final moments.  Maria convinces a reluctant Durham to come along to a new universe, pledging to work with her to discover the underlying rules that governed the Autoverse's takeover of Permutation City.

A '''Rocket Festival''' ({{lang-th|ประเพณีบุญบั้งไฟ|translit=Prapheni Bun Bang Fai}}, {{lang-lo|[[wikt:ບຸນບັ້ງໄຟ|ບຸນບັ້ງໄຟ]]|translit= Bun Bang Fai}})  is a [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit-making]] ceremony traditionally practiced by ethnic [[Lao people]] throughout much of [[Isan]] and [[Laos]], in numerous villages and municipalities near the beginning of the [[wet season]].  Celebrations typically include preliminary music and dance performances, competitive processions of floats, dancers and musicians on the second day, and culminating on the third day in competitive firings of home-made rockets.  Local participants and sponsors use the occasion to enhance their [[Society|social prestige]], as is [[Norm (social)|customary]] in [[tradition]]al [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[folk culture|folk]] [[festival]]s throughout [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Kammerer, Cornelia Ann and Tannenbaum|first= Nicola|title= MERIT AND BLESSING: In Mainland Southeast Asian Comparative Perspective.|year= 1996|publisher=  Southeast Asia Studies (Monograph 45).|location= New Haven (Connecticut): Yale University. |isbn= 0-938692-61-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Festival period : April - June (various local area ) The Festival most famous and widely know and have special program and specific local pattern of Bung Fai or Parade dance and Beautiful Bung Fai float in Thailand such as [[Yasothon]] The second weekend of May, [[Suwannaphum District]], [[Roi Et]] The first weekend of June, [[Phanom Phrai District]] [[Roi Et]] Full moon of seventh month in Lunar year's calendar in each year.
Not only found Bung Fai festival found in Isan or Northeasthern of Thailand and North of [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]] only,also has found some people who moved to [[Amphoe Sukhirin]] [[Narathiwat]] has Bung Fai festival there too.

==History==
These [[Buddhist festival]]s are presumed to have evolved from pre-[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[fertility rite]]s held to celebrate and encourage the coming of the rains, from before the 9th century invention of [[Black powder#History|black powder]]. This festival displays some earthy elements of Lao folklore. Coming immediately prior to the planting season, the festivals offer an excellent chance to make merry before the hard work begins, as well as enhancing communal prestige, and attracting and redistributing wealth as in any [[gift culture]].

Scholars study the centuries-old rocket festival tradition today as it may be significant to the history of [[rocket]]ry in the East,&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank H. Winter]], curator of the Rocketry Division of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C., "The 'Bun Bang Fai' Rockets of Thailand and Laos: Possible Key to determining the Spread of Rocketry in the Orient", in Lloyd H. Cornett, Jr., ed., History of Rocketry and Astronautics - Proceedings of the Twentieth and Twenty-First History Symposia of the International Academy of Astronautics, AAS History Series, Vol. 15 (Univelt Inc: San Diego, 1993), pp. 3-24.&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps also significant in the [[Colonialism#Post-colonialism|postcolonial]] socio-political development of the Southeast Asian nation states. [[Economic anthropology|Economically]], villages and sponsors bear the costs in many locations in [[Laos]] and in northern [[Isan]] (northeast [[Thailand]]). The festivals typically begin at the beginning of the [[rainy season]], in the sixth or seventh [[Thai lunar calendar|lunar month]]s.

Anthropology Professor Charles F. Keyes advises, "In recognition of the deep-seated meaning of certain traditions for the peoples of the societies of mainland Southeast Asia, the rulers of these societies have incorporated some indigenous symbols into the national cultures that they have worked to construct in the [[Colonialism#Post-colonialism|postcolonial]] period.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last= Keyes |first= Charles F. |title= The golden peninsula : culture and adaptation in mainland Southeast Asia. Includes bibliographical references and index. |year= 1995 |publisher= (SHAPS library of Asian studies) University of Hawai'i Press
|location= Honolulu |isbn= 0-8248-1696-X}}, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;  Giving the "Bun Bang Fai or fire rocket festival of Laos" as one example, he adds that it remains "…far more elaborate in the villages than in the cities…."

==Present day==
Villages no longer stage "Bun Bang Fai" festivals on the scale of [[Yasothon]]'s famous event.  However, villages may have [[Float (parade)|floats]] conveying government messages. They may also include [[fair]]s. In recent years the Tourism Authority of Thailand has helped promote these events, particularly the festivals in the Thai provinces of [[Nong Khai]] and [[Yasothon]], the latter boasting the largest and most elaborate of these festivals.The [[Bun bang fai]] celebration in the past and up till now are not only in Yasothorn Province, but also in many other provinces around that city such as [[Roi Et]], [[Kalasin]], [[Sisaket Province|Srisaket]], and [[Mahasarakham]]. In [[Amphoe Suwannaphum|Suwannaphum]] of [[Roi Et Province]] is one the most magnificent and beautiful of Thailand's Bang Fai parades that is called "Bang fai eh" or "Bangfai ko" (Bang Fai Parade are decorated in the form of Thai traditional artwork or Line Thai).

==Yasothon's festival==
Since the March 1, 1972, separation of [[Yasothon Province|Yasothon]] from [[Ubon Ratchathani Province]], with its world-famous [[Ubon Ratchathani Candle Festival|Candle Festival]], [[Yasothon|Yasothon's provincial capital]] has elaborately staged its now one of three famous Rocket Festival in Thailand ( [[Yasothon Province|Yasothon]], [[Suwannaphum District|Suwannaphume]], and [[Phanom Phrai District|Phanom Prai]] both are locate in [[Roi Et Province|Roi Et province]] ) annually over the Friday, Saturday, and Sunday weekend that falls in the middle of May.

[[Image:Village Mor Lum Sing.6.jpg|left|thumb|Village Mor Lam Sing]]'''Raw Friday''' ({{lang-th|'''วันศุกร์ดิบ'''}}, Wan Sook Dip) features all-night performances of '''[[Mor lam|Mor Lam Sing]]''' ([[Thai language|Thai]]–[[Isan language|Isan]]: '''หมอลำซิ่ง'''),  which continue intermittently into the early hours of Monday. Mor Lam Sing is a type of ''morlam'' that is very popular among the local Isan-Lao population. The performance goes on all night and the locals have great fun. Outsiders have a hard time understanding the humour, which is often rather bawdy.

'''Saturday''' brings on the competitions for '''Hae Bangfai Ko ''' ({{lang-th|แห่บั้งไฟโก้}}). 
'''''"Hàe"'''''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928191507/http://www.thai2english.com/dictionary/22631.html] are street parades or demonstrations usually featuring traditional dance and accompanying [[Music of Thailand|musicians]], typically with [[khene|khaen]] ({{lang-th|แคน}}), [[Gong]]s, [[Goblet drum|Lao-Isan Klong Yao]] ({{lang-th|กลองยาว}}), ''long drum''), and an [[electric guitar]], powered by an [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] and [[Car battery|car batteries]] in a [[Cart|handcart]] that also mounts [[horn loudspeaker]]s.
'''Bangfai Ko ''' are richly decorated rockets mounted on traditional but highly decorated oxcarts, or modern [[Float (parade)|floats]].  Most but not all bold ''Bangfai Ko '' are for show and not actually capable of flight. Many sport the heads of [[Nāga]]s; if equipped with water pumps and swivels, they ''are'' actually capable of spitting on spectators.

The principal theme of any ''Hae Bangfai'' is the [[Phadaeng and Nang Ai]] legend (below), so many floats (or highly decorated oxcarts) also depict the couple and their retinue. Other modern themes present as well, as suggested by Keyes (ibid.) Participating groups compete for prizes within their categories. ''Hàe'' typically end in a [[wat]], where dancers and accompanying musicians may further compete in traditional [[Dance of Thailand#Fawn Thai|folk dance]]. All groups prominently display the names of their major sponsors.

[[File:2013 Yasothon Rocket Festival 04.jpg|left|thumb|A lady drags a turtle with a phallic head behind her on the day of the parade.]]

Recalling the fertility rite origins of the festival, parade ornaments and floats often sport [[phallic]] symbols and imagery.
[[Image:Rocket Festival Cameraman Shoots.jpg|right|thumb|Shoots: note phallus protruding from "camera"]] Amid the festive atmosphere, [[Joke#Dirty jokes|dirty humour]] is widespread.

Festivities also include [[cross-dressing]], both cross-sex and [[Demographics#Generational cohorts|cross-generational]], and great quantities of [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. Perhaps the most popular beverage, both because it is cheaper than [[beer]] and has a higher, 40-percent alcohol content, is a [[neutral grain spirit]] called '''Sura''' ({{lang-th|สุรา}}), but more generally known as ''Lao Whiskey'' ({{lang-th|เหล้าลาว}}, ''Lao lao'') in Laos and ''Lao Khao'' ({{lang-th|เหล้าขาว}}, ''white alcohol'') in Thailand. [[Sato (rice wine)|Sato]] ({{lang-th|สาโท}}), a brewed rice beverage similar to Japanese sake, may also be on offer; sweet-flavored ''sato'' may be as little as seven-percent alcohol, but it packs a surprising punch.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

'''Sunday''' competition moves on to the launching of Bangfai, judged, in various categories, for apparent height and distance travelled, with extra points for exceptionally beautiful vapour trails Those whose rockets misfire are either covered with [[mud]], or thrown into a mud puddle (that also serves a safety function, as immediate application of cooling mud can reduce severity of [[Burn (injury)|burns]]).  While popular and entertaining, the festival is also dangerous, with participants and spectators alike occasionally being injured or even killed.

==''Bang Fai'' (the rockets)==
[[Image:BoonBungFai-Rockets-084.JPG|right|thumb|Rocket on ascent.]]
&lt;!--[[Image:Yasothonrocketplatforms.JPG|left|thumb|Two rockets being prepared for launch.]]--&gt;

''Jaruat'' ({{lang-th|จรวด}}) is the proper term for [[rocket]]s used as missiles or weapons, but '''Bang Fai''' ({{lang-th|บั้งไฟ}}) [[skyrocket]]s are gigantic [[Black powder|black-powder]] bottle rockets. Tiny [[bottle rocket]]s are so-called because they may be launched from a bottle. In the case of the similar appearing ''Bang Fai'', also spelled 'Bong Fai' ({{lang-th|บ้องไฟ}}), the 'bottle' is a ''bong'' ({{lang-th|บ้อง}}), a section of [[bamboo]] [[Culm (botany)|Culm]] used as a container or pipe (and only colloquially as a [[bong|pipe for smoking marijuana]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Sethaputra|first= So|title= New Model Thai-English Dictionary
|year= 1965|publisher= So Sethaputra Press|location= Bangkok, Thailand|isbn= 974-93509-8-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bangfai Noi showing bong interior.jpg|left|thumb|Bangfai Meun showing wooden nozzle]]Related to the Chinese [[Fire Arrow]], Bang Fai are made from bamboo bongs. Most contemporary ones, however, are enclosed in [[Polyvinyl chloride|pvc]] [[Pipe (material)|piping]], making them less dangerous by standardizing their sizes and black-powder charges (which contest rules require be compounded by the rocketeers, themselves). Baking or boiling a bong kills insect eggs that otherwise hatch in dead bamboo and eat it, inside out. Skipping this step may cause the bong to disintegrate and melt the PVC piping. [[Vine]]s tie long bamboo tails to launching racks. The time it takes for the exhaust to burn through the vines (usually) allows a motor to build up to full thrust; then the tails impart in-flight stability. Ignition comes from a burning [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] or [[electric match]].

Bang Fai come in various sizes, competing in several categories. Small ones are called Bang Fai '''Noi''' ({{lang-th|น้อย}}). Larger categories are designated by the counting words for 10,000, 100,000 and 1,000,000:  ''Meun'' ({{lang-th|หมื่น}}) "Saen" ({{lang-th|แสน}}) and the largest Bang Fai, the ''Lan'' ({{lang-th|ล้าน}}). These counting words see use in many contexts to indicate increasing size or value. ''Lan'' in this context may be taken to mean ''extremely large'' as well as extremely expensive and extremely dangerous:  ''Bang Fai Lan'' are nine metres long and charged with 120&amp;nbsp;kg of [[black powder]]. These may reach altitudes reckoned in kilometres, and travel dozens of kilometres down range (loosely speaking, as they can go in any direction, including right through the crowd). Competing rockets are scored for apparent height, distance, and beauty of the vapour trail ({{lang-th|ไอ}}). A few include skyrocket pyrotechnics. A few also include parachutes for tail assemblies, but most fall where they may.

==Nang Ai, Phadaeng, and Phangkhi==
{{main|Phadaeng Nang Ai}}
[[Image:Pha-Dang Nang-Ai.jpg|left|thumb| Phadaeng and Nang Ai]]

'''Nang Ai''' ({{lang-th|'''นางไอ่'''}}), in full,  '''Nang Ai Kham''' ({{lang|th|'''นางไอ่คำ'''}}) is queen of the [[Medieval pageant|pageant]] and '''Phadaeng''' ({{lang|th|'''ผาแดง'''}}) is her [[champion]].  She is famed as the most beautiful girl. He, an outsider, comes to see for himself, lavishes her with gifts and wins her heart; but must win a rocket festival [[tournament]] to win her hand. Unwittingly, he becomes part of a love triangle.
[[Image:Rocket Festival Phangkhi.jpg|right|thumb|Phangkhi]]'''Phangkhi''' ({{lang|th|'''ภังคี'''}}) and Nang Ai have been fated by their [[Karma]] ({{lang|th|กรรม }} {{lang|th-Latn|kam}}) to have been reborn throughout many past existences as soul mates ({{lang|th|คู่สร้าง }} {{lang|th-Latn|khusang}}, Lao-Isan {{lang|th|สายแน่นนำเกี่ยว }} {{lang|th-Latn|sai naen nam kiaw}}.) Stories about the couple, however, say they have not exactly been lovers: in many a past existence, she has been a dutiful wife, but would not yield an inch in an argument to anyone ({{lang|th|ไม่ยอมใคร }} {{lang|th-Latn|mai yom krai}}) and he only wanted to satisfy himself ({{lang|th|เอาแต่ใจคัวเอง }} {{lang|th-Latn|ow dtae jai dtua eng}}). She becomes fed up and prays never to be paired with him, ever again. Nang Ai is reborn as the daughter of ''Phraya Khom'' ({{lang|th|พระยาขอม}}, (which means Lord [[Cambodia|Khmer]]; but even if her father was a [[Khmer people|Cambodian]] overlord, ''Nang Ai Kham'' is still the genuine article), while Phangki is reborn as the son of Phaya Nak, the [[Nāga#In Buddhism|Grand Nāga]] who rules the [[Ocean depths|Deeps]]. (He is depicted in parades in the guise of a prince, riding alone, dogging the new pair.) Phangki isn't invited to the tournament, and Phadaeng's rocket fizzles. Nang Ai's uncle is the winner, so her father calls the whole thing off, which is considered to be a very bad [[omen]], indeed. Pangkhii [[shapeshifting|shape-shifts]] into a [[White squirrel#Albino and white squirrels|white squirrel]] to spy on Nang Ai, but she espies him and has him killed by a royal hunter. Pangkhii's flesh magically transforms into meat equal to 8,000 [[cart]]loads. Nang Ai and many of her countrymen ate of this tainted flesh, and Phaya Nak vows to allow no one to remain living who had eaten of the flesh of his son. Aroused from the Deeps, he and his watery [[Myrmidons#Later use of the term|myrmidons]] rise and turn the land into a vast swamp. Nagas personify waters running both above and below ground, and nagas run amok are rivers in spate&lt;!-- NOT "in spite"--"in spate" means a sudden flooding due to heavy rains or melting snow --&gt;: all Isan is flooded. 
[[Image:BakSam-Yasothon2008.jpg|150px|left||thumb|Bak Sam]] 
Phadaeng flees the rising flood with Nang Ai on his white [[stallion]], ''Bak Sam'' ({{lang|th|บักสาม Mr. Three}}), but she is swept off by a Naga's tail, not to be seen again. (Bak Sam is seen in parades sporting his stallion's equipage ({{lang|th|อวัยวะเพศของม้า }} {{lang|th-Latn|awaiyawa pet kong ma}}) that legend says dug a [[Lick (stream)|lick]] called ''Lam Huay Sam'' ({{lang|th|ลำห้วยสาม}}, which may be seen to this day in Ban Sammo-Nonthan, Tambon Pho Chai, [[Amphoe Khok Pho Chai]]. The legend also tells that receding waters left behind the [[Nong Han Kumphawapi Lake]] of the [[Amphoe Kumphawapi|Kumphawapi District]] [[Wetland|marsh]], which, too, may be seen to this very day.) Phadaeng escapes, but pines away for his lost love. His ghost then raises an army of the spirits of the air to wage war on the nagas below. The war continues until both sides are exhausted, and the dispute is submitted to King [[Vaiśravaṇa|Wetsawan]] ({{lang|th|ท้าวเวสสุวรรณ}}), king of the North, for [[arbitration]]. His decision: the cause of the [[feud]] has long since been forgotten and all disputants must let bygones be bygone.

The legend is retold in many regional variations, all of which are equally true for they relate events in different existences. One 3000-word poem translated to English&lt;ref&gt;

==The Myth of the Toad King==
[[Image:Bangfai1.JPG|left|thumb|Phaya Thaen Park Rocket Shoot]] Almost everyone, native and visitor alike, will say Bang Fai are launched to bring rain, as in the Tourism Authority of Thailand link, below. However, a careful reading of the underlying myth, as presented in Yasothon and Nong Khai, implies the opposite: the rains bring on the rockets. Their version of the myth:

When the Lord Buddha was in his '''[[Bodhisattva|bodhisatta]]''' ([[Pali]]) ([[Thai language|Thai]]: โพธิสัตว์, ''phothisat'') incarnation as '''King of the Toads Phaya Khang Khok''' ({{lang-th|พญาคางคก}}), and married to '''Udon Khuruthawip''' ({{lang-th|อุดรคู่รู้ทวิป}},  Northern Partner-Knowing-Continent), his sermons drew everyone, creatures and sky-dwellers alike, away from '''Phaya Thaen''' ({{lang-th|พญาแถน}}), King of the Sky)[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928191643/http://www.thai2english.com/dictionary/6347.html]. Angry Phaya Thaen withheld life-giving rains from the earth for seven years, seven months and seven days. Acting against the advice of the Toad King, '''[[Phaya Naga]]''' ({{lang-th|พญานาค|translit=Phayanak}}), King of the [[Nāga]] (and personification of the [[Mekong]]) declared war on Phaya Thaen—and lost.

[[Image:Bangfai4.JPG|left|thumb|King Toad leading war with Phaya Thaen]]Persuaded by Phaya Naga to assume command, King Toad enlisted the aid of [[termite]]s to build mounds reaching to the heavens, and of venomous [[scorpion]]s and [[centipedes]] to attack Phaya Thaen's feet, and of [[hornets]] for air support. Previous attempts at [[aerial warfare]] against Phaya Thaen in his own element had proved futile; but even the Sky must come down to the ground. On the ground the war was won, and Phaya Thaen sued for peace.

Naga Rockets fired in the air at the end of the hot, [[dry season]] are not to threaten Phaya Thaen, but to serve as a reminder to him of his treaty obligations made to Lord Bodhisatta Phaya Khang Khok, King of the Toads, down on the ground. For his part Phaya Nak was rewarded by being given the duty of [[Color Guard|Honor Guard]] at most Thai and Lao temples.[[Image:Laonaga.jpg|right|thumb|Naga guarding the Viang Chan, Laos, Temple of [[Wat Sisaket]], itself a survivor of an [[Laotian Rebellion|intemperate war]] in 1827]]

[[Image:Wow with bowstring.jpg|left|thumb|''Wow tanoo'' ready to fly]]After the [[harvest]] of the resulting [[crops]], '''Wow thanoo''' ({{lang-th|ว่าวธนู}}, bow kite), man-sized kites with a strung bow, are staked out in [[Monsoon#Northeast monsoon|winter monsoon winds]]. They are also called '''Túi-tiù''' ({{lang-th|ตุ๋ยตุ่ย}}, singing kite), from the sound of the bowstring singing in the wind, which sing all through the night, to signal Phaya Thaen that he has sent enough rain.

All participants (including a wow thanoo) were depicted on murals on the front of the former Yasothon Municipal Bang Fai Museum, but were removed when it was remodelled as a learning centre.

An English-language translation of a Thai report on ''Bang Fai Phaya Nark [[Naga fireballs]]'' at [[Nong Khai]] gives essentially the same myth (without the hornets and wow) from Thai folk: The knowledge of Thai life-style [http://www.thaifolk.com/doc/literate/payanak/payanak_e.htm].

The [[2006 in film|2006]] [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai]] [[martial arts film]], ''[[Dynamite Warrior|Kon Fai Bin]]'', depicts the Rocket Festival.

In the mid-2000s, Washington-area media began reporting&lt;ref name="FCP story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hume|first=Mike|title=DC Interns Are Hot and Everyone Wants a Piece of Them|url=http://fcnp.com/623/interns.htm|newspaper=[[Falls Church News-Press]]|location=[[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church, VA]]|date=August 10–16, 2006|archivedate=June 14, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614114732/http://www.fcnp.com/623/interns.htm|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Times article"&gt;{{cite news|title=Showing off a bit of skin|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2006/jul/5/20060705-020537-1374r/?page=all|work=[[Washington Times]]|date=July 5, 2006|accessdate=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the congressional staffers who manage the intern programs in the [[United States House of Representatives]] complained that while most of the young women showed up for work in the same [[Western dress codes#Usage in the workplace|conservative professional attire]] that the staffers and members did, some chose more revealing clothing. Chad Pegram, a coordinator of [[Miami University]]'s intern program, recalls that when he took a group to lunch with one member of the state's congressional delegation, one young woman stood out by wearing "a skirt that was way too short" and [[flip-flops]]. "It reflected badly on her because everyone else looked great," he recalled. "She embarrassed herself."&lt;ref name="Hill 2005 cite" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC News story" /&gt;

Other staffers, many of whom themselves began their careers as interns, reported later that they had seen young women come in for internships wearing "gold [[stiletto heels]], [[thigh-high boots]] [and] [[crop top|belly shirts]]" in addition to short skirts. Most male staffers did not mind, but female staffers, even those just a few years older, were often resentful and offended. The scandal in which [[White House]] intern [[Monica Lewinsky]]'s sexual affair with President [[Bill Clinton]] had led to [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|his impeachment]] was fresh in [[institutional memory]], and some staffers and journalists wondered if the skimpily dressed young female interns were trying to emulate her.&lt;ref name="Hill 2005 cite" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC News story" /&gt; In 2004, [[Jessica Cutler]], a staffer for Ohio Senator [[Mike DeWine]], wrote for a while a blog in which she detailed an active sex life with a variety of men she met through her work, which did little to dispel that idea.&lt;ref name="FCP story" /&gt;

In June 2005, as another group of summer interns began their weeks on [[Capitol Hill]], Betsy Rothstein wrote an article about the phenomenon for ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]''. "We were talking about this at dinner the other night, about how some interns show up in some of the skimpiest clothing," she quoted an unnamed female [[press secretary]] as recalling. "One of the boys called them skinterns, which I thought was hilarious."&lt;ref name="Hill 2005 cite" /&gt;

Another term came from an unidentified "female [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] aide," who claimed she kept and shared a list of "daily offenses" such as young women wearing metallic shoes and handbags as well as [[sleeveless shirt#A-shirt|wifebeaters]]. "If you are going to wear stilettos or heels, no complaining about how they hurt. Interns need to learn to walk in them." She continued "My favorite term is the Saturday-night intern, one who always dresses like it is a Saturday night. They are all over."&lt;ref name="Hill 2005 cite" /&gt;

When the ''[[Washington Times]]'' covered the phenomenon a year later, it used the shorter term. "They'’re known as 'skinterns,'" the paper wrote. "Those who think 'belly shirts' are career wear. If [[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|the devil wears Prada]], the skinterns wear [[wikt:nada|nada]]. As if Washington wasn't sweltering enough." It reported that the popular political blog [[Wonkette]] had started a "Hill Intern Hotties Contest" for both male and female interns. The article implied that the phenomenon was no longer restricted to just congressional offices but had migrated, like many former members of Congress, to lobbying firms on [[K Street (Washington, D.C.)|K Street]], where the same standards of dress often obtain.&lt;ref name="Washington Times article" /&gt;

Four years later, in 2010, ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' reported that private employers in [[Metropolitan Baltimore|its coverage area]] were dealing with skinterns. "Booty shorts. Thigh-grazing dresses. Flip-flops. Ripped jeans. [[Cleavage (breasts)|Cleavage]]-baring tops. See-through skirts. Forgotten bras. Employers have seen it all—and wish they hadn't." Missy Martin, vice president of [[human resources]] at [[Cal Ripken, Jr.#Business ventures|Ripken Baseball]], told the ''Sun'' that interns were "showing up to work in bar clothes. Short skirts, tank tops and cleavage showing. It's like, 'Kids, do you realize you're not supposed to be dressed like you're going out to drink in [[Canton, Baltimore|Canton]]?'"&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun story" /&gt;

By the middle of the next decade, the skintern phenomenon was no longer limited to Capitol Hill. Articles advising interns on how to dress appeared on popular websites in June, when most internships start. " ... [B]efore long, the annual summer parade of skinterns will begin," wrote Katherine Goldstein, editor of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''s website, dropping the [[scare quote]]s in a 2013 ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]'' piece advising young women on how to dress in offices. At her former employer, she recalled, "[e]very June there would be a new batch, just as clueless about appropriate office attire as those from the year before. Think dresses so clingy they leave nothing to the imagination, tops worn without a bra and tied together with string, [[Shorts#styles|daisy dukes]], sheer [[harem pants]], and cleavage straight out of a men's magazine."&lt;ref name=Slate /&gt; The following year the ''[[Kansas City Star]]'' ran a similar piece.&lt;ref name="KC star piece" /&gt;

A 2012 blog post by GlobaLinks Abroad suggested the phenomenon had spread overseas as well. For the organization, Monika Lutz advised young women headed for internships abroad to eschew "[[spaghetti strap]]s, cleavage, short skirts, backless outfits or any combination of the above" if they did not want to be remembered as skinterns. "But men are not excluded from the fashion police's searchlight," she added. "They can be seen sporting [[hoodie]]s, flip flops, super baggy [[cargo pants]], or some fresh-off-the-court sneakers, just to cite the most common occurrences."&lt;ref name="ISA blog post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lutz|first=Monika|title=Avoiding the Skin-tern, and other Professional Fashion Crimes|url=http://gointernabroad-blog.com/2012/06/22/from-the-interns-desk-avoiding-the-skin-tern-and-other-professional-fashion-crimes/|publisher=GlobaLinksAbroad|date=June 22, 2012|accessdate=June 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in a 2013 piece giving dressing advice to interns in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'', [[fashion journalism|fashion journalist]] Lauren Rothman, while generally focused on issues specific to women, reminds those heading for [[Silicon Valley]] to "leave the hoodies and sweats to those who have already made their millions."&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothman|first=Lauren|title=Fashion Whip: 10 Ways to Avoid Becoming a Summer Skintern at Work!|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lauren-a-rothman/fashion-whip-10-ways-to-a_b_3529585.html|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=September 1, 2013|accessdate=June 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Swarovski Crystal Flip Flop.jpg|thumb|left|By 2014, flip-flops had mostly become accepted summer footwear in Washington offices.|alt=The front half of a foot, seen from above, in a pink open-topped shoe with a jewel-encrusted strap behind the toes. The toes have metallic blue nail polish on them]]
On some issues, sartorial choices of skinterns became accepted for all Hill staffers. In 2014, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that flip-flops had become so common in congressional office buildings during summers as to cause a noise problem for some present when the women wearing them reported for work in the morning. "It sounds like the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]," complained Abra Belke, a former staffer and lobbyist who by then was writing Capitol Hill Style, a fashion blog. "Interns and junior staffers are just clomping down the hall in their $5 [[Old Navy]] flip-flops."&lt;ref name="Washington Post 2014 story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Yeager|first=Holly|title=It's summer in Washington. Don't put your best flip-flop forward.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/its-summer-in-washington-dont-put-your-best-flip-flop-forward/2014/05/25/afd357e0-e1fa-11e3-9743-bb9b59cde7b9_story.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=May 25, 2014|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

Some observers think at that least some of the young women whose choices of clothing get them labeled as skinterns are doing so deliberately, in order to stand out from more conservatively dressed colleagues. "Maybe if you can get noticed, you might get a full-time position," [[Wonkette]] editor [[Alex Pareene]] told [[ABC News]] in 2006. Nicole Williams, who coaches women entering the workforce, agrees that in some cases the skintern look is exactly what the wearer intends. "You've got the summer to prove 'I can work here' or 'I can't work here,' so to get noticed, why not?" one intern told ''[[Good Morning America]]''.&lt;ref name="ABC News story" /&gt;

It has also been suggested that most misattired interns, male or female, are not familiar with [[Informal attire#Usage in the workplace|professional dress standards]], especially in an era of more relaxed standards such as those embodied by [[business casual]].&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun story" /&gt; One intern who said she was from [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] told the ''[[Washington Times]]'' in 2006 that her friends at home were stunned to hear that she was not allowed to wear [[jeans]] at her internship in the capital.&lt;ref name="Washington Times article" /&gt;

They may also misunderstand what is meant by vague instructions on how to dress. Carol Vellucci, director of the Career Center at the [[University of Baltimore]], told ''The Baltimore Sun'' that many students seem to her to think that "dressing up" means wearing outfits they would typically wear to a [[nightclub]] or bar. "It seems to be something that especially younger students aren't quite getting," she said.&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun story" /&gt;

Interns may also not have the kind of established wardrobe one would expect from an older adult. "These are young men and women, and they can’t be expected to be decked out in [[Brooks Brothers]]," [[Anthony Weiner]], then a congressman from New York, told ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' in its 2005 story. When he himself had interned for [[Charles Schumer]] in the House during the 1970s, he recalled that he owned one suit at the time, wearing it to the office every day but with a different shirt and tie.&lt;ref name="Hill 2005 cite" /&gt;

==Responses==

When the first started appearing in Congress, many staffers were cautious about counseling the skinterns in their midst on proper dress. "You have to be respectful because chances are they are a donor's kid or a friend of the lawmaker," one male staffer told Rothstein about dealing with interns in general Instead, they often used indirect means, such as [[Social exclusion|marginalization]]. "We had a [recent] intern who we just called Belly. She walked around with a belly shirt on one time too many, and she did get into trouble. Nobody gave her work to do," recalled the press secretary who had shared the coinage of the term with Rothstein. In 2011, ''[[Washington Post]]'' reporter Jenna Johnson shared some anecdotes about the "less-than-subtle" tactics some offices had used, such as one office where the offending intern was asked not to be in the intern class's group photo for the member's website.&lt;ref name="Washington Post 2011 blog post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Jenna|title=#THATintern: The 'What dress code?' intern|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/campus-overload/post/thatintern-the-what-dress-code-intern/2011/06/28/AGmOG7oH_blog.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 28, 2011|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes more direct pressure has been used. In another incident, a young woman in overly transparent [[Capri pants|capris]] was made to stay seated at a desk until the congressman's wife had left the office for the day.&lt;ref name="Hill 2005 cite" /&gt; Johnson wrote of an intern being given a tie and told to put it on. In another case the other interns staged an "[[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]]" during the local bar's [[happy hour]] after the workday.&lt;ref name="Washington Post 2011 blog post" /&gt;

In the wake of media attention to the phenomenon, many members of Congress began instituting stricter [[dress code]]s for staffers and interns. "They should dress professional, and we demand that," a spokesman for [[Florida]] Rep. [[Lincoln Diaz-Balart]] told Rothstein. "They shouldn't dress like they're working a corner. You shouldn't be dressing like [[Paris Hilton]]."&lt;ref name="Hill 2005 cite" /&gt; A year later, Rothstein told the ''[[Washington Times]]'' the stricter attention to interns' dress was having the desired effect. "I really think the interns are getting smarter because of these programs," she said. "They're coming from college. They don't have the thought process. They're learning they can't dress like that."&lt;ref name="Washington Times article" /&gt;

Colleges have also been trying to prepare interns ahead of time. At the University of Baltimore, Vellucci teaches a cource on "Personal and Professional Skills for Business" which is a requisite for business [[major (academic)|majors]], ''The Baltimore Sun'' reported. Outside the city, [[Towson University]]'s business school stages a "Dress Smart" program in which students themselves model attire of varying degrees of propriety.&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun story" /&gt;

In 2014, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that [[KPMG]] staged a [[fashion show]] for its interns at the beginning of every summer. At a hotel in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], the accounting firm's [[recruitment|recruiters]] modeled acceptable outfits from stores such as [[Gap Inc.|The Gap]], complemented by slide presentations on acceptable and unacceptable attire in the office. The 1,200 interns in attendance also received $200 [[gift card]]s to [[Men's Wearhouse]] and (for women) [[Banana Republic]], as well as a free silk tie and piece of jewelry respectively. The company's recruiting director admitted that the show and gifts were prompted by some past interns dressing "not in a way that we would have preferred".&lt;ref name="WSJ KPMG fashion show"&gt;{{cite news|last=Korn|first=Melissa|title=Where Interns Learn How to Dress|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2014/06/18/what-interns-should-wear-to-work/|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=June 18, 2014|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
"I wince every time I hear the term 'skintern'", a pseudonymous female intern complained in a 2010 post on the [[Feministing]] blog. Why, she asked, were male interns who dressed inappropriately merely labeled "sloppy", while young women who did were sexualized? "'Slutty' has a very different and much more harmful repercussion for an intern's career than 'sloppy,'" she noted. "As a result, I am sometimes paralyzed in the mornings, worried that that my sweater seat is too tight or my button down is too low cut. I know that just by being a young female intern, I could be considered a 'skintern' regardless of my dress; and, my male co-workers will never worry about being reduced to a 'skintern.'"&lt;ref name="Feministing post" /&gt;

She also felt that it needlessly divided women who should be working together:
{{quote|Furthermore, labeling someone a "skintern" or "that girl" pits aspiring young professional women against each other. Instead of focusing on how to improve our skills and abilities, we focus on how "trashy" she looks and how much "better" we look. In order for us to not be "that girl," some other "skintern" must be there. As [[Gloria Steinem]] famously said, "all women are [[Playboy Bunny|Bunnies]]," every young woman on the Hill is a "skintern."&lt;ref name="Feministing post" /&gt;}}

Fashion website [[Defy Media#Brands|The Gloss]] defended the skintern style in response to Goldstein's 2013 ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]'' piece. "Surely, I am not the only person who thinks that a 'skintern' sounds like a member of a really cool club," wrote Jennifer Wright. "Skinterns fear nothing. They are truly alive. The air rushes upon their skin whenever someone walks by their [[cubicle]], but they're not chilly, they're fine ... Who would not want to be a skintern!?"&lt;ref name="The Gloss post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Jennifer|title=How To Dress Like A "Skintern"|url=http://www.thegloss.com/2013/05/15/fashion/how-to-dress-like-a-skintern/|publisher=[[Defy Media#Brands|The Gloss]]|date=May 15, 2013|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another response to Goldstein's piece took the opposite view. Elissa Strauss asked if Goldstein's sartorial advice was [[sexism|sexist]] in a post for "The Sisterhood", ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'''s blog on women's issues. At first, she granted, it might seem so: "this is set of codes and rules that only apply to young women, or more specifically, their bodies. It told them that some parts of their bodies are considered vulgar and that wearing a pair of high [[platform heels]] might give others the wrong idea about their, well, purity. It is putting the responsibility on them to cover up, instead of on men to stop [[gawking]]."&lt;ref name="Forward blog post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Strauss|first=Elissa|title=Is Fashion Advice for Female Interns Sexist?|url=http://forward.com/sisterhood/176867/is-fashion-advice-for-female-interns-sexist/|publisher=''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]''|date=May 18, 2013|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I see the logic here," Strauss admitted, recalling how self-conscious she had felt during [[puberty]] as her body started to change, a feeling she did not see shared by any of the young men she knew. "But with all this said, I think there is still a conversation to be had with young women on how to dress, especially in a time when fashion seems almost uniformly inspired by [[Julia Roberts]] in ''[[Pretty Woman (film)|Pretty Woman]]''. "I choose-my-choice" feminism sometimes leads women to empowerment, and other times leads them to choose "choices" from a [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] or, worse, misogynist culture."&lt;ref name="Forward blog post" /&gt;

A young female intern wearing a miniskirt and very high heels "might be able to convince herself that these fashion choices are truly her own," Strauss wrote. "More likely, she has absorbed the many ways in which porn and [[strip club|strip-club]] culture have infiltrated mainstream culture—and what she takes for empowerment is really rooted in the commodification and degradation of female sexuality. Somebody needs to tell her this. They also need to tell her that it is way easier to walk in flats."&lt;ref name="Forward blog post" /&gt;

A '''stationery cabinet''' (sometimes referred to as a stationery cupboard) is a large [[steel]] [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]] with shelves inside, used for storing a variety of items, often stationery or books or other office supplies. It may be used for a wide variety of other storage needs, including machine parts, hardware, or many other things; but offices are the location where they are most often found.

Such a cabinet is typically about 6 feet high (182.9&amp;nbsp;cm.), although some models are about {{convert|7|ft|cm}} high, and others around {{convert|4|ft|cm}} high, sometimes referred to as counter size. They are often {{convert|3|ft|cm}} wide, and {{convert|1.5|ft|cm}} deep. The 6-foot height and this width and depth are standard measurements for the most common models; even in countries where metric measurements are used for describing the dimensions, these dimensions are often exact multiples of feet or inches, presumably harking back to designs that were originally planned in exact numbers of feet or inches. Most of these standard dimensions are the same as with [[locker (cabinet)|lockers]], and the designs for the two types of cabinet appear to have a common ancestry; and indeed, stationery cabinets are usually manufactured by the same companies who produce lockers and [[filing cabinet]]s.

Stationery cabinets come with three, four, or five steel shelves which are designed to fit across the width of the cabinet, fitted into brackets in the internal walls, and the position of these can be changed in small increments, thus allowing users to adjust the height of the shelves to their particular needs.

There are two doors at the front which swing outwards from the centre: to close and lock the cabinet, the left door is closed first, and then the right door, which interlocks with a flange on the edge of the left door, thus holding it in the closed position, and the cabinet may be locked by turning a key in a lock in the right door. For added security, this door is usually equipped with [[three-point locking]]. Unlike lockers, stationery cabinets are not usually sold with a padlocking option.

'''Sujata Sadan''' is a theatre auditorium in [[Kolkata]], [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auditoriums in Kolkata|url=http://www.mapofkolkata.com/entertainment-and-recreation/auditoriums.html|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre auditorium is located at 107 Harish Mukherjee Road, [[Kolkata]] 700026.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minutes of APRIL-19&amp;20 final.pdf (application/pdf Object)|url=http://indiaculture.nic.in/indiaculture/pdf/Minutes%20of%20APRIL-19&amp;20%20final.pdf|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bengali theatre group like [[Swapnasandhani]] regularly perform in this auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A rolling repertory Stage On &amp; Off|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1061104/asp/calcutta/story_6958118.asp|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=10 March 2012|location=Calcutta, India|date=4 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate meanings==
Outside the United States the term ''suspenders'', or ''suspender belt,'' refers to an undergarment used to hold up [[stockings]]. This item is called a [[garter belt]] in American, while in UK and Australian English a garter is a device to support or adorn a [[sock]].

==UK/Australia/NewZealand/South Africa==
Suspenders or suspender belts, (known as "garter belts" in the USA), are an [[undergarment]] consisting of an elasticated material strip usually at least {{convert|2|to|3|in|cm}} in width; it can be wider. Two or three elastic suspender slings are attached on each side, where the material is shaped to the contours of the body.  The suspenders are typically clipped to [[stocking]]s with metal clips into which a rubber disc is inserted through the stocking material effectively 'locking' the stocking in place.  These are normally attached to a length of elastic allowing for adjustment. These clips, also known as suspender slings, are best attached to stockings with a simple welt that do not have lace, or 'hold-ups' with a [[silicone rubber]] lining.
Suspender (garter) belts are usually worn at the waist or just slightly below to prevent the belt sliding down as it is pulled downward by the stockings. Some undergarments such as [[corselet]]tes or [[girdles]] may come with suspender slings attached.

==USA and Canada==
'''Suspenders''' ([[American English]], [[Canadian English]]) or '''braces''' ([[British English]], [[Australian English]]) are [[fabric]] or [[leather]] [[strap]]s worn over the shoulders to hold up [[trousers]]. The straps may be elasticated, either entirely or only at attachment ends, and most straps are of woven cloth forming an X or Y shape at the back. Suspenders are typically attached to trousers with clips or buttons using leather tabs at the ends.

There have been several precursors to suspenders/braces  throughout the past 300 years, but modern versions were first invented in 1820 by Albert Thurston. They were once almost universally worn, due to the high cut of mid-nineteenth and early twentieth century trousers that made a [[belt (clothing)|belt]] impractical. During the nineteenth century, they were sometimes called galluses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jensen|first=Joan M.|title=With these hands : women working on the land|year=1981|publisher=Feminist Press|location=Old Westbury, N.Y.|isbn=9780912670904|pages=83|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1EnnWsMI7AAC&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion Glossary - G|url=http://www.ntgi.net/ICCF&amp;D/g.htm|work=The Internet Centre for Canadian Fashion and Design|accessdate=16 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020130170012/http://www.ntgi.net/ICCF%26D/g.htm|archivedate=30 January 2002|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Samuel Clemens, known for his work as the author [[Mark Twain]], patented "Adjustable and Detachable Straps for Garments" (ADSG), becoming one of the first to receive a United States patent for suspenders/braces in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2037331,00.html "A Brief History of Suspenders"], Retrieved 31 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; After losing popularity during [[World War I]], when men became accustomed to uniform belts, they remained regular attire throughout the 1920s.  Because of their image as 'underwear',&lt;ref name="Flusser221"/&gt; some men switched to belts during the 1930s as the vests (US/Canada) or waistcoats which had hidden suspenders became worn less often. This also signalled the switch in position of securing buttons from the outside of the waistband to the inside. ''Life'' magazine stated in 1938 that 60% of American men chose belts over suspenders. Though the return of fuller-cut trousers in the 1940s led to a revival, they did not dominate over belts again to the same extent. However, in the UK braces remained the norm to wear with suits and dress trousers.&lt;ref name="Flusser221"&gt;{{cite book |title= Dressing the Man: Mastering the Art of Permanent Fashion |last= Flusser |first= Alan |authorlink= Alan Flusser|year= 2002 |publisher= [[HarperCollins]] |isbn= 0-06-019144-9 |pages = 221–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="life19380725"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n08EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=Q9tkmm_XWR&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;f=true | title=Nation Splits on Suspenders | work=Life | date=1938-07-25 | accessdate=October 14, 2012 | pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion==
While passing in and out of fashion over the last century (alternating with belts in general preference), there has been a brief resurgence in interest, possibly due to the styles seen in films like ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]''{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}. Many business people, newscasters (such as [[Larry King]] in the United States)&lt;ref name="Anton154"/&gt; and professionals&lt;ref&gt;Antongiavanni (2006). p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; such as lawyers also still wear suspenders/braces.

Narrow, clip-on style suspenders/braces are also a typical part of [[skinhead]], and to a lesser extent, [[punk fashion]]. In skinhead and punk fashion, suspenders/braces are typically between {{convert|3/4|and|1|in|cm}} in width. 

Materials used for making suspenders/braces have also changed over time, with newer additions such as [[rayon]], a hard-wearing [[synthetic fiber]], now offered. The traditional Woollen [[Boxcloth]] braces remain available but are very costly, a style sometimes worn by senior lawyers in London. Generally, a high quality rayon with elastic webbing is the fabric used to create braces, with silks webbing or tubed suiting cloths from mills such as Dugdale Bros of England also used.&lt;ref name="Anton154"/&gt;

Suspenders/braces can be measured in a variety of different ways to ensure proper fitting. To accurate measure suspenders/braces, first start by measuring from the back pant line, then cross over the opposite shoulder down to the front pant line. Add a few additional inches for adjustments when required. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.mrbowtie.ca/pages/measuring&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Good quality smart suspenders/braces were traditionally considered [[White-collar worker|white collar]], or [[upper class|upper]] or [[upper-middle class]], wear. They were made to be attached to trousers by buttons sewn onto the waistband.&lt;ref name="Anton154"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Suit: A Machiavellian Approach to Men's Style |last=Antongiavanni| first=Nicholas |year=2006 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |isbn=978-0-06-089186-2 |pages = 154–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are relatively few current manufacturers in the UK, but the classic button-on 'reform' end is also quite widely available in the United States.

In traditional or formal settings, it is considered a ''[[wikt:Special:Search/faux pas|faux pas]]'' to wear both belt and suspenders/braces at the same time,&lt;ref name="Flusser221"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://men.style.com/gq/fashion/styleguy/accessories/7 |date=April 2000 |title=Should I wear a belt when I wear suspenders? |work=men.style.com |accessdate=2008-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222173931/http://men.style.com/gq/fashion/styleguy/accessories/7 |archivedate=2008-12-22 |df= }} [[link rot]]&lt;/ref&gt; though in the past this has not always been the case. Further, they were traditionally considered an undergarment and, as such, were considered inappropriate to be seen.&lt;ref name="Flusser221"/&gt; From the time of their invention until [[World War II]], the waistcoat, or a jumper or cardigan for coolness in the summer, covered suspenders/braces to prevent indecency.  Similarly, jumpers and jackets kept the shirtsleeves hidden. In the inter-war period, however, men began removing jackets in public, and so this sensibility became eroded over time. It is perhaps only in Britain that a few 'die-hards' still consider it "[[wikt:Special:Search/gauche|gauche]]"&lt;ref name="Anton154"/&gt; to wear, for example, brightly coloured suspenders without jacket. Generally, it is now considered acceptable fashion, on both sides of the Atlantic, for men's suspenders/braces to be seen.

The trousers for this use have buttons in order to attach the leather tabs; these may be either on the outside, traditionally, or inside of trousers that do not have belt loops.  With belt loops, buttons would be sewn on the inside of the waistband.  Such trousers might also have a high back in the ''fishtail'' shape, though this is not as common now;&lt;ref name="Anton154"/&gt; This style may also have an additional adjustable strap at the back, as well as the two side adjusters placed on most belt-less trousers.  Buttons should be placed about {{convert|3|to|3.5|in|cm}} apart, an equal distance from the back seam. At the front, the first button should be set over the main pleat or crease, the second button again about {{convert|3|to|3.5|in|cm}} apart.  It is important to place the buttons in the correct position, as trousers with  should remain slightly loose to hang correctly.

In the 2000s, it became fashionable for some younger women to wear suspenders/braces, a style that emerged from [[Mod (subculture)|Mod]] styles in the late 1960s through to [[punk rock]] and [[skinhead]] styles of the late 1970s into the 1980s.  One particular exponent of this fashion was [[Eurythmics]] vocalist [[Annie Lennox]], whose fashion styling was akin to cross-dressing as a male character, with her dark business suits. Unisex fashion featured not only women wearing trousers and suspenders, but men in skirts with braces as an accessory {{fact|date=January 2016}}.

== Script and improvisation ==
The dying replicant [[Roy Batty]] delivers the speech to [[Rick Deckard]], moments after Batty saved his life despite Deckard being sent to terminate him.  The scene occurs during a heavy downpour of rain, moments before Batty's own death. Reflecting on his experiences and imminent mortality he says (with dramatic pauses between each statement): 
{{bquote|I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.}}

In the documentary ''Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner'', Hauer, director [[Ridley Scott]], and screenwriter [[David Peoples]] confirm that Hauer largely wrote the "Tears in Rain" speech. Earlier versions in Peoples' draft screenplays included the sentence, "I rode on the back decks of a blinker and watched C-beams glitter in the dark, near the Tannhäuser Gate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hampton Fancher|author2=David Peoples|last-author-amp=yes|date=23 February 1981|title=Blade Runner Screenplay|url=http://www.brmovie.com/Downloads/Docs/BR_Script_1981.txt
|accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, Hauer said he merely cut the original scripted speech by several lines, adding only, "All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Rutger Hauer|author2=Patrick Quinlan|last-author-amp=yes|date=2007
 |title=All Those Moments: Stories of Heroes, Villains, Replicants and Blade Runners|publisher=[[HarperEntertainment]]|isbn=978-0-06-113389-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the original script, displayed during the documentary, before Hauer's rewrite, does not mention "Tannhäuser Gate":
{{bquote|I have known adventures, seen places you people will never see, I've been Offworld and back...frontiers! I've stood on the back deck of a blinker bound for the Plutition Camps with sweat in my eyes watching the stars fight on the shoulder of Orion. I've felt wind in my hair, riding test boats off the black galaxies and seen an attack fleet burn like a match and disappear. I've seen it...felt it!}}
Hauer described this as "opera talk" and "hi-tech speech" with no bearing on the rest of the film, so he "put a knife in it" the night before filming, without Scott's knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;105 minutes into the [[Channel 4]] documentary ''On the Edge of Blade Runner''.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Dan Jolin, Hauer said that these final lines showed that Batty wanted to "make his mark on existence ... the replicant in the final scene, by dying, shows Deckard what a {{em|real}} man is made of".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NG64WN7WruAC&amp;pg=PA159 |title=The Ridley Scott encyclopedia |author=Laurence Raw |page=159 |date=2009 |isbn=9780810869523}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hauer performed the scene, the film crew applauded, and some even cried.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/feb/06/top-10-film-moments-usual-suspects-psycho |journal=[[The Observer]] |title=The top 10 film moments - 6: Blade Runner&amp;nbsp;— Batty's dying speech in the rain |date=6 February 2000 |accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
[[Sidney Perkowitz]], writing in ''Hollywood science'', praised the speech: "If there's a great speech in science fiction cinema, it's Batty's final words." He says that it "underlines the replicant's humanlike characteristics mixed with its artificial capabilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=npB0HPVn44MC&amp;pg=PA203 |title=Hollywood science |author=S. Perkowitz |page=203 |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2007 |isbn=9780231142809}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Vest, writing in ''Future Imperfect: Philip K. Dick at the Movies'', praised the delivery of the speech: "Hauer's deft performance is heartbreaking in its gentle evocation of the memories, experiences, and passions that have driven Batty's short life".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Future Imperfect |author=Jason P. Vest |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ry-JGnxXPBQC&amp;pg=PA24 |page=24 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |date=2009 |isbn=0803218605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' writer Michael Newton noted that "in one of the film's most brilliant sequences, Roy and Deckard pursue each other through a murky apartment, playing a vicious child's game of hide and seek. As they do so, the similarities between them grow stronger – both are hunter and hunted, both are in pain, both struggle with a hurt, claw-like hand. If the film suggests a connection here that Deckard himself might still at this point deny, at the very end doubt falls away. Roy's life closes with an act of pity, one that raises him morally over the commercial institutions that would kill him. If Deckard cannot see himself in the other, Roy can. The white dove that implausibly flies up from Roy at the moment of his death perhaps stretches belief with its symbolism; but for me at least the movie has earned that moment, suggesting that in the replicant, as in the replicated technology of film itself, there remains a place for something human."&lt;ref name="Guardian 14 March 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last= Newton |first= Michael | authorlink= |title= Tears in rain? Why Blade Runner is timeless |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/14/why-blade-runner-is-timeless| date= 14 March 2015 |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate= 26 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tannhäuser Gate==
The place name Tannhäuser Gate (also written "Tannhauser Gate" and "Tanhauser Gate") is not explained in the film. It possibly derives from [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[Tannhäuser (opera)|operatic adaptation]] of the legend of the medieval German knight and poet [[Tannhäuser]].&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{Citation|last=Taylor|first=Joanne|title='Here's to Plain Speaking': The Condition(s) of Knowing and Speaking in ''Film Noir''|date=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SWNjsggTUhAC&amp;pg=PA48|journal=Florida Atlantic Comparative Studies|volume=48|pages=29–54|isbn=9781581129618}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has since been reused in other [[science fiction]] sub-genres.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/booksid=u5fSnnFiN5kC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;dq=%22tannhauser+gate%22&amp;lr=&amp;cd=37#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tannhauser%20gate%22&amp;f=false Hicham Lasri, ''Static''], {{ISBN|978-9954-1-0261-9}}, ff 255&lt;/ref&gt;

Joanne Taylor, in an article discussing [[film noir]] and its [[epistemology]], remarks on the relation between Wagner's opera and Batty's reference, and suggests that Batty aligns himself with Wagner's Tannhäuser, a character who has fallen from grace with men and with [[God]]. Both man and God, as she claims, are characters whose fate is beyond their own control.&lt;ref name = taylor/&gt;

== References in other media ==
The monologue's influence can be noted in various references and tributes.

[[Tad Williams]] paid homage in 1998 to the Batty monologue in ''[[River of Blue Fire]]'' (the second book of the [[Otherland]] series): "I've seen things you people wouldn't believe [...] Attack ships on the fire off the shores of the Nonestic Ocean. I watched magic blunderbusses flash and glitter in the dark near Glinda's palace. All those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Otherland: River of Blue Fire|last=Williams|first=Tad|publisher=DAW Books|date=1998|isbn=0-88677-777-1|location=NY, USA|pages=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosa Montero]] and Lilit Zekulin Thwaites's science fiction novel ''Tears in Rain'' (2012) is set in a future where [[Artificial consciousness|self-aware androids]] live among humans. The main character, Bruna Husky, is aware of her mortality in the same way that Roy Batty and his crew were, and Bruna often thinks about the significance of Batty's monologue. The androids in the novel, like those of ''Blade Runner'', are known as [[replicant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tor.com/2012/12/14/book-review-montero-tears-in-rain/ |title=Cyberpunk is the New Retro: Rosa Montero's Tears in Rain |last=Kross |first=Karin L. |date= |website=Tor.com |publisher=[[Tor Books]] |access-date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4244">'''The Fortune of War''' was an ancient [[public house]] in [[Smithfield, London]]. It was located on a corner originally known as ''Pie Corner'', today at the junction of [[Giltspur Street]] and [[Cock Lane]] where the [[Golden Boy of Pye Corner]] resides, the name deriving from the [[magpie]] represented on the sign of an adjoining tavern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==History==
In 1761, the tenant of the house Thomas Andrews was convicted of [[sodomy]] and sentenced to death, but was pardoned by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] in one of the first cases of public debate about [[homosexuality]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor = Rictor Norton | title = Homosexuality in Eighteenth-Century England: A Sourcebook | url = http://www.infopt.demon.co.uk/jones4.htm | accessdate = 2008-02-17 | chapter = The First Public Debate about Homosexuality in England: Letters and Editorials in the London Evening Post concerning the Case of Captain Jones, 1772 | chapterurl = http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/jones4.htm | year = 2004 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080305200604/http://www.infopt.demon.co.uk/jones4.htm | archivedate = 2008-03-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 19th century, the ''Fortune of War'' was the chief house of north of the [[River Thames]] for [[Resurrectionists in the United Kingdom|resurrectionists]], being officially appointed by the [[Royal Humane Society]] as a place "for the reception of drowned persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Forbes  | first = Thomas Rogers  | title = Crowner's Quest  | journal = Transactions of the American Philosophical Society  | volume = 68  |issue = 1  |pages = 1–52  | year = 1978  | doi = 10.2307/1006152 |publisher = American Philosophical Society | jstor = 1006152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landlord used to show the room whereon benches round the walls were placed with the snatchers' names waiting till the surgeons at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] could run round and appraise them.

The public house was demolished in 1910.

== In popular culture ==
The public house is mentioned in [[William Makepeace Thackeray|William Thackeray]]'s [[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]] (1848) in a chapter entitled "How to Live Well on Nothing a Year" (ch. 37):
&lt;blockquote&gt;The bill for servants' porter at the ''Fortune of War'' public house is a curiosity in the chronicles of beer. Every servant also was owed the greater part of his wages, and thus kept up perforce an interest in the house. Nobody in fact was paid. Not the blacksmith who opened the lock; nor the glazier who mended the pane; nor the jobber who let the carriage; nor the groom who drove it; nor the butcher who provided the leg of mutton; nor the coals which roasted it; nor the cook who basted it; nor the servants who ate it: and this I am given to understand is not infrequently the way in which people live elegantly on nothing a year.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is also mentioned by [[Charles Dickens]] in his novel ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', where Jerry Cruncher of Tellson's Bank moonlights as a [[body snatching|body snatcher]]. [[The Italian Boy]] by Sarah Wise has an excellent historical account of the infamous murder by [[London Burkers|Williams, Bishop and May]] to provide anatomical subjects for surgeons.

[[File:Scuola di atene 23.jpg|thumb|[[Bramante]] as [[Euclid]] or [[Archimedes]].]]
'''''The School of Athens''''' ({{lang-it|Scuola di Atene}}) is a [[fresco]] by the [[Italian Renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]]. It was painted between 1509 and 1511 as a part of Raphael's commission to decorate the rooms now known as the {{lang|it|[[Raphael Rooms|Stanze di Raffaello]]}}, in the [[Apostolic Palace]] in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. The {{lang|it|[[Stanza della Segnatura]]}} was the first of the rooms to be decorated, and ''The School of Athens'', representing Philosophy, was probably the third painting to be finished there, after {{lang|it|[[Disputation of the Holy Sacrament|La Disputa]]}} (Theology) on the opposite wall, and the ''[[The Parnassus|Parnassus]]'' (Literature).&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Penny, p. 74: "The execution of the ''School of Athens'' ... probably followed that of the ''Parnassus''."&lt;/ref&gt; The picture has long been seen as "Raphael's [[masterpiece]] and the perfect embodiment of the classical spirit of the Renaissance".&lt;ref name="JJ"/&gt;

==Program, subject, figure identifications and interpretations==
[[File:Raffael_071.jpg|thumb|[[Zoroaster]], [[Ptolemy]], Raphael as [[Apelles]] and [[Perugino]] or [[Timoteo Viti]] as [[Protogenes]]]]
''The School of Athens'' is one of a group of four main frescoes on the walls of the Stanza (those on either side centrally interrupted by windows) that depict distinct branches of knowledge. Each theme is identified above by a separate [[tondo (art)|tondo]] containing a majestic female figure seated in the clouds, with putti bearing the phrases: "Seek Knowledge of Causes,"  "Divine Inspiration,"  "Knowledge of Things Divine" (''Disputa''), "To Each What Is Due."  Accordingly, the figures on the walls below exemplify Philosophy, Poetry (including Music), Theology, and Law.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Giorgio Vasari]], "Raphael of Urbino", in ''Lives of the Artists'', vol. I: "In each of the four circles he made an allegorical figure to point the significance of the scene beneath, towards which it turns. For the first, where he had painted Philosophy, Astrology, Geometry and Poetry agreeing with Theology, is a woman representing Knowledge, seated in a chair supported on either side by a goddess Cybele, with the numerous breasts ascribed by the ancients to Diana Polymastes. Her garment is of four colours, representing the four elements, her head being the colour of fire, her bust that of air, her thighs that of earth, and her legs that of water." For further clarification, and introduction to more subtle interpretations, see E. H. Gombrich, "Raphael’s ''Stanza della Segnatura'' and the Nature of Its Symbolism", in ''Symbolic Images: Studies in the Art of the Renaissance'' (London: Phaidon, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional title is not Raphael's. The subject of the "School" is actually "Philosophy," or at least ancient Greek philosophy, and its overhead tondo-label, "Causarum Cognitio", tells us what kind, as it appears to echo [[Aristotle]]'s emphasis on wisdom as knowing why, hence knowing the causes, in ''Metaphysics'' Book I and ''Physics'' Book II. Indeed, [[Plato]] and Aristotle appear to be the central figures in the scene. However, all the philosophers depicted sought knowledge of first causes. Many lived before Plato and Aristotle, and hardly a third were Athenians. The architecture contains Roman elements, but the general semi-circular setting having Plato and Aristotle at its centre might be alluding to Pythagoras' ''[[Monad (philosophy)|circumpunct]]''.

Commentators have suggested that nearly every great ancient Greek philosopher can be found in the painting, but determining which are depicted is difficult, since Raphael made no designations outside possible likenesses, and no contemporary documents explain the painting. Compounding the problem, Raphael had to invent a system of iconography to allude to various figures for whom there were no traditional visual types. For example, while the [[Socrates]] figure is immediately recognizable from Classical busts, the alleged [[Epicurus]] is far removed from his standard type. Aside from the identities of the figures depicted, many aspects of the fresco have been variously interpreted, but few such interpretations are unanimously accepted among scholars.

The popular idea that the rhetorical gestures of Plato and Aristotle are kinds of pointing (to the heavens, and down to earth) is very likely. But Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' – which is the book Raphael places in his hand – was a sophisticated treatment of space, time, and change, including the Earth, which guided mathematical sciences for over a millennium. Aristotle, with his four-elements theory, held that all change on Earth was owing to motions of the heavens. In the painting Aristotle carries his ''[[Ethics (Aristotle)|Ethics]]'', which he denied could be reduced to a mathematical science. It is not certain how much the young Raphael knew of ancient philosophy, what guidance he might have had from people such as [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], or whether a detailed program was dictated by his sponsor, [[Pope Julius II]].

Nevertheless, the fresco has even recently been  interpreted as an exhortation to philosophy and, in a deeper way, as a visual representation of the role of Love in elevating people toward upper knowledge, largely in consonance with contemporary theories of Marsilio Ficino and other neo-Platonic thinkers linked to Raphael.&lt;ref&gt;M. Smolizza, ‘’Rafael y el Amor. La Escuela de Atenas como protréptico a la filosofia’’, in ‘Idea y Sentimiento. Itinerarios por el dibujo de Rafael a Cézanne’, Barcelona, 2007, pp. 29–77. [A review of the main interpretations proposed in the last two centuries.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, according to Vasari, the scene includes Raphael himself, the [[Duke of Mantua]], [[Zoroaster]] and some [[Evangelism|Evangelists]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Vasari, "Raphael received a hearty welcome from Pope Julius, and in the chamber of the Segnatura he painted the theologians reconciling Philosophy and Astrology with Theology, including portraits of all the wise men of the world in dispute."&lt;/ref&gt;

However, to [[Heinrich Wölfflin]], "it is quite wrong to attempt interpretations of the ''School of Athens'' as an esoteric treatise ... The all-important thing was the artistic motive which expressed a physical or spiritual state, and the name of the person was a matter of indifference" in Raphael's time.&lt;ref&gt;Wōlfflin, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael's artistry then orchestrates a beautiful space, continuous with that of viewers in the Stanza, in which a great variety of human figures, each one expressing "mental states by physical actions," interact, in a "polyphony" unlike anything in earlier art, in the ongoing dialogue of Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Wōlfflin, pp. 94ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

An interpretation of the fresco relating to hidden symmetries of the figures and the star constructed by Bramante was given by Guerino Mazzola and collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783540172673|authors=Guerino Mazzola et al.|title=Rasterbild - Bildraster|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1986|ISBN=3-540-17267-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main basis are two mirrored triangles on the drawing from Bramante (Euclid), which correspond to the feet positions of certain figures.&lt;ref&gt;This can be seen [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm%3A978-3-642-71700-0%2F1.pdf here].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Figures===
The identities of some of the philosophers in the picture, such as Plato and Aristotle, are certain. Beyond that, identifications of Raphael's figures have always been hypothetical. To complicate matters, beginning from Vasari's efforts, some have received multiple identifications, not only as ancients but also as figures contemporary with Raphael. [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] mentions portraits of the young [[Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua]], leaning over Bramante with his hands raised near the bottom right, and Raphael himself.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Vasari, ''Lives of the Artists'', v. I, sel. &amp; transl. by George Bull (London: Penguin, 1965), p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was writing over 40 years after the painting, and never knew Raphael, but no doubt reflects what was believed in his time.  Many other popular identifications of portraits are very dubious.

{{ill|Luitpold Dussler|de}} counts among those who can be identified with some certainty: Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, Pythagoras,&lt;ref name=Raffael&gt;Jürg Meyer zur Capellen, however, qualifies the certainty of this identification writing "eine Gruppe von Lesenden und Disputierenden, die um eine Sitzfigur, vielleicht Pythagoras, angeordnet ist." ("a group of people reading and debating, arranged around a seated figure, perhaps Pythagoras."). Jürg Meyer zur Capellen: ''Raffael'' (Munich: Beck 2010), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid,&lt;ref&gt;Again, Meyer zur Capellen is more cautious: "Eine Gruppe von Schülern umgibt einen Lehrer (Archimedes oder Euklid?), der auf einer Tafel ein geometrisches Prinzip erläutert" Jürg Meyer zur Capellen: ''Raffael'' (Munich: Beck 2010), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy, Zoroaster, Raphael, Sodoma and Diogenes of Sinope. Other identifications he holds to be "more or less speculative".&lt;ref&gt;Luitpold Dussler: ''Raphael. A Critical Catalogue'' (London and New York: Phaidon 1971), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central figures (14 and 15)===
[[Image:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|180 px|left||An elder [[Plato]] walks alongside [[Aristotle]].]]
In the center of the fresco, at its architecture's central [[vanishing point]], are the two undisputed main subjects: [[Plato]] on the left and [[Aristotle]], his student, on the right. Both figures hold modern (of the time), bound copies of their books in their left hands, while gesturing with their right. Plato holds ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'',  Aristotle his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. Plato is depicted as old, grey, wise-looking, and bare-foot.  By contrast Aristotle, slightly ahead of him, is in mature manhood, handsome, well-shod and dressed with gold, and the youth about them seem to look his way.  In addition, these two central figures gesture along different dimensions: Plato vertically, upward along the picture-plane, into the beautiful vault above; Aristotle on the horizontal plane at right-angles to the picture-plane (hence in strong [[foreshortening]]), initiating a powerful flow of space toward viewers.

It is popularly thought that their gestures indicate central aspects of their philosophies, for [[Plato]], his [[Theory of Forms]], and for Aristotle, his [[Empiricism|empiricist]] views, with an emphasis on concrete [[particular]]s. Many interpret the painting to show a divergence of the two philosophical schools. Plato argues a sense of timelessness whilst Aristotle looks into the physicality of life and the present realm.

===Setting===
[[File:Raffael_060.jpg|thumb|Detail of the architecture]]
The building is in the shape of a [[St. Clement's Cross|Greek cross]], which some have suggested was intended to show a harmony between [[paganism|pagan]] [[philosophy]] and [[Christian theology]]&lt;ref name="JJ"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MMYHuvhWBH4C''History of Art: The Western Tradition''] by Horst Woldemar Janson, Anthony F. Janson (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Christianity and Paganism]] and [[Christian philosophy]]). The architecture of the building was inspired by the work of [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], who, according to [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]], helped Raphael with the architecture in the picture.&lt;ref name="JJ"/&gt; (The resulting architecture was similar to the then new [[St. Peter's Basilica]].)&lt;ref name="JJ"/&gt;

There are two sculptures in the background. The one on the left is the god [[Apollo]], god of light, archery and music, holding a [[lyre]].&lt;ref name="JJ"/&gt; The sculpture on the right is [[Athena]], goddess of [[wisdom]], in her Roman guise as [[Minerva]].&lt;ref name="JJ"/&gt;

The main arch, above the characters, shows a [[Meander (art)|meander]] (also known as a Greek fret or Greek key design), a design using continuous lines that repeat in a "series of rectangular bends" which originated on pottery of the Greek Geometric period and then become widely used in ancient Greek architectural friezes.&lt;ref&gt;Lyttleton, Margaret.

==Copies==
The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] has a rectangular version over 4 metres by 8 metres in size, painted on canvas, dated 1755 by [[Anton Raphael Mengs]] on display in the eastern Cast Court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O89799/the-school-of-athens-after-oil-painting-mengs-anton-raphael/ V&amp;A Museum: Copy of Raphael's School of Athens in the Vatican]. collections.vam.ac.uk (2009-08-25). Retrieved on 2016-03-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern reproductions of the fresco abound.  For example, a full-size one can be seen in the auditorium of Old Cabell Hall at the [[University of Virginia]]. Produced in 1902 by George W. Breck to replace an older reproduction that was destroyed in a fire in 1895, it is four inches off scale from the original, because the Vatican would not allow identical reproductions of its art works.&lt;ref&gt;Information on [http://www.virginia.edu/music/cabell.html Old Cabell Hall] from University of Virginia&lt;/ref&gt;

A copy of Raphael's School of Athens was painted on the wall of the ceremonial stairwell that leads to the famous, main-floor reading room of the [[Sainte-Geneviève Library|Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève]] in Paris.

The two figures at the left of Plotinus were used as part of the cover art of both ''[[Use Your Illusion I]]'' and ''[[Use Your Illusion II|II]]'' albums of [[Guns N' Roses]].

==Theme==
[[File:MANNapoli 124545 plato's academy mosaic.jpg|thumb|[[Plato's Academy mosaic]] from [[Pompeii]]]]
A similar theme is known as [[Plato's Academy mosaic]], and perhaps emerged in form of statues at the [[Serapeum of Alexandria]] and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] [[Saqqara]]. Mimaut mentioned in the 19th century nine statues at Serapeum of Alexandria holding rolls. Eleven statues were found at [[Saqqara]]. A review of "Les Statues Ptolémaïques du Sarapieion de Memphis" noted they were probably sculpted in the 3rd century with limestone and stucco, some standing others sitting. [[Alan Rowe (archaeologist)|Rowe]] and Rees 1956 suggested that both scenes in the Serapeum of Alexandria and Saqqara share a similar theme, such as with Plato's Academy mosaic, with Saqqara figures attributed to: "(1) Pindare, (2) Démétrios de Phalère, (3) x (?), (4) Orphée (?) aux oiseaux, (5) Hésiode, (6) Homère, (7) x (?), (8) Protagoras, (9) Thalès, (10) Héraclite, (11) Platon, (12) Aristote (?)."&lt;ref name="RoweRees1956"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1914&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF|authors=Alan Rowe and B.

'''''The Shadow over Innsmouth''''' is a [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[novella]] by American author [[H. P. Lovecraft]], written in November–December [[1931 in literature|1931]]. It forms part of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]], using 
its motif of a malign undersea civilization, and references several shared elements of the Mythos, including place-names, mythical creatures, and invocations. ''The Shadow over Innsmouth'' is the only Lovecraft story which was published in book form during his lifetime.

The narrator is a student conducting an antiquarian tour of New England. He travels through the nearby decrepit seaport of [[Innsmouth]] which is suggested as a cheaper and potentially interesting next leg of his journey. He travels to Innsmouth, interacting with strange people, and observes disturbing events that ultimately lead to horrifying, and personal, revelations.

==Plot==
The [[narrator]] explains how he instigated a secret investigation of the ruined town of [[Innsmouth]], [[Massachusetts]], by the U.S. government. He proceeds to describe in detail the events surrounding his initial interest in the town, which lies along the route of his tour across [[New England]], taken when he was twenty-one. While he waits for the bus that will take him to Innsmouth, he busies himself in the neighboring [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]] by gathering information on the town from the locals; all of it having [[superstition|superstitious]] overtones. The narrator finds Innsmouth to be a mostly deserted fishing town, full of dilapidated buildings and people who walk with a distinctive shambling gait and have "queer narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy, stary eyes". The only person in town who appears normal is a grocery store clerk from neighboring [[Arkham]]. The narrator gathers much information from the clerk, including a map of the town and the name of Zadok Allen, an elderly local who might give him information when plied with drink. The narrator hears repeatedly that outsiders are never welcomed in Innsmouth, and that strangers, particularly government investigators, have disappeared when they pry too deeply into the town.

The narrator meets Zadok, who explains that an Innsmouth merchant named Obed Marsh discovered a race of fish-like humanoids known as the [[Deep One]]s. When hard times fell on the town, Obed established a [[cult]] called the Esoteric Order of Dagon, which offered [[human sacrifice]]s to the Deep Ones in exchange for wealth in the form of large fish hauls and unique jewelry. When Obed and his followers were arrested, the Deep Ones attacked the town and killed more than half of its population, leaving the survivors with no other choice than to continue Obed's practices. Male and female inhabitants were forced to breed with the Deep Ones, producing hybrid offspring which have the appearance of normal humans in early life but, in adulthood, slowly transform into Deep Ones themselves and leave the surface to live in ancient undersea cities for eternity. He further explains that these ocean-dwellers have designs on the surface world and have been planning the use of [[Shoggoth]] to conquer or transform it. Zadok sees strange waves approaching the dock and tells the narrator that they have been seen, urging him to leave town immediately. The narrator is unnerved, but ultimately dismisses the story. Once he leaves, Zadok disappears and is never seen again.

After being told that the bus is experiencing engine trouble, the narrator has no choice but to spend the night in a musty hotel, the Gilman House. While attempting to sleep, he hears noises at his door as if someone is trying to enter. Wasting no time, he escapes out a window and through the streets while a town-wide hunt for him occurs, forcing him at times to imitate the peculiar walk of the Innsmouth locals as he walks past search parties in the darkness. Eventually, he makes his way towards railroad tracks and hears a procession of Deep Ones passing in the road before him. Against his judgment, he opens his eyes to see the creatures and faints at his hiding spot. He wakes up unharmed. Over the years that pass, he researches his family tree and discovers that he is a descendant of Obed Marsh, and realizes that he is changing into one of the Deep Ones. As the story ends, the narrator is accepting his fate and feels he will be happy living with the Deep Ones. He plans to break out his cousin from an asylum, who is even further transformed than he, and take him to the Deep Ones' city beneath the sea.

==Characters==
;Robert Olmstead
:Olmstead is the narrator and protagonist of the story. He discovers [[Innsmouth]] on a tour of New England while seeking [[genealogical]] information, and finds more than he bargained for.
:The character, unnamed in ''The Shadow over Innsmouth'', is called "Robert Olmstead" in Lovecraft's notes for the story, published in [[Arkham House]]'s ''Something About Cats and Other Pieces'' (1949).&lt;ref&gt;S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz, "Olmstead, Robert", ''An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia'', p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia]]'' points out that Olmstead's travel habits parallel Lovecraft's own—Lovecraft too would "seek the cheapest route", and Olmstead's dinner of "vegetable soup with crackers" is typical of Lovecraft's low-budget diet.&lt;ref&gt;S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz, "The Shadow Over Innsmouth", ''An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia'', pp. 239&amp;ndash;240.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Obed Marsh
:Wealthy sea captain, patriarch of the elite Marsh family, and the founder of the ''Esoteric Order of Dagon''. He was referred to by [[#Zadok Allen|Zadok Allen]] as being the man who first summoned the [[Deep One]]s to Innsmouth. In 1846, he was jailed after the towns bordering Innsmouth became suspicious of his crew. He died in 1878. 
:According to Lovecraft's story notes, Marsh's daughter, Alice, is Robert Olmstead's great-grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;Joshi and Schultz, "Olmstead, Robert", p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; 
;Barnabas Marsh
:Known as Old Man Marsh, he is the grandson of Obed Marsh and the owner of the Marsh refinery at the time of ''The Shadow Over Innsmouth''. Barnabas' father was Onesiphorus Marsh, Obed's son by his fully human wife; though Barnabas' mother, who was never seen in public, was apparently an actual [[Deep One]]. Zadok Allen says of him: "Right naow Barnabas is abaout changed. Can't shet his eyes no more, an' is all aout o' shape. They say he still wears clothes, but he'll take to the water soon." 
;Zadok Allen
:One of the few completely human residents of [[Innsmouth]], and an alcoholic. His drunken ramblings allow Lovecraft to convey much of the town's secret backstory to the story's protagonist. Born in 1831, Allen disappears, and dies in 1927, after being kidnapped and sacrificed by the [[Esoteric Order of Dagon]]. 
:''An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia'' notes that Allen resembles—and shares his years of birth and death with—Jonathan E. Hoag, an amateur poet of Lovecraft's acquaintance. A possible literary inspiration is the character of Dr. Humphrey Lathrop in Herbert Gorman's ''The Place Called Dagon'' (1927), who, like Allen, is a drinker who knows the secret history of his town.&lt;ref&gt;S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz, "Allen, Zadok", ''An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia'', pp. 3, 239.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Grocery store clerk
:An unnamed youth of about seventeen who is a native resident of [[Arkham]], and therefore completely human. His superiors transferred him to Innsmouth, and both he and his family loathe the idea of him working there, but he cannot afford to quit his job. He is only too happy to encounter the narrator, and describes the sinister goings-on within Innsmouth, but the boy is unaware of what is really happening in the town. He tells the narrator of the bizarre deformities afflicting the native townspeople, and how the older generation are almost never seen outdoors due to their monstrous appearance. He also briefly informs the narrator of the [[Esoteric Order of Dagon]], and what he knows of the town's society, and directs him to the drunkard, Zadok Allen, for more information.

==Inspiration==
Both of Lovecraft's parents died in a mental hospital, and some critics believe that a concern with having inherited a propensity for physical and mental degeneration is reflected in the plot of ''The Shadow over Innsmouth''. It also shares some themes with his earlier story, "[[Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and His Family]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ronan, Margaret, Foreword to ''The Shadow over Innsmouth and Other Stories of Horror'', Scholastic Book Services, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cthulhu]], an entity from previous Lovecraft stories, is the overlord of the sea creatures. The mind of the narrator deteriorates when he is afforded a glimpse of what exists outside his perceived reality. This is a central tenet of [[Cosmicism]], which Lovecraft emphasizes in the opening sentence of "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]": "The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents."&lt;ref name="The Call of Cthulhu"&gt;HP Lovecraft, "The Call of Cthulhu" (1928).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovecraft based the town of Innsmouth on his impressions of [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], which he had visited in 1923 and fall 1931.&lt;ref&gt;''The Call of Cthulhu and Other Dark Tales'', Barnes and Noble, 2009, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;  The real Newburyport features as a neighboring town in the narrative. A likely influence on the plot is Lovecraft's horror of [[miscegenation]], which is documented by Lovecraft biographer L. Sprague de Camp&lt;ref name="decamp" /&gt; and others.

[[Robert M. Price]] cites two works as literary sources for ''The Shadow over Innsmouth'': [[Robert W. Chambers]]' "The Harbor-Master" and [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s "Fishhead". Chambers' story concerns the discovery of "the remnants of the last race of amphibious human beings," living in a five-mile deep chasm just off the [[Atlantic]] coast. The creature of the title is described as "a man with round, fixed, fishy eyes, and soft, slaty skin. But the horror of the thing were the two gills that swelled and relaxed spasmodically."&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Chambers, "The Harbor-Master," ''The Innsmouth Cycle'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Lovecraft was evidently impressed by this tale, writing in a letter to [[Frank Belknap Long]]: "God! The Harbour-Master!!!"&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft, letter to Frank Belknap Long, October 17, 1930; cited in Robert M. Price, ''The Innsmouth Cycle'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; "Fishhead" is the story of a "human monstrosity" with an uncanny resemblance to a fish: his skull sloped back so abruptly that he could hardly be said to have a forehead at all; his chin slanted off right into nothing. His eyes were small and round with shallow, glazed, pink-yellow pupils, and they were set wide apart on his head, and they were unwinking and staring, like a fish's eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Irvin S. Cobb, "Fishhead," ''The Innsmouth Cycle'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Lovecraft, in "[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]," called Cobb's story "banefully effective in its portrayal of unnatural affinities between a hybrid idiot and the strange fish of an isolated lake".&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft, "Supernatural Horror in Literature," ''Dagon and Other Macabre Tales'', p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; Price notes that Fishhead, as the "son of a Negro father and a [[half-breed]] Indian mother," "embodies unambiguously the basic premise of ''The Shadow Over Innsmouth''.... This, of course, is really what Lovecraft found revolting in the idea of interracial marriage...the subtextual hook of different ethnic races mating and 'polluting' the gene pool."&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Price, ''The Innsmouth Cycle'', p. 24. The creature in "The Harbor-Master" is mistaken for a "demented darky". Chambers, "The Harbor-Master," p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Price points out the resemblance in names between the Deep One city of Y'ha-nthlei and Yoharneth-Lahai, a fictional deity in [[Lord Dunsany]]'s ''[[The Gods of Pegana]],'' who "sendeth little dreams out of Pegana to please the people of Earth"—a precursor to Lovecraft's fictional deity [[Cthulhu]], who sends less pleasant dreams from [[R'lyeh]].&lt;ref&gt;Lord Dunsany, "Of Yoharneth-Lahai," ''The Innsmouth Cycle'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The description of the Deep Ones has similarities to the sea creature described in [[H.G. Wells]]' short story "[[In the Abyss]]" (1896)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horrormasters.com/Text/a1047.pdf "In the Abyss"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705164246/http://www.horrormasters.com/Text/a1047.pdf |date=2008-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;:

{{bquote|Two large and protruding eyes projected from sockets in chameleon fashion, and it had a broad reptilian mouth with horny lips beneath its little nostrils. In the position of the ears were two huge gill-covers, and out of these floated a branching tree of coralline filaments, almost like the tree-like gills that very young rays and sharks possess. But the humanity of the face was not the most extraordinary thing about the creature. It was a biped; its almost globular body was poised on a tripod of two frog-like legs and a long, thick tail, and its fore limbs, which grotesquely caricatured the human hand, much as a frog’s do, carried a long shaft of bone, tipped with copper. The colour of the creature was variegated; its head, hands, and legs were purple; but its skin, which hung loosely upon it, even as clothes might do, was a phosphorescent grey.}}

==Cthulhu Mythos==
* [[Cthulhu]] and [[R'lyeh]] are mentioned, the former in passing by Zadok Allen, and both toward the end of the narrative.
* The creature known as [[Dagon (Cthulhu Mythos)|Dagon]] is first introduced in Lovecraft's [[1917 in literature|1917]] [[Dagon (short story)|tale of the same name]].
* As related in "[[The Thing on the Doorstep]]" ([[1937 in literature|1937]]), [[The Thing on the Doorstep#Asenath Waite Derby|Asenath Waite]], the possessed victim of her father [[The Thing on the Doorstep#Ephraim Waite|Ephraim Waite]], is by implication one of the human/Deep One hybrids, and was a resident of Innsmouth before attending [[Miskatonic University]]. The servants she brings into her marriage to [[The Thing on the Doorstep#Edward Derby|Edward Derby]] are likewise Innsmouth natives. This occurs after ''The Shadow over Innsmouth'' and Asenath's father and she escaped the government raid mentioned in the original story.{{original research inline|date=April 2013}}
* The Waites, Gilmans, Eliots and Marshes are the "gently bred" families of Innsmouth. Despite his name, the protagonist of "[[The Dreams in the Witch House]]", [[The Dreams in the Witch House#Walter Gilman|Walter Gilman]], is not established as having any links to Innsmouth or the Deep Ones.
* August Derleth also used the Deep Ones in the short story "Innsmouth Clay", which he completed from Lovecraft's notes. "The Shuttered Room" is another short story started by Lovecraft, and finished by Derleth, which also involves the Deep Ones. It mentions a connection between the Marsh family of Innsmouth and the Whateley family of Dunwich from "[[The Dunwich Horror]]".

==Publication==
[[File:Weird Tales January 1942.jpg|thumb|Although rejected by the magazine during Lovecraft's lifetime, ''The Shadow over Innsmouth'' was reprinted in ''Weird Tales'' in 1942]]

Lovecraft was quite critical of ''The Shadow over Innsmouth'', writing to August Derleth that the story "has all the defects I deplore—especially in point of style, where hackneyed phrases &amp; rhythms have crept in despite all precautions.... No—I don't intend to offer 'The Shadow Over Innsmouth' for publication, for it would stand no chance of acceptance."&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft, letter to August Derleth, December 10, 1931; cited in Joshi and Schultz, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story was rejected by ''[[Weird Tales]]'' editor [[Farnsworth Wright]] when Derleth surreptitiously submitted it for publication in 1933. "I have read Lovecraft's story...and must confess that it fascinates me," he wrote to Derleth. "But I don't know just what I can do with it. It is hard to break a story of this kind into two parts, and it is too long to run complete in one part."&lt;ref&gt;Farnsworth Wright, letter to August Derleth, January 17, 1933; cited in Joshi and Schultz, pp. 238&amp;ndash;239.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1935, [[William L. Crawford]]'s [[Visionary Publishing Company]]  began the process of issuing ''The Shadow Over Innsmouth'' as a book. The project came to fruition in November 1936 (although the copyright page declares the date of publication as April 1936), but the book had so many typographical errors that Lovecraft insisted on an [[errata]] sheet (which was also faulty). Lovecraft was displeased with the production; writing to his correspondent Lee McBride White on Nov 30, 1936, he wrote: "My ''Shadow Over Innsmouth'' is now out - but as a first cloth-bound book it doesn't awake any enthusiasm in me. Indeed, it is one of the lousiest jobs I've ever seen - 30 misprints, slovenly format, &amp; loose, slipshod binding. The solitary redeeming feature is the set of Utpatel illustrations - one of which, on the dust wrapper, saves the appearance of the thing..." &lt;ref&gt; H. P. Lovecraft. ''Letters to J. Vernon Shea, Carl F. Strauch and Lee McBride White''. ed. S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz. NY: Hippocampus Press, 2016, p. 378 &lt;/ref&gt; 

It had a bound run of 200 copies — the only book of Lovecraft's fiction distributed during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Lin Carter, ''Lovecraft: A Look Behind the Cthulhu Mythos'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;August Derleth, "H. P. Lovecraft—Outsider," p. 18, ''Crypt of Cthulhu #93''.&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford had printed 400 copies but bound only 200; the others were destroyed later. Of this edition Robert Weinberg has written: "Only a few hundred copies of the book were printed, and even less than that were sold, even though it was available at the bargain price of $1 per copy. It featured good paper, black linen binding and four illustrations by Frank Utpatel. The book was the only bound hardcover to appear during Lovecraft's lifetime and became one of the true rarities in the collecting field. Its failure, and the poor sales of third non-fantasy book convinced [[William L. Crawford|William Crawford]] of the futility of his efforts." &lt;ref&gt;Robert Weinberg, "Science Fiction Specialty Publishers" in Hall, Hal W. (ed). ''Science Fiction Collections: Fantasy, Supernatural and Weird Tales''. Haworth Press, 1983, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lovecraft's death (and Wright's), the story appeared in an unauthorized abridged version in the January 1942 issue of ''Weird Tales''.&lt;ref&gt;Price, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=May 2015}}

As [[L Sprague de Camp]] noted, the action sections of ''Innsmouth'' are a departure for Lovecraft; the story's tense and memorable siege scene within the titular town's hotel reveals a flair in execution on a par with some of the most compelling chapters of R L Stevenson's ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]''. [[August Derleth]] called ''The Shadow over Innsmouth'' "a dark, brooding story, typical of Lovecraft at his best."&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Weinberg (author)|Robert Weinberg]] praised it as  "a well-written story".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Weinberg, ''The Weird Tales Story''. FAX Colle ctor’s Editions.{{ISBN|0913960160}}  (p. 45)&lt;/ref&gt; According to de Camp, Lovecraft distrusted his ability to narrate action, and the story is unusual in that Lovecraft includes sustained and effective&lt;ref name="decamp"&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Camp|first1=L Sprague|title=Lovecraft: A Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; action writing during the culmination of the events in Innsmouth.

==Adaptations==
===Film and television===
*Colombian writer [[Andres Caicedo]] adapted ''The Shadow over Innsmouth'' into a screenplay in 1973. He traveled to Hollywood in 1975 to sell it to [[Roger Corman]], alongside his adaptation of Clark Ashton Smith's ''The Nameless Offspring'', but failed in his purpose. Neither of the screenplays was shot and remain as part of the Andres Caicedo Collection in the [[Luis Angel Arango Library]] in [[Bogota]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
*[[Chiaki J. Konaka]] adapted ''The Shadow over Innsmouth'' for Japanese television as ''Insmus wo Oou Kage'' in 1992.
*''The Shadow over Innsmouth'' forms the principal storyline in [[Stuart Gordon]]'s 2001 film ''[[Dagon (film)|Dagon]]''. [[Full Moon Entertainment]] was going to release Gordon's original adaptation (under the original novella's title) in 1991, using [[Bernie Wrightson]]'s character designs, but the project was unrealized. ''Dagon'' uses some of Wrightson's designs from that project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mullins |first=Craig |url=http://unfilmable.blogspot.com/2009/03/pickmans-models-shadow-over-innsmouth.html |title=Unfilmable.com: Pickman's Models: Shadow Over Innsmouth |publisher=Unfilmable.blogspot.com |date=2009-03-22 |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 2007 film ''[[Cthulhu (2007 film)|Cthulhu]]'' is loosely based on ''The Shadow over Innsmouth''.
*The 2014 music video for "Escape from Midwich Valley" by [[Carpenter Brut]] and the 2015 short film ''[[Innsmouth (short film)|Innsmouth]]'' are also based on ''The Shadow over Innsmouth''.
*The 2005 episode of [[The Mighty Boosh (TV series)|''The Mighty Boosh'']], "[[The Mighty Boosh (series 2)#Episodes|The Legend of Old Gregg]]", appears to draw inspiration from the story, including a town with strange residents surrounded by mystery, an elderly fisherman who tells the main characters the history of the town and Old Gregg himself, who is a human-fish hybrid.
*In 2015, the production and eventual publication of a film titled ''The Shadow over Innsmouth'' was announced on the website ''The Lovecraft Ezine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis |first=Mike |url=https://lovecraftzine.com/2015/09/15/coming-soon-a-new-film-adaption-of-the-shadow-over-innsmouth/ |title=The Lovecraft Ezine.com: Coming soon: A new film adaption of “The Shadow Over Innsmouth”! |publisher=The Lovecraft Ezine.com |date=2015-09-15 |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis |first=Mike |url=https://lovecraftzine.com/2015/11/16/teasertrailer-for-the-upcoming-the-shadow-over-innsmouth-film/ |title=Teaser/Trailer for the upcoming “The Shadow Over Innsmouth” film |publisher=The Lovecraft Ezine.com |date=2015-11-16 |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film project, cited to be a very faithful adaptation of the novella, was directed by [[Bryan Moore (director)|Bryan Moore]], who worked on a previous [[Cool Air (film)|cinematic conversion]] of the Lovecraft short story "[[Cool Air]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hplfilmfestival.com/hplfilmfestival-portland-or/schedule/20th-annual-hp-lovecraft-film-festival-portland-or/return |title=Return of the Lurkers: Bryan Moore's Cool Air &amp; The Shadow Over Innsmouth preview |publisher=H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival.com |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
*''[[Shadow of the Comet]]'', a 1993 adventure game, takes place in a cult-controlled town of Illsmouth, an alteration on Lovecraft's Innsmouth.
*''Innsmouth no Yakata'' (インスマウスの館, lit. "''The Mansion of Innsmouth''") is a 1995 [[Stereoscopy|3D]] [[first-person shooter]] video game for the [[Virtual Boy]], released in Japan based on Chiaki J. Konaka's 1992 television series ''Insmus wo Oou Kage''. It featured a branching level structure and four possible endings.
*In the 2005 first-person action-adventure video game ''[[Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth]]'' the town of Innsmouth is the backdrop, the opening plot of which follows the second, third and fourth chapters of the novella with a great degree of accuracy (with a different protagonist). ''Dark Corners of the Earth'' was supposed to be followed by a sequel set in the 2000s, titled ''[[Call of Cthulhu: Destiny's End]]'', now cancelled.
*[[Indie game]] ''Chronicle of Innsmouth'' (production started in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Adventure Game Studio {{!}} Forums {{!}} Chronicle of Innsmouth - On Steam greenlight - Demo available [Updated 10-05-2015]|url = http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/forums/index.php?PHPSESSID=11dhdv5usk8keh53qnmq98mks0&amp;topic=51243.msg636499726#msg636499726|work= www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk|access-date= 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is directly based on the plot of ''The Shadow over Innsmouth''.
*In the fictional universe of the 2013 fighting game ''[[Skullgirls]]'', there's a neighborhood in the game's world known as "Little Innsmouth", which is inhabited by fish-like humanoids, and which also serves as the stage for Ms. Fortune, one of the game's characters.
*In the DLC of [[Bloodborne]], [[The Old Hunters]], a hamlet inhabited by gruesome fishermen allegedly draw its inspiration from the accursed fishing village in ''The Shadow over Innsmouth''. The game also features several deities which are referred to as "Great Ones".
*The ''Far Harbor'' expansion of the 2015 game ''[[Fallout 4]]'' may draw inspiration from the Lovecraft universe, particularly ''The Shadow over Innsmouth''.{{cn|date=October 2017}}
*''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' has a quest named "A shadow over Hackdirt" .The quest follows roughly the same plot as the novel. E.g the player goes to the small mysterious town and finds out  the townspeople are a part of a cult who worship beings who live under ground, the townspeople call these beings "The Deep Ones" also if the player waits in the cave the "Deep Ones" can be heard roaring, indicating that they are real and are there.
*The online video game ''[[The Secret World]]'' features a town called Kingsmouth in which many supernatural events occur. Additionally, the Innsmouth Academy is a part of the Solomon Island zone in which Kingsmouth may be found. The Secret World borrows heavily from the Lovecraftian mythos as well as many other continuities.

===Comics===
*[[Alberto Breccia]] adapted the story in 1973.
*[[Ron Marz]] adapted the story for [[Dynamite Entertainment]]  in 2014, crossing over Lovecraft's story with The Shadow franchise, therefore creating a double meaning in the title and having the characters of Lamont Cranston and Margo Lane find themselves trapped within the town.
*Several plot elements from "Shadow over Innsmouth" appear in two comics of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] franchise, namely in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)|Mirage comic]] "Men of Shadow" (''TMNT'' Vol.1 #29) and the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures|Archie comic]] "In the Dark" (''TMNT Adventures'' #27).

===Card and board games===
*''[[Magic the Gathering]]''{{'}}s "[[Innistrad]]" block and its follow up, the "[[Shadows over Innistrad]]" block, contain minor references to ''The Shadow over Innsmouth''. "Shadows over Innistrad" tells the story of the planeswalker Jace Beleren investigating the source of madness affecting the residents of Innistrad and their angelic protectors. The source is revealed to be Emrakul, one of a race of ancient beings called Eldrazi, who draw heavy influence from Lovecraft. In addition to inducing madness, Emrakul's influence warps the physiology of living beings in her vicinity, giving them a distinctive "look" of latticed flesh, additional appendages, and other strange mutations.
*The board game ''Mansions of Madness'' Second Edition utilizes the story of ''The Shadow Over Innsmouth'' as one the scenarios players can choose to play.  Players begin the scenario in a hotel room in a rundown seaport town and take turns trying to uncover the mystery of what happened in Innsmouth before they find themselves stranded in a town flooded with supernatural problems. The companion app for the board game includes quotes from Lovecraft's original work and there are several miniature figures referred to as Deep Ones. Additionally, an expansion for the board game ''Arkham Horror'' features the town of Innsmouth and includes references to Lovecraft's piece. The game is titled, ''Arkham Horror: The Innsmouth Horror Expansion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/40776/arkham-horror-innsmouth-horror-expansion|title=Arkham Horror: Innsmouth Horror Expansion|author=|date=|website=BoardGameGeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
*The [[H. P. Lovecraft Historical Society]] produced ''[[Dark Adventure Radio Theatre: The Shadow over Innsmouth]]'', a [[Dark Adventure Radio Theatre]] adaptation of the story. In January 2012, the [[Cape Cod]] based Provincetown Theater announced a reading of a full-length play of the story, entitled ''HP Lovecraft's The Shadow over Innsmouth'', adapted for the stage by Bragan Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sowers |first=Pru |url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/wellfleet/news/x870491680/Winter-play-series-kicks-off-at-Provincetown-Theater#axzz1krEFOWxw |title=Winter play series kicks off at Provincetown Theater - - Wicked Local Wellfleet |publisher=Wickedlocal.com |date=2012-01-30 |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The short story "Shoggoth's Old Peculiar" (''[[Smoke and Mirrors (story collection)|Smoke and Mirrors]]'', 1998) by [[Neil Gaiman]] contains many similarities to "The Shadow over Innsmouth": a student visits the coastal town of Innsmouth (in England rather than New England), he gets to talking to two drunks (parodies of [[Peter Cook]] and [[Dudley Moore]]), he sees horrors in the water, and he passes out.

==''Shadows over Innsmouth''==
''The Shadow over Innsmouth'' was republished in a 1994 anthology with stories by other authors based on Innsmouth and the Old Ones in ''[[Shadows over Innsmouth]]''. The collection was edited by [[Stephen Jones (author)|Stephen Jones]], and included contributions by Neil Gaiman, [[Ramsey Campbell]], [[David Sutton (writer)|David Sutton]], [[Kim Newman]] (both as himself and Jack Yeovil), and other authors.[[File:Shadows Over Innsmouth (1994 anthology - cover).jpg|upright|]]

Ventoura was founded by Matt Fox, an Australian living in Helsinki in 2014. Fox raised a seed investment round for Ventoura in mid 2014, and Ventoura launched in early 2015.  

Due to disputes, Fox left the company to found another more successful mobile application called Sweat Mobile and ended up selling his shares to an investor in early 2016.  

Ventoura was not founded by IT/engineering professionals, nor did it relocate offices, as displayed here earlier and displayed in this article by [http://app.griffith.edu.au/news/2015/04/22/graduates-set-to-make-millions-from-travel-app/ Griffith University].  {{Infobox company

'''VisitBritain''' is the name used by the '''British Tourist Authority''', the [[Tourism in the United Kingdom|tourist]] board of [[Great Britain]] incorporated under the Development of Tourism Act 1969.

Under memoranda of understanding with the [[Northern Ireland Tourist Board]] and the offshore islands of [[Guernsey]], [[Jersey]] and the [[Isle of Man]], VisitBritain also hosts information on those territories on its website.  However, under the 1969 Act, the remit of the organisation extends only to [[Great Britain]] rather than the whole of the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitbritain.com/en/destinations/northern-ireland/index.aspx VisitBritain - Northern Ireland] - Northern Ireland section of the VisitBritain website&lt;/ref&gt;
 
VisitBritain was created in April 2003 to market Britain to the rest of the world and to promote and develop the visitor economy of [[England]]. It was formed out of a merger between the [[British Tourist Authority]] and the [[English Tourism Council]], and is a [[non-departmental public body]] responsible to the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]].  In April 2009, VisitEngland became more of a stand-alone body from VisitBritain, more on a par with the devolved entities, [[VisitScotland]] and [[VisitWales]].

In 2005, it was voted the world's leading Tourist and Convention Bureau in the World Travel Awards.
In the Webby Awards it has been an Official Honoree in the 10th&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current_honorees.php?media_id=96&amp;category_id=66&amp;season=10 Webby Awards 10th] 10th&lt;/ref&gt; and 12th&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current_honorees.php?category_id=66 Webby Awards 12th] 12th&lt;/ref&gt; Webby Awards in the Tourism Category.
In 2008 it was also awarded the Travelmole Best Tourist Board Website award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelmole.com/webawards_uk2008.php#Tourist_Board Travelmole] Award&lt;/ref&gt;

VisitBritain is a founding partner of [[ENAT]], the European Network for Accessible Tourism, an international organisation based in Europe, set up in 2006 to promote [[accessible tourism]].

The adage is named after [[Niklaus Wirth]], who discussed it in his 1995 paper, "A Plea for Lean Software".&lt;ref name=PleaLean&gt;{{ cite journal | title= A Plea for Lean Software | authorlink=Niklaus Wirth |first=Niklaus |last=Wirth | url= http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/2.348001 | accessdate= 2007-01-13 | magazine=[[Computer (magazine)|Computer]] | date=February 1995 | volume=28 | issue=2 | pages=64–68 | doi= 10.1109/2.348001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/materials/5-commandments | journal = IEEE Spectrum | title=5 Commandments |first=Philip E. |last=Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Wirth attributed the saying to [[Martin Reiser]], who, in the preface to his book on the [[Oberon operating system|Oberon System]], wrote: "The hope is that the progress in hardware will cure all software ills. However, a critical observer may observe that software manages to outgrow hardware in size and sluggishness."&lt;ref name=OberonBook&gt;{{ cite book | title= The Oberon System User Guide and Programmer's Manual | last= Reiser | first=Martin | year=1991 | isbn=0-201-54422-9 | publisher=ACM Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other observers had noted this for some time before; indeed the trend was becoming obvious as early as 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1987|title=Yes, There IS a Difference Between Micros and 'Big' Computers|url=http://tpug.icomm.ca/nl/tn-v2n1.htm#YesThereISADifference|journal=[[TPUG News]]|volume=2|issue=1|first=Geoffrey |last=Welsh|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310224703/http://tpug.icomm.ca/nl/tn-v2n1.htm#YesThereISADifference|archivedate=March 10, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He states two contributing factors to the acceptance of ever-growing software as: "rapidly growing hardware performance," and "customers' ignorance of features that are essential versus nice-to-have".&lt;ref name="PleaLean" /&gt; Enhanced user convenience and functionality supposedly justify the increased size of software, but Wirth argues that people are increasingly misinterpreting complexity as sophistication, that "these details are cute but not essential, and they have a hidden cost".&lt;ref name="PleaLean" /&gt; As a result, he calls for the creation of "leaner" software, and pioneered the development of [[Oberon (operating system)|Oberon]], a software system developed between 1986 and 1989 based on nothing but hardware. Its primary goal was to show that software can be developed with a fraction of the memory capacity and processor power usually required, without sacrificing flexibility, functionality, or user convenience.&lt;ref name="PleaLean" /&gt;

The law was restated in 2009 and attributed to [[Larry Page]], founder of [[Google]]. It has been referred to as Page's law.&lt;ref name=pagelaw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developers.slashdot.org/story/09/06/01/1232206/Can-Pages-Law-Be-Broken?from=rss|title= Can "Page's Law" Be Broken?|publisher=[[Slashdot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of that name is attributed to [[Sergey Brin]] at the [[Google I/O]] Conference 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kty5YNOaaw | title = Sergey Brin On Breaking "Page's Law" Of Software Sluggishness |date=2009-05-27|publisher=YouTube| accessdate = 2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other common forms use the names of the leading hardware and software companies of the 1990s ([[Intel]] &amp; [[Microsoft]]), or their CEOs ([[Andy Grove]] &amp; [[Bill Gates]]): "What Intel giveth, Microsoft taketh away"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.osnews.com/story/18931/_What_Intel_Giveth_Microsoft_Taketh_Away_ | title=What Intel giveth, Microsoft taketh away |date=2007-11-15|publisher=OSNews|accessdate=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "What Andy giveth, Bill taketh away".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.forbes.com/2005/04/19/cz_rk_0419karlgaard.html | title=Ten Laws Of The Modern World |date=2005-04-19|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates's law ("The speed of software halves every 18 months"&lt;ref name=gateslaw&gt;[http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/G/Gatess-Law.html Gates' law], from the Jargon Lexicon, in the Jargon File (version 4.4.7).&lt;/ref&gt;) is a variant on Wirth's law, borrowing its name from [[Bill Gates]],&lt;ref name=gateslaw /&gt; co-founder of [[Microsoft]]. It is an observation that the speed of commercial software generally slows by 50% every 18 months, thereby negating all the benefits of [[Moore's law]]. This could occur for a variety of reasons: "[[featuritis]]", "[[cruft|code cruft]]", developer laziness, or a management turnover whose design philosophy does not coincide with the previous manager.&lt;ref&gt;Orion, Egan (March 21, 2003).

May's law, named after [[David May (computer scientist)|David May]], is a variant stating: "Software efficiency halves every 18 months, compensating [[Moore's law]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eadline|first=Douglas|title=May’s Law and Parallel Software|url=http://www.linux-mag.com/id/8422/|publisher=Linux Magazine|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
