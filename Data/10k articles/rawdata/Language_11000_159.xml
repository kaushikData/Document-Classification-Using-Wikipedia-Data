The Beni Snous had no trouble conversing with their Berber-speaking neighbours among the [[Beni Bou Said]] just to the west, and (with some difficulty) could communicate in Berber with people from [[Figuig]], [[Beni Iznacen]], and the [[Zekkara]], across the border in Morocco.  However, they found [[Tashelhiyt language|Tashelhiyt]] (in southern Morocco) and [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]] (in central Algeria) almost unintelligible.

Today, only a few elderly people in the region still speak Berber. Most of the Beni Snous have shifted to Arabic, retaining only a few words from their ancestral language, such as ''tabɣa'' "blackberries" or ''azduz'' "pestle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Souag | first1 = Lameen | last2 = Kherbache | first2 = Fatma | title = Syntactically conditioned code-switching?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7548">The first complete Catalan Bible translation was produced by the [[Catholic Church]], between 1287 and 1290. It was entrusted to Jaume de Montjuich by [[Alfonso II of Aragon]]. Remains of this version can be found in Paris (''Bibliothèque Nationale'').

In the early fifteenth century, the Bible was translated into Catalan again by [[Bonifaci Ferrer]]. Ferrer's translation, known as  the [[Valencian Bible]], was printed in 1478 before any Bible was printed in English or Spanish.
&lt;ref&gt;Tirant lo Blanc: new approaches p113  Arthur Terry - 1999  On 12 April 1483, Daniel Vives told the inquisitors how two translators ' undertook to emend a copy of a Bible written en vulgar limosi (that is, 'Old Catalan') . . . but had a difficult time changing those Limousin words into Valencian'&lt;/ref&gt; The prohibition, in Spain and other Catholic countries, of vernacular translations, along with the decline of the Catalan language until its renaissance in the nineteenth century, explains why there were no translations into Catalan from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="numtrans"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Bible in the Renaissance - William Tyndale| publisher=Dom Henry Wansbrough | url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sben0056/Tyndale.London.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832 a Catalan exile in London, [[Josep Melcior Prat i Colom]], sponsored by the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]], translated the New Testament , which was published afterwards in 1836 in Barcelona and again in 1888 in Madrid as the (''Lo Nou Testament de nostre Senyor Jesu-Christ'').&lt;ref&gt;Obres de Jordi Rubió i Balaguer: Il·lustració i Renaixença 1989 49 "El Dr. Olives nos confirma indiscutiblemente que fue obra del gran amigo de Bergnes, José Melchor Prat Colom.

==List of Bible Translators==
{{main|List of Bible translations}}
*[[Josep Melcior Prat i Colom]] (1779-1855)
*[[Joan Roís de Corella]], 15th century psalter
*[[Bonifaci Ferrer]] (Valencia 1350-1417), 1478
*[[Jaume de Montjuich]], 13th century
*[[Pau and Samuel Sais]], 2000

==20th century to present==
In the twentieth century many new translations emerged, both Catholic and Protestant.

===Catholic translations===
*1915-1925   Unfinished translation by [[Frederic Clascar]] (Barcelona: Institut d'Estudis Catalans): only ''Genesis'' (1915), ''Song of Songs'' (1918) and ''Exodus'' (1925)
*1928-1929  ''El Nou Testament'' (Barcelona: Foment de Pietat Catalana)
*1928-1948 ''La Sagrada Bíblia'', by Fundació Bíblica Catalana (Barcelona: Alpha); started in 1927 (published in 15 individual volumes, also known as "Bíblia de Cambó", as it was funded by [[Francesc Cambó]]). There are several translators, among them: [[Carles Riba]], [[Carles Cardó]] or [[Josep Maria Millàs i Vallicrosa]].
*1926-1987 ''La Bíblia: versió dels textos originals i notes pels Monjos de Montserrat'': by the Monks of Montserrat, in 28 volumes. Other editions based on it have been published, in one volume and with some textual variations{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}
*1968 ''La Sagrada Bíblia, 2nd Edition'': a new translation in one volume, reprinted some times by Fundació Bíblica Catalana. It is a different translation from the 1928-1948 version from the same publisher.
*1980 ''Nou Testament'' (Barcelona: Claret), by Jaume Sidera i Plana

===Protestant translations===
*1988 ''Nou Testament'': the New Testament, by the Institució Bíblica Evangèlica de Catalunya, with the help of the [[International Bible Society]]
*2000 ''La Bíblia: la Sagrada Escriptura en llengua catalana''; also ''La Bíblia del 2000''or ''Bíblia Evangèlica Catalana'' (BEC), translated by Pau Sais and Samuel Sais ([Barcelona]: Institució Bíblica Evangèlica de Catalunya), with some editions
*2009 ''La Santa bíblia o les Santes Escriptures'' (London: Trinitarian Bible Society), from the Massoretic text

===Ecumenical translation===
For the Ecumenical translation, Catholic and Protestant translators worked together. However, two separate translations of the Bible still emerged- the Catholic edition included [[deuterocanonical]] texts, while the Protestant edition did not.

*1993 ''Bíblia Catalana Interconfessional'' (BCI), by Associació Bíblica de Catalunya, Editorial Claret, and Societats Bíbliques Unides, with some reprints.
*2004 ''Evangelis: de Marc, Mateu, Lluc i Joan, amb els fets dels Apòstols, la Carta de Pau als romans i el LLibre de L'Apocalipsi'' (Barcelona: Proa), translated by Joan F. Mira in a literary and philological way, religiously neutral.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3983">'''Bogon filtering''' is the practice of filtering '''bogons,''' which are bogus (fake) [[IP address]]es of a [[computer network]]. Bogons include [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[packet (information technology)|packets]] on the public [[Internet]] that contain addresses that are not in any range allocated or delegated by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) or a delegated [[Regional Internet Registry|regional Internet registry]] (RIR) and allowed for public internet use. The areas of unallocated address space are called the '''bogon space'''.

Bogons also include reserved private address&lt;ref name=rfc1918 /&gt; and [[link-local address]] ranges, such as those in {{IPaddr|10.0.0.0|8}}, {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|12}}, {{IPaddr|192.168.0.0|16}}, and {{IPaddr|169.254.0.0|16}}, which are reserved for [[Private Network-to-Network Interface|private networks]],&lt;ref name=rfc1918&gt;{{Cite IETF|rfc=1918|bcp=5|title=Address Allocation for Private Internets|author1=Y. Rekhter|author2=B. Moskowitz|author3=D. Karrenberg|author4=G. J. de Groot|author5=E. Lear|date=February 1996|publisher=Network Working Group}} Updated by RFC 6761.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes also known as [[Martian packet]]s.

Many [[Internet service provider|ISP]]s and end-user [[Firewall (networking)|firewall]]s filter and block bogons, because they have no legitimate use, and usually are the result of accidental or malicious misconfiguration. Bogons can be filtered by using [[router (computing)|router]] [[Access Control List|access control list]]s (ACLs), or by [[BGP]] [[Black hole (networking)|blackholing]].

IP addresses that are currently in the bogon space may not be bogons at a later date because IANA and other registries frequently assign new address space to ISPs. Announcements of new assignments are often published on [[Computer network|network]] operators' [[mailing list]]s (such as [[NANOG (computing)|NANOG]]) to ensure that operators have a chance to remove bogon filtering for addresses that have become legitimate.

For example, addresses in {{IPaddr|49.0.0.0|8}} were not allocated prior to August 2010, but are now used by [[APNIC]].&lt;ref name=address&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space/ |title=IANA IPv4 Address Space Registry |accessdate=2010-03-18 |date=2010-02-22 |publisher=[[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; As time goes on, the [[IPv4 address exhaustion]] will mean there are fewer and fewer IPv4 bogons.

IANA maintains a list of allocated and reserved IPv4 netblocks.&lt;ref name=address /&gt;

{{As of|2011|11}}, the IETF recommends that [[IPv4 address exhaustion|since there are no longer any unallocated IPv4 {{IPaddr||8}}s]], bogon filters based on registration status should be removed.&lt;ref name=rfc6441&gt;{{Cite IETF|rfc=6441|bcp=171|title=Time to Remove Filters for Previously Unallocated IPv4 /8s|author=L. Vegoda|publisher=[[IETF]]|date=November 2011|issn=2070-1721}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, bogon filters still need to check for [[Martian packet|Martians]].

==Etymology==
The term ''bogon'' stems from [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] [[jargon]], where it is defined as the [[quantum]] of ''bogosity'', or the property of being bogus. A bogon packet is frequently bogus both in the conventional sense of being forged for illegitimate purposes, and in the [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hackish]] sense of being incorrect, absurd, and useless.

[[File:Nefrolit.jpg|thumb|An 8-mm [[kidney stone]]]]

A '''calculus''' (plural '''calculi'''), often called a '''stone''', is a [[concretion]] of material, usually [[mineral]] salts, that forms in an organ or duct of the body. Formation of calculi is known as '''lithiasis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ɪ|ˈ|θ|aɪ|ə|s|ᵻ|s}}). Stones can cause a number of medical conditions.

Some common principles (below) apply to stones at any location, but for specifics see the particular stone type in question.

Calculi are not to be confused with [[gastrolith]]s.

==Types==
[[File:Human gallstones 2015 G1.jpg|thumbnail|Human gallstones, all removed in one patient. Grid scale 1 mm]]
*Calculi in the [[urinary system]] are called [[urolithiasis|urinary calculi]] and include [[kidney stone]]s (also called renal calculi or nephroliths) and [[bladder stone]]s (also called vesical calculi or cystoliths). They can have any of several compositions, including mixed. Principal compositions include [[oxalate]] and [[urate]].
*Calculi of the [[gallbladder]] and [[bile duct]]s are called [[gallstone]]s and are primarily developed from [[bile acid|bile salts]] and [[cholesterol]] derivatives. 
*Calculi in the nasal passages ([[rhinolith]]s) are rare.
*Calculi in the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] ([[enterolith]]s) can be enormous. Individual enteroliths weighing many pounds have been reported in horses.
*Calculi in the [[stomach]] are called gastric calculi ([[gastrolith]]s).
*Calculi in the [[salivary gland]]s are called salivary calculi ([[sialolithiasis|sialoliths]]).
*Calculi in the [[tonsil]]s are called tonsillar calculi ([[tonsillolith]]s).
*Calculi in the [[vein]]s are called venous calculi ([[phlebolith]]s).
*Calculi in the skin, such as in [[sweat gland]]s, are not common but occasionally occur. 

Calculi are usually asymptomatic, and large calculi may have required many years to grow to their large size.

==Cause==
* From an underlying abnormal excess of the mineral, e.g., with elevated levels of [[calcium]] ([[hypercalcaemia]]) that may cause [[kidney stone]]s, dietary factors for [[gallstone]]s.
* Local conditions at the site in question that promote their formation, e.g., local bacteria action (in kidney stones) or slower fluid flow rates, a possible explanation of the majority of [[salivary duct calculus]] occurring in the [[submandibular gland|submandibular]] [[salivary gland]].
* [[Enterolith]]s are a type of calculus found in the [[intestine]]s of [[animal]]s (mostly [[ruminant]]s) and [[human]]s, and may be composed of [[inorganic]] or [[Biotic material|organic]] constituents.
* [[Bezoar]]s are lumps of indigestible material in the [[stomach]] and/or intestines; most commonly, they consist of hair (in which case they are also known as [[hairball]]s). A bezoar may form the nidus of an enterolith.

In [[kidney stones]], [[calcium oxalate]] is the most common mineral type (see [[Nephrolithiasis]]). [[Uric acid]] is the second most common mineral type, but an ''[[in vitro]]'' study showed uric acid stones and crystals can promote the formation of calcium oxalate stones.&lt;ref name="pmid17366099"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Grases F. |author2=Sanchis P. |author3=Isern B. |author4=Perelló J. |author5=Costa-Bauzá A. | title = Uric Acid as Inducer of Calcium Oxalate Crystal Development| journal = Scandinavian Journal of Urology and Nephrology| volume = 41| issue = 1| pages = 26–31| year = 2007| pmid = 17366099| doi = 10.1080/00365590600831571| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology and symptoms==
Stones can cause disease by several mechanisms:
*Irritation of nearby tissues, causing pain, swelling, and inflammation
*Obstruction of an opening or duct, interfering with normal flow and disrupting the function of the organ in question
*Predisposition to infection (often due to disruption of normal flow)

A number of important medical conditions are caused by stones:
*[[Nephrolithiasis]] ([[kidney]] stones)
**Can cause [[hydronephrosis]] (swollen kidneys) and [[renal failure]]
**Can predispose to [[pyelonephritis]] (kidney infections)
**Can progress to [[urolithiasis]]
*[[Urolithiasis]] ([[urinary bladder]] stones)
**Can progress to [[bladder outlet obstruction]]
*[[Cholelithiasis]] (gallstones)
**Can predispose to [[cholecystitis]] ([[gall bladder]] infections) and [[ascending cholangitis]] ([[biliary tree]] infection)
**Can progress to [[choledocholithiasis]] (gallstones in the bile duct) and [[gallstone pancreatitis]] (inflammation of the [[pancreas]])
*Gastric calculi can cause colic, obstruction, torsion, and necrosis.

==Diagnosis==
[[Diagnostic workup]] varies by the stone type, but in general:
*Clinical history and physical examination
*Imaging studies
**Some stone types (mainly those with substantial calcium content) can be detected on [[X-ray]] and [[CT scan]]
**Many stone types can be detected by [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]]
*Factors contributing to stone formation (as in [[#Etiology]]) are often tested:
**[[Medical laboratory|Laboratory]] testing can give levels of relevant substances in blood or urine
**Some stones can be directly recovered (at surgery, or when they leave the body spontaneously) and sent to a laboratory for analysis of content

==Treatment==
Modification of predisposing factors can sometimes slow or reverse stone formation. Treatment varies by stone type, but, in general:
**Medication
**Surgery ([[lithotomy]])
*Antibiotics and/or surgery for infections
*Medication
*[[Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy]] (ESWL) for removal of calculi

==History==
The earliest operation for curing stones is given in the ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'' (6th century BCE).&lt;ref name=Lock836/&gt; The operation involved exposure and going up through the floor of the bladder.&lt;ref name=Lock836&gt;Lock, Stephen etc. (2001). ''The Oxford Illustrated Companion to Medicine''. USA: Oxford University Press. 836. {{ISBN|0-19-262950-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The care of this disease was forbidden to the [[physicians]] that had taken the [[Hippocratic Oath]]{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} because
* There was a high probability of intraoperative and postoperative surgical complication like infection or bleeding
* The physicians would not perform surgery as in ancient cultures they were two different professions

[[File:Carton Flow Lanes.jpg|thumb|right|Carton flow rack]]

'''Carton flow''' is a form of shelving that uses a [[gravity feed]] rear-load design. Each unit consists of one or more inclined runways. Merchandise is loaded in the rear of each runway. As an item is removed from the front, the item directly behind it slides forward in place of the previous.

The main advantage of carton flow rack over static rack or shelving systems is that merchandise remains better organized and easier to find or pick. With carton flow rack, the product is automatically rotated on a first-in, first-out basis. Merchandise is stocked in the rear of the carton flow rack and moves toward the picking station in front on an inclined shelf equipped with specially designed roller track. When a carton is removed from the picking station, the next one in line rolls to the front. Carton flow always keeps items within reach. Inventory is easier to monitor and control since products are fully visible at all times. A limitation worth mentioning is that carton flows are not well suited for larger volume or full case applications. &lt;ref&gt;[https://advancestorageproducts.com/flow-systems-types/carton-flow Carton Flow]&lt;/ref&gt;
Restocking and picking typically offer the greatest opportunity for improving efficiency within order-picking operations. With carton flow rack systems, labor savings of up to 75% can be realized almost immediately. Because items are picked from the front and stocked from the rear, both functions can be performed without interference and with minimized travel.

In a static storage system such as standard [[shelving]], stockers and pickers often do a lot of unnecessary travel.

== History ==

Lansing Peter Shield, President of [[Grand Union (stores)|Grand Union Co.]], applied for patents for the original gravity-feed rear-load design using Unistrut and [[Nylon]] strips in 1945 (later approved in 1948). The unit consisted of several inclined runways. The device was driven by gravity. A stockman would place merchandise in the rear of each runway and, as a shopper selected an item, the item behind it would slide forward in place of the previous one.

Grand Union formed a company called Food-O-Mat to sell the carton flow system, and made Gardner Hinckley the president. [http://www.gauermetal.com/carton-flow-rack/ Gauer Metal Products, Inc] manufactured the carton flow units for Grand Union/Food-O-Mat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gauermetal.com/about/|title = About Gauer Flo-Rack Carton Flow Systems|date = |accessdate = |website = Gauer Metal Products, Inc.|publisher = Gauer Metal|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Lansing Shield died of a heart attack, Thomas Butler was appointed the new president. Butler had no interest in continuing to use carton flow units in Grand Union supermarkets, so Food-O-Mat went off on its own to sell the product with Gauer Metal Products as its manufacturer.

== Carton flow today ==

The carton flow design has gone through countless changes over the years, and has now evolved to full shelving units. These units consist of [[polyethylene]] or aluminum roller runways and can be stand-alone racks or can be installed into pallet racks. [[Conveyor]] systems are sometimes used as an alternative option to carton flow shelving.

[[File:Vasa beakhead1.jpg|thumb|The 17th century warship [[Vasa (ship)|Vasa]] with cathead visible upper middle right.]]
A '''cathead''' is a large wooden beam located on either side of the bow of a sailing ship, and angled forward at roughly 45 degrees. The beam is used to support the ship's [[anchor]] when raising it (weighing anchor) or lowering it (letting go), and for carrying the anchor on its [[stock-end]] when suspended outside the ship's side.  It is furnished with [[sheave]]s at the outer end, and the inner end (which is called the [[cat's-tail]]) fits down on the [[cat-beam]].  The [[cat stopper]] also fastens the anchor on. The purpose of the cathead is to provide both a heavy enough beam to support the massive weight of the anchor, and to hold the metal anchor away from the wooden side of the ship to prevent damage.

In common practice, the projecting end of the beam was carved to resemble the face of a lion or cat. Whether such carving was due to a play on the already existing name of the beam or whether the beam was so named because of the practice of such carving is unknown.

The origin of the term "cathead" is obscure, but dates at least to the 17th century used by ''mainwaring'' and ''boteler'' in their dictionaries.

In Robert Charles Leslie's ''Old Sea Wings, Ways and Words in the Days of Oak and Hemp'' (1890), page 154 he writes: "The term catheads used for the two stout projecting timbers on either bow, from which the anchor hung clear of the ship before letting go, was no doubt connected with the fact of a lion or large cat usually carved upon the end of the item."
[[File:James_Craig_cathead.JPG|thumb|Cathead on bow of the barque [[James Craig (barque)|James Craig]]]]

== Additional nautical use of  the term ==

A second "cat head" was associated with a ship's anchor-cable and [[windlass]]. This was a square pin thrust into one of the handspike holes of a ship's windlass. When at anchor, the anchor rope (called a cable or [[wikt:catfall#English|catfall]]) was secured to this with a smaller rope tie called a [[seizing]]. The English term for this pin was 'Norman'. In German, however, it was called a ''Kattenkopf'' (cat-head), and in this case it is a reference to the traditional way the top was notched and chamfered off so that in cross section, it resembled the ears of a cat.

After his retirement, Kambara was nominated as the Member of [[Vidhan Parishad|Karnataka Legislative Council]], to which he made significant contributions through his interventions.&lt;ref name="dhbard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/195008/living-bard.html |title=The living bard |work=Deccan Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Chandrashekhara Kambara was born in [[Ghodageri]], a village in [[Belgaum district]] of [[Bombay Presidency]] (today in [[Karnataka]]). He was the third son in the family, with brothers Parasappa and Yallappa who still reside in the small house belonging to the Kambara family in the village.&lt;ref name="times1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-09-20/bangalore/30179268_1_gokak-yallappa-village |title=Home village Ghodageri erupts in celebration|work=The Times of India|date=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an early age, Kambara was interested in folk arts, local culture and ritual.&lt;ref name="deccan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/192178/a-true-grass-roots-level.html |title=Jnanpith award: Deccan Herald – Kambar realised the universal in indigenous, native culture in modern times |work=Deccan Herald |date=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His favorite Kannada writers include [[Kumara Vyasa]], [[Basava]], [[Kuvempu]] and [[Gopalakrishna Adiga]] and among English writers, it is [[W.

Popularly known as ''Shivapur Kambar Master'' in his native district, Kambara had his schooling in [[Gokak]] and returned to Belagavi for higher education at Lingaraj College.

==Career==
After a brief stint in teaching in the [[University of Chicago]], he taught in [[Bangalore University]] for over two decades and was a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright scholar]].&lt;ref name="deccan" /&gt;

He has been elected as the chairman of Sahitya Academny on 12 February 2018.

He served as the chairman of [[National School of Drama|National School of Drama Society]], New Delhi from 1996 to 2000 and as the president of Karnataka Nataka Academy from 1980 to 1983. He started using north Karnataka [[dialect]] of Kannada in his poems and plays which is not very common in [[Kannada literature]].

Kambara is the founder vice-chancellor of the [[Kannada University]] at [[Hampi]]. His grand vision of Kannada literature and Karnataka culture is reflected in the way he showed commitment to build it. The architecture, the choice of the subjects that cover the diverse variety of culture and society of Karnataka, selection of place, faculty or academic activities, the scholars whom he drafted from different parts of the state and the Nadoja honorary award instead of the [[Doctorate|honorary doctorate]] which he introduced, show Kambara's native vision which was evolved in his literary works for decades.&lt;ref name="hindushiv" /&gt;

As the first vice-chancellor of the University, Kambara served two terms of three years each, during which he could shape it in a unique manner, compared to other traditional universities. All the constructions during his tenure as the vice-chancellor are on hillocks, with huge stone structures resembling the [[Vijayanagara architecture|Vijayanagara period architecture]]. He also created a separate publication unit for publishing the results of research and project works going on in Kannada University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A Murigeppa  |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-09-21/bangalore/30183739_1_folk-modern-poetry-guest-house |title=Times of India – Kannada varsity has Kambar stamp all over |work=The Times of India |date=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a strong supporter of imparting school education with [[Kannada|Kannada language]] as the [[medium of instruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/cities/bengaluru/nationalise-school-level-education-says-kambara-944 |title=Nationalise school-level education, says Kambara |work=Deccan Chronicle }}&lt;/ref&gt; His justification for this stance is that only [[First language|mother tongue]] can provide an "[[experience]]," which is an integral part of learning and learning through any other language only gives people "information," which makes them less competent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/193239/kambar-bats-kannada-schools.html#top |title=Kambar bats for Kannada in schools |work=Deccan Herald |date=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concurs with [[UNESCO]]'s recommendation that "providing education in a child's mother tongue is a critical issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0015/001540/154007e.pdf |title=Results of the 7th consultation of member states on the implementation of the Convention and Recommendation against discrimination in education (Para. 41) |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was conferred with the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] in 1991 for another popular play ''Sirisampige''.&lt;ref name="jnan1" /&gt;

He was a pioneer in introducing [[Bailahongal]]'s famous ''Sangya Balya'' ([[bayalata]]) and ''Jokumaraswamy,'' a traditional ritual of his native district, to the literary world&lt;ref name="deccan" /&gt; which have seen thousands of performances, not only in Kannada, but several other [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] as well.&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite web|author=Special Correspondent |url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/books/article2468374.ece |title=Jnanpith for Kambar |work=The Hindu |date=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most recent novel, ''Shikhar Soorya'', is rated among the best Kannada novels.&lt;ref name="ibn" /&gt;

Many of his works have been [[Translated#Literary translation|translated]] to English and several other Indian languages. The play ''Jokumaraswamy'' has been translated to English (Seagull Books, Calcutta in 1989), [[Marathi language|Marathi]] (Abholi Prakashan, Solhapur in 2000), [[Hindi]] (Vidya Prakashan Mandir, New Delhi in 1985), [[Telugu language|Telugu]] (Mudrika Printers, Kurnool in 1993), [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and Malayalam among others.

==Themes==
In his lengthy [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]] ''Helatena Kela'' ("Listen, I will tell you") in the early 1960s, Kambara introduced some of the recurring [[Theme (literature)|themes]] which he would often return to in his later works. Themes of tradition and modernity, [[Feudalism|crises of feudalism]], [[Indigenous peoples|native identities]], [[colonialism]], march of history, sex, loss of faith, the [[God is dead|death of God]] and several related themes explored later in his plays, novels and poetry had found metaphorical expression in the narrative poem.&lt;ref name="hindushiv" /&gt; The eponymous, long narrative poem has the musicality and rhythm of the [[Lavani]] form and uses rich earthy imagery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontline.in/stories/20111104282209000.htm Frontline Magazine – Modern myth-maker] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shivapura'' is an imaginary [[utopian]] village which continues to be a character, a [[metaphor]] and the locale in most of his works. It forms the locus of his poems and tales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-09-21/bangalore/30183724_1_banyan-tree-arcadian-remedios |title=Times of India – Shivapur, his magical world |work=The Times of India |date=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his characterisation, [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] visit the place and bless the villagers.

[[Saint]] '''Colmán of Cloyne''' (530 &amp;ndash; 606), also '''Colmán mac Léníne''', was a monk, founder and patron of Cluain Uama, now [[Cloyne]], [[County Cork]], [[Ireland]], and one of the earliest known Irish poets to write in the vernacular.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Johnston, "Munster, saints of (act. ''c''.450–c.700)."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
No hagiographical ''Life'' is known to have been written for Colmán, but various aspects of his life are presented in different types of sources, such as [[Irish annals]], genealogies and martyrologies. An early origin tale known as ''[[Conall Corc and the Corco Loígde]]'', which survives only as part of the Irish genealogical tract in MS Laud 610, includes a few brief notes on the saint. This text was probably written at St Colmán's foundation of Cloyne and though it cannot be precisely dated, a rough approximate of ''c''. 700 or earlier has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Corráin, "Creating the past"; Charles-Edwards, ''Early Christian Ireland'', pp. 522-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
&lt;!--
* Colman of Cloyne was born in [[Munster]]. His birthday is said to have been 15 October and the year is believed to have been 522
Colman is associated with those resident in the area immediately north of Emly or, in the opinion of the editors of the ''Liturgical Calendar for Ireland 2006'' (&lt;code&gt;ISBN 1-85390-991-2&lt;/code&gt;), it is more probable that he came from west Cork.
* He was the son of Leinin, who according to the [[Book of Leinster]] was ninth in descent from Mogh Nuadat, King of Munster in 166. He was attached to the Cattraige, a people recorded in the earliest sources in several Irish provinces, who claimed exalted descent, but who appear as one among a group of peoples in a subservient role to the Kings of Cashel (Munster).
--&gt;
&lt;!--Note to self (Cavila): substitute refs to Ó Corráin, "Creating" for refs to his article in ''Peritia''--&gt;

Irish genealogies generally agree that Colmán had a father called Lénín. Through his father, Colmán appears to have been descended from the [[Rothrige]], an obscure people who are known elsewhere as a subject people of the [[Déisi]] of Munster.&lt;ref name=Creating&gt;Corráin, "Creating the past"&lt;/ref&gt; Irish genealogies, however, go some way to associating Colmán's lineage with the [[Éoganachta]], the leading ruling dynasty in Munster. One early item of genealogical information, which specifically identifies the Mac Léníni and Mac Duinich as sub-branches of the Rothrige (though it does not name Colmán), achieves this by making their eponymous progenitor Eochaid Rothán a son of the Éoganacht ancestor [[Mug Nuadat]].&lt;ref name=Creating /&gt; The saint's genealogies later come to trace Colmán's ancestry to Mug Nuadat through seven generations.&lt;ref name=Creating /&gt; This prominence accorded to the Éoganachta in the genealogies is to be seen in the light of Colmán's monastic career and the position of Cloyne after his death (see below).

The text ''Conall Corc and the Corco Loígde'' includes a brief triad in which Colmán is named as one of the three "ex-laymen" (''athláich'') of Ireland, along with Énna of Aran and Móchammac of Inis Celtra (though it also adds a fourth, Bishop Erc in Sláne of Mag Breg).&lt;ref name="Corco Loígde p. 900"&gt;''Conall Corc and the Corco Loígde'', tr. Hull, p. 900.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word ''athláech'' here has been taken to suggest that Colmán became a cleric at a somewhat later age than was usual at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DIL |title=athláech |pages=Letter A, Column 458}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CC&gt;Busse, "Colmán mac Lénéni"&lt;/ref&gt; Later tradition claims that it was the Connacht saint [[Brendan of Clonfert]] who finally persuaded him to do so.&lt;ref name=CC /&gt;

==Cloyne==
Colmán is remembered as the founder of the monastery at Cluain Uama, now Cloyne (Co. Cork, Ireland), in Munster, which lay in the kingdom of the [[Uí Liatháin]] and the Uí Meic Caille, a sept of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Charles-Edwards, ''Early christian Ireland'', p. 536, note 45, and 547-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The origin legend ''Conall Corc and the Corco Loígde'' claims that the land for the foundation was not given by the local king, but by [[Coirpre Cromm mac Crimthainn|Coirpre (Crom) mac Crimthainn]] (d. ''c''. 580), who was king of Munster from the [[Eóganacht Glendamnach]]:&lt;ref&gt;The Eóganacht Glendamnach were a branch claiming descent from [[Nad Froích]], as did the Eóganacht of Cashel and  the Éoganacht Áine.&lt;/ref&gt;
:Coirpre mac Crimthainn it was who gave Cloyne to God and to Colman mac Colcon who is also called Mac Lénéne and Aired Cechtraige and Cell Náile. Because of this they [the Eoganacht Glendamnach] are entitled to secular rule.&lt;ref name=Creating /&gt;
Aired Cechtraige has been identified as the later parish of [[Erry]] in the barony of [[Middlethird]], and Cell Náile as that of [[Killenaule]], in the [[Ardagh (barony)|barony of Ardagh]], both in the diocese of Cashel.&lt;ref name=Creating /&gt;

The same text alludes to Colmán's conflicts with other rulers. Colmán and his brothers are said at one time to have been expelled from ''Maethalach'' by Máel Umai, the son of Coirpre's brother Fiachna Onchind; for this reason, his descendants were forever excluded from royal rule.&lt;ref name=Creating /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Conall Corc and the Corco Loígde'', tr. Hull, p. 903.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the text, Colmán is also said to have uttered a curse (''maledictio'') which brought down the walls of the city of Ress or [[Ressad]].&lt;ref name="Corco Loígde p. 900"/&gt; According to Paul MacCotter, Ress(ad) appears to be "an archaic name for [[Uí Chairpre]] or one of its divisions",&lt;ref&gt;MacCotter, ''Medieval Ireland'', p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; the Uí Chairpre being a prominent sept of the [[Uí Fidgenti]] in Co. Limerick.

Cloyne appears to have been his earliest settlement. The cathedral and [[Cloyne Round Tower|round tower]] are situated on a limestone eminence in the midst of the valley, surrounded by rich meadows. In the rock is the cave extending in various branches underground to a great distance, from which the town derives its name. Here it is supposed Colman took up his abode as a place of security and the remains of his primitive oratory, known as Colman's Chapel were still to be seen in 1813. Colmán is also believed to have founded a monastery at what would become [[Killagha Abbey]] in [[County Kerry]].&lt;ref&gt;James Carmody, 'The Abbey of Killagha, Parish of Kilcoleman, County Kerry', ''The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland'', Fifth Series, Vol. 36, No. 3, 285&lt;/ref&gt;

Further details of his life are not documented in writing but the connection of many places in counties [[County Cork|Cork]] and [[Limerick]] with his name to this day proves the reality of his labours. The tenth-century Triads describes Cloyne as an important law school.

==Poet==
He was credited with extraordinary poetic powers, being styled by his contemporaries 'royal poet of Munster'. Several of his Irish poems are still extant, notably a metrical panegyric on [[Saint Brendan]]. Colgan mentions a metrical life of [[Saint Senan]] by him.

It is unclear whether he was brought up as a Christian, but what is sure is that he was educated and became a [[bard]] or ''file'', which required a special education - (in order to reach the highest level of ''file'' 12 years of study were required.) As a member of the class of ''filí'', he became attached to the court of [[Cashel, Tipperary|Cashel]] where he remained until about the age of 48 years. In 570 he and [[Saint Brendan]] of [[Clonfert]] were said to have settled a dispute between rivals to the throne of Cashel and Aodh Caomh was acknowledged as king - the first Christian king of Cashel. The King was installed by Saint Brendan. During the time of the coronation Colman and some others discovered the lost shrine of Ailbhe of Emly. Brendan said that it was not right that the hands which had held this sacred relic should be defiled henceforth, thus it was that the son of Leinin offered himself to God. Brendan blessed him and gave him the name Colmán, which is a diminutive of Colm. The Gaelic word ''colm'' corresponds to the [[Latin]] ''columba'' (dove).

Colman then went to the school of Saint Iarlaithe of [[Tuam]] and after his studies he is next mentioned as preaching to the heathen population in the east of County Cork. He is described as a "religious and holy presbyter, who afterwards became a famous bishop". The Prince of Déise, in the present County of [[Waterford]], presented his child to Colman for baptism. Colman baptized him Declan and urged his parents to educate him well in his faith. This child became Saint [[Declan]].

Colman was given churches in Erry and Killenaule (4 and 10 miles from Cashel respectively) by [[Coirpre Cromm mac Crimthainn]], King of Munster (Cashel), as well as lands in Cloyne, Co. Cork. It may well be that the lands in Cloyne (Cluain Uama, the lawn of the cave), were conquered lands and to prevent the possibility of reconquest were given to the church. The Cloyne estate was large and contained some of the best land in the area.

After the king's death (c. 580) Colman somehow became involved in factional strife between Coirpre's descendants in which some of them persecuted him while others, the ancestors of the later dominant line, protected him.

===Extant verse===
His surviving verses date from the period 565 and 604, and are among the earliest examples of Irish writing in the Latin alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, ''Oxford Concise Companion to Irish Literature''&lt;/ref&gt; He is commonly thought to have composed ''Luin oc laib'', a poem in praise of [[Domnall mac Muirchertaig]] (d. 566?), king of Tara, and another poem on the death of [[Áed Sláine]] (d. 604), king of the UÍ Néill. The latter poem has not survived complete.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

==Veneration==
He died on 24 November (his subsequent feastday), circa 600, and his probable place of burial is Cloyne, where he may have left a school of poetry in existence. The calendars are unanimous in dating his death on 24 November, now his feast day. Patron Saint of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cloyne|Diocese of Cloyne]] and of its [[Cobh Cathedral|cathedral]] in Cóbh.

A different Saint Colman is also venerated on the same day, as recorded by [[Saint Aengus]] in his "Felire": – Mac Lenine the most excellent With Colman of Duth-chuilleann. Saint Colman lived in a time for which we have very little written history. The received picture of Colman Mac Leinin comes to us from nineteenth and twentieth century Hagiographies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2739">'''Cratylism''' as a [[philosophical theory]] reflects the teachings of the Athenian [[Cratylus]] ({{lang-grc|Κρατύλος}}, also transliterated as Kratylos), fl. mid to late 5th century BCE. Cratylus is more popularly known as [[Socrates]]' antagonist in [[Plato]]'s dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scissors of Meter: Grammetrics and Reading|last=Wesling|first=Donald|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=1999|isbn=0472107151|location=Ann Arbor|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaguely [[exegesis|exegetical]], Cratylism holds that the fluid nature of [[idea]]s, [[word]]s, and [[communication]]s leaves them fundamentally baseless, and possibly unable to support [[logic]] and [[reason]]. It is distinguished from linguisticity by the problematic status of style - that in a natural [[language]], where a perfect connection is found between word and things, variations of style are no longer conceivable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language and the Renewal of Society in Walt Whitman, Laura (Riding) Jackson, and Charles Olson: The American Cratylus|last=Billitteri|first=Carla|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=9781349375240|location=New York|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gérard Genette|Gerard Genette]] divided the theory into primary and secondary Cratylism. The former is said to involve a general attempt to establish a motivated link between the signifier and the signified by inventing emotional values for certain sounds while the latter admits that language has fallen and that the signifier enjoys an arbitrary relation to the signified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Assimilation/generation/resurrection: Contrapuntal Readings in the Poetry of José Lezama Lima|last=Heller|first=Ben|publisher=Bucknell University Press|year=1997|isbn=0838753477|location=Lewisburg|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cratylism reaches similar conclusions about the nature of reality and communication that [[Taoism]] and [[Zen Buddhism]] also confronted: how can a mind in flux, in a flowing world, hold on to any solid "truth" and convey it to another mind?

A fellow-Greek sophist, [[Gorgias]], expressed an equally ironic ''cul de sac'' conclusion about the nature of human [[epistemology|epistemological]] understanding: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Nothing exists. Even if something did exist, nothing can be known about it; and even if something can be known about it, knowledge about it cannot be communicated to others. And, finally, even if it can be communicated, it cannot be understood."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]], ''Greek Philosophy'' (1914), §96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Ilya Zinovyevich Gordon''' ({{lang-ru|Илья Зиновьевич Гордон}}; {{OldStyleDate|15 December|1907|2 December}} in [[Zelenopol]] &amp;ndash; 28 February 1989 in [[Moscow]]), better known as '''Elye Gordon''' ({{lang-yi|אלי גאָרדאָן}}), was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Yiddish]] author. He was born in  [[Zelenopol]], a [[Jewish agricultural colonies in the Russian Empire|Jewish agricultural colony in Russia]] near [[Yekaterinoslav]], now in ([[Ukraine]]), but grew up in an orphanage in Berdyansk. Gordon studied at the [[Yiddish language]] departments (''rabfak'') of the [[Odessa]] Pedagogical Institute, then [[Moscow]] Pedagogical Institute. As a volunteer for the [[Soviet Army|Red Army]] during [[World War II]], Gordon was twice decorated with the [[Order of the Red Banner]]. Wartime themes would also figure in his literary work.

Elye Gordon published stories in almost every [[Soviet Yiddish]] periodical, including ''Yunger Boy-Klang'' ([[Kharkiv|Kharkov]], 1928), ''Der Shtern'' (1933); and ''Heymland'' (Moscow, 1948).&lt;ref name="Leksikon"&gt;"Gordon, Elye" (1958), ''Leksikon fun der nayer yidisher literatur''.&lt;/ref&gt; He debuted in book form in 1930 with two works: a novel, ''Vildgroz'' (Wild grass), and a collection of short stories, ''Af griner erd'' (On the green soil), both published in Moscow.&lt;ref name="Leksikon"/&gt; Over the years he published several more novels and numerous short stories, collected in at least 14 books.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10180">The '''epideictic oratory''', also called '''ceremonial oratory''', or praise-and-blame [[rhetoric]], is one of the three branches, or "species" (eidē), of rhetoric as outlined in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', to be used to praise or blame during ceremonies.

== Origin and pronunciation ==
The term's root has to do with display or show (''deixis''). It is a literary or rhetorical term from the Greek (ἐπιδεικτικός). It is generally pronounced {{IPAc-en|ɛ|p|ᵻ|ˈ|d|aɪ|k|t|ɪ|k}} or {{IPAc-en|ɛ|p|ᵻ|ˈ|d|eɪ|k|t|ɪ|k}}.[http://www.wordreference.com/definition/epideictic] Another English form, now less common, is ''epidictic'' {{IPAc-en|ɛ|p|ᵻ|ˈ|d|ɪ|k|t|ɪ|k}}.

== Characteristics ==
This is rhetoric of ceremony,  commemoration, declamation, demonstration, on the one hand,  and of play, entertainment,  display, including self-display.  It is also the rhetoric used at festivals, the [[Olympic Games|Olympic games]], [[state visit]]s and other formal events like  openings, closings,  anniversaries as well as at births, deaths, or marriages.  Its major subject  is praise and blame, according to  Aristotle in the limited space  he  provides  for it  in the ''Art of  Rhetoric'' (Freese translation).  

This rhetoric deals with  goodness, excellence, nobility, shame,  honor, dishonor,  beauty, and matters  of virtue and vice. The  virtues  or the "components" of  virtue  according to Aristotle,  were "justice, courage, self-control, magnificence, magnanimity, liberality, gentleness, practical and speculative wisdom"  or "reason". Vice  was the "contrary" of virtue. 

In his book ''Rhetoric and Poetics in Antiquity'', Jeffrey Walker claims that epideictic rhetoric predates the rhetoric of courts and politics, the study of which began in the 5th or 4th century BC with the [[Sophists]]. The other two kinds of public speech were deliberative or political speech, and forensic, judicial, or legal speech. Epideictic rhetoric  or style is according to Aristotle most appropriate for material that is written or read. In the ''Art of Rhetoric'', Aristotle stated  that  "The epideictic style is especially suited to written compositions; for its function  is reading." (423){{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Aristotle on epideixis ==
{{main|Rhetoric (Aristotle)}}
Aristotle instructs that in creating a speech of praise or blame, the author should consider the attitude of his audience: Will they be moved to see his object of praise (be it a person or a thing) in a new light, or will he be wasting everyone's time by "preaching to the choir"? What values and behavior does this particular audience find praiseworthy? Whether the audience is sympathetic, hostile, or indifferent to his object of praise or blame determines how difficult the task is that lies before him. As Aristotle reminds the reader, "[F]or as Socrates used to say, it is not difficult to praise Athenians in Athens" (''Rhetoric'',1367b).&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''On Rhetoric'' Trans. by George A. Kennedy. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to [[Aristotle]]’s conception of epideixis, “the present is the most important; for all speakers praise or blame in regard to existing qualities, but they often make use of other things, both reminding [the audience] of the past and projecting the course of the future” (''Rhet.'' 1358b). Epideixis is Aristotle’s least favored and clearly defined topic.  Now considered to be the stuff of ceremonies with its exhortations, [[panegyric]]s, [[encomia]], funeral orations and displays of oratorical prowess, epideictic rhetoric appears to most to be discourse less about depth and more attuned to style without substance. Still, the ''Art of Rhetoric'' is cited as an example of epideictic  work (Lockwood, 1996).

Epideixis may not deserve the charge of lacking depth. The charge that this branch of rhetoric lacks depth can be countered by the recognition that it systematizes the successful attribution of [[value (ethics)|value]] (to things, people, or concepts). Attributing value (whether in terms of "the good" and "the bad" or of "virtue" and "vice") to 1) perception, 2) emotions, 3) thought, 4) action, and 5) goals is the fundamental basis of relativistic conceptions of 1) [[aesthetics]], 2) human [[Sociology of emotions|character]], 3) [[intelligence]], 4) [[ethics]], and 5) [[wisdom]]. For instance, applying epideixis to 'human perceptions' yields [[aesthetics]], and its application to 'human action' yields fundamental relativistic [[ethics]]. Nevertheless, epideixis can always be reduced to simply the study of how best to preach the positive or negative characteristics of creatures, contraptions, concepts (etc.) to an audience. Epideictic rhetoric appeals to - and serves to sway - personal and cultural [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], whereas pure deliberative and judicial rhetoric appeal to reason alone.

And, Lockwood,  also in ''Reader's Figure'',  describes how readers are figured by their readings, and how readers figure their readings, and that readers can accept the readers' account, and forget  their  own account  of their present and past,   and that the rhetor's account is  produced by language.{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}

== Modern authors on epideixis ==
For centuries, epideictic [[Public speaking|oratory]] was a contested term, for it is clearly present in both forensic and deliberative forms, but it is difficult to clarify when it appears as a dominant discursive form. According to [[Chaïm Perelman]] and Lucy Olbrechts-Tyteca, “The speaker engaged in epidictic discourse is very close to being an [[educator]]. Since what he is going to say does not arouse [[controversy]], since no immediate practical interest is ever involved, and there is no question of attacking or defending, but simply of promoting values that are shared in the community . . .” (52).&lt;ref&gt;Chaïm Perelman, Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca, ''The new rhetoric: a treatise on argumentation'', University of Notre Dame Press, 1969, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  
Some of the defining terms for epideictic discourse include declamation, demonstration, praise or blame of the personal, and pleasing or inspiring to an audience.  

Lawrence W. Rosenfield contends that epideictic practice surpasses mere praise and blame, and it is more than a showy display of rhetorical skill: “Epideictic’s understanding calls upon us to join with our community in giving thought to what we witness, and such thoughtful beholding in commemoration constitutes memorializing” (133){{fcn|date=September 2018}}. Epideictic rhetoric also calls for witnessing events, acknowledging temporality and contingency (140).  However, as Rosenfield suspects, it is an uncommon form of [[discourse]] because of the rarity of “its necessary constituents — openness of mind, felt reverence for reality, enthusiasm for life, the ability to congeal significant experiences in memorable language . . .” (150).

The philologist [[Ernst Curtius]] provides an account of its history, and many examples, in ''[[European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages]]''. Praise and blame were "reduced" to praise by  Aristotle, he wrote; and recently another author called it a "blameless genre". He and Lockwood seem to say that what was in the past called rhetoric was later called literature. Curtius believed that misinterpretations  of [[medieval literature]] occur because so much of it is epideictic, and the epideictic is so alien to us today. During the Middle Ages it became a "school subject" as the sites for political activity diminished in the West, and as the centuries went on the word "praise" came to mean that which was written. During this period literature (more specifically histories, biographies, autobiographies, geographies) were called praise(s).

[[Ben Witherington III]], writing from a biblical perspective on sacred exhortation, noted that "in general, epideictic rhetoric is highly emotional and meant to inspire the audience to appreciate something or someone, or at the other end of the spectrum, despise something or someone.  Epideictic rhetoric seeks to charm or, to cast odium." - I &amp; II Thessalonians: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary &lt;ref&gt;Ben Witherington III, I &amp; II Thessalonians: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary - [http://libraryofrhetoric.org/lor/?page_id=90 More Quotes on Epideixis]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In poetry==
Epideictic writing in [[Chinese poetry|poetry]] is often associated with the [[Fu (poetry)|''fu'' rhapsody]] that developed in the early [[Han Dynasty]].  This highly ornamented style was used for almost any subject imaginable, and often incorporated obscure language with extensive cataloguing of rare items, all in verse of varying rhyme and line length.&lt;ref&gt;[[David R. Knechtges]], Wen Xuan: ''or Selections of Refined Literature''. (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984), introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commendatory verse''' is a genre of epideictic writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Quentin Skinner]]|title=Reason and Rhetoric in the Philosophy of Hobbes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wJO9y-sPdLAC&amp;pg=PA57|date=22 February 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-55436-7|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Renaissance and Early Modern European tradition, it was taken to glorify both its author and the person to whom it was addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marina Frasca-Spada|author2=Nicholas Jardine|title=Books and the Sciences in History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XUmhAeUZtbsC&amp;pg=PA121|date=2 November 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-65939-0|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prefatory verses of this kind—i.e. those printed as [[preface]] to a book—became a recognised type of advertising in the book trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ann Bermingham|author2=John Brewer|title=The Consumption of Culture 1600-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-U7bAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148|date=13 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-80840-3|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=October 2011}}

'''Flipping''' is a term used primarily in the [[United States]] to describe purchasing a revenue-generating asset and quickly reselling (or "flipping") it for profit. Though flipping can apply to any asset, the term is most often applied to [[real estate]] and [[initial public offering]]s (IPOs).

The term "flipping" is used by real estate investors to describe "residential redevelopment".  [[Redevelopment]] of distressed or abandoned properties or neighborhoods has sometimes been linked to malicious and unscrupulous acts in the post [[housing bubble]] era. The term "flipping" is frequently used both as a descriptive term for schemes involving [[market manipulation]] and other illegal conduct and as a derogatory term for legal [[real estate investing]] strategies that are perceived by some to be unethical or socially destructive.   In the [[United Kingdom]] the term is used to describe a technique whereby [[Members of Parliament]] were found to be switching their second home between several houses, which had the effect of allowing them to maximize their taxpayer funded allowances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1179291/MPs-expenses-How-Cabinet-ministers-tens-thousands-flipping-homes.html|title=Cabinet ministers have made tens of thousands 'flipping' their homes

==Types==

===Wholesaling and assigning a contract===
Wholesalers make a profit by signing a contract to purchase a property from a seller and then entering into an agreement with a third party to resell the same property at a higher price for a profit. All rights to the original purchase contract are assigned to the new buyer and the new buyer pays an "assignment fee" to the wholesaler in order to gain all rights to purchase the property at the original purchase price.  The original purchase contract usually has an "inspection period" which allows the original buyer to back out of the contract and not close on it if they do not find a buyer to assign their contract to. Many wholesalers have no intention of actually purchasing the property and simply use wholesaling as a tool to locate properties for other investors.

In many cases, if another buyer is not found before the end of the inspection period, the wholesaler cancels the original purchase contract (through its cancellation clause) and gets back the deposit.  Wholesaling requires little or no money to be secured in escrow, and in most cases the wholesaler never intends to actually purchase the property. The practice of wholesaling is often advertised as "No Money Down and No Risk" by many real estate coaching companies and infomercials since the actual deposit can be as little as $10 and often even the deposit can be returned if the wholesaler cancels the contract before the end of the inspection period.

Some people are of the opinion that wholesaling is fraudulent misrepresentation since the wholesaler does not actually intend to close on the property themselves. However, in the United States wholesaling is perfectly legal and most real estate contracts allow the buyer an inspection period and any amount of deposit that buyer and seller agree to. Wholesaling in property is no different from wholesaling in any other industry.

In a successful transaction the seller is often unaware that original buyer is not purchasing the property. In some cases, wholesalers actually purchase the property for cash and then resell the property to their end buyer in a second closing. This practice is considered more costly since the buyer is paying closing costs to purchase the property and to resell the property. However many people consider double closing to be more ethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to perform or structure a Simultaneous Closing - Double Closing - Back to Back Closing?|url=http://www.foreclosureuniversity.com/studycenter/freereports/simultaneous_closings.php|website=foreclosureuniversity.com|publisher=foreclosureuniversity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases where there are substantial profits from reselling it often makes sense for the wholesaler to pay for two closing costs (double closing) to avoid requesting a large assignment fee from their buyer.

===Wholesaling a property multiple times ===
It is not uncommon for a property to be assigned multiple times and for a few wholesalers to make money in a transaction from the seller to the end buyer. The original wholesaler enters into a contract to purchase a property and then assigns or sells their rights to that contract to another investor. That investor then assigns their rights to said contract to a third investor and so forth. In many cases wholesalers work together ensuring that all parties get paid on a transaction. This practice is often frowned upon in the real estate community since it seems unethical or illegal. In practice there is nothing illegal about wholesaling or assigning rights to a purchase contract even if it is multiple times. It is important to understand that the reason there is an opportunity to wholesale is because the original seller is selling the property for substantially less than market value. This usually occurs when either the property or the seller is in distress. Examples of distress could be a property damaged by fire, flood, hurricane or a homeowner that is facing foreclosure and is about to lose their home and is selling it for substantially less than fair market value. The practice of buying real estate at substantially below market value is called Distressed Real Estate Investing or Wholesale Real Estate Investing hence the term "wholesaler".

===Real estate flipping===
Profits from flipping real estate come from either buying low and selling high (often in a rapidly rising market), or buying a house that needs repair and fixing it up before reselling it for a profit ("fix and flip").

Under the "fix and flip" scenario, an investor or flipper will purchase a property at a discount price.  The discount may be because of:
*the property's condition (e.g., the house needs major renovations and/or repairs which the owner either does not want, or cannot afford, to do), or
*the owner(s) needing to sell a property quickly (e.g., relocation, divorce, pending foreclosure).

The investor will then perform necessary renovations and repairs, and attempt to make a profit by selling the house quickly at a higher price.  The "fix and flip" scenario is profitable to investors because the average homebuyer lacks the time and funds to repairs and renovations, so they look for a property that is ready to move into. Also, most traditional mortgage lenders require the home to be habitable with no significant repairs.

===Second home flipping===
In the UK, [[Members of Parliament]] with constituencies outside of London are given an allowance to maintain an extra home in London allowing them to live closer to the [[Houses of Parliament]] during the working week. Certain costs for this second home can be claimed and are thus partly funded by the taxpayer. MPs can nominate any of their other properties as the second home, which has tax advantages for not being their primary residence and can lead to additional allowances.

"Flipping" occurs when the nominated second and primary dwellings are frequently changed, particularly during the parliamentary [[recess (break)|recess]]. The dwelling may in fact be rented out for profit but still receive the allowances.

In some circumstances, MPs can simultaneously declare one home to be both their primary residence (for tax purposes) and their second residence (for expenses purposes).

The practice ended on May 15, 2009 following publication of the [[Disclosure of expenses of Members of the United Kingdom Parliament]] after a public scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5324582/How-the-Telegraph-investigation-exposed-the-MPs-expenses-scandal-day-by-day.html|title=How the Telegraph investigation exposed the MPs' expenses scandal day by day|publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=May 15, 2009| accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Car flipping===
Similar to real estate flipping, car flipping is the process of buying automobiles at a low price and selling such vehicle at a higher price.  A car flipper will identify reasonably priced vehicles that can be sold at a higher price after reconditioning and marketing to a larger market.

In the United States, car flipping can be a hobby for car enthusiasts, or a primary business in the form of state licensed car dealers.  Flipping cars is legal if the vehicles are titled in the person's name or processed through a state licensed dealership. Many states have laws and regulation limiting the number of vehicles a person can flip within each year unless they are a dealer or associate. This number varies from state to state, from 2 to 10. Car flipping has a larger market and requires less investment than flipping real estate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://carflipping.com Car Flipping]{{reliable source|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product flipping===
Outside of real estate and cars, all consumer products can be flipped.   Product flipping entails buying products at a low price and selling it at a higher price for profit.  Products can be new or used items.  Many times, product flippers buy products at dollar stores, thrift stores, garage sales and estate auctions and resell them at a higher price on online marketplaces or locally.  

Compared to real estate flipping and car flipping, product flipping requires much lower capital to get started and thus sellers take on much less risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://flippingincome.com/work-from-home/|title=Work From Home by Starting a Flipping Business - Flipping Income|date=2017-02-28|work=Flipping Income|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to lower profit margins, product flippers often employ various tricks that other kinds of flippers do not have to worry about.  These tricks include utilizing coupons and cash back rebates&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://flippingincome.com/coupon-stacking/|title=Coupon Stacking For More Profit - Flipping Income|date=2017-02-08|work=Flipping Income|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as finding creative ways of saving on shipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://flippingincome.com/reduce-shipping-costs/|title=4 Pro Tips On How To Reduce Shipping Costs - Flipping Income|date=2017-03-25|work=Flipping Income|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Common products that are flipped for profit are clothes, [[Mobile phone|cell phones]], books, and coins.  Other less common products that are flipped are digital in nature such as [[Bitcoin]], websites and gaming accounts.  

==Effects==

===Bubbles===
{{further|United States housing bubble}}
A spate of flipping often creates an [[economic bubble]] which then bursts, such as during the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/features/crashes/crashes4.asp Crashes: The Florida Real Estate Craze]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, relaxed federal borrowing standards (including [[subprime lending]] that allowed a borrower to purchase a home with little or no money down) may have led directly to a boom in demand for houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duca|first1=John|title=Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|url=http://www.federalreservehistory.org/Events/DetailView/55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it was easy to borrow, many investors bought homes as [[property speculation]] with no intent to live in them. Since the demand outstripped the supply, prices rose, giving a short-term profit. This resulted in an [[inflationary spiral]] until the bubble burst in 2008 and borrowing standards became stricter, leaving the housing market to bottom out.

Flipping was so popular in the United States that many [[DIY]] television programs like [[A&amp;E Network]]'s ''[[Flip This House]]'' detailed the process.

Flipping becomes less desirable when interest rates are high and so demand is lower. The resulting lack of sales, and major price cuts, results in a flood of properties on the market at one time, resulting in an excess of supply to demand.

===Rejuvenation and gentrification===
"Rational" flipping can encourage a rejuvenation and restoration of a previously decrepit neighborhood, a process known as [[gentrification]], which increases property values but can cause a [[population shift]].

Under the [[broken windows]] theory, an unkempt house or area attracts a criminal element, which drives out those making a responsible living, which allows for more criminal element, and so on in a spiral. Restoration creates jobs, particularly in construction, and generates more sales (and sales taxes) for local vendors and suppliers. The renovated homes attract new populations and businesses to a region, encouraging more economic development; their higher assessed values brings more [[property tax]] revenue to local governments, allowing for more improvements and more policing.

When flipping occurs frequently in a community, the [[total cost of ownership]] can rise substantially, eventually forcing current residents to relocate, specifically poorer young and old people. On a small scale, flippers can cause distress and disturbance to their immediate neighbors by performing lengthy renovations.  Flippers often have no interest in neighborhood integration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AssemblyPropositions|url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/AssemblyPropositions/2010/46137-26126-21122010.pdf|website=statesassembly.gov.je|publisher=statesassembly.gov.je}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may cause tension with long-term residents.

During the real estate bubble of the 2000s, flipping and gentrification were both linked to the mass migration of people to California, where high real estate prices and ample jobs attracted wealth seekers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In response, many native Californians were forced to migrate to the less expensive areas of states such as Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Oregon and Washington.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}  This migration of Californians caused further gentrification in the areas that they had moved to in large numbers. Areas such as [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and [[Las Vegas Valley]] became much more expensive, although property prices dropped significantly after 2006.

===Property values===
After a renovation, the house itself will be in better condition and last longer, and can be sold at a higher price, thus increasing its property tax assessed value, plus increased sales for goods and services related to property improvement and the related increase in sales taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Put Your Money to Work: Increase Your Wealth by Investing Your Business Assets|url=https://www.allbusiness.com/increase-your-wealth-by-investing-your-business-assets-104644-1.html|website=allbusiness.com|publisher=allbusiness.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbors can also benefit by having more attractive homes in the neighborhood, thereby increasing the value of their own homes.

==Regulations==
&lt;!-- Please re-write this section, citing actual regulations. If someone notable has called for further regulation, cite it. --&gt;
In 2006, the Department of Housing and Urban Development created regulations regarding predatory flipping within Federal Housing Administration (FHA) single-family mortgage insurance.  The time requirement for owning a property was greater than 90 days between purchase and sale dates to qualify for FHA-insured mortgage financing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-IMPACT/2006/June/Day-07/i8844.htm Prohibition of Property Flipping in HUD's Single Family Mortgage Insurance Programs; Additional Exceptions to Time Restriction on Sales | Federal Register Environmental Documents | USEPA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement was greatly relaxed in January 2010, and the 90-day holding period was all but eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.hud.gov/portal/page/portal/HUD/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2010/HUDNo.10-011 HUD Press Release, January 15 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illegal activity==
Flipping can sometimes also be a [[criminal scheme]]. Illegal property flipping is a [[fraud]] whereby recently acquired property is resold for a considerable profit with an artificially inflated value.  The property is quickly resold after making few, or only cosmetic, improvements.  Illegal property flipping often involves collusion between a real estate appraiser, a mortgage originator and a closing agent.  The cooperation of a real estate appraiser is necessary to get a false, artificially inflated, appraisal report.  The buyer may or may not be aware of the situation.  This type of fraud is one of the most costly for lenders.

In the United States, the [[Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice]] (USPAP) governs [[real estate appraisal]]  and [[FNMA|Fannie Mae]], oversees the secondary residential [[mortgage loan]] market. Both have practices to detect illegal flipping schemes.

== In television ==
In July 2012, business network [[CNBC]] green-lit several pilots for [[reality television]] series focusing on house flipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/helaineolen/2012/07/25/cnbc-to-promote-house-flipping/ |title=CNBC to Promote House Flipping |date=July 25, 2012 |work=Helaine Olen |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of several house flipping shows:
*[[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''[[Interior Therapy with Jeff Lewis]]''
*Bravo's ''[[Million Dollar Listing]]'' and ''[[Million Dollar Listing New York]]''
*Bravo's ''[[Flipping Out]]''
*[[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]]'s ''[[The Adam Carolla Project]]''
*TLC and [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Property Ladder (TV series)|Property Ladder]]''

*[[Spike (TV network)|Spike]]'s ''[[Flip Men]]''
*[[DIY Network]]'s ''[[The Vanilla Ice Project]]''
*[[BBC One]]'s ''[[Homes Under the Hammer]]''
Also produced are a number of variations on ''Flipping (city name here)'' e.g. ''[[Flipping Vegas]]'', ''[[Flipping Boston]]'', ''[[Flipping San Diego]]'', or ''[[Flipping Miami]]''.

"'''Godless painters'''" is a term used by art historians to refer to [[Sebald Beham]], his brother [[Barthel Beham|Barthel]], and [[George Pencz]], as exemplified in the title of a 2011 catalog of the Beham brothers' works, ''The Godless Painters of Nuremberg:  Convention and Subversion in the Printmaking of the Beham Brothers''.&lt;ref name="Die gottlosen Maler, 2011"&gt;''Die gottlosen Maler von Nürnberg:  Konvention und Subversion in der Druckgrafik der Beham-Brüder'', edited by Jürgen Müller and Thomas Schauerte.  See [http://www.reimer-mann-verlag.de/controller.php?cmd=detail&amp;titelnummer=300040&amp;verlag=3 book review].&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet was coined in derision of the three painters during an inquest conducted by the [[Lutheran]] dominated city council of Nuremberg in 1525, which concerned the artists' [[protestant]] [[heterodoxy]]. The term is a [[double entendre]] eluding more to the content of the "godless painters" works, rather than the doctrinal views for which they were condemned. The typically small-scale prints often depicted biblical or moral themes with a touch of [[eroticism]]. The "godless painters" are also considered to be leading representatives of the group of [[Little Masters|little masters]].[[File:1540 Beham Vanitas anagoria.JPG|thumb|left|Barthel Beham, ''Vanity'', 1540, [[Hamburger Kunsthalle]].]]

The inquest consisted of numerous interrogations concerning matters of [[baptism]], the [[Eucharist]], and the role of [[secular]] authorities. Imprisonment and torture were threatened, but ultimately the three were condemned to short-term exile from the city.&lt;ref name="Stewart, 2015"&gt;Alison G. Stewart, [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1025&amp;context=artfacpub ''The Artist's Lament in 1528.

The inquiries took place during the [[German Peasants' War]], which involved theological controversies between [[Martin Luther]] and [[Thomas Müntzer]] on the matters at issues in the inquest into the beliefs of the painters. 

Historical accounts regarding the painters have often been cursory, and sometimes confused due to the lack of availability of primary sources.&lt;ref name="Stewart, 2015" /&gt;  The aforementioned catalog, ''The Godless Painters of Nuremberg'', promises to correct this deficit.&lt;ref name="Die gottlosen Maler, 2011" /&gt;

{{Dutch dialects}}
'''Gronings''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈɣroːnɪŋs}}), in the dialect itself called '''Grunnegs''' or '''Grönnegs''', is a collective name for some [[Friso-Saxon dialects]] spoken in the province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] and around the Groningen border in [[Drenthe]] and [[Friesland]]. Gronings and the strongly related [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] in [[East Frisia]] have a strong [[Saterland Frisian language|East Frisian]] influence and take a remarkable position within [[West Low German]]. The dialect is characterized by a typical accent and vocabulary, which differ strongly from the other Low Saxon dialects.

== Area ==
The name ''Gronings'' can almost be defined geographically, as can be seen on the map below. This is especially true for the northern part of Drenthe (number 8 on that map). The ''Drents'', spoken in the north of the province of [[Drenthe]] ([[Noordenveld]]) is somewhat related with the Groninger language, but the core linguistics is ''Drents''. For the dialects in the southeast, called [[Veenkoloniaals]], it's a bit different on both sides of the Groningen-Drenthe border, as the dialect spoken there is much more related to ''Gronings''. In the [[Friesland|Frisian]] municipality of [[Kollumerland en Nieuwkruisland]], the western dialect called [[Westerkwartiers]] is also spoken, as well as a separate Groningen dialect called [[Kollumerpompsters]]. The latter is spoken in the Frisian village of [[Kollumerpomp]] and has more [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] influences, while most Groningen dialects have a strong influence from the [[Saterland Frisian language|East Frisian language]].

== Dialects ==
The Gronings language can be subdivided into 8 dialects:

===Example===
Though there are several differences between the dialects, they form a single dialect group. Most words are written the same way, but the pronunciation can differ. The examples show the pronunciation.

*''Westerkertiers'': t Eenege dat wie niet doun is slik uutdeeln
*''Stadsgrunnegs'' (city): t Oinege dat wie noit doun is baaltjes oetdailn
*''Hoogelaandsters'': t Ainege dat wie nait dudden is slik oetdijln
*''Westerwoolds'': t Einege dat wie nich dun is slikkerij uutdeiln
*''Veenkelonioals'': t Ainege wat wie nait dudden is slikke uutduiln
*[[East Frisian Low Saxon]]: Dat eenzige, dat wi neet doon is Slickeree utdelen.
*[[Northern Low Saxon|North German Low Saxon]]: Dat eenzige, dat wi nich doot, (dat) is Snabbelkraam uutdeeln.
*Standard [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: Het enige wat we niet doen is snoep uitdelen.
*Standard [[German language|German]]: Das einzige, was wir nicht machen [="was wir nicht ''tun''"], ist Süßigkeiten austeilen.
*[[Scots language|Scots]]: The anerly thing we dinnae dae is gie oot snashters.
*[[English language|English]]: The only thing we don't do is hand out sweets.

== Classification ==
There are many uncertainties about the classification and categorization of Gronings. Some linguists see it as a variety of [[Low German]], also called ''Nedersaksisch'' in the Netherlands. These words are actually more political than linguistic, because they unite a large group of very differing varieties. Categorizing Gronings as Low German could be considered correct, but there is controversy surrounding the existence of the linguistic unity of Low German.

Others, especially German linguists, see Gronings-East Frisian as a separate group of [[German dialects]]. The East Frisian influence, the sounds ''ou'', ''ai'' and ''ui'' and the typical accent are crucial here. Gronings-East Frisian would be categorized as [[Friso-Saxon dialects]] instead of Low German. Other linguists categorize all Gronings-East Frisian dialects as North Low German. In that case, all the other Low German varieties in the Netherlands are categorized as [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]].

Dutch linguists in particular classify Gronings as [[Dutch Low Saxon]], in Germany also called ''Westplatt''. In this case the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] influence is crucial, while the dialects on the other side of the national border are strongly influenced by [[High German languages]]. These influences concern especially the vocabulary, like the Dutch word ''"voorbeeld"'' (example) which is ''"veurbeeld"'' in Gronings while the East Frisian dialects use ''"biespööl"'', which is related to the High German word ''"beispiel"''. In this case there is no separation between Groningen-East Frisian (or North Low Saxon) and Westphalian, but rather a difference between Groningen and East Frisian. The national border would equal the linguistic border.

== Origin ==
The Gronings dialects are a kind of mix between two languages: [[Old Frisian]] 
([[Saterland Frisian language|East Frisian]]) and Middle Low German. East Frisian was spoken in the ''[[Ommelanden]]'' (surrounding lands of the city of [[Groningen]]), while the city, the surrounding rural area called {{ill|Gorecht|nds-nl|Gerecht (streek)}} and the eastern lordship of [[Westerwolde (region)|Westerwolde]] were Low Saxon. When the city of Groningen developed an important position in the Ommelanden, a switch from East Frisian to Saxon occurred, although it was not a complete switch because there are many East Frisian influences in the "new" Groningen language. Many East Frisian words and grammatic features are still in use today. In less than one century, the same process also started in [[East Frisia]], from the city of Emden, which was influenced by the [[Hanseatic League]]. This explains the strong relation between both varieties.

In the second half of the 16th century Gronings started to evolve towards [[Middle Dutch]] because of the strong influence of the new standard language. But because of the political, geographical and cultural isolation of Groningen, a strong provincialism in the first half of the 19th century caused Gronings to develop itself in a significant way. The sounds that are used today were formed in this period.

== Usage ==

=== Daily life ===
Today, according to an investigation among the listeners to the regional broabcasting station (''Radio Noord''), approximately 65% of them can speak and write Gronings. Perhaps If the larger cities and villages of [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], [[Hoogezand-Sappemeer]], [[Veendam]], [[Stadskanaal]], [[Delfzijl]] and [[Winschoten]] are excluded from this count, the percentage would rise to about 80%. Of course, this is not a representative picture of the linguistic capacity of the inhabitants of Groningen province. Most of the older people use Gronings as their main language. Until the second half of the 20th century, Gronings was more important in Groningen than Dutch. Younger people also speak the language, however in a regiolectical mixed way, because many pure Gronings words are lost. The youngest generation passed to Dutch.  
Since the second half of the 20th century, the usage of the language is declining. Because of globalization, other languages like Dutch and English are becoming more important. Parents today chose to raise their children in the Dutch language.

=== Media ===
In the media Gronings is used frequently. For example, on the local radio station ''Radio Noord'', Gronings is used by the presenters and listeners. On local television Gronings is used less, but the [[weather forecast]] is always presented in Gronings. The news is always presented in Dutch, since not all viewers understand Gronings. In the second half of 2007, the local television broadcast a series in Gronings called {{ill|Boven Wotter|nds-nl}}. Another program that is in and about Gronings is ''Grunnegers'', which is actually some kind of education in Gronings.

Examples of Gronings magazines are {{ill|Toal en Taiken|nds-nl}} (language and signs) and {{ill|Krödde|nds-nl}}, which actually means [[cannabis]].{{CN|date=December 2017}}

There are many Gronings dictionaries as well. The first official dictionary was the "Nieuw Groninger Woordenboek" and was put together by [[Kornelis ter Laan]]. This dictionary and the writing system used in the book became the basics of each dictionary and writing system ever since.

More recent is "Zakwoordenboek Gronings - Nederlands / Nederlands - Gronings" by {{ill|Siemon Reker|nl}}, which is a little less specific. [[K. G. Pieterman]] wrote a dictionary of Gronings [[alliteration]]s which is titled ''Gezondhaid en Groutnis'' (sanity and greetings).

=== Education and culture ===
Although Gronings, as part of Low Saxon, is an official language, it is not a mandatory subject in schools. Still, many primary schools in Groningen choose to give attention to the regional language. This attention varies from inviting storytellers to teaching about the language. In secondary schools Gronings does not receive much attention.

At the [[University of Groningen]] it is possible to study the language. In October 2007 Gronings became an official study within the faculty of ''letteren'' (language and literature). The new professor, Siemon Reker, had already undergone many studies in the language and is famous for his dictionary.

Another possible way to learn Gronings is taking classes. In the last few years the trend of people taking courses has risen. More and more people, also people from outside who come to live in the area in which Gronings is spoken, are interested in the language and are willing to take courses. There are two types of courses. The first one is understanding and the second one is understanding and speaking.

Every year around March Het Huis van de Groninger Cultuur ([[English language|English]]: House of the Groningen Culture) organises a writing contest in every municipality in Groningen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pervinzioale Schriefwedstried|url=https://www.huisvandegroningercultuur.nl/activiteiten/pervinzioale-schriefwedstried-2/|website=Huis van de Groninger Cultuur|accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone can participate and send in a poem or some prose. The winners of the different ages succeed to the provincial round.

=== Music ===
Well known Groningen musical artists are Wia Buze, Alje van Bolhuis, Alex Vissering, Eltje Doddema, Pé Daalemmer &amp; Rooie Rinus, Burdy, Hail Gewoon and [[Ede Staal]] (†). Every year the supply of successful artists in regional languages in the Netherlands is rising.

== Frisian substratum ==
Some linguists classify Gronings to North Low Saxon, to which also [[East Frisian Low Saxon|East Frisian]] belongs. Both related dialects are characterized by an East Frisian influence. Hence other linguists classify Gronings-East Frisian as a separate group of Northwest Low Saxon or Friso-Saxon dialects. The most important similarities are grammar features and the vocabulary. The most important differences are the writing system and the loanwords. The East Frisian writing system is based on High German while Gronings uses many Dutch features. For example, the word for “ice skate” is in Gronings “scheuvel” and in East Frisian “Schöfel”, while the pronunciation is almost alike. Here are a few examples of words compared to West Frisian, East Frisian Low Saxon, German, Dutch and English.

|}

The East Frisian combination -oo (for example in ''Bloot'' = blood) is pronounced like -ow in the English word “now”(''[blowt]''; Gronings: ''blowd''). In some parts of the [[Rheiderland]] they say ''blyowt'', which is a leftover of Frisian in this area. The East Frisian combination -aa (for example in ''quaad'') is pronounced like –a in the British English word “water”. In Gronings this sound is written like –oa. The word water would be written like “woatah” in Gronings. The pronunciation of the word “quaad” is similar to the Gronings word “kwoad”, which means “angry”. The East Frisian combination -ee and -eei (for example in ''neet'') are pronounced like the –y in the English word “fly” (''[nyt]''; Gronings: ''nyt'')*.

== Linguistic distance from Standard Dutch ==
After [[Limburgish]], Gronings is the dialect with the farthest distance from Standard Dutch. Reasons for this are vocabulary and pronunciation. The Gronings vocabulary is quite different from Dutch, for example:

:Gronings: ''Doe hest n hail ìnde luu dij scheuvellopen kinnen'', {{small|pronounced:}} {{IPA|[du‿ɛst‿n̩ haɪ̯l‿ɪndə ly daɪ̯‿sxøːvəloʊ̯ʔm̩ kɪnː]}}
:Dutch: ''Jij hebt heel veel werknemers die kunnen schaatsen'', {{small|pronounced:}} {{IPA-nl|jɛi ɦɛpt ɦeːl veːl ʋɛrkneːmərs di kɵnə(n) sxaːtsə(n)|}}
:English: ''You have a lot of employees who can ice skate''

The pronunciation differs from the writing system. The -en ending of many words is pronounced like (ə or ən) in most varieties of [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. In Gronings and many other [[Low German|Low Saxon]] dialects these words are pronounced with a [[glottal stop]], thus making the words ending in {{IPA|[ʔŋ]}}, {{IPA|[ʔn]}} or {{IPA|[ʔm]}}.
The Groningen people speak quite fast compared to the Dutch people, with the result that a lot of words are pronounced together as one word.

Gronings is also a dialect with many unique expressions. One third of the language consists of these expressions. In the example sentence ''n hail ìnde'' is an example of those expressions. Many of these are given in the 'Nieuwe Groninger Woordenboek' by K. ter Laan published in 1977, (1280pp).

Because of this far distance from Standard Dutch and the official status of the neighbouring [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], Grunnegs is considered as a separate language by some of its native speakers, while linguists consider it part of [[Dutch Low Saxon]].

'''Lord’s Prayer'''
:Os Voader in Hemel, ''(litt. Our Father in Heaven)''
:dat Joen Noam haailegd worden zel, ''(litt. May Thy name be hallowed)''
:dat Joen Keunenkriek kommen mag, ''(litt. May Thy kingdom come)''
:dat Joen wil doan wordt ''(litt. May Thy will be done)''
:op Eerd net as in hemel. ''(litt. On earth, like in heaven)''

:geef os dat vandoag, ''(litt. give it to us today)''
:en reken os nait tou wat wie verkeerd doun, ''(litt. And do not blame us for the things we do wrong)''
:net zo as wie vergeven elk dij os wat aandut. ''(litt. As we forgive those who trespass against us)''
:En breng os nait in verlaaiden, ''(litt. And lead us not into temptation)''
:mor wil van verlaaider ons verlözzen. ''(litt. But deliver us from the tempter)''
:Den Joe binnen t Keunenkriek, ''(litt. Because Thou art the kingdom)''
:de Kracht en de Heerlekhaid. ''(litt. the Power and the Glory)''
:Veur in aiweghaid. ''(litt. For eternity)''
:Amen

==Vocabulary==
The Gronings vocabulary is strongly related to East Frisian Low Saxon, Saterfrisian and West Frisian. However, today the pure Gronings vocabulary is in decline. More and more Gronings words are being replaced by “Groningized” Dutch words. For example, the word “stevel” (boot, German “Stiefel”) is sometimes replaced by the word “leers” (Dutch “laars”). Although most people do know the pure words, they are less and less used, for example because people think others will not understand them or because they are too long and the Dutch word is much easier. An example of the latter is the word for sock, which is “Hozevörrel” in Gronings. The Dutch word “sok” is much easier, so it is more often used than hozevörrel.

Some often used Gronings words are listed below;

'''Hawaiian Pidgin English''' (alternately '''Hawaiian Creole English''' or '''HCE''', known locally as '''Pidgin''') is an [[English language|English-based]] [[creole language]] spoken in [[Hawaii|Hawaiʻi]] (L1: 600,000; L2: 400,000)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/hwc|title=Hawai’i Pidgin|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the Hawaiian language, Hawaiian Creole English is called "{{okina}}ōlelo pa{{okina}}i {{okina}}ai", which literally means "pounding-taro language".&lt;ref name="Wehewehe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wehewehe.org/gsdl2.5/cgi-bin/hdict?a=q&amp;r=1&amp;hs=1&amp;e=q-0hdict--00-0-0--010---4----den--0-000lpm--1haw-Zz-1---Zz-1-home---00031-0000escapewin-00&amp;q=pa%27i+%27ai&amp;j=pm&amp;hdid=0&amp;hdds=0|title=paʻi ʻai|last=|first=|date=|work=|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120919073814/http://www.wehewehe.org/gsdl2.5/cgi-bin/hdict?a=q&amp;r=1&amp;hs=1&amp;e=q-0hdict--00-0-0--010---4----den--0-000lpm--1haw-Zz-1---Zz-1-home---00031-0000escapewin-00&amp;q=pa'i+'ai&amp;j=pm&amp;hdid=0&amp;hdds=0|archive-date=September 19, 2012|dead-url=yes|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its name, Hawaiian Pidgin is not a [[pidgin]], but rather a full-fledged, [[nativization|nativized]], and demographically stable creole language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/hwc|title=Hawai’i Pidgin|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=https://archive.is/2067T|archive-date=March 9, 2015|dead-url=|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did, however, evolve from various real pidgins spoken as common languages between ethnic groups in Hawaiʻi. 

Although it is not completely mutually intelligible with [[American English|Standard American English]], Hawaiian Pidgin retains the highest degree of mutual intelligibility with it when compared with other [[English-based creoles]], such as [[Jamaican Patois]], in part due to its relatively recent emergence.

==History==
Hawaiian Pidgin originated on [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]]s as a form of communication used between English speaking residents and non-English speaking [[Native Hawaiians]] and foreign immigrants.&lt;ref name="nō ka ʻoi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mauinokaoimag.com/Maui-Magazine/January-February-2008/Da-Muddah-Tongue/ |title=Da Muddah Tongue |first=Kathy |last=Collins |work=www.mauinokaoimag.com – Maui nō ka ʻoi Magazine |date=January–February 2008 |oclc=226379163 |location=Wailuku, HI, USA |accessdate=October 18, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605130329/http://www.mauinokaoimag.com/Maui-Magazine/January-February-2008/Da-Muddah-Tongue/ |archivedate=June 5, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It supplanted, and was influenced by, the existing [[pidgin]] that Native Hawaiians already used on plantations and elsewhere in Hawaiʻi. Because such sugarcane plantations often hired workers from many different countries, a [[trade language|common language]] was needed in order for the plantation workers to communicate effectively with each other and their supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/satocenter/langnet/definitions/hce.html#bkgd-hce|title=Hawai`i Creole English|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaiian Pidgin has been influenced by many different languages, including [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[American English]], and [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]. As people of other language backgrounds were brought in to work on the plantations, such as [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese]], [[Filipino people|Filipinos]], and [[Koreans]], Hawaiian Pidgin acquired words from these languages. [[Japanese loanwords in Hawaii|Japanese loanwords in Hawaiʻi]] lists some of those words originally from Japanese. It has also been influenced to a lesser degree by [[Spanish language|Spanish]] spoken by [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] settlers in Hawaiʻi. Hawaiian Pidgin also takes loanwords from the Hawaiian Language. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hiramoto|first=Mie|date=2011|title=Consuming the consumers: Semiotics of Hawai‘i Creole in advertisements|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/jpcl.26.2.02hir|journal=Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages|volume=26|issue=2|pages=247–275|doi=10.1075/jpcl.26.2.02hir|issn=0920-9034}}&lt;/ref&gt;Hawaiian Pidgin was created mainly as a means of communication or to facilitate cooperation between the immigrants and the Americans to get business done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyeofhawaii.com/Pidgin/pidgin.htm|title=Eye of Hawaii – Pidgin, The Unofficial Language of Hawaii|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even today, Hawaiian Pidgin retains some influences from these languages.  For example, the word "stay" in Hawaiian Pidgin has a form and use similar to the Hawaiian verb "noho", Portuguese verb "ficar" or Spanish "estar", which mean "to be" but are used only when referring to a temporary state or location.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Hawaiian Pidgin started to be used outside the plantation between ethnic groups. In the 1980's two educational programs started that were lead in Hawaiian Pidgin to help students learn Standard English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ohama|first=Mary Lynn Fiore|last2=Gotay|first2=Carolyn C.|last3=Pagano|first3=Ian S.|last4=Boles|first4=Larry|last5=Craven|first5=Dorothy D.|date=2000|title=Evaluations of Hawaii Creole English and Standard English|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0261927x00019003005|journal=Journal of Language and Social Psychology|volume=19|issue=3|pages=357–377|doi=10.1177/0261927x00019003005|issn=0261-927X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public school children learned Hawaiian Pidgin from their classmates and parents. Living in a community mixed with various cultures led to the daily usage of Hawaiian Pidgin, also causing the language to expand. It was easier for school children of different ethnic backgrounds to speak Hawaiian Pidgin then to learn another language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SIEGEL|first=JEFF|date=2000|title=Substrate influence in Hawai‘i Creole English|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0047404500002025|journal=Language in Society|volume=29|issue=02|pages=|doi=10.1017/s0047404500002025|issn=0047-4045|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children growing up with this language expanded Hawaiian Pidgin as their first language, or mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sls.hawaii.edu/pidgin/whatIsPidgin.php|title=Talking Story about Pidgin : What is Pidgin?|last=Department of Second Language Studies|first=|date=2010|website=www.sls.hawaii.edu|publisher=University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, [[linguistics|linguist]]s generally consider Hawaiian Pidgin to be a [[creole language]].{{Sfn|Hargrove|Sakoda|Siegel|2017}} A five-year survey that the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] conducted in Hawaiʻi and released in November 2015 revealed that many people spoke Pidgin as an additional language. Because of this, in 2015, the U.S. Census Bureau added Pidgin to its list of official languages in the state of Hawaiʻi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/12/living/pidgin-english-hawaii/index.html|title=Pidgin English is now an official language of Hawaii|last=Laddaran|first=Kerry Chan|date=2015-11-12|website=CNN|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Hawaiian Pidgin has distinct pronunciation differences from standard American English (SAE). Long vowels are not pronounced in Hawaiian Pidgin if the speaker is using Hawaiian loanwords. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some key differences include the following:

*[[Th-stopping]]: {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}} are pronounced as {{IPA|[t]}} or {{IPA|[d]}} respectively—that is, changed from a [[fricative]] to a [[plosive]] (stop). For instance, ''think'' {{IPA|/θiŋk/}} becomes {{IPA|[tiŋk]}}, and ''that'' {{IPA|/ðæt/}} becomes {{IPA|[dæt]}}. An example is “Broke da mout” (tasted good).
*[[L-vocalization]]: Word-final ''l'' {{IPA|[l~ɫ]}} is often pronounced {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[ol]}}.  For instance, ''mental'' {{IPA|/mɛntəl/}} is often pronounced {{IPA|[mɛntoː]}}; ''people'' is pronounced [pipo].
* Hawaiian Pidgin is [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]].  That is, ''r'' after a vowel is often omitted, similar to many dialects, such as [[Eastern New England English|Eastern New England]], [[Australian English]], and [[English English|British English]] [[variety (linguistics)|variants]].  For instance, ''car'' is often pronounced ''cah'', and ''letter'' is pronounced ''letta''. [[intrusive R|Intrusive r]] is also used. The number of Hawaiian Pidgin speakers with rhotic English has also been increasing.
* Hawaiian Pidgin has falling [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] in questions. In yes/no questions, falling intonation is striking and appears to be a lasting imprint of [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] (this pattern is not found in yes/no question intonation in American English). This particular falling intonation pattern is shared with some other [[Oceanic languages]], including [[Fijian language|Fijian]] and [[Samoan language|Samoan]] (Murphy, K. 2013).

==Grammatical features==
[[File:Hawaii Pidgin inscription.JPG|thumb|upright|230px|Inscription in Hawaiian Pidgin ([[Gospel of Mark]] 1:9–11)]]
Hawaiian Pidgin also has distinct grammatical forms not found in SAE, but some of which are shared with other dialectal forms of English or may derive from other linguistic influences.

Forms used for SAE "to be":
*Generally, forms of English "to be" (i.e. the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]]) are omitted when referring to inherent qualities of an object or person, forming in essence a [[stative verb]] form.  Additionally, [[inverted sentence]] order may be used for emphasis. (Many [[East Asia]]n languages use stative verbs instead of the copula-[[adjective]] construction of English and other Western languages.)
: ''Da behbeh cute.'' (or) ''Cute, da behbeh.''
: The baby is cute.

Note that these constructions also mimic the grammar of the Hawaiian language.  In Hawaiian, "nani ka pēpē" or "kiuke ka pēpē" is literally "cute the baby" and is perfectly correct Hawaiian grammar meaning in English, "The baby is cute."

*When the verb "to be" refers to a temporary state or location, the word ''stay'' is used (see above). This may be influenced by other Pacific creoles, which use the word ''stap'', from ''stop'', to denote a temporary state or location. In fact, ''stop'' was used in Hawaiian Pidgin earlier in its history, and may have been dropped in favor of ''stay'' due to influence from Portuguese ''estar'' or ''ficar'' (ficar is literally translated to English as 'to stay', but often used in place of "to be" e.g. "ele fica feliz" ''he is happy'').

: ''Da book stay on top da table.''
: The book is on the table.

: ''Da watah stay cold.''
: The water is cold.

For [[Grammatical tense|tense]]-marking of [[verb]], [[auxiliary verb]]s are employed:
* To express past tense, Hawaiian Pidgin uses ''wen'' (went) in front of the verb.
: ''Jesus wen cry.'' ([[Bible translations into Hawaii Pidgin|"Da Jesus Book"]], John 11:35)
: Jesus cried.

* To express future tense, Hawaiian Pidgin uses ''goin'' (going), derived from the [[going-to future]] common in informal varieties of American English.
: ''God goin do plenny good kine stuff fo him.'' ([[Bible translations into Hawaii Pidgin|"Da Jesus Book"]], Mark 11:9)
: God is going to do a lot of good things for him.

* To express past tense negative, Hawaiian Pidgin uses ''neva'' (never). ''Neva'' can also mean "never" as in normal English usage; context sometimes, but not always, makes the meaning clear.
: ''He neva like dat.''
: He didn't want that. (or) He never wanted that. (or) He didn't like that.

* Use of ''fo'' (for) in place of the infinitive particle "to". Cf. dialectal form "Going for carry me home."
: ''I tryin fo tink.'' (or) ''I try fo tink.''
: I'm trying to think.

==Sociolinguistics==
The language is highly stigmatized in formal settings, for which American English or Hawaiian are preferred, and therefore reserved for everyday casual conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drager|first=Katie|date=2012-01-01|title=Pidgin and Hawai‘i English: An overview|url=https://ejournals.epublishing.ekt.gr/index.php/latic/article/view/2717|journal=International Journal of Language, Translation and Intercultural Communication|language=en|volume=1|issue=0|pages=61–73|doi=10.12681/ijltic.10|issn=2241-7214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have proved that children in kindergarten preferred Hawaiian Pidgin, but once they were in grade one and more socially conditioned they preferred Standard English.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ohama|first=Mary Lynn Fiore|last2=Gotay|first2=Carolyn C.|last3=Pagano|first3=Ian S.|last4=Boles|first4=Larry|last5=Craven|first5=Dorothy D.|date=2000|title=Evaluations of Hawaii Creole English and Standard English|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0261927x00019003005|journal=Journal of Language and Social Psychology|volume=19|issue=3|pages=357–377|doi=10.1177/0261927x00019003005|issn=0261-927X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaiian Pidgin is often criticized in business, educational, family, social, and community situations and Hawaiian Pidgin is construed as rude, crude or [[broken English]] among some Standard English speakers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marlow|first=Mikaela L.|last2=Giles|first2=Howard|date=2010|title=‘We won't get ahead speaking like that!’ Expressing and managing language criticism in Hawai'i|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01434630903582714|journal=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development|volume=31|issue=3|pages=237–251|doi=10.1080/01434630903582714|issn=0143-4632|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many tourists find Hawaiian Pidgin appealing. Local travel companies favor those who speak Hawaiian Pidgin and hire them as speakers or customer service agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.to-hawaii.com/hawaiian-pidgin.php|title=Hawaiian pidgin – Hawaiʻi's third language|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and performing arts==
In recent years, writers from Hawaiʻi such as [[Lois-Ann Yamanaka]], [[Joe Balaz]] and [[Lee Tonouchi]] have written poems, short stories, and other works in Hawaiian Pidgin. A Hawaiian Pidgin translation of the [[New Testament]] (called ''[[Da Jesus Book]]'') has also been created, as has an adaptation of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Twelfth Night, or What You Will]]'', titled in Hawaiian Pidgin "twelf nite o' WATEVA!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-05-31/entertainment/ca-7742_1_twelf-nite-o-wateva|title=THEATER REVIEW :  'Twelf Nite' a New Twist on Shakespeare|date=May 31, 1995|author=F. Kathleen Foley |work=LA Times|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[theater]] companies in Hawai{{okina}}i produce plays written and performed in Hawaiian Pidgin.  The most notable of these companies is [[Kumu Kahua Theater]].

Hawaiian Pidgin has occasionally been featured on ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' as the protagonists frequently interact with locals. The show heavily features Hawaiian culture and is filmed on location.

[[Milton Murayama]]'s novel ''All I asking for is my body'' uses Hawaiʻi Pidgin in the title of the novel.

Two books, [[Pidgin to Da Max]] humorously portray pidgin through prose and illustrations.

As of March 2008, Hawaiian Pidgin has started to become more popular in local television advertisements as well as other media.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hiramoto|first=Mie|date=2011|title=Consuming the consumers: Semiotics of Hawai‘i Creole in advertisements|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/jpcl.26.2.02hir|journal=Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages|volume=26|issue=2|pages=247–275|doi=10.1075/jpcl.26.2.02hir|issn=0920-9034}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hawaiin Pidgin is used in advertisements, it is often changed to better fit the targeted audience of the ''kama‘aina.''&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4032">'''Hybrid machine translation''' is a method of [[machine translation]] that is characterized by the use of multiple machine translation approaches within a single machine translation system. The motivation for developing hybrid machine translation systems stems from the failure of any single technique to achieve a satisfactory level of accuracy. Many hybrid machine translation systems have been successful in  improving the accuracy of the translations, and there are several popular machine translation systems which employ hybrid methods. Among these are [[PROMT]], [[SYSTRAN]] and Omniscien Technologies (formerly Asia Online).

==Approaches==

===Multi-engine===

This approach to hybrid machine translation involves running multiple machine translation systems in parallel. The final output is generated by combining the output of all the sub-systems. Most commonly, these  systems use statistical and rule-based translation subsystems,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hutchins, J. 2007. Machine translation: A concise history. Computer aided translation: Theory and practice.&lt;/ref&gt; but other combinations have been explored. For example, researchers at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] have had some success combining [[Example-based machine translation|example-based]], [[Transfer-based machine translation|transfer-based]], knowledge-based and [[Statistical machine translation|statistical]] translation sub-systems into one machine translation system.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C. and Frederking, R. 1998. An Evaluation of the Multi-engine MT Architecture. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1529 pp. 113-123.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical rule generation===

This approach involves using statistical data to generate [[lexicon|lexical]] and [[syntactic]] rules.The input is then processed with these rules as if it were a [[Rule-based machine translation|rule-based]] translator.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This approach attempts to avoid the difficult and time-consuming task  of creating a set of comprehensive, fine-grained linguistic rules by extracting  those rules from the training corpus. This approach still suffers from many problems of normal [[statistical machine translation]], namely that the accuracy of  the translation will depend heavily on the similarity of the input text to the text of the training corpus. As a result, this technique has had the most success in domain-specific applications, and has the same difficulties with domain adaptation as many [[statistical machine translation]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, J. and Su, K. 1997. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jing-Shin_Chang/publication/249683953_Corpus-Based_Statistics-Oriented_CBSO_Machine_Translation_Researches_in_Taiwan/links/565596af08ae1ef9297727cb.pdf Corpus-based statistics-oriented (CBSO) machine translation researches in Taiwan]. AMTA (1997), pp. 165--173.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi-Pass===

This approach involves serially processing the input multiple times. The most common technique used in multi-pass machine translation systems is to [[Pre-processing|pre-process]] the input with a [[Rule-based machine translation|rule-based]] machine translation system. The output of the rule-based pre-processor is passed to a [[statistical machine translation]] system, which produces the final output. This technique is used to limit the amount of  information a statistical system need consider, significantly reducing the processing power required. It also removes the need for the rule-based system to  be a complete translation system for the language, significantly reducing the amount of human effort and labor necessary to build the system.&lt;ref&gt;Hovy, E. 1996. Deepening wisdom or compromised principles?-the hybridization of statistical and symbolic MT systems. IEEE Expert, 11 (2), pp. 16--18.

'''''Il-Kantilena''''' is the oldest known literary text in the [[Maltese language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Friggieri|1994|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; It dates from the 15th century (no later than 1485, the death of its author, and probably from the 1470s) but was not found until 1966 or 1968 by Prof. [[Godfrey Wettinger]] and Fr. [[M. Fsadni]] (OP). The poem is attributed to [[Pietru Caxaro]], and was recorded by Caxaro's nephew, Brandano, in his notarial register (Dec. 1533–May 1563).

Although written in Maltese, in Latin script, it was a very early Maltese that had not yet been influenced much by Italian or English, and is thus an example of historic Maltese.
This text contains many Arabic [[morphemes]]. The only Romance words are ''vintura'' "luck", sometimes translated into English as fate, and ''et'' "and".
In general, early Maltese texts contain very little non-Semitic vocabulary; even in later texts, poetry tends to use more Semitic vocabulary than general language use does.&lt;ref&gt;http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/The%20Arabs%20in%20Malta/1975Approaches%20to%20medieval%20Malta%20Luttrell.pdf p. 66-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approximate English translation===
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Witness my predicament, my friends (neighbours), as I shall relate it to you:
[What] never has there been, neither in the past, nor in your lifetime,
A [similar] heart, ungoverned, without lord or king (sultan),
That threw me down a well, with broken stairs
Where, yearning to drown, I descend the steps of my downfall,
I climb back up and down again, always faced with high seas.

It (she) fell, my building, its foundations collapsed;
It was not the builders’ fault, but the rock gave way,
Where I had hoped to find rock, I found loose clay
It (she) fell, my edifice, (that) which I had been building for so long.&lt;ref&gt;See Mark Montebello, "Between rectitude and incongruity: The chiastic structure of the Cantilena (Rabat, Malta: Faraxa Publishing House, 2016), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

And so, my edifice subsided, and I shall have to build it up again,
You change it to the site that suits her/it
Who changes his place, changes his fate!
for each (piece of land) has its own shape (features);
there is white land and there is black land, and red
But above all, (what) you want from it is a fruit.&lt;ref&gt;http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/The%20Arabs%20in%20Malta/1975Approaches%20to%20medieval%20Malta%20Luttrell.pdf pp. 66-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4321">'''Inscriptions of Aphrodisias''' was a project funded by the [[Leverhulme Trust]] and the [[British Academy]] that aimed to publish the [[Epigraphy|inscriptions]] of the Greek ancient site of [[Aphrodisias]] (modern day Turkey) online. Apart from aiming for a digital publication of the inscriptions, the experience from this publishing process was intended to be used for further development of the guidelines of the [[EpiDoc]] collaborative, on which the publication was based.

==History==
Initial efforts to form an international team of collaborators were already made in 2002, with a British Academy project led by [[Charlotte Roueché]] and [[Geoffrey B. Waywell]]. A first major result was the publication of 'Aphrodisias in Late Antiquity' ('ala2004') by Charlotte Roueché in 2004, which is [http://insaph.kcl.ac.uk/ala2004/ available online]. [[Leverhulme Trust|Leverhulme's]] grant in 2004 also allowed the establishment of several workshops a year from May the same year. These workshops were held in the United States, the United Kingdom and mainland Europe to allow wide participation and collaboration.

The goal was to create a follow-up publication of a much wider range of inscriptions from [[Aphrodisias]] as well as to amend existing standards for the digital publication of [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] material and producing new guidelines where necessary. To this end, more than ten workshops were held between 2004 and 2006, and representatives of the project also gave talks on the project in various context during this period. The final first edition of a corpus of all inscriptions from Aphrodisias was published in 2007 by [[Joyce Reynolds (classicist)|Joyce Reynolds]], Charlotte Roueché and Gabriel Bodard, and is also [http://insaph.kcl.ac.uk/iaph2007/index.html available online].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gabriel |last=Bodard |title=The Inscriptions of Aphrodisias as electronic publication: A user's perspective and a proposed paradigm |journal=Digital Medievalist |volume=4 |year=2008 |url=http://digitalmedievalist.org/journal/4/bodard/}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project aims==
[[Aphrodisias]] was a small ancient Greek city in modern-day Turkey. It is well known for its rich [[Epigraphy|epigraphic]] record with about 2000 known [[Epigraphy|inscriptions]] conditioned by the high-quality marble from the area. This richness invited a publication format different from the conventional, and the choice of online publication using [[EpiDoc]] was chosen for the possibility to incorporate diverse archaeological information as well as good accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://insaph.kcl.ac.uk/project/aphrodisias.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially intended to create a corpus of the inscriptions of Aphrodisias and to further develop the EpiDoc guidelines, the Inscriptions of Aphrodisias Project also proved to foster the networks and collaboration between scholars in the field. Another result was the plan to develop the EpiDoc guidelines not only as a tool for publication, but also for editing and preparing a publication.&lt;ref&gt;http://insaph.kcl.ac.uk/project/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Timotheus Hermes''' (31 May 1738 – 24 July 1821) was a [[Germany|German]] [[poet]], [[novelist]] and [[Protestant]] [[theologian]].&lt;ref name=ADBJohTimHer&gt;{{cite web|author=Adolf Schimmelpfennig |author-link=:de:Adolf Schimmelpfennig (Historiker)|url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Hermes,_Johann_Timotheus|title=Hermes, Johann Timotheus|work=[[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie|Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (ADB)]]|volume= 12|publisher= Duncker &amp; Humblot, Leipzig &amp; [[Wikisource]]|date=1880|pages=197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Provenance===
Johann Timotheus Hermes was born in [[Piasecznik, Choszczno County|Petznick]], a small village near [[Stargard Szczeciński|Stargard]] in [[Western Pomerania]]. His father was a Protestant pastor. His mother, Lukrezia, was the daughter of another Protestant pastor, Heinrich Becker from [[Rostock]].&lt;ref name=ndbJTH&gt;{{cite web|author= Erich Beyreuther|title= Hermes, Johann Timotheus|url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/pnd11877414X.html|work= [[Neue Deutsche Biographie|Neue Deutsche Biographie (NDB)]]|volume= 8|publisher= Duncker &amp; Humblot, Berlin|date= 1969| isbn= 3-428-00189-3| page=669 f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had an elder brother, [[Hermann Daniel Hermes]] (1734–1807), who would attain a certain level of notability as a theologian.&lt;ref name=ADBHarDanHer&gt;{{cite web|author=Adolf Schimmelpfennig |author-link=:de:Adolf Schimmelpfennig (Historiker) |url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Hermes,_Johann_Timotheus|title=Hermes, Hermann Daniel|work=[[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie|Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (ADB)]]|volume= 12|publisher= Duncker &amp; Humblot, Leipzig &amp; [[Wikisource]]|date=1880|pages=196–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional employment===
He studied [[Theology]] at [[University of Königsberg|Königsberg]] and then became a teacher at the [[:de:Ritterakademie (Brandenburg an der Havel)|Ritterakademie ("Cathedral School";  literally ''"Knights' Academy"'')]] at [[Brandenburg an der Havel]].   There followed a succession of ecclesistical posts, as he became a [[military chaplain]], a [[chaplain|court chaplain]] in [[Central Germany (cultural area)|Anhalt]] and then a pastor in [[Pszczyna|Pleß]].   In 1771 Hermes became a professor of [[Theology]] at the [[2nd High School in Wrocław|Maria Magdalena Gymnasium (high school)]] in [[Breslau]], and four years later appointed a [[Provost (religion)|Provost]] in [[Breslau]]'s new town district.&lt;ref name=ADBHarDanHer/&gt;   Subsequently he became a pastor at the cathedral church.   In 1808 he became [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|Administrative Superintendent]] with responsibility for the churches and schools in the Breslau Princedom.

Hermes has become known, above all, for his novels "Geschichte der Miss Fanny Wilkes" (''"The Story of Miss Fanny Wilkes"'' 1766)&lt;ref name=FannWilk&gt;{{cite book|title=Geschichte der Miss Fanny Wilkes: so gut als aus dem Englischen übersetzt|author=Johann Timotheus Hermes|publisher=Johann Friedrich Junius, Leipzig|date=1770}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Sophiens Reise von Memel nach Sachsen" (''"Sophie's Journey from Memel to Saxony"'' 1769-1773 in five volumes)&lt;ref name=SophieausMemel&gt;{{cite book|title=Sophiens Reise von Memel nach Sachsen|author=Johann Timotheus Hermes|url=http://digital.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/werkansicht/?PPN=PPN642878110&amp;PHYSID=PHYS_0003|publisher=Heinrich Bender u. Cie, Worms &amp; Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz, Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin|work=isbn relates to a twenty-first century re-issue|isbn=978-3875843392|date=1776}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were very successful at the time, and translated into several languages.   The second of these became one of the most read novel in German during the eighteenth century.   The author gained the popular soubriquet "Sophien-Hermes" from it:  its continuing importance two centuries later is based on its real-life descriptions concerning the cultural history of its time.   The book also adumbrates aspects of the psychological novels which would flourish in the nineteenth century.   "Sophie's Journey" is nevertheless characteristic of its own epoch.   It is one of the most important [[Sentimentalism (literature)|Empathy novels]]:  Hermes consciously imported the style of his exemplar [[Samuel Richardson]], whose own novels had been translated into German a few years earlier.

Although Hermes wrote several more novels, he never came close to repeating the commercial success of his first two.  In 1779 he published in a stand-alone volume the poems from "Sophie's Journey", presented as songs and arias, with music by [[Johann Adam Hiller]].   Other composers who set poems by Johann Timotheus Hermes to music were [[Maria Theresia von Paradis]], [[Joseph Martin Kraus]], [[Franz Anton Hoffmeister]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].

Despite his success or because of it, Hermes was the butt of much ridicule from the "literary greats" among his contemporaries.   He was ridiculed in [[Xenien]], a collection of [[Couplet]]s published jointly by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]].&lt;ref name=Xenien&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digbib.org/Friedrich_von_Schiller_1759/Xenien|title=Goethe und Schiller: Xenien|author1=[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]|author2=[[Friedrich Schiller]]|publisher=DigBib.Org: Die freie digitale Bibliothek (Ingo Frost), Eberswalde}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==

In 1919 [[George Abraham Grierson]] wrote that “Kashmiri is the only one of the [[Dardic languages]] that has a literature”. Kashmiri literature dates back to over 750 years, this is, more-or-less, the age of many a modern literature including modern English.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

{{see also|Kashmiri literature#Kashmiri_language_literature}}

==Grammar==
Kashmiri is a [[Fusional language|fusional language]]&lt;ref&gt;Koul, Omkar N and Kashi Wali (2006). ''Modern Kashmiri Grammar'' Dunwoody Press. pp.25.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[V2 word order|verb-second (V2)]] word order.&lt;ref&gt;''Koshur: An Introduction to Spoken Kashmiri'' (2002). Kashmir News Network, pp.80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several of Kashmiri’s grammatical features distinguish it from other [[Indo-Aryan languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.ii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nouns===
Kashmiri nouns are inflected according to gender, number and case.  There are no [[Article (grammar)|articles]], nor is there any grammatical distinction for [[definiteness]], although there is some optional adverbial marking for indefinite or “generic” noun qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender====
The Kashmiri [[Grammatical gender|gender]] system is divided into masculine and feminine.  Feminine forms are typically generated by the addition of a suffix (or in most cases, a [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic]] change, or both) to a masculine noun.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.25.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a relatively small group of feminine nouns that have unique [[suppletion]] forms which are totally different from the corresponding masculine forms.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.28.&lt;/ref&gt;  The following table illustrates the range of possible gender forms:&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.26-28.&lt;/ref&gt;	
::{| class="wikitable"
|-  
||'''Process'''||'''Masculine'''||'''Feminine'''||'''Meaning'''
|-
|-en’ suffix||dukāndār||dukāndāren’||shopkeeper
|-
|-bāy suffix||māstar||māstarbāy||teacher
|-
|-in’ + vowel change||khar||khərin’||donkey
|-
|-ɨr + vowel change||phot||phɔtɨr||basket
|-
|vowel change||sur||suɨr||child 
|-
|consonant change||hokh||hoch||dry
|-
|vowel/consonant change||tot||təts||hot
|-
|suppletive form||marɨd||zanān||man/woman
|-
|masculine only||kāv||---||crow
|-
|feminine only||---||məch||fly
|}

Some nouns borrowed from other languages, such as Persian, Arabic, Sanskrit, Hindi or English, follow a slightly different gender system.  Notably, many words borrowed from Hindi have different genders in Kashmiri.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.28.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Case====
There are five [[Grammatical case|cases]] in Kashmiri: [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Dative case|dative]], [[Ergative case|ergative]], [[Ablative case|ablative]] and [[Vocative case|vocative]].&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Case is expressed via suffixation of the noun.  

Kashmiri utilizes an [[Ergative-absolutive language|ergative-absolutive case structure]] when the verb is in simple past tense.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, in these sentences, the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of a [[Transitive verb|transitive]] verb is marked in the ergative case and the [[Object (grammar)|object]] in nominative, which is identical to how the subject of an [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]] verb would be marked.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wade, TR (1888). ''A Grammar of the Kashmiri Language,'' SPCK. pp.16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bhatt, Rajesh (2007)."Ergativity in Indo-Aryan Languages", ''MIT Ergativity Seminar'', pp.6.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in sentences constructed in any other tense, or in past tense sentences with intransitive verbs, a nominative-dative paradigm is adopted, with objects (whether direct or indirect) generally marked in dative case.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other case distinctions, such as [[Locative case|locative]], [[Instrumental case|instrumental]], [[Genitive case|genitive]], [[Comitative case|comitative]] and [[Allative case|allative]], are marked by [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]] rather than suffixation.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.39.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Noun morphology====
The following table illustrates Kashmiri noun declension according to gender, number and case.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wade 1888, pp.10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|'''Abl.'''||-i/ɨ||-av||-i||-av
|-
|'''Voc.'''||-ā||-av||-iy||-av
|}

===Verbs===
Kashmiri verbs are declined according to tense and [[Grammatical person|person]], and to a lesser extent, gender.  Tense, along with certain distinctions of [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], is formed by the addition of suffixes to the verb stem (minus the [[Infinitive|infinitive]] ending -un), and in many cases by the addition of various [[Modal verb|modal auxiliaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.83-84.&lt;/ref&gt;  Postpositions fulfill numerous adverbial and semantic roles.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.119.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tense====
Present tense in Kashmiri is an auxiliary construction formed by a combination of the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] and the imperfective suffix -ān added to the verb stem.  The various copula forms agree with their subject according to gender and number, and are provided below with the verb ''yun'' (to come):&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Past tense in Kashmiri is significantly more complex than the other tenses, and is subdivided into three past tense distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.86.&lt;/ref&gt;  The simple (sometimes called proximate) past refers to past actions which have been completed.  Remote past refers to actions that lack this in-built perfective aspect.  Indefinite past refers to actions performed a long time ago, and is often used in historical narrative or storytelling contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.87.&lt;/ref&gt;  

As described above, Kashmiri is a [[Split ergativity|split-ergative]] language; in all three of these past tense forms, the subjects of transitive verbs are marked in the ergative case and direct objects in the nominative.  Intransitive subjects are marked in the nominative.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nominative arguments, whether subjects or objects, dictate gender, number and person marking on the verb.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zakharyin, Boris (2015). "Indo-Aryan Ergativity and its Analogues in Languages of Central and Western Eurasia", ''The Poznań Society for the Advancement of Arts and Sciences'', PL ISSN 0079-4740, pp.66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Verbs of the simple past tense are formed via the addition of a suffix to the verb stem, which usually undergoes certain uniform morphophonemic changes.   First and third person verbs of this type do not take suffixes and agree with the nominative object in gender and number, but there are second person verb endings.  The entire simple past tense paradigm of transitive verbs is illustrated below using the verb ''parun'' ("to read"):&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a group of "special intransitives", irregular intransitive verbs which take a different set of endings in addition to the morphophonemic changes that affect most past tense verbs.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.91-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

|-

|-	
|'''3rd Person'''||-Ø||-Ø||-ch||-i
|}

Intransitive verbs in the simple past are conjugated the same as intransitives in the indefinite past tense form.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.93.&lt;/ref&gt;
::{| class="wikitable"

In contrast to the simple past, verb stems are unchanged in the indefinite and remote past, although the addition of the tense suffixes does cause some morphophonetic change.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.94.&lt;/ref&gt;  Transitive verbs are declined according to the following paradigm:&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.94-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the simple past, "special intransitive" verbs take a different set of endings in the indefinite and remote past:&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.96-97.&lt;/ref&gt;
::{| class="wikitable"

Regular intransitive verbs also take a different set of endings in the indefinite and remote past, subject to some morphophonetic variation:&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.96-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Future tense intransitive verbs are formed by the addition of suffixes to the verb stem:&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.100-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The future tense of transitive verbs, however, is formed by the addition of suffixes which agree with both the subject and direct object according to number, in a complex fashion:&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.103.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aspect====
There are two main [[Grammatical aspect|aspectual]] distinctions in Kashmiri, perfective and imperfective.  Both employ a [[Participle|participle]] formed by the addition of a suffix to the verb stem, as well as the fully conjugated auxiliary ''āsun'' (“to be”) which agrees according to gender, number and person with the object (for transitive verbs) or the subject (for intransitive verbs).&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the auxiliary, the participle suffix used with the '''perfective''' aspect (expressing completed or concluded action) agrees in gender and number with the object (for transitive verbs) or subject (for intransitives) as illustrated below:&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.105.&lt;/ref&gt;
::{| class="wikitable"

|-
|          ||mut||-mɨt’||-mɨts||-matsɨ	
|}

The '''imperfective''' (expressing habitual or progressive action) is simpler, taking the participle suffix -ān in all forms, with only the auxiliary showing agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.107.&lt;/ref&gt;  A type of [[Iterative aspect|iterative]] aspect can be expressed by [[Reduplication|reduplicating]] the imperfective participle.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.108.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Pronouns===
[[Pronoun|Pronouns]] are declined according to person, gender, number and case, although only third person pronouns are overtly gendered.  Also in third person, a distinction is made between three degrees of proximity, called proximate, remote I and remote II.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.53.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a dedicated genitive pronoun set, in contrast to the way that the genitive is constructed adverbially elsewhere.  As with future tense, these forms agree with both the subject and direct object in person and number.&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adjectives===
There are two kinds of adjectives in Kashmiri, those which agree with their referent noun (according to case, gender and number) and those which are not declined at all.&lt;ref&gt;''Koshur'' 2002, pp.79.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most adjectives are declined, and generally take the same endings and gender-specific stem changes as nouns.&lt;ref&gt;Wade 1888, pp.19.&lt;/ref&gt;  The declinable adjective endings are provided in the table below, using the adjective ''wozul'' (“red”):&lt;ref&gt;Wade 1888, pp.20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koul and Wali 2006, pp.59.&lt;/ref&gt;
::{| class="wikitable"
|-
|          ||'''Masc. Sing.'''||'''Fem. Sing.'''||'''Masc. Pl.'''||'''Fem. Pl.'''
|-
|'''Nom.'''||wozul||wozaj||wozal||wozaji

|-
|'''Abl.'''||wozalis||wozaji||wozalav||wozalav
|-
|'''Voc.'''||wozaliā||wozaj||wozalav||wozalav
|}

Among those adjectives which are not declined are adjectives ending in -lad or -a, adjectives borrowed from other languages, and a few isolated irregulars.&lt;ref&gt;Wade 1888, pp.20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The comparative and superlative forms of adjectives are formed with the words ''tsor'' (“more”) and ''sitha'' (“most”), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Wade 1888, pp.21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==
There are minor differences between the Kashmiri spoken by Hindus and Muslims.&lt;ref name="ref16muduc"&gt;{{Citation | title=Concise encyclopedia of languages of the world | author=Keith Brown, Sarah Ogilvie | publisher=Elsevier, 2008 | isbn=978-0-08-087774-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F2SRqDzB50wC | quote=''...  Kashmiri occupies a special position in the Dardic group, being probably the only dardic language that has a written literature dating back to the early 13th century ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 'fire', a traditional Hindu will use the word ''agun'' while a Muslim more often will use the Arabic word ''nar''.&lt;ref name="Kasref"&gt;{{cite book |title= Kundalini: The Evolutionary Energy in Man |last= Krishna |first= Gopi |authorlink= Gopi Krishna (yogi) |coauthors= |year= 1967 |publisher= Shambhala |location= Boston |isbn= 978-1-57062-280-9 |page= 212 |url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/7577310/KUNDALINI-the-evolutionary-energy-in-man }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preservation of old Indo-Aryan vocabulary===
Kashmiri retains several features of [[Old Indo-Aryan]] that have been lost in other modern Indo-Aryan languages such as Hindi-Urdu, Punjabi and Sindhi.&lt;ref name="ref41yomid"&gt;{{Citation | title=The Literary Heritage of Kashmir | author=K.L. Kalla | publisher=Mittal Publications | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzozRa9wJ9kC | quote=''... Kashmiri alone of all the modern Indian languages preserves the dvi (Kashmiri du) of Sanskrit, in numbers such as dusatath (Sanskrit dvisaptati), dunamat (Sanskrit dvanavatih) ... the latter (Yodvai) is archaic and is to be come across mainly in the Vedas ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some vocabulary features that Kashmiri preserves clearly date from the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] era and had already been lost even in Classical Sanskrit. This includes the word-form ''yodvai'' (meaning ''if''), which is mainly found in Vedic Sanskrit texts. Classical Sanskrit and modern Indo-Aryan use instead the word ''yadi''.&lt;ref name="ref41yomid"/&gt;

===First person pronoun===
Both the Indo-Aryan and Iranian branches of the Indo-Iranian family have demonstrated a strong tendency to eliminate the distinctive first person pronoun ("I") used in the nominative (subject) case. The [[Proto-Indo-European pronouns|Indo-European root]] for this is reconstructed as *eǵHom, which is preserved in Sanskrit as ''aham'' and in Avestan Persian as ''azam''. This contrasts with the ''m-'' form ("me", "my") that is used for the accusative, genitive, dative, ablative cases. Sanskrit and Avestan both used forms such as ''ma(-m)''. However, in languages such as Modern Persian, Baluchi, Hindi and Punjabi, the distinct nominative form has been entirely lost and replaced with ''m-'' in words such as ''ma-n'' and ''mai''. However, Kashmiri belongs to a relatively small set that preserves the distinction. 'I' is ''ba/bi/bo'' in various Kashmiri dialects, distinct from the other ''me'' terms. 'Mine' is ''myoon'' in Kashmiri. Other Indo-Aryan languages that preserve this feature include [[Dogri]] (''aun'' vs ''me-''), [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] (''hu-n'' vs ''ma-ri''), [[Konkani language|Konkani]] (''hā̃v'' vs ''mhazo''), and [[Braj Bhasa|Braj]] (''hau-M'' vs ''mai-M''). The Iranian [[Pashto language|Pashto]] preserves it too (''za'' vs. ''maa'').&lt;ref name="ref48bubag"&gt;{{Citation | title=In hot pursuit of language in prehistory: essays in the four fields of anthropology | author=John D. Bengtson, Harold Crane Fleming | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2008 | isbn=978-90-272-3252-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxcdjUGfx40C | quote=''... However, Gujarati as well as a Dardic language like Kashmiri still preserve the root alternation between subject and non-subject forms (but they replaced the derivative of the Sanskrit subject form ahám by new forms) ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaisms===

Kashmiri, as also the other Dardic languages, shows important divergences from the Indo-Aryan mainstream. One is the partial maintenance of the three sibilant consonants ''s ṣ ś'' of the Old Indo-Aryan period. For another example, the prefixing form of the number 'two', which is found in Sanskrit as ''dvi-'', has developed into ''ba-/bi-'' in most other Indo-Aryan languages, but ''du-'' in Kashmiri (preserving the original dental stop ''d''). ''Seventy-two'' is ''dusatath'' in Kashmiri, ''bahattar'' in Hindi-Urdu and Punjabi, and ''dvisaptati'' in Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="ref41yomid"/&gt;

Certain features in Kashmiri even appear to stem from Indo-Aryan even predating the Vedic period. For instance, there was an /s/ &gt; /h/ consonant shift in some words that had already occurred with Vedic Sanskrit (this tendency is even stronger in the Iranian branch of Indo-Iranian), yet is lacking in Kashmiri equivalents. The word ''rahit'' in Vedic Sanskrit and modern Hindi-Urdu (meaning 'excluding' or 'without') corresponds to ''rost'' in Kashmiri. Similarly, ''sahit'' (meaning 'including' or 'with') corresponds to ''sost'' in Kashmiri.&lt;ref name="ref41yomid"/&gt;

==Writing system==
{{Arabic-script sidebar|Kashmiri}}

There are three [[orthography|orthographical systems]] used to write the Kashmiri language: the [[Sharada script]], the [[Devanagari script]] and the [[Perso-Arabic script]].  The [[Roman script]] is also sometimes informally used to write Kashmiri, especially online.&lt;ref name="Mouton de Gruyter"/&gt;

The Kashmiri language is traditionally written in the [[Sharada script]] after the 8th Century A.D.&lt;ref name="Sharada"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ancientscripts.com/sarada.html|title = Sarada|publisher = Lawrence|accessdate = 2007-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This script however, is not in common use today, except for religious ceremonies of the [[Kashmiri Pandit]]s.&lt;ref name="KOA-Sharada"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.koausa.org/Languages/Sharda.html|title = The Sharada Script: Origin and Development|publisher = Kashmiri Overseas Association|accessdate = 2009-07-07|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100107211343/http://www.koausa.org/Languages/Sharda.html|archivedate = 7 January 2010|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today it is written in Perso-Arabic and Devanagari scripts (with some modifications).&lt;ref name="Omniglot-Kashmiri"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.omniglot.com/writing/kashmiri.htm|title=Kashmiri (कॉशुर / كٲشُر)|publisher = Omniglot|accessdate = 2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among languages written in the Perso-Arabic script, Kashmiri is one of the [[Perso-Arabic script|very few]] which regularly indicates all vowel sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The World's Writing Systems  | year=1996 | last=Daniels &amp; Bright |pages=753–754 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kashmiri Perso-Arabic script has come to be associated with Kashmiri Muslims, while the Kashmiri Devanagari script has come to be associated with the Kashmiri Hindu community.&lt;ref name="Indian Express-Perso-Arabic"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.indianexpress.com/news/valley-divide-impacts-kashmiri-pandit-youth/472872/|title = Valley divide impacts Kashmiri, Pandit youth switch to Devnagari|publisher = Indian Express|accessdate = 2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KOA-Devanagari"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.koausa.org/Languages/devan1.html|title = Devnagari Script for Kashmiri: A Study in its Necessity, Feasibility and Practicality|publisher = Kashmiri Overseas Association|accessdate = 2009-07-07|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090103030935/http://www.koausa.org/Languages/devan1.html|archivedate = 3 January 2009|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Junior-Jaguar-Belize-Zoo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[jaguar]], a keystone, [[flagship species|flagship]], and [[umbrella species]], and an [[apex predator]]]]
A '''keystone species''' is a [[species]] that has a disproportionately large effect on its [[natural environment|environment]] relative to its abundance. Such species are described as playing a critical role in maintaining the structure of an [[ecological community]], affecting many other [[organism]]s in an [[ecosystem]] and helping to determine the types and numbers of various other species in the community. A keystone species is a plant or animal that plays a unique and crucial role in the way an ecosystem functions. Without keystone species, the ecosystem would be dramatically different or cease to exist altogether. Some keystone species, such as the wolf, are also [[apex predator]]s.

The role that a keystone species plays in its ecosystem is analogous to the role of a [[keystone (architecture)|keystone]] in an [[arch]]. While the keystone is under the least pressure of any of the stones in an arch, the arch still collapses without it. Similarly, an ecosystem may experience a dramatic shift if a keystone species is removed, even though that species was a small part of the ecosystem by measures of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] or [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]].
It became a popular concept in [[conservation biology]], alongside [[flagship species|flagship]] and [[umbrella species]]. Although the concept is valued as a descriptor for particularly strong inter-species interactions, and it has allowed easier communication between ecologists and conservation policy-makers, it has been criticized for oversimplifying complex ecological systems.

The concept of the keystone species was introduced in 1969 by the zoologist [[Robert T. Paine (zoologist)|Robert T. Paine]].&lt;ref name="paine1969"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paine, R. T. |year=1969 |title=A Note on Trophic Complexity and Community Stability |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=103 |issue=929 |pages=91–93 |doi=10.1086/282586 |jstor=2459472}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Keystone Species Hypothesis |url=http://www.washington.edu/research/pathbreakers/1969g.html | publisher=University of Washington | accessdate=2011-02-03| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110060757/http://www.washington.edu/research/pathbreakers/1969g.html| archivedate=2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paine developed the concept to explain his observations and experiments on the relationships between [[marine invertebrate]]s of the [[intertidal zone]] (between the high and low tide lines), including [[starfish]] and [[mussel]]s. He removed the starfish from an area, and documented the effects on the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="mills1993"/&gt; In his 1966 paper, ''Food Web Complexity and Species Diversity'', Paine had described such a system in [[Neah Bay, Washington|Makah Bay]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref name="paine1966"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paine, R.

In his 1969 paper, Paine proposed the keystone species concept, using ''[[Pisaster ochraceus]]'', a species of starfish, and ''[[Mytilus californianus]]'', a species of mussel, as a primary example.&lt;ref name="paine1969"/&gt; The concept became popular in conservation, and was deployed in a range of contexts and mobilized to engender support for conservation, especially where human activities had damaged ecosystems, such as by removing keystone predators.&lt;ref name="Barua Metaphor"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Barua | first=Maan | title=Mobilizing metaphors: the popular use of keystone, flagship and umbrella species concepts | journal=Biodiversity and Conservation| volume=20 | issue=7 | year=2011 | doi=10.1007/s10531-011-0035-y | pages=1427–1440}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=HHMI |first=BioInteractive |title=Some Animals Are More Equal than Others: Keystone Species and Trophic Cascades – HHMI (2016) |url=http://naturedocumentaries.org/14877/animals-equal-others-keystone-species-trophic-cascades-hhmi-2016/ |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
A keystone species was defined by Paine as a [[species]] that has a disproportionately large effect on its [[natural environment|environment]] relative to its abundance.&lt;ref name="paine1995"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paine, R. T. |year=1995 |title=A Conversation on Refining the Concept of Keystone Species |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=962–964 |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09040962.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined operationally by R. D. Davic in 2003 as "a strongly interacting species whose top-down effect on [[biodiversity|species diversity]] and [[competition (biology)|competition]] is large relative to its [[biomass]] dominance within a functional group."&lt;ref name=Davic2003&gt;{{cite web | title=Linking Keystone Species and Functional Groups: A New Operational Definition of the Keystone Species Concept| url=http://www.consecol.org/vol7/iss1/resp11/ | author=Davic, Robert D. | publisher=Conservation Ecology | year=2003 | accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic keystone species is a [[predator]] that prevents a particular [[herbivorous]] species from eliminating dominant [[plant]] species. If prey numbers are low, keystone predators can be even less abundant and still be effective. Yet without the predators, the herbivorous prey would explode in numbers, wipe out the dominant plants, and dramatically alter the character of the ecosystem. The exact scenario changes in each example, but the central idea remains that through a chain of interactions, a non-abundant species has an outsized impact on ecosystem functions. For example, the herbivorous [[weevil]] ''[[Euhrychiopsis lecontei]]'' is thought to have keystone effects on aquatic plant diversity by foraging on nuisance [[Myriophyllum spicatum|Eurasian watermilfoil]] in North American waters.&lt;ref name="creed2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Creed, R. P., Jr. |year=2000 |title=Is there a new keystone species in North American lakes and rivers? |journal=OIKOS |volume=91 |issue=2 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.910222.x |page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the wasp species ''[[Agelaia vicina]]'' has been labeled a keystone species for its unparalleled nest size, colony size, and high rate of brood production. The diversity of its prey and the quantity necessary to sustain its high rate of growth have a direct impact on other species around it.&lt;ref name="paine1995"/&gt;

The keystone concept is defined by its ecological effects, and these in turn make it important for conservation. In this it overlaps with several other species conservation concepts such as [[flagship species]], [[indicator species]], and [[umbrella species]]. For example, the [[jaguar]] is a charismatic big cat which meets all of these definitions:&lt;ref name=Maehr2001&gt;{{cite book |last1=Maehr |first1=David |last2=Noss |first2=Reed F. |last3=Larkin |first3=Jeffery L. |title=Large Mammal Restoration: Ecological And Sociological Challenges In The 21St Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x3n_pBQFxVQC&amp;pg=PA73 |year=2001 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-1-55963-817-3 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The jaguar is an umbrella species, flagship species, and wilderness quality indicator. It promotes the goals of carnivore recovery, protecting and restoring connectivity through Madrean woodland and riparian areas, and protecting and restoring riparian areas. ...

==Predators==

===Sea otters and kelp forests===
{{Double image|right|Seaurchin 300.jpg|150|Mother sea otter with rare twin baby pups (9137174915).jpg|204|Sea urchins like this [[Strongylocentrotus purpuratus|purple sea urchin]] can damage kelp forests by chewing through kelp [[holdfast]]s|The [[sea otter]] is an important predator of [[sea urchin]]s, making it a keystone species for the kelp forests.}}

[[Sea otters]] protect [[kelp forest]]s from damage by sea urchins. When the sea otters of the North American west coast were hunted commercially for their fur, their numbers fell to such low levels – fewer than 1000 in the north Pacific ocean – that they were unable to control the sea urchin population. The urchins in turn grazed the [[holdfast]]s of [[kelp]] so heavily that the kelp forests largely disappeared, along with all the species that depended on them. Reintroducing the sea otters has enabled the kelp ecosystem to be restored. For example, in Southeast Alaska some 400 sea otters were released, and they have bred to form a population approaching 25,000.&lt;ref name="Szpak2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Szpak | first=Paul | last2=Orchard | first2=Trevor J. | last3=Salomon | first3=Anne K. | last4=Gröcke | first4=Darren R. | title=Regional ecological variability and impact of the maritime fur trade on nearshore ecosystems in southern Haida Gwaii (British Columbia, Canada): evidence from stable isotope analysis of rockfish (Sebastes spp.) bone collagen | journal=Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences | volume=5 | issue=2 | year=2013 | doi=10.1007/s12520-013-0122-y | pages=159–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="estes1978"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Estes |first=James E. |author2=Smith, Norman S. |author3=Palmisano, John F. |year=1978 |title=Sea otter predation and community organization in the Western Aleutian Islands, Alaska|journal=Ecology |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=822–833 |doi=10.2307/1938786 |publisher=Ecology |jstor=1938786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cohn1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cohn, J.

===The wolf, Yellowstone's apex predator===

{{further|Apex predator}}

Keystone predators may increase the [[biodiversity]] of communities by preventing a single species from becoming dominant. They can have a profound influence on the balance of organisms in a particular [[ecosystem]]. Introduction or removal of this predator, or changes in its population density, can have drastic cascading effects on the equilibrium of many other populations in the ecosystem. For example, grazers of a grassland may prevent a single dominant species from taking over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Botkin, D. |author2=Keller, E. |date=2003 |title=Environmental Science: Earth as a living planet |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-38914-9 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elimination of the [[gray wolf]] from [[Yellowstone National Park]] had profound impacts on the [[trophic pyramid]]. Without predation, herbivores began to over-graze many woody browse species, affecting the area's plant populations. In addition, wolves often kept animals from grazing in riparian areas, which protected beavers from having their food sources encroached upon. The removal of wolves had a direct effect on beaver populations, as their habitat became territory for grazing. Increased browsing on willows and conifers along Blacktail Creek due to a lack of predation caused channel incision because the beavers helped slow the water down, allowing soil to stay in place. Furthermore, predation keeps hydrological features such as creeks and streams in normal working order. When wolves were reintroduced, the beaver population and the whole riparian ecosystem recovered dramatically within a few years.&lt;ref name="Ripple2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ripple | first=William J. | last2=Beschta | first2=Robert L. | title=Wolves and the Ecology of Fear: Can Predation Risk Structure Ecosystems? | journal=BioScience | publisher=Oxford University Press  | volume=54 | issue=8 | year=2004 | doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0755:WATEOF]2.0.CO;2 | page=755 |url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/54/8/755/238242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sea stars and other non-apex predators===

As described by Paine in 1966, some [[sea stars]] (e.g., ''[[Pisaster ochraceus]]'') may prey on [[sea urchin]]s, [[mussel]]s, and other [[shellfish]] that have no other natural predators. If the sea star is removed from the ecosystem, the mussel population explodes uncontrollably, driving out most other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paine, R. T. |date=1966 |title=Food web complexity and species diversity |journal=American Naturalist |volume=100 |pages=65–75 |jstor=2459379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These creatures need not be [[apex predator]]s. Sea stars are prey for [[sharks]], [[Ray (fish)|rays]], and [[sea anemones]]. Sea otters are prey for [[orca]].&lt;ref name="estes1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Estes, J. A. |author2=Tinker, M. T. |author3=Williams, T. M. |author4= Doak, D. F. |date=1998-10-16 |title=Killer whale predation on sea otters linking oceanic and nearshore ecosystems |journal=Science |volume=282 |issue=5388 |pages=473–476 |doi=10.1126/science.282.5388.473 |bibcode=1998Sci...282..473E |pmid=9774274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[jaguar]], whose numbers in Central and South America have been classified as [[near threatened]], acts as a keystone predator by its widely varied diet, helping to balance the [[mammalian]] jungle ecosystem with its consumption of 87 different species of prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Nowell, K. |editor2=Jackson, P. |date=1996 |work=Wild Cats, Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |publisher=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=''Panthera onca'' |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |pages=118–122 |url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/6998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[lion]] is another keystone species.&lt;ref name="HaleKoprowski2018"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hale | first=Sarah L. | last2=Koprowski | first2=John L. | title=Ecosystem-level effects of keystone species reintroduction: a literature review | journal=Restoration Ecology | date=February 2018 | doi=10.1111/rec.12684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Banksia prionotes 3 gnangarra.jpg|thumb|Acorn banksia, ''[[Banksia prionotes]]'', is the sole source of nectar for important [[pollinator]]s, [[honeyeater]]s.]]

==Mutualists==

Keystone mutualists are organisms that participate in mutually beneficial interactions, the loss of which would have a profound impact upon the ecosystem as a whole. For example, in the [[Avon Wheatbelt]] region of [[Western Australia]], there is a period of each year when ''[[Banksia prionotes]]'' (acorn banksia) is the sole source of [[nectar]] for [[honeyeater]]s, which play an important role in [[pollination]] of numerous plant species. Therefore, the loss of this one species of tree would probably cause the honeyeater population to collapse, with profound implications for the entire ecosystem. Another example is [[frugivores]] such as the [[cassowary]], which spreads the seeds of many different trees, and some will not grow unless they have been through a cassowary.&lt;ref name="Lambeck 1999"&gt;{{cite paper | title=Landscape Planning for Biodiversity Conservation in Agricultural Regions: A Case Study from the Wheatbelt of Western Australia | version=Biodiversity Technical Paper No. 2 | first=Robert J. | last=Lambeck | publisher=[[CSIRO]] Division of Wildlife and Ecology | year=1999 |isbn=978-0-642-21423-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker 1995"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Conserving Biological Diversity through Ecosystem Resilience | first=Brian | last=Walker | journal=Conservation Biology | volume=9 | issue=4 | year=1995 | pages=747–752 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09040747.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineers==
[[File:PrairieDogTownGregg.jpg|thumb|left|[[Prairie dog]] town. Drawing by [[Josiah Gregg]], 1844]]
{{further|Ecosystem engineer}}

A term used alongside keystone is [[ecosystem engineer]].&lt;ref name="Barua Metaphor"/&gt; In [[North America]], the [[prairie dog]] is an ecosystem engineer. Prairie dog burrows provide the nesting areas for [[mountain plover]]s and [[burrowing owl]]s. Prairie dog tunnel systems also help channel rainwater into the [[water table]] to prevent [[surface runoff|runoff]] and [[erosion]], and can also serve to change the composition of the soil in a region by increasing aeration and reversing soil compaction that can be a result of cattle grazing. Prairie dogs also trim the vegetation around their colonies, perhaps to remove any cover for predators.&lt;ref name="NGPC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngpc.state.ne.us/wildlife/prairiedogs.asp  |title=Prairie Dogs |website=Wildlife Species Guide |publisher=Nebraska Game and Park Commission |accessdate=10 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819031734/http://www.ngpc.state.ne.us/wildlife/prairiedogs.asp |archivedate=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grazing species such as [[plains bison]], [[pronghorn]], and [[mule deer]] have shown a proclivity for grazing on the same land used by prairie dogs.&lt;ref name="Rosmarino2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prairiedogcoalition.org/pd-associated-species.php |author=Rosmarino, Nicole |year=2007 |title=Associated Species : Prairie Dogs are a Keystone Species of the Great Plains |publisher=Prairie Dog Coalition |accessdate=10 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110163932/http://www.prairiedogcoalition.org/pd-associated-species.php |archivedate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BeaverDam 8409.jpg|thumb|Beaver dam, an [[structures built by animals|animal construction]] which has a transformative effect on the environment]]

The [[beaver]] is a well known ecosystem engineer and keystone species. It transforms its territory from a stream to a pond or swamp. Beavers affect the environment first altering the edges of [[riparian]] areas by cutting down older trees to use for their dams. This allows younger trees to take their place. Beaver dams alter the riparian area they are established in. Depending on topography, soils, and many factors, these dams change the riparian edges of streams and rivers into wetlands, meadows, or riverine forests. These dams have been shown to be beneficial to a myriad of species including amphibians, salmon, and song birds.&lt;ref name="wright2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wright, J. P. |author2=Jones, C. G. |author3=Flecker, A. S. |year=2002 |title=An ecosystem engineer, the beaver, increases species richness at the landscape scale |journal=Oecologia |volume=132 |issue=1 |pages=96–101 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/0637GF0979LRU90J.pdf |doi=10.1007/s00442-002-0929-1|pmid=28547281 |bibcode=2002Oecol.132...96W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the African [[savanna]], the larger herbivores, especially the [[elephants]], shape their environment. The elephants destroy trees, making room for the grass species. Without these animals, much of the savanna would turn into [[woodland]].&lt;ref name="leakey1995"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leakey |first1=Richard |author1link=Richard Leakey |first2=Roger |last2=Lewin |author2link=Roger Lewin |title=The sixth extinction: biodiversity and its survival |year=1999 |publisher=Phoenix |isbn=1-85799-473-6 |pages=216–217 |chapter=11 The modern elephant story |origyear=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian studies have found that [[parrotfish]] on the [[Great Barrier Reef]] are the only reef fish that consistently scrape and clean the coral on the reef. Without these animals, the Great Barrier Reef would be under severe strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gruber, Karl |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2014/09/single-keystone-species-may-be-key-to-reef-health/ |title=Single keystone species may be the key to reef health |publisher=Australian Geographic |date=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==

Although the concept of the keystone species has a value in describing particularly strong inter-species interactions, and for allowing easier communication between ecologists and conservation policy-makers, it has been criticized by L. S. Mills and colleagues for oversimplifying complex ecological systems. The term has been applied widely in different ecosystems and to predators, prey, and plants (primary producers), inevitably with differing ecological meanings. For instance, removing a predator may allow other animals to increase to the point where they wipe out other species; removing a prey species may cause predator populations to crash, or may allow predators to drive other prey species to extinction; and removing a plant species may result in the loss of animals that depend on it, like [[pollinator]]s and seed dispersers. Beavers too have been called keystone, not for eating other species but for modifying the environment in ways that affected other species. The term has thus been given quite different meanings in different cases. In Mills's view, Paine's work showed that a few species could sometimes have extremely strong interactions within a particular ecosystem, but that does not automatically imply that other ecosystems have a similar structure.&lt;ref name="mills1993"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mills, L. S. |author2=Soule, M. E. |author3=Doak, D. F. |year=1993 |title=The Keystone-Species Concept in Ecology and Conservation |journal=BioScience |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=219–224 |doi=10.2307/1312122 |jstor=1312122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fixed telephone lines per 100 inhabitants 1997-2007 ITU.png|thumb|Fixed telephone lines per 100 inhabitants: 1997–2007]]

A '''landline telephone''' (also known as '''land line''', '''land-line''', '''main line''', '''home phone''', '''landline''', '''fixed-line''', and '''wireline''') is a [[telephone|phone]] that uses a [[wire|metal wire]] or [[optical fiber]] [[telephone line]] for transmission as distinguished from a [[cellular network|mobile cellular line]], which uses [[radio waves]] for transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The World Factbook:REFERENCES :: DEFINITIONS AND NOTES |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html?fieldkey=2150&amp;term=Telephones%20-%20fixed%20lines |website=www.cia.gov |accessdate=11 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2003, the [[CIA World Factbook]] reported approximately 1.263 billion main [[telephone]] lines worldwide. [[China]] had more than any other country at 350 million and the [[United States]] was second with 268 million. The [[United Kingdom]] had 23.7 million residential fixed home phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UK households: ownership of landline telephones 1970-2017 {{!}} Survey |url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/289158/telephone-presence-in-households-in-the-uk/ |website=Statista |accessdate=11 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 statistics show that the total number of fixed-telephone subscribers in the world was about 1.16 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/statistics/2014/Fixed_tel_2000-2013.xls |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121092249/http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/statistics/2014/Fixed_tel_2000-2013.xls |archivedate=2014-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of landline subscribers continuously decreases due to upgrades in digital technology and the conveniences that come with switching to wireless (cellular) or Internet-based alternatives.

== Fixed phone ==
[[File:Intercomblack.jpg|thumb|A fixed-line telephone on a desk]]
A '''fixed phone''' line (a line that is not a [[cellular network|mobile phone]] line) can be [[wire|hard-wired]] or [[cordless telephone|cordless]] and typically refers to the operation of wireless devices or systems in fixed locations such as homes. Fixed wireless devices usually derive their electrical power from the utility mains electricity, unlike mobile wireless or portable wireless, which tend to be [[battery-power]]ed. Although mobile and portable systems can be used in fixed locations, efficiency and bandwidth are compromised compared with fixed systems. Mobile or portable, battery-powered wireless systems can be used as emergency backups for fixed systems in case of a power blackout or natural disaster.

== Dedicated lines ==
The term '''landline''' is also used to describe a connection between two or more points that consists of a dedicated physical cable, as opposed to an always-available private link that is actually implemented as a circuit in a wired switched system (usually the [[public switched telephone network]]). So-called [[leased line]]s are invariably of the latter type; the implications of a land line in this context are security and [[survivability]]. For example, a military headquarters might be linked to front-line units "by landline" to ensure that communication remains possible even if the conventional telephone network is damaged or destroyed. Another example of this is in airports. All air traffic control towers have dedicated lines connected to the police, fire department, hospitals, army, etc. Deployed as a precaution in case of emergency, these can be used at any time.

===Landlines in developing countries===
[[File:How mobile phones are overtaking landlines in Africa.jpg|thumb|right|Landline vs. Mobile phones in Africa: 1998–2008]]
In many countries the landline has not been readily available to most people. In some countries in Africa, the rise in cell phones has outpaced any rise in landline telephones. Between 1998 and 2008, Africa added only 2.4 million landlines.&lt;ref name="ref 9"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aker |first1=Jenny C |last2=Mbiti |first2=Isaac M |title=Mobile Phones and Economic Development in Africa |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |date=August 2010 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=207–209 |doi=10.1257/jep.24.3.207 |url=http://sites.tufts.edu/jennyaker/files/2010/09/aker_mobileafrica.pdf |accessdate=11 November 2018 |language=en |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this same time the number of mobile phone lines that have been subscribed to has skyrocketed.  Between 2000 and 2008, cell phone use has risen from fewer than 2 in 100 people to 33 out of 100.&lt;ref name="ref 9"/&gt;  It is more difficult to install landline copper wires to every user, than it is to install mobile wireless towers that people can connect to from anywhere.  There has also been substantial decline of landline phones in Indian [[subcontinent]], in urban and even more in rural areas. 

===Future of the landline===
In the early [[21st century]], the landline telephone has declined due to the advancement of mobile network technology and the obsolescence of the old copper wire networking.  Eventually these metallic networks will be deemed completely out of date and replaced by more efficient broadband and fiber optic landline connections extending to [[Rural area|rural areas]] and places where telecommunication was much more sparse. Some see this happening as soon as the year 2025.&lt;ref name="ref 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14213965|title=The decline of the landline: Unwired – The Economist|work=The Economist|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108091900/http://www.economist.com/node/14213965|archivedate=2013-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, only about 45% of people in the United States between the ages of 12 and 17 owned cell phones.  At that time, they had to rely on landline telephones.  In just 4 years' time, that percentage climbed to about 71%.  That same year, 2008, about 77% of adults owned a mobile phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Amanda |first1=Lenhart |title=Teens and Mobile Phones Over the Past Five Years: Pew Internet Looks Back |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2009/PIP%20Teens%20and%20Mobile%20Phones%20Data%20Memo.pdf |website=www.pewinternet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the year 2013, 91% of adults in the United States owned a mobile phone.  Almost 60% of those with a mobile had a [[smartphone]].&lt;ref name="ref 3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewinternet.org/Commentary/2012/February/Pew-Internet-Mobile.aspx|title=Mobile Technology Fact Sheet|date=27 December 2013|work=Pew Research Center's Internet &amp; American Life Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; A National Health Interview Survey of 19,956 households by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] released May 4, 2017 showed only 45.9 percent of U.S. households still had landlines, while 50.8 percent had only [[Mobile phone|cell phones]]. Over 39 percent had both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/milestone-for-cellphones-vs-landline-phones/|title=Milestone for cellphones vs. landline phones|work=[[CBS News]]|date=4 May 2017|accessdate=30 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616002951/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/milestone-for-cellphones-vs-landline-phones/|archivedate=16 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, more than one in five of households use cell phones as their only source for telephone service. In 2013, statistics showed that 21% of households claimed to only use cellular phones. Households that are owned by members under the age of 35 have a considerably higher percentage of exclusive cell phone use. In 2013,  60% of young household owners claimed to only use cell phones.&lt;ref name="statcan.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/140623/dq140623a-eng.htm|title=The Daily — Residential Telephone Service Survey, 2013|publisher=Statistics Canada|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023181115/http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/140623/dq140623a-eng.htm|archivedate=2014-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many of the consumer protections which regulators apply to incumbent landline providers, such as restrictions against cutting off subscribers without notice, do not apply to competing communication services such as [[cable modem]]s and [[voice over IP]].

'''Limi''' ([[Exonym and endonym|autonym]]: ''li33 mi33''&lt;ref name="Yang2017"/&gt;) is a [[Loloish languages|Loloish]] language spoken in Yongde, Fengqing, and Yun counties of western [[Yunnan]] province, China.

==Distribution==
Limi is spoken in the following locations.&lt;ref name="AsiaHarvest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiaharvest.org/index.php/people-group-profiles/china/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801062653/http://asiaharvest.org/index.php/people-group-profiles/china/ |archivedate=2013-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yang (2017)&lt;ref name="Yang2017"&gt;Yang, Cathryn. 2017. "[https://www.academia.edu/34535383/INTRODUCING_LIMI_A_RISING_TONE_IS_BORN Introducing Limi: a rising tone is born]". In ''Sociohistorical Linguistics in Southeast Asia: New Horizons for Tibeto-Burman Studies in honor of David Bradley''. Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; reports that Limi is spoken by about 20,000 people in Yongde, Fengqing, and Yun counties. Limi speakers make up 70% of the 26,000 people living in Wumulong Township (乌木龙乡), [[Yongde County]], Yunnan. About 2,600 members of a nearby ethnic group called "Luo" (倮族) (likely [[Lolopo language|Lolopo]]) also live in and around Wumulong.&lt;ref name="Yang2017"/&gt;

==Classification==
Limi is likely most closely related to [[Lolopo language|Lolopo]], but also has many [[Lalo language|Lalo]] loanwords.&lt;ref name="Yang2017"/&gt;

==History==
Limi speakers likely migrated from [[Jingdong County]] during the early 1300s, first arriving in Bangmai Village (邦卖/班卖), [[Fengqing County]], and then later migrating to Wumulong Township, Yongde County.&lt;ref name="Yang2017"/&gt;

'''Lugbara''' is the language of the [[Lugbara people]]. It is spoken in the [[West Nile sub-region|West Nile]] region in northwestern [[Uganda]], as well as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]'s [[Orientale Province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Gordon|first=Raymond|title=Lugbara language|encyclopedia=Ethnologue: Languages of the World|publisher=SIL International|location=Dallas, Texas|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=lgg|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification and dialects==
The [[Aringa language]], also known as Low Lugbara, is closely related, and sometimes considered a dialect of Lugbara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|first=Douglas|last=Boone|first2=Richard|last2=Watson|year=1999|url=http://www.sil.org/silesr/1999/001/mmsurvey-w97.pdf|title=Moru–Ma'di Survey Report|series=SIL Electronic Survey Reports SILESR 1999-001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars classify the Lugbara language itself as a dialect of the [[Madi language (Sudan and Uganda)|Ma'di language]], though this is not generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackings|first=Mairi|author2=Nigel Fabb |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|isbn=3-11-017940-7|year=2003|title=A Grammar of Ma'di|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An SIL survey report concluded that the Okollo, Ogoko, and Rigbo dialects, called "Southern Ma'di", should be classified as dialects of Lugbara.

==Orthography==
Lugbara was first written by [[Mission (Christian)|Christian missionaries]] in 1918, based on the Ayivu dialect. In 2000, a conference was held in the city of [[Arua]] in northwestern Uganda regarding the creation of a standardised international [[orthography]] for Lugbara.&lt;ref name="Fonseca"/&gt;

==In education==
In 1992, the [[Government of Uganda]] designated it as one of five "languages of wider communication" to be used as the [[medium of instruction]] in primary education; however, unlike the other four such languages, it was never actually used in schools.&lt;ref name="Fonseca"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Writing unwritten languages|publisher=UNESCO|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/files/16455/10893858671Writing_unwritten_languages.doc/Writing_unwritten_languages.doc|last=Da Fonseca|first=N.}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently it was included in the curriculum for some secondary schools in the West Nile region, including St. Joseph's College Ombaci and Muni Girls Secondary School, both in [[Arua District]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Pronunciation guide==
Lugbara phrases are spoken in several dialects (clan-wise) but the Muni (Ayivu) version, from which many of the explanations below are based, is the one approved for teaching in schools. The language has diphthong clusters and other noteworthy phonetics including the following:

'''aa''' as in ''bat'', for example '''embataa'''

'''c''' as in ''church'', for example '''Candiru''' (which is also spelt Chandiru)

'''dj''' as in ''jilt'', for example '''odji''', the ‘d’ is silent

'''ee''' as in ''emblem'', for example '''Andree'''

'''gb''' as in ''bend'', for example '''gbe''', the ‘g’ is silent. Gb in Lugbara does not have an equivalent in English.What stands out in these Sudanic languages is the special manner in which 'kp, gb, 'd, 'b, 'y, 'w are pronounced.

'''i''' as in ''inn'', for example '''di-i'''

'''oa''' as in ''oar'', for example '''Adroa'''

'''oo''' as in ''old'', for example '''ocoo''', less often '''oo''' as in food, for example '''‘doo'''

'''uu''' as in ''chew'', for example '''cuu'''

'''z''' as in ''jean'' after '''n''', for example '''onzi'''. Otherwise, most times remains '''z''' as in ''zebra'', for example '''Ozu''' and when the first letter of a word.

==Vocabulary==
The Lugbara alphabet has 28 letters minus ‘q’ and ‘x’ (Alamakanda in [[Aringa language]]), which means 24 like in English and four unique ones namely: ‘b like in '''‘bua''', ‘d like in '''‘dia''', ‘w like in '''‘wara''' and ‘y like in '''‘yetaa'''. Letters are pronounced as follows: Ah, Ba, Cha, Da, Eh, Fa, Ga, Ha, Ie, Ja, Ka, La, Ma, Na, Oh, Pa, Ra, Sa, Ta, Uuw, Va, Wa, Ya, and Za.

Some words are borrowed from other languages, for example '''Safari''' (journey) from Swahili, '''Buku''' (book) from English, '''Kandi''' (ball) from Lingala, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Ngaka|first=Willy|author2=O'du'bua, Edward |author3=Ongua, Paul Iga |publisher=Fountain Publishers|year=2009|title=Lugbara - English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the vocabulary, there are several words that have varied meanings when pronounced differently, for instance '''Oli''' can mean air, wind (also '''Oliriko'''), whistle, cut or roll.

Malayalam is also spoken by linguistic minorities in the neighbouring states; with significant number of speakers in the [[Nilgiris District|Nilgiris]], [[Kanyakumari district|Kanyakumari]] and [[Coimbatore district|Coimbatore]] districts of [[Tamil Nadu]], and [[Kodagu]] and [[Dakshina Kannada]] districts of [[Karnataka]]. Due to Malayali expatriates in the [[Persian Gulf]], the language is also widely spoken in [[Gulf countries]].

The origin of Malayalam remains a matter of dispute among scholars. One view holds that Malayalam and modern [[Tamil language|Tamil]] are offshoots of [[Middle Tamil]] and separated from it sometime after the {{circa|7th century CE}}. A second view argues for the development of the two languages out of "Proto-Dravidian" or "Proto-Tamil-Malayalam" in the prehistoric era.{{sfn|Asher|Kumari|1997|p=xxiv}}&lt;ref&gt;S.V.

The oldest documents written purely in Malayalam and still surviving are the Vazhappalli Copper plates from 832 CE and Tharisapalli Copper plates from 849 CE.

The earliest script used to write Malayalam was the [[Vatteluttu alphabet]], and later the [[Kolezhuthu|Kolezhuttu]], which derived from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c-radhakrishnan.info/alphabet.htm|title=(C.

==Etymology==
The word ''Malayalam'' originated from the words ''mala'', meaning "mountain", and ''alam'', meaning "region" or "-ship" (as in "township"); ''Malayalam'' thus translates directly as "the mountain region." The term originally referred to the land of the [[Chera dynasty]] Tamil dynasty, and only later became the name of its language.&lt;ref name=Clad/&gt; The language Malayalam is alternatively called ''Alealum'', ''Malayalani'', ''Malayali'', ''Malean'', ''Maliyad'', and ''Mallealle''.&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=mal|title=Ethnologue report for language code: mal|publisher=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest extant literary works in the regional language of present-day Kerala probably date back to as early as the 12th century. However, the named identity of this language appears to have come into existence only around the 16th century, when it was known as "Malayayma" or "Malayanma"; the words were also used to refer to the script and the region. The word "Malayalam" was coined in the later period, and the local people referred to their language as both "Tamil" and "Malayalam" until the [[British Raj|colonial period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sheldon Pollock |author2=Arvind Raghunathan Professor of South Asian Studies Sheldon Pollock |title=Literary Cultures in History: Reconstructions from South Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ak9csfpY2WoC&amp;pg=PA442 |date=19 May 2003 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-22821-4 |pages=441–442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==

The generally held view is that Malayalam was the western coastal dialect of Tamil&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dravidian-languages|title=Dravidian languages - History, Grammar, Map, &amp; Facts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and separated from Tamil sometime between the 9th and 13th centuries.{{sfn|Karashima|2014|loc=p. 6|ps=: Other sources date this split to the 7th and 8th centuries.}} Some scholars however believe that both Tamil and Malayalam developed during the prehistoric period from a common ancestor, 'Proto-Tamil-Dravidian', and that the notion of Malayalam being a 'daughter' of Tamil is misplaced.{{sfn|Asher|Kumari|1997|p=xxiv}} This is based on the fact that Malayalam and several Dravidian languages on the western coast have common features which are not found even in the oldest historical forms of Tamil.&lt;ref&gt;A. Govindankutty (1972) - From proto-Tamil-Malayalam to West Coast dialects. Indo-Iranian Journal, Vol. 14 No. (1/2), pp. 52–60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Caldwell]], in his 1856 book "''A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages"'', opined that Malayalam branched from ''Classical Tamil'' and over time gained a large amount of [[Sanskrit]] vocabulary and lost the personal terminations of verbs.&lt;ref name="Clad"&gt;Caldwell, Robert (1875). [https://archive.org/stream/comparativegramm00caldrich#page/ii/mode/2up ''A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages''], second edition. London: Trübner &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; As the language of scholarship and administration, Old-Tamil, which was written in [[Tamil-Brahmi]] and the Vatteluttu alphabet later, greatly influenced the early development of Malayalam. The Malayalam script began to diverge from the Tamil-Brahmi script in the 8th and 9th centuries CE. And by the end of the 13th century a written form of the language emerged which was unique from the Tamil-Brahmi script that was used to write Tamil.{{sfn|Mahapatra|1989|p=307}}

Malayalam is similar to some [[Sri Lankan Tamil dialects]], and the two are often mistaken by native Indian Tamil speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Indrapala, K The Evolution of an ethnic identity: The Tamils of Sri Lanka, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.empowerlingua.com/tamil-translators-of-indian-tamil-and-sri-lankan-tamil-dialects/|title=Tamil Translators of Sri Lanka and India|date=2015-10-26|work=Empowerlingua|access-date=2017-07-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malayalam-Tamil===
Malayalam-Tamil otherwise called [[Malayanma]] or Malabar Thamozhi was the language of Western Tamils of [[Chera dynasty]]. Malabar Thamozhi was a variant of Tamil which was the vernacular mass language of Kerala  used by majority of Malayalis until 1820 AD when British decided to change it to [[Grantha script|Grantha]] Malayalayalam written with [[Tigalari script]] used then by a minority of Northern people. Malayanma was written using different scritpts including [[Malayanma]] Script, [[Vatteluttu alphabet]], [[Kolezhuthu]] and [[Tamil script]].
Porutuguese called it [[Lingua Malabar Tamul]] and used Portuguese or [[Tamil Script]]. Early Syriac Chrisitians used a form of Malayalam-Tamil which they called Karzoni. The Malayalam-Tamil the Dravidian tongue used by the indigenous people of Kerala was devoid of Sanskrit or Hindi words.

[[Lingua Malabar Tamul]]
Portuguese called the Malalyalam-Tamil variant of Kerala as Lingua Malabar Tamul. This was also called Malabar Thamozhi. First book to be printed in Lingua Malabar Tamul was Cartilha in 1554 which used Portuguese letters to write the Malabar Thamozhi.
[[File:DOCTRINA CHRISTAM IMAGE.jpg|right|thumb|Thamburan Vanakkam, printed at 1558 used [[Tamil script]].]]


Khristiani Vanakkam printed at [[Cochin]] in 1579 by Henriques. Muttuchira Church inscription uses  Vatteluthu script to write Malayalam-Tamil in 1580.

Ravikutty Pilla Por written in the 17th century is the shining example of Malayanma style literature. Ananthapuri Varnanam written in 1800s among the last of these Malayalam-Tamil books. 
Itty Achudan the famed Ayurvedic Physician used [[Malayanma]] and [[Kolezhuthu|Kolezhuttu]] to write [[Hortus Malabaricus]] in 1678 AD (which was translated to Latin).
In the 17th century Malayanma Script was extensively used by the Catholics of Kerala. Samkshepa Vedartham in Malayalma was printed at Rome in 1772. Ramban Bible written in Malayalma was translated from Syriac by Fr.Phillipose and was published at 1811 AD. After this period British banned Malaynma and most of the books written in Malayanma disappeared. British never supported or Translated Malaynma books into Grantha Malayalam which they chose to promote in the 19th century. Iravikutti Pilla Por, Vadakkan Pattu, Thacholi Pattu, Kannassa Ramayanam, Ramacharitham Ananthapuri Varnanam are few of the Malayanma books which have survived. The Malayanma the indigenous Dravidian tongue and its great literary tradition was lost in history

===History===
At the 12th century Kerala was invaded by Tulu Bana Kings with an army from [[Ahichatra]] in the Indo-Nepalese border. [[Keralolpathi]] mentions a Tulu invader called Banapperumal who was the brother of [[Tulu people|Tulu]] king Kavi Raja Singhan (Kavi Alupendra 1110-1170) of [[Alupa dynasty]] who invaded Kerala with a Large Nair army led by Pada Mala Nair. Banapperumal establishe his capital at [[Valapattanam]] near Kannur. Banapperumals son was Udayavarman [[Kolathiri]] the first of [[Kolathiri]] dynasty which was the result of Tulu invasion.
The Tamil [[Chera dynasty]] of [[Villavar]] Tamils was shifted to [[Kollam]] following this attack. Kerala was under the  [[Pandyan Dynasty]] who encouraged Tamil writing. 

After the defeat of [[Pandyan Dynasty]] in 1310 AD by [[Malik Kafur]] of [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi Sulhtanate]] all the Tamil dynasties were replaced by Tulu Samantha dynasties under the overlordship of [[Kolathiri]] Kingdom. The Kolathiris and other Matriarchal [[Tulu people|Tulu]] dynasties of Kerala ruled with the help of an army drawn from [[Ahichatra]] in the Indo-Neplaese border. The establishment of Tulu-Nepalese rule over Kerala led to  Sanskritization of Malayalam-Tamil  and loan words from Tulu, Kannada, Nepalese and Hindi inserted into Malayalam. [[Tigalari script]] which was used to write [[Tulu language]] in Karnataka was beginning to be used to  write the Sanskritised Malayalam called Granthamalayalam was used by the ruling Tulu-Nepalese elite of Kerala after 1314 AD.  Grantha Malayalam books though appeared in in the 16th century, Malayalam-Tamil or Malayanma continued to be the Vernacular language of Kerala until 19th century.
Two versions of Grantha Malayalam existed in that era. Grantha Bhasa (Sanskrit language) with few Malayalam words and Grantha Malayalam which had more Malayalam words and less Sanskrit words. The domination of Tulu-Nepalese rulers over Kerala gradually changed the local Malayalam-Tamil by mixing with Sanskrit, Hindi and Nepalese loan words.

===Role of Missionaries===
Johann Ernst Hanxleden was a German missionary who was the first ever European to write the Grammer book for Grantha Malayalam called Grantha Bhasayuide Vyakaranam in 1700s. The Discovery that Sanskrit was related to German made the German missionaries promote Sanaskrit and Grantha Malayalam at the expense of Malayalam-Tamil.  in 1819 [[Benjamin Bailey (missionary)]] created the first Malayalam (Grantha Malayalam) types. Benjamin Bailey published a first Malayalam (Grantha Malayalam) with [[Tigalari script]] with the help of Chandu Menon from Ottappalam converted to Christianity and bore the name Joseph Fenn  and Yakob Ramavarman  in CMS Kottayam. (In that era Christians were using Malayalam-Tamil language hence did not participate in the printing of first Malayalam Bible)
British promoted Grantha Malayalam in the name New Malayayma.
[[Hermann Gundert]] in 1848 published the first ever Malayalam Newspaper called [[Rajyasamacharam]] from Thalassery. German and Dutch missionaries played a major role in the promotion of Grantha Malayalam in Kerala leading to its adoption by Christians by mid 19th century.

==Dialects==
Variations in [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] patterns, vocabulary, and distribution of grammatical and [[phonology|phonological]] elements are observable along the parameters of region, religion, community, occupation, social stratum, style and register.

Dialects of Malayalam are distinguishable at regional and social levels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaimalayalam.com/maladialect.htm|title=New Page 1|publisher=|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including occupational and also communal differences. The salient features of many varieties of tribal speech (e.g., the speech of Muthuvans, Malayarayas, Malai Ulladas, Kanikkars, Kadars, Paliyars, Kurumas, and Vedas) and those of the various dialects [[Namboothiris]], [[Nairs]], [[Ezhavas]], [[Saint Thomas Christians|Syrian Christians]] (Nasrani), Latin Christians, Muslims, fishermen and many of the occupational terms common to different sections of Malayalees have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.malayalamresourcecentre.org/Mrc/Tutor/tech_termin.htm{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2017}}

According to the Dravidian Encyclopedia, the regional [[dialect]]s of Malayalam can be divided into thirteen dialect areas.&lt;ref&gt;Subramoniam, V. I. (1997). Dravidian encyclopaedia. vol. 3, Language and literature. Thiruvananthapuram: International School of Dravidian Linguistics.

According to Ethnologue, the dialects are:&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com" /&gt; Malabar, Nagari-Malayalam, South Kerala, Central Kerala, North Kerala, Kayavar, [[Namboodiri]], [[Nair]], [[Mappila dialect of Malayalam|Moplah (Mapilla)]], Pulaya, Nasrani, and [[Kasargod]]. The community dialects are: Namboodiri, Nair, [[Mappila dialect of Malayalam|Moplah (Mapilla)]], Pulaya, and Nasrani.&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com" /&gt; Whereas both the Namboothiri and Nair dialects have a common nature, the [[Mappila dialect of Malayalam|Mapilla dialect]] is among the most divergent of dialects, differing considerably from literary Malayalam.&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com" /&gt;

As regards the geographical dialects of Malayalam, surveys conducted so far by the Department of Linguistics, University of Kerala restricted the focus of attention during a given study on one specific caste so as to avoid mixing up of more than one variable such as communal and geographical factors. Thus for examples, the survey of the [[Ezhava]] dialect of Malayalam, results of which have been published by the Department in 1974, has brought to light the existence of twelve major dialect areas for Malayalam, although the isoglosses are found to crisscross in many instances.  Sub-dialect regions, which could be marked off, were found to be thirty. This number is reported to tally approximately with the number of principalities that existed during the pre-British period in [[Kerala]]. In a few instances at least, as in the case of Venad, Karappuram, Nileswaram and Kumbala, the known boundaries of old principalities are found to coincide with those of certain dialects or sub-dialects that retain their individuality even today. This seems to reveal the significance of political divisions in Kerala in bringing about dialect difference.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Divergence among dialects of Malayalam embrace almost all aspects of language such as phonetics, phonology, grammar and vocabulary. Differences between any two given dialects can be quantified in terms of the presence or absence of specific units at each level of the language. To cite a single example of language variation along the geographical parameter, it may be noted that there are as many as seventy seven different expressions employed by the [[Ezhavas]] and spread over various geographical points just to refer to a single item, namely, the flower bunch of coconut. 'Kola' is the expression attested in most of the panchayats in the [[Palakkad]], [[Ernakulam]] and [[Thiruvananthapuram]] districts of [[Kerala]], whereas 'kolachil' occurs most predominantly in [[Kannur]] and [[Kochi]] and 'klannil' in [[Alappuzha]] and [[Kollam]]. 'Kozhinnul' and 'kulannilu' are the forms most common in [[Trissur]] [[Idukki]] and [[Kottayam]] respectively. In addition to these forms most widely spread among the areas specified above, there are dozens of other forms such as 'kotumpu' (Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram), 'katirpu' ([[Kottayam]]), krali ([[Pathanamthitta]]), pattachi, gnannil ([[Kollam]]), 'pochata' ([[Palakkad]]) etc. referring to the same item.

It may be noted at this point that labels such as "Brahmin Dialect" and "Syrian Caste Dialect" refer to overall patterns constituted by the sub-dialects spoken by the subcastes or sub-groups of each such caste. The most outstanding features of the major communal dialects of Malayalam are summarized below:
* Lexical items with phonological features reminiscent of Sanskrit (e.g., ''viddhi'', meaning "fool"), ''bhosku'' ("lie"), ''musku'' ("impudence"), ''dustu'' ("impurity"), and ''eebhyan'' and ''sumbhan'' (both meaning "good-for-nothing fellow") abound in this dialect.
* The dialect of the educated stratum among the [[Nairs]] resembles the [[Brahmin]] dialect in many respects. The amount of [[Sanskrit]] influence, however, is found to be steadily decreasing as one descends along the parameter of education.
* One of the striking features differentiating the Nair dialect from the [[Ezhava]] dialect is the phonetic quality of the word-final: an enunciative vowel unusually transcribed as "U". In the Nair dialect it is a mid-central unrounded vowel whereas in the Ezhava dialect it is often heard as a lower high back unrounded vowel.
* The Syrian Christian dialect of Malayalam is quite close to the [[Nair]] dialect, especially in [[phonology]]. The speech of the educated section among Syrian Christians and that of those who are close to the church are peculiar in having a number of assimilated as well as unassimilated [[List of loanwords in Malayalam#Aramaic or East Syriac|loan words]] from [[English language|English]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. The few loan words which have found their way into the Christian dialect are assimilated in many cases through the process of de-aspiration.
* The Latin Christian dialect of Malayalam is close to the fishermen dialect. It is also influenced by [[Latin]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[English language|English]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* The Muslim dialect shows maximum divergence from the literary Standard Dialect of Malayalam. It is very much influenced by [[Arabic]] and [[Urdu]] rather than by Sanskrit or by English. The retroflex continuant ''zha'' of the literary dialect is realised in the Muslim dialect as the palatal ''ya''.
*Tamil spoken in the Kanyakumari district has many Malayalam words.
=== External influences and loanwords ===
Malayalam has incorporated many elements from other languages over the years, the most notable of these being [[Sanskrit]] and later, English.{{sfn|Asher|Kumari|1997|pp=xxiv, xxv}} According to [[Sooranad Kunjan Pillai]] who compiled the authoritative Malayalam lexicon, the other principal languages whose vocabulary was incorporated over the ages were [[Pali]], [[Prakrit]], [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Arabic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Kunjan Pillai (1965) - Malayalam Lexicon, pg xxii-xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;

Many medieval [[liturgical]] texts were written in an admixture of [[Sanskrit]] and early Malayalam, called [[Manipravalam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prd.kerala.gov.in/manipravalam.htm ''Manipravalam''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610042443/http://www.prd.kerala.gov.in/manipravalam.htm |date=10 June 2011 }} The Information &amp; Public Relations Department, [[Government of Kerala]].&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of [[Sanskrit]] was very prominent in formal Malayalam used in literature. Malayalam has a substantially high amount of Sanskrit loan words but are seldom used.&lt;ref&gt;"Dravidian languages." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Loan words and influences also from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Ladino language|Ladino]] abound in the [[Judeo-Malayalam|Jewish Malayalam dialects]], as well as [[English language|English]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] in the [[Christian]] dialects, while [[Arabic]] and Persian elements predominate in the [[Muslim]] dialects. The Muslim dialect known as [[Mappila Malayalam]] is used in the Malabar region of Kerala. Another Muslim dialect called [[Beary bashe]] is used in the extreme northern part of Kerala and the southern part of Karnataka.

==Geographic distribution and population==
{{See also|Kerala Gulf diaspora|States of India by Malayalam speakers}}

Malayalam is a language spoken by the native people of southwestern India (from Talapady to Kanyakumari).According to the Indian census of 2011, there were 32,299,239 speakers of Malayalam in Kerala, making up 93.2% of the total number of Malayalam speakers in India, and 96.74% of the total population of the state. There were a further 701,673 (2.1% of the total number) in [[Karnataka]], 957,705 (2.7%) in [[Tamil Nadu]], and 406,358 (1.2%) in [[Maharashtra]]. The number of Malayalam speakers in [[Lakshadweep]] is 51,100, which is only 0.15% of the total number, but is as much as about 84% of the population of Lakshadweep. In all, Malayalis made up 3.22% of the total Indian population in 2011. Of the total 34,713,130 Malayalam speakers in India in 2011, 33,015,420 spoke the standard dialects, 19,643 spoke the ''Yerava'' dialect and 31,329 spoke non-standard regional variations like ''Eranadan''.&lt;ref name="Censusedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/data_on_language.html|title=Census Of India - Data on Language|publisher=Censusindia.gov.in|accessdate=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per the 1991 census data, 28.85% of all Malayalam speakers in India spoke a second language and 19.64% of the total knew three or more languages.

Large numbers of Malayalis have settled in [[Chennai]] (Madras), [[Bangalore]], [[Mangalore]], [[Hyderabad, Telangana|Hyderabad]], [[Mumbai]] (Bombay), [[Navi Mumbai]] , [[Pune]], [[Mysore]] and [[Delhi]]. A large number of Malayalis have also emigrated to the [[Middle East]], the United States, and Europe. There were 179,860 speakers of Malayalam in the United States, according to the 2000 census, with the highest concentrations in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]] and [[Rockland County, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://40days.homestead.com/Day_22_-_People.pdf]. Accessed November 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; There are 172,000 of Malayalam speakers in [[Malaysia]]. There were 7,093 Malayalam speakers in Australia in 2006.&lt;ref name="IMMI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/research/_pdf/poa-2008.pdf|title=Australian Government Department of Immigration and Border Protection|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 [[Canadian census]] reported 7,070 people who listed Malayalam as their mother tongue, mainly in [[Toronto]], Ontario. The 2006 New Zealand census reported 2,139 speakers.&lt;ref name="NZ"&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130309165040/http://www.stats.govt.nz/ServicePages/NotFound.aspx Statistics New Zealand:Language spoken (total responses) for the 1996–2006 censuses (Table 16)] , ''stats.govt.nz''&lt;/ref&gt; 134 Malayalam speaking households were reported in 1956 in [[Fiji]]. There is also a considerable Malayali population in the [[Persian Gulf]] regions, especially in [[Dubai]] and [[Doha]].

==Phonology==

For the consonants and vowels, the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) symbol is given, followed by the Malayalam character and the [[ISO 15919]] transliteration.&lt;ref name="phono"&gt;http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~hj3/pub/Malayalam.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{IPA|/ɨ̆/}} is the ''saṁvr̥tōkāram'', an [[epenthesis|epenthentic vowel]] in Malayalam. Therefore, it has no independent vowel letter (because it never occurs at the beginning of words) but, when it comes after a consonant, there are various ways of representing it. In medieval times, it was just represented with the symbol for {{IPA|/u/}}, but later on it was just completely omitted (that is, written as an inherent vowel). In modern times, it is written in two different ways – the Northern style, in which a [[chandrakkala]] is used, and the Southern or [[Travancore]] style, in which the diacritic for a {{IPA|/u/}} is attached to the preceding consonant and a chandrakkala is written above.
* &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{IPA|/a/}} (phonetically central: {{IPA|[ä]}}) and {{IPA|/ə/}} are both represented as basic or "default" vowels in the [[Abugida]] script (although {{IPA|/ə/}} never occurs word-initially and therefore does not make use of the letter {{lang|ml|അ}}), but they are distinct vowels.

Malayalam has also borrowed the [[Sanskrit]] diphthongs of {{IPA|/äu/}} (represented in Malayalam as {{lang|ml|ഔ}}, au) and {{IPA|/ai/}} (represented in Malayalam as {{lang|ml|ഐ}}, ai), although these mostly occur only in Sanskrit loanwords. Traditionally (as in Sanskrit), four vocalic consonants (usually pronounced in Malayalam as consonants followed by the ''saṁvr̥tōkāram'', which is not officially a vowel, and not as actual vocalic consonants) have been classified as vowels: vocalic r ({{lang|ml|ഋ}}, {{IPA|/rɨ̆/}}, r̥), long vocalic r ({{lang|ml|ൠ}}, {{IPA|/rɨː/}}, r̥̄), vocalic l ({{lang|ml|ഌ}}, {{IPA|/lɨ̆/}}, l̥) and long vocalic l ({{lang|ml|ൡ}}, {{IPA|/lɨː/}}, l̥̄). Except for the first, the other three have been omitted from the current script used in Kerala as there are no words in current Malayalam that use them.

* The unaspirated alveolar plosive stop once had a separate character but it has become obsolete, as the sound only occurs in geminate form (when geminated it is written with a {{lang|ml|റ}} below another {{lang|ml|റ}}) or immediately following other consonants (in these cases, {{lang|ml|റ}} or {{lang|ml|ററ}} are usually written in small size underneath the first consonant). The archaic letter can be found in the {{angbr|ṯ}} row here [https://web.archive.org/web/20060714032632/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/stone-catend/trimain3.htm].
* The [[alveolar nasal]] also had a separate character that is now obsolete (it can be seen in the {{angbr|ṉ}} row here [https://web.archive.org/web/20060714032632/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/stone-catend/trimain3.htm]) and the sound is now almost always represented by the symbol that was originally used only for the [[dental nasal]]. However, both sounds are extensively used in current colloquial and official Malayalam, and although they were allophones in Old Malayalam, they now occasionally contrast in gemination – for example, ''eṉṉāl'' ("by me", first person singular pronoun in the instrumental case) and ''ennāl'' ("if that is so", elided from the original ''entāl''), which are both written ''ennāl''.
* The letter ഫ represents both {{IPA|/pʰ/}}, a phoneme occurring in Sanskrit loanwords, and {{IPA|/f/}}, which is mostly found in comparatively recent borrowings from European languages.

The approximant {{IPA|/ɻ/}} has both rhotic and lateral qualities, and is indeterminate between an approximant and a fricative, but is [[laminal consonant|laminal post-alveolar]] rather than a true retroflex. The articulation changes part-way through, perhaps explaining why it behaves as both a rhotic and a lateral, both an approximant and a fricative, but the nature of the change is not understood.&lt;ref&gt;Scobbie, Punnoose &amp; Khattab (2013) "Articulating five liquids: a single  speaker ultrasound  study of Malayalam".

==Grammar==
{{Main|Malayalam grammar}}
Malayalam has a canonical word order of [[subject–object–verb|SOV]] (subject–object–verb) as do other [[Dravidian languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_mym|title=Wals.info|publisher=Wals.info|accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rare [[subject–object–verb|OSV]] word order occurs in interrogative clauses when the interrogative word is the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jayaseelan|first1=Karattuparambil|title=IP-internal topic and focus phrases|date=2001|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[adjective]]s and [[possessive adjective]]s precede the [[noun]]s they modify. Malayalam has 6&lt;ref&gt;Asher, R. E. and Kumari, T. C. (1997). Malayalam. Routledge Pub.: London.&lt;/ref&gt; or 7&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaimalayalam.com/papers/socialCaseMalayalam05.pdf|title=The Samyojika Vibhakthi and Its Unique Application in Malayalam Grammar|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2017}} [[grammatical case]]s. Verbs are conjugated for tense, mood and aspect, but not for person, gender or number except in archaic or poetic language.

===Nouns===
The [[declension]]al paradigms for some common nouns and pronouns are given below. As Malayalam is an agglutinative language, it is difficult to delineate the cases strictly and determine how many there are, although seven or eight is the generally accepted number. [[Alveolar plosive]]s and [[Alveolar nasal|nasals]] (although the modern [[Malayalam script]] does not distinguish the latter from the [[dental nasal]]) are underlined for clarity, following the convention of the [[National Library at Kolkata romanization]].

===Personal pronouns===
[[Vocative case|Vocative]] forms are given in parentheses after the [[nominative]], as the only pronominal vocatives that are used are the third person ones, which only occur in compounds.

===Words adopted from Sanskrit===
When words are adopted from Sanskrit, their endings are usually changed to conform to Malayalam norms:

====Nouns====
* Masculine [[Sanskrit]] nouns with a [[word stem]] ending in a short /a/ take the ending /an/ in the nominative singular. For example, [[Krishna|Kr̥ṣṇa]] → Kr̥ṣṇan. The final /n/ is dropped before masculine surnames, honorifics, or titles ending in /an/ and beginning with a consonant other than /n/ – e.g., "Krishna Menon", "Krishna Kaniyaan" etc., but "Krishnan Ezhutthachan". Surnames ending with /ar/ or /aḷ/ (where these are plural forms of "an" denoting respect) are treated similarly – "Krishna Pothuval", "Krishna Chakyar", but "Krishnan Nair", "Krishnan Nambiar", as are Sanskrit surnames such "Varma(n)", "Sharma(n)", or "Gupta(n)" (rare) – e.g., "Krishna Varma", "Krishna Sharman". If a name is a compound, only the last element undergoes this transformation – e.g., "Kr̥ṣṇa" + "dēva" = "Kr̥ṣṇadēvan", not "Kr̥ṣṇandēvan".
* Feminine words ending in a long /ā/ or /ī/ are changed to end in a short /a/ or /i/, for example "[[Sita|Sītā]]" → "Sīta" and "[[Lakshmi|Lakṣmī]]" → "Lakṣmi". However, the long vowel still appears in compound words, such as "Sītādēvi" or" Lakṣmīdēvi". The long ī is generally reserved for the [[vocative case|vocative]] forms of these names, although in Sanskrit the vocative actually takes a short /i/. There are also a small number of nominative /ī/ endings that have not been shortened – a prominent example being the word "strī" for "woman".
* Nouns that have a stem in /-an/ and which end with a long /ā/ in the masculine nominative singular have /vŭ/ added to them, for example "[[Brahmā]]" (stem "Brahman") → "Brahmāvŭ". When the same nouns are declined in the neuter and take a short /a/ ending in Sanskrit, Malayalam adds an additional /m/, e.g. "Brahma" (neuter nominative singular of "[[Brahman]]") becomes "Brahmam". This is again omitted when forming compounds.
* Words whose roots end in /-an/ but whose nominative singular ending is /-a-/ (for example, the Sanskrit root of "[[karma]]" is actually "karman") are also changed. The original root is ignored and "karma" (the form in Malayalam being "karmam" because it ends in a short /a/) is taken as the basic form of the noun when declining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Varma|first=A.R. Rajaraja|title=Keralapanineeyam|publisher=D C Books|year=2005|location=Kottayam|page=303|isbn=81-7130-672-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not apply to all consonant stems, as "unchangeable" stems such as "manas" ("mind") and "suhr̥t" ("friend") are identical to the Malayalam nominative singular forms (although the regularly derived "manam" sometimes occurs as an alternative to "manas").
* Sanskrit words describing things or animals rather than people with a stem in short /a/ end with an /m/ in Malayalam. For example,"[[Ramayana|Rāmāyaṇa]]" → "Rāmāyaṇam". In most cases, this is actually the same as the Sanskrit accusative case ending, which is also /m/ (or, allophonically, anusvara due to the requirements of the [[sandhi]] word-combining rules) in the neuter nominative. However, "things and animals" and "people" are not always differentiated based on whether or not they are sentient beings; for example, "[[Narasimha]]" becomes "Narasiṃham" and not "Narasiṃhan", whereas "[[Ananta Shesha|Ananta]]" becomes "Anantan" even though both are sentient. This does not strictly correspond to the Sanskrit neuter gender, as both "Narasiṃha" and "Ananta" are masculine nouns in the original Sanskrit.
* Nouns with short vowel stems other than /a/, such as "[[Vishnu|Viṣṇu]]", "[[Prajapati|Prajāpati]]" etc. are declined with the Sanskrit stem acting as the Malayalam nominative singular (the Sanskrit nominative singular is formed by adding a visarga, e.g., as in "Viṣṇuḥ")
* The original Sanskrit vocative is often used in formal or poetic Malayalam, e.g. "Harē" (for "[[Hari]]") or "Prabhō" (for "Prabhu" – "Lord"). This is restricted to certain contexts – mainly when addressing deities or other exalted individuals, so a normal man named Hari would usually be addressed using a Malayalam vocative such as "Harī". The Sanskrit genitive is also occasionally found in Malayalam poetry, especially the personal pronouns "mama" ("my" or "mine") and "tava" ("thy" or "thine"). Other cases are less common and generally restricted to the realm of Maṇipravāḷam.
* Along with these [[tatsama]] borrowings, there are also many [[tadbhava]] words in common use. These were incorporated via borrowing before the separation of Malayalam and Tamil. As the language did not then accommodate Sanskrit phonology as it now does, words were changed to conform to the Old Tamil phonological system, for example "Kr̥ṣṇa" → "Kaṇṇan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Varma|first=A.R.

Historically, several scripts were used to write Malayalam. Among these were the Vatteluttu, [[Kolezhuthu]] and [[Malayanma]] scripts. But it was the [[Grantha script]], another [[Southern Brahmi]] variation, which gave rise to the modern [[Malayalam script]]. It is syllabic in the sense that the sequence of graphic elements means that syllables have to be read as units, though in this system the elements representing individual vowels and consonants are for the most part readily identifiable. In the 1960s Malayalam dispensed with many special letters representing less frequent conjunct consonants and combinations of the vowel /u/ with different consonants.

Malayalam script consists of a total of 578 characters. The script contains 52 letters including 16 vowels and 36 consonants, which forms 576 syllabic characters, and contains two additional diacritic characters named [[anusvāra]] and [[visarga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Malayalam Self-Taught|authors=Don M. de Z.

[[Malayalam poetry]] to the late 20th century betrays varying degrees of the fusion of the three different strands. The oldest examples of Pattu and Manipravalam, respectively, are ''Ramacharitam'' and ''Vaishikatantram'', both from the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.malayalamresourcecentre.org/Mrc/literature/champu.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130704062535/http://www.malayalamresourcecentre.org/Mrc/literature/champu.html |archivedate=4 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2017}}

[[Adhyathmaramayanam|Adhyatmaramayanam]] by [[Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan]] (known as the father of the Malayalam language) who was born in [[Tirur]], one of the most important works in Malayalam literature. [[Unnunili Sandesam]] written in the 14th century is amongst the oldest literary works in Malayalam language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kamil Zvelebil |title=The Smile of Murugan: On Tamil Literature of South India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=degUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA155 |year=1973 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-03591-5 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 18th century some of the [[Christian missionaries]] from Kerala started writing in Malayalam but mostly travelogues, dictionaries and religious books. [[Varthamanappusthakam]] (1778), written by [[Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syromalabarchurch.in/museum.php|title=Syro Malabar Church|publisher=|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered to be the first travelogue in an Indian language.

=== Early period ===
[[File:Travancore Rupee - Reverse.jpg|thumb|Malayalam letters on old [[Travancore Rupee]] coin]]

The earliest known poem in Malayalam, ''[[Ramacharitam]]'', dated to the 12th to 14th century CE, was completed before the introduction of the Sanskrit alphabet. It shows the same phase of the language as in [[Cochin Jews|Jewish]] and [[Saint Thomas Christians|Nasrani]] ''Sasanas'' (dated to mid‑8th century A.D.).&lt;ref name="Clad" /&gt; But the period of the earliest available literary document cannot be the sole criterion used to determine the antiquity of a language. In its early literature, Malayalam has songs, ''Pattu'', for various subjects and occasions, such as harvesting, love songs, heroes, gods, etc. A form of writing called ''Campu'' emerged from the 14th century onwards. It mixed poetry with prose and used a vocabulary strongly influenced by Sanskrit, with themes from epics and ''Puranas''.{{sfn|Mahapatra|1989|p=307}}[[Image:Samkshepavedartham 1772.pdf|thumb|Cover page of ''Nasranikal okkekkum ariyendunna samkshepavedartham'' which is the first book to be printed in Malayalam in 1772.]]''Rama-charitam'', which was composed in the 14th century A.D., may be said to have inaugurated [[Malayalam literature]] just as Naniah's [[Mahabharatam]] did for [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. The fact is that dialectical and local peculiarities had already developed and stamped themselves in local songs and ballads. But these linguistic variations were at last gathered together and made to give a coloring to a sustained literary work, the ''Rama-charitam'', thereby giving the new language a justification and a new lease on life.

The Malayalam language, with the introduction of a new type of devotional literature, underwent a metamorphosis, both in form and content, and it is generally held that modernity in Malayalam language and literature commenced at this period. This change was brought about by Thunchathu [[Ezhuthachan]] (16th century) who is known as the father of modern Malayalam. Till this time Malayalam indicated two different courses of development depending on its relationship with either [[Sanskrit]] or [[Tamil language|Tamil]].

The earliest literary work in Malayalam now available is a prose commentary on Chanakya's [[Arthashastra]], ascribed to the 13th century. The poetical works called ''Vaisikatantram'' are also believed to belong to the early 14th century. These works come under a special category known as [[Manipravalam]], literally the combination of two languages, the language of [[Kerala]] and Sanskrit. A [[grammar]] and rhetoric in this hybrid style was written sometime in the 14th century in Sanskrit and the work, called the ''Lilatikalam'', is the main source of information for a student of literary and linguistic history.

According to this book, the [[Manipravalam]] and Pattu styles of literary compositions were in vogue during this period. "Pattu" means "song" and more or less represents the pure Malayalam school of poetry. From the definition of the Pattu style given in the ''Lilatikalam'', it can be surmised that the language of Kerala during this period was more or less in line with Tamil, but this has misled many people to believe incorrectly that Malayalam was itself Tamil during this period and before.

The latest research shows that Malayalam as a separate spoken language in Kerala began showing independent lines of development from its parental tongue Proto-Tamil-Malayalam (which is not modern Tamil), preserving the features of the earliest [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] tongue, which only in due course gave birth to the literary form of Tamil, namely Sen Tamil and Malayalam, the spoken form of which is prevalent in [[Kerala]]. However, till the 13th century there is no hard evidence to show that the language of Kerala had a literary tradition except in folk songs.

The literary tradition consisted of three early Manipravalam Champus, a few [[Sandesa Kavya]]s and innumerable amorous compositions on the courtesans of [[Kerala]], which throb with literary beauty and poetical fancies, combined with a relishing touch of realism about them with regard to the then social conditions. Many [[prose]] works in the form of commentaries upon Puranic episodes form the bulk of the classical works in Malayalam.

The Pattu (a [[sutra]] devoted to define this pattern is termed a ''pattu'') school also has major works like the [[Ramacharitam]] (12th century), and the [[Bhagavad Gita]] (14th century) by a set of poets belonging to one family called the Kannassas. Some of them like Ramacharitam have a close resemblance to the Tamil language during this period. This is to be attributed to the influence of Tamil works on native poets belonging to areas that lie close to the Tamil country.

It was during the 16th and 17th centuries that later Champu kavyas were written. Their specialty was that they contained both Sanskritic and indigenous elements of poetry to an equal degree, and in that manner were unique.

Unnayi Varyar, whose Nalacharitan Attakkatha is popular even today, was the most prominent poet of the 18th century among not only the Kathakali writers, but also among the classical poets of Kerala. He is often referred to as the [[Kalidasa]] of Kerala. Although [[Kathakali]] is a dance drama and its literary form should more or less be modeled after the drama, there is nothing more in common between an Attakkatha and Sanskrit drama.

That is to say, the principles of dramaturgy to be observed in writing a particular type of Sanskrit drama are completely ignored by an author of Attakkatha. Delineation of a particular ''[[rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'' is an inevitable feature with Sanskrit drama, whereas in an Attakkatha all the predominant ''rasas'' are given full treatment, and consequently the theme of an Attakkatha often loses its integrity and artistic unity when viewed as a literary work.

Any Attakkatha fulfills its objective if it affords a variety of scenes depicting different types of characters, and each scene would have its own hero with the ''rasa'' associated with that character. When that hero is portrayed he is given utmost importance, to the utter neglect of the main sentiment (''rasa'') of the theme in general. However, the purpose of Attakkatha is not to present a theme with a well-knit emotional plot as its central point, but to present all approved types of characters already set to suit the technique of the art of [[Kathakali]].

The major literary output of the century was in the form of local plays composed for the art of [[kathakali]], the dance dramas of Kerala also known as Attakkatha. It seems the ''Gitagovinda'' of Jayadeva provided a model for this type of literary composition. The verses in Sanskrit narrate the story and the dialogue is composed in imitation of songs in the ''Gitagovinda'', set to music in appropriate ''[[ragas]]'' in the classical [[Karnataka]] style.

Besides the Raja of Kottarakkara and Unnayi Varyar referred to above, nearly a hundred plays were composed during this century by poets belonging to all categories and subscribing to all standards, such as Irayimman Tampi and Ashvati Raja, to mention just two.

Devotional literature in Malayalam found its heyday during the early phase of this period. Ezhuthachan referred to above gave emphasis to the ''[[Bhakti]]'' cult. The ''Jnanappana'' by Puntanam Nambudiri is a unique work in the branch of philosophical poetry. Written in simple language, it is a sincere approach to the [[advaita]] philosophy of [[Vedanta]].

It took nearly two centuries for a salutary blending of the scholarly Sanskrit and popular styles to bring Malayalam prose to its present form, enriched in its vocabulary by Sanskrit but at the same time flexible, pliable and effective as to popular parlance.

As regards literature, the leading figures were [[Irayimman Thampi]] and Vidwan Koithampuran, both poets of the royal court. Their works abound in a beautiful and happy blending of music and poetry. The former is surely the most musical poet of Kerala and his beautiful lullaby commencing with the line ''Omana Thinkalkidavo'' has earned him an everlasting name. But the prime reason why he is held in such high esteem in Malayalam is the contribution he has made to Kathakali literature by his three works, namely the ''Dakshayagam'', the ''Kichakavadham'' and the ''Uttara-svayamvaram''. The latter's [[Kathakali]] work ''Ravana Vijayam'' has made him immortal in literature.

====Impact of European scholars====
The first printed book in Kerala was ''Doctrina Christam'', written by [[Henrique Henriques]] in [[Lingua Malabar Tamul]]. It was transliterated and translated into Malayalam, and printed by the Portuguese in 1578.&lt;ref name="First book printed in Kerala"&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2005/10/14/stories/2005101407670300.htm# Copy of first book printed in Kerala released] Publisher:The Hindu dated:Friday, 14 Oct 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tidsskrift.dk/visning.jsp?markup=&amp;print=no&amp;id=101382#|title=Flos Sanctorum in Tamil and Malaylam in 1578|publisher=Tidsskrift.dk|accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th and 17th centuries, [[Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan]] was the first to substitute [[Grantha Script#Malayalam and Grantha|Grantha-Malayalam script]] for the Tamil Vatteluttu alphabet. Ezhuthachan, regarded as the father of the modern Malayalam language, undertook an elaborate translation of the ancient Indian epics ''Ramayana'' and ''Mahabharata'' into Malayalam. His ''[[Adhyatma Ramayana]]'' and ''Mahabharata'' are still read with religious reverence by the Malayalam-speaking Hindu community. Kunchan Nambiar, the founder of ''Tullal'', was a prolific literary figure of the 18th century.

The British printed [http://www.hindu.com/2005/10/14/stories/2005101407670300.htm Malabar English Dictionary] by Graham Shaw in 1779 was still in the form of a Tamil-English Dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/10/14/stories/2005101407670300.htm|title=Kerala / Kozhikode News : Copy of first book printed in Kerala released|date=14 October 2005|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Saint Thomas Christians|Syrian Christians]] of Kerala started to learn the Tulu-Grantha Bhasha of Nambudiris under the British Tutelage. [[Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar]] wrote the first Malayalam travelogue called ''[[Varthamanappusthakam]]'' in 1789.

The educational activities of the missionaries belonging to the Basel Mission deserve special mention. [[Hermann Gundert]], (1814 – 1893), a German missionary and scholar of exceptional linguistic talents, played a distinguishable role in the development of Malayalam literature. His major works are Keralolpathi (1843), Pazhancholmala (1845), Malayalabhaasha Vyakaranam (1851), ''Paathamala (1860) the first Malayalam school text book'', Kerala pazhama (1868), ''the first Malayalam dictionary (1872)'', Malayalarajyam (1879) - Geography of Kerala, ''Rajya Samacharam (1847 June) the first Malayalam news paper'', Paschimodayam (1879) - Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressacademy.org/tags/rajyasamacharam Rajyasamacharam | Kerala Press Academy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712090109/http://www.pressacademy.org/tags/rajyasamacharam |date=12 July 2013 }}.

In 1821, the [[Church Mission Society]] (CMS) at [[Kottayam]] in association with the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] started a seminary at [[Kottayam]] in 1819 and started printing books in Malayalam when Benjamin Bailey, an [[Anglican]] priest, made the first Malayalam types. In addition, he contributed to standardizing the prose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2010/02/05/stories/2010020551770300.htm# "Banjamin Bailey"], ''The Hindu'', 5 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Gundert]] from [[Stuttgart]], Germany, started the first Malayalam newspaper, ''Rajya Samacaram'' in 1847 at [[Thalassery|Talasseri]].

By the end of the 19th century Malayalam replaced [[Syriac language|Syriac]] as language of [[Liturgy]] in the Syrian Christian churches.

Thanks to the efforts of kings like [[Swathi Thirunal]] and to the assistance given by him to the Church Mission and London Mission Societies, a number of schools were started.

====1850–1904====
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
The establishment of the Madras University in 1857 marks an important event in the cultural history of [[Kerala]]. It is from here that a generation of scholars well versed in [[Western literature]] and with the capacity to enrich their own language by adopting Western literary trends came into being. [[Prose]] was the first branch to receive an impetus by its contact with English. Though there was no shortage of prose in Malayalam, it was not along Western lines. It was left to the farsighted policy of the [[Maharaja of Travancore]] (1861 to 1880) to start a scheme for the preparation of textbooks for use by schools in the state. Kerala Varma V, a scholar in Sanskrit, Malayalam and English was appointed Chairman of the Committee formed to prepare textbooks. He wrote several books suited for various standards.

The growth of journalism, too, helped in the development of prose. Initiated by missionaries for the purpose of religious propaganda, journalism was taken up by local scholars who started newspapers and journals for literary and political activities.

[[Vengayil Kunhiraman Nayanar]], (1861-1914) from [[Thalassery]] was the author of first Malayalam short story, Vasanavikriti. After him innumerable world class literature works by was born in Malayalam.

With his work ''[[Kundalatha]]'' in 1887, [[Appu Nedungadi]] marks the origin of prose fiction in Malayalam. Other talented writers were [[Chandu Menon]], the author of ''[[Indulekha (novel)|Indulekha]]'', a great [[social novel]], in 1889 and another called ''Sarada''. Also there was [[C V Raman Pillai]], who wrote the historical novel ''Marthandavarma'' in 1890 as well as works like Dharmaraja, and [[Ramaraja Bahadur]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

[[File:Shakuntala RRV.jpg|thumb|Shakuntala writes to Dushyanta. Painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]. The poetry was translated by [[Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran|Kerala Varma]] as [[Abhijnanasakuntalam]]]]

In poetry there were two main trends, one represented by [[Venmani Nampoodiris(venmani Poets)]] and the other by [[Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran|Kerala Varma]]. The latter's poetry was modeled on the old [[Manipravalam]] style abounding in Sanskrit words and terms, but it had a charm of its own when adapted to express new ideas in that masterly way characteristic of himself. His translation of [[Kalidasa]]'s ''[[Abhijnanasakuntalam]]'' in 1882 marks an important event in the history of Malayalam drama and poetry. Also Kerala Varma's ''Mayura-sandesam'' is a ''Sandesakavya'' (messenger poem) written after the manner of Kalidasa's ''Meghadutam''. Though it cannot be compared with the original, it was still one of the most popularly acclaimed poems in Malayalam.

One of the notable features of the early decades of the 20th century was the great interest taken by writers in translating works from Sanskrit and English into Malayalam. Kalidasa's ''Meghaduta'' and ''Kumarasambhava'' by A. R. Raja Raja Varma and the ''Raghuvamsa'' by K. N. Menon must be mentioned. One of the most successful of the later translators was C. S. Subramaniam Potti who set a good model by his translation of the ''Durgesanandini'' of Bankim Chandra from an English version of it.

===Twentieth century===

{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
The early decades of the 20th century saw the beginning of a period of rapid development of all branches of [[Malayalam literature]]. A good number of authors familiar with the latest trends in English literature came forward to contribute to the enrichment of their mother tongue. Their efforts were directed more to the development of prose than poetry.
[[File:Malayalam Wikipedia Mobile App.png|thumb|Malayalam language in mobile phone]]

==== Prose ====
Several [[Culture of Bengal|Bengali]] novels were translated during this period. C. S. S. Potti, mentioned above, also brought out the ''Lake of Palms'' of R. C. Dutt under the title ''Thala Pushkarani'', ''Kapalakundala'' by V. K. Thampi and ''Visha Vruksham'' by T. C. Kalyani Amma were also translations of novels by Bankimochandra Chatterji.

Among the original novels written at that time only a few are worth mentioning, such as ''Bhootha Rayar'' by Appan Thampuran, ''Keraleswaran'' by Raman Nambeesan and ''[[Cheraman Perumal]]'' by K. K. Menon. Although a large number of social novels were produced during this period, only a few are remembered, such as ''Snehalatha'' by Kannan Menon, ''Hemalatha'' by T. K. Velu Pillai and ''Kambola-balika'' by N. K. Krishna Pillai. But by far the most inspiring work of that time was ''Aphante Makal'' by M. B. Namboodiri, who directed his literary talents towards the abolition of old worn-out customs and manners which had for years been the bane of the community.

Short stories came into being. With the advent of E. V. Krishna Pillai, certain marks of novelty became noticeable in the short story. His ''Keleesoudham'' proved his capacity to write with considerable emotional appeal.

[[C. V. Raman Pillai]] was a pioneer in prose dramas. He had a particular knack for writing dramas in a lighter vein. His ''Kurupillakalari'' of 1909 marks the appearance of the first original Malayalam prose drama. It is a satirical drama intended to ridicule the [[Malayali]] official classes who started imitating Western fashion and etiquette. There were other authors, less well-known, who wrote in this vein.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Under the guidance of A. Balakrishna Pillai, a progressive school of authors appeared in almost all branches of literature, such as the novel, the short story, the drama, and criticism.

====Poetry====
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
Kumaran Asan's celebrated poem, ''Veena Poovu'' (''The Fallen Flower'') depicts in a symbolic manner the tragedy of human life in a moving and thought-provoking manner. Vallathol's ''Bandhanasthanaya Aniruddhan'', which demonstrates an exceptionally brilliant power of imagination and deep emotional faculties, depicts a situation from the Puranic story of Usha and Aniruddha. Ulloor S. P. Iyer was another veteran who joined the new school. He wrote a series of poems like ''Oru Mazhathulli'' in which he excelled as a romantic poet.

The three more or less contemporary poets [[Kumaran Asan]], [[Vallathol Narayana Menon]]
and [[Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer]] considerably enriched Malayalam poetry. Some of their works reflect social and political movements of that time. Asan wrote about [[untouchability]] in Kerala; Ullor's writings reflect his deep devotion and admiration for the great moral and spiritual values, which he believed were the real assets of ancient social life of India. They were known as the trio of Malayalam poetry. After them there were others like K. K. Nair and [[K. M. Panikkar]] who contributed to the growth of poetry.

'''Marwari''' (''Mārwāṛī''; also rendered ''Marwadi'', ''Marvadi'') is a [[Rajasthani languages|Rajasthani language]] spoken in the Indian state of [[Rajasthan]]. Marwari is also found in the neighboring state of [[Gujarat]] and [[Haryana]], Eastern Pakistan and some migrant communities in himalayan country [[Nepal]]. With some 20 million or so speakers (ce. 2001), it is one of the largest varieties of [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]]. Most speakers live in Rajasthan, with a quarter million in [[Sindh]] and a tenth that number in Nepal. There are two dozen dialects of Marwari.

Marwari is popularly written in [[Devanagari]] script, as is [[Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and [[Sanskrit]]; although it was historically written in [[Mahajani]]. Marwari currently has no official status as a language of education and government.  There has been a push in the recent past for the national government to recognize this language and give it a scheduled status. The state of Rajasthan recognizes Rajasthani as a language.

In Pakistan, there are two varieties of Marwari. They may or may not be close enough to Indian Marwari to be considered the same language. Marwari speakers are concentrated in [[Sindh]]. In Pakistan, Marwari is generally written using a modified version of the Arabic script

Marwari is still spoken widely in and around [[Bikaner]]. There are ongoing efforts to identify and classify this language cluster and the language differences.

== History ==
It is said that Marwari and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] evolved from ''Gujjar Bhakha'' or ''Maru-Gurjar'', language of the [[Gurjar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Revealing India's past: recent trends in art and archaeology|author=Ajay Mitra Shastri|author2=R. K. Sharma |author3=Devendra Handa |publisher=Aryan Books International|year=2005|ISBN=978-81-7305-287-3 |page=227|quote=It is an established fact that during 10th-11th century.....Interestingly the language was known as the Gujjar Bhakha..}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formal grammar of Gurjar Apabhraṃśa was written by [[Jain]] monk and eminent [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] scholar [[Acharya Hemachandra|Hemachandra Suri]].

== Geographical distribution ==
[[File:Marwari map.PNG|thumb|300px|Dark green indicates Marwari speaking home area in Rajasthan, light green indicates additional dialect areas where speakers identify their language as Marwari.|right]]Marwari is primarily spoken in the Indian state of Rajasthan.  Marwari speakers have dispersed widely throughout India and other countries but are found most notably in the neighboring state of Gujarat and in Eastern Pakistan. Speakers are also found in [[Bhopal]]. With some 13.2 million speakers (in 1997, ca. 13 million in India and 200,000 in Pakistan) it is the largest of the Marwari subgroup.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

There are several dialects: Thaḷī (spoken in eastern [[Jaisalmer district]] and northwestern [[Jodhpur district]]), Bāgṛī (near [[Haryana]]), Bhitrauti, Sirohī, Godwārī.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Masica| first = Colin P.|author-link = Colin Masica| title = The Indo-Aryan languages| series = Cambridge language surveys| date = 1991| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-23420-7| ref = harv| pp = 12, 444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lexis ==
It shares a 50%-65% lexical similarity with Hindi (this is based on a [[Swadesh list|Swadesh 210 word list]] comparison).  Marwari has many [[cognate]] words with Hindi.  Notable phonetic correspondences include /s/ in Hindi with /h/ in Marwari.  For example, /sona/ 'gold' (Hindi) and /hono/ 'gold' (Marwari).

==Phonology==
/h/ sometimes [[elision|elides]].  There are also a variety of vowel changes.  Most of the [[pronouns]] and [[interrogative]]s are, however, distinct from those of Hindi.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

== Morphology ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
Marwari language has a structure that is quite similar to Hindi. Its primary word order is [[subject–object–verb]]. Most of the pronouns and interrogatives used in Marwari are distinct from those used in Hindi. At least Marwari proper and [[Harauti language|Harauti]] have a [[clusivity]] distinction.

== Vocabulary ==

Marwari Vocabulary is somewhat similar to other Western Indo-Aryan languages, especially [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]] and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], however, elements of grammar and basic terminology differ enough to significantly impede mutual intelligibility. In addition, Marwari uses many words found in [[Sanskrit]] (the ancestor of most North Indian languages) which are not found in Hindi.

== Writing system ==

Marwari is generally written in the Devanagari script, although the [[Mahajani]] script is traditionally associated with the language.  Traditionally it was written in Mahajani script (which does not have vowels, only consonants). In Pakistan it is written in the [[Perso-Arabic script]] with modifications. Historical Marwari orthography for Devanagari uses other characters in place of standard Devanagari letters.&lt;ref&gt;Pandey, Anshuman. 2010. [http://www.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n3970.pdf Proposal to Encode the Marwari Letter DDA for Devanagari]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Modern Standard Arabic''' ('''MSA'''; {{lang-ar|اللغة العربية الفصحى}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-lughat ul-ʻArabīyat ul-fuṣḥá}}'' 'the most eloquent Arabic language'), '''Standard Arabic''', or '''Literary Arabic''' is the [[Standard language|standardized]] and [[literary language|literary]] variety of Arabic used in writing and in most formal speech throughout the [[Arab world]] to facilitate communication. It is considered a [[pluricentric language]].

Most Western scholars distinguish two standard ''{{transl|ar|ALA|(al-)fuṣḥá}}'' ({{lang|ar|الفصحى}}) varieties of Arabic: the '''[[Classical Arabic]]''' ('''CA''') ({{lang|ar|اللغة العربية التراثية}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-lughah al-ʻArabīyah al-turāthīyah}}'') of the [[Quran]] and early Islamic (7th to 9th centuries) [[Arabic literature|literature]], and '''Modern Standard Arabic''' ('''MSA''') ({{lang|ar|اللغة العربية المعيارية الحديثة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-lughah al-ʻArabīyah al-miʻyārīyah al-ḥadīthah}}''), the standard language in use today. MSA is based on classical Arabic, and differences between the two varieties of the language are directly related to modernizing and simplification, both in speaking and writing styles. Most Arabic speakers consider the two varieties to be two [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]]s of one language, although the two registers can be referred to in Arabic as {{lang|ar|فصحى العصر}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|fuṣḥá l-ʻaṣr}}'' (MSA) and {{lang|ar|فصحى التراث}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|fuṣḥá t-turāth}}'' (CA).&lt;ref name="El-Said M. Badawi 1996. Page 105"&gt;Alaa Elgibali and El-Said M. Badawi. ''Understanding Arabic: Essays in Contemporary Arabic Linguistics in Honor of El-Said M. Badawi'', 1996. Page 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classical Arabic ==
{{main article|Classical Arabic}}

Classical Arabic, also known as Quranic Arabic (although the term is not entirely accurate), is the language used in the [[Quran]] as well as in numerous literary texts from [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]] times (7th to 9th centuries). Many Muslims study Classical Arabic in order to read the [[Quran]] in its original language. It is important to note that written Classical Arabic underwent fundamental changes during the early Islamic era, adding dots to distinguish similarly written letters, and adding the Tashkeel (diacritical markings that guide pronunciation) by [[Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali]], [[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi]], and other scholars. It was the lingua franca across the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Horn of Africa]] during ancient times.

=== Modern Standard Arabic ===

Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the literary standard across the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[Horn of Africa]], and is one of the six official languages of the [[United Nations]]. Most printed material by the [[Arab League]]&amp;mdash;including most books, newspapers, magazines, official documents, and reading primers for small children&amp;mdash;is written in MSA. It was developed in the early part of the 19th century. [[Varieties of Arabic|"Colloquial" Arabic]] refers to the many regional dialects derived from Classical Arabic spoken daily across the region and learned as a [[first language]], and as [[second language]] if people speak other languages native to their particular country. They are not normally written, although a certain amount of literature (particularly plays and poetry (including songs)) exists in many of them. Literary Arabic (MSA) is the official language of all Arab League countries and is the only form of Arabic taught in schools at all stages. Additionally, some Christian Arabic speakers recite prayers in it, as it is considered the [[literary language]]. Bibles are written in MSA aside from Classical Arabic.{{clarify|date=September 2018|Are Bibles written in Classical Arabic?}} MSA is also used in modernized versions of literary forms of the Qur'an, and some Muslim Arabic speakers recite prayers in it; revised editions of numerous literary texts from [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]] times also are written in MSA.

The sociolinguistic situation of Arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of [[diglossia]]{{spaced ndash}}the use of two distinct varieties of the same language, usually in different social contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Farghaly, A., Shaalan, K. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1644879.1644881 Arabic Natural Language Processing: Challenges and Solutions], ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing (TALIP), the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), 8(4)1-22, December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This diglossic situation facilitates [[code-switching]] in which a speaker switches back and forth between the two dialects of the language, sometimes even within the same sentence. People speak MSA as a [[third language]] if they speak other languages native to a country as their first language and colloquial Arabic dialects as their second language. Modern Standard Arabic is also spoken by people of Arab descent outside the Arab world when people of Arab descent speaking different dialects communicate to each other. As there is a prestige or standard dialect of vernacular Arabic, speakers of standard colloquial dialects code-switch between these particular dialects and MSA.

Classical Arabic is considered normative; a few contemporary authors attempt (with varying degrees of success) to follow the syntactic and grammatical norms laid down by classical grammarians (such as [[Sibawayh]]) and to use the vocabulary defined in classical dictionaries (such as the ''Lisan al-Arab'' ِ{{lang|ar|لِسَان العَرَب}}).

However, the exigencies of modernity have led to the adoption of numerous terms which would have been mysterious to a classical author, whether taken from other languages (e.&amp;nbsp;g. {{lang|ar|فيلم}} ''film'') or coined from existing lexical resources (e.&amp;nbsp;g. {{lang|ar|هاتف}} ''hātif''&amp;nbsp; "caller" &gt; "telephone").{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} Structural influence from foreign languages or from the vernaculars has also affected Modern Standard Arabic: for example, MSA texts sometimes use the format "A, B, C, and D" when listing things, whereas Classical Arabic prefers "A and B and C and D", and subject-initial sentences may be more common in MSA than in Classical Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Alan S. Kaye |year= 1991 |title= The Hamzat al-Waṣl in Contemporary Modern Standard Arabic |journal= Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume= 111 |issue= 3 |pages= 572–574 |doi= 10.2307/604273 |jstor= 604273}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, Modern Standard Arabic is generally treated separately in non-Arab sources.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.londonarabictuition.com/lessons.php?type=2 London Arabic Tuition&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic sources generally tend to regard MSA and Classical Arabic as different registers of one and the same language.{{Weasel inline|date=October 2013}} Speakers of Modern Standard Arabic do not always observe the intricate rules of Classical Arabic grammar. Modern Standard Arabic principally differs from Classical Arabic in three areas: lexicon, stylistics, and certain innovations on the periphery that are not strictly regulated by the classical authorities. On the whole, Modern Standard Arabic is not homogeneous; there are authors who write in a style very close to the classical models and others who try to create new stylistic patterns.&lt;ref&gt;https://asianabsolute.co.uk/arabic-language-dialects/ Arabic Language Dialects&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- a different style makes it a different language? --&gt; Add to this regional differences in vocabulary depending upon the influence of the local Arabic varieties and the influences of foreign languages, such as French in Africa and Lebanon or English in Egypt, Jordan, and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfdietrich Fischer. 1997. "Classical Arabic," ''The Semitic Languages''. London:  Routledge. Pg 189.&lt;/ref&gt; As MSA is a revised and simplified form of Classical Arabic, MSA in terms of lexicon omitted the obsolete words used in Classical Arabic. As diglossia is involved, various Arabic dialects freely [[loanword|borrow words]] from MSA, this situation is similar to [[Romance languages]], wherein scores of words were borrowed directly from [[Classical Latin|formal Latin]] (most literate Romance speakers were also literate in Latin); educated speakers of standard colloquial dialects speak in this kind of communication.

Reading out loud in MSA for various reasons is becoming increasingly simpler, using less strict rules compared to CA, notably the [[i`rāb|inflection]] is omitted, making it closer to spoken [[varieties of Arabic]]. It depends on the speaker's knowledge and attitude to the grammar of Classical Arabic, as well as the region and the intended audience. {{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Pronunciation of native words, loanwords, foreign names in MSA is loose, names can be pronounced or even spelled differently in different regions and by different speakers. Pronunciation also depends on the person's education, linguistic knowledge and abilities. There may be sounds used, which are missing in the Classical Arabic but may exist in colloquial varieties - consonants - {{IPAslink|v}}, {{IPAslink|p}}, {{IPAslink|t͡ʃ}} (often realized as {{IPAblink|t}}+{{IPAblink|ʃ}})&lt;!--DON'T ADD [ɡ] BECAUSE IT'S THE STANDARD FOR LITERARY ARABIC in Egypt AND REGIONS IN YEMEN--&gt;, these consonants may or may not be written with special letters; and vowels - {{IPAblink|o}}, {{IPAblink|e}} (both short and long), there are no special letters in Arabic to distinguish between {{IPA|[e~i]}} and {{IPA|[o~u]}} pairs but the sounds o and e (short and long) exist in the colloquial varieties of Arabic and some foreign words in MSA. The differentiation of [[varieties of Arabic#phonetics|pronunciation of informal dialects]] is the influence from other languages previously spoken and some still presently spoken in the regions, such as [[Coptic language|Coptic]] in Egypt, [[French language|French]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], [[Italian language|Italian]],  [[Spanish language|Spanish]],  [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Punic language|Punic]] or [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] in North Africa, [[Himyaritic language|Himyaritic]], [[Modern South Arabian]] and [[Old South Arabian]] in Yemen and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] in the Levant.

=== Vowels ===
Modern Standard Arabic, like Classical Arabic before it, has three pairs of long and short vowels: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}}:

Across North Africa and West Asia, short {{IPA|/i/}} may be realized as {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɪ}} ~ {{IPA link|e}} ~ {{IPA link|ɨ}}]}} before or adjacent to emphatic consonants and {{IPAblink|q}}, {{IPAblink|r}}, {{IPAblink|ħ}}, {{IPAblink|ʕ}} depending on the accent. short {{IPA|/u/}} can also have different realizations, i.e. {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ʊ}} ~ {{IPA link|o}} ~ {{IPA link|ʉ}}]}}. Sometimes with one value for each vowel in both short and long [[Vowel length|lengths]] or two different values for each short and long lengths. In Egypt, close vowels have different values; short initial or medial: {{IPAblink|e}},&amp;nbsp;{{IPAblink|o}} ← instead of {{IPA|/i,&amp;nbsp;u/}}. {{IPA|/i~ɪ/}} and {{IPA|/u~ʊ/}} completely become {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} respectively in some other particular dialects. Allophones of {{IPA|/a/}} &amp; /{{IPA|aː}}/ include {{IPAblink|ɑ}} &amp; {{IPAblink|ɑː}} before or adjacent to emphatic consonants and {{IPAblink|q}}, {{IPAblink|r}}; and {{IPAblink|æ}} &amp; {{IPAblink|æː}} elsewhere. Allophones of {{IPA|/iː/}} include {{IPAblink|ɪː}}~{{IPAblink|ɨː}} before or adjacent to emphatic consonants and {{IPAblink|q}}, {{IPAblink|r}}, {{IPAblink|ħ}}, {{IPAblink|ʕ}}. Allophones of {{IPA|/uː/}} include {{IPAblink|ʊː}}~{{IPAblink|ɤː}}~{{IPAblink|oː}} before or adjacent to emphatic consonants and {{IPAblink|q}}, {{IPAblink|r}}, {{IPAblink|ħ}}, {{IPAblink|ʕ}}. Unstressed final long {{IPA|/aː,&amp;nbsp;iː,&amp;nbsp;uː/}} are most often shortened or reduced: {{IPA|/aː/}}&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;{{IPA|[æ ~ ɑ]}}, {{IPA|/iː/}}&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;{{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/uː/}}&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;{{IPA|[o~u]}}.

'''Notes'''

* *although not part of Standard Arabic phonology the vowels {{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/oː/}} are perceived as separate phonemes in most of modern Arabic dialects and they are occasionally used when speaking Modern Standard Arabic as part of foreign words or when speaking it with a colloquial tone.

== Differences between Modern Standard Arabic and Classical Arabic ==
Differences between Modern Standard Arabic and Classical Arabic span the three categories of linguistics, which are syntax, terminology and pronunciation (especially in terms of tashkeel). Differences are also apparent in the use of punctuation and writing styles.

It should be mentioned that Arabic speakers do not find a noteworthy difference between these varieties, and may sometimes refer to both by the same name: ''Al-arabīyat ul-fuṣḥá'', "the most eloquent Arabic language".

=== Differences in syntax ===
MSA tends to use simplified structures and drop more complicated ones commonly used in Classical Arabic. Some examples include reliance on verb sentences instead of noun phrases and semi-sentences, as well as avoiding phrasal adjectives and accommodating feminine forms of ranks and job titles.&lt;ref name="Arabic" /&gt;

=== Differences in terminology ===
Terminology is the main domain where MSA and CA differ substantially. This stems from the need of MSA to adapt with modern-day terminology in the technical, literary, and scientific domains. The vast majority of these terms refer to items or concepts that did not exist in the time of CA. MSA tends to be more accepting to non-Arabic terminology. Despite the efforts of Arabic Language Academies in the second half of the 20th century to Arabize modern terminology using classical Arabization practices, the fast pace of modern development made transliteration the method of choice for Arabizing modern day terminology.&lt;ref name="Arabic"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://msarabic.com/index.php/en/paper|title=White Paper|last=Arabic|first=AL|website=msarabic.com|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Standard Arabic relies on transliteration to adopt modern day terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://al-arabic.com/index.php/blog-wrapper/blog/82-blog/translation-localization/104-transliteration-in-arabic|title=ورقة عمل حول التعريب اللفظي في اللغة العربية|last=محمد|first=د. علي|website=al-arabic.com|access-date=2016-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823014756/http://al-arabic.com/index.php/blog-wrapper/blog/82-blog/translation-localization/104-transliteration-in-arabic|archive-date=2016-08-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differences in pronunciation ===
MSA differs from CA in the use of sounds not available in the Arabic script and diacritics ([[Tashkīl]]). Unlike Classical Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic accepts the use of consonants that are not supported in the Arabic script, such as {{IPAslink|p}}, and {{IPAslink|v}}. Modern Standard Arabic normally does not use Tashkīl, but only in disambiguation and not the full word is diacriticized, while CA found in [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] scriptures normally prefer indicating full diacritics.&lt;ref name="Arabic"/&gt;

=== Differences in punctuation ===
Modern Standard Arabic has adopted several punctuation marks from other languages, and dropped some classical Arabic ones. Modern technology, especially in printing press and the use of the Internet, has contributed largely to this trend&lt;ref name="Arabic"/&gt;

=== Differences in style ===
Modern Standard Arabic adopts modern writing forms, such as essays, opinion articles, and technical reports, instead of classical ones. Moreover, some new writing forms are directly imported from foreign languages, such as guides, blog posts, and other forms of writing. Moreover, some classical writing forms disappeared completely, such as [[Maqama|Maqam]].

== Regional variants ==
MSA is  loosely uniform across the Middle East. Regional variations exist due to influence from [[Varieties of Arabic|the spoken vernaculars]]. TV hosts who read prepared MSA scripts, for example in [[Al Jazeera]], are ordered to give up national or ethnic pronunciations by changing their pronunciation of certain phonemes (e.g. the realization of the Classical ''{{transl|ar|ALA|jīm}}'' {{lang|ar|[[ج]]}} as {{IPAblink|ɡ}} by Egyptians), though other traits may show the speaker's region, such as the [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and the exact value of vowels and the pronunciation of other consonants. People who speak MSA also mix vernacular and Classical in pronunciation, words, and grammatical forms. Classical/vernacular mixing in formal writing can also be found (e.g., in some Egyptian newspaper editorials); others are written in Modern Standard/vernacular mixing, including entertainment news.

== Speakers ==
{{see also|Arab League#Literacy in Arab league countries}}
People who are literate in Modern Standard Arabic are primarily found in most countries of the [[Arab League]]. It may be assumed that the number of speakers of the language to be the number of literate people in this region, because it is compulsory in schools of most of the Arab League to learn Modern Standard Arabic. People who are literate in the language are usually more so [[passive speaker (language)|passively]], as they mostly use the language in reading and writing, not in speaking. It is also spoken by Muslims in Northern Nigeria by people with Islamic education (especially the Hausa and Fulani people).

The countries with the largest populations that mandate MSA be taught in all schools are, with [[Rounding#Round half up|rounded-up]] numbers (data from 2008—2014): &lt;!--DON'T ADD OTHER COUNTRIES. THEY DON'T HAVE SOLELY ARABIC AS THE ONLY MANDATED LANGUAGE AT SCHOOLS--&gt;

'''Mohan Rakesh''' (मोहन राकेश; 8 January 1925{{spaced ndash}}3 January 1972) was one of the pioneers of the ''Nai Kahani'' ("New Story") literary movement of the [[Hindi literature]] in the 1950s. He wrote the first modern Hindi play, ''[[Ashadh Ka Ek Din]]'' (One Day in Aashad) (1958), which won a competition organised by the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]]. He made significant contributions to the novel, the short story, travelogue, criticism, memoir and drama.&lt;ref name=com&gt;{{cite book |title=The Columbia encyclopedia of modern drama, Volume 2 |author=Gabrielle H.

He was awarded the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Award]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sangeetnatak.com/programmes_recognition&amp;honours_drama_playwriting.html Drama – Playwriting Awards] [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] Official listings.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607104701/http://www.sangeetnatak.com/programmes_recognition%26honours_drama_playwriting.html |date=7 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Born as Madan Mohan Guglani on 8 January 1925 in [[Amritsar]], [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]]. His father a lawyer died when he was sixteen.&lt;ref name=com/&gt; He did his M.A. in English and Hindi from [[Punjab University, Lahore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abhivyakti-hindi.org/lekhak/m/mohanrakesh.htm Mohan Rakesh Biography and Works]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiaclub.com/shop/AuthorSelect.asp?Author=Mohan+Rakesh Mohan Rakesh bio and books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He started his career as a teacher at [[Elphinstone College]], Bombay (now Mumbai) from 1947 to 1949, after that he shifted to Delhi, but found a teaching job in [[Jalandhar]], Punjab for a short while. Subsequently, he remained Head of the Hindi department at DAV College, Jalandhar ([[Guru Nanak Dev University]]) and a school in Shimla for two years before coming back to teaching Jalandhar. Eventually, he resigned from his job in 1957 to write full-time. He also briefly edited Hindi literary journal ''Sarika'', from 1962-63.&lt;ref name=com/&gt;&lt;ref name=du/&gt;

His noted novels are ''Andhere Band Kamare'' (''Closed Dark Rooms'') and ''Na Aane Wala Kal'' (The Tomorrow That Never Comes).

''[[Lahron Ke Rajhans]]'' (''The Swans of the Waves''), a noted play of Mohan Rakesh about an ancient Buddhist tale on the renunciation of the [[Buddha]], and its aftereffects on his close family, was first written as a short story and later turned into a [[radio play]] for [[All India Radio]] [[Jalandhar]], and broadcast under the title ''Sundri'', though his struggle over different versions of the play lasted for nearly 20 years, before creating his masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The modernity of Sanskrit |author=Simona Sawhney|publisher=Univ. of Minnesota Press|year=2008|isbn=0-8166-4996-0|page=73 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1Bs-GD7yZIC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=%22Shyamanand+Jalan%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ycd1TaKeKsTNrQer0PW_Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Shyamanand%20Jalan%22&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Indian directors [[Om Shivpuri]], [[Shyamanand Jalan]], [[Arvind Gaur]] and [[Ram Gopal Bajaj]] directed this play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2005/11/18/stories/2005111802360300.htm More than just a manuscript!] Romesh Chander, ''[[The Hindu]]'', 18 November 2005. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224131012/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2005/11/18/stories/2005111802360300.htm |date=24 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, this very writing process of the play, and Mohan Rakesh's diary, writings, and letters about the play, were recreated in a play titled ''Manuscript'', by a Delhi theatre group.

==Personal life==
Rakesh was first married in 1950 in an arranged marriage which ended in divorce in 1957. His second marriage in 1960 too ended soon. However, in his third marriage to Anita Aulakh in 1963, he had found love. At the time of the marriage Anita was 21 year old. After his death, she continued to live in Delhi and, now in her seventies, lives in East of Kailash neighbourhood. Her autobiographical work, ''Satrein Aur Satrein'', was first serialized in the Hindi magazine ''Sarika'', and later published in 2002.&lt;ref name=du&gt;

'''Namibian Black German''', also '''NBG''', ({{lang-de|Küchendeutsch}}, "kitchen German") is a [[pidgin]] language of [[Namibia]] that derives from [[German language|standard German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|series=Language Sciences

|publisher=Elsevier Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is nearly extinct. It was spoken mostly by Namibians who did not learn standard German during the period of [[German South-West Africa|German rule]]. It was never a first language. It is currently spoken as a second language by people over 50 years old,{{when|date=May 2015}} who these days usually also speak German, [[Afrikaans]], or English.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== History ==
Colonial acquisition of German in Namibia often took place outside of formal education and was primarily self-taught. Like many pidgin languages, Namibian Black German developed through limited access to the standard language and was restricted to the work environment.

Currently several hundred thousand Namibians speak German as a second language, and while [[German language in Namibia#Namibian German as a dialect|Namibian German]] often does not adhere to standard German, it is not pidgin.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Prepositions==
English and Afrikaans have left an influence on the development of NBG, leading to three primary prepositional patterns:{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
*adding a preposition where Standard German would use the accusative
*dropping prepositions which are usually present in Standard German
*changing the preposition that is required by the verb

==Examples==
Examples of phrases with Standard German equivalents:
* ''Lange nicht sehen ''- long no see ("Lange nicht gesehen")
* ''Was Banane kosten? ''- How much does the banana cost? ("Was kostet die/eine Banane?")
* ''spät Uhr'' - 'late hour', meaning 'it's late' ("es ist spät")
* ''Herr fahren Jagd, nicht Haus'' - "Master went hunting and he's not at home" ("Der Herr ist zur Jagd gefahren und ist nicht zu Hause")

[[File:Jan Hus 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jan Hus]], regarded as the author]]
'''''De orthographia bohemica''''' ({{lang-en|On Bohemian Orthography}}) is a [[Latin language|Latin]] work published between 1406 and 1412. It is attributed to [[Charles University]] rector and reformer [[Jan Hus]]. The book codified the [[Czech language]]'s modern spelling and orthography and had decisive impact on the orthography of a number of other European languages.

''Orthographia bohemica'' was the first known document in which spelling reforms were suggested for a Slavic language. It introduced, among other reforms, the [[diacritic]] signs ´ and ˇ which are now used in the Baltic languages Lithuanian and Latvian, in other Slavic languages like Croatian, Slovak, Slovenian and partly Polish, and in several other European languages{{Explain|date=September 2018|reason=Caron too? And has the accent anything to do with Hus?}}.

==Provenance== 
Literacy in native languages became also one of the chief projects for the Czech [[Reformation]] including the first  [[Hussites]] but especially for their later [[Unity of the Brethren]] branch with their bishop [[Comenius]].
While the author's identity and the precise date of authorship are unknown, it is widely held that the author is [[Jan Hus]] and the year of creation somewhere between 1406 and 1412, based on historical and philological studies.

==Contents==
The primary purpose of ''De orthographia bohemica'' was to simplify and unify Czech orthography in order to promote literacy by making the language "clearer and easier" to read and write.  Instead of representing sounds using [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] and [[Trigraph (orthography)|trigraphs]], it proposed a "diacritic orthography", where one letter indicates only one sound, and different but related sounds (such as those now represented by ''r'' and ''ř'') are distinguished by diacritics.  Briefly, one can summarize the spelling changes in  Orthographia Bohemica as follows:
*The basic letters of the [[Latin alphabet]] (as well as the Latin digraph ''ch'') were to be used for writing Czech, with sound values according to the conventions of medieval Latin pronunciation in [[Bohemia]] at the time.  The only difference was that the letter ''c'' was always to be used to represent the sound {{IPA|/ts/}}, and never for {{IPA|/k/}}. ''d'' represented /d/ as in Latin, and the letter ''g'' before ''e'' and ''i'' represented {{IPA|/j/}}; in other cases ''g'' represented {{IPA|/ɡ/}}.

|}

*Czech consonants that Latin did not possess would be represented by a Latin letter adorned with a diacritic dot.  In particular, as Czech additionally possessed [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized consonants]] and a hard ''l'', the dot indicated softness above ''n'', ''d'', ''t'', ''c'' and ''z'', and hardness for ''l''.
*Long vowels (which Latin possessed but did not indicate) were to be indicated by the [[čárka]] (an [[acute accent]]) above ''a'', ''e'', ''i'' and ''y''.

To illustrate the simple and revolutionary nature of this spelling, take as an example the various ways of representing ř, compared with that seen in the  grammar of [[Jan Gebauer]]. In manuscripts written before Hus, all of the following representations were in use: ''rz'', ''rrz'', ''rs'', ''rzs'', ''rzss'', ''zr'', ''sr'', ''rzs'' and ''rzz''. Long vowels were written either with no indication of the length, or written double (sometimes with the second letter written in [[superscript]]), or with any of a wide and unstandardized range of diacritical marks.  One could not even assume that the same scribe would consistently use their own conventions, and their use often varied even within a single manuscript.

==Significance and impact==
[[File:Praha, Nove Mesto - kostel Panny Marie na Slovanech.jpg|thumb|right|Emmaus Monastery in [[Prague]] was the last monastery in the kingdom still using the historic Slavic Glagolitic script]]
''Orthographia bohemica'' was the first known document in which such [[spelling reform]]s were suggested for a [[Slavic language]]. It is not yet fully clear where Jan Hus drew inspiration for this work.  Considered in the context of the contemporaneous study of letters of [[St. Jerome]] by Danish scholars of [[Hebrew]] working at the [[Sorbonne]], there was a good knowledge of such orthographic practices at the time (particularly the designation of long vowels).  According to a study by [[F. V. Mareš]], a stimulus for the project was the author's knowledge of [[Glagolitic]],  used by [[Croats|Croatian]] monks in the [[Emmaus Monastery]] (''Na Slovanech'') in [[Prague]].

The significance of the document lies in the longevity and wide application of its logical system of diacritics. Its impact is apparent in the ''Náměšťská mluvnice'' ("Grammar of [[Náměšť nad Oslavou|Náměšť]]"), the first grammar of the Czech language, published in 1533, but the adoption of the new rules was relatively slow and far from uniform.  Throughout the 16th century, some printers and typesetters ignored the prescriptions of ''Orthographia bohemica'' and continued to maintain some digraphs (e.g. ''ss'' for {{IPA|/ʃ/}} instead of ''š''), although their use became considerably more uniform. In addition, scribes adopted the new rules much more slowly than book printers.

==Discovery and publication==
[[File:František Palacký.jpg|thumb|right|[[František Palacký]] who found the original manuscript]]
The manuscript for ''Orthographia bohemica'' was found by [[František Palacký]] on 13 August 1826, in [[Třeboň]] in the south of Bohemia. The public was made aware of the existence of the work a year later, with the first issue of the newly founded journal ''Časopis společnosti vlastenského Museum v Čechách'' ("Journal of the Society of the National Museum in Bohemia"), but its publication had to wait a further thirty years.  The Latin text with translation appeared in 1857 in ''Slavische Bibliothek'' in Vienna thanks to A. V. Šembera, who worked at the time at the university as Professor of Czech Language and Literature.  A year later in Prague, the fifth volume of ''Mistra Jana Husi sebrané spisy'' ("Collected Works of Master Jan Hus") appeared with a Czech translation and a short introduction by [[Václav Flajšhans]], to date the latest Czech translation of this manuscript.  The Latin text was published twice more: first in the unaltered Šembera edition by ''Slavische Bibliothek'' (Amsterdam, 1965) and second with a German translation and commentary by J. Schröpfer in Wiesbaden, Germany in 1968.

Šembera's Latin text was probably taken directly from Palacký's copy of the manuscript; Schröpfer produced a new revised (though not flawless) edition of the manuscript. A critical evaluation comparing the preserved Třeboň manuscript with the extant excerpts has yet to appear.

==Preserved manuscripts==
[[File:PragueCastle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Prague Castle]], location of the remaining excerpts]]
A manuscript of ''Orthographia bohemica'' in Jan Hus' hand has still not been found; the only complete copy of the manuscript which is available for study was written by a monk Oldřich Kříž of Třeboň (i.e. the copy found by Palacký).  Its age can not be accurately determined as the copy is not dated. The end of the manuscript contains the inscription ''In die Leonardi'', i.e. on January 6; however, this may indicate either the date of completion of the original manuscript or Oldřich Kříž's copy.  In the same volume as ''Orthographia bohemica'', however, are some more works: three of them bear the year 1459 and one 1457. The writings are not arranged chronologically, however, and so they serve only as an approximate guide for determining the age of the manuscript.

In addition to the Kříž manuscript there are various excerpts deposited in the archives of [[Prague Castle]]. [[Anežka Vidmanová]]'s comparative study with the manuscript of Oldřich Kříž shows that the Třeboň manuscript is unreliable in many places.

A '''paragraph''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] παράγραφος ''paragraphos'', "''to write beside''" or "''written beside''") is a self-contained unit of a discourse in [[writing]] dealing with a particular point or [[idea]]. A paragraph consists of one or more [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s.&lt;ref name="UNC" /&gt; Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer [[prose]].

==History==

The oldest classical Greek and Latin writing had little or no space between words and could be written in [[boustrophedon]] (alternating directions). Over time, text direction (left to right) became standardized, and [[word divider]]s and [[terminal punctuation]] became common. The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original ''[[paragraphos]]'', similar to an [[underscore]] at the beginning of the new group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of the English Paragraph|author=Edwin Herbert Lewis|date=1894|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DwjAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek ''paragraphos'' evolved into the [[pilcrow]] (¶), which in English manuscripts in the [[Middle Ages]] can be seen inserted inline between sentences. The [[Fleuron (typography)|hedera leaf]] (e.g. ☙) has also been used in the same way.
[[File:United States Constitution.jpg|thumb|Indented paragraphs demonstrated in the US Constitution]]

In ancient manuscripts, another means to divide sentences into paragraphs was a line break ([[newline]]) followed by an [[initial]] at the beginning of the next paragraph. An initial is an oversized capital letter, sometimes outdented beyond the margin of the text. This style can be seen, for example, in the original [[Old English]] manuscript of [[Beowulf]]. Outdenting is still used in English typography, though not commonly.&lt;ref name="Bringhurst2005" /&gt;
Modern English typography usually indicates a new paragraph by [[Indentation (typesetting)|indenting]] the first line. This style can be seen in the (handwritten) [[United States Constitution]] from 1787. For additional ornamentation, a hedera leaf or other symbol can be added to the inter-paragraph whitespace, or put in the indentation space.

A second common modern English style is to use no indenting, but add vertical white space to create "block paragraphs." On a typewriter, a double [[carriage return]] produces a blank line for this purpose; professional typesetters (or [[word processing]] software) may put in an arbitrary vertical space by adjusting [[leading]]. This style is very common in electronic formats, such as on the [[World Wide Web]] and [[email]].

==Typographical considerations==

[[Widows and orphans]] occur when the first line of a paragraph is the last line in a column or page, or when the last line of a paragraph is the first line of a new column or page.

Professionally printed material in English typically does not indent the first paragraph, but indents those that follow. For example, [[Robert Bringhurst]] states that we should "Set opening paragraphs flush left."&lt;ref name="Bringhurst2005"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Elements of Typographic Style|last= Bringhurst|first=Robert|year= 2005|publisher= Hartley and Marks|location= Vancouver|isbn= 0-88179-206-3|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bringhurst explains as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The function of a paragraph is to mark a pause, setting the paragraph apart from what precedes it. If a paragraph is preceded by a title or subhead, the indent is superfluous and can therefore be omitted.&lt;ref name="Bringhurst2005" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Elements of Typographic Style'' states that "at least one [[En space|en [space]]]" should be used to indent paragraphs after the first,&lt;ref name="Bringhurst2005" /&gt; noting that that is the "practical minimum".&lt;ref name="Bringhurst2005a"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Elements of Typographic Style|last= Bringhurst|first=Robert|year= 2005|publisher= Hartley and Marks|location= Vancouver|isbn= 0-88179-206-3|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[em space]] is the most commonly used paragraph indent.&lt;ref name="Bringhurst2005a" /&gt; [[Miles Tinker]], in his book ''Legibility of Print'', concluded that indenting the first line of paragraphs increases [[readability]] by 7%, on the average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Legibility of Print|last=Tinker|first=Miles A.|year= 1963|publisher= Iowa State University Press|location= Iowa|isbn= 0-8138-2450-8|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In computing==
{{See also|Newline}}
In [[word processing]] and [[desktop publishing]], a '''hard return''' or '''paragraph break''' indicates a new paragraph, to be distinguished from the '''soft return''' at the end of a line internal to a paragraph.
This distinction allows [[word wrap]] to automatically re-flow text as it is edited, without losing paragraph breaks.  The software may apply vertical whitespace or indenting at paragraph breaks, depending on the selected style.

How such documents are actually stored depends on the [[file format]].  For example, [[HTML]] uses the &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; tag as a paragraph container.  In [[plaintext]] files, there are two common formats.  Pre-formatted text will have a [[newline]] at the end of every physical line, and two newlines at the end of a paragraph, creating a blank line.  An alternative is to only put newlines at the end of each paragraph, and leave word wrapping up to the application that displays or processes the text.

A line break that is inserted manually, and preserved when re-flowing, may still be distinct from a paragraph break, although this is typically not done in [[prose]]. [[HTML]]'s &amp;lt;br&amp;nbsp;/&amp;gt; tag produces a line break without ending the paragraph; the [[W3C]] recommends using it only to separate lines of verse (where each "paragraph" is a [[stanza]]), or in a [[street address]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/br|title=&lt;br&gt;: The Line Break element|author=|date=|website=MDN Web Docs|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numbering==
{{See also|Newline}}
Paragraphs are commonly numbered using the decimal system, where (in books) the integral part of the decimal represents the number of the chapter and the fractional parts are arranged in each chapter in order of magnitude. Thus in Whittaker and Watson's 1921 ''[[A Course of Modern Analysis]]'', chapter 9 is devoted to Fourier Series; within that chapter §9.6 introduces Riemann's theory, the following section §9.61 treats an associated function, following §9.62 some properties of that function, following §9.621 a related lemma, while §9.63 introduces Riemann's main theorem, and so on. Whittaker and Watson attribute this system of numbering to [[Giuseppe Peano]] on their "Contents" page, although this attribution does not seem to be widely credited elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kowwalski|first1=E.|title=Peano paragraphing|url=http://blogs.ethz.ch/kowalski/2008/06/03/peano-paragraphing/|website=blogs.ethz.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Section breaks ==

{{main|Section (typography)}}

Many published books use a device to separate certain paragraphs further when there is a change of scene or time. This extra space, especially when co-occurring at a page or section break, may contain an [[asterisk]], three asterisks, a special stylistic [[dingbat]], or a special symbol known as an [[asterism (typography)|asterism]].

==Purpose and style advice==

A [[List of common English usage misconceptions#Usage|common English usage misconception]] is that a paragraph has three to five sentences; single-word paragraphs can be seen in some professional writing, and journalists often use single-sentence paragraphs.&lt;ref name="UNC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/paragraphs/|title=Paragraph Development|author=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|first=|date=|work=The Writing Center|publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crafting of clear, coherent paragraphs is the subject of considerable stylistic debate.  Forms generally vary among types of writing.  For example, newspapers, scientific journals, and fictional essays have somewhat different conventions for the placement of paragraph breaks.

English students are sometimes taught that a paragraph should have a [[topic sentence]] or "main idea", preferably first, and multiple "supporting" or "detail" sentences which explain or supply evidence.  One technique of this type, intended for essay writing, is known as the [[Schaffer paragraph]].  For example, the following excerpt from [[Samuel Johnson|Dr. Samuel Johnson]]'s ''Lives of the English Poets'', the first sentence is the main idea: that [[Joseph Addison]] is a skilled "describer of life and manners". The succeeding sentences are details that support and explain the main idea in a specific way.



This advice differs from stock advice for the construction of paragraphs in Japanese (translated as ''danraku'' 段落).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalt.org/pansig/2004/HTML/KimKon.htm|title=Effective writing instruction: From Japanese danraku to English paragraphs|first=Kazumi Kimura and Masako Kondo (timkondo *AT* nifty . com / Kazumikmr *AT* aol .|last=com)|date=|website=jalt.org|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17207">In the study of [[syntax]], a '''parasitic gap''' is a construction in which one "gap" appears to be dependent on another "gap", that is, the one gap can appear only by virtue of the appearance of the other gap, hence the former is said to be "parasitic" on the latter, e.g. ''Which explanation did you reject __&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; without first really considering __&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;?'' While parasitic gaps are present in English and some related Germanic languages, e.g. Swedish (see [[Elisabet Engdahl|Engdahl]] 1983), their appearance is much more restricted in other, closely related languages, e.g. German and the Romance languages.&lt;ref&gt;Parasitic gaps have been studied most using English and Swedish data. See Engdahl's seminal article (1983) in this regard.&lt;/ref&gt; An aspect of parasitic gaps that makes them particularly mysterious is the fact they usually appear inside [[Wh-movement#Extraction_islands|islands to extraction]]. Although the study of parasitic gaps began in the late 1970s, no consensus has yet been reached about the best analysis.&lt;ref&gt;See the introduction in Culicover's and Postal's collection of papers (2001) for an overview of the varying theoretical accounts of parasitic gaps.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The phenomenon==

The following b-sentences illustrate typical parasitic gaps. The parasitic gaps are marked with a p-subscript:

::a. You reviewed '''that book''' without actually reading '''it'''. &lt;small&gt;– No gap at all present&lt;/small&gt; 
::b. '''What book''' did you review __ without actually reading __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;? &lt;small&gt;– Parasitic gap possible&lt;/small&gt;
::c. *You reviewed '''that book''' without actually reading __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;small&gt;– Parasitic gap impossible without "real" gap&lt;/small&gt;

::a. They played '''that song''' repeatedly despite not liking '''it'''. &lt;small&gt;– No gap at all present&lt;/small&gt;
::b. '''Which song''' did they play __ repeatedly despite not liking __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;? &lt;small&gt;– Parasitic gap possible&lt;/small&gt;
::c. *They played '''that song''' repeatedly despite not liking __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;small&gt;– Parasitic gap impossible without "real" gap&lt;/small&gt;

::a. You bought '''that old bike''' in order to fix '''it''' up. &lt;small&gt;– No gap at all present&lt;/small&gt;
::b. '''Which old''' bike did you buy __ in order to fix __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; up? &lt;small&gt;– Parasitic gap possible&lt;/small&gt;
::c. *You bought '''that old bike''' in order to fix __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; up. &lt;small&gt;– Parasitic gap impossible without "real" gap  
&lt;/small&gt;

The a-sentences are normal declarative sentences that contain no gaps at all. Each b-sentence, in contrast, contains two gaps, whereby the second gap is parasitic on the first. The c-sentences illustrate that if there is no "real" gap (that corresponds to the wh-expression in bold), the parasitic gap is not possible. One interesting thing about parasitic gaps like the ones here in the b-sentences is their motivation. Their appearance appears to be reliant on [[syntactic movement]] (e.g. [[wh-movement]] or [[topicalization]]). The fact, however, that there are two gaps in each b-sentence but only one fronted wh-expression is a source of the difficulty associated with the construction. How does it come to pass that one fronted wh-expression is capable of licensing two gaps? Another interesting fact about parasitic gaps is that they usually appear inside extraction [[Wh-movement#Extraction islands|islands]] (as they do in the examples just given), hence one might expect extraction from the site of parasitic gaps to be altogether impossible. The fact that the islands are ignored is a second source of challenge associated with the phenomenon.

==Some historical notes==

The phenomenon of parasitic gaps appears to have been discovered by [[John Robert Ross]] in the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;See Ross' seminal dissertation (1967/86) in this regard.&lt;/ref&gt; but remained undiscussed until papers by [[Knut Tarald Taraldsen]] and [[Elisabet Engdahl]] explored the properties of the phenomenon in detail.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Engdahl's 1983 article in this regard – more than any other paper, this one got the ball rolling.&lt;/ref&gt; The knowledge of parasitic gaps was central to the development of the GPSG framework ([[Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar]]) in the mid 1980s, this knowledge then being refined later in the HPSG framework ([[Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar]]) of Carl Pollard and [[Ivan Sag]]. In the 90s, a debate centered around the best theoretical analysis of parasitic gaps (extraction vs. percolation), this debate culminating in a collection of essays edited by Peter Culicover and Paul Postal in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;In addition to the essays, Culicover's and Postal's book also contains an extensive overview of earlier accounts of the phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some traits of parasitic gaps==

The following subsections briefly explore some aspects of parasitic gaps that have been widely acknowledged in the literature on parasitism. The following areas are addressed:
#many parasitic gaps appear optionally;
#some parasitic gaps appear obligatorily;
#parasitic gaps appear in missing object constructions; and
#syntactic parallelism seems to promote the appearance of parasitic gaps.

===Optional parasitic gaps===

Many parasitic gaps appear optionally. They are in non-complementary distribution with a pronoun, meaning that the speaker has the choice whether to employ the gap or not, e.g.

::a. '''Which dish''' did you order __ after you tried __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;? &lt;small&gt;– Parasitic gap present&lt;/small&gt;
::b. '''Which dish''' did you order __ after you tried '''it'''? &lt;small&gt;– Parasitic gap absent&lt;/small&gt;

::a. '''Which movie''' will they like __ as soon as they see __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;? &lt;small&gt;– Parasitic gap present&lt;/small&gt; 
::b. '''Which movie''' will they like __ as soon as they see '''it'''? &lt;small&gt;– Parasitic gap absent&lt;/small&gt;

The a-sentence contain typical parasitic gaps, whereas the b-sentence choose to use a pronoun instead of the gap. In other words, the parasitic gap in the a-sentences is occurring optionally. Optionality like this suggests an analysis of parasitism in terms of [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]], since optionality is the primary trait of known ellipsis mechanisms.

===Obligatory parasitic gaps===

While many parasitic gaps occur optionally as just illustrated, other parasitic gaps occur obligatorily. This can be the case when the parasitic gap precedes the "real" gap, e.g.

::a. The rumor about '''the girl''' annoyed '''her'''. &lt;small&gt;– No gap at all present&lt;/small&gt;
::b. '''Which girl''' did [the rumor about __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;] annoy __? &lt;small&gt;– Parasitic gap precedes "real" gap&lt;/small&gt;
::c. ??'''Which girl''' did the rumor about '''her''' annoy __? &lt;small&gt;– Real gap hardly possible unless the parasitic gap is present; weak crossover has occurred&lt;/small&gt;

::a. If you get to know '''him''', you will like '''Bill'''. &lt;small&gt;– No gap at all present&lt;/small&gt;
::b. Bill is the type of guy '''who''' [if you get to know __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;], you will like __. &lt;small&gt;– Parasitic gap precedes "real" gap&lt;/small&gt;
::c. ??Bill is the type of guy '''who''' if you get to know '''him''', you will like __. &lt;small&gt;– Real gap hardly possible unless the parasitic gap is present; weak crossover has occurred&lt;/small&gt;

These examples illustrate a couple of important facts about parasitic gaps. The b-sentences demonstrate that the parasitic gap can indeed precede the "real" gap, and the strong marginality of the c-sentences shows that in a sense, the real gap can also be dependent on the parasitic gap. Note that we know that the first gap (the leftmost gap) in the b-sentences is parasitic on the following gap because it, i.e. the leftmost gap, appears inside what is normally an extraction island (marked with square brackets). The aspect of parasitic gaps illustrated with these examples is addressed in terms of the [[Crossover effects|weak crossover]] phenomenon (WCO).&lt;ref&gt;Concerning the importance of weak crossover to the theory of parasitic gaps, see for instance Engdahl (1983:17ff.), Culicover (2001:32f.), and Levine and Hukari 2001:194).&lt;/ref&gt; The WCO phenomenon occurs when a fronted expression is coreferential with an intermediate expression that appears between the fronted expression and the position of its gap. In the big picture, one can simply note that parasitic gaps behave variable depending upon whether they precede or follow the "real" gap. When they precede the "real" gap, their appearance is usually obligatory.

===Missing object constructions===
Much work on parasitism assumes that parasitic gaps are dependent on another gap, the "real" gap in the examples above. Hence the assumption is that parasitic gaps are reliant on those mechanisms that license normal extraction gaps, e.g. wh-movement and topicalization. This assumption is challenged, however, by so-called missing-object constructions (also known as ''tough''-constructions),&lt;ref&gt;The ability of missing-object constructions to license parasitic gaps is widely acknowledged, e.g. Engdahl (1983:12f.), Postal (2001:257), Culicover (2001:34).&lt;/ref&gt; e.g.

::a. It is easy to appreciate '''her''' after getting to know '''her'''. &lt;small&gt;– No gap present&lt;/small&gt;
::b. '''She''' is easy to appreciate __ after getting to know __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;small&gt;– Parasitic gap present despite the lack of wh-fronting and topicalization&lt;/small&gt;

::a. It is hard to understand '''this essay''' without reading '''it''' several times. &lt;small&gt;– No gap present&lt;/small&gt;		
::b. '''This essay''' is hard to understand __ without reading __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; several times. &lt;small&gt;– Parasitic gap present despite the lack of wh-fronting and topicalization&lt;/small&gt;

::a. It will be tough to get '''the motor''' running without entirely rebuilding '''it'''. &lt;small&gt;– No gap present&lt;/small&gt;
::b. '''The motor''' will be tough to get __ running without entirely rebuilding __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;small&gt;– Parasitic gap present despite the lack of wh-fronting and topicalization&lt;/small&gt;

The a-sentences lack gaps entirely. The b-sentences contain parasitic gaps despite the fact that neither wh-movement nor topicalization has occurred. The b-sentences illustrate missing-object constructions, since the verbs ''appreciate'', ''understand'', and ''get'' are transitive and should hence take an object. This object is missing, as marked by the gap on the left. Whatever the analysis of parasitic gaps ends up being in the long run, it will have to accommodate the facts involving missing objects illustrated here. Movement (wh-movement, topicalization) may actually &lt;big&gt;not&lt;/big&gt; be the key factor licensing parasitic gaps.

===The role of parallelism===

Examining the examples of optional parasitic gaps produced above so far, one sees that in each case, a certain parallelism is present.&lt;ref&gt;The role played by syntactic parallelism in determining the distribution of parasitic gaps has been explored by many, e.g. Williams (1990), Munn (2001), Culicover (2013:153ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; This parallelism is now illustrated using brackets:

::a. '''Which manuscript''' did you [resubmit __] after [revising __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;]?
						 
::b. '''Which foods''' does he [fantasize about __] without [ever eating __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;]? 
		 
::c. '''Which report''' did you [file __] without [reading __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;]? 		
							 
::d. '''Which old bike''' did he [buy __] in order to [fix __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; up]?	
						 
::e. '''Which girl''' did you [ask __ out] before [meeting __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; in person]?

In each of these examples, the square brackets mark what appear to be parallel structures, as associated with the coordinate structures of [[Coordination (linguistics)|coordination]]. The brackets mark [[verb phrase]]s (VPs), whereby the subordinator appearing between the brackets is functioning like a coordinator (i.e. ''and'', ''or'', or ''but''). This parallelism may be a significant factor that is aiding the appearance of the parasitic gaps. When this parallelism is absent, there is a significant drop in acceptability of the parasitic gap:

::a. ?'''Who''' [ __ secretly supports John] without [John secretly supporting __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; back]?	

::b. ?'''Which girl''' [ __ likes Billy] without [Billy liking __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; back]?			
				 
::c. ?'''Which spy''' [ __ escaped] without [anyone first identifying __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;]? 			
		 
::d. ??'''Which explanation''' [ __ had to be repeated] for [us to finally get __&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;]?		
 
::e. ??'''Which report''' [ __ was filed] without [any of us first reading ___&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;]?

These instances of parasitic gaps are all marginal to varying degrees. The marginality is probably due to the lack of syntactic parallelism indicated by the brackets, the gaps no longer appearing on the same side of the brackets. In any case, there is a noticeable drop in acceptability when the parallelism in the examples further above is removed. What exactly explains this drop in acceptability is not entirely clear, although it may have to do with ease of processing. Parallel structures are easier for humans to process, and hence parasitic gaps are reliant on a low processing load.

==Theoretical controversy==

The theoretical analysis of parasitic gaps is not a settled matter by any means, since accounts of the phenomenon vary drastically. In very broad terms, there are two lines of analysis that one can pursue. The first is to assume that parasitic gaps are extraction gaps (''the extraction analysis'');&lt;ref&gt;For two examples of the extraction analysis of parasitic gaps, see Contreras (1984) and Chomsky (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; parasitic gaps arise by way of the same basic mechanism that licenses "normal" extraction gaps. This sort of approach must augment the analysis of extraction gaps in some way in order to accommodate parasitic gaps under the same theoretical umbrella. The alternative approach rejects the analysis that takes parasitic gaps to be extraction gaps. One assumes instead that parasitic gaps actually contain a covert element, this element having the status of definite proform. (''the proform analysis'').&lt;ref&gt;For examples of the proform analysis, see Cinque 1990, Fiengo and May 1994, Postal 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Some analyses mix and match these two basic lines of analysis, although in general, both are well represented in the literature on parasitism and most accounts can be placed in the one or the other camp.

Extraction analyses have the advantage that they immediately accommodate the simple observation that most parasitic gaps appear to be dependent on the occurrence of wh-movement or topicalization. Extraction analyses are challenged, however, by missing-object constructions, as noted above. Proform analyses have the advantage that they immediately accommodate the simple observation that many parasitic gaps occur optionally; the covert proform has the option to be overt. The proform analyses are challenged, however, by the fact that most parasitic gaps occur in the immediate environment of wh-movement or topicalization, since they do not provide a clear basis for explaining this correlation.

According to 19th-century linguist [[James Darmesteter]]  and modern linguist Michael M. T.

Scholars such as [[Abdul Hai Habibi]] and others believe that the earliest modern Pashto work dates back to [[Amir Kror Suri]] of the early [[Ghurid]] period in the eighth century, and they use the writings found in [[Pata Khazana]]. However, this is disputed by several modern experts such as [[David Neil MacKenzie]] and Lucia Serena Loi.&lt;ref&gt;David Neil MacKenzie: ''David N. Mackenzie: ''The Development of the Pashto Script''. In: Shirin Akiner (Editor): ''Languages and Scripts of Central Asia''.

Pata Khazana claims to contain an anthology of Pashto poets from the early Ghurid period up to the [[Hotak dynasty|Hotak]] period in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="Lucia Serena Loi 1987, p. 33"/&gt;

From the 16th century, Pashto poetry become very popular among the Pashtuns. Some of those who wrote in Pashto are [[Pir Roshan|Bayazid Pir Roshan]] (a major inventor of the [[Pashto alphabet]]), [[Khushal Khan Khattak]], [[Rahman Baba]], [[Nazo Tokhi]], and [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], founder of the modern state of Afghanistan or the [[Durrani Empire]].

In modern times, noticing the incursion of Persian and Arabic vocabulary, there is a strong desire to "[[Linguistic purism|purify]]" Pashto by restoring its old vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fdTJgCSPsGwC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=pashto+purification#v=onepage&amp;q=pashto%20purification&amp;f=false |title=Afghanistan 101: Understanding Afghan Culture |author=Ehsan M Entezar |page=89 |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4257-9302-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name="BensonKosonen2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carol Benson|author2=Kimmo Kosonen|title=Language Issues in Comparative Education: Inclusive Teaching and Learning in Non-Dominant Languages and Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tdREAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64|date=13 June 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-6209-218-1|pages=64–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hewad.com/mohammadgul/ Muhammad Gul Khan Momand], Hewād Afghanistan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
{{Main article|Pashto grammar}}
Pashto is a [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV) language with [[split ergativity]]. [[Adjective]]s come before [[noun]]s. Nouns and adjectives are [[inflection|inflected]] for two [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masc./fem.),&lt;ref&gt;Emeneau, M. B. (1962) “Bilingualism and Structural Borrowing” ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 106(5): pp. 430–442, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; two [[Grammatical number|numbers]] (sing./plur.), and four [[Grammatical case|cases]] (direct, oblique I, oblique II and vocative). There is also an inflection for the [[subjunctive mood]]. The [[verb]] system is very intricate with the following tenses: present, simple past, past progressive, present perfect and past perfect. The sentence construction of Pashto has similarities with some other Indo-Iranian languages such as [[Prakrit]] and [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]]. The possessor precedes the possessed in the genitive construction. The verb generally agrees with the subject in both transitive and intransitive sentences. An exception occurs when a completed action is reported in any of the past tenses (simple past, past progressive, present perfect or past perfect). In such cases, the verb agrees with the subject if it is intransitive, but if it is transitive, it agrees with the object,&lt;ref name="Pashto-language"/&gt; therefore Pashto shows a partly [[ergative-absolutive language|ergative]] behaviour. Like [[Kurdish grammar|Kurdish]], but unlike most other Indo-Iranian languages, Pashto uses all three types of [[adpositional phrase|adpositions]] – prepositions, postpositions and circumpositions.

&lt;span style="background:#EEE8AA;padding:0px 2px;"&gt;Phonemes&lt;/span&gt; that have been borrowed, thus non-native to Pashto, are colour-coded. The phonemes {{IPA|/q, f/}} tend to be replaced by {{IPA|[k]}}, {{IPA|[p]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tegey|first1=Habibullah|last2=Robson|first2=Barbara|title=A Reference Grammar of Pashto|publisher=Center for Applied Linguistics|location=Washington|year=1996|page=15|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED399825.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[retroflex lateral flap]] {{IPA|/ɭ̆/}} ({{IPA|ɺ̢ }} or {{IPA|{{PUA|}}}}) is pronounced as [[retroflex approximant]] {{IPA|[ɻ]}} when final.&lt;ref&gt;D.N. MacKenzie, 1990, “Pashto”, in Bernard Comrie, ed, ''The major languages of South Asia, the Middle East and Africa'', p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Penzl, 1965, ''A Reader of Pashto'', p 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The retroflex fricatives {{IPA|/ʂ, ʐ/}} and [[palatal fricative]]s {{IPA|/ç, ʝ/}} represent dialectally different pronunciations of the same sound, not separate phonemes. In particular, the retroflex fricatives, which represent the original pronunciation of these sounds, are preserved in the southern/southwestern dialects (especially the prestige dialect of [[Kandahar]]), while they are pronounced as palatal fricatives in the west-central dialects. Other dialects merge the original retroflexes with other existing sounds: The southeastern dialects merge them with the [[Postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] fricatives {{IPA|/ʃ, ʒ/}}, while the northern/northeastern dialects merge them with the [[Velar consonant|velar]] phonemes in an asymmetric pattern, pronouncing them as {{IPA|/x, ɡ/}} ('''not''' {{IPA|/ɣ/}}). Furthermore, according to Henderson (1983),&lt;ref name="Henderson 1983"/&gt; the west-central [[voiced palatal fricative]] {{IPA|/ʝ/}} actually occurs only in the [[Wardak Province]], and is merged into {{IPA|/ɡ/}} elsewhere in the region.

The [[velar]]s {{IPA|/k, ɡ, x, ɣ/}} followed by the [[close back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/u/}} assimilate into the [[Labialisation|labialized]] velars {{IPA|[kʷ, ɡʷ, xʷ, ɣʷ]}}.

Voiceless stops {{IPA|[p, t, t͡ʃ, k]}} are all [[Aspirated consonant|unaspirated]], like [[Spanish language|Spanish]], other [[Romance languages]], and [[Austronesian languages]]; they have slightly [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] allophones prevocalically in a stressed syllable.

In Pashto, most of the native elements of the lexicon are related to other [[Eastern Iranian languages]].

{{Main article|Pashto alphabet}}
Pashto employs the [[Pashto alphabet]], a modified form of the Perso-Arabic or [[Arabic script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hladczuk|title=International Handbook of Reading Education|date=1992|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313262531|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, [[Pir Roshan|Bayazid Pir Roshan]] introduced 13 new letters to the Pashto alphabet. The alphabet was further modified over the years.

The Pashto alphabet consists of 45 letters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ullah|first1=Noor|title=Pashto Grammar|date=2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4567-8007-4|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 4 diacritic marks. The following table gives the letters' isolated forms, along with the Latin equivalents and typical IPA values:

==Dialects==
{{main article|Pashto dialects}}
Pashto dialects are divided into two varieties, the “soft” southern variety ''Paṣ̌tō'', and the “hard” northern variety ''Pax̌tō'' (Pakhtu).&lt;ref name="T&amp;F"/&gt; Each variety is further divided into a number of dialects. The southern dialect of [[Wanetsi]] is the most distinctive Pashto dialect.

==Literature==
{{Main article|Pashto literature and poetry}}

Pashto-speakers have long had a tradition of [[oral literature]], including [[Afghan proverbs|proverbs]], stories, and poems. Written Pashto literature saw a rise in development in the 17th century mostly due to poets like [[Khushal Khan Khattak]] (1613–1689), who, along with [[Rahman Baba]] (1650–1715), is widely regarded as among the greatest Pashto poets. Both of these poets belonged to the modern day [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] region of [[Pakistan]]). From the time of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] (1722–1772), Pashto has been the language of the court. The first Pashto teaching text was written during the period of Ahmad Shah Durrani by Pir Mohammad Kakar with the title of ''Maʿrifat al-Afghānī'' ("The Knowledge of Afghani [Pashto]"). After that, the first grammar book of Pashto [[verb]]s was written in 1805 in India under the title of ''Riyāż al-Maḥabbah'' ("Training in Affection") through the patronage of Nawab Mohabat Khan, son of [[Hafiz Rahmat Khan]], chief of the [[Barech]]. Nawabullah Yar Khan, another son of Hafiz Rahmat Khan, in 1808 wrote a book of Pashto words entitled ''ʿAjāyib al-Lughāt'' ("Wonders of Languages").

===Poetry example===
An excerpt from the ''Kalām'' of [[Rahman Baba]]:

'''&lt;big&gt;
{{lang|ps|2=
زۀ رحمان پۀ خپله ګرم يم  چې مين يم&lt;br /&gt;
چې دا نور ټوپن مې بولي ګرم په څۀ
}}
&lt;/big&gt;'''

'''IPA:''' ''Zə ra.mɑn pə xpəl.a gram jəm t͡ʃe ma.jən jəm''&lt;br /&gt;
''t͡ʃe d̪ɑ nor ʈo.pan me bo.li gram pə t͡sə''

'''Transliteration:''' ''Zə Rahmān pə xpəla gram yəm če mayən yəm''&lt;br /&gt;
''Če dā nor ṭopan me boli gram pə tsə''

'''Translation:''' "I Rahman, myself am guilty that I am a lover,&lt;br /&gt;
On what does this other universe call me guilty."

===Proverbs===
Pashto also has a rich heritage of proverbs (Pashto ''matalūna'', sg. ''matal'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zellem |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Zellem |year=2014 |title=Mataluna: 151 Afghan Pashto Proverbs |publisher=Cultures Direct Press |isbn=978-0692215180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartlotti, Leonard and Raj Wali Shah Khattak, eds. (2006). ''Rohi Mataluna: Pashto Proverbs'', (revised and expanded edition). First edition by Mohammad Nawaz Tair and Thomas C. Edwards, eds. Peshawar, Pakistan: Interlit and Pashto Academy, Peshawar University.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a proverb:

'''&lt;big&gt;
{{lang|ps|2=
اوبه په ډانګ نه بېليږي
}}
&lt;/big&gt;'''

'''Transliteration:''' ''Uba pə ḍang na beliẓ̌i''

'''Translation:''' "One cannot divide water by [hitting it with] a pole."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6094">[[File:Gramsci 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|Antonio Gramsci, Father of Passive Revolution.]] 
'''Passive revolution''' is a term coined by Italian politician and philosopher [[Antonio Gramsci]] during the [[interwar period]] in Italy. Gramsci coined the term to refer to a significant change that is not a rupturous one, but a slow and gradual metamorphosis which could take years or generations to accomplish.&lt;ref&gt;Gramsci, Antonio, and David Forgacs. An Antonio Gramsci Reader: Selected Writings, 1916-1935. New York: Schocken, 1988. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gramsci uses "passive revolution" in a variety of contexts with slightly different meanings. The primary usage is to contrast the passive transformation of [[bourgeois]] society in nineteenth-century Italy with the active revolutionary process of the bourgeoisie in France. However, Gramsci also associates Italian fascism with the notion of passive revolution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Passive revolution is a transformation of the political and institutional structures without strong social processes. Also he uses the term for the mutations of the structures of [[capitalist]] economic production that he recognizes primarily in the development of the U.S. factory system of the 1920s and 1930s. 

But besides this usage of the term "passive revolution" as a descriptive tool of historical analysis, Gramsci seems to employ it like a suggestion as path for struggle. In a society subsumed within capital, the only way Gramsci can see to make a revolution is a relatively "passive" one through the institutions of civil society.&lt;ref&gt;Negri, Antonio, and Michael Hardt. Commonwealth. Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2011. 365-366&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tactics==
Gramsci outlines several main tactics to carry out a passive revolution.  These tactics all worked in tandem to gradually and organically change a society in such a way that met the demands of the ruling class. This is the concept of "organic change", change that appears to be self-starting and natural in the evolution of a society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gramsci, Antonio, and David Forgacs. An Antonio Gramsci Reader: Selected Writings, 1916-1935. New York: Schocken, 1988.  264-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Gramsci analyzed movements such as reformism and fascism, as well as the 'scientific management' and assembly line methods of Frederick Taylor and Henry Ford respectively as examples of passive revolution initiated by the bourgeoisie.

===Education===
Gramsci theorized that to transform a society, one had to be in firm control of the minds of children, as their world view has yet to be formed. Thus, he supported mandatory nationalized education, so that every child would learn and adopt the values, morals, and world views that they were taught.  This ensures that future generations will have a thought background in the revolutionary principles, ethos, and logos.  As well as giving the controlling party the ability to address the next generation directly, thus bypassing the discerning filter of the individual's parents.&lt;ref&gt;Gramsci, Antonio, and David Forgacs. An Antonio Gramsci Reader: Selected Writings, 1916-1935. New York: Schocken, 1988. pg 269&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
Gramsci’s theories revolved around the idea of creating a new [[cultural hegemony]] in society. One key aspect of how the new hegemony was to come into being was the control of language.  By controlling, and influencing the language of a society, the new hegemon could control how society speaks, and thus eventually how they begin to think.  This largely begins in the schools, but must be repeated in many outlets of society.  When one controls the way in which language is used, it can serve to influence how people think about any number of topics, based on what is socially permittable to say or not say.&lt;ref&gt;Gramsci, Antonio, and David Forgacs. An Antonio Gramsci Reader: Selected Writings, 1916-1935. New York: Schocken, 1988.250-251&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Gramsci looked at the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as a powerful force in Italian society, and was amazed by its ability to influence the hearts and minds of men. As a result, the Catholic Church became a rival hegemon in his theoretical passive revolution. Thus, Gramsci theorized that the Church had to be silenced as a rival hegemon in society. This could be eventually done by force, but a more successful strategy would be to infiltrate it with the revolutionary sense of morals, ethics, and logic.  This could not be an active measure, but a gradual shift, as the other tactics of revolution are implemented. Control or infiltration of religion would be of crucial importance. Religion must echo the "organic change" in society; it must serve to assist the new hegemony. Religion is an excellent means to this end because, by its very nature, people are willing to believe what comes from the pulpit, as being objectively good.&lt;ref&gt;Gramsci, Antonio, and David Forgacs. An Antonio Gramsci Reader: Selected Writings, 1916-1935. New York: Schocken, 1988. 266-267&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
The media is the lynchpin in Gramsci’s model. The media must be used smartly to repeat organically, edify, and buttress the revolutionary values and morals that are being disseminated throughout society (through education, language, and religion). The media ties together Gramsci’s other tactics, and fills any gaps that they might leave.  It must echo revolutionary morals, and further the social views of language, education, religion, and societal values. The media has a great control over the opinions of people, and this must be utilized, and not be allowed to influence in contrast to the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gramsci, Antonio, and David Forgacs. An Antonio Gramsci Reader: Selected Writings, 1916-1935. New York: Schocken, 1988.  267-269&lt;/ref&gt;
