'''Baku State University''' ('''BSU'''; {{lang-az|Bakı Dövlət Universiteti}}) is a [[public university]] located in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]. Established in 1919 by the Parliament of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], the University started with faculties of [[history]] and [[philology]]; [[physics]] and [[mathematics]]; [[law]] and [[medicine]] with an initial [[education|enrollment]] of 1094.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of BSU was [[Vasili Razumovsky|V.I.Razumovsky]], a former [[professor]] of surgery at [[Kazan University]].

In 1930, the government ordered the University shut down in accordance with a reorganization of [[higher education]], and the University was replaced with the Supreme Pedagogical Institute.  However, in 1934 the University was reestablished again, and continued to work through the difficult years of [[World War II]] experiencing a shortage of [[teacher|faculty members]].

By its 40th anniversary in 1959, the University already had 13 [[faculty (university)|faculties]].  The [[Azerbaijan Medical University]] and [[Azerbaijan State Economic University]] were both spun-offs of the original respective faculties at BSU.

Among the graduates of BSU were two former presidents of [[Azerbaijan]], [[Abulfaz Elchibey]] and [[Heydar Aliyev]]. The former graduated from the Faculty of Arabic Language and Literature, while the latter, who dominated Azerbaijan's political life for over 30 years, from the Faculty of History. [[Nobel Prize]]-winning physicist [[Lev Landau]] studied at BSU between 1922 and 1924.

BSU is the only university from Azerbaijan Republic ranked by international ranking organizations, such as University Ranking by Academic Performance and currently ranks at 1872 in the [[University Ranking by Academic Performance]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Coat of arms of Baku State University in 1919.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Coat of arms of Baku State University in 1919.]]
BSU was established on September 1, 1919 by the decision of the Parliament of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]. In its first year, the university had two faculties &amp;mdash; Faculty of Philology and the Medical Faculty  &amp;mdash; and an enrollment of 1094 students.

Among the leading professors in 1920-40 were Azerbaijani writer Abdurrahim bek Haqverdiyev, Orientalist Professor P.K. Juze, Professor A.O. Makovelski, Professor A.O. Mishel and other scholars. During that period the administration of the university invited to Baku such teachers as N.Y. Marr, V.V. Bartold, the academician of the Eastern Science Academy Fuad bek Kuprulluzade.

In 1930 the university was liquidated according to the decision made by Council of the People’s Commissar on reorganization. The High Pedagogical Institute was created. Only in 1943 the state university resumed its activity and very soon became the republic’s scientific-pedagogical center. Despite the great shortage of university teachers because most of teachers went to the Second World War, the university managed to keep its leading position. In 1945 the teachers took an active part in founding the Azerbaijan Academy of Science. Most of the republic's universities &amp;mdash; such as Azerbaijan Medical University, Azerbaijan University of Economy, Azerbaijan State Pedagogical University and others &amp;mdash; were founded on the basis of Baku State University.

The years after 1969 can be considered as the years of development in the direction of knowledge and science. Covering a wide historical period, in those years there were founded faculties on modern specialties, departments and about 30 scientific research laboratories started. As a result, there was created a strong assurance of future development. University began to develop further after Heydar Aliyev came to power. Modern specialities, departments and scientific laboratories started to operate at university. With its rich historical background, Baku State University has always been a major scientific and educational center of Azerbaijan. Famous scientists, intellectuals and politicians and Azerbaijan's outstanding politician, Heydar Aliyev graduated from Baku State University.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bsu.edu.az/en/content/about_baku_state_university|title=Baku State University, History|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Baku State University has 16 majors with 55 bachelor and 153 master's degrees.

== International relations ==
Through time, the university builds its international relations. Currently BSU has membership in various associations and institutions as Association of Universities of Eurasia, which unites most universities of the former USSR. Between 2002-2004, BSU led the Association of Universities of Black Sea States. Furthermore, the university has signed agreements on scientific and technical co-operation, student-teacher exchange programs with Moscow State University, Middle East Technical University, Nice-Sofia Antipole University, Indiana University, Kiyev National University, Vienna University and other high-ranking universities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As a result of these collaborations, the university holds joint scientific conferences, workshops as well as publishing of textbooks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''''Belgian Linguistic case (No. 2)''''' (1968) [http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=695402&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 1 EHRR 252] is a formative case on the [[right to education]] under the [[European Convention of Human Rights]], Protocol 1, art 2. It related to "certain aspects of the laws on the use of [[languages of Belgium|languages]] in [[education in Belgium]]",  was decided by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 1968.

==Facts==
The applicants submitted six applications (Applications No: 1474/62, 1677/62, 1691/62, 1769/63, 1994/63, 2126/64) between 1962 and 1964 on their own behalf and on the behalf of their  children, alleging that Belgian linguistic legislation, relating to education, infringed on their rights under the  European Convention, namely [[Article 8 ECHR|Article 8]] (family life) in conjunction with Article 14 (non-discrimination), and Article 2 of the Protocol 1 (right to education) of March 1952. 
The Acts they brought litigation against basically stated the language of education shall be [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in the Dutch-speaking region, [[French language|French]] in the French-speaking region and [[German language|German]] in the German-speaking region.

===Counsel submissions===
The applicants, whose children totalled more than 800, asserted that the law of the Dutch-speaking regions where they lived did not include adequate provisions for French-language education. They also complained that the Belgian state withheld grants from institutions in these regions that did not comply with the linguistic provisions set out in the legislation for schools and refused to homologate certificates issued by these institutions.  Further, the state did not allow the applicants’ children to attend French classes in certain places,  forcing  applicants  to  enrol  their  children  in  local  schools,  contrary  to their aspirations, or send them further afield, which entailed risks and hardships.

The Government argued that the right to education in one’s own language was not included in the Convention and the Protocol, and that the applicants did not belong to a national minority within the meaning of Article 14.

==Judgment==
The Court found by a majority of 8 to 7 that one of the Acts violated Art 14. But the Court also found unanimously that there had been no breach of Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention, and Article 2 of the protocol, with regard to the other contested legislation and points at issue. In reaching its decision the Court considered that the principle of equality of treatment enshrined in Article 14 was violated if the distinction had no objective and reasonable justification, did not pursue a legitimate aim, and was not proportionate to the aim pursued. Further to this, the Court opined that the right to education implied the right to be educated in the national language, and did not include the provision that the parent’s linguistic preferences be respected.

The operative part of the Court's judgment read as follows.

{{Cquote|2.  The Court will address itself first to Article 2 of the Protocol because the Contracting States made express provision with reference to the right to education in this Article.

3.  By the terms of the first sentence of this Article, 'no person shall be denied the right to education'.

In spite of its negative formulation, this provision uses the term 'right' and speaks of a 'right to education'. Likewise the preamble to the Protocol specifies that the object of the Protocol lies in the collective enforcement of 'rights and freedoms'. There is therefore no doubt that Article 2 does enshrine a right. It remains, however, to determine the content of this right and the scope of the obligation it places upon States.

The negative formulation indicates, as is confirmed by the preparatory work, that the Contracting Parties do not recognise such a right to education as would require them to establish at their own expense, or to subsidise, education of any particular type or at any particular level. However, it cannot be concluded from this that the State has no positive obligation to ensure respect for such a right as is protected by Article 2 of the Protocol. As a 'right' does exist, it is secured, by virtue of Article 1 of the Convention, to everyone within the jurisdiction of a Contracting State.

To determine the scope of the 'right to education', within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol, the Court must bear in mind the aim of this provision. It notes in this context that all member States of the Council of Europe possessed, at the time of the opening of the Protocol to their signature, and still do possess, a general and official educational system. There neither was, nor is now, therefore, any question of requiring each State to establish such a system, but merely of guaranteeing to persons subject to the jurisdiction of the Contracting Parties the right, in principle, to avail themselves of the means of instruction existing at a given time.

The Convention lays down no specific obligations concerning the extent of these means and the manner of their organisation or subsidisation. In particular, the first sentence of Article 2 does not specify the language in which education must be conducted in order that the right to education should be respected. It does not contain precise provisions similar to those in Articles 5(2) and 6(3)(a) and (e). However, the right to education would be meaningless if it did not imply, in favour of its beneficiaries, the right to be educated in the national language or in one of the national languages, as the case may be.

4.  The first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol consequently guarantees, in the first place, a right of access to educational institutions existing at a given time, but such access constitutes only a part of the right to education. For the 'right to education' to be effective, it is further necessary that, inter alia, the individual who is the beneficiary should have the possibility of drawing profit from the education received, that is to say, the right to obtain, in conformity with the rules in force in each State, and in one form or another, official recognition of the studies he has completed. The Court will deal with this matter in greater detail when it examines the last of the six specific questions listed in the submissions of those who appeared before it.

5.  The right to education guaranteed by the first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol by its very nature calls for regulation by the State, regulation that may vary in time and place according to needs and resources of the community and of individuals. It goes without saying that such regulation must never injure the substance of the right to education nor conflict with other rights enshrined in the Convention.

The Court considers that the general aim set for themselves by the Contracting Parties through the medium of the European Convention on Human Rights was to provide effective protection of fundamental human rights, and this, without doubt, not only because of the historical context in which the Convention concluded, but also of the social and technical developments in our age that offer States considerable possibilities for regulating the exercise of these rights. The Convention therefore implies a just balance between the protection of the general interest of the community and the respect due to fundamental human rights while attaching particular importance to the latter....

7.  The first sentence of Article 2 contains in itself no linguistic requirement. It guarantees the right of access to educational establishments existing at a given time and the right to obtain, in conformity with the rules in force in each State and, in one form or another, the official recognition of completed studies, this last right not being relevant to the point dealt with here."}}

'''''Board of Education v. Walters''''' was a 1979 [[Supreme Court of Ohio|Ohio Supreme Court]] case relating to the funding of primary and secondary [[Ohio#Education|schools in Ohio]]. The Court ruled that the method of [[Education in the United States#K-12 education#Funding for K-12 schools|funding public schools]] at the time was [[constitutionality|constitutional]] despite disparities in per-pupil education spending between different districts. Article VI of the Ohio Constitution states that the state must provide an "adequate system of public schools."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/laws/ohio-constitution;jsessionid=e5f0aa44eb459d3c80ce50fb510c?0|title=Ohio Constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling overturned a previous trial court ruling that the State's school-funding system violated the [[Constitution of Ohio]]'s requirement of providing a thorough and efficient system of public education. ''Board of Education v. Walters'' is one of the cases that played a role leading to ''[[DeRolph v. State|DeRolph v. State of Ohio]]'' in 1997, which found the model of funding for public schools in Ohio to be unconstitutional.

==Background==
The [[plaintiff]]s of this case brought suit claiming that Ohio held the responsibility to fund its public schools. The Cincinnati [[school board]] filed a [[class-action lawsuit]] on behalf of Ohio school districts that believed they were underfunded. The plaintiffs believed that the system of funding, a mixture of state and local funding, violated the constitutional requirement to provide sufficient funding to operate a school district.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=82a67e47-68f2-4d8f-923f-545b4472b0be%40sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=4202&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=edsggo&amp;AN=edsgcl.16688409|title=As perfect as can be devised': the right to education in Ohio|last=Hawl|first=M.|date=1995|journal=Case Western Reserve Law Review|access-date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Furthermore, they argued that forcing a school district to adequately fund its district violated the education provisions of the State Constitution. At the trial court level, the method of funding for public schools was deemed unconstitutional. However, on [[appellate court|appeal]], the Ohio Supreme Court reversed that decision and upheld the constitutionality of the school funding method.

==The Ruling==
The Ohio Supreme Court justices argued that despite the inequalities that existed between school districts in terms of funding and ability to raise local revenue, there was no basis to strike down the funding method. They agreed with the [[defendant]], in this case the Cincinnati Board of Education, that local control of school districts served as a rationale to defend the funding inequalities. The court stated that the local control of school districts "meant not only the freedom to devote more money to the education of one's children but also control over and participation in the decision-making process as to how those local tax dollars are to be spent."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7940736071971752054&amp;q=Miller+v.+Korns+1923&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,36&amp;as_vis=1|title=The Supreme Court of Ohio|date=13 June 1979|accessdate=10 October 2015|website=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court did not answer the questions of whether the [[Ohio General Assembly]] at the time fulfilled their constitutional requirement to provide a "thorough and efficient" system of public schools, despite the trial court's ruling stating that the Assembly did not. Furthermore, the court declined to state what constitutes a "thorough and efficient" system of public education.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; By leaving these questions unanswered, whether intentionally or not, the court allowed for the school funding model to be revisited in future court cases.

In addition, the court defended their decision by explaining that the state had taken steps to close the disparities in school funding.  The state of Ohio gave extra money to school districts that levied 20 mills of property tax up to a maximum of 30 mills.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  The court used this rationale to explain that the inequalities were not unconstitutional because the state made an effort to even out funding through that policy. Despite upholding the method of funding, the court kept the possibility of further court cases regarding education funding alive. The Court stated that the structure of funding would become unconstitutional if a school district failed to receive enough funding from all sources that it could not operate adequately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Access Quality Education: Ohio Litigation|url=http://www.schoolfunding.info/states/oh/lit_oh.php3|website=www.schoolfunding.info|accessdate=13 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150830074012/http://www.schoolfunding.info/states/oh/lit_oh.php3#|archive-date=2015-08-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made it possible for the funding of schools in Ohio to be struck down in the case ''[[DeRolph v. State]]''.

'''Comenius University in Bratislava''' ({{lang-sk|Univerzita Komenského v Bratislave}}) is the largest [[university]] in [[Slovakia]], with most of its faculties located in [[Bratislava]]. It was founded in 1919, shortly after the creation of [[Czechoslovakia]]. It is named after [[Jan Amos Comenius]], a 17th-century [[Czechs|Czech]] teacher and [[philosopher]].

In 2006, Comenius University had more than 30,000 students and 2,000 faculty members. As are most universities in Slovakia, it is funded mostly by the government. Although there have been plans to establish [[tuition]] fees for university students in Slovakia for years, another attempt failed to gain sufficient support in [[National Council of the Slovak Republic|parliament]] in May 2005.

==History==
The Comenius University was established in 1919 with assistance from the more established [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]]. It was meant to replace the former Elisabeth University which was located in Bratislava since 1912 as the latter has been forcefully disbanded in 1919 by [[Samuel Zoch]], plenipotentiary [[župan]] of Slovakia, at that time in the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has caused the majority of the university's professors (and some of the students) to take refuge in [[Budapest]], where the Elisabeth University was reestablished. It has been later moved to [[Pécs]] and renamed to [[University of Pécs]]. This persecution of former (predominantly Hungarian) pillars of education in Bratislava necessitated the recruitment of [[Czech people|Czech]] academicians. Therefore, many [[professor]]s of the newly established university, including its first rector, Prof. MUDr. [[Kristian Hynek]], were Czechs, since Slovakia at that time did not have enough educated [[Slovaks|Slovak]] speakers who could serve as faculty members. In spite of personnel, financial, and space difficulties, the university developed research and teaching programs. The Faculty of Medicine opened in 1919, and was quickly followed by the Faculties of Law and Philosophy in 1921. The Faculty of Philosophy, besides offering programs in the [[humanities]] and [[social science]], also educated much-needed teachers for Slovakia's [[high school]]s.

In 1937, a new university building for the Faculties of Law and Philosophy was opened in the centre of Bratislava. The building includes the Aula (hall) used for graduation ceremonies and other formal functions.

During [[World War II]], Slovakia became nominally a [[First Slovak Republic|republic]], but was actually under the sway of [[Nazi Germany]]. The government reduced [[academic freedom]]s at the university, and the Czech professors were forced out. The university was renamed ''Slovak University'' in 1939, though the original name was reinstated in 1954. The Faculty of Science opened in 1940 and the Roman Catholic Faculty of Theology was established in 1941. Academic freedom returned after the end of the war in 1945 but was again cancelled in 1948 as the [[communist]]s took power in [[Czechoslovakia]], enforcing the ideology of [[Marxism-Leninism]] at Czechoslovak universities. The Roman Catholic Faculty of Theology was taken under direct control of the Ministry of Education.

However, the university continued to grow, and new faculties were established (mostly by splitting the existing faculties):
*Faculty of Education in 1946,
*Faculty of Pharmacy in 1952,
*Faculty of Physical Education and Sports in 1960,
*Faculty of Medicine in Martin in 1969,
*[[Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics|Faculty of Mathematics and Physics]] in 1980.

After the "[[Velvet revolution]]" in 1989, the university created a [[democracy|democratic]] self-government, and mandatory courses on [[Marxism|Marxist ideology]] were abolished. The Roman Catholic Faculty of Theology and the Evangelical Theological Faculty joined the university.

The transformation of Slovakia into a market economy created a need for professionals in management and financial sciences. As a result, the
university established the [[Faculty of Management]] 1991 and the Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences in 2002. In 2000, the [[European credit transfer system]] was implemented to improve student mobility and facilitate more ties with other European universities.

'''The Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative''' (ECAI) is a [[digital humanities]] initiative involving numerous academic professors and institutions around the world with the stated goal of creating a networked digital [[atlas]] by creating tools and setting standards for dynamic, digital maps.

ECAI was established in 1997 by Emeritus Prof. [[Lewis Lancaster]] of the University of California, Berkeley, and has held two meetings per year most years from 1998 - 2009 (ongoing), one of which is often in conjunction with the Pacific Neighbourhood Consortium. The initiative is based at UC Berkeley.

The ECAI 'clearinghouse' of distributed digital datasets was developed from 1998 by the Archaeological Computing Laboratory at the University of Sydney, and uses the ACL's [[TimeMap]] software.

'''The Evergreen State College''' is a public [[liberal arts college]] in [[Olympia, Washington]]. Founded in 1967, Evergreen offers a non-traditional undergraduate curriculum in which students design their own paths of study. Full-time students enroll in interdisciplinary academic programs instead of classes. Programs typically offer students the opportunity to study several disciplines in a coordinated manner. Faculty write [[narrative evaluations]] of students' work in place of issuing grades.

Evergreen's main campus spans 1,000 acres of forest bordering the southernmost waters of Puget Sound, and it also has a satellite campus in nearby [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]]. The school offers a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Liberal Arts and [[Bachelor of Science]], Master of [[Environmental Studies]], [[Master in Teaching]], [[Master of Public Administration]], and Master of Public Administration in Tribal Governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Master of Public Administration in Tribal Governance |url=https://www.evergreen.edu/nativeprograms/mpa |publisher=The Evergreen State College}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, there were 3,327 students, 3,018 of whom were undergraduates, and 223 faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Evergreen Fact Page |url=https://www.evergreen.edu/institutionalresearch/factpage |website=The Evergreen State College |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evergreen was one of many alternative colleges and programs launched in the 1960s and 1970s, often described as “experiments.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenzweig |first1=Joy |title=The Innovative Colleges and Universities of the 1960s and 1970s: What Keeps the Dreams of Experimentation Alive? |journal=Annual Meeting of the Association for the Study of Higher Education (22nd, Albuquerque, NM, November 6-9, 1997). |date=November 6, 1997 |url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED415810.pdf |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the vast majority of these have either closed or adopted more mainstream approaches, Evergreen is one of the few that have remained steadfast in pursuing its original mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vallance |first1=Karla |title=Evergreen: Can a college of the '60s survive '80s? |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1983/0217/021745.html |accessdate=20 November 2018 |agency=Christian Science Monitor |date=February 17, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Booth |first1=William |title=On Calif.

In 2017, protests over claims of racial discrimination and free speech issues repeatedly shut down the school, and led to the resignation of two professors, [[Bret Weinstein]] and his wife Heather Heying.  Evergreen later paid the couple $500,000 to settle a lawsuit alleging that the college failed to protect them from race-based threats and hostility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/evergreen-professor-at-center-of-protests-resigns-college-will-pay-500000/ Spegman, A.

==History==
{{recentism|date=February 2018}}
In 1964, a report was issued by the Council of Presidents of Washington State baccalaureate institutions stating that another college was needed in the state to balance the geographical distribution of the existing state institutions.  This report spurred the 1965 Washington legislature to create the Temporary Advisory Council on Public Higher Education to study the need and possible location for a new state college.&lt;ref name="The Evergreen State College Developmental Aspects Prior to Appointment of the President"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clabaugh|first=Earl|title=Dean|url=http://archives.evergreen.edu/1971/1971-01/clabaugh_doc.pdf|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965–66, the Temporary Advisory Council on Public Higher Education (assisted by Nelson Associates of New York) concluded "at the earliest possible time a new college should be authorized", to be located at a suburban site in Thurston County within a radius of approximately {{convert|10|mi|km}} from Olympia. Evergreen's enabling legislation – HB 596 (Chapter 47, Laws of 1967) – stated that the campus should be no smaller than {{convert|600|acre|ha}}, making it then the largest campus in the state as well as the first public four-year college created in Washington in the 20th century.

On January 24, 1968, ''The Evergreen State College'' was selected from 31 choices as the name of the new institution. On November 1, 1968, [[Charles J. McCann]] assumed the first presidency of the college. McCann and the founding faculty held the first day of classes October 4, 1971 with 1128 students. McCann served from 1968 until stepping down to join the faculty June 6, 1977 when former Governor [[Daniel J. Evans]], who signed the legislation creating Evergreen, assumed the presidency. Evans left the president's office in 1983 when he was appointed to the [[United States Senate]] to fill the vacancy created by the death of [[Henry M. Jackson|Senator Henry M. Jackson]]. The largest building on campus is named in honor of Evans, the Daniel J. Evans Library Building. The entrance to the campus bears McCann's name, the Charles J. McCann plaza.

In the 1992-93 school year, students chose [[Leonard Peltier]] to give the address at commencement, which was the first with a graduating class of more than 1,000.&lt;ref name="The Evergreen State College Archives"&gt;{{cite news |title=Graduation Weekend Preview |url=http://archives.evergreen.edu/1972/1972-07/President/College%20Relations/GreenerScene/1992-93.pdf |accessdate=15 November 2018 |work=Greener Scene: The Newsletter of The Evergreen State College |publisher=Office of College Relations |date=May 14, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The selection was described as "perhaps the most unconventional commencement speaker" in a published round-up of the most controversial graduation speakers on campuses nationwide that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shea |first1=Christopher |title=Controversial Commencement Speakers |url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Controversial-Commencement/74237 |accessdate=15 November 2018 |work=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=19 May 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peltier, who was in federal prison, submitted his remarks in writing, to be read by a graduating senior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commencement Programs 1972-2014 |url=http://archives.evergreen.edu/1972/1972-04/CommencementHome.html |website=Evergreen State College Archives |publisher=The Evergreen State College |accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]] was invited to deliver the keynote address by audiotape for the graduating class at the college. The event was protested by some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Mumia Abu-Jamal to Speak at College Graduation Ceremonies | publisher=Peter Bohmer of Evergreen State College, [[Washington (state)|Washington]] | date=May 26, 1999 | url=http://academic.evergreen.edu/b/bohmerp/znetmay99.htm | accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004, the college completed the {{convert|170000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Seminar II building, and a significant remodel of the Daniel J. Evans Library was completed.

In 2015, [[George Sumner Bridges]] became the sixth president of Evergreen State College, not counting interim appointments. Bridges had previously served as president of [[Whitman College]] in Walla Walla, WA. He followed Thomas L. “Les” Purce (2000–2015), Jane L. Jervis (1992–2000), and Joseph D. Olander (1985–1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Past Presidents |url=https://www.evergreen.edu/president/past |website=The Evergreen State College |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 protests===
Every April since the 1970s until 2018, Evergreen has held a daylong event called ''Day of Absence'', inspired by the [[Douglas Turner Ward]] play of the same name, during which minority students and faculty members voluntarily stay off campus to raise awareness of the contributions of minorities and to discuss racial and campus issues.&lt;ref name="dayofabsence" /&gt;&lt;ref name="InsideHigherEd-20170530" /&gt; {{as of|2017}}, approximately 25% of Evergreen students were racial minorities.&lt;ref name=wapo /&gt; Since 1992, the ''Day of Absence'' has been followed by the ''Day of Presence'', when the campus community reunites.&lt;ref name="dayofabsence"&gt;"[http://evergreen.edu/multicultural/day-of-absence-day-of-presence Day of Absence &amp; Day of Presence]", ''First Peoples Advising Services'', Evergreen State College.

{{anchor|Bret Weinstein}}In 2017, the ''Day of Absence'' was altered after students of color voiced concerns about feeling unwelcome on campus following the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.

==Programs==

===Undergraduate===
Evergreen is unique&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pope|first1=Loren|title=Colleges That Change Lives|date=2006|publisher=Penguin|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that undergraduate students select one 16-credit program for the entire quarter rather than multiple courses. Full-time programs will encompass a quarter's worth of work in everything related to that program concentration, by up to three professors. There are no "majors": students have the freedom to choose what program to enroll in each quarter for the entire duration of their undergraduate education, and are never required to follow a specific set of programs. Evergreen is on the [[Academic quarter (year division)#United States|"quarter" system]], with programs lasting one, two, or three quarters.  Three quarter programs are generally September through June.

At the end of the program the professor writes a one-page report ("Evaluation") about the student's activity in the class rather than a letter grade, and has an end-of-program Evaluation conference with each student. The professor also determines how many credits should be awarded to the student, and students can lose credit.

In order to obtain a Bachelor of Arts, a student must complete 180 credits.

In order to obtain a Bachelor of Science, a student must complete 180 credits, 72 of which need to be in science, with 48 of those noted as upper division. This requirement can be satisfied by one year of upper-division science.

Evergreen's Evening and Weekend Studies Program makes it possible for students who cannot attend full-time, day classes to get a Bachelor of Arts degree by attending on a part-time basis through night and weekend interdisciplinary programs.

===Graduate===
Unlike the undergraduate programs, the graduate programs require that students have taken a certain rotation of courses. Evergreen graduate studies consist of the following three programs:
* Master of Environmental Studies
* Master in Teaching
* Master of Public Administration

==Rankings==
According to [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'s 2018 college rankings, Evergreen is ranked #33 in Regional Universities West, and #1 in Regional West Best Undergraduate Teaching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/masters-west-ut-rank Best Colleges – Best Undergraduate Teaching Programs], ''U.S. News &amp; World Report''&lt;/ref&gt;  US News ranked Evergreen as #33 in the nation for offering first-year experiences to freshmen, which entails building into the curriculum first-year seminars or other programs that bring small groups of students together with faculty and staff on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/first-year-experience-programs|title=Best Colleges – First-Year Experiences|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and former education editor for ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[Loren Pope]] cites Evergreen as one of two public colleges in the United States in his book ''[[Colleges That Change Lives]]''.

The Evergreen State College has an admission rate of 97%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/evergreen-state-college-8155/applying Evergreen State College – Applying], ''U.S. News &amp; World Report''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==

{{Panorama|image=Image:The_Evergreen_State_College.jpg |fullwidth=9000 |fullheight=1487 |caption=360° panorama on the campus of The Evergreen State College in [[Olympia, Washington]]. This panorama features the Daniel J. Evans Library and the clock tower set in a brick courtyard lined with trees. |height=250}}

===Daniel J. Evans Library===
The main library on The Evergreen State College campus is the Daniel J. Evans Library, named after the former governor who signed the legislation that founded Evergreen, and was also the school's second president. The library is home to some 428,000 volumes and 750,000 print and media items overall. The library hosts a number of small viewing rooms and also maintains special collections of rare books, archival material, and government documents.  The Quantitative and Symbolic Reasoning Center (QuaSR), a tutoring center for the sciences, is located on the first floor of the library. The library is located in the Information Technology wing of the Daniel J. Evans Library Building. This wing is also the home for Media Services and a large Academic Computing center.

===Environmental reserve and beach===
The Evergreen State College has {{convert|1000|acre|ha}} of land that is mostly second growth forest. The entire campus serves as a natural laboratory for scientific field research and provides inspiration for creative work. Throughout the {{convert|1000|acre|ha|adj=on}} forest there are multiple trails leading to a variety of locations throughout the reserve and to Evergreen Beach. The coastal habitat is characterized by steep bluffs, gravelly beaches with many washed-up logs, and the marine intertidal zone which extends up to {{convert|150|ft|m}} out into Puget Sound's Eld Inlet during low tides. Evergreen has approximately {{convert|3300|ft|km}} of untouched beach and{{convert|11|ha|acre}} of southern Puget Sound tidelands.&lt;ref name="evergreen1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Campus Master Plan: Volume II – Goals and Policies for Land Use|url=http://www.evergreen.edu/policies/planningdocuments/master_plan_volume2.pdf|publisher=The Evergreen State College|date=January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Students use the beach and tidelands for scientific study and as a place to get away from their studies and relax. There are multiple trails leading to the beach and a small road that leads to the only building at the beach and small boat ramp. The bluffs range from 15 to 60 feet (5 to 20 m) in height.&lt;ref name="evergreen1"/&gt;

===Organic farm===
The Evergreen Organic Farm annual crop bed space comprises {{convert|38000|sqft|ha}}, slightly less than {{convert|1|acre|ha}}. The farm also produces apples and other perennial food crops, and tends to a flock of hens. Produce is sold to the Evergreen community through CSA ([[Community-supported agriculture|Community Supported Agriculture]]) shares, or from a farm-stand on Red Square every Tuesday and Thursday from 11am to 5pm during the growing season.  Produce is sometimes sold to campus food services Aramark and the Flaming Eggplant Cafe. Excess produce is available to students in the interdisciplinary program, titled "The Practice of Sustainable Agriculture".

Proceeds from the sale of the crops are used to finance farm projects, as well as purchase seeds and equipment. Two of the [[greenhouses]], the cooler, [[compost|compost shed]], farm fencing and orchard are just a few projects made possible from farm sales. Another use for money generated on the farm is to fund student projects. Many of these projects are related to horticultural aspects of food crops.

The farm production area is divided into sections that are used to delineate cropping areas for specific types of crops. The farm practices a strict five year crop rotation. The rotating of crops creates plant diversity over time as opposed to plant diversity in space. The rotation has four general crop categories with each category occupying a given space for one growing season.

Crop rotation is just one method the farm uses to maintain diversity in the field. Other methods employed are the use of undersown ground covers and inter-cropping different types of vegetable crops. Creating diversity in the field is one of the cornerstones of sustainable agriculture. Diversity provides non-toxic, sustainable crop protection against plant diseases and insect pests.

The Evergreen Organic Farm hosts a large composting facility that composts all compostables from the campus. It also hosts a Biodiesel facility, a [[community garden]], demeters garden, and a large farmhouse that was partially built by students.

===Public service centers===
The Evergreen State College is the home of the Longhouse Education and Cultural Center. The Longhouse exists to provide service and hospitality to students, the college, and surrounding Native communities. With a design based on the Northwest Indigenous Nations' philosophy of hospitality, its primary functions are to provide a gathering place for hosting cultural ceremonies, classes, conferences, performances, art exhibits and community events. The Longhouse provides the opportunity to build a bridge of understanding between the regions' tribes and visitors of all cultures. The public service mission of the Longhouse is to promote indigenous arts and cultures through education, cultural preservation, and economic development.

It is also the administrative home for the [[Washington State Institute for Public Policy]]. The Institute's mission is to carry out practical, non-partisan research—at legislative direction—on issues of importance to Washington State. The Institute conducts research using its own policy analysts and economists, specialists from universities, and consultants. Institute staff work closely with legislators, legislative and state agency staff, and experts in the field to ensure that studies answer relevant policy questions.

Other notable public service centers on campus are:
* Washington Center for Improving the Quality of Undergraduate Education
* Center for Community-Based Learning and Action

==Athletics==
Evergreen teams, nicknamed athletically as the Geoducks, are part of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA), primarily competing in the [[Cascade Collegiate Conference]] (CCC). Men's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, crew, and track &amp; field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, crew, track &amp; field and volleyball. A [[geoduck]] is a clam native to the region.

Former men's soccer star [[Joey Gjertsen]], who led the Geoducks to the 2004 [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] National quarterfinals, has gone on to have professional success with the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] of [[Major League Soccer]].  [[Shawn Medved]] previously had success in the MLS, playing for [[D.C. United]] and the [[San Jose Clash]].  Medved scored the tying goal in the 1996 MLS Cup as D.C. went on to the championship.

Evergreen also had a strong run in men's basketball during the first decade of the 21st Century, winning the 2002 [[Cascade Collegiate Conference]] championship and reaching the NAIA national tournament in '02, '09 and '10.  Forward Mike Parker from the '02 team has become one of the top professional players in Japan and several other basketball players have gone on to professional careers overseas.

===American PEN criticism===

During the 2015 controversy regarding American PEN's decision to honor ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' with its annual Freedom of Expression Courage Award, she, alongside [[Michael Ondaatje]], [[Teju Cole]], [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]], [[Rachel Kushner]] and [[Taiye Selasi]], withdrew from the group's annual awards gala and signed a letter dissociating themselves from the award, stating that although [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|the murders]] were "sickening and tragic," they did not believe that ''Charlie Hebdo''{{'}}s work deserved an award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/04/27/read-letters-comments-pen-writers-protesting-charlie-hebdo-award/|title=Read the Letters and Comments of PEN Writers Protesting the ''Charlie Hebdo'' Award|publisher=Firstlook.org|date=2015-04-27|accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Boris Kachka |url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/04/how-and-why-6-writers-denounced-pen.html |title=How and Why 35 Writers Denounced PEN |publisher=Vulture |date= |accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was soon co-signed by more than 140 other PEN members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/04/30/145-pen-writers-thus-far-objected-charlie-hedbo-award-6/|title=204 PEN Writers (Thus Far) Have Objected to the ''Charlie Hebdo'' Award – Not Just 6|publisher=Firstlook.org|date=2015-04-30|accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francine Prose published an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' justifying her position, stating that: "the narrative of the ''Charlie Hebdo'' murders—white Europeans killed in their offices by Muslim extremists—is one that feeds neatly into the cultural prejudices that have allowed our government to make so many disastrous mistakes in the Middle East."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/28/i-admire-charlie-hebdos-courage-but-it-does-not-deserve-a-pen-award "I admire ''Charlie Hebdo''{{'}}s courage.

===''The New Yorker'' controversy===
On January 7, 2018, in a [[Facebook]] post,&lt;ref name=facebook&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/francine.prose/posts/10155716118955067 Post] by Francine Prose, Facebook. January 7, 2018. Accessed January 18, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Prose accused the author [[Sadia Shepard]] of plagiarizing [[Mavis Gallant]]'s "The Ice Wagon Going Down the Street", which had appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' on December 14, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Mavis Gallant. [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1963/12/14/the-ice-wagon-going-down-the-street "The Ice Wagon Going Down the Street"], ''The New Yorker'' December 14, 1963.

Accessed January 18, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Shepard's story reimagines the original in a new context, with added detail and altered character dynamics, Prose contended that the similarities between the two stories constituted theft, writing in her original post that the story is a "scene by scene, plot-turn by plot-turn, gesture by gesture, line-of-dialogue by line-of-dialogue copy—the only major difference being that the main characters are Pakistanis in Connecticut during the Trump era instead of Canadians in post-WWII Geneva."&lt;ref name=facebook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alison Flood.

January 16, 2018. Accessed January 18, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to ''The New Yorker'', Prose maintained her original stance, asking, "Is it really acceptable to change the names and the identities of fictional characters and then claim the story as one's own original work? Why, then, do we bother with copyrights?"&lt;ref&gt;Francine Prose. [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/22/letters-from-the-january-22-2018-issue "Finding the Fiction"], ''The New Yorker''. Accessed January 18, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to Prose's accusation, Shepard acknowledged her debt to Gallant but maintained that her use of Gallant's story of self-exile in postwar Europe to explore the immigrant experience of Pakistani Muslims in today's America was justified.&lt;ref&gt;Sadia Shepard.

'''Herman Makkink''' (21 October, 1937 – 20 October 2013) was a Dutch sculptor, graphic artist and illustrator.

==Life and work==

Makkink was born in [[Winschoten]]. After studying chemistry from 1955 to 1959 in [[Groningen]], Makkink began to walk and hitchhike hike around the world, a phase in his life he described in the book ''Around the world on foot'' and which he sold to various newspapers, mainly in Southeast Asia. He worked in Japan as an English teacher and also travelled through Australia and Central America. He began to sculpt in the United States, when he made his first assemblage of scrap metal. After a short stay in Greece, he moved to London and became technical assistant at the [[London College of Printing]]. In London, he participated in several group exhibitions.

His first solo exhibition, "Gnomes", was mounted at the Courtauld Institute of Art in 1971. Makkink worked with his brother Kees Makkink, at the [[St Katharine Docks]] complex in London, a former industrial complex that was converted by the SPACE Foundation as a studio complex. There, in 1969 he was discovered by [[Stanley Kubrick]] who used two of his works in his film ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1971): Rocking Machine and Christ Unlimited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drencrom.com/popup1.html Artist's comments], Drenchrom&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, the Italian filmmaker [[Tinto Brass]] also used Rocking Machine in his film ''[[Dropout (1970 film)|Dropout]]'', starring Vanessa Redgrave.&lt;ref&gt;Ranjit Sandhu, [http://rjbuffalo.com/tinto4b.html Dropout], The Works of Tinto Brass, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Julia in the window jan 13.JPG|thumb|left|Partner, the writer Julia Blackburn, photographed by Herman Makkink in 2013]]
Makkink's partner was the British author, [[Julia Blackburn]]. 
In 1972 Makkink settled in Amsterdam, while making regular visits to [[Deià|Deia]], Majorca. His first solo exhibition in the Wetering Gallery in Amsterdam took place in 1982, and the gallery has continued to feature his work ever since. In 1986 he was visiting professor at the [[Artez|ArtEZ Institute of the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weteringgalerie.nl/kunstenaars/makkink/cv.html Artist's CV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222060826/http://www.weteringgalerie.nl/kunstenaars/makkink/cv.html |date=2014-02-22 }} at Wetering Gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1987 to 2000 he taught part-time at the [[Gerrit Rietveld Academie]] in Amsterdam. Makkink worked alternately in Bramfield (Suffolk), Molini di Triora-Agaggio and Amsterdam. In Amsterdam Makkink shared, for many years until his death, a studio with his former pupil Adriaan Rees. Makkink was controversial in Amsterdam. One of his sculptures - a tubular shape executed in brick at the Spinozahof - was demolished in 1994 because, according to local residents, it obstructed their view.

He died in Amsterdam on October 20, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Herman Makkink - obituary|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10588299/Herman-Makkink-obituary.html|accessdate=2 November 2014|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|date=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International Association of Medical Colleges''' ('''IAOMC''') is a [[Professional association]], basically meant for peer evaluation of the [[medical education]] and maintaining uniform standards and recognition of physicians qualifications provided by individual medical schools anywhere in the world.

==Brief Notability==
* The [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] ([[ECOSOC]]) granted the IAOMC Special Consultive status as a [[NGO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://esango.un.org/irene/?page=viewProfile&amp;type=ngo&amp;nr=7617&amp;section=9 | title = NGO in Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council | publisher = UNO}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a non-stock, democratic and not for profit association.
* IAOMC is a dues paying partner member of the International Association of Medical Regulatory Authorities (IAMRA) and is listed under the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;IAMRA Members List [http://www.iamra.com/memberlist.asp], The International Association of Medical Regulatory Authorities&lt;/ref&gt;
* IAOMC is a recognised body by Union of International Association (A Research Institute and Documentation Centre, founded in 1907 and based in Brussels).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uia.be/s/or/en/1100018480 | title = UIA | publisher = UIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims and objectives==
* Its goal is to serve society and those with an interest in the evaluation of the quality of [[undergraduate]] [[medical education]] and to enhance further the [[medical education]] and [[medical practice]]. The standards and process of the IAOMC is transparent and the evaluation results are available to the public to inspire confidence in integrity of the process and findings.
* IAOMC with its regulatory panel verifies and reviews the integrity of medical colleges’ regulation.

==Administrative Bodies==

=== Advisory Council ===
"The council serves as an open international forum to provide a medium for ideas, assemble data, scholarly study, and obtain the consensus of experts. The Chair of each section serve as a member of the Board of Directors. The three sections are;

Section 1. Experienced, expert, medical administrators or educators.

Section 2. Senior government regulators/Administrators or Medical Board members.

Section 3. Distinguished Representatives of Countries, Regions, or Organizations"

===Site Visitor Panel===
After an applicant school provides complete documentation and the Evaluator reports the school is prepared for site visitors, staff will establish dates agreeable to the school and site visitors. A Site Visitor Panel Member is one who has indicated a willingness to serve as a site visitor or evaluator. The Panel provides a sufficient number of pre-qualified, impartial individuals to allow availability for selected dates. To publicly insure expertise and impartiality the site visitor’s qualifications are published. The site visitor panelist will be divided into one or more of three categories, [[basic science]], [[Clinical laboratory scientist|clinical scientist]] and administrator.

The Site visitor panel is independent; its members bi-annually elect the panel’s Chair and Secretary from among its members. The current Panel Chair will have a voting, permanent seat on the Board of Trustees. The Panel has its own by laws.

===Regulator Panel===
An independent Regulator/administrator observer panel accompany the site visitors to provide governments, and its citizen’s assurance the accreditation process has been properly done. Panel members express their individual opinion and not acting on behalf of their government - unless authorized to do so. Panel member’s qualifications and experiences are published for public assurance.

The Regulator/administrator panel is an independent; its members bi-annually elect the panel’s Chair, Secretary and treasurer from among its members. The current Panel Chair have a non-voting, permanent seat on the Board of Trustees. The Panel has its own by laws.

===Ethics Committee===
The Ethics Committee is composed of both practicing physicians and prominent scientifically trained academic teachers of medical ethics.

==World's first and only International Medical School Accreditor==
Some countries have endorsed IAOMC to accredit medical schools in their country. The executive committee of [[Medical Council of India]] (MCI) appointed one of the members as official representative of India in the IAOMC Board of Trustees. Although, the [[Federal government of the United States]] does not accredit medical schools, but it recognizes private accrediting organizations, such as the [[LCME]], for the purpose of granting [[Student loans in the United States]]. However, [[State governments of the United States]] recognize accreditors for licensure purposes.

The [[Federal government of the United States]] recognizes [[Board of Regents]] of the [[University of the State of New York]] as an accreditor. The New York State Regents has chartered IAOMC as an international medical school accrediting organization.  [[New York Constitution]] has created what is in effect a fourth branch of government, consigning education to the New York State Board of Regents.

IAOMC has not only adopted international standards, but has also established parameters of distance/computer-based learning, and has assembled an international panel of site visitors.

Although, IAOMC has not accredited any single medical school, but nowhere in the world is there such a dedication to openness and transparency in accreditation that IAOMC provides. The information that IAOMC provides on the web site's international data bank is unequivocal.

==Special consultant to the UN on medical education and practice==
IAOMC is appointed as special consultant to the [[United Nations]] on medical education and practice.

The UN held a 63rd Annual DPI/NGO Conference on Advance Global Health: Achieve the MDGs in [[Melbourne]], Australia during August 30, 2010 – September 1, 2010. The goal was to plan a roadmap for worldwide development to improve health particularly in relation to [[MDGs]]. Being a voting participant, IAOMC was represented in the Conference by [[Syed Ziaur Rahman]].

The '''Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival (JRMF)''' is an educational organization that sponsors locally organized mathematics festivals targeting K–12 students.  The events are designed to introduce students to the richness and beauty of mathematics in a collaborative and non-competitive forum.&lt;ref name=huffing/&gt;&lt;ref name=MSRI&gt;[http://www.msri.org/web/msri/education/for-k-12-educators/julia-robinson-math-festival Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival] [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://jrmf.org/about-us/ About Us] jrmf.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 1970s, [[Saint Mary's College of California]] produced a mathematics contest that was popular with secondary schools throughout the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref name=marycontest&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/College-Mathematics-Contest-Problems-Junior/dp/B01LBHKVLS Saint Mary's College Mathematics Contest Problems For Junior and Senior High School]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, Nancy Blachman attended an education forum sponsored by the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] (MSRI) and remembered how the Saint Mary's contest had inspired her as a student.&lt;ref name=SMMC&gt;[http://www.gathering4gardner.org/g4g12gift/Blachman_Nancy-Saint_Marys_Math.pdf Saint Mary’s Math Contest: High School Division] : by Nancy Blachman &amp; Nick Baxter&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the contest no longer existed.  Seeking to possibly resurrect the contest, Blachman and MSRI development director Jim Sotiros reached out to colleagues in the educational community.  One response was from local high school math teacher Joshua Zucker, who also remembered the contest and even had saved a book of problems from it.&lt;ref name=MSRI/&gt;  Sotiros suggested that Blachman and her husband David desJardins fund MSRI in order to hire Zucker to recreate a program in the style of the Saint Mary’s Math Contest.  Blachman and Zucker became co-founders and organized their first event in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathforum.org/t2t/bios/zucker.html Joshua Zucker] Math Forum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=first/&gt;  They called it a festival rather than a contest because they wanted to emphasize collaboration, creativity and fun rather than competition.&lt;ref name=MSRI/&gt; They named the festival after [[Julia Robinson]], a mathematician renowned for her contributions to [[decision problems]].  In fact, her work on [[Hilbert's 10th problem]] played a crucial role in its ultimate resolution.&lt;ref name="Julia"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Blachman felt that such a woman would provide a role model for young girls and would show that one need not be male to be a great mathematician.&lt;ref name=huffing&gt;"[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/colm-mulcahy/getting-kids-excited-abou_b_3343079.html Getting Kids Excited About Mathematics, One Festival at a Time]" By [[Colm Mulcahy]], [[Huffington Post]] Blog, December 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

When they sent out invitations to local schools, the response was so overwhelming that, in order to have enough space, they prevailed upon [[Google]] in nearby [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]] to host the first festival.&lt;ref name=first&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDL7yoz1TGQ The 2007 Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival at Google was the founding of this event for middle school and high school students.] video&lt;/ref&gt; A second festival was hosted in 2008 by [[Pixar Animation Studios]] in [[Emeryville]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jrmf.org/history-of-jrmf/ History of JRMF] By Nancy Blachman, JRMF Founder&lt;/ref&gt; Enthusiasm and interest have spurred strong growth, and since then, there have been festivals at [[Princeton University]] (and its greater community); [[Stanford University]]; and [[University of California, Berkeley]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pastfoundation.org/jrm julia robinson mathematics festival at past]&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[https://uknow.uky.edu/uk-happenings/uk-mathematics-hosts-julia-robinson-math-festival UK Mathematics Hosts Julia Robinson Math Festival] By Jenny Wells, [[University of Kentucky]], October 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algebragamification.com/jrmf/ The Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival in Hong Kong], March 24, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
Since its founding, JRMF has had the support of many people and organizations, including dedicated mentors and volunteers, the founding host MSRI, and the [[American Institute of Mathematics]] (AIM), which has been a fiscal sponsor since 2013.  JRMF has also frequently partnered with various educational, corporate, and mathematical organizations including The [[Math Circle|National Association of Math Circles]], The [[National Museum of Mathematics]], [[ThinkFun]], and [[Gathering 4 Gardner]] (G4G). Among The "Friends of JRMF" are [[David Eisenbud]], [[Peter Norvig]], [[Vi Hart]], and [[Megan Smith]].&lt;ref name=sponsors&gt;[http://jrmf.org/sponsors-and-partners/ Sponsers and Partners] JRMF.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julie Montagu''' (born February 17, 1972), [[Earl of Sandwich|Viscountess Hinchingbrooke]], is an American entrepreneur, yoga instructor, blogger, writer and reality television star.

==Early life==
Julie Fisher was born on February 17, 1972 to Thomas Fisher,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hinchingbrooke, Viscount |url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-20237 |publisher=Who's Who |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was brought up in [[Sugar Grove, Illinois]], as one of five siblings. She went on to study [[computer science]] at [[Indiana University]]. Fisher moved to London to work for an internet based company, and was setting up a film school when she met Luke Montagu. She was a single mother at the time, and had assumed he was not interested in her. Three months after they began dating, she noticed that one of his [[payment card]]s had "Viscount Hinchingbrooke" written on it. Only then, did he explain that he was a member of the aristocracy and his father was the current [[Earl of Sandwich]]. A year after they first met, they married at [[Mapperton|Mapperton House]], [[Dorset]], the country estate of the Earl of Sandwich.&lt;ref name="future"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lambert |first1=Victoria |title=Meet Julie Montagu, future Countess of Sandwich and all-American guru of healthy living |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/family/parents-would-look-turn-backs/ |accessdate=5 June 2018 |work=Daily Telegraph |date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
When Luke Montagu suffered years of side effects from being removed from prescription medication by an addiction clinic (and was later awarded £1.3 million in compensation), Julie Montagu began running [[yoga]] classes in nearby church halls in order to bring some money into the household. She also started a blog, called the "Flexi Foodie" and wrote a successful cookbook,&lt;ref name="future"/&gt; ''Superfoods: The Flexible Approach to Eating More Superfoods &amp; Superfoods Superfast''.&lt;ref name="dorset"&gt;{{cite news |title=Luke and Julie Montagu: The duo taking up the reins at Mapperton |url=http://www.dorsetmagazine.co.uk/people/luke-and-julie-montagu-the-duo-taking-up-the-reins-at-mapperton-1-5110701 |accessdate=5 June 2018 |work=Dorset |date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She founded the charity Council for Evidence-Based Psychiatry after Luke's recovery, based on their experiences.&lt;ref name="great"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Powell |first1=Rosalind |title=Great Estates: how the heir to the Earl of Sandwich runs 'the finest manor house in England' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/luxury/great-estates-heir-earl-sandwich-runs-finest-manor-house-england/ |accessdate=5 June 2018 |work=Daily Telegraph |date=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was then offered a position on the [[reality television]] series ''[[Ladies of London]]'' as her husband was recovering. She later said of the series, "We thought long and hard before accepting as it offered financial support for a while. But it was not fun to do. I was expected to behave in a way I wasn’t, like an [[It girl]] or socialite, when I'm not. They edit you... You have to go along with things or you get fired. But you know it was a job. I was acting." She celebrated when it was cancelled after three seasons.&lt;ref name="future"/&gt; In 2016, the couple took over the running of the Mapperton Estate.&lt;ref name="dorset"/&gt;

The series brought financial stability which allowed the couple to invest further in the Mapperton Estate, turning an old stable block into a wedding venue. Julie Montagu has also opened her own school of yoga within the grounds, but continues to practice yoga elsewhere such as being the headline act at the Wanderlust yoga festival in [[Victoria Park, London|Victoria Park]], London.&lt;ref name="future"/&gt; During the lead up to the [[Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle]], Julie Montagu was interviewed on a number of occasions because she is an American who married into British aristocracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Relph |first1=Daniella |title=Meghan Markle and Prince Harry: A royal shake-up |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42112647 |accessdate=5 June 2018 |work=BBC News |date=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was an on-site commentator on the wedding for the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Halleman |first1=Caroline |title=I'm an American Who Married into the British Aristocracy.

==Personal life==
She is married to Luke Montagu, Viscount Hinchingbrooke, and has four children.&lt;ref name="future"/&gt; Two of those are from her first marriage, and two with Luke.&lt;ref name="dorset"/&gt; She supported her husband through his recovery from a dependency of prescription drugs and now campaigns for greater awareness of the issue.&lt;ref name="future"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1679">'''Liceo musicale e coreutico''' (literally ''artistic lyceum'') is a type of [[secondary education in Italy|secondary school in Italy]]. It is specifically devoted to [[music]] and [[dance]] related topics.&lt;ref name="dpr"&gt;Decreto del Presidente della Repubblica 89/2010 - ''Regolamento di revisione dei licei''. Available [http://www.indire.it/lucabas/lkmw_file/licei2010///Regolamento.pdf here]. Retrieved 14 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Students can attend the ''liceo musicale e coreutico'' after successfully completing [[middle school]] (''scuola media'').

The curriculum is devised by the [[Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy)|Ministry of Education]], and emphasises the link between [[art]], [[music]], and [[dance]].&lt;ref name="dpr" /&gt; It covers a complete and widespread range of disciplines.&lt;ref name="curr"&gt;Decreto del Presidente della Repubblica 89/2010, Appendix F - ''Regolamento di revisione dei licei, Allegato F''. Available [http://www.indire.it/lucabas/lkmw_file/licei2010///Quadri%20orari1.pdf here]. Retrieved 14 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Students typically study for five years, and attend the school from the age of 14 to 19. At the end of the fifth year all students sit for the ''[[maturità|esame di Stato]]'', a final examination which gave access to every university course.

A student attending a ''liceo'' is called ''liceale'', although the more generic terms ''studente'' (male) and ''studentessa'' (female) are also in common use. Teachers are known as ''professore'' (male) or ''professoressa'' (female).

'''Canadian primary and secondary examinations''' are examinations taken by large portions of primary and secondary students in some [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories in Canada]].

Some of the following exams are administered by national or international organizations, such as the [[Council of Ministers of Education, Canada]]; the [[College Board]], or the [[International Baccalaureate]]. Nationally and internationally developed examinations are generally consistent across provinces and territories.

The majority of the exams listed are developed provincially and are unique to each respective province and their considerate adjacent territories as education in Canada. Such exams in courses can be important factors in the determination of final grades and therefore [[scholarship]]s, [[Colleges in canada|college]], and [[List of universities in Canada|university]] admissions. However, policies of [[Higher education in Canada|post-secondary institutions in Canada]] vary concerning whether the blended exam and class grade are used or the class grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/admissions/admission-requirements/accounting-finance/canada/alberta/|title=Accounting and Financial Management admission requirements for Alberta high school students|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A unique situation of primary and secondary examinations is that of Canada's territories. The territories primarily, but not entirely, elect to follow the curriculum of their most closely related adjacent provinces. This includes adopting the related provinces examination policy. The [[Yukon]] primarily follows the [[British Columbia]]n Curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.education.gov.yk.ca/curriculum.html#BCs_curriculum|title=Curriculum|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] primarily follow the [[Alberta]] curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.nu.ca/education/information/curriculum-learning-resources-0|title=Curriculum &amp; Learning Resources|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ece.gov.nt.ca/en/services/nwt-curriculum-and-school-list/nwt-curriculum|title=NWT Curriculum|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, exams in these territories are developed and adjudicated by the aforementioned adjacent province but are administered by the territorial educational ministry.

== List of examinations ==

Radelet has taught at the Universities that he worked for courses covering introductory sociology, criminology for both undergraduate and graduate levels, capital punishment for both undergraduate and graduate levels, sociology of mental health and illness for both undergraduate and graduate levels, graduate seminar on health professions, social and ethical issues in medical practice, human development, statistics, and social problems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deathpenalty.procon.org/view.source.php?sourceID=006096|title=Michael L. Radelet , PhD|last=|first=|date=|website=deathpenalty.procon.org|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of the book ''Facing the Death Penalty'' that was published in 1989, in which he describes the realities of capital punishment to those of the condemned.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/9662|title=Facing the Death Penalty: Essays on a Cruel and Unusual Punishment|last=|first=|date=1990-01-01|publisher=Temple University Press|year=|isbn=9781439907801|location=Temple University|pages=|language=English|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Career ==
Radelet has been a professor at many universities and has taught in many fields of study throughout his career. Before his work at University of Colorado Boulder, Radelet worked as a professor and the chair of the department of sociology at the University of Florida, where many of his works originated. He has taught all over the U.S. in places like the [[University of Florida]], [[Florida State]], [[University of Colorado]], [[Indiana University]], [[Eastern Michigan University]] and [[Wisconsin University]]. Radelet has lectured and taught: Mental Health Administration, Sociology of Mental Health and Illnesses, Criminology, Special Topics on Capital Punishment, and Human Development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Research and findings ==
Radelet throughout his career has studied the impact that the death penalty has on the mind, and on society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the midst of the ongoing debate on whether or not the death penalty is more deterrent than long-term imprisonment, Radelet's studies revealed findings that could alter the system. His works surveyed many, coming up with multiple conclusions regarding the issue, these results are displayed in his article 'Do Executions Lower Homicide Rates: The Views of Leading Criminologists.'&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7323&amp;context=jclc|title=Do Executions Lower Homicide Rates: The Views of Leading Criminologists|last=Lacock|first=Tracy L|date=2008|website=scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu|publisher=Tracy L. Lacock|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main statistics projected in this article states that 88% of criminologists do not believe that capital punishment is an effective deterrent to homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/study-88-criminologists-do-not-believe-death-penalty-effective-deterrent|title=Study: 88% of criminologists do not believe the death penalty is an effective deterrent {{!}} Death Penalty Information Center|website=www.deathpenaltyinfo.org|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radelet's knowledge in Psychology and Criminology helped him produce his book "Facing the Death Penalty." This book portrays what Michael experienced while working with those who are facing the death penalty. It talks a lot about the benefits and inhumanities of the death penalty and how Radelet's experience may change people’s views.

=== Racial disparities ===
Radelet has uncovered many facts and statistics relating to the problem of racial disparities in the federal death penalty. He has statistics dating back to 1991 during the first federal death penalty prosecution. In the history of those who were prosecuted and sentenced to the death penalty,  most were of color.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/capital/racial_disparities_federal_deathpen.pdf|title=The Persistent Problem of Racial Disparities in The Federal Death Penalty|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These injustices continue today, more and more whites are able to evade the death penalty better than blacks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

These injustices revealed by Radelet made the notion that racism is apparent in the justice system. These studies triggered an uprising of debate on whether the death penalty is a fair punishment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3299">The '''National Air College''' is an FAA Certified Flight Training Academy located on [[Montgomery Field]] (KMYF) in San Diego, California. It is the longest surviving civilian Flight Training School in San Diego. In fact, it is the only flight training facility on Montgomery Airfield which maintains its own aircraft on its own aircraft hangars. National Air College is also an FAA Certified Repair Station, employing its own mechanics.&lt;ref name="nationalaircollege.com"&gt;http://www.nationalaircollege.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Story ==
Nug Madariaga, owner and operator of National Air College, bought his first airplane (Model B Funk) in 1942, before serving 4 years in the U.S. Navy during WWII. After his enlistment, Nug headed to Flabob Airport in Riverside, of which his brother Flavio was part owner (Flavio's business partner was Bob Bogen - hence "Flabob Airport"). After completing his own flight training, Nug soon set up the first official flight training school at Flabob Airport.  Then, in 1957, Nug opened National Air College at Montgomery Airfield in San Diego. Operating in the same location ever since, NAC is the longest surviving civilian aviation training facility in San Diego. As well as being the owner of NAC, Nug himself holds certifications in all FAA Ratings (including... SEL, MEL, CFII, ATP, Helo), and served as an FAA Flight Examiner for 25 years.&lt;ref name="nationalaircollege.com"/&gt;

'''Gregg Madariaga'''
Following in his father's footsteps early on, Gregg Madariaga was setting records at the age of sixteen. Montgomery Field was buzzing, not just with airplanes but with the media, when Gregg became the youngest pilot in the United States to solo in 38 different aircraft types. Then, at the age of 18, Gregg became not only the youngest helicopter pilot in the U.S., but also the youngest helicopter instructor as well! With his father as his CFI, Gregg received all of his ratings from NAC, and joined his father there as a flight instructor. The father &amp; son pair flew air-taxi and military flight operations for some time to San Clemente and San Nicholas Islands. Gregg later became a Corporate Pilot and has since advanced from the Gulfstream-4 aircraft to the Global Express. And like his father before him, Gregg has now been an FAA Designated Examiner for over 25 years.&lt;ref name="nationalaircollege.com"/&gt;

== Training Offered ==
National Air College offers training opportunities for every level of pilot proficiency. From Student Pilot to Airline Transport Pilot...

National Air College provides training which produces the finest quality aviators. NAC students from around the world have become NAC instructors, and many of them have been hired by professional airlines. National Air College has been an important part of the aviation community in San Diego for so long, that some former NAC students are even retiring from airlines today.&lt;ref name="nationalaircollege.com"/&gt;

The center was opened by [[Ministry of Education and Research (Norway)|Ministry of Education and Research]] [[Kristin Clemet]] on March 30, 2005.&lt;ref name="Kristin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kristin Clemet opna nasjonalt senter for nynorsk|url=https://www.hivolda.no/ivar-aasen-instituttet/kristin-clemet-opna-nasjonalt-senter-nynorsk|website=Høgskulen i Volda|accessdate=April 8, 2018|date=March 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located at [[Volda University College]].&lt;ref name="Nynorsksenteret"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bakken|first1=Kjersti Anderdal|title=Her vil dei ha meir nynorsk i barnehagane|url=https://www.nrk.no/sognogfjordane/her-vil-dei-ha-meir-nynorsk-i-barnehagane-1.12564101|accessdate=April 8, 2018|work=NRK|date=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center is administratively linked to the college and academically to the [[Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training]]. The center carries out systematic research and development work to promote the learning of Nynorsk, primarily with regard to the course content.&lt;ref name="Kristin"/&gt;

According to a press release from the Ministry of Education and Research, the center "leads and coordinates efforts to develop content, methods, and assessment in Nynorsk parts of Norwegian language courses, offers heads of schools and schools support and guidance in work on motivation for and learning Nynorsk, establishes systematic research and development work to promote learning Nynorsk, and contributes to skill development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Utdannings- og forskningsdepartementet|title=Clemet opna nasjonalt senter for nynorsk|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/clemet_opna_nasjonalt_senter_for/id255901/|website=Regjeringen.no|accessdate=April 9, 2018|date=March 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year, the center is able to specify a number of specific tasks in a letter of commission from the Directorate of Education. The letter of commission  applies to all national resource centers, and the Nynorsk Center especially works in partnership with the [[National Center for Reading Education and Reading Research]] (''Nasjonalt senter for leseopplæring og leseforsking'') and the [[Norwegian Center for Writing Education and Research]] (''Nasjonalt senter for skriveopplæring og skriveforsking'').

A '''pub quiz''' is a [[quiz]] held in a [[pub]] or [[Bar (drinking establishment)|bar]].

Pub quizzes may attract customers to a pub who are not found there on other days. The pub quiz is a modern example of a [[pub game]]. Although different pub quizzes can cover a range of formats and topics, they have many features in common. The pub quiz was established in the UK in the 1970s by [[Burns and Porter]] and became part of [[British culture]].&lt;ref name="Pub challenge"&gt;{{cite news|title=Q: What is one of Britain’s fast-growing pastimes?

In the U.S., trivia nights are sometimes used as fundraisers for nonprofit organizations, and these are very common in the [[Greater St. Louis]] area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/local/st-louis-non-profits-turn-to-trivia-fundraisers/63-523843338 St. Louis non-profits turn to trivia fundraisers]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
The pub quiz was established in the UK in the 1970s, mainly by a company called [[ Burns and Porter]], to get people in to pubs on quieter nights. Popularity grew and grew over the next few years from just 30 teams to 10,000 playing each week in a Burns and Porter quiz. &lt;ref name="Pub challenge"/&gt; Redtooth runs an annual Great British Pub Quiz challenge, with more than 600 pubs taking part in 2012.&lt;ref name="Pub challenge"/&gt;

A 2009 study put the number of regular weekly pub quizzes in the UK at 22,445,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dpquiz.co.uk/special-features/399-pub-quiz-statistics.html |title=Pub quiz Statistics |publisher=dpquiz.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one website has counted approximately 2,000 regular weekly quizzes in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triviareviews.com |title=TriviaReviews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 May 2017 the first ever online pub quiz took place, run by Primordial Radio in the United Kingdom. It used existing technologies of a [[YouTube]] live stream and the answer sheet by survey monkey.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

== Format ==
Pub quizzes (also known as live trivia, or table quizzes) are often weekly events and will have an advertised start time, most often in the evening.

While specific formats vary, most pub quizzes depend on answers being written in response to questions which may themselves be written or announced by a quizmaster.

One format for quizzing is called "[[infinite bounce]]". This format is generally used when the number of teams in the quiz is large – usually around 8–10. Every question is addressed to the team succeeding the team that answered the previous question. If no team answers the question, the next question is addressed to the team succeeding the team to whom the previous question was addressed.

Generally someone (either one of the bar staff or the person running the quiz) will come around with pens and quiz papers, which may contain questions or may just be blank sheets for writing the answers on.  A mixture of both is common, in which case often only the blank sheet is to be handed in.  Traditionally a member of the team hands the answers in for adjudication to the quiz master or to the next team along for marking when the answers are called.

=== Teams ===
It is up to the quizzers to form teams, which are generally based on tables, though if one table has a large group around it they may decide to split up. Some pubs insist on a maximum team size (usually between six and ten).  The team members decide on a team name, often a supposedly humorous phrase or pun, which must be written on all papers handed in.

People often have to pay to participate – ranging from around 50p to £5 per person. This is often pooled to provide prize money. Many pub quizzes require no payment at all, as the event is simply a way to get paying customers into the venue, typically on less busy nights of the week.

=== Questions ===
The person asking the questions is known as the quizmaster. Quizmasters also mark and score answers submitted by teams, although formats exist where teams will mark each other's answer sheets.

The questions may be set by the bar staff or landlord, taken from a quiz book, bought from a specialist trivia company, or be set by volunteers from amongst the contestants. In the latter case, the quiz setter may be remunerated with drinks or a small amount of money.

Often questions may be drawn from the realm of 'everybody knows' trivia, therefore leading to controversies when the answers are false or unverifiable. In addition, as the quizzes are not formal affairs, slight errors in wording may lead to confusion and have led to a 2005 court case&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Winterman |first=Denise |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4168275.stm |title=Not just a trivia matter |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-01-13 |accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK.

=== Rounds ===
There may be between one and more than half a dozen rounds of questions, totalling anything from 10 to upwards of 80 questions. Rounds may include the following kinds (most common first):

* Factual rounds – these are usually spoken, either over a [[public address]] system or just called out.  Common topics include:
** General knowledge – covering the topics listed below (if they are not in a separate round) and also topics such as history, [[geography]] and [[science]] and [[nature]]. There may well be more than one of these rounds.
** [[Sport]] – comprising the statistics and minutiae of popular, well-known sports and general facts about others.
** [[Entertainment]] – [[film|movies]], [[television|TV]] shows and music (see also below).
** True or False – questions to which the answer is True or False.
* Picture round – these use [[photocopy|photocopied]] or computer-printed hand-outs and consist of pictures to be identified, such as photos of famous people (possibly snapped out of context, or else partially obscured) or logos of companies (without tell-tale lettering), famous places or objects pictured from a strange angle.
* Who Am I? – A series of clues to the identity of a famous person (or thing). Clues are given in order of descending difficulty. The earlier a team can identify the correct answer, the more points they are awarded.
* [[Music]] round – these consist of excerpts (often only the [[introduction (music)|intro]] or other non-vocal segment) of songs played over the PA system. Usually the teams must identify the song and also the singer or band (sometimes the year the song was released is also required). Variations include the inclusion of film [[soundtrack]]s and TV theme tunes (requiring the title), and/or [[classical music]] (also requiring the composer). Some venues cannot play a music round because they do not have the proper licensing from performers rights organizations such as Broadcast Music Inc. (BMI), the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), Society of European Stage Authors and Composers (SESAC) and Global Music Rights (GMR)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.restaurant.org/Manage-My-Restaurant/Operations/Regulatory-back-office/11-questions-about-music-licensing&lt;/ref&gt;.  
* Audio round - similar to music rounds, but sound clips are played from movies, television shows, [[YouTube]] videos, etc. 
* [[Puzzle]] rounds – generally on a hand-out sheet. These may consist of [[crossword puzzle]]s, [[anagram]]s, [[Ditloid]]s, [[Rebus|Dingbats]] and basic [[mathematics]] problems.
* Novelty rounds – themed round a specific word or name (e.g. all the questions relate to a famous Norman); 'connections', where the last answer in the round provides a link to all the previous answers; true or false; and various others to break up the general stream of questions.

=== Bonus rounds ===
In some quizzes teams are able to select one or two rounds as "jokers", in which their points will be doubled (or otherwise multiplied). Teams  usually select their joker rounds before the start of the quiz, although some rounds may be excluded. Teams who consider themselves to be particularly strong on certain subjects can improve their chances with a good joker round, but risk wasting the joker if the questions are unexpectedly difficult. The idea of using a joker in a game may come from the BBC television programme ''[[It's a Knockout]]''.

Some quizzes include a bonus question, in which a single answer is required with one or more clues given each round making the answer progressively easier to solve. In some variants, the first team to hand in the correct answer wins either a spot prize or additional points to their total score. In others, the questions continue until all teams have the correct answer with each team been given progressively fewer  additional points the longer it takes them to submit the correct answer.

=== Jackpots ===
Some quizzes add a small, separate round of questions to the end of a regular quiz, with the chance to win a jackpot. Each week an amount of money is added to the jackpot, and if no team answers the questions correctly, the money rolls over to the next quiz. The maximum amount of the jackpot may be limited by local gaming regulations.

Cash jackpots may be won by a variety of methods including one-off questions and dance-offs.

=== Marking ===

In some cases, the papers are marked  by the bar staff.  Alternatively, teams may have to mark their own answers and the handed-in papers are consulted only to check that prize claimants have not cheated by altering their answers. Another method is to have teams swap papers before marking, though this can be divisive.

One or two points are scored for each correct answer; some quizzes allow half marks for "nearly right" answers (such as a celebrity's surname when their full name was required). In some quizzes, certain questions score higher marks, particularly if they are unusually difficult.

=== Cheating ===

With the mass use of [[mobile phone]]s and mobile internet access, cheating has become a problem for some pub quizzes, with covert calls and texts made in the toilets, recent newspapers and magazines brought along especially for the event, [[List_of_sports_idioms#R|ringers]] and so on. Though a maximum number of members set for teams may help to prevent large numbers of people collaborating, groups posing as several distinct teams are quite common. Some quizzes now ban the use of mobiles and nullify the score of any team found to be cheating. Though more prevalent where large sums of money are at stake, cheating can be observed even for relatively low stakes.

Some quizzes also now ban re-entry to the pub after the quiz has started, in order to prevent team members from using public internet stations, public telephones and mobile devices out of sight of the quizmaster. Generally, though, a pub runs its quiz alongside its normal operation, making such a measure impractical.

=== Prizes ===

Prizes are awarded to the highest scoring team, and often to runners-up. Prizes are usually one of the following:

* alcoholic drinks: a case of [[beer]] or some money on a bar tab to spend at that pub are common.
* cash: if money was charged for entry into the quiz, this is often pooled to form prize money. This may all go to the winning team. Alternatively, there may be a separate short set of questions or even a single 'jackpot' question to win the cash; if no team gets the right answer, the money is typically rolled over, making a larger prize the next week.
* vouchers: such as cinema discount-coupons, food discounts, or even drinks vouchers for use at the bar holding the quiz.
* drink-related promotional items from a [[brewery]], such as [[t-shirt]]s and [[pint glass|beer glass]]es advertising their products.
* miscellaneous or novelty prizes, such as chocolate or cheap toys. The winning team may get first choice to pick a prize from a range on offer.

== Technology ==
In a digital pub quiz wireless handsets replace the more usual pen and paper. A computer receives and records the answers from each team's handset and the results are exported to a spreadsheet at the end of the quiz. A time limit can be set for each question (e.g. 60 seconds) and it is possible to determine which team answers in the fastest time for spot prizes and tiebreaks.

== Commercial projects ==
As the pub quiz concept spread to the US in the 1990s, several companies formed to provide services to bars and restaurants organizing quizzes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stumptrivia.com/stump-trivia-news.html |title=Stump!

== Leagues and competitions ==

A [[quiz league]] is an organisation that runs quizzes, normally in pubs, though such competitions are distinct from the standard pub quiz as they will normally involve two teams and often include a number of individual questions. No prizes are normally awarded at such a league match, but prizes and kudos may go to the quiz team winning a league or a [[Wiktionary:Knockout|knockout]] competition. The National Trivia Association runs a nationwide contest involving various pub trivia games played around the US.

Teams from throughout a region, county, state or country meet annually for more prestigious competitions, with greater prizes. Representative teams may either be the best team from each pub, or a team selected from the best individuals.

Believe it or Not Quiz Events in New Zealand have held an annual Champion of Champions quiz in [[Auckland]] since 1999. Initially open to teams from pubs within the greater Auckland region, it is now open to teams from throughout New Zealand. In practice, travel costs prevent most teams from the lower [[North Island]] and the [[South Island]] participating, although [[Christchurch]], [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] and [[Wellington]] have all provided teams.

The Australasian Pub Quiz Championships takes place annually since 2018. Open to teams from pubs and clubs from across Australia and New Zealand, the 2018 Championships is simultaneously run in Sydney, Canberra and Wellington in late April.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

In the United States National Trivia Association presents "The Riddle", a finals event open to eligible teams who play the official NTA "Quizzo!" live trivia game. Approximately a thousand players attended the 2008 event in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

== World record ==
The largest pub quiz, according to the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]]'', was the "Quiz for Life", held at the Flanders Expo Halls in [[Ghent]], Belgium, on 11 December 2010 with 2,280 participants.

== In popular culture ==
*Pub quizzes have appeared in the [[British sitcoms]] ''[[Minder (TV series)]]'', ''[[Bottom (TV series)| Bottom]]'', ''[[Gavin &amp; Stacey]]'', ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' and ''[[Early Doors]]'', amongst others. 
*A January 2013 episode of ''[[Anger Management (TV series)|Anger Management]]'' features [[Charlie Sheen]]'s character involved in a game of 'bar trivia,' by Brainstormer. 
*The New Zealand television drama ''[[Nothing Trivial]]'' centres around five characters who meet regularly at a pub quiz.
*The [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] game show ''Quiz Night'' with [[Stuart Hall (presenter)|Stuart Hall]] was based on this concept.  The set on which the show took place had a bar theme to it; contestants and the host even drank beer while doing the show.
*The Irish television drama ''[[Trivia]]'' from 2011-2012 focuses on the captain of a pub quiz team.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

'''Reverse discrimination''' is [[discrimination]] against members of a dominant or majority group, in favor of members of a minority or historically disadvantaged group. Groups may be defined in terms of [[disability]], [[ethnicity]], [[family|family status]], [[gender identity]], [[nationality]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[religion]], [[sex]], and [[sexual orientation]], or other factors. This discrimination may seek to redress [[social inequalities]] under which minority groups have had less access to privileges enjoyed by the majority group. In such cases it is intended to remove discrimination that minority groups may already face. The label reverse discrimination may also be used to highlight the discrimination inherent in [[affirmative action]] programs. Reverse discrimination can be defined as the unequal treatment of members of the majority groups resulting from preferential policies, as in college admissions or employment, intended to remedy earlier discrimination against minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1696883576127835788&amp;q=Abigail+Fisher&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,7|title=Google Scholar|work=google.com|accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reverse Discrimination|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reverse+discrimination |website=dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=January 2018}}

Conceptualizing affirmative action efforts as reverse discrimination began to become popular in the early- to mid-1970s, a time period that focused on underrepresentation and action policies intended to remedy the effects of past discrimination in both government and the business world.&lt;ref name="Embrick"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Embrick |first1=David G. |editor1-last=Schaefer |editor1-first=Richard T. |title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity, and Society, Volume 1 |date=2008 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=978-1-41-292694-2 |pages=12–19 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMUola6pDnkC&amp;pg=PT64&amp;dq=%22reverse+discrimination%22 |chapter=Affirmative Action in Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law in some countries, such as the UK, draws a distinction between "equality of provision" and "equality of outcome", based on the idea that identical treatment may sometimes act to preserve inequality rather than eliminate it. Opponents of this distinction may label it as an example of reverse discrimination.

== In the workplace ==
When members of a particular group have been barred from a particular employment, it is said that this group has received less than its fair share of employment, in question, and deserves to receive more by way of compensation. Thus, this group is being compensated for past lack of employment or opportunity. Therefore, a group already existing in the workplace will be discriminated against, even if they’ve never been denied employment previously. An example of this would be an organization's efforts to hire more women in order to meet federal guidelines. However in thus doing, the organization may deny opportunities of equal measures to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schultz|title=psychology and work today|isbn=978-0-205-68358-1|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the point of reverse discrimination is to compensate a wronged group, it will hardly matter if those who are preferentially hired were not among the original victims of discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cher|first=George|title=Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs, Vol 4, No.2 Winter: Justifying Reverse Discrimination in Employment|year=1975|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|pages=159–170|jstor=2265161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the current beneficiaries of reverse discrimination are not often the same persons as those who were harmed by the original discrimination, and those who now bear the burden of reverse discrimination are seldom the same persons as those who practiced the original discrimination. Because of this, reverse discrimination is argued{{by whom|date=June 2017}} to be both irrelevant to the aim of compensating for past injustices and unfair to those whose superior qualifications are bypassed.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

It is often argued by majority groups that they are being discriminated for hiring and advancement because of affirmative action policies. However, critics of this argument often cite the "symbolic" significance of a job has to be taken into consideration as well as qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baer|first=Judith|title=Reverse Discrimination: The Dangers of Hardened Categories|journal=Law &amp; Policy Quarterly|date=January 1982|volume=4|issue=1|pages=71–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many feel that basing a decision to discriminate against a group of people should not be based on symbolism but on objective, verifiable fact. [[Thomas Sowell]] said that the meaning of "qualified" has been stretched to mean "qualified to be trained", and the "available" supply includes women who no longer work (usually because of their husbands' prosperity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|title=Affirmative Action Reconsidered|date=August 1970|page=59|url=http://www.nationalaffairs.com/doclib/20080527_197604202affirmativeactionreconsideredthomassowell.pdf}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Countries ==
=== European Union ===
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}

In [[European Union law]], reverse discrimination occurs where a Member State's national law provides for worse treatment of its own citizens or domestic products than other EU citizens/goods under EU law. This can happen because of the legal principle of [[subsidiarity]] that EU law is not applicable in situations purely internal to one Member State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=954242|title=Purely Internal Situations, Reverse Discrimination, Guimont, Dzodzi and Article 234|work=ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===

In India, among the limited positions for higher education in Government institutions, 50 percent seats are reserved for members of economically disadvantaged castes and classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/India-s-Education-Minister/47891|title=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=July 16, 2009|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reserved category candidates can select a position from the Open 50 percent if he or she has good merit. This results in further reverse discrimination of Open/General/Non Reserved candidates. Further, since there are no economic criteria in classifying Reservation, poorer sections of reserved class often remain poor whereas the affluent section reap benefits for successive generations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Also, the poorer sections of Open/General Category become devoid of access to higher education for even slightly low merit on competitive exams. The difference in merit on entrance exams is often very wide between the reserved and unreserved classes. In [[India]], the term is often used by citizens protesting against [[Reservation in India|reservation and quotas]].&lt;ref&gt;Devanesan Nesiah. ''Discrimination With Reason?

UK law draws a distinction between Equality of Provision and Equality of Outcome, particularly in respect to disability rights. The [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] and the [[Equality Act 2010]] make it clear that treating two people identically may not be sufficient to guarantee that they have been treated equally in law if the task, physical environment or service does not offer them equality of outcome. The law provides for disabled people to request the provision of 'reasonable adjustments' to ensure that they are able to access employment, services and the built environment with the same potential as non-disabled people.
In November 2007, David Rosin, a former vice-president of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] wrote in the magazine ''Hospital Doctor'': “It is time that someone spoke up concerning the reverse discrimination with respect to merit awards” and saying that "female and ethnic minority consultants are being given preferential treatment to meet artificial quotas".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article2890947.ece|title='Doctor's Revolt at Anti-White Bias' |publisher=The Times|date=2007-11-18|accessdate=2010-06-30 | location=London | first=Sarah-Kate | last=Templeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

{{See also|Reverse racism#United States}}

[[Affirmative action in the United States]] has been a subject of controversy and litigation. Supporters advocate for it as a way to end and correct the effects of discrimination. Opponents say it is itself a form of discrimination.

The number of reverse discrimination cases filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission doubled in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=W.D|title=Reverse Discrimination claims: Growing like kudzu|journal=Maryland Bar Journal|year=2004|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continue to reflect a growing percentage of all discrimination cases.&lt;ref name="Pincus 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pincus |first=Fred L. |title=Reverse discrimination: Dismantling the myth |date=2003 |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers |location=Boulder, Colorado |isbn=978-1-58-826203-5}}{{page needed |date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by S. K. Camara &amp; M. P. Orbe collected narratives of individuals describing situations where they were discriminated against based on their majority-group status (cases of reverse discrimination).&lt;ref name="Sakile 111–134"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sakile K. Camara|first=Mark P. Orbe|title=Understanding Interpersonal Manifestations of "Reverse Discrimination" Through Phenomenological Inquiry|journal=[[Journal of Intercultural Communication Research]]|volume=40|issue=2|date=9 June 2011|pages=111–134|doi=10.1080/17475759.2011.581032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many White respondents described discrimination based on their race, a smaller portion reported gender discrimination. A small number of heterosexuals reported experiencing discrimination based on their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Sakile 111–134"/&gt;

==== Colleges ====

In 1996, [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] had to defer the use of racial preferences in their college admissions after the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] barred the school from considering race in admitting students. The ruling determined that diversity in education could not justify making race-based distinctions. [[Hopwood v. Texas]] was a lawsuit brought by four white applications to the Texas Law School, who were denied admission even though their [[grade point average]]s were greater than minority applications that were accepted. The four white students also had a greater Law School Admission Test scores&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robert, Menache|first=Brian H Kleiner|title=New Developments in Reverse Discrimination|journal=Equal Opportunities International|year=1999|volume=18|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision predicated a movement of banning affirmative action, seen in California in 1997, Washington in 1998, and Florida in 1999.

However, in 2003, in [[Grutter v. Bollinger]], the Supreme Court allowed the University of Michigan Law School to continue to consider race among other relevant diversity factors. The decision was the first and only legally challenged affirmative action policy to survive the courts. However, this ruling has rendered confusion among universities, and lower courts alike, regarding the status of affirmative action across the nation.

In 2012, [[Fisher v. University of Texas (2013)|Fisher v. University of Texas]] reached the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6161900559426345780&amp;q=Abigail+Fisher&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,7&amp;as_ylo=2012|title=Google Scholar|work=google.com|accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The University of Texas allegedly used race as a factor in denying Abigail Fisher's application, denying her a fair review. The lower courts upheld the program, but the Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the lower courts and sent the case back to the Fifth Circuit to review correctly.
Colleges first started considering race in acceptance to correct discrimination, but in turn conflicted with the equal opportunity clause.

According to a report prepared in 1995 for the Labor Department of the United States by Alfred W. Blumrosen, affirmative action policies have caused  few claims of reverse discrimination by whites. The report found fewer than 100 reverse-discrimination cases among more than 3,000 discrimination opinions by Federal district and appeals courts from 1990 to 1994. The report indicated that a high proportion of the claims lacked merit. In Blumrosen's report, national surveys revealed only a few whites had experienced reverse discrimination, and only 5 to 12 percent of whites believed that they had been denied a job or promotion because of it. Blumrosen also indicated that the reports filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission offer additional evidence that reverse discrimination is rare: 2% of cases were of white men charging, sexual, racial or national origin discrimination and 1.8% were of white women charging racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blumrosen|first=Alfred|title=Draft Report on Reverse Discrimination Commissioned by Labor Department|year=1995|publisher=Daily Labor Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newer reports by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have found that less than 10% of race-related complaints were filed by whites, only 18% of gender-related complaints and only 4% of the court cases were filed by men. Analysis of other evidence shows that when national samples of whites are asked if they personally have experienced the loss of job, promotion, or college admission because of their race, 2%-13% say yes.&lt;ref name="Pincus 2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pincus |first=Fred L. |chapter=Reverse discrimination |date=2008 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc |location=Thousands Oaks, CA |isbn=978-1-41-292694-2 |editor=Schaefer, Richard T. |title=Encyclopedia of race, ethnicity, and society, Volume 1 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMUola6pDnkC&amp;q=%22reverse%20discrimination%22 |pages=1159–1161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rosalyn Koo''' (born 1929) served as Executive Vice President of MBT Associates, an architectural firm listed in the 1980s as one of the 500 fastest-growing private companies in America, for 30 years. After her retirement, Koo turned to philanthropy and social activism. She has served in non-profits which assist senior citizens, such as Self-Help for the Elderly, in California, and those which assist girls trying to attain an education in China, through such organizations as [[The 1990 Institute]] and the [[All-China Women's Federation]]. Koo has been the recipient of numerous honors and was inducted into the Women's Hall of Fame in 2007.

==Biography==

In 1958,&lt;ref name=schooling/&gt; Koo joined the architectural firm MBT Associates in the San Francisco Bay area, which had been founded in 1954.&lt;ref name="Perkins+Will Acquires MBT"&gt;{{cite web|title=Perkins+Will Acquires MBT Architecture|url=http://california.construction.com/news/openings/archive/0601.asp|publisher=California Construction|accessdate=8 October 2015|location=San Francisco, California|date=January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as Chief Financial Officer and was the only principal of the firm who was not an architect. The firm specialized in building commercial and university research and laboratory projects. In 1983, the firm was listed as one of the 500 fastest growing firms in the US by ''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]'' Magazine in spite of an overall industry downward trend of nearly 33% according to the [[American Institute of Architects]].&lt;ref name=Inc.&gt;{{cite news|last1=Delano|first1=Sara|title=But Will They Still Love Your Tomorrow?|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/19840101/2630.html|accessdate=7 October 2015|publisher=Inc.

In 1978, Koo returned to China for the first time and made contact with a former principal at her alma mater, then known as Shanghai Public High School No. 3. Koo committed that overseas investors would be found if the principal could convince the government to return the school to an all-girls facility. By 1984, the school had been restored to a girls school and an overseas alumni association was providing funding for new science laboratories.{{sfn|Wheeler|2012|p=54}} She soon joined her efforts with financing programs offered by [[The 1990 Institute]] and pledged to help 1,000 girls finish primary school.{{sfn|Wheeler|2012|p=103}} In 2000, Koo toured western China visiting the provinces of Gansu, [[Shanxi]] and Shaanxi. Upon her return, she and Institute partners began a Dragon Fund to help educate girls in western China. The initial three projects were a Women’s and Children’s Training Center in [[Gansu]], a greenhouse in Zhang Xian, and the "Spring Bud" scholarship program to provide funds for elementary school of girls in [[Shaanxi]] Province. Koo returned each year to measure the girls' progress and soon extended the scholarship funds to secondary schooling.{{sfn|Wheeler|2012|p=67}} In 2008, after the [[2008 Sichuan Province earthquake|earthquake in Sichuan Province]], Koo extended her commitment to including girls in Sichuan Province as well. Since their school buildings had been destroyed, Koo partnered with Jennifer Devlin of [[EHDD]] in San Francisco, to build a seismically safe school to replace three which had been damaged by the quake. Working with local partners they built the school and provided input for new Chinese construction and seismic codes to ensure safety.&lt;ref name=schools/&gt; As of 2012, with Koo's annual visit, she had assisted over 1000 girls in the Shaanxi province and 168 of them had gone on to university studies.&lt;ref name="still visiting China"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wenjun|first1=Fan|title=ACWF Leaders Meet with 1990 Institute Founder Rosalyn Koo|url=http://www.womenofchina.cn/womenofchina/html1/news/leaders/14/6032-1.htm|accessdate=8 October 2015|publisher=Women of China|date=23 October 2012|location=Beijing, China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, she joined the board of a San Francisco-based program called "Self Help for the Elderly" and assisted the organization with planning and financing strategies&lt;ref name="Self-Help for elderly"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tribute to Legends|url=http://www.selfhelpelderly.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/40-tribute.pdf|publisher=Self Help for the Elderly|accessdate=7 October 2015|location=San Francisco CA|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; to expand their services. Primarily, the organization serves seniors of Asian heritage and provides language courses, meals, and services to help their clients maintain their independence and well-being.&lt;ref name=Well-being&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weigel|first1=Samantha|title=San Mateo's Self-Help for the Elderly may need new home|url=http://www.smdailyjournal.com/articles/lnews/2015-02-23/san-mateos-self-help-for-the-elderly-may-need-new-home/1776425138847.html|accessdate=7 October 2015|publisher=Daily Journal|date=23 February 2015|location=San Mateo CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, Koo was inducted into the Women's Hall of Fame for her contributions to sustainable living.&lt;ref name="Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite news|title=14 to join Women's Hall of Fame|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/sanmateocountytimes/localnews/ci_5287887|accessdate=8 October 2015|publisher=Inside Bay Area|date=23 February 2007|location=San Mateo CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015 the organization had 12 activity centers and Koo was the chair of the organization. She was advocating for the City of San Mateo to develop a center for the 1000 senior citizens who would be affected by closure of their current facility.&lt;ref name=Well-being/&gt;

}}'''Sanjaya Joseph Malakar''' (born September 10, 1989) is an American singer, who was a finalist on the [[American Idol (season 6)|sixth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]''. He gained national attention on the series, controversially advancing to 7th place with public votes, despite being poorly received by the show's judges, particularly [[Simon Cowell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeenews.com/Entertainment/Movies-Theatre/2007-04-16/366008news.html Sanjaya became one of the biggest obsession of Americans.]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Idol'', Malakar made many television guest appearances and has been commonly parodied in popular culture. He placed 5th in [[I'm a Celebrity... Get Me out of Here! (US season 2)|season two]] of the reality television show ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (U.S. TV series)|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]''. He recently won the Remington's Got Talent in Whitefish, MT.

== Early life ==
Malakar was born in [[Capitol Hill (Seattle)|Capitol Hill]], in downtown [[Seattle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dancing to the Music in My Head: Memoirs of the People's Idol |author1=Sanjaya Malakar |author2=Alan Goldsher |publisher=Simon and Schuster |date=2009 |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Jillian (Recchi) Blyth and Vasudeva Malakar.

When the divorce was filed, the family had almost no money coming in. His mother and the children were living in a Seattle apartment, and her only income was from welfare{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. His mother remarried, but his stepfather died soon afterwards.&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starmagazine.com/news/11746|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502112120/http://www.starmagazine.com/celebrity_news_gossip/entertainment/11746|archivedate=2007-05-02|title=Sanjaya's Secret Heartache|accessdate=2007-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Malakar spent the majority of his formative years in the Seattle area, he has also lived in both California&lt;ref name="aboutcom" /&gt; and [[Kauai, Hawaii|Kauai]], Hawaii,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2007/Mar/15/br/br2941085376.html |title=Sanjaya surprises some after surviving 'Idol' cut |accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he performed with the Hawaii Children's Theater group. While in Seattle, he spent three years with the [[Total Experience Gospel Choir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edwards |first=Haley |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003645910_sanjaya01.html |title="Idol" contestant Sanjaya once distracted teachers; now it's a nation |publisher=Seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=April 1, 2007 |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malakar attended Martha Lake Elementary School in [[Lynnwood, Washington]] for elementary school, and the [[Seattle Waldorf School]] and Northshore Junior High School for middle school in [[Bothell, Washington]]. He attended [[Shorecrest High School]] in [[Shoreline, Washington]] during freshman year, and [[Todd Beamer High School]] in [[Federal Way, Washington]] during sophomore year. After his sophomore year, Malakar passed the [[General Educational Development]] test, in order to leave high school early and focus on a music career and on his participation in ''American Idol''.&lt;ref name="aboutcom"/&gt;

== ''American Idol'' ==
[[File:Malakar, Sanjaya (2007).jpg|right|thumb|After making the top 10, Malakar performed on the [[American Idols LIVE! Tour 2007|American Idol Tour]] with fellow ''Idol'' alums, including [[Melinda Doolittle]].]]
On September 19, 2006, Malakar, a shy teen,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanidol.com/archive/contestants/season6/sanjaya_malakar/ Sanjaya Malakar], ''[[American Idol]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; entered the open audition for ''[[American Idol]]'' at the Seattle Center in [[Seattle]], with his sister Shyamali. Simon Cowell commented that Sanjaya had a better voice than his sister. Both were advanced to the Hollywood round by the judges.  Malakar cited [[Stevie Wonder]] as his idol, and sang one of Wonder's signature songs, "[[Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours]]" at his Seattle audition.&lt;ref name="aboutcom"/&gt;

For his next performance, in Hollywood, Malakar sang "[[Some Kind of Wonderful (Soul Brothers Six song)|Some Kind of Wonderful]]". He was shown tearfully embracing his sister when she was cut, though he progressed to the Top 40.  Next, Malakar sang "[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]]". The judges were largely critical of his performance, though [[Simon Cowell]] admitted that Malakar is popular with the voters while [[Randy Jackson]] and [[Paula Abdul]] gave a more positive appraisal of his "[[You Really Got Me]]" performance in the Top 11.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}  A 13-year-old girl named [[Ashley Ferl]] was highlighted repeatedly during Malakar's performance in the Top 11 episode, crying tears of joy, although Ferl also cried for [[Melinda Doolittle]], [[Jordin Sparks]], and many other contestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/17736726/ |title=Dreams do come true for 'Idol' fan |accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2007, Malakar sang [[No Doubt]]'s "[[Bathwater (song)|Bathwater]]" wearing a [[fauxhawk]] made from multiple ponytails. The style was called the "ponyhawk" by host [[Ryan Seacrest]].&lt;ref name="ryansea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollyscoop.com/american-idol/ryan-seacrest-gets-everyone-laughing.html |title=Ryan Seacrest Gets Everyone Laughing |publisher=Hollyscoop.com |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While singing, Malakar hesitated with some of the words to the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodognation.com/celebrity-gossip/reality-tv-check-po-hawk-nation-and-found-idols.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701024753/http://www.bodognation.com/celebrity-gossip/reality-tv-check-po-hawk-nation-and-found-idols.html |archivedate=2007-07-01 |title=REALITY TV CHECK: Po-Hawk Nation and Found Idols |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=July 1, 2007 |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Cowell remarked, "Sanjaya, I don't think it matters anymore what we say ... I think you are in your own universe and if people like you, good luck." The following night, host Seacrest walked out on stage wearing a wig with the same hairstyle, parodying Malakar.&lt;ref name="ryansea"/&gt;

On April 3, Malakar sang "[[Cheek to Cheek]]", wearing a white suit, donning a slick hairstyle (with a recent cut), and dancing with judge Paula Abdul. Abdul commented, "I get it.  I get why people love you. You are charming."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180728221526/http://news.aol.com/newsbloggers/2007/04/04/sanjaya-dare-to-be-different-and-blake-lewis-mimbo Sanjaya: Dare to be Different]&lt;/ref&gt;  On the following April 4 results show, it was revealed that Malakar had finished in the "middle three," among nine contestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themoneytimes.com/articles/20070330/american_idol_brings_out_a_string_of_surprises_sligh_exits_malakar_safe-id-103214.html |title='American Idol' brings out a string of surprises |publisher=Themoneytimes.com |date=March 30, 2007 |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930014502/http://www.themoneytimes.com/articles/20070330/american_idol_brings_out_a_string_of_surprises_sligh_exits_malakar_safe-id-103214.html |archivedate=September 30, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malakar's performance of "[[Bésame Mucho]]" in the Top 8 on April 10 was his first unanimously well-received performance by the judges in the finals of the competition. During rehearsals [[Jennifer Lopez]] remarked, "I like this kid. I love Sanjaya!" after hearing him sing in Spanish, the only one of the remaining eight contestants to do so on the Latin-theme night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Archives |first=Actress |url=http://www.actressarchives.com/news/sanjaya-malakar-voted-off-of-american-idol |title=Sanjaya Malakar voted off of American Idol |publisher=Actressarchives.com |date=April 19, 2007 |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807084557/http://www.actressarchives.com/news/sanjaya-malakar-voted-off-of-american-idol |archivedate=August 7, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Randy Jackson commented, "You're one of the smartest contestants I've ever met. That was actually really good. It was," while Simon Cowell offered the halting, "I'm going to hate myself for this. It wasn't horrible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com/2007/04/10/american-idol-top-eight-%e2%80%93-sanjaya-one-of-the-smartest-contestants-ever/ |title=American Idol Top Eight – Sanjaya One Of The Smartest Contestants Ever |publisher=Realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malakar continued on, entering the Top 7, following that performance on the April 11 results show.

After performing "[[Something to Talk About (Bonnie Raitt song)|Something to Talk About]]" on the previous night, Malakar was placed in the bottom three and was subsequently eliminated in 7th place on April 18, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/04/19/american.idol.ap/ CNN.com]{{dead link|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070419/us_nm/americanidol_dc_2 Yahoo! News]{{dead link|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singing his farewell performance, after the line "let's give them something to talk about", he [[ad lib]]bed "other than hair" in place of "how about love".&lt;ref name="sanjigone"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://niralimagazine.com/2007/04/he-may-be-gone-but-sanjaya-is-still-our-papaya/ |title=He May Be Gone, But Sanjaya Is Still Our Papaya |publisher=Niralimagazine.com |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930013820/http://niralimagazine.com/2007/04/he-may-be-gone-but-sanjaya-is-still-our-papaya/ |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[American Idol]]'''s ratings dropped 9% in the episode following Malakar's elimination, which was ''[[Idol Gives Back]]'', a charity episode featuring many celebrity guests. The music news website Moldolva.org reported that this was due to Malakar's departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://music.moldova.org/news/american-idol-highest-ratings-due-to-sanjaya-44947-eng.html |title="American Idol" highest ratings due to Sanjaya |publisher=Music.moldova.org |date=April 30, 2007 |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117101509/http://music.moldova.org/news/american-idol-highest-ratings-due-to-sanjaya-44947-eng.html |archivedate=January 17, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the May 23 ''American Idol'' finale, he performed with the top six males, introduced [[Smokey Robinson]] in the medley. Malakar performed "You Really Got Me" with [[Aerosmith]] guitarist [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] on guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.entertainment.yahoo.com/s/12032007/6/entertainment-aerosmith-rock-india-first-time.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315073046/http://ca.entertainment.yahoo.com/s/12032007/6/entertainment-aerosmith-rock-india-first-time.html |archivedate=2007-03-15 |title=Aerosmith to rock India for the first time |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=March 15, 2007 |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public reaction ===

Malakar was the season's most talked about ''American Idol'' contestant, based on articles and searches conducted on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/sanjaya_out |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619043420/http://www.usmagazine.com/sanjaya_out |archivedate=2008-06-19 |title=Buh-Bye-Ya, Sanjaya! |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=June 19, 2008 |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buzzlog.yahoo.com/buzzlog/67409/sanjayas-hair-raising-searches |title=Sanjaya's Hair Raising Searches |publisher=Buzzlog.yahoo.com |date=March 27, 2007 |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129142234/http://buzzlog.yahoo.com/buzzlog/67409/sanjayas-hair-raising-searches |archivedate=January 29, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One ''American Idol'' fan on MySpace claimed to be on a [[hunger strike]] until Malakar was voted off; she later admitted that she was canceling her strike, after his stay was longer than expected. In her YouTube video, an advertisement for a dating site was prominently displayed, causing speculation her hunger strike was really for profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date = 2007-03-21 |url=http://entertainment.bodogbeat.com/sanjaya-malakar-inspires-a-hunger-strike-68543.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328210301/http://entertainment.bodogbeat.com/sanjaya-malakar-inspires-a-hunger-strike-68543.html |archivedate=2007-03-28 |title=Sanjaya Malakar Inspires a Hunger Strike |accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other members of the MySpace online community created a page entitled Team Sanjaya in support for him. However, members of the online community have contributed semi-fictional web sites, appearing to portray Malakar in a more satirical but supportive way. Websites parodying Malakar's success had also appeared.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070406172327/http://ifsanjayawins.com/ ifsanjayawins.com].

The weblog [[Vote for the Worst]] had Malakar as its current "pick" for the sixth season top 12 until he was eliminated. On March 19, 2007, [[Howard Stern]] campaigned for his radio show listeners to join the weblog in voting for Malakar "to corrupt the No.1 show on television".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/howard_stern_corrupts_i_idol_i |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731093921/http://www.usmagazine.com/howard_stern_corrupts_i_idol_i |archivedate=2008-07-31 |title=Howard Stern Corrupts Idol! |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=July 31, 2008 |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1555113/20070320/id_0.jhtml |title= Is Howard Stern Behind Sanjaya Malakar's Staying Power On 'Idol'? |accessdate=2007-03-22 |date=2007-03-20 |last=Harris |first = Chris | publisher = MTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Edward | last=Wyatt | title=Howard Stern Tries to Kill 'American Idol' With Kindness for a Weak Link | date=2007-03-31 | publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/31/arts/television/31idol.html?ex=1332993600&amp;en=ecc4f2e2914562da&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink | work =The New York Times | accessdate = 2007-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Stern regulars claimed to have voted for Malakar over 300 times—largely in hopes of tormenting ''[[American Idol]]'' traditionalists on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quchronicle.com/2007/04/vote-for-the-worst-american-idol/ |title=Vote for the Worst American Idol |publisher=Quchronicle.com |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jkim"&gt;{{cite web|author=TstarV |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTRD1UKyTc |title=Sanjaya On Jimmy Kimmel Live! 04/26/07 |work=Youtube |date=August 5, 2007 |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when asked for a reaction, Malakar told [[Jimmy Kimmel]] that his aunt had voted 1100 times.&lt;ref name="jkim"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ultrabrown.com/ |title=Ultrabrown |publisher=Ultrabrown |date=June 23, 1985 |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201031537/http://ultrabrown.com/ |archivedate=December 1, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fan reaction of [[Ashley Ferl]] was satirized on the March 24, 2007 broadcast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', during the ''[[Weekend Update]]'' segment. Malakar was portrayed by [[Andy Samberg]], and the crying girl was portrayed by [[Kristen Wiig]]. Also feigning tears in the audience were [[Fred Armisen]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]]. Samberg portrayed Malakar again during the monologue of the April 21, 2007 episode, singing the song "Something To Talk About" as a duet with host [[Scarlett Johansson]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', March 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy spawned colloquialisms associated with Malakar's name, such as "Sanjayamania"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/07/15/PKGRMQTFQV1.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=IDOL WATCH / Sanjayamania | first=Aidin | last=Vaziri | date=July 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and "Fanjaya" to denote a Sanjaya fan.

As of May 2012, Malakar is now a bartender living in [[Queens, New York]]. Of the money he made, Malakar admits most has been lost: "I was young. I didn't know anything. Some people took advantage. Some skimmed a little off the top, financially."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/thebigblog/2012/05/21/hey-whatever-happened-to-sanjaya-malakar/ | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | title=Hey, whatever happened to Sanjaya Malakar?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Compass Institute Inc.''' is a charity organisation for young Queenslanders with a disability. It is Australia's first accredited Disability Service based on the principles of [[Budō|Japanese Budo]].&lt;ref name=Engel&gt;{{cite news|last=Engel|first=Nicky|title=The Compass Institute- Charting a Course for Change|newspaper=Business Matters Magazine|date=November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Compass is a registered member of the National Disability Services, providing post-school services for young people with an intellectual disability.&lt;ref name="nds website"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Disability Services|url=https://www.nds.org.au/links/page/3|publisher=NDS website}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Compass has been operating as a not for profit organisation since the early 90's.&lt;ref name=Engel/&gt;   It began in 1991 as 'The Aikido Institute' providing alternative education and intervention programmes to school-aged children.&lt;ref name=Blitz&gt;{{cite news|title=Aikido School Makes a Difference for Disabled|newspaper=Blitz Australasian Martial Arts Magazine|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1992 and 2006 over 7000 children participated in the intervention programmes.&lt;ref name=Engel /&gt;&lt;ref name="Win a diamond"&gt;{{cite news|title=Support a Local Charity...Win a Diamond!|newspaper=Sunshine Valley Gazette|date=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brian&gt;{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Peter|title=Students Make a Stand for Brian|newspaper=Sunshine Coast Daily|date=21 June 2002|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2003 The Aikido Institute became The Compass Institute Inc., and began providing post-school education, training and vocational opportunities to young people with intellectual and/or physical disabilities.&lt;ref name=Engel /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fudge&gt;{{cite news|last=Fudge|first=Nicole|title=Sporting Chance for Compass to Hit Goals|newspaper=Caloundra Weekly|date=March 23, 2011|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Compass is a registered charity employing 30 specialist staff and supporting over 70 young people with intellectual and/or physical disabilities through 6 centres from Gladstone to Gympie.&lt;ref name=Bode&gt;{{cite news|last=Bode|first=Mark|title=Compass on Course|newspaper=Sunshine Coast Daily|date=16 June 2011 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of these centres is a working farm, which provides opportunities for around 20 young people to gain access to further training in animal husbandry, horticulture, nursery work, and property maintenance.&lt;ref name=Bode /&gt;

==Education==
The Compass Institute Inc. provides further education in a broad range of subjects. The goal of the Institute is to provide real life skills with a focus on personal development and independent living.  This includes literacy, numeracy, communication, fitness, social skills, food preparation, personal grooming, transport and community participation.&lt;ref name="School trans compas web"&gt;{{cite web|title=School Transitions|url=https://www.compassinc.org.au/education/school-transitions/|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compass employs staff in roles such as teachers, trainers, coaches and mentors, similarly those that attend Compass are students or 'Trainees' and not referred to as 'clients'.

==Training and vocation==
The organisation works on making pathways for disabled young people to become increasingly independent.&lt;ref name=Campion&gt;{{cite news|last=Campion|first=Alice|title=Funding a Must for Disabled Teens|url=https://sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/funding-must-disabled-teens/7773701|accessdate=4 June 2013|newspaper=Sunshine Coast Daily|date=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to Compass training and vocation units is the provision of "real further education, skills-based training and vocational opportunities as part of a structured pathway to social and economic participation".&lt;ref name=Campion /&gt; Through the vocational pathways Compass provides, people with a disability have successfully been placed into appropriate and rewarding work.&lt;ref name=Campion /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fears&gt;{{cite news|title=Ignoring fears pays off in staff addition|newspaper=Sunshine coast Daily|date=September 23, 2011|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Compass Institute Inc. is involved in setting up [[social enterprise]]s as vocational pathways for its trainees. These are ‘real life’ businesses that are integrated into the local community, including lawn and garden maintenance, Vehicle detailing, business support services, art and craft markets and the Compass Farm.&lt;ref name="community enterprises"&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Enterprises|url=https://www.compassinc.org.au/vocations/community-enterprises/|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purchase of an 8 hectare property enabled the organisation to set up an innovative educational and vocational setting, known as the Compass Farm.&lt;ref name=Bode /&gt; At this facility trainees can undertake vocational training, work experience and therapy.&lt;ref name=Fencing&gt;{{cite news|title=Fencing for Compass|newspaper=Sunshine Valley News|date=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, 20 people with disabilities, ranging in ages from 20 to 30 undertook training and work programs at the property.&lt;ref name=Bode /&gt; Activities range from animal husbandry, mixed horticulture, nursery work and property maintenance work.&lt;ref name=Bode /&gt;&lt;ref name=farm&gt;{{cite web|title=Compass Farm|url=https://www.compassinc.org.au/vocations/compass-farm/|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Martial values==
Underpinning the structure and organisation of both the service provision and management of Compass are the philosophies of Japanese Budo.&lt;ref name=Engel /&gt; The early work of the Aikido Institute (now The Compass Institute Inc.) involved running intervention programs and life skills classes that used [[Aikido]] and [[Budō]] to help students with goal setting, anger management, time management, and self-defence.&lt;ref name=High&gt;{{cite news|title=Students Learn to Hold Heads High|newspaper=Sunshine Coast Daily|date=June 21, 2001|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These “unique experiential programs” employed the principles of traditional martial arts philosophy and practice to engage students.&lt;ref name="Win a diamond" /&gt;   From here Compass branched out into the disability service, but the role of Aikido and budo philosophy has never ceased to have an important role in the running of Compass.

Compass CEO [[David Dangerfield]] has been using martial arts to help build physical skills and self-confidence in people for over 30 years. He saw the potential to do the same with people with both physical or intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref name=Engel /&gt;   "These individuals are always reminded of what they can't do, Martial arts is something they can do. It's a great physical outlet..."&lt;ref name=Engel /&gt;

'''Theodor Ludwig Wilhelm von Bischoff'''  (28 October 1807 in [[Hannover]] – 5 December 1882 in [[Munich]]) was a German physician and biologist.

== Biography ==

'''Think-pair-share''' is a collaborative teaching strategy first proposed by Frank Lyman of the University of Maryland in 1981. It can be used to help students form individual ideas, discuss and share with the others in-group. It can be used before reading or teaching a concept and works better with smaller groups.&lt;ref name=Ref01&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lyman|first1=Frank|title=Think-pair-share|publisher=MAA-CIE Cooperative News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
In think-pair-share strategy the teacher acts as a facilitator, and poses a question or a problem to the students. The students are given sufficient time to think and gather their thoughts, after which the teacher asks them to pair themselves and share their thoughts with each other.

As the students begin to share their thoughts and views, each learns to see the different perspective of thinking among their peers. By doing so the students learning is enhanced by the formation and articulation of an idea. This also enables the students to have clarity of thought and have the ability to communicate their thoughts and ideas to another student.

If time permits the paired students can share their thought with other paired students, and teachers can ask one or two pairs to share their ideas with the entire class.

Think-pair-share is designed to help the student to understand the concept of the given topic, develop ability to filter the information and formulate an idea or thought, and draw conclusions. The most important aspect of the think-pair-share is that students will develop the ability to consider and appreciate the different viewpoints of their peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readingrockets.org/strategies/think-pair-share|title=Think-Pair-Share|work=Reading Rockets}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/about/administration/sheridan-center/teaching-learning/effective-classroom-practices/think-pair-share|title=Think-Pair-Share|work=Brown University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

*The process is easy to prepare and takes only a small amount of time to perform in class.
*The interaction with students at personal level is intended to motivate those students who may not be generally interested in the topic.
*Different kinds and levels of questions can be asked from lower order to higher order thinking questions.
*Teacher can understand the different thought processes of the students while listening to the pairs and when the students share their view at the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/interactive/tpshare.html|title=Think-Pair-Share|work=Interactive Lectures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In business, '''training simulation''' is a virtual medium through which various types of skills can be acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Gopinath, C. and Sawyer, J. (1999). ''Exploring the Learning from an Enterprise Simulation, Journal of Management Development''&lt;/ref&gt; Training simulations can be used in a variety of genres; however they are most commonly&lt;ref&gt;Henfrey, Richard (1989). ''"Executive" simulation'', Executive Development, Vol. 3 Iss: 2&lt;/ref&gt; used in corporate situations to improve [[business]] awareness and [[management]] skills. They are also common in academic environments as an integrated part of a business or management course.

The word [[simulation]] implies an imitation of a real-life process, usually via a computer or other technological device, in order to provide a [[lifelike experience]]. This has proven to be a reliable and successful method of training in thousands of industries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Ellet, Bill (1997). ''TMR Shortlist of Business Simulations'', Training Media Review Publications&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used both to allow specialization in a certain area, and to educate individuals in the workings of the sectors as a whole, making training simulations versatile. Training simulations are not just games;&lt;ref&gt;Klabbers, Jan H. G. (1999). ''Three Easy Pieces: A Taxonomy of Gaming''. In Saunders, Danny and Severn, Jackie (eds.) ''The International Simulation &amp; Gaming Research Yearbook: Simulations and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning''&lt;/ref&gt; their aim is to educate and inform in an exciting and memorable way, rather than purely to entertain.

__TOC__

==Purpose==

Companies across the world regularly use simulations as a tool to teach employees.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Elizabeth, O’Loughlin, Andrew and McFadzean, Elspeth (2005). ''[http://www.pogc.ir/portals/0/maghalat/890706-2.pdf Corporate Entrepreneurship and Innovation Part 2: A Role- and Process-based Approach]'', European Journal of Innovation Management, Vol. 8 Iss: 4&lt;/ref&gt; With the enormous range of simulation-based activities available, it is unsurprising that the specific aims of the sessions vary widely. Some simulations are focused on [[decision making|making decisions]] in a particular area of the business, such as personnel or [[product design]], and these are called ''Functional Simulations''. Others give a general overview of a company and give experience of making executive management decisions, and are called ''Total Enterprise Simulations''.&lt;ref&gt;Biggs, William D. (1990).'' [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.455.1754&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Introduction to Computerized Business Management Simulations].'' In Gentry (ed.) ''Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning''&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, however, this classification has become somewhat impractical, as increasing numbers of training simulations are involving both elements, and combining both an overall view of the industry with some decisions relating to specific sectors.

Training Simulations normally form part of a program designed to educate employees or students about the skills needed to operate a business, as well as persuade them to "[[think outside the box]]" and see the bigger picture.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Graham A. ''Home and Away: Application of the Executive Simulation for Education and Training Purposes in Dundee and Malaysia''&lt;/ref&gt; This can make for a better organized, more fluid system in which all employees understand their part in making the company successful.


 
Although the most common use for training simulations is in a [[corporate]] setting,&lt;ref&gt;Declan Doyle, F. William Brown, (2000). ''[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/F_Brown/publication/235314940_Using_a_business_simulation_to_teach_applied_skills_-_The_benefits_and_the_challenges_of_using_student_teams_from_multiple_countries/links/0deec52a5e16008bae000000/Using-a-business-simulation-to-teach-applied-skills-The-benefits-and-the-challenges-of-using-student-teams-from-multiple-countries.pdf Using a business simulation to teach applied skills – the benefits and the challenges of using student teams from multiple countries]'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 24 Iss: 6&lt;/ref&gt; simulation games are increasingly being used to educate young people about the importance of business. From secondary school age all the way up to [[MBA]] students, anyone can benefit from the first-hand experience of running a company and making decisions that directly affect performance.&lt;ref&gt;Prohaska, Charles R. and Frank, Ellen J. (1990). ''[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1046878190211004 Using Simulations to Investigate Management Decision Making]''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 21 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; This will allow the participants to gain an overall understanding of the business world, and give some insight into the type of skills that are necessary to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;Elgood, Chris (1996). ''Using Management Games''&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to note that ‘beating the game’ should not be a primary aim for anyone taking part in a simulation; the focus should be directed towards everyone gaining some useful and relevant knowledge that they can take away and use in their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Michael J. R. and Reddy, Peter (2010). ''[http://eprints.aston.ac.uk/20147/1/Butler__Reddy_JEIT_-_Developing_Critical_Understanding_through_EBL_and_Storytelling.pdf Developing Critical Understanding in HRM Students: Using Innovative Teaching Methods to Encourage Deep Approaches to Study]'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 34 Iss: 8/9&lt;/ref&gt; If the simulation does have a competitive element, it is to motivate and inspire, rather than encourage any malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;Hynes, Briga, Costin, Yvonne and Birdthistle, Naomi (2011). ''Practice-based Learning in Entrepreneurship Education: A Means of Connecting Knowledge Producers and Users''. Higher Education, Skills and Work-based Learning, Vol. 1 Iss: 1&lt;/ref&gt; Some training activities are non-competitive to avoid this, however many noted experts in the field state that the rivalry between teams or individuals improves the learning experience and adds a sense of fun and drama into the simulation.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, D. J. (1997). ''Group Competitiveness and Cohesion in a Business Simulation''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 28 Iss: 4&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly important when working with young people such as students, as they often require an extra boost to keep them entertained, especially when a simulation is run over an extended period.

==Development==

The concept of training employees to have a wider perspective on their position within the workplace has been around for hundreds of years,&lt;ref&gt;Keys, Bernard and Wolfe, Joseph (1990). ''The Role of Management Games and Simulations in Education and Research''. Journal of Management, Vol. 16, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; but it is only relatively recently that the idea of creating a simulated environment for trainees to test their abilities and skills has been developed. The first commercially available training simulation was in 1956, and was called ''The Top Management Decision Game'', and was created by the [[American Management Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Naylor, Thomas H. (1971). ''Computer Simulation Experiments with Models of Economic Systems''.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the market has expanded hugely, with thousands of simulations available based upon hundreds of different industries. Initially simple with just a few choices to make, some simulations have become extremely complex with many different interlinking decisions. When training simulations were first used, they involved paper forms that were filled in by the participants and then compared by the organizer of the exercise. Nowadays, nearly all simulations are [[computer]] based,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, John M. (2007). ''Business Simulations - Do They Have a Place in Training?''&lt;/ref&gt; and involve multi-stage algorithms that calculate performance based on the decisions entered.&lt;ref&gt;Fripp, John (1997). ''A Future for Business Simulations?'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 21 Iss: 4&lt;/ref&gt; Most simulations are based around a real [[industry]], and hence they use real data to be as accurate as possible and to provide a realistic experience. However, some remain generic and do not model a particular industry, although these tend to be more useful for younger players or those with absolutely no business knowledge.

==Integrated==

Most corporations and academic courses that contain a training simulation integrate it into an existing or completely new training programme.&lt;ref&gt;Faria, A. J. (1987). ''A Survey of the Use of Business Games in Academia and Business''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 18 No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the participants to get the maximum value from the experience, as well as review the sessions in order to improve them for future use. The structure of a training session would normally be as follows:

* '''Introduction:''' the organizer of the program (plus sometimes a specialist in the training simulation) will meet the participants and give them a brief explanation of the purposes behind the training and what they should hope to achieve.
* '''Lectures:''' sometimes the trainees will also receive one or more lectures around the topics that the simulation will be based on, in order to give them an idea of the type of skills they will need. This is especially important within academia, when the students will often be examined on this section after the event.
* '''The simulation:''' the simulation will then be played, allowing newly acquired knowledge to be tested and skills practiced. A positive atmosphere is vital here to maintain enthusiasm.
* '''Evaluation:''' once the simulation has been completed, it is important to summarize what has been learnt and the effectiveness of the training. Presenting results to others may provide a means of internal assessment, as well as showcasing the players’ achievements.

This integrated [[training]] will allow everyone taking part in the simulation to get the maximum experience possible, as well as being entertaining, exciting and giving them a new perspective on the business world. Many companies that specialize in training simulations also offer to create a special integrated plan unique to the client,&lt;ref&gt;Wenzler, I (2005). ''[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d8bc/e727abf8da27f3dc4497b00499129fd31d78.pdf Development of an asset management strategy for a network utility company: Lessons from a dynamic business simulation approach]''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 36 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; to make the process as streamlined and efficient as possible.

==Benefits==

Since training simulations are available based on such a wide range of different industries, and with thousands of different aims and objectives, it is difficult to outline a specific skill-set that will be improved by taking part in a training simulation. However, skills that good training simulations should build on include:

* '''Business awareness''' – before participating in the training programme, many players will have little idea of how to run a business or what it involves. Simulations allow them to temporarily have control over a virtual company, to see whether their decisions lead them to success or failure!&lt;ref&gt;Cruz, Natalia, Escudero, Anna, Barahona, Juan and Leitao, Fernando (2009). ''[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/03090590910950578 The Effect of Entrepreneurship Education Programmes on Satisfaction with Innovation, Behaviour and Performance]'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 33 Iss: 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Time management and organization''' – most simulations contain timed sessions, which will test the candidates’ skill in submitting decisions within the allotted time slot.&lt;ref&gt;Whicker, Lynn, Marcia and Sigelman, Lee (1991). ''Computer Simulation Applications, An Introduction''&lt;/ref&gt; This is an excellent skill for any employee or graduate.
* '''Team coordination''' – the majority of training simulations involve working in groups or teams of people;&lt;ref&gt;Wellington, W. J. and Faria, A. J. (1992). ''An Examination on the Effect of Team Cohesion, Player Attitude and Performance Expectations on Simulation Performance Results''&lt;/ref&gt; improving the abilities to communicate effectively, delegate tasks and diplomatically resolve any situations.
* '''Problem solving''' – simulations will often present tricky circumstances that must be thought through logically to be solved.&lt;ref&gt;Faria, A. J. (2001). ''[http://www.coulthard.com/library/Files/faria_2001_thechangingnatureofbusinesssimulationgamingresearch.pdf The Changing Nature of Business Simulation/Gaming Research: A Brief History]''. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 32 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Successful resolution of these shows good management skills.
 
If every participant improves in these four key skill areas, the training programme will be a success, and any business should notice an improvement in efficiency and motivation, and students will be inspired and animated.&lt;ref&gt;''Business Simulation Means Better Senior Managers at Heinz'', Journal of European Industrial Training, Vol. 23 Iss: 1&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4202">The '''UCLA Language Materials Project''' ('''LMP''') maintains a web resource about teaching materials for some 150 languages that are [[Less Commonly Taught Languages|less commonly taught]] in the [[United States]]. The project, funded by the [[U.S. Department of Education]], was created in 1992. It is part of the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] Center for World Languages. 

== Bibliographic database of teaching materials ==

The website provides full bibliographic information for over 7000 items, including textbooks, readers, phrasebooks, grammars, dictionaries, and supplementary materials that are distributed in print, audio, video, web and computerized instruction formats. It offers detailed descriptions of the content and other features of each material, to help users find the most appropriate tools for their individual teaching and learning needs. Items can be located quickly through menus displayed at the top of each webpage, or through an advanced search. The LMP does not sell the materials listed in the database, but does provide information on retailers and distributors where the materials can be obtained. 

== Database and guide to authentic materials ==

The website also provides citations of about 1000 Authentic Materials, language materials originally intended for [[native speaker]]s rather than [[second-language learner]]s. Because such items reflect current culture and actual language usage, they are much valued as teaching tools. The database presents native-language posters, signs, advertisements, product labels, games, maps, schedules, and brochures that can be downloaded for free from the LMP website. There are also links to selected external websites that offer native-language audio, video, and print resources. The Authentic Materials page provides a guide to using those materials in the classroom, including sample lesson plans. 

== Language profiles ==

Each LMP language has its own webpage, providing a language profile, a direct link to the LMP citations for that language, and links to relevant external websites for teachers and students of the language. The profile provides a map, a description of key dialects, grammatical features, relationship to other languages, a [[linguistic history]], and sociolinguistic information.

== Materials reports ==

These reports provide a numeric summary of the categories of materials cited for each language in the database. They are used by publishers and policy makers to assess the U.S. availability of teaching materials for a given language.

== CARLA database ==

A direct link to the [[University of Minnesota]]'s database of the courses in less commonly taught languages offered by over 2000 schools, colleges and other programs in the U.S. and Canada. CARLA stands for Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition. 

== CAL database ==

An additional database of teaching materials for less commonly taught languages, produced by the Center for Applied Linguistics in Washington, DC, and hosted by the LMP. It offers brief summaries of materials for languages beyond the 150 in the LMP database.

== Links for language teachers ==

The LMP website offers selected links to language resource centers, professional language teachers' associations, scholarly publications, and distributors of language-teaching materials.

== K-12 language-teaching resources ==

A separate portal for people teaching less commonly taught languages to students in kindergarten through 12th grade. Offerings include a section on curricular frameworks and standards, links to dozens of outside resources for [[K-12]] language teachers, and a year's worth of free lesson plans for teachers to download and adapt to their own classrooms. The lessons are grouped into thematic units (e.g. 10 lessons on school, 5 lessons on likes and dislikes, 15 on friends and relationships), and offer lively activities for learning to communicate in the target language.

The '''Ukrainian Admission Center''' ({{lang-uk|Український Приймальний Центр}}) is the official Ukrainian organization founded with support of [[Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine]]. Meanwhile, '''Ukrainian Admission Center''' is a private company and a part of AbroStudy LLC&lt;ref&gt;[http://abrostudy.com AbroStudy - Education Abroad for International Students]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
On April 11, 2016, it was decided to create international organization that will helps international students with admission and education abroad. 
After analyzing the situation, it was revealed that students experience difficulties when entering abroad. This is primarily due to the fake agents. The new organization should resolve this problem.
The Ukrainian Admission Center was launched on a test mode. A year later, after the analysis of it work, similar centers will be launched in several other countries:  [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Poland]], Perhaps in [[Hungary]], [[Cyprus]], [[Kazakhstan]]
 
'''Ukrainian Admission Center''' was founded on 14 May 2016. In first month of work there was more than 1500 applications from foreign students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/242-91-%D0%BF Declaration of Cabinet of Ministers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since january 2017 Ukrainian Admission Center works in normal mode.

==Structures==
The center consists of the central body with headquarter in [[Kharkiv]] and offices in the largest universities in regional centers:

The '''University of North Texas College of Music''', based in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]], is a comprehensive music school among the largest enrollment of any music institution accredited by the [[National Association of Schools of Music]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://music.unt.edu/about UNT School of Music - About]&lt;/ref&gt; It developed the first jazz studies program in the nation, and it remains one of the top schools for [[Jazz]].  As one of thirteen colleges and schools at the [[University of North Texas]], it has been among the largest music institutions of higher learning in North America since the 1940s.  North Texas has been a member of the [[National Association of Schools of Music]] for {{age|1939|01|01}} years.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; Since the 1970s, approximately one-third of all North Texas music students have been enrolled at the graduate level.  Music at North Texas dates back to the founding of the university in 1890 when [[Eliza Jane McKissack]], its founding director, structured it as a conservatory.

==Overview==
The College of Music is a comprehensive institution of international rank.&lt;ref name="US News"&gt;{{Cite web | title = U.S. News and World Report 2012 Rankings | url = http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/unt-3594| accessdate = September 13, 2011 |work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt; Its heritage dates back {{Cardinal to word|{{age|format=raw|1890|09|01}}}} years, when North Texas was founded. The college has one of the largest enrollment of any music institution accredited by the [[National Association of Schools of Music]],&lt;ref&gt;''HEADS Data &amp;ndash; Special Report, 2010–11'', [[National Association of Schools of Music]]&lt;/ref&gt; of which it has been a member for {{age|1939|01|01}} years.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; It has been among the largest music institutions of higher learning in North America since the 1940s.  The college awards [[bachelor of music]], [[master of music]], [[doctor of philosophy]], and [[Doctor of Musical Arts|doctor of musical arts]] degrees and non-degree graduate artist certificates. Concentrations include performance, [[music composition]], [[music education]], [[music history]], [[music theory]], [[ethnomusicology]], and jazz studies.  Its size, its array of disciplines organized across eight academic divisions, its six research centers, its six major ensemble areas that produce over 70 ensembles, and the number of degrees offered — from bachelor's degrees to doctorates to artist certificates — allows the college the achieve the type of critical mass to be highly comprehensive (wide and deep) and prolific in academics, research, and performance, from big to small to standard to experimental to esoteric.

In performance, the public review of the college's total work is presented through over 1,000 student and faculty concerts, annually, which include fully mounted opera, grand chorus, symphonic orchestra, early music, chamber music, jazz, orchestra, winds, experimental music, intermedia, and ethno music.  The [[music library]], founded in 1941, has one of the largest music collections in the United States, with over 300,000 volumes of books, periodicals, scores, and approximately 900,000 sound recordings.&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt;   Since the 1970s, approximately one-third of all North Texas music students have been enrolled at the graduate level. North Texas was first in the world to offer a degree in jazz studies. [[U.S. News and World Report]], in its annual ''America's Best Graduate Schools'', ranked the jazz studies program as the best in the country every year from 1994, when it began ranking graduate jazz programs, to 1997, when it retired the category.&lt;ref&gt;[[US News and World Report]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[One O'Clock Lab Band]] has been nominated for 7 [[Grammy Awards]].

== Degrees, divisions, and centers ==
The College of Music offers 19 programs leading to degrees and 1 leading to an artist certificate:&lt;ref name="Higher Education Arts Data Services"&gt;''Higher Education Data Service Data – Special Report, 2010-11'', [[National Association of Schools of Music]] Note:  For more than 20 years, North Texas Music enrollment has tracked closely to that of [[Jacobs School of Music|Indiana]].  Institutions that include [[Berklee]], [[Juilliard]], [[Manhattan School of Music]] are not among the 627 NASM members.  One non-NASM music school has a student enrollment larger than North Texas &amp;ndash; [[Berklee]].

== Selected history ==
* 1890 — when the University of North Texas was founded &amp;ndash; music was a part of the curriculum.  What then was a teachers college offered a "Conservatory Music Course" as part of the initial "Nine Full Courses." The complete course in music, lasting forty-four weeks, required private lessons that had to be paid for, in addition to regular school tuition. Tuition for these classes was $200 for the complete course, while regular tuition for a forty-week school year was only $48.  The founding president, Joshua Crittenden Chilton (1853–1896), taught the first classes in the history of music and the theory of sound. John M. Moore, a Dallas Methodist bishop and teacher of mathematics and engineering courses, taught the classes in voice culture and harmony. [[Mrs. Eliza Jane McKissack]] was also a teacher of music and may have served as the director of the music conservatory.&lt;ref name="Drake" /&gt;
* 1939 — North Texas became an associate member of the [[National Association of Schools of Music]]
* 1940 — North Texas became a full member of the [[National Association of Schools of Music]]
* 1941 — The [[National Association of Schools of Music]] approved graduate studies in music at North Texas&lt;ref&gt;"Bain Re-Elected Officer in NASM," ''[[Dallas Morning News]],'' January 5, 1943&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1950 — The School of Music began offering its first degrees leading to a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in the areas of [[musicology]], [[music composition|composition]], and [[music theory|theory]].
* 1960 — The oldest existing part of the current Music Building opens, along with Voertman Concert Hall.
* 1968 — The [[Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board]] approved degrees leading to a [[Doctor of Musical Arts]]&lt;ref name="DMN 1968 Apr 28" /&gt;
* 1975 — Most of the current Music building opens.
* 1989 — The School of Music restructured itself as a "[[college of music]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=It's "College of Music" Now|journal=Reverberations|date=Winter 1989|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc181752/|publisher=University of North Texas College of Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting nearly 60 years of size and breadth of many disciplines in the music arts.  The school leadership had long contemplated restructuring as a [[conservatory of music|conservatory]], but felt that a well-functioning college model, tailored specifically for North Texas, gave the entire university latitude to exploit the best of several models that included academic research, performance, composition, training music educators and music school administrators, and other areas &amp;ndash; and it preserved a streamline of cross-discipline of all areas within the College of Music and within the University.  The College of Music has enjoyed close collaboration with other Colleges within the University (''e.g.'', English faculty and students collaborating with composers, physics faculty and students collaborating with several divisions in areas that included musical acoustics, electronic music).  Despite the high caliber of student musicianship and seriousness of all the programs, the College of Music is accessible in many areas to non-music majors.

The '''Université Grenoble Alpes''' ('''UGA''', [[French language|French]]: meaning "''Grenoble Alps University''") is a [[Public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Grenoble]], [[France]]. Founded in 1339, it is the third largest university in France with about 45,000 students and over 3,000 researchers.

Established as the '''University of Grenoble''' by [[Humbert II of Viennois]], it split in 1971 following the [[May 1968 events]]. Three of the University of Grenoble's inheritors—[[Joseph Fourier University]], [[Pierre Mendès-France University]], and [[Stendhal University]]—reunited in 2016 to restore the original institution under the name Université Grenoble Alpes. The university is organized around two closely located urban campuses: Domaine Universitaire of 175 ha which straddles [[Saint-Martin-d'Hères]]  and [[Gières]], and Campus GIANT of 250 ha in [[Grenoble]]. UGA also owns and operates facilities in [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]], [[Chambéry]], [[Les Houches]], [[Villar-d'Arêne]], [[Mirabel, Ardèche|Mirabel]], [[Échirolles]], and [[La Tronche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communaute-univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/fr/presentation/chiffres-cles/|title=ComUE - Les chiffres-clés de la Communauté Université Grenoble Alpes|website=www.communaute-univ-grenoble-alpes.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ffj"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giant-grenoble.org/en/30-000-men-and-women-joining-forces-to-build-a-world-class-campus/|title=Oppportunities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Grenoble]] is one of the largest scientific centers in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Mark |last1=Esposito |date=November 2011 |title=The Grenoble Cluster of Minalogic: France's most competitive pole? |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237009624 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virgile-adam.com/grenoble|title=Virgile Adam, PhD|website=Virgile Adam, PhD}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosting facilities of every existing public research institution in France. This allows UGA to have hundreds of research and teaching partnerships, including close collaboration with the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] (CNRS) and the [[French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission]] (CEA). Overall, Grenoble as a city is the largest research center in France after Paris with 22,800 researchers.

UGA is traditionally known for its research and education in the [[natural science]]s and [[engineering]], but also [[law]], [[linguistics]], and [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communaute-univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en/news/universite-grenoble-alpes-continues-to-stand-out-in-international-rankings-598929.htm|title=ComUE - Université Grenoble Alpes continues to stand out in international rankings|website=www.communaute-univ-grenoble-alpes.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.communaute-univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/medias/fichier/cp-qsranking-mars2014_1412595630344-pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It has been cited among the best and most innovative universities in Europe.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/amers-reuters-ranking-innovative-univers-idUSL2N1C406D|title=Reuters Top 100: The World's Most Innovative Universities - 2016|date=28 September 2017|publisher=|via=Reuters|newspaper=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/europe&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-innovative-stories-europe-idUSKCN0Z00CT|title=Europe's Most Innovative Universities|date=14 June 2017|publisher=|via=Reuters|newspaper=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also renowned for its academic research in humanities and political sciences, hosting some of the largest research centers in France in fields such as [[political science]], [[urban planning]] or the [[sociology of organizations]].

==History==

===Early history (1339–1800)===
[[File:Dauphin Humbert II.jpg|thumb|left|145px|[[Humbert II of Viennois]], the university's founder]]
[[File:Seal First Universty of Grenoble (France).png|thumb|left|145px|First official seal]]
The University of Grenoble was founded in May 12, 1339 by [[Humbert II of Viennois]], the last independent ruler of [[Dauphiné]], a state of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Its purpose was to teach civil and canon law, medicine, and the liberal arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r7kTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA28|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference on the Constitution, Doctrine, Discipline, and History of the Catholic Church|first1=Charles George|last1=Herbermann|first2=Edward Aloysius|last2=Pace|first3=Condé Bénoist|last3=Pallen|first4=John Joseph|last4=Wynne|first5=Thomas Joseph|last5=Shahan|date=1 January 1913|publisher=Encyclopedia Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered a leader in the [[Renaissance]] revival of the classics and development of liberal arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.britannica.com/topic/Universities-of-Grenoble-I-II-and-III|title=Universities of Grenoble I, II, and III - university, Grenoble, France|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humbert's actions were inspired by his granduncle [[Robert, King of Naples]], at whose royal court Humbert spent his youth.&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/livreducentenai00grengoog#page/n23/mode/2up|title=Livre du centenaire de la faculté de droit: discours, études et documents|website=archive.org|publisher=Typographie et lithographie Allier Frères|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; King Robert, known as the Wise, skillfully developed Naples from a small port to a lavish city and had a reputation of a cultured man and a generous patron of the arts, friends with such great minds as [[Petrarch]], [[Boccaccio]], and [[Giotto]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Samantha, The New Solomon: Robert of Naples (1309-1343) and Fourteenth-Century Kingship, page 2 Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

Such rich experience contributed to Humbert's intention to create a university in his own state, and to do so he visited [[Pope Benedict XII]] to get a [[papal bull]] of approval.

Humbert cared deeply about his students, offering generous aid, protection, and even providing a hundred of them with free housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/livreducentenai00grengoog#page/n25/mode/2up|title=Livre du centenaire de la faculté de droit: discours, études et documents|website=archive.org|publisher=Typographie et lithographie Allier Frères|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humbert's financial losses during the [[Smyrniote crusades]], [[Black Death]], and [[Dauphiné]]'s attachment to France have greatly decreased the activity of the university leading to its closure, since a small mountainous town couldn't support its activity on its own.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

It was reopened again by [[Louis XI of France]] in 1475 in [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]] under the name [[University of Valence]], while the original university was restored in Grenoble in 1542 by [[Francis de Bourbon, Count of St. Pol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yf0a3OFlq3sC&amp;pg=PA756|title=The Encyclopedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information|first=Hugh|last=Chisholm|date=1 January 1911|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica Company|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two universities were finally reunited in 1565. At that point Grenoble was an important center of law practice in France, thus law practice was at the center of the university education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/livreducentenai00grengoog#page/n29/mode/2up|title=Livre du centenaire de la faculté de droit: discours, études et documents|website=archive.org|publisher=Typographie et lithographie Allier Frères|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French Revolution]], with its focus on the end to inherited privilege, led to the suppression of most universities in France. To revolutionaries, universities embodied bastions of corporatism and established interests. Moreover, lands owned by the universities and utilized for their support represented a source of wealth and therefore were confiscated, just as property possessed by the Church.

===Modern period (1800–1968)===
In 1805–1808, [[Napoleon]] reestablished faculties of law, letters, and science. The [[Bourbon Restoration]] had temporarily suppressed the Faculty of Letters and the Faculty of Law, but by the 1850s the university's activity had begun rapidly developing again.&lt;ref name=nye&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBelc0YcDboC&amp;pg=PA81|title=Science in the Provinces: Scientific Communities and Provincial Leadership in France, 1860-1930|first=Mary Jo|last=Nye|date=1 January 1986|publisher=University of California Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780520055612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the sciences at the university was spearheaded by the transformation of Grenoble from a regional center to a major supplier of industrial motors and electrical equipment in 1880s.&lt;ref name=nye/&gt; The faculties were formally inaugurated as the University of Grenoble in 1879 in the newly constructed Place de Verdun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-grenoble3.fr/1175503255134/0/fiche___article/|title=Accueil|first=Université Grenoble|last=Alpes|publisher=|access-date=2011-02-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114230359/http://www.u-grenoble3.fr/1175503255134/0/fiche___article/|archive-date=2010-01-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were around 3000 students in 1930.  Significant enrollment growth in the 1960s created pressures on the academic infrastructure of the university; the library [[Suzanne Dobelmann]] helped expand facilities, especially those relating to science and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Louis|first=Desgraves,|date=1994|title=Suzanne Kravtchenko-Dobelmann (1905-1993)|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/bec_0373-6237_1994_num_152_2_464348|journal=Bibliothèque de l'École des Chartes|language=fr-FR|volume=152|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history (1968–present)===
[[File:Ex-UPMF Grenoble Alpes University.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Some of the ex-UPMF facilities]]

Following riots among university students in [[May 1968]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/page/may1968france|title=France|work=the Guardian|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reform of French education occurred. The Orientation Act ''(Loi d’Orientation de l’Enseignement Superieur)'' of 1968 divided the old faculties into smaller subject departments, decreased the power of the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Ministry of National Education]], and created smaller universities, with strengthened administrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/rap/l06-372/l06-3722.html|title=Projet de loi relatif aux libertés des universités|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, sharing the fate of all French universities in 1970s, the University of Grenoble was split into four institutions. Each university had different areas of concentration of study and the faculties were divided as follows:

* ''Scientific and Medical University of Grenoble'', which in 1987 was renamed [[Joseph Fourier University]] (UJF), for sciences, health, and technology
* ''University of Economics and Law'', which in 1987 was renamed [[Pierre Mendès-France University]] (UPMF), for social sciences and humanities
** ''[[Grenoble Institute of Political Studies]]'', affiliated with UPMF and focusing on political science
* ''University of Languages and Letters'', which in 1987 was renamed [[Stendhal University]], for arts and languages
* ''[[Grenoble Institute of Technology]]'' (''Grenoble-INP'') for engineering

On 1 January 2016, the first three institutions reunited to restore the original common institution under the name Université Grenoble Alpes. Although Grenoble-INP remains separate, it is an active member of the [[Community Université Grenoble Alpes]] and cooperates very closely with the university not only in research projects, but also by sharing labs, offering mutual courses and training for students and researchers.

==Governance==
The Université Grenoble Alpes is a public institution of scientific, cultural and professional relevance, which, similar to other universities in France, is governed by a board of directors and an academic council elected every four years. The president of the university is elected by the board of Directors after each renewal, and is eligible for re-election once. On 3 December 2015, staff and students from Joseph Fourier University, Pierre Mendès-France University, and Stendhal University voted to elect representatives to the central councils of the new university. On 7 January 2016, the Board of Directors of the Université Grenoble Alpes elected Lise Dumasy as president. It was the first time a woman has been elected to head a merged university in France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.placegrenet.fr/2016/01/12/lise-dumasy-elue-a-tete-de-luniversite-grenoble-alpes/73153 placegrenet.fr on 12 January 2016, Lise Dumasy élue à la tête de l'université de Grenoble Alpes.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The university is also a member of the [[Community Université Grenoble Alpes]], a [[COMUE]] whose current president is Patrick Lévy. The association allows the humanities and social sciences and natural and formal sciences to be represented in the governance of the entire university system of Grenoble.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegrenoble.net/replay/si-on-parlait_35/si-on-parlait-25-janvier-2016_x3odx2e.html Télégrenoble, Émission ''Si on parlait'' du 25 janvier 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3206">'''The Wisconsin Idea Theatre''' was essentially a cultural program, developed at the [[University of Wisconsin]] c. 1943. It was headed by [[Robert E. Gard]] within the College of Agriculture, with a mission for developing theatre arts throughout the state.  Gard worked with anyone that had an idea, to develop radio dramas, or stage performances.  He worked with [[4-H]], seeking to develop children's theatre within the state, as well as encouraging and assisting faith groups to develop dramas based on their faith.&lt;ref name="communityarts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gardfoundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lakeplacid" /&gt;

In 1945, Gard founded the Wisconsin Idea Theatre Conference, which attempted to represent all theatre interests across the state.&lt;ref name="gardfoundation" /&gt;

== History ==
The Wisconsin Idea Theatre began when [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]] and [[Charles Van Hise]] attended the University of Wisconsin. They were close friends, both influenced by the progressive ideals of economics professor [[John Bascom]]. La Follette went on to become governor, while Van Hise became President of the University.  
They had a mutual vision of a government "infused with the talent of trained professionals, guided by the expertise of our wisest scholars and answerable to an active and well-educated citizenry."&lt;ref name="communityarts" /&gt;

In order to realise this ideal, they turned the University towards educating not only its students, but encouraging and teaching residents across the state.  Correspondence courses were offered, along with traveling faculty. The Governor held regular meetings with the professors of the University to keep in touch, and to encourage their progress.&lt;ref name="communityarts" /&gt;

Van Hise's successor, President [[Glen Frank]], had a passion for expanding the arts, and hired [[Dean Chris Christensen]] to head the College of Agriculture, hoping to encourage farmers, and their families to be more creative.&lt;ref name="communityarts" /&gt;

Christensen then hired [[Aldo Leopold]], a well-known conservationist, [[John Stuart Curry]], an artist, and [[Robert E. Gard]]. It was Gard that founded the Wisconsin Idea Theatre.&lt;ref name="communityarts" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4713">Many companies are part of an international cultural exchange program that is centered around the US State Departments J-1 Visa Work and Travel program.  The US State Department's Summer Work and Travel Program brings more than 100,000 foreign university students to the US each year.  All of the students are between the ages of 18 and 28.  All are proficient in the English language and all are able to commit to working for at least three months.  Some foreign students are able to work in the US for four months and some for five months.  The maximum length of stay is determined by the US State Department and is based in part on typical university schedules in each nation.  The Summer Work and Travel Program provides foreign students with an opportunity to live and work in the United States during their summer vacation from college or university to experience and to be exposed to the people and way of life in the United States.

==Program overview==
{{See also|Summer Work Travel Program#Program details}}

=== Work ===
Candidates do not normally need to have qualification or experience as training will be given at the place of work as necessary. The types of jobs on offer include sales-people, cashiers, hosts and staff in hotels, restaurants or entertainment parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://studyabroad.ua/dpages/vakansii-work-and-travel58/|title=Jobs in the US|last=studio|first=C4 web design|date=|website=studyabroad.ua|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Travel ===
Applicants may remain in the United States until the end of their exchange program, as specified on form DS-2019. Once a J-1 visitor's program ends, he or she may remain in the United States for an additional 30 days, often referred to as a "grace period", in order to prepare for departure from the country.
* The actual J-1 visa certificate does not specifically document this 30-day post-study/exam "grace period", and consequently some airline counter staff have refused to issue a boarding pass to an embarking student. In particular, when the student's return ticket is departing '''after''' the J-1 visa has expired. For example: the return date is the next day after the students last exam.
* If the visitor leaves the United States during these 30 days, the visitor may not re-enter with the J-1 visa.
The minimal and the maximal duration of stay are determined by the specific J-1 category under which an exchange visitor is admitted into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://j1visa.state.gov/participants/current/adjustments-and-extensions/|title=Adjustments and Extensions  {{!}}  Participants {{!}} J-1 Visa|last=State|first=Department of|website=j1visa.state.gov|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agencies ===
Agencies are representatives of the student candidates. The agencies are engaged in the search for vacancies with sponsors, will organize the vacancies and prepare the necessary documents for participation. Agencies are also engaged in health and safety issues and are available to help solve any problems which may arise for students during their stay in the USA.


==Legal aspects==
{{See also|Summer Work Travel Program#Requirements}}
Work and Travel USA students are subject to the [[Summer Work Travel Program]] requirements. The company charges a nominal fee to cover the costs of SEVIS, a program that tracks J-1 visa students and makes their anonymous distribution data publicly available on the J-1 visa website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://j1visa.state.gov/swt-participants-map/|title=Summer Work Travel Participants Map {{!}}  J-1 Visa|last=State|first=Department of|website=j1visa.state.gov|access-date=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the government requirements, Work and Travel USA students are required to:
* Register their information in SEVIS no later than ''10 days'' after arriving in the USA. It varies by each sponsoring organization.
* Update their SEVIS information within 10 days, if they change address during the time in the USA or if they switch jobs. 
* Check-in every ''30 days'' to maintain active status on the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.interexchange.org/sevis/|title=SEVIS {{!}} InterExchange|website=InterExchange|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1971">A '''Writing Fellow''' or '''Fellow in Writing''' is a tutor or [[consultant]] who assists with [[college]] and [[university]] writing instruction in specific [[Academic major|courses]] or academic fields. Whereas most [[Writing Center]] tutors are generalists, ready to work with writing from any course or field, Writing Fellows are specialists. Often working within a Writing Center or Writing Across a Curriculum program, they typically provide oral and/or written feedback on papers to students in an upper-division writing class. A Writing Fellow is most often a [[peer tutor]]; however, the term “Writing Fellow” is also sometimes used for faculty members who advise others on teaching, assigning and responding to student writing in their specific disciplines.
