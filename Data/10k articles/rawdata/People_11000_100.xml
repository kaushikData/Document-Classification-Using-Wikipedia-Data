He made his first appearance on-screen on 14 January 2001. Adam was played by [[Iain De Caestecker]] from the character's first appearance in 2001 until 21 July 2003 with Robertson taking over the role from 31 December 2004 until 20 April 2007. Robertson reprised the role in 2016 and made his return on screen on 16 November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.itv.com/coronationstreet/news/barlow-boys-casting-sam-robertson-rob-mallard|title=The Barlow Boys Are Back In Town|work=ITV||date=14 September 2016|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/spoilers/a813430/coronation-street-spoiler-phelans-luck-is-finally-starting-to-run-out/|title=Phelan's luck is finally starting to run out|date=8 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam is the son of [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) and [[Susan Barlow]] ([[Joanna Foster]]), and the grandson of [[Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]).

==Storylines==
===2001–2007===
Adam first appears aged 12 when he is visiting his uncle [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]), grandfather [[Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]) and Ken's partner [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Rachid]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]), with his mother, [[Susan Barlow]] ([[Joanna Foster]]). It is revealed that Ken's arch enemy and Susan's former husband, [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]), is Adam's father. Adam was injured in a car crash that killed Susan. Adam goes to live with Mike but leaves to go to boarding school in Scotland, but returns after doing his Highers exams.

Adam purchases a car from an auction, but in an embarrassing turn of events, after filling his car up with petrol on a day out with his girlfriend [[Candice Stowe]] ([[Nikki Sanderson]]), his car ignites by the roadside. The cause of the fire is a mystery, until a policewoman informs him that his car functions on [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], not petrol. He works at his father's factory, ''[[Weatherfield#Underworld|Underworld]]'', and irritates his older half-brother, [[Danny Baldwin]] ([[Bradley Walsh]]), by being the apple of his father's eye. He is dumped by ambitious Candice via letter, has a short fling with [[Kelly Crabtree]] ([[Tupele Dorgu]]), and has a crush on [[Sarah Platt]] ([[Tina O'Brien]]) when he first returns to Weatherfield. Adam begins dating shy factory worker [[Joanne Jackson (Coronation Street)|Joanne Jackson]] ([[Zaraah Abrahams]]) after they flirt at his birthday party.

Adam was devastated when Mike died of a [[heart attack]]. Adam was determined to bring Danny down after he steals his inheritance, unaware that Mike's will is invalid because a more recent will left everything to him. Only [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]) and Danny are aware that it existed and Danny is determined to ensure that Adam does not get his inheritance. However, following her split from Danny, Leanne gives a copy of the new will to Adam and he could have claimed his inheritance and press criminal charges against Danny. After Danny is questioned by the police, he offers Adam a 40% share of the factory and acting on Ken's advice, he accepts. In September 2006, Adam sells his 40% to [[Liam Connor]] ([[Rob James-Collier]]). Liam's older brother, [[Paul Connor (Coronation Street)|Paul]]  ([[Sean Gallagher (actor)|Sean Gallagher]]), purchases the remaining 60% in January 2007. Joanne later dumps Adam by text message, after not seeing him for months. Adam leaves Weatherfield in April and moves to [[Portsmouth]] with his uncle, Peter, where they open a bookies together.

===2016–===
In November 2016, on his return to Weatherfield, Adam is caught in ''Underworld'' by current owner, [[List of Coronation Street characters (2015)#Johnny Connor|Johnny Connor]] ([[Richard Hawley (actor)|Richard Hawley]]) and his son, [[List of Coronation Street characters (2015)#Aiden Connor|Aiden Connor]] ([[Shayne Ward]]). He, Peter and his step-aunt, [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]), visit Ken in hospital. They meet Ken's son, [[Daniel Osbourne (Coronation Street)|Daniel Osbourne]] ([[Rob Mallard]]). Adam joins his family for a meal and defends Tracy against her ex-husband, [[Robert Preston (Coronation Street)|Robert Preston]] ([[Tristan Gemmill]]). Adam gets revenge on Robert by calling environmental health. Daniel is suspected of stealing Adam's car when Tracy and Adam visit his flat and find student debts and become suspicious when his mother, [[Denise Osbourne]] ([[Denise Black]]) is nowhere to be found. Adam later has sex with [[Maria Connor]] ([[Samia Longchambon]]), causing a fight between him and Aidan in The Rovers. Adam continues his feud with Aidan, while forming a friendly rivalry with [[Todd Grimshaw]] ([[Bruno Langley]]) and Daniel.

In February 2017, Adam has sex with [[Rosie Webster]] ([[Helen Flanagan]]) and they begin a relationship. Adam finds out that Rosie and her sister, [[Sophie Webster]] ([[Brooke Vincent]]), buried [[cocaine]] in [[Brian Packham]]'s ([[Peter Gunn]]) allotment. When [[Who Attacked Ken?|Ken is pushed down the stairs by an unknown assailant]], Adam becomes prime suspect as he and Ken argued about Ken's will. Adam uses the drugs to blackmail Rosie into giving him a false alibi but is arrested when Rosie's alibi is proved false. As there is insufficient evidence to charge Adam, he is released. Adam becomes suspicious of Daniel but Tracy believes Adam was responsible and tries to set him up but he finds out and reveals that he is suspicious of Tracy. Tracy's daughter [[Amy Barlow]] (Ella Mulvaney), believes Adam is responsible and calls the police with evidence to prove that Adam is responsible. Adam is released again but his intentions turn to Daniel and his girlfriend, [[Sinead Tinker]] (Katie McGlynn). When Tracy and Amy disappear, Adam uses this to his advantage and frames her. Tracy confesses, trying to protect Amy as she believes that Amy could be responsible. Adam suspects Daniel after Tracy is cleared and kidnaps him, taking him to an isolated area and intends to make him confess but fails and Daniel escapes. Adam is arrested again and charged with Ken's attack, Daniel is revealed as Ken's real attacker as he hit him over the head with a poetry book, making him fall down the stairs.

Adam later discovers that Aidan is having an affair with Maria, when he sees them kissing. Adam takes a photo of them and uses it to blackmail Aidan. He plans to expose the affair to Aidan's fiancée, [[Eva Price]] ([[Catherine Tyldesley]]), but Eva reveals that she is aware of his affair with Maria and begs Adam to stop blackmailing Aidan, before revealing that she has faked her pregnancy so that Aidan will not go to Maria. Adam agrees, but Eva reveals that she is out for revenge and needs Adam's help. Adam agrees and they plan revenge. However, as Eva is about to marry Aidan, she changes her mind at the last minute about the plan to clear the factory and the bank accounts, unaware that Adam has proceeded with the plan. When the Connors discover Eva's deceit, they report her to the police. Eva angrily vows to Adam that she intends to drag him to prison with her.

==Creation==
Adam's existence is that of a retcon. Although off-screen, Susan didn't fake an abortion so she could leave [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]), she "aborted" her child as she wasn't prepared for motherhood. Also 2001 seems to hint that Ken never had contact with Susan after 1987 so wasn't aware of Adam, however this is untrue as he still visited Susan off-screen in that time. Susan was said to be present at Peter's wedding in 1990. Adam was introduced in January 2001, played by [[Iain De Caestecker]], as part of a storyline which involved a custody battle between long-time rivals [[Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]) and Mike, the character of Adam departed at the conclusion of the storyline, however De Caestecker reprised the role for two separate stints in 2002 and 2003. On 13 December 2004, it was reported by ''[[Digital Spy]]'' that the role of Adam had been recast with [[Sam Robertson]] taking over the role from 31 December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/news/a17637/new-actor-for-adam-baldwin-in-corrie/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In July 2016, it was announced that ''Coronation Street'' would be extending the Barlow family by reintroducing Adam along with [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] and [[Daniel Osbourne (Coronation Street)|Daniel Osbourne]]. It was announced that [[Chris Gascoyne]] had reprised his role as Peter and Rob Mallard had taken over the role as Daniel, followed by Robertson reprising his role as Adam. Addressing the plans, producer Kate Oates told ''[[Digital Spy]]'': "One of the things I am most excited about and something I consider a real privilege is that I am lucky enough to work on the longest-running soap. One of the longest-running families on that soap is the Barlows and why would you not want to strengthen that family? I love the idea of Ken as the head of the family which has Tracy, Simon and Amy. I am excited to bring Peter back to the show. I am delighted to meet Daniel Osborne, who is Ken’s child with Denise and I am excited to bring back Adam, who is Mike Baldwin’s son and Ken’s grandson. I think that strong family dynasty - the first family on the soap, as it were -  here, big, strong and sending ripples through the street, is really exciting and I am really looking forward to seeing that.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/coronation-street-spoilers-peter-barlow-return_uk_57921e63e4b0e3583c7915ca|title=Peter To Return To 'Corrie', Along With Two More Barlow Family Members|date=22 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of his return, Robertson said, “I’m delighted to be back. Coronation Street was my first job as an actor and is a special place for me. As a young actor it was a little overwhelming, so I’m looking forward to coming back and stamping my mark on the character - I feel there’s unfinished business with Adam".&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-09-14/coronation-street-barlow-bombshells---adam-peter-and-daniel-return-storylines-revealed|title=Coronation Street: Barlow bombshells - Adam, Peter and Daniel return storylines revealed!|work=Radio Times|last=Brown|first=David|date=14 September 2016|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the ''[[Radio Times]]'', asked if Adam would become a womaniser like his father Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), Robertson replied: "Oh yes, it’s in my contract! Absolutely Adam’s a womaniser and at the minute he doesn’t seem to have much regard for the women he’s with. He doesn’t seem to have much heart, but maybe this is leading to him getting his fingers burnt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-11-12/coronation-street-adam-barlow-to-be-a-mike-baldwin-style-womaniser---its-in-my-contract-says-sam-robertson|title=Coronation Street: Adam Barlow to be a Mike Baldwin-style womaniser - "It's in my contract," says Sam Robertson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, a "whodunnit" storyline involving the character of Ken Barlow began; the storyline saw an unknown person push Ken down the stairs in the Barlow household, with Adam being named as one of the suspects alongside Daniel, Peter, Tracy, Amy, [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]] and [[Sinead Tinker]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/who-pushed-ken-barlow-mystery-for-coronation-street-fans-35570543.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] released a poll to the ''Coronation Street'' website so that fans could share their thoughts as to who pushed Ken. Fans and viewers used the poll, with the majority's thoughts of the attacker being Adam. Robertson later admitted that he thinks Adam pushed Ken.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-04-11/coronation-street-star-sam-robertson-thinks-his-own-character-adam-pushed-ken---hes-the-firm-favourite&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3196864/coronation-streets-sam-robertson-puts-himself-in-the-frame-for-ken-barlows-attempted-murder-on-this-morning-and-admits-put-all-your-money-on-adam/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In August 2017, Robertson was longlisted for Sexiest Male at the [[Inside Soap Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harp|first1=Justin|title=Coronation Street, EastEnders, Emmerdale and Hollyoaks all make the Inside Soap Awards longlist|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/emmerdale/news/a836154/inside-soap-awards-longlist-coronation-street-eastenders-emmerdale-hollyoaks/|accessdate=22 August 2017|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|date=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made the viewer-voted shortlist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Inside Soap Awards 2017 shortlist revealed – which Corrie, EastEnders, Emmerdale and Hollyoaks stars are up for prizes?|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a841879/inside-soap-awards-2017-shortlist/|accessdate=31 October 2017|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|date=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but lost out to [[Davood Ghadami]], who portrays [[Kush Kazemi]] in ''[[EastEnders]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dainty|first1=Sophie|title=Emmerdale wins best soap at the Inside Soap Awards for the third year running|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/emmerdale/news/a842388/emmerdale-wins-best-soap-inside-soap-awards/|accessdate=6 November 2017|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ami Dar''' (born January 7, 1961) is the Founder and Executive Director of [[Action Without Borders|Idealist.org.]] Idealist serves more than 120,000 organizations around the world and has more than 1.4 million visitors every month between the English site (idealist.org), and the Spanish site (idealistas.org).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://info.idealist.org/|title=Idealist|website=Idealist|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life==
Dar was born January 7, 1961, in [[Jerusalem]], Israel, the eldest of three children, to a school teacher mother and diplomat father. He grew up in Peru and Mexico, and it was in Mexico City where he first became aware of the contrast of wealth and poverty around him, which started him on a path of dedication to social justice. 

In 1976, Dar and his family returned to Israel and from 1979 - 1982, he completed his mandatory service as a [[paratrooper]]. During this time Dar had an insight that fundamentally changed his thinking about borders and humanity and how labels define and separate people, which is often referred to as the "sock sharers story." {{Citation needed|reason=Medium is not a neutral source|date=August 2018}}

==Career==
In 1988 Dar joined [[Aladdin Knowledge Systems]], a software company based in [[Tel Aviv]]. From 1988 to 1992 he served as the International Marketing Manager. In 1992 he was named President and he relocated to New York City to establish their [[North America]]n branch.

By 1995 he had founded an early iteration of [[Action Without Borders|Idealist]], The Contact Center Network sponsored meeting spaces in several communities where people could connect with neighbors who might share interests and ideas for local action. In 1996 Dar began calling the online network [http://www.idealist.org/ Idealist.org]. 

=== Idealists of the World ===


In January of 2018 the Idealist team launched '''Idealists of the World''' which has over 23,300 members world wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://act.idealist.org/|title=Idealist Days|website=Idealist Days|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Idealists of the World participate in global Idealist Days which occur when the day and the month are the same number. The first global Idealist Day occurred on March 3rd, 2018 (3/3) with "75 events mobilizing nearly 500 people around the world, and 3000 people in the Idealists of the World Facebook group."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://act.idealist.org/about/|title=About|date=2018-03-21|work=Idealist Days|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy behind Idealist Day is rooted in Ami Dar's vision of a world progressing towards positive social change. This is accomplished by people making connections online and in person, bridging divides to collaborate together for a better tomorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@AmiDar/idealists-of-the-world-unite-c84b69429086|title=Idealists of the world, unite!|last=Dar|first=Ami|date=2018-01-01|website=Ami Dar|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this vision Dar has stated,&lt;blockquote&gt;I can't help noticing that all over the world, behind every label and stereotype, there are people who share some basic values. And I can’t help thinking that if these people could somehow work together, the world would be a very different place. What are these values? Treating others the way we’d like to be treated is a good start. But we can go beyond that. For example, I believe that in every country and every culture there are many people who would agree with this sentence:

''“'''Working with others, in a spirit of generosity and mutual respect, I want to help build a world where all people can lead free and dignified lives'''.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@AmiDar/idealists-of-the-world-unite-c84b69429086|title=Idealists of the world, unite!|last=Dar|first=Ami|date=2018-01-01|website=Ami Dar|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6628">'''Andrea Gibson''' (born August 13, 1975) is an American poet and activist from [[Calais, Maine]], who has lived in [[Boulder, Colorado]] since 1999. Gibson's poetry focuses on [[gender role|gender norms]], politics, social reform, and the struggles [[LGBTQ]] people face in today's society.

== Personal life ==

Gibson grew up in [[Calais, Maine]]. A child of Mark and Shirley Gibson, Gibson has one sister, Laura, who is mentioned in a poem "The Moon Is a Kite". Growing up in a Baptist home and attending local schools, Gibson later attended [[Saint Joseph's College of Maine]].

Moving with a girlfriend, Gibson lived for a time in New Orleans, and later the two moved in 1999 to [[Boulder, Colorado]], where they settled.  They went to their first open-mic in Denver, where Gibson was inspired to become a [[spoken word artist]].&lt;ref&gt;Peiken, Matt. "[http://metaphormag.com/people-gibson.htm Andrea Gibson isn't in it to win] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709141117/http://metaphormag.com/people-gibson.htm |date=July 9, 2007 }}", ''Metaphor Magazine'', April 30, 2007.  Accessed February 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson also goes by Andrew and uses gender-neutral pronouns. Many poems are about gender identity, such as "Swing Set" and "Andrew".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2d60ih/i_am_andrea_gibson_a_queer_touring_poet_with/cjmeofj "AMA with Andrea Gibson"], Reddit, 10 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson has said, regarding gender, "I don't necessarily identify within a gender binary. I've never in my life really felt like a woman and I've certainly never felt like a man. I look at gender on a spectrum and I feel somewhere on that spectrum that's not landing on either side of that."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/andrea-gibson/|title = The Pioneering Poet|journal = Interview Magazine|access-date = 2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poetry ==

A four-time Denver Grand Slam Champion, Gibson finished fourth at the 2004 [[National Poetry Slam]], and third at both the 2006 and 2007 [[Poetry Slam, Inc.|Individual World Poetry Slam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gotpoetry.com/News/article/sid=1640.html International Poetry Slam Final Results]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022203310/http://www.gotpoetry.com/News/article/sid%3D1640.html |date=October 22, 2008 }}. gotpoetry.com.

Gotpoetry.com. February 3, 2007. Retrieved on 2012-05-28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Gibson became the first poet ever to win the [http://www.wow.poetryslam.com/ Women of the World Poetry Slam] (WOWps) in [[Detroit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wow.poetryslam.com/ About the first WOWps slam; Detroit, Michigan, March 13–15 2008]. Wow.poetryslam.com. Retrieved on 2012-05-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Gibson published ''Pole Dancing To Gospel Hymns.''  Gibson has also self-published four books: ''Trees that Grow in Cemeteries'', ''Yellow Bird'', ''What the Yarn Knows of Sweaters,'' ''Pole Dancing to Gospel Hymns," and "Pansy".'' In 2011, [[Write Bloody Publishing]] published ''The Madness Vase,'' the sixth book attributed to Andrea Gibson.

The album ''Yellowbird'' incorporates music with the spoken word.  Gibson says the writing practice is to music, so it seemed natural to collaborate with a musician. This album was also an effort to write about risky topics that carried a threat. Confronting fear was a theme in poems of the following album, ''Flower Boy.'' Most recently, Gibson released ''Truce'' in 2013.

Gibson cites Sonya Renee, Derrick Brown, Anis Mojgani, Patricia Smith, and [[Mary Oliver]] as influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.eyeartcollective.com/i-am-always-in-the-process-of-becoming-andrea-gibson/|title = "I am always in the process of becoming": Andrea Gibson In Conversation With Eyezine {{!}} EYEZINE|website = EYEZINE|access-date = 2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the year, Gibson tours universities and other venues across the country.

== Activism ==

In addition to using poetry to provide social and political commentary on gender and LGBTQ issues, Gibson is involved with many activist groups, and also performs at [[Take Back the Night (organization)|Take Back the Night]] events, LGBTQ events, pride events, trans events, anti-war rallies, peace rallies, organizations against the occupation of Palestine, and groups focused on examining the wrongs of [[capitalism]], [[patriarchy]] and [[white supremacy]]. For twenty years, Gibson performed with [https://web.archive.org/web/20110728164747/http://voxfeminista.org/ Vox Feminista], a "performance tribe of radical feminists bent on social change through cultural revolution."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2013, alongside Kelsey Gibb, Gibson launched the website and support system, ''Stay Here With Me.'' The tumblr for Stay Here With Me presents it as "an interactive, safe space offering collective support while encouraging individual healing to keep those who visit alive today, and wanting to stay alive until tomorrow."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stayherewithus.tumblr.com/|title=stayherewithme|website=stayherewithus.tumblr.com|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cunanan's string of murders ended on July&amp;nbsp;23 with his suicide by firearm. He was 27&amp;nbsp;years old.

In his final years, Cunanan lived without a job, befriending wealthy older men&lt;ref name=Gibson138/&gt; and spending their money to impress acquaintances in the local gay community in [[Miami Beach, Florida]] by boasting about social events at clubs and often paying the check at restaurants.&lt;ref name="CT"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Dion |last1=Haynes |first2=Bob |last2=Secter |title=The many faces of Andrew Cunanan: 'He could win anyone over' |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-05-16/news/9705160213_1_andrew-cunanan-jeffrey-trail-artsy-crowd/2 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |publisher=[[Tronc]] |location=Chicago, Illinois |date=16 May 1997 |accessdate=30 April 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; One millionaire friend had broken up with Cunanan in 1996, the prior year.&lt;ref name=CT/&gt;

==Early life and education==
[[File:Andrew Phillip Cunanan FBI pictures.jpg|thumb|left|A collection of photos from the [[FBI]], showing the ease with which Cunanan could change his appearance]]

Andrew Phillip Cunanan was born August 31, 1969, in [[National City, California]], to Modesto "Pete" Cunanan, a [[Filipino American]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert W. |last=Welkom |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/19/entertainment/ca-33799 |title=Cunanan's father plans documentary on son's life |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tronc]] |location=Los Angeles, California |date=19 September 1997 |accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mary Anne Schillaci, an [[Italian American]], the youngest of four children. Modesto was serving in the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] in the [[Vietnam War]] at the time of his son's birth; after leaving the Navy, where he had served as a career officer, he worked as a stockbroker.&lt;ref name="WhoIsAndrew"&gt;{{cite news |magazine=Town and Country |url=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/a14442138/who-is-andrew-cunanan-gianni-versace-murderer/ |title=Who is Andrew Cunanan, the man who murdered Gianni Versace? |author=Vargas, Chanel |date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Cunanan's father enrolled him in the [[Independent school#United States|independent day school]], [[The Bishop's School (California)|The Bishop's School]] in the affluent [[La Jolla, California|La Jolla]] neighborhood of [[San Diego, California|San Diego]].&lt;ref name="WhoIsAndrew"/&gt; At school, Cunanan was remembered as being bright and very talkative, and testing with an [[Intelligence quotient|I.Q.]] of 142.&lt;ref name="Orth"&gt;{{cite book |last=Orth |first=Maureen |authorlink=Maureen Orth |title = Vulgar Favors |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=978-0-440-22585-0&amp;view=excerpt |year=2000 |publisher=[[Dell Publishing]] |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-440-22585-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, however, he developed a reputation as a prolific liar given to telling fantastic tales about his family and personal life. He was also adept at changing his appearance according to what he felt was most attractive at a given moment.&lt;ref name="WhoIsAndrew"/&gt; Nonetheless, in high school he was voted ‘Least Likely to be Forgotten’.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news |author=Kennedy, Helen |date=15 May 1997 |title=Double Life of the party boy: a dark side foretold years ago |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/double-life-party-boy-dark-side-foretold-years-article-1.759751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, when Andrew was 19, Modesto deserted his family and moved to the Philippines to evade arrest for [[embezzlement]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news |work=The Stranger |author=Zeeland, Steven |location=Seattle |date=23 July 1997 |title=Killer queen: Andrew Cunanan, my love rival |url=https://www.marksimpson.com/blog/2018/02/05/killer-queen-andrew-cunanan-love-rival/}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Cunanan – who identified as gay in high school and even then had liaisons with wealthy older men&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Potter, Matt"&gt;{{cite news |work=San Diego Reader |author=Potter, Matt |title=La Jolla gentlemen and the party boy: Andrew Cunanan – boy toy for socialites Norman Blachford and Lincoln Aston |date=22 May 1997 |url=https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/1997/may/22/cover-la-jolla-gentlemen-and-the-party-boy/}}&lt;/ref&gt; – had begun frequenting local gay clubs and restaurants, and his deeply religious mother Mary Anne learned that Cunanan was [[Homosexuality|gay]].

During an argument, Andrew threw his mother against a wall, [[Shoulder dislocation|dislocating her shoulder]]. Later examination of his behavior from reports indicates that he may have suffered from [[antisocial personality disorder]], a [[personality disorder]] characterized by an abnormal lack of [[remorse]].&lt;ref name="douglas"/&gt;

After graduating from high school in 1987, Cunanan enrolled at the [[University of California, San Diego]], where he majored in [[History of the United States|American History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/famous_criminal/6/biography/1/Andrew_Cunanan.htm |department=Famous Criminals |title=Andrew Cunanan |website=Crimeandinvestigation.co.uk |accessdate=13 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709185826/http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/famous_criminal/6/biography/1/Andrew_Cunanan.htm |archivedate=9 July 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After dropping out, two years later, he settled in the [[The Castro, San Francisco, California|Castro District]] of [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="WhoIsAndrew"/&gt;

==Adult life==
''Town and Country'' reported that in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], Cunanan – who also used the aliases Andrew DeSilva,&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite news |work=People|url=http://people.com/archive/one-good-man-vol-48-no-6/ |title=One Good Man |date=11 August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lt.&amp;nbsp;Cmdr.

In 1990, Cunanan first met [[Gianni Versace]], whom he would eventually kill outside his home on Miami Beach.&lt;ref name="WhoIsAndrew"/&gt; Versace was in town to be feted for the costumes he had designed for the opera ''Capriccio.''&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;{{cite news |magazine=Newsweek |url=http://www.newsweek.com/facing-death-174404 |author=Thomas, Evan |title=Facing death |date=27 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Cunanan and Norman Blachford broke up. Blachford was a wealthy older man who had been hosting and financially supporting him.

In late April&amp;nbsp;1997, Cunanan told friends he was leaving San Diego, beginning with a trip to Minneapolis to visit David Madson, 33, an up-and-coming architect and Cunanan's former lover and their mutual friend Jeff Trail, 28, a former US Navy officer&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; working as a district manager for a propane delivery company. Both had distanced themselves from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/assassination-gianni-versace-episode-5-fact-vs-fiction-806744 |magazine=Newsweek |title=Assassination of Gianni Versace, Episode&amp;nbsp;5, Fact vs. fiction: What ''American Crime Story'' got right |author=Menta, Anna |date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trail expected Cunanan to move to San Francisco upon leaving Minneapolis. A week before Cunanan killed him, Trail had told Williams that he had had a "''huge falling out''" with Cunanan and "''I made a lot of enemies this weekend ... I've got to get out of here. They're going to kill me''."&lt;ref name=thomas /&gt;

On April&amp;nbsp;24, Cunanan and four friends attended a going-away party at California Cuisine, a rare occasion when Cunanan did not cover the food tab. &lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; On April&amp;nbsp;25, Cunanan arrived in the Twin Cities and stayed at Madson's loft apartment.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Murders==
===Jeffrey Trail===
Cunanan's killing spree began in [[Minneapolis]] on 27&amp;nbsp;April 1997, with the murder of his close friend Jeffrey Trail, a former [[US Navy]] officer and [[propane]] salesman. Following an argument, Cunanan beat Trail to death with a [[claw hammer]] and left his body rolled in a rug in a [[loft#loft apartment|loft apartment]] belonging to architect David Madson.&lt;ref name=CT/&gt;

===David Madson===
Madson, who had once been Cunanan's lover, was his second murder victim; Madson's body was found on the east shore of Rush Lake near [[Rush City, Minnesota]], on 3&amp;nbsp;May 1997, with gunshot wounds to the head and back from a pistol Cunanan had taken from the home of his first victim, Jeff Trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amw.com/fugitives/case.cfm?id=55650 |title=America's Most Wanted': Andrew Cunanan |website=Amw.com |accessdate=13 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025161155/http://www.amw.com/fugitives/case.cfm?id=55650 |archivedate=25 October 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=William |last1=Recktenwald |first2=Andrew |last2=Martin |title=New Twist in Miglin Case |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-05-08/news/9705080105_1_andrew-phillip-cunanan-david-madson-minneapolis-architect |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=[[Chicago, Illinois]] |date=8 May 1997 |accessdate =8 October 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lee Miglin===
Cunanan next drove to [[Chicago]] and killed 72&amp;nbsp;year-old [[Lee Miglin]], a prominent real estate developer, on 4&amp;nbsp;May 1997. Cunanan bound Miglin's hands and feet and wrapped his head with duct tape. He then stabbed Miglin over 20&amp;nbsp;times with a screwdriver, and sawed open his throat with a [[hacksaw]].&lt;ref name="www.washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kastor |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Weeks |first2=Linton |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cunanan/stories/victims.htm |title=Five lives cut short |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |publisher=[[Jeff Bezos|Nash Holdings LLC]] |location=Washington, DC |date=17 July 1997 |accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this murder, Cunanan became the 449th fugitive to be listed on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list.

===William Reese===
{{anchor|William Reese}}
Five days later, Cunanan, who had taken Miglin's car, found his fourth victim in [[Pennsville Township, New Jersey|Pennsville]], [[New Jersey]], at [[Finn's Point National Cemetery]]. Cunanan shot and killed 45&amp;nbsp;year-old caretaker William Reese, then stole his red pickup truck.

While the manhunt unsuccessfully focused on Reese's stolen truck, which Cunanan still had, he "hid in plain sight" in [[Miami Beach, Florida]] for two&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Orth |first=Maureen |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1997/09/cunanan199709 |title=The Killer's Trail |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |location=New York City |date=September 1997 |accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cunanan even used his own name to pawn a stolen item, despite knowing that police routinely review [[pawn shop]] records.&lt;ref name="Versace's Killer Kills Self"&gt;{{cite web |last=Phillips |first=Andrew |url=https://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/versaces-killer-kills-self/ |title=Versace's killer kills self |website=[[Maclean's]] |publisher=[[Rogers Media]] |location=[[Toronto, Ontario]] |date=4 August 1997 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630201120/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=M1ARTM0011375 |archive-date=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gianni Versace===
On 15&amp;nbsp;July 1997, Cunanan murdered Italian fashion designer [[Gianni Versace]], by shooting him twice on the front stairway of his Miami Beach mansion [[Casa Casuarina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lecayo |first=Richard |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,138062,00.html |title=Tagged for Murder |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]] |location=New York City |date=21 June 2001 |accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A witness attempted to pursue Cunanan, but was unable to catch up to him.

Responding police found Reese's stolen vehicle parked in a nearby [[parking garage|garage]], loaded with Cunanan's clothes, an alternative passport, and clipped newspaper reports of Cunanan's murders.&lt;ref name="douglas"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Danielle |last1=Esposito |first2=John E. |last2=Douglas |first3=Ann W. |last3=Burgess |first4=Allen G. |last4=Burgess |editor1-first=John E. |editor1-last=Douglas |editor2-first=Ann W. |editor2-last=Burgess |editor3-first=Allen G. |editor3-last=Burgess |title=Crime Classification Manual: A standard system for investigating and classifying violent crimes |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DIc9F5ZzO7YC&amp;dq=andrew+cunanan+spree+killer+FBI |accessdate=10 April 2011 |edition=2nd |year=2006 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-7879-8501-1 |pages=448–452 |chapter=Case Study: Andrew Cunanan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In the upstairs bedroom of a [[Miami Beach]] [[houseboat]] on 23&amp;nbsp;July 1997, eight days after killing Versace and with law enforcement hot on his trail, Cunanan killed himself with a gunshot through the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Vulture.com |date=21 March 2018 |title=''The Assassination of Gianni Versace'': Fact-checking the season finale, ''Alone'' |last=Herzog |first=Kenny |url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/03/ace-versace-fact-check-episode-9-finale.html |accessdate=25 April 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cunanan used a [[.40 S&amp;W]] [[caliber]] [[Taurus PT92|Taurus PT100]] [[semi-automatic pistol]] which he had stolen from Jeff Trail, the first of his five victims, committing suicide with the same gun he used to kill Madson, Reese, and Versace.&lt;ref name="douglas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Versace's Killer Kills Self"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/25/us/suspect-s-suicide-brings-relief-and-normality.html |title=Suspect's suicide brings relief and normality |last=Janofsky |first=Michael |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=The New York Times Publishing Company |location=New York City |date=25 July 1997 |accessdate=4 August 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motive==
Cunanan's motivation remains unknown.

Although police searched the houseboat where Cunanan died, he left no suicide note and few personal belongings,&lt;ref name=Gibson138&gt;{{cite book |first=Dirk Cameron |last=Gibson |title=Serial Murder and Media Circuses |location= |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2006 |page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; surprising investigators, given his reputation for acquiring money and expensive possessions from wealthy older men.&lt;ref name=Gibson138/&gt;

'''Augustine Phillips''' (died May 1605) was an [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan]] [[actor]] who performed in troupes with [[Edward Alleyn]] and [[William Shakespeare]]. He was one of the first generation of English actors to achieve wealth and a degree of social status by means of his trade.

Phillips first enters the historical record as a member of the amalgamation of [[Lord Strange's Men]] and the [[Admiral's Men]] that performed ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins (play)|The Seven Deadly Sins]]'' (perhaps by [[Richard Tarlton]]) between 1590 and 1592. In the surviving "plot" of this performance, Phillips is assigned the role of [[Sardanapalus]]; he is one of the few actors not required to play a double role. He is named in the touring warrant issued to Strange's Men in 1592; after the death of their patron [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby|Ferdinando Stanley]] he joined the new [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], presumably as a sharer.

Phillips remained with the company through its change to the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] and to his death in 1605. Little is known with certainty of his roles with the company, except that he was probably already mature when the company assembled. He appears in the cast lists for [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' (1598), ''[[Every Man Out of His Humour]]'' (1599), and ''[[Sejanus]]'' (1603). He may be the author of a jig, ''Phillips His Slipper'', entered for publishing in the [[Stationers' Register]] in 1595.

He was one of the six sharers in the [[Globe Theatre]] when it was built in 1598&amp;ndash;9, with a one-eighth share. Over time this made him a comparatively wealthy man, at least as far as Elizabethan actors were concerned. Like Shakespeare, Phillips lived for many years near his occupation in [[Southwark]], in Paris Garden near the [[The Swan (theatre)|Swan Theatre]], and in [[Aldgate]]; but by the time of his death he owned a house in [[Mortlake]], in [[Surrey]].

In 1601, he was the representative of the company called to testify before the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] about their involvement with the rebellion of the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]; the Chamberlain's Men had been paid by supporters of the Earl to perform Shakespeare's ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' before the abortive coup. Phillips' testimony seems to have assuaged whatever anger the court may have felt towards the players; they were not punished, and indeed played for [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] at [[Whitehall Palace|Whitehall]] on 24 February 1601, the night before Essex was executed. (The choice of Phillips as representative is interesting; why him, and not Shakespeare or Burbage? He testified that the Lord Chamberlain's Men had played at the request of Essex's supporters, specifically because they were offered 40 shillings more than their normal fee. This might indicate that Phillips had a role in keeping the financial accounts of the company.)

The evidence suggests a life deeply intertwined with the theater. He was a stepbrother of his fellow King's Man [[Thomas Pope (16th-century actor)|Thomas Pope]], and his sister married another actor, [[Robert Gough (actor)|Robert Gough]].

Phillips's daughters Magdalen and Rebecca were baptized in the parish of St. Saviour's in [[Southwark]] in 1594 and 1596 respectively. A son, Augustine or Austen, was baptized there in 1601 but buried three years later. Phillips's will, which was signed on 4 May 1605 and probated on 13 May 1605, mentions two other daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, and his wife Anne, plus brothers, sisters, and other relations of a large family. The will includes a number of interesting and revealing bequests:

* a silver bowl worth £5 to each of the executors, [[John Heminges]], [[Richard Burbage]], and [[William Sly]];
* a 30-shilling gold piece each to [[Shakespeare]], [[Henry Condell]], and [[Christopher Beeston]] (Beeston is described as Phillips's "servant;" he was almost certainly a former apprentice);
* 20 shillings in gold each to [[Lawrence Fletcher]], [[Robert Armin]], [[Alexander Cooke]], [[Richard Cowley]], and [[Nicholas Tooley]];
* 40s. to his apprentice James Sands, along with a [[cittern]], a [[bandora (instrument)|bandora]], and a [[lute]], all pending the "expiration of his term of years in his indenture of apprenticehood;"
* 40s. to his "late apprentice" Samuel Gilburne, plus Phillips's "mouse-colored" velvet hose, his black taffeta suit and white taffeta doublet, his purple cloak, his sword and dagger, and his bass [[viol]];
* and £5 to be split among the hired men "of the company which I am of."

The musical instruments obviously imply that Phillips was a musician, and as such he was probably involved in the dramatic music used in productions throughout his career.

'''Barrie Karp''' (born 1945 in [[Laredo, Texas]]) is an artist, [[independent scholar]] and academic. Karp grew up first in [[Scranton]] and [[Wilkes-Barre]] and then, in the later part of her childhood,  in [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania]] and the surrounding [[Lycoming County]] area. She has been an educator in philosophy, cultural studies, humanities and arts from a feminist and anti-racist perspective in New York City colleges and universities since 1970. Karp's practice has largely been as an educator whose pedagogy and practice sought to further define a rigorous mode of inquiry in feminist and anti-racist studies. Karp envisions feminism as a movement that can work across disciplinary boundaries and be informed by various traditions of inquiry. Her work has been informed by her lifelong study of psychoanalysis.  Paintings of Karp's appeared in the November/December 2008 issue of ''[[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]]'' magazine and by the ''Tikkun'' editor's August 2009 online blog and in the spring 2012 issue of ''On the Issues'' Magazine. In 1988, she had a one-person exhibition at the [[Everhart Museum]] in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

==Academic career and art studies==
After studying painting and liberal arts at [[Chatham University|Chatham College]]  from 1962 through 1964, Karp transferred to [[Columbia University]], where she earned a B.S. in 1967 in the Philosophy Department. She has been an educator in philosophy, cultural studies, humanities and arts from a feminist and anti-racist perspective in New York City colleges and universities since 1970.&lt;ref name="bjlove"&gt;Barbara J. Love, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kpNarH7t9CkC&amp;pg=244 Feminists Who Changed America 1963-1975]'', "Barrie Karp" brief biography, pp. 244-245. {{ISBN|0-252-03189-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; She taught the first feminist philosophy course at Hunter College in 1978; and she filed an unsuccessful discrimination case against [[City College of New York|City College]] over her complaints to the affirmative action office about a "current and historical lack of female Philosophy Department faculty members at CCNY."&lt;ref name="bjlove" /&gt;

She completed a doctorate (1979) in the Philosophy Department at [[CUNY Graduate Center]].&lt;ref name="bjlove" /&gt; Her doctoral dissertation was titled "Persons and Self-Deception".&lt;ref name="sbio"&gt;[http://www.saatchionline.com/profile/32517 Saatchi Online Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1982, she has been on the faculty of [[The New School]] and the [[School of Visual Arts]] (Humanities and Sciences Department,  Philosophy and Cultural Studies tracks). Since 1988, she has been a faculty member of Eugene Lang College [[The New School]] for Liberal Arts at Eugene Lang College.

Karp began art studies with [[Maria Lowenstein]] (1954 to 1959) and [[Ian James (artist)|Ian James]], 1962. After her Chatham College studies she also studied art at [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown Workshop]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20130527053852/http://www.acmefineart.com/bio-manso.htm Leo Manso], Victor Candell, summer 1964) and [[New York University]] (Leo Manso, fall 1964, spring 1965).&lt;ref name="sbio" /&gt; After completing her PhD she studied at the [[New School for Social Research]] (Leo Manso, early 1980s); with the Art Students League (Leo Manso, Rudolf Baranik, 1981-1983); and at the [[Provincetown Art Association]] Museum School (Selena Trieff, 1983).&lt;ref name="sbio" /&gt;

She is currently working on making photography, archiving ancestral photos, and writing about family photography, self-portraiture, portraiture and other kinds of photography.

==Activism on Karp's behalf==
In Spring 2008, Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts students conducted peaceful protests, including a conversation with faculty at a Lang College faculty meeting and at other meetings with faculty, administrators, and students; and demonstrating in the college's courtyard and student publications in the Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts paper, “New School Free Press”, sometimes also known as ''IMPRINT''.  Students created a public support group on Facebook that they titled [https://www.facebook.com/groups/9547869218/ Lang Needs Barrie!!!] where they put their writings and other materials related to the case. This public support group still existed as of 2016.  In an article by Kevin Dugan in the April 1, 2008 issue of the ''New School Free Press'''', a Lang senior, Jamila Thompson, was quoted as saying, "If it can happen to Barrie, it can happen to anybody....our voices are not valued." According to then-Lang student Anna Bean, in an opinion piece published in the April 15, 2008, ''New School Free Press,'' stated that 120 students, faculty, and alumni of Lang have signed the petition urging the administration to reconsider the decision" to not renew Karp's contract. In an April 29, 2008 letter to the editor in the ''New School Free Press'', Lang alumna Michelle Salerno described Karp as "the finest professor I ever had" and lauded Karp's "breadth of knowledge on feminism, critical race studies, philosophy and the arts". The Karp case continued to receive wide attention in the ensuing years. In an article in ''Harper''’s Magazine, October 2010, [[Susan Faludi]] wrote “Soon after the culture and media department absorbed and then dissolved the gender-studies program, Karp was forced out. Not that her expulsion made way for an undated feminist studies. With her departure, the number of professors in the department dedicated to teaching feminism dropped to zero.&lt;ref&gt;[Susan Faludi. 2010. “American Electra—Feminism’s ritual matricide,” Essay By Susan Faludi.  Harper’s Magazine/ October 2010, P. 42]&lt;/ref&gt;"

'''Burl Icle Ivanhoe Ives''' (June 14, 1909 – April 14, 1995) was an American singer and actor of stage, screen, radio and television.

He began as an itinerant singer and banjoist, and launched his own radio show, ''The Wayfaring Stranger'', which popularized traditional folk songs. In 1942 he appeared in [[Irving Berlin]]'s ''[[This Is the Army]]'', and then became a major star of CBS radio. 
In the 1960s he successfully crossed over into [[country music]], recording hits such as "A Little Bitty Tear" and "Funny Way of Laughing". A popular film actor through the late 1940s and '50s, Ives's best-known roles in that medium included parts in ''[[So Dear to My Heart]]'' (1949) and ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958 film)|Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' (1958), as well as Rufus Hannassey in ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), for which he won an [[31st Academy Awards|Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].

Ives is often remembered for his voice-over work as Sam the Snowman, narrator of the classic 1964 Christmas television special ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'', which continues to air annually around Christmas.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Ives was born near [[Hunt City, Illinois|Hunt City]], an unincorporated town in [[Jasper County, Illinois]], near [[Newton, Illinois|Newton]], to Levi "Frank" Ives (1880–1947) and Cordelia "Dellie" (née White) (1882–1954). He had six siblings: Audry, Artie, Clarence, Argola, Lillburn, and Norma. His father was first a farmer and then a contractor for the county and others. One day, Ives was singing in the garden with his mother, and his uncle overheard them. He invited his nephew to sing at the old soldiers' reunion in Hunt City. The boy performed a rendition of the folk ballad "[[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen]]" and impressed both his uncle and the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Burl Ives (1948). ''Wayfaring Stranger''. New York: Whittlesey House, pp. 15–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1927 to 1929, Ives attended Eastern Illinois State Teachers College (now [[Eastern Illinois University]]) in [[Charleston, Illinois]], where he played football.&lt;ref&gt;Betsy Cole, "Eastern Mourns Burl Ives", ''Daily Eastern News'', April 17, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; During his junior year, he was sitting in English class, listening to a lecture on ''[[Beowulf]],'' when he suddenly realized he was wasting his time. As he walked out of the door, the professor made a snide remark, and Ives slammed the door behind him, shattering the window in the door.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, ''Wayfaring Stranger'' pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty years later, the school named a building after its most famous dropout.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "Eastern Illinois University Honors Famed Dropout Burl Ives," ''St. Louis Post Dispatch'', May 3, 1990, p. 71. Accessed via NewsBank.&lt;/ref&gt; Burl Ives was a member of Charleston Chapter of the Order of Demolay and is listed in the DeMolay Hall of Fame. Ives was also initiated into [[ Scottish Rite Freemasonry]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140328141228/http://scottishrite.org/headquarters/virtual-tour/burl-ives-museum/ Burl Ives Museum] ''Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite''.&lt;/ref&gt; He was elevated to the 33rd and highest degree&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stjohnslodgedc.org/famous-masons | title = Famous Freemasons in the course of history | language = en | website = St. John Lodge No 11 F.A.A.M. | access-date = Sep 30, 2018 | quotation = Magnolia Lodge (now Magnolia-La Cumbre Lodge) No. 242 in Santa Barbara, California.

On July 23, 1929, in [[Richmond, Indiana]], Ives made a trial recording of "Behind the Clouds" for the Starr Piano Company's [[Gennett Records|Gennett]] label, but the recording was rejected and destroyed a few weeks later. In later years Ives did not recall having made the record.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Russell, ''Country Music Records: A Discography, 1921–1942'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 17, 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s–1940s===
Ives traveled about the U.S. as an itinerant singer during the early 1930s, earning his way by doing odd jobs and playing his [[banjo]]. He was jailed in [[Mona, Utah]], for [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] and for singing "[[Foggy Dew (English song)|Foggy Dew]]", which the authorities decided was a [[bawdy song]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wayfaring Stranger'' pp. 129–132.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1931, he began performing on WBOW radio in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]]. He also went back to school, attending classes at Indiana State Teachers College (now [[Indiana State University]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Wayfaring Stranger'' p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, Ives also attended the [[Juilliard School]] in New York. He made his Broadway debut in 1938 with a small role in Rodgers and Hart's hit musical, ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]''. In 1939, he joined his friend and fellow actor [[Eddie Albert]], who had the starring role in ''The Boys from Syracuse'', in Los Angeles. The two shared an apartment for a while in the Beachwood Canyon community of Hollywood.

In 1940, Ives named his own radio show ''The Wayfaring Stranger'' after one of his ballads. Over the next decade, he popularized several traditional folk songs, such as "[[Foggy Dew (English song)|Foggy Dew]]" (an English folk song), "[[The Blue Tail Fly]]" (an old [[Blackface minstrelsy|minstrel]] tune now better known as "Jimmy Crack Corn"), and "[[Big Rock Candy Mountain]]" (an old [[hobo]] song). He was also associated with the [[Almanac Singers]] (Almanacs), a folk-singing group which at different times included [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Will Geer]], [[Millard Lampell]], and [[Pete Seeger]]. The Almanacs were active in the [[American Peace Mobilization]] (APM), an antiwar group opposed to American entry into [[World War II]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s pro-Allied policies. They recorded such songs as "Get Out and Stay Out of War" and "Franklin, Oh Franklin".&lt;ref&gt;'Dupes: How America's Adversaries Have Manipulated Progressives for a Century' by Paul Kengor (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1941, after the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]], the APM reorganized itself into the pro-war [[American People's Mobilization]]. Ives and the Almanacs rerecorded several of their songs to reflect the group's new stance in favor of US entry into the war. Among them were "Dear Mr. President" and "Reuben James" (the name of a [[USS Reuben James (DD-245)|US destroyer sunk by the Germans]] before US entry into the war).

In early 1942, Ives was drafted into the [[U.S. Army]]. He spent time first at [[Camp Dix]], then at [[Camp Upton]], where he joined the cast of [[Irving Berlin]]'s ''[[This Is the Army]].'' He attained the rank of corporal.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} When the show went to Hollywood, he was transferred to the [[Army Air Force]]. He was discharged honorably, apparently for medical reasons, in September 1943. Between September and December 1943, Ives lived in California with actor [[Harry Morgan]] (who would later go on to play Officer Bill Gannon in the 1960s version of [[Jack Webb]]'s TV show ''[[Dragnet (franchise)|Dragnet]]'', and [[Colonel Sherman T. Potter]] on ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''). In December 1943, Ives went to [[New York City|New York]] to work for CBS radio for $100 a week.&lt;ref&gt;"Testimony of Burl Icle Ives, New York, N.Y. [on May 20, 1952]," ''Hearings before the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, Eighty-Second Congress, Second Session on Subversive Infiltration of Radio, Television, and the Entertainment Industry''. Washington, D.C.: GPO, 1952. Part 2, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, he recorded ''The Lonesome Train'', a ballad about the life and death of [[Abraham Lincoln]], written by [[Earl Robinson]] (music) and Lampell (lyrics).

On December 6, 1945, Ives married 29-year-old script writer Helen Peck Ehrlich.&lt;ref&gt;"Burl Ives Weds Script Writer," ''The New York Times'', December 8, 1945, p. 24. Accessed via ProQuest Historical Newspapers.&lt;/ref&gt; Their son Alexander was born in 1949.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In 1946, Ives was cast as a singing cowboy in the film ''[[Smoky (1946 film)|Smoky]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitcomsonline.com/photopost/showphoto.php/photo/43959 Burl Ives Biography], ''Sitcoms Online''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Ives recorded one of many versions of "[[The Blue Tail Fly]]", but paired this time with the popular [[Andrews Sisters]] (Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne). The flip side of the record was a fast-paced "I'm Goin' Down the Road". Ives hoped the trio's success would help the record sell well, and indeed it did, becoming both a best-selling disc and a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' hit.&lt;ref&gt;Sforza, John: ''Swing It! The Andrews Sisters Story''; University Press of Kentucky, 2000; 289 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

His version of the 17th-century English song "[[Lavender Blue]]" became his first hit and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for its use in the 1949 film ''[[So Dear to My Heart]]''.

Music critic [[John Rockwell]] said, "Ives' voice ... had the sheen and finesse of opera without its latter-day [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccinian]] vulgarities and without the pretensions of operatic ritual. It was genteel in expressive impact without being genteel in social conformity. And it moved people".&lt;ref&gt;John Rockwell, quoted in book review of ''Outsider, John Rockwell on the Arts, 1967–2006'', by John Rockwell, ''[[The New York Times]]'' Book Review, December 24, 2006, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ives was identified in the 1950 pamphlet ''[[Red Channels]]'' and [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] as an entertainer with supposed Communist ties.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Murray, ''Encyclopedia of Television News'', Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1998. p 18. Accessed via Ebrary&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, he cooperated with the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) and agreed to testify, fearful of losing his source of income. Ives' statement to the HUAC ended his blacklisting, allowing him to continue acting in movies, but it also led to a bitter rift between Ives and many folk singers, including [[Pete Seeger]], who accused Ives of naming names and betraying the cause of cultural and political freedom to save his own career. Forty-one years later, Ives, by then confined to a wheelchair, reunited with Seeger during a benefit concert in New York City, having reconciled years earlier. They sang "Blue Tail Fly" together.&lt;ref&gt;Dean Kahn, "Ives-Seeger Rift Finally Ended with 'Blue-Tail Fly' Harmony: Skagitonians Ives, Murros Were on Opposite Sides," ''Knight Ridder Tribune Business News'' [from ''Bellingham Herald'', Washington], March 19, 2006, p. 1.

Ives expanded his appearances in films during this decade. His movie credits include the role of Sam the Sheriff of Salinas, California, in ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'', Big Daddy in ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958 film)|Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'', roles in ''[[Desire Under the Elms (film)|Desire Under the Elms]]'', ''[[Wind Across the Everglades]]'', ''[[The Big Country]]'', for which he won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], ''[[Ensign Pulver]]'', the sequel to ''[[Mister Roberts (1955 film)|Mister Roberts]]'', and ''[[Our Man in Havana]]'', based on the [[Graham Greene]] novel.

===1960s–1990s===
In the 1960s, Ives began singing [[country music]] with greater frequency. In 1962, he released three songs that were popular with both country music and popular music fans: "[[A Little Bitty Tear]]", "Call Me Mister In-Between", and "Funny Way of Laughing".

Ives had several film and television roles during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1962, he starred with [[Rock Hudson]] in ''[[The Spiral Road]],'' which was based on a novel of the same name by [[Jan de Hartog]]. He also starred in Disney's ''[[Summer Magic]]'' with [[Hayley Mills]], [[Dorothy McGuire]], and [[Eddie Hodges]], and a score by [[Robert B. Sherman|Robert]] and [[Richard M. Sherman|Richard Sherman]]. In 1964, he played the genie in the movie ''[[The Brass Bottle (1964 film)|The Brass Bottle]]'' with [[Tony Randall]] and [[Barbara Eden]].

Ives' "[[A Holly Jolly Christmas]]" and "Silver and Gold" became Christmas standards after they were first featured in the 1964 NBC-TV presentation of the [[Rankin/Bass]] stop-motion animated family special [[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|''Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'']]. Johnny Marks had composed the title song (originally an enormous hit for singing cowboy [[Gene Autry]]) in 1949, and producers Rankin and Bass retained him to compose the TV special's soundtrack. Ives voiced Sam the Snowman, the banjo-playing "host" and narrator of the story, explaining how Rudolph used his "nonconformity", as Sam refers to it, to save Christmas from being cancelled due to an impassable blizzard. The following year, Ives rerecorded all three of the Johnny Marks hits which he had sung in the TV special, but with a more "pop" feel. He released them all as singles for the 1965 holiday season, capitalizing on their previous success.

Ives performed in other television productions, including ''[[Pinocchio (1968 film)|Pinocchio]]'' and ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]].'' He starred in two television series: ''O.K. Crackerby!'' (1965–66), which costarred Hal Buckley, Joel Davison, and [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]], and ''[[The Bold Ones: The Lawyers]]'' (1969–72). ''O.K. Crackerby!,'' which was about the presumed richest man in the world, replaced [[Walter Brennan]]'s somewhat similar ''[[The Tycoon (TV series)|The Tycoon]]'' on the ABC schedule from the preceding year. Ives occasionally starred in macabre-themed productions. In 1970, for example, he played the title role in ''The Man Who Wanted to Live Forever,'' in which his character attempts to harvest human organs from unwilling donors. In 1972, he appeared as old man Doubleday in the episode "The Other Way Out" of Rod Serling's ''[[Night Gallery]],'' in which his character seeks a gruesome revenge for the murder of his granddaughter.

Ives and Helen Peck Ehrlich were [[divorce]]d in February 1971.&lt;ref&gt;"Burl Ives Divorced", ''New York Times,'' February 19, 1971, p. 27. Accessed via ProQuest Historical Newspapers&lt;/ref&gt; Ives then married Dorothy Koster Paul in London two months later.&lt;ref&gt;UPI, "Burl Ives Weds", ''Evening Sentinel,'' Holland, Michigan, April 17, 1971, p. 3. Accessed via Access NewspaperARCHIVE&lt;/ref&gt; In their later years, Ives and Dorothy lived in a waterfront home in [[Anacortes, Washington]], in the [[Puget Sound]] area, and in [[Galisteo, New Mexico]], on the Turquoise Trail. In the 1960s, he had another home just south of [[Hope Town]] on [[Elbow Cay]], a barrier island of the [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]]s in the [[Bahamas]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

In honor of Ives' influence on American vocal music, on October 25, 1975, he was awarded the [[University of Pennsylvania Glee Club]] Award of Merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dolphin.upenn.edu/gleeclub/MEMBERS_merit.html |title = The University of Pennsylvania Glee Club Award of Merit Recipients |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120209191432/http://www.dolphin.upenn.edu/gleeclub/MEMBERS_merit.html |archivedate = February 9, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This award, initiated in 1964, was "established to bring a declaration of appreciation to an individual each year who has made a significant contribution to the world of music and helped to create a climate in which our talents may find valid expression."

When [[America Sings]] opened at [[Disneyland]] in 1974, Ives voiced the main host, Sam Eagle, an [[Audio-Animatronics|Audio-Animatronic]].

Ives lent his name and image to the U.S. [[Bureau of Land Management]]'s "This Land Is Your Land – Keep It Clean" campaign in the 1970s. He was portrayed with the program's fictional spokesman, [[Johnny Horizon]].

Burl Ives was seen regularly in television commercials for [[Luzianne]] tea for several years during the 1970s and 1980s, when he was the company's commercial spokesman.

In 1989, Ives officially announced his retirement from show business on his 80th birthday. However, he continued to do occasional benefit concert performances on his own accord until 1993.

===Death===
Ives was a pipe smoker. (The cover of his first album showed a pipe and a [[fishing hat]] with the words "Burl Ives" in between.) He also smoked cigars. In the summer of 1994, he was diagnosed with [[oral cancer]]. After several unsuccessful operations, he decided against further surgery. He fell into a [[coma]] and died from the disease on April 14, 1995, at the age of 85, at his home in [[Anacortes, Washington|Anacortes]], Washington.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/15/obituaries/burl-ives-the-folk-singer-whose-imposing-acting-won-an-oscar-dies-at-85.html The New York Times Ives obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in Mound Cemetery in [[Hunt City Township, Jasper County, Illinois|Hunt City Township]], [[Jasper County, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Severo, "Burl Ives, the Folk Singer Whose Imposing Acting Won an Oscar, Dies at 85", ''The New York Times'', April 15, 1995, p. 10.

Hill]] in Virginia, where he shared the stage with the [[Oak Ridge Boys]].&lt;ref&gt;John C.

'''Catherine Wolfe Bruce''' (January 22, 1816, New York – March 13, 1900, New York) was a noted American philanthropist and patroness of astronomy.&lt;ref name="Americana1909"&gt;{{cite book|title=Americana {{!}} American Historical Magazine {{!}} Vol. IV|date=1909|publisher=The National American Society|isbn=9780881924367|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QcdAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA308&amp;lpg=PA308|accessdate=2 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Bruce was born on January 22, 1816. She was the daughter of the [[George Bruce (Design patent)|George Bruce]] (1781–1866), a famous type founder who was born in [[Edinburgh]], and Catherine Wolfe (1785–1861), the daughter of David Wolfe (1748–1836) of New York City. Her brother was [[David Wolfe Bruce]] (1824–1895), who, along with [[Cortlandt F. Bishop|David Wolfe Bishop]], inherited the fortune of their cousin, Catharine Lorillard Wolfe.&lt;ref name="1895DWB"&gt;{{cite news|title=DAVID W.

==Career==
[[File:Astrograph in Heidelberg-Königstuhl-2.jpg|thumb|Bruce double [[astrograph]] at the [[Heidelberg Observatory]] in Germany]]
She studied painting, learned Latin, German, French and Italian, and was familiar with the literature of those languages.&lt;ref name="Observatory1900"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Observatory, Vol. 23,|date=June 1900|publisher=[[NASA Astrophysics Data System]]|pages=246–247|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1900Obs....23..246.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
[[Image:NYFCL George Bruce Branch.jpg|thumb|right|The original George Bruce Library on [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]], 1888]]
In 1877, she donated $50,000 for the construction of a library building and the purchase of books in memory of her father. The library, known as "[[New York Free Circulating Library|The George Bruce Library]]" was completed in 1888 and was located at 226 West 42nd Street and designed by [[George Edward Harney|G. E. Harney]]. The building was sold in 1913 and the proceeds were used to build the current George Bruce library located on 125th Street in Harlem and designed by [[Carrère &amp; Hastings]].&lt;ref name="Noonan2009"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Noonan|first1=Theresa C.|title=New York Public Library George Bruce Branch|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/NYPL_GeoBrucedesigrep.pdf|website=nyc.gov|publisher=Landmarks Preservation Commission|accessdate=2 June 2017|date=January 13, 2009|quote=Landmark Site: Borough of Manhattan Tax Map Block 1980, Lot 22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218072225/http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/NYPL_GeoBrucedesigrep.pdf#|archive-date=2017-02-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Sulkowicz is the child of Sandra Leong and [[Kerry Sulkowicz]], both psychiatrists from [[Manhattan]], and is of Chinese, Japanese and Jewish descent.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Sulkowicz attended [[Dalton School]] on the [[Upper East Side]], where they were an A student and competitive [[Fencing|fencer]], and [[Columbia University]], where they obtained a degree in visual arts in 2015.&lt;ref name="Grigoriadis2014"&gt;Vanessa Grigoriadis, [http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/09/emma-sulkowicz-campus-sexual-assault-activism.html "Meet the College Women Who Are Starting a Revolution Against Campus Sexual Assault"], ''New York Magazine'', 21 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Sulkowicz is [[Genderqueer|non-binary]] and uses [[Singular they|they/them]] pronouns.&lt;ref name="Tolentino2018"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/is-there-a-smarter-way-to-think-about-sexual-assault-on-campus|title=Is There a Smarter Way to Think About Sexual Assault on Campus?|last=Tolentino|first=Jia|date=2018-02-05|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rape allegation==
{{main article|Columbia University rape controversy}}
In April 2013, Sulkowicz, then in the fourth year of their degree, filed a complaint with Columbia requesting the expulsion of fellow fourth-year student and German national, Paul Nungesser, alleging he had raped them in Sulkowicz's [[dorm room]] on August 27, 2012.&lt;ref name="Chapman2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia student says he didn't rape Emma Sulkowicz|last=Chapman|first=Isabelle|work=AOL.com|date=February 3, 2015|accessdate=May 29, 2016|url=http://www.aol.com/article/2015/02/03/columbia-student-says-he-didnt-rape-emma-sulkowicz/21138562/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nungesser was found 'not responsible' by a university inquiry. In May 2014, Sulkowicz filed a report against Nungesser with the [[New York Police Department]] (NYPD), which did not pursue charges.&lt;ref name="Shapiro2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/07/13/columbia-university-settles-title-ix-lawsuit-with-former-student-involving-mattress-girl-case/|title=Columbia University settles Title IX lawsuit with former student involving ‘mattress girl’ case|last=Shapiro|first=T.

The performance and the allegations received considerable media attention, with Sulkowicz becoming known as "Mattress Girl".
 
In April 2015, Nungesser filed a Title IX gender discrimination lawsuit against Columbia, its board of trustees, its president [[Lee Bollinger]], and Sulkowicz's supervising art professor [[Jon Kessler]], alleging their negligence in preventing him from being harassed.&lt;ref name="Kutner2015"/&gt; In the complaint, Nungesser stated Sulkowicz's allegation of rape was false, citing as evidence Sulkowicz's counterintuitive behavior, such as friendly texts Sulkowicz sent Nungesser days after the alleged attack occurred.&lt;ref name="Young2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/03/columbia-student-i-didn-t-rape-her.html|title=Columbia Student: I Didn't Rape Her|publisher=The Daily Beast|date=February 3, 2015|accessdate=May 29, 2016|author=Young, Cathy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint argued Sulkowicz's allegation was made in response to unreciprocated desire for a serious relationship, therefore allowing the performance was harassment and a violation of his student rights.  When questioned about the lawsuit, Sulkowicz said that it was "full of lies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/paul-nungesser-lawsuit-columbia-sulkowicz-452241|title=Paul Nungesser’s lawsuit against Columbia over Emma Sulkowicz’s "mattress protest" returns to court|date=2016-04-25|work=Newsweek|access-date=2017-08-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal District Court Judge [[Gregory H.

{{main article|Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)}}
[[File:Emma Sulkowicz, Mattress Performance, 19 May 2015 (cropped).JPG|thumb|Sulkowicz (center right) carrying the mattress at graduation]]
Sulkowicz created ''[[Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)]]'' in the summer of 2014 for their [[senior thesis]] while at [[Yale University]] Summer School of Art and Music. This performance artwork was in protest against [[campus sexual assault]] and the university's handling of Sulkowicz's [[Columbia University rape controversy|allegation that a fellow student at Columbia University anally raped them]].&lt;ref name="Smith2014NYT"/&gt; The university cleared the student of responsibility,&lt;ref name="Gambino2015"/&gt; and the district attorney's office declined to pursue criminal charges, citing lack of [[reasonable suspicion]].&lt;ref name="Bogler2014"&gt;{{cite news|author=Emma Bogler|title=Frustrated by Columbia’s inaction, student reports sexual assault to police|url=http://columbiaspectator.com/news/2014/05/16/frustrated-columbias-inaction-student-reports-sexual-assault-police|work=Columbia Spectator|date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kutner2015"/&gt;

Their first effort was a [[Video art|video]] of them dismantling a bed, accompanied by the audio of them filing the police report, which they had recorded on their cellphone.&lt;ref name="Smith2014vid"/&gt; The mattress later became the sole focus of the piece.&lt;ref name="Smith2014NYT"/&gt; Sulkowicz told [[New York Magazine|''New York'' magazine]]:

{{quote|I thought about how&amp;nbsp;... the mattress represents a private place where a lot of your intimate life happens; and how I have brought my life out in front for the public to see; and the act of bringing something private and intimate out into the public mirrors the way my life has been. Also the mattress as a burden, because of what has happened there, that has turned my own relationship with my bed into something fraught.&lt;ref name="VanSyckle2014"/&gt;}}

The {{convert|50|lb|abbr=out|adj=on}}, dark-blue, extra-long [[Twin bed|twin]] mattress used in the performance art piece is of the kind Columbia places in its dorms, similar to the one on which they allege they were raped. Sulkowicz spent the summer of 2014 creating the rules of engagement: written on the walls of their studio in the university's Watson Hall, these stated that they must carry the mattress whenever they were on university property; that it must remain on campus even when Sulkowicz was not there; and that they were not allowed to ask for help in carrying it, but if help was offered they may accept it.&lt;ref name="Smith2014vid"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Watson Hall, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9hHZbuYVnU Sulkowicz, September 2, 2014], from c. 2:00 mins.&lt;/ref&gt; In September that year they began carrying it on campus, which they said was a physically painful experience.&lt;ref&gt;Duan, Noel (September 9, 2014).

=== ''Newspaper Bodies (Look, Mom, I'm on the Front Page!)'' ===

Sulkowicz's final thesis show, the week before graduation in May 2015, included depictions of a naked man with an obscenity and a couple having sex, printed onto a ''New York Times'' article about the student they accused. Sulkowicz said that the images were cartoons, and asked: "what are the functions of cartoons? Do they depict the people themselves (a feat which, if you've done enough reading on art theory, you will realize is impossible), or do they illustrate the stories that have circulated about a person?"&lt;ref name="Bazelon29May2015"&gt;Emily Bazelon (May 29, 2015).

=== ''Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol''{{anchor|Not}} ===

{{Main|Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol}}
On June 3, 2015, Sulkowicz, working with artist [[Ted Lawson]], released ''Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol'' ("This is not a rape"), an eight-minute video of Sulkowicz having sex with an anonymous actor in a Columbia dorm room.&lt;ref name="Alptraum2018"/&gt; The title of the piece is a reference to the caption in [[René Magritte]]'s ''[[The Treachery of Images]]'': "''Ceci n'est pas une pipe''". Introductory text by Sulkowicz stresses that the sex was consensual throughout, though toward the end it portrays resistance, violence and force.&lt;ref name="Munro4June2015"&gt;Cait Munro (June 4, 2015). [https://news.artnet.com/art-world/emma-sulkowiczs-rape-referencing-video-305180 "Emma Sulkowicz Breaks New Ground With Troubling Video Performance"], ''Artnet''&lt;/ref&gt; When the video was first posted, each screen displayed the timestamp of August 27, 2012, the night of the alleged assault, but later the date was blurred.&lt;ref name="Armus5June2015"&gt;Teo Armus (June 5, 2015).

=== ''Self-Portrait'' ===

From February to March 2016 at [[Coagula Curatorial]] in Los Angeles, Sulkowicz exhibited a piece, ''Self-Portrait''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-emma-sulkowicz-los-angeles-coagula-emmatron-20160228-story.html|title=Moving beyond 'Mattress Girl': Artist Emma Sulkowicz pushes the conversation forward|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first three weeks of the exhibition, Sulkowicz stood on a pedestal in the gallery, and had one-on-one conversations with visitors who would stand on an identical pedestal in front of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.kcet.org/shows/artbound/emma-sulkowicz-mattress-performance|title=Life After Mattress Girl: Emma Sulkowicz Reclaims Her Identity|date=March 28, 2016 |publisher=KCET }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition also featured a life size robotic replica of the artist that was called "Emmatron". Emmatron plays prerecorded answers to several questions Sulkowicz has been repeatedly asked that they will no longer respond to. A few examples of questions Emmatron had answers to included "Tell me about the night you were assaulted", "Is this art piece a part of ''Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)''?" and "What do your parents think of all this?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jk-russ/self-portrait-dialogue-wi_b_9405572.html|title=Self Portrait – Dialogue With Emma Sulkowicz and an Inanimate Object|date=March 9, 2016|publisher=HuffPost}}&lt;/ref&gt; If audience members asked these questions to Sulkowicz during their conversation, the artist would send them to Emmatron for the answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thefrisky.com/2016-02-16/emma-sulkowicz-will-answer-almost-any-question-at-her-first-solo-gallery-show/|title=Emma Sulkowicz Will Answer (Almost) Any Question At Her First Solo Gallery Show – The Frisky|date=February 16, 2016|publisher=[[The Frisky]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Untitled Protest Performance===

On January 30, 2018, Sulkowicz was documented protesting at two New York City museums and a subway station. During the protest, Sulkowicz posed for several photographs in front of Chuck Close [[painting|paintings]] at [[The Museum of Modern Art]] and [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]], a Close [[mosaic]] in [[86th Street (Second Avenue Subway)|a subway station]], as well as in front of Picasso's ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]''. Sulkowicz wore black lingerie, with home-made [[pasties]] made of tape, and covered their body with drawn-on [[asterisk|asterisks]]. Sulkowicz stated that the protest was a response to a ''New York Times'' article from 28 January, in which members of the art world, responding to [[Chuck_Close#Sexual_harassment_allegations|allegations of sexual harassment]] towards artist [[Chuck Close]], debated over the future of art created by individuals accused of improper behavior. Among the people quoted in the article was Jock Reynolds, the then-director of the [[Yale University Art Gallery]], who stated, "[[Pablo Picasso]] was one of the worst offenders of the 20th century in terms of his history with women. Are we going to take his work out of the galleries? At some point you have to ask yourself, is the art going to stand alone as something that needs to be seen?" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1=Sopan| first1=Deb | first2=Robin| last2=Jennifer | date=28 January 2018|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/arts/design/chuck-close-exhibit-harassment-accusations.html |title=''Chuck Close Is Accused of Harassment. Should His Artwork Carry an Asterisk?''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sulkowicz was reportedly "appalled" by the comments, asking, "are you only showing work by [[Harvey Weinstein]]?"&lt;ref name=SCascone/&gt; The protest was described as a "performance" in the media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1=Pogrebin| first1=Robin| first2=Jennifer| last2=Schuessler| date=28 January 2018|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/arts/design/chuck-close-exhibit-harassment-accusations.html|title=''Museums and a Performance Artist Grapple With Chuck Close’s Work''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCascone"/&gt;, and as "performative action" by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Mahoney|first=Maggie|url=http://www.amlitmag.com/blog/amlit/2018/04/profile-emma|title=Emma Sulkowicz: Life Post Mattress Performance|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703061208/http://www.amlitmag.com/blog/amlit/2018/04/profile-emma|archive-date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Floating  World'' ===

From March 10 to April 22, 2018, The Invisible Dog gallery in [[Brooklyn]], New York hosted Sulkowicz' first gallery installation, a piece entitled ''The Floating  World''.&lt;ref name="SCascone"&gt;{{cite news | last= Cascone| first=Sarah |date=2 February 2018|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/emma-sulkowicz-performance-protest-1214429

'''Hans Mortensen''' (born 2 September [[1943]] at [[Tórshavn]], [[Faroe Islands]]), is a retired [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] [[Businessperson|businessman]] and [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]]. He is famous for founding and managing the biggest department store in [[Tórshavn]], [[SMS]], and is also recognised for his contribution in introducing trade and business terminology into the [[Faroese language]]. Between 1963 and 1976 he was a driving force in developing elite handball in the Faroe Islands.

== Personal life ==
Mortensen was born and raised in Tórshavn in the Faroe Islands. He is the son of business owners Niels Gustav Mortensen (1913 – 1987) and Ebba Mortensen (1920 – 2000), who each ran trading businesses in one of the older trading quarters of Tórshavn between 1952 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pfformula.ipapercms.dk/SMS/SMSbl/SMSbl2012/SMSbloktober2012/|title=SMS : Hans Mortensen|date=November 2012|website=Pfformula.ipapercms.dk|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, he married Birgit Mortensen (née Sivertsen), and together they had a daughter, Elisabeth Mortensen and a son, Niels Mortensen. Niels Mortensen took over as CEO of SMS after his father stepped down from the position in 1996, and as a member of its board after Mortensen retired in 2007. After being a widower since 2001, Mortensen remarried in 2007 with Marjun á Plógv.

== Education ==
After completing primary and secondary school, Mortensen received his Upper Secondary diploma from [[Føroya Millum- og Realskúli]] and took on an apprenticeship at Føroya Banki (now [[BankNordik]]). In 1967, Mortensen graduated from the [[Niels Brock]] business school in [[Copenhagen]] and shortly after started working at the [[Magasin du Nord]] department store on [[Kongens Nytorv]] in Copenhagen. After two years at the department store, Mortensen returned to the Faroe Islands to found his own business and improve the lagging business conditions in the country.

== Sport ==
Mortensen’s life-long commitment to Faroese elite [[handball]] began in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1963, at the age of 18, Mortensen became the president of the Tórshavn handball club [[Neistin]] and immediately initiated the construction of a club venue, completed in the following year. The venue was crucial to the club’s subsequent popularity and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hvannrok.fo/2016/03/30/neistaeldsalin-hans-mortensen-var-framsiggin-hondboltsleidari/|title=Neistaeldsálin Hans Mortensen var framsíggin hondbóltsleiðari - Hvannrók|website=Hvannrok.fo|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Mortensen played on the first Faroese men’s national handball team. In 1976, Mortensen was head coach for the men’s national handball team when they achieved good results during the Men’s Handball World Championship 1976 Group C in [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todor66.com/handball/World/Men_C_1976.html|title=Men Handball World Championship 1976 Group C Portugal - 26.11-01.12 Winner Portugal|first=Todor|last=Krastev|website=Todor66.com|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
After completing his education in [[Denmark]], Mortensen ran his own retail business in his parents’ premises in central Tórshavn. But in 1970, Mortensen organised the first of many trade fairs in the Faroe Islands. A few attempts had been made earlier at arranging similar events in 1968 in Klaksvík.&lt;ref&gt; Cf. Tingakrossur no. 29 – 26 July 1968, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the trade fairs showed that demand for the Faroese market was bigger than the market was capable of supplying at the time.

Most businesses were located in central Torshavn, and increasing traffic and construction was causing congestion. Tórshavn's city council was therefore planning to establish a shopping street as an extension of a new pharmacy at the outskirts of the city centre to divert some of the traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Dagblaðið no. 43 – 28 juli 1976, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoydal, Gunnar: Sosialurin no. 78 – 7 July 1984, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon learning of the city plans and the reasons behind them, Mortensen suggested privatising the project in order to further promote business. After initial internal disputes, Mortensen was granted permission to build his department store, which would enable customers to run various errands in a single location.

Mortensen hired Danish architect Flemming Hansen to design a progressive department store, whose architecture would still be rooted in traditional Faroese building style. Construction began in 1976, and the department store SMS opened to the public on November 2nd, 1977. Mortensen was CEO of SMS from 1976 to 1996 and majority shareholder until 2007, when he sold all his shares to his son Niels Mortensen. Niels Mortensen has since then developed the business further. Today the SMS Group includes three shopping centers, three chain stores, a number of partnerships and a microbiological laboratory.

== Business and visions ==
Mortensen’s visions have been characterised by both progressiveness and traditionalism. The department store SMS was designed to resemble traditional Faroese boathouses, and Faroese shop names and business terminology was developed by taking into account common citizen and customer opinions, often through public naming competitions. Over time, the previous predominately Danish business terminology was replaced by newly created Faroese terminology, which continues to evolve with the introduction of new terms and technology.

In an effort to combine innovation with historic preservation, Mortensen collaborated with architects Gunnar Hoydal, Mette Skjold, and Ósbjørn Jacobsen in 2012 to create a public proposal on how to continue developing the Tórshavn city centre while maintaining its historic features.&lt;ref&gt;Hoydal, Gunnar et al, Havnin innan fyri Stóragarð: hugsjónir og dreymar, Tórshavn 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
On International Mother Language Day in 2015, Mortensen received the Faroese Mother Language Award for his longstanding contribution to society and language, particularly his innovative approaches to Faroese trade and business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snar.fo/tema/skaldskapur-og-midlar/modurmalid/modurmalsvirdisloen/|title=Móðurmálsvirðisløn|website=Snar.fo|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hedy Madeleine Fry''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|PC|MP}} (born August 6, 1941) is a Trinidadian-[[Canadians|Canadian]] politician and physician. She is currently the longest-serving female Member of [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]],&lt;ref name="Vsun" /&gt; winning eight consecutive elections  in the constituency of [[Vancouver Centre]] since the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 election]], when she defeated incumbent Prime Minister [[Kim Campbell]].

==Early life and career==
Fry was born in [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago|San Fernando]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]].  After declining an English Literature scholarship to Oxford, Fry earned her equivalent of a BA in Science in one year and then went on to receive her medical training at the Royal College of Surgeons in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name="Vsun"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hume|first1=Stephen|title=Canada 150: 'Underestimate Hedy Fry at your peril'|url=http://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/canada-150-underestimate-hedy-fry-at-your-peril|work=Vancouver Sun|date=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She immigrated to Canada in 1970 and established a practice in [[Vancouver]].

Fry worked at [[St. Paul's Hospital (Vancouver)]] for 23 years. She served as president of the [[British Columbia]] Federation of Medical Women in 1977. She was president of the Vancouver Medical Association in 1988-89, the [[BC Medical Association]] in 1990-91, and chaired the Canadian Medical Association's Multiculturalism Committee in 1992-9. She volunteered as a Tawny Owl as a member of the [[Girl Guides of Canada]], leading a Brownie group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openparliament.ca/debates/2003/2/19/hedy-fry-1/|title=Hedy Fry, "Guide and Scout Week" on Feb. 19th, 2003 {{!}} openparliament.ca|website=openparliament.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry was also a host on the nationally televised CBC show Doctor Doctor.

==Federal politics==
Fry sought and won the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] nomination for [[Vancouver Centre]] for the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 federal election]] over lawyer [[David Varty]] and college lecturer John Lang in March 1993. She was elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada]], defeating [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Kim Campbell]]. Fry was only the fifth person to unseat a sitting prime minister, and the first to do so on his or her first try for office. Fry has been re-elected in every subsequent election ([[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997]], [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000]], [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004]], [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006]], [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008]], [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011]] and [[Canadian federal election, 2015|2015]]).

===Chretien and Martin governments===
She served as [[Parliamentary Secretary]] to the Minister of National Health and Welfare from 1993 until 1996 when she was appointed to the [[Canadian Cabinet|Cabinet]] as [[Secretary of State (Canada)|Secretary of State]] for Multiculturalism and [[Minister responsible for the Status of Women (Canada)|Status of Women]]. Fry apologized to the people of Prince George, B.C. after she said in the House of Commons that cross burnings had taken place on lawns in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/minister-apologizes-for-cross-burning-remarks-1.279168|title = Minister apologizes for cross burning remarks|date = 22 March 2001|accessdate = 27 October 2015|website = |publisher = [[CBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry did not remain a minister after cabinet was [[Cabinet shuffle|shuffled]] in 2002.

When [[Paul Martin]] became [[Prime Minister of Canada]] at the end of 2003, he made her [[Parliamentary Secretary]] to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration with special emphasis on Foreign Credentials. After the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 election]], she was named Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development with special emphasis on the Internationally Trained Workers Initiative.

===In opposition===
In 2006, she beat high-profile NDP activist and former MP [[Svend Robinson]] and in 2008 she defeated high-profile Conservative [[Lorne Mayencourt]]. On May 4, 2006, Fry became the 11th person, 3rd woman, and the only Westerner to officially enter the [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 2006|Liberal party leadership race]]. Fry launched her leadership campaign saying that Canada's diversity is its greatest competitive advantage - "our weapon of mass inclusion" - and called for a "non-ideological" approach to problem solving. She withdrew from the contest on September 25 and announced her support for [[Bob Rae]].

Re-elected in [[Vancouver Centre]] for a sixth term in 2008, Fry was appointed the Official Opposition Critic for [[Canadian Heritage]]. On November 21, 2008, Liberal leadership candidate [[Bob Rae]] announced that Fry would serve as his Campaign Co-Chair in [[British Columbia]].

Fry was re-elected in 2011 by a margin of approximately 2,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Hipparchia of Maroneia''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ɪ|ˈ|p|ɑr|k|i|ə}}; {{lang-el|Ἱππαρχία ἡ Μαρωνεῖτις}}; fl. c. 325 BC) was a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] [[women in philosophy|philosopher]], and wife of [[Crates of Thebes]]. She was born in [[Maroneia]], but her family moved to [[Athens]], where Hipparchia came into contact with Crates, the most famous Cynic philosopher in [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] at that time. She fell in love with him, and, despite the disapproval of her parents, she married him. She went on to live a life of Cynic [[poverty]] on the streets of Athens with her husband.

Little survives of her own philosophical views, but like most Cynics, her influence lies in the example of her life, choosing a way of life which was usually considered unacceptable for respectable women of the time. The story of her attraction to Crates, and her rejection of conventional values, became a popular theme for later writers.

==Life==
Hipparchia was born c. 350 BC in [[Maroneia]], [[Thrace]].&lt;ref name="diog96"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="suda1"&gt;Suda, ''Hipparchia''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her family came to [[Athens]], where Hipparchia's brother, [[Metrocles]], became a pupil of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosopher [[Crates of Thebes]].&lt;ref name="diog94"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  Hipparchia fell in love with Crates, and developed such a passion for him, that she told her parents that if they refused to allow her to marry him, she would kill herself. They begged Crates to dissuade her, and he stood before her, removed his clothes, and said, "Here is the bridegroom, and this is his property."&lt;ref name="diog96"/&gt;  Hipparchia, however, was quite happy with this; she adopted the Cynic life assuming the same clothes that he wore, and appearing with him in public everywhere.&lt;ref name="diog97"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Crates called their marriage "dog-coupling" (''cynogamy'').&lt;ref name="suda2"&gt;Suda, ''Krates''.&lt;/ref&gt; We are told that they lived in the [[stoa]]s and porticoes of Athens,&lt;ref&gt;Musonius Rufus, 14. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Latin-language writer [[Apuleius]] wrote a dubious account of them [[Public sex|having sex, publicly, in broad daylight]].&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Florida'' 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="long42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|1996|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this would have been consistent with Cynic shamelessness (''anaideia''), the mere fact that Hipparchia adopted male clothes and lived on equal terms with her husband would have been enough to shock Athenian society.&lt;ref name="long42"/&gt; Hipparchia had at least two children, a daughter,&lt;ref name="diog93"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 93&lt;/ref&gt; and a son named Pasicles.&lt;ref name="suda2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="diog88"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 88&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known how or when she died. There is an [[epigram]] ascribed to [[Antipater of Sidon]], as to what may have been written on her tomb:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
I, Hipparchia chose not the tasks of rich-robed woman, but the manly life of the Cynic.
Brooch-clasped tunics, well-clad shoes, and perfumed headscarves pleased me not;
But with wallet and fellow staff, together with coarse cloak and bed of hard ground,
My name shall be greater than [[Atalanta]]: for wisdom is better than mountain running.&lt;ref&gt;''Greek Anthology'', 7.413. This translation based on those of: [[William Roger Paton|William R. Paton]], ''The [[Greek Anthology]]'' (1918); Arthur Way, ''Greek Anthology'' (1939); Mary Ellen Waithe, ''A History of Women Philosophers'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
==Philosophy==
[[File:Crates and Hipparchia Villa Farnesina.jpg|thumb|Roman wall painting of Hipparchia and Crates from the [[Villa Farnesina]], [[Rome]]. Hipparchia approaches Crates carrying a box, implying that she has come to Crates as a potential bride bearing her possessions.&lt;ref&gt;Diskin Clay, ''Picturing Diogenes'', in R. Bracht Branham, Marie-Odile Goulet-Cazé, (2000), ''The Cynics: The Cynic Movement in Antiquity and Its Legacy'', pp. 372–73.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The ''[[Suda]]'' says she wrote some philosophical treatises, and some letters addressed to [[Theodorus the Atheist]].&lt;ref name="suda1"/&gt; None of these have survived. There are some accounts of her encounters with Theodorus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When she went into a symposium with Crates, she tested Theodoros the atheist by proposing a [[sophism]] like this: "That which if Theodoros did, he would not be said to do wrong, neither should Hipparchia be said to do wrong if she does it. Theodoros hitting himself does not do wrong, nor does Hipparchia do wrong hitting Theodoros." He did not reply to what she said, but pulled up her garment.&lt;ref name="suda1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
We are told she was neither offended nor ashamed by this "as most women would have been."&lt;ref name="diog97"/&gt; We are also told that when Theodorus (quoting a line from ''[[The Bacchae]]'' of [[Euripides]]) said to her:
"Who is the woman who has left behind the shuttles of the loom?" she replied
&lt;blockquote&gt;I, Theodorus, am that person, but do I appear to you to have come to a wrong decision, if I devote that time to philosophy, which I otherwise should have spent at the loom?"&lt;ref name="diog98"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Many other anecdotes existed about Hipparchia,&lt;ref name="diog98"/&gt; but they have been mostly lost. We know also that Crates taught [[Zeno of Citium]]; it is impossible to say what influence Hipparchia had on Zeno in his development of [[Stoicism]], but Zeno's own radical views on [[love]] and [[sex]] (as evidenced in his ''[[The Republic (Zeno)|Republic]]'') may have been influenced by the relationship of Hipparchia and Crates.&lt;ref name=schofield&gt;{{Harvnb|Schofield|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later influence==
Hipparchia's fame undoubtedly rests on the fact that she was a woman practising philosophy and living a life on equal terms with her husband.  Both facts were unusual for ancient [[Greece]] or [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="long42"/&gt;  Although there were other women who chose to live as Cynics, Hipparchia is the only one whose name is known.&lt;ref&gt;''Nicion'', a courtesan nicknamed the ''Dog-Fly'', appears in the ''Banquet of the Cynics'' quoted by [[Athenaeus]] (iv.157a), but there is no reason to suppose she is not fictional.&lt;/ref&gt;  She is also the only woman to have her own entry among the 82 philosophers in Diogenes Laërtius' ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', and she continued to fascinate later writers.  There are, for example, a set of ''[[Cynic epistles]]'', written in the 1st century AD, some of which purport to give advice from Crates to Hipparchia:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our philosophy is called Cynic not because we are indifferent to everything, but because we aggressively endure what others, due to being soft or general opinion find unbearable.  So it is for this reason and not the former that they have called us Cynics.  Stay, therefore, and continue as a Cynic—for you are not by nature worse than we [men] are, for neither are female dogs worse than male—in order that you might be freed from Nature, as all [people] either because of law or due to vices, live as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Crates, ''Epistle'' 29, from Wimbush, L., (1990), ''Ascetic Behavior in Greco-Roman Antiquity: A Sourcebook''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other letters mention events, which, like a lot of the ''Cynic epistles'', may be based on actual anecdotes which existed at the time. In two of the letters,&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Crates, ''Epistle'' 30, 32&lt;/ref&gt; we are told that Hipparchia sent a cloak to Crates which she had made. Crates, though, fears that she may have undertaken the task "so that you might appear to the masses to be someone who loves her husband." Crates urges her to renounce wool-spinning and take-up philosophy since that is the reason she married him. In another letter,&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Crates, ''Epistle'' 33&lt;/ref&gt; Crates learns why she has taken up domestic tasks: Hipparchia, we are told, has given birth. After agreeing with her that she gave birth easily because of her Cynic training, Crates proceeds to give advice on how to rear the child:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let his bath water be cold, his clothes be a cloak, his food be milk, yet not to excess. Rock him in a cradle made from a tortoise shell. ... When he is able to speak and walk, dress him, not with a sword, as [[Aethra (Greek mythology)|Aethra]] did with [[Theseus]], but with a staff and cloak and wallet, which can guard men better than swords, and send him to Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Crates, ''Epistle'' 33, from Abraham J. Malherbe, (1977), ''The Cynic Epistles, A Study Edition''. SBL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perhaps most remarkable is a letter purporting to come from [[Diogenes of Sinope]] addressed to the people of [[Maroneia]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;You did well when you changed the name of the city and, instead of Maroneia, called it Hipparchia, its present name, since it is better for you to be named after Hipparchia, a woman, it's true, but a philosopher, than after Maron, a man who sells wine.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Diogenes, ''Epistle'' 43, from Abraham J. Malherbe, (1977), ''The Cynic Epistles: A Study Edition''. SBL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There is, unfortunately, no evidence that the people of Maroneia ever renamed their city Hipparchia.

==Modern influence==
[[File:Hipparchia and crates cats.jpg|right|thumb|Engraving of Hipparchia and Crates from the ''Touchstone of the Wedding Ring'' by [[Jacob Cats]]. Depicted in 17th-century clothing, Crates tries to dissuade Hipparchia from her affections for him by pointing to his head to show how ugly he is]]

The story of Hipparchia's pursuit of Crates, despite the disapproval of her parents and the initial reluctance of Crates, was a popular tale from the 16th century onwards. It featured in [[Lodovico Guicciardini]]'s [[commonplace book]] ''Hore di ricreatione'' published in 1568,&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Gerald Arthur Roberts, ''Dogs' tales: representations of ancient Cynicism in French Renaissance texts'', page 85. Rodopi&lt;/ref&gt; and it was one of the stories told by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] poet [[Jacob Cats]] in his ''Touchstone of the Wedding Ring'' (''Proefsteen van de Trou-ringh'') published in 1637.&lt;ref&gt;A. Agnes Sneller, ''Reading Jacob Cats'', in Els Kloek et al, (1994), ''Women of the golden age: an international debate on women in seventeenth-century Holland, England and Italy'', pp. 21–26. Uitgeverij Verloren.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Penn]] wrote about her in his ''No Cross, No Crown'', which he wrote in prison in 1668. For Penn she was an example of [[puritan]] discipline and virtue:&lt;ref&gt;William Penn, [https://archive.org/details/nocrossnocrowndi00pennuoft ''No Cross, No Crown'']&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|I seek not the Pomp and Effeminacy of this World, but Knowledge and Virtue, ''Crates''; and choose a Life of Temperance, before a Life of Delicacies: For true Satisfaction, thou knowest, is in the Mind; and that Pleasure is only worth seeking, that lasts for ever.}}
Her marriage to Crates inspired [[Pierre Petit (scholar)|Pierre Petit]] to write the [[Latin]] poem ''Cynogamia, sive de Cratetis et Hipparches amoribus'' in 1676.&lt;ref&gt;Luis E. Navia, (1995), ''The philosophy of Cynicism: an annotated bibliography'', p. 182. Greenwood Press&lt;/ref&gt; In the same century, [[Clemenza Ninci]], an Italian [[nun]], wrote a play entitled ''Sposalizio d'Iparchia filosofa'' (''The marriage of Hipparchia the philosopher''). The play deals with Hipparchia's desire to marry Crates, and the obstacles which are placed in her way until she achieves her desire. The play was written for [[convent]] performance (with all the parts played by nuns) and was not published until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Katharina M. Wilson, (1991), ''An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers'', p. 918. Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Germany|German]] writer [[Christoph Martin Wieland]] made Crates and Hipparchia the heroes of his [[epistolary novel]] ''Krates und Hipparchia'' (1804). Crates and Hipparchia feature in [[Marcel Schwob]]'s ''Vies Imaginaires'' (''Imaginary Lives'', 1896). The American writer [[H.D.]] wrote a novella ''Hipparchia'' (1921), a highly fictionalised account of Hipparchia's daughter, (whom H.D. imagines is also called Hipparchia).&lt;ref&gt;H.D., (1921), ''Palimpsest''&lt;/ref&gt; Hipparchia was an inspiration for the book ''L'Étude et le rouet'' (1989) (translated in English under the title ''Hipparchia's Choice'') by the French [[Feminist philosophy|feminist philosopher]] [[Michèle Le Dœuff]], a reflection on women's relation to philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Peter France, (1995), ''The New Oxford Companion to Literature in French'', p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martha Nussbaum]], in her speech to the University of Chicago Law School graduating class of 2010, presented Hipparchia'a life as an illustrative example of the benefits of continuing education beyond academic settings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.uchicago.edu/news/graduation06162010 ''The Law School Celebrates New Graduates''], University of Chicago Law School&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[genus]] of butterflies, ''[[Hipparchia (genus)|Hipparchia]]'', bears her name.

[[File:Gilbert du Motier Marquis de Lafayette.jpg|thumb|right]][[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette]] (1757–1834), a French aristocrat and Revolutionary War hero, was widely commemorated in the U.S. and elsewhere. Below is a list of the many homages and/or tributes named in his honor:

==Honors==
[[File:La Fayette 1957 Issue-3c.jpg|thumb|170px|upright|right|[[U.S. Postage Stamp]], 1957 issue, 3c, commemorating 200th anniversary of the birth of La Fayette]]
*In 1792, [[James McHenry]], whom Lafayette considered a good friend, purchased a tract called [[Ridgely's Delight]] about a mile west of Baltimore. On it, he built a country seat on 95&amp;nbsp;acres and named it Fayetteville in his honor.&lt;ref name = "Steiner"&gt;{{cite book | author = Bernard Christian Steiner| title = The life and correspondence of James McHenry: Secretary of War under Washington and Adams| year = 1907| publisher = The Burrows Brothers Company| isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1824, the U.S. government named [[President's Park#Lafayette Park|Lafayette Park]] in his honor; it lies immediately north of the White House in Washington, D.C.
*In 1826, [[Lafayette College]] was chartered in [[Easton, Pennsylvania]]. Lafayette was honored with a monument in New York City in 1917.&lt;ref name="parks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=13307|title=Marquis de Lafayette |date=7 March 2002 |accessdate=11 August 2008 |publisher=New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation }}&lt;/ref&gt; Portraits display Washington and Lafayette in the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref name="govtrack"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/record.xpd?id=110-h20070522-29 |title=House Record: Honoring The Marquis De Lafayette On The Occasion Of The 250th Anniversary Of His Birth: Section 29 |date=22 May 2007 |accessdate=11 August 2008 |publisher=GovTrack.us |author=Ike Skelton}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous towns, cities, and counties across the United States were named in his honor.
*In 1831, the French [[navy surgeon]] and [[naturalist]] [[René Primevère Lesson]] honored Lafayette by giving the [[Sri Lankan junglefowl]] the [[scientific name]] ''Gallus lafayetii''. Hence the spelling ''lafayetii'' is considered a [[lapsus]] and the corrected spelling ''G. lafayettii'' is in common use.&lt;ref&gt;Grouw, Hein van, Dekkers, Wim &amp; Rookmaaker, Kees (2017). On Temminck’s tailless Ceylon Junglefowl, and how Darwin denied their existence. ''Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club (London)'', 137 (4), 261-271. https://doi.org/10.25226/bboc.v137i4.2017.a3&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1834, upon Lafayette's death, American President [[Andrew Jackson]] ordered that Lafayette be accorded the same funeral honors as John Adams and George Washington. Therefore, 24-gun salutes were fired from military posts and ships, each shot representing a U.S. state. Flags flew at half mast for thirty-five days, and "military officers wore crepe for six months".&lt;ref&gt;Gaines, p. 448&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clary, p. 448&lt;/ref&gt; The Congress hung black in chambers and asked the entire country to dress in black for the next thirty days.&lt;ref&gt;Clary, p. 449&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1899, Lafayette appeared with Washington on a U.S. coin, the [[Lafayette dollar]] that was minted in 1899 (though showing the year 1900). It was produced to raise money for a statue of him that was erected in Paris.
*On July 4, 1917, shortly after the U.S. entered World War I, [[Charles E. Stanton|Colonel Charles E. Stanton]] visited the grave of Lafayette and uttered the famous phrase "Lafayette, we are here." After the war, a U.S. flag was permanently placed at the grave site. Every year, on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], the flag is replaced in a joint French-American ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://francerevisited.com/2009/07/lafayette-and-the-american-flag-the-fourth-of-july-ceremony/|accessdate=19 September 2013|title=Lafayette and the American Flag: The Fourth of July Ceremony}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag remained even during the [[Nazi Germany|German]] occupation of Paris during World War II.
*In 1943, on visiting [[Corsica]], General [[George S. Patton]] commented on how the [[Free French]] forces had liberated the birthplace of Napoleon, and promised that the Americans would liberate the birthplace of Lafayette.
*In 1958, the [[Order of Lafayette]] was established by U.S. Representative [[Hamilton Fish III]], a World War I veteran, to promote Franco-American friendship and to honor Americans who fought in France. The frigate ''Hermione'', in which Lafayette returned to America, has been reconstructed in the port of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=L'Hermione|author=Robert Kalbach|url=http://hermione.free.fr/english/rebuild.html|publisher=L’association Hermione-La Fayette|work=L'Hermione|accessdate=11 August 2008|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ioannis (Giannakis) Stratos''' (1793–1848) was an armatole and fighter of the [[Greek War of Independence]]. After the establishment of the [[Greece|Greek state]], he became an officer of the [[Royal Phalanx]].

==Biographical information==
Stratos was born in 1793 in [[Loutro, Aetolia-Acarnania]] and he belonged in an old [[armatolos|armatolic]] family of Western Greece. At the beginning of the revolution, he followed along with his brother, Nikolaos, and his cousin, Sotirios, the famous armatole [[Gogos Bakolas]] and he was distinguished in the battles of Makrynoros in June 1821.&lt;ref name=a&gt;Σύγχρονος Εγκυκλοπαίδεια Ελευθερουδάκη, vol. 22, p. 815.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1822, he was in Makrynoros where he joined the forces of [[Gennaios Kolokotronis]] who had arrived from the [[Peloponnese]].&lt;ref&gt;Kokkinos, 1974, vol. 2, p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vakalopoulos, 1982, vol. 6, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 13, 1825 he entered in the beleaguered [[Messolonghi]].&lt;ref&gt;Fotiadis, 1971, Vol. 3, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of Messolonghi, he went to [[Nafplio]] where he was appointed as a garrison commander of the castle Iç Kale (along with Athanasios Fotomaras) as an offset for the occupation of Palamidi from [[Theodoros Grivas]],&lt;ref name=a/&gt; with whom he was in controversy despite the fact that they were cousins.&lt;ref&gt;Kassomoulis, 2013, vol. 2, p. 326 – 327.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsiamalos, 2007, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827 he was involved in an armed conflict with Grivas and the consequence was the cannon fire between the two fortresses and the lethal street fighting in Nafplio. The result of this conflict was the death or injuring of 50 people.  Meanwhile, Stratos’ men captured several residents, including Anagnostis and [[Kanellos Deligiannis]]. These conflicts caused sad impression on foreigners who were during that time in Nafplio.&lt;ref&gt;Vakalopoulos, 1986, 7, p. 767 – 771.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 1827, Stratos handed the fortress to Velissarios Kalogeros and occupied areas outside the city of Nafplio, which were suggested to him by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Fotiadis, 1971, vol. 4, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vakalopoulos, 1986, 7, p. 769.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, his men came into armed conflict with some villagers from Argos who had refused to give them food that was lined up for the troops.&lt;ref&gt;Vakalopoulos, 1986, 7, p. 771.&lt;/ref&gt; With the reform of the army during Kapodistrias’ governance, he was promoted to chiliarch.&lt;ref&gt;Papageorgiou, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fotiadis, 1971, vol. 4, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; As the head of the 3rd Chiliarchy, he took part in the campaign for the liberation of Central Greece and he was distinguished in the battles of Ternova,&lt;ref&gt;Papageorgiou, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fotiadis, 1971, vol. 4, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; Mavrilos&lt;ref&gt;Papageorgiou, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Battle of Petra|Petra]].&lt;ref&gt;Fotiadis, 1971, vol. 4, p. 163 – 164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papageorgiou, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832, he participated in one of the local governments that were created in Greece after the departure of [[Augustinos Kapodistrias]].&lt;ref&gt;X. N. Filadelfefs ( ed.), 1855, p. 41 – 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next years, Stratos belonged to the so-called “[[French Party (Greece)|French Party]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Papageorgiou, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843 he was elected as a representative to the National Assembly. He joined the [[Royal Phalanx]] and became a Major General. He was killed in 1848 when he was ambushed, during the chase of a group of thieves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kapodistrias.info/stratos-giannakis Giannakis Stratos.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeanne Mitchell''' (born 11 May 1938), professionally known as '''Jeannie Little''', is a now-retired, [[Gold Logie]]-award-winning, Australian entertainer and TV personality. She was diagnosed with rapid-onset Alzheimer's Disease in 2009, and is now being cared for in a Sydney nursing home.&lt;ref name="ABC-nurs"&gt;{{cite web |title=Jeanne Little's daughter creates Alzheimer's fund |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-02-08/jeanne-littles-daughter-creates-alzheimers-fund/1934040 |website=ABC news |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=4 August 2018 |date=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jeanne Little no longer knows where she is or what's happening around her |url=https://www.9news.com.au/9stories/2016/09/30/12/09/jeanne-little-no-longer-knows-where-she-is-or-whats-happening-around-her |website=9 news |publisher=Nine Digital |accessdate=4 August 2018 |date=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Little was born in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. She made her television debut on Network Ten's ''[[The Mike Walsh Show]]'' in September 1974. Invited on as a guest showcasing designer maternity clothes, Little quickly became a regular, eventually (after a stint at Channel Seven) moving with the Walsh Show to Channel Nine. The Seven Network had attempted two short-lived shows featuring Little's unique talents: ''Jeanne's Little Show'' (a variety/chat series) and ''[[Cuckoo in the Nest (TV series)|Cuckoo in the Nest]]'', a situation comedy in which she played a wacky ''[[Auntie Mame]]''-type character. As part of ''The Mike Walsh Show'' team again, Little wowed and won audiences for the next 15 years.

She was a guest on the ''Midday with [[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Ray Martin]]'' and her appearance on the BBC's [[Michael Parkinson]] variety show so startled London critics she had the ''London Evening News'' saying: "What a woman! With her in the house you wouldn't want a TV." Among the overseas guests she has appeared with are [[Phyllis Diller]], [[George Burns]], and [[Danny La Rue]].

In 1976 Little won a Gold [[Logie Award|Logie]] for most popular television personality, and subsequently won two other Logies for her work on the ''Mike Walsh Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Glen |last=Williams |title=Jeanne's TV Week Logies frocks rock! |date=28 April 2008 |publisher=ACP Magazines |url=http://womansday.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=453129 |work=[[Woman's Day (Australian magazine)|Woman's Day]] |accessdate=5 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503091856/http://womansday.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=453129 |archivedate= 3 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}''What did winning a Gold Logie in 1976 mean to you? Well daaahling, I was in total shock. Absolute shock, I thought, "What me? Winning a Gold Logie? For Heaven's sake this is ridiculous, there's been a mistake."''&lt;/ref&gt; She performed at the Royal Command Bicentennial Concert before the Prince and Princess of Wales. Her stage career took off with ''[[Jerry's Girls]],'' in which American director John Frost teamed Little with well known entertainers [[Marcia Hines]], [[Debra Byrne]] and [[Judi Connelli]]. She then subsequently appeared in ''Legends'' with [[Kerrie Biddell]], [[Toni Lamond]], and Nancye Hayes at the [[Sydney Opera House]].

''Marlene'', Little's one woman tribute to [[Marlene Dietrich]], toured Australia and the US to critical acclaim, followed by ''More of a Little'', which was filled with songs, chat, and anecdotes.

In the late 1990s, through to the mid-2000s, Little appeared on the panel discussion show ''[[Beauty and the Beast (talk show)|Beauty and the Beast]]''.

In February 2011, it was announced Little was suffering from [[Alzheimer's Disease]], which was initially diagnosed in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://au.tv.yahoo.com/sunrise/factsheets/article/-/article/8787086/jeanne-littles-alzheimers-fund/ Jeannie Little's Battle] Retrieved 6 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, family members advised that Little's illness had advanced to the stage that she "no longer knows where she is or what’s going on around her".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2014/08/jeanne-littles-family-says-her-condition-has-deteriorated.html|title=Jeanne Little’s family says her condition has deteriorated|last1=Knox|first1=David|date=26 August 2014|website=TV Tonight|publisher=TV Tonight|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Reginald Halliday Christie''' (8 April 1899 – 15 July 1953), known to his family and friends as '''Reg Christie''', was an English [[serial killer]] and [[Necrophilia|necrophile]] active during the 1940s and early 1950s. He murdered at least eight people – including his wife, Ethel – by strangling them in his flat at 10 Rillington Place, [[Notting Hill]], [[London]]. Christie moved out of Rillington Place during March 1953; soon afterward the bodies of three of his victims were discovered hidden in a wallpaper-covered alcove in the kitchen. Two further bodies were discovered in the garden, and his wife's body was found beneath the floorboards of the front room. Christie was arrested and convicted of his wife's murder, for which he was [[hanging|hanged]].

Two of Christie's victims were Beryl Evans and her baby daughter Geraldine, who, along with Beryl's husband, [[Timothy Evans]], were tenants at 10 Rillington Place during 1948–49. This case sparked huge controversy after Timothy Evans was charged with both murders, found guilty of the murder of his daughter and hanged in 1950. Christie was a major prosecution witness; when his own crimes were discovered three years later, serious doubts were raised about the integrity of Evans's conviction. Christie himself subsequently admitted killing Beryl Evans, but not Geraldine; it is now generally accepted that Christie murdered both Beryl and Geraldine and that police mishandling of the original inquiry, as well as their incompetence during searches at the house, allowed Christie to escape detection and enabled him to murder four more women. The [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], when overturning the conviction in the Evans case during the 2000s, accepted that Evans did not murder either his wife or his child, and that a [[miscarriage of justice]] therefore occurred when Timothy Evans was hanged.&lt;ref name=WestlakeReviewCommission&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants = Mary Westlake v Criminal Cases Review Commission | court = EWHC | division = Admin | year = 2004 | num = 2779 | date = 17 November 2004 | courtname = auto | accessdate = 22 September 2009 }}. It includes a segment from the Hansard transcript of Jenkins's decision to recommend a pardon in the House of Commons.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an official inquiry conducted in 1965–66, [[Mr Justice (Sir Daniel) Brabin]] concluded that it was "more probable than not" that Evans killed his wife, but that he did not kill his daughter Geraldine.&lt;ref&gt;Brabin, ''Rillington Place'', p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; This finding, challenged in subsequent legal processes, enabled the [[Home Secretary]] to grant Evans a [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous pardon]] for the murder of his daughter during October 1966. The case contributed to the 1965 [[suspension of capital punishment for murder in the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Marston, p. 108"&gt;Marston, ''John Christie'', p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Christie was born in [[Northowram]] near [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=F5iBKTHMtRJ3iq0x8b0JDQ&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christie was the sixth in a family of seven children. He had a troubled relationship with his father, carpet designer Ernest John Christie, an austere and uncommunicative man who displayed little emotion towards his children and would punish them for trivial offences. He was also alternately coddled and bullied by his mother and older sisters.

During his later life, Christie's childhood peers described him as "a queer lad" who "kept himself to himself" and "was not very popular".&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 March 1911, his grandfather David Halliday died aged 75 in Christie's house after a long illness.&lt;ref&gt;Page 4 - John Christie of Rillington Place - Jonathan Oates&lt;/ref&gt; Christie saw his Grandfather's dead body laid out on a trestle table and he said it didn't worry or perturb him.&lt;ref&gt;Page 5 - John Christie of Rillington Place - Jonathan Oates&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 11, Christie won a scholarship to [[The Halifax Academy|Halifax Secondary School]] where his favourite subject was mathematics, particularly [[algebra]]. He was also good at History and Woodwork&lt;ref&gt;Page 6 - John Christie of Rillington Place - Jonathan Oates&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later found he had an [[IQ]] of 128.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; He sang in the church choir and was a [[Boy Scout]]. After leaving school on 22 April 1913&lt;ref&gt;Page 6 - John Christie of Rillington Place - Jonathan Oates&lt;/ref&gt; he began a job as an assistant [[Movie projector|cinema projectionist]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 23 and p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christie had a lifelong problem with [[impotence]]; his first attempts at sex were failures, and he was branded "Reggie-No-Dick" and "Can't-Do-It-Christie" throughout adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Marston, ''John Christie'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; (Nevertheless, a post-mortem report confirmed Christie's genitals were physically normal.) His difficulties with sex remained throughout his life, and most of the time he could only perform with [[prostitute]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (p. 34) reports that even with his wife, Christie's sexual activity was sporadic. He says that because prostitutes offered a service, they were undemanding and did not become emotionally involved with their clients, which could appease sexually dysfunctional people such as Christie.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 1916, Christie enlisted in the army; he was called up on 12 April 1917 to join the 52nd [[Sherwood Foresters|Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment]], to serve as an infantryman. In April 1918, the regiment was despatched to [[France]], where Christie was seconded to the [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|Duke of Wellington's (West Riding) Regiment]] as a signalman. That June, he was injured in a [[Sulfur mustard|mustard gas]] attack and spent a month in a military hospital in [[Calais]]. Christie claimed this attack left him permanently unable to speak loudly. Later in life, he also claimed the attack had rendered him [[blindness|blind]] and [[muteness|mute]] for three and a half years.&lt;ref name="Kennedy, p. 29"&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; His period of muteness was, he claimed, the reason for his inability to talk much louder than a whisper for the rest of his life. [[Ludovic Kennedy]] points out that no record of his blindness has been traced and that, while Christie may have lost his voice when he was admitted to hospital, he would not have been discharged as fit for duty had he remained a mute.&lt;ref name="Kennedy, p. 29"/&gt; His inability to talk loudly, Kennedy argues, was a [[Acute stress reaction|psychological reaction]] to the gassing rather than a lasting toxic effect of the gas.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', pp. 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt; That reaction, and Christie's exaggeration of the effects of the attack, stemmed from an underlying [[histrionic personality disorder|personality disorder]] that caused him to exaggerate or feign illness as a ploy to get attention and sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was demobilised from the army on 22 October 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Page 10 - John Christie of Rillington Place - Jonathan Oates&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the RAF on 13 December 1923 but was discharged on 15 August 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Page 17 - John Christie of Rillington Place - Jonathan Oates&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
Christie married Ethel Simpson from [[Sheffield]] at Halifax [[Register Office]] on 10 May 1920, but his problems with impotence remained, although he continued to visit prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the marriage Ethel suffered a miscarrage.&lt;ref&gt;Page 12 - John Christie of Rillington Place - Jonathan Oates&lt;/ref&gt;The couple moved to Sheffield, but separated after four years of marriage. Christie moved to London; he spent the next decade in and out of prison, while Ethel remained in Sheffield with her relatives. He was released from prison in January 1934,&lt;ref&gt;Page 25 - John Christie of Rillington Place - Jonathan Oates&lt;/ref&gt; when the couple reunited and moved to Rillington Place.&lt;ref name="Kennedy, p. 36"&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early criminal activity==
During the first decade of his marriage to Ethel, Christie was convicted of several criminal offences. He started work as a postman on 10 January 1921 in Halifax, and his first conviction was for stealing [[postal order]]s on 20 February and 26 March, for which he received three months' imprisonment on 12 April 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy,''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; He served his sentence in Manchester prison and was released on 27 June.&lt;ref&gt;Page 14 - John Christie of Rillington Place - Jonathan Oates&lt;/ref&gt; He was then convicted on 15 January 1923 of obtaining money on false pretences and of violent conduct, for which, respectively, he was [[binding over|bound over]] and put on 12&amp;nbsp;months' [[probation]].&lt;ref&gt;Eddowes, J., ''The Two Killers of Rillington Place'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; He committed two further crimes of [[larceny]] during 1924, and received consecutive sentences of three and six months' imprisonment on 22 September 1924.&lt;Ref&gt;Page 18 - John Christie of Rillington Place - Jonathan Oates&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy, p. 36"/&gt;  On 13 May 1929, after working for over two years as a lorry driver&lt;Ref&gt;Page 19 - John Christie of Rillington Place - Jonathan Oates&lt;/ref&gt; Christie was convicted of [[assault]]ing a prostitute with whom he was living in [[Battersea]] and was sentenced to six months' [[hard labour]]; Christie had hit her over the head with a [[cricket (sport)|cricket bat]], which the magistrate described as a "murderous attack".&lt;ref name="Kennedy, p. 36"/&gt; Finally, he was convicted of stealing a car from a [[priest]] who had befriended him, and was imprisoned for three months on 1 November 1933.&lt;Ref&gt;Page 24 - John Christie of Rillington Place - Jonathan Oates&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy,''Ten Rillington Place'', pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christie and Ethel were reconciled after his release from prison, but although he was able to end his recourse to petty crime, he continued to seek out prostitutes.&lt;ref name="Marston, p. 12"/&gt; In 1937, Christie and his wife moved into the top-floor flat of 10&amp;nbsp;Rillington Place in [[Notting Hill]]; then a rather run-down area of London. They moved into the ground-floor flat in December 1938. The house was a three-storey brick terrace; the ground and first floors contained a bedroom, living room and kitchen but the second-floor flat had no living room. Living conditions were "squalid"&amp;nbsp;– the building's occupants had just one outside lavatory to share, and none of the flats had a bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;Eddowes, J., ''The Two Killers of Rillington Place'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The street was close to an above-ground section of the [[Metropolitan line]] (now the [[Hammersmith &amp; City line|Hammersmith &amp; City]] and [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle]] lines), and the train noise would have been "deafening" for the occupants of 10&amp;nbsp;Rillington Place.&lt;ref name="Marston, p. 12"&gt;Marston, ''John Christie'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

After three years of working as a foreman at the Commodore Cinema in King Street, Hammersmith,&lt;Ref&gt;Page 28 - John Christie of Rillington Place - Jonathan Oates&lt;/ref&gt; at the beginning of the [[World War II|Second World War]] Christie applied to join the [[War Reserve Constable|War Reserve Police]] and was accepted, despite his criminal record, as the authorities failed to check his records.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy,''Ten Rillington Place'', pp. 40–41; the police were apparently unable to check applicants' backgrounds because of the substantial influx of new recruits during the war.&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned to the Harrow Road Police Station, where he met a woman called Gladys Jones&lt;Ref&gt;Page 33 - John Christie of Rillington Place - Jonathan Oates&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he began an affair. Their relationship lasted until mid-1943, when the woman's husband, a serving soldier, returned from the war. After learning of the affair, he went to the house where his wife was living, discovered Christie there, and assaulted him.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
Christie committed his murders over a ten-year-period between 1943-1953, usually by strangling his victims after he had rendered them unconscious with [[coal gas|domestic gas]]; some he [[rape]]d as they lay unconscious.

===First murders===
The first person Christie admitted to killing was Ruth Fuerst, a 21-year-old [[Austria]]n munitions worker who supplemented her income by occasionally engaging in prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Christie claimed to have met Fuerst while she was [[Solicitation#England and Wales|soliciting]] clients in a snack bar in [[Ladbroke Grove]]. According to his own statements, on 24 August 1943, he invited Fuerst to his home to engage in sex (his wife was visiting relatives at the time). Afterwards, Christie impulsively strangled her on his bed with a length of rope.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murders of the Black Museum'' p. 462&lt;/ref&gt; He initially stowed Fuerst's body beneath the floorboards of his living room, and buried her body in the back garden the following evening.

Soon after the murder, at the end of 1943, Christie resigned as a Special Constable.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he found new employment as a clerk at an [[Acton, London|Acton]] radio factory. There he met his second victim, colleague Muriel Amelia Eady. On 7 October 1944,&lt;ref&gt;''The Murders of the Black Museum'' p. 463&lt;/ref&gt; he invited Eady back to his flat with the promise that he had concocted a "special mixture" that could cure her [[bronchitis]].&lt;ref name="Kennedy, p. 47"&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Eady was to inhale the mixture from a jar with a tube inserted in the top. The mixture in fact was [[Tincture of benzoin|Friar's Balsam]], which Christie used to disguise the smell of domestic gas. Once Eady was seated breathing the mixture from the tube with her back turned, Christie inserted a second tube into the jar connected to a gas tap.&lt;ref name="Kennedy, p. 47"/&gt; As Eady continued breathing she inhaled the domestic gas, which soon rendered her unconscious&amp;nbsp;– domestic gas during the 1940s was [[coal gas]], which had a [[carbon monoxide]] content of 15&amp;nbsp;percent.&lt;ref&gt;Eddowes, J., ''The Two Killers of Rillington Place'', pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Once Eady was unconscious, Christie [[rape]]d and then strangled her, before burying her body alongside Fuerst's in the back garden.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murders of Beryl and Geraldine Evans===
During Easter of 1948, [[Timothy Evans]] and his wife Beryl moved into the top-floor flat at Rillington Place, where Beryl gave birth that October to their daughter, Geraldine. In late 1949, Evans informed police that his wife was dead.&lt;ref&gt;Brabin, ''Rillington Place'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A police search of 10&amp;nbsp;Rillington Place failed to find her body, but a later search revealed the bodies of Beryl Evans, her daughter, Geraldine, and a 16-week-old male foetus&lt;ref&gt;''John Christie of Rillington Place'' p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; in an outdoor wash-house. Beryl's body had been wrapped twice over in a blanket and then a table cloth. The [[autopsy|post-mortem]] revealed that both mother and daughter had been [[strangled]] and that Beryl Evans had been [[Assault|physically assaulted]] before her death, shown by facial bruising.&lt;ref&gt;Brabin, ''Rillington Place'', pp. 56–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Evans at first claimed that Christie had killed his wife in a botched [[abortion]] operation, but police questioning eventually produced a confession. The alleged confession may have been fabricated by the police themselves, as the statement appears contrived and artificial.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', pp. 90–103.&lt;/ref&gt; After being charged Evans withdrew his confession and once again accused Christie, this time of both murders.

On 11&amp;nbsp;January 1950, Evans was put on trial for the murder of his daughter, the prosecution having decided not to pursue a second charge of murdering his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', pp. 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt; Christie was a principal witness for [[The Crown#In the courts|the Crown]]: he denied Evans's accusations and gave detailed evidence about the quarrels between him and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', pp. 143–156.&lt;/ref&gt; The jury found Evans guilty despite the revelation of Christie's [[criminal record]] of [[theft]] and violence, and, after an [[appeal]] on 20 February had failed, Evans was hanged at [[HM Prison Pentonville|Pentonville Prison]] on 9 March 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', pp. 198–208.&lt;/ref&gt; Christie himself lost the job he had held for four years at the [[National Savings and Investments|Post Office Savings Bank]] due to the disclosure of his criminal convictions at the trial.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murders of the Black Museum'' p. 464&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mistakes in the investigation===
The police made several mistakes in the handling of the case, especially in overlooking the remains of Christie's previous murder victims left in the garden at Rillington Place; one [[femur]] was later found propping up a fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/rillington-place-bbc-john-christie-serial-killer-visiting-the-home-where-he-killed-adaptation-a7035831.html |title=Rillington Place: What John Christie's Residential Burial Ground Looks Like Now |work=The Independent |location=UK |accessdate=21 December 2016 |first1=Max|last1=Benwell |date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garden of the property was very small, about {{convert|16 by 14|ft}}, and the fence was parallel to the wash-house where the bodies of Beryl and Geraldine were later found. Several searches were made at the house after Evans confessed to placing his wife's remains in the drains, but the wash-house was not entered at any point by the three policemen conducting the search.&lt;ref name="Rillington Place p. 65"&gt;''John Christie of Rillington Place: Biography of a Serial Killer'' p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; The garden was apparently examined but was not excavated at this point.&lt;ref&gt;''Real-Life Crimes Issue 11'' p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; Christie later admitted that his dog had unearthed the [[human skull|skull]] of Muriel Eady in the garden shortly after these police searches, which he simply threw into an abandoned bombed-out house in nearby St. Marks Road.&lt;ref&gt;''Real-Life Crimes Issue 11'' p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; There was clearly no systematic search made of the crime scene, in which this or other human remains would have been found and pointed to Christie as the perpetrator.&lt;ref name="Rillington Place p. 65"/&gt; Several police searches of the property showed a complete lack of expertise in handling [[forensic evidence]] and were quite superficial,&lt;ref&gt;''Forensic Archaeology: A Global Perspective'' p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; at best. Had the searches been conducted effectively, the investigation would have exposed Christie as a murderer, and the lives of four women, as well as Evans's, would have been saved.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murders of the Black Museum'' pp. 489-490&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence of builders working at the house was ignored,&lt;ref&gt;''John Christie of Rillington Place: Biography of a Serial Killer'' p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; and their various interviews with Evans suggest that the police concocted a [[false confession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/john-christie-the-terrible-truth-about-rillington-place_uk_583d49a1e4b09c3be984916f|title=Rillington Place: The Terrible Truth About The Murderer John Christie |work=Huffington Post |location=UK |accessdate=21 December 2016 |first1=Sara|last1=Nelson |date=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should have been clear, for example, from the very first statement made by Evans in [[Merthyr Tydfil]], [[Wales]], on 30 November 1949, that he was totally unaware of the resting place of the body of his wife, or how she had been killed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murders of the Black Museum'' p. 466&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that his wife's body was in either a manhole or a drain at the front of the house,&lt;ref&gt;''The Murders of the Black Museum'' p. 467&lt;/ref&gt; but a police search failed to find any remains there. That in itself should have prompted a thorough search of the house, wash-house and garden, but no further action was taken until later, when the two bodies were found in the wash-house. Evans was also totally unaware at his first interview that his daughter had been killed. The police interrogation in London was mishandled from the start, when they showed him the clothes of his wife and baby and revealed that they had been found in the wash-house. Such information should have been kept from him so as to force him to tell police where the bodies had been concealed. The several apparent "confessions" contain questionable words and phrases in high-register language such as "terrific argument" which seem out of place for a distressed, uneducated, working-class young man such as Evans and bear no relation to what he probably said. These were almost certainly inventions made by the police, as [[Ludovic Kennedy]] pointed out, much later after the truth about Christie had emerged.&lt;ref&gt;''The Psychology of Interrogations and Confessions: A Handbook'' p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

The police accepted all of Christie's statements as factual without any major scrutiny,&lt;ref&gt;''The Murders of the Black Museum'' p. 476&lt;/ref&gt; and he was the crucial witness at the trial of Evans. As Kennedy noted, the police accepted the former war reserve policeman Christie as one of their own, and largely took what he said on face value without any further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''op. cit.'', p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;Bearing in mind Christie had criminal convictions for theft and malicious wounding (while Evans did not have any previous convictions for violence), the reliance on his testimony was questionable. It is significant that Christie had claimed to be an abortionist prior to his meeting the Evanses, having said so to a work colleague in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, ''op. cit.'' p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  He also repeated this claim after the Evans trial to women he spoke to in cafes, whom he possibly regarded as future potential victims. Such an approach aligns with Christie's ''modus operandi'' of offering help to women so as to gain their confidence and lure them back to his flat, as demonstrated in Muriel Eady's case.

Nearly three years passed without major incident for Christie after Evans's trial. Having lost his employment at the Post Office Savings Bank due to his criminal convictions being disclosed at Evans's trial, Christie found alternative employment as a clerk with the [[British Road Services]] at their [[Shepherd's Bush]] depot.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, new tenants arrived to fill the vacant first- and second-floor rooms at 10&amp;nbsp;Rillington Place. The tenants were predominantly [[British African-Caribbean community#The "Windrush generation"|black immigrants from the West Indies]]; this horrified the Christies, who regarded their neighbours as inferior and disliked living with them.&lt;ref name="Marston, John Christie, p. 69"&gt;Marston, ''John Christie'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions between the new tenants and the Christies came to a head when Ethel Christie prosecuted one of her neighbours for assault.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Christie successfully negotiated with the [[Law centre|Poor Man's Lawyer Centre]] to continue to have exclusive use of the back garden, ostensibly to have space between him and his neighbours but arguably to prevent anyone from uncovering the human remains buried there.&lt;ref name="Marston, John Christie, p. 69"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', pp. 210–211.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murder of Ethel Christie===
On the morning of 14&amp;nbsp;December 1952, Christie strangled Ethel in bed. She had last been seen in public two days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Christie invented several stories to explain his wife's disappearance and to help mitigate the possibility of further inquiries being made. In reply to a letter from relatives in Sheffield, he wrote that Ethel had [[rheumatism]] and could not write herself; to one neighbour, he explained that she was visiting her relatives in Sheffield; to another, he said that she had gone to [[Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', pp. 214–215.&lt;/ref&gt; Christie had resigned from his job on 6&amp;nbsp;December and had been unemployed since then. To support himself, Christie sold Ethel's wedding ring, watch, and furniture. Every week he went to the [[Employment agency|Labour Exchange]] to collect his unemployment benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Root, ''Frenzy! Heath, Haigh &amp; Christie: The First Great Tabloid Murderers''.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 January 1953&lt;ref&gt;Root, ''Frenzy! Heath, Haigh &amp; Christie: The First Great Tabloid Murderers''&lt;/ref&gt; he forged his wife's signature and emptied her bank account.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further murders===
Between 19&amp;nbsp;January and 6&amp;nbsp;March 1953, Christie murdered three more women whom he had invited back to 10&amp;nbsp;Rillington Place: Kathleen Maloney, Rita Nelson and Hectorina MacLennan. Maloney was a prostitute from the [[Ladbroke Grove]] area. Nelson was from [[Belfast]] and was visiting her sister in Ladbroke Grove when she met Christie. She was six months pregnant at the time of her murder.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', pp. 215–217.&lt;/ref&gt; Christie first met MacLennan, who was living in London with her boyfriend, Alex Baker, in a café. All three met on several occasions after this, and Christie let MacLennan and Baker stay at Rillington Place while they were looking for accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;Marston, ''John Christie'', pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion, Christie met MacLennan on her own and persuaded her to come back to his flat, where he murdered her. Later, he convinced Baker, who came to Rillington Place looking for MacLennan, that he had not seen her. Christie kept up the pretence for several days, meeting Baker regularly to see if he had news of her whereabouts and to help him search for her.&lt;ref name="Kennedy, p. 221"&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the murders of his final three victims, Christie modified the gassing technique he had first used on Muriel Eady; he simply used a rubber tube connected to the gas pipe in the kitchen which he kept closed off with a [[bulldog clip]].&lt;ref name="Kennedy, p. 216"&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; He seated his victims in the kitchen, released the clip on the tube, and let gas leak into the room. The Brabin Report pointed out that Christie's explanation of his gassing technique was not satisfactory because he would have been overpowered by the gas as well. Nevertheless, it was established that all three victims had been exposed to carbon monoxide.&lt;ref&gt;Brabin, ''Rillington Place'', pp. 220–221.&lt;/ref&gt; The gas made his victims drowsy, after which Christie strangled them with a length of rope.&lt;ref name="Kennedy, p. 216"/&gt;

As with Eady, Christie repeatedly raped his last three victims while they were unconscious and continued to do so as they died. When this aspect of his crimes was publicly revealed, Christie quickly gained a reputation for being a [[necrophilia]]c.&lt;ref&gt;Marston, ''John Christie'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; One commentator, however, has cautioned against categorising Christie as such; according to the accounts Christie gave to the police, he did not engage sexually with any of his victims exclusively after death.&lt;ref&gt;Eddowes, J., ''The Two Killers of Rillington Place'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; After Christie had murdered each of his final victims by [[strangling#Ligature strangulation|ligature strangulation]], he placed a vest or other cloth-like material between their legs&lt;ref&gt;''The Murders of the Black Museum'' p. 481&lt;/ref&gt; before wrapping their semi-naked bodies in blankets (in a similar manner to the way in which Beryl Evans's body had been wrapped),&lt;ref name="Kennedy, p. 216"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eddowes, M., ''The Man On Your Conscience'', pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; before stowing their bodies in a small alcove behind the back kitchen wall. He later covered the entrance to this alcove with wallpaper.&lt;ref&gt;"Plan of 10 Rillington Place showing position of the bodies", Brabin, ''Rillington Place'', p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
Christie moved out of 10 Rillington Place on 20 March 1953,&lt;ref&gt;Brabin, ''Rillington  Place'', p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; after fraudulently sub-letting his flat to a couple from whom he took £7 13s 0d (£7.65 or about £{{Inflation|UK|7.65|1953|r=0}} as of {{Inflation-year|UK}}&lt;ref&gt;See [[template:inflation]] for how this figure was calculated.&lt;/ref&gt;). The landlord visited that same evening and, finding the couple there instead of Christie, demanded that they leave first thing the next morning.&lt;ref name="Kennedy, p. 221"/&gt; The landlord then allowed the tenant of the top-floor flat, Beresford Brown, to use Christie's kitchen. On 24&amp;nbsp;March, Brown discovered the kitchen alcove when he attempted to insert brackets into the wall to hold a wireless set. Peeling back the wallpaper, Brown saw the bodies of Maloney, Nelson and MacLennan. After getting confirmation from another tenant in 10&amp;nbsp;Rillington Place that they were dead bodies, Brown informed the police and a citywide search for Christie began.

After he left Rillington Place, Christie went to a [[Rowton Houses|Rowton House]] in [[Kings Cross, London|King's Cross]], where he booked a room for seven nights under his real name and address. He stayed for only four nights, leaving on 24&amp;nbsp;March when news of the discovery at his flat broke,&lt;ref name="Kennedy, p. 222"&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; after which he wandered around London, spending much of his time in cafés.&lt;ref name="Kennedy, p. 222"/&gt;  On the morning of 31&amp;nbsp;March Christie was arrested on the embankment near [[Putney Bridge]] after being challenged about his identity by a police officer; all he had in his possession were some coins and an old newspaper clipping about the [[Remand (detention)|remand]] of Timothy Evans.&lt;ref&gt;Eddowes, J., ''The Two Killers of Rillington Place'', p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction and execution==
While in [[arrest|custody]], Christie confessed to seven murders: the three women found in the kitchen alcove, his wife, and the two women buried in the back garden. He also admitted being responsible for the murder of Beryl Evans, which Timothy Evans had originally been charged with during the police investigation in 1949, although for the most part he denied killing Geraldine Evans.&lt;ref&gt;Marston, ''John Christie'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, on one occasion following his trial, Christie indicated that he may have been responsible for her death as well, having said so to a hospital orderly.&lt;ref&gt;Brabin, ''op. cit.'', pp.212-213&lt;/ref&gt;  It is speculated that Christie would not have wanted to readily admit his guilt in Geraldine's death in order to not lose all respect from the jury and for his own safety from his fellow inmates.&lt;ref&gt;Marston, ''op. cit.'', pp.86-87&lt;/ref&gt;

Christie was tried only for the murder of his wife Ethel. His trial began on 22&amp;nbsp;June 1953, in the same court in which Evans had been tried three years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Christie [[insanity plea|pleaded insanity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=19530625&amp;id=QP9NAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=34sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2972,729770&amp;hl=en|title=Confessed Murderer of 7 Women Must Die in London|access-date=January 7, 2017|newspaper=The Free Lance-Star|date=June 25, 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed to have a poor memory of the events.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Matheson, a doctor at Brixton Prison who evaluated Christie, was called as a witness by the prosecution. He testified that Christie had a [[histrionic personality disorder|hysterical personality]] but was not insane.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Honeycombe. “Murder of the Black Museum 1875-1975.” John Blake Publishing, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The jury rejected Christie's plea, and after deliberating for 85&amp;nbsp;minutes found him guilty.&lt;ref&gt;Marston, ''John Christie'', p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Christie did not [[appeal]] against his conviction, and on 15&amp;nbsp;July 1953 he was hanged at Pentonville Prison. His executioner was [[Albert Pierrepoint]], who had previously hanged Evans.&lt;ref&gt;Marston, ''John Christie'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; After being pinioned for execution, Christie complained that his nose itched. Pierrepoint assured him that "It won't bother you for long".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1515209/My-father-deserved-to-be-hanged-by-Pierrepoint.html | location=London | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | first1=Adam | last1=Lusher | first2=Alan | last2=Rimmer | title=My father deserved to be hanged by Pierrepoint | date=9 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other murders===
Based on the pubic hair that Christie collected from his victims, it has been speculated that he was responsible for more murders than those carried out at 10&amp;nbsp;Rillington Place. Christie claimed that the four different clumps of hair in his collection came from his wife and the three bodies discovered in the kitchen alcove, but only one matched the hair type on those bodies, Ethel Christie's. Even if two of the others had come from the bodies of Fuerst and Eady, which had by then decomposed into skeletons,&lt;ref name="Simpson, p. 206"&gt;Simpson, ''Forty Years of Murder:  An Autobiography'', p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; there was still one remaining clump of hair unaccounted for—it could not have come from Beryl Evans, as no pubic hair had been removed from her body.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, ''Forty Years of Murder:  An Autobiography'', pp. 198–200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1978 [[Keith Simpson (pathologist)|Professor Keith Simpson]], one of the [[pathologist]]s involved in the [[forensic science|forensic examination]] of Christie's victims, had this to say about the pubic hair collection:

{{quote|It seems odd that Christie should have said hair came from the bodies in the alcove if in fact it had come from those now reduced to skeletons; not very likely that in his last four murders the only trophy he took was from the one woman with whom he did not have peri-mortal sexual intercourse; and even more odd that one of his trophies had definitely not come from any of the unfortunate women known to have been involved.&lt;ref name="Simpson, p. 206"/&gt;}}

However, no attempts were or have been made to trace any further victims of Christie, such as examining records of missing women in London during his period of activity. In his 1995 book ''The Two Killers of Rillington Place'' John Eddowes, son of lawyer [[Michael Eddowes]], suggested that Christie had been in a perfect position, as a [[special police constable]] during the war, to have committed many more murders than have been discovered.

==Innocence of Timothy Evans==
{{Main|Timothy Evans}}
Following Christie's conviction there was substantial controversy concerning the earlier trial of Evans, who had been convicted mainly on the evidence of a serial killer living in the same property in which Evans had allegedly carried out his crimes.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Marston's summary of barrister [[Geoffrey Bing]]'s criticism of the trial, p. 100: "Bing pointed out that Evans's guilt depended on two incredible coincidences. The first was that two murderers, living in the same house but acting independently, strangled women... The second was as extraordinary as the first: that Evans accused the one man in London who was strangling women in the identical way that he, Evans, had strangled his wife and child."&lt;/ref&gt; Christie confessed to Beryl Evans' murder and although he neither confessed to, nor was charged with, Geraldine Evans' murder, he was widely considered guilty of both murders at the time.&lt;ref name="Eddowes pp. xiv–xviii"&gt;Eddowes, J., ''The Two Killers of Rillington Place'', pp. xiv–xviii details the pervasiveness of the view that Evans was innocent and the subsequent campaign undertaken to overturn his conviction.&lt;/ref&gt;  This, in turn, cast doubt on the fairness of Evans' trial and raised the possibility that an innocent person had been hanged.&lt;ref name="Eddowes pp. xiv–xviii"/&gt;

The controversy prompted the then Home Secretary, [[David Maxwell-Fyfe]], to commission an inquiry led by John Scott Henderson, [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], the [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] of [[Portsmouth]], to determine whether Evans had been innocent of his crimes and if a miscarriage of justice had occurred. Scott Henderson interviewed Christie before his execution, as well as another twenty witnesses who had been involved in either of the police investigations. He concluded that Evans was in fact guilty of both murders and that Christie's confessions to the murder of Beryl Evans were unreliable and made in the context of furthering his own defence that he was insane.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, John Scott (1953). "Report By Mr. J. Scott Henderson, Q.C., Presented by the Secretary of State for the Home Department to Parliament", reprinted in Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', pp. 249–297.&lt;/ref&gt;

Far from ending the matter, questions continued to be raised in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] concerning Evans's innocence,&lt;ref&gt;Eddowes, J., ''The Two Killers of Rillington Place'', pp. 98–100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1953/oct/22/timothy-john-evans-inquiry|date=22 October 1953|title=Timothy John Evans (Inquiry)|work=Hansard|access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with newspaper campaigns and books being published making similar claims.&lt;ref&gt;Marston, ''John Christie'', pp. 104–105 lists Michael Eddowes's ''The Man On Your Conscience'', F. Tennyson Jesse's ''The Trials of Timothy John Evans and John Reginald Halliday Christie'' and Kennedy's own ''Ten Rillington Place'' as being particularly instrumental in keeping the issue of the miscarriage of justice alive.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Scott Henderson Inquiry was criticised for being held over too short a time period (one week) and for being prejudiced against the possibility that Evans was innocent.&lt;ref&gt;Marston, ''John Christie'', p. 96, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Ten Rillington Place'', pp. 282–285.&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy, along with the coincidence that two stranglers would have been living in the same property at the same time if Evans and Christie had both been guilty, kept alive the issue that a [[miscarriage of justice]] had taken place in Evans's trial.&lt;ref&gt;Eddowes, J., ''The Two Killers of Rillington Place'', p. xvi considers Kennedy's ''Ten Rillington Place'' and a newspaper campaign run by the editor of the ''Northern Echo'' as being effective in maintaining the view that Evans was innocent after the Scott Henderson Inquiry.&lt;/ref&gt;

This uncertainty led to a second inquiry, chaired by High Court judge, Sir [[Daniel Brabin]], which was conducted over the winter of 1965–66. Brabin re-examined much of the evidence from both cases and evaluated some of the arguments for Evans's innocence. His conclusions were that it was "more probable than not" that Evans had killed his wife but not his daughter Geraldine, for whose death Christie was responsible. Christie's likely motive was that her continued presence would have drawn attention to Beryl's disappearance, which Christie would have been averse to as it increased the risk that his own murders would be discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Brabin, ''Rillington Place'', p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;  Brabin also noted, however, that the uncertainty involved in the case would have prevented a jury from being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of Evans's guilt had he been re-tried.&lt;ref&gt;Brabin, ''Rillington Place'', p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; These conclusions were used by the Home Secretary, [[Roy Jenkins]], to recommend a posthumous pardon for Timothy Evans, which was granted, as Evans had been tried and executed for the murder of his daughter.&lt;ref name="Marston, p. 106"&gt;Marston, ''John Christie'', p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mary Westlake v Criminal Cases Review Commission"&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants = Mary Westlake v Criminal Cases Review Commission | court = EWHC | division = Admin | year = 2004 | num = 2779 | date = 17 November 2004 | courtname = auto | accessdate =22 September 2009 }}. It includes a segment from the Hansard transcript of Jenkins's decision to recommend a pardon in the House of Commons.&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins announced the granting of Evans's pardon to the House of Commons on 18&amp;nbsp;October 1966.&lt;ref name="Mary Westlake v Criminal Cases Review Commission"/&gt; It allowed authorities to return Evans's remains to his family, who had him reburied in a private grave.&lt;ref name="Marston, p. 106"/&gt;

There was already debate in the United Kingdom over the continued use of the death penalty in the legal system. The controversy generated by Evans's case, along with a number of other controversial cases from the same time, contributed to the 1965 suspension, and subsequent abolition, of [[capital punishment in the United Kingdom]] for murder.&lt;ref name="Marston, p. 108"/&gt;

==Later developments==
In 1954, the year after Christie's execution, Rillington Place was renamed Ruston Close, but number 10 continued in multiple occupation. The three families living there in 1970 refused to move out for the shooting of the 1971 film ''[[10 Rillington Place]]'', which was therefore filmed in the empty number 6. The house and street were demolished later, and the area has changed beyond all recognition. Bartle Road, London W11, now approximates the line of Rillington Place, and a small garden occupies the site where No. 10 once stood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Max |last=Benwell |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/rillington-place-bbc-john-christie-serial-killer-visiting-the-home-where-he-killed-adaptation-a7035831.html|title=Revisiting the crimes and home of one of Britain's worst serial killers|date=18 May 2016|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2003 the [[Home Office]] awarded Timothy Evans's half-sister, Mary Westlake, and his sister, Eileen Ashby, ''ex-gratia'' payments as compensation for the miscarriage of justice in Timothy Evans's trial. The independent assessor for the Home Office, [[Daniel Brennan, Baron Brennan|Lord Brennan]] QC, accepted that "the conviction and execution of Timothy Evans for the murder of his child was wrongful and a miscarriage of justice" and that "there is no evidence to implicate Timothy Evans in the murder of his wife. She was most probably murdered by Christie."&lt;ref&gt;''A House to Remember: 10 Rillington Place'' {{ISBN|978-1-908-22338-8}} p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Brennan believed that the Brabin Report's conclusion that Evans probably murdered his wife should be rejected given Christie's confessions and conviction.&lt;ref name="Mary Westlake v Criminal Cases Review Commission"/&gt;

==Media==

===Theatre===
* September 1969 saw the opening of ''[[Christie in Love]]'', a play by [[Howard Brenton]] which relates Christie's murders and psychological abnormality to violence and sadism in society as a whole. It has been revived several times since.

===Film===
* The murders committed by John Christie were dramatised in the 1971 film ''[[10 Rillington Place]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Richard Attenborough]], who spoke of his ambivalence concerning the role: "I do not like playing the part, but I accepted it at once without seeing the script. I have never felt so totally involved in any part as this. It is a most devastating statement on capital punishment."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Christie's ghost returns |date=18 May 1970 |periodical=[[The Times]] |page=5 |issue=57872 |url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/842/399/60784594w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS84243122&amp;dyn=3!xrn_4_0_CS84243122&amp;hst_1?sw_aep=mclib |subscription=yes |accessdate=18 April 2009 |postscript=.}}{{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
* In 2016 the [[BBC]] commissioned a three-part biographical crime drama focusing on the Christie murders. This series, ''[[Rillington Place]]'', was broadcast between November and December 2016 and stars [[Tim Roth]] as John Christie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-12-13/rillington-places-tim-roth-on-playing-serial-killer-john-christie-i-thought-my-god-what-have-i-got-into|title=Rillington Place's Tim Roth on Playing Serial Killer John Christie: "I thought 'My God, What Have I Got Into?'"|publisher=radiotimes.com|date=2016-12-13 |accessdate=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
* Australian artist [[Brett Whiteley]] produced a series of paintings based on the Christie murders while living in London in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/collection/work/3207/|title=10 Rillington Place - Brett WHITELEY - NGV - View Work|website=www.ngv.vic.gov.au|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jonathan Browning''' (October 22, 1805 &amp;ndash; June 21, 1879) was an American inventor and gunmaker.

==Early life==
Born in [[Sumner County, Tennessee]], he started earning a living as a blacksmith and later switched to become a lock and gunsmith.  He invented a "sliding breech" repeating rifle also called a [[Harmonica gun]] between 1834 and 1842 while living in [[Quincy, Illinois]].  He achieved success with the [[Harmonica gun]], and he received many orders. It is estimated that each [[Harmonica gun]] took 2 weeks to make, and Browning sold the guns for twenty-four dollars.

With his local prominence in [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]], Browning was elected the justice of the peace. He came to know a young lawyer by the name of [[Abraham Lincoln]] who was an overnight guest in his home on at least two occasions.

==Missouri period==
In October 1838, Governor [[Lilburn Boggs]] issued the [[Extermination Order (Mormonism)|Extermination Order]] that caused the followers of [[Joseph Smith]] to flee [[Missouri]]. In his capacity as a judge, Browning came into contact with many of the [[Latter-day Saint]] exiles. Curious about the new settlement in the swampy lands of [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], Browning paid a visit to [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. His meeting with [[President of the Church|church president]] [[Joseph Smith]] led Browning to convert to the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]].&lt;!-- Do not change this name to "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints". In the original text of the revelation, as referenced in this article, Smith wrote the name of the church "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints" --&gt;.&lt;ref name = 1838name1&gt;''Manuscript History of the Church'', LDS Church Archives, book A-1, p. 37; reproduced in Dean C. Jessee (comp.) (1989). ''The Papers of Joseph Smith: Autobiographical and Historical Writings'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) '''1''':302–03.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 1838name2&gt;H. Michael Marquardt and Wesley P. Walters (1994). ''Inventing Mormonism: Tradition and the Historical Record'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books) p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  His conversion led to him being ostracized by the community in [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]].  Browning sold his gun shop and land in [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]].

==Nauvoo period==
[[Image:Browning Gun Label.jpg|thumb|200px|The label on a Browning gun from the Nauvoo period, stating: "Holiness to the Lord - Our Preservation."]]
Browning  moved to [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] and joined the LDS community in 1840, where, in 1843, he briefly established a gun shop. A year later, LDS leader [[Joseph Smith]] was assassinated, and Browning was among the group which later fled Nauvoo.

Guns that Browning produced as a Mormon gunsmith were labeled "Holiness to the Lord - Our Preservation." The Jonathan Browning Home and Gunshop built in 1842 was restored during the 1960s. Registered with The Mormon Historic Sites Foundation, the museum is open to the public at no charge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mormonhistoricsites.org/jonathan-browning-home-and-gunshop/ Mormon Historical Sites] "Jonathan Browning Home and Gunshop, Nauvoo, Illinois", Retrieved July 26, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Utah period==
Browning fled Illinois with [[Brigham Young]] in late 1846 to escape religious persecution.  He settled in the temporary community of [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] (then called Kanesville in honor of [[Thomas L. Kane]]) and repaired guns for the local settlers who were migrating to [[Utah]].  He was awaiting [[Brigham Young]] to invite him to join the main body of settlers in [[Utah]]. When the [[Mormon Battalion]] was formed during the War with Mexico, Browning wanted to join them, but was told by [[Brigham Young|Young]] that his skills would not be needed by the soldiers as much as they would by the main body of pioneers in Kanesville.

As was common in the community at that time, Jonathan Browning was a [[polygamy|polygamist]], having taken three wives. He fathered 24 children; prominent among them was the gun designer, [[John Browning|John Moses Browning]], one of the most important figures in the development of modern automatic and semi-automatic firearms.

Browning received the word from Brigham Young to join the main party of settlers in 1852. He left his gunshop in Iowa July 8, 1852 and migrated across the [[Rocky Mountains]] as the captain of the Henry W. Miller Company.  He arrived October 2, 1852, with six wagons and six hundred dollars in the [[Salt Lake Valley]]. Browning moved to [[Ogden, Utah]] and established a gun shop there.  His activities were limited to repairs in the [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]] shop, however. His son [[John Browning|John Moses]] recalled, "We ridiculed some of the guns we fixed, and I damned some of them when Pappy wasn't near, but it never occurred to us to make better ones. He was too old, and I was too young."  Browning died June 21, 1879 in Ogden.

===Seattle Sounders===
After winning the [[NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship]], there was plenty of speculation that Morris would begin to play professionally. Coach [[Jürgen Klinsmann]] stated that Morris "obviously has to" turn pro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/united-states/story/2760910/jordan-morris-obviously-has-to-turn-pro-jurgen-klinsmann|title=Jordan Morris 'obviously has to' turn pro - Jurgen Klinsmann - ESPN FC|work=ESPNFC.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 5, 2016, Morris announced he decided to forgo his senior season at Stanford to turn pro. It was widely speculated that Morris would sign with the [[Seattle Sounders FC|Sounders]], the club for which his father works, and also holds his amateur rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/sports/ci_29346591/stanford-soccer-star-jordan-morris-turning-pro|title=Stanford soccer star Jordan Morris turning pro|date=January 5, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 21, 2016, Morris signed with [[Seattle Sounders FC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Carlisle |first=Jeff |date=January 21, 2016 |title=U.S. striker Jordan Morris seals deal with Seattle Sounders |url=http://www.espnfc.us/seattle-sounders-fc/story/2791152/us-striker-jordan-morris-seals-deal-with-seattle-sounders |work=ESPNFC.com |accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the Sounders' preseason training camp in [[Arizona]], debuting in a friendly against [[Celaya F.C.]] on February 9, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pentz |first=Matt |date=February 9, 2016 |title=First impressions: Jordan Morris makes preseason debut as Seattle Sounders fall 2-1 |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/sounders/first-impressions-jordan-morris-makes-preseason-debut-as-seattle-sounders-fall-2-1/ |newspaper=The Seattle Times |accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 23, 2016, Morris made his professional debut against [[Club América]] in the [[CONCACAF Champions League]], starting the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=February 24, 2016 |title=Sounders FC earns 2-2 home draw against reigning CONCACAF champion Club America to open 2016 season |url=http://www.soundersfc.com/post/2016/02/24/sounders-fc-earns-2-2-home-draw-against-reigning-concacaf-champion-club-america-open |work=SoundersFC.com |accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, he debuted in the Sounders' first [[Major League Soccer]] game of the season against [[Sporting Kansas City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Liljenwall |first=Ari |date=March 6, 2016 |title=Jordan Morris debuts with near miss as Seattle Sounders drop first home opener in three seasons |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/03/06/jordan-morris-debuts-near-miss-seattle-sounders-drop-first-home-opener-three-seasons |work=MLSsoccer.com |accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris scored his first Major League Soccer goal for the Sounders on April 16, 2016, against the [[Philadelphia Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pentz |first=Matt |date=April 16, 2016 |title=Jordan Morris nets first MLS goal in Sounders’ 2-1 win |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/sounders/jordan-morris-nets-first-mls-goal-in-sounders-2-1-win/ |newspaper=The Seattle Times |accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on to score in his next three consecutive games, matching the Seattle rookie scoring record, his next goal then surpassed the rookie goalscoring record which had been set by [[Steve Zakuani]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ruiz |first=Don |date=May 7, 2016 |title=Sounders continue streak, 2-0 over San Jose |url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/sports/soccer/mls/sounders-fc/sounders-insider-blog/article76387367.html |newspaper=The News Tribune |accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since helped his team to win the [[MLS Cup 2016|MLS Cup]] after a run from ninth place into fourth, along with the help of [[Nicolas Lodeiro]], a new midseason acquisition made by Seattle.

====Werder Bremen trial====
On January 5, 2016, it was reported that Morris was set to train with [[SV Werder Bremen]] at their winter camp, which Bremen chief executive [[Thomas Eichin]] claimed was "an opportunity for us to get to know the player better. Nothing more and nothing less".

Prince '''Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha''' (1757–1798) was a [[Poland|Polish]]-[[Lithuania]]n noble ([[szlachcic]]) and one the creators of the [[3 May Constitution]].

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Kazimierz Sapieha was educated at the [[Corps of Cadets (Warsaw)|Knight School]] in [[Warsaw]] from 1767 until 1771, and later studied in [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-197-198"/&gt; Upon his return he served as [[Artillery General of Lithuania]], from 1773 to 1793.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-197-198"/&gt; As Deputy from [[Brzesc Litewski]], he participated in several [[Sejm]]s.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-197-198"/&gt; Most notably, from 1790 he participated in the [[Sejm Wielki|Four-Year Sejm]] in Warsaw, and became [[Sejm Marshal]] from 6 October 1788 until 29 May 1792, and Marshal of the Lithuanian [[Confederation]].&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-197-198"/&gt;

===Politics===
An early supporter of the [[magnate]] opposition to any liberalization (his uncle [[Hetman]] [[Franciszek Ksawery Branicki]] was its leader), Sapieha changed his position under the influence of [[Stanisław Małachowski]], and became a supporter of reforms, and the [[3 May Constitution]].&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-197-198"/&gt; He strongly protested, when King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] joined the [[Targowica Confederation]], and this so angered Sapieha, that he decided to leave Poland. He briefly settled in [[Dresden]].&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-197-198"/&gt; After the outbreak of the [[Kościuszko Uprising]], he returned to his homeland and participated in the uprising, holding the rank of an Artillery Captain.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-197-198"/&gt; After the Uprising collapsed, he left Poland again, and spent the rest of his life in [[exile]] in [[Vienna]], where he died 1798.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-197-198"/&gt;

==Awards==
* Knight of the [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]], awarded on January 1, 1779.

'''Leonard Jacobson''' (born October 28, 1944 in [[Melbourne]], Australia) is a spiritual teacher and author.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tim Miejan (January 2008). "Awakening: An interview with Leonard Jacobson", ''The Edge Magazine.''&lt;/ref&gt; He resides in Wayzata near [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] and offers workshops and retreats throughout the U.S., Europe, Australia and Asia.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Jacobson, (May/ June 2011 Volume 18 Number 3). "Conscious Relationships", ''Awareness Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;CC Gevry (March 9, 2011). "Interview with Leonard Jacobson, Author of In Search of the Light", ''The Children’s and Teens Book Connection''. Retrieved January 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobson is the author of five books: Words from Silence, Journey into Now,  In Search of the Light,  Embracing the Present and Bridging Heaven &amp; Earth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They have been translated and published in several countries including South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, China, Holland, Denmark, Poland and Lithuania. His children’s book, In Search of the Light, was a winner of the Indie Excellence Book Award.&lt;ref&gt;Indie Excellence Book Awards (2011). http://www.indieexcellence.com/indie-results-2011.htm  Retrieved January 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the founder of the Conscious Living Foundation, a registered non-profit organization established to support the awakening of human consciousness and to make his teachings widely available.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Tim Meijan (July 2009). "Embracing the Present: A Moment with Leonard Jacobson", ''The Edge Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

As a mark of honor and recognition to his selfless efforts in spiritual awakening, [[Religious Science|Religious Science International]], a voluntary association that promotes Science of Mind, awarded Leonard Jacobson the Peace Prize in 2005.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Science and Non-Duality (2015). "Leonard Jacobson: Teacher and Author", http://www.scienceandnonduality.com/speakers/leonard-jacobson/ Retrieved December 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Leonard Jacobson was educated at the [[University of Melbourne]], graduating with a law degree in 1969. He practiced law until 1979. He then set off on a long journey of spiritual discovery, which took him all over the world, from the United States to the Middle East, India, and Japan.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Teaching ==
Jacobson teaches a two-step path of awakening. The first step involves learning the art of being present. The second involves becoming a master of your mind and ego. Both steps are necessary for true awakening.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Foreword Reviews (April 10, 2007). "Book Reviews: Journey Into Now", Retrieved January 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, (July 10, 2014). "In the Present Moment There are no Problems", ''Gaia.com''. http://www.gaia.com/article/spirituality-101-how-become-more-spiritual-your-daily-life Retrieved January 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
 
"Jacobson’s message is that by learning the art of being fully present in the moment, it is possible to awaken now." &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In an interview with The Edge Magazine, he states, "to be awake is as simple as being fully present in the moment of now. If you’re fully present with something that’s actually here in the moment with you, your mind will fall silent, thoughts will stop, and you’ll be awake in the truth of life." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the most differentiating aspects of Jacobson’s teaching is his practical approach to integrating awakened consciousness into everyday life and relationships.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacobson|first=|date=September 2016|title=Overcoming the Obstacles to Awakening|url=|journal=Inner Directions Journal|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;He is described as having a unique insight into the nature of the mind and ego.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Jacobson emphasizes that the process of awakening must involve a recognition of what the ego is, its role and purpose, how it functions, and how to overcome its resistance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Jacobson is sometimes referred to as a [[Nondualism|non-dual]] spiritual teacher.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; His teachings have been compared to those of [[Eckhart Tolle]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcus T. Anthony, Ph.D (February 22, 2012). ''Discover Your Soul Template: 14 Steps for Awakening Integrated Intelligence'', Inner Traditions {{ISBN|978-1594774263}} p.239&lt;/ref&gt;

him whether he had anything of importance to communicate, and in the
customary rhymes of saj' (light poems) he told him in reply to the question whether any king would fight with Tubba', "No, but the king of Ghassan had a son whose kingdom would be surpassed by a man of great piety, helped by the Almighty, described in the Psalms (of the Israelites); his people would be favoured by revelation, he would dispel darkness by light, Ahmad the prophet. How blessed his people when he comes, one of the descendants of '''Lu'ayy''' from Banu Qusayy.     Tubba' sent for a copy of the psalms, examined them, and found the description of the prophet."

Lu'ay's grandson [[Qusay]] who conquered Mecca for Quraish said a poem taking pride in his grandfather '''Lu'ay''':

:I am the son of the protectors from Lu'ayy 
          
:in Mecca is my house where I grew.      
        
:mine is the valley as Ma'add knows,           
       
:It is Marwa I delight in,        
          
:I did not have to battle, had not,     
              
:the sons of [[Qedar]] and [[Nabit]] settled here,        
       
:Rizh is my helper I fear no injustice as long as I live".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |author=Ibn Ishaq |author-link=Ibn Ishaq |translator= Alfred Guillaume |translator-link= Alfred Guillaume |title=The Life of Muhammad: A Translation of Ibn Isḥāq’s sīrat|url= https://archive.org/stream/TheLifeOfMohammedGuillaume/The_Life_Of_Mohammed_Guillaume#page/n73/mode/2up |location=London |isbn=0195778286 |year=1955|page=696,54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magomed Tolboev''' (Магомед Толбоев, born 20 January 1951) is a former high-profile [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era [[test pilot]] who initially came to public attention as a test pilot for the [[Buran space shuttle]]. He is from [[Dagestan]]. He continued his career after the collapse of the Soviet Union, working on both civilian and military aircraft in [[Russia]], and held several governmental appointments including in the Aviation Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tolboev.ru/biograph_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He was decorated with the title [[Hero of Russia]] and other honours before retiring from active service. He continues to be a part-time consultant and commentator on aviation issues.

Tolboev was the focus of international attention due to an attack on him by individuals from the [[Moscow]] police department. Some have claimed the attack was racially motivated because Tolboev had "[[Chechen people|Chechen]] features." Though charges were not brought up by Tolboev, the Moscow police have looked into the incident. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050222004701/http://www.fsumonitor.com/stories/091004Russ2.shtml]

'''Martin Savage''' ({{lang-ga|Máirtín Sabhaois}}; 12 October 1897 &amp;ndash; 19 December 1919) was an [[Officer (armed forces)|Officer]] in the Dublin Brigade of the [[Irish Republican Army]], from [[Ballisodare]], [[County Sligo]].&lt;ref name="1901 Census Search"&gt;Roger McDonnell&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 December 1919 he was killed in a gun battle during an [[ambush]] at [[Ashtown (Dublin)|Ashtown]], near the  border of [[County Meath]] and [[County Dublin]], during the early stages of the [[Irish War of Independence]].

==Early life==
Savage was born in Streamstown, [[Ballisodare]], [[County Sligo]] on 12 October 1897. He was the youngest son of Michael Savage who was known locally as a [[Fenian]] activist&lt;ref name="McTernan 1994 210"&gt;{{cite book |last=McTernan |first=John C. |title=Worthies Of Sligo, Profiles of Eminent Sligonians of Other Days |year=1994 |publisher=Avena Publications |location=Sligo|isbn=0-9520594-3-6|chapter=Patriot sons and daughters|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bridget Savage; formerly Gildea.

== Military action ==
Savage moved to [[Dublin]] in 1915 and joined the [[Irish Volunteers]]. As a 17-year-old he took part in the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] in Dublin and fought at the Four Courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roll of Honour|url=http://the1916proclamation.ie/the-roll-honour/s/|website=1916 proclamation|ref=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was captured by the [[British Army]] and imprisoned in [[Richmond Barracks]]. On 30 April 1916 he was deported to [[Knutsford]] Detention Barracks in [[Cheshire]], [[England]] along with 200 other captured prisoners.  Upon his release Savage returned to Dublin and re-engaged in paramilitary activity and became a [[Lieutenant]] in the 2nd Battalion of the Dublin Brigade. Within republican circles he was known as a shy, slim built, handsome Sligonian who was a popular and trusted especially amongst the likes of [[Dan Breen]], [[Seán Treacy]] and [[Seán Hogan]].&lt;ref name="McTernan 1994 210"/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;''My Fight For Irish Freedom'', Dan Breen, 1989. PB) {{ISBN|0-947962-33-6}} p.85, p.90 - p.95, p.168&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Ashtown ambush ==

===Planning by Breen===
On 19 December 1919, Savage and 10 fellow Fenian paramilitaries, including Mick McDonnell, Tom Kehoe, [[Seán Treacy]], [[Séamus Robinson (Irish republican)|Séamus Robinson]], [[Seán Hogan]], [[Paddy Daly]] (Leader), Vincent Byrne, Tom Kilcoyne, Joe Leonard and [[Dan Breen]], met after planning to assassinate the then British [[Viceroy]], [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] and Supreme Commander of the British Army in Ireland, [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Lord John French]], as he returned from a private party which he had hosted the previous evening at his country residence in [[Frenchpark]], [[County Roscommon]].&lt;ref&gt;''My Fight For Irish Freedom'', Dan Breen, 1989. PB) {{ISBN|0-947962-33-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not originally planned that Savage was to take an active part in the ambush, however, after a chance meeting with Breen and Hogan, Savage insisted that he join the ambushing force. Sean Hogan initially attempted to dissuade him, but relented and gave Savage an automatic pistol. The unit's intelligence operative had informed it that Lord French would be travelling in the second car of the armed convoy that comprised an outrider and three following cars, which would bring Lord French from Ashtown railway station to the Vice-Regal Lodge in [[Phoenix Park]], Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=| title=Remembering Martin Savage| work=[[An Phoblacht]]| url=http://www.anphoblacht.com/news/detail/7791| accessdate=17 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events of the day===
On the day of the ambush, Savage attended work as usual and slipped away early in the morning to meet with the other men who were to take part in the attack who were gathered at Fleming's Pub in [[Drumcondra, Dublin|Drumcondra]]. They departed Drumcondra in small groups to avoid raising suspicion as they cycled through [[Phibsboro]] and up the [[Cabra, Dublin|Cabra]] Road, and then regrouped at Kelly's Public House (now called the Halfway House) in Ashtown. At approximately 11:40&amp;nbsp;a.m., as the train carrying Lord French pulled into the station, they left the pub and took up positions along the crossroads at Ashtown.

The plan was for Martin Savage, Tom Kehoe and Dan Breen to push a hay-cart halfway across the road and then, after the out-rider and the first car had passed, they would push it the rest of the way across the road, thereby completely blocking the path of the remaining vehicles. They had been informed that Lord French was to be in the second car and this car they intended to attack with [[Mills Bomb]]s and rifle fire.

As they pushed the hay-cart across the road their plan was almost foiled as a member of the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC) disturbed them, telling them to move on. One of them threw a grenade at him, although it didn't explode it struck the police officer on the head, knocking him unconscious. The police officer was then dragged from the road and the attack went ahead as planned.&lt;ref name="Christmas week ambush"&gt;Wayne Sugg&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lord French's car and the gun battle===
When the convoy appeared minutes later the attack commenced, forcing the target second car in the convoy to swerve off the road. However, unknown to the attackers Lord French was travelling in the first car, which managed to drive through the blockade. The occupants of the second car, part of Lord French's guard, returned fire. As the gun battle developed the third car of the convoy arrived on the other side of the cart, and its occupants began firing with rifles on the now exposed ambushing force. In the exchange of fire Breen was shot in the leg, and seconds later Savage fell mortally wounded after being hit by a bullet in the neck. He died in the arms of Breen and his last words to Breen were "I'm done, but carry on....". Tom Kehoe and the wounded Breen succeeded in carrying Savage's body from the road and back to Kelly’s Pub while the gun battle continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=| title=No Fear!| work=[[TIME Magazine]]| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,743678,00.html| accessdate=17 June 2007 | date=9 May 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Royal Irish Constabulary police officers and a driver were also wounded in the gun battle. At this point the British military, including some wounded, began to withdraw from the scene and continued on towards the Phoenix Park. Knowing British reinforcements would be on their way, the IRA unit itself dispersing to safe houses in the Dublin area. Breen was helped onto his bike by [[Paddy Daly]] who helped him to a safehouse in the Phibsboro' area, where he was medically treated to by the captain of the [[Dublin]] [[hurling]] team, Dr J.M. Ryan.

The next morning, the ''Irish Independent'' published an article which described the attackers as "assassins" and included other such terms as "criminal folly", "outrage" and "murder." Taking these terms as an insult to their dead comrade, it was decided to attack the newspaper's offices. On Sunday, at 9pm, between twenty and thirty IRA men under the direction of [[Peadar Clancy]] entered the offices of the ''Independent'' where they proceeded to wreck its machinery of production. Despite this, with the assistance of the other Dublin newspapers, the ''Independent'' was able to appear the next day, and the owners were awarded £16,000 pounds in compensation. According to Breen in his memoir, neither the ''Independent'', nor any other Dublin newspaper, ever dared refer to the IRA as 'murderers or assassins' again.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Breen, ''My Fight for Irish Freedom'', [Talbot Press, 1924], 1989, {{ISBN|978-0-947962-33-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funeral ==
Savage's body was taken by British military and an inquest was held into his death. The inquest was attended by his brother and his employer William Kirk, who described the dead soldier as "a steady, sober and industrious young man, gentlemanly in manner and extremely courteous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McTernan |first=John C. |title=Worthies Of Sligo, Profiles of Eminent Sligonians of Other Days |year=1994 |publisher=Avena Publications |location=Sligo|isbn=0-9520594-3-6|chapter=Patriot sons and daughters|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the inquest, Savage's body was handed over to his relatives. His remains lay overnight at [[Broadstone (Dublin) railway station|Broadstone Station]] before departing for Sligo where it was met at [[Collooney railway station]] by a large crowd.&lt;ref&gt;''My Fight For Irish Freedom'', Dan Breen, 1989. PB) {{ISBN|0-947962-33-6}} p.94&lt;/ref&gt; His coffin, draped in an Irish [[Tricolour (flag)|Tricolour]], was carried over two miles at shoulder height to his family's burial ground. It was buried with military honours in his native Ballisodare, County Sligo.&lt;ref name="McTernan 1994 209–215"&gt;{{cite book |last=McTernan |first=John C. |title=Worthies Of Sligo, Profiles of Eminent Sligonians of Other Days |year=1994 |publisher=Avena Publications |location=Sligo|isbn=0-9520594-3-6|pages=209–215|chapter=Patriot sons and daughters}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Martin Savage Terrace.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Street plaque at Martin Savage Terrace, [[Sligo]].]]
Breen noted that "the cortege was several miles long, the Parish Priest attended and recited the last prayer, while the Royal Irish Constabulary, armed with guns, surrounded the graveyard. "However, I suppose, this was the best tribute they could have paid to a gallant soldier, even though they did not mean it that way".&lt;ref name="McTernan 1994 209–215"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''My Fight For Irish Freedom'', Dan Breen, 1989.

In [[espionage]] jargon, a '''mole''' (also called a "penetration agent",&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; "deep cover agent", or "[[sleeper agent]]") is a long-term [[spy]] (espionage agent) who is recruited before having access to secret intelligence, subsequently managing to get into the target organization.&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt; However, it is popularly used to mean any long-term clandestine spy or [[informant]] within an organization, government or private.&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt;

The term was introduced to the public by [[United Kingdom|British]] spy novelist [[John Le Carré]] in his 1974 novel ''[[Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy]]''&lt;ref name="Carlisle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro" /&gt; and has since entered general usage, but its origin is unclear,&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; as well as to what extent it was used by [[Intelligence agency|intelligence services]] before it became popularized.  Le Carré, a former British [[intelligence officer]], has said that the term mole was actually used by the [[USSR|Soviet]] intelligence agency, the [[KGB]],&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt; and that a corresponding term used by Western intelligence services was ''sleeper agent''.&lt;ref name="Bruccoli2" /&gt; While the term ''mole'' had been applied to spies in the book ''Historie of the Reign of King Henry VII'' written in 1626 by Sir [[Francis Bacon]],&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt; Le Carré has said he did not get the term from that source.

==Overview==
A mole may be recruited early in life, and take decades to get a job in government service and reach a position of access to secret information before becoming active as a spy. Perhaps the most famous examples of moles were the [[Cambridge Five]], five upper-class British men recruited by the [[KGB]] as left-wing students at [[Cambridge University]] in the 1930s who later rose to high levels in various parts of the [[British government]].&lt;ref name="Carlisle" /&gt; By contrast, most espionage agents, such as CIA Director of Counterintelligence [[Aldrich Ames]] and FBI agent [[Robert Hanssen]], who spied on the US government for the KGB, were either recruited or offer their services as spies after they were in place as members of the target organization.

Because their recruitment occurred in the remote past, moles are difficult for a nation's security services to detect. The possibility that a top politician, corporate executive, government minister, or officer in an intelligence service could be a mole working for a foreign government is the worst nightmare of [[counterintelligence]] services. For example, [[James Angleton]], director of counterintelligence for the [[CIA]] between 1954 and 1975, was reportedly obsessed with suspicions that the top levels of Western governments were riddled with long-term communist agents&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; and accused numerous politicians such as former U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]], former Canadian Prime Ministers [[Lester Pearson]] and [[Pierre Trudeau]], former British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] and many members of Congress before he was removed in 1975. Fears of such moles in prominent positions in American life led to overreactions such as [[McCarthyism]].

Moles have been featured in numerous espionage films, television shows, and novels.

==Reasons for use==
The most common procedure used by [[intelligence services]] to recruit agents is to find the location within the foreign government or organization of the information they want (the ''target''), find out which people have access to it, and attempt to recruit one of them as a spy (''agent'') to obtain the information. However, the people with access to top secret government information, government employees with high [[security clearance]]s, are carefully monitored by the government's security apparatus for just this sort of espionage approach. Thus, it is difficult for a representative of the foreign intelligence service to meet with them clandestinely to recruit them. Private organizations such as large [[corporation]]s or [[terrorist group]]s have similar security monitors. In addition, the security clearance process weeds out employees who are openly disgruntled, ideologically disaffected, or otherwise have motives for betraying their country, so people in such positions are likely to reject recruitment as spies. Therefore, some intelligence services have tried to reverse the above process by first recruiting potential agents and then having them conceal their allegiance and pursue careers in the target government agency in the hope that they can reach positions of access to desired information.

Because the spy career of a mole is such a long-term one, sometimes occupying most of a lifetime, persons who become moles must be highly motivated. One common motivation is ideology (political convictions). During the [[Cold War]] a major source of moles in Western countries was so-called [[fellow traveller]]s, Westerners who, in their youth in the 1920s to 1940s, became disaffected with their own governments and sympathetic to world [[communism]] without actually joining the [[Communist Party]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3081">[[Image:BlakeMalkin.jpg|thumb|William Blake's frontispiece to ''A Father's Memoirs of his Child'' (1806), engraved by Cromek.]]
'''Robert Hartley Cromek''' (1770–1812) was an English engraver, editor, art dealer and entrepreneur who was most active in the early nineteenth century. He is best known for having allegedly cheated [[William Blake]] out of the potential profits of his engraving depicting Chaucer's [[Canterbury Pilgrims]].

In the early years of the nineteenth century Cromek had supported Blake, and had engraved Blake's design for [[Benjamin Heath Malkin]]'s ''A Father's Memoirs of his Child'' in 1806. Cromek later commissioned Blake to illustrate [[Robert Blair (poet)|Robert Blair]]'s poem ''The Grave''. Blake had produced the designs, but his sample engraving was considered by Cromek to be too crude to attract subscribers. Cromek then gave the lucrative job of engraving Blake's designs to a rival engraver [[Luigi Schiavonetti]].

In response, Blake proceeded to create a self-engraved illustration to Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales''. Cromek, however, had also given the idea to Blake's friend [[Thomas Stothard]]. Stothard's print became far more popular than Blake's, at least during their lifetimes. It remains unclear whether Blake or Cromek originated this project, but Blake certainly believed that the idea was stolen from him. The incident destroyed the friendship between Blake and Stothard.&lt;ref&gt;Blake v. Cromek: A Contemporary Ruling, J. B. Mertz, ''Modern Philology'', Vol. 99, No. 1 (Aug., 2001), pp. 66-77&lt;/ref&gt;

As a savagely humorous comment on these events Blake wrote epigrams attacking Cromek:&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, Geoffrey, ''Blake: Complete Writings with variant readings'', Oxford University Press, 1972, p.540&lt;/ref&gt;   
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Cromek loves artists as he loves his meat:&lt;br&gt;
He loves the Art; but 'tis the art to cheat.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A petty sneaking knave I knew--&lt;br&gt;
"O! Mr. Cromek, how do ye do?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1809 Cromek published ''Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song'', a collection of Scottish ballads. The aspirant poet [[Allan Cunningham (author)|Allan Cunningham]] sent in poems of his own authorship, which Cromek included in the collection, even though he may have suspected their real authorship.

About that time Cromek also compiled "RELIQUES OF ROBERT BURNS; Consisting Chiefly of Original Letters, Poems, and Critical Observations on Scottish Songs ". The original edition of 1808 contained a 4-page work by Thomas Stothard, "The Procession of Chaucer's Pilgrims to Canterbury", which did not appear in some later editions.

His son was the artist [[Thomas Hartley Cromek]].&lt;ref name=wake&gt;{{cite news|last=Fowler|first=James|title=A Biographical Notice of Thomas Hartley Cromek, Esq.|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wakefield_Express/Thomas_Hartley_Cromek|newspaper=Wakefield Express|date=19 April 1873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Muller''' (March 11, 1923 – September 20, 2010) was an international [[Civil service|civil servant]] with the [[United Nations]]. Serving with the UN for 40 years and rising to the rank of [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations|Assistant Secretary-General]], his ideas about [[world government]], [[world peace]] and [[spirituality]] led to the increased representation of religions in the UN, especially of [[New Age Movement]]. He was known by some as "the philosopher of the United Nations".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=964sAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wRQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2740%2C841277 "Schweitzer - Robert Muller"]. ''Star-News''. March 17, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born in Belgium, Robert Muller grew up in the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region in France as a French citizen.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.douglasgillies.com/prophet.html Prophet - the Hatmaker's Son. The life of Robert Muller&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Alsace-Lorraine borders Germany. His childhood home was on the border. The border issues he saw as a child had a significant impact on his life, his decision to work at the United Nations. During his youth Robert Muller experienced constant political and cultural turmoil. He knew the horrors of [[World War II]], of being a refugee, of the [[Nazi]] occupation in France, imprisonment and escape from prison. During the war he was a member of the [[French Resistance]] where towards the end of the war he unsuccessfully tried to prevent the slaughter of a group of captured German soldiers. This was a major life event that led to work for [[peace]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120629101649/http://odewire.com/60542/the-happiest-man-on-earth.html "The happiest man on earth"].''Ode Magazine''.

Official Says Life Should Be 1st Alliance"]. ''Spokane Daily Chronicle''. October 25, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war he returned home and earned a Doctorate of Law from the [[University of Strasbourg]]. In 1948 he entered and won an essay contest on how to govern the world, the prize of which was an internship at the newly created United Nations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==Career==
Dr. Muller began working at the United Nations just as it was forming. He devoted the next 40 years of his life behind the scenes at the United Nations, focusing his energies on nurturing a better world, including working for the environment, economics and peace. He was instrumental in the conception of many multilateral bodies, including the [[UN Development Programme]], the [[World Food Programme]], the [[UN Population Fund]], and the [[World Youth Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/sg/statements/?nid=5132 United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's Statements&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He rose through the ranks at the UN to the official position of Assistant Secretary-General and served under three [[UNSG|Secretaries-General]].

Robert Muller created a "World Core [[Curriculum]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unol.org/rms/wcc.html "World Core Curriculum"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606090937/http://www.unol.org/rms/wcc.html |date=2012-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that earned him the [[UNESCO Prize for Peace Education]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[[UNESCO Prize for Peace Education]]&lt;/ref&gt; The "World Core Curriculum" helped inspire the growing Global Education movement. More than 30 Robert Muller schools were founded throughout the world, including LIFE School in [[Panajachel]], Guatemala, from which students have gone on to pursue degrees in International Affairs.

He was the recipient of multiple awards and honors, including the [[Albert Schweitzer International Prize for the Humanities]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=964sAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wRQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3069,637510&amp;dq=dr-robert-muller&amp;hl=en "3 to be honored for contributions to music, medicine, hymanities"] ''Star-News''.

In addition to his duties at the [[University for Peace]], he devoted time to his writings and was an internationally acclaimed, multilingual speaker&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BRBJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jgUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1831,4247439&amp;dq=dr-robert-muller&amp;hl=en "Peace topic of Darien talk"] ''The hour''.

His goal was to have written 2000 ideas and dreams by the beginning of the new millennium. He achieved this and went on to write over 7000 ideas and dreams. In his speeches he spoke of these idea-dreams and over the years noted that many of these ideas were being worked on and some had been completed.

At the prompting of many of his friends, admirers and non-governmental organizations, Robert Muller was a candidate as a global citizen in 1996 for the post of [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fXpaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rR4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3797,5148568&amp;dq=dr+robert+muller&amp;hl=en "Irish woman may yet replace Boutros-Ghali"] ''New Straits Times''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4008">[[Image:Hyakuninisshu 010.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Semimaru, from the ''[[Hyakunin Isshu]]''.]]

{{nihongo|'''''Semimaru''''' also known as '''''Semimaro'''''|蝉丸}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] poet and musician of the early [[Heian period]]. His name is recorded in the ''[[Ogura Hyakunin Isshu]]'', but there are no historical accounts of his pedigree. Some accounts say he was a son of [[Uda Tennō]], [[Prince Atsumi]], or that he was the fourth son of [[Daigo Tennō]]. There are also claims that he lived during the reign of [[Ninmyō Tennō]].

Semimaru was a blind [[lute]] player who lived alone in a straw hut in Ausaka, which means "meeting slope".  "Ausaka is a slope about five miles east of the center of modern [[Kyoto]].  Its apex is a narrow pass through the eastern range of mountains separating Kyoto from the area of [[Lake Biwa]]."  The emperor established a formal check point barrier, ''Ausaka no seki'', at this summit in 646.  Today the place is known as Osaka.  A [[Shinto shrine]] was built there by the tenth century and eventually became known as Semimaru ''jinja''.&lt;ref name=Susan&gt;{{cite book |last=Matisoff |first=Susan |title=The Legend of Semimaru, Blind Musician of Japan |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1978 |isbn=0231039476 |page=3,6–7,9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sato&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sato |first=Hiroaki |title=Legends of the Samurai |publisher=Overlook Duckworth |year=1995 |ISBN=9781590207307 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supposedly, on seeing the traffic on the road to the capital, he composed the following {{nihongo|''waka''|和歌}}&lt;ref name=McMillan/&gt;{{rp|12,157}}

{{waka
|これやこの行くも帰るも別れては|知るも知らぬも逢坂の関
|reading = Kore ya kono yuku mo kaeru mo wakaretewa shiru mo shiranu mo osaka no seki
|translation = So this is the place!  The crowds, coming, going, meeting, parting; friends, strangers, known, unknown - The {{nihongo|Osaka (Ausaka) Barrier|逢坂の関|ausaka no seki}}.
|source = ''[[Ogura Hyakunin Isshu]]'' 10

'''Sergei Stepanovich Chakhotin''' (13 September 1883, [[Istanbul]], [[Ottoman Empire]] - 24 December 1973, [[Moscow]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], [[Soviet Union]]) was a Russian biologist, sociologist and social activist of Russian origin. He was one of the first thinkers to describe the effect of propaganda on the [[mass psychology|psychology of masses]] and warned against the techniques used by the [[Nazi Party]]. He was friends with [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and discussed his fears concerning the rise of Nazism with him.&lt;ref name="MacM"/&gt;

==Early life==
Chakhotin was born in [[Istanbul]], the son of  Stepan Ivanovich Chakhotin.&lt;ref name="MacM"&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacMaster|first1=Neil|title=Serge Chakhotin’s The Rape of the Masses (1939): the development of European propaganda c.1914-1960 and the Algerian War of Independence.|url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://neilmacmaster.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/*|website=NeilMacmaster Wordpress|publisher=Neil MacMaster|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father had previously been a private secretary to [[Ivan Turgenev]], before pursuing a diplomatic career which led to him becoming a consular interpreter in Istanbul.&lt;ref name="MacM"/&gt; His mother, Alexandra Motzo, was [[Greek people|Greek]] and in 1893 he moved with her to [[Odessa]].&lt;ref name="MacM"/&gt;

Chakhotin enrolled at the [[Moscow State University]] and participated in the occupation staged there in 1902.&lt;ref name="MacM"/&gt; This led to his arrest, imprisonment and a period of exile in [[Germany]]. He studied [[medicine]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]], going on to getting a doctorate in [[zoology]].&lt;ref name="MacM"/&gt; He developed the [[micropuncture microscope]] which enabled the ultraviolet examination of cells.&lt;ref name="MacM"/&gt; This helped enable him to return to [[Russia]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="MacM"/&gt; Here he worked at the [[Institute of Experimental Medicine]] under [[Ivan Pavlov]] in [[St Petersburg]]. In 1915 Chakhotin was involved with the [[Committee for Military-Technical Assistance]] (Komitet Voenno-Technicheskoi Pomoschi), which liaised with technical, industrial and scientific experts in order to mobilise them for the [[war effort]].&lt;ref name="MacM"/&gt; His role here was general secretary of the Bureau for Organizing Morale, a section dedicated to propaganda.&lt;ref name="MacM"/&gt;

==Involvement in the Russian Revolution and Civil War==
Chakhotin was a lifelong socialist. He claimed to have been, on the eve of the February Revolution of 1917, a member of the “Defencist” group of Social Democrats around G.B. Plekhanov. He worked briefly for the Provisional Government and, following the October Revolution, in the propaganda departments of the Volunteer Army under General A.I. Denikin and the Don Cossack Army under General P.N. Krasnov. He left the service of Krasnov when the latter entered into negotiations with the Germans in the Ukraine. He left Russia in 1919.

==Working for the German Social Democrats==
In Germany in 1932, putting his theories of political propaganda into practice, he campaigned with the [[Iron Front]] (Eiserne Front) against the National Socialists, alongside the German Social Democrat, Carlo Mierendorff. Chakhotin designed the [[Three Arrows]], the symbol of the [[Iron Front]].

==Key Work==
Serge Tchakhotine, Le viol des foules par la propagande politique [Paris, Gallimard, 1939; 2nd revised edition, 1952]. The first edition was translated into English by E. W. Dickes and published as Serge Chakotin (sic), The rape of the masses; the psychology of totalitarian political propaganda [London, George Routledge, 1940]; and in New York by the Alliance Book Corporation [1940]. The term “totalitarian” does not figure in the title of the French editions of 1939 or 1952 but was added in the English language edition of 1940. Translations have been published in Esperanto, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Romanian. The English translation of 1940 has been re-printed by Routledge [London, 2017]. A translation into Russian of the first French edition was published by the State University of Yaroslavl in 2017.

==Fictional character biography==
Thirteen years ago during a demonstration on the use of radioactive rays at a science exhibit, a [[spider]] is accidentally exposed to large amounts of radiation. In its dying moments, the arachnid bites Peter Parker. As a result, the young teenager gains amazing powers and becomes [[Spider-Man]]. However, this is not the end. Mere moments after biting Parker, the spider bites another young student named Cindy Moon.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #1 (April 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Cindy's abilities, including organic webbing (unlike Peter), manifest but she is unable to control them. Some time later, [[Ezekiel (comics)|Ezekiel]] approaches the Moon family to offer his help and guide Cindy in controlling her newfound abilities.  After six years training to use her powers, Cindy is locked up inside a facility by Ezekiel to protect her and the other "spiders" from [[Morlun]] and his family called the Inheritors.&lt;ref name="ASM4"&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #4 (July 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original Sin===
Seven years later during the "[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]" storyline, Spider-Man is exposed to the energies of the Watcher's eye. He receives a vision of the radioactive spider that bit him also biting Cindy Moon, and learns what happened to her afterwards. Spider-Man immediately goes on to search for Cindy to break her out of the facility Ezekiel had kept her. After freeing Cindy, she attacks Spider-Man in a fit of rage saying that he has doomed them all. Spider-Man calms Cindy down by telling her that Morlun is dead. Cindy makes her way out of the facility to finally see the city of New York, stopping only to make a costume out of her webbing. She tells Spider-Man to refer to her as Silk.&lt;ref name="ASM4"/&gt; Silk is heartbroken to find that her family has moved. Silk and Peter also find that they are powerfully attracted to each other due to their shared spider-sense. Silk finds out that Morlun might be still alive, which causes her to attack Peter. However, their attraction makes them kiss. Peter stops as soon as Cindy begins to remove his mask, after which they move back to Peter and Anna Maria's apartment. Afterwards, Peter and Cindy go to the Fact Channel's news station where they are attacked by [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] and [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]. While Silk is easily able to dodge Electro's lightning bolts thanks to her "hyper-spider-speed and senses," Spider-Man isn't as lucky. Black Cat then goes after the paralyzed superhero and begins to unmask him in front of live TV.&lt;ref name="ASM5"&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #5 (Aug. 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Thankfully, [[J. Jonah Jameson]] hogged up too much space in front of the camera, preventing the camera (and anyone else) from seeing Peter's face. Silk quickly spins a temporary mask for Peter and escapes with him back into Peter and Anna Maria's apartment. At the waterfront where Parker Industries will be holding the demonstration for their new device meant to cure Electro, Cindy spins Peter some Electro-insulated webbing to prevent what happened during their last fight with Electro from happening again. When the fight begins, Black Cat sabotages the machine which causes Electro to go out of control and hit a helicopter. Silk hurries and begins spinning porous webs to catch the crashing helicopter. She then creates an insulated web-pod to contain the inevitable explosion of energy coming from Electro. The entire incident ends with a depowered Electro and a missing Black Cat. Afterwards, Cindy gets accepted for a job at the Fact Channel where she intends to use the information center in order to find her family.&lt;ref name="ASM5"/&gt;

===Spider-Verse===
During the "[[Spider-Verse]]" storyline, Spider-Man and Silk discuss their problem in which whenever they get close, they feel the need to have intimate interactions as well as possible solutions to this. They end up fighting [[Looter (comics)|Looter]] and his henchmen where they are stealing equipment and Spiderling costumes from Spider-Island II. Spider-Man and Silk managed to defeat them with the help of [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], [[Anya Corazon|Spider-Anya]], and [[Spider-Man 2099]] as the final henchman is defeated by [[Spider-Girl]] of Earth-982, Spider-UK, and [[Spider-Ham]]. Silk accompanies the other spider-themed heroes through the portal to Earth-13.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #9 (Nov. 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; When Spider-Man wants Silk to be among those to accompany him to gather the other spider-themed heroes, Old Man Spider-Man of Earth-4 advises that Silk should stay behind. Silk ends up following anyway which later angers Old Man Spider-Man when they arrive on Earth-928. He mentioned that Silk shouldn't have left her bunker. After [[Daemos]] was slain, [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]' mind in Peter Parker's body) blames Silk for Daemos' attack and suggests that they kill her. When Brix, Bora, and a Daemos clone arrive and kill Old Man Spider-Man Silk steals Spider-Man's portal device, intending to set right the deaths she caused and opens a portal while attracting the Inheritors' attention. Spider-Woman volunteers to follow Silk while Superior Spider-Man sends Spider-Man Noir to accompany them.&lt;ref name="ASM10"&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #10 (Nov. 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; After Spider-Man of Earth-90214 was badly injured, Silk and Spider-Woman take him back to Earth-90214 so that he can die recuperate. Superior Spider-Man expresses concern since the Inheritors have already been there, but Spider-Man says Silk should be safe as long as she keeps moving and takes one of Superior Spider-Man's cloaking devices.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #11 (Dec. 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Gwen]] and Spider-Girl (Anya Corozon) were to supervise Silk, but runs off on her own with Brix and Bora hot on her trail. Her teleporter is broken and she's surrounded by the Inheritor twins, so she dives into Earth 001 to escape. She then finds Jessica Drew 616 impostering that dimensions Jessica Drew. She uses her teleporter to escape, but ends up in Earth 3145-the only world the Inheritors cannot attack due to a post-thermo nuclear war. Silk is able to survive when she creates a web-suit. She finds her way to this dimensions SIMS building and finds that dimensions spider totem in a nuclear bunker—Ben Parker. She then sends clues to the other Spiders of the safe zone and goes back to Earth 001 to save Jessica Drew, but gets captured by the Inheritors. She is one of the three key totems, The Bride. During the final sacrifice of her, Benjy Parker of MC2, and Kaine, the Spider Army are able to stop the Inheritors and save her and Benjy. After Superior Spider-Man kills the Grand Weaver, she volunteers to take his place, but Karn decides to be the new Weaver, since through a time paradox he was the weaver all along. Silk, Jessica Drew, and Spider-Man return to Earth 616.

===''Silk'' solo series===
After arriving back in New York, Silk begins a career of crime-fighting while searching for her family after ten years, as well as continuing her job as a Fact Channel intern. Wanting to move focus on the search for them, Cindy moves out of her friend's apartment and moves back into her old bunker, which she uses as a base of operations. Discovering that her family has no official records of being around, save for some old files, she goes to her old neighborhood. Here she runs into her high school boyfriend, who is now engaged. Unbeknownst to Silk during all this, two mysterious figures are watching her whenever she is in the bunker.&lt;ref&gt;''Silk'' #1-2 (February and March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

As seen in the first issue of the ''Silk'' comic book title, she engages in battle against a costumed villain called Dragonclaw (whose name she says sounds like a [[Pokémon]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superheroreviews.com/comic-book-review-of-silk-1/|title=Comic Book Review of Silk #1|work=Superhero Reviews|date=February 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Silk'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; and also engages in antagonism with Black Cat.

Spider-Man thinks she is not well and asks the [[Fantastic Four]] to check her. Silk consents to the check up but becomes annoyed when she finds out Peter revealed the history about her bunker and Ezekiel to them. It is revealed that Silk is physically fine, but is dealing with anxiety issues, and is referred to a therapist (who she eventually visits in the seventh issue). She and [[Human Torch]] also go on a date of crime fighting despite Peter's protests.&lt;ref&gt;''Silk'' #4 (May 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "Last Days" part of the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, Cindy Moon begins her run as Silk and comes across Dragonclaw and defeats him. Later, she finds out Dragonclaw did this because he was in the debt of Black Cat. This was the reason for his misdeeds and the tries to help him out by enlisting the help of Spider-Man to find Black Cat's gang causing a show down between Silk and Black Cat which leads to Silk cutting her hair to escape. While this was going on, it is show that Silk is still very confused as to what has happened to her family and ex-boyfriend which leads her to take a job under J. Jonah Jameson at the Fact Channel who takes an immediate liking to her as she suggests that they start taking photos of silk. One day, J. Jonah Jameson looks at Cindy Moon's screen to find out that she was trying to find where her family is which also leads her to tell him everything about her. A couple of days pass and it is shown to be the final incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610 as time is running out. J. Jonah Jameson gives Silk a case file of a young boy who seems to be Silk's brother as he tells her this. She runs straight out going to that location where she meets her brother now with a 'X' shape scar on the left side of his forehead embraces him. As the world is ending, Silk tells her brother "I'm sorry. For everything. And I love you, Albert. I love you."&lt;ref&gt;''Silk'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]" branding, Silk is on a stakeout at a skating rink. Silk's spider-sense goes off as a group of Goblin Nation grunts rob a bank. Monologuing to herself, Silk reveals she'd been tailing the Goblin Nation for two weeks in order to avenge her brother who was infused with Goblin Formula and now has no memory of what happened to their parents. Extending claws, Silk slashes the Goblin Nation grunts' getaway car and webs them up, taking their loot, a safety deposit box containing [[Parker Industries]] tech. Thinking to herself that she has no idea what's in the safety deposit box just that her boss wants it, Silk returns to her now-employer Black Cat, who she is working with despite their earlier antagonism, who scolds her for showing mercy and tells her that being good is bad for business.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #1&lt;/ref&gt;

During the events in the ''Spider-Women'' event, Cindy learns her counterpart from Earth-65 (home of Spider-Gwen) is the cause of Gwen's powers, and has traveled to Prime Earth to steal and reverse engineer the technology of the greatest minds of the universe for war mongering. Upon confronting Cindy-65 with Spider-Gwen, Gwen loses her powers from Cindy-65's nanobots and Cindy-Prime's name as SILK is tarnished as a villain, so much so that her S.H.I.E.L.D. handler Mockingbird thinks she actually did the crimes she's accused of. After Black Cat's freeing of Silk from a S.H.I.E.L.D. prisoner convoy, Cindy chooses to stay with Black Cat (cont. undercover), and later went back to help Gwen and Jessica win the boss fight with Cindy-65, who utilized a gauntlet which replicates the abilities of the universes most formidable superhumans. Cindy, as a result of her Earth-65 counterpart's defamation, earns more of Black Cat's trust to gain deeper intelligence of her criminal operation, still intending to complete her mission and get whatever S.H.I.E.L.D. has on her family's whereabouts. Eventually, Black Cat discover her alliance with Mockingbird,&lt;ref&gt;''Silk'' vol. 2 #9&lt;/ref&gt; prompting Silk to fight her. During the ensuing fight, Cindy falls into one of the dumpster, and was saved by a mysterious figure called Spectro, who was revealed to be Cindy's ex-boyfriend Hector.&lt;ref&gt;''Silk'' vol. 2 #10&lt;/ref&gt;

It is revealed that Hector actually died (while Cindy was being held in the bunker) when a neighbor attempted to summon a demon in his apartment block, resulting in him wandering the Material World and only able to manage tangibility when in combat. Cindy's colleagues Rafferty and Lola at Fact Channel News discover her secret identity and Cindy embraces this opportunity to open up to them, which helps relief some of her feelings of loneliness in the world. Rafferty reveals that they have discovered Dr. Kapoor's lab, which has been abandoned for months but has a secret benefactor continually paying the rent. The three of them travel to the labs location, which unbeknownst to them is part of a trap for Silk by a villain called Fang. Shortly after they arrive at the lab, they discover a dimensional doorway which leads they to the [[Negative Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;''Silk'' vol. 2 #11&lt;/ref&gt; Upon journeying to the Negative Zone, Silk, Rafferty, and Lola relish the adventurous experience and befriend a medieval dragon called David. David explains the continuing war of the Red Knight against the evil forces of the Ash King and his army. He caught the scent of their arrival, which mimicked the arrival of a previously three (from the outer world) years ago. The three aid the Red Knight. After the battle is won, with the defeat of the Ash King, the Red King is revealed to be Cindy's mother Nari Moon.&lt;ref&gt;''Silk'' vol. 2 #12&lt;/ref&gt; Nari explains to Cindy that she and her father, who has become a prisoner of the Ash King some time previously, had originally traveled to the Negative Zone in search of a blue substance they believed could be synthesized into an antidote for the spider bite that Cindy received and which would have nullified her powers, thus removing the threat of the Inheritors. Cindy's father Albert Moon Sr. is soon liberated from his prison and soon after the five say there goodbyes to their friends in the Negative Zone and re-enter the dimensional doorway. Mockingbird gives financial help to the family in the form of an abode in which to live, and the family begin building bridges with each other which places Cindy at a crossroads on what to do with her life next. What Cindy doesn't know is that Albert Moon Sr. is in possession of the mysterious blue substance and delivers it to Fang who claims it is time to "put an end to Silk once and for all..."&lt;ref&gt;''Silk'' vol. 2 #13&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]" event, Cindy is glad to have her family back, but still feels distant from them and doesn't make as much of an effort to spend as much time with them. When J. Jonah Jameson wants one of his workers to investigate the New U Technologies scenario in San Francisco, Cindy volunteers to go to get away from the city as Hector (now calling himself Spectro) accompanies her. Jameson is enthusiastic for her that her family is back together and leaves for dinner, but Cindy found something off about his behavior. She and Hector decide to investigate Jameson's room in New U Technologies and she uses her powers to create a different costume from her Silk outfit to avoid suspicion. Hector calls her new identity "Silkworm" much to her annoyance. Cindy's suspicions are confirmed when she finds Jameson talking with his formerly deceased wife Marla while Spectro finds a room with a number of test subjects in capsules. Spectro triggers the intruder alert, prompting Cindy to escape. Before Cindy can leave, she's attacked by the resurrected Spider-Woman [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Silk'' vol. 2 #14&lt;/ref&gt; Silk fights Mattie Franklin on the top of the roof of New U Technologies. When Mattie Franklin claims to Silk that New U Technologies is doing things for good purposes and offers her a tour in exchange for removing her mask, Silk gets away. At Fact Channel, Rafferty and Lola look more into New U Technologies and tell Cindy they'll update her with more information. Cindy is then approached in her apartment by J. Jonah Jameson. Cindy gives her Rafferty and Lola's research to voice skepticism on the New U Technologies and Jameson invites her to join him on a quick trip to the facility. He tells Cindy that he believes they're doing good work and introduces her to Mattie and Marla.&lt;ref&gt;''Silk'' vol. 2 #15&lt;/ref&gt; After J. Jonah Jameson and Marla leave for Marla's treatment, Mattie tells Cindy that she knows she's Silk and takes her to investigate the facility. Mattie tells her that she's suspicious of the whole experiment as some of the other resurrected characters have been showing slight behavioral glitches and takes her to a place called "Haven" where they find Hector back in his own body. Back at Cindy's home, Mr. Moon has hidden a package that Cindy wanted Albert to open and tells Rafferty and Lola to stay out of their business while receiving instructions from a mysterious woman. At "Haven," an alarm goes off and starts affecting all the resurrected clones. Hector starts becoming Spectro again and prepares to attack Cindy.&lt;ref&gt;''Silk'' vol. 2 #16&lt;/ref&gt; J. Jonah Jameson's broadcast causes the Carrion virus to start spreading worldwide. Mattie helps Cindy deal with Hector who reverts to his ghostly form after his cloned body disintegrates. The three of them head up to the broadcast center, where the Carrion Virus quickly spreads due to Marla Jameson opening the doors. Spider-Man and Anna Maria Marconi arrive to stop the broadcast as Mattie reveals to J. Jonah Jameson her superpowers. Silk holds the door back to prevent more infected hosts coming in and Mattie saves her from one of the carriers infecting her and passes out in the process. After Spider-Man sends out the Webware Emergency Signal, J. Jonah Jameson and Silk find Marla and Mattie reduced to dust.&lt;ref&gt;''Silk'' vol. 2 #17&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the incident, Cindy quits her job at the Fact Channel and contemplates what she wants to do with her life. After a discussion with her brother, therapist, and helping a child free his kite in the graveyard (which she was visiting to see Mattie's grave), she decides to enlist in S.H.I.E.L.D. academy.&lt;ref&gt;''Silk'' vol. 2 #18&lt;/ref&gt; With S.H.I.E.L.D.'s technology, she researches her father's meetings and eventually confronts him about his secret meetings with a mysterious doctor, who turns about to be a Tamara Pearson aka Fang. Fang worked for Ezekiel and was the leader of a splinter group of the spider society, and while she claims to Cindy's father that she will be "curing" Cindy of her powers, her actual plan is to transfer Cindy's powers to herself and use her abilities to take over the Spider Society. After inheriting Ezekiel's fortune and drugging Cindy's father, she's kept her eyes on Cindy during her time during and after the bunker. Silk defeats Fang with the help of Hector and her father accepts her for who she is. With her family closer, her job at S.H.I.E.L.D., and with Rafferty and Lola married, Cindy finally feels happiness after a long time.&lt;ref&gt;''Silk'' vol. 2 #19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-solo series===
During the "Go Down Swinging" storyline, Silk along with [[Miles Morales]] helps Spider-Man in his fight with the Red Goblin ([[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]] possessed by the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]]). They are injured by the Red Goblin during the fight and later saved by [[Flash Thompson]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #799-800&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==

Cindy gained similar abilities to Peter Parker when she was bitten by the same radioactive spider that gave him his abilities, though her spider-sense (dubbed by her as "Silk Sense") is far stronger than Peter's. On their first meeting, Peter observed that she was even faster than him, though not quite as strong. She also has the ability to shoot webs out of her fingertips, and she has an [[eidetic memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Robbie Thompson|penciller = Stacey Lee|inker = Stacey Lee|title = Silk|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = 18 February 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==

===Earth-65===
In the crossover event ''Spider-Women'', it is revealed that the Cindy Moon of the ''[[Spider-Gwen]]'' universe is the head of a nefarious spy organization called S.I.L.K., and serves as the main antagonist of the event. Cindy of Earth-65 almost had a similar spider bite accident to the main one, but a teacher swatted it with a newspaper. Dissatisfied with her life, she joins S.H.I.E.L.D. as a researcher in spiders. There was a spider-related incident in which Jesse Drew was nearly killed, but Cindy's research saves his life and gives him spider powers, with Agent Drew making it up to Cindy by becoming one of her top agents. She eventually recovers the altered spider back from S.H.I.E.L.D. with Jesse's help and releases it into the open, where it bit Gwen Stacy and led to her becoming Earth-65's Spider-Woman. During the Spider-Women event, Jesse steals Gwen's interdimensional teleporter and travels to Earth-616, where she steals a large amount of technology while framing her 616 counterpart. When she encounters Gwen and her counterpart, she uses her technology to take away Gwen's powers. When she returns to her hideout after Jesse's betrayal, she is ambushed by Jessica Drew, Gwen, and her counterpart and is defeated. S.H.I.E.L.D. locks her up for her crimes and her counterpart teases her by sending her a care package with all the things she had in her bunker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/58381/spider-women_event_alpha_2016_1|title=Spider-Women Alpha (2016) #1|publisher=''Marvel''|date=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education, and career==
Huelskamp was born on November 11, 1968 and raised on the Huelskamp family farm in [[Fowler, Kansas]]. Pioneered by his grandparents Martin and Clara in 1926, the farm operation includes raising corn, cattle, wheat, milo, and soybeans. He attended elementary and high school in Fowler, where he was a Farm Bureau Youth Leader, a member of St. Anthony's Parish, and active in both 4-H and Future Farmers of America.

After attending seminary for two years in Santa Fe, Huelskamp continued his education at the College of Santa Fe (now [[Santa Fe University of Art and Design]]) and received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in social science education in 1991. He received his [[Ph.D.]] in political science, concentrating in agricultural policy from the [[American University]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.votesmart.org/bio.php?can_id=12571|title=Tim Huelskamp's Biography – The Voter's Self Defense System – Vote Smart|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AP01&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cjonline.com/stories/031598/kan_phd.shtml |title=Unassuming Ph.D. is emerging |last=Hanna |first=John |date=March 15, 1998 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=''[[The Topeka Capital-Journal]]'' |accessdate=February 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His term in the House continued until January 3, 2017. In June 2017, Huelskamp was named President of the Illinois-based think tank [[The Heartland Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/press-release-heartland-institute-names-former-congressman-tim-huelskamp-incoming-president|title=News - PRESS RELEASE: Heartland Institute Names Former Congressman Tim Huelskamp Incoming President {{!}} Heartland Institute|website=www.heartland.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kansas Senate==

===Elections===
In 1996, Huelskamp challenged Republican incumbent state senator Marian Reynolds in the primary and won by a landslide margin, taking 62 percent of the vote to Reynolds's 38 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hanna |first=John |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xcohAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PZ4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4788,4963601&amp;dq=tim+huelskamp&amp;hl=en |title=Four incumbent state legislators lose to their challengers |publisher=The Fort Scott Tribune |date=August 7, 1996 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youngest state senator in 20 years, he then won re-election by wide margins in 2000, 2004 and 2008.

===Committee assignments===
Huelskamp served on the following legislative committees:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kslegislature.org/legsrv-senate/searchSenate.do?rep=4489 Profile from the Kansas Legislature] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414180950/http://www.kslegislature.org/legsrv-senate/searchSenate.do?rep=4489 |date=April 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Joint Committee on Information Technology (Chairman)
* Education
* Ethics and Local Government (Chairman)
Huelskamp previously served on the state's Ways and Means Committee but was removed due to clashes with colleagues and with the Committee's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cjonline.com/news/state/2010-07-20/huelskamp_ad_under_scrutiny Huelskamp ad under scrutiny], Tim Carpenter, ''[[Topeka Capital-Journal]]'', July 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2010
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Kansas, 2010#District 1}}
Seven-term Congressman [[Jerry Moran]] gave up the Big First seat to make a successful run for the [[United States Senate]] seat being vacated by the popular fourteen-year incumbent Republican [[Sam Brownback]], who was [[Kansas gubernatorial election, 2010|running for governor that year]]. This touched off a free-for-all in the Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district. Huelskamp finished first in the six-candidate primary field with 34.8 percent of the vote, all but assuring that he would be the district's next representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=511123|title=Our Campaigns – KS District 1 – R Primary Race – Aug 03, 2010|work=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huelskamp ran against Democratic nominee [[Alan Jilka]] and Libertarian nominee Jack W. Warner. Huelskamp was endorsed by the [[Club for Growth]], [[Mike Huckabee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primebuzz.kcstar.com/?q=node/17211 |title=Huckabee endorses Huelskamp's Congressional bid |last=Klepper |first=David |date=February 17, 2009 |work=[[The Kansas City Star]] |accessdate=February 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://briefingroom.thehill.com/tag/tim-huelskamp/ |title=Huelskamp Picks up Huckabee Endorsement |last=Jacobs |first=Jeremy P. |date=February 17, 2009 |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |accessdate=February 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317024251/http://briefingroom.thehill.com/tag/tim-huelskamp/ |archivedate=March 17, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conservative Leadership PAC]], [[Concerned Women for America]] Legislative Action Committee,&lt;ref name=KSA01/&gt; Ron Paul and [[Ken Blackwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kansasliberty.com/liberty-update-archive/2009/09feb/sen-huelskamp-files-bill-that-would-require-school-districts-to-post-financial-information-on-state-website/ |title=Huelskamp bill pushes for school district spending transparency |last=LaCerte |first=Phil |date=February 5, 2009 |work=Kansas Liberty |accessdate=February 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As expected, Huelskamp won the seat in a rout, taking 73 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kssos.org/ent/maps_graphs.html#USHSE1 |title=2010 Unofficial Kansas General Election Results |date=November 3, 2010 |work=[[Kansas Secretary of State]] |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huelskamp ran unopposed in the general election.

;2014
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Kansas, 2014#District 1}}
Unlike the previous election, Huelskamp was challenged by a Republican, [[Alan LaPolice]], in the primary.&lt;ref name = OpenSecrets&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.opensecrets.org/races/election.php?state=KS| title = Congressional Races in 2014 (Kansas) | publisher = [[The Center for Responsive Politics]]| accessdate = July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, two Democrats ran for the primary [[Jim Sherow]], a [[Kansas State University]] professor, and Bryan Whitney, a 2013 [[Wichita State University]] grad. Both LaPolice and Sherow critiqued Huelskamp for his failure to work with other Members of Congress and voting against Farm Bill.&lt;ref name=GOPChal&gt;{{cite news|title=Huelskamp faces GOP challenge in Kan. 1st District|first=Roxana|last=Hegeman|publisher=Associated Press|date=July 5, 2014|url=http://www.kansas.com/2014/07/05/3540423/huelskamp-faces-gop-challenge.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712013016/http://www.kansas.com/2014/07/05/3540423/huelskamp-faces-gop-challenge.html|archivedate=July 12, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gctelegram&gt;{{cite news| title = Sherow makes bid for 'good representation' in Big First| url = http://gctelegram.com/news/local/Sherow-Congress-3-20-14| date = 2014-03-19| first = Scott| last = Aust| newspaper = Garden City Telegram| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20140609193131/http://gctelegram.com/news/local/Sherow-Congress-3-20-14| archivedate = June 9, 2014| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huelskamp narrowly defeated LaPolice in the Republican Primary with only 55% of the vote. Huelskamp failed to receive the endorsement of the Farm Bureau and the Kansas Livestock Association. Huelskamp went on to win the general election with 68% of the vote.&lt;ref name = OpenSecrets/&gt;

;2016
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Kansas, 2016#District 1}}
Huelskamp was defeated in the Republican primary by [[Roger Marshall (politician)|Roger Marshall]], an obstetrician from [[Great Bend, Kansas|Great Bend]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tea party's Tim Huelskamp ousted by challenger Roger Marshall in Kansas congressional race|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article93390117.html|accessdate=August 3, 2016|publisher=Kansas City Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; by 58% to 42%. Marshall's supporters argued Huelskamp's combativeness hurt the district. House leadership had removed Huelskamp from the House Agriculture Committee in 2012; farm groups such as Kansas Farm Bureau, an affiliate of the [[American Farm Bureau Federation]], Kansas Livestock Association, an affiliate of the [[National Cattlemen's Beef Association]], [[National Association of Wheat Growers]] and the [[United States Chamber of Commerce|US Chamber of Commerce]] endorsed Marshall, as many Republican voters saw it as a crucial issue in a farm state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=August 2, 2016 |title=Physician Marshall ousts US Rep.

===Legislative activity===
In early 2012, Huelskamp introduced legislation that would ensure military chaplains could not be "directed, ordered or required to perform any duty, rite, ritual, ceremony, service or function that is contrary to the conscience, moral principles or religious beliefs of the chaplain, or contrary to the moral principles or religious beliefs of the chaplain's faith group." The language appeared to be related to permitting same-sex marriages on military bases in states where such unions are permitted.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskinson, Charles, [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0212/72325.html "Don't Ask Don't Tell: War over gays in military in new phase"], ''Politico'', February 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sovereign debt crisis===
On February 16, 2012, during a contentious three-hour [[United States House Committee on the Budget|House Budget Committee]] hearing with [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Timothy Geithner]], Huelskamp warned of the looming threat of an economic crisis similar to the one then [[European sovereign debt crisis|taking place in Europe]]. Huelskamp accused Geithner and the entire Obama administration of failing to correct the U.S.'s debt crisis, which he believed would lead the country down the same path. Geithner replied that Huelskamp had an "adolescent perspective on how to think about economic policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/republicans-warn-of-european-style-debt-crisis-2012-02-16?dist=afterbell |title=House Republicans warn of European-style debt crisis |last=Robb |first=Greg |date=February 16, 2012 |work=MarketWatch |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defense of Marriage Act Constitutional Amendment===
After the United States Supreme Court declared the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) unconstitutional on June 26, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/26/supreme-court-doma-decision_n_3454811.html Supreme Court DOMA Decision Rules Federal Same-Sex Marriage Ban Unconstitutional] Huffington Post – June 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Huelskamp immediately announced that he would introduce a constitutional amendment to restore the Defense of Marriage Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/rep-tim-huelskamp-to-file-constitutional-amendment-to-restore-doma-93430.html|title=Huelskamp will try to restore DOMA|work=POLITICO|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on ''The Steve Deace Show'', a conservative radio program, to denounce the Supreme Court Justices. "The idea that Jesus Christ himself was degrading and demeaning is what they've come down to," he said. "I can't even stand to read the decisions because I don't even think they'd pass law school with decisions like that."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/huelskamp-doma-ruling-attack-jesus-christ-justices-couldnt-pass-law-school#sthash.CRRatOg9.dpuf Huelskamp: DOMA Ruling an Attack on Jesus Christ; Justices Couldn't Pass Law School] Right Wing Watch – June 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The House Republican Steering Committee removed Huelskamp from both the Budget Committee and the Agriculture Committee in late 2012 as part of a larger party leadership-caucus shift.&lt;ref&gt;Wing, Nick, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/12/tim-huelskamp-john-boehner_n_2285196.html  "Tim Huelskamp: John Boehner Guilty Of 'Petty, Vindictive Politics' In Committee Ousters"], ''The Huffington Post'', 12/12/2012.&lt;/ref&gt; At a [[Heritage Foundation]] lunch in the immediate wake of the removal, Huelskamp said: "It's petty, it's vindictive, and if you have any conservative principles you will be punished for articulating those."&lt;ref name=WP01&gt;Weiner, Rachel, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2012/12/05/conservatives-bite-back-at-gop-leadership-over-purge/ "Conservatives bite back over House GOP purge"], Washington ''Post'' Post Politics blog, December 5, 2012.

''[[Politico]]'' quoted a spokesperson for Republican Congressman [[Lynn Westmoreland]] of Georgia as explaining that Huelskamp, Amash and Schweikert were removed for "their inability to work with other members." The spokesperson clarified that Westmoreland "said that it had nothing to do with their voting record, a scorecard, or their actions across the street [meaning fundraising]." The three were described by ''Politico'' and its sourcing of Huelskamp's other colleagues as "jerks" who "made life harder for other Republicans by taking whacks at them in public for supporting the team".&lt;ref name="The a—hole factor"&gt;{{ cite news | last=Allen |first=Jonathan | url=http://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/house-leaders-make-examples-of-obstinate-members-85034.html | title='The a—hole factor' | publisher=Politico | date=December 13, 2012 | accessdate=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="'Obstinate' Factor Continues to Roil GOP"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/obstinate_factor_continues_to_roil_gop-219926-1.html|title='Obstinate' Factor Continues to Roil GOP|date=December 12, 2012|accessdate=April 30, 2014 |publisher=Roll Call}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.2}}

On January 3, 2013, Huelskamp appeared to be counting votes as part of an effort to unseat [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[John Boehner]] when the [[113th Congress#Major events|113th Congress]] convened. Huelskamp nominated conservative [[Jim Jordan (Ohio politician)|Jim Jordan]] to replace Boehner. When asked about the anti-Boehner effort, a spokesman for Huelskamp declined to comment.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Jake, and John Bresnahan (January 3, 2013), [http://www.politico.com/story/2013/01/conservatives-rebel-against-boehner-85749.html "Conservatives rebel against Boehner"], ''[[Politico]]'.'&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Valery Dmitrievitch Bolotov''' ({{lang-rus|Вале́рий Дми́триевич Бо́лотов|p=vɐˈlʲerʲɪj ˈdmʲitrʲɪjɪvʲɪtɕ ˈbolətəf}}, {{lang-uk|Вале́рій Дми́трович Бо́лотов}}; 13 February 1970 – 27 January 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbc.ru/politics/27/01/2017/588b600e9a79476e71db84f8|title=Умер первый глава ЛНР Валерий Болотов|author=|date=|website=РБК|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Russia]]n militant leader known for his involvement in the [[Donbass War]] in [[eastern Ukraine]], and as the leader of the unrecognized [[Luhansk People's Republic]].

==Biography==
The biography of Bolotov before the 2014 is very scarce. There is a video which shows that Bolotov participated in voting at a local referendum and showed a Ukrainian passport which indicated that he was born in [[Taganrog]], [[Rostov Oblast]] on 13 February 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|awv0rQpKwc8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to other sources, Bolotov was born in Stakhanov.&lt;ref name=bolotovrbc&gt;Dergchov, V. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20170129144230/http://www.rbc.ru/politics/27/01/2017/588b600e9a79476e71db84f8 There died the first leader of LPR (Умер первый глава ЛНР Валерий Болотов)]''. [[RBC Information Systems|RBC]]. 27 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Bolotov moved to [[Stakhanov, Ukraine|Stakhanov]] in the [[Luhansk Oblast]] (province) of eastern Ukraine in 1974.&lt;ref name=BoloIFi&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.interfax.com/newsinf.asp?id=505915|title=Top officials appointed in Luhansk people's republic|agency=[[Interfax-Ukraine]]|date=May 19, 2014|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Russia Today]], he held two university degrees.&lt;ref name=Taganrog&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/news/159840-lugansk-elects-head-constitution/|title=Self-proclaimed Lugansk People's Republic elects head, passes constitution|date=May 19, 2014|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolotov claimed to be a senior sergeant of the [[Soviet Airborne Troops]] in [[Vitebsk]] (presumably the [[103rd Guards Airborne Division]]){{efn|group=1|During the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (also known as the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]]) and until [[fall of the Soviet Union]], the division was under direct jurisdiction of the Soviet [[KGB]]}} and between 1989 and 1990 participated in a number of conflicts including Tbilisi,{{efn|group=1|[[April 9 tragedy]]}} Yerevan and [[Karabakh]].{{efn|group=1|[[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]}}&lt;ref name=komsomolskaya&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kp.by/daily/26224.3/3106364/|script-title=ru:Кто они, "народные губернаторы": Харьков возглавил автослесарь, а Луганск – десантник|trans-title=Who are those, "People's Governors"?

Bolotov worked as a manager and director at a meat factory and used to run a small business.&lt;ref name=BoloIFi/&gt;

Before the pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, Bolotov was a representative of [[Oleksandr Yefremov]] who supervised illegal mining in the region.&lt;ref name=petrulevych&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gordonua.com/publications/Petrulevich-Terroristicheskie-gruppy-GRU-Rossii-uzhe-v-Kieve-i-zhdut-signala-29825.html|title=Former chief of Luhansk SBU Petrulevych: The terrorists groups of Russian GRU is already in Kiev and anticipating a signal|publisher=Gordon|date=July 2, 2014|archivedate=October 14, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014001733/http://gordonua.com/publications/Petrulevich-Terroristicheskie-gruppy-GRU-Rossii-uzhe-v-Kieve-i-zhdut-signala-29825.html|access-date=October 14, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Bolotov became a leader of an armed group during the [[2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine]]. On May 13, 2014, Bolotov survived an assassination attempt as assailants fired automatic weapons towards his car, wounding the militant leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mashable.com/2014/05/13/ukraine-luhansk-assassination-valery-bolotov/|title=Pro-Russian Separatist Leader Survives Assassination Attempt in Ukraine|publisher=Mashable.com|date=May 13, 2014|accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolotov was then briefly captured by the [[Armed Forces of Ukraine|Ukrainian army]] on May 17 after he attempted to re-enter [[Luhansk]] following his having received treatment for his injury at a hospital in Russia.&lt;ref name=captured&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/17/us-ukraine-crisis-idUSBREA4G02F20140517|title=Separatists recapture their leader on the eve of peace talks in Ukraine|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=May 17, 2014|accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, armed supporters of the Luhansk People's Republic attacked the Ukrainian army checkpoint where Bolotov was being held shortly afterwards and successfully freed the "People's Governor".&lt;ref name=captured/&gt;

[[Luhansk People's Republic]]'s Parliament elected Bolotov head of the republic on 18 May 2014.&lt;ref name=Taganrog/&gt;

Bolotov resigned on 14 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/08/14/world/europe/ukraine-crisis/|title=Ukraine fighting: Rebel official resigns; shells fall on Donetsk|agency=[[CNN]]|date=August 14, 2014|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
Bolotov was found dead on 27 January 2017 in his own home in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. The causes of his death are currently being investigated. The preliminary results of clinical tests showed an [[acute heart failure]] as reason of death.&lt;ref name="mk"&gt;[http://www.mk.ru/incident/2017/01/27/telo-byvshego-glavy-lnr-valeriya-bolotova-obnaruzhila-ego-supruga.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lenta.ru/news/2017/01/27/bolotov|title=Умер первый глава ЛНР|date=2017-01-27|publisher=[[Lenta.ru]]|accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ria.ru/world/20170127/1486662842.html Умер первый глава ЛНР Валерий Болотов]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/588c91bb9a7947556f854664?from=newsfeed|title=СМИ узнали причину смерти первого главы ЛНР Валерия Болотова|date=2017-01-28|publisher=[[Росбизнесконсалтинг]]|accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ria.ru/world/20170127/1486662842.html Умер первый глава ЛНР Валерий Болотов]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[poisoning]] later was suspected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukropnews24.com/bolotovs-wife-suspects-that-her-husband-was-poisoned/|title=Bolotov’s wife suspects that her husband was poisoned|author=|date=31 January 2017|website=ukropnews24.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Before taking up his position at the EPO, he was the Director General of the [[State Intellectual Property Office (Croatia)|State Intellectual Property Office of the Republic of Croatia]].

==Career==
He started his career as an economist with the Federal Yugoslavian Railways in [[Banja Luka]]. From 1989 to 1992 he was an adviser at the Croatian Ministry of Science &amp; Technology in Zagreb. In 1992, he joined the Croatian State Intellectual Property Office which came under the remit of the Ministry of Science &amp; Technology and he held various posts there until 2003 when he left to become a partner in a private-sector intellectual property management company, Korper, Haramija &amp; Topić Ltd.&lt;ref name="cv-wipo"/&gt;

In 2004, he was appointed as Director General of the Croatian State Intellectual Property Office for a four-year term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2004_05_59_1329.html Decision signed by Prime Minister Ivo Sanader appointing Zeljko Topić as Director General of the DZIV], dated 5 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity he represented Croatia on the [[Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation]] from 2004 onward. Croatia became a full member of the EPO in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.org/about-us/organisation/member-states/date.html List of EPC Contracting States sorted according to the date of accession]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Topić was proposed as a candidate for a senior management position at the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ip-watch.org/2006/05/03/croatia-advances-candidate-for-a-top-position-at-wipo/ "Croatia Advances Candidate For A Top Position At WIPO"], Intellectual Property Watch, 3 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; His candidacy was unsuccessful.

In March 2008, his mandate as Director General of the Croatian State Intellectual Property Office was renewed for a second four-year term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2008_03_35_1149.html Decision signed by Prime Minister Ivo Sanader renewing Topić's mandate for a second term], dated 19 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he was once again an unsuccessful candidate for a senior management position at the WIPO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ip-watch.org/2009/05/05/wipo-buzzing-with-possible-names-for-top-cabinet-posts/ "WIPO Buzzing With Possible Names For Top Cabinet Posts"], Intellectual Property Watch, 5 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, his mandate as Director General of the Croatian State Intellectual Property Office was renewed for a third term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2012_02_16_452.html Decision signed by Prime Minister Zoran Milanović renewing Topić's mandate for a third term], dated 26 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a visit by a delegation from the Hungarian Intellectual Property Office to the Croatian State Intellectual Property Office in February 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dziv.hr/hr/novosti/posjet-delegacije-madarskog-ureda-za-intelektualno-vlasnistvo-zavodu,81.html Posjet delegacije Mađarskog ureda za intelektualno vlasništvo Zavodu]&lt;/ref&gt; he was presented with the Jedlik Ányos Award (Honoris Causa)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.szellemitulajdon.hu/cikkek/kituntek/%C5%BEeljko-topi%C4%87-/205/%C5%BEeljko-topi%C4%87--%E2%80%93-honoris-causa-jedlik-anyos-dijas,-2012.html Željko Topić – Honoris causa Jedlik Ányos-díjas, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hungarian Intellectual Property Office: [http://www.sztnh.gov.hu/English/hivatalrol/MSZH_dijak/Jedlik_dij/Jedlik-rendelet.html The Jedlik Ányos Award]&lt;/ref&gt; in recognition of his contribution to the protection of intellectual property.

In March 2012, the Administrative Council of the EPO announced his appointment as Vice-President at the EPO in charge of the Directorate-General Administration which has responsibility for support services such as Human Resources, General Administration, Buildings and Facility Management, and the Language Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2012/20120328.html Announcement by the Administrative Council of the EPO], dated 28 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He commenced his duties as EPO Vice-President in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.epo.org/the-epo/towards-a-more-diverse-epo/ Towards a more diverse EPO], EPO Blog dated 2 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; His term of office as Director General of the Croatian State Intellectual Property Office ended on 30 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2012_05_53_1328.html Decision signed by Prime Minister Zoran Milanović confirming the termination of Topić's term of office effective as from 30 April 2012], dated 27 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Topić's appointment as EPO Vice-President has been controversial. Following the announcement of his appointment in March 2012, a number of critical news reports appeared in the Croatian media. These reports referred to a series of alleged irregularities which were said to have occurred during his period of office as Director-General of the State Intellectual Property Office and which it was claimed had not been properly investigated by the competent state authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/nagradio-ga-pantovcak-umjesto-progona-ravnatelj-zavoda-koji-nadzire-zamp-promoviran/608936.aspx "Nagradio ga Pantovčak: Umjesto progona, ravnatelj Zavoda koji nadzire ZAMP promoviran!"] index.hr, 10 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tjedno.hr/index.php/categoryblog/998-protiv-topia-se-vodi-estpostupaka "Protiv Topića se vodi šest postupaka"] tjedno.hr, 11 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/index-doznaje--jovanovic-istrazuje-dziv-gdje-je-milijun-kuna-tko-se-vozio-u-preskupim-automobilima/611883.aspx "Index doznaje – Jovanović istražuje DZIV: Gdje je milijun kuna, tko se vozio u (pre)skupim automobilima?"] index.hr, 26 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jutarnji.hr/kazneni-progon-nije-ga-zaustavio--sanaderov-kadar-zeljko-topic--smijenjen-na-vlastiti-zahtjev--dobio-jos-bolji-posao/1024680/ "Sanaderov kadar Željko Topić, smijenjen na vlastiti zahtjev, dobio još bolji posao"] jutarnji.hr, 28 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the State Intellectual Property Office issued a press release on 30 April 2012 attributing the media reports to what it called "unprofessional journalism" and dismissing the allegations raised against Topić as "arbitrary", "unfounded" and based on "malicious accusations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dziv.hr/files/File/novosti/Priopcenje_za_javnost_30042012.pdf “PRIOPCENJE ZA JAVNOST”], press release issued by the Croatian State Intellectual Property Office, 30 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A complaint which Topić filed in reaction to an article written by the journalist Slavica Lukić for "Jutarnji list" was, however, rejected by the Ethics Council of the Croatian Journalist's Association (Croatian: ''Hrvatsko Novinarsko Društvo'' or HND) in September 2012. The Ethics Council found that Lukić had verified the relevant information with the appropriate official institutions and that the disputed article was not written with the intention of defaming anyone but rather in defence of the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hnd.hr/hr/Zakljucci7sjednice2012/show/66192/ "Findings of the 7th Session of the HND Ethics Council held on 18 September 2012 - Željko Topić vs Slavica Lukić"], Hrvatsko Novinarsko Društvo, 16 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnevno.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/85582-bivsi-ravnatelj-dziv-a-zeljko-topic-zakinuo-je-hrvatske-knjizevnike-za-milijune-kuna.html “Bivši ravnatelj DZIV-a Željko Topić zakinuo je hrvatske književnike za milijune kuna”], dnevno.hr, 28 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, a Croatian NGO Juris Protecta raised questions about Topić's EPO appointment and submitted a petition to the [[European Parliament]] calling for an independent investigation into the matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ip-watch.org/2014/05/15/epo-internal-strife-spills-over-into-european-parliament-human-rights-court/ “EPO Internal Strife Spills Over Into European Parliament, Human Rights Court”], Intellectual Property Watch, 15 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/dontsleep/btEDPh6u7o0 Press release issued by Juris Protecta]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Intellectual Property Watch]], Topić and EPO President [[Benoît Battistelli]] claim that the allegations amount to a “smear campaign.” However, a former Assistant Director at the Croatian State Intellectual Property Office, Vesna Stilin, has disputed the claims made by Topić and Battistelli in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/nagradio-ga-pantovcak-umjesto-progona-ravnateljzavoda-koji-nadzire-zamp-promoviran/608936.aspx "Nagradio ga Pantovčak: Umjesto progona, ravnatelj Zavoda koji nadzire ZAMP promoviran!" / "The President rewarded him: Instead of facing prosecution, the Director of the Office responsible for monitoring ZAMP was promoted!"], index.hr, 10 April 2014, (in Croatian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ip-watch.org/2014/10/06/right-of-reply-to-ip-watch-article-epo-internal-strife-spills-over-into-european-parliament-human-rights-court/ Right Of Reply To IP-Watch Article:“EPO Internal Strife Spills Over Into European Parliament, Human Rights Court”], Intellectual Property Watch, 6 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported in the Croatian media that a criminal complaint against Topic was dismissed as inadmissible by the Zagreb County Court on 19 February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tjedno.hr/zupanijski-sud-odbacio-istragu-protiv-zeljka-topica-kao-nedopustenu/ ŽUPANIJSKI SUD ISTRAGU PROTIV ŽELJKA TOPIĆA PROGLASIO NEDOPUŠTENOM], tjedno.hr, 23 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Details of the case were not published but it was subsequently reported that it is currently{{old|2017|12|29}} pending before a three-judge appeal panel of the Zagreb County Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnevno.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/pusickina-lobistica-za-un-u-sredistu-medunarodnog-skandala-908177 Pusićkina lobistica za UN u središtu međunarodnog skandala], dnevno.hr, 27 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
