'''''Acadiensis: Journal of the History of the Atlantic Region''''' (fr: '''''Acadiensis: Revue d'histoire de la région Atlantique''''') is a semi-annual [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] covering the history of [[Atlantic Canada]].The current [[editors-in-chief]] are Suzanne Morton ([[McGill University]]) and Andrew Nurse ([[Mount Allison University]]). It is published by the Department of History at the [[University of New Brunswick]], with articles in either English or French. The name ''Acadiensis'' originated with an earlier periodical with the same name, a general interest quarterly magazine for the [[Maritime provinces]], with an emphasis on local history. It was published in Saint John, New Brunswick by [[David Russell Jack]] from 1901 to 1908 but failed due to insufficient financial support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buckner|first=P.

'''American English''' ('''AmE''', '''AE''', '''AmEng''', '''USEng''', '''en-US'''),&lt;ref&gt;&lt;code&gt;en-US&lt;/code&gt; is the [[language code]] for ''U.S. English'', as defined by [[ISO standard]]s (see [[ISO 639-1]] and [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]) and [[Internet standard]]s (see [[IETF language tag]]).&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called '''United States English''' or '''U.S. English''',&lt;ref&gt;Plichta, Bartlomiej, and Dennis R. Preston (2005). "The /ay/s Have It: The Perception of /ay/ as a North-South Stereotype in the United States English." ''Acta Linguistica Hafniensia'' 37.1: 107-130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zentella, A. C. (1982). Spanish and English in contact in the United States: The Puerto Rican experience.

English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and is the common language used by the federal government, to the extent that all laws and compulsory education are practiced in English. Although not an officially established language of the whole country, English is considered the ''[[de facto]]'' language and is given official status by 32 of the 50 state governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.languagepolicy.net/archives/langleg.htm |title=Language Legislation in the U.S.A. |publisher=languagepolicy.net |date=1 February 2012 |author=Crawford, James |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.us-english.org/view/1034 |title=U.S. English Efforts Lead West Virginia to Become 32nd State to Recognize English as Official Language |publisher=us-english.org |deadurl=yes |accessdate=13 May 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401151700/http://us-english.org/view/1034 |archivedate=1 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, while both Spanish and English have equivalent status in the local courts of [[Puerto Rico]], under federal law, English is the official language for any matters being referred to the [[United States district court]] for the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/48/864 |title=48 U.S. Code § 864 - Appeals, certiorari, removal of causes, etc.; use of English language &amp;#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of English in the United States is a result of [[British colonization of the Americas|English and British colonization of the Americas]]. The first wave of English-speaking settlers arrived in North America during the 17th century, followed by further migrations in the 18th and 19th centuries. Since then, American English has developed into new dialects, in some cases under the influence of [[West African languages|West African]] and [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and other languages of successive waves of immigrants to the United States.

American English varieties form a linguistic continuum of dialects more similar to each other than to English dialects of other countries, including some common pronunciations and other features found nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mtd3a-56ysUC&amp;pg|title= A Handbook of Varieties of English|author-first=William A.|author-last=Kretzchmar|editor-first=Bernd|editor-last=Kortmann|editor2-first=Edgar W.|editor2-last=Schneider|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=Berlin/New York|year=2004|pages=262–263|isbn= 9783110175325}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any [[North American English]] [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] perceived as free of noticeably local, ethnic, or cultural [[markedness|markers]] is popularly called [[General American|"General" or "Standard" American]], a fairly uniform standard of broadcast mass media and the highly educated. Otherwise, according to Labov, with the major exception of [[Southern American English]], regional accents throughout the country are not yielding to this standard,&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William (2010). "[http://www.cogsci.msu.edu/DSS/2011-2012/Labov/POLC%20Chapters%201-3.pdf Chapter 1]".''The Politics of Language Change: Dialect Divergence in America''. The University of Virginia Press. Pre-publication draft. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; and historical and present linguistic evidence does not support the notion of there being one single "mainstream" American accent.&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William (2012). ''Dialect diversity in America: The politics of language change''. University of Virginia Press. pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mtd3a-56ysUC&amp;pg|title= A Handbook of Varieties of English|author-first=William A.|author-last=Kretzchmar|editor-first=Bernd|editor-last=Kortmann|editor2-first=Edgar W.|editor2-last=Schneider|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=Berlin/New York|year=2004|page=262|isbn= 9783110175325}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, the sound of American English continues to evolve, with some local accents disappearing, but several larger regional accents emerging.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/speak/ahead/|title=Do You Speak American: What Lies Ahead|accessdate=2007-08-15|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Regional vocabularies of American English|North American English regional phonology}}

While written American English is largely standardized across the country, there are several recognizable variations in the spoken language, both in pronunciation and in vernacular vocabulary. The regional sounds of present-day American English are reportedly engaged in a complex phenomenon of "both convergence and divergence": some accents are homogenizing and [[accent levelling|levelling]], while others are diversifying and deviating further away from one another.&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William. 2012. Dialect diversity in America: the politics of language change. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[William Labov]] summarized the current state of regional American accents as follows:&lt;ref name="Labov 2010"&gt;Labov, William (2010). ''[http://www.cogsci.msu.edu/DSS/2011-2012/Labov/POLC%20Chapters%201-3.pdf The Politics of Language Change: Dialect Divergence in America]''. The University of Virginia Press. Pre-publication draft. p. 53-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some regional American English has undergone "vigorous new sound changes" since the mid-nineteenth century onwards, spawning relatively recent [[Mid-Atlantic American English|Mid-Atlantic]] (centered on [[Philadelphia]] and [[Baltimore]]), [[Western Pennsylvania English|Western Pennsylvania]] (centered on [[Pittsburgh]]), [[Inland Northern American English|Inland Northern]] (centered on [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], and the [[Great Lakes region]]), [[Midland American English|Midland]] (centered on [[Indianapolis]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]) and [[Western American English|Western regional accents]], all of which "are now more different from each other than they were fifty or a hundred years ago". Similarly, distinguishing features of the [[Eastern New England English|Eastern New England]] (centered on [[Boston]]) and [[New York City English|New York City accents]] appear to be stable. "On the other hand, dialects of many smaller cities have receded in favor of the new regional patterns";&lt;ref name="Labov 2010"/&gt; for example, the traditional local accents of [[Charleston, SC|Charleston]] and of [[Cincinnati, OH|Cincinnati]] have given way to the Midland regional accent, and of [[St. Louis, MO|St. Louis]] now approaches an Inland Northern or Midland accent. At the same time, the [[Southern American English|Southern regional accent]], despite the huge population it covers,&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt; "is on the whole slowly receding due to cultural stigma: younger speakers everywhere in the South are shifting away from the [[markedness|marked]] features of Southern speech". Finally, the extremely local-level [[High Tider|"Hoi Toider" dialect]] shows the paradox of receding among younger speakers in the islands of North Carolina's [[Outer Banks]], yet strengthening in the islands of the [[Chesapeake Bay]].

&lt;div style="text-align:center; background:#bfd7ff; width:75%"&gt;'''Major regional dialects of American English'''&lt;/div&gt;
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-2}}{{Map of American English}} The map above shows the major regional dialects of American English (in [[all caps]]) plus smaller and more local dialects, as demarcated primarily by Labov et al.'s ''[[The Atlas of North American English]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the related Telsur Project's [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/home.html#regional regional maps]. Any region may also contain speakers of a "[[General American]]" accent that resists the marked features of their region. Furthermore, this map does not account for speakers of ethnic or cultural varieties (such as [[African-American English]], [[Chicano English]], [[Cajun English]], etc.). All regional American English, unless specifically stated otherwise, can be assumed to be [[rhoticity in English|rhotic]], with the [[father–bother merger|''father–bother'' merger]], [[Mary–marry–merry merger|''Mary–marry–merry'' merger]], and [[/æ/ tensing|pre-nasal "short ''a''" tensing]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Dialects are considered "[[rhoticity in English|rhotic]]" if they pronounce the ''r'' sound in all historical environments, without ever "dropping" this sound. The [[father–bother merger|''father–bother'' merger]] is the pronunciation of the unrounded {{IPAc-en|ɒ}} vowel variant (as in ''cot, lot, bother'', etc.) the same as the {{IPAc-en|ɑː}} vowel (as in ''spa, haha, Ma''), causing words like ''con'' and ''Kahn'' and like ''sob'' and ''[[Saab Automobile|Saab]]'' to [[homophone|sound identical]], with the vowel usually realized in the back or middle of the mouth as {{IPA|[ɑ~ä]}}. Finally, most of the U.S. participates in a continuous nasal system of the "short ''a''" vowel (in ''cat, trap, bath'', etc.), causing {{IPA|/æ/}} to be pronounced with the tongue raised and with a glide quality (typically sounding like {{IPA|[ɛə]}}) particularly when before a [[nasal consonant]]; thus, ''mad'' is {{IPA|[mæd]}}, but ''man'' is more like {{IPA|[mɛən]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern New England===
{{main|Eastern New England English}}
[[Markedness|Marked]] New England speech is mostly associated with eastern New England, centering on Boston and Providence, and traditionally includes some notable degree of [[Rhoticity in English|''r''-dropping]] (or non-rhoticity),&lt;ref name="Labov 2006 137, 141"/&gt; as well as the [[back vowel|back tongue positioning]] of the {{IPAc-en|uː}} vowel (to {{IPA|[u]}}) and the {{IPAc-en|aʊ}} vowel (to {{IPA|[ɑʊ~äʊ]}}).&lt;ref name="Labov 2006 230"/&gt; In and north of Boston, the {{IPAc-en|ɑr}} sound is famously centralized or even fronted. Boston shows a [[cot–caught merger]], while Providence keeps the same two vowels sharply distinct.

===New York City===
{{main|New York City English}}
[[New York City English]] prevails in a relatively small but nationally recognizable dialect region in and around [[New York City]], including [[Long Island]] and northeastern [[New Jersey]]. The [[New York accent]] includes some notable degree of [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhoticity]] and a locally unique [[æ tensing|short-''a'' vowel pronunciation split]]. New York City English otherwise broadly follows Northern patterns, except that the {{IPAc-en|aʊ}} vowel is fronted. The [[cot–caught merger]] is markedly resisted in the New York metropolitan area, as depicted in popular stereotypes like ''tawwk'' and ''cawwfee'', with this {{sc2|THOUGHT}} vowel being typically tensed and diphthongal.

===South===
{{main|Southern American English}}
Most [[Older Southern American English|older Southern speech]] along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts was non-rhotic, though, today, almost all Southern dialects are rhotic, and even "hyper-rhotic",&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Dean (2013). "[http://digitalrepository.unm.edu/ling_etds/15 The Southern Accent and 'Bad English': A Comparative Perceptual Study of the Conceptual Network between Southern Linguistic Features and Identity]". UNM Digital Repository: Electronic Theses and Dissertations. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; with a very strongly enunciated, "bunched-tongue" ''r'' sound. The modern accent is defined most recognizably by the {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} vowel losing its [[diphthong|gliding quality]] to approach {{IPA|[aː~äː]}}, the initiation event for the Southern Vowel Shift. This vowel shift involves the "[[Southern drawl]]" that makes short [[front vowel]]s into distinct-sounding [[gliding vowel]]s.&lt;ref name="Labov 2006 125"/&gt; The most advanced sub-varieties exist in the southern Appalachian cities and certain areas of Texas. Non-Southern Americans tend to stereotype Southern accents negatively, associating them with slowness, lack of education, bigotry, and religious or political conservatism,&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, 2013, p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; with labels for the accent such as "hick" or "hillbilly".&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, 2013, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Southerners themselves tend to have mixed judgments of their own accents, some negative but some positively associated with a laid-back, plain, or humble attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, 2013, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
===North===
{{main|Northern American English}}
Since the mid-twentieth century, a distinctive new Northern speech pattern has developed near the Canadian border of the United States, centered on the central and eastern [[Great Lakes]] region (but only on the American side). Linguists call this region the "[[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]]", as defined by its [[Northern Cities Vowel Shift]] ({{IPAc-en|æ}} raising, {{IPAc-en|ɑː}} fronting, and other vowel changes), occurring in the same region whose "standard Midwestern" speech was the basis for [[General American]] in the mid-twentieth century, though prior to the full Northern Cities Vowel Shift. The Inland Northern accent was lampooned on the television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'''s "[[Bill Swerski's Superfans]]" segments, though the accent's shift may be reversing in certain communities.&lt;ref name="lansing"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://msusociolinguistics.weebly.com/uploads/9/3/1/9/9319621/reversalandreorganization_nwav44.pdf | format = PDF | first1 = S.

===Midland===
{{main|Midland American English}}
Between the traditional American dialect areas of the "North" and "South" is what linguists have long called the "Midland" encompassing states situated in the lower Midwest, beginning west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The vocabulary of its older speakers was divided into two discrete subdivisions, the "North Midland" that begins north of the [[Ohio River]] valley area, and the "South Midland" speech, which to the average American ear has a slight trace of the "[[Southern American English|Southern accent]]" (especially due to some degree of {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} glide weakening). Modern Midland speech is transitional between a presence and absence of the [[cot–caught merger]]. Historically, Pennsylvania was a home of the Midland dialect; however, this state of early English-speaking settlers has now largely split off into new dialect regions, with distinct [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia]] and [[Pittsburgh dialect]]s documented since the middle of the twentieth century.

===West===
{{main|Western American English}}
A generalized Midland speech continues westward until becoming a somewhat internally diverse [[Western American English]] that unites the entire western half of the country, mostly unified by a firm [[cot–caught merger]] and a [[conservative (linguistics)|conservatively]] backed pronunciation of the long ''oh'' sound in ''goat, toe, show'', etc., but a fronted pronunciation of the long ''oo'' sound in ''goose, lose, tune,'' etc. Western speech itself contains such advanced sub-types as [[Pacific Northwest English]] and [[California English]], with the native-speaker [[Chicano English|English of Mexican Americans]] also being a sub-type primarily of the Western dialect. The island state of [[Hawaii]], though primarily English-speaking, is also home to a [[creole language]] known commonly as [[Hawaiian Pidgin]], and some Hawaii residents speak English with a Pidgin-influenced accent.

===Other varieties===
Although no longer region-specific,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Trudgill, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; [[African-American Vernacular English]], which remains the native variety of most working- and middle-class [[African Americans]], has a close relationship to Southern dialects and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans, including [[hip hop culture]]. [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] have also developed native-speaker varieties of English. The best-studied Latino Englishes are [[Chicano English]], spoken in the West and Midwest, and [[New York Latino English]], spoken in the [[New York metropolitan area]]. Additionally, ethnic varieties such as [[Yeshivish|Yeshiva English]] and "[[Yinglish]]" are spoken by some [[American Jews]], [[Cajun English|Cajun Vernacular English]] by some [[Cajun]]s in southern Louisiana, [[Pennsylvania Dutch English]] by some [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] in Pennsylvania and the Midwest, and [[American Indian English]]es have been documented among diverse Indian tribes.

==Phonology==
{{See also|General American|North American English regional phonology}}

Compared with [[English language in England|English as spoken in England]], North American English&lt;ref&gt;''[[North American English]]'' (Trudgill, p. 2) is a collective term used for the varieties of the English language that are spoken in both the United States and [[Canada]].&lt;/ref&gt; is more homogeneous, and any North American accent that exhibits a majority of the most common phonological features is known as "[[General American]]". This section mostly refers to such widespread or mainstream pronunciation features that characterize American English.

Studies on historical usage of English in both the United States and the United Kingdom suggest that spoken American English did not simply deviate away from period British English, but retained certain now-archaic features contemporary [[British English]] has since lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-the-difference-between-theater-and-theatre.htm |title=What Is the Difference between Theater and Theatre? |publisher=Wisegeek.org |date=2015-05-15 |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these is the rhoticity common in most American accents, because in the 17th century, when English was brought to the Americas, most English in England was also rhotic. The preservation of rhoticity has been further supported by the influences of [[Hiberno-English]], [[West Country English]] and [[Scottish English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=25484343 |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25484343?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102054774863 |title=Early Mainland Residues in Southern Hiberno-English |accessdate=29 May 2013 |doi=10.2307/25484343 |volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most varieties of North American English, the sound corresponding to the letter {{Angbr|r}} is a [[postalveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[ɹ̠]}} or [[retroflex approximant]] {{IPA|[ɻ]}} rather than a trill or tap (as often heard, for example, in the English accents of Scotland or India). A unique "bunched tongue" variant of the approximant ''r'' sound is also associated with the United States, and seems particularly noticeable in the Midwest and South.&lt;ref&gt;''A Handbook of Varieties of English'', Bernd Kortmann &amp; Edgar W. Schneider, Walter de Gruyter, 2004, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Non-RhoticityUSA.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The red dots show every U.S. metropolitan area where over 50% non-rhotic speech has been documented among some of that area's local white speakers. Non-rhotic speech may be heard from [[African-American English|black speakers]] throughout the whole country.&lt;ref&gt;Labov, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Traditionally, the "East Coast" comprises three or four major linguistically distinct regions, each of which possesses English varieties both distinct from each other as well as quite internally diverse: [[New England]], the [[New York metropolitan area]], the [[Mid-Atlantic states]] (centering on Philadelphia and Baltimore), and the [[Southern United States]]. The only traditionally [[rhoticity in English|''r''-dropping]] (or non-rhotic) regional accents of American English are all spoken along the Atlantic Coast and parts of the Gulf Coast (particularly still in Louisiana), because these areas were in close historical contact with [[England]] and imitated prestigious varieties of ''r''-dropping London (a feature now widespread throughout most of England) at a time when they were undergoing changes.&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, non-rhoticity is confined in the United States to the accents of [[New England English|eastern New England]], [[New York City English|New York City]], older speakers of the [[older Southern American English|former plantation South]], and [[African-American Vernacular English]] (though the vowel-consonant cluster found in "bird", "work", "hurt", "learn", etc. usually retains its ''r'' pronunciation, even in these non-rhotic accents). Other than these few varieties, American accents are [[Rhoticity in English|rhotic]], pronouncing every instance of the {{angbr|r}} sound.

Many British accents have evolved in other ways compared to which [[General American English]] has remained relatively more [[conservative (linguistics)|conservative]], for example, regarding the typical southern British features of a [[trap–bath split]], fronting of {{IPAc-en|oʊ}}, and [[H-dropping]], none of which typical American accents show. The innovation of [[T-glottalization|/t/ glottaling]], which does occur before a consonant (including a syllabic [[Coronal consonant|coronal]] [[nasal consonant]], like in the words ''button'' or ''satin'') and word-finally in General American, additionally occurs variably between vowels in British English. On the other hand, General American is more innovative than the dialects of England, or English elsewhere in the world, in a number of its own ways:
* The [[Phonological history of the low back vowels#Father–bother merger|merger of {{IPA|/ɑ/}} and {{IPA|/ɒ/}}]], making ''father'' and ''bother'' rhyme. This change, known as the ''father–bother'' merger&lt;!--Link already present in previous sentence.--&gt; is in a transitional or completed stage nearly universally in North American English. Exceptions are in northeastern [[New England English]], such as the [[Boston accent]], [[New York accent]], and [[Mid-Atlantic American English|Mid-Atlantic States accents]], and many [[Southern American English|Southern accents]], prominently including [[Yat dialect|New Orleans accents]].{{clarify|reason=Verification needed for "many" Southern dialects.

* About half of all Americans merge of the vowels {{IPA|/ɑ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}}. This is the so-called [[cot–caught merger]], where words like ''cot'' and ''caught'' are [[homophone]]s. This change has occurred most firmly in eastern New England (Boston area), [[Pittsburgh English|Greater Pittsburgh]], and the whole western half of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For speakers who do not merge ''caught'' and ''cot'', the [[lot–cloth split]] has taken hold. This change took place prior to the unrounding of the ''cot''.  It is the result of the lengthening and raising of the ''cot'' vowel, merging with the ''caught'' vowel in many cases before [[voiceless fricative]]s (as in ''cloth, off''), which is also found in some varieties of British English, as well as before {{IPA|/ŋ/}} (as in ''strong, long),'' usually in ''gone,'' often in ''on,'' and irregularly before {{IPA|/ɡ/}} ''(log, hog, dog, fog'').
* The ''strut'' vowel, rather than the ''lot'' or ''thought'' vowel, is used in the function words ''was, of, from, what, everybody, nobody, somebody, anybody'', and, for some speakers, ''because'' and ''want'', when stressed.&lt;ref&gt;According to ''Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary, Eleventh Edition''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.infoplease.com/want |title=Want: meaning and definitions|publisher=Dictionary.infoplease.com |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/55/W0025500.html |title=want.

* [[English-language vowel changes before historic r|Vowel mergers]] before intervocalic {{IPA|/ɹ/}}: The [[Mary–marry–merry merger|Mary–marry–merry]], [[Mirror–nearer merger|serious–Sirius]], and [[English-language vowel changes before historic r#Hurry–furry merger|hurry–furry]] mergers are found in most American English dialects.  However, exceptions exist primarily along the east coast.
** Americans vary slightly in their pronunciations of [[R-colored vowel#Rhotacization|R-colored vowels]]—such as those in {{IPA|/ɛəɹ/}} and {{IPA|/ɪəɹ/}}—sometimes monophthongizing towards {{IPA|[ɛɹ]}} and {{IPA|[ɪɹ]}} or [[tenseness|tensing]] towards {{IPA|[eɪɹ]}} and {{IPA|[i(ə)ɹ]}} respectively, causing pronunciations like {{IPA|[peɪɹ]}} for ''pair''/''pear'' and {{IPA|[piəɹ]}} for ''peer''/''pier''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Accents of English|volume=3|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=J.

The word ''sure'' is also part of this rhyming set as it is commonly pronounced {{IPA|[ʃɚ]}}.
* [[English consonant-cluster reductions#''Yod''-dropping|Dropping of {{IPA|/j/}}]] is much more extensive than in most of England. In most North American accents, {{IPA|/j/}} is dropped after all [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] and interdental consonants (i.e. everywhere except after /p/, /b/, /f/, /h/, /k/, and /m/) so that ''new, duke, Tuesday, presume'' are pronounced {{IPA|[nu]}}, {{IPA|[duk]}}, {{IPA|[ˈtuzdeɪ]}}, {{IPA|[pɹɪˈzum]}}.
* [[/æ/ tensing]] in environments that vary widely from accent to accent. With most American speakers, for whom the phoneme {{IPA|/æ/}} operates under a somewhat continuous system, {{IPA|/æ/}} has both a tense and a lax [[allophone]] (with a kind of "continuum" of possible sounds between those two extremes, rather than a definitive split). In these accents, {{IPA|/æ/}} is overall realized before [[nasal stop]]s as more tense (approximately {{IPA|[eə̯]}}), while other environments are more lax (approximately the standard {{IPA|[æ]}}); for example, note the vowel sound in {{IPA|[mæs]}} for ''mass'', but {{IPA|[meə̯n]}} for ''man''). In some American accents, though, specifically those from [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]], {{IPA|[æ]}} and {{IPA|[eə̯]}} are entirely separate (or "split") phonemes, for example, in ''planet'' {{IPA|[pɫænɪ̈t̚]}} vs. ''plan it'' {{IPA|[pɫeənɪ̈t̚]}}. This is often called the Mid-Atlantic [[/æ/#Phonemic tensing|split-''a'']] system. Note that these vowels move in the opposite direction in the mouth compared to the backed British "[[broad A]]"; this phenomenon has been noted as related to the increasingly rare phenomenon of older speakers of the eastern New England (Boston) area for whom {{IPA|/æ/}} changes to {{IPA|/ɑ/}} before {{IPA|/f/, /s/, /θ/, /ð/, /z/, /v/}} alone or when preceded by a [[homorganic]] nasal.

{{/æ/ tensing in North American English|hidden=yes}}
* [[Flapping]] of intervocalic {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} to [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} before unstressed vowels (as in "bu''tt''er" {{IPA|[ˈbʌɾəɹ]}}, "par''t''y" {{IPA|[ˈpɑɹɾi]}}) and syllabic {{IPA|/l/}} ("bo''tt''le" {{IPA|[ˈbɑɾəɫ]}}), as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel ("wha''t'' else" {{IPA|[wʌˈɾɛɫs]}}, "wha''t''ever" {{IPA|[wʌˈɾɛvəɹ]}}). Thus, for most speakers, pairs such as ''ladder/latter, metal/medal,'' and ''coating/coding'' are pronounced the same, except with the stressed {{IPA|/aɪ/}} (see below).
* [[Canadian raising]] of {{IPA|/aɪ/}}: many speakers split the sound {{IPA|/aɪ/}} based on its presence before either a voiceless or voiced consonant, so that in ''writer'' it is pronounced {{IPA|[ʌɪ]}} but in ''rider'' it is pronounced {{IPA|[äɪ]}} (because {{IPA|[t]}} is a voiceless consonant while {{IPA|[d]}} is voiced). This is a form of [[Canadian raising]] but, unlike more extreme forms of that process, does not affect {{IPA|/aʊ/}}. In many areas and idiolects, a distinction between what elsewhere become homophones through this process is maintained by vowel lengthening in the vowel preceding the formerly voiced consonant, ''e.g.'', {{IPA|[ˈɹʌɪɾɚ]}} for "writer" as opposed to {{IPA|[ˈɹäɪɾɚ]}} for "rider".
** Many speakers in the [[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]], [[North Central American English]], and [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia]] dialect areas raise {{IPA|/aɪ/}} before voiced consonants in certain words as well, particularly {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[g]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}. Hence, words like ''tiny'', ''spider'', ''cider'', ''tiger'', ''dinosaur'', ''cyber-'', ''beside'', ''idle'' (but sometimes not ''idol''), and ''fire'' may contain a raised nucleus. The use of {{IPA|[ʌɪ]}} rather than {{IPA|[aɪ]}} in such words is unpredictable from phonetic environment alone, though it may have to do with their acoustic similarity to other words that ''do'' contain {{IPA|[ʌɪ]}} before a voiceless consonant, per the traditional Canadian-raising system. Hence, some researchers have argued that there has been a [[phonemic split]] in these dialects; the distribution of the two sounds is becoming more unpredictable among younger speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1087&amp;context=curej|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|title=The Spread of Raising: Opacity, lexicalization, and diffusion|date=November 11, 2007|accessdate=September 21, 2016|last=Freuhwald|first=Josef T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* L-velarization: England's typical distinction between a "clear L" (i.e. [[l (IPA)|{{IPA|[l]}}]]) and a "dark L" (i.e. [[velarized alveolar lateral approximant|{{IPA|[ɫ]}}]] or sometimes even [[Velar lateral approximant|{{IPA|[ʟ]}}]]) is much less noticeable in nearly all dialects of American English; it is often altogether absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language Talent and Brain Activity: Trends in Applied Linguistics|editors=Grzegorz Dogil, Susanne Maria Reiterer, and Walter de Gruyter|year=2009|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH|page=299|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfIGxRtdXsQC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;dq="general+american"+"velarized"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, most U.S. speakers pronounce all "L" sounds with a tendency to be "dark", meaning with some degree of [[velarization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|p=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only notable exceptions to this are in some Spanish-influenced U.S. English varieties (such as [[New York Latino English|East Coast Latino English]], which typically shows a clear "L" in [[syllable onset]]s); in [[New York City English]], where the {{IPA|/l/}} is clear in prevocalic positions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=John C.|title=Accents of English: Vowel 3: Beyond the British Isles|date=April 8, 1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=515|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Accents_of_English_Volume_3.html?id=484eVQ7t8TMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Older Southern American English|older, moribund Southern speech]] of the U.S., where "L" is clear in an [[intervocalic consonant|intervocalic]] environment between [[front vowel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''A Handbook of Varieties of English'', Bernd Kortmann &amp; Edgar W. Schneider, Walter de Gruyter, 2004, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Both intervocalic {{IPA|/nt/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} may commonly be realized as {{IPA|[ɾ̃]}} or simply {{IPA|[n]}}, making ''winter'' and ''winner'' homophones in fast or non-careful speech.
* The vowel {{IPA|/ɪ/}} in unstressed syllables generally merges with {{IPA|/ə/}} ([[Phonological history of English high front vowels#Weak-vowel merger|weak-vowel merger]]), so ''effect'' is pronounced like ''affect''.

Some mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include:
* [[Horse–hoarse merger]], making the vowels {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} before 'r' homophones, with homophonous pairs like ''horse/hoarse, corps/core, for/four, morning/mourning, war/wore,'' etc. [[homophone]]s.
* [[Wine–whine merger]], making pairs like ''wine/whine, wet/whet, Wales/whales, wear/where,'' etc. [[homophone]]s, in most cases eliminating {{IPA|/ʍ/}}, the [[voiceless labiovelar fricative]]. Many older varieties of southern and western American English still keep these distinct, but the merger appears to be spreading.

==Vocabulary==
{{main|American English vocabulary}}
The process of coining new lexical items started as soon as English-speaking British-American colonists began borrowing names for unfamiliar flora, fauna, and topography from the [[Native American languages]].&lt;ref name="Skeat"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=ltoDXfkzZGsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=moose+etymology&amp;ots=sSxd8GVMPH&amp;sig=8iFiF5oNiF2E0U5LHoZUUF1dHHU&amp;f=falseM |title=Principles of English etymology: The native element - Walter William Skeat |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such names are ''[[Virginia opossum|opossum]], [[raccoon]], [[squash (fruit)|squash]]'', ''[[moose]]'' (from [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]),&lt;ref name="Skeat" /&gt; ''[[wigwam]]'', and ''[[moccasin]]''. The languages of the other colonizing nations also added to the American vocabulary; for instance, ''[[cookie]]'', from [[Dutch Language|Dutch]]; ''[[kindergarten]]'' from [[German language|German]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://german.about.com/library/blvoc_gerloan.htm|title=You Already Know Some German Words!|publisher=|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[levee]]'' from [[French language|French]]; and ''[[rodeo]]'' from [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI9308630/ |title="The history of Mexican folk foodways of South Texas: Street vendors, o" by Mario Montano |publisher=Repository.upenn.edu |date=1992-01-01 |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=ROmDu-bYMRYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=rodeo+etymology&amp;ots=Q8MWUXWWeS&amp;sig=1mCnpypy9pF4E4WoGV_gSVXElGk&amp;q=rodeo |title=What's in a Word?: Etymological Gossip about Some Interesting English Words - Robert M.

Most [[Mexican Spanish]] contributions came after the [[War of 1812]], with the opening of the West, like ''[[ranch]]'' (now a common [[ranch house|house style]]). New forms of dwelling created new terms ''([[Land lot|lot]], waterfront)'' and types of homes like ''[[log cabin]], [[adobe]]'' in the 18th century; ''[[apartment]], [[Wikt:shanty|shanty]]'' in the 19th century; ''project, [[condominium]], [[townhouse]], [[mobile home]]'' in the 20th century; and parts thereof ''([[driveway]], breezeway, [[backyard]])''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Industry and material innovations from the 19th century onwards provide distinctive new words, phrases, and idioms through [[railroad]]ing (see further at [[rail terminology]]) and [[transport]]ation terminology, ranging from types of roads (''dirt roads'', ''[[freeway]]s'') to infrastructure ''([[parking lot]], [[overpass]], [[rest area]]),'' to automotive terminology often now standard in English internationally.&lt;ref&gt;A few of these are now chiefly found, or have been more productive, outside the U.S.; for example, ''jump,'' "to drive past a traffic signal"; ''block'' meaning "building", and ''center,'' "central point in a town" or "main area for a particular activity" (cf. Oxford English Dictionary).&lt;/ref&gt; Already existing English words—such as ''[[General store|store]], [[Retailing|shop]], [[lumber]]''—underwent shifts in meaning; others remained in the U.S. while changing in Britain. From the world of business and finance came new terms (''[[merger]], [[downsize]], [[Net income|bottom line]]''), from sports and gambling terminology came, specific jargon aside, common everyday American idioms, including [[English language idioms derived from baseball|many idioms related to baseball]]. The names of some American inventions remained largely confined to North America (''[[elevator]], [[gasoline]]'') as did certain automotive terms (''[[truck]]'', ''[[Trunk (car)|trunk]]'').

New foreign loanwords came with 19th and early 20th century European immigration to the U.S.; notably, from [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] ''([[chutzpah]], schmooze'') and [[German language|German]] (''[[hamburger]], [[Hot dog|wiener]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19970923 |title=The Maven's Word of the Day: gesundheit |publisher=[[Random House]] |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Trudgill|Trudgill, Peter]] (2004). ''New-Dialect Formation: The Inevitability of Colonial Englishes''.&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of English colloquialisms from various periods are American in origin; some have lost their American flavor (from ''[[Okay|OK]]'' and ''cool'' to ''[[nerd]]'' and ''[[24/7]]),'' while others have not ''([[have a nice day]], for sure);''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&amp;which_entry=009421%23x1%23x1%23day&amp;selected_word=day&amp;search_word=day |title=Definition of day noun from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary|publisher=Oup.com |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&amp;which_entry=036903%23x1%23x1%23sure&amp;selected_word=sure&amp;search_word=sure#sure_adv |title=Definition of sure adjective from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary|publisher=Oup.com |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; many are now distinctly old-fashioned ''(swell, groovy).'' Some English words now in general use, such as ''hijacking, [[disc jockey]], boost, bulldoze'' and ''[[jazz]],'' originated as American slang.

American English has always shown a marked tendency [[functional shift|to use nouns as verbs]].&lt;ref name = "iqiyyl"&gt;Trudgill, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of nouns that are now also verbs are ''interview, advocate, vacuum, lobby, pressure, rear-end, transition, feature, profile, spearhead, skyrocket, showcase, bad-mouth, [[vacation]], major,'' and many others. [[Compound (linguistics)|Compounds]] coined in the U.S. are for instance ''[[foothill]], [[landslide]]'' (in all senses), ''[[Wikt:backdrop|backdrop]], [[teenager]],
[[brainstorming|brainstorm]], [[Wikt:bandwagon|bandwagon]], [[hitchhike]], smalltime, and a huge number of others. Some are euphemistic ''([[human resources]], [[affirmative action]], [[correctional facility]]).'' Many compound nouns have the verb-and-preposition combination: ''stopover, lineup, tryout, spin-off, [[shootout]], holdup, hideout, comeback, [[makeover]],'' and many more. Some prepositional and phrasal verbs are in fact of American origin (''win out, hold up, back up/off/down/out, face up to'' and many others).&lt;ref&gt;British author [[George Orwell]] (in ''English People'', 1947, cited in OED s.v. ''lose)'' criticized an alleged "American tendency" to "burden every verb with a preposition that adds nothing to its meaning (''win out'', ''lose out'', ''face up to'', etc.)".&lt;/ref&gt;

Noun endings such as ''-ee (retiree), -ery (bakery), -ster (gangster)'' and ''-cian (beautician)'' are also particularly productive in the U.S.&lt;ref name = "iqiyyl"/&gt; Several verbs ending in ''-ize'' are of U.S. origin; for example, ''fetishize, prioritize, burglarize, accessorize, [[weatherization|weatherize]],'' etc; and so are some [[back-formation]]s ''(locate, fine-tune, curate, donate, emote, upholster'' and ''enthuse).'' Among syntactical constructions that arose are ''outside of, headed for, meet up with, back of,'' etc. Americanisms formed by alteration of some existing words include notably ''pesky, phony, rambunctious, buddy, [[sundae]], skeeter, sashay'' and ''kitty-corner.'' Adjectives that arose in the U.S. are, for example, ''lengthy, bossy, [[cuteness|cute]]'' and ''cutesy, punk'' (in all senses), ''sticky'' (of the weather), ''through'' (as in "finished"), and many colloquial forms such as ''peppy'' or ''wacky''.

A number of words and meanings that originated in [[Middle English]] or [[Early Modern English]] and that have been in everyday use in the United States have since disappeared in most varieties of British English; some of these have cognates in [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland Scots]]. Terms such as ''[[autumn|fall]]'' ("autumn"), ''[[faucet]]'' ("tap"), ''[[diaper]]'' ("nappy"), ''[[candy]]'' ("sweets"), ''[[Frying pan|skillet]]'', ''[[eyeglasses]]'', and ''[[obligate]]'' are often regarded as Americanisms. ''Fall'' for example came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like "fall of the leaf" and "fall of the year".&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|fall}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gotten'' ([[past participle]] of ''get'') is often considered to be largely an Americanism.&lt;ref&gt;''A Handbook of Varieties of English'', Bernd Kortmann &amp; Edgar W. Schneider, Walter de Gruyter, 2004, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Other words and meanings were brought back to Britain from the U.S., especially in the second half of the 20th century; these include ''hire'' ("to employ"), ''I guess'' (famously criticized by [[H. W. Fowler]]), ''[[baggage]]'', ''hit'' (a place), and the adverbs ''overly'' and ''presently'' ("currently"). Some of these, for example, ''[[monkey wrench]]'' and ''[[wastebasket]]'', originated in 19th century Britain. The adjectives ''mad'' meaning "angry", ''smart'' meaning "intelligent", and ''sick'' meaning "ill" are also more frequent in American (and Irish) English than British English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/images/elt/oald7/synald7_angry.gif |title=angry |publisher=Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |deadurl=yes |accessdate=29 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309172328/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/images/elt/oald7/synald7_angry.gif |archivedate=9 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/images/elt/oald7/synald7_intelligent.gif |title=intelligent |publisher=Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |deadurl=yes |accessdate=29 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309172334/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/images/elt/oald7/synald7_intelligent.gif |archivedate=9 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/ill |title=Definition of ill adjective from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |publisher=Oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com |accessdate=29 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527173051/http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/ill |archive-date=2013-05-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguist [[Bert Vaux]] created a survey, completed in 2003, polling English speakers across the United States about their specific everyday word choices, hoping to identify regionalisms.&lt;ref&gt;Vaux, Bert and Scott Golder. 2003. [http://dialect.redlog.net/ The Harvard Dialect Survey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430083828/http://dialect.redlog.net/ |date=2016-04-30 }}. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Linguistics Department.&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that most Americans prefer the term ''sub'' for a long sandwich, ''soda'' (but ''pop'' in the Great Lakes region and generic ''coke'' in the South) for a sweet and bubbly [[soft drink]],&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Joshua (2013). "[http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jakatz2/files/dialectposter.png Beyond 'Soda, Pop, or Coke].' North Carolina State University.&lt;/ref&gt; ''you'' or ''you guys'' for the plural of ''you'' (but ''y'all'' in the South), ''[[sneakers]]'' for athletic shoes (but often ''tennis shoes'' outside the Northeast), and ''[[shopping cart]]'' for a cart used for carrying supermarket goods.

==Differences between British and American English==
{{Main|Comparison of American and British English}}
American English and [[British English]] (BrE) often differ at the levels of phonology, phonetics, vocabulary, and, to a much lesser extent, grammar and orthography.
The first large American dictionary, ''An American Dictionary of the English Language'', known as [[Webster's Dictionary]], was written by [[Noah Webster]] in 1828, codifying several of these spellings.

Differences in grammar are relatively minor, and do not normally affect mutual intelligibility; these include: different use of some [[auxiliary verb]]s; formal (rather than notional) agreement with [[collective noun]]s; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: ''learned''/''learnt'', ''burned''/''burnt'', ''snuck/sneaked'', ''dove/dived'') although the purportedly "British" forms can occasionally be seen in American English writing as well; different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE ''in school,'' BrE ''at school''&lt;!--when it means "to be a student"--&gt;); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE ''to the hospital'', BrE ''to hospital''; contrast, however, AmE ''actress Elizabeth Taylor'', BrE ''the actress Elizabeth Taylor''). Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other,&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, John (2006). ''British or American English?''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-37993-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and American English is not a standardized set of dialects.

Differences in [[orthography]] are also minor. The main differences are that American English usually uses spellings such as ''flavor'' for British ''flavour'', ''fiber'' for ''fibre'', ''defense'' for ''defence'', ''analyze'' for ''analyse'', ''license'' for ''licence'', ''catalog'' for ''catalogue'' and ''traveling'' for ''travelling''. Noah Webster popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them. Rather, "he chose already existing options [...] on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology".&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, John. "The Effects of the Revolution on Language", in ''A Companion to the American Revolution''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008. p.599&lt;/ref&gt; Other differences are due to the [[francophile]] tastes of the 19th century [[Victorian era]] Britain (for example they preferred ''programme'' for ''program'', ''manoeuvre'' for ''maneuver'', ''cheque'' for ''check'', etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Pam (2004). ''The Cambridge Guide to English Usage''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-62181-X}}, pp. 34 and 511.&lt;/ref&gt; AmE almost always uses ''-ize'' in words like ''realize''. BrE prefers ''-ise'', but also uses ''-ize'' on occasion (see [[Oxford spelling]]).

There are a few differences in punctuation rules. British English is more tolerant of run-on sentences, called "comma splices" in American English, and American English requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which British rules would place them outside. American English also favors the double quotation mark over single.&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{cite web

 |title=Punctuating Around Quotation Marks
 |publisher=Style Guide of the American Psychological Association
 |year=2011
 |format=blog
 |accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AmE sometimes favors words that are [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE ''transportation'' and BrE ''transport'' or where the British form is a [[back-formation]], such as AmE ''burglarize'' and BrE ''burgle'' (from ''burglar''). However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.

British English also differs from American English in that "schedule" can be pronounced with either [sk] or [ʃ].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=English Pronouncing Dictionary|last=Jones|first=Daniel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1991|isbn=9780521425865|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chiang Mai''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|tʃ|æ|ŋ|_|ˈ|m|aɪ}}, from {{lang-th|เชียงใหม่}} {{IPA-th|tɕʰīəŋ màj||Th-Chiang Mai.ogg}}, {{lang-nod|ᨩ᩠ᨿᨦ ᩲᩉ᩠ᨾ᩵}} {{IPA-nod|t͡ɕīəŋ.màj||nod-chiangmai.ogg}}) sometimes written as "Chiengmai" or "Chiangmai", is the largest city in [[northern Thailand]]. It is the capital of [[Chiang Mai Province]] and was a former capital of the kingdom of [[Lan Na]] (1296–1768), which later became the [[Kingdom of Chiang Mai]], a [[tributary state]] of [[Siam]] from 1774 to 1899, and finally the seat of princely rulers until 1939. It is {{convert|700|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Bangkok]] near the highest mountains in the country. The city sits astride the [[Ping River]], a major tributary of the [[Chao Phraya River]].

Chiang Mai means "New City" and was so named because it became the new capital of Lan Na when it was founded in 1296, succeeding [[Chiang Rai (city)|Chiang Rai]], the former capital founded in 1262.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|208–209}}

In May 2006 Chiang Mai was the site of the [[Chiang Mai Initiative]], concluded between the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] and the "ASEAN+3" countries, ([[China]], [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]]). Chiang Mai was one of three Thai cities contending for Thailand's bid to host the World [[Expo 2020]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TCEB keen on World Expo 2020 |url=http://www.tceb.or.th/exhibition-now/issue5/issue5_1_4.php |accessdate=13 Jan 2013 |newspaper=Exhibition Now |date=October–November 2010 |author=S.T.

In early–December 2017, Chiang Mai was awarded the UNESCO title of Creative City. In 2015, Chiang Mai was on the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage inscription. Chiang Mai was one of two [[Tourism in Thailand|tourist destinations in Thailand]] on [[TripAdvisor]]'s 2014 list of "25 Best Destinations in the World", where it stands at number 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tripadvisor.com/TravelersChoice-Destinations |title=Best Destinations in the World; Travelers' Choice Awards 2014 |publisher=TripAdvisor |accessdate=2014-12-12}}{{failed verification|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang Mai's historic importance is derived from its close proximity to the Ping River and major trading routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thailand/chiang-mai-province/shopping/other/chiang-mai-night |title=Chiang Mai Night Bazaar in Chiang Mai Province, Thailand |publisher=Lonely Planet |date=2011-10-24 |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northcm.ac.th/web/eng/ex/history.php |title=มหาวิทยาลัยนอร์ท-เชียงใหม่ [North – Chiang Mai University&amp;#93; |publisher=Northcm.ac.th |accessdate=2012-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424043041/http://www.northcm.ac.th/web/eng/ex/history.php |archivedate=April 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While officially the city (''thesaban nakhon'', [[Thesaban#City-municipality|"city municipality"]]) of Chiang Mai only covers most parts of the [[Mueang Chiang Mai District]] with a population of 160,000, the city's sprawl extends into several neighboring districts. The Chiang Mai metropolitan area has a population of nearly one million people, more than half the total of [[Chiang Mai Province]].

The city is subdivided into four ''[[khwaeng]]'' ([[ward (electoral subdivision)|electoral wards]]): Nakhon Ping, Srivijaya, Mengrai, and Kawila. The first three are on the west bank of the Ping River, and Kawila is on the east bank. Nakhon Ping District includes the northern part of the city. Srivijaya, Mengrai, and Kawila consist of the western, southern, and eastern parts, respectively. The city center—within the city walls—is mostly within Srivijaya ward.&lt;ref name="Wards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmcity.go.th/aboutus/map.php |title=Chiang Mai Municipality |year=2008 |publisher=Chiang Mai City |language=Thai |accessdate=2008-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915212133/http://www.cmcity.go.th/aboutus/map.php |archivedate=September 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The river, the largest in the region, runs from north to south, forming a river basin east of Chiang Mai. Mae Ping River also served as the route of trade and communication between Chiang Mai and its controlled states in Lanna, as well as the outside world.

Chiang Mai succeeded Chiang Rai as the capital of Lan Na. Pha Yu enlarged and fortified the city, and built [[Wat Phra Singh]] in honor of his father Kham Fu.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|226–227}}  The ruler was known as the [[chao (monarchy)|''chao'']]. The city was surrounded by a [[moat]] and a [[defensive wall]] since nearby [[Taungoo Dynasty]] of the [[Bamar people]] was a constant threat, as were the armies of the [[Mongol Empire]], which only decades earlier had conquered most of [[Yunnan]], China, and in 1292 overran the bordering [[Dai people|Dai]] kingdom of [[Chiang Hung]].

With the decline of Lan Na, the city lost importance and was occupied by the Taungoo in 1556.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thailand/chiang-mai-province/chiang-mai/history |title=History of Chiang Mai – Lonely Planet Travel Information |publisher=Lonelyplanet.com |date=2006-09-19 |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang Mai formally became part of the [[Thonburi Kingdom]] in 1775 by an agreement with Chao [[Kavila]], after the Thonburi king [[Taksin]] helped drive out the Taungoo Bamar.

The modern municipality dates to a sanitary district (''[[sukhaphiban]]'') that was created in 1915.

=== Climate ===
Chiang Mai has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw''), tempered by the low latitude and moderate elevation, with warm to hot weather year-round, though nighttime conditions during the dry season can be cool and much lower than daytime highs. The maximum temperature ever recorded was {{convert|42.4|°C|1}} in May 2005.&lt;ref name="MaxTemperature"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geodata.us/weather/show.php?usaf=483270&amp;uban=99999&amp;m=5&amp;c=Thailand&amp;y=2005 |title=Daily Climate Weather Data Statistics |publisher=Geodata.us |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cold and hot weather effects occur immediately but cold effects last longer than hot effects and contribute to higher cold related motility risk among old people aged more than 85 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Effects of temperature on mortality in Chiang Mai city, Thailand: A time series study|url=http://www-ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-069X-11-36|accessdate=2 July 2018|author=Yuming Guo, Kornwipa Punnasiri and Shilu Tongly|publisher=Environmental Health|date=9 July 2012}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Air pollution ===
{{see also|Environmental issues in Thailand}}
A continuing environmental issue in Chiang Mai is the incidence of [[air pollution]] that primarily occurs every year towards the end of the dry season between February and April. In 1996, speaking at the Fourth International Network for Environmental Compliance and Enforcement conference—held in Chiang Mai that year—the Governor Virachai Naewboonien invited guest speaker Dr. Jakapan Wongburanawatt, Dean of the Social Science Faculty of [[Chiang Mai University]], to discuss air pollution efforts in the region. Dr. Wongburanawatt stated that, in 1994, an increasing number of city residents attended hospitals suffering from respiratory problems associated with the city's air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;"Chiang Mai's Environmental Challenges", Fourth International Conference of Environmental Compliance and Enforcement&lt;/ref&gt;

During the February–March period, air quality in Chiang Mai often remains below recommended standards, with fine-particle dust levels reaching twice the standard limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthoria.com/air-pollution-levels-in-chiang-mai-rising.html |title=Air Pollution in Chiang Mai: Current Air Quality &amp; PM-10 Levels |publisher=Earthoria |date=2008-02-27 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Bangkok Post'', corporations in the agricultural sector, not farmers, are the biggest contributors to smoke pollution. The main source of the fires is forested area being cleared to make room for new crops. The new crops to be planted after the smoke clears are not rice and vegetables to feed locals. A single crop is responsible: corn. "The true source of the haze...sits in the boardrooms of corporations eager to expand production and profits. A chart of Thailand's growth in world corn markets can be overlaid on a chart of the number of fires. It is no longer acceptable to scapegoat hill tribes and slash-and-burn agriculture for the severe health and economic damage caused by this annual pollution." These data have been ignored by the government. The end is not in sight, as the number of fires has increased every year for a decade, and data shows more pollution in late-February 2016 than in late-February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Officials in a haze|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/872752/officials-in-a-haze|accessdate=23 February 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern centre of the Meteorological Department has reported that low-pressure areas from [[China]] trap forest fire smoke in the mountains along the Thai-[[Myanmar]] border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/03/11/national/national_30029004.php |title=Chiang Mai's air pollution still high |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |date=2007-03-11 |accessdate=2010-04-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501060645/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/03/11/national/national_30029004.php |archive-date=2011-05-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted between 2005 and 2009 showed that average [[Particulates|PM10 rates]] in Chiang Mai during February and March were considerably above the country's safety level of 120 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, peaking at 383 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; on 14 March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/30054.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[PM2.5]] rates (fine particles 75% smaller than PM10) reached 183 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in Chiang Mai in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chiangmaicitylife.com/news/chiang-mai-records-highest-pm2-5-readings-world-march-6-2018/|title=Chiang Mai CityNews - Chiang Mai Records Highest PM2.5 Readings in the World, March 6, 2018|website=www.chiangmaicitylife.com|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the acceptable level of PM10 is 50 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and PM2.5 is 25 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2006/WHO_SDE_PHE_OEH_06.02_eng.pdf |title=WHO Air quality guidelines for particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide, Global Update 2005 |publisher=WHO |year=2006 |accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To address the increasing amount of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector in Chiang Mai, the city government has advocated the use of non-motorised transport (NMT). In addition to its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the NMT initiative addresses other issues such as traffic congestion, air quality, income generation for the poor, and the long-term viability of the tourism industry.&lt;ref name="CDKN"/&gt; It has been said that smoke pollution has made March "the worst month to visit Chiang Mai".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siamandbeyond.com/smoke-pollution-makes-march-the-worst-month-to-visit-chiang-mai-northern-thailand/&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Wiang Kum Kam]] is at the site of an old city on the southern outskirts of Chiang Mai. King [[Mangrai]] lived there for ten years before the founding of Chiang Mai. The site includes many ruined temples.
* [[Wat Umong]] is a forest and cave wat in the foothills west of the city, near [[Chiang Mai University]]. Wat U-Mong is known for its "fasting Buddha", representing the Buddha at the end of his long and fruitless fast prior to gaining enlightenment.
* Wat RamPoeng (Tapotaram), near Wat U-Mong, is known for its meditation center (Northern Insight Meditation Center). The temple teaches the traditional [[vipassanā]] technique and students stay from 10 days to more than a month as they try to meditate at least 10 hours a day.

== Administration ==
The Administration of Chiang Mai Municipality is responsible for an area that covers approximately 40.216 square kilometers and consists of 4 Municipal Districts, 14 sub-districts, 89 municipal communities, and approximately 70,000 households.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmcity.go.th/|title=Chiang Mai Municipality|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Municipal Act B.E. 2496 (1953, reviewed in 2003), the duties of the Municipality cover a lot of areas which include clean water supply, waste and sewage disposal, communicable disease control, public training and education, public hospitals and electricity, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The mayor, or the highest executive, is directly elected by the eligible voters in the municipal area. The mayor serves a four-year term and is assisted by no more than four deputy mayors appointed directly by the mayor. The mayor will thus be permitted to appoint deputies, secretaries and advisors including the mayor himself or herself totally no more than 10. The current Mayor is Tussanai Burabupakorn, as of June 2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Municipal Council is the legislative body of the municipality. It has the power to issue ordinances by laws that do not contradict with the laws of the country. The municipal council applies to all people living in the municipal area. The Chiang Mai City Municipal Council is composed of 24 elected members from 4 municipal districts who each serves a 4-year term.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Chiang Mai hosts many Thai festivals, including:
* [[Loi Krathong]] (known locally as Yi Peng), held on the full moon of the 12th month of the traditional [[Thai lunar calendar]], being the full moon of the second month of the old Lanna calendar. In the Western calendar this usually falls in November. Every year thousands of people assemble floating banana-leaf containers (''krathong'') decorated with flowers and candles and deposit them on the waterways of the city in worship of the Goddess of Water. Lanna-style [[sky lantern]]s (''khom fai'' or ''kom loi''), which are hot-air balloons made of paper, are launched into the air. These sky lanterns are believed to help rid the locals of troubles and are also used to decorate houses and streets.
* [[Songkran (Thailand)|''Songkran'']] is held in mid-April to celebrate the traditional Thai New Year. Chiang Mai has become one of the most popular locations to visit during this festival. A variety of religious and fun-related activities (notably the indiscriminate citywide water fight) take place each year, along with parades and Miss Songkran beauty competition.
* [[Chiang Mai Flower Festival]] is a three-day festival held during the first weekend in February each year; this event occurs when Chiang Mai's temperate and tropical flowers are in full bloom.
* Tam Bun Khan Dok, the [[Inthakhin (pillar)|Inthakhin]] (City Pillar) Festival, starts on the day of the waning moon of the sixth lunar month and lasts 6–8 days.

=== Language ===
The inhabitants speak [[Northern Thai language|Northern Thai]], also known as ''Lanna'' or ''Kham Mueang''. The script used to write this language, called the [[Tai Tham alphabet]], is studied only by scholars, and the language is commonly written with the standard [[Thai alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Forbes, Andrew, "The Peoples of Chiang Mai", in Penth, Hans, and Forbes, Andrew, ''A Brief History of Lan Na''. Chiang Mai City Arts and Cultural Centre, Chiang Mai, 2004, pp. 221–256.&lt;/ref&gt; English, Chinese, and Japanese are used in hotels and travel-related businesses.

=== Museums ===
* Chiang Mai City Arts and Cultural Center.
* [[Chiang Mai National Museum]] highlights the history of the region and the Kingdom of [[Lan Na]].
* [[Tribal Museum]] showcases the history of the local mountain tribes.
* Mint Bureau of Chiang Mai or Sala Thanarak, Treasury Department, Ministry of Finance, Rajdamnern Road (one block from AUA Language Center) has an old coin museum open to the public during business hours. The Lan Na Kingdom used leaf (or line) money made of brass and silver bubbles, also called "pig-mouth" money. Nobody has been able to duplicate the technique of making pig-mouth money, and because the silver is very thin and breakable, good pieces are now very rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalthaimint.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=160%3Athai-coins-history&amp;catid=44%3A2010-03-27-17-09-13&amp;Itemid=117&amp;lang=en |title=Thai Coins History |accessdate=19 Sep 2011 |date=28 Mar 2010 |publisher=[[Royal Thai Mint]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402155914/http://www.royalthaimint.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=160%3Athai-coins-history&amp;catid=44%3A2010-03-27-17-09-13&amp;Itemid=117&amp;lang=en |archivedate=April 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of bus stations link the city to central, southeast, and northern Thailand. The central Chang Puak Terminal (north of Chiang Puak Gate) provides local services within Chiang Mai Province. The Chiang Mai Arcade bus terminal northeast of the city centre (which can be reached with a [[songthaew]] or tuk-tuk ride) provides services to over 20 other destinations in Thailand including Bangkok, Pattaya, Hua Hin, and Phuket. There are several services a day from Chiang Mai Arcade terminal to Mo Chit Station in Bangkok (a 10- to 12-hour journey).

The state railway operates 10 trains a day to [[Chiang Mai Station]] from [[Bangkok]]. Most journeys run overnight and take approximately 12–15 hours. Most trains offer first-class (private cabins) and second-class (seats fold out to make sleeping berths) service. Chiang Mai is the northern terminus of the Thai railway system.

[[Chiang Mai International Airport]] receives up to 28 flights a day from Bangkok (flight time about 1 hour 10 minutes) and also serves as a local hub for services to other northern cities such as [[Chiang Rai]], [[Phrae]], and [[Mae Hong Son]]. International services also connect Chiang Mai with other regional centers, including cities in other Asian countries.

The locally preferred form of transport is personal motorbike and, increasingly, private car. Local public transport is via [[tuk-tuk]], [[songthaew]], bus,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.manager.co.th/local/viewnews.aspx?NewsID=9580000141524|title=เชียงใหม่เปิดตัวและแสดงข้อมูลระบบขนส่งสาธารณะ จับทุกภาคส่วนลงนามร่วมพัฒนาต่อเนื่อง|work=Manager Online|access-date=2018-03-03|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[cycle rickshaw|rickshaw]].

As population density continues to grow, greater pressure is placed upon the city's transportation system. During peak hours, the road traffic is often badly congested. The city officials as well as researchers and experts have been trying to find feasible solutions to tackle the city's traffic problems. Most of them agree that factors such as lack of public transport, increasing number of motor vehicles, inefficient land use plan and urban sprawl, have led to these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peraphan|first=Jittrapirom|last2=Hermann|first2=Knoflacher|last3=Markus|first3=Mailer|date=2017-01-01|title=Understanding decision makers’ perceptions of Chiang Mai city's transport problems an application of Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) methodology|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146517306579|journal=Transportation Research Procedia|series=World Conference on Transport Research - WCTR 2016 Shanghai. 10–15 July 2016|volume=25|issue=Supplement C|pages=4438–4453|doi=10.1016/j.trpro.2017.05.350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Smart City" initiative ==
In February 2017, the Digital Economy Promotion Agency (DEPA) (under Thailand's Digital Economy and Society Ministry) announced that 36.5 million baht would be invested into developing Chiang Mai into an innovation-driven "smart city". Chiang Mai was the second city in Thailand, after Phuket and along with Khon Kaen,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/news/business/EconomyAndTourism/30305038|title=DE Ministry pushing for nationwide|work=The Nation|first=Jirapan|last=Boonnoon|date=2017-01-27|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be developed using the "smart city" model. The model aims to capture and populate multiple levels of information (including building, social, environmental, governmental, and economic data) from sources like sensors, real-time traffic information, and social forums for access by managers, governments, and citizens using mobile apps, tablets, and dashboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/Startup_and_IT/30327378|title=Prayut gets long-distance look at 'smart' 3D Chiang Mai|work=The Nation|date=22 September 2017|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Smart City" outlook (integrating Information and Communications Technology (ICT) with the Internet of Things (IOT)), is viewed to be critical both for secondary cities with burgeoning urban population like Chiang Mai,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Da Hsuan|first1=Feng|last2=Hai Ming|first2=Liang|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/opinion/30327874|title=Thailand can be smart-city flagship for Belt and Road|work=The Nation|date=28 September 2017|access-date=2018-03-01|format=Editorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as part of Thailand's move to be digital hub of ASEAN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Plan-to-make-Phuket-and-Chiang-Mai-smart-cities-30268781.html|author=Asina Pornwasin|title=Plan to make Phuket and Chiang Mai 'smart cities'|work=The Nation|date=15 September 2015|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of private sector investment, together with public sector partnership, is key to promote digital entrepreneurship. Prosoft Comtech, a Thai software company, has spent 300 million baht to build its own "Oon IT Valley"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oonitvalley.com/|title=Oon IT Valley ออนไอทีวัลเลย์ เมืองไอที วิถีล้านนา|website=Oon IT Valley ออนไอทีวัลเลย์ เมืองไอที วิถีล้านนา|language=th|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a 90 [[Rai (unit)|rai]] plot of land as a community for tech start-ups, Internet of Things technology, software programmers and business process outsourcing services. It is aimed to both increase the size of Chiang Mai's digital workforce, as well as attract foreign digital talent to Chiang Mai.&lt;ref name=BP-20170211/&gt;

=== Smart transportation ===
In January 2018, it was announced that Chiang Mai would be launching "Mobike In", a bike-sharing app that would see the introduction of some 500 smart bikes on the streets. The smart bikes would be available for use for both locals and tourists. It is reported that as a start, the bikes would be placed at convenient locations including the Three Kings monument, Tha Pae Gate and Suan Buak Haad Park, as well as in the old town. The "Mobike In" project is sponsored by [[Advanced Info Service]] (Thailand's largest mobile phone operator), in collaboration with the  [[Tourism Authority of Thailand]] (Chiang Mai Office), together with local universities, public and private sectors. The project aims to promote non-motorised transportation and support eco-tourism. Speaking at the launch at the Lanna Folklife Museum, Deputy Governor Puttipong Sirimart stated that the introduction of such "smart transportation" was a positive move in Chiang Mai's transformation into a "Smart City" (part of the "Thailand 4.0" vision).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chiangmaicitylife.com/news/chiang-mai-get-500-smart-bikes-known-mobike/|title=Chiang Mai To Get 500 Smart Bikes, Known as MOBIKE IN|website=Citylife Chiang Mai|date=2018-01-19|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smart agriculture ===
Phongsak Ariyajitphaisal, DEPA's Chiang Mai branch manager, stated that one of the areas its smart city initiative would be promoting was "smart agriculture". Eighty percent of Chiang Mai Province's population are farmers, mostly small-scale, and increasing productivity through use of ICT has the potential to improve the local economy and living standards.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} DEPA has also provided funding to Chiang Mai's [[Maejo University]], to develop wireless sensor systems for better farmland irrigation techniques, to reduce use of water sprinklers and increase productivity. The university is also developing agricultural drones that can spray fertilizers and pesticides on crops which, if successful, will result in lower costs. The drones may also detect and monitor fires and smoke pollution.&lt;ref name=BP-20170211/&gt;

Under the 2011 IBM "Smarter Cities Challenge", IBM experts recommended smarter food initiatives focused on creating agricultural data for farmers, including price modelling, farmer-focused weather forecasting tools, an e-portal to help farmers align crop production with demand, as well as branding of Chiang Mai produce. Longer-term recommendations included implementing traceability, enabling the tracking of produce from farm to consumer, smarter irrigation as well as flood control and early warning systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prd-ibm-smarter-cities-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/applications/chiang-mai-thailand-summary-2011.pdf|title=Chiang Mai Summary Report|website=IBM Smarter Cities Challenge|date=2011|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smart healthcare ===
As part of the smart city project supported by IBM, Chiang Mai is also looking to use technology to boost its presence as a medical tourism hub. In 2011, IBM launched its Smarter Cities Challenge, a three-year, 100 city, 1.6 billion baht (US$50 million) program where teams of experts study and make detailed recommendations to address local important urban issues. Chiang Mai won a grant of about US$400,000 in 2011. The IBM team focused on smarter healthcare initiatives, aimed at making Chiang Mai and the University Medical Clinic a medical hub,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Sambandaraksa|first1=Don|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/world-updates/197580/ibm-focuses-on-chiang-mai|title=IBM focuses on Chiang Mai|work=Bangkok Post|date=22 September 2010|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--dated reference--&gt; as well as improving efficiency of hospitals for improved service delivery. For example, healthcare providers could use real-time location tracking of patients and hospital assets to increase efficiency and build an internationally recognised service identity. Electronic medical record technology can also be adopted to standardise information exchanges to link all medical service providers, even including traditional medicine and spas.&lt;ref name=IMTJ-20110602/&gt; Similar ideas include linking patient databases and healthcare asset information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Leesa-Nguansuk|first1=Suchit|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/local-news/1049621/a-tale-of-smart-cities|title=A tale of smart cities|work=Bangkok Post|date=1 August 2016|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In partnership with the Faculty of Medicine at Chiang Mai University, the team of experts aim to enhance the quality of medical care available to the community, both urban and rural, as well as develop Chiang Mai into a centre for medical tourism with the infrastructure for supporting international visitors seeking long-term medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Boonnoon|first1=Jirapan|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/business/Thai-arm-of-IBM-spreads-wings-in-Laos-30186495.html|title=Thai arm of IBM spreads wings in Laos|work=The Nation|date=19 July 2012|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the largest city in northern Thailand, Chiang Mai already receives some long stay healthcare visitors, largely Japanese. Its main advantage over Bangkok is lower costs of living. Quality services at low prices are a major selling point in mainstream healthcare, dental and ophthalmologic care as well as Thai traditional medicine. Its local university is also developing specializations in robotic surgery and geriatric medicine to accommodate a future aging population.&lt;ref name=IMTJ-20110602&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imtj.com/news/smarter-technology-medical-tourism-thailand/|title=Smarter technology: medical tourism in Thailand|website=International Medical Travel Journal (IMTJ)|date=2 June 2011|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smart tourism ===
DEPA also reported that it has developed a mobile app that uses augmented reality technology to showcase various historical attractions in Chiang Mai, in line with the government's policy to promote Chiang Mai as a world heritage city.&lt;ref name=BP-20170211&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/local-news/1196657/chiang-mai-to-become-smart-city|title=Chiang Mai to become smart city|last=Leesa-Nguansuk|first=Suchit|work=Bangkok Post|date=11 February 2017|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang Mai is estimated to have 32,000–40,000 hotel rooms&lt;ref name="Internal Tourism in Chiang Mai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP-20160521" /&gt; and [[Chiang Mai International Airport]] (CNX) is Thailand's fourth largest airport, after Suvarnabhumi (BKK), Don Mueang (DMK), and Phuket (HKT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 (Statistic Report 2013)|url=http://airportthai.co.th/main/en/1115-air-transport-statistic|website=About AOT: Air Transport Statistic|publisher=Airports of Thailand PLC|accessdate=2014-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207204925/http://airportthai.co.th/main/en/1115-air-transport-statistic|archive-date=2014-12-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thailand Convention and Exhibition Bureau (TCEB) aims to market Chiang Mai as a global [[Meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions|MICE]] city as part of a five-year plan. The TCEB forecasts revenue from MICE to rise by 10 percent to 4.24 billion baht in 2013 and the number of MICE travellers to rise by five percent to 72,424.&lt;ref name=MICE-Nation&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amnatcharoenrit|first1=Bamrung|title=Chiang Mai sees boost in MICE sector|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/business/Chiang-Mai-sees-boost-in-MICE-sector-30215752.html|accessdate=2014-12-09|issue=2013-09-27|publisher=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influx of tourists has put a strain on the city's natural resources. Faced with rampant unplanned development, air and water pollution, waste management problems, and traffic congestion, the city has launched a non-motorised transport (NMT) system. The initiative, developed by a partnership of experts and with support from the [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]], aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create employment opportunities for the urban poor. The climate compatible development strategy has gained support from policy-makers and citizens alike as a result of its many benefits.

Tourism has also brought benefits for local community of Chiang Mai. For example, tourism has played a tremendous role in promoting arts and crafts market in Chiang Mai. Tourists have increased demand for traditional crafts and art forms that has resulted in the incentives for the local artists to enhance their work thus adding to the prosperity of the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Managing Intermediate Size Cities: Sustainable Development in a Growth Region of Thailand|author=Michael Romanos &amp; Christopher Auffrey|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht The GeoJournal Library Volume 69, 2002, Pages 127-151|date= May 15, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian Identity''' (also known as '''Identity Christianity''')&lt;ref name="Doctrine"/&gt; is a [[racist]], [[anti-Semitic]], and [[white supremacist]] interpretation of [[Christianity]] which holds that only [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]], [[Celtic people|Celtic]], [[Nordic race|Nordic]], [[Aryan race|Aryan]] people and those of kindred blood are the descendants of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]] and hence the descendants of the ancient [[Israelites]] (primarily as a result of the [[Assyrian captivity]]).&lt;ref name="SPLC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Christian Identity |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/christian-identity |website=www.splcenter.org |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Identity is not an [[organized religion]], and is not connected with specific [[Christian denomination]]s; instead, it is independently practiced by individuals, [[local church|independent congregations]] and some [[prison gang]]s.&lt;ref name="BehindBars"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/domestic-extremism-terrorism/c/bigotry-behind-bars-racist-groups-in-US-prisons.html|title= Bigotry Behind Bars: Racist Groups In U.S. Prisons|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150729081815/http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/domestic-extremism-terrorism/c/bigotry-behind-bars-racist-groups-in-US-prisons.html|archivedate= 2015-07-29|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its theology promotes a [[Racial discrimination|racial]] interpretation of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Eck|first= Diane|year= 2001|authorlink= Diana L.

Christian Identity holds that all non-whites (people not of wholly European descent) on the planet will either be exterminated or enslaved  in order to serve the [[White people|white race]] in the new [[Kingdom of God (Christianity)|Heavenly Kingdom]] on Earth under the reign of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} Its doctrine states that only "Adamic" (white people) can achieve salvation and paradise. Many adherents are [[Millennialism|Millennialist]].

==Origins==
The Christian Identity movement emerged in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s as an offshoot sect of [[British Israelism]].&lt;ref name="Doctrine"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Religion and the Racist Right: The Origins of the Christian Identity Movement'', Michael Barkun, 1997, Preface, xii, xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that "lower races" are mentioned in the [[Bible]] (in contrast to Aryans) was posited in the 1905 book ''Theozoology; or The Science of the Sodomite Apelings and the Divine Electron'' by [[Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels]], a [[Völkisch movement|volkisch]] writer seen by many historians as a major influence on [[Nazism]]. [[Adolf Hitler]], however, did not subscribe to the belief that the Israelites of the Bible were Aryans; in a speech he gave in [[Munich]] in 1920 titled "Why We Are Anti-Semites", he referred to and disparaged [[Abraham]] as racially Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carolynyeager.net/why-we-are-antisemites-text-adolf-hitlers-1920-speech-hofbr%C3%A4uhaus|title="Why We Are Antisemites" - Text of Adolf Hitler's 1920 speech at the Hofbräuhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to British Israelism===
While early British Israelites such as [[Edward Hine]] and [[John Wilson (historian)|John Wilson]] were [[Philo-Semitism|philo-semites]], Christian Identity emerged in sharp contrast as a strongly antisemitic theology.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun 2003, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) describes the emergence of Christian Identity from British Israelism as an 'ugly turn':
{{quote|Once on American shores, British-Israelism began to evolve. Originally, believers viewed contemporary Jews as descendants of those ancient Israelites who had never been "lost." They might be seen critically but, given their significant role in the British-Israel genealogical scheme, not usually with animosity. By the 1930s, however, in the U.S., a strain of antisemitism started to permeate the movement (though some maintained traditional beliefs—and a small number of traditionalists still exist in the U.S.)&lt;ref name="Doctrine"/&gt;}}

Another source describes the emergence of Christian Identity from British Israelism as a "remarkable transition", also noting that traditional British Israelites were advocates of [[philosemitism]] which paradoxically changed to [[antisemitism]] and racism under Christian Identity.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Identity: The Aryan American Bloodline Religion'' by Chester L. Quarles, 2004, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, British Israelism itself had several Jewish members, and it received support from [[rabbi]]s throughout the 19th century; within British politics it supported [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who was descended from [[Sephardi Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;Quarles, pp. 13–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Life From The Dead'', 1875, Vol. III, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Christian Identity, which emerged in the 1920s, began to turn antisemitic by teaching the belief that the Jews are not descended from the [[tribe of Judah]] (as British Israelites maintain), but are instead descended from [[Satan]] or Edomite-[[Khazars]].&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, pp. 62–97.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Israel form of the belief held no antisemitic views; its followers instead held the view that Jews made up a minority of the tribes of Israel (Judah and Benjamin), with the British and other related Northern European peoples making up the remainder.

===Early years===
Christian Identity can be traced back to 1886 with the publication of the book, ''Lost Israel Found in the Anglo-Saxon Race'', by E.P. Ingersoll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nordiskisrael.dk/artikler/ep_ingersol_lost_israel_found_in_the_anglo_saxon_race.html|title=Lost Israel Found In the Anglo-Saxon Race}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in the 1920s by the writings of [[Howard Rand]] (1889–1991).&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Race Over Grace: The Racialist Religion of the Christian Identity Movement'', Charles H. Roberts, 2003, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand was a Massachusetts lawyer who obtained a law degree at the University of Maine. He was raised as a British Israelite, and his father introduced him to [[J. H. Allen]]'s work ''Judah's Sceptre and Joseph's Birthright'' (1902)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reluctant-messenger.com/judahs_sceptre_101.htm|title=Judah's Sceptre and Joseph's Birthright}}&lt;/ref&gt; at an early age.&lt;ref&gt;''Race Over Grace: The Racialist Religion of the Christian Identity Movement'', Charles H. Roberts, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; While Rand's father was not an antisemite, nor was Rand in his early British Israelite years, Rand first added an antisemitic element to British Israelism in the 1920s. He claimed as early as 1924 that the Jews were not really descended from the [[tribe of Judah]], but were instead the descendants of [[Esau]] or [[Canaanites]].&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, pp. 45–54.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rand never claimed that modern Jews were descendants of Satan, or that they were in any way inferior; he just claimed that they were not the true lineal descendants of Judah.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, pp. 45–60.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason Rand is considered a 'transitional' figure from British Israelism to Christian Identity, but not its actual founder.&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Roberts, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand is known as the first person to coin the term 'Christian Identity'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phinehas Priesthood: Violent Vanguard of the Christian Identity Movement'', Danny W. Davis, 2010, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Rand had set up the [[Anglo-Saxon Federation of America]] in 1933 which promoted his view that Jews were not descended from Judah; this marked the first key transition from British Israelism to Christian Identity. Beginning in May 1937, there were key meetings of British Israelites in the United States who were attracted to Rand's theory that the Jews were not descended from Judah. This provided the catalyst for the eventual emergence of Christian Identity. By the late 1930s the group considered Jews to be the offspring of Satan and demonised them, as they did non-[[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] races.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Roberts, pp. 11–15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Dudley Pelley]], founder of the [[Clerical fascism|clerical fascist]] [[Silver Legion of America|Silver Shirts]] movement, also promoted an anti-semitic form of British Israelism in the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Lobb, David. 'Fascist Apocalypse: William Pelley and Millennial Extremism', Paper presented at the 4th Annual Conference of the Center for Millennial Studies, November 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Links between Christian Identity and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] also emerged in the late 1930s, although the KKK was past the peak of its early 20th century revival.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, pp. 60–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key developers===
[[Wesley A. Swift|Wesley Swift]] (1913–1970) is considered by the [[FBI]] to have been the most significant figure in the early years of the Christian Identity movement. Swift was born in [[New Jersey]], and eventually moved to [[Los Angeles]] in order to attend Bible college. It is claimed that he may have been a "[[Ku Klux Klan]] organizer and a Klan rifle-team instructor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuban-exile.com/doc_026-050/doc0046.html|title=Christian Defense League |author= D. Boylan |date= 2004 |version=Updated 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, he founded his own church in [[Lancaster, California]]. In the 1950s, he was [[Gerald L. K. Smith]]'s West Coast representative of the [[Christian Nationalist Crusade]]. In addition, he hosted a daily radio broadcast in California during the 1950s and 1960s, through which he was able to proclaim his ideology to a large audience. Due to Swift's efforts, the message of his church spread, leading to the creation of similar churches throughout the country.

In 1957, the name of his church was changed to The Church of Jesus Christ Christian, which is used today by [[Aryan Nations]] (AN) churches. One of Swift's associates was retired Col. [[William Potter Gale]] (1917–1988). According  to claims of unknown reliability, Gale had previously been an aide to General [[Douglas MacArthur]], and had coordinated guerrilla resistance in the [[Philippines]] during [[World War II]]. Gale became a leading figure in the [[Tax protester (United States)|anti-tax]] and [[paramilitary]] movements of the 1970s and 1980s, beginning with the [[California Rangers]] and the [[Posse Comitatus (U.S. movement)|Posse Comitatus]], and helping to found the [[militia movement]].

Numerous Christian Identity churches preach similar messages. Some espouse more violent rhetoric than others, but all believe [[Aryan race|Aryans]] to be [[God in Christianity|God]]'s [[chosen people|chosen race]]. Gale introduced future [[Aryan Nations]] founder [[Richard Girnt Butler]] to Swift. Until then, Butler had admired [[George Lincoln Rockwell]] and Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]], and had been relatively [[Secularity|secular]]. Swift quickly converted him to Christian Identity. When Swift died, Butler took over the Church, to the apparent dismay of both Gale and Swift's family. Neither Butler nor Gale rivaled Swift as a dynamic orator, and attendance dwindled under the new pastor. Butler eventually renamed the organisation "The Church of Jesus Christ Christian/Aryan Nations" and moved it to [[Hayden Lake, Idaho]].

Lesser figures participated as Christian Identity theology took shape in the 1940s and 1950s, such as [[San Jacinto Capt]], a [[Baptist]] minister and California [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansman]] (who claimed that he had introduced Wesley Swift to Christian Identity); and [[Bertrand Comparet]] (1901–1983), one-time [[San Diego]] Deputy City Attorney (and lawyer for [[Gerald L. K. Smith]]). But for the most part, today's Christian Identity groups seem to have been generated by Wesley Swift, through his lieutenants William Potter Gale and Richard Butler.

==Tenets==
Rather than being an organized religion, Christian Identity ("CI") is adhered to by individuals, [[local church|independent congregations]] and some prison gangs&lt;ref name="BehindBars"/&gt; with a [[white supremacist]] theology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eck|first=Diane|year=2001|authorlink=Diana L. Eck|title=A New Religious America: How a "Christian Country" Has Become the World's Most Religiously Diverse Nation|location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buck|first=Christopher|title=Religious Myths and Visions of America: How Minority Faiths Redefined America's World Role|year=2009|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-313-35959-0|pages=107, 108, 213}}&lt;/ref&gt; that promotes a [[racial]] interpretation of [[Christianity]]. Christian Identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors who considered Europeans to be the [[chosen people]] and [[Jews]] to be the cursed offspring of [[Cain and Abel|Cain]], the "serpent hybrid" (or [[Serpent seed]]) (a belief known as the two-seedline doctrine). An early Christian Identity teacher, [[Wesley A. Swift]] (1913–1970), formulated the doctrine that non-[[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] peoples have no [[Soul (spirit)|souls]] and therefore can never earn God's favor or be saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quarles|first=Chester L.|title=Christian Identity: The Aryan American Bloodline Religion|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=2004|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r5BzY2eeyngC&amp;pg=PA68|isbn=978-0-7864-1892-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mason|first=Carol|title=Killing for Life: The Apocalyptic Narrative of Pro-Life Politics|year=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8819-1|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theology was promoted by [[George Lincoln Rockwell]] (1918 – 1967), the founder of the [[American Nazi Party]].

No single document expresses the Christian Identity belief system; there is much disagreement over the doctrines being taught by those ascribing to CI beliefs, since there is no central organization or headquarters for the CI sect. However, all CI adherents believe that Adam and his offspring were exclusively White and that the other [[pre-Adamite]] races are separate species, which cannot be either equated with or derived from the Adamites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anglo-saxonisrael.com/content/beast-field|title=Anglo-Saxon Israel – Beast of the Field}}&lt;/ref&gt; CI adherents cite passages from the [[Old Testament]], including [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra+9%3A2&amp;version=KJV Ezra 9:2], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezra+9%3A12&amp;version=KJV 12] and [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=nehemiah+13%3A27&amp;version=KJV Nehemiah 13:27], which they claim contain injunctions by [[Yahweh]] against [[interracial marriage]]s. Christian Identity believers reject the doctrines of most contemporary Christian denominations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://study.faithweb.com/About/|title=What is Christian Identity?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they believe that the doctrine which advocates the view that God's promises to Israel (through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob) have been expanded to create a spiritual people of "Israel", i.e., the [[Christian Church]], is [[heretical|heresy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://israelite-identity-archive.blogspot.com/2014/12/could-you-be-israelite-and-not-know-it.html|title=Could You Be An Israelite And Not Know It?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian Identity movement first received widespread attention from the mainstream media in 1984, when the [[white nationalist]] organization known as [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]] embarked on a murderous crime spree before it was suppressed by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. [[Tax evasion|Tax resister]] and [[militia movement]] organizer [[Gordon Kahl]], whose death in a 1983 shootout with federal authorities helped inspire The Order, also had connections to the Christian Identity movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/Ext_US/SCM.asp|title=Sovereign Citizen Movement – Extremism in America|publisher=Adl.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050729014548/http://www.adl.org/learn/Ext_US/SCM.asp|archivedate=2005-07-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|work=The New York Times|first=Wayne|last=King|title=Books of The Times; A Farmer's Fatal Obsession With Jews and Taxes|date=August 21, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement returned to public attention in 1992 and 1993, in the wake of the deadly [[Ruby Ridge]] confrontation, when newspapers discovered that former [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Beret]] and [[right-wing]] separatist [[Randy Weaver]] had at least a loose association with Christian Identity believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/1993/10/01/ambush-at-ruby-ridge|work=Reason|date=October 1, 1993|author=Alan W. Bock|title=Ambush at Ruby Ridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These groups are estimated to have two thousand members in the United States&lt;ref name="Barkun 1996 x"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barkun|first=Michael|year=1996|title=Religion and the Racist Right: The Origins of the Christian Identity Movement|pages=x|chapter=preface|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=0-8078-4638-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an unknown number in Canada and the rest of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. Due to the promotion of Christian Identity doctrines through radio and later through the Internet, an additional fifty thousand unaffiliated individuals are thought to hold Christian Identity beliefs.&lt;ref name="Barkun 1996 x" /&gt; The primary spread of Christian Identity teachings is believed to be through white supremacist prison gangs.&lt;ref name=adl /&gt;

==Beliefs==
Christian Identity asserts that the white people of Europe or Caucasians in general are God's servant people, according to the promises that were given to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. It further asserts that the early European tribes were really the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of Israel and therefore the rightful heirs to God's promises, and God's chosen people. [[Colin Kidd]] wrote that in America, Christian Identity exploited "the puzzle of the Ten Lost Tribes to justify an openly anti-Semitic and virulently racist agenda."&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd, ''The Forging of Races: Race and Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World, 1600–2000'', 2006, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two House Theology===
Like British Israelites, Christian Identity (CI) adherents believe in [[Two House theology|Two House Theology]], which makes a distinction between the [[Tribe of Judah]] and the [[Ten Lost Tribes]].&lt;ref name="Charles H. Roberts, pp.40-60"&gt;Charles H. Roberts, pp.40–60&lt;/ref&gt; However the major difference between British Israelism and CI is that British Israelites have always maintained that Jews are descended from the tribe of Judah.&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, F. E, ''The Bible Distinction Between the House of Israel and the House of Judah'', Radio Address, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, while also maintaining a Two House distinction, Christian Identity proponents believe that the true lineal descendants of Judah are ''not'' contemporary Jews, but are instead White Europeans whose ancestors settled mainly in [[Scotland]], [[Germany]], and other European nations, alongside the [[House of Israel]]. In short, Christian Identity adherents believe that instead of modern-day Jews, the true descendents of the Houses of Israel and Judah are the modern-day Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Germanic, Nordic, and kindred peoples.&lt;ref name="Charles H. Roberts, pp.40-60" /&gt;&lt;ref name=archive1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/BasicIdentity1|title=Basic Christian Identity : Dr. Wesley A. Swift : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive|publisher=Archive.org|date=2001-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some CI scholars teach the belief that many contemporary Jews are the descendants of [[Cain and Abel|Cain]], citing [http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Gen&amp;c=3&amp;v=15&amp;t=KJV#15 Genesis 3:15], [http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Jhn&amp;c=8&amp;v=44&amp;t=KJV#44 John 8:44] and [http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=1Jo&amp;c=3&amp;t=KJV#12 1 John 3:12] in support of their position; they also teach that Cain was the spawn of [[Satan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://study.faithweb.com/study/Serpentseed.html|title=Jewish Rabbis recognize Serpent Seedline as well as Sumerians, Targums and Biblical Accounts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin beliefs===
Identity teaches that "Israel" was the name given to [[Jacob]] after he [[Jacob wrestling with the angel|wrestled with the angel]] at Peniel as described in Genesis 32:26–32. "Israel" then had twelve sons, which began the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]].&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|101}} In 975 BC the ten northern tribes revolted, seceded from the south, and became the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]].&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|101}} After they were subsequently conquered by [[Assyria]] at approximately 721 BC, the ten tribes disappeared from the Biblical record and became known as the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]].&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|101}}

According to Identity doctrine, [http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=2+esdras+13:39-13:46&amp;version=nrsvae 2 Esdras 13:39–46] then records the history of the nation of Israel journeying over the [[Caucasus mountains]], along the [[Black Sea]], to the [[Siret River|Ar Sereth]] tributary of the [[Danube]] in [[Romania]] ("But they formed this plan for themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the nations and go to a more distant region, where no human beings had ever lived. … Through that region there was a long way to go, a journey of a year and a half; and that country is called Arzareth").&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|101}} The tribes prospered, and eventually colonised other European countries. Israel's leading tribe, the [[Tribe of Dan]], is attributed with settling and naming many areas which are today distinguished by place names derived from its name – written ancient Hebrew contains no vowels, and hence "Dan" would be written as DN, but would be pronounced with an intermediate vowel dependent on the local dialect, meaning that ''Dan'', ''Den'', ''Din'', ''Don'', and ''Dun'' all have the same meaning.&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|101}} Various modern place names are said to derive from the name of this tribe:&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|101}}
* [[Macedonia (terminology)|Macedonia]] – Mace''don''ia – derived from Moeshe-don-ia (Moeshe being "the land of Moses")
* [[Danube]] – ''Dan''-ube, [[Dneister]] – ''Dn''-eister, [[Dneiper]] – ''Dn''-eiper, [[Donetz]] – ''Don''-etz, [[Danzig]] – ''Dan''-zig, [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] – ''Don''

Some followers claim that the Identity genealogy of the [[Davidic line]] can be traced to the royal rulers of Britain and [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] herself.&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|102–105}} Thus [[Anglo-Saxons]] are the true [[Israelites]], God's chosen people who were given the divine right to rule the world until the [[Second Coming of Christ]].&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|101}}

===Adamites and pre-Adamites===
A major tenet of Christian Identity is the [[pre-Adamite]] hypothesis. Christian Identity followers believe that [[Adam and Eve]] are only the ancestors of [[white people]], and that Adam and Eve were preceded by [[Untermensch|lesser]], non-Caucasian races which are often (although not always) identified as "beasts of the field";&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref|Genesis|1:25|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the "beasts" which wore sackcloth and cried unto God ({{bibleref|Jonah|3:8|ESV}}) are identified as [[Black people|black races]] by Christian Identity adherents.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} To support their theory on the racial identity of Adam, Christian Identity proponents point out that the Hebrew etymology of the word 'Adam' translates as 'be ruddy, red, to show blood (in the face)' often quoting from [[James Strong (theologian)|James Strong]]'s ''Hebrew Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;Hebrew Dictionary #119 (1890)&lt;/ref&gt; and from this they conclude that only Caucasians or people with light white skin can blush or turn rosy in the face (because [[hemoglobin]] is only visible under pale skin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxonisrael.com/docBibStudies/KingdomBasics.html|title=Basics for Understanding Yahweh's Kingdom|publisher=Anglo-Saxon Israel|date=2009-06-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723113840/http://www.anglo-saxonisrael.com/docBibStudies/KingdomBasics.html|archivedate=2011-07-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of Christian Identity believe that Adam was only created six thousand years ago, while the other, non-Caucasian races were created during far older epochs that occurred on the other continents.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2016}}

===Serpent seed===
{{see also|Serpent seed}}
Dual Seedline Christian Identity proponents— those who believe that [[Serpent seed|Eve bore children with Satan]] as well as with Adam —believe that Eve was seduced by [[Serpents in the Bible|the Serpent]] ([[Satan]]), shared her fallen state with Adam by lying down with him, and gave birth to [[Superfecundation|twins with different fathers]]: Satan's son [[Cain and Abel|Cain]] and Adam's son [[Cain and Abel|Abel]]. This belief is referred to as the [[serpent seed]] doctrine. According to the "dual seedline" form of Christian Identity, Cain then became the progenitor of the Jews in his subsequent matings with members of the non-Adamic races.

The serpent seed idea, which ascribes the ancestry of legendary monsters such as [[Grendel]] to Cain,&lt;ref name=archive1 /&gt; was somewhat widespread in the [[Middle Ages]]. It also appears in early [[Gnostic Gospels|Gnostic Christian texts]] as well as in some Jewish texts, for example a 9th-century book titled ''[[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]]''.&lt;ref name="Eichhorn, D. 1985"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0-940646-19-6|title=Cain: Son of the Serpent|authorlink=Eichhorn, D.|year=1985|publisher=Rossel Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Cain: Son of the Serpent'', [[David Max Eichhorn]], traces the idea back to early Jewish [[Midrash|Midrashic texts]] and he identifies many rabbis who taught the belief that Cain was the son of a union between the Serpent and Eve.&lt;ref name="Eichhorn, D. 1985" /&gt;

Some [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]] rabbis also believe that Cain and Abel were of a different genetic background than [[Seth]]. This teaching is based on the theory that God created two "Adams" (''adam'' means "man" in [[Hebrew]]). To one he gave a soul and to the other he did not give a soul. The one without a soul is the creature known in Christianity as the Serpent. The Kabbalists call the serpent the ''Nahash'' (which means the ''serpent'' in Hebrew).

This is recorded in the [[Zohar]]:

{{quote|Two beings [Adam and Nachash] had intercourse with Eve, and she conceived from both and bore two children. Each followed one of the male parents, and their spirits parted, one to this side and one to the other, and similarly their characters. On the side of Cain are all the haunts of the evil species; from the side of Abel comes a more merciful class, yet not wholly beneficial – good wine mixed with bad.| Zohar 136}}

A seminal influence on the Christian Identity movement's views on pre-Adamism was a book published in 1900 by [[Charles Carroll (author)|Charles Carroll]] titled ''The Negro a Beast or In the Image of God?''. In the book Carroll concluded that Adam only gave birth to the White race and the White race was made in the image and likeness of God, while [[African peoples|Negroes]] are pre-Adamite beasts who could not possibly have been made in God's image and likeness because they are beast-like, [[Immorality|immoral]] and [[Beauty#Ugliness|ugly]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Carroll The Negro a beast"; or, "In the image of God"; the reasoner of the age, the revelator of the century! The Bible as it is! The Negro and his relation to the human family! The Negro not the son of Ham, 1900&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll claimed that the pre-Adamite races such as blacks did not have souls. Carroll believed that [[Miscegenation|race mixing]] was an insult to God because it spoiled His racial plan of creation. According to Carroll, the mixing of races had also led to the errors of [[Atheism]] and [[evolutionary biology|evolutionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd, ''The Forging of Races: Race and Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World, 1600–2000'', p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creationism===
Christian Identity proponents believe that both the universe and Earth are billions of years old and that non-Caucasian races were created hundreds of thousands or even millions of years ago. However, they believe that [[Adam]] (who was the father of the white race or [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]]) was only created around 6,000 years ago.

[[Wesley Swift]] strongly criticised [[Young Earth Creationism]] and the traditional Judeo-Christian view that [[Biblical flood|Noah's flood]] was global. He instead believed that the flood was only local and that the Earth was billions of years old.&lt;ref name=archive1 /&gt; Christian Identity adherents claim that the flood in Genesis only rose high enough to drown the region of the [[Tarim Basin]] below sea level (Gen. 7:20) and that therefore the Hebrew word "eretz" which appears in those verses should be rendered "the land" (as in a specific place) rather than "the earth."{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Racialism===
{{see also|Curse of Ham}}
[[Racialism]], or race-based philosophy, is the core tenet of Christian Identity, and most CI adherents are [[white nationalists]] who support [[racial segregation]]. Some CI adherents believe that Jews are genetically compelled by their Satanic or Edomite ancestry to carry on a conspiracy against the Adamic seedline and that Jews have today achieved almost complete control of the Earth through their claim to the white race's status as God's [[chosen people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchoftrueisrael.com/comparet/who-are-jews.html|title=Who are the Jews? By: Bertrand Comparet|publisher=Church of True Israel|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225125047/http://www.churchoftrueisrael.com/comparet/who-are-jews.html|archivedate=2007-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a general rule, Christian Identity followers adhere to the traditional Christian views on the role of women (See [[Biblical patriarchy]]), [[abortion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:22|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[homosexuality]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they believe that racial [[miscegenation]] is a sin and a violation of God's law in Genesis 1:24–25 which commands that all creatures should produce "kind after kind."

In addition to their strict fundamentalist racial views Christian Identity adherents distinguish themselves from mainstream [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christian fundamentalism|Fundamentalism]] in various areas of theology. Some Christian Identity adherents follow the [[Law of Moses|Mosaic law]] of the [[Old Testament]] (e.g., [[Kashrut|dietary restrictions]], the [[seventh-day Sabbath]] and certain annual festivals such as [[Passover]]). It is also commonplace for some Christian Identity adherents to follow the [[Sacred Name Movement]] and they insist on using the original Hebrew names when referring to [[God in Christianity|God]] ([[Yahweh]]) and [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]] ([[Yeshua|Yahshua]]). Some Christian Identity writers criticize modern Bible editions as well as the Jews for their removal of the original Hebrew name of God from the Bible. Although their adherence to Old Testament Mosaic law may make them appear "Jewish"; they claim that the Jewish interpretation of the law has been corrupted through the Jews' [[Talmud]]. Unlike many Protestant Fundamentalists, Christian Identity adherents reject the notion of a [[Rapture]], believing it to be a Judaized doctrine which the Bible does not teach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchoftrueisrael.com/comparet/compthief.html|title=I Come as a Thief|publisher=Church of True Israel|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821152305/http://www.churchoftrueisrael.com/comparet/compthief.html|archivedate=2007-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial politics and economics===
Christian Identity politics was first reviewed by [[Howard Rand]] and [[William J. Cameron]] after the [[Great Depression]]. In 1943, Rand published the article "Digest of the Divine Law" which discussed the political and economic challenges at that time. An excerpt from the article states: "We shall not be able to continue in accord with the old order. Certain groups are already planning an economy of regimentation for our nation; but it will only intensify the suffering and want of the past and bring to our peoples all the evils that will result from such planning by a group of men who are failing to take into consideration the fundamental principles underlying the law of the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barkun|first1=Michael|title=Religion and the Racist Right: The Origins of the Christian Identity Movement|date=1997|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=0-8078-2328-7|page=202|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Rand never formally admitted to what groups he was specifically referring, his hatred for Jews, [[racial integration]], and the country's economic state at the time made the direction of his comments obvious. Identifying specific economic problems was not the only goal which Rand had in mind. He began to analyze how to make these changes happen through legal changes; thus creating strategic plans to integrate the Bible into American law and economics. The first goal was to denounce all man-made laws and to replace them with laws from the Bible. The second goal was to create an economic state that would reflect teachings from the bible.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Howard Rand and William Cameron believed in these principles and this was because according to Christian Identity's teachings, they possessed access to knowledge about God's law that no one else does. Since they had access to more information, they were responsible for influencing current civil law in order to maintain God's standards.

While William Cameron agreed with Rand's initial argument, he focused his writings more specifically on changing American economics. One of Cameron's articles "The Economic Law of God" spoke of the Bible supporting individualism and social justice in regards to economics. He also believed that the government had no right to tax land, or other forms of property. In accordance with this doctrine, tax refunds should be applied to family vacation trips or be applied to national festivals for Christian Identity movements.&lt;ref name="University of North Carolina Press"&gt;Barkun. {{page needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also for the betterment of the United States' economic future, no interest should be applied to accounts paid with credit, and no taxes should be imputed during the traveling time of goods from a manufacturer to the consumer.&lt;ref name="University of North Carolina Press" /&gt;

The mutual point which both Rand and Cameron shared, was that while they may have disagreed with how the government was operating, neither men resisted the current tax policies. [[Gordon Kahl]] was the first CI believer who took the founding principles from Rand and Cameron, and applied them in order to take action against the government.&lt;ref name="University of North Carolina Press" /&gt; Kahl believed that the men were on the right track in regards to what needed to be accomplished in order to change public policies, however he felt that without taking action against violators, no real changes would be made. In 1967 he stopped paying taxes because he felt he was paying "tithes to the Synagogue of Satan." Years later, Gordon Kahl, the CI farmer from [[North Dakota]], took it upon himself to kill two federal marshals in 1983. Before he was caught for the murders, Kahl wrote a note in which he said "our nation has fallen into the hands of alien people. … These enemies of Christ have taken their Jewish Communist Manifesto and incorporated it into the Statutory Laws of our country and thrown our Constitution and our Christian Common Law into the garbage can."&lt;ref name="University of North Carolina Press" /&gt;

===World's end and Armageddon===
Christian Identity supporters believe in the [[Second Coming]] and [[Armageddon]]. Predictions vary, including a [[race war]] or a Jewish-backed [[United Nations]] takeover of the US, and they endorse physical struggle against what they see as the forces of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Jeffrey|title=Millennial Violence: Past, Present, and Future|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7146-5294-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qb92tBxVOZgC&amp;pg=PA37|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miscegenation, homosexuality, and anti-Semitism===
Identity asserts that [[disease]], [[addiction]], [[cancer]], and [[sexually transmitted infection]]s ([[herpes]] and [[HIV/AIDS]]) are spread by human "rodents" via contact with "unclean" persons, such as "[[Miscegenation|race-mixers]]".&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|85}} The [[apocrypha]], [[Book of Enoch|the first book of Enoch]], is used to justify these social theories; the fallen angels of Heaven sexually desired Earth maidens and took them as wives, resulting in the birth of [[Abomination (Bible)|abominations]], which God ordered [[Michael the Archangel]] to destroy, thus beginning a cosmic war between Light and Darkness.&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|85}} The mixing of separate things (e.g., people of different races) is seen as defiling both, and it is also considered a violation of God's law.&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|86}}

Identity preachers proclaim that, according to the Bible, "the penalties for race-mixing, homo-sexuality, and usury are death."&lt;ref name=aho&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of Righteousness: Idaho Christian Patriotism|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1995|page=86|author=James Alfred Aho|isbn=0-295-97494-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|86}} The justification for killing homosexuals is provided in Leviticus 20:13 "If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them." Exodus 22:25, Leviticus 25:35–37 and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] explicitly condemn [[usury]].&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|92}}  Ezekiel 18:13 states "He who hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? He shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him" and is quoted as justification for killing Jews.

Identity followers reject the label "antisemitic", stating that they cannot be antisemitic, since the true [[Semitic people|Semites]] "today are the great White Christian nations of the western world", with modern Jews in fact being descendants of the [[Canaan#Biblical Canaanites|Canaanites]].&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;

===Anti-banking system===
Identity doctrine asserts that the "root of all evil" is paper money (in particular [[Federal Reserve Note]]s), and that usury and banking systems are controlled by Jews.&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|87}} The creation of the [[Federal Reserve System]] in 1913 shifted control of money from Congress to private institutions and violated the Constitution. The money system encourages the [[Federal Reserve]] to take out loans, creating trillions of dollars of government debt and allowing international bankers to control America. Credit/debit cards and computerised bills are seen as the fulfillment of the Biblical scripture warning against "the beast" (i.e., banking) as quoted in Revelation 13:15–18. Identity preacher Sheldon Emry claims "Most of the owners of the largest banks in America are of Eastern European (Jewish) ancestry and connected with the (Jewish) [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons|Rothschild European banks]]", thus, in Identity doctrine, the global banking conspiracy is led and controlled by Jewish interests.&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|91}}

==Groups==
Christian Identity is a major unifying [[theology]] for a number of diverse groups of [[white nationalist]] Christians. It is a belief system that provides its members with a religious basis for racial separatism. [[Herbert W. Armstrong]] is inaccurately described by some of his critics, as well as by supporters of Christian Identity, as having supported Christian Identity, due to his belief in a modified form of British Israelism, and the fact that during his lifetime, he propounded observances favoured by many Christian Identity groups, such as [[seventh-day Sabbatarianism]] and biblical festivals. The [[Worldwide Church of God]] which Armstrong founded did not subscribe to the anti-Semitism commonly espoused by the Christian or Israel Identity groups but instead adhered to the traditional beliefs of British Israelism; i.e., the belief that modern day Jews are descendants of the [[Tribe of Judah]] whereas the [[Anglo-Saxons]], [[Celts]], [[Danes]], etc. are descendants of the remaining Ten Tribes of Israel formerly known as the Northern Kingdom.

Christian Identity groups include "[[The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord]]", the [[Phineas Priesthood]], the Oklahoma Constitutional Militia, also known as The Universal Church of God. Christian Identity is also adhered to by other groups such as [[Aryan Nations]], the [[Aryan Republican Army]] (ARA) and the [[Patriots Council]], [[Church of Jesus Christ Christian]], [[Thomas Robb]], [[LaPorte Church of Christ]], Mission To Israel, Folk And Faith, Jubilee, Traditionalist Youth Network, Yahweh's Truth ([[James Wickstrom]]), Church of Israel&lt;ref name=adl&gt;{{cite web|title=Extremism in America: Dan Gayman|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/gayman.asp?xpicked=2&amp;item=gayman|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|year=2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929194615/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/gayman.asp?xpicked=2&amp;item=gayman|archivedate=2012-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaymangate.com/JoplinGlobe1-28-2001-1.pdf|title=Separatist by faith: Church of Israel's patriarch rebuts claims of racism|author=Max McCoy|publisher=''Joplin Globe''|date=28 January 2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222054659/http://www.gaymangate.com/JoplinGlobe1-28-2001-1.pdf|archivedate=22 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Shepherd's Chapel]] and [[Kingdom Identity Ministries]].

[[South Africa]]n branches of Christian Identity have been accused of involvement in terrorist activities, including the [[2002 Soweto bombings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title='Volk' Faith and Fatherland: The Security Threat Posed by the White Right|author=Martin Schönteich and Henri Boshoff|isbn=1-919913-30-0|publisher=Pretoria, South Africa, Institute for Security Studies|year=2003|url=http://www.iss.co.za/Pubs/Monographs/No81/Chap4.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060411190412/http://www.iss.co.za/Pubs/Monographs/No81/Chap4.html|archivedate=2006-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Christian Identity groups include the Heritage Christian Church and the Legion for the Survival of Freedom.

A '''church fan''' is term used mainly in the [[United States]] for a [[hand fan]] used within a [[Christian church]] building to cool oneself off. The fan typically has a wooden handle and a fan blade made of hard stock paper (i.e. card-stock, 2-ply), often with a staple adjoining the two materials.

== History ==
Modern air-conditioning became widely available in America during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/a7951/a-brief-history-of-air-conditioning-10720229/|title=A Brief History of Air Conditioning|date=2015-01-01|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many churches (primarily African-American congregations) were unable to afford the cooling machines for their [[church (building)|church buildings]]. In addition to their function of cooling the body, the paper blade of the fans were used for printed illustrations and community advertisements. Historically, funeral homes often acquired the space on the back of the fans to advertise their services to the churches members, in addition to other local businesses and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.starnewsonline.com/news/20100306/collection-of-church-fans-represents-southern-hospitality|title=Collection of church fans represents Southern hospitality|last=Greene|first=Amanda|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrations on the front blade of the fans are varied in subject matter; from illustrations of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], to notable people within the respective churches community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://myauctionfinds.com/2014/07/23/a-time-when-hand-fans-cooled-church-goers/|title=A time when hand fans cooled church-goers {{!}} Auction Finds|website=myauctionfinds.com|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary Use ==
With the spread of modern air-conditioning units within church buildings, church fans have become less popular. However, many churches still supply hand fans for their members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23488">The '''Conservation of South Asian household shrines''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation of [[Shrine|household shrines]] from [[South Asia]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]], held by either museums or private collectors, this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]]. South Asian shrines held in museum collections around the world are principally shrines relate to [[Hinduism|Hindu,]] [[Jainism|Jain,]] or [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] households. Due to their original use and sacred nature, these shrines present unique [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation and restoration]] challenges for those tasked with their care.

==Household shrines==
===Usage===
[[File:Svu kerala.jpg|thumb|A modern Srividya adept performs Tantric puja at his home shrine. Kerala, India, 2006.]]
In all three of these religions, daily ritual devotion is a central aspect.&lt;ref name="BCentre"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Buddhism?|url=https://thebuddhistcentre.com/buddhism|website=The Buddhist Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AsianArt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Worship of the Goddess in South Asia|url=http://education.asianart.org/explore-resources/background-information/worship-goddess-south-asia|website=Asian Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shrines facilitate this practice by offering a sacred space within the home, serving as a focal point for [[meditation]] and [[Offering (Buddhism)|offerings]] to the gods and [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]] ones. Daily rituals at household shrines can take many forms, but often feature some of the following practices: meditation and/or [[prayer]],&lt;ref name="BCentre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AsianArt" /&gt; ritual bathing of sculptures in water, anointing with oils,&lt;ref name="AsianArt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Samuel K.|title=Renovation, Disposal, and Conservation of  Hindu Temples and Images:  The Institutionalization of Creativity in South Indian and American Art Worlds|journal=Museum Anthropology Review|date=Fall 2009|volume=3|issue=2|pages=107–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; lighting of candles or burning of [[incense]],&lt;ref name="BCentre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JainCenter"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Traditions|url=http://www.nyjaincenter.org/Traditions|website=Jain Center of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offering of flowers and/or food. Devotional practices vary not only from religion to religion, but also from person to person. The above list contains common actions, but the form of daily ritual is set by the individual. 
===Appearance and materials===
Shrines for household use vary in size, from simple tabletop setups with room for a sculpture and a few offerings&lt;ref name="AsianArt" /&gt; to full shrines taking up entire walls.&lt;ref name="Philly"&gt;{{cite web|title=Conserving a Tibetan Altar|url=https://www.philamuseum.org/exhibitions/243.html|website=Philadelphia Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devotional items and smaller shrines are typically purchased ready-made, though wealthier households often commissioned elaborate custom shrines.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Jain Shrine from India|url=https://nelson-atkins.org/events/a-jain-shrine-from-india/|website=Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though primarily made of wood and paint, household shrines sometimes feature extra adornment such as [[gold leaf]]&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WRV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Butsudan|url=http://www.wrvmuseum.org/journal/journal_ftbr_0799.htm|website=White River Journal: A Newsletter of the White River Valley Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; or leather fittings.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; In far Eastern countries, like [[China]] and [[Japan]], such shrines are often [[lacquer]]ed.&lt;ref name="WRV" /&gt;

==Damage and deterioration==
Household shrines can suffer damage from two overall sources: the materials used are at risk of deterioration particular to their nature, and the ways the shrines are used can cause specific types of wear and tear.

===Humidity=== 
As discussed, the majority of household shrines are made of painted wood, and both wood and paint are susceptible to the effects of humidity.&lt;ref name="NPS"&gt;{{cite book|title=NPS Museum Handbook: Appendix N, Curatorial Care of Wooden Objects|date=2002|publisher=National Park Service|pages=N1-N28|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/Appendix%20N.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Winterthur"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collections|date=2009|publisher=The Henry Francis du Pont Winterthur Museum, Inc.|location=Delaware|isbn=0-912724-52-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the [[relative humidity]] of the wood’s environment can cause it to swell (in increased humidity) or shrink (in decreased humidity). Extreme or prolonged swelling can result in [[Wood warping|warping]], while excess shrinkage can lead to cracks, particularly around nail or screw holes.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; In addition to damaging the wood, fluctuations in humidity can also deteriorate paint and other surface decoration: changes in humidity can result in loosening, flaking, and cracking paint.&lt;ref name="Getty"&gt;{{cite book|title=Painted Wood: History and Conservation; Part Four: Investigations and Treatment|date=1998|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute Publications|pages=278–397|url=https://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/paintedwood4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold leaf can dissolve in water, especially if applied with a water-soluble adhesive.&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt; Lacquer, a layer of shellac creating a clear, hardened surface, can delaminate from the underlying paint and wood layers if changes in humidity cause the wood to flex too much.&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt;

===Pests===
[[Pest (organism)|Pests]] can be attracted to the wood itself, or, in the case of shrines, to the offerings that are left on it. [[Insects]] feed on wood or burrow into it to build nests, weakening the structure and causing unsightly holes.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; The types of insects vary by region, but can include species of ants, bees, or termites.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; [[Fungi]] also feed on wood, albeit on a smaller scale, and depending on the type can cause everything from discoloration to disintegration.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt;

A family shrine is in less danger of [[rat]]s than the presence of food would lead one to believe, as the offerings are replaced on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; However, rats are attracted to food, and will gnaw through wood to get it,&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; leaving holes.

===Light===
Direct sunlight or artificial light, both present in a home environment, can bleach wood and paint colors and, over a long period of time, weaken or deteriorate the wood’s cellular structure.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt;

===Pollutants===
Humans are, unfortunately, a source of [[pollutant]]s that can damage a family shrine. Touching the surface can leave behind oils, salts, and acids present in skin, which over time can build up on the shrine and cause staining and surface erosion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} [[Dirt]] and [[dust]], if not frequently removed, can scratch and erode the wood.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Ancient shrines have been found buried and accumulated significant damage from being encased in the soil.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; The most common pollutant for home shrines, particular in Buddhist households, is [[smoke]]: burning incense or candles is a standard component of daily prayer, and the smoke blackens the shrine over time.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; Superficial burns to the wood, though unlikely, are also possible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Preventative conservation==
Protecting household shrines from further deterioration requires considering each of the agents of decay in terms of the activities of storage, handling, and display.

===Storage===
The ideal relative humidity for wooden objects is 50%; museums aim to keep the environment’s relative humidity within a few percentage points of this target; typically with no more than 10% fluctuation within a 24 hour period.&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt; A stable [[Temperature|temperature]] is also considered preferable, as any fluctuations directly affects relative humidity.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Conservators use an [[Museum integrated pest management|Integrated Pest Management]] policy to reduce the threats of pests and vermin to collections, pest eradication processes are carefully selected to take into account the sacred nature of the shrines. For some religious groups, certain pest control methods such as freezing and anoxia are considered just as deadly to the sacred nature of the object as to pests;&lt;ref name="Paine"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paine|first1=Crispin|title=Religious Objects in Museums: Private Lives and Public Duties|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Caring for sacred and culturally sensitive objects|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/care-objects/indigenous-materials/caring-sacred-culturally-sensitive-objects.html|website=Government of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, they should not be undertaken if the appropriate religious community forbids them. Lights should only be used when needed, and should be kept as dim as possible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Frequent careful cleanings, combined with dust covers, will reduce the danger of pollutants.&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt; Cleaning should be done with a soft cotton cloth or cosmetic brush, and a mild [[detergent]] and water if necessary.&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt;

===Handling===
Best practice in museum handling of collection objects, such as shrines, dictates that objects be moved as little as possible. Shrines are frequently large, with intricate carvings, and there is significant risk of breakage through moving them.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt;  When handling or moving is necessary, it is done with careful planning - gloves, typically [[nitrile]] or cotton, are worn to prevent transferring pollutants on the hands to the shrine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Display===
Lighting presents an additional challenge, since the object must be visible to viewers. Lights are kept as low as possible while still being bright enough to allow visitors to navigate the room and see the shrine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Sometimes lights will only be turned on when the shrine display is open to the public.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} [[UV filter]]s are typically installed on artificial lights and window glass to prevent UV light from sun causing damage.

==Treatment==
===Research===
Due to the religious nature of household shrines, in addition to determining the extent of the damage, [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation]] professionals advocate researching the spiritual nature of the shrine before restoration work begins. A recommended starting point is to ask why something is being conserved.&lt;ref name="WAAC"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Conservator's Approach to Sacred Art|journal=WAAC Newsletter|date=September 1995|volume=17|issue=3|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn17/wn17-3/wn17-310.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple approaches to conservation and restoration, and this initial question is a preferred guideline for deciding which approach to take. There are two possible approaches to restoration of household religious objects: materials-based and values-based.&lt;ref name="Jakobi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuh Jakobi|first1=Davina|title=Choices and Decision-making in Conservation: The Implications of Conserving Religious Icons|journal=Tropos|date=2014|volume=1|issue=1|pages=14–25|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1420196/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Materials-based restoration refers simply to fixing what is broken: the materials are damaged, so they will be fixed.&lt;ref name="Jakobi" /&gt; Values-based restoration is concerned with preserving the “intangible” qualities of an object—in this case, its religious properties.&lt;ref name="Jakobi" /&gt; This approach involves not removing evidence of use on the object as long as it is not contributing to its deterioration.&lt;ref name="Jakobi" /&gt; Values-based is the approach most often argued for, but it is noted that a combination of the two types is frequently the most appropriate.&lt;ref name="Jakobi" /&gt;

===Wood restoration===
Wood restoration can be an invasive process: to repair warping, for example, shallow cuts are often made in the surface of the wood to allow it to be pulled back into its original position and secured in place.&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt; Cracks can be filled with adhesive to both disguise them and prevent them from expanding,&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt; while holes or missing pieces are typically patched with [[replica]] parts.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Wood that has been bleached may be [[Wood stain|re-stained]] or inpainted to match the undamaged areas.&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt;

===Paint restoration===
Loosened or flaking paint can be consolidated by injecting it with adhesive.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; Scratches can be [[Inpainting|inpainted]],&lt;ref name="MFA"&gt;{{cite book|title=Conservation and Care of Museum Collections|date=2011|publisher=MFA Publications|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-87846-729-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or repainted to reduce their appearance. Painted surfaces may be carefully cleaned with [[solvent]]s to ensure that only the grime is removed and not the paint layer underneath.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt; Lacquer that has delaminated from the paint layer may be glued back into place.&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt;

==Ethics==
===Conflicting ideals===
Conservation and museum display of religious objects, like household shrines, represents two [[Ideology|ideologies]] in conflict. [[Museum]]s are secular spaces, and restoration is secular work, but family shrines are sacred.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Imogen|title=Exhibiting the Exotic, Simulating the Sacred: Tibetan Shrines at British and American Museums|journal=Ateliers d'Anthropologie|date=2016|volume=43|url=http://journals.openedition.org/ateliers/10300#text}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[education]] and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]]-focused missions of museums and conservators are inherently at odds with the religious, family, and social functions of household altars.&lt;ref name="Grimes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=Ronald|title=Sacred objects in museum spaces|journal=Studies in Religion|date=December 1, 1992|volume=21|issue=4|pages=419–460|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/000842989202100404?journalCode=sira}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restoring a shrine for museum display and putting it on [[Exhibition|exhibit]] affects its function: it becomes art to those outside its subject religion,&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; but to adherents it can retain its status as an object of veneration even after being removed from its original context.&lt;ref name="Caple"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caple|first1=Chris|title=Conservation Skills: Judgement, Method and Decision Making|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-18880-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In addition to these differing principles that affect how a shrine is perceived, religious communities may have restrictions on what actions are appropriate for storage, restoration, and exhibition.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caple" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadongei"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadongei|first1=Alyce|title=What about Sacred Objects?|journal=WAAC Newsletter|date=May 2006|volume=28|issue=2|pages=14–15|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn28/wn28-2/wn28-205.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Buddhist writings and inscriptions show evidence of ongoing upkeep on ancient shrines and [[temple]]s, indicating a prescription within the faith to maintain holy objects.&lt;ref name="ICCROM"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Conservation of Living Religious Heritage|journal=ICCROM Conservation Studies|date=2003|url=https://www.iccrom.org/sites/default/files/ICCROM_ICS03_ReligiousHeritage_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Jainic texts indicate that building a new shrine gives karmic reward, but a larger karmic reward is given for restoring an old shrine.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; Hinduism, by contrast, commands that shrines and statues be worthy receptacles for the gods: if they become damaged, some Hindu groups believe, they should be ritually destroyed and replaced.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; Buddhism, Jainism, and Hinduism not only vary from each other in their approaches to restoration, but groups and individuals within the religions may differ as well. As such, ethical standards state that the conservation methods undertaken for one object should not be applied to another, however similar, without consultation with the source religious community.&lt;ref name="Sadongei" /&gt;

===Consultation and care===
====Traditional care====
Multiple conservation organizations, including the [[Western Association for Art Conservation]] (WAAC) and the International Centre for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments (ICCROM), state that a goal of conservation is to preserve the intangible qualities of an object as well as the tangible, physical qualities.&lt;ref name="WAAC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICCROM" /&gt; To fully understand these intangible qualities, consultation with members of the religious community is necessary.

In addition to the preventative conservation methods described earlier, consultation with religious communities may disclose traditional or ritual care practices that the subject religion requires for sacred objects.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadongei" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; These measure could include directives on how objects can be stored, who can handle them, and what—if any—restorative measures can be taken.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadongei" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; Ritual care has the potential to prescribe religious practices to museum staff members who are not adherents of the subject religion; to avoid this, a recommended practice is active practice and passive accommodation: active practice refers to actions and behaviors with the object that can only be undertaken by a knowledgeable practitioner, while passive accommodation refers to the museum staff allowing the practitioner to conduct the practice within the museum space.&lt;ref name="Sadongei" /&gt; Conservators and other museum professionals should be prepared to conduct restoration best practices within the confines of what the religious representatives allow.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WAAC" /&gt;

====Varying approaches====
Museum and conservation professionals take several different stances on how best to approach the care of religious objects. [[The Victoria and Albert Museum]] in the United Kingdom, for example, provides all of its staff conservators with an Ethics Checklist that, among other measures, prescribes consultation with a number of interested parties before conservation begins, and asks conservators to consider how their actions will affect the “identity and significance of the object(s)”.&lt;ref name="V&amp;A"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Appendix 1: Victoria &amp; Albert Museum Conservation Department Ethics Checklist|journal=Conservation Journal|date=Summer 2005|issue=50|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-50/appendix-1/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Government of Canada]] promotes an imperative of “respectful care”, wherein conservators fit their best practices into standards of care required by cultural representatives.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt; ICCROM takes an even more culturally-centered approach, stating that the entire conservation process, including the decision to conserve, should originate with and be directed by the source religious community.&lt;ref name="ICCROM" /&gt; Others suggest that consultation can go both ways, with religious representatives educating conservationists on proper care of the shrines, while conservationists can education the faithful on what their work entails to ensure that no boundaries are overstepped.&lt;ref name="Cotte"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cotte|first1=Sabine|title=Reflections Around the Conservation of Sacred Thangkas|journal=Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies|date=2013|volume=11|issue=1|url=https://www.jcms-journal.com/articles/10.5334/jcms.1021207/}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an exhibition standpoint, some recommend advocating for the religious aspects of these objects by creating more immersive museum displays that promote and explain the devotional qualities of the shrines instead of reducing them to aesthetics.&lt;ref name="Grimes" /&gt; The WAAC, for its part, advocates presenting the source community with all possible options regarding care and treatment of the object in question and letting the final decision rest with the community.&lt;ref name="WAAC" /&gt; As this illustrates, although the bulk of museum and conservation organizations recommend consultation with religious representatives, as yet there is no complete consensus on the best ways to ethically care for and restore religious objects.

==Case studies==
===Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art===
The [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]] spent more than a year restoring a Jain household shrine that had been in storage for over 70 years.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; Analysis of the shrine revealed two paint layers underneath the surface dirt: the original layer from the 16th century, and a later coating from the 1800s.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; The decision was made by the conservators to remove only the surface grime and not attempt to remove the later paint layer: Jainism gives greater spiritual reward for restoring an old shrine than building a new one, so the conservators opted not to undo the spiritual work of the individual(s) who did the 1800s repainting.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; The shrine has been on display in the Nelson-Atkins Asian Art gallery since 2014.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;

===Philadelphia Museum of Art===
The [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] acquired a one-hundred-year-old Tibetan home altar in 2004.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; At the time of acquisition, [[soot]] and oil from incense and lamp burning had built up on the surface.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; Consulting with Tibetan Buddhist sources revealed that such surface grime, though a direct result of ritual, is not in and of itself religiously significant and thus was safe to remove.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; The altar is on display in the museum’s Asian Art gallery.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt;

===Newark Museum===
The [[Newark Museum]] is also in possession of a Tibetan Buddhist altar; however, this one was built for the museum after the ritual destruction of a shrine dating from 1935.&lt;ref name="Newark"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tibetan Buddhist Altar|url=https://www.newarkmuseum.org/tibetan-buddhist-altar|website=Newark Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; That shrine had also been built as a display piece for the museum and was never [[Consecration|consecrated]], but the presence of Tibetan ritual objects surrounding it had, in the opinion of religious representatives, sanctified the altar nonetheless.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; When the decision was made to replace it, a deconsecration ceremony was held by a Buddhist official, and the shrine was dismantled.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; The new shrine was designed and built by a Tibetan artist.&lt;ref name="Newark" /&gt;

'''Democratic media''' is a form of media organization that strives to have the principles of [[democracy]] underlying not only the production of content, but also the organization of the entire project.

== Definition of the term ==

Democratic Media is the concept of organising media along democratic lines rather that strictly commercial and/or ideological lines.  Like the idea of democracy itself, democratic media looks to transparency, inclusiveness, one-person-one-vote and other key concepts of democracy as principals of operation, ''"This is a media whose primary objectives are to inform, be open, independent and be accountable."''&lt;ref name=statmediaw&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/24701009/Towards-A-Democratic-Media-Strategic-Media-Planning-v3 Towards A Democratic Media - Strategic Media Planning v3]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in contrast to the idea that media should be run by commercial operations and with an agenda to make profit from providing media and where the media reflects the opinions and values of the owner and /or advertisers It is also in contrast to state-run operations where the media reflects the value system of the state itself.  Edward S Herman lays out what he thought the form that democratic media would take&lt;ref&gt;;Herman, Edward (1997) Triumph of the Market: Essays on Economics, Politics and the Media. Montreal, Black Rose Books. p.215&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote |A democratic media can be identified by its structure and functions.  In terms of structure, it would be organized and controlled by ordinary citizens or their grass roots organisations....As regards function, a democratic media will aim first and foremost at serving the informational, cultural and other communications needs of members of the public which the media institutions comprise or represent.}}

== Background of the term ==
The idea of democratic media stems from the belief that media is a vital part of a democratic society;&lt;ref name=bostrview&gt;Robert W. McChesney, [http://bostonreview.net/BR23.3/mcchesney.html Making Media Democratic], ''[[Boston Review]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote |First, media perform essential political, social, economic, and cultural functions in modern democracies. In such societies, media are the principal source of political information and access to public debate, and the key to an informed, participating, self-governing citizenry. Democracy requires a media system that provides people with a wide range of opinion and analysis and debate on important issues, reflects the diversity of citizens, and promotes public accountability of the powers-that-be and the powers-that-want-to-be.}}

To therefore, if media is vital for democracy, democratic media argues that media itself needs to be organized along different lines to the existing forms;&lt;ref name=bostrview /&gt;

{{cquote |The evidence is clear: if we want a media system that produces fundamentally different results, we need solutions that address the causes of the problems; have to address issues of media ownership, management, regulation, and subsidy. Our goal should be to craft a media system that reduces the power of a handful of enormous corporations and advertisers to dominate the media culture.}}

The idea of democratic media is still in its infancy as noted by Carroll &amp; Hackett (2006&lt;ref&gt;http://mcs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/28/1/83 Democratic media activism through the lens of social movement theory&lt;/ref&gt; where they term it 'democratic media activism' however the idea does have older roots; In 'Triumph of the Market: Essays on Economics, Politics, and the Media' Edward S Herman wrote that democratic media was a condition of democracy;&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Edward (1997) Triumph of the Market: Essays on Economics, Politics and the Media. Montreal, Black Rose Books. p.213&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote |A democratic media is a primary condition of popular rule, hence of a genuine political democracy.  Where the media are controlled by a powerful and privileged elite, whether of government leaders and bureaucrats or those of the private sector, democratic political forms and some kind of limited political democracy may exist, but not genuine democracy.}}

The term has been used to describe a number of [[new media]] projects from Wikipedia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egovmonitor.com/node/3681 Wikipedia: the dawn of democratic media?]&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Indymedia]] movement to describe how it saw itself;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org.uk/media/2005/05/310948.pdf Nottingham Indymedia Flyer]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote |Indymedia is a democratic media outlet for the creation of radical, accurate, and passionate tellings of truth.}}

Democratic media differs from similar (and related) concepts such as [[citizen media]], [[media democracy]] and [[independent media]] (aka alternative media) in that it puts as much emphasis on the organization of the media project as it does on the content.  (Note; this definition means that an independent media or citizen media project can also be a democratic media project, but being an independent media or citizen media project does not mean it is automatically a form of democratic media.  It also means there could be a project that promotes the concepts of media democracy without it itself explicitly claiming to be a form of democratic media.)  For a media project to be considered democratic media it must have (or strive towards) the following characteristics:
*[[Open publishing]]
*[[Transparency (humanities)]]
*[[Accountability]]
*[[Open access (publishing)]]
*[[Non-commercial]]

{{Elections}}
'''Direct election''' is a system of choosing political officeholders in which the voters directly cast ballots for the person, persons, or political party that they desire to see elected. The method by which the winner or winners of a direct election are chosen depends upon the [[voting system|electoral system]] used. The most commonly used systems are the [[Plurality electoral system|plurality system]] and the [[two-round system]] for single-winner elections, such as a presidential election, and [[party-list proportional representation]] for the election of a [[legislature]].

Examples of directly elected bodies are the [[European Parliament]] (since 1979) and the [[United States House of Representatives]]. The MPs (members of parliament), MLAs (members of legislature) and members of the local bodies are elected by direct election.

By contrast, in an [[indirect election]], the voters elect a body which in turn elects the officeholder in question.

In a [[double direct election]], the elected representative serves on two councils, typically a lower tier municipality and an upper tier regional district or municipality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15528">'''Employment discrimination against persons with [[criminal records in the United States]]''' has been illegal since passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. Employers may lawfully consider an applicant's or employee's criminal conviction(s) for employment purposes e.g., hiring, retention, promotion, benefits, and delegated duties. That said, blanket policies or practices e.g., exclusion of all job applicants with convictions from hiring may violate the Act due to the disparate impact on some minorities protected by the act who might have as a subpopulation higher rates of criminal convictions and arrests. Likewise, policies or practices that are not sufficiently narrowly tailored for legitimate business necessity may be violations of the Act—if the discriminatory treatment or impact falls predominantly upon those persons protected by the Act. Title VII applies to businesses with more than 15 employees and defines two types of discrimination, disparate treatment and disparate impact. The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] has been enforcing Title VII since it came into effect in 1965. It has periodically issued an enforcement guidance explaining how employers could use criminal records without violating the Civil Rights Act; in April 2012 it published an enforcement guidance requiring companies to establish procedures to show that they are not using criminal records to discriminate by race or national origin.
The size of the problem is unknown.

==Background==
Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] makes some forms of discrimination against certain categories of persons in the United States illegal. It defines two types of discrimination: [[disparate treatment]] and [[disparate impact]]. The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC), who has been enforcing Title VII since it came into effect in 1965, has periodically issued an 'enforcement guidance' explaining how employers could use criminal records without violating the Civil Rights Act; 
As of 1998, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had interpreted the Civil Rights Act to require that, where an employment policy which discriminates against criminals will have a disparate racial impact, employers must show a [[business necessity]] before automatically disqualifying criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=Sharon Dietrich |author2=Maurice Emsellem |author3=Catherine Ruckelshaus |title=Work Reform: The Other Side of Welfare Reform|volume=9|publisher=Stanley L. &amp; Policy Review|pages=53, 56|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012 the EEOC published an enforcement guidance&lt;ref name=eeoc&gt;{{cite web|title=Consideration of Arrest and Conviction Records in Employment Decisions Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/arrest_conviction.cfm|website=EEOC Enforcement Guidance|publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|accessdate=4 September 2015|date=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring companies to establish procedures to show that they are not using criminal records to discriminate by race or national origin. The EEOC indicated that they were investigating "hundreds of charges related to the use of criminal history in employment".&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|author1=Robb Mandelbaum|title=U.S. Push on Illegal Bias Against Hiring Those With Criminal Records|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/business/smallbusiness/us-presses-on-illegal-bias-against-hiring-those-with-criminal-records.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1|accessdate=4 September 2015|work=NY Times|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; EEOC endorsed removing a conviction question from the job application as a [[best practice]] in its 2012 guidance.

Many statutes{{which|date=September 2015}} and regulations prohibit or restrict hiring criminals for many types of jobs, such as [[law enforcement]] including correction officers [[health care]] or [[education]], the [[military]] as well as the [[Peace Corps]] and/or forbid licensing boards from granting professional licenses. Boards are often required to consider the applicant's [[moral character]] and some are authorized to consider criminal prosecutions which did not result in the applicant's actual conviction of a crime e.g., criminal charges dismissed as a result of deferred adjudication or other diversion program. Professions requiring licensing are increasingly numerous including barbers, locksmiths, electricians, [[general contractor]]s [[subcontractor]]s, and other trades and occupations involving work in private residences and businesses; or with vulnerable members of the public; for example daycare workers for children and seniors. Pilots of planes and ships, as well as drivers of passengers (bus and taxi) and cargo, tow truck drivers, as well as employees with access to airports, and other ports of entry. Emergency Medical Technicians and Paramedics, [[billiard room]] employees, [[Attorney at law|attorney]]s, process servers, Notary Publics, Court Reporters, [[physician]]s, [[pharmacist]]s, [[nurse]]s, [[embalmer]]s, [[septic tank cleaner]]s, [[realtor]]s, [[accountant]]s, NASD/FINRA securities brokers (investment adviser representatives), insurance agents,  bar owners (or restaurants owners with alcohol licenses), and sellers of [[alcoholic beverage]]s, salvage dealers, pawn shop owners.{{fix|link=Wikipedia:Citation needed|text=citation needed|class=noprint Template-Fact|title=This claim needs references to reliable sources}}

==Felons==
As of 2008, 6.6 to 7.4 percent, or about one in 15 working-age adults were ex-felons.&lt;ref name=cepr&gt;{{cite web|author1=John Schmitt &amp; Kris Warner|title=Ex-Offenders and the Labor Market|url=http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/ex-offenders-2010-11.pdf|publisher=Ctr. For Econ. &amp; Policy Research|accessdate=4 September 2015|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an estimate from 2000, there were over 12 million felons in the United States, representing roughly 8% of the working-age population.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=Uggen, Christopher |author2=Melissa Thompson |author3=Jeff Manza  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2000|title=Crime, Class, and Reintegration: The Socioeconomic, Familial, and Civic Lives of Offenders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory===
The Thirteenth Amendment explicitly makes slavery and involuntary servitude for criminals constitutionally permissible in the United States and its territories. Most Americans erroneously believe the 13th Amendment entirely prohibit the practice. The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] requires "due process" but further expressly permits loss of life, liberty, and property. Thus [[felony disenfranchisement]] as well as [[misdemeanor disenfranchisement]]. These provisions are moderated in that punishment can not be "cruel and unusual" which is prohibited by the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eight Amendment]] and by 18 U.S. Code § 1581 and 42 U.S. Code § 1994 which prohibits peonage. The Constitution, [[Article 1 Sections 9 and 10]], also forbids Bills of Attainder but the U.S. Supreme Court has only construed the provision five times (differently) and only after the civil war. [[Collateral consequences of criminal conviction|Collateral consequences of conviction]] although widespread and arguably legislation prohibited by Article 1 has thus seen very little substantial litigation. Moreover, there is a large body of case law that these civil statutes and regulations (collateral consequences) are not penal (criminal punishment) and thus not subject to the Constitution's Article 1 or Double Jeopardy [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th Amendment]] prohibitions. The entire constitution, on the subject-matter of criminal convictions, should be read in [[pari materia]].

The counter-argument: It has been pointed out that constitutional approval of felons' political powerlessness is not the same as constitutional approval of government prejudice toward the politically powerless. Such prejudice may arguably violate the [[Equal Protection Clause]], which itself contains no exclusionary provision authorizing discrimination against felons (although several other provisions explicitly authorize discrimination). A "discrete and insular" minority subject to prejudice, in particular, may be considered particularly vulnerable to oppression by the majority, and thus a [[suspect class]] worthy of protection by the judiciary.&lt;ref name=Geiger&gt;{{citation|title=The Case for Treating Ex-Offenders as a Suspect Class|author=Ben Geiger|publisher=California Law Review|volume=94|number=4|date=Jul 2006|pages=1191–1242|jstor=20439062}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 1998, seven states absolutely barred felons from public employment. Other states had more narrow restrictions, for instance, only covering infamous crimes or misdemeanors and felonies involving [[moral turpitude]]. Some laws have been criticized for being overinclusive;{{fix
|link=Wikipedia:Citation needed
|text=citation needed
|class=noprint Template-Fact
|title=This claim needs references to reliable sources
}}for instance, a law banning all criminals from working in health care jobs could prevent a person convicted of [[bribery]] or [[shoplifting]] from sweeping the halls of a hospital. [[California law]] provides that a criminal record can affect one's application for a professional license only if "the crime or act is substantially related to the qualifications, functions and duties of the business or profession for which the application is made."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|jstor=40040198|title=Unequal Protection: Comparing Former Felons' Challenges to Disenfranchisement and Employment Discrimination|author=Author(s): Elena Saxonhouse|publisher=Stanford Law Review|volume=56|number=6|date=May 2004|pages=1597–1639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, a certificate of rehabilitation can prevent a person from being denied a license solely on the basis that he has been convicted of a felony.&lt;ref&gt;http://law.justia.com/california/codes/bpc/480-489.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://felonyfriendlyjobs.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Texas Administrative Regulations]] requires, for some licensing, that a variety of factors, such as the nature and seriousness of the crime, the relationship of the crime to the purposes for requiring a license to engage in the occupation, the amount of time since the person's last criminal activity, and [[letters of recommendation]], be taken into account (even when the applicant has a felony).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=§213.28 Licensure of Persons with Criminal Offenses |url=http://info.sos.state.tx.us/pls/pub/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=T&amp;app=9&amp;p_dir=F&amp;p_rloc=137017&amp;p_tloc=14910&amp;p_ploc=1&amp;pg=7&amp;p_tac=&amp;ti=22&amp;pt=11&amp;ch=213&amp;rl=29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724134946/http://info.sos.state.tx.us/pls/pub/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=T&amp;app=9&amp;p_dir=F&amp;p_rloc=137017&amp;p_tloc=14910&amp;p_ploc=1&amp;pg=7&amp;p_tac=&amp;ti=22&amp;pt=11&amp;ch=213&amp;rl=29 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
While such discretionary guidelines may exist (statutes and regulations), prospective licensees are often provided merely a sham process to better legitimize prejudicial licensure denial. For example, Texas allows an appeal from such licensing commission to an Administrative Law Judge but such judge has no authority to overturn the licensure denial (merely issue an advisory opinion). Further, the Texas Supreme Court has held there is no due process or open courts right to appeal from an administrative proceeding. Thus, the licensing commission's abuse of discretion or erroneous application of law is not genuinely subject to meaningful review and correction. Further, the incompletely cited regulations above, are significantly biased in favor of white privilege, including socio-economic factors, e.g., has the applicant been steadily employed, supported his/her dependents, paid all fines, court costs, restitution. Such licensing standards are particularly unfair to minorities due to lower overall rates on employment and higher rates of poverty and family instability. Further, whereas applicants may submit letters of recommendation from anyone, the regulation is expressly preferential if from the prosecutors, the warden, sheriff or police chief where the applicant resides, or the police who made the arrest. In most instances, due to high caseloads of urban courts, and rates of crime in urban areas, as well as the generally lower-socio-economic status of those convicted, most will lack both access to and community standing to garner such criminal justice officials to vouch much less prepare a written recommendation for them to be licensed. It also violates attorney ethics for an attorney (including a prosecutor) to speak directly to the client (including a criminal defendant) that is represented by opposing counsel. No less problematic, post-conviction licensing is outside the scope of representation for a court-appointed criminal defense lawyers and public defenders. The U.S. Supreme Court has also ruled except for deportation a defendant's lawyer is not constitutionally required to inform such client about adverse employment and licensing consequences.

==All offenders==
Data on criminal histories are widely disseminated by private sector agencies.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} It is difficult for a job applicant to prove that a prospective employer illegally discriminated against the applicant based on information on [[expunged]] convictions or dismissed charges.&lt;!--{{Fact}} begin--&gt;{{fix

Legislators in States find themselves in precarious positions when approached to pass specific legislation for the protection of this type of discrimination.  Common entertainment such as Law and Order SVU and Criminal Minds further distort the realities of threat or recidivism when it applies to rehabilitated offenders returning to citizenship in society.

'''Father Guido Sarducci''' is a fictional character created by the American [[comedian]] [[Don Novello]]. Sarducci, a chain-smoking priest with tinted glasses, works in the United States as gossip columnist and rock critic for the [[Holy See|Vatican]] newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' (sometimes mentioned as ''The Vatican Enquirer'', a take-off of the [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] ''[[The National Enquirer]]'').

==Description==
Novello created the character in 1973, after he purchased the outfit (consisting of big floppy black hat, white clerical collar, and a long, red-trimmed black coat with cape) for $7.50 at a [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul#St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Store|St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Store]]. The character was featured in 1970s cartoons by the [[underground comics|underground cartoonist]]s [[Dave Sheridan (artist)|Dave Sheridan]] and Fred Schrier, appearing in person in the early 1970s on ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]'' and later in the 1975 ''[[Smothers Brothers]]'' TV show. His most prominent appearances were on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the late 1970s, during which time Novello was also a writer for the show. In the late 1970s, Father Guido Sarducci was featured on radio commercials for ''[[High Times]]'' magazine where he offered to perform blessings for a fee.

==Broadcast History==
On his first appearance on ''Saturday Night Live'', a skit called "How to Pay for Your Sins" on a 1978 episode hosted by [[Richard Dreyfuss]], he was on crutches from an injury suffered during a dress rehearsal sketch about hockey players. Most of his appearances on ''SNL'' have been on ''[[Weekend Update]]'', including one where he reported that "The take at the shrines in Italy has gone down" which he suggested correcting by creating "Shrinemobiles" and thus taking the shrines to where the people were, and another where he is sent to [[London]] to try to wake up [[Paul McCartney]] at 4:30 in the morning (11:30 in New York) by throwing coins, obnoxiously singing [[The Beatles]] and [[Wings (band)|Wings]] songs, and finally, throwing a rock at the window (he says it works every time).

===1980 SNL===
One of Sarducci's most memorable SNL pieces occurred on February 16, 1980, when he actually managed to corner Richard Nixon at 1 a.m. outside the former president's New York City home for an interview. A stunned looking Mr. Nixon did not respond to the one question that Sarducci managed to get out before the end of airtime: "Mr. President, Mr. President, if you coulda be any animal in the world, whata would it be?" 

Sarducci has appeared in four [[cold openings]] in the 1979–1980 season (on episodes hosted by [[Steve Martin]], [[Teri Garr]], [[Elliott Gould]], and [[Rodney Dangerfield]]), two commercial parodies ("MX-5 Tampons" on the 1981–1982 Christmas episode hosted by [[Bill Murray]] and "Bocce Ball My Way" on the last episode of the 1985–1986 season hosted by [[Anjelica Huston]] and [[Billy Martin]]), and two monologues on the 1985–86 season (the first hosted by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in a pretaped sketch showing Madonna's wedding to Sean Penn (played by [[Robert Downey, Jr.]]) and the second on the Christmas episode of the 1985–86 season hosted by Garr as Sarducci's alter ego, Pope Maurice).

===SNL host===
Sarducci also hosted two ''SNL'' episodes during the 1983-84 season (when [[Dick Ebersol]] was executive producer) and cameoed during two 1990s episodes, most notably on a ''Weekend Update'' segment where he reports on [[Pope John Paul II]]'s missing wallet. Father Guido Sarducci has 31 appearances on ''SNL'', the most of any of the recurring characters.

===Vatican visit===
In 1981 Novello made newspaper headlines when he visited [[Vatican City]] wearing the Father Guido Sarducci costume to do a photo shoot for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. After taking pictures in an area where photography was prohibited, he and his photographer, Paul Solomon, were arrested by the [[Swiss Guard]]s and Novello was charged with "impersonating a priest". Although the guards attempted to confiscate the film from the shoot, Solomon managed to hand them the wrong film. The charges were later dropped. In the early 1980s, Novello was featured in ads promoting candidates for the priesthood. He listed one advantage of being a priest as getting first pick at the annual parish garage sale.

===Other television shows===
During the 1980s and 1990s Sarducci appeared on other television shows, including ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'', ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', ''[[Married... with Children]]'', ''[[Unhappily Ever After]]'', ''[[Blossom (TV series)|Blossom]]'', ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]'', and ''[[Square Pegs]]''. In 1980, Sarducci appeared in ''[[Gilda Live!]]'', a film and an album recording based on [[Gilda Radner]]'s successful one-woman show which had been playing on Broadway. In 1983, he appeared in a music video for the Rodney Dangerfield song "Rappin' Rodney", where he gave Rodney his last rites on death row, and helped himself to Rodney's french fries from his last meal.  In 1984, he appeared in a [[music video]] for the [[Jefferson Starship]] song "No Way Out". In 1995, he appeared as a priest trying to perform an exorcism in the movie ''[[Casper (film)|Casper]]''. The same movie featured a cameo by his fellow ''SNL'' alumnus [[Dan Aykroyd]] as the [[Ghostbusters|Ghostbuster]] Ray Stantz.

===Albums===
He appeared on the 2002 album ''A Classic Rock Christmas'' performing the song "Santa's Lament" featuring [[Joe Walsh]] and [[Joe Vitale (musician)|Joe Vitale]].

The character also appeared on the [[Handsome Boy Modeling School]] albums ''[[So... How's Your Girl?]]'' and ''[[White People (album)|White People]]'', telling biographical stories of the life of a professional male model in the latter. Novello also released two [[comedy]] albums as Sarducci: ''[[Breakfast in Heaven]]'' and ''Live at St. Douglas Convent.''


===Additional appearances===
He also appeared on the [[MSNBC]] show ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]'' on March 19, 2005, discussing ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and his DaVinci Code Decoder Ring.

In [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Studios]]' animated film ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'' released in 2001, Don Novello uses the voice and speech style of Father Sarducci to portray the character of demolitions expert Vinny Santorini.

Sarducci was present at the First Annual "Geno Roast" at the Aqua Turf in [[Southington, Connecticut]]. He gave the prayer of invocation and roasted the [[Connecticut Huskies|UConn Huskies]] women's basketball coach [[Geno Auriemma]]. He also made a guest appearance on the April 30, 2005, broadcast of NPR and Chicago Public Radio's ''[[Wait Wait… Don't Tell Me!]]'' news quiz show, commenting on the ascension of [[Pope Benedict XVI]].

He appeared on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on June 23, 2010, claiming to have conducted an interview with [[Glenn Beck]] while visiting the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/3dk57p/the-colbert-report-prophet-glenn-beck---father-guido-sarducci%3C!--|title=Prophet Glenn Beck - Father Guido Sarducci - The Colbert Report (Video Clip) - Comedy Central|website=Comedy Central|accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benediction===
He delivered the [[benediction]] at the Stewart/Colbert [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]] from the Mall in D.C. on October 30, 2010. He was wearing his classic white clerical collar, a long red-trimmed black coat with cape, zebra vest/jacket and black beret.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.longislandpress.com/2010/10/30/father-guido-sarducci-father-guido-sarducci-gives-benediction-at-rally-to-restore-sanity/ Father Guido Sarducci Gives Benediction at Rally to Restore Sanity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102144320/http://www.longislandpress.com/2010/10/30/father-guido-sarducci-father-guido-sarducci-gives-benediction-at-rally-to-restore-sanity/ |date=2010-11-02 }}; ''Long Island Press''; October 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of the United States government to tax and spend in specific regions has large implications to economic activity and performance.  Taxes are indexed to wages and profits and therefore areas of high taxation are correlated with areas of higher per capita income and more economic activity.

Spending is largely focused on areas of poverty, the elderly, and centers of federal employment such as military bases.

==Background==
{{See also|United States federal budget|Federal tax revenue by state|Expenditures in the United States federal budget|Demographics of the United States}}
The ability of the government to tax and spend in specific regions has large implications to economic activity and performance. The main question behind this issue stems into three different approaches. First, federal spending should be neutral, meaning federal taxation should roughly equal expenditures. Second, it should be redistributive, meaning rich states should be taxed most heavily and poorer states should receive more benefits. Third, spending and taxation should be accidental ''per se'', meaning higher taxation should be performed based on income but with little relation to geographic region and spending should be done where it allows for the most efficiency. The main issue driving this research is the question between equity and equality (Leonard and Walder, Page 17).

Typically, it is seen taxes are highly indexed to wages and therefore places of high taxation are geographically found in areas with higher per capita income. The problem with taxation indexed to wages is that it does not consider cost of living. In areas with higher per capita income, it is highly likely that the cost of living is also higher; for instance, this is the case in New York. The effect of not indexing to costs of living makes some states look wealthier compared to others. It is typical that states with low costs of living receive more in spending than states with high costs of living (Leonard and Walder, Page 19). After discounting income with costs of living, New York's poverty level increases a significant amount (Pear, Page 2). The significance level between high levels of poverty and high taxation may be arguable.

Spending is not so easily located geographically. The breakdown of federal spending is done in the following ways: [[defense (military)]], non-defense discretionary, [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], grants, and various other programs. Defense spending is the most volatile, as it is usually found to be higher in states with established defense contractors and other defense facilities. Areas of higher social insurance spending are typically seen in areas of larger elderly population. Social security is the dominant expenditure of per dollar federal expenditures.

Other factors of spending are largely political in the sense that politicians who can effectively argue for more spending get the most spending for their states. Some trends of spending as of 1999 are as follows: defense spending in the South and the national capital, non-defense discretionary spending between the Midwest and the Rockies, most Medicare and Social Security is located in the East and Central/Midwest, and other assistance programs following the Appalachian Mountains from [[Louisiana]]/[[Mississippi]] to Maine (Leonard and Walder, Page 30).

==Federal spending by state as of FY 2013==

Through fiscal year 2010, the Census Bureau produced the annual Consolidated Federal Funds Report, tracking Federal expenditures both geographically and by agency and program. As of 2011, funding for the Federal Financial Statistics program, of which the CFFR was part, was cut from the Federal budget. Private organizations such as the [[National Priorities Project]] and [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]] have since developed their own reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chokshi|first1=Niraj|title=The government cut a valuable report on federal spending on states. Now two think tanks are trying to recreate it|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/10/16/what-do-you-do-when-the-feds-cut-a-valuable-program-build-your-own-of-course/|accessdate=12 January 2016|publisher=The Washington Post|date=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The tables below are from the 2014 Pew report.)

==Trends==

The balance of payments receipts has typically remained fairly stable over the past fifteen years with limited changes between those states with net benefits and those with net contributions. The Fisc states that the federal deficit increased due to human resource expenditures, increased tax cuts, and increased military expenditure during the 1980s. The Fisc further reports that in expectations and defense spending declined in the 1990s one would expect the expenditure per state to decrease along with the government. However, some states, such as [[Kentucky]], [[Idaho]] and [[Oklahoma]], actually saw large increases in defense spending, which increased their BOP. Overall, though, increases in non-defense spending were not on the same magnitude as the decline of defense spending (Leonard and Walder, Page 36–39).

The report argues that defense and Social Security and Medicare have a small negative correlation, and as a result large reductions in defense spending do not bode well for increases in spending on Social Security or Medicare. Defense expenditures tend to be the most volatile over time and state, however, total expenditures are roughly constant, which means that increases (decreases) in defense correlate with decreases (increases) in other non-defense and non- social insurance expenditures. Income taxes used to finance expenditures are not extremely volatile around the national average.

===Changes in expenditure===

Decrease in defense expenditure has been a large key to overall changes in expenditure, both in salaries for bases and for procurement of defense. Due to restructuring or closing military bases, as determined by the [[Base Closure and Realignment Commission]], most states have incurred declines in defense spending via salaries. [[California]], with 24 recommendations for closure or realignment, has had the largest decline in defense spending, which attributes to a loss of roughly $50 billion, given the population increase since the early 1980s.  Most states have also seen decline in procurement defense spending, but eight states have seen it increase, and in Kentucky's case it has doubled (Leonard and Walder, Page 36-39, 44-47).

Social Security has increased in expenditure primarily in the Southern states. It was thought that since the largest expenditure is retirement aid that social security expenditure was following the elderly.  However, this was not the case, as the data did not correlate between elderly population and increases in social security expenditure.  Further expenditures in social security are caused by the increase in disability insurance.  The Fisc argues that the later policy changes in the 1980s involving beneficiary eligibility may have a time lag, meaning the causes of those changes are just now being felt.  Medicare costs have continued to increase as well as the population ages and as health care costs increase.  Most of the increased expenditure has been seen in the south.  Grants have increased, but have been relatively stable over the fifteen-year period taken into consideration.  The largest increase has been in the form of [[Medicaid]] expenditures (Leonard and Walder,  Page 47-54).

The changes in taxes have remained fairly stable over time, and are strongly correlated with income per capita per state.  It follows that as state's per capita income rises, its tax receipt also increases. The data between changes in per capita taxes to the national averages in ratio to the changes in the per capita income to the national average has a correlation of .88 (Leonard and Walder, Page 56-57).

==History of federal monitoring of taxation and spending by state==

The monitoring of '''federal spending and taxation and its variation between states''' in the [[United States]] began in 1977 under a query run by [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], Democratic senator of [[New York (state)|New York]]. The query was designed to determine whether the state of New York was paying more in taxes than it was receiving in federal spending.  The determination is made by looking at an individual state's [[balance of payments]] (BOP), which is total income minus outlays.

Initially, many thought New York was a net gainer, receiving more funding than it was paying out in taxes, because of large payments to the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]], but in actuality, those payments were interest payments on the United States federal debt, which were distributed to foreign individuals and governments for purchasing of [[United States Treasury security#Treasury bond|US Treasury bonds]] (Leonard and Walder, Page 9). After separating those expenditures from actual expenditures in New York, it was found that the state was actually a donor. This event stimulated more controversy over the topic of spending and taxation.

After the Federal Community Services Administration noticed the flaw in the balance of payments in New York, it revised its data and provided the revised data under the title ''The Geographical Distribution of Federal Expenditures'', which was used in determining the expenditures for this analysis. This is now entitled "the Fisc".

==Politics and controversy of unequal contributions by states to the federal budget==

The US Constitution requires that direct taxes be apportioned to the states according to their population, so that per capita revenues from the states would be equal.  Indirect taxes do not have this restriction. After a US Supreme Court case held that an income tax on income derived from property was in the same category as a direct tax on property, the 16th amendment was passed to allow indirect taxation on income in proportion to their income, from what ever source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html|title=The Constitution of the United States: Amendments 11-27|work=archives.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that time, taxation as well as spending per capita has ranged widely between the states. (See table below).  At the same time, one of the great controversies of national politics has become whether to increase or decrease federal spending and the size of the federal government, with Republicans largely in favor of decreasing its size and Democrats pushing to keep it the same or increase it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/us/politics/03congress.html?_r=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Several commentators have pointed out that the states that benefit the most by federal spending are the very states whose populations tend to vote for leaders who promise to reduce federal spending, while those that benefit the least from large government vote for politicians who promise to make it even larger at their expense.  In other words, Democratic-leaning states tend to be net contributors to the federal budget while Republican-leaning states are more often net recipients of federal spending.  Various explanations for this seemingly contradictory situation exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taxfoundation.org/blog/why-do-some-states-feast-federal-spending-not-others|title=Why Do Some States Feast on Federal Spending, Not Others?|work=Tax Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/speakeasy/2010/04/18/red-state-moochers-federal-taxes-favor-those-who-complain-the-most-about-federal-taxes|title=Red-State Moochers: Federal Taxes Favor Those Who Complain the Most About Federal Taxes|work=Alternet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/blame-fdr-and-lbj-for-moocher-paradox-in-red-states.html|title=Blame FDR and LBJ for ‘Moocher’ Paradox in Red States|date=19 September 2012|work=BloombergView.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferriter's Cove''' is a small bay located at the westernmost point of [[Dingle Peninsula]], in [[County Kerry]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is in the Dún Urlainn (Dunurlin) parish and electoral division of the Dingle rural area (pop. 438, 2011 census).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011vol1andprofile1/Census_2011_-_Population_Classified_by_Area.pdf|last1=An Phríomh-Oifig Staidrimh|title=Population Classified by Area|website=www.cso.ie|access-date=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The cove was named after the Ferriter family name, which derives from the Norman French ''le Fereter''. Walter le Fereter, the ancestor of many later Ferriters, is the first person known in the area with the name and probably arrived following other Normans from Dublin. He was mentioned twice in a plea roll of 1252. The parish of Dunurlin is also recorded as being in the Ferriter's possession, and the name also exists in the nearby village of Baile 'n Fhirtéaraigh (Ballyferriter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2058456/The_Ferriters_of_Kerry/|last1=MacCotter|first1=Paul|title=The Ferriters of Kerry|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rock formations - geograph.org.uk - 219305.jpg|thumb|Volcanic Silurian rocks at Ferriter's Cove.]]

==Geography==
At the northern limit, the bedrock around the Cove is Devonian (419.2-358.9 mya) in age, beginning with conglomerate sandstone and siltstone of the Pointagare group, then the Ballydavid sandstone formation and further south the medium-grained Farran sandstone formation. Furthest south the igneous Silurian (443.8–419.2 mya) rocks of the Foilnamahagh Formation are dominant, with lavas and pyroclastic remnants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcenr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=a30af518e87a4c0ab2fbde2aaac3c228|last1=Roinn Cumarsáide, Gníomhaithe ar son na hAeráide &amp; Comhshaoil|title=Geological Survey Ireland Spatial Resources|website=www.arcgis.com|access-date=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2017-02.jpg/|last1=International Commission on Stratigraphy|title=International Chronostratigraphic Chart|website=www.stratigraphy.org|access-date=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2009 and 2017 (at Baile 'n Fhirtéaraigh), for January and July respectively, the mean temperatures are 8 C and 16C and the mean rainfall 207mm and 153mm; the highest and lowest mean wind speeds were 39.3 km/h (November 2009) and 14.3 km/h (July 2013) respectively, with the highest wind speeds generally in winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldweatheronline.com/ballyferriter-weather-averages/kerry/ie.aspx|last1=World Weather Online|title=Ballyferriter monthly climate averages|website=www.worldweatheronline.com|access-date=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
Excavations performed in the late 20th century have provided evidence that people lived there during the [[Mesolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodman|first1=P.C|last2=Anderson|first2=E.|last3=Finlay|first3=N.|title=Excavations at Ferriter’s Cove, 1983-95: last foragers, first farmers in the Dingle Peninsula|date=1999|publisher=Wordwell|location=Bray|isbn=186985733X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OB"&gt;{{cite book |author1=O'Sullivan, Aidan  |author2=Breen, Colin| year=2007 |title=Maritime Ireland.

The excavations at Ferriter’s Cove were conducted by [[Peter C. Woodman]]. They followed a find in 1983 by an amateur archaeologist of a flint knife, believed to be from the Neolithic period.

Woodman's team found implements that dated the site to the late Mesolithic. These included a grindstone, marked sandstone pebbles, shell dumps, various hearths and five mudstone axes that had been deposited together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodman|first1=P.C|last2=Anderson|first2=E.|last3=Finlay|first3=N.|title=Excavations at Ferriter’s Cove, 1983-95: last foragers, first farmers in the Dingle Peninsula|date=1999|publisher=Wordwell|location=Bray|isbn=186985733X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site has been interpreted as following the model of ephemeral Later Mesolithic habitation of short term stays, and the dating suggests that the site was used intermittently over a millennium, with more or less three phases.&lt;ref name="lithicsireland.ie"&gt;[http://www.lithicsireland.ie/mlitt_mesolithic_west_ireland_chap_3.html Driscoll, K. The Early Prehistory in the West of Ireland: Investigations into the Social Archaeology of the Mesolithic, West of the Shannon, Ireland (2006).]&lt;/ref&gt; While Ferriter's Cove contained no formal burials, several pieces of human bone and teeth were found, one dating to 4225–3950 BC, and the other to 4250–3980 BC.&lt;ref name="lithicsireland.ie"&gt;[http://www.lithicsireland.ie/mlitt_mesolithic_west_ireland_chap_3.html Driscoll, K.

In 2012, further research was published confirming evidence of Neolithic farmers at Ferriter's cove, providing the first evidence of farming in Ireland. The remains of cattle and sheep, the latter not native to Ireland, were investigated; carbon dating showed that they were alive c. 4350 BC.&lt;ref name="Ireland's DNA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prehistoric Genocide in Ireland?|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mace-lab/genetic-ancestry/guff_documents/Genocide_in_Ireland.pdf|website=Ireland's DNA|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12338">[[Geographic information system]]s (GISs) and [[geographic information science]] (GIScience) combine computer-mapping capabilities with additional [[database]] management and [[data analysis]] tools.  Commercial GIS systems are very powerful and have touched many applications and industries, including [[environmental science]], [[urban planning]], agricultural applications, and others.

[[Public health]] is another focus area that has made increasing use of GIS techniques.  A strict definition of public health is difficult to pin down, as it is used in different ways by different groups.  In general, public health differs from personal health in that it is (1) focused on the health of populations rather than of individuals, (2) focused more on prevention than on treatment, and (3) operates in a mainly governmental (rather than private) context.&lt;ref&gt;O’Carroll, P.W. (2003). Introduction to public health informatics.  In P.W. O’Carroll, Y.A. Yasnoff, M.E. Ward, L.H. Ripp, and E.L. Martin (Ed.), Public Health Informatics (pp. 1–15). New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;   These efforts fall naturally within the domain of problems requiring use of [[spatial analysis]] as part of the solution, and GIS and other spatial analysis tools are therefore recognized as providing potentially transformational capabilities for public health efforts.

This article presents some history of use of geographic information and geographic information systems in public health application areas, provides some examples showing the utilization of GIS techniques in solving specific public health problems, and finally addresses several potential issues arising from increased use of these GIS techniques in the public health arena.

== History ==
[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|215px|Dr. Snow's map showing cholera cases in London during the epidemic of 1854.]]

Public health efforts have been based on analysis and use of spatial data for many years.  Dr. [[John Snow (physician)]], often credited as the father of [[epidemiology]], is arguably the most famous of those examples.&lt;ref&gt;Lumpkin, J.R. (2003). History and significance of information systems and public health.  In P.W. O’Carroll, Y.A. Yasnoff, M.E. Ward, L.H. Ripp, and E.L. Martin (Ed.), Public Health Informatics (pp. 16–38). New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Snow used a hand-drawn map to analyze the geographic locations of deaths related to cholera in London in the mid-1850s.  His map, which superimposed the locations of [[cholera]] deaths with those of public water supplies, pinpointed the Broad Street pump as the most likely source of the cholera outbreak.  Removal of the pump handle led to a rapid decline in the incidence of cholera, helping the medical community to eventually conclude that cholera was a water-borne disease. 

Dr. Snow's work provides an indication of how a GIS could benefit public health investigations and other research.  He continued to analyze his data, eventually showing that the incidence rate of cholera was also related to local elevation as well as soil type and alkalinity.  Low-lying areas, particularly those with poorly draining soil, were found to have higher incidence rates for cholera, which Dr. Snow attributed to the pools of water that tended to collect there, again showing evidence that cholera was in fact a water-borne disease (rather than one borne by 'miasma' as was commonly believed at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hanchette, C.L. (2003). Geographic Information Systems.  In P.W. O’Carroll, Y.A. Yasnoff, M.E. Ward, L.H. Ripp, and E.L. Martin (Ed.), Public Health Informatics (pp. 431–466). New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an early example of what has come to be known as [[disease diffusion mapping]], an area of study based on the idea that a disease starts from some source or central point and then spreads throughout the local area according to patterns and conditions there.  This is another area of research where the capabilities of a GIS have been shown to be of help to practitioners.

== GIS for public health ==
[[File:UpdatedHeartDiseaseMap.jpg|thumb|532px|More modern disease map showing deaths from heart disease among white males in the US from 2000–2004.]]

Today’s public health problems are much larger in scope than those Dr. Snow faced, and researchers today depend on modern GIS and other computer mapping applications to assist in their analyses.  For example, see the map to the right depicting death rates from heart disease among white males above age 35 in the US between 2000 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/gis/atmappne.pdf, retrieved March 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Public health informatics]] (PHI) is an emerging  specialty which focuses on the application of information science and technology to public health practice and research.&lt;ref&gt;Hanchette, C.L. (2003). Geographic Information Systems.  In P.W. O’Carroll, Y.A. Yasnoff, M.E. Ward, L.H. Ripp, and E.L. Martin (Ed.), Public Health Informatics (pp. 431–466). New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of that effort, a GIS – or more generally a [[spatial decision support system]] (SDSS) – offers improved [[geographic visualization]] techniques, leading to faster, better, and more robust understanding and decision-making capabilities in the public health arena.&lt;ref&gt;Yasnoff, W.A. and Miller, P.L. (2003). Decision Support and Expert Systems in Public Health. In P.W. O’Carroll, Y.A. Yasnoff, M.E. Ward, L.H. Ripp, and E.L. Martin (Ed.), Public Health Informatics (pp. 494–512). New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, GIS displays have been used to show a clear relationship between clusters of emergent Hepatitis C cases and those of known intravenous drug users in Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;Trooskin S, Hadler J, St. Louis T, and Navarro V (2005). Geospatial analysis of hepatitis C in Connecticut: a novel application of a public health tool.  Public Health, 119(11), 1042–7. Retrieved from Academic Search Premier database.&lt;/ref&gt;  Causality is difficult to prove conclusively – collocation does not establish causation – but confirmation of previously established causal relationships (like intravenous drug use and Hepatitis C) can strengthen acceptance of those relationships, as well as help to demonstrate the utility and reliability of GIS-related solution techniques.  Conversely, showing the coincidence of potential causal factors with the ultimate effect can help suggest a potential causal relationship, thereby driving further investigation and analysis (source needed?).

Alternately, GIS techniques have been used to show a lack of correlation between causes and effects or between different effects.  For example, the distributions of both birth defects and infant mortality in Iowa were studied, and the researchers found no relationship in those data.&lt;ref&gt;Rushton, G., Krishnamurthy, R., Krishnamurti, D., Lolonis, P., and Song, H. (1996). The spatial relationship between infant mortality and birth defects rates in a US city. Statistics in Medicine, 15, Retrieved from Academic Search Premier database.1907–19. Retrieved from Academic Search Premier database.&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the conclusion that birth defects and infant mortality are likely unrelated, and are likely due to different causes and risk factors.

GIS can support public health in different ways as well.  First and foremost, GIS displays can help inform proper understanding and drive better decisions.  For example, elimination of health disparities is one of two primary goals of [[Healthy People 2010]], one of the preeminent public health programs in existence today in the US.  GIS can play a significant role in that effort, helping public health practitioners identify areas of disparities or inequities, and ideally helping them identify and develop solutions to address those shortcomings.  GIS can also help researchers integrate disparate data from a wide variety of sources, and can even be used to enforce quality control measures on those data.  Much public health data is still manually generated, and is therefore subject to human-generated mistakes and miscoding.  For example, geographic analysis of health care data from North Carolina showed that just over  40% of the records contained errors of some sort in the geographic information (city, county, or zip code), errors that would have gone undetected without the visual displays provided by GIS.&lt;ref&gt;Hanchette, C.L. (2003). Geographic Information Systems.  In P.W. O’Carroll, Y.A. Yasnoff, M.E. Ward, L.H. Ripp, and E.L. Martin (Ed.), Public Health Informatics (pp. 431–466). New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;  Correction of these errors led not only to more correct GIS displays, but also improved ALL analyses using those data.

== Issues with GIS for public health ==

There are also concerns or issues with use of GIS tools for public health efforts.  Chief among those is a concern for [[privacy]] and confidentiality of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Hanchette, C.L. (2003). Geographic Information Systems.  In P.W. O’Carroll, Y.A. Yasnoff, M.E. Ward, L.H. Ripp, and E.L. Martin (Ed.), Public Health Informatics (pp. 431–466). New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;  Public health is concerned about the health of the population as a whole, but must use data on the health of individuals to make many of those assessments, and protecting the privacy and confidentiality of those individuals is of paramount importance.  Use of GIS displays and related databases raises the potential of compromising those privacy standards, so some precautions are necessary to avoid pinpointing individuals based on spatial data.  For example, data may need to be aggregated to cover larger areas such as a zip code or county, helping to mask individual identities.  Maps can also be constructed at smaller scales so that less detail is revealed.  Alternately, key identifying features (such as the road and street network) can be left off the maps to mask exact location, or it may even be advisable to intentionally offset the location markers by some random amount if deemed necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Hanchette, C.L. (2003). Geographic Information Systems.  In P.W. O’Carroll, Y.A. Yasnoff, M.E. Ward, L.H. Ripp, and E.L. Martin (Ed.), Public Health Informatics (pp. 431–466). New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
It is well established in the literature that statistical inference based on aggregated data can lead researchers to erroneous conclusions, suggesting relationships that in fact do not exist or obscuring relationships that do in fact exist.  This issue is known as the [[modifiable areal unit problem]]. For example, New York public health officials worried that cancer clusters and causes would be misidentified after they were forced to post maps showing cancer cases by ZIP code on the internet.  Their assertion was that ZIP codes were designed for a purpose unrelated to public health issues, and so use of these arbitrary boundaries might lead to inappropriate groupings and then to incorrect conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Rushton  G, Elmes G, McMaster R (2003). Considerations for improving geographic information research in public health. URISA Journal, 12(2), 31–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==

Use of GIS in public health is an application area still in its infancy.  Like most new applications, there is a lot of promise, but also a lot of pitfalls that must be avoided along the way.  Many researchers and practitioners are concentrating of this effort, hoping that the benefits outweigh the risks and the costs associated with this emerging application area for modern GIS techniques.

The '''Institute of Coptic Studies''' (معهد الدراسات القبطية) was founded in 1954&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/829/cu2.htm AlAhram weekly article on Isaac Fanous] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216041300/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/829/cu2.htm |date=2007-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. It is based in [[Cairo]].

==Description==
The institute is the Egyptian church's main research centre in subjects of [[Coptology]] and for shared in many research about different aspect of Coptology since its establishment.
The [[Copt]]ic painters [[Isaac Fanous]] and [[Adel Nassief]] studied in the institute.

The institute is involved in postgraduate studies in Coptic subjects including [[Coptic music]], [[Coptic art]], [[Coptic iconography]] and [[Coptic history]].

One of the teachers was [[Mikhail Girgis El Batanouny]], the Coptic music expert.

From 1955 to 1985 [[Iris Habib Elmasry]] continued to lecture in Coptic History at the Institute of Coptic Studies.

==Foundation==
The institute was mainly founded by its first president Professor [[Aziz Suryal Atiya]]; who was also the Founder of the Middle East center, [[University of Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/syltguides/fullview/PN1YR1HMUGAQ Coptology Amazon]&lt;/ref&gt;
Other prominent Coptologists and Egyptologists contributed to its establishment as Professor Dr [[Pahor Labib]] Director of the Coptic Museum in Old Cairo (1951–1965).

'''Josef Dobrovský''', {{lang-hu|'''Dobrowsky József'''}} (17 August, 1753 – 6 January, 1829) was a Czech [[philologist]] and [[historian]], one of the most important figures of the [[Czech National Revival]] along with [[Josef Jungmann]].

== Life and work ==
Dobrovský was born at [[Balassagyarmat]] ({{lang-de|Jahrmarkt}}, {{lang-cs|[[Ďarmoty]], [[Děrmet]], [[Balašské Ďarmoty]]}}, {{lang-sk|{{illm|Balážske Ďarmoty|sk|display=1|vertical-align=sup|}}|}}), [[Nógrád County (former)|Nógrád County]], in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], when his father Jakub Doubravský (1701, {{illm|Solnitz|de|display=1|vertical-align=sup|}} ({{lang-cs|[[Solnice]]}}), [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Royal Bohemia]] {{ndash}} 1764, {{illm|Bischofteinitz|de|Horšovský Týn|display=1|vertical-align=sup|}} ({{lang-cs|{{illm|Horšovský Týn|cs|display=1|vertical-align=sup|}}}}, Bohemia)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/Jakub-Dobrovsk%C3%BD/6000000066592919847 geni.com]&lt;/ref&gt; was temporarily stationed as a [[soldier]] there. His mother was Magdalena Dobrovská (1733, {{illm|Tschaslawsko|de|vertical-align=sup|}} ([[Czaslawsko]], {{illm|Čáslavsko|cs|display=1|vertical-align=sup|}}), Bohemia {{ndash}} 1797)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/Magdalena-Dobrovsk%C3%BD/6000000066592757919 geni.com]&lt;/ref&gt;.

He received his first education in the [[German language|German]] school at [[Horšovský Týn]] in Plzeň district, made his first acquaintance with the [[Czech language]] and soon made himself fluent in it at the [[Havlickuv Brod|Německý Brod]] gymnasium, and then studied for some time under the [[Jesuits]] at [[Klatovy]]. In 1769 he began to study [[philosophy]] at the  [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]]. In 1772 he was admitted among the Jesuits at [[Brno]] and was preparing for a Christian [[Mission (Christianity)|mission]] in [[India]]. However, the entire order was dissolved in the Czech lands in 1773 and Dobrovský thus returned to Prague to study [[theology]].

After holding for some time the office of tutor to Count [[Nostitz (family)|Nostitz]], he obtained an appointment first as vice-rector, and then as rector, in the general seminary at Hradisko (now part of [[Olomouc]]); but in 1790 he lost his post through the abolition of the seminaries throughout the [[Habsburg Empire]], and returned as a guest to the house of the count. At this time, he wrote some of the most important works in [[Slavic studies]], [[historiography]] and [[philology]].

In 1792 he was commissioned by the Bohemian Academy of Sciences to visit [[Stockholm]], [[Turku]], [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Moscow]] in search of the manuscripts which had been scattered by the [[Thirty Years' War]], and on his return he accompanied Count [[Nostitz (family)|Nostitz]] to [[Switzerland]] and [[Italy]].

In the 1780s Dobrovský participated in the academic life of [[Prague]]. In 1784, he helped to set up the [[Royal Czech Society of Sciences]], and in 1818 the [[National Museum (Prague)|National Museum]] of what was to become [[Czechoslovakia]] and eventually the [[Czech Republic]].

However, his reason began to give way in 1795, and in 1801 he had to be confined in a [[lunatic asylum]], but by 1803 he had completely recovered. The rest of his life was mainly spent either in Prague or at the country seats of his friends Counts [[Nostitz (family)|Nostitz]] and [[Czernin]], but his death occurred in [[Brno]], where he had gone in 1828 to study in the local libraries.

While his fame rests chiefly on his labours in [[Slavonic language|Slavonic philology]] his botanical studies are not without value in the history of the science.

Between 1948 and 1968 Czech poet [[Vladimír Holan]] lived in the so-called "Dobrovský House" on [[Kampa Island|Kampa]], often saying that the ''Blue [[Abbé]]'' (a nickname by which Dobrovský was known) would sometimes visit him.

==Personal life and education==
Appiah was born in [[London]], England,&lt;ref name="bio"  /&gt; to [[Peggy Cripps]], a British art historian and writer of [[English people|English]] heritage, and [[Joe Appiah|Joseph Emmanuel Appiah]], a lawyer, diplomat, and politician from the Asante region, once part of the British [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] colony but now part of Ghana. For two years (1970–72) Joe Appiah was the leader of a new opposition party that was made by the country's three opposing parties, simultaneously he was the president of the Ghana Bar Association. Between 1977 and 1978, he was Ghana's representative at the [[United Nations]].

Anthony Appiah was raised in [[Kumasi]], Ghana, and educated at [[Bryanston School]] and [[Clare College, Cambridge]], where he earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] ([[First-class honours|First Class]]) and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | degree = Ph.D. | last = Appiah | first = Kwame Akroma-Ampim Kusi Anthony | date = 1981 | title = Conditions for conditionals |publisher= [[Clare College, Cambridge]] | oclc = 52897706 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has three sisters: Isobel, Adwoa and Abena. As a child, he spent a good deal of time in England, staying with his grandmother Dame [[Isobel Cripps]], widow of the English statesman Sir [[Stafford Cripps]].

Appiah's mother's family has a long political tradition:  Sir Stafford was  a nephew of [[Beatrice Webb]] and was [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (1947–50) under [[Clement Attlee]]; his father, Charles Cripps, was Labour [[Leader of the House of Lords]] 1929–31 as [[Lord Parmoor]] in [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s government; Parmoor had been a Conservative MP before defecting to Labour. 

Through his grandmother [[Isobel Cripps]], Appiah is a descendant of [[John Winthrop]] and the [[New England]] Winthrop family as one of his ancestors, Robert Winthrop, was a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and migrated to England, becoming a distinguished Vice Admiral in the [[British Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Howard | editor-first1 = Joseph Jackson | editor-last2 = Crisp | editor-first2 = Frederick Arthur | title = Visitation of England and Wales, Volume VII | pages = 150–151 | publisher = Privately printed | location = England | year = 1899 | oclc = 786249679 }} [https://archive.org/stream/visitationofengl07howa#page/n5/mode/2up Online.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stark | first = James Henry | title = The loyalists of Massachusetts and the other side of the American Revolution | pages = 426–429 | publisher = J.H.

Through Professor Appiah's father, a [[Nana (title)|Nana]] of the [[Ashanti people]], he is a direct descendant of [[Osei Tutu]], the warrior emperor of pre-colonial Ghana, whose reigning successor, the [[Otumfuo Nana Osei Tutu II|Asantehene]], is a distant relative of the Appiah family. Also among his African ancestors is the Ashanti [[Akan Chieftaincy|nobleman]] Nana Akroma-Ampim I of Nyaduom, a warrior whose name the Professor now bears.

==Career==
[[File:Appiah.jpg|thumb|right|Kwame Anthony Appiah during a [[lecture]] and visit to [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]] in 2006.]]
Appiah taught philosophy and African-American studies at the [[University of Ghana]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] Universities from 1981 to 1988. He was, until recently, a Laurance S. Rockefeller University Professor of Philosophy at Princeton (with a cross-appointment at the University Center for Human Values) and was serving as the Bacon-Kilkenny Professor of Law at [[Fordham University]] in the fall of 2008. Appiah also served on the board of [[PEN American Center]] and was on a panel of judges for the [[PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Appiah | first = Kwame Anthony |url=http://worldvoices.pen.org/nonfiction-essay/kwame-anthony-appiah-2009-inaugural-remarks |title= 2009 Inaugural Remarks &amp;#124; PEN World voices Festival |website =worldvoices.pen.org | publisher = [[PEN American Center#PEN World Voices Festival|PEN World Voices Festival]] |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has taught at Yale, Cornell, [[Duke University|Duke]], and Harvard universities and lectured at many other institutions in the US, Germany, Ghana and South Africa, and Paris. Until the fall of 2009, he served as a trustee of [[Ashesi University College]] in [[Accra, Ghana]]. Currently, he is the professor of philosophy and law at NYU.

His Cambridge dissertation explored the foundations of probabilistic semantics. In 1992, Appiah published ''In My Father's House'', which won the [[Herskovitz Prize]] for African Studies in [[English language|English]]. Among his later books are ''Colour Conscious'' (with [[Amy Gutmann]]), ''The Ethics of Identity'' (2005), and ''Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers'' (2006). He has been a close collaborator with [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]], with whom he edited ''Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African-American Experience''. Appiah was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1995.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf | website = amacad.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (AAAS) |accessdate= April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Appiah published ''[[Experiments in Ethics]]'', in which he reviews the relevance of empirical research to ethical theory. In the same year, he was recognized for his contributions to racial, ethnic, and religious relations when [[Brandeis University]] awarded him the first ''Joseph B. and Toby Gittler Prize''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Joseph B. and Toby Gittler Prize|url=http://www.brandeis.edu/gittlerprize/recipients/past/appiah.html|publisher=Brandeis University|year=2008|accessdate=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as his academic work, Appiah has also published several works of fiction. His first novel, ''Avenging Angel'', set at the [[University of Cambridge]], involved a murder among the [[Cambridge Apostles]]; Sir Patrick Scott is the detective in the novel. Appiah's second and third novels are ''Nobody Likes Letitia'' and ''Another Death in Venice''.

Appiah has been nominated for, or received, several honours. He was the 2009 finalist in the arts and humanities for the [[Eugene R. Gannon Award for the Continued Pursuit of Human Advancement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Gannon Award | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120724071214/http://www.gannonaward.org/The_Gannon_Award/The_Award.html | archive-date = July 24, 2012 | url = http://gannonaward.org/The_Gannon_Award/The_Gannon_Group.html | website = gannonaward.org | publisher = The Gannon Award  | access-date = June 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he was named by ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' magazine on its list of top global thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothkopf |first=David |title=The FT top 100 global thinkers |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119224246/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/11/29/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers |archive-date=November 19, 2014 |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/11/29/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers |work=[[Foreign Policy|Foreign Policy Magazine]] |date=November 29, 2010 |accessdate=January 21, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 13, 2012, Appiah was awarded the [[National Humanities Medal]] at a ceremony at the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kellogg | first = Carolyn | title=Jacket copy: National medal of arts and national humanities medals announced | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2012/02/national-medals-of-arts-humanities-announced.html | work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| date = February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appiah currently chairs the jury for the [[Berggruen Prize]], and serves on the [[Berggruen Institute]]'s Philosophy &amp; Culture Center's Academic Board.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Ann M. (October 6, 2017), [http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-global-berggruen-prize-20161005-snap-story.html Canadian Charles Margrave Taylor wins inaugural Berggruen Prize for Philosophy], ''Los Angeles Times'': "Kwame Anthony Appiah, a New York University professor and philosopher who chaired this year's Berggruen Prize jury, praised the 'breadth and depth' of Taylor's intellectual contributions."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideas===
Appiah argues that the formative denotation of culture is ultimately preceded by the efficacy of intellectual interchange.{{clarify|date=April 2018}} From this position, his views on the efficacy of organizations such as [[UNICEF]] and [[Oxfam]] are notable for their duality: on the one hand he seems to appreciate the immediate action these organizations provide while on the other hand he points out the long-term futility of such intervention. His focus is, instead, on the long-term political and economic development of nations according to the Western capitalist/ democratic model, an approach that relies on continued growth in the "marketplace" that is the capital-driven modern world.

However, when capitalism is introduced and it does not "take off" as in the Western world, the livelihood of the peoples involved is at stake. Thus, the ethical questions involved are certainly complex, yet the general impression in Appiah's "Kindness to Strangers" is one which implies that it is not up to "us" to save the poor and starving, but up to their own governments. Nation-states must assume responsibility for their citizens, and a cosmopolitan's role is to appeal to "our own" government to ensure that these nation-states respect, provide for, and protect their citizens.

If they will not, "we" are obliged to change their minds; if they cannot, "we" are obliged to provide assistance, but only our "fair share," that is, not at the expense of our own comfort, or the comfort of those "nearest and dearest" to us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Appiah | first = Anthony Kwame | contribution = "Moral disagreement" and "Kindness to strangers" | editor-last = Appiah | editor-first = Anthony Kwame | title = Cosmopolitanism: ethics in a world of strangers | pages = 45–68 and 155–174 | publisher = W.W. Norton &amp; Co | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780141027814 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appiah's early philosophical work dealt with probabilistic semantics and theories of meaning, but his more recent books have tackled philosophical problems of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[racism]], identity, and moral theory. His current work tackles three major areas: 1. the philosophical foundations of liberalism; 2. the questioning of methods in arriving at knowledge about values; and 3. the connections between theory and practice in moral life, all of which concepts can also be found in his book ''Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers''.

On postmodern culture Appiah writes, "Postmodern culture is the culture in which all postmodernisms operate, sometimes in synergy, sometimes in competition; and because contemporary culture is, in a certain sense to which I shall return, transnational, postmodern culture is global{{spnd}}though that emphatically does not mean that it is the culture of every person in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Is the Post- in Postmodernism the Post- in Postcolonial? | journal = Critical Inquiry | date = Winter 2009 | first = Kwame Anthony | last = Appiah | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 336–357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cosmopolitanism====
[[File:Kwame Anthony Appiah.jpg|thumb|[[Princeton University]] [[professor]] Kwame Anthony Appiah, [[Lecture|lecturing]] at [[Syracuse University]]'s [[S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications]].]]

Appiah has been influenced by the [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitanist]] philosophical tradition, which stretches from German philosophers such as [[G. W. F. Hegel]] through [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and others. In his article "Education for Global Citizenship", Appiah outlines his conception of cosmopolitanism. He therein defines cosmopolitanism as "universality plus difference". Building from this definition, he asserts that the first takes precedence over the latter, that is: different cultures are respected "not because cultures matter in themselves, but because people matter, and culture matters to people." But Appiah first defined it as its problems but ultimately determines that practicing a citizenship of the world and conversation is not only helpful in a post-9/11 world. Therefore, according to Appiah's take on this ideology, cultural differences are to be respected in so far as they are not harmful to people and in no way conflict with our universal concern for every human's life and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Appiah | first = Kwame Anthony | title = Chapter 6: Education for global citizenship | journal = Yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Education | volume = 107 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–99 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1744-7984.2008.00133.x | date = April 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7984.2008.00133.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers'' (2006),&lt;ref&gt;Appiah, Kwame (2006). ''Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers''. {{ISBN|0-393-06155-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appiah introduces two ideas that "intertwine in the notion of cosmopolitanism" (Emerging, 69). The first is the idea that we have obligations to others that are bigger than just sharing citizenship. The second idea is that we should never take for granted the value of life and become informed of the practices and beliefs of others. Kwame Appiah frequents university campuses to speak to students. One request he makes is, "See one movie with subtitles a month.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Aguila | first = Sissi |url=http://news.fiu.edu/2010/04/kwame-appiah-discusses-%E2%80%98world-citizenship%E2%80%99-at-fiu/13443 |title=Kwame Appiah discusses 'World Citizenship' at FIU | work = FIU News  |publisher=[[Florida International University]] |date= April 23, 2010 |accessdate=January 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of Afrocentric world view===
Appiah has been a critic of contemporary theories of [[Afrocentrism]]. In his 1997 essay "Europe Upside Down: Fallacies of the New Afrocentrism," he argues that current Afrocentricism is striking for "how thoroughly at home it is in the frameworks of nineteenth century European thought," particularly as a mirror image to Eurocentric constructions of race and a preoccupation with the ancient world. Appiah also finds an irony in the conception that if the source of the West lies in [[ancient Egypt]] via [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], then "its legacy of ethnocentrism is presumably one of our moral liabilities."&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, "Europe Upside Down: Fallacies of the New Afrocentrism" in ''Perspectives on Africa'', ed. Richard Roy Grinker and Christopher B. Steiner (London: Blackwell Publishers, 1997), pp. 728–731.&lt;/ref&gt; His critique of contemporary Afrocentrism has been criticized by some of its leading proponents, such as [[Temple University]] African American Studies scholar and activist [[Molefi Asante]], who has characterized Appiah's work as "anti-African."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Asante | first= Molefi Kete | author-link = Molefi Asante |title=A quick reading of rhetorical jingoism: Anthony Appiah and his fallacies (blog) |url=http://www.asante.net/articles/11/a-quick-reading-of-rhetorical-jingoism-anthony-appiah-and-his-fallacies/ |website=asante.net | publisher = Dr. Molefi Kete Asante |date= |accessdate=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection took its title from Zola's house at [[Médan]], near [[Paris]], where writers would meet for literary dinners. The authors were often referred to collectively as the "Médan group". The aim of the collection was to promote the ideals of Naturalism, by treating the events of the Franco-Prussian War in a realistic and often unheroic way, in contrast to officially approved patriotic views of the war.

By far the most famous story in the collection is ''[[Boule de Suif]]'', which immediately launched the career of the young [[Guy de Maupassant]].

Zola's story became the basis for an [[L'attaque du moulin|opera of the same name]] by [[Alfred Bruneau]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3662">'''Letters rogatory''' or '''letters of request''' are a formal request from a [[court]] to a foreign court for some type of judicial assistance. The most common remedies sought by letters rogatory are [[service of process]] and taking of evidence.

==Taking of evidence==

Another reason why a court may require assistance from a foreign court is to obtain evidence from a witness. This evidence may be to answer questions relevant to the determination of an issue of fact, or for [[discovery (law)|disclosure]] of documents.

Courts usually have the power to [[subpoena]] witnesses only from within the jurisdiction of their own legislature unless they are aided by foreign legislative authority. For example, Alice in the [[United States]], could not summon Jean from [[France]] to the US courthouse. Instead, the US court would issue a letter rogatory to a French court, which would then examine Jean in France, and send a [[deposition (law)|deposition]] back to the requesting court.

Insofar as requests ''to'' US courts are concerned, the use of letters rogatory for requesting the taking of evidence has been replaced in large part by applications under 28 USC 1782, or [[Section 1782 Discovery]].

In many cases, the witness is willing to provide the testimony. However, the target court may compel the testimony of a witness who is unwilling to appear.

==Conventions==
In the past, letters rogatory could not usually be transmitted directly between the applicable courts, and they had to be transmitted via [[consular]] or [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] channels, which could make the whole process very slow. There have been various international conventions in regard to service of process and taking of evidence.

One of the earliest conventions to simplify the procedure of letters rogatory was the [[1905 Civil Procedure Convention]], signed at [[The Hague]]. Drafted only in [[French language|French]], it was ratified by only 22 countries. Later conventions, created after the institution of the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]], which was drafted in both [[English language|English]] and French, commanded more support.

The [[Hague Service Convention]], ratified in 1965, enabled designated authorities in each of the signatory states to transmit documents for service to each other, bypassing the diplomatic route. This convention has been ratified by 60 states, including the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], neither of which had ratified the 1905 convention. The [[Hague Evidence Convention]], ratified in 1970, formalised procedures for taking of evidence. It has been ratified by 43 states. For situations exclusively among [[Member States of the European Union]], two regulations ([[Council Regulation (EC) No. 1348/2000|1348/2000]] and [[Council Regulation (EC) No. 1206/2001|1206/2001]]) superseded the two Hague Conventions. The two regulations apply to each of the member states of the European Union with the exception of [[Denmark]],  which has [[opt-outs in the European Union|opted out]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14378">'''Liberal Arts, Inc.''' was the name of an unsuccessful corporation founded in late 1946, which intended to create a [[Great Books]]-based liberal arts college in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]]. It is notable for failing despite the involvement of four educators of stellar reputation, and an offer of an apparently generous endowment, later withdrawn under unclear circumstances.

==History==

In 1937, [[Stringfellow Barr]] and [[Scott Buchanan]] successfully established the [[Great Books]] curriculum at  [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] [[Annapolis, Maryland]], which continues to the present day. In 1946, Barr resigned the presidency of that institution "with the hearty good wishes of the board of trustees" to found a new college.

According to Glen Edward Avery{{ref|avery}}, Barr thought St. John's had grown too large and feared that its land was about to be seized by the U.S. Navy for its own academy. The first such threat had been made in 1940; St. John's was saved only by the direct intervention of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] and [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Frank Knox]]. A 1946 newspaper story says that "the college's Damocles sword again threatened to drop in 1944, by which time St. John's had lost its two greatest friends in the government." The college's board of trustees was unable to get a definite answer from Congress, then in control of Federal land-taking, on whether St. John's land would be taken, and Barr wanted to secure "a home free of the endless menace of eviction."{{ref|hannaestatebought}}

Charles A. Nelson, in ''Radical Visions,'' his biography of Barr and Buchanan{{ref|radicalvisions1}}, says they were convinced that "the navy would never accept final defeat... They were wrong, but their judgement at the time is hard to fault. No one who can recall the temper of those times will forget how powerful the navy was."

==Location==

Several sites were considered for the new college. The first choice was a site in [[New Lebanon, New York|New Lebanon, N.Y.]], occupied by the [[Darrow School]], which refused to sell.{{ref|knell}} The final choice was the estate of Dan Hanna (son of [[Mark Hanna]]) in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]].

The choice of this location may have been influenced by Scott Buchanan, who, according to Samuel Sass{{ref|lost}}, was familiar with the area, having graduated in 1912 from [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts|Pittsfield]] High School. The site, officially known as Bonny Brier Farm, already contained eighteen buildings, including an inn, a dormitory, and a boathouse located on {{convert|2500|ft|m}} of lakeshore frontage on the lake known as Stockbridge Bowl. When the project was announced in 1946, Buchanan expected the institution to be open by September 1947, indicating that "the present buildings are sufficient to answer its purposes for the opening and the number of students attending in the first year or two."{{ref|nyt1946}} The site was about a mile and a half from [[Tanglewood]], home of what was then called the Berkshire Symphonic Festival; in fact, it was the venue for that festival in 1934 and 1935, the first two years of its existence.

==Corporation launched==

The enterprise was launched with a $4.5 million endowment from [[Paul Mellon|Paul W. Mellon]], son of [[Andrew W. Mellon]]. Mellon had attended St. John's as a freshman in 1939, despite already holding degrees from [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[Clare College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and studied there until 1942 when he left to enter the Army.{{ref|paulmellon}}

A corporation was formed, named "Liberal Arts, Inc." Members of the corporation included Barr, Buchanan, famous educators [[Mark Van Doren]] of Columbia University and [[Mortimer J. Adler]] of the University of Chicago, two Pittsfield attorneys, and a legal secretary.{{ref|corporation}} Sass{{ref|lost2}} indicates that [[Robert M. Hutchins]] and [[Alexander Meiklejohn]], former president of Amherst College and another "great books" luminary, also planned to join the college. The Hanna estate was purchased and deeded to the corporation in March 1947{{ref|nyt1947}}.

The Hanna farm property was later sold in 1948 to [[Hans Maeder]] {{ref|maeder}}, who founded the [[Stockbridge School]] on the site. The school, a private school for adolescents, operated from 1949 to 1976 and was notable for being completely racially integrated from its inception.{{ref|stockbridgeschool}}. The Stockbridge School included [[Jackie Robinson]]'s son among its attendees.

==Abandonment and Controversy==

In August 1947, it was formally announced that the project was abandoned. Conflicting accounts of the circumstances subsequently  transpired.

The stated reason was "inability to secure funds for the extensive building program needed to provide an adequate physical plant." In more detail, the trustees of the Old Dominion Foundation—Mellon's fund "felt it was unwise to authorize invasion of principal for fear that the remaining endowment would be insufficient to accomplish the purpose of the gift. It was also felt that under the circumstances it would be wiser to place the endowment with an existing institution capable of housing the educational project which Old Dominion was prepared to endow. No such institution was found and it is understood that the grant will revert to the general funds of the foundation."{{ref|knell2}}

Sass{{ref|lost3}} suggests that that was not the real reason, but does not say what the real reason was:
:The published reason was that the Mellon grant of $4½ million was not sufficient to convert the existing buildings and grounds into a complex suitable for a campus. Personally, I never believed that this was the real reason. Although I came to know Scott Buchanan well, I did not pursue the matter because I was sure he did not want to talk about it. His son, Dr. Douglas Buchanan, a psychiatrist in the eastern part of the state, tells me that there was a "misunderstanding" between Paul Mellon and the board of directors.

A November 1947 article in the Springfield Republican{{ref|hannafarmsold}} says plainly that there was a conflict over politics:
:Paul Mellon of Pittsburg&lt;!--sic--&gt;, who was to have been the "angel" in the proposed new liberal-arts college... was there a few days before announcement was made that he had withdrawn his offer. It was said at the time that the political activities of an associate of Mr. Barr, annoyed Mr. Mellon and that was the reason the offer was withdrawn.

Charles A. Nelson devotes an entire chapter in ''Radical Visions''{{ref|nelson}} to the episode. He tells a complex and detailed story which does not mention any political issues and essentially agrees with the publicly stated reasons. In his view, Barr and Buchanan overreached, and believed that Mellon would agree or had agreed to a plan much more ambitious than his original intention.

Nelson makes clear the depth of Mellon's interest; this was not a casual millionaire's whim. Mellon had read a 1940 article about St. John's in [[Life Magazine]], and wrote in his autobiography that after reading the article he drove to Annapolis
:to offer financial assistance for the project, but I got so interested in it—this curriculum rooted in the medieval system of the trivium and the quadrivium—that I decided to sign on as a student.... I started in the autumn of 1940 as a mature student, being about fourteen years older than my fellow freshmen.... Mathematics proved a big problem. Purely by memorizing theorems at Choate, I had done well in plane geometry and had got a perfect score on my College Board examination, but at St. John’s the students were assigned some ten theorems a day. We were supposed to work them out to their QED solely by logic. When asked to prove one at the blackboard early in my first term, I was flabbergasted and unable to go beyond the first segment. This was highly embarrassing for a Yale and Cambridge graduate! ... I enjoyed my study of Greek language and literature, but I was very conscious of being nearer in age to the instructors than to the students, so after about six months I gave it up [to join the army].

In April 1946 Mellon wrote of an interest in "setting up an initial endowment for the St. John’s Program" but of being "deterred from action by doubts as to whether St. John’s College could keep its campus." He therefore set up the endowment but left in Barr's hands as to where the endowment should go. If St. John's was likely to lose its campus,
:it might be more in the interest of American education to find a stronger institutional vehicle to develop the educational program which you initiated at St. John’s. I am therefore placing at the disposal of the Old Dominion Foundation securities, currently producing an income of $125,000 per annum, which may be used for the purpose of developing the type of education now carried on at St. John’s College, and for other similar purposes.

The Navy issue was resolved in favor of the college, so it might have been expected that Barr would recommend using the endowment to fund the St. John's program. Instead, Barr and Buchanan decided to found a new college. Nelson notes that "The grant letter did not envision starting a new college from scratch." Yet "the speed with which the two moved from seeking an existing institution stronger than St. John’s to acquiring property for a new college seems to indicate that Barr made no significant effort to find such an institution." Nelson suggests a fundamental understanding, in which "Mellon accepted the idea of a new college in the expectation that Barr could raise the additional funds to sustain it, whereas Barr interpreted Mellon’s acceptance of the substitution as a sign that he, Mellon, would supply the necessary additional funds." In a 1947 letter, Mellon wrote:

:Dear Winkie: ...my idea (and I understood it to be yours) was that some college for undergraduates similar in size and curriculum to St. John’s should be the beneficiary of the gift. When you went to Massachusetts, it was my understanding that it was to form such a college. Through circumstances beyond your control, that project now appears unfeasible, if not impossible, within any reasonable amount of time, chiefly due to the lack of qualified teachers and adequate building funds. As an alternative, you have requested Old Dominion Foundation, through me, to release the entire benefits of the endowment fund to Liberal Arts, Inc.... for purposes which seem to me extremely vague.... Since I am extremely doubtful that the income from this endowment would in the long run be adequate to carry on whatever purpose you envisage (which I gather would involve considerable expansion of your present adult education plan), and in addition take care of a future undergraduate college, I do not feel at liberty to recommend such action to Old Dominion Foundation as being practical or consistent with our original agreement, intentions or plans. Under the circumstances, it would seem the wisest and fairest thing to do would be to abandon any plans in connection with the Stockbridge project on the grounds of the impossibility or impracticality of carrying out the original intention, that is, of providing endowment for a college for undergraduates similar in size and curriculum to St. John’s College.

| The site encompasses four monuments: [[Gračanica Monastery]], [[Our Lady of Ljeviš]] church, [[Patriarchate of Peć (monastery)|Patriarchate of Peć]] monastery, and [[Visoki Dečani]] monastery. The four edifices of the site reflect the high points of the Byzantine-Romanesque ecclesiastical culture, with its distinct style of wall painting, which developed in the Balkans between the 13th and 17th centuries. The style played a decisive role in subsequent Balkan art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/724 |title=Medieval Monuments in Kosovo – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |work=unesco.org| accessdate=14 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| The fortress is the last great creation of Serbian military construction and one of the largest fortifications in south-east Europe. It was built in order to replace Belgrade, which was handed over to the Hungarians in 1427 after the death of Stefan Lazarević. Unlike Belgrade, the new Smederevo Fortress covered a somewhat smaller defensive area, with a simpler interior arrangement. The defense system is based on the use of cold weapons, a result of adopting traditional solutions from Byzantine military architecture. The design of the fortress was influenced by the [[Walls of Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5538/ |title=Smederevo Fortress – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |work=unesco.org |accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10668">'''Lying press''' ({{lang-de|Lügenpresse|lit=press of lies}}) is a [[pejorative]] political term used largely by German political movements for the printed press and the [[mass media]] at large, when it is believed not to have the quest for [[truth]] at the heart of its coverage. It can be considered synonymous with the term [[fake news]].

==History==
The term ''Lügenpresse'' has been used intermittently since the 19th&amp;nbsp;century in political polemics in Germany, by a wide range of groups and movements in a variety of debates and conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/bild-1079049-960848.html timeline] in {{cite news |date=2016-02-24 |title=Lying Press? Germans Lose Faith in the Fourth Estate |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/most-germans-think-the-press-is-lying-to-them-about-refugees-a-1079049.html |newspaper=[[Spiegel Online]] |access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isolated uses can be traced back as far as the [[Vormärz]] period.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wiener Zeitung]]'', 2 September 1835, p. 990; ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', no. 69, 9 March 1840, p. 547&lt;/ref&gt; The term gained traction in the [[German revolutions of 1848–49|March 1848 Revolution]] when Catholic circles employed it to attack the rising, hostile liberal press. In the [[Franco-German War]] (1870–71) and particularly [[World War I]] (1914–18) German intellectuals and journalists used the term to denounce what they believed was enemy war [[propaganda]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} The {{Interlanguage link multi|Evangelischer Pressedienst|de}} made its mission the fight against the "lying press" which it considered to be the "strongest weapon of the enemy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hafenbrack |first=Hans |date=2004 |title=Geschichte des Evangelischen Pressedienstes. Evangelische Pressearbeit von 1848 bis 1981 |language=German |location=Bielefeld |publisher=Luther-Verlag |isbn=978-3-7858-0488-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, German-speaking Marxists such as [[Karl Radek]] and [[Alexander Parvus]] vilified "the [[bourgeois]] lying press" as part of their class struggle rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Hermann|authorlink=Hermann Weber|title=Die Gründung der KPD: Protokoll und Materialien des Gründungsparteitages der Kommunistischen Partei Deutschlands 1918/1919 mit einer Einführung zur angeblichen Erstveröffentlichung durch die SED|year=1993|publisher=Dietz|page=78|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Die Glocke – sozialistische Wochenschrift|year=1925|publisher=Parvus/Verlag für Sozialwissenschaft|volume=10|issue=40–52|page=1450|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nazis]] adopted the term for their propaganda against the Jewish, communist, and later the foreign press. During the [[protests of 1968]], left-wing students disparaged the liberal-conservative [[Axel Springer SE|Axel Springer publishing house]], notably its flagship daily [[Bild]], as a "lying press".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Görlich|first=Christopher|title=Die 68er in Berlin: Schauplätze und Ereignisse|year=2002|publisher=Homilius|page=309|language=German|isbn=978-3-89706-904-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pegida Banner, Lügenpresse Banner.jpg|thumb|"Lügenpresse" banner seen in a [[Pegida]] demonstration]]

In late 2014, the term was repopularised by the [[far-right politics|far-right]] political movement [[Pegida]] in response to what its protesters felt was a scornful treatment by the mainstream media, as well as biased press reporting on the rising [[European migrant crisis|migrant influx]] and other immigration issues. It was chosen to be the "[[Un-word of the year]]" for 2014 by a panel of five linguists and journalists of the ''[[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache]]'' for "wholesale defamation" of the work of the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwortdesjahres.net/fileadmin/unwort/download/pressemitteilung_unwort2014.pdf|title=Pressemitteilung: Wahl des 24. "Unworts des Jahres"|date=13 January 2015|publisher=Unwort des Jahres|language=German|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Joachim Gauck]] condemned the chanting of the slogan as "ahistorical nonsense", maintaining that in contrast to the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] and the [[East Germany|GDR]] era the [[Germany|federal German]] press is not manipulative in character and "covers events mostly in a correct and balanced way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2015-01/gauck-pegida-luegenpresse|title=Gauck kritisiert "Lügenpresse"-Begriff als geschichtsvergessen|date=22 January 2015|work=[[Die Zeit]]|language=German|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alternative for Germany]] chair [[Frauke Petry]] accused the German media of "defamatory" coverage of her party at a party congress at Hanover, but said the party executive would use the term "lying press" sparingly, preferring the milder designation "[[Pinocchio]] press".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rohbohm |first=Hinrich |date=2015-11-28 |title=Petry schwört AfD auf "harten Kampf" ein|url=https://jungefreiheit.de/politik/deutschland/2015/petry-schwoert-afd-auf-harten-kampf-ein/ |language=German |newspaper=[[Junge Freiheit]] |access-date=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her fellow party member [[Björn Höcke]] criticized ''Lügenpresse'' as too sweeping a verdict for the journalistic profession, arguing instead for the alternative, phonetically very similar term 'Lückenpresse' ("gaps press"), which would describe more accurately [[reporting bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Höcke |first=Björn |date=2016-01-07 |title=Nicht "Lügenpresse" sondern "Lückenpresse"|url=http://www.bjoern-hoecke.de/#!Nicht-L%C3%BCgenpresse-sondern-L%C3%BCckenpresse/c1gjk/568e9b430cf2a5b1e920bee3 |language=German |access-date=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German media detractors felt vindicated by the perceived lack of mainstream coverage of the 2016 [[New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany]].&lt;ref name="Politico"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/cologne-puts-germany-lying-media-press-on-defensive-migration-refugees-attacks-sex-assault-nye/|title=Cologne puts Germany's 'lying press' on defensive|last=Karnitschnig|first=Matthew|date=2016-01-25|work=[[Politico]]|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most media outlets ignored the mass assaults by [[North Africa]]n migrants and only started reporting on them five days later, after a wave of anger on [[social media]] made covering them unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20160105/brushing-sexual-assault-under-the-carpet-is-foolish|title=Silence on sex crimes will make racism worse|work=The Local|date=5 January 2016|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/12085182/Cover-up-over-Cologne-sex-assaults-blamed-on-migration-sensitivities.html|title='Cover-up' over Cologne sex assaults blamed on migration sensitivities|last=Huggler|first=Justin|date=2016-01-06|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delay in reporting on the incidents led to accusations that the authorities and the media attempted to ignore or cover up the migrant attacks to avoid criticism against the asylum and migration policy of the [[Angela Merkel|Merkel]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reports of New Year's Eve sex assaults in Cologne fuel German migrant debate|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/05/europe/germany-cologne-new-year-assaults|work=[[CNN]]|date=5 January 2016|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cover-up claim over NYE mass sexual assaults|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20160104/refugees-blamed-for-mass-sexual-assault-in-cologne|work=[[The Local]]|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former interior minister [[Hans-Peter Friedrich]] ([[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]]) criticized the media for upholding a "cartel of silence": "There's suspicion that they believe they don't have to report on such assaults, especially involving migrants and foreigners, for fear of unsettling the public."&lt;ref name="Politico"/&gt; The German press codex forbids mentioning the religion or ethnicity of criminal suspects and offenders unless there is a "factual connection" to the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presserat.de/pressekodex/pressekodex/#panel-ziffer_12____diskriminierungen|title=Der Pressekodex.

A 2015 poll by [[Infratest dimap]] found one-fifth of Germans using the term in reference to German media, including newspapers, radio and TV, while almost three-fourth do not employ the word. 42&amp;nbsp;percent have doubts about the media's credibility, whereas 52&amp;nbsp;percent believe its coverage to be reliable on the whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2015-10-31 |title=Jeder Fünfte nennt deutsche Medien "Lügenpresse" |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article148286129/Jeder-Fuenfte-nennt-deutsche-Medien-Luegenpresse.html |language=German |newspaper=[[Die Welt]] |access-date=2016-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a representative poll by the [[Allensbach Institute]] of the same year, 39&amp;nbsp;percent of adult Germans think that there is some truth to the criticism of Pegida that the mainstream press is distorting facts and concealing crucial information from the reader; in the [[new states of Germany]] this is even believed by 44 percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Köcher |first=Renate |date=2015-12-16 |title=Allensbach-Studie: Mehrheit fühlt sich über Flüchtlinge einseitig informiert |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/fluechtlingskrise/allensbach-umfrage-zu-medienberichterstattung-in-fluechtlingskrise-13967959.html?printPagedArticle=true#pageIndex_2 |language=German |newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2015 survey, by the weekly ''[[Die Zeit]]'', found that 50&amp;nbsp;percent of respondents did not trust the media coverage on the [[European migrant crisis|refugee crisis]], 56&amp;nbsp;percent not on the Pegida movement, 63&amp;nbsp;percent not on the [[European debt crisis]] and 66&amp;nbsp;percent not on the [[War in Donbass|Ukraine conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hamann |first=Götz |date=2015-06-25 |title=Wer vertraut uns noch? |url=http://www.zeit.de/2015/26/journalismus-medienkritik-luegenpresse-vertrauen-ukraine-krise/komplettansicht |language=German |newspaper=[[Die Zeit]] |access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matt Foley''' is a fictional character from the [[sketch comedy]] program ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' performed by [[Chris Farley]]. Foley is a [[motivational speaker]] who exhibits characteristics that someone in that position would not typically have: whereas motivational speakers are typically successful and charismatic, Foley is abrasive, clumsy, and down on his luck. The character was popular in its original run and went on to become one of Farley's best-known characters.

== History ==
The character's concept was first created by [[Bob Odenkirk]]. Farley had performed the character in other comedy groups before joining the cast of ''Saturday Night Live''. Farley named the character after one of his [[Marquette University]] [[rugby union]] teammates, who is now a Catholic priest in the [[Chicago]] suburb of [[Arlington Heights, Illinois|Arlington Heights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Silverberg | first=Melissa | date=August 2, 2015 | title=The real Matt Foley remembers his friend Chris Farley | publisher=''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]'' | url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20150801/news/150809920/ | access-date=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Foley appeared in eight ''Saturday Night Live'' sketches. Each sketch typically started with Foley brought into a specific situation by someone to speak to a group. In addition to his disheveled, overweight, and unstylish appearance, he exhibits poor social skills, frequently loses his temper, disparages and insults his audience, wallows in cynicism and self-pity, and presents a negative motivational message. Foley's trademark line is warning his audience that they could end up, like himself, being "35 years old, eating a steady diet of [[government cheese]], thrice divorced, and living in a '''''van''' down by the '''river'''''!" In most sketches, whenever a member of his audience announces a personal accomplishment, Foley responds with mockery or belligerence: "Well, la-dee-''frickin''-da!", "Whoop-dee-''frickin''-doo!", or a similarly dismissive remark. The sketches usually feature Farley's [[physical comedy]], such as the over-caffeinated Foley gesticulating wildly and leaping around, often breaking furniture.

In the character's debut, [[David Spade]] and [[Christina Applegate]], who were playing teens supposedly in need of Foley's help, were visibly trying to stifle their laughter. Spade, in particular, spent most of the sketch with his hand covering his face. In the sketch, Farley's portrayal of Foley was so intense that he ended up falling onto the table in front of him, crushing it. The blooper was so popular that Farley turned it into one of his best-known routines and one which he would repeat many times, both as Foley and as other characters on ''SNL'' and in film during the remainder of his life and career, sometimes injuring himself in the process.

At the end of each sketch, he is usually rushed out of his speaking location, where the people left behind huddle together and comment on him, usually bemused and frightened. Though his intended message is always ruined by his bizarre presentation, his audience typically benefits from the experience, as they all don't want to be associated with Foley again. One departure sketch had [[George Foreman]] considering that he was too old and weak to continue boxing, and happening to walk by the river, where he comes across Foley's van. Foley does not go into his usual tirades, instead ordering Foreman to do all sorts of chores for him, such as grilling hamburgers, claiming the work is "for [[dexterity]]". When Foreman determines Foley is using him, he punches Foley, causing Foreman to realize he can still fight and ultimately going on to win the world championship. Foreman then recites this tale to [[Tim Meadows]], who wonders aloud why he is cooking burgers for Foreman, only to be barked at, "You know why! For dexterity!"

Being a [[Wisconsin]] native, Farley was asked to portray the Matt Foley character at the 1994 [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] banquet.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} He delivered a comedic "motivational speech" to the [[Wisconsin Badgers football]] team, who were to face the [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA Bruins]] that year and won [[1994 Rose Bowl|the game]], 21–16.

Plans for a film version with Spade in a supporting role were shelved after Farley's death in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Borrelli | first= Christopher | date=January 30, 2015 | title=Underrated for years, Bob Odenkirk gets the call for 'Saul' | publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' | quote=Foley, I always thought there was a movie in that character. ...

==Physical appearance==
Typically the outfit of choice for Matt is a blue-and-white plaid sport coat, a white dress shirt, a solid green necktie, black [[Horn-rimmed glasses]], too-tight khakis, a wrist watch, dress shoes and has well-groomed blond hair. In prison, he dons blue jeans and a denim shirt with the inmate number "3307" while retaining his watch, glasses and a crucifix necklace (he also mentions a "homemade tattoo of a van down by the river"). While working as a mall Santa, he wears a stereotypical Santa outfit, complete with black snow boots.

==Personality==
While he is well mannered and very good-natured, he has a very violent temper, usually yelling at his audience and making a fool of himself.

He seems to have somewhat of a sense of self-pity and anger about his own poor life choices. Despite this, he has a passion for his career as a motivational speaker, going as far as to travel to [[Venezuela]] to speak to teens, or move in with teenagers to watch over them after they were caught with a bag of pot (although this was partially because he got tired of living in his van down by the river). While in prison, he seems to be respected, and to have a good friendship with his cellmate Deshawn Powers, who refers to Foley as "The OG of cell block C".

He is fond of coffee and caffeine-based products. In almost every appearance, he mentions drinking [[espresso]] or coffee, or taking [[NoDoz]] and he even brings a duffel bag with a pot of coffee to the gym to teach a spinning class.

He also seems to be a strong believer in "PMA" (Positive Mental Attitude).

== Notable appearances ==
The character's debut performance (May 8, 1993) has been called one of the best segments in ''SNL'' history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=February 3, 2014 | title=50 Greatest 'Saturday Night Live' Sketches of All Time | publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]'' | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/pictures/50-greatest-saturday-night-live-sketches-of-all-time-20140203/matt-foley-motivational-speaker-0010123 | access-date=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reception of the audience combined with visible stifled laughter from the performers on stage added to the popularity of the sketch. Notable physical gestures from Farley included what Spade referred to as “the thing with the glasses” when Farley lifted his glasses on and off of his face commenting, “Hey Dad, I can’t see real good, is that [[William Shakespeare|Bill Shakespeare]] over there?” and perhaps the most defining gesture was one that Farley saved for the live performance when he alternated hands adjusting his trousers, grabbing the hilt of his belt with one hand and the back of his pants with the other. In the sketch itself, Foley attempts to motivate two teens, played by David Spade and Christina Applegate, to get themselves “back on the right track” after the family’s cleaning lady finds a bag of marijuana in their dresser. Foley’s attempt to motivate them falls short when he constantly reminds them that the only thing they will ever amount to is “living in a van down by the river!” The sketch ends with Foley offering that the only solution to solve the family's problems is for him to move in with them; he leaves the house to get his things from his van and the family locks him out, finally reconciling and admitting to how much they love each other.

A later performance (February 19, 1994) features Foley in prison attempting to motivate troubled teens in a scared straight program; he was imprisoned for three to five years for non-payment of alimony (consistent with him being “thrice divorced”). Before entering the sketch, Foley is introduced by his cellmate Deshawn Powers ([[Martin Lawrence]]) as “just finished a week in solitary, eating nothing but coffee beans.” Foley attempts to scare the juvenile delinquents by commenting in a slightly different manner that he “wished to dear God, that he was living in a van down by the river!” The sketch followed the usual Foley routine with him falling through the prison wall instead of a coffee table, which eventually led to his and the other inmates' escape.

In the only [[cold open]] featuring Foley (April 15, 1995), the character attempts to motivate a pair of Venezuelan teens. Foley attempts to get through to them by motivating them in their native Spanish, saying “¡Yo vivo en van circa de un rio!” However the teenagers father ([[Michael McKean]]) informs Matt that he and his children are fluent in English causing Foley to response "¡Padre, dame un favor, y cállate su grande YAPPER!" The sketch again features Foley mocking his audience, breaking household objects, and somehow succeeding in his motivational goals.

A '''megalith''' is a large [[Rock (geology)|stone]] that has been used to construct a structure or monument, either alone or together with other stones. The word '''''megalithic''''' describes structures made of such large stones without the use of mortar or concrete, representing periods of [[prehistory]] characterised by such constructions. For later periods, the word ''[[monolith]]'', with an overlapping meaning, is more likely to be used.

The word ''megalith'' comes from the [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|μέγας}}'' ([[transliteration]] ''mégas'', meaning "great") and ''{{lang|grc|λίθος}}'' (transliteration ''líthos'' meaning "stone"). ''Megalith'' also denotes one or more rocks hewn in definite shapes for special purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Early stone complexes in eastern Turkey==
[[File:Göbekli_Tepe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.10|Göbekli Tepe]]
At a number of sites in eastern Turkey, large ceremonial complexes from the [[9th millennium BC]] have been discovered.&lt;ref name="ArchMag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/0811/abstracts/turkey.html| title=The World's First Temple| work= Archaeology magazine |date=Nov–Dec 2008 | page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They belong to the incipient phases of [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]]. Large circular structures involving carved megalithic [[orthostat]]s are a typical feature; e.g. at [[Nevalı Çori]] and [[Göbekli Tepe]]. Although these structures are the most ancient megalithic structures known so far, it is not clear that any of the European Megalithic traditions (see below) are actually derived from them.&lt;ref&gt;Mithen, S. (2003), ''After the Ice - A Global Human History, 21,000-5,000 BC'', London, 62-71&lt;/ref&gt; At Göbekli Tepe, four stone circles have been excavated from an estimated 20. Some measure up to 30 metres across. As well as human figures, the stones carry a variety of carved reliefs depicting boars, foxes, lions, birds, snakes and scorpions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/apr/23/archaeology.turkey|title=7,000 years older than Stonehenge: the site that stunned archaeologists|first=Nicholas|last=Birch|date=22 April 2008|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Eastern megaliths==
[[File:Atlit-Yam, Ritual structure made of stones, restoration.JPG|thumb|upright=1.10|Megalithic structure at [[Atlit Yam]], Israel]]
[[Dolmens]] and standing stones have been found in large areas of the Middle East starting at the [[Turkey|Turkish]] border in the north of [[Syria]] close to [[Aleppo]], southwards down to [[Yemen]]. They can be encountered in [[Lebanon]], Syria, [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], and [[Saudi Arabia]]. The largest concentration can be found in southern Syria and along the [[Jordan Rift Valley]], however they are being threatened with destruction. They date from the late Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age.&lt;ref&gt;Scheltema, H.G. (2008). ''Megalithic Jordan; an introduction and field guide''. Amman, Jordan: The American Center of Oriental Research.&lt;/ref&gt;  Megaliths have also been found on [[Kharg Island]] and [[pirazmian]] in [[Iran]], at [[Barda Balka]] in [[Iraq]]. [[File:Smeisani, Amman, Jordan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.10|Standing stone in [[Amman]], Jordan.]]
A semicircular arrangement of megaliths was found in Israel at [[Atlit Yam]], a site that is now under the sea. It is a very early example, dating from the [[7th millennium BC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427361.400-atlityam-israel.html|title=Atlit-Yam, Israel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most concentrated occurrence of dolmens in particular is in a large area on both sides of the [[Jordan Rift Valley]], with greater predominance on the eastern side. They occur first and foremost on the [[Golan Heights]], the [[Hauran]], and in Jordan, which probably has the largest concentration of dolmen in the Middle East. In Saudi Arabia, only very few dolmen have been identified so far in the [[Hejaz]]. They seem, however, to re-emerge in Yemen in small numbers, and thus could indicate a continuous tradition related to those of [[Somalia]] and [[Ethiopia]].

The standing stone has a very ancient tradition in the Middle East, dating back from [[Mesopotamia]]n times. Although not always 'megalithic' in the true sense, they occur throughout the [[Orient]], and can reach 5 metres or more in some cases (such as [[Al Karak|Ader]] in Jordan). This phenomenon can also be traced through many passages from the [[Old Testament]], such as those related to [[Jacob]], the grandson of [[Abraham]], who poured oil over a stone that he erected after his famous dream in which angels climbed to heaven (Genesis 28:10-22). Jacob is also described as putting up stones at other occasions, whereas [[Moses]] erected twelve pillars symbolizing the tribes of Israel. The tradition of venerating (standing) stones continued in [[Nabatean]] times and is reflected in, e.g., the Islamic rituals surrounding the [[Kaaba]] and nearby pillars.
Related phenomena, such as cupholes, rock-cut tombs and circles also occur in the Middle East.

==European megaliths==
[[File:Triangle megalith, Fondachelli Fantina Sicily,.JPG|thumb|Triangle megalith of Valle Levante, [[Fondachelli-Fantina]], Sicily]]
The most common type of megalithic construction in Europe is the [[portal tomb]] – a chamber consisting of upright stones ([[orthostat]]s) with one or more large flat capstones forming a roof. Many of these, though by no means all, contain human remains, but it is debatable whether use as burial sites was their primary function. The megalithic structures of [[Malta]] are believed to be the oldest in Europe, in particular [[Skorba Temples]]. Though generally known as ''dolmens'', the term most accepted by archaeologists is ''portal tomb''. However many local names exist, such as ''anta'' in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and Portugal, ''stazzone'' in [[Sardinia]], ''hunebed'' in the Netherlands, ''Hünengrab'' in Germany, ''dysse'' in Denmark, and ''cromlech'' in [[Wales]]. It is assumed that most portal tombs were originally covered by earthen mounds.

The second-most-common tomb type is the [[passage grave]]. It normally consists of a square, circular, or cruciform chamber with a slabbed or [[corbelling|corbelled]] roof, accessed by a long, straight passageway, with the whole structure covered by a circular mound of earth. Sometimes it is also surrounded by an external stone kerb. Prominent examples include the sites of [[Bru na Boinne|Brú na Bóinne]] and [[Carrowmore]] in Ireland, [[Maes Howe]] in [[Orkney]], and [[Gavrinis]] in France.
[[File:paulnabrone.jpg|left|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Poulnabrone dolmen|Poulnabrone portal tomb]], Ireland]]
The third tomb type is a diverse group known as [[gallery grave]]s. These are axially arranged chambers placed under elongated mounds. The Irish [[court tomb]]s, British [[long barrow]]s, and German ''Steinkisten'' belong to this group.

Another type of megalithic monument, the single standing stone, or [[menhir]] as it is known in France, is very common throughout Europe, where some 50,000 examples have been noted. Some of these are thought to have an astronomical function as a marker or foresight. In some areas, long and complex alignments of such stones exist, the largest known example being located at [[Carnac]] in [[Brittany]], France.

In parts of Britain and Ireland a relatively common type of megalithic construction is the [[stone circle]], of which examples include [[Stonehenge]], [[Avebury]], [[Ring of Brodgar]] and [[Beltany stone circle|Beltany]]. These, too, display evidence of astronomical alignments, both solar and lunar. Stonehenge, for example, is famous for its [[solstice]] alignment. Examples of stone circles are also found in the rest of Europe. The circle at [[Lough Gur]], near Limerick in Ireland has been dated to the Beaker period, approximately contemporaneous with Stonehenge. The stone circles are assumed to be of later date than the tombs, straddling the [[Neolithic]] and the [[Bronze Age]]s.

===Tombs===
[[File:hunebed-d27.jpg|thumb|Large T shaped ''Hunebed'' D27 in [[Borger-Odoorn]], Netherlands.]]
'''Megalithic tombs''' are aboveground burial chambers, built of large stone slabs (megaliths) laid on edge and covered with earth or other, smaller stones. They are a type of [[chamber tomb]], and the term is used to describe the structures built across [[Atlantic Europe]], the Mediterranean, and neighbouring regions, mostly during the [[Neolithic]] period, by Neolithic farming communities. They differ from the contemporary [[long barrow]]s through their structural use of stone.

There is a huge variety of megalithic tombs. The free-standing single chamber [[dolmen]]s and [[portal dolmen]]s found in [[Brittany]], Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden, [[Wales]], and elsewhere consist of a large flat stone supported by three, four, or more standing stones. They were covered by a stone [[cairn]] or earth [[tumulus|barrow]].
[[File:Construcción megalito.png|thumb|upright=0.8|Construction of a megalith grave]]
[[File:Dolmenmontebubbonia.jpg|right|thumb|Dolmen of Monte Bubbonia ([[Sicily]])]]
In Italy, dolmens can be found especially in [[Sardinia]]. There are more than 100 dolmen dating to the Neolithic (3500–2700 BC) and the most famous is called ''Dolmen di Sa Coveccada'' (near [[Mores]] ). During the [[Bronze Age]], the [[Nuragic civilization]] built c. 800 [[Giants' grave]], a type of megalithic [[gallery grave]] that can be found throughout [[Sardinia]] with different structures.  The earliest megalithic tombs in Sardinia are the circular graves of the so-called [[Arzachena culture]], also found in [[Corsica]], [[southern France]] and eastern Spain.

Dolmen are also in Apulia and in Sicily. In this latter region, they are small structures located in Mura Pregne ''([[Palermo]])'', Sciacca ''([[Agrigento]])'', Monte Bubbonia ''([[Province of Caltanissetta|Caltanissetta]])'', Butera ''(Caltanissetta)'', Cava Lazzaro ''([[Syracuse, Sicily|Siracusa]])'', Cava dei Servi ''([[Ragusa, Italy|Ragusa]])'', Avola ''(Siracusa)'', [[Argimusco]] in [[Montalbano Elicona]] ([[Messina]]). Dating to the early Bronze Age (2200–1800 BC), the prehistoric Sicilian buildings were covered by a circular mound of earth. In the dolmen of ''Cava dei Servi'', the archaeologists found numerous human bone fragments and some splinters of Castelluccian ceramics ''(Early Bronze Age)'' which confirmed the burial purpose of the artefact.&lt;ref&gt;Salvatore Piccolo, ''op. cit.'', pp. 14-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Megalito Aquila, Altopiano dell'Argimusco (ME).JPG|thumb|Eagle, one of the Megaliths of [[Argimusco]], [[Sicily]]]]

Examples with outer areas, not used for burial, are also known.  The [[Court Cairn]]s of southwest [[Scotland]] and northern Ireland, the [[Severn-Cotswold tomb]]s of southwest England and the [[Transepted gallery grave]]s of the [[Loire]] region in France share many internal features, although the links between them are not yet fully understood. That they often have antechambers or forecourts is thought to imply a desire on the part of the builders to emphasize a special [[ritual]] or physical separation of the dead from the living.
[[File:Tumulus Saint-Michel (2).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Saint-Michel tumulus]], megalith grave in [[Brittany]]]]

The [[Passage grave]]s of [[Orkney]], Ireland's [[River Boyne|Boyne]] Valley, and north Wales are even more complex and impressive, with cross-shaped arrangements of chambers and passages. The workmanship on the stone blocks at [[Maeshowe]] for example is unknown elsewhere in northwest Europe at the time.

Megalithic tombs appear to have been used by communities for the long-term deposition of the remains of their dead, and some seem to have undergone alteration and enlargement. The organization and effort required to erect these large stones suggest that the societies concerned placed great emphasis on the proper treatment of their dead. The [[ritual]] significance of the tombs is supported by the presence of [[Pre-historic art|megalithic art]] carved into the stones at some sites. Hearths and deposits of pottery and animal bone found by archaeologists around some tombs also implies that some form of burial feast or sacrificial rites took place there.

Further examples of megalithic tombs include the stalled cairn at [[Midhowe Chambered Cairn|Midhowe]] in Orkney and the passage grave at [[Bryn Celli Ddu]] on [[Anglesey]]. There are also extensive grave sites with up to 60 megaliths at [[Louisenlund (Bornholm)|Louisenlund]] and [[Gryet]] on the Danish island of [[Bornholm]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europage.dk/bornholm/luisenlund/index.htm "Louisenlund tæt ved Østermarie på Bornholm"], Europage.dk. {{da icon}} Retrieved 14 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite its name, the [[Stone Tomb]] in [[Ukraine]] was not a tomb but rather a sanctuary.

===Other structures===
[[File:Annotated.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Cup and ring marks]], in England]]
In association with the megalithic constructions across Europe, there are often large [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] of various designs – ditches and banks (like the [[Dorset Cursus]]), broad terraces, circular enclosures known as [[henges]], and frequently artificial mounds such as [[Silbury Hill]] in England and [[Sassari|Monte d'Accoddi]] in [[Sardinia]] (the prehistoric step pyramid) .
A lot of spirals are found through of Sardinia: the best known is ''Perda Pinta'' of [[Mamoiada]].

It seems that spirals were an important motif for the megalith builders (see [[Megalithic Temples of Malta]]). They have been found carved into megalithic structures all over Europe, along with other symbols such as lozenges, eye-patterns, zigzags in various configurations, and [[cup and ring mark]]s. While not a written script in the modern sense of the term, these symbols are considered to have conveyed meaning to their creators, and are remarkably consistent across the whole of Europe.

===Spread of megalithic architecture in Europe===
[[File:Nurage1rp.jpg|thumb|Nurage in Sardinia]]
In Europe megaliths are, in general, constructions erected during the [[Neolithic]] or late stone age and [[Chalcolithic]] or Copper Age (4500–1500 BC). The megalithic structures of [[Malta]] are believed to be the oldest in Europe. Perhaps the most famous megalithic structure is [[Stonehenge]] in England. 
In Sardinia, in addition to dolmens, menhirs and circular graves there are also more than 8000 megalithic structure made by a Nuragic civilisation, called [[Nuraghe]]: buildings similar to towers (sometimes with really complex structures) made using only rocks. They are often near [[giants' grave|giant's grave]] or the other megalithic monuments.
[[File:Tumulus de Kercado 2005 02.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Tumulus]] of Kercado, near Carnac. Smaller but older structure in the area. (Part of the [[Cairn]] is visible)]]
The French [[Comte de Caylus]] was the first to describe the [[Carnac stones]]. [[Pierre Jean-Baptiste Legrand d'Aussy]] introduced the terms ''[[menhir]]'' and ''[[dolmen]]'', both taken from the [[Breton language]], into antiquarian terminology. He mistakenly interpreted megaliths as gallic tombs. In Britain, the [[antiquarian]]s [[John Aubrey|Aubrey]] and [[William Stukeley|Stukeley]] conducted early research into megaliths. In 1805, [[Jacques Cambry]] published a book called ''Monuments celtiques, ou recherches sur le culte des Pierres, précédées d'une notice sur les Celtes et sur les Druides, et suivies d'Etymologie celtiques'', where he proposed a [[Celt]]ic stone cult. This unproven connection between [[druids]] and megaliths has haunted the public imagination ever since.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In Belgium, there are the [[Wéris megaliths]] at Wéris, a little town situated in the [[Ardennes]]. In the Netherlands, megalithic structures can be found in the northeast of the country, mostly in the province of [[Drenthe]]. [[Knowth]] is a [[passage grave]] of the [[Brú na Bóinne]] neolithic complex in Ireland, dating from c. 3500–3000 BC. It contains more than a third of the total number of examples of [[megalithic art]] in all Europe, with over 200 decorated stones found during excavations.

Additionally, [[Tiya (archaeological site)|Tiya]] in central [[Ethiopia]] has a number old megaliths. Some of these ancient structures feature engravings, and the area is a World Heritage Site. Megaliths are also found within the Valley of Marvels in the East Hararghe area.

==Asian megaliths==
[[File:Gochang Dolmen Sites - 3.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Northern-style megalithic burial from Jukrim-ri, Gochang-eub, [[North Jeolla Province]], [[Korea]].]]
Megalithic burials are found in Northeast and Southeast Asia. They are found mainly in the [[Korean Peninsula]]. They are also found in the [[Liaoning]], [[Shandong]], and [[Zhejiang]] in China, the East Coast of [[Taiwan]], [[Kyūshū]] and [[Shikoku]] in Japan, [[Đồng Nai Province]] in [[Vietnam]] and [[South Asia]]. Some living megalithic traditions are found on the island of [[Sumba]] and [[Nias]] in [[Indonesia]]. The greatest concentration of megalithic burials is in Korea. Archaeologists estimate that there are 15,000 to 100,000 southern megaliths in the Korean Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Goindol [Megalith] in ''Hanguk Gogohak Sajeon'' [Dictionary of Korean Archaeology], National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage (ed.) NRICH, Seoul. {{ISBN|89-5508-025-5}} pp. 72-75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rhee | first1 = Song-nai | last2 = Choi | first2 = Mong-lyong | year = 1992 | title = Emergence of Complex Society in Prehistoric Korea | url = | journal = Journal of World Prehistory | volume = 6 | issue = 1| page = 68 | doi=10.1007/bf00997585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical estimates hover around the 30,000 mark for the entire peninsula, which in itself constitutes some 40% of all dolmens worldwide (see [[Dolmen#Asia|Dolmen]]).

===East Asia===

====Northern style====
Northeast Asian megalithic traditions originated in [[northeast China]], in particular the [[Liao River]] basin.&lt;ref&gt;Rhee and Choi (1992): 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Sarah M. (1999) "Megalithic Monuments and the Introduction of Rice into Korea" in ''The Prehistory of Food: Appetites for Change''.  C. Gosden and J. Hather (eds.) Routledge, London. pp.147–165&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of erecting megalithic burials spread quickly from the Liao River Basin and into the Korean Peninsula, where the structure of megaliths is geographically and chronologically distinct. The earliest megalithic burials are called "northern" or "table-style" because they feature an above-ground burial chamber formed by heavy stone slabs that form a rectangular cist.&lt;ref name="Rhee and Choi 1992: 68"&gt;Rhee and Choi (1992): 68&lt;/ref&gt; An oversized capstone is placed over the stone slab burial chamber, giving the appearance of a table-top. These megalithic burials date to the early part of the [[Mumun pottery period]] (c. 1500–850 BC) and are distributed, with a few exceptions, north of the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]]. Few northern-style megaliths in northeast China contain [[grave goods]] such as [[Liaoning bronze dagger culture|Liaoning bronze daggers]], prompting some archaeologists to interpret the burials as the graves of chiefs or preeminent individuals.&lt;ref name="Nelson 1999"&gt;Nelson (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; However, whether a result of grave-robbery or intentional mortuary behaviour, most northern megaliths contain no grave goods.

====Southern style====
Southern-style megalithic burials are distributed in the southern [[Korean Peninsula]]. It is thought that most of them date to the latter part of the Early Mumun or to the Middle Mumun Period.&lt;ref name="Rhee and Choi 1992: 68"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelson 1999"/&gt; Southern-style megaliths are typically smaller in scale than northern megaliths. The interment area of southern megaliths has an underground burial chamber made of earth or lined with thin stone slabs. A massive capstone is placed over the interment area and is supported by smaller propping stones. Most of the megalithic burials on the [[Korean Peninsula]] are of the southern type.
[[File:Orim-dongmegalithpetroglyph.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.55|Representations of a dagger (right) and two human figures, one of which is kneeling (left), carved into the capstone of Megalithic Burial No. 5, Orim-dong, [[Yeosu]], Korea.]]

As with northern megaliths, southern examples contain few, if any, artifacts. However, a small number of megalithic burials contain fine red-burnished pottery, bronze daggers, polished groundstone daggers, and greenstone ornaments. Southern megalithic burials are often found in groups, spread out in lines that are parallel with the direction of streams. Megalithic cemeteries contain burials that are linked together by low stone platforms made from large river cobbles. Broken red-burnished pottery and charred wood found on these platforms has led archaeologists to hypothesize that these platform were sometimes used for ceremonies and rituals.&lt;ref&gt;GARI [Gyeongnam Archaeological Research Institute] (2002) ''Jinju Daepyeong Okbang 1 - 9 Jigu Mumun Sidae Jibrak'' [The Mumun Period Settlement at Localities 1 - 9, Okbang in Daepyeong, Jinju]. GARI, Jinju.&lt;/ref&gt; The capstones of many southern megaliths have 'cup-marks' carvings. A small number of capstones have human and dagger representations.

====Capstone style====
These megaliths are distinguished from other types by the presence of a burial shaft, sometimes up to 4 m in depth, which is lined with large cobbles.&lt;ref name="Bale"&gt;Bale, Martin T. "[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~ekp/resources/studies/bale-yulha-ri.html Excavations of Large-scale Megalithic Burials at Yulha-ri, Gimhae-si, Gyeongsang Nam-do]" in ''Early Korea Project''. Korea Institute, Harvard University. Retrieved 10 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A large capstone is placed over the burial shaft without propping stones. Capstone-style megaliths are the most monumental type in the [[Korean Peninsula]], and they are primarily distributed near or on the south coast of Korea. It seems that most of these burials date to the latter part of the Middle Mumun (c. 700–550 BC), and they may have been built into the early part of the Late Mumun. An example is found near modern [[Changwon]] at Deokcheon-ni, where a small cemetery contained a capstone burial (No. 1) with a massive, rectangularly shaped, stone and earthen platform. Archaeologists were not able to recover the entire feature, but the low platform was at least 56×18 m in size.

The [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesian archipelago]] is the host of [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] megalith cultures both past and present. Living megalith cultures can be found on [[Nias]], an isolated island off the western coast of [[North Sumatra]], the [[Batak]] people in the interior of North Sumatra, on [[Sumba]] island in [[East Nusa Tenggara]] and also [[Toraja]] people from the interior of [[South Sulawesi]]. These megalith cultures remained preserved, isolated and undisturbed well into the late 19th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Several megalith sites and structures are also found across Indonesia. Menhirs, dolmens, stone tables, ancestral stone statues, and [[step pyramid]] structure called ''Punden Berundak'' were discovered in various sites in [[Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Sulawesi]], and the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]].

The case-example is that of Brahmagiri, which was excavated by Wheeler (1975) and helped establish the culture sequence in south Indian prehistory. However, there is another distinct class of megaliths that do not seem to be associated with burials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=N.Vahia, M.

In South Asia, megaliths of all kinds are noted; these vary from Menhirs, Rock-cut burial, chamber tomb, dolmens, stone alignment, stone circles and anthropomorphic figures.{{sfn|N.Vahia, M. Menon, Abbas, Yadav|p.4}} These are broadly classified into two (potentially overlapping) classes (after Moorti, 1994, 2008): ''Sepulchral'' (containing remains of the dead), or memorial stones where mortal remains along with funerary objects are placed; and ''Non-sepulchral'' including large patterned placement of stones over a wide area. The 'non-sepulchral' type is associated with astronomy and cosmology in South Asia and in other parts of the world (Menon and Vahia, 2010).{{sfn|N.Vahia, M. Menon, Abbas, Yadav|p.3-4}}

In the context of prehistoric anthropomorphic figures in India, (Rao 1988/1999, Upinder Singh 2008) note that it is unclear what these giant anthropomorphs symbolize. They usually occur in association with megalithic monuments and are located in megalithic burial grounds, and may have been connected with ancestor worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Upinder|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India|date=2008|publisher=Pearson Education|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-317-1120-0|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=K.P|title=Megalithic Anthropomorphic Statues: Meaning and Significance|url=http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/BIPPA/article/viewFile/11729/10358|website=http://journals.lib.washington.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Melanesian megaliths==
Megaliths occur in many parts of [[Melanesia]], mainly in [[Milne Bay Province]], [[Fiji]] and [[Vanuatu]]. Few excavations has been made and little is known about the structures.
The megalith tomb Otuyam at [[Kiriwina]] has been dated to be approximately 2,000 years old which indicates that megaliths are an old custom in Melanesia. However very few megaliths have been dated. The constructions have been used for different rituals. For example, tombs, sacrifices and rituals of fecundity. Dance sites exist next to some megaliths. In some places in Melanesia rituals are continued to be held at the sacred megalith sites. The fact that the beliefs are alive is a reason that most excavations have been stopped at the sites.

==Micronesian megaliths==
Megalithic structures in Micronesia reach their most developed form on the islands of [[Pohnpei]] and [[Kosrae]] in the Eastern Caroline Islands. On these two islands there was extensive use of prismatic basalt columns to build upland building complexes such as those at Salapwuk on Pohnpei and Menka on Kosrae.  These building sites, remote from the ocean, appear to have been abandoned early.  Megalithic building then shifted to constructing networks of artificial islands on the coast that supported a multitude of common, royal and religious structures.  Dating of the structures is difficult but the complex at [[Nan Madol]] on Pohpei was probably inhabited as early as 800 c.a. probably as an artificial islands with the more elaborate buildings and religious structures added to the site from 1000–1400 AD.

Nan Madol almost certainly served as the economic, government and religious site for a centralized monarchy which is historically named the 'Saudeleurs'.  By legend the Saudeleurs were from elsewhere, possibly in the south or west but no specific origin has ever been established.  Nan Madol lost prominence and was later abandoned after the overthrow of the [[Saudeleur dynasty]].  The oral history suggests this overthrow was by a group of warriors from Kosrae. 
The megalithic site at Lelu on the island of Kosrae, based on dating studies and oral history, rose to prominence about 1400 AD corresponding roughly with the fall of Nan Madol and endured for the next three hundred years or so.  It was largely abandoned by the time of European contact.

The architecture at these Micronesian sites is characteristic and has little in common with other megalithic sites. Prismatic basalt columns were brought from a great distance to the artificial islands and the rock was stacked in a layers of stretchers and runners filled in the center with coral debris.  This structure allowed creation of walls up to 10 meters in height with great durability.  The presence of step pyramids in the south western corner of Nan Madol as well as in Lelu suggests some Melanesian influence but other structures such as the royal residence, the religious structures and common areas as well as the elaborate interconnecting system of canals has no parallel elsewhere in the Pacific region.

==Modern theories==
Megaliths were used for a variety of purposes ranging from serving as boundary markers of territory, to a reminder of past events, and to being part of the society's religion.&lt;ref&gt;d'Alviella, Goblet, et al. (1892) pp.22-23&lt;/ref&gt; Common motifs including crooks and axes seem to be symbols of political power, much as the crook was a symbol of Egyptian pharaohs. Amongst the [[indigenous peoples]] of India, [[Malaysia]], [[Polynesia]], North Africa, North America, and South America, the worship of these stones, or the use of these stones to symbolize a spirit or deity, is a possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Goblet, et al. (1892) p.23&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century, some scholars believed that all megaliths belonged to one global "Megalithic culture"&lt;ref&gt;Gaillard, Gérald (2004) ''The Routledge Dictionary of Anthropologists''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-22825-5}}, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; ([[hyperdiffusionism]], e. g. ‘the Manchester school’,&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster Brown, P. (1976) p.267&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] and [[William James Perry]]), but this has long been disproved by modern dating methods.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Nor is it believed any longer that there was a pan-European megalithic culture, although regional cultures existed, even within such a small areas as the British Isles.  The archaeologist Euan Mackie wrote "Likewise it cannot be doubted that important regional cultures existed in the Neolithic period and can be defined by different kinds of stone circles and local pottery styles (Ruggles &amp; Barclay 2000: figure 1). No-one has ever been rash enough to claim a nationwide unity of all aspects of Neolithic archaeology!"&lt;ref&gt;Mackoe, Euan W, "The structure and skills of British Neolithic Society: a brief response to Clive Ruggles &amp; Gordon Barclay. (Response)", ''Antiquity'' September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of megalithic structure ===
The types of megalithic structure can be divided into two categories, the "polylithic type" and the "monolithic type."&lt;ref&gt;Keane, A. H. (1896) p.124&lt;/ref&gt; Different megalithic structures include:

{|width=85% cellspacing=3 style="border: 1px; margin-bottom: 3px;"
|cellspacing=3 cellpadding=3 valign="top"|
;Polylithic type
* [[Dolmen]]: a free-standing chamber, consisting of standing stones covered by a capstone as a lid. Dolmens were used for burial and were covered by mounds.
** [[Great dolmen]]s
** [[Rectangular dolmen]]s
** [[Simple dolmen]]s
** [[Polygonal dolmen]]s
* [[Taula]]: a straight standing stone, topped with another forming a 'T' shape.
* [[Cistvaen]]s
* [[Unchambered long barrow]]s
* [[Guardian stones]]
* [[Passage grave]]
* [[Tumuli]] or barrows
* [[Punden]] or Punden Berundak: step earth and stone pyramid, similar to tumuli but reinforced with stone walls.

For its first three seasons, the show was hosted by [[Petros Papadakis]]. In the last two seasons, it was co-hosted by [[Michael Strahan]] and [[Jay Glazer]]. The first two seasons were filmed at [[Carson, California]]'s [[Home Depot Center]], which was referenced in aerial shots. Repeats can currently be seen on the [[El Rey Network]].

The format now featured eight "Joes" in the opening round that tests them in a contest that will eliminate two of the Joes from contest.  Those six remaining Joes were then ranked from one through six with the top seed taking on number six, number two against number five and number three against number four in a home sport of one of the pros, with the top two seeds choosing from the three pros.  The winners advance to overtime, but now includes a bench where the Joes change from one uniform into another.  Again the fastest among the three advanced to the finals.

'''Public opinion''' consists of the desires, wants, and thinking of the majority of the people; it is the collective opinion of the people of a society or state on an issue or problem.

This [[concept]] came about through the process of [[urbanization]] and other political and social forces. For the first time, it became important what people thought, as forms of political contention changed.

==Etymology==
The term ''public opinion'' was derived from the French ''opinion publique'' which was first used in 1588 by [[Michel de Montaigne]] in the second edition of his ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'' (ch. XXII).&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Braatz, ''Friedrich Nietzsche: Eine Studie zur Theorie der Öffentlichen Meinung'', Walter de Gruyter, 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French term also appears in the 1761 work ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]'' by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;The term ''opinion publique'' appears in the chapter: "Lettre XXIV à Julie" of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Speier&gt;Hans Speier, "Historical Development of Public Opinion", ''American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 55, No. 4 (Jan., 1950), pp. 376–388. {{doi|10.1086/220561}}. {{jstor|2772299}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Precursors of the phrase in English include [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]]'s "general opinion" (appearing in his 1672 work ''On the Original and Nature of Government'') and [[John Locke]]'s "law of opinion" (appearing in his 1689 work ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'').&lt;ref name=Speier/&gt;

==History==
The emergence of public opinion as a significant force in the political realm can be dated to the late 17th century. However, opinion had been regarded as having singular importance since far earlier. Medieval ''fama publica'' or ''vox et fama communis'' had great legal and social importance from the 12th and 13th centuries onward.&lt;ref&gt;See {{fr}} [http://books.openedition.org/pur/15839?lang=fr Julien Théry, "''Fama'' : l'opinion publique comme preuve judiciaire. Aperçu sur la révolution médiévale de l'inquisitoire (XIIe-XIVe s.)", in B. Lemesle (ed.), ''La preuve en justice de l'Antiquité à nos jours'', Rennes, PUR, 2003, pp. 119–147, available online], and Daniel Smail, Thelma Fernster (ed), Fama. ''The Politics of Talk and Reputation'', Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[William Shakespeare]] called public opinion the 'mistress of success' and [[Blaise Pascal]] thought it was 'the queen of the world.'

[[John Locke]] in his treatise ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' considered that man was subject to three laws: the [[divine law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and most importantly in Locke's judgement, the law of [[opinion]] or [[reputation]]. He regarded the latter as of the highest importance because dislike and ''ill opinion'' force people to conform in their behaviour to social norms, however he didn't consider public opinion as a suitable influence for governments.

[[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]] in his essay of 1672, ''On the Original and Nature of Government'' gave an early formulation of the importance of public opinion. He observed that "...when vast numbers of men submit their lives and fortunes absolutely to the will of one, it...must be force of custom, or opinion...which subjects power to authority."

Temple disagreed with the prevalent opinion that the basis of government lay in a [[social contract]] and thought that government was merely allowed to exist due to the favour of public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Historical Development of Public Opinion|last=Speier|first=Hans|journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|issn=1537-5390|volume=55|issue=4|year=1950|pages=376–88|jstor=2772299|registration=y|doi=10.1086/220561|url=http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Analisi/article/download/15081/189532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prerequisites for the emergence of a public sphere were increasing levels of literacy which was spurred on by the [[Reformation]], which encouraged individuals to read the [[Bible]] in the vernacular, and the rapidly expanding printing presses. During the 18th century religious literature was replaced with secular literature, novels and pamphlets. In parallel to this was the growth in reading societies and clubs. At the turn of the century the first circulating library opened in London and the [[public library]] became widespread and available to the public.

===Coffee-houses===
[[File:17th century coffeehouse england 1-580x400.jpg|thumb|right|Coffeehouse in [[London]], 17th century]]
An institution of central importance in the development of public opinion, was the [[coffee-house]], which became widespread throughout Europe in the mid-17th century. Although [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] later tried to suppress the London coffeehouses as "places where the disaffected met, and spread scandalous reports concerning the conduct of His Majesty and his Ministers", the public flocked to them. For several decades following the Restoration, the [[Wit]]s gathered round [[John Dryden]] at [[Will's Coffee House]], in Russell Street, Covent Garden.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gk8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22places%20where%20the%20disaffected%20met%2C%20and%20spread%20scandalous%20reports%20concerning%20the%20conduct%20of%20His%20Majesty%20and%20his%20Ministers%22&amp;pg=PA531#v=onepage&amp;q=%22places%20where%20the%20disaffected%20met,%20and%20spread%20scandalous%20reports%20concerning%20the%20conduct%20of%20His%20Majesty%20and%20his%20Ministers%22&amp;f=false An historical and chronological deduction of the origin of commerce, from the earliest accounts. : Containing an history of the great commercial interests of the British Empire.

Author:	Adam Anderson; William Combe; John Walter; Logographic Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; The coffee houses were great social levellers, open to all men and indifferent to social status, and as a result associated with equality and republicanism.

More generally, coffee houses became meeting places where business could be carried on, news exchanged and ''[[The London Gazette]]'' (government announcements) read. [[Lloyd's of London]] had its origins in a coffeehouse run by [[Edward Lloyd (coffeehouse owner)|Edward Lloyd]], where underwriters of ship insurance met to do business. By 1739, there were 551 coffeehouses in London; each attracted a particular clientele divided by occupation or attitude, such as [[Tory|Tories]] and [[Whig (British political faction)|Whigs]], wits and [[stockjobber]]s, merchants and lawyers, booksellers and authors, men of fashion or the "cits" of the [[City of London|old city center]]. [[Joseph Addison]] wanted to have it said of him that he had "brought philosophy out of closets and libraries to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea tables and in coffee houses." According to one French visitor, [[Antoine François Prévost]], coffeehouses, "where you have the right to read all the papers for and against the government," were the "seats of English liberty."&lt;ref&gt;Prévost, Abbé (1930) ''Adventures of a man of quality'' (translation of ''Séjour en Angleterre'', v. 5 of ''Mémoires et avantures d'un homme de qualité qui s'est retiré du monde'') G. Routledge &amp; Sons, London, {{OCLC|396693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gentleman clubs===
[[File:Joseph Highmore - A Club of Gentlemen - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''A Club of Gentlemen'' by [[Joseph Highmore]] c. 1730.]]
[[Gentlemen's club]]s proliferated in the 18th century, especially in the [[West End of London]]. Clubs took over the role occupied by coffee houses in 18th century London to some degree, and reached the height of their influence in the late 19th century – some notable names were [[White's]], [[Brooks's]], [[Arthur's]], and [[Boodle's]] which still exist today.

These social changes, in which a closed and largely illiterate public became an open and politicized one, was to become of tremendous political importance in the 19th century as the mass media was circulated ever more widely and literacy was steadily improved. Governments increasingly recognized the importance of [[propaganda|managing and directing public opinion]]. This trend is exemplified in the career of [[George Canning]] who restyled his political career from its aristocratic origins to one of popular consent when he contested and won the parliamentary seat in [[Liverpool]]; a city with a growing and affluent middle class, which he attributed to the growing influence of "public opinion."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Lee, "George Canning and Liberal Toryism, 1801–1827" Woodbridge: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeremy Bentham]] was an impassioned advocate of the importance of public opinion in the shaping of constitutional governance. He thought it important that all government acts and decisions should be subject to the inspection of public opinion, because "to the pernicious exercise of the power of government it is the only check."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482436/public-opinion/258764/Public-opinion-and-government|title=public opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opined that public opinion had the power to ensure that rulers would rule for the greatest happiness of the greater number. He brought in [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian philosophy]] in order to define theories of public opinion.

==Concepts==

The German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], by using the conceptional tools of his theory of [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]], argued (''Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung'', 1922), that 'public opinion' has the equivalent [[social function]] in societies (''Gesellschaften'') which [[religion]] has in communities (''Gemeinschaften'').&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Fechner/[[Lars Clausen]]/Arno Bammé (eds.): ''Öffentliche Meinung zwischen neuer Religion und neuer Wissenschaft. Ferdinand Tönnies' "Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung" in der internationalen Diskussion'', in: ''Tönnies im Gespräch'', tom. 3, Munich/Vienna: Profil 2005, {{ISBN|3-89019-590-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

German social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]] contributed the idea of "[[Public sphere]]" to the discussion of public opinion. The Public Sphere, or bourgeois public, is according to Habermas, where "something approaching public opinion can be formed" (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;351). Habermas claimed that the Public Sphere featured universal access, rational debate, and disregard for rank. However, he believes that these three features for how public opinion are best formed are no longer in place in western [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] countries. Public opinion, in western democracy, is highly susceptible to elite manipulation.

The American sociologist [[Herbert Blumer]] has proposed an altogether different conception of the "public". According to Blumer, public opinion is discussed as a form of [[collective behavior]] (another specialized term) which is made up of those who are discussing a given public issue at any one time. Given this definition, there are many publics; each of them comes into being when an issue arises and ceases to exist when the issue is resolved. Blumer claims that people participate in public in different capacities and to different degrees. So, public opinion polling cannot measure the public. An educated individual's participation is more important than that of a drunk. The "mass", in which people independently make decisions about, for example, which brand of toothpaste to buy, is a form of collective behavior different from the public.

Public opinion plays an important role in the political sphere. Cutting across all aspects of relationship between government and public opinion are studies of voting behavior. These have registered the distribution of opinions on a wide variety of issues, have explored the impact of special interest groups on election outcomes and have contributed to our knowledge about the effects of government propaganda and policy.

Contemporary, quantitative approaches to the study of public opinion may be divided into 4 categories:
# quantitative measurement of opinion distributions;
# investigation of the internal relationships among the individual opinions that make up public opinion on an issue;
# description or analysis of the public role of public opinion;
# study both of the communication media that disseminate the ideas on which opinions are based and of the uses that propagandists and other manipulators make of these media.

The rapid spread of public opinion measurement around the world is reflection of the number of uses to which it can be put. Public opinion can be accurately obtained through [[survey sampling]]. Both private firms and governments use [[opinion poll|surveys]] to inform public policies and public relations.

==Formation==
Numerous theories and substantial evidence exists to explain the formation and dynamics of individuals' opinions. Much of this research draws on psychological research on [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]]. In [[communications studies]] and [[political science]], [[mass media]] are often seen as influential forces on public opinion. Additionally, [[political socialization]] and [[behavioral genetics]] sometimes explain public opinion.

===Mass media effects===
The formation of public opinion starts with [[Agenda-setting theory|agenda setting]] by major media outlets throughout the world. This agenda setting dictates what is newsworthy and how and when it will be reported. The media agenda is set by a variety of different environmental and newswork factors that determines which stories will be newsworthy.

Another key component in the formation of public opinion is [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]]. Framing is when a story or piece of news is portrayed in a particular way and is meant to sway the consumers attitude one way or the other. Most political issues are heavily framed in order to persuade voters to vote for a particular candidate. For example, if Candidate X once voted on a bill that raised income taxes on the middle class, a framing headline would read "Candidate X Doesn't Care About the Middle Class". This puts Candidate X in a negative frame to the news reader.

[[Social desirability]] is another key component to the formation of public opinion. Social desirability is the idea that people in general will form their opinions based on what they believe is the prevalent opinion of the social group they identify with. Based on media agenda setting and media framing, most often a particular opinion gets repeated throughout various news mediums and [[social network]]ing sites, until it creates a false vision where the perceived truth can actually be very far away from the actual truth.

Public opinion can be influenced by [[public relations]] and the [[political media]]. Additionally, [[mass media]] utilizes a wide variety of [[advertising]] techniques to get their message out and change the minds of people. Since the 1950s, [[television]] has been the main [[mass media|medium]] for molding public opinion.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p53"&gt;Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of influentials==
{{see also|Two-step flow of communication}}
There have been a variety of academic studies investigating whether or not public opinion is influenced by "[[Social influence|influentials]]," or persons that have a significant effect on influencing opinion of the general public regarding any relevant issues.  Many early studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elihu Katz and Paul Felix Lazarsfeld|title=Personal Influence: the Part Played by People in the Flow of Mass Communications|year=1955|isbn=1-4128-0507-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazarsfeld et al., 1968&lt;/ref&gt; have modeled the transfer of information from [[mass media]] sources to the general public as a "two-step" process.  In this process, information from mass media and other far-reaching sources of information influences influentials, and influentials then influence the general public as opposed to the mass media directly influencing the public.

While the "two-step" process regarding public opinion influence has motivated further research on the role of influential persons, a more recent study by Watts and Dodds (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Watts, D.J. and P.S. Dodds|year=2007|title=Influentials, Networks, and Public Opinion Formation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=34|issue=4|pages=441–458|url=https://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/research/papers/others/2007/watts2007a.pdf|doi=10.1086/518527}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that while influentials play some role in influencing public opinion, "non-influential" persons that make up the general public are also just as likely (if not more likely) to influence opinion provided that the general public is composed of persons that are easily influenced.  This is referred to in their work as the "Influential Hypothesis."  The authors discuss such results by using a model to quantify the number of people influenced by both the general public and influentials.  The model can be easily customized to represent a variety of ways that influencers interact with each other as well as the general public.  In their study, such a model diverges from the prior paradigm of the "two-step" process.  The Watts and Dodds model introduces a model of influence emphasizing lateral channels of influence between the influencers and general public categories.  This thus leads to a more complex flow of influence amongst the three parties involved in influencing public opinion (i.e., media, influencers and general public).

==Relationship with public policy==
The most pervasive issue dividing theories of the opinion-policy relation bears a striking resemblance to the problem of [[monism]]-[[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] in the history of philosophy. The controversy deals with the question of whether the structure of [[socio-political]] action should be viewed as a more or less centralized process of acts and decisions by a class of key leaders, representing integrated hierarchies of influence in society or whether it is more accurately envisaged as several sets of relatively autonomous opinion and influence groups, interacting with representative [[decision maker]]s in an official structure of differentiated [[governmental authority]]. The former assumption interprets individual, group and official action as part of a single system and reduces politics and governmental policies to a derivative of three basic analytical terms: society, culture and [[personality]].

Despite philosophical arguments regarding public opinion, social scientists (those in [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[economics]] and [[social psychology]]) present compelling theories to describe how public opinion shapes public policy and find myriad effects of opinion on policy using various empirical research methods. Moreover, researchers find that causal relationships likely run in both directions from opinion to policy and from policy to opinion. On the one hand, public opinion signals public preferences and potential voting behaviors to policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierson|first1=Paul|title=Coping with Permanent Austerity: Welfare State Restructuring in Affluent Democracies|journal=Revue Française de Sociologie|date=2002|volume=43|issue=2|pages=369–406|jstor=3322510|doi=10.2307/3322510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Soroka|first1=Stuart|last2=Wlezien|first2=Christopher|title=Degrees of Democracy: Politics, Public Opinion and Policy|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; This impact should be greater under more stable democratic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Papadakis|first1=Elim|title=Public Opinion, Public Policy and the Welfare State|journal=Political Studies|date=1992|volume=40|issue=1|pages=21–37|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1992.tb01758.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be greatest in the realm of social policy because the public are highly motivated by potential goods and services they get from the state. On the other hand, social policy impacts public opinion. The goods and services the public gets via social policy builds normative expectations that shape public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mau|first1=Steffen|title=Welfare Regimes and the Norms of Social Exchange|journal=Current Sociology|date=2004|volume=52|issue=1|pages=53–74|doi=10.1177/0011392104039314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Oorschot|first1=Wim|title=Culture and Social Policy: A Developing Field of Study|journal=International Journal of Social Welfare|date=2007|volume=16|issue=2|pages=129–139|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2397.2006.00451.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plus, social policy constitutes the largest share of state spending budgets, making it an active and contentious political area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Expenditures Database|url=https://www.oecd.org/social/expenditure.htm|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together these theories suggest that causal effects are part of a feedback loop between opinion and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Andrea Louise|title=Policy Makes Mass Politics|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=2012|volume=15|issue=1|pages=333–351|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-012610-135202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wlezien|first1=Christopher|last2=Soroka|first2=Stuart|title=Relationships between Public Opinion and Policy|journal=Oxford Handbook of Political Behavior|date=2007|pages=799–817|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199270125.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199270125-e-043?mediaType=Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=Robert|title=Public Opinion and American Democracy|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|date=2011|volume=75|issue=5|pages=982–1017|doi=10.1093/poq/nfr053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using increasingly sophisticated methods, scholars are beginning to grasp and identify the feedback of opinion and policy and use this phenomenon to explain the path dependency of institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breznau|first1=Nate|title=Positive Returns and Equilibrium: Simultaneous Feedback Between Public Opinion and Social Policy|journal=Policy Studies Journal|date=14 July 2016|doi=10.1111/psj.12171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wlezien|first1=Christopher|title=The Public as Thermostat: Dynamics of Preferences for Spending|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=1995|volume=39|issue=4|pages=981–1000|jstor=2111666|doi=10.2307/2111666}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierson|first1=Paul|title=Increasing Returns, Path Dependence, and the Study of Politics|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=2000|volume=94|issue=2|pages=251–267|jstor=2586011|doi=10.2307/2586011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with foreign policy==
As with public policy, public opinion also has a close relationship with [[foreign policy]]. There is much debate concerning what the relationship is, and the study of foreign policy's relationship with public opinion has evolved over time, with the Almond-Lippmann Consensus being one of the first attempt to define this relationship. Published before the Vietnam War, Almond and Lippmann argued that public opinion about foreign policy was unstructured, incoherent, and highly volatile, and that public opinion shouldn't influence foreign policy.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Holsti, Ole R. "Public Opinion and Foreign Policy: Challenges to the Almond-Lippmann Consensus Mershon Series: Research Programs and Debates." International Studies Quarterly, vol. 36, no. 4, 1992, pp. 439–466. {{jstor|2600734}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies have rebuked the Almond-Lippmann Consensus, showing how people's opinions are generally stable, and that while individuals may not be entirely informed about every issue, they still act efficiently and rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew A. Baum and Philip B. K. Potter, "The Relationships Between Mass Media, Public Opinion, and Foreign Policy: Toward a Theoretical Synthesis," ''Annual Review of Political Science'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

People’s judgments about issues are often based on heuristics, which are mental shortcuts that allow rational decisions to be made quickly. [[Heuristics]] apply to public opinion about domestic as well as foreign policy. The deductive heuristic is one that relies on a person's core values and social groups. Delegative heuristics are influenced by figures of authority such as the media or president.&lt;ref&gt;Sniderman, Paul. Reasoning and Choice. ''Explorations in Political Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key theory about how people form their opinions on foreign policy issues is Hurwitz and Peffley's hierarchical attitudes model. They argue that it is structured, with core values providing the basis for postures which further influence the ultimate issue position.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwitz, Jon, and Mark Peffley. "How Are Foreign Policy Attitudes Structured? A Hierarchical Model." The American Political Science Review, vol. 81, no. 4, 1987, pp. 1099–1120. {{jstor|1962580}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public opinion about foreign policy is measured in the same way that all public opinion is measured. Through [[Opinion poll|polls]] and surveys, respondents are asked about their issue positions. Conclusions are drawn by researchers by applying the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/methods-101-random-sampling/ pewresearch.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with U.S. Presidency==
According to Robert Shapiro, public opinion and policy-making are fundamental to a democracy, which is linked to electoral accountability, meaning that the leader who was elected "will not deviate far from voters’ opinion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A problem that arises when analyzing the data collected by researchers is how these issues that are "important" are selected when collecting the data about public opinion. It is hard to determine if there has been underdevelopment of certain issues. Another concern is how elites influence public opinion by persuasion and rhetoric, ultimately shaping policy-making. These two variables are ambiguous by nature and are hard to get to any conclusions, in most cases beyond the limits of research. Other variables to look at when analyzing the opinion-policy effect are the size of the majority public, election cycle time, degree of electoral competition, and the type of issue. For example, domestic affairs public opinion will be of greater importance than that of foreign affairs, because of the complexity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=Robert|date=2011|title=Public Opinion and American Democracy|url=https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/75/5/982/1826441|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=75|issue=5|pages=982–1017|doi=10.1093/poq/nfr053|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since presidents have the ability to influence their political agenda, it is easier for them to respond to public opinion. Also, since they are not an institution (like Congress) they can "shift the standards by which the public evaluates their performance in office – away from policy concerns and towards more symbolic activities, image, and personality."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A study by James N. Druckman and Lawrence R. Jacobs discusses how presidents collect their information for policymaking. They found that on one hand, they collect data about the public's preference on salient matters like crime and economy. This reflects a populist type of democracy where the government portrays respect toward the people's views and they are connected. On the other hand, government institutions and elites believe the general populations’ understanding of certain issued is limited, therefore they exercise autonomy when making these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Druckman|first1=J.N.|date=2009|title=Presidential Responsiveness to public opinion|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238859.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199238859-e-8|journal=The Oxford Handbook of American Presidency|volume=|page=454|pages=|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238859.003.0008|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Baum and Kernell have stated that a challenge that modern presidents face when trying to persuade public opinion is that there is so many different types of media, that getting people's attention is hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baum and Kernell|first1=M.A., S|title=Has Cable Ended the Golden Age of Presidential Television?|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=93|pages=99–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; New media alternatives has also caused on effect on Presidential leadership as they now use them to be able to communicate younger generations, but targeting small groups of people.

It has also been described as a musical genre that came out of [[indie rock]], with the punk scene serving as an inspiration for a musical movement in which women could express themselves in the same way men had been doing for the past several years.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Leonard.

Riot grrrl bands often address issues such as [[rape]], [[domestic abuse]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[racism]], [[patriarchy]], and female [[empowerment]]. Primary bands associated with the movement include [[Bikini Kill]], [[Bratmobile]], [[Heavens to Betsy]], [[Excuse 17]], [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]], [[Skinned Teen]], [[Emily's Sassy Lime]] and [[Sleater-Kinney]], as well as [[queercore]] groups like [[Team Dresch]] and [[The Third Sex (band)|The Third Sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hot-topic.org/node/13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223012118/http://www.hot-topic.org/node/13|archivedate=February 23, 2009|title=List of Riot Girl Bands |publisher=Hot-topic.org |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zqSn0jMJAQC&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=Dickless%20riot&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q=Dickless&amp;f=false|author=Marisa Meltzer|page=42|title=Girl Power: The Nineties Revolution in Music|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9781429933285|date=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a [[Indie music scenes|music scene]] and [[genre]], riot grrrl is a subculture involving a [[DIY ethic]], [[zine]]s, art, political action, and activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = W.W.

==Origins==

During the late 1970s and early and mid-1980s there were a number of groundbreaking female [[punk music|punk]] and [[rock music|rock]] musicians who later influenced the riot grrrl ethos. These included [[Siouxsie Sioux]], [[Poly Styrene]], [[The Slits]], [[Au Pairs (band)|Au Pairs]], [[The Raincoats]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Chrissie Hynde]], [[The Runaways]]/[[Joan Jett]], [[The B-52's]], [[LiLiPUT]], [[Lydia Lunch]], [[Exene Cervenka]], [[Kim Gordon]], [[Ut (band)|Ut]], [[Neo Boys]], [[Bush Tetras]], [[Y Pants]], [[ESG (band)|ESG]], [[Chalk Circle (American band)|Chalk Circle]], [[Fifth Column (band)|Fifth Column]], [[Frightwig]], [[X-Ray Spex]], [[Scrawl]], and [[Anti-Scrunti Faction]].&lt;ref name="Rabin" /&gt; The 1980s also featured a number of female [[folk singer]]s from New York whose lyrics were realistic and socio-political, but also personally intimate.&lt;ref name="Rabin"&gt;R. Sabin, ''Punk Rock: So What?: The Cultural Legacy of Punk'', (Routledge, 1999), {{ISBN|0415170303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-1980s in [[Vancouver]] the influential [[Mecca Normal]] fronted by poet [[Jean Smith]] formed, followed by Sugar Baby Doll in San Francisco whose members would all wind up in hardcore female bands.&lt;ref name="Donnell" /&gt; In 1987, the magazine ''[[Sassy (magazine)|Sassy]]'' premiered and dealt with tough subjects that conventional magazines aimed at teenage girls did not.&lt;ref name="Donnell" /&gt; An article "Women, sex and rock and roll" published by ''Puncture, edited by Katherine Spielmann,'' in 1989 became the first [[manifesto]] of the movement.&lt;ref name="Donnell"&gt;E. McDonnell, ''Rock She Wrote'' (Cooper Square Press, 1999), {{ISBN|0815410182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, a radio program hosted by [[Lois Maffeo]] entitled ''Your Dream Girl'' aimed at angry young women debuted on [[Olympia, Washington]] radio station [[KAOS (FM)|KAOS]].&lt;ref name="Donnell" /&gt;

During the early 1990s the [[Seattle]]/[[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] Washington area had a sophisticated [[do it yourself]] infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Rabin" /&gt; Young women involved in [[underground music]] scenes took advantage of this to articulate their feminist thoughts and desires through creating punk-rock [[fanzines]] and forming [[garage band]]s. The political model of [[collage]]-based, [[photocopied]] [[handbill]]s and booklets was already used by the [[Punk subculture|punk movement]] as a way to activate underground music, [[leftist]] politics and alternative (to mainstream) sub-cultures. There was a discomfort among many women in the punk movement who felt that they had no space for organizing, because of the misogyny in the punk culture. Many women found that while they identified with a larger, music-oriented subculture, they often had little to no voice in their local scenes. Women at the punk-rock shows saw themselves as girlfriends of the boys, so they took it upon themselves to represent their own interests by making their own fanzines, music and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Jessica|last2=Garofalo|first2=Gitana|title=Riot Grrrl: Revolutions from Within|url=http://xerxes.calstate.edu/fullerton/articles/record?id=FETCH-LOGICAL-c2461-ed3d32db9732bc240071d00840bace5d4a76b6d2a5f9e623a77376ea96f07c5e3|publisher=Signs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, young women coalesced in an unorganized collective response to several women's issues, such as the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]]'s [[Right to Life]] attack on legal abortion and the Senate Judiciary Hearings into [[Anita Hill]]'s accusations of sexual harassment by Supreme Court Justice [[Clarence Thomas]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Girls to the Front|last = Marcus|first = Sara|publisher = Harper|year = 2010|isbn = 9780061806360|location = |page = 146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young feminist voices were heard through multiple protests, actions, and events such as the formative opening night of the [[International Pop Underground Convention]]&lt;ref name="Girls to the Front"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Sara|title=Girls to the Front: The true story of the riot grrrl revolution|date=2010|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780061806360|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[L7 (band)|L7]]'s [[Rock for Choice]].

Uses and meanings of the term "riot grrrl" developed slowly over time, but its etymological origins can be traced to the actual [[Washington, D.C. riot of 1991|Mount Pleasant race riots]] in spring 1991. Bratmobile member [[Jen Smith]] (later of Rastro! and The Quails), used the phrase "girl riot" in a letter to [[Allison Wolfe]] describing the atmosphere among women in the city.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation's Capital|last = Andersen|first = Mark|publisher = Soft Skull Press|year = 2001|isbn = 1887128492|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, Wolfe and [[Molly Neuman]] collaborated with [[Kathleen Hanna]] and [[Tobi Vail]] to create a new zine and called it ''Riot Grrrl'', combining the "riot" with an oft-used phrase that first appeared in Vail's fanzine ''Jigsaw'' "Revolution Grrrl Style Now".&lt;ref name=amBk&gt;{{cite news

===Bikini Kill===

{{main article|Bikini Kill}}
Kathleen Hanna had been studying at [[The Evergreen State College]] in Olympia. She participated in a small collective [[art gallery]] called Reko Muse, which would frequently host bands like [[The Go Team]] and [[Some Velvet Sidewalk]] to play in between art exhibitions (partially just to keep the gallery running). Hanna started a band, Amy Carter (named after [[Amy Carter|the daughter of]] the [[US President]] [[Jimmy Carter]]), with fellow gallery-founders Heidi Arbogast and [[Tammy Rae Carland]].  After touring with some other projects like [[Viva Knievel (band)|Viva Knievel]], she hooked up with [[The Go Team]] drummer and [[zinester]] Tobi Vail, who had been writing of her own experiences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I feel completely left out of the realm of everything that is so important to me.  And I know that this is partly because punk rock is for and by boys mostly and partly because punk rock of this generation is coming of age in a time of mindless career-goal bands.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They started working together on another fanzine called ''Bikini Kill'', which, after recruiting friends [[Kathi Wilcox]] and [[Billy Karren|Billy "Boredom" Karren]], would eventually become a band.&lt;ref name=amBk/&gt;&lt;ref name=KRSbk&gt;{{cite news

===Bratmobile===

{{main article|Bratmobile}}
[[File:Allison Wolfe, Anna Oxygen &amp; Jen Smith 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Allison Wolfe]], [[Anna Oxygen]] and [[Jen Smith]] at a 2011 conference]]
Allison Wolfe met Molly Neuman at the [[University of Oregon]]. Wolfe introduced Neuman to bands such as [[Beat Happening]] and [[The Melvins]], Neuman introduced Wolfe to sociology classes and [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]].

They began working on zines called ''[[Girl Germs]]'', and later ''riot grrrl'' with Tobi Vail, Kathleen Hanna and Jen Smith.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was a really [[hippie]] town, and we were getting really politicized, but also really into this DIY thing, so we kinda started creating. 'Let's make our own fanzine!'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raha|first=Maria|title=Cinderella's Big Score: Women of the Punk and Indie Underground|year=2004|publisher=Seal Press|location=Emeryville, CA|isbn=978-1-58005-116-3|author2=Gordon, Kim }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wolfe and Neuman started frequenting shows by bands like [[Fugazi]] and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. In 1990, [[Calvin Johnson (musician)|Calvin Johnson]] called them up and asked them to play a show on [[Valentine's Day]] with Some Velvet Sidewalk and the newly formed Bikini Kill. They accepted it as a dare and played the show at Olympia's North Shore Surf club. Guitarist Erin Smith joined in March 1991.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===International Pop Underground Convention===
From August 20 – 25, 1991, [[K Records]] held an indie music festival called the [[International Pop Underground Convention]]. A promotional poster reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As the corporate ogre expands its creeping influence on the minds of industrialized youth, the time has come for the International Rockers of the World to convene in celebration of our grand independence.  Hangman [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]]s, new [[mod (subculture)|mod]] rockers, sidestreet walkers, [[scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]]-mounted dream girls, punks, [[teddy boy|ted]]s, the instigators of the Love Rock Explosion, the editors of every angry grrrl zine, the plotters of youth rebellion in every form, the midwestern librarians and Scottish [[ski]] instructors who live by night, all are setting aside August 20–25, 1991 as the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Love Rock Revolution: K Records and the rise of independent music|last = Baumgarten|first = Mark|publisher = Sasquatch Books|year = 2012|isbn = 1570618224|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An all-female bill on the first night, called "Love Rock Revolution Girl Style Now!" signalled a major step in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The day the music didn't die|url = http://www.seattleweekly.com/2001-08-08/music/the-day-the-music-didn-t-die/|accessdate = 2015-05-30|last = Nelson|first = Chris|publisher = Seattle Weekly|date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sells Like Teen Spirit: Music, Youth Culture, and Social Crisis|last = Moore|first = Ryan|publisher = NYU Press|year = 2009|isbn = 9780814796030|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lineup featured Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, [[Nikki McClure]], [[Lois Maffeo]], Jean Smith of Mecca Normal, [[7 Year Bitch]], and two [[side project]]s of Kathleen Hanna: the first was Suture with [[Sharon Cheslow]] of Chalk Circle (DC's first [[all-women band|all-women]] punk band) and Dug E. Bird of [[beefeater (band)|Beefeater]], the second was the Wondertwins with Tim Green of [[Nation of Ulysses]].  It was here that so many [[zinester]] people who'd only known each other from networking, mail, or talking on the phone, finally met and were brought together by an entire night of music dedicated to, for, and by women.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The convention featured other bands such as [[Unwound]], [[L7 (band)|L7]], [[The Fastbacks]], [[The Spinanes]], [[Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet]], [[Girl Trouble (band)|Girl Trouble]], [[The Pastels]], Kicking Giant, [[Rose Melberg]], [[seaweed (band)|Seaweed]], Kreviss, I Scream Truck, [[Scrawl]], [[Nation of Ulysses]], [[Jad Fair]], [[Thee Headcoats]], and [[Steve Fisk]], and spoken-word artist [[Juliana Luecking]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Decline and later developments ===
By the mid-nineties, riot grrrl had severely splintered.  Many within the movement felt that the mainstream media had completely misrepresented their message, and that the politically radical aspects of riot grrrl had been subverted by the likes of the [[Spice Girls]] and their "[[girl power]]" message, or co-opted by ostensibly women-centered bands (though sometimes with only one female performer per band) and festivals like [[Lilith Fair]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Of the original riot grrrl bands, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy and Huggy Bear had split in 1994, Excuse 17 and most of the UK bands had split by 1995, and Bikini Kill and Emily’s Sassy Lime released their last records in 1996. However, Team Dresch were active as late as 1998, [[The Gossip]] were active from 1999, Bratmobile reformed in 2000 and, perhaps most prolific of all, Sleater-Kinney were active - initially - from 1994 to 2006, releasing 7 albums.

Many of the women involved in riot grrrl are still active in creating politically charged music. Kathleen Hanna went on to found the electro-feminist [[post-punk]] "protest [[pop music|pop]]" group [[Le Tigre]] and later [[The Julie Ruin]], Kathi Wilcox joined The Casual Dots with [[Christina Billotte]] of Slant 6, and Tobi Vail formed Spider and the Webs. Corin Tucker of Heavens to Betsy and [[Carrie Brownstein]] of Excuse 17 co-founded Sleater-Kinney at the tail end of the original movement, and reformed the band again in 2014 after an 8-year hiatus, while Bratmobile reunited to release two albums, before Allison Wolfe began singing with other all-women bands, Cold Cold Hearts, and [[Partyline]]. Molly Neuman went on to play with New York punk band Love Or Perish and run her own indie label called Simple Social Graces Discos, as well as co-owning [[Lookout! Records]] and managing [[The Donnas]], [[Ted Leo]], [[Some Girls (band)|Some Girls]], and [[The Locust]]. [[Kaia Wilson]] of Team Dresch and [[multimedia artist]] Tammy Rae Carland went on to form the now-defunct [[Mr. Lady Records]] which released albums by [[The Butchies]], The Need, [[Kiki and Herb]], and [[Tracy + the Plastics]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Feminism and riot grrrl culture==
Riot grrrl culture is often associated with [[third wave feminism|third wave feminism]], which also grew rapidly during the same early nineties timeframe. The movement of third-wave feminism focused less on laws and the political process and more on individual identity. The movement of third-wave feminism is said to have arisen out of the realization that women are of many colors, ethnicities, nationalities, religions and cultural backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://beingfeministblog.wordpress.com/2013/05/16/todays-feminism-a-brief-look-at-third-wave-feminism/|title = Today's Feminism: A Brief Look at Third-Wave Feminism." Being Feminist|date = 16 May 2013|accessdate = 6 Dec 2015|website = |publisher = Wordpress|last = Fisher|first = J.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The riot grrrl movement allowed women their own space to create music and make political statements about the issues they were facing in the punk rock community and in society. They used their music and publications to express their views on issues such as patriarchy, double standards against women, rape, [[domestic abuse]], [[human sexuality|sexuality]], and female [[empowerment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schilt|first1=Kristen|title=The History of Riot Grrls in Music|url=http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/music/The-History-of-Riot-Grrls-in-Music.html|publisher=The Feminist eZine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An undated, typewritten Bikini Kill tour flier answers the question "What is Riot grrrl?" with: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[Riot Grrrl is ...] Because we girls want to create mediums that speak to US.  We are tired of boy band after boy band, boy zine after boy zine, boy punk after boy punk after boy... Because we need to talk to each other. Communication and inclusion are key.  We will never know if we don't break the code of silence... Because in every form of media we see ourselves slapped, decapitated, laughed at, objectified, raped, trivialized, pushed, ignored, stereotyped, kicked, scorned, molested, silenced, invalidated, knifed, shot, choked and killed. Because a safe space needs to be created for girls where we can open our eyes and reach out to each other without being threatened by this sexist society and our day to day bullshit."&lt;ref name="Darms" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Like other third wave feminists, riot grrrls attempted to foster an acceptance of diversity within feminist expression. That relationship to feminism is evident through their use of lyrics, zines and publications, and taking back the meaning of derogatory terms.  All three of these forms were claimed to be a source of empowerment for women in the movement.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The riot grrrl movement encouraged women to develop their own place in a male-dominated punk scene. Punk shows had come to be understood as places where "women could make their way to the front of the crowd into the [[mosh pit]], but had to 'fight ten times harder' because they were female, and sexually charged violence such as groping and rape had been reported."&lt;ref name="Belzer"&gt;{{cite web|last = Belzer|first = Hillary|title = Words + Guitar: The Riot Grrrl Movement and Third-Wave Feminism|url = http://www8.georgetown.edu/cct/thesis/HillaryBelzer.pdf|work = Communication, Culture &amp; Technology Program|publisher = Georgetown University|accessdate = December 6, 2012|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121215065347/http://www8.georgetown.edu/cct/thesis/HillaryBelzer.pdf|archivedate = December 15, 2012|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, riot grrrl bands would often actively invite members of the audience to talk about their personal experiences with sensitive issues such as sexual abuse, pass out lyric sheets to everyone in the audience, and often demand that the mosh boys move to the back or side to allow space in front for the girls in the audience.&lt;ref name=amBk/&gt; The bands weren't always enthusiastically received at shows by male audience members. ''[[Punk Planet]]'' editor Daniel Sinker wrote in ''We Owe You Nothing'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The vehemence fanzines large and small reserved for riot grrrl – and Bikini Kill in particular – was shocking.  The [[punk zine]] editors' use of '[[Bitch (insult)|bitch]]es', '[[cunt]]s', '[[misandry|man-haters]]', and '[[dyke (lesbian)|dyke]]s' was proof-positive that sexism was still strong in the punk scene.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kathi Wilcox said in a fanzine interview:
[[File:Khanna2.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill in 1996]]

{{quote|I've been in a state of surprise for several years about this very thing. I don't know why so-called punk rockers are so threatened by a little shake-up of the truly boring dynamic of the standard show atmosphere. How fresh is the idea of fifty sweaty hardcore boys slamming into each other or jumping on each others' heads? Granted, it's kind of cool to be on stage and have action in the front, much more inspiring than to look out at a crowd of zombies, but so often the survival-of-the-fittest principle is in operation in the pit, and what girl wants to go up against a pack of [[Henry Rollins|Rollins]] boys who usually only want to be extra mean to her anyway just to make her "prove" her place in the pit. This was the case when I was first going to shows, and it's sad that things haven't changed at all since. ... But it would have been so cool if at one of these shows someone onstage would have said, hey let's have more girls up in the front, just so I could have had more company and girls over to side could have seen better/been in the action. So yeah, we do encourage girls to the front, and sometimes when shows have gotten really violent (like when we were in England) we had to ask the boys to move to the side or the back because it was just too fucking scary for us, after several attacks and threats, to face another sea of hostile boy-faces right in the front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=154041389&amp;size=l |title=zine scan |publisher=Flickr.com |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kathleen Hanna would later write: "It was also super schizo to play shows where guys threw stuff at us, called us cunts and yelled "take it off" during our set, and then the next night perform for throngs of amazing girls singing along to every lyric and cheering after every song."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanna|first=Kathleen|title=My Herstory |url=http://www.letigreworld.com/sweepstakes/html_site/fact/khfacts.html|publisher=Letigreworld.com|accessdate=September 30, 2012|authorlink=Kathleen Hanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many men were supporters of riot grrrl culture and acts. Calvin Johnson and [[Slim Moon]] have been instrumental in publishing riot grrrl bands on the labels they founded, K Records and [[Kill Rock Stars]] respectively. [[Alec Empire]] of [[Atari Teenage Riot]] said, "I was totally into the riot grrrl music, I see it as a very important form of expression. I learned a lot from that, way more maybe than from 'male' punk rock."&lt;ref name="The Punk Years - Typical Girls"/&gt; [[Dave Grohl]] and [[Kurt Cobain]] dated Kathleen Hanna and Tobi Vail (also respectively), and often played with Bikini Kill even after splitting with them; Kurt was a big fan of [[The Slits]] and even convinced [[The Raincoats]] to reform. He once said, "The future of rock belongs to women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = St. Martin's Griffin| isbn = 978-0-312-14109-7| last = Raphael| first = Amy| title = Grrrls: Viva Rock Divas| location = New York| year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many riot grrrl bands included male band members, such as Billy Karren of Bikini Kill or Jon Slade and Chris Rawley of Huggy Bear.

Molly Neuman once summarized:  "We're not anti-boy, we're pro-girl."&lt;ref name="The Punk Years - Typical Girls"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJmvaPdPG5Y&amp;mode=related&amp;search= The Punk Years – Typical Girls].

For example, in Bikini Kill's "Don't Need You", they sing: "don’t need you to say we’re cute/don’t need you to say we’re alright/don’t need your protection/don’t need your kiss goodnight", rejecting stereotypical heterosexual relationship dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schilt|first=Kristen|title="A Little Too Ironic": The Appropriation and packaging of Riot Grrrl Politics by Mainstream Female Musicians|url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~kleong/staffpage/course/riottgrrl%20analysis.pdf|work=Popular Music and Society|publisher=Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced heavily by [[DIY culture]], most bands' presentation subverted traditional or classically trained 'musicianship' in favor of raw, primitive, [[avant-punk|avant]]-[[lo-fi]] passion and fiercely deliberate amateurism:  an idea growing rapidly in popularity, especially in the [[Olympia music scene]], with bands like [[Beat Happening]] coining the slogans:  "Learn how to NOT play your instrument" and "hey, you don't have to sound like the flavor of the month, all you have to do is sound like yourselves"{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}, arguing that traditional musical skill doesn't ultimately matter and should always be subservient to the passion, the fun and ideas in their music.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}  This argument is similar to the ideological origins of punk rock itself, which started partially as an attempt to dissolve the growing division between audience and performer.  These indie-punk bands (and riot grrrl bands in particular) were often ridiculed for "not being able to play their instruments", but fans are quick to counter that identical criticisms were often faced by the first-wave of punk rock bands in the 1970s, and that this DIY garage amateurism "play just 'cause you wanna, no matter what" attitude was one of the most appealing and liberating aspects of both movements.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Dacio identified with the riot grrrl movement. Letters between the band's drummer "Sloth" and Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill would soon see the bands share a stage in [[Hobart, Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tigerbomb.net/pages/bkpages/bikigigs.html |title=bikini kill concert chronology |publisher=Tigerbomb.net |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also many girl-centric or all-women punk and queercore bands of this era, such as [[Calamity Jane (90s band)|Calamity Jane]], 7 Year Bitch, [[Red Aunts]], [[Autoclave (band)|Autoclave]], [[Thee Headcoatees]], [[Spitboy]], [[Scissor Girls]], and [[Tribe 8]], who did not self-identify with the 'riot grrrl' label, despite sharing similar DIY tactics and feminist ideologies.

==Media misconceptions==
As media attention increasingly focused on Grunge and Alternative Rock in the early nineties, the term "Riot Grrrl" was often applied to less political female or female-fronted [[alternative rock]] acts such as [[Babes in Toyland (band)|Babes in Toyland]], [[The Breeders]], [[The Gits]], [[7 Year Bitch]], [[Hole (band)|Hole]], [[Lunachicks]], [[Dickless]], [[L7 (band)|L7]], [[PJ Harvey]], [[Liz Phair]], [[Veruca Salt (band)|Veruca Salt]], and even [[No Doubt]] - although the latter band formed and performed during this era, they began as a SoCal-based and non-Alternative
Ska/Punk/Oí group. They retained this style prior to, and after, their major label signing with [[The Beacon Street Collection]] and breakout album [[Tragic Kingdom]], remaining as such through their debut studio album release, the assotiated and frontline solo tours, Festivals, plus the longtime collaborations with [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] before the initial sound and style drifted into the other genres and the ultimate solo act from [[Gwen Stefani]] - and – although the term could arguably apply to [[L7 (band)|L7]] due to their involvement in the creation of [[Rock for Choice]], a series of concerts and compilation albums designed to raise money and awareness for abortion rights and protection of women's health clinics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rock for Choice|url=http://feminist.org/rock4c/index.html|publisher=Feminist Majority Foundation|accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To their chagrin, riot grrrls found themselves in the media spotlight during 1992, accused of dragging feminism into the [[mosh pit]] in magazines from ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' to ''[[Newsweek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malkin|first1=Nina|title=It's A Girl Thing|url=http://www.cs.xu.edu/~tankgirl/twelvelittlegrrrls/articles/seventeen.html|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Revolution, Girl Style|url=http://www.newsweek.com/revolution-girl-style-196998|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fallout from the media coverage led to resignations from the movement of people like Jessica Hopper, who was at the center of the ''Newsweek'' article.  Kathleen Hanna called that year for "a press block". In an essay from January 1994, included in the CD version of Bikini Kill's first two records, Tobi Vail responded to media simplifications and mis-characterization of Riot Grrrl:
&lt;blockquote&gt;one huge misconception for instance that has been repeated over and over again in magazines we have never spoken to and also by those who believe these sources without checking things out themselves is that Bikini Kill is the definitive 'riot girl band' ... We are not in anyway 'leaders of' or authorities on the 'Riot Girl' movement. In fact, as individuals we have each had different experiences with, feelings on, opinions of and varying degrees of involvement with 'Riot Girl' and though we totally respect those who still feel that label is important and meaningful to them, we have never used that term to describe ourselves AS A BAND. As individuals we respect and utilize and subscribe to a variety of different aesthetics, strategies, and beliefs, both political and punk-wise, some of which are probably considered 'riot girl.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writer/musician/historian/artist Sharon Cheslow said in [[Experience Music Project|EMP's]] ''Riot Grrrl Retrospective'' documentary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There were a lot of very important ideas that I think the mainstream media couldn't handle, so it was easier to focus on the fact that these were girls who were wearing [[barrette]]s in their hair or writing 'slut' on their stomach.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Corin Tucker]] of Heavens to Betsy and Sleater-Kinney said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think it was deliberate that we were made to look like we were just ridiculous girls parading around in our underwear.  They refused to do serious interviews with us, they misprinted what we had to say, they would take our articles, and our fanzines, and our essays and take them [[Fallacy of quoting out of context|out of context]].  We wrote a lot about [[sexual abuse]] and [[sexual assault]] for teenagers and young women.  I think those are really important concepts that the media ''never'' addressed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw3aIijPXws] YouTube. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719142124/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw3aIijPXws |date=July 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Zines and publications==
[[File:Girl Power zine.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The second amateur [[zine]] for riot grrrls put out by the [[feminist]] band [[Bikini Kill]] in 1991, entitled ''GirlPower''.]]
Even as the Seattle-area rock scene came to international [[Mass media|mainstream media]] attention, riot grrrl remained a willfully underground phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Darms"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Darms|first1 = Lisa|title = The Riot Grrrl Collection|publisher = Feminist Press (CUNY)|isbn = 1558618228|page = 168}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most musicians shunned the [[Big Five record labels|major record labels]], devotedly working instead with [[Independent record label|indie labels]] such as Kill Rock Stars, K Records, [[Slampt]], Piao! Records, [[Simple Machines]], Catcall, [[WIIIJA]] and [[Chainsaw Records]].  The movement also figured fairly prominently in [[cassette culture]], with artists often starting their own [[DIY cassette label]]s by as basic and spartan a means as recording their music onto cheap off-the-shelf [[boom-box]]es and passing the cassettes out to friends, seldom charging anything beyond the cost of the actual tapes themselves.

Riot grrrl's momentum was also hugely supported by an explosion of creativity in defiantly homemade cut and paste, [[xerox]]ed, [[collage]]y [[zine]]s that covered a variety of feminist topics, frequently attempting to draw out the political implications of intensely personal experiences in a "privately public" space.&lt;ref name=Darms /&gt; Zines often described experiences with [[sexism]], [[mental illness]], [[body image]] and [[eating disorders]], [[sexual abuse]], racism, rape, discrimination, [[stalking]], [[domestic violence]], [[incest]], [[homophobia]], and sometimes vegetarianism. Grrrl zine editors are collectively engaged in forms of writing and writing instruction that challenge both dominant notions of the author as an individualized, bodiless space and notions of feminism as primarily an adult political project.&lt;ref&gt;Comstock, Michelle. Grrl Zine Networks: Re-Composing Spaces of Authority, Gender, and Culture. La Jolla: n.p., September 3, 2013. PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;

These zines were archived by zinewiki.com, and Riot Grrrl Press, started in Washington DC in 1992 by Erika Reinstein &amp; May Summer.  Others can be found anthologized in ''A Girl's Guide to Taking over the World:  Writings from the Girl Zine Revolution'', for which actress/singer/musician/writer/performance artist [[Ann Magnuson]] of [[Bongwater (band)|Bongwater]] fame wrote as a foreword:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I think of how much benefit my teenage self could have gained from the multitude of zines that have proliferated over the past decade, I weep for all the lost potential.  Except for [[Joan of Arc]] and [[Anne Frank]], the thoughts of teenage girls have rarely been taken seriously.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bands would often attempt to [[reappropriation|reappropriate]] derogatory phrases like "cunt", "bitch", "dyke", and "[[slut]]", writing them proudly on their skin with lipstick or fat [[marker pen|markers]]. Kathleen Hanna was writing "slut" on her stomach at shows as early as 1992, intentionally fusing feminist art and activist practices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Riot grrrls making political statements to reclaim phrases is a common theme among third-wave feminists.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}  Not only did their music address the same issues as third-wave feminism, but they took a political stance against the oppression they were feeling.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Many of the women involved with queercore were also interested in riot grrrl, and zines such as ''Chainsaw'' by [[Donna Dresch]], ''Sister Nobody'', ''Jane Gets A Divorce'' and ''I (heart) Amy Carter'' by Tammy Rae Carland embody both movements. There were also national conventions like in Washington, D.C.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}, or the Pussystock festival in New York City, as well as various subsequent indie-documentaries like ''Don't Need You:  the [[Herstory]] of Riot Grrrl''.

Starting during the fall of 2010, the "Riot Grrrl Collection" has been housed at [[New York University]]'s Fales Library and Special Collections, as "The Fales Riot Grrrl Collection". The collection's primary mandate is "to collect unique materials that provide documentation of the creative process of individuals and the chronology of the [Riot Grrrl] movement overall".&lt;ref name="nyu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/fales/riotgrrrltest.html |title=The Riot Grrrl Collection |publisher=Fales Library &amp; Special Collections |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathleen Hanna, [[Johanna Fateman]], and Becca Albee have donated [[primary source]] material, while Molly Neuman, Allison Wolfe, Kathi Wilcox, and Carrie Brownstein are expected to donate material shortly. The collection is the brainchild of Lisa Darms, Senior Archivist at the Fales Library. According to Jenna Freedman, a librarian who maintains a zine collection at [[Barnard College]], "It's just essential to preserve the activist voices in their own unmediated work, especially because of the media blackout that they called for". Kathleen Hanna, while understanding no collection can replicate the concert experience, feels the collection is a safe place that will be "free from feminist erasure".&lt;ref name="nyu.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYU&gt;{{cite news|last=Soloski|first=Alexis|title=Revolution, Girl-Style—Shhh!|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-04-06/news/revolution-girl-style-mdash-shhh/|newspaper=Village Voice|date=April 6, 2010|quote=In one corner of the hushed reading room of the Fales Library &amp; Special Collections, housed on the third floor of New York University's Bobst Library, squats a strange object.

== Criticism ==
The "Riot Grrrl" movement has received criticism for not being inclusive enough. Riot Girls are often accused of being [[Separatist feminism|separatists]]: they want to form a life away from men and invent "girl culture".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/revolution-girl-style-now/Content?oid=880507|title = Revolution Girl-Style Now!

&lt;blockquote&gt;Riot grrrl calls for change, but I question who it's including ... I see Riot Grrrl growing very closed to a very few i.e. white middle class punk girls.&lt;ref name="Darms" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Musician [[Courtney Love]] has criticized the movement for being too doctrinaire and censorious:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Look, you've got these highly intelligent imperious girls, but who told them it was their undeniable American right not to be offended? Being offended is part of being in the real world. I'm offended every time I see George Bush on TV!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reilly|first=Phoebe|title=Courtney Love: Let the healing begin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOIh4tn8TGYC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA70&amp;ots=sTV_1yLjXx&amp;dq=Courtney%20Love%3A%20Let%20the%20healing%20begin&amp;pg=RA1-PA70#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|newspaper=Spin|date=October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some have suggested that, while riot grrrl bands worked to ensure their shows were safe spaces in which women could find solidarity and create their own subculture, they have excluded transwomen from events such as The [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival|Michigan's Womyn's Music Festival]], which has a [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival and transgender people|womyn born-womyn policy]]. Former members of [[Le Tigre]] have seen protests at shows for participating in the festival.&lt;ref name="Chart Attack"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trapunski|first1=Richard|title=Fans demand an apology from Kathleen Hanna in Toronto Julie Ruin concert banner drop|url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/2014/04/07/apologize-michigan-julie-ruin-kathleen-hanna-michfest/|publisher=Chart Attack|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of riot grrrl is clearly visible in numerous girls and women worldwide who cite the movement as an interest or an influence on their lives and/or their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Cherie|title=Everything You Need to Know About the Riot Grrrl Movement: The Feminism of a New Generation|year=2001|publisher=Rosen Pub.

Not only do these online platforms capture discussion regarding larger topics of systemic oppression, but they also provide space for girls to express smaller issues—the successes and challenges of their everyday lives. It is a forum that allows for self-determined feminism and genuine, open expression, a core part of the Riot Grrrl message that’s greatest power is giving girls the room to decide for themselves who they are.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 3175311|title = Riot Grrrl: Revolutions From Within|last = Garofalo|first = Gitana|date = 1998|journal = University of Chicago Press|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As both a purported musical genre and as a subculture, riot grrrl has been acclaimed as an influence on contemporary groups as varied as [[Kitten Forever]], [[Skating Polly]], [[The Shondes]] and [[The Ethical Debating Society]]. Besides that, the Riot Grrrl movement has been a strong influence not only for the punk-rock scene but also for other kinds of music. 

In the foreword to ''Riot Grrrl: Revolution Girl Style Now!'' [[Beth Ditto]] writes of riot grrrl,
&lt;blockquote&gt;A movement formed by a handful of girls who felt empowered, who were angry, hilarious, and extreme through and for each other. Built on the floors of strangers' living rooms, tops of Xerox machines, snail mail, word of mouth and mixtapes, riot grrrl reinvented punk.&lt;ref name="Monem, Nadine 2007 P.8"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writing about riot grrrl's personal influence on her and her music, she muses on the meaning of the movement for her generation, &lt;blockquote&gt;Until I found riot grrrl, or riot grrrl found me I was just another [[Gloria Steinem]] NOW feminist trying to take a stand in shop class. Now I am a musician, a writer, a whole person.&lt;ref name="Monem, Nadine 2007 P.8"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many women write to Hanna in hopes of reviving the Riot Grrrl Movement. Hanna says, “Don’t revive it, make something better".&lt;ref&gt;Frere-Jones, Sasha. "Hanna And Her Sisters."

In 2013 [[Astria Suparak]] and Ceci Moss curated ''Alien She'', an exhibition examining the impact of Riot Grrrl on artists and cultural producers. Alien She focuses on seven people whose visual art practices were informed by their contact with Riot Grrrl. Many of them work in multiple disciplines, such as sculpture, installation, video, documentary film, photography, drawing, printmaking, new media, social practice,  curation, music, writing and performance—a reflection of the movement's artistic diversity and mutability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://astriasuparak.com/2013/09/20/alien_she/|title = Alien She [curators statement]|date = |accessdate = December 31, 2015|website = Astriasuparak.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brooks|first=Katherine|title=First Riot Grrrl Exhibition Explores The Lasting Impact Of The Punk Feminist Movement|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/28/alien-she_n_3908938.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moss Suparak|first=Ceci Astria|title=Riot Grrrl, redux|url=http://boingboing.net/2013/11/06/riot-grrrl-redux.html|newspaper=Boing Boing|date=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened September 2013 at the Miller Gallery at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, and ran through February the following year.

The term "grrrl" (or "grrl") itself has since been co-opted or used by agencies as diverse as advocacy on behalf of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (GRRL POWER 1.0 5-PACK / Memetics for the Ladies)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onemillionbuttonsfordigitalfreedom.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Onemillionbuttonsfordigitalfreedom.com |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[roller derby]] league in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thechillipadis.wordpress.com/about/ |title=About &amp;#124; Chilli Padi Derby Girls |publisher=thechillipadis.wordpress.com |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russian studies''' is an interdisciplinary field crossing history and language studies. It is closely related to [[Soviet and Communist studies]] and many times is included under [[Slavic studies]].

Russian studies has become increasingly common in universities. In university, a Russian Studies major includes many cultural classes teaching Russian history, geography, linguistics, Russian language, literature and arts. Mysticism and folklore is commonly studied, introduction of Christianity, rule under the tsars and expansion of Russian empire, later rule under communism, history of the [[Soviet Union]] and its collapse and studies about present-day Russia.

'''Salvator P. Cupcea''' (also known as '''Salvador Cupcea'''; August 8, 1908 – 1958) was a [[Romania]]n psychologist, physician, and political figure. From beginnings as a researcher for the [[Babeș-Bolyai University|Victor Babeș University of Cluj]], alongside his friend [[Alexandru Roșca]], he became noted as a pioneer of [[experimental psychology]] and [[psychoanalysis]], studying in particular the social marginals. He later immersed himself in the [[Social hygiene movement|social hygiene]] and [[eugenics]] movement, also specializing in [[genetic medicine]], [[biological anthropology]], and [[criminology]]. A collaborator of [[Iuliu Moldovan]], he taught classes at the latter's Institute for much of World War II, when he focused on studying the intelligence of various body types.

During those years, Cupcea flirted with [[fascism]], and endorsed a [[Biopolitics|biopolitical]] "national hygiene" program. In 1944, he reemerged as a supporter of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] and [[liberal eugenics]], serving as [[Ministry of Health (Romania)|Health Minister]] and representative to the [[World Health Organization]]. A founder of the [[Iuliu Hațieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy|Cluj Medical University]] and administrator of its Psychiatric Clinic, his final work was in [[human ecology]], [[food science]], and [[cardiology]].

==Biography==
===Origins and family===
Salvator was born in [[Carei|Carei (Nagykároly)]],&lt;ref name="106ani"&gt;[http://www.buletindecarei.ro/2014/08/106-ani-de-la-nasterea-renumitului-medic-salvator-cupceafiu-al-careiului.html "106 ani de la naşterea renumitului medic Salvator Cupcea, fiu al Careiului"], in ''Buletin de Carei'', August 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[Szatmár County]], at the time part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. His was a family of importance in the [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Romanian Eastern Catholic]] community of [[Crișana]] region. His father, Petru Cupcea (1875–1940), was a priest, later the ''[[Protopope]]'' of [[Supur]] and honorary [[Archdeacon]], who was active in the [[Romanian National Party]] from 1909. Although ethnically Romanian, his paternal and maternal ancestors, the Cupceas and the Rednics, had been received into the [[Hungarian nobility]] of [[Partium]], tracing their aristocratic titles to 1609 and 1349 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Câmpean (2010), pp. 144–148&lt;/ref&gt; Petru's wife, Augusta, was the distant descendant of peasants from [[Tiream]], and daughter of George Pteancu.&lt;ref&gt;Câmpean (2010), pp. 98–100, 145&lt;/ref&gt; A Romanian educator and honorary citizen of Carei,&lt;ref name="106ani"/&gt; Pteancu was also leader of the [[Congregation of Marian Fathers|Marian Congregation]] branch in [[Năsăud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Vasile Iancu, [http://web.archive.org/web/20140714135641/http://www.romlit.ro/al._husar_caracterul_d_autoritate_sacerdoiului_critic "Al. Husar: 'Caracterul dă autoritate sacerdoțiului critic' "], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 24/2005&lt;/ref&gt; Augusta's brother, Alexandru Coriolan Pteancu (1878–1956), was a theologian, antiquarian, schoolteacher, political figure, and honorary ''Protopope''.&lt;ref&gt;Câmpean (2008), pp. 243–245&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple, who moved frequently in keeping up with Father Cupcea's successive assignments, had six children born in various localities, of whom Salvator and three sisters reached maturity.&lt;ref&gt;Câmpean (2010), pp. 100, 144–146, 148, 270&lt;/ref&gt; The eldest, Maria (1903–1980), was an educator, composer, and celebrated stage and film actress. She was for a while married one of Salvator's physician colleagues, Victor Munteanu, and had a son by him, [[Dan Munteanu]], who became a noted biologist.&lt;ref&gt;Câmpean (2010), pp. 148, 270–272&lt;/ref&gt; Another sister, Lucia, became the wife of Leontin Ghergariu (1897–1980), a philologist, adult educator, museum curator and sports enthusiast.&lt;ref&gt;Câmpean (2008), pp. 118–121; (2010), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; The youngest of the Cupcea siblings, Emilia, taught at the Biological Institute of [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]].&lt;ref name="vc(10)148"&gt;Câmpean (2010), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Cupcea's early childhood saw the dissolution of Austria-Hungary and the region's [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|incorporation with Romania]]. Directly involved in the process, Alexandru Pteancu was appointed chief inspector of secondary schools by the Romanian-led [[Directory Council of Transylvania|Regional Directorate]].&lt;ref&gt;Câmpean (2008), pp. 112, 244&lt;/ref&gt; There followed an interlude of [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungarian Soviet]] rule, during which Inspector Pteancu narrowly escaped execution.&lt;ref&gt;Câmpean (2008), p. 244; Teodor Neș, ''Oameni din Bihor: 1848–1918'', Tipografia Diecezană, Oradea, 1937, pp. 522–523&lt;/ref&gt; Father Cupcea, who had pledged Carei's support for the [[Great Union Day|Great Assembly]], was also targeted, being kidnapped and sent to [[Debrecen]], where he was reportedly tortured.&lt;ref&gt;Câmpean (2010), pp. 146–147; {{ro icon}} Valer Hossu, [https://archive.is/20150127131429/http://www.caietesilvane.ro/indexcs.php?cmd=articol&amp;idart=585 "Episcopul Iuliu Hossu în apărarea 'părților ungurene' abia unite cu România"], in ''Caiete Silvane'', January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Rescued by his coreligionists, he made his way to [[Oradea]], which fell to the Romanians in the [[Hungarian–Romanian War|military operations of 1919]].&lt;ref&gt;Câmpean (2010), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
In 1925, when Crișana had been secured for [[Greater Romania]], Salvator graduated from Carei's Lucaciu High School,&lt;ref name="106ani"/&gt; where he had become best friends with his schoolmate, [[Alexandru Roșca]].&lt;ref name="j&amp;r89"&gt;Jurcău &amp; Roșca, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; They both had a keen interest in psychology, and were urged on by their schoolteachers to pursue studies in the field.&lt;ref name="j&amp;r88"&gt;Jurcău &amp; Roșca, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Enlisting at the University of Cluj (known back then as "Upper Dacia University"), they attended the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy, specializing under Professor [[Florian Ștefănescu-Goangă]] at the Cluj Institute of Psychology. Together, they worked on Ștefănescu-Goangă's [[applied psychology]] teams, alongside various other young men who became figures of importance on the scientific, political, and literary scene: [[Nicolae Mărgineanu (psychologist)|Nicolae Mărgineanu]], [[Mihai Beniuc]], [[Liviu Rusu]], [[Lucian Bologa]], and [[Teodor Bugnariu]].&lt;ref name="j&amp;r88"/&gt;

Taking a degree in Psychology, Pedagogy and Aesthetics (February 1931),&lt;ref name="mo10870"&gt;"Chemări la catedre universitare", p. 10870&lt;/ref&gt; Cupcea also attended the Faculty of Medicine, where he earned a diploma in psychiatry, after which he took a position on the staff of the Mental Hospital in [[Sibiu]].&lt;ref name="j&amp;r88"/&gt; In early 1935, he was among the founders of the Romanian Psychoanalytic Circle and an editor of its magazine, ''Revista Română de Psihanaliză'', with which he sought to promote a more complete understanding of [[Sigmund Freud]] and his work.&lt;ref&gt;"Revista Revistelor. ''Revista Română de Psihanaliză''", in ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'', Nr. 5/1935, pp. 477–478&lt;/ref&gt; Together with fellow Freudians Ioan I. Popescu-Sibiu, G. Preda, and Anastase Dosios, he worked on ''Cercetări de psihologie experimentală la alienați'' ("Studies in Experimental Psychology among the Insane").&lt;ref&gt;"Din lucrările autorului", in Ioan I. Popescu-Sibiu, ''Psihanaliza (Doctrina lui Freud)'', Tip. Cav., Sibiu, 1936, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, Cupcea became a contributor to Ștefănescu-Goangă's academic journal, ''Revista de Psihologie'', where he wrote an introduction to [[psychological evaluation]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;"Cronică — Recensii — Spicuiri. ''Revista de Psihologie''", in ''Revista Generală a Învățământului'', Nr. 3–4/1938, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, together with Ștefănescu-Goangă and Roșca, he published a study on ''Adaptarea socială'' ("Social Adaptation"), which looked into the social careers of misfits: 3,300 criminals, 9,636 victims of suicide, and 434 mental patients. The authors found that [[maladaptation]] was critical among women and [[Székelys]], that most homicides occurred in [[Oltenia]], [[Western Moldavia|southern Moldavia]] and [[Ciuc County|Ciuc]], and that most suicides were reported in [[Transylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Ada Dogaru, "Recenzii. Realitatea românească. Fl. Ștefănescu-Goangă, Al. Roșca, Salvator Cupcea: ''Adaptarea socială''", in ''Sociologie Românească'', Nr. 10–12/1938, pp. 587–588&lt;/ref&gt; With Mihai Kernbach and Vasile Hurghișiu, he co-authored other work in [[medical jurisprudence]], presenting his findings at the 21 Congress of Legal Medicine, in [[Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;Iosif Friedmann-Nicolescu, "Un precursor al criminologiei moderne românești – Prof. dr. Mihai Kernbach", in ''Criminologie, Criminalistică și Penologie. Studii'', Nr. 4/2015, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Cupcea ultimately became a [[Doctor of Medicine]] in March 1939.&lt;ref name="mo10870"/&gt;

===Moldovan's aide===
While Bugnariu affiliated with the underground [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCdR), Cupcea and Roșca were drawn into fascist politics. As noted by author [[Nicolae Balotă]], who was also an employee of the Psychology Institute, they "contributed discreetly (and, what is more, prudently)" to the [[Iron Guard]].&lt;ref name="nbminotaur"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Nicolae Balotă]], [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=1273 "În laboratorul minotaurului ideologic (II). Fragment din ''Abisul luminat – Cartea a doua''"], in ''[[Apostrof]]'', Nr. 11/2010&lt;/ref&gt; Cupcea's father, meanwhile, was a leader of the mainstream [[National Peasants' Party]] in [[Sălaj County]] and a figure of importance in local democratic circles, especially active in the propaganda effort against [[Hungarian irredentism]].&lt;ref&gt;Câmpean (2010), p. 147; Marin Pop, "Alegerile comunale și județene din anul 1930 în județul Salaj și o radiografie a orașului Zalău în anii 30", in ''Caiete Silvane'', March 2010; "Corespondență și scrieri inedite sub lupa Securității. Corneliu Coposu către profesorul Ion Ivănescu", in ''Caiete Silvane'', October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, at the height of World War II, [[Northern Transylvania]], including Cluj, was ceded by Romania to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]] following the [[Second Vienna Award]]. The entire university and its logistics moved to Sibiu. Cupcea remained in contact with his colleagues, publishing in ''Revista de Psihologie'': in 1941, ''Constituția morfologică la bolnavii mintal'' ("The Morphological Built of the Mentally Ill"); in 1944, ''Încercarea unui sistem de psihopatologie constituțională evolutiv'' ("Sketching a System of Progressive Bodily Psychopathology").&lt;ref&gt;Jurcău &amp; Roșca, pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; He based these studies on the [[impact of health on intelligence]], and the theories of [[Ernst Kretschmer]], by examining the body types of university students, industrial workers and mental patients in relation to their [[intelligence quotient]] and state of mind, describing various correlations.&lt;ref&gt;"Chemări la catedre universitare", p. 10871&lt;/ref&gt; A disciple of physician and eugenicist [[Iuliu Moldovan]], he frequented [[Asociația Transilvană pentru Literatura Română și Cultura Poporului Român|ASTRA Society]] and published in its paper the 1941 tract ''Ce este Eugenia'' ("What Eugenics Is"). It discussed "the improvement of the genetic dowry" through both positive and negative measures.&lt;ref&gt;Butaru, pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting Moldovan and [[Francis Galton]], Cupcea tried to delimit his field of interest from [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial science]] (too radical) and [[euthenics]] (too mild), preferring Moldovan's term "hygiene of the nation".&lt;ref&gt;Vornica, pp. 221–223&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he expressed himself as a supporter of strict [[biological determinism]], and demanded the universal introduction of prenuptial examinations to filter out the [[dysgenics]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Pocrean, "Metode de eugenie, aplicabile în Banat", in ''Revista Institutului Social Banat–Crișana'', Vol. XI, 1943, pp. 138–141; Vornica, pp. 223–224&lt;/ref&gt;

Cupcea later became editor of ''Revista de Psihologie'', also serving on the staffs of ''Medicina Românească'' review and the Romanian Psychiatric Society.&lt;ref name="mo10870"/&gt; Described by his friends as a "gentleman of imposing stature" and a fine public speaker,&lt;ref name="j&amp;r88"/&gt; he was attracted into teaching. From 1942, he hosted a seminar of "mental hygiene" and [[medical genetics]], under Moldovan's guidance.&lt;ref&gt;"Chemări la catedre universitare", pp. 10870–10871&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, the university assigned him a lecturer's position in his alma mater, the Faculty of Medicine, where his oratorical skill drew in crowds.&lt;ref name="106ani"/&gt; Cupcea also affiliated with Moldovan's Institute of Hygiene and [[Biopolitics]], as a researcher,&lt;ref name="106ani"/&gt; and, taking a diploma in Public Health and Hygiene in 1944, as a section leader.&lt;ref name="mo10870"/&gt; His studies merged psychiatry and [[criminology]], investigating the role of [[emotional instability disorder]] as a gateway to other psychiatric conditions in the general population, and its supposed presence as "impulsiveness" among the criminal population.&lt;ref&gt;"Chemări la catedre universitare", pp. 10871–10872&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1944, [[King Michael's Coup]] aligned Romania with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], while also ushering in a [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]]. Discarding fascism, Cupcea and Roșca sought a rapprochement with the PCdR, passing themselves off as committed communists.&lt;ref name="nbminotaur"/&gt; ASTRA published Cupcea's introduction to ''Biologia teoretică şi aplicată în U.R.S.S.'' ("Theoretical and Applied Biology in the USSR"), which was a condemnation of [[scientific racism]] and [[social Darwinism]], as well as a tentative defense of [[Liberal eugenics|non-racial eugenics]]. The article announced that the era of eugenics as a separate discipline was coming to an end, as eugenics had infused the work values of Soviet biologists, especially those at the Maxim Gorky Medico-Biological Research Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marius Turda]], Aaron Gillette, ''Latin Eugenics in Comparative Perspective'', [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], London &amp; New York City, 2014, {{ISBN|978-1-4725-3140-7}}, p. 243. See also Butaru, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his eugenic tracts for that year, he circulated the notion that genes "do not produce characteristics per se, but rather provide certain evolutionary guidelines", which suggested to his readers that pedagogy had a major role in cultivating innate qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ministerial post and later life===
In 1945, Cupcea joined the [[Ministry of Health (Romania)|Health Ministry]] staff as a general secretary,&lt;ref name="106ani"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Chemări la catedre universitare", p. 10872&lt;/ref&gt; under [[Prime Minister of Romania|Premier]] [[Petru Groza]] and Minister [[Dumitru Bagdasar]]. On April 11, 1946, preparing for his retirement, Bagdasar delegated to Cupcea "all the rights that come with the office of minister [...], excepting those that are strictly reserved for the minister as head of his department and cannot therefore be delegated."&lt;ref&gt;"Ministerul Sănătății. Împuterniciri", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', April 17, 1946, pp. 3965–3966&lt;/ref&gt; Following Bagdasar's resignation and death, Cupcea effectively became the acting minister.&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, pp. 41, 217&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1946, he spoke at the national conference on people's health, where he presented a report on the dire conditions facing "today's democratic government": "One million [[Syphilis|syphilitics]], one and a half million [[gonorrhea]] victims, 600,000 [[tuberculosis]] victims, an 18 per cent [[infant mortality]]—that is the legacy of our past, the legacy of historical regimes".&lt;ref&gt;M. C., "Sănătatea poporului trebue salvată înlăturând moștenirea sumbră a trecutului", in ''[[Scînteia]]'', August 14, 1946, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, Cupcea was assigned the Chair of Mental Hygiene and Medical Genetics at the Cluj Hygiene Institute in September.&lt;ref&gt;"Chemări la catedre universitare", pp. 10870, 10872&lt;/ref&gt; On May 9, 1947, he was created a Commander of the [[Order of the Star of Romania|Star of Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;"Conferiri de decorații", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', May 28, 1947, p. 4253&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, he resigned from his political posts&lt;ref name="106ani"/&gt; and became manager of the Cluj University Psychiatric Clinic, taking over from [[Iuliu Hațieganu]], who had been purged by the communists.&lt;ref&gt;Cristian Colceriu, "Saga neurologiei clujene. 1857–2003", in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 253, March 2013, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, when, with his help, the Faculty of medicine became a [[Iuliu Hațieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy|Medical University]], he was made a full professor of hygiene, and soon after served as Dean.&lt;ref name="106ani"/&gt; In parallel, he worked on a regional medical task-force formed by the [[Romanian Academy]], while presiding over the Hygiene Institute, the Cluj clinics, and the local Medical Society.&lt;ref name="106ani"/&gt; In 1948, he was one of three Romanian representatives to the founding congress of the [[World Health Organization]], where he proposed the creation of a Mental Hygiene Committee and concrete backing for national research programs.&lt;ref&gt;''Actes officiels de l'Organisation mondiale de la Santé; no. 13: Première Assemblée mondiale de la Santé. Genève, du 24 juin au 24 juillet 1948. Séances plénières (Comptes rendu in extenso); Commissions principales (procès-verbaux et rapports); Résumé des résolutions et décisions'', [[World Health Organization]]. Geneva, 1948, pp. 17, 137, 142, 168&lt;/ref&gt; For a while, he also headed a Cluj section of the Romanian–Soviet Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Grigore Moldovan, "Instituții ale stalinismului cultural românesc: înființarea 'Institutului de studii româno‑sovietic', filiala Cluj (1949)", in Lucian Nastasă, Dragoș Sdrobiș (eds.), ''Politici culturale și modele intelectuale în România'', Editura Mega, Cluj-Napoca, 2013, {{ISBN|978-606-543-390-8}}, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; During those years, with Ștefănescu-Goangă and Roșca, he became involved in a cabal against their former colleague Mărgineanu, whom they denounced to the [[Securitate]].&lt;ref&gt;Camelia Zavarache, "Geometria unei relații complexe: elite, modele ale modernizării statale și regimuri politice în România secolului XX", in Cristian Vasile (ed.), ''"Ne trebuie oameni!".

With Leon Daniello, Leon Prodan, and 11 other researchers, he contributed the monograph ''Silicoza și silicotuberculoza'' ("[[Silicosis|Silicosis and Silicotuberculosis]]"), which earned him the State Prize for 1952.

The '''sociology of health and illness''', alternatively the '''sociology of health and wellness''' (or simply '''health sociology'''), examines the interaction between [[society]] and [[health]]. The objective of this topic is to see how social life affects [[morbidity]] and [[mortality rate]], and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Timmermans, Stefan &amp; Steven Haas. Towards a sociology of disease. ''Sociology of Health and Illness'', Vol. 30, No. 5, pp. 659-676: 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect of sociology differs from [[medical sociology]] in that this branch of sociology discusses [[health]] and [[illness]] in relation to social institutions such as [[family]], [[employment]], and [[school]]. The sociology of [[medicine]] limits its concern to the patient-practitioner relationship and the role of health professionals in society.&lt;ref name="Conrad"&gt;{{cite book| last = Conrad| first = Peter| title = The Sociology of Health and Illness Critical Perspectives| url = https://books.google.com/?id=wYKWr2N19CgC| year = 2008| publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers]]| isbn = 978-1-4292-0558-0| pages = 1–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sociology of health and illness covers sociological pathology (causes of disease and illness), reasons for seeking particular types of medical aid, and patient compliance or noncompliance with medical regimes.&lt;ref name=Conrad/&gt;

Health, or lack of health, was once merely attributed to biological or natural conditions. Sociologists have demonstrated that the spread of diseases is heavily influenced by the socioeconomic status of individuals, ethnic traditions or beliefs, and other cultural factors.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; Where medical research might gather statistics on a disease, a sociological perspective on an illness would provide insight on what external factors caused the demographics who contracted the disease to become ill.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite book| last = White| first = Kevin| title = An introduction to the sociology of health and illness| url = https://books.google.com/?id=eZSmngEACAAJ| year = 2002| publisher = SAGE Publishing| isbn = 978-0-7619-6400-1| pages = 4–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This topic requires a global approach of analysis because the influence of societal factors varies throughout the world. This will be demonstrated through discussion of the major diseases of each continent. These diseases are sociologically examined and compared based on the [[traditional medicine]], [[economics]], [[religion]], and [[culture]] that is specific to each region. [[HIV/AIDS]] serves as a common basis of comparison among regions. While it is extremely problematic in certain areas, in others it has affected a relatively small percentage of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.unaids.org/pub/GlobalReport/2008/jc1510_2008_global_report_pp211_234_en.pdf |title=HIV and AIDS estimates and data |year=2007 |publisher=World Health Organization |pages=214–233 |accessdate=Dec 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociological factors can help to explain why these discrepancies exist.

There are obvious differences in patterns of health and illness across societies, over time, and within particular society types. There has historically been a long-term decline in mortality within [[industrialized]] societies, and on average, life-expectancies are considerably higher in [[developed]], rather than developing or [[undeveloped]], societies.&lt;ref name= Marshall/&gt; Patterns of global change in health care systems make it more imperative than ever to [[research]] and comprehend the sociology of health and illness. Continuous changes in economy, [[therapy]], [[technology]] and [[insurance]] can affect the way individual communities view and respond to the medical care available. These rapid fluctuations cause the issue of health and illness within social life to be very dynamic in definition&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 &lt;/ref&gt;. Advancing information is vital because as patterns evolve, the study of the sociology of health and illness constantly needs to be updated.&lt;ref name=Conrad/&gt;

==Historical background==
[[File:Akmanthor.jpg|thumb|Wall painting found in the tomb of an Egyptian official known as the physicians tomb]]
Humans have long sought advice from those with knowledge or skill in [[healing]]. [[Paleopathology]] and other historical records, allow an examination of how ancient societies dealt with illness and [[outbreak]]. Rulers in Ancient Egypt sponsored physicians that were specialists in specific diseases.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; [[Imhotep]] was the first medical doctor known by name. An Egyptian who lived around 2650&amp;nbsp;B.C., he was an adviser to King Zoser at a time when Egyptians were making progress in medicine. Among his contributions to medicine was a textbook on the treatment of wounds, broken bones, and even [[tumors]].&lt;ref&gt;Saari, Peggy. "Medicine And Disease - Who Was The First Doctor In History?." History Fact Finder. Ed. Julie L. Carnagie. UXL-GALE, 2001. eNotes.com. 2006. 2 Nov, 2009 [http://www.enotes.com/history-fact-finder/medicine-disease/who-was-first-doctor-history eNotes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stopping the spread of infectious disease was of utmost importance for maintaining a healthy society.&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;{{cite book| last = Porter| first = Dorothy| title = Health, Civilization, and the state a history of public health from ancient to modern times| year = 1999| publisher = Routledge| location = New York NY| isbn = 978-0-415-12244-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak of [[disease]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]] was recorded by [[Thucydides]] who survived the [[epidemic]]. From his account it is shown how factors outside the disease itself can affect society. The Athenians were under siege and concentrated within the city. Major city centers were the hardest hit.&lt;ref name="Littman"&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Plague of Athens: Epidemiology and Paleopathology|last= Littman|first= Robert J.|year= 2009|publisher= Mount Sinai Journal of Medicine, Vol. 76, pp. 456-467.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made the outbreak even more deadly and with probable food shortages the fate of [[Athens]] was inevitable.&lt;ref name=Littman/&gt; Approximately 25% of the population died of the [[disease]].&lt;ref name=Littman/&gt; Thucydides stated that the [[epidemic]] "carried away all alike". The [[disease]] attacked people of different ages, sexes and nationalities.&lt;ref name=Littman/&gt;
[[File:Medicine aryballos Louvre CA1989-2183.jpg|thumb|Physician in [[Ancient Greece]] treating a patient 480–470 BC]]

Ancient medical systems stressed the importance of reducing illness through [[divination]] and ritual.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Other codes of behavior and dietary protocols were widespread in the ancient world.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; During the [[Zhou Dynasty]] in China, doctors suggested exercise, meditation and [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] to preserve one's health.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; The Chinese closely link health with spiritual well-being. Health regimes in ancient [[India]] focused on oral health as the best method for a healthy life.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; The  [[Talmud|Talmudic code]] created rules for health which stressed ritual cleanliness, connected disease with certain animals and created diets.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Other examples include the [[Mosaic Code]] and [[Roman baths]] and [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]].&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt;

Those that were most concerned with health, sanitation and illness in the ancient world were those in the elite class.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Good health was thought to reduce the risk of spiritual defilement and therefore enhanced the social status of the ruling class who saw themselves as the beacon of civilization.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; During the late Roman Period, sanitation for the lower classes was a concern for the leisured class.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Those that had the means would donate to charities that focused on the health of non-elites.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; After the decline of the [[Roman Empire]], physicians and concern with public health disappeared except in the largest cities.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Health and public doctors remained in the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Focusing on preventing the spread of diseases such as [[small pox]] lead to a smaller mortality rate in much of the western world.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; Other factors that allowed the modern rise in population include: better nutrition and environmental reforms (such as getting clean water supplies).&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt;

The present day sense of health being a public concern for the state began in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Lindemann"&gt;{{cite book| last = Lindemann| first = Mary| title = Medicine and Society in Early Modern Europe| year = 1999| publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 978-0-521-41254-4| pages = 155–159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few state interventions include maintaining clean towns, enforcing quarantines during [[epidemics]] and supervising sewer systems.&lt;ref name=Lindemann/&gt; Private corporations also played a role in public health. The funding for research and the institutions for them to work were funded by governments and private firms.&lt;ref name=Lindemann/&gt; Epidemics were the cause of most government interventions. The early goal of public health was [[reactionary]] whereas the modern goal is to prevent disease before it becomes a problem.&lt;ref name=Lindemann/&gt; Despite the overall improvement of world health, there still has not been any decrease in the health gap between the affluent and the impoverished.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite book| author3 = David Field| last1 = Taylor| first1 = Steve| last2 = Field| first2 = David| title = Sociology of Health and Health Care| url = https://books.google.com/?id=0OPjngEACAAJ| year = 2007| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell| location = Oxford, England| isbn = 978-1-4051-5172-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, society is more likely to blame health issues on the individual rather than society as a whole. This was the prevailing view in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; In the 1980s the [[Black Report]], published in the United Kingdom, went against this view and argued that the true root of the problem was material deprivation.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; This report proposed a comprehensive anti-poverty strategy to address these issues.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Since this did not parallel the views of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, it did not go into action immediately.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; The Conservative government was criticized by the Labour Party for not implementing the suggestions that the Black Report listed.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; This criticism gave the Black Report the exposure it needed and its arguments were considered a valid explanation for health inequality.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; There is also a debate over whether [[poverty]] causes ill-health or if ill-health causes poverty.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Arguments by the [[National Health Service]] gave considerable emphasis to poverty and lack of access to health care. It has also been found that [[heredity]] has more of a bearing on health than social environment, but research has also proved that there is indeed a positive correlation between socioeconomic inequalities and illness.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;

==Methodology==
The Sociology of Health and Illness looks at three areas: the conceptualization, the study of measurement and social distribution, and the justification of patterns in health and illness. By looking at these things researchers can look at different diseases through a sociological lens. The prevalence and response to different diseases varies by [[culture]].&lt;ref name= Marshall/&gt; By looking at bad health, researchers can see if health affects different social regulations or controls. When measuring the distribution of health and illness, it is useful to look at official [[statistics]] and community surveys. Official statistics make it possible to look at people who have been treated. It shows that they are both willing and able to use health services. It also sheds light on the infected person's view of their [[illness]]. On the other hand, community surveys look at people's rating of their health. Then looking at the relation of clinically defined illness and self reports and find that there is often a discrepancy.

A great deal of the time, mortality statistics take the place of the morbidity statistics because in many developed societies where people typically die from degenerative conditions, the age in which they die sheds more light on their life-time health. This produces many [[wikt:limitation|limitations]] when looking at the pattern of sickness, but sociologists try to look at various data to analyze the distribution better. Normally, developing societies have lower life expectancies in comparison to developed countries. They have also found correlations between mortality and sex and age. Very young and old people are more susceptible to sickness and [[death]]. On average women typically live longer than men, although women are more likely to have bad health.&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;Marshall, Gordon. "Health and illness, sociology of." A Dictionary of Sociology. 1998. Encyclopedia.com. 30 Nov. 2009 &lt;http://www.encyclopedia.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disparities in health were also found between people in different social classes and ethnicities within the same society, even though in the medical profession they put more importance in “health related behaviors” such as alcohol consumption, smoking, diet, and exercise. There is a great deal of data supporting the conclusion that these behaviors affect health more significantly than other factors.&lt;ref name= Marshall/&gt; Sociologists think that it is more helpful to look at health and illness through a broad lens. Sociologists agree that [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption, smoking, diet, and exercise are important issues, but they also see the importance of analyzing the cultural factors that affect these patterns. Sociologists also look at the effects that the productive process has on health and illness. While also looking at things such as industrial [[pollution]], environmental pollution, accidents at work, and stress-related diseases.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

Social factors play a significant role in developing health and illness. Studies of [[epidemiology]] show that autonomy and control in the workplace are vital factors in the etiology of heart disease. One cause is an effort-reward imbalance. Decreasing career advancement opportunities and major imbalances in control over work have been coupled with various negative health costs. Various studies have shown that pension rights may shed light on mortality differences between retired men and women of different socioeconomic statuses. These studies show that there are outside factors that influence health and illness.&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

==International perspective==

===Africa===
[[File:Map-of-HIV-Prevalance-in-Africa.png|thumb|Estimation of the number of adults in Africa who are infected with HIV or AIDS. Note that levels of infection are much higher in sub-Saharan Africa.]]

HIV/AIDS is the leading epidemic that affects the social welfare of Africa.&lt;ref name="Fredrickson"&gt;Fredrickson J, &amp; Kanabus, A. Impact of HIV/AIDS on Africa. retrieved Nov. 2009 from http://www.avert.org/aids-impact-africa.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can cause AIDS which is an acronym for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a condition in humans in which the [[immune system]] begins to fail, leading to life-threatening infections. Two-thirds of the worlds HIV population is located in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since the epidemic started more than 15 million Africans have died by complications with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=Fredrickson/&gt;

People apart of religious sub-groups of Sub-Saharan [[Africa]] and those who actively and frequently participate in religious activities are more likely to be at a lower risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. On the opposite end, there are many beliefs that an infected male can be cured of the [[infection]] by having sex with a virgin. These beliefs increase the number of people with the [[virus]] and also increase the number of rapes against women.&lt;ref name="Babb, DA. 2007"&gt;Babb, DA. (2007) Use of traditional medicine by HIV infected individuals. Psycho Health Med. 12, 314-320.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbal treatment is one of the primary medicines used to treat HIV in Africa. It is used more than standard treatment because it is more affordable.&lt;ref name=Fredrickson/&gt; Herbal treatment is more affordable but is not researched and is poorly regulated . This lack of research on whether the herbal medicines work and what the medicines consist of is a major flaw in the healing cycle of HIV in Africa.&lt;ref name="Babb, DA. 2007"/&gt;

Economically, HIV has a significant negative effect. The labor force in Africa is slowly diminishing, due to HIV-related deaths and illness. In response, government income declines and so does tax revenue. The government has to spend more money than it is making, in order to care for those affected with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=Fredrickson/&gt;
[[File:Aid Orphans in Malawi 2.jpeg|thumb|AIDS orphans in Malawi]]
A major social problem in Africa in regards to HIV is the orphan epidemic. The orphan epidemic in Africa is a regional problem. In most cases, both of the parents are affected with HIV. Due to this, the children are usually raised by their grandmothers and in extreme cases they are raised by themselves. In order to care for the sick parents, the children have to take on more responsibility by working to produce an income. Not only do the children lose their parents but they also lose their childhood as well. Having to provide care for their parents, the children also miss out on an education which increases the risk of teen pregnancy and people affected with HIV. The most efficient way to diminish the orphan epidemic is prevention: preventing children from acquiring HIV from their mothers at birth, as well as educating them on the disease as they grow older. Also, educating adults about HIV and caring for the infected people adequately will lower the orphan population.&lt;ref&gt;Epidemics: Malaria, AIDS, Other Disease: Post-colonial Africa. (2004). In Encyclopedia of African History. Retrieved Nov. 2009 from http://www.credoreference.com/entry/routafricanhistory/epidemics_malaria_aids_other_disease_postcolonial_africa&lt;/ref&gt;

The HIV/AIDS epidemic is reducing the average [[life expectancy]] of people in Africa by twenty years. The age range with the highest death rates, due to HIV, are those between the ages of 20 and 49 years. The fact that this age range is when adults acquire most of their [[income]] they cannot afford to send their children to school, due to the high medication costs. It also removes the people who could help aid in responding to the epidemic.&lt;ref name=Fredrickson/&gt;

===Asia===
Asian countries have wide variations of population, wealth, technology and health care, causing attitudes towards health and illness to differ. [[Japan]], for example, has the third highest life expectancy (82 years old), while [[Afghanistan]] has the 11th worst (44 years old).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html |title=Country Comparison:: Life Expectancy at Birth |work= CIA- the World Factbook |year=2009 |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate= Nov 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key issues in Asian health include childbirth and maternal health, HIV and AIDS, mental health, and aging and the elderly. These problems are influenced by the sociological factors of religion or belief systems, attempts to reconcile traditional medicinal practices with modern professionalism, and the economic status of the inhabitants of Asia.
[[File:People living with HIV AIDS world map.PNG|thumb|People living with [[HIV/AIDS]]]]

Like the rest of the world, Asia is threatened by a possible pandemic of HIV and AIDS. [[Vietnam]] is a good example of how society is shaping Asian HIV/AIDS awareness and attitudes towards this disease. Vietnam is a country with feudal, traditional roots, which, due to invasion, wars, technology and travel is becoming increasingly globalized. [[Globalization]] has altered traditional viewpoints and values. It is also responsible for the spread of HIV and AIDS in Vietnam. Even early globalization has added to this problem – Chinese influence made Vietnam a [[Confucianism|Confucian society]], in which women are of less importance than men. Men in their superiority have no need to be sexually responsible, and women, generally not well educated, are often unaware of the risk, perpetuating the spread of HIV and AIDS as well as other STIs.&lt;ref name="Micollier"&gt;{{cite book| last = Micollier| first = Evelyne| title = Sexual cultures in East Asia the social construction of sexuality and sexual risk in a time of AIDS| url = https://books.google.com/?id=LMk5ngEACAAJ| year = 2004| publisher = Routledge| location = London| isbn = 978-0-415-30871-7| pages = 98–101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucianism has had a strong influence on the belief system in Asia for centuries, particularly in China, Japan, and Korea, and its influence can be seen in the way people chose to seek, or not seek, medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/9703/Humanity-Asian-Thought-Spread-Confucianism.html |title=The Spread of Confucianism |author=Powers, John |accessdate= Dec 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An important issue in Asia is societal effect on the ability of disabled individuals to adjust to a disability. Cultural beliefs shape attitudes towards physical and mental disabilities. China exemplifies this problem. According to Chinese Confucian tradition (which is also applicable in other countries where [[Confucianism]] has been spread), people should always pursue good health in their lives, with an emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention.&lt;ref name=Yang/&gt; To the Chinese, having a disability signifies that one has not led a proper lifestyle and therefore there is a lack of opportunities for disabled individuals to explore better ways to accept or adapt to their disability.&lt;ref name=Yang/&gt;

Indigenous healing practices are extremely diverse throughout Asia but often follow certain patterns and are still prevalent today. Many traditional healing practices include [[shamanism]] and [[herbalism|herbal medicines]], and may have been passed down orally in small groups or even institutionalized and professionalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author3 = Geoffrey Samuel| last1 = Connor| first1 = Linda| last2 = Samuel| first2 = Geoffrey| title = Healing powers and modernity traditional medicine, shamanism, and science in Asian societies| url = https://books.google.com/?id=e0Zx44BOiDoC| year = 2001| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| location = Westport, Connecticut| isbn = 978-0-89789-715-0| pages = 3–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many developing countries the only health care available until a few decades ago were those based on traditional medicine and spiritual healing. Now governments must be careful to create health policies that strike a balance between modernity and tradition. Organizations, like the [[World Health Organization]], try to create policies that respect tradition without trying to replace it with modern science, instead regulating it to ensure safety but keeping it accessible.&lt;ref name="Packer"&gt;{{cite book| author4 = Choon Nam Ong | author5= Barry Halliwell|lastauthoramp=y| last1 = Packer| first1 = Lester| last2 = Ong| first2 = Choon Nam| last3 = Halliwell| first3 = Barry| title = Herbal and traditional medicine molecular aspects of health| url = https://books.google.com/?id=xzj6ngEACAAJ| year = 2004| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-8247-5436-5| pages = 2–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; India in particular tries to make traditional medicines safe but still available to as many people as possible, adapting tradition to match modernization while still considering the economic positions and culture of its citizens.&lt;ref name=Packer/&gt;
[[File:Flag of WHO.svg|thumb|Flag of World Health Organization]]

Mental health issues are gaining an increasing amount of attention in the Asian countries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Many of these countries have a preoccupation with modernizing and developing their economies, resulting in cultural changes. In order to reconcile modern techniques with traditional practices, [[social psychology|social psychologists]] in India are in the process of “[[indigenization|indigenizing]] psychology”. Indigenous psychology is that which is derived from the laws, theories, principals, and ideas of a culture and unique to each society.&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;{{cite book| last = Yang| first = Guoshu| title = Progress in Asian social psychology conceptual and empirical contributions| url = https://books.google.com/?id=o4itQDGGvYgC| year = 2003| publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group]]| location = Westport, Connecticut| isbn = 978-0-313-32463-5| pages = 11–12, 294–295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many Asian countries, childbirth is still treated by traditional means and is thought of with regional attitudes. For example, in [[Pakistan]], decisions concerning pregnancy and [[obstetrics|antenatal care]] (ANC) are usually made by older women, often the pregnant woman's mother-in-law, while the mother and father to be are distanced from the process.

Female midwives and healers are still the norm in most places. Western methods are overtaking the traditional in an attempt to improve maternal health and increase the number of live births.&lt;ref name="Rozario"&gt;{{cite book| author3 = Geoffrey Samuel| last1 = Rozario| first1 = Santi| last2 = Samuel| first2 = Geoffrey| title = the Daughters of Hariti childbirth and female healers in South and Southeast Asia| url = https://books.google.com/?id=ge-JngEACAAJ| year = 2002| publisher = Routledge| location = London| isbn = 978-0-415-27792-1| pages = 1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian countries, which are mostly developing nations, are [[population ageing|aging rapidly]] even as they are attempting to build their economies. Even wealthy Asian nations, such as Japan, [[Singapore]], and [[Taiwan]], also have very elderly populations and thus have to try to sustain their economies and society with small younger generations while caring for their elderly citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Phillips| first = David| title = Ageing in the Asia-Pacific region issues, policies, and future trends| url = https://books.google.com/?id=fS4YngEACAAJ| year = 2000| publisher = Routledge| location = London| isbn = 978-0-415-22018-7| pages = xiv-xv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The elderly have been traditionally well respected and well cared for in most Asian cultures; experts predict that younger generations in the future are less likely to be concerned and involved in the health care of their older relatives due to various factors such as women joining the workforce more, the separation of families because of urbanization or migration, and the proliferation of [[Westernisation|Western ideals]] such as individualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hermalin| first = Albert| title = the Well-being of the elderly in Asia a four-country comparative study| url = https://books.google.com/?id=OzXqngEACAAJ| year = 2002| publisher = [[University of Michigan Press]]| isbn = 978-0-472-11280-7| pages = 1–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The health patterns found on the continent of [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] which includes the [[Pacific Islands]], have been very much influenced by [[European colonization]]. While indigenous medicinal beliefs are not significantly prevalent in Australia, traditional ideas are still influential in the health care problems in many of the islands of the Pacific.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book| author3 = Kerrie L. Macpherson| last1 = Lewis| first1 = Milton James| last2 = Macpherson| first2 = Kerrie L.| title = Public health in Asia and the Pacific historical and comparative perspectives| url = https://books.google.com/?id=pR14OqopGe8C| year = 2007| publisher = Routledge| location = London| isbn = 978-0-415-35962-7| pages = 222–235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid [[urbanization]] of Australia led to epidemics of [[typhoid fever]] and the [[Bubonic plague]]. Because of this, public health was professionalized beginning in the late 1870s in an effort to control these and other diseases. Since then Australia's health system has evolved similarly to Western countries and the main cultural influence affecting health care are the political ideologies of the parties in control of the government.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;
[[File:Bayer Heroin bottle.jpg|thumb|upright|Old heroin bottle]]
Australia has had treatment facilities for 'problem drinkers' since the 1870s. In the 1960s and 1970s it was recognized that Australia had several hundred thousand alcoholics and prevention became a priority over cures, as there was a societal consensus that treatments are generally ineffective.&lt;ref name= Lewis/&gt; The government began passing laws attempting to curb alcohol consumption but consistently met opposition from the [[Australian wine|wine-making regions of southern Australia]]. The government has also waged a war on illegal drugs, particularly [[heroin]], which in the 1950s became widely used as a pain reliever.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;

Experts believe that many of the health problems in the Pacific Islands can be traced back to European colonization and the subsequent globalization and modernization of island communities.&lt;ref name="Otsuka"&gt;{{cite book| author3 = Stanley J. Ulijaszek| last1 = Ohtsuka| first1 = Ryutaro| last2 = Ulijaszek| first2 = Stanley J.| title = Health change in the Asia-Pacific region biocultural and epidemiological approaches| url = https://books.google.com/?id=T5M1nwEACAAJ| year = 2007| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-83792-7| pages = 4, 7–9, 136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[History of the Pacific Islands]].) European colonization and late independence meant modernization but also slow economic growth, which had an enormous effect on health care, particularly on [[nutrition]] in the Pacific Islands. The end of colonization meant a loss of medical resources, and the fledgling independent governments could not afford to continue the health policies put in place by the colonial governments.&lt;ref name= Otsuka/&gt; Nutrition was changed radically, contributing to various other health problems. While more prosperous, urban areas could afford food, they chose poor diets, causing 'overnourishment', and leading to extremely high levels of [[obesity]], [[type 2 diabetes]], and cardiovascular diseases. Poorer rural communities, on the other hand, continue to suffer from [[malnutrition]] and [[malaria]].&lt;ref name= Otsuka/&gt;

Traditional diets in the Pacific are very low in fat, but since World War II there has been a significant increase in [[fat]] and [[protein]] in Pacific diets. Native attitudes towards weight contribute to the obesity problem. [[Tonga]]n natives see obesity as a positive thing, especially in men. They also believe that women should do as little physical work as possible while the men provide for them, meaning they get very little exercise.&lt;ref name= Otsuka/&gt;

===Europe===
The largest endeavors to improve health across Europe is the [[World Health Organization]] European Region.&lt;ref name="Nosikov"&gt;{{cite report|title= The European Health Report 2002|last= Nosikov|first= Anatoliy|year= 2002|publisher= World Health Organization Regional Office Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to improve the health of poor and disadvantaged populations by promoting healthy lifestyles including environmental, economic, social and providing [[health care]].&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; Overall health in Europe is very high compared to the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; The average life expectancy is around 78 in [[European Union|EU]] countries but there is a wide gap between Western and Eastern Europe. It is as low as 67 in Russia and 73 in the [[Balkan]] states.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; Europe is seeing an increase in the spread of [[HIV/AIDS]] in Eastern Europe because of a worsening socioeconomic situation.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; [[Cardiovascular disease]], cancer and [[diabetes mellitus]] are more prevalent is Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; The [[WHO]] claims that poverty is the most important factor bringing on ill health across Europe.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; Those at low [[socioeconomic status]] levels and many young people are also at risk because of their increased tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; Health and illness prevention in Europe is largely funded by the governmental services including: regulating health care, insurance and social programs.&lt;ref name=Nosikov/&gt; The role of religion and traditional medicine, however, is often left unexamined in such reports.

The study of [[hypertension]] within the [[United Kingdom]] has turned to examining the role that beliefs play in its diagnosis and treatment. Hypertension is an essential topic for study since it is linked to increased risk of [[stroke]] and [[coronary heart disease]]. The most common treatment for hypertension is medication but compliance for this treatment plan is low.&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Managing hypertension: beliefs and responses to medication among cultural groups|last= Morgan|first= Myfanwy|year= 1988|publisher= Sociology of Health &amp; Illness, Vol. 10, No. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in the UK examined the differences between 'white' patients and first generation immigrants from the West Indies. There were differing reasons for non-compliance that involve the patients' perception and beliefs about the [[diagnosis]]. Patients commonly believe that high levels of [[anxiety]] when first diagnosed are the major cause and think that when stress levels decline so too will their hypertension. Other respondents in this UK based study had varying beliefs concerning the necessity of medication while others still argued that it was the [[side effects]] of medication that made them end their prescribed regimen.&lt;ref name=Morgan/&gt; West Indian respondents whose lay [[culture]] teaches them to reject long-term drug therapy opted instead for folk remedies in higher numbers than the 'white' respondents. What can be seen here is that some people will choose to ignore a doctor's expert advice and will employ 'lay consultation' instead.&lt;ref name=Morgan/&gt;
[[File:World Health Organisation regional offices.svg|thumb| Regions of the [[WHO]]]]

Before people seek medical help they try to interpret the symptoms themselves and often consult people in their lives or use 'self-help' measures.&lt;ref name="Punamaki"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Reasons for consultation and explanations of illness among Finnish primary-care patients|last= Punamaki|first= Raija-Leena|year= 1995|publisher= Sociology of Health &amp; Illness, Vol. 17, No. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of 'everyday illness' in [[Finland]] including: [[influenza]], [[infections]] and [[musculo-skeletal]] problems focused on reasons for consulting medical experts and explanations of illness. These common illness were examined not because of their seriousness but because of their frequency. The researchers explain five possible triggers that people seek medical aid: 1- the occurrence of an interpersonal crisis 2- perceived interference with social and personal relations 3- perceived interference with vocational &amp; [[physical activity]] 4- sanctioning by other people 5- sufferers ideas about how long certain complaints should last. These kind of explanatory models are part of the process that people use to construct medical culture.&lt;ref name=Punamaki/&gt; They give meaning to illness and health, answer questions about personal responsibility about health and most importantly are part of the dialogue between patients' and professionals' illness explanations. It can help explore why some patients will follow a doctors instructions to the letter and others ignore them completely. A patient's explanation or understanding of their illness can be much broader than a physician's and this dynamic has become a major criticism of modern medical practice since it normally excludes the "social, psychological and experiential dimensions of illness."&lt;ref name=Punamaki/&gt;

The Finnish study examined 127 patients and the results have been different from findings in other countries where there is more 'lay consultation'. Half of the respondents did not have any lay consultation before coming to the doctors office. One-third did not try any self-treatment and three-quarters of the sample consulted the doctor within three days of symptoms developing.&lt;ref name=Punamaki/&gt; Possible explanations are that in [[Finland]] there is an aspect "over-protectiveness" within their health care system. Many{{Who|date=May 2011}} might conclude that the Finnish people are dependent and helpless but the researchers of this study found that people chose to consult professionals because they trusted them over some lay explanation. These results echo similar studies in Ireland that explain this phenomenon as being based in a strong work ethic. Illness in these countries will affect their work and Finnish people will quickly get treatment so they can return to work. This research out of Finland also describes that this relationship between patient and doctor is based on:
# national and municipal administrative bureaucracies that demand more output and more satisfied patients
# the public demanding better care
# nurses criticizing physicians for not taking a holistic view of patients
# hospital specialists wanting better/earlier screening for serious illnesses (e.g. cancer).&lt;ref name=Punamaki/&gt;

The conflict between medical and lay worlds is prominent. On one hand many patients believe they are the expert of their own body and view the [[Doctor-patient relationship]] as [[authoritarian]]. These people will often use knowledge outside the medical field to deal with health and illness. Others see the doctor as the expert and are shy about describing their symptoms and therefore rely on the doctor for diagnosis and treatment.&lt;ref name=Punamaki/&gt;

===North America===
[[File:Obesity country comparison - path.svg|thumb|Compares figures in the population of [[OECD]] countries and the percentage of total population (aged 15 and above) with a [[body mass index]] greater than 30. Data was collected between 1996 and 2003.]]

North America is a fairly recent settled continent, made up of the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. It was built by an amalgamation of wealth, ideas, culture, and practices. North America is highly advanced intellectually, technologically, and traditionally. This advantageous character of North American nations has caused a high average [[life expectancy]] of 75 years for males and 80 years for females. This leads to the conclusion that North America has cultivated a comparatively healthy society. As North America contains several core nations, the growing economies in those nations are able to maintain and develop medical institutions. This subsequently provides more access to health care for American citizens but health care is not universal. North America is known for being a leading nation in regards to [[industrialization]] and modernization, but the United States lacks federal laws regarding health care as a basic human right. This lag of health care security causes subsequent issues with pharmaceutical competition, lack of care for the elderly, and little attention to alternative medicine.&lt;ref name=Conrad/&gt; Health care and education are plentiful at a price and illness still persists for many reasons.&lt;ref name="WHO World Health Statistics 2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2008/en/index.html |title=WHO World Health Statistics 2008 |year=2008 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=Dec 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A main reason is that a lower- and middle-class population still exists in plentiful numbers, maintaining a group that is highly vulnerable to physical ailment.
[[File:Alcohol by country.svg|thumb|World map showing alcohol consumption around the world]]

North America's primary [[risk factors]] for illness are currently{{When|date=May 2011}} alcohol abuse, [[malnutrition]], [[obesity]], [[tobacco]] use, and water sanitation.&lt;ref name="WHO World Health Statistics 2008"/&gt; [[Obesity]] is a recent epidemic in North America. The 1990s brought a rise in the average [[Body Mass Index]], or BMI. From the beginning and to the end of the decade, the median percent of adults who were obese rose from 12% to 20%.&lt;ref name="WHO World Health Statistics 2008"/&gt; [[Alcoholism]] is the addiction of over-consumption of alcohol and is highly prevalent in the US. There are high incidence rates in many other world regions. Roughly 61% of American adults drank in 2007, and 21% of current drinkers consumed five or more drinks at one point in the last year. There have also been 22,073 alcohol induced deaths in the United States in the past year, about 13,000 of which were related to liver disease.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Disease Control and Prevention: FastStats. Alcohol Use. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/alcohol.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Alcoholism has many risk factors ingrained in North American culture, such as heredity, stress from competition or availability.

The [[Swine Flu]] (also known as (H1N1) epidemic is a recent disease emerging in the early 21st century. In April 2009, during the early days of the outbreak, a molecular biologist named Dr. Henry Miller wrote in the ''Wall Street Journal'' about [[New York City]] high-school students. These students apparently brought the virus back from [[Mexico]] and infected their classmates.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, Henry I. Wall Street Journal: Understanding Swine Flu, April 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; All six cases so far reported in [[Canada]] were connected directly or indirectly with travel to Mexico as well. Flu viruses can be directly transmitted (via droplets from sneezing or coughing) from pigs to people, and vice versa. These cross-species infections occur most commonly when people are close to large numbers of pigs, such as in barns, livestock exhibits at fairs, and slaughterhouses. The flu is transmissible from human to human, either directly or via contaminated surfaces."&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

===South America===
There are many [[disease]]s that affect [[South America]], but two major conditions are [[malaria]] and [[Hepatitis]] D.
Malaria affects every country in South America except [[Uruguay]], [[Chile]], and The [[Falkland Islands]]. [[Elevation]] is a major factor in the areas where malaria is found. The disease is spread from person to person via [[mosquito]] bites. People are typically bitten by mosquitoes at dusk and dawn. [[Symptoms]] of this disorder are: high fever, chills, sweating, headaches, body aches, weakness, vomiting and [[diarrhea]]. If left untreated, new symptoms can occur; people that are infected may experience [[seizures]], delirium and [[coma]]. Severe cases may end in [[death]]. Malaria can be cured, but the symptoms may not become noticeable until months later. There are three forms of medication that can cure Malaria. An infected person's accessibility to these drugs is dependent upon their access to medical care and their financial situation. Literature about Malaria treatment typically is focused toward people who are tourists. Most sources are not written with the native in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Palmerlee| first1 = Danny| last2 = Bao| first2 = Sandra| last3 = Beech| first3 = Charlotte| title = South America on a shoestring| year = 2004| isbn = 978-1-74104-163-7| page = 1056 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Malaria map.PNG|thumb|Malaria]]

The first sign of [[Hepatitis]] D was detected in 1978 when a strange and unrecognizable internuclear [[antigen]] was discovered during a [[liver]] [[biopsy]] of several Italians who suffered HBV infection. Scientists initially thought that it was an antigenic specificity of HBV, but they soon found that it was a [[protein]] from another disease altogether. They called it "Hepatitis Delta Virus" (HDV). This new virus was found to be defective. HDV needed HBV to act as a helper function in order for it to be detected. Normally Hepatitis B is transmitted through [[blood]] or any type of blood product. In [[South America]] Hepatitis D was found to be fatal. [[Scientist]]s are still unsure in what way this disease was being transmitted throughout certain South American countries. Sexual contact and [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] are the most common means of transmission. HDV is still considered an unusual form of hepatitis. Agents of this virus resemble that of plant viroids. It is still hard to tell how many stereotypes exist because HDV is under the umbrella of HBV. HDV causes very high titers in the blood of people who are infected. Incubation of Hepatitis D typically lasts for thirty five days. Most often Hepatitis D is a co-infection with Hepatitis B or a super-infection with chronic hepatitis. In terms of super infections there are high mortality rates, ranging seventy to eighty percent; in contrast with co-infections which have a one to three percent mortality rate. There is little information with the ecology of Hepatitis D. Epidemics have been found in Venezuela, Peru, Columbia, and Brazil. People who are treated for Hepatitis B have been able to control Hepatitis D. People who have chronic HDB will continue to get HDV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = for the National Academy of Sciences| title = Infectious Diseases in an Age of Change The Impact of Human Ecology and Behavior on Disease Transmission| year = 1995| publisher = National Academies Press| isbn = 0-309-05136-3| pages = 67–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another disease that affects South America is HIV and AIDS. In 2008 roughly two million people had HIV and AIDS. By the end of 2008 one hundred and seventy thousand people were infected with AIDS and HIV. Seventy seven thousand people died from this disease by the end of that year. Brazil has the most people that are affected with AIDS and HIV in South America. Forty-three percent of people in Brazil have HIV.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In Brazil sixty percent of the inhabitants use drugs, are HIV positive, and are HIV positive because of their drug use. Usually this disease is transmitted by either drug use involving needles or unprotected sex. Sharing needles and being infected with HIV and AIDS is most common in Paraguay and Uruguay. South America is trying to get treatment to the thousands of people infected by this disease. Brazil is offering generic AIDS prescriptions that are much less expensive than the name brand drugs. One hundred and eighty-one thousand inhabitants in Brazil who were infected are being treated. That accounts for eighty percent of those who needed immediate help. This aid from the government has had positive results. Statistics show that there was a fifty percent decrease in mortality rates, approximately sixty to eighty percent decrease in morbidity rates and a seventy percent decrease in hospitalization of infected people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Willcox| first1 = Merlin| last2 = Bodeker| first2 = Gerard| last3 = Rasoanaivo| first3 = Philippe| title = Traditional Medicinal Plants and Malaria| year = 2004| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-415-30112-1| page = 173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In very remote areas of South America, traditional healers are the only forms of health care people have.&lt;ref&gt;Willcox, Merlin, Gerard Bodeker and Philippe Rasoanaivo. Traditional medicinal plants and malaria. United States of America: CRC Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
In north Aymara and south Mapuche, where the indigenous groups have the strongest voices, they still heavily use traditional medicine. The government in Chile has implemented an Indigenous Health System to help strengthen the health care system. Even with Chile's indigenous groups, Chile still has the best public health services in South America.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} They also have the lowest mortality rates in the area. Their health care policies are centered around family and community wellbeing by focusing on the strategies for prevention health strategies. Reports have shown an increase in mental health issues, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.&lt;ref&gt;World Learning Study Abroad. 2009. 3 December 2009 &lt;http://www.sit.edu/studyabroad/ssa_cih.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

South America's economy is developing rapidly and has a great deal of industries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The major industry in South America are agriculture. Other industries are fishing, handicrafts, and natural resources. Its trade and import-export market is continually thriving. In the past South American countries moved slowly in regards to economic development. South America began to build its economy ever since World War II. South America's largest economies are Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Columbia. Venezuela, Peru, and Argentina's economy are growing very rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Encyclopedia of World Geography China-Taiwan| year = 2002| isbn = 978-0-7614-7289-6| page = 672 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30140">A '''taxi dance hall''' is a type of [[dance hall]] where dancers, usually young women, called [[taxi dancer]]s are paid to [[dance]] with usually male patrons. The owners of a taxi dance hall provide music and a dance floor for their patrons and taxi dancers.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]] during the 1920s and 1930s, when taxi dancing was at its peak, patrons of taxi dance halls would typically buy dance tickets for ten cents each.&lt;ref&gt;Freeland(2009), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; When they presented a ticket to a taxi dancer, she would dance with them for the length of a single song.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Taxi dancers earned a [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] on every dance ticket that they collected.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ticket-a-dance'' system was the centerpiece of the taxi dance halls. Taxi dance halls are vividly represented on the ouverture of [[Henry Miller]] novel [[The Rosy Crucifixion | Sexus]], where the narrator falls in love with a taxi dancer after meeting her on a Thursday night, circa 1928.

==Origins and development==

The taxi dance hall is a uniquely American institution that was first introduced in 1913 within [[San Francisco]]'s [[Barbary Coast, San Francisco, California|Barbary Coast]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time reform movements were shutting down many [[bordello]]s and [[Red light district|red-light districts]] within America's cities, and strength for [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] was gaining. In 1920, when the taxi dance halls entered their steep upward climb to popularity, prohibition was enacted and made serving alcohol in saloons, bars, and cafes illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury(1933), p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; The taxi dance hall's roots can be traced to a number of earlier dance establishments.

===Barbary Coast dance hall===

Prior to the emergence of taxi dance halls in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], that city popularized a different form of dance hall called the ''Barbary Coast dance hall'', or also called the ''Forty-Nine['49] dance hall''. [[California Gold Rush#Forty-niners|Forty-Niner]] is a term for the gold prospectors who came to California during the [[California Gold Rush]] circa 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury (1933), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; At the Barbary Coast dance halls, female employees danced with male patrons and earned their living on commissions paid for the drinks that they could encourage their male dance partners to buy.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; These dance halls were representative of the [[Old west|Old West]]—noisy, rough, boisterous, and occasionally violent. As writer [[William Henry Irwin|Will Irwin]] described: 
{{blockquote|The Barbary Coast was a loud bit of hell. No one knows who coined the name. The place was simply three blocks of solid dance halls, there for the delight of the sailors of the world. On a fine busy night every door blared loud dance music from orchestras, [[steam pianos]], and [[Phonograph|gramophones]], and the cumulative effect of the sound which reached the streets was chaos and pandemonium. Almost anything might be happening behind the swinging doors.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Henry Irwin]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3314/3314-h/3314-h.htm "The City That Was: A Requiem of Old San Francisco"], ''The New York Sun'', April 21, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Closed dance hall===

But in 1913, San Francisco enacted new laws that would forbid dancing in any cafe or saloon where alcohol was served. The closure of the Barbary Coast dance halls quickly fostered a new kind of pay-to-dance scheme called the ''closed dance hall''. The name was derived from the fact that female patrons were not allowed—the only women permitted in these halls were the dancing female employees.&lt;ref&gt;Report of Public Dance Hall Committee of San Francisco of California Civic League of Women Voters, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; A report from Public Dance Hall Committee of San Francisco Civic League of Voters states: 
{{blockquote|In September, 1913, the Police Commissioner prohibited dancing in any cafe, restaurant, or saloon where liquor was sold. This resolution wiped out dancing on the "Coast"[Barbary Coast] and resulted in the appearance of the so-called 'closed' hall in the districts adjoining. There the girls were employed to dance with men patrons on a commission basis and salary. These halls had continuous dancing with practically no rest periods, and made large profits. Patrons paid ten cents for each dance, lasting less than two minutes. About six hundred girls were employed in these closed dance halls.&lt;ref&gt;Report of Public Dance Hall Committee of San Francisco of California Civic League of Women Voters, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Inside a closed dance hall, a dancer would earn her income by the number of tickets she could collect in exchange for dances. The management would typically pay the girls half the price of a dance ticket. With the closed dance hall, the centerpiece of the taxi dance hall—the ''ticket-a-dance'' system—was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Community groups began to oppose the closed dance halls, and in response to this growing political threat, these early taxi dance halls began to disguise themselves as dance schools. In 1921 the police commission ruled against employment of women as taxi dancers, and San Francisco's taxi dance halls were permanently shut down.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time that San Francisco's taxi dance halls were being shut down, the taxi dance hall was being reinvented in differing formats elsewhere in America. Dance academies, which were struggling to survive, began to consider the ticket-a-dance system.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Previous to the ticket-a-dance system, dance schools would use the ''line up plan'' to provide dance partners for their students. Female dance instructors would get in a line, and students would then dance with the next instructor in line. Students were not allowed to choose a female dance instructor for their practice dances.

The first instance of the ticket-a-dance system in [[Chicago]] came from a description, given by Godfrey Johnson of Mader-Johnson Dance Studios: 
{{blockquote|I was in New York during the summer of 1919, and while there visited a new studio opened by Mr. W___ W___ of San Francisco, where he had introduced a ten-cent-ticket-a-dance plan. When I got home I kept thinking of that plan as a way to get my advanced students to come back more often and to have experience dancing with different instructors. So I decided to put a ten-cent-a-lesson system in the big hall on the third floor of my building... But I soon noticed that it wasn't my former pupils who were coming up to dance, but a rough hoodlum element from Clark Street... Things went from bad to worse; I did the best I could to keep the hoodlums in check.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other dance schools began to try the ticket-a-dance system as well. As a former proprietor of the Colonial Dancing Academy in Chicago states: 
{{blockquote|I took over the ten-cent-a-lesson idea from Johnson... Before long I began to notice that many men who came were already good dancers. When I realized that these fellows were coming back all the time just to get somebody to dance with, I laughed out loud. Up to that time I wouldn't have believed that there were fellows who would be willing to pay as much as they did -- just to get a chance to dance... Sometimes I noticed that certain fellows always wanted to dance with certain girls, but I wouldn't allow that, except as they took the instructor at an hourly rate... I only ran the hall a year, but all the time I thought of it as a dancing school—not a place to rent a dance partner.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many dance academy proprietors, who were disturbed by the "hoodlum element" that the ticket-a-dance system attracted, were very reluctant to adopt the dance tickets. But a Greek immigrant, Nicholas Philocrates, perceived the power of this opportunity, and fully embraced the ticket-a-dance plan that he had seen on the West Coast in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Philocrates said: 
{{blockquote|When I was in Chicago in 1920 after a trip to the West Coast I decided to open a school of my own. I visited the different schools, and found that Mr. Swanson at the Colonial Dancing Academy was the only one conducting one of the lesson-ticket plans... I knew of the ticket-a-lesson plan as it was used on the Pacific Coast—I visited some of the halls out there—and so I knew that the idea of having pupils select their own instructors would work all right, when people got used to it.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Though Philocrates describes his dance hall as a "school", he would soon be followed by other Greek immigrants who would open other taxi dance halls in Chicago that did not provide any instruction whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians consider Philocrates to be the father of the taxi dance hall.

===Public ballrooms===
Also at that time, many large cities like Chicago had large public ballrooms. The public ballrooms were struggling to survive, as they had difficulty attracting as many female patrons as male patrons.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Partially due to the large immigrant populations of that time, many of the neighborhoods where taxi dance halls would compete with public ballrooms had five times as many men as women.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 5, 288.&lt;/ref&gt; While the public ballrooms had few women and many might refuse to dance, the taxi dance halls had many eager female dance partners who would agree to "dance with all-comers" that held dance tickets. The new competition of the increasingly popular taxi-dance halls would cause many ballrooms to either adopt the ticket-a-dance system or go out of business.

===Rise and fall from popularity===

Taxi dance halls flourished in America during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1931 there were over 100 taxi dance halls in [[New York City]], and between 35,000 and 50,000 men would go to these halls every week.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald VanderKooi, University of Illinois at Chicago Circle,  March 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also establishments which offered male professional dancers to women such as Maxim's in New York, where dancer/actor [[Rudolph Valentino]] got an early start.&lt;ref name=embezzler&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/feature/38/ |title=Embezzler Of Hearts |last=Robinson |first=David |date=June 2004 |publisher=Sight &amp; Sound |accessdate=2008-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022023833/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/feature/38/ |archivedate=2008-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1925, the taxi dance halls were coming under attack by reform movements that insisted on licensing, police supervision, and succeeded in closing down some taxi dance halls for lewd behavior. After [[World War II]] the popularity of taxi dance halls began to diminish. In the 1930s, 50 cities had taxi dance halls, but by 1954 that number dropped to just 6 cities. Only ten taxi-dance halls remained in New York City by 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Clyde Vedder, "Decline of the Taxi-Dance Hall", ''Sociology and Social Research'', 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the taxi-dance halls disappeared by the 1960s. Many historians say that the return of the saloon and the cocktail lounge of post-Prohibition America contributed to the demise of the taxi dance hall.

Today some cities still have clubs where female employees can be hired to dance with patrons. These clubs no longer use the ''ticket-a-dance'' system, but have [[Time clock|time-clocks]] and [[Time card|punch-cards]] that allow the patron to pay for the dancer's time by the minute. The clock used by the cashier to determine the cost of time spent with a hostess is often set a few minutes later than the clock used to print the checkout time on the ticket, thus fraudulently increasing revenues for the establishment and hostess alike.  Particularly accommodating hostesses often expect tips equivalent to the amount charged for their time. Some of these modern dance clubs exist in the same buildings where taxi dancing was done in the early 20th century. The ''Dreamland'' club of [[Los Angeles]] was such an establishment. In the 1930s it was called Roseland Roof, and was owned by the Fenton brothers. When the Fenton brothers sold the club in 1981, the new buyers renamed the club to Dreamland, and continued taxi dancing in its original ballroom. These latter day establishments, including Starlight and Fantasy, are called ''Hostess Clubs''.&lt;ref name="stranger"&gt;Evan Wright, [http://www.laweekly.com/news/dance-with-a-stranger-2130263 "Dance With A Stranger"], ''LA Weekly'', January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patrons==

Paul G. Cressey's book, entitled ''The Taxi-Dance Hall: A Sociological Study in Commercialized Recreation and City Life'', gives a history of [[taxi dance hall]]s, with interviews with taxi dancers and patrons. Cressey describes the phenomena as in terms of the human needs of American city dwellers in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; He listed nine categories to describe the types of patrons:

*Racial or ethnic groups denied acceptance elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Caucasian immigrants, frequently from a European country. Italians, Poles, Greeks, and Jews predominated.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 110-114.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Older men, approaching fifty, who want to rival younger men in courting young women. They were sometimes divorced, widowers, or deserters.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 114-117.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Married men whose marriages are suffering, seeking clandestine adventures.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 117-120.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lonely, isolated strangers who might be from a rural area or smaller city, and are new to the ways of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 120-121.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The footloose globetrotter who has a very mobile lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 121-123.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''slummer'', men of higher incomes who wish to see how the other half lives.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 123-126.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Men who suffer from physical abnormalities or [[Disability|disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 126-128.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''fugitive'', someone who might have a criminal background or suffers from local condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 128-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cressey goes on to describes the male patrons of taxi dance halls as being a varied and occasionally motley crew: 
{{blockquote|Young men and boisterous youths...gray-haired men in their sixties...brown skinned Filipinos...Chinese waiters...pudgy men of forty or fifty who dance awkwardly...rough and ready fellows who seem unable to assimilate completely some of the modes of city life...a few spectacled well groomed middle-aged men who move quietly, politely...and finally, there are a few men, handicapped by physical disabilities, for whom the taxi dancer's obligation to accept all-comers makes the establishment a haven of refuge. The dwarfed, maimed, and pock-marked all find social acceptance here; and together with the other variegated types they make of the institution a picturesque and rather pathetic revelation of human nature and city life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Goalby Cressey|title=The Taxi-Dance Hall: A Sociological Study in Commercialized Recreation and City Life|date=2008|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=9780226120515|page=10|edition=reprint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J-2WzYXRehQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In general, patrons were rarely businessmen or professional people, but were typically skilled or semi-skilled workers from the lower middle class. Frequently the patrons experienced social obstacles that prevented them from seeking feminine company through more traditional means. For the socially ostracized, the taxi dance hall became oasis where they could temporarily experience a sense of equality, recognition, and sometimes a fantasy of romance.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 129-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

For others of a more individualized nature, the taxi dance hall became an interesting diversion that allowed dancing and feminine company without the restrictions of more traditional customs. Cressey interviews a patron [case #42] who describes:
{{blockquote|I'm in and out of the city quite a good deal. I usually spend about two weeks a month in Chicago, and when I'm in the city I often come here. This hall has the finest girls of any in the city. Many of them are very nice girls and some are positively beautiful. I don't believe I'd enjoy the Lonesome Club. There aren't any attractive girls over there. Much of my enjoyment in dancing comes from being near a beautiful young girl who is graceful in her movements and is a good dancer. I only really enjoy being among young people and these are the only ones I have a chance to meet and know. Associating with them helps keep me young. Just to associate with these hopeful and enthusiastic people young people a few hours a week is better than any tonic{{nbsp}}...No, I don't attempt to secure dates with these girls. They aren't interested in a man of my age. However, that doesn't keep me from enjoying them here{{nbsp}}... I don't feel out of place here. As a matter of fact, I really enjoy my dancing here more than I would at some important social gathering. When I was operating my clothing factory in New York City, and my wife was living, I used to go out in society quite a little. But there were always some restraints. At a social function I had to dance with certain women, not because they were good dancers or were attractive women, but because they were the wives of some friends of mine or of someone else who was influential. But at this establishment I don't have to dance with a girl unless she is attractive to me, and I can stop dancing whenever I want—and there are no further obligations. A man is absolutely free here{{nbsp}}... But even if I could arrange it [a date to dance with],  I'm not certain I would want to. It would involve some social responsibilities I might not want to assume.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey (1932), p. 135-136.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Backgrounds of the dancers===

During the 1920s the ages of taxi dancers ranged from 15 to 28 years, and two-thirds of taxi dancers came from homes in which the financial support of a father had been removed. They were occasionally runaways from their families, and it was not unusual for taxi dancers to be from homes where the parents had separated. And despite their young age, two-fifths of taxi dancers had been previously married, but were no longer.

Many times the dancers were immigrants from European countries such as Poland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, and France. Various cultural conflicts would arise between parents and their dancing offspring, especially if the parents were from rural areas. For dancers of an immigrant family, the dancer was often the financial support of the family. When a girl supplanted the parent or parents as [[breadwinner]], sometimes the dancer would assume an aggressive role in the family by "subordinating the parental standards to her own requirements and demands".

These conflicts in values between dancers and their parents frequently caused the dancers to lead so-called "double lives", denying that they worked at a taxi-dance hall. To further this divide, the girls would sometimes adopt aliases so that their activities might not reach their families' ears. When parents found out, there were three typical outcomes—the girl gave up her dancing career, the girl left home and became estranged from the family, or the family accepted the girl's conduct, however reluctantly, due to financial necessity.

Despite the frequent hardships, many of the dancers seemed to enjoy the lifestyle as they adopted a pursuit of what Cressey calls "money, excitement, and affection". Within his book, Cressey gives scores of quotes from taxi dancers who speak very favorably about their experiences at a taxi-dance hall.

One dancer [case #15] from the 1920s describes her start at a taxi-dance hall.
{{blockquote|I was working as a waitress in a Loop restaurant for about a month. I never worked in a dance hall like this and didn't know about them. One day the "boss" of this hall was eating in the restaurant and told me I could make twice as much money in his "dancing school." I went there one night to try it – and then quit my job at the restaurant. I always liked to dance anyway, so it was really fun.}}

And yet another dancer from Chicago [case #11] spoke very positively of her experiences:
{{blockquote|After I had gotten started at the dance hall I enjoyed the life too much to want to give it up. It was easy work, gave me more money than I could earn any other way, and I had a chance to meet all kinds of people. I had no dull moments. I met bootleggers, rum-runners, hijackers, stick-up men, globe-trotters, and hobos. There were all different kinds of men, different from the kind I'd be meeting if I'd stayed at home with my folks in [[Rogers Park, Chicago|Rogers Park]]... After a girl starts in the dance hall and makes good it's easy to live for months without ever getting outside the influence of the dance hall. Take myself for instance: I lived with other dance-hall girls, met my fellows at the dance hall, got my living in the dance hall. In fact, there was nothing I wanted that I couldn't get through it. It was an easy life, and I just drifted along with the rest. I suppose if something hadn't come along to jerk me out, I'd still be a drifter out on the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]].}}

===Vocabulary of the dancers===

The special vocabulary of the dancers is not only a form of communication, but also helps describe the dancers as it reflects their judgments, activities, and interests. Here are some example that Cressey lists in his book.

* ''Black and Tan'' – A colored and white cabaret
* ''Buying the groceries'' – Living in a clandestine relationship
* ''Class'' – Term used by Filipinos to denote the taxi-dance halls
* ''Fish'' – A man whom the girls can easily exploit for personal gain
* ''Fruit'' – An easy mark
* ''Hot stuff'' – Stolen goods
* ''Make'' – To secure a date with
* ''Mark'' – A person who is gullible and easily taken advantage of
* ''Monkey-chaser'' – A man interested in a taxi dancer or [[Chorus line|chorus girl]]
* ''Monkey shows'' – [[Burlesque]] shows with chorus girls
* ''Nickel-hopper'' – A taxi dancer
* ''On the ebony'' – A taxi-dance hall or taxi dancer having social contacts with men of races other than white
* ''Opera'' – Burlesque show
* ''Paying the rent'' – Living in a clandestine relationship
* ''Picking up'' – Securing an after-dance engagement with a taxi dancer
* ''Playing'' – Successfully exploiting one of the opposite sex
* ''Professional'' – A government investigator. One visiting the taxi-dance hall for ulterior purposes
* ''Punk'' – A novitiate; an uninitiated youth or young girl, usually referring to an unsophisticated taxi dancer
* ''Racket'' – A special enterprise to earn money, honestly or otherwise
* ''Shakedown'' – Enforced exaction of graft

==Cultural forces==

At the start of the 20th century, the [[United States]] would for the first time have more inhabitants living within its cities than in rural and small-town areas. Cities were experiencing extreme growth; indeed, Chicago's population doubled between 1900 and 1930. Many young men and women were leaving their rural and small-town neighborhoods for the same promise of adventure that the Old West had previously provided. At this time, America was experiencing a flood of male-dominated immigration.

Entertainment in America's cities was becoming a big business. New forms of mass entertainment were the baseball stadium, the football stadium, the amusement park, and the motion picture theater. Cressey and other sociologists like [[Ernest W. Burgess]] came to see taxi dance halls, and these other new forms of mass entertainment, as "commercializing the ''human interest in stimulation''".

For this uprooted culture, cities provided a type of ''anonymity'' that was not found in their previous rural and family-oriented neighborhoods. Once inside a city, young men and women were free to do as they pleased without moral criticism from their families or neighbors. Cressey felt that cities became "inhabited by rootless, detached people who connect with each other primarily on the basis of mutual exploitation". The taxi dance hall was just such a place where very different people from very different backgrounds—patrons and dancers—would meet for temporary and unlikely alliances. Frequently inside the taxi dance hall, the human needs of unassimilated males would meet the economic needs of taxi dancers.

Near the time when Cressey finished his book in 1932, he noticed reform movements were attempting to shut down the taxi dance halls.&lt;ref&gt;Freeland (2009), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Cressey was disturbed by the fact that if taxi dance halls were eliminated without appropriate substitutes, the human needs that fueled the phenomenon would go unanswered and possibly find self-destructive forms of expression. For Cressey, the taxi dance hall became a symptom of the isolation, loneliness, and alienation that plagues many cities.

== Lap dancing==

Taxi dancing is often viewed as the parent phenomenon of [[lap dancing]], and indeed there are many similarities.&lt;ref name="Judith Lynne Hanna 2012, p. 136"&gt;Judith Lynne Hanna, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1sEza-K-A8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT148#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Naked Truth: Strip Clubs, Democracy, and a Christian Right''], University of Texas Press, 2012, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Like the taxi dancer, the lap dancer provides her service only for the length of a single song.&lt;ref&gt;Freeland (2009), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; It also received complaints from the community—bringing up the same controversies concerning morality, touching, and government regulation. However, decades after the taxi dance halls of the 1920s had been maligned by reformists, a California State judge in 1999 overruled a law prohibiting taxi dancing while stating that "taxi dancing is an established tradition in America that has gone on since the 1920s".&lt;ref name="Judith Lynne Hanna 2012, p. 136"/&gt;

The "fantasy of romance" also plays a role in both taxi dancing and lap dancing. Edward Fenton, a former owner of a large taxi dance hall, Roseland Roof, was interviewed in 1999 about the taxi dancing scene during the 1930s. When asked about the taxi dancers' patrons, Fenton replied: "The customer was lonely, that's the word. The club brought in lonesome people. They came here to meet with girls and carry on a secret romance". But when asked if he was implying that the customers had sexual affairs with the taxi dancers, Fenton replied: "No. I didn't say that...  the customer lived in a ''fantasy''."&lt;ref name="stranger"/&gt; Similarly, today's patrons of lap dancing sometimes discuss their experiences within Internet forums, and even a quick read of these forums reveals that they also sometimes have feelings of romance for dancers whom they refer to as an ATF, an acronym for ''All Time Favorite''.&lt;ref name=sfredbook1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.myredbook.com/cgi-bin/dcforum2/dcboard.pl?az=list&amp;forum=DCForumID11&amp;conf=rb |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-06-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114131452/http://forum.myredbook.com/cgi-bin/dcforum2/dcboard.pl?az=list&amp;forum=DCForumID11&amp;conf=rb |archivedate=2007-11-14 |df= }}, Strip Club Forum, ''myRedBook'', November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
During a 2002 interview for San Francisco Magazine, a lap dancer for the [[Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre | Mitchell Brothers strip club]] described the mindset of some patrons:  
{{blockquote|Some of these guys became totally obsessed with the dancers and didn't care that it was a completely unhealthy relationship. At the sfRedBook.com message board, sometimes a guy will go on there and say, "''Oh, I really think I'm really in love with this dancer''", and another guy goes, "''Come on, buddy, the sooner you face up to the fact you're a PL [pathetic loser], the better off you'll be''."   ...They had all this money and power and they thought, "''Oh, I can buy the woman of my dreams now''." And they could. But it wasn't real.&lt;ref name=dotcomStripper&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanfran.com/features/transcripts/Rebecca_Wilson.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-06-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603130113/http://www.sanfran.com/features/transcripts/Rebecca_Wilson.html |archivedate=2004-06-03 |df= }}, The Dot-Com Stripper, Jack Boulware, ''San Francisco Magazine'', April 2002&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sociologist Paul Cressey may have prophesied the invention of lap dancing some 80 years ago when he suggested that if taxi dancing were to be eliminated, the human needs that fueled the phenomenon would go unanswered and find more extreme forms of expression.

'''''The Andy Warhol Diaries''''' is the dictated memoirs of the American artist [[Andy Warhol]], [[posthumous work|posthumously published]]. It was edited by his frequent collaborator and long-time friend, Pat Hackett. [[Warner Books]] first published it in 1989 with an introduction by Hackett.

The 807-page book begins on November 24, 1976 and ends eleven years later on February 17, 1987, just five days before his death. It is a condensed version by Hackett of Warhol's more than 20,000 page diary.

==History==
Beginning in the fall of 1976, Monday through Friday, Warhol and Hackett talked by phone each morning around 9:00 a.m. and he spoke to her about the events of the previous day. Weekend entries were done the following Monday in a longer session. Hackett transcribed his monologue onto a legal pad. Later in the morning she would use a typewriter to create the diary pages. "But whatever its broader objective," Hackett writes, "its narrow one, to satisfy tax auditors, was always on Andy's mind." The [[Internal Revenue Service]] [[income tax audit|audited]] Warhol annually.

''The Andy Warhol Diaries'' was published in 1989, after Warhol's death in February 1987, without an index. Subsequently, unauthorized indexes were published by ''[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]'' and ''[[Fame (magazine)|Fame]]'' magazines. Newer editions of the book contain an authorized index.

'''''The Beatles Anthology''''' is a [[television documentary]], a three-volume set of double albums, and a book focusing on the history of [[the Beatles]]. [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]] all participated in the making and approval of the works, which are sometimes referred to collectively as the ''Anthology'' project, while [[John Lennon]] had archival interviews.

The documentary series was first broadcast in November 1995, with expanded versions released on [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]] in 1996 and on [[DVD]] in 2003. The documentary used interviews with the Beatles and their associates to narrate the history of the band as seen through archival footage and performances. The [[The Beatles Anthology (book)|''Anthology'' book]], released in 2000, paralleled the documentary in presenting the group's history through quotes from interviews.

The initial volume of the album set (''[[Anthology 1]]'') was released the same week of the documentary's airdate, with the subsequent two volumes (''[[Anthology 2]]'' and ''[[Anthology 3]]'') released in 1996. They included unreleased performances and outtakes presented in roughly chronological order, along with two new songs based on demo tapes recorded by Lennon after the group broke up: "[[Free as a Bird]]" and "[[Real Love (Beatles song)|Real Love]]", both produced by [[Jeff Lynne]].

==Documentary series==
{{Main|The Beatles Anthology (TV series)}}
Approximately coinciding with the release of the "[[Free as a Bird]]" single and ''[[Anthology 1]]'' album (the first of three double-CD albums), ''The Beatles Anthology'' series of documentaries was broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in the United Kingdom and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television in the United States in 1995. The ''Anthology'' series takes a form similar to that of the ''Anthology'' book, by being a series of first-person accounts by the Beatles themselves, with no external "objective" narration.  Footage in the ''Anthology'' series features [[voice-over]] recordings of all four Beatles to push the narrative of the story, with contributions from their producer, road manager and others. As well as telling their story through archival footage, [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]] appear in interview segments recorded exclusively for the series; [[John Lennon]] appears only in historic archival footage.  The Beatles' wives, past and present, do not appear (excluding archival footage such as video from India and the music video for Harrison's song "Something").

The series, which was made over five thousand hours of planning and production, is composed of numerous film clips and interviews that present a complete history of the band from the Beatles' own personal perspectives. When it aired on ABC, the series comprised six hour-long programs, aired on three nights in November 1995. The series was later released, as eight expanded episodes, on VHS, laserdisc and as a boxed set of five DVDs (4 discs with 2 episodes apiece and a disc of extras).

Air dates on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]:

* Sunday, 19 November 1995: 9–11 p.m.
* Wednesday, 22 November 1995: 9–11 p.m.
* Thursday, 23 November 1995: 9–11 p.m.

Part 1 of the series drew 17 million households,&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;Kaltenbach, Chris. "[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-12-03/news/1995337214_1_beatles-anthology-part-2 Beatles' appeal appears limited Ho-hum: Millions of people tuned in to the three-part 'Anthology' on ABC, but many more were watching other shows]." ''The Baltimore Sun''. 1995-12-03. Retrieved 2015-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning an average of 27.3 million viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-29/entertainment/ca-8209_1_beatles-anthology|title=TV Ratings :  'Beatles' Fades; 'Football,' With Elvis, Is No. 1|first=LEE|last=MARGULIES|date=29 November 1995|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was much better than usual for ABC at the time, but behind most broadcasts of ''[[Friends]]'' on [[NBC]],&lt;ref name="sun" /&gt; which in its second season was averaging 29.4 million viewers per episode.

In promoting the series during this time, ABC identified itself as "A-Beatles-C" – an homage to the mid-1960s [[Cousin Felica]]-era "77 W-A-Beatles-C" call sign of the network's flagship NYC AM radio station – and several of the network's prime-time sitcoms replaced their regular opening credit themes with Beatles tracks.

==Albums==
{{Main|Anthology 1|Anthology 2|Anthology 3}}
To accompany the ''Anthology'' series, three albums were issued, each containing two CDs or three vinyl LPs of mostly never-before-released Beatles material (the exceptions being the Tony Sheridan-era material), although many of the tracks had appeared on [[Bootleg recording|bootlegs]] for many years prior.

Two days after the first television special in the series had aired, ''[[Anthology 1]]'' was released to stores, and included music recorded by [[the Quarrymen]], the famous [[Decca Records]] [[The Decca audition|audition tapes]], and various out-takes and demos from the band's first four albums. It also included the song "Lend Me Your Comb", omitted from the collection ''[[Live at the BBC (The Beatles album)|Live at the BBC]]'', released the previous year (1994). The song "[[Free as a Bird]]" was included at the very start. 450,000 copies of ''Anthology 1'' were sold in its first day of release, the most sales for an album in a single day ever. The band's first drummer [[Pete Best]], replaced by Ringo Starr in 1962 before the Beatles recorded professionally for EMI, received his first substantial Beatles royalties from this album, for the inclusion of early demo tracks on which he played.

''[[Anthology 2]]'' was released on 17 March 1996. The second collection presented out-takes and demos from the Beatles' sessions for ''[[Help!]]'', ''[[Rubber Soul]]'', ''[[Revolver (The Beatles album)|Revolver]]'', ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' and ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (album)|Magical Mystery Tour]]''. These included selected early demos and takes for Lennon's "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]", previously available only to bootleg collectors. The new song "[[Real Love (John Lennon song)|Real Love]]" – which, like "Free as a Bird", was based on an unfinished Lennon recording – was also included in the two-CD collection.

''[[Anthology 3]]'' was released on 28 October 1996. The third collection featured out-takes and demos from ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' ("White Album"), ''[[Abbey Road]]'' and ''[[Let It Be]]'', as well as several songs from Harrison and McCartney which later became post-Beatle tracks.

===Collage===
[[File:Anthology cover collage.jpg|center|Collage of the three covers of ''The Beatles Anthology'', created by [[Klaus Voormann]].]]

The three album covers, when laid side-by-side, become one long painted collage of various peeling posters and album covers representing the different stages of the Beatles' career. This was the work of [[Klaus Voormann]], who also created the album cover for ''Revolver'' in 1966. The ''Anthology'' covers required Voormann to recreate elements of his cover for ''Revolver'' within the collage. During the music video for "[[Free as a Bird]]", the ''Anthology'' collage appears as posters on a shop window as the camera pans quickly across the street. The design also adorned the VHS, [[laserdisc]] and DVD releases, again to be properly encountered by laying the cases side-by-side.  Upon the release of ''Anthology 3'', [[HMV]] stores made available a limited edition cardboard sleeve designed to hold all three CD volumes of which each side of the sleeve make up half of the collage.

===Digital release and ''Anthology Highlights''===
All three albums were made digitally available on the [[iTunes]] Store on 14 June 2011, alongside a new ''Anthology Highlights'' album which featured a selection of tracks from all three albums and reached number 184 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s United States [[Billboard charts#Albums|Top Current Albums]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/charts/2011-07-02/current-albums|title=Top Current Albums|date=2 July 2011|website=[[Billboard.biz]]|accessdate=12 October 2018|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book==
{{Main|The Beatles Anthology (book)}}

[[File:erw.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of ''The Beatles Anthology'' paperback book]]

In October 2000, ''The Beatles Anthology'' book was released, which included interviews with all four band members and others involved, plus rare photos. Many of the interviews quoted are from those featured in the documentary films. The book is designed as a large-format hardback, with imaginative artwork throughout, and several visually impressive and colourful spreads featuring graphics relevant to the proceeding chronology, photographic arrays and a variety of text styles and layouts. The book went straight to the top of the ''[[New York Times]]'' bestsellers list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawes.com/2000/2000-10-22.pdf The ''New York Times'' Best Seller List - 22 October 2000]. From Hawes.com&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the book was released as a large-format paperback.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/2002/12/08/the-beatles-anthology-publish/5881b4c7-2dd0-445b-8fbe-f4ce665d6c3c/&lt;/ref&gt;

During early 1995 as work on ''The Beatles Anthology'' continued, [[Yoko Ono]] and McCartney recorded an [[avant-garde]] piece called "Hiroshima Sky Is Always Blue". Ono provided vocals and McCartney played bass, while [[Sean Lennon]], [[Linda McCartney]], and McCartney's children played various instruments. The piece was broadcast on Japanese public television in memory of the 50th anniversary of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A new song for history |date=4 August 1995 |agency=AP |newspaper=Times Daily |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PV8eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=E8kEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2618,562306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The track "[[Carnival of Light]]" recorded during the ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' sessions was intended to be released on the ''[[Anthology 2]]'' album, but was vetoed by George Harrison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/carnival-of-light/2/ |title=Carnival of Light |publisher=The Beatles Bible |date= |accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that McCartney, Harrison and Starr worked on a new composition called "All for Love" in March 1995, intended as a track on ''Anthology 3'', but the effort was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/news/411allforlove.html |title=More on "All For Love" -- what Paul really said (with pictures) |publisher=Abbeyrd.best.vwh.net |date= |accessdate=20 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128100439/http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/news/411allforlove.html |archivedate=28 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; No version of the song has reached the public.

==Promotional items==
Each of the three ''Anthology'' albums was accompanied by a promotional CD sampler sent to radio stations shortly before the official release dates. These CDs have since become highly sought collector's items. Even rarer is a vinyl version of the sampler for ''Anthology 2'', which was only sent to college radio stations and featured a different cover (though the contents were the same).

In October 1996 there was a strictly limited release from [[EMI]], a slip case cover to house all three CD volumes, which have since become extremely rare, fetching high prices among collectors.

==Parodies==
The success of the ''Anthology'' albums was parodied by the release of the [[The Rutles|Rutles]]' ''[[The Rutles Archaeology|Archaeology]]'' some months later. Delays in the release of the third volume of the Beatles' series ultimately meant that the Rutles' parody arrived in shops on the same day as its inspiration.

[["Weird Al" Yankovic]] parodied ''The Beatles Anthology'' in an ''[[Al TV]]'' special. He said he had a copy of a fictional ''Anthology 17'', which he claimed would not be available to the public for a while. He played for the audience a track of Paul McCartney brushing his teeth and Ringo Starr shaving before ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.

''The Beatles Anthology'' was also parodied on the short-lived ''[[Dana Carvey Show]]'', which was being aired on [[ABC Television Network|ABC]] around the same time that ''Anthology'' was being televised on the network.

"'''The Esoteric Character of the Gospels'''" is an article published in three parts: in November-December 1887, and in February 1888, in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] magazine [[Lucifer (magazine)|''Lucifer'']]; it was written by [[Helena Blavatsky]].{{refn|group=note|''Lucifer,'' Vol. 1, November 1887, p. 173–80; December 1887, p. 299–309; February 1888, p. 490–96.{{sfn|Index}}}} It was included in the 8th volume of the author's ''Collected Writings.''{{sfn|Price|1985}} In 1888, for this work, the author was awarded [[Tallapragada Subba Row|Subba Row]] medal.{{sfn|Theowiki}}{{refn|group=note|When the [[Theosophical Society]] was created, the encouraging of "the study of [[comparative religion]], philosophy, and science" was proclaimed his second major task.{{sfn|Kuhn|1992}}}}

== Analysis of contents ==
=== Versus clerics ===
An American author [[Gary Lachman]], noting Blavatsky's "animus toward the Judeo-Christian ethos," has cited her article in which she writes that "[[Christianity]] is now the religion of arrogance ''par excellence,'' a stepping-stone for ambition, a sinecure for wealth, sham and power; a convenient screen for hypocrisy."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=176|Lachman|2012|2p=112}} A Russian Indologist [[Alexander Senkevich]] has noted that she did not make secrets out of her "skeptical attitude towards the [[Gospel]]s," considering them unrelated to either [[Jesus]] or his [[Apostles]].{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=297}}{{refn|group=note|Noting in church Christianity the dogmatism generated by the "painful ambition of its hierarchs," Blavatsky regarded it exclusively as a religious sanctification of "power over people."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=298}}}} Joseph Tyson wrote in his book that, according to Blavatsky, for example, in the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] camp there are 350 dissenting [[sect]]s, and she commented that if "one of these may have the approximate truth, still 349 must be necessarily false."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=175|Tyson|2006|2p=384}} A Russian philosopher Lydia Fesenkova wrote that, in Blavatsky's opinion, the Christian sacred books are "magazines of falsehoods," and all of them have served {{quote|"as a means for securing power and of supporting the ambitious policy of an unscrupulous priesthood. All have promoted superstition, all made of their gods blood-thirsty and ever-damning Molochs and fiends, as all have made nations to serve the latter more than the God of Truth."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1pp=179–80|Фесенкова|2001|2p=18}}}}

Professor [[Robert Ellwood]] wrote that Blavatsky was a ruthless critic of the church tradition of Christianity, whether in relation to "the [[Church Fathers]] or modern priests, pastors and missionaries." The reason for her hostility to church Christianity "was what she perceived as arrogance combined with misplaced concreteness." She believed that "churchmen, past and present, whether through intentional deceit or mere stupidity, had concealed the real origin and meaning of Christianity as a vehicle of the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|ancient wisdom]]."{{sfn|Ellwood}}

=== Historical Jesus ===
A Russian orthodox theologian, Dimitry Drujinin wrote that in her article Blavatsky calls [[Lod|Lüd]] as the "hometown" of Jesus. This indicates that she supported the statements of [[Talmud]] that Jesus was the [[Yeshu|son of a man named Pandira]] and "lived a hundred years before the beginning of the Gospel events." In his youth, he lived for many years in Egypt, where he "was initiated" in esoteric wisdom. After returning to Palestine, he reorganized the movement of the [[Essenes]], who worshipped him as a teacher. Slandered by his enemies, he was killed in his hometown. Drujinin quotes the article with "He was stoned and then crucified on a tree, on the eve of [[Passover]]."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=189|Дружинин|2012|2p=68}}

=== Chrestos and Christos ===
Drujinin wrote that, according to Blavatsky, it is necessary to distinguish between Chrêstos and [[Christ (title)|Christos]] (Christ). The first name, in hers opinion, means neophyte who approaching to Initiation, and the second one she defines in this way: "Christ— the true esoteric [[Salvation in Christianity|'''Saviour''']]—is no man, but the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|'''Divine Principle''']] in every human being."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=173|Дружинин|2012|2p=66}}{{refn|group=note|"'''Chrestes''', '''Chrestos''' (Greek). Applied by the Greeks as a title of respect equivalent to 'the worthy.' Chrestes meant an interpreter of oracles. In the language of the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Mysteries]], a chrestos was a candidate or neophyte, and a christos (anointed) was an initiate. Christ is a mystical expression for the human [[Ātman (Hinduism)|inner god]], while chrest is the good but as yet unregenerated nature."{{sfn|Glossary|1999|loc=Chrestes}}}} Drujinin added that she believes that Christians have lost the understanding of the true meaning of the word Christos: "The very meaning of the terms Chrêstos and Christos, and the bearing of both on 'Jesus of Nazareth,' a name coined out of Joshua the Nazar, has now become a dead letter for all with the exception of non-Christian Occultists."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=215|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}} He wrote that Christians, according to Blavatsky, only afterwards unfairly put aside "all the other Chrêstoi, who have appeared to them as rivals of their Man-God."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=205|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}} The Russian ''Encyclopedia of Sages, Mystics, and Magicians'' wrote that in her article Blavatsky "allegorically" proclaims: "Christos was 'the '''Way''',' while Chrêstos was the lonely traveller journeying on to reach the ultimate goal through that 'Path,' which goal was Christos, the glorified Spirit of ''''Truth'''.'"{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=189|Беренс|2003|2p=64}} In a like manner Drujinin has quoted hers article: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"To the true follower of the '''Spirit of Truth''', it matters little, therefore, whether Jesus, as man and Chrêstos, lived during the era called Christian, or before, or never lived at all. The Adepts, who lived and died for humanity, have existed in many and all the ages."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=204|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tyson wrote that "sanctification," in Blavatsky's opinion, "was ever the synonym (for) the '[[Mahatma|Mahatmic]]-condition,' i.e., the union of the man with the divine principle (Augoeides) in him."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=190|Tyson|2006|2p=183}} In this connection, he has said that [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] friars "practiced fasting, celibacy, contemplative prayer, and charity in order to," as Blavatsky writes, "kill one's personality and its passions, to blot out... separateness from one's 'Father,' the Divine [[Spirit]] in man."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=201|Tyson|2006|2p=183}}

=== Esotericism in the Gospels ===
While studying the Theosophical doctrine, Drujinin has stated that Blavatsky considers the "story of Jesus Christ," which was told in the Gospels, as a fantasy. In support of this he has quoted hers article:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whence, then, the Gospels, the life of Jesus of Nazareth? Has it not been repeatedly stated that no human, mortal brain could have invented the life of the Jewish Reformer, followed by the awful drama on [[Calvary]]? We say on the authority of the [[esoteric]] Eastern School, that all this came from the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]], as far as the name [[Christ (title)|Christos]] and the astronomico-mystical allegories are concerned, and from the writings of the ancient [[Tannaim|Tanaïm]] as regards the [[Kabbalah|Kabalistic]] connection of Jesus or Joshua, with the Biblical personifications."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=210|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to French philosopher [[Édouard Schuré]], [[Esoteric Christianity|Christian esotericism]] in the Gospels is revealed if to approach them from the standpoint of the "[[Essenes|Essenian]] and Gnostic traditions."{{sfn|Schuré|1921}} A religious studies scholar [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Alvin Kuhn]] stated that the "Gospels" in ancient times were not "the biographies of one, or of any, living earthly person, but were held as the literary forms of a universal dramatical representation of the experience of our divine [[soul]]s in the mortal body here on earth."{{sfn|Kuhn|1990|p=9}}

== Criticism ==
This article by Blavatsky always aroused rejection on the part of those who professed the teachings of Jesus only literally.{{sfn|Cranston|1993}} Thus, a priest Drujinin ([[Russian Orthodox Church]]) claimed that the Theosophists "had reduced" Jesus Christ to the level of one of the Adepts and even generally questioned his existence.{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=68}} And moreover:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The founders of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] deny the importance of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's crucifixion]]. Recognizing within the framework of the concepts [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]] the possibility of paying by sufferings only for their own sins, they actually represent the sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ only as a tragicomic mistake."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=68}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On the other hand, Alvin Kuhn, being a supporter of [[Christ myth theory]], stated that esotericism "hung up midway" between recognizing the Gospels as documents of early Christian history or treating them as an allegory. He wrote that Blavatsky contributed to this "anomalous" situation: arguing in one place that "Christ— the true esoteric '''Saviour'''—is no man, but the '''Divine Principle''' in every human being,"{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=173|Kuhn|1990|2p=16}} she in another place supports a thesis about the real existence of the [[Master Jesus|Jewish Adept Jesus]]. Kuhn proclaimed: "The matter of the existence or non-existence of a certain man in human history is not dual in nature. Either Jesus, the Gospel Figure, was a person in human body, or he was not."{{sfn|Kuhn|1990|p=17}}

According to Ellwood, many of Blavatsky's "onslaughts" against Christianity, including her attacks on organizations that devoted themselves to "good works such as [[the Salvation Army]], were not always even-handed." Moreover, she apparently didn't know about the nascent [[Liberal Christianity|liberal branch of Christian theology]] — "[[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]], Coleridge, [[William Ellery Channing|Channing]], Kingsley and many others" who had nothing to do to the primitive "dogmatism she so hated." Nevertheless, her attacks on church Christianity can be seen as necessary to fulfill the task of the [[Theosophical Society]] connected with the formation of a "new spirituality based on an immanent universalism" which opposing [[Religious intolerance|aggressive religiosity]] "she saw all around, whether in European bishops or in missionaries abroad."{{sfn|Ellwood}}

'''''The Euro and the Battle of Ideas''''' is a book by [[Harold James (historian)|Harold James]], [[Princeton University Department of History|Professor of History]] at [[Princeton University]]; [[Markus Brunnermeier]], [[Princeton University Department of Economics|Professor of Economics]] at Princeton University; and [[Jean-Pierre Landau]], a former Deputy Governor of the [[Bank of France]], a member of the Board of Directors of the [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS). The book is about the philosophical differences between countries in the [[European Union]], particularly Germany and France, and how their contrasting outlooks on political philosophy have shaped the [[Eurozone]]. The book also provides context to how the ideas that led to the creation of the European Union have influenced and been influenced by ideas in the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), and the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB).

==Summary==

The book begins with the historical roots of German-French differences, highlighting the cultural and philosophical aspects which distinguish the two nations. Their divergent systems of philosophical thoughts have spurred differences in economic ideologies in regards to [[federalism]] versus [[centralism]], [[Monetary policy|monetary]] and [[Fiscal policy|fiscal policies]], and [[austerity]] versus [[Stimulus (economics)|stimulus]]. The authors argue that "there is no single, coherent economic philosophy within Europe. Rather, different nations have retained their own distinct economic philosophers and view European-level institutions--and ways to improve them--in this light."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=James |first1=Harold |last2=Brunnermeier |first2=Markus |last3=Landau |first3=Jean-Pierre |title=The Euro and the Battle of Ideas |date=2016 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books continus with an analysis on how these philosophies have manifested themselves in the European Union, mainly through the Maastricht negotiations and the commitment to a currency union. They expound upon the divergent ideas of economics and politics have contributed to different models of governance within Europe, and that "the German view and the French view actually need each other to be sustainable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=James |first1=Harold |last2=Brunnermeier |first2=Markus |last3=Landau |first3=Jean-Pierre |title=The Euro and the Battle of Ideas |date=2016 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
[[Ben Bernanke]], former [[Chairman of the federal reserve|Chairman]] of the [[U.S. Federal Reserve]] praised the book for its insightful contribution to the [[history of economics]]: "International divergences in economic policy are as much the result of differences in intellectual frameworks as of variation in economic circumstances. This valuable book explains the critical differences in national economic philosophies and how they have conditioned policy choices over the past decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Euro and the Battle of Ideas: Review |url=https://www.amazon.com/Euro-Battle-Ideas-Markus-Brunnermeier/dp/0691172927 |website=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lawrence Summers]], former [[Secretary of the U.S. Treasury]], claimed that "This is the best and most important book so far on an experiment with profound economic and geopolitical implications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Euro and the Battle of Ideas: Review |url=https://www.amazon.com/Euro-Battle-Ideas-Markus-Brunnermeier/dp/0691172927 |website=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The book has been a recipient of a number of awards, including ''[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg’s]]'' Best Books of 2017, ''[[Project Syndicate|Project Syndicate’s]]'' Best Reads in 2017 (chosen by Jean Pisani-Ferry), ''[[The Financial Times|The Financial Times']]'' Best Economics Books of 2016, and ''[[The Economist|The Economist’s]]'' Economics and Business Books of the Year 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Euro and the Battle of Ideas |url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10828.html |website=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Gingerbread Man''' (also known as '''The Gingerbread Boy''') is a [[Folklore|folktale]] about a [[gingerbread man]]'s escape from various pursuers and his eventual demise between the jaws of a [[fox]]. 
"The Gingerbread Boy "first appeared in print in the May, 1875, issue of ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]'' in a [[cumulative tale]] which, like "[[The Little Red Hen]]", depends on repetitious scenes featuring an ever-growing cast of characters for its effect.&lt;ref name=SLL&gt;[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/gingerbread/index.html SurLaLune: "The Annotated Gingerbread Man."] Retrieved 1 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the reteller of the tale, "A girl from Maine told it to my children. It interested them so much that I thought it worth preserving. I asked where she found it and she said an old lady told it to her in her childhood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Dodge |editor-first=Mary Mapes |editor-link=Mary Mapes Dodge |date=March 14, 2012 |title=St. Nicholas: A Monthly Magazine For Boys And Girls, Volume 2, Part 2... |url=
https://books.google.com/books?id=iqZNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA452 |publisher=Nabu Press |isbn=978-1277939439 |accessdate=December 2012 |page=452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1875 story ==
In the 1875 ''St. Nicholas'' tale, a childless old woman bakes a gingerbread man, who leaps from her oven and runs away. The woman and her husband give chase, but are unable to catch him. The gingerbread man then outruns several farm workers and farm animals, while taunting them with the phrase:

: I've run away from a little old woman,
: A little old man,

: And I can run away from you, I can!

The tale ends with a [[fox]] catching and eating the gingerbread man who cries as he is devoured, "I'm quarter gone...I'm half gone...I'm three-quarters gone...I'm all gone!"&lt;ref name=Ashliman_2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type2025.html#gingerbread |title=The Gingerbread Boy |author=&lt;!--author lost to history--&gt; |date=May 1875 |work=St. Nicholas |publisher=Scribner &amp; Company |accessdate=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations on the 1875 story==
The Gingerbread Man remains a common subject for American children's literature into the 21st century. The retellings often omit the original ending ("I'm quarter gone...I'm half gone...I'm three-quarters gone...I'm all gone!")&lt;ref name=SLL /&gt; and make other changes. In some variations, the fox feigns deafness, drawing the Gingerbread Man closer and closer. Then the fox snatches and devours him. In other versions, the Gingerbread Man halts in his flight at a riverbank, and after accepting the fox's offer to ferry him across, is convinced by the fox to move ever-forward toward the fox's mouth.

In some retellings, the Gingerbread Man taunts his pursuers with the famous line: 
: Run, run as fast as you can!
: You can't catch me. I'm the Gingerbread Man!

==Folk tales==
Folk tales of the runaway food type are found in Germany, the British Isles, and Eastern Europe, as well as the United States.&lt;ref name=ashliman_1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type2025.html |title=The Runaway Pancake: folktales of Aarne-Thompson-Uther type 2025 |author=D. L. Ashliman (editor/translator) |authorlink=D. L. Ashliman|date=2000–2010 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |accessdate=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Slavic Europe|Slavic]] lands, a traditional character known as [[Kolobok]] ({{lang-ru|Колобок}}) is a ball of bread dough who avoids being eaten by various animals (collected by [[Konstantin Ushinsky]] in ''Native Word (Rodnoye slovo)'' in 1864). "The Pancake"&lt;ref name=ashliman_1/&gt; ("Pannekaken") was collected by [[Peter Asbjornsen]] and [[Jorgen Moe]] and published in ''Norske Folkeeventyr'' (1842-1844), and, ten years later, the German brothers Carl and Theodor Colshorn collected "The Big, Fat Pancake"&lt;ref name=ashliman_1/&gt; ("Vom dicken fetten Pfannekuchen") from the Salzdahlum region and published the tale in ''Märchen und Sagen'', no. 57, ([[1854 in literature|1854]]). In [[1894 in literature|1894]], Karl Gander collected "The Runaway Pancake"&lt;ref name=ashliman_1/&gt; ("Der fortgelaufene Eierkuchen") from an Ögeln cottager and peddler and published the tale in ''Niederlausitzer Volkssagen, vornehmlich aus dem Stadt- und Landkreise Guben,'' no. 319. The Roule Galette story is a similar story from France.

An interesting variation of this trope is found in the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] tale "The Little Dumpling" ("A kis gömböc"), and contrary to the title the main character is not a dumpling, but the Hungarian version of [[head cheese]]. In the tale it is the gömböc that eats the others; it first consumes the family that "made" it, and then, rolling on the road, it eats various others – including a whole army – the last of whom is a swineherd. His knife opens the gömböc from the inside, and the people run home. In another variation the gömböc bursts after eating too many people. A similar Russian tale is called "The Clay Guy" ([[:ru:Глиняный парень|Глиняный парень]]). In it, an old childless couple make themselves a clay child, who first eats all their food, then them, then a number of people, until he meets a goat who offers to jump right into his mouth, but instead uses the opportunity to ram the clay guy, shattering him and freeing everyone. The Czech folk tale [[Otesánek]] (and [[Little Otik|the 2000 movie with the same name]]) follows a similar plot.

[[Joseph Jacobs]] published "Johnny-Cake" in his ''[[English Fairy Tales]]'' (1890), basing his tale on a version found in the ''American Journal of Folk-Lore.''&lt;ref name=SLL /&gt; Jacobs' johnny-cake rolls rather than runs, and the fox tricks him by pretending to be deaf and unable to hear his taunting verse. In "The Wee Bannock" from ''More English Fairy Tales'' (1894), Jacobs records a Scottish tale with a [[bannock (food)|bannock]] as hero.&lt;ref name="JacobsMore"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacobs|first1=Joseph|authorlink1=Joseph Jacobs|last2=Batten|first2=John D.|authorlink2=John D.

The musical ''The Gingerbread Man'' (music by [[Alfred Baldwin Sloane]], book and lyrics by Frederic G. Ranken) opened on Broadway on Christmas Day 1905, and ran for five months. The massive production then moved to Chicago with most of its New York cast and continued a successful tour of smaller venues in the U.S. for at least another four years. In this show the titular character, a gingerbread man, is named [[John Dough]] ("John Dough" being another term for a gingerbread man that was current at the time). While the gingerbread man is not the main character, he was played by the crowd favorite [[Eddie Redway]] and caught the attention of audiences and critics. The gingerbread man idea was also heavily promoted by the producers: 25,000 dough statuettes were given away in New York City to promote the show. This John Dough had few resemblances to the Gingerbread Man of the 1875 story described above. He claims to be a scapegoat rather than a troublemaker: "They are looking for me high and low, I'm wanted for that, I'm wanted for this, For any old thing that has gone amiss." Ranken's John Dough gingerbread man has few qualms about being eaten; he seems to fear obscurity more: "A little boy buys me with a cent . . . And removes an arm or leg or two, As down his throat I gently float, How can that hopeful know, Unless he is told, That he's stowed in his hold, The original John Dough."&lt;ref&gt;The Cincinnati Enquirer 8 May 1906, page 7. Downloaded from Newspapers.com 16 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Minneapolis Journal 28 October 1906, page 51. Downloaded from Newspapers.com on 16 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[John Dough and the Cherub]]'' (1906) and ''[[The Road to Oz]]'' (1909), also contained a gingerbread man named John Dough. Baum's John Dough is a life-sized creation and scared of being eaten, but ultimately sacrifices his hand to save a child's life. The Baum 1906 story also helped popularize the meme of the Gingerbread Man, although Baum's tale, like Ranken's, contained few elements of the original story.

Some tales have settings and cultural connections beyond Europe, such as Eric Kimmel's ''The Runaway Tortilla'' (2000) about a desert-roving tortilla who avoids donkeys, rattlesnakes, and buckaroos only to be defeated by crafty Señor Coyote; the [[Hanukkah]] version called ''The Runaway [[Latke]]s'' (2000) by Leslie Kimmelman; and Ying Chang Compestine's [[Chinese New Year]] tale, ''The Runaway [[Rice Cake]]'' (2001). Peter Armour's ''Stop That Pickle!'' (2005) is a tale about a runaway deli pickle. ''Marsupial Sue Presents "The Runaway Pancake"'' follows a similar plotline about a pancake whose hubris gets the best of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Marsupial-Sue-Presents-The-Runaway-Pancake/John-Lithgow/9780689878480|title=Marsupial Sue Presents "The Runaway Pancake"|date=2008-10-21|isbn=9780689878480|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Modern twists on the tale that retain a gingerbread man as the protagonist include Janet Squires' ''The Gingerbread Cowboy''; ''The Gingerbread Kid Goes to School'' (2002) by Joan Holub; and Lisa Campbell's ''The Gingerbread Girl'' (2006). In 1992 Jon Sciezka published ''[[The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales]]''. "The Stinky Cheese Man" is a rendition of "The Gingerbread Man" where the stinky cheese man runs away from everyone fearing that they will eat him, when really everyone just wants to get away from his smell. In 2018 Stephen Dixon published a sequel entitled ''The Gingerbread Man 2: What Happened Later?''.

The tale was used by [[The Residents]] in their 1994 album ''[[Gingerbread Man (album)|Gingerbread Man]]''. Here, the gingerbread man serves as the narrator, introducing the characters in each song.

The Korean mobile game ''[[Cookie Run]]'' is motivated by this fairy tale.

The Gingerbread Man is a dangerous criminal in the [[Jasper Fforde]] Nursery Crimes series and the main antagonist in the second novel in this series, ''[[The Fourth Bear]]''.

'''''The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time''''' is a [[wikt:posthumous|posthumous]] collection of previously published and unpublished material by [[Douglas Adams]]. It consists largely of essays about technology and life experiences, but its major selling point is the inclusion of the incomplete novel on which Adams was working at the time of his death, ''The Salmon of Doubt'' (from which the collection gets its title, a reference to the [[Irish mythology|Irish myth]] of the [[Salmon of Knowledge]]).

English editions of the book were published in the United States and UK in May 2002, exactly one year after the author's death.

==Original intention==
''The Salmon of Doubt'' was originally intended to be a [[Dirk Gently]] novel. The plot, set a few weeks after the events in ''[[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul]]'', involves Dirk Gently refusing to help find the missing half of a cat, receiving large amounts of money from an unknown client, and then flying to the United States. Dirk pays a visit to Kate Schechter (who had first appeared in ''The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul'') and tells her that prior to the potential client, he had been so bored that he had started a habit of dialling his own phone number and discovered he'd answered his own calls.
A faxed summary reprinted before the text mentions travelling "through the nasal membranes of a rhinoceros, to a distant future dominated by estate agents and heavily armed kangaroos."

The version in the published book was described as the strongest content from several unfinished drafts that were written.

===Later intention===
Adams said that while he originally planned on writing a third Dirk Gently book, the ideas which he had for it would have fit better into another Hitchhiker's book: "A lot of the stuff which was originally in ''The Salmon of Doubt'' really wasn't working", and he planned on "salvaging some of the ideas that I couldn't make work in a Dirk Gently framework and putting them in a Hitchhiker framework... and for old time's sake I may call it ''The Salmon of Doubt''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-salmon-of-doubt-by-douglas-adams-650803.html | location=London |work=The Independent | title=The Salmon of Doubt by Douglas Adams | date=10 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/cover-stories-douglas-adams-narnia-chronicles-something-like-a-house-672250.html | location=London |work=The Independent | title=Cover Stories: Douglas Adams, Narnia Chronicles, Something like a House | date=5 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had expressed dissatisfaction with the fifth ''Hitchhiker'' book, ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'', saying "People have said, quite rightly, that ''Mostly Harmless'' is a very bleak book. And it was a bleak book. I would love to finish ''Hitchhiker'' on a slightly more upbeat note, so five seems to be a wrong kind of number; six is a better kind of number."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/17/douglasadams?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=books | location=London |work=The Guardian | title=Eoin Colfer to write sixth Hitchhiker's Guide book | first=Alison | last=Flood | date=17 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matt Newsome |url=http://www.mattnewsome.co.uk/ |title=Matt Newsome's 1998 interview with Douglas Adams |publisher=Mattnewsome.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published version==
The book as published is divided into two main sections: "Life, the Universe and Everything", which utilizes fiction, essays and interviews with Adams, and ''The Salmon of Doubt'', which presents the most complete version of the novel as Adams left it.

The first section is then subdivided into three: "Life" touches upon Adams' own life, "The Universe" covers Adams' views of reality and "Everything", which is more wide open and includes the original version of the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|Hitchhiker's]] short story "[[Young Zaphod Plays It Safe]]".

==Editions==
The UK edition includes an introduction by [[Stephen Fry]], and the US edition, instead, by [[Christopher Cerf (musician and television producer)|Christopher Cerf]]. The audiobook edition consists of 7 CDs, mostly read by [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]], but also includes both of the introductions, read by their respective authors, as well as the tributes written and read by [[Richard Dawkins]]. US paperback editions have yet another introduction, written by [[Terry Jones]], and omit some material due to issues with copyright.

The fourteenth printing of the UK/Canadian paperback, {{ISBN|978-0-330-32312-3}}, differs in content from the ninth printing of the US hardcover edition, {{ISBN|1-4000-4508-8}}, in the following ways. The paperback contains a foreword written by Stephen Fry; the hardcover contains an introduction by Christopher Cerf. Adams's letter to David Vogel on page 168 has Adams's London address at the top in the hardcover, but it is missing from the paperback. "[[The Private Life of Genghis Khan]]" has been omitted from the paperback.

The US mass market paperback edition {{ISBN|0-345-45529-0}} contains everything in the US hardcover edition, and adds "An Introduction to the Introduction to the New Edition" and an "Introduction to the New Edition", both by Terry Jones. The material that was omitted from the UK/Canadian paperback edition is intact in the US mass market paperback edition.

==Adaptation==
[[BBC Radio 4]] had commissioned a third Dirk Gently six-part radio series for broadcast in mid-2010, based on the uncompleted chapters of ''The Salmon of Doubt'', and written by ''[[Spice World (film)|Spice World]]'' writer [[Kim Fuller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/24312/douglas-adams-final-dirk-gently-novel-to-be/ |title=Final Dirk Gently novel to be adapted for Radio 4 |publisher=Thestage.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plans have been dropped in favour of creating a [[Dirk Gently (TV series)|television adaption]] of the two complete novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2009/10/11/9767/bbc_plans_dirk_gently_tv_series|title=BBC plans Dirk Gently TV series|publisher=Chortle.co.uk|date=11 October 2009|accessdate=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tizatlan''', in pre-Columbian Mexico, was one of the four independent [[altepetl|altepemeh]] (polities, sing. altepetl) that constituted the confederation of [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcallan]]. Today Tizatlan is a part of the modern city of [[Tlaxcala, Tlaxcala|Tlaxcala]], and the [[Pre-Columbian]] city is visible as a small archaeological site. The site is in the state of [[Tlaxcala]] in central [[Mexico]].

==History==
Tizatlan was the third of the four altepemeh to be founded, but at the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]] it was, along with [[Ocotelolco (Altepetl)|Ocotelolco]], the most powerful of the four allied communities. Where Ocotelolco held the economical power, having the main market in the region, Tizatlan had the military power and commanded the Tlaxcallan armies. 

When the Spanish arrived in Mexico Tizatlan was ruled by the aging [[Xicotencatl I]] "the Elder" aided by his son the military leader [[Xicotencatl II]] "the Younger". Through a series of political events Ocotelolco finally achieved dominance over Tizatlan at the end of the conquest.

"'''Venus of the Hardsell'''" is a song from the [[DC Comics]]/[[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] comic book series ''[[Hellblazer]]''. The song was written by [[Jamie Delano]] and has since been recorded as a song by the musical group Spiderlegs. The song is notable for being fictionally part of the ''Hellblazer'' stories, and was said to be written by [[John Constantine]] and his band Mucous Membrane.

==Overview==
The lyrics and video for the song were printed in ''Hellblazer Annual 1'', written by [[Jamie Delano]] with art by [[Dean Motter]]. In the story, the song was the only single that Mucous Membrane, [[John Constantine]]'s punk band, ever released. It was written by John Constantine and Gary Lester and released in 1978, by "Snot Music" record label.

It has gained a cult following, and many fan-made recordings were made. In 2006, fans of Hellblazer (including the music group Spiderlegs)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.last.fm/music/spiderlegs |title=''Venus of the Hardsell''|accessdate=Dec 21, 2012 |date=Dec 21, 2012 |publisher=Spiderlegs}}&lt;/ref&gt; created a rough version of the song. It is unmixed and unmastered, and the vocals were never properly recorded; nevertheless, it can be found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/69402440/Mucous%20Membrane%20-%20Venus%20of%20the%20Hardsell%20%282012%29.mp3]&lt;/ref&gt; The song took another recording with a better quality and was released soon after. Spiderlegs sang the song with a fake accent. Spiderlegs said, "The goal was to try to make something so bad it was good."

==Music style==
[[Jamie Delano]] wrote the lyrics. The setting of the story which the song is written&lt;ref&gt;''Hellblazer Annual 1''&lt;/ref&gt; is in the 1970-80. And so the lyrics is based much on history formed in that era, such as the [[Cold War]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. President Nixon and the [[Apollo missions]] were also referenced. But as this being a DC imprint, many of its elements are incorporated, such as a reference of [[Superman]] in the song. The lyrics itself contains elements of [[anarchy]], [[pessimism]], and violence by war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insanerantings.com/hell/characters/mm/video.html |title=''Venus of the Hardsell'' lyrics|accessdate=Feb 24, 2013 |date=Feb 24, 2013 |publisher=Straight To Hell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
A video was created to accompany the music and was released on [[YouTube]]. The video is composed of layers from ''Hellblazer Annual 1'', with panels from the story including the supposed to be composer John Constantine and the Mucous Membrane, and their concert in The Casanova Club in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].

==Reception==
The song gained a cult following in the comics community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicvine.com/mucous-membrane/65-58026/ ComicVine Mucous Membrane]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing the song, [[Jamie Delano]] remarked, "Thanks for the MP3. I enjoyed the rendition. Very authentic late 'seventies atmosphere. Almost made me nostalgic."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hellblazer.ipbhost.com/index.php?showtopic=51&amp;st=1120 Hellblazer site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/69402440/Mucous%20Membrane%20-%20Venus%20of%20the%20Hardsell%20%282012%29.mp3 MP3 Jamie Delano interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Clown Association''' ('''WCA''') is a worldwide organization for [[clown]]s, [[Juggling|jugglers]], Magicians, face painters, and [[clowning]]. It holds an annual [[Convention (meeting)|convention]], mainly in the United States.

== Origin and history == 
Herb Metz was the main instigator and driving force behind the establishment of the World Clown Association. Herb had been the President of the Clowns of America prior to the time of their financial difficulties and ultimate organization breakup. Herb had a vision of an organization wherein the members would have controlling interest in the association. Along with the help of some influential friends in the Southeast Clown Association, he put together the framework for an organization. He convinced various persons to serve ad hoc in various officer capacities until such time that a general membership meeting could take place.

The first WCA convention was held in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], United States in 1983. In 1987, the World Clown Association established the first known clown scholarship fund. In memory of Dean Weiss, the Bo-Dino Memorial Educational Scholarship was established to benefit individuals interested in pursuing training at an established clown training program. In 1991, the first non-US convention was held in [[Bognor Regis]], [[England]].

The president Randy Christensen has voiced disapproval of the [[2016 clown sightings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11726226 Clown president: 'We don't want to scare people']&lt;/ref&gt;
