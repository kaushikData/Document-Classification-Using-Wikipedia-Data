'''Alain Manesson Mallet''' (1630–1706) was a French [[cartographer]] and [[engineer]]. He started his career as a soldier in the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], became a Sergeant-Major in the artillery and an Inspector of Fortifications.  He also served under the King of Portugal, before returning to France, and his appointment to the court of Louis XIV.  His military engineering and mathematical background led to his position teaching mathematics at court.&lt;ref&gt;Kanas, Nick  (2007).  ''Star Maps – History, Artistry, and Cartography'', Berlin Heidelberg New York: Springer-Praxis.  pp. 197-199&lt;/ref&gt;

His major publications were ''Description de L'Univers'' (1683) in 5 volumes, and ''Les Travaux de Mars ou l'Art de la Guerre'' (1684) in 3 volumes.

His ''Description de L'Universe'' contains a wide variety of information, including star maps, maps of the ancient and modern world, and a synopsis of the customs, religion and government of the many nations included in his text.  It has been suggested that his background as a teacher led to his being concerned with entertaining his readers.  This concern manifested itself in the charming harbour scenes and rural landscapes that he included beneath his description of astronomical concepts and diagrams.  Mallet himself drew most of the figures that were engraved for this book.&lt;ref&gt;Mendillo, Michael (2005).  ''Celestial Images – Antiquarian Astronomical Charts and Maps from the Mendillo Collection, Boston'': University of Washington Press.  pp. 83-84&lt;/ref&gt;

:''This article is about an [[ecozone]].  For the landform covering the same region, see [[Canadian Shield]].
The '''Boreal Shield Ecozone''', as defined by the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]] (CEC), is the largest [[Ecozones of Canada|ecozone]] in [[Canada]]. Covering 1.8 million square kilometres it covers almost 20% of Canada's landmass, stretching from northern [[Saskatchewan]] to [[Newfoundland]].&lt;ref name=CG&gt;{{cite web|title=Boreal Shield|url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/atlas/themes.aspx?id=shield&amp;lang=En|website=Canadian Atlas Online|publisher=Canadian Geographic|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

===Formation===

[[Canadian Shield]] rock forms the nucleus of the North American continent. Other [[geology|geological]] structures assumed positions around or on top of the Shield millions of years after it was formed. The [[Rocky Mountains]] are relative newcomers on the geological stage. Most Shield rocks were formed well over a billion years earlier, during the very first chapter of the planet's history known as the [[Precambrian era]].

What once may have been a towering mountain chain is today a great rolling plain of ancient [[bedrock]]. During the late Precambrian era, fierce convulsions in the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] resulted in a warped, collapsed Shield. The foundation of much of the ecozone is now [[metamorphic rocks|metamorphic]] [[gneiss]], a highly banded rock formed by intense pressure and heat. Many of the minerals that contribute to the Shield's economy may have formed during these geologically turbulent times.

During the last [[ice age]], which ended 10 000 years ago, the advance of [[glacier]]s continuously plucked and scoured the Boreal Shield, forming [[Glacial striation|striation]]s in the bedrock and carrying large boulders many kilometers. In retreat, massive glaciers enveloped most of the landscape with great amounts of glacial deposits including gravel, sand, shale, and numerous sediments. The vast majority of inadequately drained depressions that were left behind, as well as natural faults in the bedrock, now form the millions of lakes, ponds and wetlands that give this ecozone its distinctive character.&lt;ref name="Eco Frame"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boreal Shield Ecozone: Landforms and Climate|url=http://ecozones.ca/english/zone/BorealShield/land.html|website=Ecological Framework of Canada|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===

The regional climate has long, cold winters and short, warm summers, conditions which are moderated in coastal regions. The mean annual temperature ranges from -4&amp;nbsp;°C in northern Saskatchewan to 5.5&amp;nbsp;°C in Newfoundland. Precipitation increases from west to east. [[Permafrost]] is widespread.&lt;ref name=CG /&gt;

===Landforms===

The ecozone is characterized by a broadly rolling uplands and lowlands with precambrian granitic bedrock outcrops. There are numerous lakes and rivers, accounting for 22% of Canada's freshwater surface area.&lt;ref name=CG /&gt; The types of soil vary widely from [[muskeg]] to glacial-deposited sands.&lt;ref name="Ag Canada"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=R.E.|last2=Veldhuis,|first2=H|title=Terrestrial Ecozones, Ecoregions, and Ecodistricts of Manitoba An Ecological Stratification of Manitoba's Natural Landscapes|date=1998|publisher=Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada|location=Winnipeg, Manitoba|page=65|url=http://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/publications/ecostrat/provDescriptions/mbteee/mbteee_report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vegetation===

The region is widely forested with [[white spruce|white]] and [[black spruce]], [[balsam fir]] and [[jack pine]]. [[Deciduous trees]] are more common in the south, with [[white birch]], [[Populus tremuloides|trembling aspen]] and [[balsam poplar]]. There are also [[yellow birch]] and [[sugar maple]] to the east. In areas of [[muskeg]] there are stands of [[black spruce]] or [[tamarack]]. There are frequent forest fires.&lt;ref name=CG /&gt;

===Wildlife===

Being largely wild and remote, this ecozone is rich in wildlife, including [[woodland caribou]], [[moose]], [[wolf]], [[American black bear|black bear]], [[raccoon]], [[marten]], [[fisher (animal)|fisher]], [[striped skunk]], [[lynx]], [[bobcat]] and [[eastern chipmunk]]. Common birds include [[boreal owl]], [[great horned owl]], [[blue jay]], [[white-throated sparrow]] and [[evening grosbeak]]. Lakes contain [[brook char]], [[lake trout]], [[northern pike]], [[perch]], and [[walleye]].&lt;ref name="Ag Canada" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Off the northern and eastern coasts, aquatic mammals include [[grey seal]], [[harp seal]], [[hooded seal]], [[ringed seal]], [[sperm whale]], [[orca]], [[Atlantic pilot whale]], [[fin whale]], [[blue whale]], [[northern right whale]], [[bowhead whale]], and [[humpback whale]].&lt;ref name=TB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Torsten|first1=Bernhardt|title=Boreal Shield|url=http://canadianbiodiversity.mcgill.ca/english/ecozones/borealshield/borealshield.htm|website=Canadian Biodiversity|publisher=Torsten Bernhardt|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing conditions===

Fire suppression, insect control, clear-cutting and single-species tree farming are widespread in accessible areas. These practices may, over the long term, reduce the diversity of both plant and animal species and increase the forest's vulnerability to disease.

Many Shield lakes and soils are extremely sensitive to changes in [[pH]]. [[Acid rain]] from local sources and from the long-range transport of airborne pollutants has already taken an ominous toll. It may be weakening the general vigour and growth rate of trees, as well as of aquatic species, in sensitive areas.&lt;ref name="Eco Frame" /&gt;

==EcoRegions==
Each province continues to work on defining subregions within the larger
national ecozone system.&lt;ref name="CCEA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecozones Introduction|url=http://www.ccea.org/ecozones-introduction/|publisher=Canadian Council on Ecological Areas (CCEA)|accessdate=12 August 2017|quote=This level of generalization is well suited for national scale reporting. In the last 20 years, all Provinces and Territories have refined and automated their respective regional ecological framework. It is important, then, to provide a current national perspective which accurately reflects current regional efforts. ... Detailed ecological information remains with jurisdictions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Ivory Coast}}
The '''districts of [[Ivory Coast]]''' ({{lang-fr|districts de Côte d’Ivoire}}) are the first-level administrative [[subdivisions of Ivory Coast|subdivisions of the country]]. The districts were created in 2011  in an effort to further decentralise the state,&lt;ref name = abidjannet&gt;[http://news.abidjan.net/h/412022.html "Décentralisation : Le gouvernement créé 12 districts et 30 régions"], abidjan.net, 29 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = decret&gt;[http://www.pndap-ci.org/pdf/decret_districts.pdf Décret n° 2011-263 du 28 septembre 2011 portant organisation du territoire national en Districts et en Régions].&lt;/ref&gt; but in practice most of them have not yet begun to function as governmental entities.&lt;ref name = chefsdesanpedro/&gt;

There are 14 districts, including two autonomous districts around the cities of [[Yamoussoukro]] and [[Abidjan]]. The remaining 12 districts are further subdivided into 31 [[Regions of Ivory Coast|regions]], which are further subdivided into 108 third-level subdivisions, the [[Departments of Ivory Coast|departments]] ({{lang-fr|départements}}). Departments are subdivided into 510 [[Sub-prefectures of Ivory Coast|sub-prefectures]] ({{lang-fr|sous-préfectures}}). The lowest level of administrative organisation, which exist in limited numbers, is the [[Communes of Ivory Coast|commune]]. Although they are not divided into regions, the autonomous regions do contain departments, sub-prefectures, and communes.

==Governance and purpose==
Each district is meant to be headed by a governor, who is appointed by the council of ministers (cabinet) of the national government.&lt;ref name = ordonnance262&gt;[http://www.dgddl.interieur.gouv.ci/documentation/20130612092155TEXTELIGISLATIFETREGLEMENTAIRE.pdf Ordonnance n° 2011-262 du 28 septembre 2011 portant orientation de l'organisation générale de l'administration territoriale de l'Etat].&lt;/ref&gt; However, apart from governors for the two autonomous districts, no district governor has yet been nominated; the inaction has largely been in response to apprehensions by the [[regions of Ivory Coast|regional]] prefects that district governors will usurp their authority and responsibilities.&lt;ref name = chefsdesanpedro&gt;[http://news.abidjan.net/h/528149.html "Les chefs de San Pedro demandent l’érection de leur cité en district autonome"], 8 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Districts have been given four primary responsibilities:&lt;ref name = ordonnance262/&gt;
#to administer major development projects in the district;
#to balance the application of state investments and programmes throughout the district in order to minimise regional disparities;
#to promote the economic and cultural potentials of large groups; and
#to combat regionalism.

Precise distinctions in the jurisdiction of districts as compared to regions has yet to be established. Because of the lack of district governors, the governments of the non-autonomous districts have not yet begun to function.

== 2011 administrative subdivision changes ==
[[File:Carterégionci.png|thumb|Regions of Ivory Coast prior to 2011]]
Prior to September 2011, Ivory Coast's first-level administrative subdivisions were 19 [[Regions of Ivory Coast#Regions before 2011|regions]]. In 2011, the regions were reorganized into the 14 districts (12 regular districts and 2 autonomous districts).&lt;ref name = abidjannet/&gt;&lt;ref name = decret/&gt; The following is a summary of how the districts were constructed from the former regions:

* The largest city, [[Abidjan]], and the political capital, [[Yamoussoukro]], and their surrounding areas were split to form autonomous districts. Abidjan was formerly part of [[Lagunes Region]] and Yamoussoukro was formerly part of [[Lacs Region]].
* Of the 19 regions, the northern regions of [[Denguélé Region|Denguélé]], [[Savanes Region (Ivory Coast)|Savanes]], [[Vallée du Bandama Region|Vallée du Bandama]], and [[Zanzan Region|Zanzan]] were re-designated as districts with no change in territory. 
* The old [[Agnéby]] region and what remained of [[Lagunes Region]] were merged to form the new [[Lagunes District]].
* The old [[Bafing Region|Bafing]] and [[Worodougou|Worodougou Regions]] were merged to form the new [[Woroba District]].
* The [[Department of Fresco]] was transferred from the former [[Sud-Bandama Region]] to the [[Bas-Sassandra Region]] to form the new [[Bas-Sassandra District]], while the remainder of Sud-Bandama Region merged with [[Fromager Region]] to form the new [[Gôh-Djiboua District]].
* The old [[Dix-Huit Montagnes]] and [[Moyen-Cavally|Moyen-Cavally Regions]] merged to form the new [[Montagnes District]].
* The old [[Haut-Sassandra]] and [[Marahoué|Marahoué Regions]] merged to form the new [[Sassandra-Marahoué District]].
* The old [[N'Zi-Comoé Region]] and what remained of [[Lacs Region]] were merged to form the new [[Lacs District]].
* The old [[Moyen-Comoé]] and [[Sud-Comoé|Sud-Comoé Regions]] were merged to form the new [[Comoé District]].

The geography of Chile is extremely diverse as the country extends from a latitude of 17° South to Cape Horn at 56° (if Chilean claims on [[Antarctica]] are included Chile would extend to the [[South Pole]]) and from the ocean on the west to [[Andes]] on the east. Chile is situated in southern [[South America]], bordering the South [[Pacific Ocean]] and a small part of the South [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Chile's territorial shape is among the world's most unusual. From north to south, Chile extends {{convert|4270|km|0|abbr=on}}, and yet it only averages {{convert|177|km|0|abbr=on}} east to west. Chile reaches from the middle of South America's west coast straight down to the southern tip of the continent, where it curves slightly eastward. [[Diego Ramírez Islands]] and [[Cape Horn]], the southernmost points in the Americas, where the Pacific and Atlantic oceans meet, are Chilean territory. Chile's northern neighbors are Peru and [[Bolivia]], and its border with Argentina to the east, at {{convert|5150|km|0|abbr=on}}, is the world's third longest.

==A long, narrow nation==
[[Image:Cl-triconti-en.PNG|thumb|left|Map of ''[[Tricontinental Chile]]'' with possessions in [[Oceania]] ([[Easter Island]]), [[South America]] and the claim in [[Antarctica]]: [[Chilean Antarctic Territory]]]]
The northern two-thirds of Chile lie on top of the telluric [[Nazca Plate]], which, moving eastward about ten centimeters a year, is forcing its way under the continental plate of South America. This movement has resulted in the formation of the [[Peru–Chile Trench]], which lies beyond a narrow band of coastal waters off the northern two-thirds of the country. The trench is about {{convert|150|km|0|abbr=on}} wide and averages about {{convert|5000|m|0|abbr=on}} in depth. At its deepest point, just north of the port of [[Antofagasta]], it plunges to {{convert|8066|m|0|abbr=on}}. Although the ocean's surface obscures this fact, most of Chile lies at the edge of a profound precipice.

The same telluric displacements that created the Peru-Chile Trench make the country highly prone to earthquakes. During the twentieth century, Chile has been struck by twenty-eight major earthquakes, all with a force greater than 6.9 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]]. The strongest of these occurred in 2010 (registering an estimated 8.8 on the Richter scale) and in Valdivia 1960 (reaching 9.5). [[Great Chilean earthquake|This latter earthquake]] occurred on May 22, the day after another major quake measuring 7.25 on the Richter scale, and covered an extensive section of south-central Chile. It caused a [[tsunami]] that decimated several fishing villages in the south and raised or lowered sections of the coast as much as two meters. The clash between the Earth's surface plates has also generated the Andes, a geologically young mountain range that, in Chilean territory alone, includes about 620 volcanoes, many of them active. Almost sixty of these had erupted in the twentieth century by the early 1990s. More than half of Chile's land surface is volcanic in origin.

About 80 percent of the land in Chile is made up of mountains of some form or other. Most Chileans live near or on these mountains. The majestically snowcapped Andes and their precordillera elevations provide an ever-present backdrop to much of the scenery, but there are other, albeit less formidable, mountains as well. Although they seemingly can appear anywhere, the non-Andean mountains usually form part of transverse and coastal ranges. The former, located most characteristically in the near north and the far north natural regions, extend with various shapes from the Andes to the ocean, creating valleys with an east-west direction. The latter are evident mainly in the center of the country and create what is commonly called the [[Chilean Central Valley|Central Valley]] (Valle Central) between them and the Andes. In the far south, the Central Valley runs into the ocean's waters. At this location, the higher elevations of the coastal range facing the Andes become a multiplicity of islands, forming an intricate labyrinth of channels and fjords that have been an enduring challenge to maritime navigators.

Much of Chile's coastline is rugged, with surf that seems to explode against the rocks lying at the feet of high bluffs. This collision of land and sea gives way every so often to lovely beaches of various lengths, some of them encased by the bluffs. The [[Humboldt Current]], which originates northwest of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] (which juts into the [[Bellingshausen Sea]]) and runs the full length of the Chilean coast, makes the water frigid. Swimming at Chile's popular beaches in the central part of the country, where the water gets no warmer than {{convert|15|C|F}} in the summer, requires more than a bit of fortitude.

Chilean territory extends as far west as [[Polynesia]]. The best known of Chile's Pacific Islands is [[Easter Island]] (Isla de Pascua, also known by its Polynesian name of Rapa Nui), with a population of 2,800 people. Located {{convert|3600|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Chile's mainland port of [[Caldera, Chile|Caldera]], just below the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], Easter Island provides Chile a gateway to the Pacific. It is noted for its 867 monoliths ([[moai]]s), which are huge (up to twenty meters high) and mysterious, expressionless faces sculpted of volcanic stone. The [[Juan Fernández Islands]], located {{convert|587|km|0|abbr=on}} west of [[Valparaíso]], are the locale of a small fishing settlement. They are famous for their lobster and the fact that one of the islands, [[Robinson Crusoe Island]], is where [[Alexander Selkirk]], the inspiration for [[Daniel Defoe]]'s novel, was marooned for about four years.

==Natural regions==
[[File:Chile map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Chile map of Köppen climate classification.]]
[[Image:Chile veg 1972.jpg|thumb|Vegetation map of Chile]]
{{main|Natural regions of Chile|Climate of Chile}}

Since Chile extends from a point about {{convert|625|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the Tropic of Capricorn to a point hardly more than {{convert|1400|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the [[Antarctic Circle]], a broad selection of the Earth's climates can be found in this country. Therefore, geographically, the country can be divided into many different parts. It is usually divided by geographers into five regions: the far north, the near north, central Chile, the south, and the far south. Each has its own characteristic vegetation, fauna, climate, and, despite the omnipresence of both the Andes and the Pacific, its own distinct topography.

===The Far North===
{{main|Norte Grande, Chile}}
The far north (Norte Grande), which extends from the Peruvian border to about 27° south latitude, a line roughly paralleled to the [[Copiapó River]], is extremely [[arid]]. It mainly contains the [[Atacama Desert]], one of the driest areas in the world. In certain areas, this desert does not register any rainfall at all. Geographically, the aridity can be explained by the following reasons:

* The desert is located on the leeward side of the [[Chilean Coast Range]], so little moisture from the Pacific Ocean can reach the desert.
* The [[Andes]] is so high that it blocks convective clouds, which may bring precipitation, formed above the Amazon Basin from entering the desert from the east.
* An inversion layer is created by the cold [[Humboldt current]] and the [[South Pacific High]].

Average monthly temperatures range at sea level between about {{convert|20.5|C|F}} during the summer and about {{convert|14|C|F|1}} during the winter. Most of the population lives in the coastal area, where the temperatures are more moderate and the humidity higher. Contrary to the image of monochrome barrenness that most people associate with deserts, the landscape is spectacular, with its crisscrossing hills and mountains of all shapes and sizes, each with a unique hue depending on its mineral composition, its distance from the observer, and the time of day.

In the far north, the land generally rises vertically from the ocean, sometimes to elevations well over {{convert|1000|m|0|abbr=on}}. The [[Cordillera Domeyko]] in the north runs along the coast parallel to the Andes. This topography generates coastal microclimates because the fog that frequently forms over the cold ocean waters, as well as any low clouds, is trapped by the high bluffs. This airborne moisture condenses in the spines and leaves of the vegetation, droplets that fall to the ground and irrigate the plants' roots. Beyond the coastal bluffs, there is an area of rolling hills that encompasses the driest desert land; this area ends to the east with the Andes towering over it. The edges of the desert in some sections have subterranean aquifers that have permitted the development of forests made up mainly of [[tamarugo]]s, spiny trees native to the area that grow to a height of about twenty-five meters. Most of those forests were cut down to fuel the fires of the many foundries established since colonial times to exploit the abundant deposits of copper, silver, and nitrate found in the area. The result was the creation of even drier surface conditions.

The far north is the only part of the country in which there is a large section of the Andean (plateau). During summer the area receives considerable rainfall in what is commonly known as the "Bolivian winter,"&lt;ref&gt;In the Spanish-speaking tropics, ''invierno'' or "winter" means "rainy season" (''The University of Chicago Spanish-English/English-Spanish Dictionary,'' Fourth Edition (1992),
by Carlos Castillo, Otto F. Bond, and D. Lincoln Canfield. Simon and Schuster, {{ISBN|0-671-74348-1}}.)&lt;/ref&gt; forming shallow lakes of mostly saline waters ([[Salar de Llamara]], [[Salar des Miraje]], [[Salar de Atacama]])&lt;ref name="andesmap"&gt;{{cite web| title=Travel map of the Andes|publisher=Nelles Map|url=http://andes.zoom-maps.com/|accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are home to a number of bird species, including the [[Chilean flamingo]]. Some of the water from the plateau trickles down the Andes in the form of narrow rivers, many of which form oases before being lost to evaporation or absorption into the desert sands, salt beds, and aquifers. However, some rivers do manage to reach the Pacific, including the [[Loa River]], whose U-shaped course across the desert makes it Chile's longest river. The water rights for one of the rivers, the [[Lauca River]], remain a source of dispute between Bolivia and Chile. These narrow rivers have carved fertile valleys in which exuberant vegetation creates a stark contrast to the bone-dry hills. In such areas, roads usually are built halfway up the arid elevations in order to maximize the intensive agricultural use of the irrigated land. They offer spectacular panoramic vistas, along with the harrowing experience of driving along the edges of cliffs.

In the far north, the kinds of fruits that grow well in the arid tropics thrive, and all kinds of vegetables can be grown year-round. However, the region's main economic foundation is its great mineral wealth. For instance, [[Chuquicamata]], the world's largest open-pit copper mine, is located in the far north. Since the early 1970s, the fishing industry has also developed lots in the main ports of the area, most notably [[Iquique, Chile|Iquique]] and Antofagasta.

===The Near North===
{{main|Norte Chico, Chile}}
The near north (Norte Chico) extends from the Copiapó River to about 32° south latitude, or just north of Santiago. It is a semiarid region whose central area receives an average of about {{convert|25|mm|2|abbr=on}} of rain during each of the four winter months, with trace amounts the rest of the year. The near north is also subject to droughts. The temperatures are moderate, with an average of {{convert|18.5|C|F}} during the summer and about {{convert|12|C|F|1}} during the winter at sea level. The winter rains and the melting of the snow that accumulates on the Andes produce rivers whose flow varies with the seasons, but which carry water year round. Their deep [[Transverse Valleys]] provide broad areas for cattle raising and, most important, fruit growing, an activity that has developed greatly since the mid-1970s. Nearly all Chilean [[pisco]] is produced in the near north.

As in the far north, the coastal areas of the near north have a distinct microclimate. In those sections where the airborne moisture of the sea is trapped by high bluffs overlooking the ocean, temperate rain forests develop as the vegetation precipitates the vapor in the form of a misty rain. Because the river valleys provide breaks in the coastal elevations, maritime moisture can penetrate inland and further decrease the generally arid climate in those valleys. The higher elevations in the interior sections are covered with shrubs and cacti of various kinds.

===Central Chile===
[[File:Volcanosorno.jpg|thumb|left|Cattle grazing near [[Llanquihue Lake]]. [[Osorno (volcano)|Osorno Volcano]] in the background]]
{{main|Zona Central, Chile}}

Central Chile (Chile Central), home to a majority of the population, includes the three largest metropolitan areas—Santiago, Valparaíso, and Concepción. It extends from about 32° south latitude to about 37° south latitude. The climate is of the temperate [[Mediterranean Climate|Mediterranean]] type, with the amount of rainfall increasing considerably and progressively from north to south. In the Santiago area, the average monthly temperatures are about {{convert|19.5|C|F}} in the summer months of January and February and {{convert|7.5|C|F}} in the winter months of June and July; the average monthly precipitation is no more than a trace in January and February and {{convert|69.7|mm|0|abbr=on}} in June and July. In Concepción, by contrast, the average monthly temperatures are somewhat lower in the summer at {{convert|17.6|C|F}} but higher in the winter at {{convert|9.3|C|F}}, and the amount of rain is much greater: in the summer, [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]] receives an average of 0.8&amp;nbsp;inch (20 millimeters) of rain per month; in June and July, the city is pounded by an average of 10&amp;nbsp;inches (253&amp;nbsp;mm.) per month. The numerous rivers greatly increase their flow as a result of the winter rains and the spring melting of the Andean snows, and they contract considerably in the summer. The combination of abundant snow in the Andes and relatively moderate winter temperatures creates excellent conditions for Alpine skiing.

The topography of central Chile includes a [[Chilean Coast Range|coastal range]] of mountains running parallel to the Andes. Lying between the two mountain ranges is the so-called Central Valley, which contains some of the richest agricultural land in the country, especially in its northern portion. The area just north and south of Santiago is a large producer of fruits, including the grapes from which the best [[Chilean wine]]s are made. Exports of fresh fruit began to rise dramatically in the mid-1970s because Chilean growers had the advantage of being able to reach markets in the Northern Hemisphere during winter in that part of the world. Most of these exports, such as grapes, apples, and peaches, go by refrigerator ships, but some, such as berries, go by air freight.

The southern portion of central Chile contains a mixture of some excellent agricultural lands, many of which were covered originally with [[old-growth forest]]s. They were cleared for agriculture but were soon exhausted of their organic matter and left to erode. Large tracts of this worn-out land, many of them on hilly terrain, have been reforested for the lumber, especially for the cellulose and paper industries. New investments during the 1980s in these industries transformed the rural economy of the region. The pre-Andean highlands and some of the taller and more massive mountains in the coastal range (principally the [[Cordillera de Nahuelbuta]]) still contain large tracts of old-growth forests of remarkable beauty, some of which have been set aside as national parks. Between the coastal mountains and the ocean, many areas of central Chile contain stretches of land that are lower than the Central Valley and are generally quite flat. The longest beaches can be found in such sections.

===The South===
[[Image:Chilean coastal blooms.JPG|thumb|As seen in this SeaWiFS image Chile's southern coast is broken into many islands, [[Fjords and channels of Chile|fjords, channels]] and twisting peninsulas]]
{{main|Zona Sur, Chile}}

Although many lakes can be found in the Andean and coastal regions of central Chile, the south (Sur de Chile) is definitely the country's most lacustrine area. Southern Chile stretches from below the [[Bío-Bío River]] at about 37° south latitude to Chacao channel at about 42° south latitude. In this lake district of Chile, the valley between the Andes and the coastal range is closer to sea level, and the hundreds of rivers that descend from the Andes form lakes, some quite large, as they reach the lower elevations. They drain into the ocean through other rivers, some of which (principally the [[Calle-Calle River]], which flows by the city of [[Valdivia (city)|Valdivia]]) are the only ones in the whole country that are navigable for any stretch. The Central Valley's southernmost portion is submerged in the ocean and forms the [[Gulf of Ancud]]. [[Chiloé Island|Isla de Chiloé]], with its rolling hills, is the last important elevation of the coastal range of mountains.

The south is one of the rainiest areas in the world. One of the wettest spots in the region is Valdivia, with an annual rainfall of {{convert|2535.4|mm|1|abbr=on}}. The summer months of January and February are the driest, with a monthly average precipitation of {{convert|67|mm|1|abbr=on}}. The winter months of June and July each produce on average a deluge of {{convert|410.6|mm|1|abbr=on}}. Temperatures in the area are moderate. In Valdivia, the two summer months average {{convert|16.7|C|F}}, whereas the winter months average {{convert|7.9|C|F}}.

The lakes in this region are remarkably beautiful. The snow-covered Andes form a constant backdrop to vistas of clear blue or even turquoise waters, as at [[Todos los Santos Lake]]. The rivers that descend from the Andes rush over volcanic rocks, forming numerous white-water sections and waterfalls. The vegetation, including many ferns in the shady areas, is a lush green. Some sections still consist of old-growth forests, and in all seasons, but especially in the spring and summer, there are plenty of wildflowers and flowering trees. The pastures in the northernmost section, around [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]], are well suited for raising cattle; milk, cheese, and butter are important products of that area. All kinds of berries grow in the area, some of which are exported, and freshwater farming of various species of trout and salmon has developed, with cultivators taking advantage of the abundant supply of clear running water. The lumber industry is also important. A number of tourists, mainly Chileans and Argentines, visit the area during the summer.

Many of Chile's distinctive animal species have been decimated as they have been pushed farther and farther into the remaining wilderness areas by human occupation of the land. This is the case with the [[South Andean deer|huemul]], a large deer, and the Chilean [[condor]], the largest bird of its kind; both animals are on the national coat of arms. The remaining Chilean [[cougar]]s, which are bigger than their California cousins, have been driven to isolated national parks in the south by farmers who continue to hunt them because they occasionally kill sheep and goats.

===The Far South===
{{main|Zona Austral, Chile}}

In the far south (Chile Austral), which extends from between 42° south latitude to Cape Horn, the Andes and the South Pacific. In the northern part of the far south, there is still plenty of rainfall. The summer months average {{convert|206.1|mm|0|abbr=on}}, whereas the winter months average {{convert|300|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The temperatures at sea level in Puerto Aisén average {{convert|13.6|C|F}} in the summer months and {{convert|4.7|C|F}} in the winter months. The area generally is chilly and wet and houses a combination of channels, fjords, snow-capped mountains, and islands of all shapes and sizes within a narrow space. The southern part of the far south includes the city of [[Punta Arenas]], which, with about 125,000 inhabitants, is the most southern city in Chile. It receives much less precipitation; its annual total is only {{convert|438.5|mm|0|abbr=on}}, or a little more than what Valdivia receives in the month of June alone. This precipitation is distributed more or less evenly throughout the year, with the two main summer months receiving a monthly average of thirty-one millimeters and the winter months {{convert|38.9|mm|0|abbr=on}}, some of it in the form of snow. Temperatures are colder than in the rest of the country. The summer months average {{convert|11.1|C|F}}, and the winter months average {{convert|2.5|C|F}}. The virtually constant wind from the South Pacific Ocean makes the air feel much colder.

The far south contains large expanses of pastures that are often used for raising sheep, even though [[overgrazing]] is an issue in some areas. The area's other main economic activity is oil and natural gas extraction from the areas around the Strait of Magellan. This strait is one of the world's important sea-lanes because it unites the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through a channel that avoids the rough open waters off Cape Horn. The channel is perilous, however, and Chilean pilots guide all vessels through it.

=== Urban Population ===
The distribution of population is very condensed around the capital, Santiago, where approximately 90% of the people live.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;The cities of Valparaiso and Concepcion are the next highly populated cities, in that order.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The population is 87.6% urbanized.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2009, 12,037,290 living in urban parts of Chile actually had functioning facilities in their home, while 403,276 people did not have proper facilities in their dwelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=Chile+urban&amp;d=POP&amp;f=tableCode:311;countryCode:152|title=UNdata {{!}} record view {{!}} Occupants of housing units by type of housing unit and urban/rural residence|website=data.un.org|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;100% of the urban population has some form of access to sanitation facilities, while 90.9% of rural people have these facilities available.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is much higher than the rural average for the world that is at 50.5% access to sanitation facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs note the average annual rate of population change from 2015 to 2017 is 1.022 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=chile&amp;d=PopDiv&amp;f=variableID:47;crID:152|title=UNdata {{!}} record view {{!}} Average annual rate of population change (percentage)|website=data.un.org|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Women of Chile===
For women in Chile, the total fertility rate is at 1.765.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Total Fertility Rate (live births per woman) |url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=chile&amp;d=PopDiv&amp;f=variableID:54;crID:152 |website=UNdata |publisher=UN Statistics Division |accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chile's total fertility rate is below the replacement-level; that is even lower than the United States', indicating a decline in population growth. Chile's contraception prevalence high: 76.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html|title=SOUTH AMERICA :: CHILE|website=Central Intelligence Agency - The World Factbook|accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chile's universal healthcare and education access for women is unequal and only 31.4% of women ages 25-34 have a tertiary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Population with Tertiary Education |url=https://data.oecd.org/eduatt/population-with-tertiary-education.htm |website=OECD Data |publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This percentage is lower compared to other developed countries like the United States and the United Kingdom. However, the female population with some secondary education is 79%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Human Development Indicators: Education |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/CHL |website=United Nations Development Programme |publisher=United Nations Development Programme |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mobility of women in this country is hindered by the infrastructure and crime in the city: commutes become difficult since women take longer routes and more frequent stops to be safe. Half of the women in Chile have experienced sexual assault off of the streets of Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thegovlab.org/project-gender-and-urban-mobility-in-chile.html|title=The GovLab {{!}} Gender and Urban Mobility in Chile|website=The GovLab|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Migration/Immigration ===
The CIA World Factbook assess Chile's net migration rate at .3 migrants per a population of 1,000 and ranks Chile 66 for net migration out of other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=South America:: Chile |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html |website=CIA World Factbook |publisher=CIA |accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Chile's stability, democratic government, and growing economy many migrants find this country desirable. Chile receives a high volume of migrants from countries like Venezuela, Haiti, and Colombia. These migrants are either seeking asylum or fleeing failing economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Margolis |first1=Mac |title=Chile Faces Latin America's Migrant Future |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-06-11/chile-faces-latin-america-s-migrant-future |website=Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomerberg |accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera announced proposals that aimed to make immigration in Chile more orderly and to curb irregular immigration. 68% of Chilean favor restricting immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chile Gives Immigrants a Wary Welcome |url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2018/04/12/chile-gives-immigrants-a-wary-welcome |website=The Economist |publisher=The Economist |accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chile has created a designated visa specifically for Venezuelan asylum seekers.

====Emigration====
Push factors for Chilean emigrants include natural disasters. Earthquakes are common in Chile due to the country's location on the Nazca Plate and South American Plate. Chile notoriously had some of the most powerful earthquakes in history with the Valdivia Earthquake in 1960 at 9.5 on the Richter scale and the Maule Earthquake at 8.8 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=20 Largest Earthquakes in the World |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/browse/largest-world.php |website=U.S. Geological Survey |publisher=USGS |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top three countries that Chilean emigrants are moving to are Argentina, Peru, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Migrants: Chile in 2013 |url=https://www.populationpyramid.net/migrants/en/chile/2013/ |website=Population Pyramid |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural Hazards===
Chile's natural hazards include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis. The natural hazards are attributed to Chile's location along the Ring of Fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ring of Fire |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/ring-fire/ |website=National Geographic |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Severe earthquakes can trigger tsunamis for this country with 6,435 km of coastline. There are also more than three-dozen active volcanoes in Chile with the most active being the Llaima in the north Chilean Andes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=South America:: Chile |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html |website=CIA- World Factbook |publisher=CIA |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare ===
Despite being a third world country Chile has a proficient and advanced system of health care that gives everyone a chance to be cared for. The healthcare in Chile is universal for every citizen and legal resident. Universal healthcare is achieved by the project FONASA, which is a financial institution that compiles money and funds then properly allocates them for health care. The FONASA Program is overlooked and run by the government of Chile. Despite being government run the funds come from the citizens of Chile. The citizens earnings are deduced once a month to sponsor FONASA healthcare program. There is also private healthcare for those who do not qualify for universal healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Healthcare in Chile |url=http://www.expatarrivals.com/americas/chile/healthcare-chile |website=Expat Arrivals |publisher=Globe Media Ldt |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Chile funds their healthcare system by income taxes, with the tax rate being 7%. About 68% of Chileans are covered by their public healthcare system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Healthcare Reform in Chile |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2585124/ |website=National Center for Biotechnology Information |publisher=NCBI |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health of the Population ===
The Pan American Health Organization lists diseases of the circulatory system and neoplasms as the main causes of death in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Country Report: Chile |url=https://www.paho.org/salud-en-las-americas-2017/?page_id=105 |website=Pan American Health Organization |publisher=Pan American Health Organization |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circulatory system diseases include heart attack, heart failure, stroke, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. Neoplasms can refer to abnormal growth of tissues or cancers.


== Urban Geography ==
The three most populated cities in Chile are Santiago, Valparaíso, and Concepción. The populations of these cities are: Santiago at 6,680,000, Valparaíso at 967,000 and Concepción at 857,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=South America:: Chile |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html |website=CIA - The World Factbook |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santiago is located in central Chile with the Mapocho River running through the city. Valparaíso is located on the coast about 116 km northwest of Santiago. Concepción is also a coastal city that lies near the mouth of the Biobío River.

=== Origins of Cities in Chile ===
[[File:Planche VII.jpg|thumb|Concepción early 1700s]]
Industrial cities, such as Concepción and Talcahuano, began as colonial centers in the 1600s. Most of the large cities in Chile began as settlement locations for Spanish colonists living in homes constructed from adobe. They have grown to be the densely populated urban locations they are known for today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Chile/Settlement-patterns|title=Chile - Settlement patterns|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Plano de Santiago, por Nicolás Boloña.jpg|thumb|Santiago 1895]]

=== Gentrification ===
Gentrification is occurring in the municipal district of Santiago, which is impacting low income residents. Housing availability has reduced by 50% for residents and rent for new apartments has increased, changing the average income of that location. Floor Area Ratio instigated by the state has resulted in highly dense and smaller living spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=López-Morales|first=Ernesto|date=2016-03-16|title=Gentrification in Santiago, Chile: a property-led process of dispossession and exclusion|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02723638.2016.1149311?journalCode=rurb20|journal=Urban Geography|language=en|volume=37|issue=8|pages=1109–1131|doi=10.1080/02723638.2016.1149311|issn=0272-3638}}&lt;/ref&gt;





&lt;br /&gt;

== Cultural Geography ==
=== Race ===
While Chile's total population is 18,313,495&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Population Pyramids of the World from 1950 to 2100 |url=https://www.populationpyramid.net/chile/2017/ |website=Population Pyramid |accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, majority of the population is white/non-indigenous. They make up 88.9%. The largest indigenous ethnicity, Mapuche, makes up 9.1%. The Aymara peoples make up .7% of the population and the remaining 1.3% are categorized as other indigenous groups or unspecified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chile |url=https://www.infoplease.com/country/chile |website=InfoPlease |publisher=Infoplease |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chile's &lt;nowiki/&gt;high white/non-indigenous population can be traced back to European colonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Largest Ethnic Groups in Chile |url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/largest-ethnic-groups-in-chile.html |website=World Atlas |publisher=World Atlas |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 15th and 18th century, the number of slaves arriving in Chile from the Transatlantic slave trade were minuscule compared to Brazil and other South American regions. However, this would still mean that there are Chileans with Afro-descent. Afro-Chileans today are a neglected minority. Chile does not have an Afro-descendant category on their census so this makes it difficult to count their population, but the INE of Chile estimates there are 8,415 people who identify as Afro-descendant in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Afro-Chileans |url=https://minorityrights.org/minorities/afro-chileans/ |website=Minority Rights |publisher=MRG |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CATRAFTA-2.jpg|thumb|Camilo Catrillanca Protest]]
==== Racial Inequality in Chile ====
Indigenous groups in Chile are highly discriminated against. One of the most discriminated indigenous groups would be the Mapuche. Jobs often discriminate against Chileans with Mapuche names, which has led to higher poverty rates in areas with more Mapuche residents. Common stereotypes for Mapuche peoples include but are not limited to lazy, treacherous, and drunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Indigenous Of Chile: Why Discrimination Against Mapuches Still Runs So Deep |url=https://www.worldcrunch.com/culture-society/indigenous-of-chile-why-discrimination-against-mapuches-still-runs-so-deep |website=World Crunch |publisher=World Crunch |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mapuches are also more vulnerable to hate crimes. In November 2018, Camilo Catrillanca was fatally shot in the head by police. Catrillanca was the grandson of a Mapuche leader. Protests over Catrillanca's death turned violent in Santiago and the Chilean government is promising a thorough investigation of this incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chile Promises to Investigate Mapuche killing |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-46231360 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC New |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Racialized Landscapes in Chile ====
Vertical Ghettos: Due to Chile's high population density in urban city's like Santiago, housing developments started developing upwards. These high rises see an abundance of foreign migrants as occupants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Margolis |first1=Mac |title=Chile Faces Latin America's Migrant Future |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-06-11/chile-faces-latin-america-s-migrant-future |website=Bloomberg |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
Christianity is the most commonly practiced religion in Chile with more than two-thirds of Chileans being Roman Catholic. Protestant Christians make up about 16% of Chile's Christian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SOUTH AMERICA:: CHILE |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html |website=Central Intelligence Agency - The World Factbook |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholicism is the most practiced Christian denomination in Chile. The diffusion of this religion began with priest and Franciscans who arrived with the Spaniards to the new world. The first religious landscape (parish) was built in 1547. By 1650 most of the natives of Chile had been converted to Catholicism. The Catholic church was the dominant religion and the dominant educator, as it was them who dictated what was taught. This brought about the creation of six catholic universities. The stronghold of Catholicism came to a halt in 1925 when church and state were separated. Despite this separation, Catholicism is still celebrated by government officials and certain days are made holidays. This includes, but is not limited to Good Friday, Christmas, and ALL Saints Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Religion in Chile |url=https://www.studycountry.com/guide/CL-religion.htm |website=Study Country |publisher=Spain Exchange |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a large population of Chileans are Catholics, Chile is one of a couple of Latin American countries with the largest population of Protestants. The second leading Christian denomination in Chile is Protestantism.  Protestantism entered the region when many German migrants were welcomed to the southern lake region in the 1840s. The influx of Protestant Germans led to Anglican and Lutheran practices in Chile. With more migrants entering Chile, a profusion of Protestant Religions entered as well. In the early part of the 20th century followers of the new Methodist group separated and formed the Pentecostal Methodist Church. This church would also split as a result of the founding of the Evangelical Pentecostal Church in 1934. Today 90% of Chileans that identify as Protestant are Pentecostal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Religion in Chile |url=https://www.studycountry.com/guide/CL-religion.htm |website=Study Country |publisher=Spain Exchange |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious Landscapes and Sacred Places ===
In Chile, there are a number of pilgrimage and devotional sites dedicated to Catholic or cult's saints. These include the Church of Our Lady of Andacollo, the Church of Our Lady at Mount Carmel at Tirana, and the Church of the Immaculate Conception of Lo Vásquez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Landry |first1=Thomas M. |title=Pious families sponsor informal shrines to Virgins, Christ, and saints |url=https://www.catholicsandcultures.org/chile/roadside-shrines |website=Catholics &amp; Cultures |publisher=College of the Holy Cross |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== La Virgen de Andacollo ====
While there are several different tales of her origin and variations on her name, the Virgin Andacollo is flaunted on the first Sunday of every month in the plaza of Andacollo, Chile. The Virgin Andacollo is the Patron Saint of miners who heals the sick and rescues those lost in the mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vis |first1=Karin-Marijke |title=Joining Chile's Largest Religious Gathering: the Andacollo Festival |url=http://www.buckettripper.com/joining-chiles-largest-religious-gathering-the-andacollo-festival/ |website=Bucket Tripper |publisher=ParalexPro |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the first Sunday of October, the town of Andacollo celebrates their saint with La Fiesta Chico. Thousands of pilgrims come to the northern Chilean town each December for La Fiesta Grande. This event lasts from December 23th to 27th. This celebration attracts as many as 500,000 people a year.

[[File:Animita Chile.jpg|thumb|Animita in Chile]]
==== Animitas ====
It's not uncommon to come across roadside shrines in Chile. These shrines are called Animitas and they're particularly common on rural highways or in lower income towns. The shrines can be devoted to cult's saints or those who died tragically. These animitas identify the spot where a body and soul were separate and where a soul can possibly be lingering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Landy |first1=Thomas |title=Animitas: Roadside Shrines across Chile are ubiquitos reminders of tragedy |url=https://www.catholicsandcultures.org/chile-animitas-are-ubiquitous-reminders-tragedy |website=Catholics &amp; Cultures |publisher=College of the Holy Cross |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Churches of Chiloé ====
[[File:Iglesia de Achao.jpg|thumb|Iglesia de Achao]]
The Chiloé archipelago is located in southern Chile and is home to the Churches of Chiloé. These churches date back to the early 17th century. Their history began when the first Jesuits arrived in Chile. There are more than 60 churches, but 16 of them are recognized as world heritage sites by UNESCO as well as national monuments in Chile. The Achao church is the oldest church that still stands and was built entirely without using nails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Churches of Chiloe: architectural wealth in the southernmost part of the world |url=https://www.thisischile.cl/churches-of-chiloe-architectural-wealth-in-the-southernmost-part-of-the-world/?lang=en |website=This is Chile |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language ===
Spanish is the official language of Chile, with more than 99% of the population speaking it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SOUTH AMERICA: CHILE |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html |website=Central Intelligency Agency - The World Factbook |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Chileans also speak indigenous languages. These indigenous languages include Mapudungun (Mapuche), Chesungun, Aymara, Quechua, and Rapi Nui.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Languages |url=https://www.thisischile.cl/people/languages/?lang=en |website=This Is Chile |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the plethora of languages spoken in Chile, one aspect that makes it culturally homogeneous is the lack of accents throughout the Regions. The spoken language of middle-class Chileans from all over the country is nonexistent. The area where there is a notable difference in accents is in the different social classes. The difference in Chilean Spanish is the speed at which Chileans speak as well as incorporating many words from the language of the Mapuches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Culture of Chile |url=https://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Chile.html |website=Everything Culture |publisher=Advameg, Inc. |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LGBT Rights in Chile ===          
[[File:Marcha del Orgullo LGBT 2018 - Santiago, Chile 3.jpg|thumb|LGBT flag 2018 - Santiago, Chile]]
Same-sex marriage is currently illegal in Chile. However, Chile decriminalized same-sex marriage in 1999 and has approved civil unions since 2015. In 2017, former Chilean president Michelle Bachlete did attempt to legalize same-sex marriage by introducing a bill to have it legalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vergara |first1=Eva |title=Chile looks to legalise gay marriage and allows LGBT couples to adopt as historic new bill signed |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/chile-gay-marriage-bill-michelle-bachelet-lgbt-rights-weddings-legalised-reforms-a7918441.html |website=Independent |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chile is beginning to loosen its conservative LGBT laws. In 2018, Chile approved a law allowing children who are over the age of 14 to change their name or gender on official records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cambero |first1=Fabian |title=Chile approves law for transgender citizens to change official details |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-transgender/chile-approves-law-for-transgender-citizens-to-change-official-details-idUSKCN1LS36W |website=Reuters |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political Geography ==
=== Government ===
[[Salvador Allende]] was elected to presidency as a Marxist in 1970. Allende worked to reshape Chile with radical social reform with programs to instill strong nationalist traditions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-19357497|title=Chile country profile|date=2018-04-12|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, a violent coup was staged by [[Augusto Pinochet|General Augusto Pinochet]] in 1973 and left over 3,000 people dead or unaccounted for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-19357497|title=Chile country profile|date=2018-04-12|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Border Disputes with Bolivia ===
Chile has long been in conflict with [[Bolivia]] over coastal and land sovereignty. The War of the Pacific was fought between Chile, Bolivia, and Peru in the late 1800s. Peru and Bolivia had rich nitrate deposits. However, Peru established a monopoly over their state deposits and Bolivia added export tariffs to Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kiernan |first1=V.G. |title=Foreign Interests in the War of the Pacific |url=https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.uta.edu/stable/2509249 |website=JSTOR |publisher=Duke University Press |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Chile had won 120,000 sq km of land that included Antofagasta on the coastline of Bolivia. This has left Bolivia landlocked since 1904. 
Bolivia still fights for coastal and territorial sovereignty. Evo Morales, the president of Bolivia, believes that Bolivia being landlocked has made the country endure great "historical injustice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bolivia Takes Sea Access Dispute with Chile to International Court of Justice |url=https://santiagotimes.cl/2018/03/19/bolivia-takes-sea-access-dispute-with-chile-to-international-court-of-justice/ |website=The Santiago Times |publisher=The Santiago Times |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morales also argues that if Chile were to give back Antofagasta, it would have no significant effect on their country. The land Bolivia lost to Chile more than a century ago is now home to some of the biggest copper mines in the world. Chile has no desire or intentions of giving up any land to Bolivia, but Chile is very open to coastal access negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Long |first1=Gideon |title=Bolivia-Chile land dispute has deep roots |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-22287222 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In October 2018, the International Court of Justice has ruled against Bolivia in its dispute with Chile. The court ruled that Chile did not have to discuss granting Bolivia sea access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bolivia Sea Dispute: UN rules in Chile's Favor |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-45708671 |website=BBC World News |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Border Disputes with Peru ===
There have been long arguments between Chileans and Peruvians since the 1800s. This is because they both claim boundary coastal lines. Peruvians claim the Northern part of Chile, which is now South West of Peru. The "triangulation" was made to fix the boundary problem between Chile and Peru. The decisions were accomplished on January 27, 1839 by the International Court of Justice &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Webb |first1=Peter H. |title=Chile, Peru, and the ICJ Boundary Settlement |url=http://blogs.law.unc.edu/ncilj/2014/02/24/chile-peru-and-the-icj-boundary-settlement/ |website=North Carolina Journal of International Law |publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The War of the Pacific was in the years 1879-1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=War of the Pacific |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-the-Pacific |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica Inc. |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This  was caused because of the minerals resources Chile had. This led for Chile to control Sea Shipping to Peru and send out an army to invade Peru on October 8, 1879. The attempt was also made to The United States but failed badly on October 1880. There was a resistance between Peruvians and Chileans for a few years. The United States offered help with a treaty for both Peru and Chile, better known as the Treaty of Ancón. This was signed by both of them on October 20, 1883, to keep the peace between them. In 2008, Peru took Chile to court over their maritime disputes. In 2014, the International Court of Justice's ruling resulted in Chile losing 80 miles from Chile's northwestern ocean zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bonnefoy |first1=Pascale |title=Court Grants Peru Ocean Territory Claimed by Chile |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/world/americas/court-grants-peru-ocean-territory-claimed-by-chile.html |website=New York Times |publisher=New York Times Company |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling severely impacted fishers in the country.

=== Border Disputes with Argentina ===
Chile despite being a small country has had borders disputes with other countries as well. One of those countries is Argentina. The border disputes between Chile and Argentina deal with the Patagonia region. One of the many disputes deals with the Southern ice-fields. The disagreements began when Argentina maps started to include part of the Southern Ice-fields. The dispute between these two countries deals with water, as this contested land contains one of the biggest (Second largest) reserves of potable water in the world. Despite these differing ideas about what land belongs to which country, the President of Chile claims that these issues will get resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fendt |first1=Lindsay |title=Argentina revives long time border dispute with Chile in Patagonian ice fields |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2010/05/20/argentina-revives-long-time-border-dispute-with-chile-in-patagonian-ice-fields |website=Merco Press |publisher=Merco Press |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agricultural Geography==
[[File:Uvitas, Santa Juana Región del Bio Bio.JPG|thumb|Chilean Grapes in Bio Bio]]
Agriculture comprises 4.4% of GDP (industry 31.4%, services 64.3%). A 2017 estimate has 8.881 million people working within the Chilean labor force, and 9.2% working within agriculture by occupation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Chile's labor force places #59 in the country comparison list according to CIA World Factbook&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Chile currently utilizes 14,015 Hectares of agricultural land &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.oecd.org/chile.htm|title=Chile - OECD Data|website=theOECD|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Chilean agriculture includes the cultivation and trade of grapes, apples, pears, onions, wheat, corn, oats, peaches, garlic, asparagus, and beans. Grapes are the largest fruit export product with an export value of $1.76 billion. Non-animal foods, fruit, and vegetable exports total about $11.7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chile (CHL) - Exports, Imports, and Trade Partners |url=https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/chl/ |website=OEC |publisher=Collective Learning |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beef and poultry industries, fish, wool and timber are also included. Animal products have an export value of $5.89 billion. Water heavy industries are causing groundwater, lake, and river depletion in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Milesi |first1=Orlando |title=Scientists Warn of the Imminent Depletion of Ground Water in Chile's Atacama Desert |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2018/08/scientists-warn-imminent-depletion-groundwater-chiles-atacama-desert/ |website=Inter Press Service News |publisher=Inter Press Service |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illegal water extractions are now becoming common in Chile.

=== Climate and Weather ===
Located on the west coast of South America, Chile has a total area of 756,102 sq km. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geography:: Chile |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html |website=CIA World Factbook |publisher=CIA |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;There are four climates that separate Chile. One of these climates is the Dry climate. This is located the North above Santiago called Atacama Desert with the temperature of up to 90°F. The Central part of Chile has a warmer climate that reaches up to 82.4 ° F. The inner region of Chile has a snow climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Painter |first1=James |title=Chile Faces Climate Change Challenge |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8058080.stm |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; South of Chile there is a wet climate because of the Mediterranean Coastline this leading the Wet Season to range from May to August. Summer in Chile is  December through February. Leading for the Winter to be June through August with low temperatures up to -2° C. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geography |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html |website=The World Factbook |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land Use===
As of 2011, Chile allocates 21.1% of its land to agriculture. Chile's allocation percentage is smaller than it's neighboring countries Argentina (53.9%) and Bolivia (34.3%), but larger than Peru's (18.8%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Land Use % |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2097.html |website=CIA World Factbook |publisher=CIA.gov |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the land Chile devotes to agriculture, only 1.7% is arable land. Chile's diverse climate and small area is responsible for such a low percentage. Some desert countries like Egypt have a higher arable land percentage than Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Africa::Egypt |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/print_eg.html |website=CIA World Factbook |publisher=CIA.gov |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic Geography ==
Chile maintains a market-oriented economy with high levels of foreign trade compounded by strong financial institutions. These factors have given Chile the highest sovereign bond rating in South America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Chile is committed to a trade liberalization and has 26 trade agreements covering 60 different countries. In May 2010 Chile became the first South American member of [[OECD]] (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). Chile's top 3 importing partners are China, the United States, and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=South America:: Chile |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html |website=CIA World Factbook |accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2005, Chile and China signed the China-Chile Free Trade Agreement. More than 90% of Chile's imports enter China duty-free.
The United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement began in 2004. Since 2015, 100% of U.S. imports have been entering Chile duty-free. Consumer and Industrial export products enter Chile duty-free as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chile Free Trade Agreement |url=https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/chile-fta |website=United States Trade Representative |accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2017, Chile and Brazil have been negotiating a trade deal that's on track to be signed by the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mandl |first1=Carolina |title=Brazil and China set to sign free trade deal year-end |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-chile-trade/brazil-and-chile-set-to-sign-free-trade-deal-by-year-end-idUSKCN1MV0NK |website=Reuters |accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chile's top 3 exporting partners are China, the United States, and Japan. Chile and Japan were previously in Economic Partnership Agreements. In 2018, Chile and Japan were among the 11 nations that signed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This trade pact aims to reduce tariffs, enforce environmental standards, and remove barrier regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McDonald |first1=Tim |title=Asia-Pacific Trade Deal Signed by 11 Nations |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43326314 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exports ===
[[File:Copper-20638.jpg|thumb|Copper]]
Total trade exports from Chile generated $64.51 Billion in 2017 (in U.S. dollars) placing Chile at number 43 on the World Comparison Chart &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Goods and services account for one-third of GDP within Chile.

Chile also runs a positive trade balance. 
After a 12 year break, Chile is set to resume importing natural gas from Argentina. The natural gas will be piped across Andes mountains to the southern province of Biobío in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasdaq.com/article/argentina-restarts-natural-gas-exports-to-chile-20181030-01658|title=Argentina restarts natural gas exports to Chile|date=2018-10-30|work=NASDAQ.com|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
*Economic Welfare: In 2017, Chile's GDP was at $277 billion with a growth rate of 1.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=South America:: Chile |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html |website=CIA World Factbook |publisher=CIA.gov |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chile's GDP purchasing power parity for the same year was $452.1 billion.

This information is gathered from raw data on education from both literacy rates and academic performance within scientific fields.

Chile's literacy rate is more than 97%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SOUTH:: AMERICA |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html |website=Central Intelligence Agency - The World Factbook |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 97% literacy rate makes Chile the most literate country in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An Overview: The Chilean education system:Chile has the best education system in Latin America |url=https://www.justlanded.com/english/Chile/Chile-Guide/Education/An-overview |website=Just Landed |publisher=Just Landed |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 2000, 99% of kids ages 6-13 were enrolled in primary education and 90% of kids 13-18 were enrolled in secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Education System Overview - About Chile |url=https://teachingchile.com/about_chile_overview.htm |website=Teaching in Chile |publisher=Teaching Chile |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Chile furthered their education by making education from ages 6-18 mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An overview -The Chilean education system |url=https://www.justlanded.com/english/Chile/Chile-Guide/Education/An-overview |website=Just Landed |publisher=Just Landed |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of education is free in Chile, as schooling is the responsibility of the state and education is paid for with special education vouchers. These vouchers are provided for free by the Chilean government. These vouchers are similar to what a number of European countries use. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Healthcare in Chile |url=http://www.expatarrivals.com/americas/chile/healthcare-chile |website=Expat Arrivals |publisher=Global Media |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Pothorst''' ({{circa}} 1440 – 1490)&lt;ref name=DSD&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Den Store Danske Encyklopædi]]|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Rejser,_geografi_og_historie/Gr%C3%B8nland/Gr%C3%B8nlands_samfund,_kultur_og_historie/Hans_Pothorst|title=Hans Pothorst|language=Danish|accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[privateer]], likely from the [[Germany|German]] city [[Hildesheim]].&lt;ref name=h507/&gt; He is mostly notable because some {{Who|date=June 2013}} have proposed that he may have discovered [[The Americas|America]] along with [[Didrik Pining]] (among others) in the 1470s, almost twenty years before [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]].

== Biography ==
In what little is known about Pothorst, he is often linked with Didrik Pining. Like Pining, Pothorst was likely from [[Hildesheim]].&lt;ref name=h507&gt;Hughes, 2004, p. 507.&lt;/ref&gt; Pothorst's service on the [[Hamburg]] warship ''Bastian'', seems to have been officially terminated on 1 July 1473.&lt;ref name=h507/&gt; Sometime in the 1470s, Pining, Pothorst and [[João Vaz Corte-Real|Corte-Real]] were sent by King [[Christian I of Denmark]] on a naval expedition to the North-Atlantic.&lt;ref name=h507/&gt; During the later years of the reign of Christian I, Pothorst and Pining are said to have distinguished themselves "not less as capable seamen than as matchless freebooters."&lt;ref name="Nansen"&gt;Nansen and Chater, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pothorst's home in Denmark is presumed to have been [[Helsingør]], where his [[coat of arms]] and a simple portrait was painted (possibly shortly after his death)&lt;ref name=DSD/&gt; among eight ceiling frescoes in the local St. Mary's Church. The ceiling ensemble remains one of the most celebrated 15th century Danish artworks, and if Pothorst funded its creation as it has been assumed, historians note that he must have been rather wealthy.&lt;ref name=h507/&gt;

Later, he is mentioned as a privateer, and in the [[Skibby Chronicle]] Pothorst and Pining are mentioned among many pirates who "met with a miserable death, being either slain by their friends or hanged on the gallows or drowned in the waves of the sea."&lt;ref name="Nansen"&gt;Nansen and Chater, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:UY''' is the entry for [[Uruguay]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Uruguay, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[departments of Uruguay|19 departments]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|UY}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Uruguay. The second part is two letters.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

'''The Indian Institute of Surveying &amp; Mapping''' (IISM)(Hindi:भारतीय सर्वेक्षण एवम् मानचित्रण संस्थान) was founded on 6 May 1967 is an institution of Survey Education learning and training. This institute formerly known as Survey Training Institute. It is situated in [[Survey of India]](भारतीय सर्वेक्षण विभाग) campus in [[Uppal Kalan|Uppal]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]].

==History==
[[Survey of India]], the National Survey Organisation of Government of India was established in 1767. In the last two and a quarter centuries, the entire country has been mapped with utmost dedication and hard work by a distinguished line of surveyors. In Post-independence India, the developmental activities and need for defence preparedness brought urgent need to impart training to officers and staff in various aspects of surveying and mapping with state-of-the-art technologies. With this objective, the Centre for Survey Training and Map Production was established at Hyderabad in 1967 with a Human Resource Development Institute within Survey of India under technical assistance from United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The Indian Institute of Surveying &amp; Mapping(erstwhile  Survey Training Institute) thus raised on 6 May 1967 is now recognized as the prestigious training establishment in the field of Surveying and Cartography to impart training to the Officers and Staff of Survey of India and other Government Organisations, Private Individuals, and Scholars from other Afro-Asian countries.

	The Institute courses are held in high esteem by Scientific Departments and Organisations. The fact that more than a hundred batches of certain courses have been conducted by Institute over the past 38 years of its existence speaks volumes of its contribution to the profession of Surveying. Alumni of Institute who had undergone  popular basic courses are today occupying high positions in various organizations at home and abroad. The other Directorates of Survey of India located within the complex, viz.,Printing Zone, AP Geo-spatial Data Centre, Southern Printing Group and GIS &amp; Remote Sensing Directorate are rendering faculty assistance as and when required. Besides, Indian Institute of Surveying &amp; Mapping engages experts from external sources especially in the field of management and remote sensing, for faculty support. The facilities of IISM Library, abounding in authentic books on surveying, cartography and various allied subjects are available to all trainees.  Internet facility has now been provided in the library, thus facilitating access for trainees and faculty to the resources available in the electronic media.  Furnished hostels for trainees with boarding facilities are situated in the campus which is sprawling, lush green; and the undulating terrain endowed with flora and fauna is delightful for a person with an eye for surveying.

==Survey Education==
Introduction of innovative surveying systems such as GPS, EDM, digital levels and theodolites, Laser scanners, digital sensors, high resolution satellite imageries etc., has revolutionised the scope of spatial data collection. However, on account of deficiencies in our system of Survey Education and practices, many of these technologies have yet to acquire the status of enabling technology in India.

Broadly, the ethos can be attributed to two main reasons - the Survey Education, by itself, being not popular as a discipline of science and there being no regularatory standards to control the practices of collecting spatial data. A lot of spatial data being generated by various institutions using high-end technology by untrained manpower, being inconsistent in accuracies and unrelated to any meta-data standards on account of lack of professional supervision, cannot be put to universal use in a multi-disciplinary environment.

Such efforts, although meeting a limited requirement, do not contribute to the national need of a standardised spatial data base and are often found wanting in accuracy when integrated with a regional or national perspective. For deriving full benefits and optimising the use of resources, knowledge of the fundamentals of land surveying and various methodologies of interfacing them with the new technologies has, therefore, become an inescapable requirement for all technologists and planners engaged in generation and manipulation of spatial information.

Survey Education deals with the concepts and methodologies of gathering, processing and representing geo-spatial data in a defined form and format. It encompasses education on theories and practices in disciplines of geodesy, geo-physics, photogrammetry, land surveying, cartography and reprography. With the introduction of computers and change of emphasis from analogue to digital technology and high expectations from GIS, computer sciences and various systems for generation of spatial data bases have become an integral part of survey education.

To keep pace with the present day requirement of spatial data, education on the modern tools of data gathering such as GPS, Digital Photogrammetry, laser ranging, remote sensing etc., and associated technologies in visualization of spatial data, has acquired a special place in Survey Education. Despite the sophistication in technology, need-based emphasis on accuracies, reliability and consistency in data generation remain the cardinal principle in Survey Education.

== Background ==
=== Family ===
Israel Finkelstein was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, on March 29, 1949.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=https://israelfinkelstein.wordpress.com/c-v/|website=Israel Finkelstein|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Zvi (Grisha) Finkelstein (born 1908) and Miriam Finkelstein (maiden name Ellenhorn, born 1910). His great grandfather on his mother's side, Shlomo Ellenhorn, came to Palestine from Grodno (today in Belarus) in the 1850s and settled in Hebron. He was one of the first physicians in the Bikur Cholim Hospital in Jerusalem, and is listed among the group of people who purchased the land in 1878 in order to establish Petah Tikva – the first modern Jewish settlement in Palestine outside the four holy cities. Finkelstein's grandfather, Israel Jacob Ellenhorn, was the first pharmacist in Petah Tikva.

Finkelstein’s father was born in Melitopol (Ukraine). He came to Palestine with his family in 1920. He was in the orange-growing business and was active in the sports organizations of Israel. He served as vice chairman of the Israel Football Association, chairman of Maccabi Israel and was a member of the Israel Olympic Committee.

Finkelstein is married to Joelle (maiden name Cohen). They are the parents of two daughters – Adar (born 1992) and Sarai (born 1996).

=== Education ===
Israel Finkelstein attended the PICA elementary school (1956–1963) and Ahad Ha'am High School (1963–1967), both in Petah Tikva. He then served in the Israel Defense Forces (1967–1970). He studied archaeology and Near Eastern civilizations, and geography at Tel Aviv University, receiving his BA in 1974. While there, Finkelstein was a student of Prof. Yohanan Aharoni. He continued as a research student under the supervision of Prof. Moshe Kochavi, receiving his MA in 1978 (thesis on Rural Settlement in the Yarkon Basin in the Iron Age and Persian-Hellenistic Periods). He graduated as a PhD in 1983 with a thesis titled The Izbet Sartah Excavations and the Israelite Settlement in the Hill Country.

== Academic career ==
From 1976 to 1990, Finkelstein taught at the Department of Land of Israel Studies, Bar-Ilan University, beginning as a teaching assistant. He spent the academic year of 1983–84 in a research group led by Prof. Yigael Yadin in the Institute of Advanced Studies in the Hebrew University, Jerusalem. In 1986 and 1987, Finkelstein taught at the Department for Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, University of Chicago. In 1987 he was appointed an associate professor with tenure at Bar-Ilan University and in 1990 moved to the Department of Archaeology and Ancient Near Eastern Civilizations at Tel Aviv University. In 1992/93 Finkelstein spent a sabbatical year as a visiting scholar at the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, Harvard University. Since 1992, he has been a Full Professor at Tel Aviv University. He served as the chairperson of the Department of Archaeology and Near Eastern Studies (1994–98) and as Director of The Sonia and Marco Nadler Institute of Archaeology (1996–2003). In 1998–99 Finkelstein was a visiting scholar in the Centre de Recherche d’Archéologie Orientale and the École Pratique des Hautes Études in the Sorbonne, Paris.

Finkelstein delivered series of lectures on the history and archaeology of Ancient Israel at the Texas Christian University (2002), the University of Buenos Aires (2011), the College de France in Paris (2012) and the Methodist University of São Paulo (2015). He is scheduled to deliver similar lectures at the Tokyo Christian University (2017) and the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome (2017). Finkelstein has read over 100 papers in international conferences and given numerous talks in universities around the globe.

Finkelstein has been the Editor of Tel Aviv, the journal of the Institute of Archaeology of Tel Aviv University, since 2008 and Executive Editor of the Monograph Series by the Institute of Archaeology, Tel Aviv University, since 2005. He is a member of editorial boards, including the Palestine Exploration Journal and the Archaeology and Biblical Studies series, the Society of Biblical Literature.

== Scholarly contributions ==
Finkelstein has written on a variety of topics, including the archaeology of the Bronze Age and the exact and life sciences contribution to archaeology. Still, much of his work has been devoted to the Iron Age and, more specifically, to questions related to the history of Ancient Israel.

=== The Emergence of Ancient Israel ===
The classical theories on the emergence of Israel viewed the process as a unique event in the history of the region. Finkelstein suggested that we are dealing with a long-term process of a cyclical nature. He demonstrated that the wave of settlement in the highlands in the Iron Age I (ca. 1150-950 BCE) was the last in a series of such demographic developments – the first had taken place in the Early Bronze and the second in the Middle Bronze. The periods between these peaks were characterized by low settlement activity. Finkelstein explained these oscillations as representing changes along the sedentary/ pastoral-nomadic continuum, which were caused by socioeconomic and political dynamics. Hence, a big portion of the people who settled in the highlands in the early Iron Age were locals of a pastoral-nomadic background. Others, who originated from local sedentary background, moved to the highlands as a result of the Bronze Age collapse – which in turn was related to a long period of dry climate in ca. 1250-1100 BCE. Since eventually these groups formed the Northern Kingdom of Israel, they can be labeled "Israelites" as early as their initial settlement process. The same holds true for the contemporary settlement process in Transjordan and western Syria, which brought about the rise of Moab, Ammon and the Aramean kingdoms of the later phases of the Iron Age.&lt;ref&gt;For the rise of Ancient Israel: I. Finkelstein, The Archaeology of the Israelite Settlement, Jerusalem 1988; idem, The Great Transformation: The 'Conquest' of the Highlands Frontiers and the Rise of the Territorial States, in T.E. Levy (ed.), The Archaeology of Society in the Holy Land, Leicester 1995, pp. 349-365.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkelstein regards the biblical account on the Conquest of Canaan in the Book of Joshua as an ideological manifesto of the Deuteronomistic author/s of the late 7th century BCE, describing a "conquest to be" under King Josiah of Judah rather than a historical event at the end of the Bronze Age. He proposed that the original Conquest Account may have originated in the Northern Kingdom of Israel in the early 8th century BCE; it could have been influenced by memories of the turmoil that had taken place in the lowlands in the late Iron I (10th century BCE), rather than the end of the Late Bronze Age (late 12th century BCE).&lt;ref&gt;For the biblical account on the Conquest of Canaan: I. Finkelstein and N.A. Silberman, The Bible Unearthed, Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of its Sacred Texts, New York 2001, pp. 72-96; I. Finkelstein, A Corpus of North Israelite Texts in the Days of Jeroboam II? Forthcoming in Hebrew Bible and Ancient Israel.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Low Chronology ===
Until the 1990s, the chronology of the Iron Age in the Levant had been anchored in the biblical account of the great United Monarchy of David and Solomon. Accordingly, the Iron I ended ca. 1000 BCE and the Iron IIA was dated from 1000 BCE until the campaign of Pharaoh Sheshonq I (biblical Shishak) ca. 925 BCE. The two Iron IIA palaces at Megiddo were conceived as the material manifestation for the Solomonic Empire.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Y. Yadin, Megiddo of the Kings of Israel, Biblical Archaeologist 33 (1970), pp. 65-96.&lt;/ref&gt;  While preparing for the excavations at Megiddo in the early 1990s, Finkelstein noticed difficulties in this scheme. Noteworthy among them is the appearance of similar traits of material culture at Megiddo in a layer that was dated to the time of King Solomon in the middle of the 10th century, and at Samaria and Jezreel in contexts dated to the time of the Omride Dynasty (of the Northern Kingdom of Israel) in the early 9th century BCE. To resolve these difficulties, Finkelstein proposed to "lower" the dates of the Iron Age strata in the Levant by several decades.&lt;ref&gt;I. Finkelstein, The Archaeology of the United Monarchy: An Alternative View, Levant 28 (1996), pp. 177-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Finkelstein's Low Chronology, the Iron Age I lasted until the middle of the 10th century BCE, while the Iron IIA is dated between the middle of the 10th century and ca. 800 BCE, if not slightly later. This means that the Megiddo palaces and other features which had traditionally been attributed to the time of King Solomon – features which date to the late Iron IIA – should indeed be associated with the endeavors of the Omride Dynasty in the first half of the 9th century BCE. A big debate ensued.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, A. Mazar, Iron Age Chronology: A Reply to I. Finkelstein, Levant 29 (1997), pp. 157-167.&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in the late 1990s, the focus of the discussion shifted to the interpretation of radiocarbon determinations for organic samples from key sites, such as Tel Rehov and Megiddo. All in all, the radiocarbon results put the Iron I/IIA transition ca. the middle of the 10th century (rather than 1000 BCE as had traditionally been proposed), and the Iron IIA/B transition in the early days of the 8th century (rather than ca. 925 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;For instance, I. Finkelstein and E. Piasetzky, Radiocarbon Dating the Iron Age in the Levant: A Bayesian Model for Six Ceramic Phases and Six Transitions, Antiquity 84 (2010), pp. 374–385. Iron Age Chronology Debate: Is the Gap Narrowing? Another Viewpoint, Near Eastern Archaeology 74 (2011), pp. 105-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, and not directly connected, Finkelstein dealt with the chronology of Philistine pottery of the Iron Age I. The traditional theory fixed the appearance of Philistine pottery – and hence the settlement of the Philistines in the southern coastal plain of the Levant – in accordance with the confrontation between Ramses III and the Sea Peoples in the early 12th century BCE. In other words, Philistine pottery appears during the last phase of Egyptian rule in Canaan.&lt;ref&gt;A. Mazar, The Emergence of the Philistine Culture. Israel Exploration Journal 35 (1985), pp. 95–107; L.E. Stager, The Impact of the Sea Peoples in Canaan (1185-1050 BCE), in T.E. Levy (ed.), Archaeology of Society in the Holy Land. London 1995, pp. 332–348.&lt;/ref&gt; Finkelstein proposed that the locally-made Monochrome pottery known from several sites in Philistia, which is widely understood as representing the earliest phase of Philistine settlement, should be dated after the withdrawal of Egypt from Canaan in the 1130s.&lt;ref&gt;I. Finkelstein, The Date of the Philistine Settlement in Canaan, Tel Aviv 22 (1995), pp. 213-239; for radiocarbon results see I. Finkelstein and E. Piasetzky, Radiocarbon Dating Khirbet Qeiyafa and the Iron I-IIA Phases in the Shephelah: Methodological Comments and a Bayesian Model, Radiocarbon 57 (2015), pp. 891–907.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkelstein sees the biblical description of the time of David and Solomon as multilayered. He acknowledges the historicity of the founders of the Davidic Dynasty, places them in the 10th century BCE, and considers the possibility that the description of the rise of David to power conceals old memories of his activity as a leader of an Apiru-band that was active in the southern fringe of Judah. Yet, he sees the description of a great United Monarchy as an ideological construct that represents the ideology of late-monarchic author/s in the late 7th century BCE, first and foremost the pan-Israelite ideology of the days of King Josiah of Judah. According to him, the historical David and Solomon ruled over a small territory in the southern highlands – a territory not very different from that of Jerusalem of the Late Bronze Age. Finkelstein sees much of the description of King Solomon as representing realities from late monarchic times: First, from the later days of the Northern Kingdom (for instance, the reference to Megiddo, Hazor and Gezer in 1 Kings 9:15 and to the stables, horses and chariots of Solomon). Second, from the time of King Manasseh of Judah in the early 7th century BCE, under Assyrian domination (for instance, the visit of the Queen of Sheba in Jerusalem).&lt;ref&gt;I. Finkelstein and N.A. Silberman, David and Solomon: In Search of the Bible's Sacred Kings and the Roots of the Western Tradition, New York 2006, pp. 151-178.&lt;/ref&gt; He understands the description of the Philistines in the Bible as portraying realities in Philistia in late-monarchic times.&lt;ref&gt;I. Finkelstein, The Philistines in the Bible: A Late-Monarchic Perspective, Journal for the Study of the Old Testament 27 (2002), pp. 131-167.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "New Canaan" ===
Following the results of the excavations at Megiddo, Finkelstein argued that the material culture of the Iron I in the northern valleys continues that of the Late Bronze Age. In other words, the collapse of the Late Bronze city-states under Egyptian domination in the late 12th century BCE was followed by revival of some of the same centers and rise of others in the Iron I. He termed this phenomenon "New Canaan".&lt;ref&gt;I. Finkelstein, City States and States: Polity Dynamics in the 10th-9th Centuries B.C.E, in W.G. Dever and S. Gitin (eds.), Symbiosis, Symbolism and the Power of the Past: Canaan, Ancient Israel, and their Neighbors, Winona Lake 2003, pp. 75-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the major break in the material culture of Canaan took place at the end of the Iron I in the 10th century BCE rather than the end of the Late Bronze Age. Finkelstein associated the violent destruction of the revived city-states with the expansion of the highlanders (early Israelites). He suggested that memories of the turmoil in the lowlands in the late Iron I can be found in northern traditions regarding skirmishes with Canaanite cities which appear in the heroic stories in the Book of Judges.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, I. Finkelstein, Historical-Geographical Observations on the Ehud-Eglon Tale in Judges, in I. Finkelstein, T. Römer and C. Robin (eds.), Alphabets, Texts and Artefacts in the Ancient Near East, Studies Presented to Benjamin Sass, Paris 2016, pp. 100-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Northern Kingdom ===
Finkelstein dealt with a variety of themes related to the archeology and history of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. He proposed that the first North Israelite territorial polity emerged in the Gibeon-Bethel plateau in the late Iron I and early Iron IIA. He found archaeological evidence for this in the system of fortified sites, such as Tell en-Nasbeh, Khirbet ed-Dawwara, et-Tell ("Ai") and Gibeon. Historical evidence for the existence of this polity can be found in the campaign of Pharaoh Sheshoqn I in this region in the middle-to-second half of the 10th century BCE. According to Finkelstein, positive memories in the Bible of the House of Saul, which originated from the North, represent this early Israelite entity. He suggested that this north Israelite polity ruled over much of the territory of the highlands, that it presented a threat to the interests of Egypt of the 22nd Dynasty in Canaan, and that it was taken over during the campaign of Sheshonq I.&lt;ref&gt;I. Finkelstein, The Forgotten Kingdom: The Archaeology and History of Northern Israel, Atlanta 2013, pp. 37-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkelstein proposed that in its early days, the Northern Kingdom (Jeroboam I and his successors) ruled over the Samaria Highlands, the western slopes of the Gilead and the area of the Jezreel Valley. The expansion of Israel further to the north came during the days of the Omride Dynasty in the first half of the 9th century BCE, and even more so in the time of Jeroboam II in the first half of the 8th century BCE. Finkelstein described the special features of "Omride Architecture" and, with his Megiddo team, dealt with different subjects related to the material culture of the Northern Kingdom, such as metallurgy and cult practices.

Finkelstein also reflected on biblical traditions related to the Northern Kingdom, such as the Jacob cycle in Genesis (a study carried out with Thomas Römer), the Exodus tradition, the heroic stories in the Book of Judges and remnants of royal traditions in the Books of Samuel and Kings.&lt;ref&gt;I. Finkelstein, Jeroboam, above n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  He suggested that these North Israelite traditions were first committed to writing in the days of Jeroboam II (first half of the 8th century BCE), that they were brought to Judah with Israelite refugees after the takeover of Israel by Assyria, and that they were later incorporated into the Judahite-dominated Bible. Finkelstein sees the biblical genre of deploying "history" in the service of royal ideology as emerging from Israel (the North) of the 8th century BCE.

=== Archaeology and History of Jerusalem ===
Finkelstein has recently dealt with the location of the ancient mound of Jerusalem (with Ido Koch and Oded Lipschits). The conventional wisdom sees that "City of David" ridge as the location of the original settlement of Jerusalem. Finkelstein and his colleagues argued that the "City of David" ridge does not have the silhouette of a mound; that it is located in topographical inferiority relative to the surrounding area; and that the archaeological record of the ridge does not include periods of habitation attested in reliable textual records. According to them, the most suitable location for the core of ancient Jerusalem is the Temple Mount. The large area of the Herodian platform (today's Harem esh-Sharif) may conceal a mound of five hectares and more, which – similar to other capital cities in the Levant – included both the royal compound and habitation quarters. Locating the mound of Ancient Jerusalem on the Temple Mound resolves many of the difficulties pertaining to the "City of David" ridge.&lt;ref&gt;I. Finkelstein, I. Koch and O. Lipschits, The Mound on the Mount: A Solution to the “Problem with Jerusalem”? Journal of Hebrew Scriptures 11 (2011, Article 12).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Finkelstein, the history of Jerusalem in biblical times should be viewed in terms of three main phases:

Firstly, until the 9th century BCE, Jerusalem was restricted to the mound on the Temple Mount and ruled over a modest area in the southern highlands. Accordingly, Jerusalem of the time of David and Solomon can be compared to Jerusalem of the Amarna period in the 14th century BCE: it had the size of a typical highlands mound (for instance, Shechem), ruled over a restricted area, but still had impact beyond the highlands.

Secondly, the first expansion of Jerusalem came in the 9th century BCE, perhaps in its second half, when the town grew significantly in a southerly direction. Remains of the Iron IIA were unearthed south of al-Aqsa Mosque, above the Gihon Spring and to the south of the Dung Gate of the Old City. In parallel to this development, Judah expanded to the Shephelah in the west and Beer-sheba Valley in the south, and for the first time became a territorial kingdom rather than a city-state restricted to the highlands.

Thirdly, the most impressive phase in the settlement history of Jerusalem commenced in the late 8th century BCE and lasted until its destruction by the Babylonians in 586 BCE. At that time Jerusalem expanded dramatically, to include the entire "City of David" ridge, as well as the "Western Hill" (the Armenian and Jewish Quarter of today's Old City). This expansion was the result of the arrival of Israelite refugees after the demise of the Northern Kingdom in 722-720 BCE. These groups brought with them traits of Northern material culture, and more important – their foundation myths, royal traditions and heroic stories. These Northern traditions were later incorporated into the Judahite Bible.

=== Jerusalem and Yehud/Judea of the Persian and Hellenistic Periods ===
Finkelstein noted that in the Persian Period, Jerusalem was limited to the mound on the Temple Mount – and even there was sparsely settled – and that Yehud of that time was also thinly settled. As the description of the construction of the wall of Jerusalem in Nehemiah 3 must relate to the big city (extending beyond the old mound on the Temple Mount), it probably portrays the construction of the fortifications by the Hasmoneans.

Finkelstein further noted that many of the sites mentioned in the lists of returnees in Ezra and Nehemiah were not inhabited in the Persian Period and hence sees these lists as reflecting the demographic situation in days of the Hasmoneans. The same holds true, in his opinion, for the genealogies in 1 Chronicles.&lt;ref&gt;I. Finkelstein, Jerusalem in the Persian (and Early Hellenistic) Period and the Wall of            Nehemiah, Journal for the Study of the Old Testament 32 (2008), pp. 501-520; idem, The Archaeology of the List of Returnees in Ezra and Nehemiah, Palestine Exploration Quarterly 140 (2008), pp. 7-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finkelstein then looked into the accounts of Judahite monarchs in 2 Chronicles, which do not appear in Kings. He called attention to similarities between these texts and 1 Maccabees, and proposed to understand Chronicles as representing legitimacy needs of the Hasmoneans. This means that at least 2 Chronicles dates to the late 2nd century BCE, probably to the days of John Hyrcanus.&lt;ref&gt;I. Finkelstein, The Expansion of Judah in II Chronicles: Territorial Legitimation for the Hasmoneans? Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft 127 (2015), pp. 669–695.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and recognition ==
Finkelstein is the Laureate of the Dan David Prize in 2005. The select committee noted that he is "widely regarded as a leading scholar in the archaeology of the Levant and as a foremost applicant of archaeological knowledge to reconstructing biblical Israelite history. He excels at creatively forging links between archaeology and the exact sciences and he has revolutionized many of these fields. … Finkelstein has had an impact on radically revising the history of Israel in the 10th and 9th centuries BCE. He has transformed the study of history and archaeology in Israeli universities, moving from a ‘monumental’ to a ‘systemic’ study of the archaeological evidence. He has taken what was becoming a rather staid and conservative discipline, with everyone in general agreement as to interpretation of excavation results, and has turned things upside down. … The study of these periods is never again going to be what it once was. … Israel Finkelstein has proven to be creative, generating scholarship no less than discussion, launching ideas and stimulating debates, fearlessly but with imagination and grace." &lt;ref name="dandavidprize.org" /&gt;

In 2014, Finkelstein was awarded the Prix Delalande Guérineau: Institut de France, l'Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, for his book Le Royaume biblique oublié (The Forgotten Kingdom).&lt;ref&gt;https://english.tau.ac.il/news/Prix_Delalande-Guerineau&lt;/ref&gt;

His other awards include the French decoration of Chevalier de l’ordre des Arts et des Lettres, (2009) and the Doctorat honoris causa of the University of Lausanne (2010).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2369">Prof '''John Kemp''' [[FRSE]] LLD (1763–1812) was a Scottish mathematician, who settled in New York for most of his life.

==Life==
He was born on 10 April 1763 at Achlossan near [[Aboyne]] in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the son of a farmer. He studied Mathematics at [[Aberdeen University]] and graduated in 1783. In the same year he emigrated to the United States of America, settling first in [[Virginia]] then moving to [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1785.

In 1786 he successfully applied to become Professor of Mathematics at [[Columbia University|Columbia College]] (later Columbia University), aged only 23. In 1795 he began teaching Geography in addition to Mathematics and in 1799 he also began teaching Natural Philosophy (Physics).&lt;ref&gt;https://math.temple.edu/~zit/Revolution/Bio/John%20Kemp.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1792 he was elected a Foreign Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]], [[Daniel Rutherford]] and [[John Playfair]]. He was not (as some records claim) one of the founders of the Society in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1810 he visited [[Lake Erie]] in relation to an assessment of the then-proposed canal project, and considered it wholly viable.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Kemp,_John_(1763-1812)_(DNB00)&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in New York on 15 November 1812 following a long illness. He married twice but both wives died. One daughter (by his first marriage) survived him.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Biography: James Kemp&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''I'm Alan Partridge'' episodes}} 
''[[I'm Alan Partridge]]'' is a [[BBC]] [[situation comedy]] starring [[Steve Coogan]], of which two series of six episodes each were produced—the first in 1997 and the second in 2002. The series followed the titular [[Alan Partridge]], a failed [[television presenter]] whose previous exploits had featured in the [[talk show|chat-show]] [[parody]] ''[[Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge (TV series)|Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge]]'', and who is now presenting a programme on local radio in [[Norwich]].

Both series were written by [[Peter Baynham]] (who also appears in one episode), Coogan and [[Armando Iannucci]]; supporting Coogan were [[Felicity Montagu]] as his faithful but timid [[personal assistant]], Lynn Benfield; [[Simon Greenall]] as [[Geordie]] Travel Tavern handyman/[[BP]] garage attendant Michael; and [[Phil Cornwell]] as [[disc jockey]] Dave Clifton.

It has been well received by both critics and fans, and was nominated for three [[BAFTA]]s (winning two), two [[British Comedy Award]] (winning both), and a [[Royal Television Society]] award.

Series one was first released on [[DVD]] in the UK in 2002 and in the United States on 24 October 2006. The DVD features additional scenes and two commentary tracks. One featuring standard commentary from the writers whilst the second features Coogan and Montagu 'in character' as Alan &amp; Lynn discussing the events in the episodes and frequently arguing with each other.

 | Title= A Room with an Alan
 | WrittenBy= Peter Baynham, Steve Coogan, Armando Iannucci&lt;ref name=RoomAlan/&gt;
 | DirectedBy=Dominic Brigstocke &lt;ref name=RoomAlan&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Two - I'm Alan Partridge|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0077cdt|website=BBC|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 | ShortSummary=Alan's wife Carol has kicked him out and he is living at [[Linton, Cambridgeshire|Linton]] Travel Tavern, a hotel near the [[A11 road (England)|A11]] in [[Cambridgeshire]]. He tells the hotel's manager Susan that his wife is living with a [[fitness instructor]] and that insulting [[graffiti]] has been sprayed on his car. He encounters [[handyman]] Michael, whom he asks to remove the graffiti, but has difficulty understanding Michael due to his strong [[Geordie]] accent.

Alan and Lynn view a 5-bedroomed [[show house]], where Alan displays his eccentric behaviour, and manages both to confuse and to bore the [[estate agent]]. Alan agrees to buy the house for [[pound sterling|£]]324,000, which is £1,000 less than its asking price.

Alan has lunch at [[BBC Television Centre]] with Tony Hayers ([[David Schneider (actor)|David Schneider]]), the fictional programme commissioner of the BBC, about the possibility of a second series of ''[[Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge (TV series)|Knowing Me, Knowing You]]''. Apparently unaware of how low his chances really are, he puts the nail in the coffin by reading out an array of ridiculous, badly thought-out programme ideas that bewilder and annoy Tony. When Tony tells him he is not to be re-commissioned, Alan thrusts a large lump of [[cheese]] into his face and flees the restaurant with the cheese. 

After talking to Lynn, Alan returns to his hotel room, attempts to order an [[Irish coffee]], turns on "[[Jet (song)|Jet]]" by [[Wings (band)|Wings]] and gives himself a [[black eye]] while attempting an athletic leap from his bed to the [[mini-bar]].&lt;ref name=Ep1.1&gt;{{cite web|title=I'm Alan Partridge - Episode 1.1|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/im_alan_partridge/episodes/1/1/|website=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | ShortSummary=Without a second series of his programme, Alan is nearing [[bankruptcy]] and chooses to [[dismissal (employment)|fire]] the staff at his company, Peartree Productions, rather than downsize his car. However, when the staff ask him if he has a second series, Alan panics, and tells them that he has been successful.

While the staff prepare a party, and Jill, his flirtatious, [[chain-smoking]], 50-year-old, divorced receptionist ([[Julia Deakin]]) goes out to buy some snacks, Alan tries to extricate himself by firing staff members for various "offences," such as leaving an unwashed coffee cup on the table and rolling eyes.  Whilst he locks himself in his [[boardroom]], the staff leave. Jill returns, wondering where everyone has got to (he tells her they have gone to a spice museum) and the two go on a [[dating|date]] to a nearby [[owl]] [[animal sanctuary|sanctuary]], where Alan's attempts at conversation bewilder Jill. In the evening, the two attend a [[Valentine's Day]] dinner at the Travel Tavern, where Alan makes a fool of himself by badly singing "[[(They Long to Be) Close to You|Close To You]]" by [[The Carpenters]] for her with the hired band, and Lynn attempts to sabotage Alan's evening with the uncouth Jill. Alan and Jill go to his room. Alan attempts to [[have sex]] with Jill while providing a [[running commentary]] and attempts a discussion of the [[pedestrianisation]] of the Norwich city centre to delay ejaculating. Jill's attempt at eroticism by putting chocolate [[mousse]] makes him angry so he ends his liaison with her. At the radio station that night, he announces on-air that he has sacked her.&lt;ref name=Ep1.2&gt;{{cite web|title=I'm Alan Partridge - Episode 1.2|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/im_alan_partridge/episodes/1/2/|website=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | ShortSummary= After making various unsympathetic comments about farming on his radio show, Alan becomes an object of hatred for local farmers. But he does not have time to worry about this as he is more concerned with shooting an advertisement for a small-boating holiday company. In the hotel's bar, during an initial interview with the video executives ([[Peter Baynham]] and [[Simon Pegg]]), Alan panics and invents the [[ladyboy]] drink combination, the effects of which result in him phoning Carol, where he tries to insult her partner's car.

On his radio show, Alan interviews the leader of the local [[National Farmers Union (England and Wales)|Farmers' Union]] ([[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]]), but instead of apologising, enrages local farmers even further by making increasingly insane comments about farmers. On the day of the video-shoot, Alan attempts to blend in with the hard-drinking crew and again displays his chronic lack of basic social skills. During the shoot, riddled with examples of Alan's pathetic ineptitude, he is crushed by a dead [[cow]] thrown from a bridge by the disgruntled local farmers.

Alan returns from hospital with a neck brace and broken fingers, and is forced to humiliate himself by phoning reception and asking Susan to 'make [[pornography]] come on my television', after previously asking for such channels to be disconnected after the staff found out that he had watched [[Bangkok]] [[kathoey|Chickboys]]. He discovers his request to be a pointless waste of time, due to his hand injury.&lt;ref name=Ep1.3&gt;{{cite web|title=I'm Alan Partridge - Episode 1.3|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/im_alan_partridge/episodes/1/3/|website=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | ShortSummary= There are major refurbishments taking place at the hotel, during which the hotel is closed, leaving Alan as the only guest. Throughout the episode, he is desperately bored and does various things to pass the time, including dismantling a [[trouser press]], walking along a dual carriageway to a petrol station to buy several bottles of [[windscreen washer]] fluid, driving round the [[ring road]] three times, buying some tungsten-tipped screws he never intends to use and dressing up as a [[zombie]] in a poorly planned [[practical joke]]. His boredom culminates with an incompetent attempt to steal a traffic cone, with Michael and Lynn.&lt;ref name=Ep1.4&gt;{{cite web|title=I'm Alan Partridge - Episode 1.4|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/im_alan_partridge/episodes/1/4/|website=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | ShortSummary= Alan hosts "An Afternoon with Alan Partridge" at the hotel which is attended by his self-confessed "biggest fan", Jed Maxwell. He is also visited by Irish network executives ([[Graham Linehan]] and [[Arthur Mathews (writer)|Arthur Mathews]]) who are considering giving him a show on [[Irish television]]. Naturally, they are less than impressed by Alan (particularly regarding his ignorant take on [[the Troubles]] and his misunderstanding of the [[U2]] song "[[Sunday Bloody Sunday]]"), though they do get along very well with Lynn. Through a series of mishaps, the three of them end up at Jed's house. Having no home of his own, Alan pretends he cohabits with Jed, with extremely awkward consequences. After Alan and the Irishmen discover that Jed's fandom is of a highly obsessive nature, with one of the rooms acting as shrine to the presenter, the two executives make their excuses and leave, leaving Alan alone. Alan becomes increasingly worried about his own safety and, following an altercation with Jed, he escapes and is seen running across nearby fields to flee the crazed and embittered fan.&lt;ref name=Ep1.5&gt;{{cite web|title=I'm Alan Partridge - Episode 1.5|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/im_alan_partridge/episodes/1/5/|website=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | ShortSummary=After a depressing afternoon hosting a small village fayre and judging the vegetable competition, Alan is delighted to discover that Tony has died and his successor, Chris Feather, had always supported and liked Alan. Attending Hayers' [[funeral]] (he knows that Chris will be there) he immediately snaps up the opportunity to finally win his sought-after second series, but not before Chris' sudden death threatens to throw his dream into tatters.

The series ends with a party in Alan's room as Alan and Lynn tidied up to the theme from ''[[The Adventures of Black Beauty]]'', after all the guests have prematurely left. The series ends on an upbeat note, with Alan pleased with himself.&lt;ref name=Ep1.6&gt;{{cite web|title=I'm Alan Partridge - Episode 1.6|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/im_alan_partridge/episodes/1/6/|website=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | ProdCode= 
 | ShortSummary=While visiting Michael at the petrol station, Alan has a chance meeting with his old teacher Frank "Sweaty" (or "Cacky") Raphael ([[Andrew Burt]], who also provided the voice-overs for the various Radio Norwich jingles in both series). Alan convinces Raphael to let him give a talk to the sixth formers at the school where Raphael is now headmaster.
Whilst at the school, Alan bumps into an old schoolmate who is now a teacher ([[Ian Puleston-Davies]]). They try to reminisce over old times, but Alan still holds a grudge against this man, who once drew a penis on the back of his school blazer in chalk; which Alan was caned for.
Later Alan begins his talk to the students which, of course, all goes wrong. Alan ends up insulting Raphael for caning him when he was younger and also insults his schoolmate for "getting the lab assistant pregnant, and never sees the kid."  All of this results in Alan receiving a stern talking-to in the headmaster's office.
Towards the end of the episode, the reviled schoolmate comes into the petrol station; Alan, thinking he has come to fight, tries to threaten him with an apple turnover. The schoolmate apologises to Alan and hopes that they can be friends again, but as the schoolmate leaves the petrol station a customer tells him that he has got something on his back: Alan got Lynn to draw an anatomically dubious chalk 'penis' on his back.&lt;ref name=Ep2.1&gt;{{cite web|title=I'm Alan Partridge - Episode 2.1|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/im_alan_partridge/episodes/2/1/|website=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | ProdCode= 
 | ShortSummary=Michael comes to stay for a few days after his front door is stolen; Alan is asked to present a sales conference for "Dante's of Reading," a company that supplies coal-effect fires and fireplaces. Dante's Piet Morant (Steve Brody), a South African, visits Alan's partially built house.
After his frequent pranks with the security staff at his country club backfire and the police are called, Alan is forced to bring Piet to his partially built house. Lynn and Michael improvise some makeshift furniture in the empty house: they balance a toilet door on a [[Black &amp; Decker]] Workmate for a table and attach several torches to a bicycle wheel for lighting.  This fails to impress Morant, who is even less impressed by Alan's attempt at a South African accent or his misunderstanding of Piets pronunciation of the word 'can't'.
Nevertheless, Alan is awarded the job, but tragedy ensues when Alan tries to climb over a country club's fence and impales his foot on a metal spike. Lynn tells him to stay in hospital but Alan is completely adamant about doing the speech for "Dante's of Reading." Unfortunately, his dry vomiting and foot pain turn his speech into a disaster.&lt;ref name=Ep2.2&gt;{{cite web|title=I'm Alan Partridge - Episode 2.2|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/im_alan_partridge/episodes/2/2/|website=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | ShortSummary=Alan makes a new friend at the BP garage, Dan ([[Stephen Mangan]]). They both like the same beer, use the same deodorant, and drive 'Lexii' ("the plural of Lexus").
Dan owns "Kitchen Planet" on the A416 (road) and arranges for Alan to present the [[Colman's]] Mustard Bravery Awards. Alan's attempts to impress Karen Colman are hugely unsuccessful; he even admits to her that he had mental health issues. She strikes up an instant rapport with Sonia, however, later inviting her back to her house without Alan.
On hearing that the Colmans' family motto is "Too much [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]] gets up your nose," Alan tries desperately to impress her by eating a big spoonful of mustard. However, an unimpressed Karen has put this down to Alan's previously declared "mental health", leaving him further humiliated.
Later, at Dan's home, Alan finds out that Dan and his wife enjoy a deviantly spicy lifestyle; to his great discomfort, they show him a tape of them having intercourse.&lt;ref name=Ep2.3&gt;{{cite web|title=I'm Alan Partridge - Episode 2.3|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/im_alan_partridge/episodes/2/3/|website=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | ShortSummary=Alan plans a [[James Bond|Bond]]-athon (watching all the Bond films in sequential order) for the [[bank holiday]] weekend with Michael. Lynn reveals to Alan that she has a new friend, Gordon, an ex-policeman who threatens Alan for mistreating Lynn at times.
The Bond weekend all goes pear-shaped when Lynn accidentally destroys his Bond movies after spilling [[SunnyD|Sunny Delight]] over them. Alan is about to give her the full force of his anger when Gordon stands up next to her: Alan panics, backs down and decides to take his anger out on his breakfast cereals instead.
When he discovers that Michael has another friend, Tex ([[Peter Serafinowicz]]), he becomes jealous and falls out with Michael, un-inviting him to the Bond-athon. Alan targets John the builder for his new friend/protector-from-Gordon. After patching things up with Michael, Alan discovers that Tex has taped over the one undamaged Bond film with an episode of "America's Strongest Man."
Because of this, he declares himself "Norfolk's Maddest Man" and decides to give the group a physical run-through of the entire [[opening sequence]] of ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]''.&lt;ref name=Ep2.4&gt;{{cite web|title=I'm Alan Partridge - Episode 2.4|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/im_alan_partridge/episodes/2/4/|website=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | Title=I Know What Alan Did Last Summer

 | ProdCode= 
 | ShortSummary=The [[Inland Revenue]] are due to call and carry out a random investigation on Alan's business affairs, causing him to worry. The Inland Revenue people arrive earlier than the set time, catching Alan dancing around (playing air bass) in his caravan to [[Gary Numan]]'s "[[Music for Chameleons (song)|Music for Chameleons]]".
During the investigation, Alan offers the two "inspectresses" a beer (which they decline) and insists that they can't have any "Mini [[Babybel]]s" as they are for the car when he's driving to Harrogate. Alan makes a fool out of himself several more times, including trying to walk like [[R2-D2]], raising his legs,  and "accidentally on purpose" breaking wind (claiming it was "mostly deliberate") right next to the Inland Revenue people. This leads to him having a minor argument with Sonia, which is all seen by the tax people. In order to make things up to her, he takes her to [[Bono]]'s house (really [[Blickling Hall]]), after falsely claiming to be a personal friend of his.  Lynn also gets a friend of hers from the Baptist Church to pretend to be Bono, even giving him her mother's [[cataract]] glasses to wear in hope that Sonia would be convinced he is Bono.
Alan is rumbled by Sonia and by way of apology for the deception ''and'' for stabbing a giant teddy bear beefeater that Sonia bought him (with a receipt spike; on entering the static caravan, he mistook the bear for a burglar), he grudgingly consents to take her to London.&lt;ref name=Ep2.5&gt;{{cite web|title=I'm Alan Partridge - Episode 2.5|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/im_alan_partridge/episodes/2/5/|website=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | ShortSummary=The building work on Alan's house is finally complete and Sonia is angling to cohabit. Alan however, has other ideas and tries to "come to some arrangement" with her.  He is interviewed on a radio show called Prayer Wave, where his insensitive comments result in one of the guests ([[Julia Davis]]) walking out.
After this, he attends Lynn's baptism at her church where he simulates blowing his head off with a shotgun and assaults one of the guests ([[Rob Brydon]]) who questions Alan's anecdote-writing ability.
Meanwhile, with "[[The Windmills of Your Mind]]" playing on the soundtrack, the remaining 14,000 unsold copies of Alan's book, "Bouncing Back," are [[pulped]]. Alan takes some away with him in a plastic bag as mementoes.&lt;ref name=Ep2.6&gt;{{cite web|title=I'm Alan Partridge - Episode 2.6|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/im_alan_partridge/episodes/2/6/|website=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two leaders later participated in a joint press conference, where President Obama declared a "new day" in Cuba–U.S. relations but acknowledged President Castro's statement regarding the "profound differences" between their two countries regarding human rights and democracy, which Obama criticized. Obama also added that the [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo against Cuba]] and the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] continue to be obstructions in the normalization and restoration of the two countries' relations, wherein Castro responded saying that it would be "the most important obstacle to our economic development and the well-being of the Cuban people." In addition, Castro criticized the U.S.' demand for a human rights reform in Cuba, saying that "Cuba believes civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights are universal" and later adding that Cuba opposes "political manipulation and double standards in the approach to human rights."

[[Image:El Salvador municipalities.png|thumb|left|300px|Municipalities of El Salvador]]

The [[Departments of El Salvador|departments]] of [[El Salvador]] are divided into 262 [[municipality|municipalities]] or ''[[municipios]]''. The municipalities are listed below, by department El Salvador is divided into fourteen administrative divisions called departments, the equivalent of states in the U.S. Each department is administered by a governor appointed by the president. An alternate for each governor is also designated. Governors must be Salvadoran by birth, at least 25, and residents of their department for at least two years prior to their appointment. 

Below the departmental level, El Salvador is divided into 263 municipalities. Each is governed by a municipal council composed of a mayor (''alcalde''), a legal representative (''sindico''), and two or more council members (''regidores''). The number of members is determined by population. Members of the municipal councils must be both at least 21 and residents of the municipality.

Directly elected, municipal officials serve three-year terms and may be re-elected. Municipios are not all of equal size but are required to have a population of at least 10,000. Boundaries are determined by the Legislative Assembly. 

The powers of local government are those given by the central government. Because department governors are appointed by the president, their independence is questionable. Despite their status as elected representatives, the powers of municipal officeholders are also limited in certain key areas. The most glaring example is taxation. 

Although the municipal councils are allowed to suggest local taxes and tax rates, only the Legislative Assembly has the power to levy the taxes. Therefore, all funds used by the councils are appropriated and disbursed by the assembly, but such funds are earmarked in the budget and are not incorporated into the central government's general fund.

Among the duties relegated to the municipal councils under the Salvadoran Municipal Code is the holding of town meetings (''cabildos abiertos'') at least once every three months.

The council is enjoined from acting against the majority opinion expressed at the town meetings. The municipal councils also grant legal recognition (personalidad juridica) to communal associations in their municipios. The councils are required to meet periodically with representatives of the communal associations and to consult with them on the appointment of representatives to advisory and other local commissions. The councils also issue local ordinances and regulations.

{{wiktionary|Beijing|北京}}
"'''Beijing'''" is the [[Chinese tones|atonal]] pinyin romanisation of the [[standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] pronunciation of the [[Chinese characters]] '''{{lang|zh|北京}}''', the Chinese name of the capital of the [[People's Republic of China]].

The spelling Beijing was adopted for use within China upon the approval of [[Hanyu Pinyin]] on February 11, 1958, during the Fifth Session of the [[1st National People's Congress]]. It became obligatory for all foreign publications issued by the People's Republic on 1 January 1979. It was gradually adopted by various news organizations, governments, and international agencies over the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;''Lost Laowai''. "[http://www.lostlaowai.com/blog/china-stuff/from-peking-to-beijing-a-long-and-bumpy-trip/ From Peking to Beijing: A Long and Bumpy Trip]". Accessed 21 Oct 2012.&lt;!--replace when possible with more authoritative source--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Chinese characters]] {{lang|zh|北}} ("north") and {{lang|zh|京}} ("capital") together mean the "Northern Capital". The name was first used during the reign of the [[Ming dynasty]]'s [[Yongle Emperor]], who made his northern fief a second capital along with [[Nanjing]] ({{lang|zh|南京}}, the "Southern Capital") in 1403 after successfully dethroning his nephew during the [[Jingnan Campaign]]. The name was restored in 1949 at the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]].

"Peking" is a spelling created by French missionaries of the 17th and 18th centuries. In ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]'' (1615), [[Matteo Ricci]] calls the city ''Pechinum''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iLsWAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=pechinum&amp;f=false De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas], pp. x, 321, 378&lt;/ref&gt; (The English translation gives ''Pequin''.&lt;ref&gt;*''A discourse of the Kingdome of China, taken out of Ricius and Trigautius, containing the countrey, people, government, religion, rites, sects, characters, studies, arts, acts ; and a Map of China added, drawne out of one there made with Annotations for the understanding thereof'', and ''A continuation of the Jesuites Acts and observations in China till Ricius his death and some yeers after. Of Hanceu or Quinsay.'' (excerpts from ''De Christiana expeditione'', in English translation) in ''[[Samuel Purchas|Purchas his Pilgrimes]]'', Volume XII (1625), Chapters VII and VIII.

Peking was the English name of the city until the adoption of pinyin. However, it is still employed adjectivally in terms such as "[[Pekingese]]", "[[Peking duck]]", "[[Peking Man]]" and various others. The name remains in common and official use in many other languages.

==Historical names of Beijing==
The city has had many other names. The chronological list below sets out both the names of the city itself, and, in earlier times, the names of the [[history of Chinese administrative regions|administrative entities]] within the city today.
* '''[[Jicheng (Beijing)|Ji]]''' and '''[[Jicheng (Beijing)|Jicheng]]''': The first major known settlement was the eponymous capital of the ancient [[Ji (state)|Ji]] state between the 11th and 7th centuries BC. The settlement was also known as Jicheng. It was located in the current city's [[Guang'anmen]] neighborhood south of the [[Beijing West Railway Station]]. 
** '''Ji''': {{zh|t={{linktext|薊}}|s={{linktext|蓟}}|p=Jì|w=Chi}}
** '''Jicheng''': {{zh|c={{linktext|薊|城}}|p=Jìchéng|w=Chi-cheng|l=Ji City}}
* '''Yan''' and '''[[Yanjing]]''': Ji was conquered by [[State of Yan|Yan]] around the 7th century BC but was employed as its conqueror's new capital and therefore also known as Yan and [[Yanjing]]. The name was employed in the titles of [[An Lushan]] (as Emperor of Yan), [[Liu Rengong]] (as King of Yan), and the [[Prince of Yan|Princes of Yan]]. The [[Khitans]] of the 10th- to 12th-century [[Liao Dynasty]] fully restored the name Yanjing and it remains a common informal name for Beijing, as reflected in the locally brewed [[Yanjing Beer]] and the former [[Yenching University]] (since merged into [[Peking University]]).
** '''Yan''': {{zh|c={{linktext|燕}}|p=Yān|w=Yen}}
** '''Yanjing''': {{zh|c={{linktext|燕京}}|p=Yānjīng}}
* '''Guangyang''': After the [[Qin (state)|Qin]] conquest, Ji was made the capital of the [[Guangyang Commandery]].
** {{zh|t={{linktext|廣|陽|郡}}|s={{linktext|广|阳|郡}}|p=Guǎngyángjùn|w=Kuang-yang Chün}}
* '''Fanyang''' and '''Yuyang''': During the [[Han Dynasty]], the commandery was renamed [[Yuyang Commandery|Yuyang]] and the city itself renamed [[Fanyang]].
** '''Yuyang''': {{zh|t={{linktext|漁|陽|郡}}|s={{linktext|渔|阳|郡}}|p=Yúyángjùn|w=Yü-yang Chün}}
** '''Fanyang''': {{zh|t={{linktext|范|陽}}|s={{linktext|范|阳}}|p=Fànyáng|w=Fan-yang}}
* '''Jixian''': From the 1st century BC until at least the AD 4th-century [[Western Jin dynasty]], Jixian served as the capital of [[Youzhou]] [[zhou (region)|province]].
** {{zh|t={{linktext|薊縣}}|s={{linktext|蓟县}}|p=Jìxiàn|w=Chi-hsien}}
* '''[[Youzhou]]''': Under the [[Tang Dynasty]], the city generally employed '''Youzhou''' as its name. During the [[Tianbao Era]] of Emperor [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Xuanzong]], however, the name Fanyang was restored [[Fanyang Commandery|as its own commandery]].
** {{zh|c={{linktext|幽|州}}|p=Yōuzhōu|w=Yu-chou}}
* '''Nanjing''': In the 10th and 12th centuries, the northerly [[Liao Dynasty]] restored the name Yanjing. They also knew the city as Nanjing as it was the southernmost of their secondary capitals.
** {{zh|t={{linktext|南京}}|p=Nánjīng|w=Nan-ching}}
* '''Zhongdu''': During the 12th-century [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Later Jin dynasty]], it was known as Zhongdu.
** {{zh|c={{linktext|中都}}|p=Zhōngdū|l=Central Capital}}
* '''Khanbaliq''': The [[Mongolian Empire|Mongolian]] [[Yuan Dynasty]] originally restored the name Yanjing before constructing a new capital adjacent to the former settlement. This settlement was called '''[[Khanbaliq|Dadu]]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Chinese and '''Daidu''' in Mongolian.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Twitchett, Herbert Franke, John K. Fairbank, in ''The Cambridge History of China: Volume 6, Alien Regimes and Border States'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), p 454.&lt;/ref&gt; (As [[Khanbaliq]], it was noted as '''Cambuluc'''&lt;ref name="columbia encyclopedia"/&gt; by [[Marco Polo]].) This city gradually absorbed the former settlements around the area.
** {{zh|c={{linktext|大|都}}|p=Dàdū|l=Great Capital}}
* '''Beiping''': Under the [[Ming Dynasty]], the city itself was initially known as Beiping. The name reads literally as "Northern Peace", although its usage and connotations are closer to the idea of "Northern Plains".
** {{zh|c={{linktext|北平}}|p=Běipíng|w=Pei-p'ing|l=Northern Peace}}
* '''Shuntian''' and '''Beizhili''': When the usurping [[Yongle Emperor]] established his base of Beiping as a secondary capital in 1403, he renamed the town Shuntian and the province-level region surrounding it Beizhili to mimic the names of Yingtian (modern [[Nanjing]]) and the province of Zhili that surrounds it.&lt;ref name="minggov"&gt;Hucker, Charles O. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2718619 Governmental Organization of The Ming Dynasty]", p. 5{{ndash}}6. ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies'', Vol. 21 (Dec. 1958). Harvard-Yenching Institute. Accessed 20 Oct 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
** '''Shuntian''': {{zh|t={{linktext|順天}}|s={{linktext|顺天}}|p=Shùntiān|w=Shün-t'ien|l=Obedient to Heaven}}
** '''Beizhili''': {{zh|t=北{{linktext|直隸}}|s=北直隶|p=Běizhílì|w=Pei-chih-li}}
* '''Jingshi''' and '''Beijing''': When the [[Forbidden City|palace]] was finally completed in 1420, the [[Yongle Emperor]] moved the majority of his court north. The name Jingshi ceased to be used for Yingtian and was now employed for Shuntian. The area around Yingtian became known as [[Nanjing]] while Beijing was used to describe the area directly administered by the capital (generally modern [[Hebei]]).&lt;ref name="minggov"/&gt;
** '''Jingshi''': {{zh|t={{linktext|京師}}|s={{linktext|京师}}|p=Jīngshī|w=Ching-shih|l=Capital}}
* '''Beiping''', in both its connotations, was restored as the name in 1928 by the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] following its reconquest of Beijing from the warlords during the [[Northern Expedition]].&lt;ref name="columbia encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia
 |title=Beijing
 |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Beijing.aspx
 |encyclopedia=[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]
 |edition=6th
 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The occupying Japanese in 1937 imposed the name Peking (Beijing), then with their surrender in 1945, the Nationalist Government restored "Beiping". In 1949, the official name again reverted to "Peking" (the Postal Romanization) when the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communists]] conquered the capital during the [[Chinese Civil War]] and founded the [[People's Republic of China]]. As noted above, the ''pinyin'' romanization, "Beijing", was adopted for use within the country in 1958, and for international use in 1979. The American government continued to follow the Nationalist government in using "Beiping" until the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="columbia encyclopedia"/&gt;
** {{zh|c=北平|p=Běipíng}}

==Abbreviation==
In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the abbreviation of Beijing is its second character '''{{lang|zh|{{linktext|京}}}}''' ("Capital"). This is employed, for example, as the prefix on all Beijing-issued [[Transportation in China#Motor vehicles|licence plates]].

In the [[Latin alphabet]], the official abbreviation are the two initials of the region's characters: '''[[BJ (disambiguation)#Abbreviation|BJ]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Standardization Administration of China]] (SAC). "[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~chgis/work/design/chinastdb_1210.doc GB/T-2260: Codes for the administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China]".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beijing Capital International Airport]]'s IATA code is [[Beijing Capital International Airport|PEK]], based on the former spelling Peking.

==Similarly-named cities==
In addition to [[Nanjing]], several other [[East Asia]]n cities have similar names in Chinese characters despite appearing dissimilar in English [[transliteration]]. The most prominent is [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], whose ''[[kanji|Han script]]'' name is written {{lang|ja|東京}} (''Dongjing'', or "Eastern Capital"). {{lang|zh|東京}} was also a former name of [[Hanoi]] (as ''[[Đông Kinh]]'' or "[[Tonkin]]") in [[Vietnam]] during the [[Later Lê Dynasty]]. A former name of [[Seoul]] in [[South Korea]] was [[Gyeongseong]], written in ''[[hanja|Han script]]'' as {{lang|zh|京城}} or "Capital City". [[Kyoto]] in Japan still bears the similar-meaning characters {{lang|ja|京都}}: the character "都", ''du'' in Chinese, can also mean "capital".

The history of China since the [[Tang dynasty]] has also been full of secondary capitals with directional names. Under the Tang, these were Beidu ("north capital", at [[Taiyuan]] in [[Shanxi]]); [[Nandu (disambiguation)|Nandu]] ("south capital", first, [[Chengdu]] in [[Sichuan]] and, later, [[Jiangling County|Jiangling]] in [[Hubei]]); Dongdu ("east capital", [[Luoyang]] in [[Henan]]); and Xidu ("west capital", [[Fengxiang]] in [[Shaanxi]]).&lt;ref name="chiknotang"&gt;Theobald, Ulrich. ''China Knowledge''. "[http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Tang/tang-map.html Chinese History - Tang Dynasty 唐 (618-907): Map and Geography]". Accessed 19 Oct 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two previous Beijings: one, the northern capital of the [[Northern Song dynasty|Northern Song]] at modern [[Daming County|Daming]] in [[Hebei]];&lt;ref name="chiknosong"&gt;Theobald, Ulrich. ''China Knowledge''. "[http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Song/song-map.html Chinese History - Song Dynasty 宋 (960-1279): Map and Geography]". Accessed 19 Oct 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; the other, the northern capital of the [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jurchen Jin]] located at [[Ningcheng]] in [[Inner Mongolia]].&lt;ref name="chiknojin"/&gt;

The Nanjing of the Northern Song was located at [[Shangqiu]] in [[Henan]].&lt;ref name="chiknosong"/&gt; The Jurchen Jin located theirs at [[Kaifeng]],&lt;ref name="chiknojin"&gt;Theobald, Ulrich. ''China Knowledge''. "[http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Song/jinn-map.html Chinese History - Jin dynasty 金 (1115–1234): Map and Geography]". Accessed 19 Oct 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;) which had been the Northern Song's "Dongjing".&lt;ref name="chiknosong"/&gt; The Jurchen Jin also had a Dongjing ("Eastern Capital"), which was, however, located at [[Liaoyang]] in [[Liaoning]].&lt;ref name="chiknojin"/&gt; Apart from these, there were two [[Xijing (disambiguation)|Xijing]]s ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|西}}京}}, "Western Capital"): one was the "Western Capital" of the [[Northern Song dynasty]], located at [[Luoyang]];&lt;ref name="chiknosong"/&gt; the other was held by the [[Liao dynasty|Liao]]&lt;ref name="chiknolia"/&gt; and Jurchen Jin&lt;ref name="chiknojin"/&gt; at [[Datong]]. Liaoyang was the Zhongjing ({{lang|zh|中京}}, "Central Capital") of the Liao dynasty&lt;ref name="chiknolia"&gt;Theobald, Ulrich. ''China Knowledge''. "[http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Song/liao-map.html Chinese History - Liao Dynasty 遼 (907-1125): Map and Geography]". Accessed 19 Oct 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and, finally, another Zhongdu ("Central Capital") was planned but never completed. It was the proposed capital of the [[Ming Dynasty]] mooted by the [[Hongwu Emperor]] in the 14th century, to be located on the site of his destroyed childhood village of Zhongli ({{lang|zh|鍾離}}), now [[Fengyang County|Fengyang]] in [[Anhui]].&lt;ref name=dan&gt;Eric N.

The '''names of Singapore''' include the various historical appellations as well as contemporary names and nicknames in different languages used to describe the island, city or country of [[Singapore]]. A number of different names have been given to the settlement or the island of Singapore all through history, the earliest record may have been from the 2nd century AD. Possible mentions of [[Pulau Ujong]], the name for the island of Singapore, may be found in Chinese works, and it was also referred to as [[Temasek]] in Malay and Javanese literature. Sometime in the 14 century the name was changed to Singapura, which is now rendered as [[Singapore]] in English.  Singapura means "Lion City" in Sanskrit, and [[Sang Nila Utama]] is usually credited with naming the city, although its actual origin is uncertain.&lt;ref name="turnbull"/&gt;

==Etymology of Singapore==
The English language name Singapore comes from its [[Malay language|Malay]] name ''Singapura'', which is derived from [[Sanskrit Language|Sanskrit]] meaning "Lion City".&lt;ref name="historySG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sommerville|first1=Maxwell |title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, and general literature, 9:22|date=1894|publisher= Adam and Charles Black, London, United Kingdom|page=94 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951t002526396;view=1up;seq=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Singa'' comes from the Sanskrit word ''siṃha'' (सिंह), which means "lion", and ''pūra'' (पुर) means "city" in Sanskrit and is a common suffix in many Indian place names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ck1CLzJq9vAC&amp;pg=PA905#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Namenforschung / Name Studies / Les noms propres. 1. Halbband |editor= Ernst Eichler|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=9783110203424 |page=905|date=1995-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanskrit was used as it was considered for a long period the prestigious international language of the region.  [[Sang Nila Utama]], said to be the founder of Singapura in the late 13th century who  gave the city its name, also acquired a Sanskrit name Sri Tri Buana.&lt;ref name="miksic"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMt3BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Singapore and the Silk Road of the Sea, 1300_1800|author= John N. Miksic |publisher=NUS Press |date=15 November 2013|isbn= 978-9971695743|page=151 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Singapura and its related forms were fairly common in early South East Asia, with a few cities given the same name – the earliest one known is ''[[Trà Kiệu|Simhapura]]'' in what is now Vietnam established by the [[Cham people]] in the fifth century, others were found in Thailand and Java. The name also appears in Buddhist [[jataka tales]] and in the ''[[Ramayana]]''.&lt;ref name="miksic"/&gt;

According to the ''[[Malay Annals]]'', Singapore was named after a strange beast seen by Sri Tri Buana while hunting in [[Temasek]], and he was informed that the beast must have been a lion. He then decided to stay in Temasek and named the city he founded Singapura or "Lion City".&lt;ref name="miksic 1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMt3BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Singapore and the Silk Road of the Sea, 1300_1800|author= John N.

The ''[[Malay Annals]]'' describes the beast seen by Sri Tri Buana as a powerful, fast-moving and fine-looking animal with a "red body, black head, and white breast", and size "slightly bigger than a goat."&lt;ref name="miksic 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J9JAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA43 |title=Malay Annals |page=43 |author=Dr John Leyden and Sir Thomas Stamford Rffles|date=1821 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested that it may have been a tiger or some other big cat that he saw and was misidentified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Studying in Singapore |publisher=Search Singapore Pte Ltd |url=http://www.schools.com.sg/articles/aboutSingapore.asp |accessdate=14 April 2006 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071223174218/http://www.schools.com.sg/articles/aboutSingapore.asp|archivedate=23 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idt1BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Nature Contained: Environmental Histories of Singapore |authors=Tony O'Dempsey, Mark Emmanuel, John van Wyhe, Nigel P.

Many scholars, however, thought that the person Sri Tri Buana and the story of the founding of Singapura to be fictional, and a number of alternative suggestions for the origin of the name of Singapore have been given. For example, it has been proposed that the name was adopted by [[Parameswara (king)|Parameswara]] to show that he was re-establishing in Singapore the lion throne that he had originally set up in [[Palembang]].  In this version of events, the lion throne was set up as a challenge to the Javanese [[Majapahit Empire]], and the Javanese then drove Parameswara out of Palembang as a consequence of this defiance. Parameswara fled to Temasek, whereupon he assassinated the local ruler and usurped the throne.&lt;ref name="turnbull"/&gt; The change of name from Temasek to Singapura may therefore serve to strengthen his claim over the island.&lt;ref name="historySG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/d24d6da6-0013-4a12-a6bc-68ad1497148e |title=Temasek/Singapora |work=HistorySG }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others linked the name to the Javanese kingdom [[Singhasari]] as well as a Majapahit Buddhist sect whose adherents were referred to as lions.&lt;ref name="turnbull"/&gt; Some proposed alternative readings of the name Singapura; for example, it has been suggested that the ''singa'' in the name may simply be the Malay word ''singgah'' meaning "stop over" indicating it was a stopover place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Portrait of Malaysia and Singapore |author=Tan Ding Eing |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1978|isbn=978-0195807226|page=43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Impressions of the Malay Peninsula in Ancient Times |first=Paul |last=Wheatley |page=103 |publisher=The Eastern Universities Press Singapore|date= 1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another, based on names found in some old maps, proposed that the name Singapura may have came from the strait as ''[bar]-čin-gapura'' (where "čin" is China and "gopara" is a "gate" in Sanskrit) meaning "gateway to the port of China".&lt;ref name="borschberg"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Borschberg|first= Peter|title=The Singapore Straits in the Latter Middle Ages and Early Modern Period (c.13th to 17th Centuries).

===Early records===
{{see also|Early history of Singapore|Temasek}}

The first possible written records of Singapore possibly date to the 2nd century, when the island was identified as a trading post in the maps of the Greek astronomer, [[Ptolemy]]. The map located a place called ''Sabara'' or ''Sabana'' in the southern tip of the [[Malay Peninsula]] (named the [[Golden Chersonese|Golden Khersonese]]) where Singapore lies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hack |first=Karl |url=http://www.hsse.nie.edu.sg/staff/kahack/cc%202.3%20(Little%20India).htm |title=Records of Ancient Links between India and Singapore |publisher=National Institute of Education, Singapore |accessdate=4 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426231828/http://www.hsse.nie.edu.sg/staff/kahack/cc%202.3%20%28Little%20India%29.htm |archivedate=26 April 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMt3BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Singapore and the Silk Road of the Sea, 1300_1800|author= John N.

A 3rd century Chinese written record describes the island of ''Puluozhong'' ({{zh|c=蒲羅中|p=Púluōzhōng}}), probably a transcription of the [[Malay language|Malay]] ''[[Pulau Ujong]]'', "island at the end" (of the [[Malay peninsula]]).&lt;ref name="

It was recorded that in 1320, the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] [[Yuan Dynasty]] sent a mission to obtain elephants from a place called ''[[Long Ya Men]]'' ({{zh|c=龍牙門|p=Lóngyámén|l=Dragon's Teeth Gate}}), known locally as ''Batu Berlayar'' in Malay, which is believed to be [[Keppel Harbour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Singapore: Relations with Malaysia | url = https://www.pbs.org/nbr/site/research/educators/060106_15a/ | publisher = Community Television Foundation of South Florida | date = 10 January 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222073109/http://www.pbs.org/nbr/site/research/educators/060106_15a/ |archivedate=22 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSqXGSinwP4C&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title =Singapore: The Unexpected Nation |author= Edwin Lee |pages=1&amp;ndash;2 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |date=15 October 2008|isbn= 978-9812307965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore is referred to in old Javanese and Malay literature as [[Temasek]].  The ''[[Nagarakretagama]]'', a [[Java (island)|Javanese]] epic poem written in 1365, names a settlement on the island as ''Tumasik''.  The name appears twice in the ''Malay Annals''. Temasek may have been derived from ''Tasik'', the Malay word for "lake" or "sea", perhaps meaning "Sea Town".&lt;ref name="toponym"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DTOJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA381#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Singapore Street Names: A Study of Toponymics|authors= Victor R Savage, Brenda Yeoh |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |date= 15 June 2013 |isbn=9789814484749 |page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese traveller [[Wang Dayuan]], visiting the island around 1330, mentioned ''Danmaxi''  ({{zh|c=單馬錫|p= Dānmǎxí}}, written as 淡馬錫 in the [[Mao Kun map]]), which is a transcription of the Malay name ''Temasek''. Wang described two settlements in ''Danmaxi'':  ''Long Ya Men'' and ''[[Ban Zu]]'' (班卒, {{lang-ms|pancur}}).  In a version of [[Marco Polo]]'s account of his travel, a place named ''Chiamassie'' that could be Temasik was mentioned in relation to the island kingdom of ''Malayur''.&lt;ref name="toponym"/&gt; Temasik may have also been mentioned in Vietnamese records as ''Sach Ma Tich'' in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMt3BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA181#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Singapore and the Silk Road of the Sea, 1300_1800|author= John N. Miksic |publisher=NUS Press |date=15 November 2013|isbn= 978-9971695743|pages=181–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chinese records continued to use the name Temasik for some time afterwards (for example in the [[Mao Kun map]]) even though its name had been changed to Singapura in the 14th century.  Although the name was mentioned in Malay literature, the name Temasek had become obsolete and did not appear in European maps and documents from 1500 to 1800.&lt;ref name="iberian"/&gt; In colonial and more modern times, this early name for Singapore was revived and is now used by modern institutions and for national honours in Singapore.

===Early European names===
[[File:Map of Singapura by Godinho de Erédia 1604.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left| 1604 map of Singapura by Portuguese cartographer [[Manuel Godinho de Erédia]]. Marked on the map are places such as Blacan mati ([[Sentosa]]), Xabandaria, [[Tanah Merah, Singapore|Tana Mera]], and Ujontana (the Malay Peninsula)]]
Early European visitors to the region gave Singapore a number of different names. Portuguese and Spanish sources may use the name ''Viontana'' for ''Ujong Tanah'', a name that may also be used to refer to Johor or the lower part of the Malay Peninsula.  Dutch maps of the 1600s and 1700s named the island as '''t Lange Eyland'' or ''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'t Lang Eiland'' ("The Long Island"), or the Malay equivalent ''Pulau Panjang'', as well as ''Iatana'' for ''Ujong Tanah''. A Flemish merchant named the island as ''Ysla de la Sabandaria Vieja'', or "Island of the Old Shahbandar's House" (the [[Shahbandar]] or Portmaster's house was marked on some early maps near the mouth of [[Singapore River]]).&lt;ref name="iberian"/&gt;  Xabandaria along with other place names of Singapore such as [[Tanah Merah, Singapore|Tanah Merah]] and Blakang Mati ([[Sentosa]]) appear in a map by a Malay-Portuguese cartographer [[Godinho de Erédia]] drawn in 1604 and published in 1613.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMt3BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Singapore and the Silk Road of the Sea, 1300–1800 |first= John N. |last= Miksic |publisher= NUS Press |date= 15 November 2013|isbn= 978-9971695743 |pages=163–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nlb.gov.sg/biblioasia/2016/01/22/a-portugese-map-of-singapura/#sthash.J5OGaMG3.wp9WnrUG.dpbs |title=A Portuguese Map of Sincapura |work= Biblioasia |publisher=National Library Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cantino planisphere (1502).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Cantino planisphere]] (1502) showing Singapore at the tip of the Malay Peninsula, written as ''bargimgaparaa''. The Portuguese had not yet arrived at the Malay Peninsula and its depiction is therefore inaccurate.]]
The name Singapura and its many variants were used from the 1500s onwards in Europeans sources. Early 16th century European maps such as [[Cantino planisphere]], showing the knowledge of Malay Peninsula before the actual arrival of the Portuguese in the region (its depiction is therefore relatively inaccurate compared to the rest of the map), give names such as ''bargimgaparaa'' or ''ba(r)xingapara'' and ''ba(r)cingapura'', where the ''bar'' in the name may be from either Arabic or Persian meaning "a large body of water" that may also be used to refer to a coastal kingdom.&lt;ref name="borschberg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historydelocalized.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/bargimgaparaa.html |title=Bargimgaparaa.

Up to the late 1700s, the name Singapura was more often used in relation to a strait rather than the island itself.&lt;ref name="iberian"/&gt; The Portuguese general [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] who conquered [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] in fact claimed that Singapura was named after the strait, and that it meant "''falsa demora'', perhaps meaning a "wrong, tricky or challenging interruption [of the voyage] or place to stay".&lt;ref name="borschberg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/3be6e35b-321c-4961-83a7-0ef0ffa44f24 |title=Singapura as "Falsa Demora" |work=Singapore SG |publisher=National Library Board Singapore }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WUhjKE8APSYC&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Commentaries of the Great Afonso Dalboquerque, Second Viceroy of India |author= Afonso de Albuquerque |page=73 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=20 May 2010|isbn= 978-1108011549 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Strait of Singapore]] in the early period may refer to the southern portion of the [[Strait of Malacca]] or other stretches of water,&lt;ref name="iberian"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ggyl2FSzXvgC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  |title=Iberians in the Singapore-Melaka Area and Adjacent Regions (16th to 18th Century)|editor= Peter Borschberg |publisher= Harrassowitz |date=December 2004|isbn= 978-3447051071|pages=98–99 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and maps of the 16th century may use ''Cingaporla'', ''Cincapula'', and many other variations to refer to island as well as the various straits or the southern portion of the Malay peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rb6cBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  |title=The Singapore and Melaka Straits: Violence, Security and Diplomacy in the 17th Century|author= Peter Borschberg |publisher= NUS Press |date=1 June 2009|isbn= 978-9971694647|pages=47–49 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th century German encyclopedia ''[[Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon]]'' provided five separate entries for Singapore: ''Sincapur'' (tip of the Malay Peninsula) and its  Latin equivalent ''Sincapurum Promontorium'', ''Sincapura'' (a city), ''Sincapor'' and ''Singapour'' (both straits).&lt;ref name="borschberg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PfhfAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1595&amp;lpg=PA1595#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Grosses vollständiges Universal Lexicon aller Wissenschaften und Künste, Volume 37 |page=1595}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the 1780s, the name ''Sinkapoor'' began to be commonly used on Dutch maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rb6cBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  |title=The Singapore and Melaka Straits: Violence, Security and Diplomacy in the 17th Century|author= Peter Borschberg |publisher= NUS Press |date=1 June 2009|isbn= 978-9971694647|page=50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In English sources, ''Sincapore'', ''Sincapure'', ''Singahpura'' and other variants of Singapore were used in the 17th to 19th century, and although a few variants such as ''Singapoor'' and ''Singapure'' continued to appear for some time, Singapore would become the standard form in English in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XBQACAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT45&amp;lpg=PT45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Travellers’ Tales of Old Singapore|author= Michael Wise |publisher=Marshall Cavendish International (Asia) Pte Ltd |date=15 December 2012 |isbn=9789814677301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4lhAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA51#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A New Geographical Dictionary|date=1738 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ggOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA265#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=History of the Indian Archipelago: Containing an account of the manners, arts, languages, religions, institutions, and commerce of its inhabitants |author =John Crawfurd|page=265 |date=1820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local Chinese names===
A number of names for Singapore were used by local [[Hokkien]]-speaking ethnic Chinese in early modern Singapore.  In addition to the now standard ''Sin-ka-pho'' ({{zh|c=新加坡|p=Xīnjiāpō}}), other names include ''Seng-ka-pho'' (星嘉坡 or 星加坡) and the derived short forms ''Seng-chiu'' (星洲; "Singapore Island") and ''Seng-kok'' (星國 "Singapore State").

Another name, ''Sit-la̍t'' (石叻) derived from the Malay word ''selat'' meaning "strait" (from ''Sit-la̍t-mn̂g'' [石叻門] another name for [[Longyamen]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://baike.baidu.com/view/611042.htm 石叻] at ''[[Baidu Baike]]. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the derivatives or variants ''Sit-la̍t-po·'' (石叻埠), '''Si̍t-la̍t-po·'' (實叻埠), and ''La̍t-po·'' (叻埠) were also used.&lt;ref&gt;The syllable ''La̍t'' (叻) was used as shorthand for Singapore in terms such as the Hokkien name for the [[Straits Settlements]], ''La̍t-sū-kah'' (叻嶼呷) where ''sū'' (嶼) refers to [[Penang]] (''Pin-nn̂g-sū'' 檳榔嶼) and ''kah'' (呷) to [[Malacca]] (''Mâ-la̍k-kah'' 麻六呷). ''Po·'' (埠) means a [[quay]], port, or city.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
The Japanese renamed Singapore {{nihongo|''Shōnantō''|昭南島}}, from Japanese {{nihongo|''"[[Shōwa period|Shōwa]] no jidai ni eta minami no shima"''|"昭和の時代に得た南の島"}}, or "southern island obtained in the age of Shōwa", and [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore|occupied it]] until the British repossessed the island on 12 September 1945, a month after [[Surrender of Japan|the Japanese surrender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ron Taylor |title=Fall of Malaya and Singapore |url=http://www.britain-at-war.org.uk/WW2/Malaya_and_Singapore/index.htm |accessdate=10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Shōnantō'' was, at the time, [[Romanization of Japanese|romanised]] as ''Syonan-to'' or ''Syonan'', where the characters 昭南 literally translate to "Light of the South".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mothership.sg/2017/02/on-the-road-to-syonan-to-how-singapore-got-swept-into-ww2/ |title=On the road to Syonan-to: How Singapore got swept into WW2|author=Joshua Lee |date= 11 February 2017 |work=Mothership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary names==
===Singaporean languages===

====Chinese====
In written [[Chinese character]]s, the country's official name, "Republic of Singapore" is rendered as 新加坡共和国 in [[simplified Chinese]] and 新加坡共和國 in [[traditional Chinese]].  The full name of Singapore in different [[varieties of Chinese]] is:

*Mandarin: ''Xīnjiāpō Gònghéguó''
*Hokkien: ''Sin-ka-pho Kiōng-hô-kok ''
*[[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]]: ''Sāngabō Gùngwòhgwok''
*[[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]]: ''Sîn-kâ-phô Khiung-fò-koet''
*[[Fuzhou dialect|Hokchiu]]: ''Sĭng-gă-pŏ̤ Gê̤ṳng-huò-guók''

A nickname for the city is ''Shīchéng'' ([[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]])/''Sai-siâⁿ'' ([[Hokkien]]) (狮城), literally "Lion City."  [[#Modern historical names|Modern historical names]] are retained as poetic or shorthand names for the island or country and include ''Xīngzhōu''/''Seng-chiu'' (星洲) and ''Xīngguó''/''Seng-kok'' (星國).  ''Xīng'', literally "star," is used as a [[homophone]] for the first syllable of "Singapore."  ''Zhōu'' is a term for "island" while ''guó'' means "country" or "state." ''Xīngzhōu'' is used in names such as the ''[[Sin Chew Jit Poh (Singapore)|Sin Chew Jit Poh]]'' (星洲日报), a newspaper in Singapore until the 1980s.

====Malay====
The official name of the country in [[Malay language|Malay]] is ''Republik Singapura'' and the Malay name is used for the country's [[motto]] and its [[national anthem]] of the same name, ''"[[Majulah Singapura]]''".

====Tamil====
In [[Tamil language|Tamil]], the country's name is ''Ciṅkappūr'' (சிங்கப்பூர்) and its official name is ''Ciṅkappūr Kuṭiyaracu'' (சிங்கப்பூர் குடியரசு, /{{IPA|siŋɡəppuːr kuɽijərəsɯ}}/).

===Other languages===
Nearly every language currently uses a name for Singapore derived from "Singapore" or "Singapura."

====Khmer====
In the [[Khmer language]], the country's name is ''Sernghakborey'' (សិង្ហបុរី) from the word សិង្ហ meaning "lion" and បុរី meaning "city".  The official name of the country is ស឵ធ឵រណៈរដ្ឋសិង្ហបុរី, literally "Republic of Singapore".  The French word "Singapour" is commonly spoken.

====Vietnamese====
[[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] either uses the word ''Singapore'' or ''Xin Ga Po'' for the country (and ''Cộng hòa Singapore'' or ''Cộng hòa Xin Ga Po'' for "Republic of Singapore") but has traditionally used versions taken from the ''[[hán tự]]'' 新加坡, namely ''Tân Gia Pha'' or ''Tân Gia Ba'' (and ''Tân Gia Ba Cộng hòa quốc'' for "Republic of Singapore" [新加坡共和國]).  It has also used such ''hán tự''-derived names other for historical names including ''Chiêu Nam'' for ''[[#World War II|Shōnan]]'' (昭南) and ''Hạ Châu''.

====Korean====
Likewise, Korea formerly used a [[Hanja]]-derived name for Singapore, ''Singapa'' (신가파), but now uses ''Singgaporeu'' (싱가포르).

'''Normalized Difference Water Index''' (NDWI) may refer to one of at least two [[remote sensing]]-derived indexes related to liquid water:

One is used to monitor changes in water content of leaves, using [[near-infrared]] (NIR) and [[short-wave infrared]] (SWIR) [[wavelengths]], proposed by Gao in 1996:&lt;ref&gt;Gao. "NDWI—A normalized difference water index for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space." 1996. http://ceeserver.cee.cornell.edu/wdp2/cee6150/Readings/Gao_1996_RSE_58_257-266_NDWI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{NDWI}=\frac{(Xnir - Xswir)}{(Xnir + Xswir)}&lt;/math&gt;

Another is used to monitor changes related to water content in water bodies, using green and NIR wavelengths, defined by McFeeters (1996):
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{NDWI}=\frac{(Xgreen - Xnir)}{(Xgreen + Xnir)}&lt;/math&gt;

==Overview==
In remote sensing, ''ratio image'' or ''spectral rationing'' are enhancement techniques in which a raster pixel from one spectral band is divided by the corresponding value in another band.&lt;ref&gt;Lillisand &amp; Kifer&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the indexes above share this same functional form; the choice of bands used is what makes them appropriate for a specific purpose.

If looking to monitor vegetation in drought affected areas, then it is advisable to use NIR and SWIR.  The SWIR reflectance reflects changes in both the vegetation water content and the spongy [[mesophyll]] structure in vegetation canopies. The NIR reflectance is affected by leaf internal structure and leaf dry matter content, but not by water content. The combination of the NIR with the SWIR removes variations induced by leaf internal structure and leaf dry matter content, improving the accuracy in retrieving the vegetation water content.&lt;ref&gt;Ceccato et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

If looking for water level or change in water level (e.g. flooding), then it is advisable to use the green and NIR spectral bands.

==Interpretation==
Visual or digital interpretation of the output image/raster created is similar to [[NDVI]]:

* -1 to 0 - Bright surface with no vegetation or water content
* +1      - represent water content

'''Nubia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|uː|b|i|ə|,_|ˈ|n|j|uː|-}}) was a region along the [[Nile]] river encompassing the area between [[Aswan]] in southern [[Egypt]] and [[Khartoum]] in central [[Sudan]]. It was the seat of one of the earliest [[civilizations]] of [[ancient]] [[Africa]], with a history that can be traced from at least 2500 BC onward with the [[Kerma culture]]. The latter was conquered by the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] under [[pharaoh]] [[Thutmose I]] around 1500 BC. Nubia was home to several [[African empires|empires]], most prominently the [[kingdom of Kush]], which conquered Egypt during the 8th century BC during the reign of [[Piye]] and ruled the country as its [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth Dynasty]] (to be replaced a century later by the native Egyptian [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-sixth Dynasty]]). 

The collapse of Kush in the 4th century AD after more than a thousand years of existence was precipitated by an invasion by [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Kingdom of Aksum]] and saw the rise of three Christian kingdoms, [[Nobatia]], [[Makuria]] and [[Alodia]], the last two again lasting for roughly a millennium. Their eventual decline initiated not only the partition of Nubia into the northern half conquered by the [[Ottomans]] and the southern half by the [[Sennar (sultanate)|Sennar sultanate]] in the 16th century, but also a rapid [[Islamization]] and partial [[Arabization]] of the [[Nubian people]]. Nubia was again united under the [[Khedivate of Egypt]] in the 19th century. Today, the region of Nubia is split between Egypt and Sudan.

The primarily [[Archaeology|archaeological]] science dealing with ancient Nubia is called [[Nubiology]].

==Linguistics==
{{Main article|Nubian languages}}
The name ''Nubia'' is derived from that of the [[Noba]] people, nomads who settled the area in the 4th century CE following the collapse of the kingdom of [[Meroë]]. The Noba spoke a [[Nilo-Saharan]] language, ancestral to [[Old Nubian language|Old Nubian]]. Old Nubian was mostly used in religious texts dating from the 8th and 15th centuries. Before the 4th century, and throughout [[classical antiquity]], Nubia was known as ''[[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]'', or, in [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] usage, included under the name ''[[Ancient Ethiopia|Ethiopia]]'' (''[[Aithiopia]]'').

Historically, the [[Nubian people|people of Nubia]] spoke at least two varieties of the [[Nubian language]] group, a subfamily that includes [[Nobiin]] (the descendant of Old Nubian), [[Kenuzi-Dongola]], [[Midob people|Midob]] and several related varieties in the northern part of the [[Nuba Mountains]] in South [[Kordofan]]. Until at least 1970, the [[Birgid language]] was spoken north of [[Nyala, Sudan|Nyala]] in [[Darfur]], but is now extinct. However, linguistic evidence indicates that the languages spoken in the ancient [[Kerma Culture]] (present-day southern [[Egypt]] and northern [[Sudan]]) in Nubia, belonged to the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic]] languages.&lt;ref name="Bechaus-Gerst"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Marianne |last1=Bechaus-Gerst |first2=Roger |last2=Blench |editor= Kevin MacDonald |title=The Origins and Development of African Livestock: Archaeology, Genetics, Linguistics and Ethnography - "Linguistic evidence for the prehistory of livestock in Sudan" (2000) |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1135434166 |page=453 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=-t5QAwAAQBAJ |accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lbant"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Behrens |first1=Peter |title=Libya Antiqua: Report and Papers of the Symposium Organized by Unesco in Paris, 16 to 18 January 1984 - "Language and migrations of the early Saharan cattle herders: the formation of the Berber branch" |date=1986 |publisher=Unesco |isbn=9231023764 |page=30 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=p_hwAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{See also|Aethiopia|Archaeological expeditions to Nubia|Nile boat}}

Nubia was divided into three major regions: Upper, Middle and Lower Nubia, in reference to their locations along the [[Nile]]. Lower refers to regions downstream and upper refers to regions upstream. [[Lower Nubia]] lay between the First and the Second [[cataracts of the Nile|Cataracts]], within the current borders of Egypt. Middle Nubia lay between the Second and the Third Cataracts. Upper Nubia lay south of the Third Cataract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Edwards |first1=David |title=The Nubian Past |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=Oxon |isbn=9780415369886 |pages=2,90,106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== Prehistory ===
[[File:Tools, Weapons and adornments from el-Barga (6000-5500 BC).jpg|thumb|Tools, Weapons and adornments from el-Barga (6000–5500 BC)]]
Early settlements sprouted in both Upper and Lower Nubia. Egyptians referred to Nubia as "Ta-Seti," or "The Land of the Bow," since the Nubians were known to be expert archers.&lt;ref name="Emberling 2011 8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emberling|first=Geoff|title=Nubia: Ancient Kingdoms of Africa|year=2011|publisher=Institute for the study of the ancient world|location=New York|isbn=978-0-615-48102-9|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars typically refer to the people from this area as the "[[Nubian A-Group|A-Group]]" culture. Fertile farmland just south of the Third Cataract is known as the "[[pre-Kerma]]" culture in Upper Nubia, as they are the ancestors.

The [[Neolithic]] people in the Nile Valley likely came from [[Sudan]], as well as the [[Sahara]], and there was shared culture with the two areas and with that of Egypt during this period.&lt;ref name="Keita 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Studies of Ancient Crania From Northern Africa}} – S.O.Y. Keita, ''[[American Journal of Physical Anthropology]]'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; By the 5th millennium BC, the people who inhabited what is now called Nubia participated in the [[Neolithic revolution]]. Saharan [[Sabu-Jaddi|rock reliefs]] depict scenes that have been thought to be suggestive of a [[cattle cult]], typical of those seen throughout parts of Eastern Africa and the Nile Valley even to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/faculty/stsmith/research/nubia_history.html|title=Dr. Stuart Tyson Smith|work=ucsb.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Megaliths discovered at [[Nabta Playa]] are early examples of what seems to be one of the world's first [[Astronomy|astronomical]] devices, predating [[Stonehenge]] by almost 2,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetquest.org/learn/nabta.html PlanetQuest: The History of Astronomy] – Retrieved on 2007-08-29&lt;/ref&gt; This complexity as observed at Nabta Playa, and as expressed by different levels of authority within the society there, likely formed the basis for the structure of both the Neolithic society at Nabta and the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110806140123/http://www.comp-archaeology.org/WendorfSAA98.html Late Neolithic megalithic structures at Nabta Playa] – by Fred Wendorf (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Around 3500 BC, the second "Nubian" culture, termed the A-Group, arose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Shaw|editor1-first=Ian|editor2-last=Jameson|editor2-first=Robert|title=A Dictionary of Archaeology|date=2002|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-631-23583-5|page=433}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a contemporary of, and ethnically and culturally very similar to, the polities in predynastic [[Naqada]] of Upper Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/interactive/hierakonpolis/nubian.html Hunting for the Elusive Nubian A-Group People] – by Maria Gatto, archaeology.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keita further"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Further Studies of Crania From Ancient Northern Africa: An Analysis of Crania From First Dynasty Egyptian Tombs, using Multiple Discriminant Functions}} – American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 87: 245–254 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; The A-Group people were engaged in trade with the Egyptians. This trade is testified archaeologically by large amounts of Egyptian commodities deposited in the graves of the A-Group people. The imports consisted of gold objects, copper tools, faience amulets and beads, seals, slate palettes, stone vessels, and a variety of pots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2386738/Hierarchy_and_heterarchy_-_the_earliest_cross-cultural_trade_along_the_Nile|title=Hierarchy and heterarchy – the earliest cross-cultural trade along the Nile|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 3300 BC, there is evidence of a unified kingdom, as shown by the finds at [[Qustul]], that maintained substantial interactions (both cultural and genetic) with the culture of Naqadan Upper Egypt. The Nubian culture may have even contributed to the unification of the Nile Valley.

[[Toby Wilkinson]], based on work by Bruce Williams in the 1980s, wrote that "The white crown, associated in historic times with Upper Egypt, is first attested later than the red crown, but is directly associated with the ruler somewhat earlier. The earliest known depiction of the white crown is on a ceremonial incense burner from Cemetery at Qustul in Lower Nubia".&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 1999 8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emberling|first=Geoff|title=Early Dynastic Egypt|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-18633-1|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a 1998 excavation report, Jane Roy has written that "At the time of Williams' argument, the Qustul cemetery and the 'royal' iconography found there was dated to the Naqada IIIA period, thus antedating royal cemeteries in Egypt of the Naqada IIIB phase. New evidence from Abydos, however, particularly the excavation of Cemetery U and the tome U-j, dating to Naqada IIIA has shown that this iconography appears earlier in Egypt."&lt;ref name=Roy&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roy|first1=Jane|title=The Politics of Trade:Egypt and Lower Nubia in the 4th Millennium BC|date=February 2011|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004196117|page=215|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9En6tzUJCXkC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;lpg=PA215&amp;dq=white+crown+incense+burner+from+Cemetery+at+Qustul&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KwMLLUQEkH&amp;sig=zfnyeei7Zv9AMpHc4WP1P4wjvRg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCGoVChMIvZn7sb-UxgIVoRbbCh1CnADk#v=onepage&amp;q=white%20crown%20incense%20burner%20from%20Cemetery%20at%20Qustul&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nubian A group.jpg|thumb|left|Pottery of the Nubian A-Group, [[Musee du Louvre]]]]
Around the turn of the [[Naqada III|protodynastic period]], Naqada, in its bid to conquer and unify the whole Nile Valley, seems to have conquered Ta-Seti (the kingdom where Qustul was located) and harmonized it with the Egyptian state. Thus, Nubia became the first nome of Upper Egypt. At the time of the first dynasty, the A-Group area seems to have been entirely depopulated,&lt;ref name="Emberling 2011 8" /&gt; most likely due to immigration to areas west and south.

This culture began to decline in the early 28th century BC. [[George Andrew Reisner|George Reisner]] suggested that it was succeeded by a culture that he called the "B-Group", but most archaeologists today believe that this culture never existed and that the area was depopulated from c. 3000 BC to c. 2500, when a-group descendants returned to the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Shaw|editor1-first=Ian|editor2-last=Jameson|editor2-first=Robert|title=A Dictionary of Archaeology|date=2002|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-631-23583-5|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Török|first1=László|title=Between Two Worlds:The Frontier Region between Ancient Nubia and Egypt 3700 BC – 500AD|date=2008|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004171978 |pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes of this are uncertain, but it was perhaps caused by Egyptian invasions and pillaging that began at this time. Nubia is believed to have served as a trade corridor between Egypt and tropical Africa long before 3100 BC. Egyptian craftsmen of the period used [[ivory]] and [[ebony]] wood from tropical Africa which came through Nubia.

In 2300 BC, Nubia was first mentioned in Old Kingdom Egyptian accounts of trade missions. From [[Aswan]], right above the First Cataract, the southern limit of Egyptian control at the time, [[Egyptians]] imported gold, incense, ebony, copper, ivory, and exotic animals from tropical Africa through Nubia. As trade between Egypt and Nubia increased, so did wealth and stability. By the Egyptian 6th dynasty, Nubia was divided into a series of small kingdoms. There is debate over whether these [[Nubian C-Group|C-Group]] peoples,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2394005/The_C-Group_people_in_Lower_Nubia_2500_-_1500_BC._Cattle_pastoralists_in_a_multicultural_setting|title=The C-Group people in Lower Nubia, 2500 – 1500 BC. Cattle pastoralists in a multicultural setting|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; who flourished from c. 2500 BC to c. 1500 BC, were another internal evolution or invaders. There are definite similarities between the pottery of the A-Group and C-Group, so it may be a return of the ousted Group-As, or an internal revival of lost arts. At this time, the Sahara Desert was becoming too arid to support human beings, and it is possible that there was a sudden influx of Saharan nomads. C-Group pottery is characterized by all-over incised geometric lines with white infill and impressed imitations of basketry.

During the Egyptian [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2040–1640 BC), Egypt began expanding into Nubia to gain more control over the trade routes in Northern Nubia and direct access to trade with Southern Nubia. They erected a chain of forts down the Nile below the Second Cataract. These garrisons seemed to have peaceful relations with the local Nubian people, but little interaction during the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2393840/Between_Kush_and_Egypt_The_C-Group_people_of_Lower_Nubia_during_the_Middle_Kingdom_and_Second_Intermediate_Period|title=Between Kush and Egypt: The C-Group people of Lower Nubia during the Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Period|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporaneous but distinct culture from the C-Group was the Pan Grave culture, so called because of their shallow graves. The Pan Graves are associated with the East bank of the Nile, but the Pan Graves and C-Group definitely interacted. Their pottery is characterized by incised lines of a more limited character than those of the C-Group, generally having interspersed undecorated spaces within the geometric schemes.

One interpretation is that Nubian A-Group rulers and early Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s used related royal symbols. Similarities in rock art of A-Group Nubia and Upper Egypt support this position. Ancient Egypt conquered Nubian territory in various eras, and incorporated parts of the area into its provinces. The Nubians in turn were to conquer Egypt under its [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|25th Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Watterson, ''The Egyptians''. Blackwell, Oxford. pp. 50&amp;ndash;117&lt;/ref&gt;

However, relations between the two peoples also show peaceful cultural interchange and cooperation, including mixed marriages. The [[Medjay]] (''mj3'',&lt;ref&gt;Erman &amp; Grapow, ''Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache'', 2, 186.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;) represents the name [[ancient Egypt]] gave to a region in northern Sudan where an ancient people of Nubia inhabited. They became part of the Egyptian military as scouts and minor workers.

During the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]], "Medjay" no longer referred to the district of Medja but to a tribe or clan of people. It is not known what happened to the district, but, after the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]], it and other districts in Nubia were no longer mentioned in the written record.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, ''op.cit.'', p. 76*&lt;/ref&gt; Written accounts detail the Medjay as nomadic desert people. Over time, they were incorporated into the Egyptian army. In the army, the Medjay served as garrison troops in Egyptian fortifications in Nubia and patrolled the deserts as a kind of gendarmerie.&lt;ref&gt;Bard, ''op.cit.'', p.486&lt;/ref&gt; This was done in the hope of preventing their fellow Medjay tribespeople from further attacking Egyptian assets in the region.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"&gt;Wilkinson, ''op.cit.'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Later, they were even used during [[Kamose]]'s campaign against the [[Hyksos]]&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, ''op.cit.'', p.201&lt;/ref&gt; and became instrumental in making the Egyptian state into a military power.&lt;ref&gt;Steindorff &amp; Seele, ''op.cit.'', p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom period]], the Medjay were an elite paramilitary police force.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; No longer did the term refer to an ethnic group and, over time, the new meaning became synonymous with the policing occupation in general. Being an elite police force, the Medjay were often used to protect valuable areas, especially royal and religious complexes. Though they are most notable for their protection of the royal palaces and tombs in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and the surrounding areas, the Medjay were known to have been used throughout Upper and Lower Egypt.

Various pharaohs of Nubian origin are held by some Egyptologists to have played an important part towards the area in different eras of Egyptian history, particularly the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|12th Dynasty]]. These rulers handled matters in typical Egyptian fashion, reflecting the close cultural influences between the two regions.

{{quote|[T]he XIIth Dynasty (1991–1786 B.C.E.) originated from the [[Aswan]] region. As expected, strong Nubian features and dark coloring are seen in their sculpture and relief work. This dynasty ranks as among the greatest, whose fame far outlived its actual tenure on the throne. Especially interesting, it was a member of this dynasty that decreed that no Nehsy (riverine Nubian of the principality of Kush), except such as came for trade or diplomatic reasons, should pass by the Egyptian fortress and cops at the southern end of the [[cataracts of the Nile|Second Nile Cataract]]. Why would this royal family of Nubian ancestry ban other Nubians from coming into Egyptian territory? Because the Egyptian rulers of Nubian ancestry had become Egyptians culturally; as pharaohs, they exhibited typical Egyptian attitudes and adopted typical Egyptian policies. (Yurco 1989) &lt;ref&gt;F. J. Yurco, "The ancient Egyptians..", ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' (Vol 15, no. 5, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the New Kingdom, Nubians became indistinguishable in the archaeological record from Egyptians.

{{quote|It is an extremely difficult task to attempt to describe the Nubians during the course of Egypt's New Kingdom, because their presence appears to have virtually evaporated from the archaeological record. The result has been described as a wholesale Nubian assimilation into Egyptian society. This assimilation was so complete that it masked all Nubian ethnic identities insofar as archaeological remains are concerned beneath the impenetrable veneer of Egypt's material culture. In the Kushite Period, when Nubians ruled as Pharaohs in their own right, the material culture of Dynasty XXV (about 750–655 B.C.E.) was decidedly Egyptian in character. Nubia's entire landscape up to the region of the Third Cataract was dotted with temples indistinguishable in style and decoration from contemporary temples erected in Egypt. The same observation obtains for the smaller number of typically Egyptian tombs in which these elite Nubian princes were interred.&lt;ref&gt;Bianchi, 2004, ''Daily Life of the Nubians''. p. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Kerma===
{{Main|Kerma Culture}}

[[File:Kerma city.JPG|thumb|left|Kerma city]]
From the pre-Kerma culture, the first kingdom to unify much of the region arose. The [[Kerma Culture]], named for its presumed capital at [[Kerma]], was one of the earliest urban centers in the Nile region and spoke languages of the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch.&lt;ref name="Bechaus-Gerst"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lbant"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/2380609/The_Kingdom_of_Kush_An_African_Centre_on_the_Periphery_of_the_Bronze_Age_World_System |title=The Kingdom of Kush: An African Centre on the Periphery of the Bronze Age World System |website=www.academia.edu |accessdate=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1750 BC, the kings of Kerma were powerful enough to organize the labor for monumental walls and structures of mud brick. They also had rich tombs, with possessions for the afterlife and large [[human sacrifice]]s. [[George Andrew Reisner]] excavated sites at Kerma and found distinctive [[Nubian architecture]] such as large tombs and palace-like structures. At one point, Kerma came very close to conquering Egypt. Egypt suffered a serious defeat at the hands of the [[Kingdom of Kush]].&lt;ref&gt;Tomb Reveals Ancient Egypt's Humiliating Secret ''The Times'' (London, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elkab's hidden treasure|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/649/he1.htm|publisher=[[Al-Ahram]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215024748/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/649/he1.htm|archivedate=2009-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Davies, head of the joint [[British Museum]] and Egyptian archaeological team, the attack was so devastating that, if the Kerma forces had chosen to stay and occupy Egypt, they might have eliminated it for good and brought the nation to extinction. When Egyptian power revived under the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] (c. 1532–1070 BC), Egyptians began to expand further southwards. The Egyptians destroyed Kerma's kingdom and capitol and expanded the Egyptian empire to the Fourth Cataract.

By the end of the reign of [[Thutmose I]] (1520 BC), all of northern Nubia had been annexed. The Egyptians built a new administrative center at [[Napata]], and used the area to produce [[gold]] and incense.&lt;ref&gt;James G. Cusick (5 March 2015).

===Kush===
{{Main|Kingdom of Kush}}

====Napatan period====

[[File:Senkamenisken-Shabti BrooklynMuseum.png|thumb|upright=0.5|Figurine of the King [[Senkamanisken]], Napata period ca. 643-623 BC]]
When the Egyptians pulled out of the Napata region, they left a lasting legacy that was merged with indigenous customs, forming the kingdom of [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]. Archaeologists have found several burials in the area that seem to belong to local leaders. The Kushites were buried there soon after the Egyptians decolonized the Nubian frontier. Kush adopted many Egyptian practices, such as their religion. The Kingdom of Kush survived longer than that of Egypt, invaded Egypt (under the leadership of king [[Piye]]), and controlled Egypt during the 8th century BC as the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientsudan.org/history_06_nubconegypt.htm|title=Ancient Sudan~ Nubia: History: The Kushite Conquest of Egypt|work=ancientsudan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kushites held sway over their northern neighbors for nearly 100 years, until they were eventually repelled by the invading [[Assyria]]ns. The Assyrians forced them to move farther south, where they eventually established their capital at [[Meroë]]. Of the Nubian kings of this era, [[Taharqa]] is perhaps the best known. A son and the third successor of the founding pharaoh, [[Piye]], he was crowned in [[Memphis, Egypt]] {{circa|690}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diop|first=Cheikh Anta|title=The African Origin of Civilization|year=1974|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=1-55652-072-7|pages=219–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taharqa ruled over both Nubia and Egypt, restored Egyptian temples at [[Karnak]], and built new temples and [[Pyramids of Nubia|pyramids in Nubia]] before being driven from Egypt by the Assyrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonnet|first=Charles|title=The Nubian Pharaohs|year=2006|publisher=The American University in Cairo Press|location=New York|isbn=978-977-416-010-3|pages=142–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mokhtar|first=G.|title=General History of Africa|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=California, USA|isbn=0-520-06697-9|pages=161–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Emberling|first=Geoff|title=Nubia: Ancient Kingdoms of Africa|year=2011|publisher=Institute for the Study of the Ancient World|location=New York|isbn=978-0-615-48102-9|pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverman|first=David|title=Ancient Egypt|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-521270-3|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meroitic period====
{{Main|Meroë}}

[[File:Sudan Meroe Pyramids 2001.JPG|thumb|Aerial view at [[Nubian pyramids]], [[Meroe]]]]
[[Meroë]] (800 BC – {{circa|AD 350}}) in southern Nubia lay on the east bank of the Nile, about 6&amp;nbsp;km north-east of the Kabushiya station near Shendi, Sudan, ca. 200&amp;nbsp;km north-east of [[Khartoum]]. The people there preserved many ancient Egyptian customs, but were unique in many respects. They developed their own form of writing, first utilizing Egyptian [[hieroglyphs]], and later using an alphabetic script with 23 signs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/nubia/mwriting.html Meroë: writing] – digitalegypt&lt;/ref&gt; Since king [[Arakamani]] the kings were buried in Meroe.

===Achaemenid period===
[[File:Xerxes detail Ethiopian.jpg|thumb|''Kušiya'' soldier of the [[Achaemenid army]], circa 480 BCE. [[Xerxes I]] tomb relief.]]
The Achaemenids occupied the Kushan kingdom, possibly from the time of [[Cambyses II|Cambyses]] (circa 530 BCE), and more probably from the time of [[Darius I]] (550-486 BCE), who mentions the conquest on Kush (''Kušiya'') in his inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dandamaev |first1=M. A. |title=A Political History of the Achaemenid Empire |date=1989 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9004091726 |pages=80-81 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ms30qA6nyMsC&amp;pg=PA80 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Curtis |first1=John |last2=Simpson |first2=St John |title=The World of Achaemenid Persia: History, Art and Society in Iran and the Ancient Near East |date=2010 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=9780857718013 |page=222 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoQAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA222 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Strabo]] describes a clash with the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in which the Romans defeated Nubians. According to Strabo, following the Kushite advance, [[Gaius Petronius]] (a Prefect of Egypt at the time) prepared a large army and marched south. The Roman forces clashed with the Kushite armies near Thebes and forced them to retreat to Pselchis (Maharraqa) in Kushite lands. Petronius then sent deputies to the Kushites in an attempt to reach a peace agreement and make certain demands.

Quoting Strabo, the Kushites "desired three days for consideration" in order to make a final decision. However, after the three days, Kush did not respond and Petronius advanced with his armies and took the Kushite city of Premnis (modern Karanog) south of Maharraqa. From there, he advanced all the way south to Napata, the second Capital in Kush after Meroe. Petronius attacked and sacked Napata, causing the son of the Kushite Queen to flee. Strabo describes the defeat of the Kushites at Napata, stating that "He (Petronius) made prisoners of the inhabitants".&lt;ref&gt;Nubian Queens in the Nile Valley and Afro-Asiatic Cultural History &amp;ndash; Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban, Professor of Anthropology, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston U.S.A, August 20&amp;ndash;26, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the different parts of the region divided into smaller groups with individual leaders, or generals, each commanding small armies of mercenaries. They fought for control of what is now Nubia and its surrounding territories, leaving the entire region weak and vulnerable to attack. Meroë would eventually meet defeat by the new rising [[Kingdom of Aksum]] to their south under [[Ezana of Axum|King Ezana]].

The classification of the [[Meroitic language]] is uncertain; it was long assumed to have been one of the [[Afroasiatic languages]] like the [[Egyptian language]], but is now considered to have likely been one of the [[Eastern Sudanic languages]].

At some point during the 4th century, the region was conquered by the [[Noba]], from which the name ''Nubia'' may derive; another possibility is that it comes from the Egyptian word for [[gold (hieroglyph)|gold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11147a.htm|title=Nubia|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, the Romans referred to the area as [[Nobatia]].

===Christian Nubia===
{{Main|Makuria|Nobadia|Alodia}}
[[File:Cross, Faras.jpg|thumb|upright|A church mural depicting an elaborate cross, [[Faras]] (12th century)]]
&lt;!--[[File:A post-Meroitic era Nubian royal crown from Ballana Tomb 118 by John Campana.jpg|thumb|The crown of a local [[Nubian kings|Nubian king]] who ruled between the collapse of the [[Meroitic period|Meroitic dynasty]] in 350 or 400 AD and the founding of the Christian kingdom of Nubia in 600 AD. It was found in Tomb 118 at [[Ballana]] in Lower Nubia by the British Egyptologist [[Walter Bryan Emery|W.B. Emery]]]]--&gt;

Around AD 350, the area was invaded by the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] and the Meroitic kingdom collapsed. Eventually, three smaller [[Christianity|Christian]] kingdoms replaced it: northernmost was [[Nobatia]] between the first and second cataract of the [[Nile River]], with its capital at Pachoras (modern-day [[Faras, Egypt|Faras]]); in the middle was [[Makuria]], with its capital at [[Old Dongola]]; and southernmost was [[Alodia]], with its capital at Soba (near [[Khartoum]]). King Silky of Nobatia crushed the [[Blemmyes]], and recorded his victory in a [[Greek language|Greek]] inscription carved in the wall of the temple of Talmis (modern [[Kalabsha]]) around AD 500.

While bishop [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]] of [[Alexandria]] consecrated one Marcus as bishop of [[Philae]] before his death in 373, showing that [[Christianity]] had penetrated the region by the 4th century, [[John of Ephesus]] records that a [[Monophysite]] priest named Julian converted the king and his nobles of Nobatia around 545. John of Ephesus also writes that the kingdom of Alodia was converted around 569. However, [[John of Biclarum]] records that the kingdom of Makuria was converted to [[Catholicism]] the same year, suggesting that John of Ephesus might be mistaken. Further doubt is cast on John's testimony by an entry in the chronicle of the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria]] [[Eutychius of Alexandria|Eutychius]], which states that in 719 the church of Nubia transferred its allegiance from the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek]] to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]].

By the 7th century, Makuria expanded becoming the dominant power in the region. It was strong enough to halt the southern expansion of [[Islam]] after the [[Arabs]] had taken Egypt. After several failed invasions the new rulers agreed to a treaty with Dongola, called [[Baqt]], allowing for peaceful coexistence and trade. This treaty held for six hundred years. Over time the influx of Arab traders introduced Islam to Nubia and it gradually supplanted [[Christianity]]. While there are records of a bishop at [[Qasr Ibrim]] in 1372, his see had come to include that located at Faras. It is also clear that the cathedral of Dongola had been converted to a mosque in 1317.&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, ''Arabs'', 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influx of [[Arabs]] and Nubians to Egypt and Sudan had contributed to the suppression of the Nubian identity following the collapse of the last Nubian kingdom around 1504. A vast majority of the Nubian population is currently Muslim, and the Arabic language is their main medium of communication in addition to their indigenous old Nubian language. The unique characteristic of Nubian is shown in their culture (dress, dances, traditions, and music).

===Islamic Nubia===
{{main|Islamization of Sudan}}
[[File:Gallery_of_Nubians_(early_19th_centuy).jpg|thumb|Nubians from the early 19th century]]
In the 14th century, the Dongolan government collapsed and the region became divided and dominated by Arabs. The next centuries would see several Arab invasions of the region, as well as the establishment of a number of smaller kingdoms. Northern Nubia was brought under Egyptian control, while the south came under the control of the [[Kingdom of Sennar]] in the 16th century. The entire region would come under Egyptian control during the rule of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] in the early 19th century, and later became a joint Anglo-Egyptian [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]. {{further|Egyptian invasion of Sudan 1820-24#Invasion of Nubia}}

==Contemporary issues==
{{Further|Nubian people}}
With the end of colonialism and the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|establishment]] of the [[Republic of Egypt]] (1953), and the secession of the [[Republic of Sudan]] from [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|unity with Egypt]] (1956), Nubia was divided between Egypt and Sudan.

During the early-1970s, many Egyptian and Sudanese Nubians were forcibly resettled to make room for [[Lake Nasser]] after the construction of the [[Aswan Dam|dams]] at [[Aswan]]. Nubian villages can now be found north of Aswan on the west bank of the Nile and on [[Elephantine Island]]; and many Nubians now live in large cities, such as [[Cairo]].

== Religion ==
Christianity is the dominant religion in Omuma. Catholics and Anglicans have the largest followers, and Pentecostal churches are not left out.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orudiocese.org/index.php/2014-03-18-14-26-04/history|title=History|first=|last=Admin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
The culture of Omuma is oriented on [[Omenala]] and is typical of the [[Igbo culture]], being steeped in [[Igbo art]] and [[Igbo music]]. While several cultural activities and festivals of old, having been associated with ancient Tribal gods and rites, have ceased to be performed since the spread of Christianity.

== Festival ==
The new yam festival starts with the planting season and is a more serious occasion, the planting season starts in March and the chief priest and elders start the planting of the yams. Before the first yam is planted elders pay homage to their traditional ruler or chief the Dede Igbo who is the custodian of the tradition and the ancestral father of the Omuma [[Igbo people]].

Very top members of the Igbo people like high chiefs, title holders, respected elders and important personalities in the community in an entourage make the journey to the Dede. When the elders and top title holders arrive at the Ezeonomobi Igbo they are usually received by the leader as culture demands, by presenting them locally brewed palm wine and kolanut and white clay which is first offered to the gods as supplication before the visitors.

Brief discussions and prayers are done, the usual calendar puts the planting season on January while the Igbo calendar which is agrarian is called the first Eke and starts in the month of February and is known as Onwa Mmiri Nda Afo.

In Igboland yam is an important economic crop which is highly favored and a regular staple in most homes, the crop is very significant and has important status being the chief crop and forerunner of other crops in the region. The planting season flags of on the first week of February and the crop usually takes six months to mature making the festival period between late July and early August when the valuable crop is harvested.

'''[[Solomon Islands]]''' is a sovereign [[Melanesia]]n island nation located in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] south-east of [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web | date=13 July 2009 | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bp.html | title=Solomon Islands | work=[[The World Factbook]] | publisher=United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] | accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is composed of nearly one thousand islands of the [[Solomon Islands (archipelago)|Solomon Islands archipelago]], which cover a total land area of {{convert|27540|km2|mi2}}. The capital is [[Honiara]], located on the island of [[Guadalcanal]].

The Solomon Islands archipelago is believed to have been inhabited by [[Melanesia]]n people for thousands of years. Some of the most bitter fighting of [[World War II]] occurred in the [[Solomon Islands campaign]] of 1942–45, including the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]]. Self-government was achieved in 1976 and independence two years later. The country is a [[Commonwealth realm]].

The historical [[North Solomon Islands]] covered  [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville Island]], [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]], [[Isabel Province|Santa Isabel]], the [[Shortland Islands|Shortlands]] and [[Ontong Java Atoll|Ontong Java]] and were largely under German control until 1900.  The southern Solomon Islands, which included  [[Guadalcanal]], [[Nggela Islands|the Nggelas]], [[Gizo, Solomon Islands|Gizo]], [[Kolombangara]], [[Marovo Island]], [[Mborokua]], [[New Georgia]], [[Vella Lavella]], [[Vangunu]], [[Rennell Island|Rennell]], [[Bellona Island|Bellona]], [[Makira]], [[Malaita]], [[Temotu Province|Temotu]] and a number of associated smaller islands were under British control and in 1893 became the [[British Solomon Islands|British Solomon Islands Protectorate]]. In 1945, Bougainville, and some associated minor islands, were transferred away from the protectorate to Australian administration and then in 1970 became a part of [[Papua New Guinea]].  The remainder stayed under the protectorate until independence in 1978 at which point they were officially named ''Solomon Islands''.  All of the north and south Solomon Islands taken together are generally referred to as ''[[Solomon Islands (archipelago)|the Solomon Islands]]'' to distinguish them from the nation state of ''Solomon Islands''.

Since 1998, ethnic violence, government misconduct, and crime have undermined stability and civil society. In June 2003 an Australian-led "multinational" force, the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands]] (RAMSI), arrived to restore peace and disarm ethnic militias.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ramsi.org/about.html "What is RAMSI?"], RAMSI&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geography of the Solomon Islands]]
The term ''the Solomon Islands'' refers to the group of islands that includes the islands of the nation state ''Solomon Islands'' but also other islands such as Bougainville, a province of Papua New Guinea.  ''The Solomon Islands'' was the name given to this wider group of geographical islands by the British administration up to the independence of Solomon Islands in 1978; this article concerns itself with the political entity, the nation state of Solomon Islands.

==Biography==
Darlington graduated in 1922 from secondary school at [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and then attended [[Harvard University]], where he graduated with bachelor's degree in 1926 and M.S. in 1927. In the 1920s he went on several field expeditions to the West Indies. From 1928 to 1929 he worked as an entomologist for the [[United Fruit Company]] near [[Santa Marta, Colombia]]. He returned to graduate study at Harvard University with an extensive collection of insects and vertebrates, including a diversity of bird skins, which formed the basis for a 1931 article.&lt;ref name=NAS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Notes on the birds of Rio Frio (near Santa Marta), Magdalena, Colombia|journal=Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology|year=1931|pages=349–421}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received in 1931 his Ph.D. from Harvard University with a thesis on the ''[[Carabidae]]'' (ground beetles) of New Hampshire.&lt;ref name=NAS/&gt; From 1931 to 1932 he was a member of the [[Harvard Australian Expedition (1931–1932)]] led by [[William Morton Wheeler]] and returned with a collection of a huge number of insects and 341 mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Capinera, John L.|chapter=Darlington, Jr., Philip J|title=Encyclopedia of Entomologists|year=2008|pages=1153–1154|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&amp;pg=PA1153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annual report of the director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College, to the president of Harvard College for 1932-1933.

Third Edition, Copywrite 1964, 1975, 1985, by the President and Fellows of Harvard College&lt;/ref&gt; His companion [[William E. Schevill]] reported that "Dr. Darlington's resourceful skill and industry had brought together, from New South Wales and Queensland, not only a large collection of insects, but also over three hundred fifty mammals, representing over sixty species, as well about fifty species of birds; in addition, he had about two hundred fifty reptiles and amphibians."&lt;ref&gt;Annual report of the director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College, to the president of Harvard College for 1932-1933. Cambridge, U.S.A.: Printed for the Museum p.54-58 [BHL - https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/41109461#page/58/mode/1up]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his return from the expedition, Darlington was made the MCZ's assistant curator of insects from 1932 to 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/chronob/DARL1904.htm|title=Darlington, Philip Jackson, Jr.|website=people.wku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1940 to 1951 the [[Henry Clinton Fall]] Curator of Coleoptera, and from 1951 until his retirement in 1971 the Curator of Insects. He was also at Harvard University from 1962 until his retirement in 1971 the [[Alexander Agassiz]] Professor of Zoology.&lt;ref name=NAS/&gt;

Upon the entry of the Unites States into WW II, Darlington enlisted as a Sanitary Corps entomologist with the rank of first lieutenant in the [[United States Army Medical Service Corps]]. He served in the [[Sixth United States Army]] during [[Operation Cartwheel]] and subsequent campaigns before retiring as a major in April 1944. Before he departed from New Guinea, he was able to collect many specimens of ground beetles and other insects.&lt;ref name=NAS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;

In 1942 Darlington married Elizabeth Koch, who later accompanied on many of his field expeditions. The couple and their son, Philip Frederick Darlington, spent eighteen months in 1956–1957 for a field study, camping from a truck in the Australian outback.&lt;ref name=NAS/&gt;

==Scientific fame==
Darlington presented a theory challenging [[William Diller Matthew]]'s 1915 theory of faunal dominance.&lt;ref name=NAS/&gt;

{{blockquote|Darlington's most important contribution to science was his theory of the Old World tropical origin of dominant vertebrate groups. He first sketched out this formulation—which would influence research in [[zoogeography]] for a generation—in The ''[[Quarterly Review of Biology]]'' of 1948, then presented it in full dress in his 1957 text, ''Zoogeography: The Geographical Distribution of Animals.''&lt;ref name=NAS/&gt;}}

==Episode with a crocodile==
During a WW II field survey for malarial mosquito larvae in New Guinea, Darlington was sampling stagnant water. Collecting alone in the jungle, he ventured into a stagnant pool by stepping carefully onto a submerged log, but a full-grown crocodile swam up and attacked him. Although seized in the crocodile's jaws, he somehow managed by kicking the crocodile to escape and scramble back to land. Despite serious loss of blood, torn muscles and ligaments in both arms, broken bones in his right arm, and piercing wounds in both hands, he was able to hike back to the U.S. army hospital.&lt;ref name=NAS/&gt;

{{blockquote|With characteristic understatement, Darlington wrote to his wife of "an episode with a crocodile" but supplied no further details. He was in a cast for several months, convalescing at [[Girua Airport|Dobodura, Papua]], where he perfected a left-handed technique for collecting insects: Have someone tie a vial to the end of a stick. Walk out into the forest, jam the stick into the ground, pull the cork out with the left hand, drop the specimens into the vial, replace the cork. He eventually regained full use of his hands and arms.&lt;ref name=NAS/&gt;}}

==Frog drop experiment==
[[Thomas Barbour]] was the director of Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology from 1927 to 1946. For many years, Barbour and Darlington had friendly arguments about Barbour's advocacy of faunal dispersion by land bridges versus Darlington's advocacy of exreme-wind-borne dispersal of small animals over isolated islands. To test his ideas, Darlington dropped several live frogs from a window on the fifth floor of the Museum. Barbour and a crowd of spectators observed the experiment. The dropped frogs were stunned
and remained still for a few seconds, but almost immediately they started to recover and in a few minutes were hopping normally.&lt;ref name=NAS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;

[[File:Cantino planisphere (1502).jpg|thumb|500px|The [[Cantino planisphere]] (1502), copy of the Portuguese Padrão Real]]

The '''Padrão Real''' ({{IPA-pt|pɐˈðɾɐ̃w̃ ʁiˈaɫ}}, translated into English as ''Royal Pattern'') was a cartographic work of Portuguese mastery produced secretly and maintained by the organization of the Portuguese Royal Court in the 16th century. The work was available to the scientific elite of the time, being exposed in the [[Casa da Índia|Casa da Índia (House of India)]]. In the Padrão Real the new discoveries of the Portuguese were constantly added and mapped. The first Padrão Real was produced in the time of [[Prince Henry the Navigator|Henry the Navigator]], even before the existence of the Casa da Índia.

The Padrão Real of the House of India hung from the ceiling in the Division of Maps as the Portuguese masterpiece, extremely secretive and guarded of foreign spies and merchants.

The Padrão Real included the complete record of the Portuguese discoveries, public and secret. The House of India issued maps based on the Padrão Real to navigators in Royal service.

The [[Cantino planisphere]] (1502) is a copy of the Padrão Real, possibly produced by some Portuguese bribed cartographer. It is conjectured that Cantino was able to bribe a cartographer to copy the map between December 1501 and October 1502. From a letter signed by Cantino it is thought that he sent the map to the [[Duchy of Ferrara|Duke of Ferrara]] on November 19, 1502.

The Padrão Real was lost in time. However a copy (Cantino planisphere) still exists. The Spanish counterpart of the Portuguese Padrão Real was the [[Padrón Real]], officially established by the Spanish Monarchs in 1508, in the [[Casa de Contratación]].

[[File:Vaipparfamily.JPG|thumb|Inhabitants of the Pearl Fishery Coast.]]
The '''Pearl Fishery Coast''' refers to a coastal area of southern [[India]], extending along the [[Coromandel Coast]] from [[Tuticorin]] to [[Comorin]] ruled by [[Paravar]]s.&lt;ref name="The Month 398"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eXFIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA398 ''The month'' Vol.66 p.398]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The coast took its name from the presence of [[pearls]] on the coast, and the numerous fisheries that operated to exploit them.&lt;ref name="Indian church history review"&gt;"Among the coastal areas the Fishery Coast was famous because of the pearls found in it. Thousands of people were employed every season in pearl fishing. The Paravas and Muslims often fought for the ownership of the Pearl Fishery." in ''Indian church history review'' Vol.35 2001 p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

In a conflict between the Paravas and the Arabs in 1532, the Paravas sought protection from the Portuguese. In 1535, the Portuguese led an army  under [[Pedro Vaz (captain)|Pedro Vaz]] and expelled the Arabs.&lt;ref name="Kim 103"/&gt; As a compensation, the Paravas accepted to convert to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Kim 103"/&gt; 

The Portuguese conquered the Pearl Fishery Coast from the Muslims of [[Kalyalpattanam]] in 1525.&lt;ref name="Kim 103"/&gt; They restored the rights of the Paravas to exploit their fisheries in exchange for a considerable annual tribute.&lt;ref name="Kim 103"/&gt;

The Paravas, who lived along the Pearl Fishery Coast adopted Christianity in 1535-1536, becoming an important Christian region, and succeeded the first introduction of Christianity in [[Mylapore]] with the [[Thomas Christians]].&lt;ref name="Kim 103"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xa4vAejmG_AC&amp;pg=PA103 ''Strange names of God'' Sangkeun Kim p.103''ff'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese derived considerable profit from the pearl trade, and strictly controlled the Pearl Fishery Coast through the [[Padroado]] system.&lt;ref name="Kim 103"/&gt;

The missionary [[Francis Xavier]], coming from [[Goa]], reached the Pearl Fishery Coast in 1542, where he was able to evangelize successfully the [[Paravars]], converting an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 souls.&lt;ref name="The Month 398"/&gt;

In 1553, a fleet of the [[Ottoman Empire]] made a raid on the Pearl Fishery Coast around [[Tuticorin]]. They were assisted by the [[Marakkar]] [[Muslims]] of [[Zamorin|Malabar]], and had the tacit agreement of [[Vittula Nayak]] of [[Madurai]].&lt;ref name="Malekandathil 117"&gt;''Maritime India-Trade, Religion and Polity In the Indian Ocean'' by Pius Malekandathil p.117 [https://books.google.com/books?id=rN69iFj1PJoC&amp;pg=PA117]&lt;/ref&gt; 52 Portuguese were captured at [[Punnaikayal]], and churches burnt down.&lt;ref name="Malekandathil 117"/&gt; The Ottomans failed however in 1553 against a Portuguese fleet at sea near [[al-Fahl]].&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Muscat: an illustrated guide and gazetteer'' John Peterson p.118 [https://books.google.com/books?id=gNu4_uHo7CQC&amp;pg=PA118]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Muscat: an illustrated guide and gazetteer'' John Peterson p.48 [https://books.google.com/books?id=gNu4_uHo7CQC&amp;pg=PA48]&lt;/ref&gt; 

There were numerous conflicts between the Christian Paravas and the Muslims for control of the fisheries.&lt;ref name="Indian church history review"/&gt;

{{Politics of Samoa}}
                                    
The '''Prime Minister of Samoa''' is the [[head of government]] of the [[Samoa|Independent State of Samoa]], a sovereign country located in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

==History of the office==
The first Prime Minister of Samoa was [[Albert Barnes Steinberger]], who originally represented the [[United States|American]] [[United States federal government|government]] in the [[Samoan Islands]] but was close to [[German Empire|German]] commercial interests. After the indigenous authorities of the islands adopted the Constitution of 1873, Steinberger was appointed Prime Minister by the King [[Malietoa Laupepa]] in July 1875. He hold this post for seven months before the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and American consuls in the country persuaded Laupepa to dismiss him, seeing his role as German interference in the islands. Over the next two decades, there was no Prime Minister in the country, and in 1899 Samoa fell under the colonial rule of the Western powers, being divided as [[German Samoa|a German colony]] and [[American Samoa|an American colony]] at the end of the [[Second Samoan Civil War]], according to the terms of the [[Tripartite Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;Malama Meleisea, ''Lagaga: A Short History of Western Samoa'', Apia, University of the South Pacific, 1987, {{ISBN|982-02-0029-6}}, pp.83-85&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the [[World War I]], [[German Samoa]] was [[Occupation of German Samoa|occupied]] by [[New Zealand]] in 1914, and was subsequently organized as [[Western Samoa Trust Territory|a trust territory]] of New Zealand in 1920. The territory gained independence in 1962 as the Independent State of Samoa. The [[Constitution of Samoa|Constitution]], adopted in 1960 during the transitional period of autonomy, provides that the [[Executive (government)|executive power]] is vested in the [[head of state]] ([[O le Ao o le Malo]]), elected by the [[Legislative Assembly of Samoa|Legislative Assembly]], and who acts only on the recommendation of the government. The head of state has a ceremonial role. The real executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister and his [[Cabinet of Samoa|cabinet]]. The Prime Minister is appointed by the head of state as a member of the Legislative Assembly who enjoys the confidence of a majority in the Legislative Assembly (Article 32 (2) (a)). The Prime Minister may be removed from office by the Legislative Assembly (Article 33 (1) (b)). Samoa is thus a [[parliamentary democracy]] based on the [[Westminster system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samlii.org/ws/legis/consol_act/cotisos1960438/ Constitution of Samoa]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Redstone Technical Test Center''' (RTTC) was one of the eight test centers that comprise the Developmental Test Command of the [[United States Army Test and Evaluation Command]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.rttc.army.mil/ | title = Redstone Technical Test Center | publisher = United States Army | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071028154815/http://www.rttc.army.mil/ | archivedate = 2007-10-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; RTTC conducted flight-testing of small [[rocket]]s and [[guided missile]]s, and performed life cycle testing for weapon components. It occupied over 265 buildings and {{convert|14000|acre|km2}} of [[Redstone Arsenal]], near [[Huntsville, Alabama]].  In October 2010, as part of the [[Base Reallocation and Closure]] (BRAC) process, RTTC was combined with the Aviation Technical Test Center from Fort Rucker to form the [[U.S. Army Redstone Test Center]].

== Use by NRPTA ==
The RTTC has developed a capability for static firing hypergolic liquid rocket engines. RTTC's facilities and procedures may be used for future testing of Army, DoD, NASA, and private industry's liquid rocket engines as part of the National Rocket Propulsion Test Alliance (NRPTA).&lt;ref&gt;

'''Remote sensing in geology''' is [[remote sensing]] used in the [[Geology|geological sciences]] as a data acquisition method complementary to [[Fieldnotes|field observation]], because it allows [[Geological map|mapping]] of geological characteristics of regions without physical contact with the areas being explored.&lt;ref name="PPRS"&gt;Rees, W. G. (2013). Physical Principles of Remote Sensing 3rd Edition. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; About one-fourth of the Earth’s total surface area is exposed land where information is ready to be extracted from detailed earth observation via remote sensing.&lt;ref name="RSSC"&gt;Kuehn, F., King, T. V. V., Hoerig, B., Peters, D. C., Newcomb, C., Toms, H. (2000). Remote Sensing for Site Characterization. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Remote sensing is conducted via detection of [[electromagnetic radiation]] by sensors.&lt;ref name="PPRS" /&gt; The radiation can be naturally sourced (passive remote sensing), or produced by machines (active remote sensing) and reflected off of the Earth surface.&lt;ref name="PPRS" /&gt; The electromagnetic radiation acts as an information carrier for two main variables. First, the intensities of [[reflectance]] at different [[wavelength]]s are detected, and plotted on a [[Radiometry|spectral reflectance curve]].&lt;ref name="PPRS" /&gt; This spectral fingerprint is governed by the physio-chemical properties of the surface of the target object and therefore helps [[mineral]] identification and hence geological mapping, for example by [[hyperspectral imaging]].&lt;ref name="PPRS" /&gt; Second, the two-way travel time of radiation from and back to the sensor can calculate the distance in active remote sensing systems, for example, [[Interferometric synthetic-aperture radar]]. This helps [[geomorphology|geomorphological studies]] of ground motion, and thus can illuminate [[Deformation (engineering)|deformations]] associated with [[landslides]], [[earthquakes]], etc.&lt;ref name="RSG"&gt;Gupta, R. P. (1991). Remote Sensing Geology. Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remote sensing data can help studies involving geological mapping, [[Geologic hazards|geological hazards]] and [[economic geology]] (i.e., exploration for minerals, petroleum, etc.).&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; These geological studies commonly employ a multitude of tools classified according to short to long wavelengths of the electromagnetic radiation which various instruments are sensitive to.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; Shorter wavelengths are generally useful for site characterization up to mineralogical scale, while longer wavelengths reveal larger scale surface information, e.g. regional thermal anomalies, surface roughness, etc.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; Such techniques are particularly beneficial for exploration of inaccessible areas, and planets other than Earth.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; Remote sensing of [[Proxy (statistics)|proxies]] for geology, such as [[soils]] and [[vegetation]] that preferentially grows above different types of rocks, can also help infer the underlying geological patterns.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; Remote sensing data is often visualized using [[Geographical Information System]] (GIS) tools.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; Such tools permit a range of quantitative analyses, such as using different wavelengths of collected data sets in various Red-Green-Blue configurations to produce [[false color]] [[image]]ry to reveal key features. Thus, [[Digital image processing|image processing]] is an important step to decipher parameters from the collected image and to extract information.

In remote sensing, the electromagnetic radiation acts as the information carrier, with a distance of tens to thousands of kilometers distance between the sensor and the target.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; Proximal Sensing is a similar idea but often refer to laboratory and field measurements, instead of images showing a large spatial extent.&lt;ref name="Mulder"&gt;Mulder, V. L., de Bruin, S., Schaepman, M. E., Mayr, T. R. (2011). The use of remote sensing in soil and terrain mapping — A review. Geoderma, 162, 1–19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exploration geophysics|Geophysical methods]], for instance [[Sonar]] and [[Acoustics|acoustic methods]], shares similar properties with remote sensing but electromagnetic wave is not the sole medium.&lt;ref name="Term"&gt;Paradella, W. R., Ferretti, A., Mura, J. C., Colombo, D., Gama, F. F., Tamburini, A., ... &amp; Silva, A. Q. (2015). Mapping surface deformation in open pit iron mines of Carajás Province (Amazon Region) using an integrated SAR analysis. Engineering Geology, 193, 61–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Geotechnical instrumentations, for example [[piezometer]], [[tiltmeter]] and [[Global Positioning System|Global Positioning System (GPS)]], on the other hand, often refer to instruments installed to measure discrete point data, compared to imagery in remote sensing.&lt;ref name="Term" /&gt; A suitable sensor sensitive to the particular wavelength region, according to the designated use, is selected and employed to collect the electromagnetic wave reflected or emitted from the target object.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt;

=== Working principles ===
In remote sensing, two main variables are measured in a typical remote sensing system: the [[radiance]] (or intensity) and [[time of arrival]] for active systems.&lt;ref name="PPRS" /&gt; The radiance (i.e. returning signal intensity) versus wavelength is plotted to a [[Radiometry|spectral reflectance curve]].&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; As a point to note, the data collected is a blend of both reflection of solar radiation and emission (according to [[Planck's law]]) from the object for [[VNIR|visible and near infrared (VNIR)]] region.&lt;ref name="FGERS"&gt;Vincent, R. K. (1997). Fundamentals of Geological and Environmental Remote Sensing. Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[thermal infrared]] (TIR) region measures mainly emission while [[microwave]] region record [[backscatter]]ing portion of reflection.&lt;ref name="FGERS" /&gt; The radiance is determined by radiation-matter interactions, which is governed by the physio-chemical properties of the target object.&lt;ref name="FGERS" /&gt; Prominent absorptions in specific wavelength shown on the spectral reflectance curve are the fingerprints for identification in spectroscopy.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; The two-way travel time of the radiation could infer the distance as the speed is approximately equal to the [[speed of light]], roughly 3 x 10^8&amp;nbsp;m/s. This allows application in ranging in [[Lidar|light detection and ranging (LiDAR)]] and [[Radar|Radio detection and ranging (Radar)]] etc.&lt;ref name="PPRS" /&gt;

Since the sensors are looking through the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] to reach the target, there are atmospheric absorption. Three main atmospheric windows, which allow penetration of radiation, can be identified.&lt;ref name="PPRS" /&gt; They are 0.4–3 micro-meters (Visible and Near-Infrared (VNIR)), 3–14 micro-meters (Thermal Infrared TIR) and few millimeters to meters (microwave).&lt;ref name="FGERS" /&gt; [[Camera]] in everyday life is a passive imaging system in VNIR wavelength region.&lt;ref name="PPRS" /&gt; A simple classification of prevailing remote sensing instruments in geology, modified from Rees (2013) in accordance with context of this page.&lt;ref name="PPRS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FGERS" /&gt; Text in [ ] refers to the related instruments.

=== Carrying platform ===
The sensor could be spaceborne (carried by [[satellite]]), airborne (carried by [[aircraft]], or most recently [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle]] (UAV)) or ground-based (sometimes called proximal sensing).&lt;ref name="UAV"&gt;Colomina, I., Molina, P. (2014). Unmanned aerial systems for photogrammetry and remote sensing: A review. ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing 92 (2014) 79–97&lt;/ref&gt; Data acquired from higher elevation captures a larger [[field of view]]/ spatial coverage, but the [[Image resolution|resolutions]] are often lower.&lt;ref name="Space"&gt;Bürgmann, R., Thatcher, W.

=== Advantages and limitations ===
The main advantage of employing remote sensing to deal with geological problem is that it provides direct information on the surface cover using a synoptic coverage or sometimes [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic view]].&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; Hence the big picture of [[kinematics]] could be better appreciated. It also reduces the burden of field work required for the area through synoptic studies of the area of interest.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; The spectral vision allows identification of rock attributes for surficial mapping.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; The resolution however controls the accuracy.

There is a trade-off between spatial resolution and spectral resolution.&lt;ref name="FGERS" /&gt; Since the intensity of incident ray is fixed, for a higher spectral resolution, it is expected to have a lower spatial resolution (one [[pixel]] represent larger area) to maintain an up-to-standard [[signal-to-noise ratio]] for analysis.&lt;ref name="FGERS" /&gt; Also, the data volume for transmission is limited due to signal engineering problem.&lt;ref name="FGERS" /&gt; One can never obtain data with maximum resolutions in all spatial, spectral and radiometric resolutions due to these constraints. The temporal resolution could be understood as both the revisiting frequency and the deformation duration.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; For instance an instantaneous [[landslide]] or [[sinkhole]] collapse could hardly be recorded without high speed camera, while relics could be imaged into time-series where the temporal change, for instance [[ice calving]] could be revealed.

Another deficiency is the inconsistent data acquisition method, plus their interpretation schemes.&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; As a result, an ideal database is hardly feasible because of dynamic environmental conditions in different locality.&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; Instead, repeated reconnaissance is suggested for studying a specific area.&lt;ref name="UAV" /&gt;

Field observation and reconnaissance remains irreplaceable and shall never be taken over completely by remote sensing because field data greatly support remote sensing data interpretation.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; Remote sensing should better be considered to be complementary which aims to provide instantaneous views of different scale, perspective or spectral vision.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; Subsurface mapping by [[Geophysical survey]] and simulation models still play an important role in the 3 dimensional characterization of soil underground.&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; A word of caution is that there is no such an ‘ideal’ sensor capable or optimized to study everything.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; It is often up to scientist’s preference and experience to pick which dataset and extract information.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; For instance aerial photographs could be more sensible in cloud-free area, but otherwise radar may perform better for overcast weather.

== Geological mapping ==
[[File:Remote Sensing tackling geological problem.png|thumb|451x451px|A typical workflow for tackling geological problem, starting from defining the problem down to data selection and interpretation, inspired by Gupta (1991)]][[File:Quartz Reflectance.gif|thumb|438x438px|An example of a mineral quartz spectral reflectance curve]]Remote sensing can aid surficial geological mapping and landform characterization.

=== Spectral features ===
The [[VNIR|visible and near infrared (VNIR)]] and [[Infrared|thermal infrared (TIR)]] are sensitive to intra-atomic electronic transitions and inter-atomic bond strength respectively can help mineral and rock identifications.The instrument in use is called [[spectroradiometer]] in lab and imaging spectrometer or multi-/ hyper-spectral scanner as imaging remote sensors.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; Provided that the land is not obscured by dense [[vegetation]], some characteristics of superficial [[soil]] (the unconsolidated sedimentary materials covering the land as surficial deposits from [[weathering]] and [[erosion]] of bedrock) may be measured with a penetration depth into air-soil interface of about half of wavelength used (e.g. green light (~0.55 [[Micrometre|micro-meters]]) gives depth of penetration into ~0.275 micro-meters).&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; Hence most remote sensing systems using the VNIR wavelength region give characteristics of surface soil, or sometimes exposed rock.&lt;ref name="RSEnv"&gt;Jensen, J. R. (2007). Remote Sensing of the Environment An Earth Resource Perspective. Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; Another parameter controlling the overall reflectance is [[surface roughness]].&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; The same surface can appear rough in VNIR may appear smooth in [[microwave]], similar to what we perceive when we use a meter rule to measure roughness where surface fluctuation are in cm-scale. As grain size decreases, surface roughness increases and hence overall reflectance increases as [[diffuse reflection]], instead of [[specular reflection]], dominates.&lt;ref name="PPRS" /&gt; Specular reflection by smooth surface, for example calm water, gives little [[backscatter]]ing and hence appear dark. As an example, ice is mostly transparent in a large piece but becomes highly reflective when smashed into small grains.

==== Mineral and rock ====
In [[Lithology|lithological composition studies]], lab and field [[spectroscopy]] of proximal and remote sensing can help. The [[Reflectance|spectral reflectance]] data from imaging spectrometry employing short wavelength, for example form [[Airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer]] (AVIRIS),&lt;ref name="RSEnv" /&gt; provide chemical properties of the target object. For instance, the iron content, which is indicative of the [[soil fertility]] and the age of [[sediment]], could be approximated.&lt;ref name="RSEnv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; For soil with high iron oxide, which is [[red]] in colour, should give higher reflectance in red wavelength portion and diminishes in [[blue]] and [[green]]. There may also be absorption at 850-900&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="RSEnv" /&gt; The Redness Index and absorption area in 550&amp;nbsp;nm in spectral reflectance curve are examples to quantify iron content in soil.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeus, H., Epema, G., Schaepman, M.E. (2007). Determining iron content in Mediterranean soils in partly vegetated areas, using spectral reflectance and imaging spectroscopy. Int. J. Appl. Earth Obs. Geoinf. 9 (2), 194–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

To identify mineral, available spectral reflectance libraries, for instance the [https://speclab.cr.usgs.gov/spectral-lib.html USGS Spectral Library], summarize diagnostic absorption bands for many materials not limited to rocks and minerals. This helps create a mineral map to identify the type of mineral sharing similar spectra, with minimal in situ field work.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; The mineralogy is identified by matching collected sample with spectral libraries by statistical method, such as [[partial least squares regression]]. In addition to high signal-to-noise ratio (&gt;40:1), a fine spatial resolution, which limits the amount of elements inside one single pixel, also promotes decision accuracy.&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; There are also digital subpixel spectral unmixing tools available. The [https://speclab.cr.usgs.gov/tetracorder.html USGS Tetracorder] which applies multiple algorithms to one spectral data with respect to the spectral library is sensitive and give promising results.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, R.N., et al., 2003. Imaging spectroscopy: earth and planetary remote sensing with the USGS Tetracorder and expert systems. J. Geophys. Res. 108 (5), 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The different approaches are summarized and classified in literature but unfortunately there is no universal recipe for mineral identification.

For rocks, be they [[Igneous rock|igneous]], [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] or [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]], most of their diagnostic spectral characteristics of mineralogy are present in longer wavelength (SWIR and TIR), which is for [http://www.ga.gov.au/webtemp/image_cache/GA7833.pdf example] present in the [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer|ASTER]] mission.&lt;ref name="RSEnv" /&gt; This is due to the sensitivity of vibrational bands of longer wavelength. As opposed to the automatic statistical interpretation mentioned above for minerals, it is more advisable to adopt visual interpretation for identification of rock because the surficial alteration of rock may exhibit very different spectral responses.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt;

Several indices are proposed for rock type identification, such as Quartz Index, Carbonate Index and Mafic Index, where Di is the data of the i-th band in ASTER.&lt;ref&gt;Ninomiya, Y., Fu, B., Cudahy, T.J., 2005.

==== Soil ====
Surficial soil is a good proxy to the geology underneath. Some of the properties of soil, alongside lithology mentioned above, are retrievable in remote sensing data, for instance Landsat ETM+, to develop the [[soil horizon]] and therefore aid its [[Soil classification|classification]].&lt;ref name="RSEnv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt;

===== Soil texture and moisture content =====
The amount of [[moisture]] within soil particles is governed by the [[particle size]] and [[soil texture]] as the interstitial space may be filled with air for dry soil and water for saturated soil. Essentially, the finer the [[grain size]], the higher capability to hold moisture. As mentioned above, wetter soil is brighter than dry soil in radar image. For short wavelength VNIR region, in the same theory, clayey surface with smaller grain size promoting more backscattering should give higher spectral response. However, the higher soil moisture and [[Soil organic matter|organic contents]] makes [[clay]] darker in images, compared to silty and sandy soil cover after [[precipitation]].&lt;ref name="RSEnv" /&gt; With regard to VNIR region, as the moisture content increases, more prominent absorption (at 1.4, 1.9, 2.7 micrometers, and sometimes at 1.7 for hydroxyl absorption band) take place. On the other hand, radar is sensitive to one more factor: [[dielectric constant]].&lt;ref name="PPRS" /&gt; Since water has a high dielectric constant, it has high reflectivity and hence more backscattering takes place, i.e. appears brighter in radar images.&lt;ref name="PPRS" /&gt; Therefore, soil appears brighter with higher soil moisture content (with the presence of [[Capillary action|capillary water]]) but appears dark for flooded soil (specular reflection). Quantitatively, while soil texture is determined by statistical means of [[Regression analysis|regression]] with [[calibration]], scientists also developed a Soil Water Index (SWI)&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, W., Pathe, C., Sabel, D., Bartsch, A., Kunzer, C., Scipal, K., 2007. Experimental 1 km soil moisture products from ENVISTAT ASAR for Southern Africa, SHARE project and the MISAR project. European Space Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; for long-term change detection. Another approach is surface energy balance model, which makes prediction on the actual [[evapotranspiration]].&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt;

In short, the soil moisture overall reflectance could be tabulated. 
{| class="wikitable"
!'''Tools'''
!'''Dry Soil'''
!'''Wet Soil'''
!'''Flooded Soil'''
|-
|Radar
|darker (energy penetrate into soil of low dielectric constant)
|brighter (water has high dielectric constant)
|very dark (specular reflection)
|-
|VNIR
|brighter (less absorption)
|darker (prominent water absorption)
|same as water (low penetration depth)
|}

===== Soil organic carbon =====
Soil organic carbon is mainly derived from proximal sensing using mid infrared reflectance.&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; A darker soil colour results from the saturated [[Soil organic matter|organic matter]] plus variable amount of black [[humic acid]] and soil moisture.&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; The higher the amount of organic content in the soil, incident energy would be greatly absorbed and as a result lower reflectance is expected in general.&lt;ref name="RSEnv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; The contrast in soil colour allows quantitative analysis of band depth analysis, [[principal component analysis]] and modeling.&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt;

===== Soil salinity =====
[[Soil salinity]] is the result of insufficient rainwater [[precipitation]] which leads to accumulation of soluble salt in soil horizon. The spectral proximal sensing in VNIR is sensitive to absorption of water in hydrated [[Evaporite|evaporate minerals]], most prominently at 505&amp;nbsp;nm, 920&amp;nbsp;nm, 1415&amp;nbsp;nm and 2205&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="RSEnv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; For even more saline soil, 680, 1180&amp;nbsp;nm and 1780&amp;nbsp;nm would also give lower reflectance (higher absorption) and higher reflectance at 2200&amp;nbsp;nm possibly due to the loss of [[crystallinity]] in clay minerals.&lt;ref name="RSEnv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; The spectral curve also shows a decreasing overall slope from 800&amp;nbsp;nm to 1300&amp;nbsp;nm for higher salinity.&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; The overall reflectance curve in all wavelength increases with higher salt concentration, while the compositions of salt would show some variations in absorption bands.&lt;ref name="RSEnv" /&gt;

[[File:Remote Sensing (Geology) Working Flowchart.png|thumb|445x445px|The surface manifestations of the geological kinematics provide clues for photo interpretation, inspired by Gupta (1991)]]

=== Geomorphology === 
3-dimensional geomorphological features arising from regional [[tectonics]] and formation mechanisms could also be understood from a perspective of small scale images showing a large area acquired in elevation. The [[topography]] of an area is often characterized by [[Volcano|volcanic activity]] or [[Orogeny|orogenesis]]. These mountain building processes are determined by the [[Hooke's law|stress-strain relation]] in accordance with rock types.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; They behave as elastic/ plastic/ fracturing deformations, in response to different kinetics. Remote sensing techniques provide evidence such as observed lineament, global scale mountain distribution, seismicity and volcanic activities to support crustal scale [[tectonics]] and [[geodynamics]] studies.&lt;ref name="Space" /&gt; Additional spectral information also helps. For example, the grain size differentiates snow and ice.&lt;ref name="FGERS" /&gt; Aside from a planar [[geological map]] with cross-sections, sometimes 3-dimensional view from stereo-photos or representation in [[Digital elevation model|Digital Elevation Model (DEM)]] could aid the visualization.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; In theory, LiDAR gives the best resolution up to cm grade while radar gives 10m grade because of its high sensitivity to small scale roughness.&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; Oblique images could greatly enhance the third-dimension, but users should bear in mind the shadowing and distortions.

== Inaccessible areas ==
Although field mapping is the most primary and preferable way to acquire ground truth, the method does not work when areas become inaccessible, for example the conditions are too dangerous or extreme. Sometimes political concerns bar scientists’ entering. Remote sensing, on the other hand, provides information of the area of interest sending neither a man nor a sensor to the site.

=== Desert ===
Desert area is shaped by [[Aeolian processes|eolian processes]] and its landforms by [[erosion]] and [[Deposition (geology)|deposition]].&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; The stereopairs of [[Aerial photography|aerial photos]] provide three-dimensional visualization for the land feature while [[Hyperspectral imaging|hyperspectral image]] provide grain scale information for grain size, sand composition etc.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; The images are often of high phototones in short wavelengths in VNIR corresponding to the scanty vegetation and little moisture.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; Another tool is radar, which has the capability to penetrate surficial sand, a material of low dielectric constant.&lt;ref name="Desert"&gt;Paillou, P. (2017). Mapping Palaeohydrography in Deserts: Contribution from Space-Borne Imaging Radar. Water, 9(3), 194. doi:10.3390/w9030194&lt;/ref&gt; This see-through characteristic, notably of the L-band (1.25&amp;nbsp;GHz) microwave of 1–2&amp;nbsp;m penetration, allows subsurface mapping and possibly identification of past aquifer.&lt;ref name="Desert" /&gt; The paleohydrography in Sahara Desert and Gobi Desert is revealed and further studies using airborne P-band (435&amp;nbsp;MHz) for penetration of 5&amp;nbsp;m is proposed in future research.&lt;ref name="Desert" /&gt;

=== Political sensitive area ===
[[Politics]] poses challenge to scientific research. One example is the [[Tibesti Mountains]], which is remote and politically unstable in recent decades due to conflicts over [[uranium]] deposit underneath.&lt;ref name="PoliS"&gt;Permenter, J. L., &amp; Oppenheimer, C. (2007). Volcanoes of the Tibesti massif (Chad, northern Africa). Bulletin of volcanology, 69(6), 609–626.&lt;/ref&gt; The area, however, could possibly serve as one spectacular example of intracontinental volcanism or [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]].&lt;ref name="PoliS" /&gt; Detailed studies of the area divided into Western, Central and Eastern Tibesti Volcanic Province shows no significant sign of spatially progressive volcanism, and hence it is unlikely to be a hotspot as the manifestation of [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian]] or [[Galápagos Islands|Galapagos]] Islands.&lt;ref name="PoliS" /&gt; More data and systematic field survey and studies, for instance [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] and [[radiometric dating]], are great topics to  focus on in the near future.&lt;ref name="PoliS" /&gt; The Tibesti board swell dome is also studied as a regional river system to estimate the uplift rate.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, G. G., &amp; White, N. (2010). Estimating uplift rate histories from river profiles using African examples. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, 115(B2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Water bodies

Water bodies, for instance ocean and glaciers, could be studied using remote sensing. Here are two examples for plankton and glacier mapping.

The bloom of photosynthesizing phytoplankton is an ecological proxy to favorable environmental conditions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Blondeau-Patissier, D., Gower, J. F., Dekker, A. G., Phinn, S. R., &amp; Brando, V. E. (2014). A review of ocean color remote sensing methods and statistical techniques for the detection, mapping and analysis of phytoplankton blooms in coastal and open oceans. ''Progress in oceanography'', ''123'', 123-144.&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite remote sensing in VNIR wavelength region help locate sporadic event of change in ocean colour due to relative increase in related absorption in spectral curve.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Different band math (e.g. band ratio algorithms and spectral band difference) are developed to cater coastal and open water, and even some specific types of bloom (e.g. Coccolithophore blooms and Trichodesmium blooms).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The capability of real-time monitoring by combined use of long term satellite data allows better insight into the ocean dynamics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The mapping of glaciers is facilitated by remote sensing in contrast with carrying heavy equipment to dangerous icy land.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bhambri, R., &amp; Bolch, T. (2009). Glacier mapping: a review with special reference to the Indian Himalayas. ''Progress in Physical Geography'', ''33''(5), 672-704.&lt;/ref&gt; Some notable applications include mapping of clean-ice and debris-covered glaciers, glacier fluctuation records, mass balance and volume change studies to aid generating topographic map and quantitative analysis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similarly, automated approach using band math and DEM calculations using high resolution data is requisite to look into the glacial variations due to dynamic environmental conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Geologic hazards == 
[[Geologic hazards|Geological hazards]] cause casualties and serious damage to properties. While it is almost impossible to prevent naturally occurring disasters, their impact could be reduced and minimized with proper prior risk assessment and planning.&lt;ref name="Haz"&gt;Joyce, K. E., Belliss, S. E., Samsonov, S. V., McNeill, S. J. &amp; Glassey, P. J. (2009).

=== Earthquakes ===
[[Earthquake]]s manifest itself in movement of earth surface.&lt;ref name="EQ1"&gt;Prescott, W. (1993). Seeing earthquakes from afar. Nature, 364, 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt; Remote sensing can also help earthquake studies by two aspects. One is to better understand the local ground condition. For instance some soil type, which is prone to [[liquefaction]] (e.g. saturated loose alluvial material), do more damage under vibration and therefore earthquake hazard zoning may help in reducing property loss.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; Another one is to locate historical earthquakes in neotectonism (past 11000 years) and analysis its spatial distribution, and hence [[Fault (geology)|fault zones]] with structural ruptures are mapped for further investigations.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; From a geodetic perspective, the radar technique ([[Interferometric synthetic-aperture radar|SAR Interferometry]], also called InSAR) provides land displacement measurement up to cm scale.&lt;ref name="INSARF"&gt;European Space Research and Technology Centre.

(2004). Mid-infrared emission prior to strong earthquakes analyzed by remote sensing data. Advances in Space Research, 33, 268–273.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from these long-lived thermal fields, there are some positive thermal anomalies of 3–4&amp;nbsp;°C on land surface or around −5&amp;nbsp;°C for sea water in earthquake [[epicenter]] areas. The contrast appears 7–14 days prior to the earth movement. Though the observation is supported by laboratory experiments, the possible causes of these differences are still debatable.

=== Tsunami ===
[[Mangrove]] offers protection against [[tsunami]] and [[storm]]s from sweeping away inland areas because the mangrove fringes were damaged and took all the energy.&lt;ref&gt;Dahdouh-Guebas, F., Jayatissa, L. P., Di Nitto, D., Bosire, J. O., Seen, D. L., &amp; Koedam, N. (2005). How effective were mangroves as a defence against the recent tsunami?. Current biology, 15(12), R443-R447.&lt;/ref&gt; Remote sensing of mangrove and vegetation as a natural barrier to manage risks therefore becomes a hot topic.

=== Volcanism ===
The dynamic [[magma]] underneath plates we are living on induces volcanic activity on earth’s surface.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; To advance the understanding in volcanological science and active volcano monitoring, the main data streams aided by remote sensing include surface deformation and thermal measurement plus the gas flux and composition.&lt;ref name="VolR"&gt;Pyle, D.

=== Landslides ===
[[Landslide]] is one form of mass wasting caused by [[gravity]] and [[Slope stability|slope instability]].&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; The rock and [[Debris flow|debris]] fall downward and outward from slope rapidly. Apart from site characterization through geological mapping, many of the remote sensing tools mentioned could be employed.&lt;ref name="LSR"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Scaioni, M., Longoni, L., Melillo, V. &amp; Monica P.|year=2014|title=Remote Sensing for Landslide Investigations: An Overview of Recent Achievements and Perspectives|journal=Remote Sensing|volume=6|issue=1-x manuscripts|doi=10.3390/rs60x000x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the use of aerial photos to update landslide inventory is popular in [[Hong Kong]] landslide studies.&lt;ref name="HHYAP"&gt;Ho, H. (2004). Application of aerial photograph interpretation in geotechnical practice in Hong Kong. (Thesis). University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR. Retrieved from https://dx.doi.org/10.5353/th_b4257758&lt;/ref&gt; The [[LiDAR]] technique to create a [[Digital elevation model|High Resolution Digital Elevation Model (HRDEM)]] and [[Digital terrain model|Digital Terrain Model (DTM)]] with vegetation cover is crucial to the quantification of [[slope]], [[Aspect (geography)|slope aspect]], [[stream power]], [[drainage density]] and many more parameters for landslide hazard models.&lt;ref name="LSR" /&gt; Microwave radar can also take part in landslide recognition in [[Synthetic-aperture radar|synthetic aperture radar (SAR)]] images and monitoring through the [[Interferometric synthetic-aperture radar|InSAR]] technique which effectively shows small scale deformation.&lt;ref name="LSR" /&gt; The hazard risk management could be further discussed using [[Geographic information system|geographical information system (GIS)]].

== Economic geology ==
In the context of [[economic geology]], the surficial data help locate possible reserves of [[natural resource]]s.

=== Mineral and petroleum exploration ===
The occurrence of nature reserves that are exploitable is in close association with the surrounding geology. Feasible resources explorations should be backed up by accurate [[Geologic modelling|geological models]] to locate prospect [[ore]] and [[petroleum]] deposits from a preliminary regional overview.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; Remote sensing can provide scalable investigation as the exploration program progress at a reasonable expenditure. One example is to monitor the surface deformation in a mine using [[Interferometric synthetic-aperture radar|InSAR]] time series.&lt;ref name="Term" /&gt; Another example is using short wavelength region in VNIR  to estimate the petroleum reservoir because VNIR can provide both accurate distance measurement by lidar and spectral data from spectral scanning.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgetts, D. (2013). Laser scanning and digital outcrop geology in the petroleum industry: a review. Marine and Petroleum Geology, 46, 335–354.&lt;/ref&gt; One point to bear in mind is the inherit limitation, that remote sensing is for surface detection while natural resources are concentrated in depth, therefore its use is somewhat limited. Nonetheless, there are some proxies providing valuable inputs, including the following examples&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt;
#stratigraphical-lithological: some [[mineral]]s are syngenetic or epigenic with host rocks
#geomorphological: mechanical concentration of minerals in morphology
#structural: intersection of structural features to form [[structural trap]]s
#rock alteration: [[quartz]]-[[feldspar]]s, [[Carbonate rock|carbonates]], [[Hydroxy group|hydroxyl]]-bearing minerals, [[Phyllosilicates|sheet silicates]], iron oxides ([[limonite]]), commonly manifest as ring or halo with zoned [[Mineral alteration|alteration]], with the aid of image enhancement
#geobotanical: vegetation stress and abnormal growth may be due to metal in soil
[[File:Escondida Mine, Chile, Landsat 1989, 2013.png|thumb|400x400px|The expansion of tailing impoundment to save water and minimize environmental impact in Escondida Mine, Chile, world’s largest source of copper - Landsat]]

A new method is proposed in respect to the above rock alteration means, in light of the deficiencies in low reflectance due to vegetation cover and the ambiguity of some minerals, for instance [[kaolinite]] which may or may not be resultant altered mineral. The overall spectral shape from [[hyperspectral imaging]] is considered first, followed by absorption bands, in their algorithm. Correlation coefficients for each pixel is then calculated by comparison between the remote sensing data and ground field data. The decision would be assigned to each [[pixel]] by the most susceptible dominant object, but not by setting up threshold.&lt;ref&gt;Xu, Y., Ma, H., Peng, S. (2014). Study on identification of altered rock in hyperspectral imagery using spectrum of field object. Ore Geology Reviews, 56, 584–595.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Groundwater investigations ===
Targeting [[groundwater]] resources for supply is one of the ultimate goals in water management. While much of the information is indeed provided from [[hydrogeology]], geophysical methods and drilling, the remote sensing technique, using the same principle to integrate data collected for the surface, can infer possible confined/ unconfined [[aquifers]].&lt;ref name="WGIS"&gt;Jha, M. K., Chowdhury, A., Chowdary, V. M., &amp; Peiffer, S. (2007). Groundwater management and development by integrated remote sensing and geographic information systems: prospects and constraints. Water Resources Management, 21(2), 427–467.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance in radar data ([[ground penetrating radar]]), which is able to penetrate the ground deep into meters, may show some diffuse reflection for ‘rough’ surface relative to the wavelength used. The change in lithology may suggest soft rock and unconsolidated sediments, where [[porosity]] is high.

== Vegetation ==
The surficial vegetation studies are mainly accomplished by multispectral or hyperspectral image analysis, mainly because of the lower penetration depth and higher resolutions of VNIR wavelength region.&lt;ref name="Vege" /&gt; There are a multitude of sensors, image processing and classification algorithms and result evaluation schemes from ancillary data available in vegetation analysis.&lt;ref name="Vege" /&gt; As an example, rangeland characterization with regard to biomass quantity and quality could be inferred from hyperspectral data.&lt;ref&gt;Beeri O, Phillips R, Hendrickson J, et al. (2007) Estimating forage quantity and quality using aerial hyperspectral imagery for northern mixed-grass prairie.  Remote Sens Environ 110:216–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vege" /&gt; The detection of photosynthetic active (standing live) versus non-photosynthetic active (standing dead) and their ratio in the area of interest supports the quantification of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. The quality of forage presented in [[Carbon]]:[[Nitrogen]] ratio could be estimated through hyperspectral data manipulation with greater than 80% accuracy.[[File:Vegetation transformation in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.png|thumb|385x385px|The vegetation have changed from dense forest to rectangular soybean cultivation land in Santa Cruz, Bolivia - Landsat]]From a geological perspective, some superficial cover may obscure the area of interest in an image. With vegetation, the time-series of Normalized difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which characterizes crop growth could derive soil patterns.&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; The biogeographical gradient incorporating environmental parameters, such as floristic conditions, precipitation and temperature also provide clues to soil cover.&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; Spectral unmixing technique assuming that the total reflectance of a pixel is a linear mix of component reflectance delineates objects contributing the resultant signal received in the sensor.&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; Some other parameters and soil proxies such as non-photosynthetic vegetation cover, lichens, Plant Functional Types and Ellenberg indicator values are possible for soil characterization.&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt;

== Planetary observation ==
[[File:Tvashtar volcano on Io from New Horizons.jpg|thumb|Volcanism on Io to lose heat imaged by LORRI camera of the New Horizons probe]]
Aside from the Earth, remote sensing has made planetary exploration possible without sending an [[astronaut]] into space. For most planetary explorations, due to the thick [[atmosphere]], radar is a suitable instrumentation to investigate planetary surface. Radar can penetrate the atmosphere and detect the surface roughness. Also, topographic maps could be derived from radar altimetry and [[Interferometric synthetic-aperture radar|InSAR]] methods, for instance in the [[mapping of Venus]]. As an example of planetary applications using remote sensing could be illustrated by the [[volcanism]] observation on [[Io (moon)|Io]], which features the highest amount of active volcanoes per square kilometer in the [[Solar System]]. While the importance of [[Volcanology of Io|Io Volcanology]] is well documented as textbooks,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, A. G. (2007). Volcanism on Io a comparison with Earth. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; new observations point out that the temporal evolution of spectral ratio between 2:5 micrometer thermal emissions (thermal signature) could infer eruption modes, from lava fountain down to silicic lava flows.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, A. G., Keszthelyi, L. P., Harris, A. J. L. (2010). The thermal signature of volcanic eruptions on Io and Earth. Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research, 194, 75–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent suggestion have been made to improve the spatial resolution to locate more accurately the heat source vent, so as to elucidate the unsolved puzzle of the volcanology, which is strongly related to the [[tidal heating]] caused by the [[orbital eccentricity]] of [[Jupiter]]. Modeling has shown that a suitable distance between the surveyed ground and the sensor has to be maintained to ensure a meaningful pixel size to resolve the Io surface. Remote sensing by satellite also reduces jittering as the sensor is held stable in space and gives accurate data in the absence of atmosphere for terrestrial observations, notwithstanding the strong [[radiation zone]] in Jupiter which dramatically limits sensor lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Delory, G. T., Laver, C., de Pater, I., Pitman, J., Duncan, A. (2010). High resolution remote sensing observations for missions to the Jovian system: Io as a case study. Planetary andSpaceScience, 58, 1699–1707.&lt;/ref&gt; All these promotes future instrumentation and orbit design.

== Image processing ==
{{main|Digital image processing}}
[[Digital image processing|Image processing]] is crucial to convert raw data into useful information. For imaging remote sensing, where spectral data are collected and recorded in [[pixel]]s of an [[image]], a two dimensional representation. After removal of noise and [[calibration]], images are then [[Georeferencing|geo-referenced]] to relate [[pixel]] to real-life geography. The first-hand data are then corrected to remove noise such as atmospheric disturbance, structural effects and [[distortion]]. Remote sensing data are often validated by [[ground truth]], which usually serves as [[Training, test, and validation sets|training data]] in image classification to ensure quality.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; The image interpretation could be achieved by an interpreter or computation.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt; The reliability of the map interpreted is high only if the expert has a thorough understanding of geomorphology, how the surface landscape could be shaped by possible interactions of numerous factors and the limitation of the method. Although there exist a wealth of experiences is present for visual interpretation of aerial photos, the method is time-consuming and prone to human errors. Digital supervised or unsupervised landform classification employing [[Classical logic|crisp]] or [[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy]] clustering logic have opened new possibility to the viable solutions. However, computation algorithms are subject to scale dependence matters and arbitrary definition of class boundaries. The presence of vegetation cover and rugged terrain may also reduce the applicability.&lt;ref name="Mulder" /&gt; Statistical and computational algorithms to identify correlations are developing vigorously for image analysis. For example, the emergence of non-parametric classifiers such as neural network becomes an alternative in classifying massive data.&lt;ref name="PPRS" /&gt;

== Integration with GIS ==
The remote sensing technique is intimately connected to later data interpretation and visualization, which is one of the capabilities in [[Geographical Information System]] (GIS).&lt;ref name="RSEnv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PPRS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RSSC" /&gt; The GIS also allows input of other information such as socio-economic conditions and biophysical conditions in terms of layers.&lt;ref name="WGIS" /&gt; Further analyses in the same spatial extent are carried out and thematic maps are then generated for presentation.&lt;ref name="RSEnv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PPRS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RSSC" /&gt; By no means could the application by integration of GIS and remote sensing be exhaustive, but here the topics of hydrology, landslide and urban planning are discussed.

=== Hydrology ===
There are a variety of applications of GIS and remote sensing data in water management, ranging from exploration, modeling of subsurface flow and natural recharge, pollution control and hydrogeologic process monitoring. In essence, the [[topography]], [[Vegetation|vegetation cover]], [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage landforms]] and [[aquifer]] types could be inferred from remote sensing data and images from various types of sensors and platform.&lt;ref name="WGIS" /&gt; A case study in [[Burdur]], [[Turkey]] presenting the use of remote sensing data and spatial analysis performed by GIS is one of the pioneer projects.&lt;ref name="WGIST"&gt;Sener, E., Davraz, A., Ozcelik, M. (2007). An integration of GIS and remote sensing in groundwater investigations: A case study in Burdur, Turkey. Hydrogeology Journal, 13, 826–834.&lt;/ref&gt; Remote sensing collected data for geology and lineament density while GIS derived drainage density, topography elevation, gradient, landuse and the annual rainfall data.&lt;ref name="WGIST" /&gt; With weighted overlay, a groundwater potential map is generated to locate possible new water sources.&lt;ref name="WGIST" /&gt;

=== Landslide ===
A wealth of literature has shown the use of the remote sensing techniques for landslide is successful in all recognition, monitoring and hazard assessment aspects.&lt;ref name="LSR" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tofani, V., Segoni, S., Agostini, A., Catani, F. &amp; Casagli N. (2013). Technical Note: Use of remote sensing for landslide studies in Europe. Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, 13, 299–309.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the examples in Europe, landslides in Hong Kong brought casualties and property damage to the territory before the establishment of relevant government organization to carry out systematic studies to reduce risk of slope failure.&lt;ref&gt;Hencher, S. R. &amp; Malone, A. W. (2012). Hong Kong Landslides. Landslides: Types, Mechanisms and Modelling. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The major contributing factors, similar to landslides all over the world, include geology, discontinuities (structural), weathering and [[rainfall]]. The intense rainfall (&gt;2000mm/year) rapidly raises the [[pore pressure]] due to [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]. While local hydrogeological models generated with the aid of in situ, for instance, [[Piezometer|piezometric measurements]] and discontinuity mapping, could help elucidate the kinematics of landslides, employing remote sensing for landslide evaluation in Hong Kong is never short of experience. For instance, [[Interferometric synthetic-aperture radar]]&lt;ref name="Chen F. 2014"/&gt; and aerial photo interpretation&lt;ref name="HHYAP" /&gt; is the tool used in history for detecting surface deformation and updating landslide inventory respectively. GIS is also used to overlay layers of terrain (elevation and slope angle), lithology with rainfall data to generate landslide hazard maps. With the different weightings in respective parameters, the hazard could be zoned to get the risk controlled.

=== Urban environmental applications ===
Remote sensing has much potential in environmental applications. To name a few, the land use planning (for instance nuclear power plant location &amp; dumping sites), monitoring of soil erosion and atmospheric pollution, vegetation etc. have been in great interest in the recent decade.&lt;ref name="RSG" /&gt;

'''Royal Brinkman''' is a supplier, installer and consultant for the professional horticultural industry. The company has more than 20 offices with several Dutch offices in: [['s-Gravenzande|’s-Gravenzande]], [[Bleiswijk]], [[Roosendaal]], [[Venlo]] and [[Gameren]]. Other offices are based in [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Spain]], [[Poland]], [[Turkey]], [[Australia]] and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;https://royalbrinkman.nl/vestigingen&lt;/ref&gt; The managing board consists of Ton van Mil ([[CEO]]), Gert-Jan van Peer ([[CFO]]), Henry Janssen (CPO), Coert Rasenberg ([[Commercial director|Commercial Director]]) and Jan Schuttrups (Director International). &lt;ref&gt;https://royalbrinkman.nl/contact&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
[[File:Pepersteeg.tif|left|thumb|Building at Pepersteeg 1885]]
Royal Brinkman was founded in 1885 by Cor Brinkman. He started his business at ‘De Pepersteeg’ and visited growers to sell ‘’sparrietouw’’ ( a type of rope used for crates and tarpaulins on Westland barges but also for bundling asparagus ). Later he added ‘’kinnetjesnetten and bollenkinnetjes’’ to his assortment. These ropes were knit to nets in Scheveningen, where Cor Brinkman himself brought them. 
In 1926 Brinkman won 1st prize on the great ‘Fruit and Vegetable exhibition in [[Utrecht]]’ with an electric sorting machine for tomatoes, ‘’de doppenmachine’’. This improved version of the ‘’Brinkman Puncher’’ became a huge success.  
The founders’ son, Henk Brinkman, began hiring personnel. Cor Brinkman started at ‘de Pepersteeg’ (currently Havenstraat) in [['s-Gravenzande|’s-Gravenzande]]. The business grew really fast and moved in 1917 to the Market Place, known as the ‘’Kousenhoek’’. Due to the great success the company had achieved, a new branch was opened in 1931. 

During the [[2nd World War]] Brinkman experienced some serious problems. The 30’s were a difficult period for the horticultural industry. On top of that the building in the Market Place was hit by a fierce fire. The car fleet (3 trucks), wood stock and machinery were lost. Founder Cor Brinkman’s grandson, Henk Brinkman (3rd generation), started as Managing Director in this difficult period. The nazi’s claimed Brinkman’s property in [['s-Gravenzande|’s-Gravenzande]], therefore they were forced to move to the wood factory ‘’In ’t Veld en de Jong’’. This new location in [[De Lier]] was used as headquarters. After a while the seizure ended. 
[[File:Doppenmachine.tif|right|thumb|Sorting machine 'Doppenmachine' 1921]]


During this difficult period Brinkman managed to rebuild everything. The horticultural industry revived after the war because of new growing methods, new crops, automation, irrigation pipes and heating systems. These were glory days for Brinkman. Important developments were the introduction of the Micom 85 [[Horticulture|horticulture]] computer ( advanced computer which controlled the climate in the [[Greenhouse|greenhouse]]) and the switch from soil to {{ill|Horticultural substrate|lt=substrate|nl|Substraat (tuinbouw)}} cultivation. Brinkman initiated the cultivation of [[Tomato|tomatoes]], [[Carnations|carnations]] and [[Gerbera|geberas]] in peat substrate. After that Grodan introduced cultivation on stone wool. Growers experienced a lot of benefits growing above ground, including the prevention of soil diseases, higher revenues, energy savings and surface optimalization. Brinkman developed the Vocom, a computer that is able to dose water and fertilizers properly for the cultivation on substrate. These computers were a big hit in the 70’s and 80’s. 
[[File:Marktplein.tif|right|thumb|Marketplace 1917]]
Brinkman moved in 1972 from ‘’Kousenhoek’’ to the former Auction Hall at the Woutersweg in [['s-Gravenzande|’s-Gravenzande]]. The grand opening of the new 45,000 m² property was a huge milestone for Brinkman and for [[Westland (region), Netherlands|Westland]]. Within five days more than 11,000 guests visited the new property. The headquarters are still located at the Woutersweg. Increasing demands from abroad led to the first branch in [[Burstwick]], near [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] ([[United Kingdom|UK]]) in  1972. Brinkman began exporting in 1930, to the [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref&gt;own archives&lt;/ref&gt;

== Predicate ‘Royal’ ==

On April the 1st 1985, Brinkman received the ‘’Royal’’ predicate. In the name of the Dutch [[Queen Beatrix]], Brinkman received this predicate for it’s 100th anniversary. [[Mies Bouwman]] awarded this Royal predicate to Cor Brinkman and Henk Brinkman. [[Elco Brinkman]], at the time minister of the Dutch Government, congratulated Henk and Cor Brinkman personally (no family connection).

'''Seven Ranges Terminus''' is a stone surveying marker near [[Magnolia, Ohio]] that marks the completion of the first step in opening the lands northwest of the [[Ohio River]] to sale and settlement by [[People of the United States|Americans]]. This survey marked the first application of the rectangular plan for subdividing land.

==History==
With victory in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] granted the [[United States]] lands north of the Ohio River, south of the [[Great Lakes]], and east of the [[Mississippi River]], called the [[Northwest Territory]]. The [[Congress of the Confederation|US Congress]] adopted the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] as a method for surveying, selling and settling these lands. This ordinance established a method for surveying the land into a grid of six mile square [[survey township]]s. These townships were to be arranged into vertical rows called “Ranges”. The first ranges were to be measured from a [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] along the western boundary of [[Pennsylvania]]. The townships in each range were measured from an east-west line called a [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]]. This became the genesis of the techniques used in the [[Public Land Survey System]].

The 1785 ordinance called for the Geographer of the United States, [[Thomas Hutchins]], to personally supervise the first survey.&lt;ref name=officialohio&gt;[http://www.auditor.state.oh.us/Publications/General/OhioLandsBook.pdf#page=10 Auditor of State of Ohio - The Official Ohio Lands Book, pages=10-12]&lt;/ref&gt; It called for Hutchins to establish a [[Beginning Point of the U.S. Public Land Survey|Point of Beginning]] on the north bank of the Ohio River where it leaves Pennsylvania. From there he was to establish a baseline seven ranges wide, (42&amp;nbsp;miles), called the “Geographer’s Line”, and then survey north-south lines each six miles to mark the edges of the ranges, and then establish the south boundary of each township. After each seven ranges had been completed, the Geographer was to return plats to the federal government for marketing and sale.&lt;ref name=ohisub&gt;{{cite book |title=Ohio Lands and Their Subdivisions|last=Peters|first=William E.|year=1918 |publisher=W.E. Peters|pages=65–68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HiApAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutchins, along with prominent surveyors from ten states&lt;ref name=car-har&gt;{{cite book |title=History of Carroll and Harrison Counties |last1=Eckley |first1=H.J. |last2=Perry |first2=W.T. |year=1921 |publisher=The Lewis Publishing Co|page=239|url=http://www.heritagepursuit.com/Harrison}}&lt;/ref&gt; appointed by Congress, began surveying the Geographer's Line in 1785, but stopped after only a few miles because of troubles with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]]. In 1786, with protection of troops from [[Fort Steuben]], Hutchins resumed the survey. In September 1786, Hutchins placed a stone cadastral survey marker at the west edge of the seventh range on the Geographer's Line, a spot later to be known as the '''Seven Ranges Terminus'''. After the first surveyed seven ranges had been completed some years later, the survey tract was known as the [[Seven Ranges]], or '''Old Seven Ranges'''.

==The Survey Marker==
[[Image:Seven Ranges.png|thumb|The Seven Ranges Terminus lies at the northwest corner of the tract in Ohio|250px|left]]
The survey marker&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM4ZRR photos of surveyors marker]&lt;/ref&gt; lies at the corner of four townships, three counties, and three survey tracts:
*[[Rose Township, Carroll County, Ohio]]  Township 16, Range 7 of Old Seven Ranges
*[[Sandy Township, Stark County, Ohio]]  Township 17, Range 7 of [[Congress Lands North of Old Seven Ranges]]
*[[Pike Township, Stark County, Ohio]]  Township 8, Range 8 of Congress Lands North of Old Seven Ranges
*[[Sandy Township, Tuscarawas County, Ohio]]  Township 10, Range 1 of [[United States Military District]]

The marker is property of the federal government, but surrounded by private property. It sits about 288&amp;nbsp;feet to the west of a public road.&lt;ref name=rosehist&gt;{{cite web|title = Rose Township History, p. 3|url = http://carrollcountyohio.com/history/townships/rose/final%20rose%20tp.%20history.pdf#page=3 | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[granite]] [[Cadastre|cadastral survey marker]] is six inches square in cross section with an inscribed X on top, and about a foot protrudes from the ground.&lt;ref name=OHS&gt;{{OHC NRHP|76001527|}}, Ohio Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt; Much more is buried. The [[The Repository|Canton Repository]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://listsearches.rootsweb.com/th/read/OHMUSKIN/2003-08/1060353922]&lt;/ref&gt; said August 7, 2003 that the stone leans somewhat because someone tried to dig it up some years ago, before realizing how deep it is buried. Another plausible reason for lean would be two centuries of frost heave.

The '''Seven Ranges Terminus''' was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1976 for its association with the historic significance of Thomas Hutchins.

[[Singapore]] is on the north of the [[Channel (geography)|channel]] and the [[Riau Archipelago|Riau Islands]] are on the south. The [[Indonesia-Singapore border]] lies along the length of the strait.

It includes [[Keppel Harbour]] and many small islands. The strait provides the deepwater passage to the [[Port of Singapore]], which makes it very busy. Approximately 2,000 merchant ships traverse the waters on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Navy Times]] |date=August 22, 2017 |quote=Around 2,000 merchant ships travel in the area every day, Tan estimated. |title=Busy waters around Singapore carry a host of hazards |first=Annabelle |last=Liang |first2=Wong |last2=Maye-E |url=http://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2017/08/22/busy-waters-around-singapore-carry-a-host-of-hazards/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depth of the Singapore Strait limits the maximum [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of vessels going through the Straits of Malacca, and the [[Malaccamax]] ship class.

The 9th century AD [[Muslim]] author [[Ya'qubi]] referred a ''Bahr Salahit'' or Sea of Salahit (from the Malay ''selat'' meaning strait), one of the [[Seven Seas]] to be traversed to reach China. Some have interpreted Sea of Salahit as referring to Singapore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.melayuonline.com/?a=bUwvaUpTL0lMeTRVYzY%3D= |title=Tumasik Kingdom |work=Melayu Online |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312083103/http://history.melayuonline.com/?a=bUwvaUpTL0lMeTRVYzY%3D%3D |archivedate=12 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although others generally considered it the [[Malacca Strait]], a point of contact between the Arabs and the [[Zabag kingdom|Zābaj]] (likely Sumatra).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-AdJrE5RDvYC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Between East and West: The Moluccas and the Traffic in Spices Up to the Arrival of Europeans |author= R.

[[Mozambique]] is divided into ten [[province]]s (''provincias'') and one capital city (''cidade capital'') with provincial status. The provinces are subdivided into 129 [[district]]s (''distritos''). The districts are further divided in 405 "Postos Administrativos" (Administrative Posts) and then into Localidades (Localities), the lowest geographical level of the central state administration. Since 1998, 33 "Municípios" (Municipalities) have been created in Mozambique.

The [[List of country calling codes|country calling code]] of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is '''+387'''.

[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] received the +387 code following the breakup of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1992. (which had +38 as the country code).

An example for calling telephones in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is as follows:

* 0 33 xxx xxx (within Sarajevo)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mtel.ba/Korisnicka-zona/Vijesti/Vijesti/a491-Besplatne-izmjene-pozivanja-u-fiksnoj-telefoniji.html|title=Besplatne izmjene pozivanja u fiksnoj telefoniji|last=|first=|date=|work=m:tel|access-date=2018-01-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 0 33 xxx xxx (within Bosnia and Herzegovina)
* +387 33 xxx xxx (outside of Bosnia and Herzegovina)

This is a '''list of dialing codes in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'''.

== History ==

Bosnia and Herzegovina once was a part of [[Yugoslavia]]. While the international prefix for Yugoslavia was +38, places in Bosnia and Herzegovina were assigned phonecodes (and [[postcode]]s) beginning with 7 and 8. If the phonecode of a city was 0xx, the appropriate postcode was xx000. These postcodes are still valid.

''Note: the codes listed below are now all obsolete. However, they are still used at times to identify places in Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly 071 (Sarajevo), 078 (Banja Luka) and 075 (Tuzla).''

'''Theodor Capidan''' ({{OldStyleDate|April 28|1879|April 15}}&amp;ndash;September 1, 1953) was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-born [[Romania]]n linguist. An ethnic [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] from the [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia region]], he studied at Leipzig before teaching school at Thessaloniki. Following the creation of [[Greater Romania]] at the end of World War I, Capidan followed his friend [[Sextil Pușcariu]] to the [[Transylvania]]n capital [[Cluj]], where he spent nearly two decades, the most productive part of his career. He then taught in [[Bucharest]] for a further ten years and was marginalized late in life under the nascent [[Communist Romania|communist regime]]. Capidan's major contributions involve studies of the Aromanians and the [[Megleno-Romanians]], as well as their respective languages. His research extended to reciprocal influences between Romanian and the surrounding Slavic languages, the [[Eastern Romance substratum]] and the [[Balkan sprachbund]], as well as toponymy. He made a significant contribution to projects for a Romanian-language dictionary and atlas.

==Biography==
===Origins and early career===
He was born into an [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] family in [[Prilep]], a town that formed part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Manastir Vilayet]] and is now in the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. His parents were the tailor Teohari Capidan and his wife Eugenia Vreta. After attending primary school in his native town, he followed his elder brother Pericle, a future painter, in emigrating to the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]]. Slated to become a [[Romanian Orthodox]] priest, he studied at the central seminary in [[Bucharest]], but decided he had a different vocation and left in order to pursue a teaching career. Capidan returned to Macedonia, where he was hired at the Romanian high school in [[Bitola]] and displayed talent in teaching Romanian and German. With the help of the Romanian consul, he obtained a scholarship that allowed him to study Romance philology at [[Leipzig University]] from 1904 to 1908.&lt;ref name="t100"/&gt; His professors included [[Karl Brugmann]], [[Gustav Weigand]], [[August Leskien]], [[Eduard Sievers]] and [[Wilhelm Wundt]].&lt;ref name="t100"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pop, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; His thesis, awarded ''cum laude'', dealt with Aromanian linguistics. While a student, Capidan published his first works on Aromanian dialectology and cultural history.&lt;ref name="t100"/&gt; After graduating and until 1909, he served as assistant at Weigand's Balkan Institute.&lt;ref name="t100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="p222"&gt;Pop, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, he met and began a lifelong friendship with [[Sextil Pușcariu]], who, after putting him through a three-month trial period in [[Czernowitz]], invited the student to help with his Romanian-language dictionary project.&lt;ref name="t100"&gt;Tanașoca, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p2212"&gt;Pop, pp. 221-22&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, he was named Romanian language professor at the Romanian Higher School of Commerce in [[Thessaloniki]]. The following year, he became director of an institution he transformed into an exemplary place of learning, preparing not just economists but also students with an aptitude for science and literature. Capidan was at the school until 1919, and used this period for research. He gathered dialectal, linguistic and folkloric material for future studies, undertook fieldwork and also used as subjects his students, Aromanians and [[Megleno-Romanians]] who came from throughout the Balkan peninsula. He wrote studies of linguistics and ethnography, and collaborated on Pușcariu's dictionary. In 1909, he penned a reply in French to those who questioned whether the Aromanian language is Romance in origin and character. Titled ''Réponse critique au Dictionnaire d'étymologie koutzovalaque de Constantin Nicolaïdi'', it features both an argument based on science and a satirical flourish. This paved the way for other polemical writings in which he Aromanians' Romance character.&lt;ref name="t101"&gt;Tanașoca, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cluj years and move to Bucharest===
During World War I, in common with the majority of Aromanian intellectuals in Macedonia, Capidan entered the Thessaloniki-headquartered [[Armée d'Orient (1915–19)|Armée d'Orient]] as a volunteer. After the war and the [[union of Transylvania with Romania]], he was invited by Pușcariu to help place the new [[Babeș-Bolyai University|Superior Dacia University]] in [[Cluj]] on a solid foundation.&lt;ref name="t1012"/&gt; From 1919 to 1924, he was associate professor in the Romanian language and dialectology department, lecturing on Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian. From 1924 to 1937, he was full professor of sub-Danubian dialectology and general linguistics.&lt;ref name="t1012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="p222"/&gt; The Cluj years were the most productive and happiest of his life. He was among the most important representatives within the school of linguistics that centered around Pușcariu. He worked diligently at the [[Museum of the Romanian Language]] and was a consistent contributor to its journal, ''Dacoromania''. He continued to provide input on the dictionary as well as on the ''Romanian Linguistic Atlas''.&lt;ref name="t1012"/&gt;

His contribution to the dictionary involved an enormous sacrifice of time and energy; the work was exigent and tiresome. Pușcariu recalled how his colleague, together with [[Constantin Lacea]], would sit daily in front of files for three or four hours, more than once ripping apart an article on which they had worked for a week and restarting in a more logical fashion. Regarding the linguistic atlas, his assistance to [[Sever Pop]] involved material on the Aromanians and the Megleno-Romanians.&lt;ref name="p229"/&gt; The favorable intellectual climate in Cluj fostered his seminal works on the Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians, establishing him as an authority in the field. Elected a corresponding member of the [[Romanian Academy]] in 1928, he was elevated to titular status in 1935. His maiden speech, on the Balkan Romance peoples, was followed by a warm welcome from Pușcariu.&lt;ref name="t1012"&gt;Tanașoca, pp. 101-02&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Capidan was invited to the [[University of Bucharest]], where he was made head of the comparative philology department heretofore led by the late [[Iuliu Valaori]]. He remained there until 1947, when he was obliged to retire. Extending his scientific interests into a wider field, he used his knowledge of linguistics and of the Balkan languages to emerge as a researcher with original views in the comparative study of the Indo-European languages. He also spurred development of the area among Romanian academics. He relaunched the [[Thracology|Thracological]] studies of [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], employing more modern methods. He published a critical and historical study of Hasdeu, placing him in the context of the development of Romanian linguistics and philology and championing his merits as an Indo-Europeanist. For years, his laudatory view of Hasdeu retained a definitive status in regard to this sphere of his activity. Capidan held a special course on [[Thracian language|Thraco]]-[[Phrygian language|Phrygian]], later turning the material into a study on guttural occlusives in Thracian. He also published a series of etymological notes on the extinct language in the bulletin of the Academy's literary section, which he co-edited with his friend [[Dumitru Caracostea]]. He collaborated closely with [[Victor Papacostea]] at the latter's Institute of Balkan Studies, and in editing ''Balcania'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Tanașoca, pp. 102-03&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Papacostea and [[George Murnu]], he published ''Revista macedo-română''.&lt;ref name="p229"/&gt;

In 1948, the new [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] [[List of purged members of the Romanian Academy|stripped him of Academy membership]] after Capidan refused to sign an adulatory telegram for [[Joseph Stalin]]. However, upon the intervention of [[Iorgu Iordan]], he was allowed to continue working on the dictionary as an outside collaborator with the Linguistics Institute.&lt;ref name="t103"/&gt; Still involved with the project until his last months, when weakening vision forced him to abandon it,&lt;ref name="p2212"/&gt;&lt;ref name="t103"/&gt; he died in 1953. In accordance with his wishes, [[Cremation in Romania|was cremated]] in a simple ceremony.&lt;ref name="t103"&gt;Tanașoca, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Capidan was married to Iulia George Dan, a housewife. The couple's only child, Emil, was born in 1912 and studied literature and philosophy at Cluj.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p. 187, 302, 492&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
===Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian language and society===
Capidan's research interests focused on the realities of the sub-Danubian Romance peoples, the Aromanians and the Megleno-Romanians. He published numerous articles and studies on the subject, culminating in two valuable monographs that have been called classics of the field.&lt;ref&gt;Pop, pp. 222-23&lt;/ref&gt; His writing on linguistics combines a rich linguistic analysis with geographic, historical and socio-cultural facts about the peoples he studied, looking at their lifestyle and ethnographic profile.&lt;ref&gt;Pop, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; He helped resolve the controversy over where their ethnogenesis took place. By looking at certain linguistic peculiarities, he concluded that the proto-Romanian language was divided into two zones. One was the northern, which developed into [[Romanian language|Daco-Romanian]] (from which [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]] later split); and the southern, which subsequently became differentiated into Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian.&lt;ref&gt;Pop, pp. 223-24&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he defended the notion of Megleno-Romanian as a separate dialect, noting the existence of nearly forty fundamental differences with Aromanian.&lt;ref name="p224"&gt;Pop, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Employing findings drawn from fieldwork, Capidan made observations about the bilingualism or even multilingualism of the sub-Danubian Romance peoples, and was the first Romanian scholar to study this phenomenon systematically.&lt;ref name="p226"/&gt; He classified bilingualism into two types: natural or unconscious, and deliberate or scholarly. He discussed the causes, evolution and implications of bilingualism, discovering evidence of [[linguistic interference]], the first step toward the dialects' convergence and ultimate disappearance.&lt;ref name="p227"&gt;Pop, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balkan language theories===
Fluent not only in these two Romance languages, but also in Bulgarian, Greek, Albanian and Turkish, he studied the relationship between Romanian and the Balkan languages. Within this context, he addressed the issue of the [[Eastern Romance substratum]]. Initially, he believed that only a small part of the common features displayed by Romanian and Albanian were due to a shared native element, attributing the great majority of links to a reciprocal influence. He later radically changed position, asserting that these commonalities were mainly due to a joint pre-Roman lineage. Capidan argued that the substrate's influence was visible not only at the lexical level, but also in phonetics and morphology. He noted that a part of the substrate elements extant in Daco-Romanian are absent south of the Danube.&lt;ref name="p224"/&gt;

Capidan studied various issues relating to linguistic and cultural ties between Romanians and Slavs. He argued that Old Slavic influence on Romanian began at some point in the 8th or 9th century, and that most of this influence came from Bulgarian, while a part was Serbian. Analyzing the common Slavic lexicon of Daco-Romanian, Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian, he found 72 such terms. However, he noted that the latter two languages may have absorbed a part of these from Albanian or Greek at a later date, after splitting off from proto-Romanian.&lt;ref&gt;Pop, pp. 224-25&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Capidan was the first linguist who undertook a systematic study of Romanian's influence on the South Slavic languages. Although his comments on Serbian were limited to a few observations, he wrote an ample study with regard to Bulgarian.&lt;ref&gt;Pop, pp. 225-26&lt;/ref&gt;

Although his original contributions regarding the [[Balkan sprachbund]] were few, he and Pușcariu were among those who laid the foundation for strictly scientific research into cultural and linguistic relations among the Balkan peoples. Capidan believed that the region's languages shared certain words pertaining to a common civilization, remarkably similar in their semantic evolution, as well as common traits in phraseology and proverbs. However, he thought that their morphological construction was more divergent. Thus, while initially embracing the sprachbund idea, he eventually came to reject the idea of a linguistic union comparable to the Romance or Germanic languages, as well as an approach that studied the Balkan languages as being related.&lt;ref name="p226"&gt;Pop, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toponymy===
Capidan was interested in toponymy, particularly south of the Danube. During his Leipzig days, he delivered a report on the Slavic place names of Thessaly and Epirus.&lt;ref name="p227"/&gt; Over the years, he offered etymological explanations for a large number of place names. He used several of these to argue for the idea that certain Aromanians were native to Greece, basing the theory on their phonetic transformations found only in the Latin elements of Romanian. Other names helped determine their inhabitants' occupation, leading him to conclude that the Megleno-Romanians' involvement with sheepherding was as extensive as their agricultural work.&lt;ref&gt;Pop, pp. 227-28&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later years, Capidan published the first book on Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian toponymy, as well as a Romanian toponymic dictionary. The latter work included an important finding on rural Geto-Dacian toponymy: that place names, usually four-syllabled, were composed of a variable ''determinant'' and an invariable ''determined element''. The invariable portion was ''-[[Dava (Dacian)|dava]]'' in Geto-Dacian and ''-para'' in Thracian south of the Danube. Capidan was the first to attempt to explain why the two differed, somewhat anomalously since the Geto-Dacians and the Thracians spoke the same language. He proposed that the difference lay in the physical characteristics of the land occupied by the two groups. Drawing on Indo-European roots, he indicated that the suffix ''-para'' suggests a ford, crossing or path, and is suitable to Thracian settlements, typically found in valleys, along roads and paths.&lt;ref name="p229"&gt;Pop, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, ''-dava'' refers to settlements or villages. This arose out of the Geto-Dacians' main occupation as farmers, their villages scattered among fields. Capidan asserted that they felt the need to name these placed with a term meaning, simply, "settlement".&lt;ref&gt;Pop, pp. 228-29&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7345">'''Ubigeo''' is the coding system for geographical locations ([[Spanish language|Spanish:]] ''Código Ubicacíon Geográfica'') in [[Peru]] used by the National Statistics and Computing Institute ([[Spanish language|Spanish:]] ''Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática'' [[INEI]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inei.gob.pe/ {{es}} Official web site of the ''INEI'' institute]&lt;/ref&gt;) to code the first-level administrative subdivision: [[Administrative divisions of Peru|regions]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish:]] ''regiones'', singular: ''región''), the second-level administrative subdivision: [[Provinces of Peru|provinces]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish:]] ''provincias'', singular: ''provincia'') and the third-level administrative subdivision: [[Districts of Peru|districts]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish:]] ''distritos'', singular: ''distrito'').

==Syntax==
The coding system uses two-digit numbers for each level of subdivision. The first level starts numbering at &lt;code&gt;01&lt;/code&gt; for the [[Amazonas Region]] and continues in alphabetical order up to &lt;code&gt;25&lt;/code&gt; for the [[Ucayali Region]]. Additional regions will be added to the end of the list, starting with the first available number.

The second level starts with &lt;code&gt;0101&lt;/code&gt; for the first province in the Amazonas region: [[Chachapoyas Province]] and continues up to &lt;code&gt;2504&lt;/code&gt; for the last province [[Purús Province|Purús]] in the [[Ucayali Region]]. The provinces are numbered per region with the first province always being the one in which the regions capital is located. The remaining provinces are coded in alphabetical order. Additional provinces will be added per region to the end of the list, starting with the first available province number.

The third level; starts with &lt;code&gt;010101&lt;/code&gt; for the first district in the first province in the Amazonas region: [[Chachapoyas District]] and continues up to &lt;code&gt;250401&lt;/code&gt; for the last district in the last province of the Ucayali region: [[Purús District]]. The districts are numbered per province with the first district always being the one in which the province’ capital is located. The remaining districts are coded in alphabetical order. Additional districts will be added per province to the end of the list, starting with the first available district number.

==Examples==

===Regions===
*&lt;code&gt;01&lt;/code&gt; [[Amazonas Region]]
*&lt;code&gt;02&lt;/code&gt; [[Ancash Region]]

'''UK-DMC 2''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] Earth imaging [[satellite]] which is operated by [[DMC International Imaging]].&lt;ref name="DNL"/&gt; It was constructed by [[Surrey Satellite Technology]], based on the SSTL-100 satellite bus.&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/uk-dmc-2.htm|title=UK-DMC 2|last=Krebs|first=Gunter|publisher=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DNL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmcii.com/pdf/DMCii_newsletter_Aug2009.pdf|title=DMCii Newsletter|last=DMCii|publisher=DMCii|accessdate=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of Britain's contribution to the [[Disaster Monitoring Constellation]], which is coordinated by [[DMC International Imaging]]. It is the successor to the [[UK-DMC|UK-DMC satellite]].

==Mission==
UK DMC-2 was launched into a [[sun-synchronous orbit|sun-synchronous]] [[low Earth orbit]]. The launch was conducted by [[ISC Kosmotras]], using a [[Dnepr (rocket)|Dnepr]] [[carrier rocket]], with [[DubaiSat-1]] being the primary payload. UK-DMC 2, along with the [[Deimos-1]], [[Nanosat 1B]], AprizeSat-3 and AprizeSat-4 satellites, were the rocket's secondary payload. The launch occurred at 18:46 GMT on 29 July 2009, with the rocket lifting off from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 109|Site 109/95]] at the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in [[Kazakhstan]].

The satellite has a mass of {{convert|120|kg}}&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; and a design life of five years. It carries a multi-spectral imager with a resolution of {{convert|22|m}} and {{convert|660|km}} of swath,&lt;ref name="SSTL2"&gt;[http://www.sstl.co.uk/missions/uk-dmc-2--launched-2009/uk-dmc-2/uk-dmc-2--the-mission SSTL Mission Page]&lt;/ref&gt; operating in green, red and near infrared spectra.

The satellite is also known as ''[[Blue Peter]] 1,'' and its construction and launch were followed by children's television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nerc.ac.uk/press/briefings/2009/05-bluepeter.asp Kids in Space], NERC press release, 31 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Italian Africa (1913-1941) ==

The very first Italian registration plates, from 1913 to the end of the 1920s, were rectangular, with a white background and with the name or initials of the colony in red followed by the registration number, on a single line, but the documentation on this is fragmentary. For the Italian colonial troops, however, special military service plates were used with the initials SOM (Somalia) or T (Tripolitania) in front.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.targheitaliane.it/index_i.html?/italy/colonie/aoi_i.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsequently, until 1935, the Italian colonies used white plates on black with a [[Vehicle registration plates of Italy#Province codes 1927 to present day|colonial code]] on the first line, and up to 5 numbers on the second line. The numbers, in relief, were assigned serially and the plates were made of metal, with the [[fasces]] as a seal. The colonial codes were:

*ERITREA, later ER for [[Eritrea]]
*SOMALIA, later SOM for [[Somalia]]
*TRIPOLI for [[Italian Tripolitania|Tripolitania]]
*CNA for [[Italian Cyrenaica|Cyrenaica]]

Between 1937 and 1941 there was an Italian governorate in Ethiopia and in those years a new type of Italian license plate was issued. They were exactly the same as the previous ones, but they had three squares on the left, colored top to bottom green, white and red, like the [[Italian flag]], with the letters AOI (''Africa Orientale Italiana'') for [[Italian East Africa]] inside. The front plates resembled standard Italian front license plates, as these were smaller, and only sometimes had the colored squares like the rear license plates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.targheetarghe.it/it-it/p/29/escursioni-esteri&lt;/ref&gt; The abbreviations used to indicate the origin are:
*AA for [[Addis Ababa]]
*AM for [[Amhara Governorate|Amara]]
*ER for [[Eritrea Governorate|Eritrea]]
*GS for [[Galla-Sidamo Governorate|Galla e Sidama]]
*HA for [[Harrar Governorate|Harrar]]
*SC for [[Shewa Governorate|Scioà]]
*SOM for [[Somalia Governorate|Somalia]]

[[File:William J Watson.PNG|thumb|right|upright]]
'''William J. Watson''' (1865–1948) was a [[toponymist]], one of the greatest [[Scotland|Scottish]] scholars of the 20th century, and was the first scholar to place the study of [[Scottish place names]] on a firm linguistic basis.

Watson was a native [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]]-speaker, born in Milntown of New Tarbat (now known as [[Milton, Easter Ross|Milton]]), [[Easter Ross]]. He was the son of Hugh Watson, a [[blacksmith]]. He received his initial education from his uncle, James Watson. William became well grounded in Gaelic studies and the [[Classics]]. He went to the [[University of Aberdeen]] and the [[University of Oxford]].

First a school teacher in [[Glasgow]], [[Inverness]] and then [[Royal High School, Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], it was while teaching in Inverness that he began to contribute to the ''Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness'' and the ''Celtic Review''. He married Ella Carmichael daughter of [[Alexander Carmichael]]. He took the chair of Celtic at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1914, despite holding no prior university position. He remained in this prestigious position until making way for his son [[James Carmichael Watson]] in 1938. William died aged 83 on 9 March 1948.

He is best known for his ''The Celtic Place-names of Scotland'' (1926), based on 30 years of work. Watson's work, eight decades later, is still the primary scholarly reference guide on the subject. The book is based on extensive notes taken by Watson, which are unpublished and held by the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Watson's great work was recently republished by ''Birlinn'' (2004).
