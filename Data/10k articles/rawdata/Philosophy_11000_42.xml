'''Manuel Rubén Abimael Guzmán Reynoso''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|uː|z|m|ɑː|n}}; {{IPA-es|maˈnwel ruˈβen aβimaˈel ɡuzˈman reiˈnoso|am}}; born 3 December 1934), also known by the [[nom de guerre]] '''Chairman Gonzalo''' ({{lang-es|Presidente Gonzalo}}), is the former leader of the [[Shining Path]] during the [[Maoism|Maoist]] [[insurgency]] known as the [[internal conflict in Peru]]. He was captured by the Peruvian government in 1992 and sentenced to life imprisonment for [[terrorism]] and [[treason]].

In the 1960s and 1970s Guzmán was a [[professor]] of [[philosophy]] active in left-wing politics and strongly influenced by [[Marxism]] and [[Maoism]]. He developed an ideology of armed struggle stressing the empowerment of the indigenous people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/14/world/blow-to-rebels-in-peru-an-elusive-aura-is-lost.html|title=Blow to Rebels in Peru: An Elusive Aura Is Lost|last=Nash|first=Nathaniel C.|date=1992-09-14|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went underground in the mid 1970s to become the sometimes idolized and mythical leader of the Shining Path movement, which began what it called "the armed struggle" on 17 May 1980. 

While the activity of the insurgency increased shortly after Guzmán's capture,{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} it has declined in the years following. The movement has been criticized for its violence against [[peasant]]s, [[trade union]] organizers, and elected officials, which were deemed by the group to be collaborating with the Peruvian state. Shining Path is on the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]]'s "Designated [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|Foreign Terrorist Organizations]]" list.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of State, "Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs)" 11 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2007/l_169/l_16920070629en00580062.pdf European Council Decision. 2007/445/EC of 28 June 2007], ''Official Journal of the European Union.'' 29.6.2007&lt;/ref&gt; and Peru likewise describe Shining Path as a [[Terrorism|terrorist]] group and it prohibits its citizens from providing funds or other forms of financial support to the group.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

== Early life ==
Guzmán was born in the village of Tambo near [[Mollendo]], a port town in the province of [[Islay Province|Islay]], in the region of [[Arequipa region|Arequipa]], about {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Lima. He was the illegitimate son of a well-off merchant, the winner of the national [[lottery]] who had six children by three different women. Guzmán's mother, Berenice Reynoso, died when he was only five years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I_jh4VBi_HYC&amp;pg=PA520&amp;lpg=PA520&amp;dq=Berenice+Reynoso+Guzman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Xb5lSyUGJd&amp;sig=kZ3AjoyfjEfygFdh9X8UJ8mPhtw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjHrqiq3IHeAhUR1xoKHWJfDwsQ6AEwFHoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Berenice%20Reynoso%20Guzman&amp;f=false|title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Terrorism, Second Edition|last=Martin|first=Gus|date=2011-06-15|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412980166|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1939 to 1946 Guzmán lived with his mother's family. After 1947 he lived with his father and his father's wife in the city of [[Arequipa]], where he studied at Colegio De La Salle, a private [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] secondary school. At the age of 19 he became a student at the Social Studies department of [[Universidad Nacional de San Agustín de Arequipa|San Agustín National University]], in Arequipa. His classmates at the university later described him as shy, disciplined, obsessive, and ascetic. Increasingly attracted by [[Marxism]], his political thinking was influenced by the book ''Seven Essays on the Interpretation of the Peruvian Reality'' of [[José Carlos Mariátegui]], the founder of the [[Peruvian Communist Party|Communist Party of Peru]].

{{Maoism sidebar}}
At Arequipa, Guzmán completed bachelor's degrees in philosophy and [[law]]. His dissertations were entitled ''The Kantian Theory of Space'' and ''The Bourgeois Democratic State''. In 1962, Guzmán was recruited as a professor of philosophy by the rector of [[San Cristóbal of Huamanga University]] in [[Ayacucho]], a city in the central Peruvian [[Andes]]. The rector was Dr. [[Efraín Morote|Efraín Morote Best]], an [[anthropology|anthropologist]] who some believe later became the true intellectual leader of the "Shining Path movement." Encouraged by Morote, Guzmán studied [[Quechua language|Quechua]], the language spoken by Peru's indigenous population, and became increasingly active in [[left-wing]] political circles. He attracted several like-minded young academics committed to bringing about revolution in Peru. Guzmán was arrested twice during the 1970s because of his participation in violent riots in the city of Arequipa against the government of presidents [[Velasco Alvarado]] and [[Belaunde Terry]]. He visited the [[People's Republic of China]] with his wife Augusta La Torre for the first time in 1965. After serving as the head of personnel for [[San Cristóbal of Huamanga University]], Guzmán left the institution in the mid-1970s and went underground.

In the 1960s, the Peruvian Communist Party had splintered over ideological and personal disputes.  Guzmán, who had taken a pro-Chinese rather than pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] line, emerged as the leader of the faction which came to be known as the "Shining Path" ([[José Carlos Mariátegui|Mariátegui]] wrote once: "Marxism–Leninism is the shining path of the future"{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}). Guzmán adopted the ''[[nom de guerre]]'' Presidente or Comrade Gonzalo and began advocating a peasant-led revolution on the Maoist model. His followers declared Guzmán, who cultivated anonymity, to be the "Fourth Sword of Communism" (after [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], and [[Mao Zedong|Mao]]). In his political declarations, Guzmán praised Mao's development of Lenin's thesis regarding "the role of [[imperialism]]" in propping up the "bourgeois [[capitalism|capitalist]] system". He claimed that imperialism ultimately "creates disruption and is unsuccessful, and it will end up in ruins in the next 50 to 100 years". Guzmán applied this criticism not only to [[United States|U.S.]] imperialism, but also Soviet imperialism, to what he termed as "social-imperialism".

In February 1964 he married [[Augusta la Torre]], who was instrumental in founding Sendero Illuminoso,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libcom.org/history/women%25E2%2580%2599s-popular-movement-shining-path-contradictions-patriarchal-women%25E2%2580%2599s-emancipation|title=Women’s popular movement and the Shining Path: The contradictions of patriarchal women's emancipation|website=libcom.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laht.com/article.asp?CategoryId=14095&amp;ArticleId=200941 "Bloody Peruvian terrorist also had fuzzy side"], ''Latin American Herald Tribune'', 2008, retrieved 06-01-2009&lt;/ref&gt; who died under unclear circumstances in 1988. It has been rumored that she was murdered by [[Elena Iparraguirre]], Guzmán's lover, with his complicity. Both have refused to talk about La Torre's fate since their imprisonment. In the fall of 2006, while in prison, Guzmán proposed to Iparraguirre, one of his long-time lieutenants who is also serving a life sentence in a separate prison. After fighting for the permission to marry with a [[hunger strike]], the couple wed in late August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11045251|title=Peru's Shining Path rebel leaders marry|date=20 August 2010|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About his religion, Guzmán has always been an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://exitosanoticias.pe/crespo-abimael-se-ha-planteado-asumir-responsabilidad-politica/|title=¿Indulto para líder de SL? - Crespo: Abimael se ha planteado asumir su responsabilidad política|date=27 December 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He agreed with [[Karl Marx]] about religion as the [[Opium of the people|"opium of the people"]], and viewed it as a "social phenomena product of the exploitation and that will extinguish while exploitation finishes to be swept and a new society arise". However, he pleaded respect for religious diversity and claimed religion would not be an obstacle for the armed struggle. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solrojo.org/pcp_doc/pcp_0688.htm|title=Entrevista al Presidente Gonzalo|website=www.solrojo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War==

The Shining Path movement was at first largely confined to academic circles in Peruvian universities. In the late 1970s, however, the movement developed into a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] group centered around [[Ayacucho]]. In May 1980, the group launched its war against the government of Peru by burning the ballot boxes in [[Chuschi]], a village near Ayacucho, in an effort to disrupt the first democratic elections in the country since 1964. Shining Path eventually grew to control vast rural territories in central and southern Peru and achieved a presence even in the outskirts of [[Lima]], where it staged numerous attacks. The purpose of Shining Path's campaign was to demoralize and undermine the government of Peru in order to create a situation conducive to a violent coup which would put its leaders in power. The Shining Path targeted not only the army and police, but also government employees at all levels, other leftist militants such as members of the [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] (MRTA), workers who did not participate in the strikes organized by the group, peasants who cooperated with the government in any way (including by voting in democratic elections), and ordinary middle-class inhabitants of Peru's main cities. The [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Peru)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] later estimated that the resulting conflict led to the deaths of some seventy thousand people, approximately half of them at the hands of the Shining Path and a third at the hands of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://peru.com/noticias/idocs/2003/8/29/DetalleDocumento_97139.asp LOS NÚMEROS DE LA VIOLENCIA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041023020521/http://peru.com/noticias/idocs/2003/8/29/DetalleDocumento_97139.asp |date=October 23, 2004 }}, 29 August 2003, peru.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially Guzmán attempted to win over the support of citizens by punishing people they viewed as corrupt government officials and other unpopular leaders. However, Shining Path's increasingly brutal methods together with strictly imposed curfews, the prohibition of alcohol and an overall sense of insecurity and fear led to an increased popular reaction against the communist party.  Eventually Guzmán's plan backfired as rural militia or "[[Ronda Campesina|rondas]]" rallied support for the military against Shining Path. The very peasants Guzmán claimed to defend had turned against the Shining Path. This resulted in a cyclical state of violence in which Maoist guerillas embarked in ruthless punitive expeditions against Peruvian civilians living in the Andean region. In 1983, 69 people (including women and children) from the highland town of [[Lucanamarca]] were tortured and murdered by the Shining Path in what became known as the [[Lucanamarca massacre]].

Guzmán's image as a dispassionate murderer became widespread after he moved against the city of Lima. After a series of bombings and selective assassinations the whole nation was shocked in 1992 when a car bomb exploded in one of Lima's busiest commercial districts on Tarata street, thus causing many casualties and enormous material losses. To this day, Guzmán denies responsibility{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} for the [[Tarata bombing]] by claiming that it was a "deplorable mistake."

The movement promoted the writings of Guzmán, called ''[[Gonzalo Thought]]'', a new "theoretical understanding" that built upon [[Marxism]], [[Leninism]], and [[Maoism]] whereby he declared Maoism to be a "third and higher stage of Marxism," having defined Maoism as "people's war."  In 1989, Guzmán declared that the Shining Path (which he referred to as the "Communist Party of Peru") had progressed from waging a people's war to waging a "war of movements."  He further argued that this was a step towards achieving "strategic equilibrium" in the near future, based on Maoist theories of waging people's war. Guzmán claimed that such an equilibrium would manifest itself by ungovernability under the "old order." When that moment arrived, Guzmán believed that Shining Path would be ready to move on to its "strategic offensive".

[[Theodore Dalrymple]] an English right-wing intellectual has written that "the worst brutality I ever saw was that committed by Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) in Peru, in the days when it seemed possible that it might come to power. If it had, I think its massacres would have dwarfed those of the [[Khmer Rouge]]. As a doctor, I am accustomed to unpleasant sights, but nothing prepared me for what I saw in Ayacucho, where Sendero first developed under the sway of a professor of philosophy, Abimael Guzmán."&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Dalrymple]], [http://www.newenglishreview.org/custpage.cfm?frm=3895&amp;sec_id=3895 The Realities of Evil], ''[[New English Review]]'', September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capture ==
In 1992, during the first administration of President [[Alberto Fujimori]], the [[National Directorate Against Terrorism]] (DIRCOTE) began casing several residences in [[Lima]] because agents suspected that terrorists were using them as safehouses. One of those residences, in the upper-class neighborhood of [[Santiago de Surco|Surco]], had been operating as a ballet studio. The DIRCOTE operatives routinely searched the garbage taken out from the house. The house was supposedly inhabited by only one person, the dance teacher [[Maritza Garrido Lecca]], but it was soon noticed that the household produced more garbage than one person could account for.  Furthermore, agents found discarded tubes of cream for the treatment of [[psoriasis]], an ailment that Guzmán was known to have.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/peru/1500057/Ballerina-hid-brutal-terrorist-chief.html|title=Ballerina hid brutal terrorist chief|last=McDermott|first=Jeremy|date=2005-10-05|work=The Telegraph|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 12, 1992, an elite unit of the DIRCOTE raided the Surco residence. On the second floor of the house, they found and arrested Guzmán and eight others, including Laura Zambrano and Elena Iparraguirre, Guzmán's female companion.

At the time of capture, the police seized Guzmán's computer, in which they found a very detailed register of his armed forces and the weapons each regiment, militia and support base had in each region of the country. Guzmán had recorded that, in 1990, the Shining Path had 23,430 members armed with approximately 235 [[revolvers]], 500 [[rifles]] and 300 other items of military hardware such as [[grenade]]s. The Shining Path remained active after Guzman's arrest.

== Trials and imprisonment ==
Guzmán was tried by a court of hooded military judges under provisions of articles 15 and 16 of Law 25475 adopted by Fujimori's government in May 1992 after [[1992 Peruvian constitutional crisis|April's constitutional crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gafisud.info/documentos/eng/base/Peru/003-Ley%2025475%20-%20Ley%20de%20Terrorismo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this was to protect the judges' lives, as Shining Path was known for brutal retaliation against judges who convicted their members. After a three-day trial, Guzmán was sentenced to life imprisonment and incarcerated at the naval base on the island of [[San Lorenzo Island, Peru|San Lorenzo]] off the coast of Lima.&lt;ref name="sdpnoticias.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdpnoticias.com/notas/2012/02/28/alberga-prision-peruana-a-ex-lideres-rebeldes-y-a-montesinos|title=Alberga prisión peruana a ex líderes rebeldes y a Montesinos|publisher=|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, he is said to have negotiated with a presidential advisor at the time, [[Vladimiro Montesinos]], in order to receive some benefits in exchange for helping the Peruvian government put an end to the Shining Path's militant activities. Guzmán appeared several times on Peruvian television and on October 1, 1993, he publicly declared "peace" with the Peruvian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/10/14/internacional/1160796742.html |title=Historia de la lucha armada de Sendero Luminoso en Perú |publisher=elmundo.es |date=2006-10-14 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration split the Shining Path and raised questions about the organization's future. About 6,000 guerrillas within the party accepted it as a sign of defeat and surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3985659.stm |title=Profile: Peru's Shining Path |accessdate=2008-10-08 |publisher=BBC |date=2005-11-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081016043251/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3985659.stm| archivedate= 16 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others held that it was either a forgery or an insincere statement made under duress.

[[File:Guzman_Iparraguirre_2004.jpg|thumb|right|Abimael Guzmán (right) and [[Elena Iparraguirre]] at their second trial in 2004]]
Although there is little doubt that Guzmán was indeed the leader of the Shining Path, more than 5,000 individuals presented an appeal to Peru's Constitutional Court in 2003 asking that the verdicts against more than 1,800 prisoners convicted of terrorism, including Guzmán, be voided. The court agreed, declaring that the military trials had been unconstitutional and ordering new trials before civilian courts. The new trials began in 2003. Since then, more than 400 prisoners who had been found guilty by military courts have been freed.

Guzmán's re-trial began on 5 November 2004. The international press was held in a sound-proof chamber and all media was banned from observing the trial after the Shining Path cadre turned their backs on the judges and delivered a revolutionary salute to the media gallery. The only words Guzmán spoke in the presence of the international press were "Long live the Communist Party of Peru! Glory to Marxism–Leninism–Maoism! Glory to the Peruvian people! Long live the heroes of the people’s war!" After he made this statement, the courtroom microphones were silenced and the press was unable to hear any of the proceedings that followed.  When the trial resumed on 12 November, no reporters were allowed to observe the proceedings. Eventually two of the judges recused themselves and the trial ended in chaos. Guzmán's third trial began in September 2005 and was opened and closed amid a [[media blackout]]. No reporters were allowed to attend. On 13 October 2006, Guzmán was sentenced to life in prison on charges of aggravated terrorism&lt;ref&gt;CBC News, [http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2006/10/13/shining-path-peru.html ''Shining Path militant leaders given life sentences in Peru'']. 13 October 2006. Retrieved on 16 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[murder]].&lt;ref name="terrorismmurder"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2006/10/14/1764956.htm?site=news Peru's Shining Path founder sentenced to life for terrorism, murder]. [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]], October 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  At his sentencing, three judges read the charges in a verdict that lasted more than six hours.&lt;ref name="terrorismmurder"/&gt;

In 2014, Guzmán and his wife Iparraguirre were tried again, for the 1992 [[Tarata bombing]] in Lima in which 25 people died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/21/shining-path-leader-presidente-gonzalo-abimael-guzman|title=Former Shining Path leader 'Presidente Gonzalo' faces Peru court|last=Collyns|first=Dan|date=2014-01-20|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 September 2018, he was sentenced to a second life term in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-peru-shiningpath-trial/founder-of-peru-shining-path-rebellion-given-second-life-sentence-idUSKCN1LR2PL|title=Founder of Peru Shining Path rebellion given second life sentence|last=|first=|date=|work=[[Reuters]]|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guzmán is currently incarcerated in the maximum security prison of the naval base of [[Callao]], the port of Lima. Fellow prisoners there include [[Víctor Polay]], leader of the [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]], and, ironically, [[Vladimiro Montesinos]], the former head of the [[National Intelligence Service (Peru)|National Intelligence Service]] who supervised the construction of the prison and served under the (now also imprisoned) President [[Alberto Fujimori]].&lt;ref name="sdpnoticias.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926221644/http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?menuID=2&amp;subID=1004 |archivedate=2007-09-26|title=At home in Peru’s nastiest cell-block |publisher=The First Post |date=2006-10-14 |url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?menuID=2&amp;subID=1004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The 1995 novel ''[[The Dancer Upstairs]]'' and the [[The Dancer Upstairs (film)|2002 film of the same title]] are loosely based on Guzmán's capture when living in the house of dance teacher [[Maritza Garrido Lecca]] in Lima.

'''Alberto Toscano''' (born 1 January 1977) is a British [[cultural critic]], [[social theorist]], [[philosopher]] and [[translation|translator]] best known to the English-speaking world for his translations of the work of [[Alain Badiou]], including Badiou's ''The Century'' and ''Logics of Worlds''. He served as both editor and translator of Badiou's ''Theoretical Writings'' and ''On Beckett''.

==Work==
Alberto Toscano's own work has been described both as an investigation of the persistence of the idea of communism in contemporary thought and a genealogical inquiry into the concept of fanaticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.v2.nl/archive/people/alberto-toscano Toscano's Author Page at Institute for the Unstable Media]&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of ''The Theatre of Production'' (2006), and his book ''Fanaticism: The Uses of an Idea'' was published in 2010. Toscano has published on contemporary philosophy, politics and social theory. In an  article on the [[Tarnac 9]] case, written for ''[[The Guardian]]'' in December 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/28/human-rights-tarnac-nine Criminalising Dissent]&lt;/ref&gt; Toscano argues that society is losing its ability to distinguish between vandalism and terrorism.

A reader in [[sociology]] at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]], Toscano is a member of the editorial board of the journal ''[[Historical Materialism (journal)|Historical Materialism: Research in Critical Marxist Theory]]''. According to [[Alex Callinicos]] this journal "has been one of the main drivers of the academic revival of [[Marxism]]" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/global/2010/jul/01/marxism-2010-global-financial-system|title= Marxism 2010: fixing a broken system|author= Alex Callinicos |date=July 1, 2010 |work= |publisher=guardian.co.uk |accessdate= July 6, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100704222519/http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2010/jul/01/marxism-2010-global-financial-system| archivedate= 4 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the mid-1990s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3154">'''Gaius Amafinius''' (or '''Amafanius''') was one of the earliest Roman writers in favour of the [[Epicurean]] philosophy. He probably lived in the late 2nd and early 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M., (2001), ''On the Nature of Things'', page x. Hackett Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote several works, which are censured by [[Cicero]] as deficient in arrangement and style. He is mentioned by no other ancient writer but Cicero.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Academica'', i. 2, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', iv. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the ''Academica'', Cicero reveals that Amafanius translated the Greek concept of [[atom]]s as "[[Corpuscle (disambiguation)|corpuscle]]s" (''corpusculi'') in Latin. 

In his ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'', Cicero disapprovingly notes that Amafanius was one of the first philosophers writing in Latin at Rome:&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/tusc4.shtml#6 ''Tusculan Disputations'']: ''(C)um interim illis silentibus C. Amafinius extitit dicens, cuius libris editis commota multitudo contulit se ad eam potissimum disciplinam, sive quod erat cognitu perfacilis, sive quod invitabantur inlecebris blandis voluptatis, sive etiam, quia nihil erat prolatum melius, illud quod erat tenebant.''&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|But, during this silence, C. Amafinius arose and took upon himself to speak; on the publishing of whose writings the people were moved, and enlisted themselves chiefly under this sect, either because the doctrine was more easily understood, or because they were invited thereto by the pleasing thoughts of amusement, or that, because there was nothing better, they laid hold of what was offered them.}}

In his ''Academica'', [[Cicero]] criticizes Amafinius and his fellow Epicurean [[Rabirius (Epicurean)|Rabirius]] for their unsophisticated [[prose style]], and says that in their efforts to introduce philosophy to common people they end up saying nothing. He concludes indignantly: "they think there is no art of speechmaking or composition."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Academica Posteriora'' 1.2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel de Montaigne]] alludes to these passages in his ''[[Essais]]'', book 2, chapter 17, ''De la presumption'' ("On Presumption.")  Montaigne writes:&lt;ref&gt;Michel de Montaigne, [http://www.bribes.org/trismegiste/es2ch17.htm ''De la presumption'']: ". . . un jargon populaire, et un proceder sans definition, sans partition, sans conclusion, trouble, à la façon de celuy d'Amafanius et de Rabirius."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
As a rhetorical device, apophasis can serve a number of purposes.

It can be employed to raise an ''[[ad hominem]]'' or otherwise controversial attack while disclaiming responsibility for it, as in, "I refuse to discuss the rumor that my opponent is a drunk." This can make it a favored tactic in politics.

Apophasis can be used [[passive aggression|passive-aggressively]], as in, "I forgive you for your jealousy, so I won't even mention what a betrayal it was."

In [[Cicero]]'s "[[Pro Caelio]]" speech, he says to a prosecutor, ''"Obliviscor iam iniurias tuas, Clodia, depono memoriam doloris mei"'' ("I now forget your wrongs, Clodia, I set aside the memory of my pain [that you caused].")&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], "[[Pro Caelio]]", Chapter 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Apophasis can be used to discuss a taboo subject, as in, "We are all fully loyal to the emperor, so we wouldn't dare to claim that his [[The Emperor's New Clothes|new clothes]] are a transparent hoax."

As a rhetorical device, it can serve various purposes, often dependent on the relationship of the speaker to the addressee and the extent of their shared knowledge. Apophasis is rarely literal; instead, it conveys meaning through implications that may depend on this context. As an example of how meaning shifts, the English phrase "needless to say" invokes shared understanding, but its actual meaning depends on whether that understanding was really shared. The speaker is alleging that it is not necessary to say something because the addressee already knows it, but is it so? If it is, it may merely emphasize a pertinent fact. If the knowledge is weighted with history, it may be an indirect way of levying an accusation ("needless to say, ''because you are responsible''"). If the addressee does not actually already possess the knowledge, it may be a way to condescend: the speaker suspected as much but wanted to call attention to the addressee's ignorance. Conversely, it could be a sincere and polite way to share necessary information that the addressee may or may not know ''without'' implying that the addressee is ignorant.

Apophasis can serve to politely avoid suggestion of ignorance on the part of an audience, as found in the narrative style of Adso of Melk in [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', where the character fills in details of early fourteenth-century history for the reader by stating it is unnecessary to speak of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Name of the Rose |last= Eco |first=Umberto |authorlink=Umberto Eco |year= 1984 |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=San Diego |isbn= |page=39 |translator=William Weaver |chapter=Postscript to the Name of the Rose}} Eco and Weaver use the spelling paralepsis or "passing over" for the phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the same introduction can be made sarcastically to condescend to an audience and imply their ignorance.

Another diplomatic use would be to raise a criticism indirectly, as in, "It would be out of line for me to say that this action would be unwise and unaffordable, sir, as I only care about your best interests."

==Examples==

When apophasis is taken to its extreme, the speaker provides full details, stating or drawing attention to something in the very act of pretending to pass it over: "I will not stoop to mentioning the occasion last winter when our esteemed opponent was found asleep in an alleyway with an empty bottle of vodka still pressed to his lips."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/P/paralipsis.htm |title= paralipsis |last1= Burton |first1=Gideon O |work=Silva Rhetoricae: The Forest of Rhetoric |publisher=[[Brigham Young University]] |accessdate=1 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110525140036/http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/P/paralipsis.htm| archivedate= 25 May 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1984 U.S. presidential campaign debates, [[Ronald Reagan]] used a humorous apophasis to deflect scrutiny of his own fitness at age 73 by replying, "I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1844704_1844706_1844612,00.html|author=M. J. Stephey|website=Time Magazine|title=Reagan's Age-Old Wisdom|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, he applied a harsher apophasis toward George H.W. Bush's opponent [[Michael Dukakis]], who was rumored to have received psychological treatment, "Look, I'm not going to pick on an invalid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lamar Jr.|first1=Jacob V.|title=Reagan: Part Fixer, Part Hatchet Man|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,968130,00.html|website=Time Magazine|accessdate=16 August 2015|date=15 August 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States President [[Donald Trump]] frequently employs apophasis.&lt;ref name="huffpo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-rhetorical-device_us_56c358cbe4b0c3c55052b32b | title=He Would Never Say It, But This Is Donald Trump’s Favorite Rhetorical Device | work=Huffington Post | date=16 February 2016 | accessdate=25 May 2016 | author=Bobic, Igor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Trump said of fellow Republican presidential candidate and former [[Hewlett-Packard]] CEO [[Carly Fiorina]], "I promised I would not say that she ran Hewlett-Packard into the ground, that she laid off tens of thousands of people and she got viciously fired. I said I will not say it, so I will not say it."&lt;ref name="huffpo"/&gt; In 2016, he tweeted of journalist [[Megyn Kelly]], “I refuse to call [her] a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct."&lt;ref name="huffpo"/&gt; In 2017, as [[President of the United States|president]], he tweeted of the leader of [[North Korea]], "Why would [[Kim Jong-un]] insult me by calling me 'old,' when I would NEVER call him 'short and fat?'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/11/politics/north-korea-trump-asia-trip/index.html | title=Trump sarcastically responds to Kim Jong Un insults | work=CNN | date=11 November 2017 | accessdate=12 November 2017 | author=Karimi, Faith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10797">The '''Baby Doe Law''' or '''Baby Doe Amendment''' is the name of an amendment to the Child Abuse Law passed in 1984 in the [[United States]] that sets forth specific criteria and guidelines for the treatment of seriously ill and/or disabled newborns, regardless of the wishes of the parents. &lt;!--Doe here is a [[pseudonym]] - see [[John Doe]]--&gt;

==Details of the law==
The Baby Doe Law mandates that states receiving federal money for child abuse programs develop procedures to report medical neglect, which the law defines  as the withholding of treatment unless a baby is irreversibly [[Coma|comatose]] or the  treatment for the newborn's survival is "virtually futile." Assessments of a child's quality of life are not valid reasons for withholding medical care.

==Background of the law==
The law came about as a result of several widely publicized cases involving the deaths of disabled newborns. The parents of these children withheld standard medical treatment for correctable gastrointestinal birth defects, sometimes leading to their deaths.  

=== Baby Doe ===
The primary case was a 1982 incident involving "Baby Doe", a [[Bloomington, Indiana]], baby with [[Down syndrome]] whose parents declined surgery to fix [[esophageal atresia]] with [[tracheoesophageal fistula]], leading to the baby's death. [[Surgeon General of the United States|The Surgeon General of the United States]], at the time of this incident, Doctor [[C. Everett Koop]], argued the boy was denied treatment (and food and water) not because the treatment was unreasonably risky but rather because he was intellectually disabled. Koop commented publicly that he disagreed with such withholding of treatment. In his decades as a pediatric surgeon, Koop had repaired hundreds of such defects, with a continually improving rate of success. By 1982, success was nearly certain if the surgery was performed. 

=== Baby Jane Doe ===
A somewhat similar situation in 1983 involving a "Baby Jane Doe" again brought the issue of withholding treatment for newborns with disabilities to public attention.  In this case, the parents and doctors had decided not to perform surgery on a baby with a [[birth defect]] affecting the spine and brain.  

Baby Jane Doe was born on October 11, 1983, in [[New York City]], with an open [[Spina bifida|spinal column]], ([[Spina bifida|meningomyelocele]]), [[hydrocephaly]] and [[microcephaly]]. Surgical closure of the defect and reduction of fluid from her brain was expected to prolong her life – perhaps extending her life from age 2 without the surgery, to age 20 with it – but she was still expected to be [[bedridden]] and [[Paralysis|paralyzed]], to have [[epilepsy]] and kidney damage, and to have severe [[brain damage]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/08/nyregion/baby-doe-hard-case-for-parents-and-courts.html|title=Baby Doe: Hard Case for Parents and Courts|last=Chambers|first=Marcia|date=8 January 1984|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parents, who were [[Roman Catholic]] Christians, consulted medical specialists, clergy, and social workers to decide what to do.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  They chose [[conservative management]] with nutrition, antibiotics, and bandages, rather than invasive surgery to close the hole in her spine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Vermont]] attorney and [[Right to life|right-to-life]] advocate&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lawrence Washburn brought suit in New York to obtain [[guardianship]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and an order to have the surgery performed.  After an initial win in court, in which a justice of the [[New York Supreme Court]] found that her life was in "imminent danger", another person was appointed as her guardian, and the surgery was ordered, Washburn lost his case on appeal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He then filed another in federal court.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The parents, at this point, had accumulated tens of thousands of dollars in legal debts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Also, the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) received a complaint that Baby Jane Doe was being denied aggressive medical treatment. The HHS referred the case to New York's Child Protective Services, which on November 7 found no merit to the complaint. The HHS also obtained copies of the infant's medical records for her first week of life, which were reviewed by Koop, who stated that he did not see anything in the record that would exclude the child from surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =  http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/QQ/Views/Exhibit/narrative/babydoe.html | title = C. Everett Koop Papers| accessdate = 2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; HHS took the stance that Baby Jane Doe was being discriminated against due to her medical conditions and mental retardation. HHS repeatedly requested copies of the infant's medical records (past October 19) under section 504 of the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]].

In early November, HHS brought suit against the hospital to the US District Court. The court concluded that the hospital was not in violation of section 504, and that the hospital treatment plan for the infant was based on the parents' decision to withhold surgery, not on discrimination. The court also found the parents' decision was "reasonable" based on the "medical options available and genuine concern for the best interests of the child."  The Court of Appeals ruled that the Rehabilitation Act did not give HHS any ability to interfere with the "treatment decisions involving defective newborn infants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

During the protracted court battles, Baby Jane's parents consented to some surgery for their daughter. The hole in her spine closed naturally, without surgery.  Baby Jane survived beyond anyone's expectations.  She has some intellectually and other disabilities, such as [[kidney damage]] and the need to use a [[wheelchair]], but she talks and interacts with people and lives in a [[group home]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Results ==
Koop's efforts to educate the [[United States Congress]] about this issue ultimately led to the Baby Doe Amendment ([http://frwebgate6.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=187649170348+33+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve U.S.C.A. TITLE 42, CHAPTER 67, Sec. 5106a]). On October 9, 1984, the amendment extended the laws defining child abuse to include the withholding of fluids, food, and medically indicated treatment from disabled children. The law went into effect on June 1, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;For information about this, see: Kathryn Moss (1987) 
"The 'Baby Doe' Legislation: Its Rise and Fall".
''Policy Studies Journal'' 15 (4), 629–651.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the regulations were struck down by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] on the grounds that the autonomy of the states had been violated and that the Rehabilitation Act did not apply to the medical care of handicapped infants.&lt;ref&gt;''The Future of Children'', Journal Issue: Low Birth Weight, "Evidence-Based Ethics and the Care of Premature Infants." 5(1), Spring 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes in the regulations over time==
In order to enforce the regulations laid out in the Baby Doe Law, telephone hot lines were set up around the country and the federal government encouraged anonymous reporting of alleged child abuse (specifically, the withholding of medical care to seriously ill newborns).  The hotlines were discontinued, however, as they resulted in the frequent intrusion of federal investigators into hospitals, often without warrant or without finding actual abuse.

==Actual text of the law==
The following text is found under the '''eligibility requirements''' for federal funding in U.S.C.A. TITLE 42, CHAPTER 67, Sec. 5106a. ''Grants to States for child abuse and neglect prevention and treatment programs'':
:(B) an assurance that the State has in place procedures for responding to the reporting of medical neglect (including instances of withholding of medically indicated treatment from disabled infants with life-threatening conditions), procedures or programs, or both (within the State child protective services        system), to provide for--
::(i) coordination and consultation with individuals designated by and within appropriate health-care facilities;
::(ii) prompt notification by individuals designated by and within appropriate health-care facilities of cases of suspected medical neglect (including instances of withholding of medically indicated treatment from disabled            infants with life-threatening conditions); and
::(iii) authority, under State law, for the State child protective services system to pursue any legal remedies, including the authority to initiate legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction, as may be necessary to prevent the withholding of medically indicated treatment from disabled infants with life threatening conditions;

'''Bimal Krishna Matilal''' (1935–1991) was an [[India]]n [[philosopher]] whose influential writings present the [[Indian logic|Indian philosophical tradition]] as a comprehensive system of logic incorporating most issues addressed by themes in Western [[philosophy]]. From 1977 to 1991 he
was the [[Spalding Professor of Eastern Religion and Ethics]] at the [[University of Oxford]].

==Education==
Literate in [[Sanskrit]] from an early age, Matilal was also drawn towards [[Mathematics]] and [[Logic]]. He was trained in the traditional Indian philosophical system by leading scholars of the [[Sanskrit College]], where he himself was a teacher from 1957 to 1962. He was taught by scholars like pandit Taranath Tarkatirtha and Kalipada Tarkacharya. He also interacted with pandit Ananta Kumar Nyayatarkatirtha, Madhusudan Nyayacharya and Visvabandhu Tarkatirtha. The ''upadhi'' (degree) of Tarkatirtha (master of Logic) was awarded to him in 1962.

While teaching at the [[Sanskrit College]] (an affiliated college of the [[University of Calcutta]]) between 1957 and 1962, Matilal came in contact with [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Daniel Ingalls]], an [[Indology|Indologist]] at [[Harvard University]], who encouraged him to join the PhD program there. Matilal secured a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright fellowship]] and completed his PhD under Ingalls on the [[Navya-Nyāya]] doctrine of [[negation]], between 1962 and 1965. During this period he also studied with [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]. Subsequently, he was professor of Sanskrit at the [[University of Toronto]], and in 1977 he was elected Spalding Professor at Oxford, succeeding [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] and [[Robert Charles Zaehner]].

==Death==
Matilal died of cancer on 8 June 1991.

==Works by Matilal==
In his work, he presented Indian logic, particularly [[Nyāya]]-[[Vaisheshika|Vaiśeṣika]], [[Mīmāṃsā]] and [[Buddhist philosophy]], as being relevant in modern philosophical discourse. Matilal presented Indian Philosophical thought more as a synthesis rather than a mere exposition. This helped create a vibrant revival of interest in Indian philosophical tradition as a relevant source of ideas rather than a dead discipline.

He was also the founding editor of the ''[[Journal of Indian Philosophy]]''.

The '''Book of Elchasai''' or the '''Book of Elxai''' is a lost prophetic book, written during the reign of [[Trajan]], that contained laws and apocalyptic prophecies pertaining to [[Jewish Christian]] and [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] doctrines. It is known only from fragments quoted in the early Christian writings of [[Hippolytus of Rome]], [[Eusebius]], [[Epiphanius of Salamis]], and [[Origen]].{{sfn|Aune|2003|page=145}} The book was used by a number of [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordanian]] sects, including [[Ebionites]], [[Essenes]], [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], and especially by [[Elcesaites]] whom based their origins from.{{efn|Luomanen highlights the later adoption of the book by Ebionites as evidence that the book contained teachings favorable to the Ebionites, and further argues that their adoption of the book marks a distinct separation from Judaism.{{sfn|Luomanen|2011|pages=42–44, 49}}}}

== Content ==
According to Hippolytus's ''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]'', the Book of Elchasai was the source of a number of Elcesaite beliefs and practices. It encourages following the [[Torah|Law]] (including [[circumcision]]), as well as [[Asceticism|ascetic practices]]. Sexual desire is presented as wickedness, but a sin that could be cured through baptism. The book uses numbers and measures to foretell the future and further advocates healing rituals, as well as following a schedule based on [[astrology]]. The universe is held to be governed by principles created by God, who is called ''"the great and most high God"''.  God's son (Christ, also called ''"the mighty king"'') along with the [[Holy Spirit]] (who is female) are depicted as angels of enormous size. Christ is held to have lived on earth repeatedly through [[reincarnation]], sometimes arriving through virgin births. However, [[Jesus]] is taught to have been conceived naturally. Seven witnesses are called to confirm the teachings of Elchasai.{{efn|The seven witnesses are identified as ''heaven'', ''water'', ''the holy spirits'' (plural), ''the angels of prayer'', ''oil'', ''salt'', and ''earth''.{{sfn|Broadhead|2010|page=215}}}} The book is also apocalyptic, expatiating on an impending crisis.{{sfn|Broadhead|2010|pages=214 &amp; 215}}

== History ==
The Book of Elchasai was written around the [[Roman–Parthian Wars|Parthian War of 114-117]] AD in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] by a [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Mesopotamian Jew]].{{sfn|Luomanen|2011|pages=42–44, 49}} The purpose of the book may have been to bring comfort to Jews surviving the massacre during the war. The book describes angelic beings of "stupendous" size and their announcement of universal destruction. These beings revealed the requirements which would allow absolution on the judgment day. Similar enormous angels are also described in 3 Enoch such as Metatron, but Elchasai is particularly describing Christ and the Holy Spirit.{{sfn|Yuri|2000|page=102}}{{sfn|Schäfer|2011|pages=313 &amp; 315}} The book contains a prediction of a war among wicked angels. Over hundred years later, a [[Hellenization|Hellenistic]] version of this manuscript was used by Syrian Judeo-Christians. Epiphananius considered this book heretical.{{sfn|Luomanen|2011|pages=42–44, 49}}{{sfn|Luttikhuizen|1987|pages=101–6}}

[[Alcibiades of Apamea]] was described by Hippolytus as a "strange demon" having possession of this book of revelations. Hippolytus refuted Alcibiades claims that the book was "a secret writing" and those who listened to the message of the book would receive remission of all their sins. The actual contents of the book were only revealed to converts, those who are willing to follow Alcibiades.{{sfn|Luomanen|2011|pages=42–44, 49}}{{sfn|Luttikhuizen|1987|pages=101–6}}

== Ibn al-Nadim ==
Elchasai is considered to be a historical figure. The Kitāb al-Fihrist references a manuscript, written by Muslim scholar [[Ibn al-Nadim]] in which he identifies Elchasai instituting the Babylonian baptists sect of ''Mughtasilah'' (practitioners of ablution) or ''katharioi''.{{sfn|Yuri|2000|page=102}}{{sfn|Klijn|Reinink|1974|pages=277–289}} This sect was based upon the revelations that he had in his twenties. One of the followers of Elchasai was [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], who joined Elchasai when he was only four years old by his father who was a convert to the ''Mughtasilah'' sect.{{sfn|Yuri|2000|page=102}} Mani went on to form his own Gnostic sect known as the [[Manichaeism|Manicheans]].{{sfn|Klijn|Reinink|1974|pages=277–289}}

== Features ==
[[Image:CVIPtoolsfrontpage.png|thumb|Running the CVIPtools]]
CVIPtools can read many image formats including [[TIFF]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[GIF]], [[JPEG]], [[BMP file format|BMP]], as well as raw formats. CVIPtools supports standard image processing functions such as image compression, image restoration, logical and arithmetical operations between images, contrast manipulation, image sharpening, [[Frequency transform]], edge detection, segmentation and geometric transformations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail/CVIPtools-for-Linux/1017471208/3|title=CVIPtools for Linux|website=FileForum.betanews.com|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
== CVIP-ATAT ==
The Computer Vision and Image Processing Algorithm Test and Analysis Tool, CVIP-ATAT, was created to facilitate the development of both human and computer vision applications. The primary function of this tool is to allow the user to explore many more algorithmic possibilities than can be considered by processing one image at a time with CVIPtools. It allows for the automatic processing of large image sets with many different algorithmic and parameter variations. We call this the "front-end" tool because its primary purpose is to find the best algorithm to preprocess, segment and post-process a set of images for a particular application in order to best separate the most important regions of interest within the image.

It has a GUI which allows the user to enter multi-stage algorithms for testing and analysis. At each stage the user can specify a number of different processes to test and a range for the processes' parameters. The user also specifies a set of images to process and a set of "ideal" output images which will be used to determine the success for each algorithm. Note that one algorithm is defined as a specific set of processes and a specific set of parameter values.

tool will then automatically perform algorithms which consist of all the permutations of the values for each of the parameters for each process and all the processes for each stage. Next, the user can compare the various algorithm results to determine the best set of processes and parameters for the particular application. The tool is useful for application development where the ideal image results are available, or can be created. Additionally, it can serve as a front end development tool for image analysis to find the optimal set of processes and parameters for extracting regions of interest for further processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Umbaugh|first=Scott E|title=Digital Image Processing and Analysis : Applications with Matlab and CVIPtools|year=2018|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4987-6602-9|edition=3rd}}[https://www.crcpress.com/Digital-Image-Processing-and-Analysis-Applications-with-MATLAB-and-CVIPtools/Umbaugh/p/book/9781498766029]&lt;/ref&gt;

== CVIP-FEPC ==
The Computer Vision and Image Processing Feature Extraction and Pattern Classification Tool, CVIP-FEPC, was created to facilitate the development of both human and computer vision applications. The primary application area is computer vision, but it can be used, for example, as an aid in the development of image compression schemes for human vision applications. This can be done by helping to determine salient image features that must be retained for a given compression scheme. Conversely, computer vision applications are essentially deployed image analysis systems for a specific application, so the feature extraction and pattern classification is an integral part of all computer vision systems.

The primary function of this tool is to explore feature extraction and pattern classification and allow the user to perform batch processing with large image sets and is thus much more efficient than processing one image at a time with CVIPtools. It allows the user to select the features and pattern classification parameters for the automatic processing of these large image sets. CVIP-FEPC enables the user to easily specify the training and test sets and run multiple experiments in an efficient manner. Its primary purpose is to find the best parameters for a particular application in order to best classify the image objects of interest.

This tool is designed to work with a set of images that have binary masks that have been created for the objects of interest – one object per image. These masks can be created manually with CVIPtools, or, many image database applications will have the masks available. In general, the user will load the images, specify the classes, select the features, select the test set, choose the pattern classification parameters and then let the program process the entire image set. An output file will be created with the results for the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Umbaugh|first=Scott E|title=Digital Image Processing and Analysis : Applications with Matlab and CVIPtools|year=2018|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4987-6602-9|edition=3rd}}[https://www.crcpress.com/Digital-Image-Processing-and-Analysis-Applications-with-MATLAB-and-CVIPtools/Umbaugh/p/book/9781498766029]&lt;/ref&gt;

== CVIP Toolbox for Matlab ==
The CVIP Toolbox for Matlab can perform various functions: 1) Arithmetic and logic, 2) Band, 3) Color, 4) Conversion of image files, 5) Edge/Line detection, 6) Geometry, 7) Histogram, 8) Mapping, 9) Morphological, 10) Noise, 11) Objective fidelity metrics, 12) Pattern classification: classification algorithms, 13) Pattern classification: feature extraction, 14) Pattern classification: normalization methods, 15) Segmentation, 16) Spatial filters: adaptive filters, 17) Spatial filters: mean filters, 18) Spatial filters: miscellaneous, 19) Spatial filters: order filters, 20) Transform, 21) Transform filters: standard, and 22) Transform filters: restoration. The CVIP Toolbox includes a CVIPlab skeleton program, similar to the CVIPlab for the C/C++ programmer, and a utility function for batch processing. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Umbaugh|first=Scott E|title=Digital Image Processing and Analysis : Applications with Matlab and CVIPtools|year=2018|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4987-6602-9|edition=3rd}}[https://www.crcpress.com/Digital-Image-Processing-and-Analysis-Applications-with-MATLAB-and-CVIPtools/Umbaugh/p/book/9781498766029]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Contingency, Hegemony, Universality: Contemporary Dialogues On The Left''''' is a collaborative book by the [[Political philosophy|political theorists]] [[Judith Butler]], [[Ernesto Laclau]], and [[Slavoj Žižek]] published in 2000.

== Background, structure and themes ==
Over the course of the 1990s, Butler, Laclau, and Žižek found themselves engaging with each other's work in their own books. In order to focus more closely on their theoretical differences (and similarities), they decided to produce a book in which all three would contribute three essays each, with the authors' respective second and third essays responding to the points of dispute raised by the earlier essays. In this way, the book is structured in three "cycles" of three essays each, with points of dispute and lines of argumentation developed, passed back and forward, and so on.

At one point in the exchange, Butler refers to the exercise as an unintentional "comedy of formalisms" (137), with each writer accusing the other two of being too abstract and formalist in relation to the declared themes of [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]], [[hegemony]], and [[universality (philosophy)|universality]]. At the heart of these themes is a desire to address the question of [[Political particularism|particularism]] and political emancipation. For example, while Žižek holds the notion of capitalism as a structure that enables various particular political claims, Butler and Laclau stress that all politics can be conceptualized in terms of a hegemonic struggle, which rejects the notion of any primary structure, such as capitalism or patriarchy.

== Points of dispute between Butler and Laclau ==
* ''The Lacanian Real''. In the psychoanalytic theory of [[Jacques Lacan]], "[[the Real]]" is regarded as the limit of representation. Laclau draws upon this concept of the Real to justify his claim that political identities are incomplete. Butler criticizes this because, according to her, it elevates the Lacanian Real into a transcendental, ahistorical category. However, Laclau's response to Butler on this point is that the Lacanian Real introduces a radical disjunction into our idea of history - something which puts the whole idea of a concept being "ahistorical" radically into question (66). In other words, for Lacan, there is no continuity to history and, therefore, there can be no stable "ahistorical" concepts.
* ''Political Struggles and Identity''. Butler disputes Laclau's claim that competing political groups can form a "chain of equivalence" around a common lack (i.e. the incompleteness of their political identity). She argues that Laclau has no reason to assume that groups on the Left base their struggles on "identity". For this reason, Butler argues for a politics of translation between political groups struggling for liberation, in which groups reformulate their demands in the act of translating these demands into ones which can be placed coherently alongside the demands of other groups. (168)
* ''Citation and Parodic Performance''. Butler claims that [[gender]] codes such as fashion and physical movements can be self-consciously [[parody|parodied]] in such a way that they weaken those codes - a project which she believes is important to feminist liberation. However, Laclau believes that Butler's use of the word "parody" in this context is overly-playful and restricts feminist politics to less confrontational modes of political resistance.

== Points of dispute between Laclau and Žižek ==
* ''Is Capitalism The "Only Game In Town"?'' Žižek's main argument against Laclau is that capitalism can accommodate all the demands of [[identity politics]], and still continue to ''economically'' exploit those who identify with the newly liberated group. For instance, feminists might rejoice at equal pay, yet - from Žižek's point of view - this only serves to encourage women's participation in capitalist economics. Žižek accuses Laclau of accepting the idea that "capitalism is now the only game in town" (95).
* ''Is Universality Fleeting Or Impossible?'' Laclau claims that true political universality is impossible. However, for Laclau, this does not mean that we should abandon any attempt at political universality (as some [[poststructuralism|poststructuralists]] might urge). Instead, Laclau argues that Leftists have to include this certain failure to achieve universality in their strategies - hence the title of his most successful book (co-written with [[Chantal Mouffe]]) ''[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy]]'' (1985). However, Žižek claims that universality is possible, although it is fleeting. Žižek believes that once the Left accept the impossibility of universality (as Laclau does), they will have given up all hope of ever over-throwing capitalism. In that sense, Žižek's stand on universality is equally as strategic as Laclau's.

== Points of dispute between Butler and Žižek ==
* ''Who Is The True Formalist?'' Butler accuses Žižek of being a [[Hegelian]] formalist on the basis that he appears to simply apply his Hegelian metaphysics to culture, whereas Butler herself is interested in the idea of [[performativity]] as a cultural ritual. Thus, Butler thinks that Žižek is uninterested in the specificity of the examples he uses to illustrate his points and that he really only chooses examples which will illustrate and serve his own argument. In turn, Žižek accuses Butler of being a [[Kantian]] formalist because, in his view, gender performativity is an empty formalist structure which is filled out by contingent cultural practices.
* ''Lacanian Sexual Difference''. Following the psychoanalytic theory of Lacan, Žižek claims that sexual difference functions as an "empty" difference onto which all other subsequent differences are projected. Thus, during infancy, a child only enters the [[semiotic]] world of language once it has accepted the existence of sexual difference (which remains an "empty" difference because the pre-lingual infant cannot fill it out with any positive content). Against this view (and in defence of her thesis that gender is performatively enacted), Butler argues that, in order to be approached this way, the concept of sexual difference in Lacanian theory must be "emptied out" of positive content, such as the biological difference between males and females.

[[File:Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-Ji 2.jpg|thumb|Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji [[zendo]]]]
'''Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji''', or '''International Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji''', is a [[Rinzai]] monastery and retreat center located in the [[Catskill Mountains]] of upstate [[New York (state)|New York]]. Maintained by the [[Zen Studies Society]], Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji is led by Shinge-Shitsu Roko [[Sherry Chayat]] Roshi.  It is part of the Zen Studies Society, founded in 1956 to support the work of [[D.T. Suzuki]].

==Activities==

The site offers daily services which include [[zazen]], [[chanting]] and samu (work). Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji also offers traditional [[kessei]] — a three-month period of intensive spiritual training in a Zen monastery  — in addition to weeklong [[sesshin]]s and weekend retreats throughout the year.&lt;ref name="wilson"/&gt; Those students who wish to ordain with Shinge Roshi must live at the monastery for 1,000 days, after which they have the option of staying or going back out into the secular world.  

==Location==

Located about a 3 hour drive north of New York City on {{convert|1400|acre|km2}} near Beecher Lake&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;Wilson, 146–147&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[deciduous forest]] region,&lt;ref name="keenan"&gt;Keenan, xiii–xiv; 192&lt;/ref&gt; Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji was established on July 4, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daibosatsu.org/dbzindex.html |accessdate=February 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219114314/http://www.daibosatsu.org/dbzindex.html |archivedate=February 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The monastery site is located atop a {{convert|2|mi|km|sing=on}} drive that passes by "Sangha Meadow", a [[cemetery]] for housing the remains of deceased [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] members (including a portion of the ashes of [[Soen Nakagawa]] Roshi).&lt;ref name="keenan"/&gt; The facility's upstate mailing address is in the nearby township of Livingston Manor off New York State Route 17 (NY 17), and an active New York City temple is maintained on the upper east side of Manhattan.

==Controversy==

In July 2010, [[Eido Shimano]], co-founder of Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji and an abbot for over three decades, resigned from the [[Zen Studies Society]] Board of Directors after a  relationship between Shimano and one of his female students became a subject of controversy, amid accusations that this was only the latest in a series of affairs spanning several decades. A committee of Zen teachers formed in November 2011 found that the sexual acts were often initiated during formal private [[sanzen]] interactions between Zen teacher and student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/21/us/21beliefs.html|title=Sex Scandal Has U.S. Buddhists Looking Within|date=21 August 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

'''David Sztybel''' (born 2 February 1967) is a Canadian philosopher specializing in [[animal ethics]].

==Education and career==
Sztybel was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. He obtained his BA in philosophy in 1991, his MA in 1994, and his PhD in 2000 – for a thesis entitled "Empathy and Rationality in Ethics" – from the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name=cv&gt;[http://davidsztybel.info/x-cv.html "Education"], davidsztybel.info, accessed 2 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

He fulfilled an Advisory Research Committee Post-Doctoral Fellowship at [[Queen's University]] (2001-2002), held a fellowship at the [[Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics]] (2007–2011), and a research fellowship at the [[University of Vienna]] (2011 to present).&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; Most of his work is related to [[animal rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Fellenz, Marc R. [https://books.google.com/books?id=OO7MMgyJJ1AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=PA21 ''The Moral Menagerie: Philosophy and Animal Rights'']. University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Sztybel has developed a new theory of [[animal rights]] which he terms "best caring", as outlined in his paper "The Rights of Animal Persons". Criticizing conventional theories of rights based on intuition, traditionalism or common sense, compassion, [[Immanuel Kant]]'s theory, [[John Rawls]]' theory, and [[Alan Gewirth]]'s theory, Sztybel devises a new theory of rights for human and nonhuman animals. Sztybel bases his theory, in part, on the idea that sentient beings are ends-in-themselves, a theory of emotional cognition which verifies that some things really are good or bad for sentient beings. This is a non-[[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] or "individuals-respecting" theory that defends the proposition that all sentient beings should be legally recognized as persons.&lt;ref&gt;Sztybel, D. [http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/sztybel-rights.pdf "The Rights of Animal Persons"], ''Animal Liberation Philosophy and Policy Journal'', 4(1), 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is critical of utilitarianism and the traditional feminist [[ethics of care]]. He also takes issue with the traditional notion of [[animal welfare]], which supports the use of animals if steps are taken to avoid "unnecessary" suffering, the parameters of which vary. Sztybel argues that we would never call the same treatment of humans, mentally disabled or otherwise, to be consistent with their welfare. He coined the term "animal illfare" to describe conventional animal treatment. He holds that true animal welfare would only entail wishing animals good (never anything avoidably malicious). He supports that fully realized substantial animal rights correspond to a significant respect for all [[Sentience|sentient]] beings.

Sztybel contends that Singer's philosophy of animal liberation is not really about liberating animals in general; he accuses Singer of being a [[Speciesism|speciesist]] for defending the vivisection of animals on the ground that they have inferior cognitive capacities. In so doing, Singer is effectively sanctioning the harmful treatment of nonhuman animals on the basis of a species-characteristic which does not justify violent treatment.

He also provides a critique of the [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionist]] views of [[Gary L. Francione]] and [[Joan Dunayer]], who argue that animal rights supporters should not pursue a welfarist approach. A defense of suffering-reduction laws and a discussion of the logical problems of anti-welfarism are featured in Sztybel's article "Animal Rights Law: Fundamentalism versus Pragmatism".

'''Dharmakīrti''' (fl. c. 6th or 7th century) was an influential Indian [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosopher who worked at [[Nalanda|Nālandā]].&lt;ref name=tillemanssep&gt;Tom Tillemans (2011), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dharmakiirti/ Dharmakirti], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the key scholars of [[epistemology]] ([[pramana]]) in [[Buddhist philosophy]], and is associated with the [[Yogachara|Yogācāra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald S. Lopez Jr.|title=Buddhism and Science: A Guide for the Perplexed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1rTNRb5uA4C |year=2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-49324-4 |pages=133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sautrāntika]] schools. He was also one of the primary theorists of [[Buddhist atomism]].&lt;ref name="Nakamura301"/&gt; His works influenced the scholars of [[Mīmāṃsā]], [[Nyaya]] and [[Shaivism]] schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] as well as scholars of [[Jainism]].{{Sfn| Eltschinger|2010}}

Dharmakīrti's ''[[Pramanavarttika|Pramāṇavārttika]]'', his largest and most important work, was very influential in India and Tibet as a central text on pramana ('valid knowledge instruments') and was widely commented on by various Indian and Tibetan scholars. His texts remain part of studies in the [[gompa|monasteries]] of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=liberman2007p52/&gt;

==History==
Little is known for certain about the life of Dharmakirti.&lt;ref name=tillemanssep/&gt; Tibetan hagiographies suggest he was a Brahmin born in South India&lt;ref name=lmjoshi146/&gt; and was the nephew of the Mīmāṃsā scholar [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]]. When he was young, Kumārila spoke abusively towards Dharmakirti as he was taking his brahminical garments. This led Dharmakirti to take the robes of the [[bhikkhu|Buddhist order]] instead, resolving to "vanquish all the heretics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buton|first1=Rinchen Drub|title=History of Buddhism in India and Tibet|date=1931|translator=E. Obermiller|publisher=Harrossowitz|location=Heidelberg|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a student of Buddhism, he first studied under Isvarasena,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hajime Nakamura|title=Indian Buddhism: A Survey with Bibliographical Notes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0A7y4TCeVQC&amp;pg=PA301 |year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0272-8 |pages=301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later moved to [[Nalanda]] where he interacted with 6th century Dharmapala.&lt;ref name=tillemanssep/&gt;&lt;ref name=lmjoshi146&gt;{{cite book|author=Lal Mani Joshi|title=Studies in the Buddhistic Culture of India During the 7th and 8th Centuries A.D.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-epU7NHNCOQC |year=1977|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0281-0|pages=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the accuracy of the Tibetan hagiographies is uncertain, and scholars place him in the 7th-century instead. This is because of inconsistencies in different Tibetan and Chinese texts, and because it is around the middle of 7th-century, and thereafter, that Indian texts begin discussing his ideas,&lt;ref name=tillemanssep/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kurtis R. Schaeffer|title=Sources of Tibetan Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=buDN9BdRkN8C&amp;pg=PA372 |year=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-13599-3 |pages=372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=liberman2007p52&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth Liberman|title=Dialectical Practice in Tibetan Philosophical Culture: An Ethnomethodological Inquiry into Formal Reasoning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H9O57AB42yoC |year=2007|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-0-7425-7686-5 |pages=52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the citation of Dharmakirti verses in the works of [[Adi Shankara]].&lt;ref name="Nakamura301"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hajime Nakamura|title=Indian Buddhism: A Survey with Bibliographical Notes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0A7y4TCeVQC&amp;pg=PA301 |year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0272-8 |pages=301 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dharmakīrti is placed by most scholars to have lived between 600–660 CE, but a few place him earlier.{{Sfn| Eltschinger|2010}}

Dharmakirti is credited with building upon the work of [[Dignāga]], the pioneer of [[Buddhist logic]], and Dharmakirti has ever since been influential in the Buddhist tradition.&lt;ref name=liberman2007p52/&gt; His theories became normative in Tibet and are studied to this day as a part of the basic monastic curriculum.&lt;ref name=liberman2007p52/&gt;

Dharmakirti worked at Nalanda as a lay Buddhist, not as an ordained monk, and his work reflects his belief that no one will understand the value of his work, his efforts soon forgotten.&lt;ref name=tillemanssep/&gt;&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2HS1DOZ35EgC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0#v=onepage&amp;q=plunder&amp;f=false | title=The sociology of philosophies: a global theory of intellectual change.

==Philosophy==
{{Asian philosophy sidebar}}
===Historical context===
The Buddhist works such as the ''[[Yogacarabhumi-sastra]]'' and the ''Mahāyānasūtrālaṅkāra'' composed before the [[6th century]], on ''hetuvidyā'' (logic, dialectics) are unsystematic, whose approach and structure are heresiological, proselytical and apologetic.{{Sfn| Eltschinger|2010}} Their aims were to defeat non-Buddhist opponents (Hinduism, Jainism, [[Ājīvika|Ājīvikism]], others), defend the ideas of Buddhism, develop a line of arguments that monks can use to convert those who doubt Buddhism and to strengthen the faith of Buddhists who begin to develop doubts.{{Sfn| Eltschinger|2010}} Around the middle of the 6th century, possibly to address the polemics of non-Buddhist traditions with their [[pramana]] foundations, the Buddhist scholar [[Dignāga]] shifted the emphasis from dialectics to more systematic [[epistemology]] and logic, retaining the heresiological and apologetic focus.{{Sfn| Eltschinger|2010}} Dharmakīrti followed in Dignāga footsteps, and is credited with systematic philosophical doctrines on Buddhist epistemology, which Vincent Eltschinger states, has "a full-fledged positive/direct apologetic commitment".{{Sfn| Eltschinger|2010}} Dharmakīrti lived during the collapse of the [[Gupta Empire]], a time of great insecurity for Buddhist institutions. The role of Buddhist logic was seen as an intellectual defense against Hindu philosophical arguments formulated by epistemically sophisticated traditions like the [[Nyaya]] school. However, Dharmakīrti and his followers also held that the study of reasoning and its application was an important tool for [[soteriological]] ends.{{Sfn| Eltschinger|2010}}

===Epistemology===
[[File:2 Pramana Epistemology Buddhism.svg|thumb|Buddhist epistemology holds that perception and inference are the means to correct knowledge.]]
Dharmakīrti's philosophy is based on the need to establish a theory of logical validity and certainty grounded in causality. Following [[Dignāga]]'s ''Pramāṇasamuccaya'', Dharmakīrti also holds that there are only two instruments of knowledge or 'valid cognition' (''pramāṇa''); "perception" ([[Pramana#Hinduism|pratyaksa]]) and "inference" ([[anumāṇa]]). Perception is a non-conceptual knowing of particulars which is bound by causality, while inference is reasonable, linguistic and conceptual.&lt;ref name=tillemanssep/&gt; In the ''Pramāṇavārttika'' Dharmakīrti defines a pramana as a "reliable cognition". What it means for a cognition to be reliable has been interpreted in different ways. Following commentators like Dharmottara, who define it as meaning that a cognition is able to lead to the obtaining of one's desired object, some modern scholars such as Jose I. Cabezon have interpreted Dharmakīrti as defending a form of [[Pragmatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cabezón, José I., 2000, “Truth in Buddhist Theology,” in R. Jackson and J. Makransky, (eds.), Buddhist Theology, Critical Reflections by Contemporary Buddhist Scholars. London: Curzon, 136–154.&lt;/ref&gt; Tillemans sees him as holding to a weak form of [[correspondence theory]], which holds that to "confirm causal efficacy" (''arthakriyāsthiti'') is to have a justification that an object of cognition has the causal powers we expected.&lt;ref name=tillemanssep/&gt; That justification comes through a certain kind of non-conceptual perception (''pratyakṣa'') which is said to be an "intrinsical source of knowledge" (''svataḥ prāmāṇya'') which is ultimately reliable. Dharmakīrti sees a cognition as being valid if it has a causal connection with the object of cognition through an intrinsically valid, un-conceptual perception of the object which does not err regarding its functionality. As Dharmakirti says: "A pramāṇa is a reliable cognition. [As for] reliability, it consists in [this cognition’s] compliance with [the object’s capacity to] perform a function" (''Pramāṇavārttika'' 2.1ac).{{Sfn| Eltschinger|2010}}

Dharmakīrti also holds that there were certain extraordinary epistemic warrants, such as the words of the Buddha, who was said to be a authoritative/reliable person (''pramāṇapuruṣa'') as well as the 'inconceivable' perception of a yogi (''yogipratyakṣa''). On the role of scriptural authority, Dharmakīrti has a moderate and nuanced position. For Dharmakīrti, scripture (Buddhist or otherwise) is not a genuine and independent mean of valid cognition. He held that one should not use scripture to guide one on matters which can be decided by factual and rational means and that one is not to be faulted for rejecting unreasonable parts of the scriptures of one's school. However scripture is to be relied upon when dealing with "radically inaccessible things", such as the laws of karma and [[soteriology]]. However according to Dharmakīrti scripture is a fallible source of knowledge and has no claim to certainty.&lt;ref name=tillemanssep/&gt; 

===Metaphysics===
According to Buddhologist [[Tom Tillemans]], Dharmakīrti's ideas constitute a [[nominalist]] philosophy which disagrees with the [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy, by asserting that some entities are real. Dharmakīrti states that the real is only the momentarily existing particulars (''svalakṣaṇa''), and any universal (''sāmānyalakṣaṇa'') is unreal and a fiction. He criticized the Nyaya theory of [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] by arguing that since they have no causal efficacy, there is no rational reason to posit them. What is real must have powers (''śakti''), fitness (''yogyatā'') or causal properties which is what individuates a real particular as an object of perception. Dharmakīrti writes "whatever has causal powers (''arthakriyāsamartha''), that really exists (''paramārthasat'')."&lt;ref name=tillemanssep/&gt; This theory of causal properties has been interpreted as a form of [[Trope_(philosophy)#Trope_theory_in_philosophy_.28metaphysics.29|trope theory]].&lt;ref name=tillemanssep/&gt; ''Svalakṣaṇa'' are said to be part-less, undivided and property-less, and yet they impart a causal force which give rise to perceptual cognitions, which are direct reflections of the particulars.{{Sfn| Eltschinger|2010}} 

Dharmakīrti's ultimately real (''paramārthasat'') particulars are contrasted with conventionally real entities (''saṃvṛtisat'') as part of his presentation of the Buddhist [[Two truths doctrine]]. The conventionally real for him are based on linguistic categories, intellectual constructs and erroneous superimpositions on the flow of reality, such as the idea that universals exist.{{Sfn| Eltschinger|2010}} According to Dharmakīrti, cognitive distortion of the direct perception of particulars occurs during the process of recognition (''pratyabhijñāna'') and perceptual judgment (''niścaya'') which arises due to latent tendencies (''vāsanā'') in the mind left over from past impressions of similar perceptions. These latent dispositions come together into constructed representations of the previously experienced object at the moment of perception, and hence it is an imposed error on the real, a pseudo-perception (''pratyakṣābhāsa'') which conceals (''saṃvṛti'') reality while at the same time being practically useful for navigating it.{{Sfn| Eltschinger|2010}} Ignorance (''[[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidyā]]'') for Dharmakīrti is conceptuality, pseudo-perception and superimposition overlaid on the naturally radiant (''prabhāsvara'') nature of pure perception. By correcting these defilements of perception through mental cultivation as well as using inference to gain "insight born of (rational) reflection" (''cintāmayī prajñā'') a Buddhist yogi is able to better see the true nature of reality until his perception is fully perfected.{{Sfn| Eltschinger|2010}} 

Dharmakīrti, again following [[Dignāga]], also holds that that things as they are in themselves are “ineffable” (''avyapadeśya''). Language is never about the things in themselves, only about conceptual fictions, hence they are [[nominalists]].&lt;ref name=tillemanssep/&gt; Due to this theory, the main issue for Dharmakirti becomes how to explain that it is possible for our arbitrary and conventional linguistic schemas to refer to perceptual particulars which are ineffable and non conceptual. To explain this gap between conceptual schema and perceptual content, Dharmakirti takes up Dignaga's theory of "exclusion" (''apoha''). Dignāga's view is that "a word talks about entities only as they are qualified by the negation of other things."&lt;ref name=tillemanssep/&gt; Dharmakīrti's unique take on this nominalist theory, which underlies his entire system, is to reinterpret it in terms of causal efficacy—''arthakriyā'' (which can also be translated as 'telic function', 'functionality', and 'fulfillment of purpose').{{Sfn| Eltschinger|2010}}

Dharmakīrti developed his philosophical system to defend Buddhist doctrines, so it is no surprise that he developed a number of arguments for [[Reincarnation|rebirth]], the [[Four Noble Truths]], the authority of the Buddha, [[karma]], [[anatta]] and compassion as well as attacking Brahminical views such as the authority of the [[Vedas]].{{Sfn| Eltschinger|2010}} 

Dharmakīrti also defended the Buddhist theory of momentariness (''kṣaṇikatva''), which held that dharmas spontaneously perish the moment they arise. Dharmakīrti came up with an argument for the theory which stated that since anything that really exists has a causal power, the fact that its causal power is in effect proves it is always changing. For Dharmakīrti, nothing could be a cause while remaining the same, and any permanent thing would be causally inert.&lt;ref name=tillemanssep/&gt;

===Philosophy of mind===
Dharmakīrti defends Dignāga's theory of consciousness being non-conceptually reflexive (''svasamvitti'' or ''[[svasaṃvedana]]''). This is the idea that an act of intentional consciousness is also aware of itself as aware.&lt;ref name=tillemanssep/&gt; Consciousness is said to illuminate itself like a lamp that illuminates objects in a room as well as itself. Dharmakīrti also defends the Yogācāra theory of "awareness-only" (''[[Yogachara#Vij.C3.B1apti-m.C4.81tra|vijñaptimātratā]]''), which held that 'external objects' of perception do not exist.&lt;ref name=tillemanssep/&gt; According to Dharmakīrti, an object of cognition is not external or separate from the act of cognition itself. This is because the object is "necessarily experienced simultaneously with the cognition [itself]" (''Pramāṇavārttika'' 3.387).{{Sfn| Eltschinger|2010}} The view that there is a duality (''dvaya'') between an object (''grāhya'') and a subjective cognition (''grāhaka'') arises out of ignorance.

Dharmakīrti's ''Substantiation of Other Mindstreams'' (''Saṃtānāntarasiddhi'') is a treatise on the nature of the [[mindstream]] and Buddhist response to the [[problem of other minds]]&lt;ref&gt;Source: [https://web.archive.org/web/20101110082146/http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/3_phil/buddh/bsa059_u.htm] (accessed: Wednesday 28 October 2009). There is an English translation of this work by Gupta (1969: pp.81–121) which is a rendering of [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy|Stcherbatsky]]'s work from the Russian: Gupta, Harish C. (1969). ''Papers of Th. Stcherbatsky''. Calcutta: Indian Studies Past and Present. (translated from Russian by Harish C. Gupta).&lt;/ref&gt; Dharmakirti held the mindstream to be beginning-less yet also described the mindstream as a temporal sequence, and that as there are no true beginnings, there are no true endings, hence, the "beginningless time" motif that is frequently used to describe the concept of mindstream.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, John D.

===Affiliation===
There is disagreement among Indian and Tibetan doxographers as to how to categorise Dharmakīrti's thought. The [[Gelug]] school asserts that he expressed Yogācāra views, most non-Gelug Tibetan commentators assert that he expressed Sautrāntika views and, according to one Tibetan source, a number of renowned later Indian Madhyamikas asserted that he expressed [[Madhyamaka]] views.&lt;ref&gt;Ngawang Palden in the Sautrantika chapter of his ''Explanation of the Conventional and the Ultimate in the Four Systems of Tenets'' (''Grub mtha' bzhi'i lugs kyi kun rdzob dang don dam pa'i don rnam par bshad pa legs bshad dpyid kyi dpal mo'i glu dbyangs'', New Delhi: Guru Deva, 1972, 39.5–39.6) says that some such as Prajñakaragupta, Suryagupta, Shantarakshita, Kamalashila, and Jetari interpret Dharmakirti’s ''Commentary on [Dignaga’s] Compendium of Valid Cognition'' (''Tshad ma rnam 'grel'', ''Pramanavarttika'') as a Madhyamika treatise. ''Dependent-Arising and Emptiness: A Tibetan Buddhist Interpretation of Madhyamika Philosophy Emphasizing the Compatibility of Emptiness and Conventional Phenomena'' [[Elizabeth Napper|Napper, Elizabeth]].

Among modern scholars, some like Tillemans argue that Dharmakīrti represented the Yogācāra school, while Amar Singh argues that he was a Sautrāntika.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Amar; The Heart of Buddhist Philosophy: Dinnaga and Dharmakīrti, New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 1984. xvi + 168 pp.
Appendices, glossary, bibliography and indices.&lt;/ref&gt; For Christine Mullikin Keyt, Dharmakīrti represents a "synthesis of two schools of Indian Buddhism, the Sautrantika and the Yogacara."&lt;ref&gt;Keyt, Christine Mullikin; Dharmakīrti's concept of the Svalakṣaṇa, 1980, https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/5723&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Dan Arnold argues that Dharmakīrti's alternating philosophical perspectives of Sautrāntika and Yogācāra views are ultimately compatible and are applied at different levels of his ‘sliding scale of analysis.’&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Dan; Buddhist Idealism, Epistemic and Otherwise: Thoughts on the Alternating Perspectives of Dharmakīrti, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a tendency to see Dignāga and Dharmakīrti as founding a new type of Buddhist school or tradition, which is known in Tibetan as "those who follow reasoning" (''rigs pa rjes su ‘brang ba'') and sometimes is known in modern literature as ''pramāṇavāda''.

==Writings and commentaries==
Dharmakīrti is credited with the following major works:

*''Saṃbandhaparikṣhāvrtti'' (Analysis of Relations)
*''Pramāṇaviniścaya'' (Ascertainment of Valid Cognition)
*''[[Pramanavarttika|Pramāṇavārttika]]-kārika'' (Commentary on Dignaga's 'Compendium of Valid Cognition')
*''Pramāṇavārttikasvavrtti'' (Auto-commentary on the above text)
*''Nyāyabinduprakaraṇa'' (Drop of Logic)
*''Hetubindunāmaprakaraṇa'' (Drop of Reason)
*''Saṃtānāntarasiddhināmaprakaraṇa'' (Proof of Others' Mindstreams)
*''Vādanyāyanāmaprakaraṇa'' (Reasoning for Debate)

There are various commentaries by later thinkers on Dharmakīrti, the earliest commentators are the Indian scholars Devendrabuddhi (ca. 675 C E.) and Sakyabuddhi (ca. 700 C.E.).&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, John D; Foundations of Dharmakirti's Philosophy, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; Other Indian commentators include Karṇakagomin, Prajñākaragupta, Manorathanandin, Ravigupta and Śaṅkaranandana.&lt;ref&gt;Cluster of Excellence "Asia and Europe in a Global Context" of the University of Heidelberg, http://east.uni-hd.de/buddh/ind/7/16/&lt;/ref&gt;

He was extremely influential in Tibet, where Phya pa Chos kyi Seng ge (1182-1251) wrote the first summary of his works, called "Clearing of Mental Obscuration with Respect to the
Seven Treatises on Valid Cognition" (''tshad ma sde bdun yid gi mun sel''). [[Sakya Pandita]] wrote the "Treasure on the Science of Valid Cognition" (''tshad ma rigs gter'') and interpreted Dharmakirti as an anti-realist against Phya pa's realism.&lt;ref&gt;Recognizing Reality: Dharmakirti’s Philosophy and its Tibetan Interpretations, (Suny: 1997), page 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; These two main interpretations of Dharmakīrti became the foundation for most debates in Tibetan epistemology.

[[File:Disinformation vs Misinformation.jpg|thumb|300px|Graphic showing differences between disinformation, [[misinformation]], and [[hoax]]]]
'''Disinformation''' is false information spread deliberately to deceive.&lt;ref name=pacepa /&gt;&lt;ref name=bittman1985 /&gt;&lt;ref name=shultzgodson /&gt; The English word [[wikt:disinformation|''disinformation'']] is a [[loan translation]] of the Russian [[wikt:дезинформация|''dezinformatsiya'']],&lt;ref name=pacepa /&gt;&lt;ref name=bittman1985 /&gt;&lt;ref name=shultzgodson /&gt; derived from the title of a [[KGB]] [[black propaganda]] department.&lt;ref name=jowett /&gt; The book ''[[Disinformation (book)|Disinformation]]'' documents that [[Joseph Stalin]] coined the term, giving it a French-sounding name to falsely claim it had a Western origin.&lt;ref name=pacepa /&gt;

Russian use began with a "special disinformation office" in 1923.&lt;ref name=manningromerstein /&gt;  Disinformation was defined in ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' (1952) as "false information with the intention to deceive public opinion".&lt;ref name=pacepa /&gt;&lt;ref name=bittman1985 /&gt;&lt;ref name=adamtaylor /&gt; [[Operation INFEKTION]] was a Soviet disinformation campaign to influence opinion that the U.S. invented [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name=pacepa /&gt;&lt;ref name=adamtaylor /&gt;&lt;ref name=usstate /&gt; The U.S. did not actively counter disinformation until 1980, when a [[Forgery as covert operation|fake document]] reported that the U.S. supported [[apartheid]].&lt;ref name=jmichaelwaller /&gt;

The word ''disinformation'' did not appear in English dictionaries until the late-1980s.&lt;ref name=pacepa /&gt;&lt;ref name=bittman1985 /&gt; English use increased in 1986, after revelations that the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] engaged in disinformation against [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]].&lt;ref name=biagi /&gt; By 1990 it was pervasive in U.S. politics;&lt;ref name=davidmartin /&gt; and by 2001 referred generally to lying and [[propaganda]].&lt;ref name=heinemann /&gt;&lt;ref name=cunningham /&gt;

==Etymology and early usage==
The English word ''disinformation'', which did not appear in dictionaries until the late-1980s, is a translation of the Russian [[wikt:дезинформация|дезинформация]], [[transliterated]] as ''dezinformatsiya''.&lt;ref name=bittman1985&gt;{{citation|first=Ladislav|last=Bittman|authorlink=Lawrence Martin-Bittman|title=The KGB and Soviet Disinformation: An Insider's View|year=1985|isbn=978-0-08-031572-0|publisher=Pergamon-Brassey's|pages=49–50|title-link=The KGB and Soviet Disinformation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adamtaylor /&gt;&lt;ref name=pacepa /&gt; Where [[misinformation]] refers to inaccuracies that stem from error, disinformation is deliberate falsehood promulgated by design.&lt;ref name=jowett /&gt; Misinformation can be used to define disinformation—when known misinformation is purposefully and intentionally disseminated.&lt;ref name=golbeck&gt;{{citation|pages=19–20|title=Computing with Social Trust|editor1-first=Jennifer|editor1-last=Golbeck|year=2008|isbn=978-1-84800-355-2|publisher=Springer|series=Human-Computer Interaction Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Front group]]s are a form of disinformation, as they fraudulently mislead as to their actual controllers.&lt;ref name=eugeneasamier&gt;{{citation|title=Secrecy and Tradecraft in Educational Administration: The Covert Side of Educational Life|page=176|first=Eugene A.|last=Samier|series=Routledge Research in Education|year=2014|isbn= 978-0-415-81681-6|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disinformation tactics can lead to [[Blowback (intelligence)|blowback]], unintended negative problems due to the strategy, for example [[defamation]] lawsuits or damage to reputation.&lt;ref name=eugeneasamier /&gt; Disinformation is primarily prepared by government [[intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]].&lt;ref name=jangoldman&gt;{{citation|title=Words of Intelligence: A Dictionary|first=Jan|last=Goldman|chapter=Disinformation|isbn=978-0-8108-5641-7|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the term related to a Russian tactical weapon started in 1923, when the Deputy Chairman of the [[KGB]]-precursor the [[State Political Directorate]] (GPU), [[Józef Unszlicht]], called for the foundation of "a special disinformation office to conduct active intelligence operations".&lt;ref name=manningromerstein&gt;{{citation|pages=82–83|title=Historical Dictionary of American Propaganda|author1=Martin J.

Rychlak]] authored a book titled ''[[Disinformation (book)|Disinformation]]'', in which Pacepa wrote that Stalin gave the tactic a French-sounding title in order to put forth the ruse that it was actually a technique used by the [[Western world]].&lt;ref name=pacepa /&gt; Pacepa recounted reading Soviet instruction manuals while working as an intelligence officer, that characterized disinformation as a strategy utilized by the [[Russian government]] that had early origins in [[Russian history]].&lt;ref name=adamtaylor /&gt;&lt;ref name=pacepa /&gt; Pacepa recalled that the Soviet manuals said the origins of disinformation stemmed from phony towns constructed by [[Grigory Potyomkin]] in [[Crimea]] to wow [[Catherine the Great]] during her 1783 journey to the region—subsequently referred to as [[Potemkin village]]s.&lt;ref name=adamtaylor /&gt;&lt;ref name=pacepa /&gt;

In their book ''Propaganda and Persuasion'', authors Garth Jowett and Victoria O'Donnell characterized ''disinformation'' as a [[cognate]] from ''dezinformatsia'', and was developed from the same name given to a KGB [[black propaganda]] department.&lt;ref name=jowett&gt;{{citation|author1=Garth Jowett  |author2=Victoria O'Donnell|title=Propaganda and Persuasion|pages=21–23|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-0898-6|year=2005|chapter=What Is Propaganda, and How Does It Differ From Persuasion?|quote=In fact, the word disinformation is a cognate for the Russian dezinformatsia, taken from the name of a division of the KGB devoted to black propaganda.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The black propaganda division was reported to have formed in 1955 and was referred to as the Dezinformatsiya agency.&lt;ref name=merriam /&gt; Former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) director [[William Colby]] explained how the Dezinformatsiya agency operated, saying that it would place a false article in a left-leaning newspaper.&lt;ref name=merriam /&gt; The fraudulent tale would make its way to a Communist periodical, before eventually being published by a Soviet newspaper, which would say its sources were undisclosed individuals.&lt;ref name=merriam /&gt; By this process a falsehood was globally proliferated as a legitimate piece of reporting.&lt;ref name=merriam /&gt;

According to ''Oxford Dictionaries'' the English word ''disinformation'', as translated from the Russian ''disinformatsiya'', began to see use in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=oxfordweb&gt;{{citation|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/disinformation|accessdate=9 December 2016|date=2016|chapter=disinformation|title=English Oxford Living Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''disinformation'' began to see wider use as a form of Soviet [[tradecraft]], defined in the 1952 official ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' as "the dissemination (in the press, radio, etc.) of false information with the intention to deceive public opinion."&lt;ref name=bittman1985 /&gt;&lt;ref name=adamtaylor /&gt; During the most-active period of the [[Cold War]], from 1945 to 1989, the tactic was used by multiple intelligence agencies including the Soviet KGB, British [[Secret Intelligence Service]], and the American CIA.&lt;ref name=fowlers /&gt; The word ''disinformation'' saw increased usage in the 1960s and wider purveyance by the 1980s.&lt;ref name=adamtaylor&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/11/26/before-fake-news-there-was-soviet-disinformation|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=26 November 2016|accessdate=3 December 2016|title=Before 'fake news,' there was Soviet 'disinformation'|first=Adam|last=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Soviet bloc intelligence officer [[Ladislav Bittman]], the first disinformation practitioner to publicly defect to the West, described the official definition as different from the practice: "The interpretation is slightly distorted because public opinion is only one of the potential targets. Many disinformation games are designed only to manipulate the decision-making elite, and receive no publicity."&lt;ref name=bittman1985 /&gt; Bittman was deputy chief of the Disinformation Department of the [[Czechoslovak Intelligence Service]], and testified before the [[United States Congress]] on his knowledge of disinformation in 1980.&lt;ref name=nicholasjohncull /&gt;

Disinformation may include distribution of [[Forgery|forged]] [[document]]s, manuscripts, and photographs, or spreading dangerous [[rumour]]s and [[Fabrication (science)|fabricated]] [[intelligence]]. A major disinformation effort in 1964, [[Operation Neptune (espionage)|Operation Neptune]], was designed by the [[Czechoslavakia|Czechoslovak]] secret service, the [[StB]], to defame West European politicians as former [[Nazi collaborators]].&lt;ref name=bittman1972&gt;{{citation|first=Ladislav|last= Bittman|authorlink=Lawrence Martin-Bittman|title=The Deception Game: Czechoslovak Intelligence in Soviet Political Warfare|publisher=Syracuse University Research Corporation|year=1972|isbn=978-0-8156-8078-9|pages=39–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of Soviet disinformation [[covert operation]] campaigns, came to light through the [[defection]]s of KGB officers and officers of allied Soviet bloc services from the late 1960s through the 1980s.&lt;ref name=holland2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=davidmartin /&gt; Disorder during the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] revealed archival and other documentary information to confirm what the defectors had revealed.&lt;ref name=holland2012&gt;{{citation|title=The Propagation and Power of Communist Security Services Dezinformatsiya|journal=[[International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence]]|volume=19|issue=1|year=2006|first=Max|last=Holland|doi=10.1080/08850600500332342|pages=1–31}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanislav Levchenko]] and Ilya Dzerkvilov defected from the Soviet Union and by 1990 each had written books recounting their work in the KGB on disinformation operations.&lt;ref name=davidmartin /&gt;

In 1961, a pamphlet was published in the United Kingdom titled: ''A Study of a Master Spy (Allen Dulles)'', which was highly critical of then-[[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[Allen Dulles]].&lt;ref name=jmichaelwaller /&gt; The purported authors were given as [[Independent Labour Party]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] [[Bob Edwards (politician)|Bob Edwards]] and reporter Kenneth Dunne—when in actual fact the author was senior disinformation officer KGB Colonel Vassily Sitnikov.&lt;ref name=jmichaelwaller&gt;{{citation|title=Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda, and Political Warfare|first=J.

An example of successful Soviet disinformation was the publication in 1968 of ''[[Who's Who in the CIA]]'' which was quoted as authoritative in the West until the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=usia1992&gt;{{citation|author=[[United States Information Agency]]|url=http://intellit.muskingum.edu/russia_folder/pcw_era/sect_09b.htm|chapter=Crude, Anti-American Disinformation: 'Geheim' and 'Top Secret' Magazines: Purveyors of Crude, Defamatory Disinformation|title=Soviet Active Measures in the 'Post-Cold War' Era 1988-1991 - A Report Prepared at the Request of the United States House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations by the United States Information Agency|year=1992|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=United States Government Printing Office}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to senior [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] officer [[Sergei Tretyakov (intelligence officer)|Sergei Tretyakov]], the KGB was responsible for creating the entire [[nuclear winter]] story to stop the deployment of [[Pershing II]] missiles.&lt;ref name="Comrade J"&gt;{{citation|first=Pete |last=Earley|title=Comrade J: The Untold Secrets of Russia's Master Spy in America After the End of the Cold War|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2007|isbn=978-0-399-15439-3|pages=167–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tretyakov says that from 1979 the KGB wanted to prevent the United States from deploying the missiles in Western Europe and that, directed by [[Yuri Andropov]], they distributed disinformation, based on a faked "doomsday report" by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]] about the effect of nuclear war on climate, to peace groups, the environmental movement and the journal [[AMBIO|''AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment'']].&lt;ref name="Comrade J" /&gt;

During the 1970s, the U.S. intelligence apparatus paid little attention to try to counter Soviet disinformation campaigns.&lt;ref name=jmichaelwaller /&gt; This posture changed in September 1980 during the [[Carter Administration]], when the [[White House]] was subjected to a propaganda operation by Soviet intelligence regarding international relations between the U.S. and South Africa.&lt;ref name=jmichaelwaller /&gt; On 17 September 1980, White House Press Secretary [[Jody Powell]] acknowledged a falsified ''Presidential Review Memorandum on Africa'' reportedly stated the U.S. endorsed the [[apartheid]] government in South Africa and was actively committed to discrimination against African Americans.&lt;ref name=jmichaelwaller /&gt; Prior to this revelation by Powell, an advance copy of the 18 September 1980 issue of San Francisco-based publication the ''Sun Reporter'' was disseminated, which carried the fake claims.&lt;ref name=jmichaelwaller /&gt; ''Sun Reporter'' was published by [[Carlton Benjamin Goodlett]], Presidential Committee member of the Soviet [[front group]] the [[World Peace Council]].&lt;ref name=jmichaelwaller /&gt; U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] was appalled at these lies and subsequently the Carter Administration displayed increased interest in CIA efforts to counter Soviet disinformation.&lt;ref name=jmichaelwaller /&gt;

In 1982, the CIA issued a report on active measures used by Soviet intelligence.&lt;ref name=josephgoulden /&gt; The report documented numerous instances of disinformation campaigns against the U.S., including planting a notion that the U.S. had organized the 1979 [[Grand Mosque seizure]], and forgery of documents purporting to show the U.S. would utilize [[nuclear bomb]]s on its [[NATO]] allies.&lt;ref name=josephgoulden&gt;{{citation|title=The Dictionary of Espionage: Spyspeak into English|first=Joseph|last=Goulden|page=64|chapter=Disinformation (''dezinformatsiya'')|series=Dover Military History, Weapons, Armor|year=2012|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-48348-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Operation INFEKTION]] was an elaborate disinformation campaign which began in 1985, to influence world opinion to believe that the United States had invented [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name=adamtaylor /&gt;&lt;ref name=usstate /&gt; This included the allegation that the purpose was the creation of an 'ethnic bomb' to destroy non-whites.&lt;ref name=usstate&gt;{{citation|author=[[United States Department of State]]|title=Soviet Influence Activities: A Report on Active Measures and Propaganda, 1986–87|location=Washington D.C.|publisher=Bureau of Public Affairs|year=1987|pages=34–35, 39, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the [[Director of SVR|head of Russian foreign intelligence]], [[Yevgeny Primakov]], admitted the existence of the Operation INFEKTION disinformation campaign.&lt;ref name=adamtaylor /&gt;&lt;ref name=usstate /&gt;

In 1985, [[Aldrich Ames]] gave the KGB a significant amount of information on CIA agents, and the Soviet government swiftly moved to arrest these individuals.&lt;ref name=lochkjohnson&gt;{{citation|title=The Oxford Handbook of National Security Intelligence|editor1-first=Loch K.|editor1-last=Johnson|pages=548–550|chapter=Counterintelligence as Disinformation Operations|isbn=978-0-19-992947-4|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|series=Oxford Handbooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet intelligence feared this rapid action would alert the CIA that Ames was a spy.&lt;ref name=lochkjohnson /&gt; In order to reduce the chances the CIA would discover Ames's duplicity, the KGB manufactured disinformation as to the reasoning behind the arrests of U.S. intelligence agents.&lt;ref name=lochkjohnson /&gt; During summer 1985, a KGB officer who was a [[double agent]] working for the CIA on a mission in Africa traveled to a [[dead drop]] in Moscow on his way home but never reported in.&lt;ref name=lochkjohnson /&gt; The CIA heard from a European KGB source that their agent was arrested.&lt;ref name=lochkjohnson /&gt; Simultaneously the FBI and CIA learned from a second KGB source of their agent's arrest.&lt;ref name=lochkjohnson /&gt; Only after Ames had been outed as a spy for the KGB did it become apparent that the KGB had known all along that both of these agents were double agents for the U.S. government, and had played them as pawns to send disinformation to the CIA in order to protect Ames.&lt;ref name=lochkjohnson /&gt;

==Post Soviet-era Russian disinformation==
In the post-Soviet era, disinformation evolved to become a key tactic in the [[military doctrine of Russia]].&lt;ref name=powerfulrussian&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/29/world/europe/russia-sweden-disinformation.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=9 December 2016|title=A Powerful Russian Weapon: The Spread of False Stories|date=28 August 2016|first=Neil|last=MacFarquharaug|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] and [[NATO]] saw Russian disinformation in the early 21st century as such a problem that they both set up special units to analyze and debunk fabricated falsehoods.&lt;ref name=powerfulrussian /&gt; NATO founded a modest facility in Latvia to respond to disinformation&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|accessdate=9 December 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|title=The danger of Russian disinformation|date=6 May 2016|author1=Anne Applebaum  |author2=Edward Lucas|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-danger-of-russian-disinformation/2016/05/06/b31d9718-12d5-11e6-8967-7ac733c56f12_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, following agreement by heads of state and governments in March 2015 the EU created the [[European External Action Service]] East Stratcom Task Force, which publishes weekly reports in its website "EU vs Disinfo".&lt;ref name=euvsd&gt;{{cite web|url=https://euvsdisinfo.eu/|title=EU vs Disinfo|website=EU vs Disinfo|publisher=European External Action Service East Stratcom Task Force|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website and its partners identified and debunked over 3,500 pro-Kremlin disinformation cases between September 2015 and November 2017.&lt;ref name=euvsd /&gt;

Methods used by Russia during this period included its Kremlin-controlled mouthpieces: news agency ''[[Sputnik News]]'' and television outlet ''[[Russia Today]]'' (RT).&lt;ref name=powerfulrussian /&gt; When explaining the 2016 annual report of the [[Swedish Security Service]] on disinformation, representative Wilhelm Unge stated: "We mean everything from Internet trolls to propaganda and misinformation spread by media companies like RT and Sputnik."&lt;ref name=powerfulrussian /&gt;

Later in the 21st century, as social media gained prominence, Russia began to use popular platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to spread disinformation. Facebook believes that as many as 126 million users have seen content from Russian disinformation campaigns on its platform. Twitter has said that it has found 36,000 Russian bots spreading tweets related to the 2016 American election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/14/564013066/russia-using-disinformation-to-sow-discord-in-west-britains-prime-minister-says|title=Russia Using Disinformation To 'Sow Discord In West,' Britain's Prime Minister Says|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, Russia has used social media to destabilize former soviet states such as Ukraine and other western nations such as France and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/01/06/508032496/how-russias-disinformation-campaign-could-extend-its-tentacles|title=How Russia's Disinformation Campaign Could Extend Its Tentacles|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:How Disinformation Can Be Spread.jpg|thumb|250px|How Disinformation Can Be Spread, explanation by [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Defense Department]] (2001)]]
The [[United States Intelligence Community]] appropriated usage of the term ''disinformation'' in the 1950s from the Russian ''dezinformatsiya'', and began to utilize similar strategies&lt;ref name=manningromerstein /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=118|title=Right Words|first=Stephen |last=Murray-Smith|publisher=Viking|year=1989|isbn=978-0-670-82825-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the Cold War and in conflict with other nations.&lt;ref name=adamtaylor /&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in 2000 that during the CIA's effort to substitute [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi]] for then-[[Prime Minister of Iran]] [[Mohammad Mossadegh]], the CIA placed fictitious stories in the local newspaper.&lt;ref name=adamtaylor /&gt; [[Reuters]] documented how, subsequent to the 1979 Soviet Union invasion of Afghanistan during the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], the CIA put false articles in newspapers of Islamic-majority countries, inaccurately stating that Soviet embassies had "invasion day celebrations".&lt;ref name=adamtaylor /&gt; Reuters noted a former U.S. intelligence officer said they would attempt to gain the confidence of reporters and use them as [[secret agent]]s, to impact a nation's politics by way of their local media.&lt;ref name=adamtaylor /&gt;

In October 1986, the term gained increased currency in the U.S. when it was revealed that two months previously, the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] had engaged in a disinformation campaign against then-leader of [[Libya]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]].&lt;ref name=biagi&gt;{{citation|title=Media/Impact: An Introduction to Mass Media|first=Shirley|last=Biagi|page=328|chapter=Disinformation|year=2014|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-31138-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[White House]] representative [[Larry Speakes]] said reports of a planned attack on Libya as first broken by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' on August 25, 1986 were "authoritative", and other newspapers including ''[[The Washington Post]]'' then wrote articles saying this was factual.&lt;ref name=biagi /&gt; [[United States Department of State]] representative [[Bernard Kalb]] resigned from his position in protest over the disinformation campaign, and said: "Faith in the word of America is the pulse beat of our democracy."&lt;ref name=biagi /&gt;

The executive branch of the Reagan Administration kept watch on disinformation campaigns through three yearly publications by the Department of State: ''Active Measures: A Report on the Substance and Process of Anti-U.S. Disinformation and Propaganda Campaigns'' (1986); ''Report on Active Measures and Propaganda, 1986–87'' (1987); and ''Report on Active Measures and Propaganda, 1987–88'' (1989).&lt;ref name=manningromerstein /&gt;

''Disinformation'' first made an appearance in dictionaries in 1985, specifically ''Webster's New College Dictionary'' and the ''American Heritage Dictionary'' in 1985.&lt;ref name= bittman1988&gt;{{citation|title=The New Image-Makers: Soviet Propaganda &amp; Disinformation Today|first=Ladislav|last=Bittman|authorlink=Lawrence Martin-Bittman|year=1988|pages=7, 24|isbn=978-0-08-034939-8|publisher=Brassey's Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the term ''disinformation'' was not defined in ''Webster's New World Thesaurus'' or ''New Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;ref name=pacepa /&gt; After the Soviet term became widely known in the 1980s, native speakers of English broadened the term as "any government communication (either overt or covert) containing intentionally false and misleading material, often combined selectively with true information, which seeks to mislead and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] either elites or a mass audience."&lt;ref name=shultzgodson&gt;{{citation|first1=Richard H.|last1= Shultz |first2=Roy|last2= Godson|author1-link=Richard H.

By 1990, use of the term ''disinformation'' had fully established itself in the English language within the lexicon of politics.&lt;ref name=davidmartin&gt;{{citation|title=The Web of Disinformation: Churchill's Yugoslav Blunder|first=David|last=Martin|page=xx|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|year=1990|isbn=978-0-15-180704-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2001, the term ''disinformation'' had come to be known as simply a more civil phrase for saying someone was spouting [[lie]]s.&lt;ref name=heinemann&gt;{{citation|page=124|title=Developing Media Skills|first=Geoff |last=Barton |publisher=Heinemann|isbn=978-0-435-10960-8|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley B. Cunningham wrote in his 2002 book ''The Idea of Propaganda'' that ''disinformation'' had become pervasively utilized as a synonym for [[propaganda]].&lt;ref name=cunningham&gt;{{citation|title=The Idea of Propaganda: A Reconstruction|first=Stanley B. |last=Cunningham|pages=67–68, 110|chapter=Disinformation (Russian: ''dezinformatsiya'')|year=2002|isbn=978-0-275-97445-9|publisher=Praeger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The authors of a 2006 book about [[psychopathy in the workplace]], ''[[Snakes in Suits]]'' describe a five-phase model of how a typical workplace [[psychopath]] climbs to and maintains [[Power (social and political)|power]]. In phase three, manipulation, the psychopath will create a scenario of "[[Cognitive distortion|psychopathic fiction]]"—where positive information about themselves and negative disinformation about others will be created, casting others in roles as a part of a network of [[Flying monkeys (psychology)|pawns or patrons]] to be utilized and [[Operant conditioning|groomed]] into accepting the psychopath's agenda.&lt;ref name=Snakes&gt;{{citation|first1=Paul |last=Babiak |first2= Robert D. |last2=Hare|title=Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2007|page=240|isbn=978-0061147890|title-link=Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a contribution to the 2014 book ''Military Ethics and Emerging Technologies'', writers David Danks and Joseph H. Danks discuss the ethical implications in using disinformation as a tactic during [[information warfare]].&lt;ref name=daviddanks&gt;{{citation|title=Military Ethics and Emerging Technologies|editor1=Timothy J.

'''Endophysics''' literally means “[[physics]] from within”. It is the study of how the observations are affected and limited by the observer being within the universe. This is in contrast with the common '''exophysics''' assumption of a system observed from the “outside”. The term ''endophysics'' has been coined by [[David Finkelstein]] in a letter to the founder of the field [[Otto E. Rössler]].

'''Georg Kohler''' (born in [[Konolfingen]], Bern, Switzerland in 1945) is a Swiss [[Philosopher]]. He is a professor [[emeritus]] of [[Political philosophy|Political Philosophy]] at [[University of Zurich]]. He is also a publicist and an author. He has written books on political philosophy and modern day Swiss politics and also collaborated with other writers including [[Hermann Lübbe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philosophie.uzh.ch/de/seminar/emeriti/kohler.html|title=Georg Kohler|website=www.philosophie.uzh.ch|language=de|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://podium.nzz.ch/person/georg-kohler/|title=Prof. em.

Kohler's early education was in grammar schools. He then studied philosophy at the university of Zurich. In 1978 he completed his [[Licentiate (degree)#Switzerland|Licentiate]] degree of [[Jurisprudence|Jurisprudenz]] (law) from the University of Zurich. Until 1980 he held the post of Assistant of Philosophical Seminars at the University but moved away to manage the family business in Vienna. He returned to teaching in 1992 and joined the [[Geschwister-Scholl-Universität|Geschwister Scholl]]-Institute at the University of Munich. He left his post as the chairperson of philosophical research, and joined the University of Zurich in 1994 as a full professor after the retirement of his teacher [[Hermann Lübbe]]. He held the post until 2010, when he became a professor emeritus of Philosophy specializing in Political Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philosophie.uzh.ch/de/seminar/emeriti/kohler.html|title=Georg Kohler|website=www.philosophie.uzh.ch|language=de|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://podium.nzz.ch/person/georg-kohler/|title=Prof. em.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="73923">{{Economic anthropology |Basic}}
{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}
A '''gift economy''', '''gift culture''', or '''gift exchange''' is a mode of exchange where [[Anthropological theories of value|valuables]] are not [[traded]] or sold, but rather given without an explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards.&lt;ref name="Cheal "&gt;{{cite book |last=Cheal |first=David J |title=The Gift Economy |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1988 |pages=1–19 |chapter=1 |isbn=0415006414 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=o-wNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PP1 |accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This exchange contrasts with a [[barter economy]] or a [[market economy]], where [[goods and services]] are primarily exchanged for value received. Social norms and custom govern gift exchange. Gifts are not given in an explicit exchange of goods or services for [[money]] or some other [[commodity]].&lt;ref name="R. Kranton"&gt;R. Kranton: ''Reciprocal exchange: a self-sustaining system'', American Economic Review, V. 86 (1996), Issue 4 (September), p. 830-51&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of gift economies forms the subject of a foundational debate in anthropology. Anthropological research into gift economies began with [[Bronisław Malinowski]]'s description of the [[Kula ring]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Malinowski |first=Bronislaw |title=Argonauts of the Western Pacific |year=1922 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Trobriand Islands]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keesing |first1=Roger |last2=Strathern |first2=Andrew |title=Cultural Anthropology. A Contemporary Perspective |year=1988 |publisher=Harcourt Brace and Company |location=Fort Worth |page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kula trade appeared to be gift-like since Trobrianders would travel great distances over dangerous seas to give what were considered valuable objects without any guarantee of a return. Malinowski's debate with the French anthropologist [[Marcel Mauss]] quickly established the complexity of "gift exchange" and introduced a series of technical terms such as [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], [[inalienable possessions]], and prestation to distinguish between the different forms of exchange.&lt;ref name="Mauss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiner" /&gt;

According to anthropologists [[Maurice Bloch]] and Jonathan Parry, it is the unsettled relationship between market and non-market exchange that attracts the most attention. Gift economies are said, by some,&lt;ref&gt;Bollier, David. "The Stubborn Vitality of the Gift Economy." Silent Theft: The Private Plunder of Our Common Wealth. First Printing ed. New York: Routledge, 2002. 38-39. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; to build communities, with the market serving as an acid on those relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=J. Parry |first=M. Bloch |title="Introduction" in Money and the Morality of Exchange |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=8–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gift exchange is distinguished from other forms of exchange by a number of principles, such as the form of property rights governing the articles exchanged; whether gifting forms a distinct "sphere of exchange" that can be characterized as an "economic system"; and the character of the social relationship that the gift exchange establishes. Gift ideology in highly commercialized societies differs from the "prestations" typical of non-market societies. Gift economies must also be differentiated from several closely related phenomena, such as common property regimes and the exchange of non-commodified labour.

== Principles of gift exchange ==
According to anthropologist Jonathan Parry, discussion on the nature of gifts, and of a separate sphere of gift exchange that would constitute an economic system, has been plagued by the [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] use of modern, western, market society-based conception of the gift applied as if it were a cross-cultural, pan-historical universal. However, he claims that anthropologists, through analysis of a variety of cultural and historical forms of exchange, have established that no universal practice exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parry |first=Jonathan |title=The Gift, the Indian Gift and the 'Indian Gift' |journal=Man |year=1986 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=453–473 |doi=10.2307/2803096}}&lt;/ref&gt; His classic summation of the gift exchange debate highlighted that ideologies of the "pure gift"  "are most likely to arise in highly differentiated societies with an advanced division of labour and a significant commercial sector" and need to be distinguished from non-market "prestations".&lt;ref name="Parry 1986 467"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parry |first=Jonathan |title=The Gift, the Indian Gift and the 'Indian Gift' |journal=Man |year=1986 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=467 |doi=10.2307/2803096}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Weiner, to speak of a "gift economy" in a non-market society is to ignore the distinctive features of their exchange relationships, as the early classic debate between [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] and [[Marcel Mauss]] demonstrated.&lt;ref name="Mauss"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mauss |first=Marcel |title=The Gift: Forms and Functions of Exchange in Archaic Societies |year=1970 |publisher=Cohen &amp; West |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiner"&gt;{{cite book |last=Weiner |first=Annette |title=Inalienable Possessions: The Paradox of Keeping-while-Giving |year=1992 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gift exchange is frequently "[[Embeddedness|embedded]]" in political, kin, or religious institutions, and therefore does not constitute an "economic" system per se.&lt;ref name="gregory"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=Chris |title=Gifts and Commodities |year=1982 |publisher=Academic Press |location=London |pages=6–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Property and alienability===
Gift-giving is a form of transfer of property rights over particular objects. The nature of those property rights varies from society to society, from culture to culture, and are not universal. The nature of gift-giving is thus altered by the type of property regime in place.&lt;ref name="hann"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hann |first=C.M. |title=Property Relations: Renewing the Anthropological Tradition |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bundle of rights|Property is not a thing]], but a relationship amongst people about things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sider |first=Gerald M. |title=The Ties That Bind: Culture and Agriculture, Property and Propriety in the Newfoundland Village Fishery |journal=Social History |year=1980 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=2–3, 17 |doi=10.1080/03071028008567469}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Chris Hann]], property is a social relationship that governs the conduct of people with respect to the use and disposition of things. Anthropologists analyze these relationships in terms of a variety of actors' (individual or corporate) "[[bundle of rights]]" over objects.&lt;ref name="hann" /&gt; An example is the current debates around [[intellectual property right]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coleman |first=Gabriella |title=The Political Agnosticism of Free and Open Source Software and the Inadvertent Politics of Contrast |journal=Anthropological Quarterly |year=2004 |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=507–19 |doi=10.1353/anq.2004.0035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levitt |first=Leon |title=On property, Intellectual Property, the Culture of Property, and Software Pirating |journal=Anthropology of Work Review |year=1987 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=7–9 |doi=10.1525/awr.1987.8.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Jonathan |journal=American Ethnologist |year=1999 |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=1001–2 |doi=10.1525/ae.1999.26.4.1001 |title=The Cultural Life of Intellectual Properties: Authorship, Appropriation, and the Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aragon |first=Lorraine |author2=James Leach |title=Arts and Owners: Intellectual property law and the politics of scale in Indonesian Arts |journal=American Ethnologist |year=2008 |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=607–31 |doi=10.1111/j.1548-1425.2008.00101.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coombe |first=Rosemary J. |title=Cultural and Intellectual Properties: Occupying the Colonial Imagination |journal=PoLAR: Political and Legal Anthropology Review |year=1993 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=8–15 |doi=10.1525/pol.1993.16.1.8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hann and Strangelove both give the example of a purchased book (an object that he owns), over which the author retains a "copyright". Although the book is a commodity, bought and sold, it has not been completely "alienated" from its creator who maintains a hold over it; the owner of the book is limited in what he can do with the book by the rights of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chris Hann |first=Keith Hart |title=Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique |year=2011 |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strangelove |first=Michael |title=The Empire of Mind: Digital Piracy and the Anti-Capitalist Movement |year=2005 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |pages=92–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weiner has argued that the ability to give while retaining a right to the gift/commodity is a critical feature of the gifting cultures described by Malinowski and Mauss, and explains, for example, why some gifts such as Kula valuables return to their original owners after an incredible journey around the Trobriand islands. The gifts given in Kula exchange still remain, in some respects, the property of the giver.&lt;ref name="Weiner" /&gt;

In the example used above, "copyright" is one of those bundled rights that regulate the use and disposition of a book. Gift-giving in many societies is complicated because "private property" owned by an individual may be quite limited in scope (see {{format link|#The commons}} below).&lt;ref name="hann" /&gt; Productive resources, such as land, may be held by members of a corporate group (such as a lineage), but only some members of that group may have "[[Use (law)|use rights]]". When many people hold rights over the same objects gifting has very different implications than the gifting of private property; only some of the rights in that object may be transferred, leaving that object still tied to its corporate owners. Anthropologist Annette Weiner refers to these types of objects as "[[inalienable possessions]]" and to the process as "keeping while giving".&lt;ref name="Weiner" /&gt;

===Gift vs. prestation===
[[File:Kula bracelet.jpg|thumbnail|A Kula necklace, with its distinctive red shell-disc beads, from the Trobriand Islands.]]
Malinowski's study of the [[Kula ring]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Malinowski |first=Bronislaw |title=Argonauts of the Western Pacific : an account of native enterprise and adventure in the archipelagoes of Melanesian New Guinea |year=1984 |origyear=1922 |publisher=Waveland Press |location=Prospect Heights, Ill.}}&lt;/ref&gt; became the subject of debate with the French anthropologist, Marcel Mauss, author of "[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]" ("Essai sur le don", 1925).&lt;ref name="Mauss" /&gt; In Parry's view, Malinowski placed the emphasis on the exchange of goods between ''individuals'', and their non-altruistic motives for giving the gift: they expected a return of equal or greater value. Malinowski stated that [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] is an implicit part of gifting; he contended there is no such thing as the "free gift" given without expectation.&lt;ref name="parry"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parry |first=Jonathan |title=The Gift, the Indian Gift and the 'Indian Gift' |journal=Man |year=1986 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=466–69 |doi=10.2307/2803096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mauss, in contrast, emphasized that the gifts were not between individuals, but between representatives of larger collectivities. These gifts were, he argued, a "total prestation". A prestation is a service provided out of a sense of obligation, like "community service".&lt;ref name="Hann, Chris 2011 50"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hann, Chris |first=Hart, Keith |title=Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique |year=2011 |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were not simple, alienable commodities to be bought and sold, but, like the "[[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown jewels]]", embodied the reputation, history and sense of identity of a "corporate kin group", such as a line of kings. Given the stakes, Mauss asked "why anyone would give them away?" His answer was an enigmatic concept, "the spirit of the gift". Parry believes that a good part of the confusion (and resulting debate) was due to a bad translation. Mauss appeared to be arguing that a return gift is given to keep the very relationship between givers alive; a failure to return a gift ends the relationship and the promise of any future gifts.

Both Malinowski and Mauss agreed that in non-market societies, where there was no clear institutionalized economic exchange system, gift/prestation exchange served economic, kinship, religious and political functions that could not be clearly distinguished from each other, and which mutually influenced the nature of the practice.&lt;ref name="parry" /&gt;

===Inalienable possessions===
[[File:Klallam people at Port Townsend.jpg|thumb | right | Watercolor by [[James G. Swan]] depicting the [[Klallam]] people of chief [[Chetzemoka]] at [[Port Townsend]], with one of Chetzemoka's wives distributing [[potlatch]].]]
Mauss' concept of "total prestations" was further developed by Annette Weiner, who revisited Malinowski's fieldsite in the Trobriand Islands. Her critique was twofold: first, Trobriand Island society is matrilineal, and women hold a great deal of economic and political power. Their exchanges were ignored by Malinowski. Secondly, she developed Mauss' argument about reciprocity and the "spirit of the gift" in terms of "[[inalienable possessions]]: the paradox of keeping while giving."&lt;ref name="Weiner" /&gt; Weiner contrasts "moveable goods" which can be exchanged with "immoveable goods" that serve to draw the gifts back (in the Trobriand case, male Kula gifts with women's landed property). She argues that the specific goods given, like Crown Jewels, are so identified with particular groups, that even when given, they are not truly alienated. Not all societies, however, have these kinds of goods, which depend upon the existence of particular kinds of kinship groups. French anthropologist Maurice Godelier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Godelier |first=Maurice |title=The Enigma of the Gift |year=1999 |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; pushed the analysis further in "The Enigma of the Gift" (1999). Albert Schrauwers has argued that the kinds of societies used as examples by Weiner and Godelier (including the [[Kula ring]] in the Trobriands, the [[Potlatch]] of the [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]], and the [[Toraja]] of [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]]) are all characterized by ranked aristocratic kin groups that fit with [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]' model of "House Societies" (where "House" refers to both noble lineage and their landed estate). Total prestations are given, he argues, to preserve landed estates identified with particular kin groups and maintain their place in a ranked society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schrauwers |first=Albert |title=H(h)ouses, E(e)states and class: On the importance of capitals in central Sulawesi |journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde |year=2004 |volume=160 |issue=1 |pages=72–94 |doi=10.1163/22134379-90003735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reciprocity and the "spirit of the gift"===
According to [[Chris Gregory]] [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] is a dyadic exchange relationship that we characterize, imprecisely, as gift-giving. Gregory believes that one gives gifts to friends and potential enemies in order to establish a relationship, by placing them in debt. He also claimed that in order for such a relationship to persist, there must be a time lag between the gift and counter-gift; one or the other partner must always be in debt, or there is no relationship. Marshall Sahlins has stated that birthday gifts are an example of this.&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sahlins |first=Marshall |authorlink=Marshall Sahlins |title=Stone Age Economics |publisher=Aldine-Atherton |location=Chicago |year=1972 |isbn=0-202-01099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2013}} Sahlins notes that birthday presents are separated in time so that one partner feels the obligation to make a return gift; and to forget the return gift may be enough to end the relationship. Gregory has stated that without a relationship of debt, there is no reciprocity, and that this is what distinguishes a gift economy from a "true gift" given with no expectation of return (something Sahlins calls "generalized reciprocity": see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=Chris |title=Gifts and Commodities |year=1982 |publisher=Academic Press |location=London |pages=189–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marshall Sahlins]], an American cultural anthropologist, identified three main types of reciprocity in his book ''Stone Age Economics'' (1972). Gift or ''generalized reciprocity'' is the exchange of goods and services without keeping track of their exact value, but often with the expectation that their value will balance out over time. ''Balanced or Symmetrical reciprocity'' occurs when someone gives to someone else, expecting a fair and tangible return at a specified amount, time, and place. Market or ''Negative reciprocity'' is the exchange of goods and services where each party intends to profit from the exchange, often at the expense of the other. Gift economies, or generalized reciprocity, occurred within closely knit kin groups, and the more distant the exchange partner, the more balanced or negative the exchange became.&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972" /&gt;

The "generalized reciprocity" time-lag in recent years, also applies as an allowance for spontaneity and creativity that enables both parties to demonstrate love in surprising ways. In a market exchange, the giving party loses an item to gain income while the receiving party loses income to gain an item, a +1 -1 transaction that leads to 0 goodwill remaining on average. In a giving relationship, the giving party loses the item, but gains the joy of doing good for someone they appreciate, while the receiving party still gains not just something, but something that is tailored to their tastes, transaction value +1(receiver) +1(giver)  -1(giver) +1(personalization as sign of love for the receiver) for a total of +2 goodwill added to the relationship. This expanding goodwill deepens social capital exchanged in close communities and leaves a "relationship bank" for community members to tap into when they are in need of help in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Christmas wish list and giving traditions |url=https://www.dreamlist.com/best/ |website=DreamList.com |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is a core part of the culture of [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Burning_Man Burning Man].

===Charity, debt, and the "poison of the gift"===
Jonathan Parry has argued that ideologies of the "pure gift" "are most likely to arise only in highly differentiated societies with an advanced division of labour and a significant commercial sector" and need to be distinguished from the non-market "prestations" discussed above.&lt;ref name="Parry 1986 467" /&gt; Parry also underscored, using the example of charitable giving of alms in India ([[Dāna]]), that the "pure gift" of alms given with no expectation of return could be "poisonous". That is, the gift of alms embodying the sins of the giver, when given to ritually pure priests, saddled these priests with impurities that they could not cleanse themselves of. "Pure gifts", given without a return, can place recipients in debt, and hence in dependent status: the poison of the gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parry |first=Jonathan |title=The Gift, the Indian Gift and the 'Indian Gift' |journal=Man |year=1986 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=463–67 |doi=10.2307/2803096}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Graeber points out that no reciprocity is expected between unequals: if you make a gift of a dollar to a beggar, he will not give it back the next time you meet. More than likely, he will ask for more, to the detriment of his status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graeber |first=David |title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The false coin of our own dreams |year=2001 |publisher=Palgrave |location=New York |page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many who are forced by circumstances to accept charity feel stigmatized. In the [[Moka exchange|Moka]] exchange system of Papua New Guinea, where gift givers become political "big men", those who are in their debt and unable to repay with "interest" are referred to as "rubbish men".

The French writer [[Georges Bataille]], in ''La part Maudite'', uses Mauss's argument in order to construct a theory of economy: the structure of gift is the presupposition for all possible economy. Bataille is particularly interested in the potlatch as described by Mauss, and claims that its agonistic character obliges the receiver of the gift to confirm their own subjection. Gift-giving thus embodies the Hegelian dipole of master and slave within the act.

===Spheres of exchange and "economic systems"===
{{Economic systems sidebar |By coordination}}
The relationship of new market exchange systems to indigenous non-market exchange remained a perplexing question for anthropologists. [[Paul Bohannan]] argued that the Tiv of Nigeria had three [[spheres of exchange]], and that only certain kinds of goods could be exchanged in each sphere; each sphere had its own different form of special purpose money. However, the market and universal money allowed goods to be traded between spheres and thus served as an acid on established social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bohannan |first=Paul |title=The Impact of money on an African subsistence economy |journal=The Journal of Economic History |year=1959 |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=491–503 |doi=10.1017/S0022050700085946}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Parry and [[Maurice Bloch]], argued in "Money and the Morality of Exchange" (1989), that the "transactional order" through which long-term social reproduction of the family takes place has to be preserved as separate from short-term market relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parry |first=Jonathan |title=Money and the Morality of Exchange |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=28–30 |authorlink=Introduction: Money and the Morality of Exchange |author2=Maurice Bloch}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the long-term social reproduction of the family that is sacralized by religious rituals such baptisms, weddings and funerals, and characterized by gifting.

In such situations where gift-giving and market exchange were intersecting for the first time, some anthropologists contrasted them as polar opposites. This opposition was classically expressed by Chris Gregory in his book "Gifts and Commodities" (1982). Gregory argued that
{{Quote| Commodity exchange is an exchange of ''alienable'' objects between people who are in a state of reciprocal ''independence'' that establishes a ''quantitative'' relationship between the ''objects'' exchanged … Gift exchange is an exchange of ''inalienable'' objects between people who are in a state of reciprocal ''dependence'' that establishes a ''qualitative'' relationship between the ''transactors'' (emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=Chris |title=Gifts and Commodities |year=1982 |publisher=Academic Press |location=London |pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Gregory contrasts gift and commodity exchange according to five criteria:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://haubooks.org/viewbook/gifts-and-commodities/10_ch03 |title=Gifts and Commodities {{!}} Chapter III: Gifts and commodities: Circulation|website=haubooks.org|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other anthropologists, however, refused to see these different "[[Spheres of exchange|exchange spheres]]" as such polar opposites. [[Marilyn Strathern]], writing on a similar area in Papua New Guinea, dismissed the utility of the contrasting setup in "The Gender of the Gift" (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strathern |first=Marilyn |title=The Gender of the Gift: Problems with Women and Problems with Society in Melanesia |year=1988 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |pages=143–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wedding rings.jpg|thumbnail|Wedding rings: commodity or pure gift?]]
Rather than emphasize how particular kinds of objects are either gifts or commodities to be traded in '''restricted''' spheres of exchange, [[Arjun Appadurai]] and others began to look at how objects flowed between these spheres of exchange (i.e. how objects can be converted into gifts and then back into commodities). They refocussed attention away from the character of the human relationships formed through exchange, and placed it on "the social life of things" instead. They examined the strategies by which an object could be "[[Commodity Pathway Diversion|singularized]]" (made unique, special, one-of-a-kind) and so withdrawn from the market. A marriage ceremony that transforms a purchased ring into an irreplaceable family heirloom is one example; the heirloom, in turn, makes a perfect gift. Singularization is the reverse of the seemingly irresistible process of commodification. They thus show how all economies are a constant flow of material objects that enter and leave specific exchange spheres. A similar approach is taken by Nicholas Thomas, who examines the same range of cultures and the anthropologists who write on them, and redirects attention to the "entangled objects" and their roles as both gifts and commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Nicholas |title=Entangled Objects: Exchange, Material Culture, and Colonialism in the Pacific |year=1991 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proscriptions===
Many societies have strong prohibitions against turning gifts into trade or [[Capital (economics)|capital]] goods. Anthropologist Wendy James writes that among the [[Uduk people]] of northeast [[Africa]] there is a strong custom that any gift that crosses subclan boundaries must be consumed rather than invested.&lt;ref name="Lewis Hyde"&gt;''Lewis Hyde: The Gift: Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property'', pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} For example, an animal given as a gift must be eaten, not bred. However, as in the example of the Trobriand armbands and necklaces, this "perishing" may not consist of consumption as such, but of the gift moving on. In other societies, it is a matter of giving some other gift, either directly in return or to another party. To keep the gift and not give another in exchange is reprehensible. "In folk tales," [[Lewis Hyde]] remarks, "the person who tries to hold onto a gift usually dies."&lt;ref name="Lewis Hyde" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

[[Daniel Everett]], a linguist who studied a small tribe of hunter-gatherers in Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Everett |first=Daniel L. |title=Cultural Constraints on Grammar and Cognition in Pirahã: Another Look at the Design Features of Human Language |journal=Current Anthropology |date=Aug–Oct 2005 |volume=46 |issue=4 |doi=10.1086/431525 |pages=621–646}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that, while they are aware of [[food preservation]] using drying, salting, and so forth, they reserve the use of these techniques for items for barter outside of the tribe. Within the group, when someone has a successful hunt they immediately share the abundance by inviting others to enjoy a feast. Asked about this practice, one hunter laughed and replied, "I store meat in the belly of my brother."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Curren |first=Erik |title=Charles Eisenstein wants to devalue your money to save the economy |url=http://transitionvoice.com/2012/08/charles-eisenstein-wants-to-devalue-your-money-to-save-the-economy/ |publisher=Transition Voice |accessdate=9 February 2013 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eisenstein |first=Charles |title=The Ascent of Humanity |url=http://www.ascentofhumanity.com/chapter2-7.php |accessdate=9 February 2013 |authorlink=Charles Eisenstein |chapter=2 |isbn=978-0977622207 |publisher=Pananthea Press |location=Harrisburg, PA |year=2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207030351/http://www.ascentofhumanity.com/chapter2-7.php |archive-date=2013-02-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carol Stack's ''All Our Kin'' describes both the positive and negative sides of a network of obligation and gratitude effectively constituting a gift economy. Her narrative of [[The Flats, Chicago, Illinois|The Flats]], a poor [[Chicago]] neighborhood, tells in passing the story of two sisters who each came into a small inheritance. One sister hoarded the inheritance and prospered materially for some time, but was alienated from the community. Her marriage ultimately broke up, and she integrated herself back into the community largely by giving gifts. The other sister fulfilled the community's expectations, but within six weeks had nothing material to show for the inheritance but a coat and a pair of shoes.&lt;ref name="Lewis Hyde" /&gt;{{rp|75–76}}

== Case studies: Prestations ==

Marcel Mauss was careful to distinguish "gift economies" (reciprocity) in market-based societies from the "total prestations" given in non-market societies. A prestation is a service provided out of a sense of obligation, like "community service".&lt;ref name="Hann, Chris 2011 50" /&gt; These "prestations" bring together domains that we would differentiate as political, religious, legal, moral and economic, such that the exchange can be seen to be [[Embeddedness|embedded]] in non-economic social institutions. These prestations are frequently competitive, as in the [[potlatch]], [[Kula ring|Kula exchange]], and [[Moka exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graeber |first=David |title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value |year=2001 |publisher=Palgrave |location=Basingstoke |page=153 |authorlink=David Graeber |chapter=Marcel Mauss Revisited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moka exchange in Papua New Guinea: competitive exchange ===
{{main|Moka exchange}}
[[File:Papua New Guinea map.png|thumbnail|[[Mount Hagen]], Papua New Guinea.]]
The ''Moka'' is a highly ritualized system of exchange in the [[Mount Hagen]] area, [[Papua New Guinea]], that has become emblematic of the anthropological concepts of "gift economy" and of "[[Big man (anthropology)|big man]]" political system. Moka are reciprocal gifts of pigs through which social status is achieved. Moka refers specifically to the increment in the size of the gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=C.A. |title=Gifts and Commodities |year=1982 |publisher=Academic Press |location=London |pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social status in the "big man" political system is the result of giving larger gifts than one has received. These gifts are of a limited range of goods, primarily pigs and scarce pearl shells from the coast. To return the same amount as one has received in a moka is simply the repayment of a debt, strict reciprocity.  Moka is the extra. To some, this represents interest on an investment. However, one is not bound to provide moka, only to repay the debt. One adds moka to the gift to increase one's prestige, and to place the receiver in debt. It is this constant renewal of the debt relationship which keeps the relationship alive; a debt fully paid off ends further interaction. Giving more than one receives establishes a reputation as a Big man, whereas the simple repayment of debt, or failure to fully repay, pushes one's reputation towards the other end of the scale, "rubbish man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=C.A. |title=Gifts and Commodities |year=1982 |publisher=Academic Press |location=London |pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gift exchange thus has a political effect; granting prestige or status to one, and a sense of debt in the other. A political system can be built out of these kinds of status relationships. Sahlins characterizes the difference between status and rank by highlighting that Big man is not a role; it is a status that is shared by many. The Big man is "not a prince ''of'' men", but a "prince among men". The "big man" system is based upon the ability to persuade, rather than command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sahlins |first=Marshall |title=Poor Man, Rich Man, Big-Man, Chief: Political Types in Melanesia and Polynesia |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |year=1963 |volume=5 |series=3 |pages=294–7 |doi=10.1017/s0010417500001729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toraja funerals: the politics of meat distribution ===
[[File:Toraja house.jpg|thumb|right|Three ''tongkonan'' noble houses in a Torajan village.]]
[[File:Tana Toraja, Salu funeral (6823105668).jpg|thumbnail|Ritual slaughter of gift cattle at a funeral.]]
The [[Toraja]] are an [[ethnic group]] [[indigenous people|indigenous]] to a mountainous region of [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toraja.go.id/sosial.php |title=Tana Toraja official website |accessdate=2006-10-04 |language=Indonesian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529201932/http://www.toraja.go.id/sosial.php |archivedate=May 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torajans are renowned for their elaborate funeral rites, burial sites carved into rocky cliffs, and massive peaked-roof traditional houses known as ''[[tongkonan]]'' which are owned by noble families. Membership in a tongkonan is inherited by all descendants of its founders. Any individual Toraja may thus be a member of numerous tongkonan, as long as they contribute to its ritual events. Membership in a tongkonan carries benefits, such as the right to rent some of its rice fields.&lt;ref name="Schrauwers8386"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schrauwers |first=Albert |title=H(h)ouses, E(e)states and class; On the importance of capitals in central Sulawesi |journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde |year=2004 |volume=160 |issue=1 |pages=83–86 |doi=10.1163/22134379-90003735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toraja funeral rites are important social events, usually attended by hundreds of people and lasting for several days. The funerals are like "big men" competitions where all the descendants of a tongkonan will compete through gifts of sacrificial cattle. Participants will have invested cattle with others over the years, and will now draw on those extended networks to make the largest gift. The winner of the competition becomes the new owner of the tongkonan and its rice lands. They display all the cattle horns from their winning sacrifice on a pole in front of the tongkonan.&lt;ref name="Schrauwers8386" /&gt;

The Toraja funeral differs from the "big man" system in that the winner of the "gift" exchange gains control of the Tongkonan's property. It creates a clear social hierarchy between the noble owners of the tongkonan and its land, and the commoners who are forced to rent their fields from him. Since the owners of the tongkonan gain rent, they are better able to compete in the funeral gift exchanges, and their social rank is more stable than the "big man" system.&lt;ref name="Schrauwers8386" /&gt;

== Charity and alms giving ==
{{main|Alms}}
Anthropologist [[David Graeber]] has argued that the great world religious traditions on charity and gift giving emerged almost simultaneously during the "[[Axial age]]" (the period between 800 and 200 BCE), which was the same period in which coinage was invented and market economies established on a continental basis. These religious traditions on charity emerge, he argues, as a reaction against the nexus formed by coinage, slavery, military violence and the market (a "military-coinage" complex). The new world religions, including [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] all sought to preserve "human economies" where money served to cement social relationships rather than purchase things (including people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graeber |first=David |title=Debt: The first 5,000 years |year=2011 |publisher=Melville House |location=New York |pages=223–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charity and alms-giving are religiously sanctioned voluntary gifts given without expectation of return. Case studies demonstrate, however, that such gift-giving is not necessarily altruistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bowie |first=Katherine |title=The Alchemy of Charity: Of class and Buddhism in Northern Thailand |journal=American Anthropologist |year=1998 |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=469–81 |doi=10.1525/aa.1998.100.2.469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Merit making in Buddhist Thailand ===
[[File:Young monk.jpg|thumb|Young Burmese monk]]
[[Theravada Buddhism]] in [[Thailand]] emphasizes the importance of giving alms ([[merit making]]) without any intention of return (a pure gift), which is best accomplished according to doctrine, through gifts to monks and temples. The emphasis is on the selfless gifting which "earns merit" (and a future better life) for the giver rather than on the relief of the poor or the recipient on whom the gift is bestowed. Bowie's research among poorer Thai farmers shows, however, that this ideal form of gifting is limited to the rich who have the resources to endow temples, or sponsor the ordination of a monk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bowie |first=Katherine |title=The Alchemy of Charity: Of class and Buddhism in Northern Thailand |journal=American Anthropologist |year=1998 |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=473–4 |doi=10.1525/aa.1998.100.2.469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monks come from these same families, hence the doctrine of pure gifting to monks has a class element to it. Poorer farmers place much less emphasis on merit making through gifts to monks and temples. They equally validate gifting to beggars. Poverty and famine is widespread amongst these poorer groups, and by validating gift-giving to beggars, they are in fact demanding that the rich see to their needs in hard times. Bowie sees this as an example of a [[moral economy]] (see below) in which the poor use gossip and reputation as a means of resisting elite exploitation and pressuring them to ease their "this world" suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bowie |first=Katherine |title=The Alchemy of Charity: Of class and Buddhism in Northern Thailand |journal=American Anthropologist |year=1998 |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=475–7 |doi=10.1525/aa.1998.100.2.469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charity: Dana in India ===
[[Dāna]] is a form of religious charity given in Hindu India. The gift is said to embody the sins of the giver (the "poison of the gift"), who it frees of evil by transmitting it to the recipient. The merit of the gift is dependent on finding a worthy recipient such as a [[Brahmin]] priest. Priests are supposed to be able to digest the sin through ritual action and transmit the gift with increment to someone of greater worth. It is imperative that this be a true gift, with no reciprocity, or the evil will return. The gift is not intended to create any relationship between donor and recipient, and there should never be a return gift. Dana thus transgresses the so-called universal "norm of reciprocity".&lt;ref name="Parry 1986 467" /&gt;

=== The Children of Peace in Canada ===
[[File:SharonTemple.jpg|thumbnail|right|Sharon Temple]]
[[The Children of Peace]] (1812–1889) were a utopian Quaker sect. Today, they are primarily remembered for the [[Sharon Temple]], a national historic site and an architectural symbol of their vision of a society based on the values of peace, equality and social justice.  They built this ornate temple to raise money for the poor, and built the province of Ontario's first shelter for the homeless. They took a lead role in the organization of the province's first co-operative, [[Farmers' Storehouse Company|the Farmers' Storehouse]], and opened the province's first credit union. The group soon found that the charity they tried to distribute from their Temple fund endangered the poor. Accepting charity was a sign of indebtedness, and the [[Imprisonment for debt (Upper Canada)|debtor could be jailed without trial at the time]]; this was the "poison of the gift". They thus transformed their charity fund into a credit union that loaned small sums like today's micro-credit institutions. This is an example of [[Commodity pathway diversion|singularization]], as money was transformed into charity in the Temple ceremony, then shifted to an alternative exchange sphere as a loan. Interest on the loan was then singularized, and transformed back into charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schrauwers |first=Albert |title='Union is Strength': W.L. Mackenzie, The Children of Peace and the Emergence of Joint Stock Democracy in Upper Canada |year=2009 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |pages=97–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gifting as non-commodified exchange in market societies==
Non-commodified spheres of exchange exist in relation to the market economy. They are created through the processes of [[Commodity pathway diversion|singularization]] as specific objects are de-commodified for a variety of reasons and enter an alternative [[Spheres of exchange|exchange sphere]]. As in the case of organ donation, this may be the result of an ideological opposition to the "traffic in humans". In other cases, it is in opposition to the market and to its perceived greed. It may, however, be used by corporations as a means of creating a sense of endebtedness and loyalty in customers. Modern marketing techniques often aim at infusing commodity exchange with features of gift exchange, thus blurring the presumably sharp distinction between gifts and commodities.&lt;ref&gt;Rus, Andrej (2008).[http://www.drustvo-antropologov.si/AN/PDF/2008_1/Anthropological_Notebooks_XIV_1_Rus.pdf "'Gift vs. commoditiy' debate revisited".

=== Organ transplant networks, sperm and blood banks ===
[[File:"YOUR BLOOD CAN SAVE HIM" - NARA - 516245.tif|thumbnail|Blood donation poster, WWII.]]
{{main|Organ gifting}}
Market economies tend to reduce everything – "including human beings, their labor, and their reproductive capacity"{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} – to the status of commodities. The rapid transfer of organ transplant technology to the third world has created a trade in organs, with sick bodies travelling to the global south for transplants, and healthy organs from the global south being transported to the richer global north, "creating a kind of 'Kula ring' of bodies and body parts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schepper-Hughes |first=Nancy |title=The Global Traffic in Human Organs |journal=Current Anthropology |year=2000 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=193 |doi=10.1086/300123}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all commodities can also be singularized, or de-commodified, and transformed into gifts. In North America, it is illegal to sell organs, and citizens are enjoined to give the "gift of life" and donate their organs in an organ gift economy.&lt;ref name="Schepper-Hughes 2000 191–224"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schepper-Hughes |first=Nancy |title=The Global Traffic in Human Organs |journal=Current Anthropology |year=2000 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=191–224 |doi=10.1086/300123}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this gift economy is a "medical realm rife with potent forms of mystified commodification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sharp |first=Lesley A. |title=The Commodification of the Body and its Parts |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |year=2000 |volume=29 |page=303 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.29.1.287}}&lt;/ref&gt; This multimillion-dollar medical industry requires clients to pay steep fees for the gifted organ, which creates clear class divisions between those who donate (frequently in the global south) and will never benefit from gifted organs, and those who can pay the fees and thereby receive the gifted organ.&lt;ref name="Schepper-Hughes 2000 191–224" /&gt;

Unlike body organs, blood and semen have been successfully and legally commodified in the United States. Blood and semen can thus be commodified, but once consumed are "the gift of life". Although both can be either donated or sold, are perceived as the "gift of life" yet are stored in "banks", and can be collected only under strict government regulated procedures, recipients very clearly prefer altruistically donated semen and blood. Ironically, the blood and semen samples with the highest market value are those that have been altruistically donated. The recipients view semen as storing the potential characteristics of their unborn child in its DNA, and value altruism over greed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tober |first=Diane M. |title=Semen as Gift, Semen as Goods: Reproductive Workers and the Market in Altruism |journal=Body &amp; Society |year=2001 |volume=7 |issue=2-3 |pages=137–60 |doi=10.1177/1357034x0100700205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, gifted blood is the archetype of a pure gift relationship because the donor is only motivated by a desire to help others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Titmuss |first=Richard |title=The Gift Relationship: From human blood to social policy |year=1997 |publisher=The New Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Copyleft vs copyright: the gift of "free" speech ===
{{main|Copyleft}}
Engineers, scientists and software developers have created [[free software]] projects such as the [[Linux kernel]] and the [[GNU]] operating system. They are prototypical examples for the gift economy's prominence in the technology sector, and its active role in instating the use of [[Permissive free software licence|permissive free software]] and [[copyleft]] licenses, which allow free reuse of software and knowledge. Other examples include [[file-sharing]], [[open access]], [[Unlicense|unlicense]]d software ... etc.

=== Points: Loyalty programs ===
{{main|Loyalty program}}
Many retail organizations have "gift" programs meant to encourage customer loyalty to their establishments. Bird-David and Darr refer to these as hybrid "mass-gifts" which are neither gift nor commodity. They are called mass-gifts because they are given away in large numbers "free with purchase" in a mass-consumption environment. They give as an example two bars of soap in which one is given free with purchase: which is the commodity and which the gift? The mass-gift both affirms the distinct difference between gift and commodity while confusing it at the same time. As with gifting, mass-gifts are used to create a social relationship. Some customers embrace the relationship and gift whereas others reject the gift relationship and interpret the "gift" as a 50% off sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bird-David |first=Nurit |author2=Darr, Asaf |title=Commodity, gift and mass-gift: on gift-commodity hybrids in advanced mass consumption cultures |journal=Economy and Society |year=2009 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=304–25 |doi=10.1080/03085140902786777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free shops ===
{{main|Give-away shop}}
[[File:Give away shop utrecht inside.jpg|right|thumb|Inside [[Utrecht]] Giveaway shop. The banner reads "The earth has enough for everyone's need, but not for everyone's greed".]]
"[[Give-away shops]]", "freeshops" or "free stores" are stores where all goods are free. They are similar to [[charity shop]]s, with mostly second-hand items—only everything is available at no cost. Whether it is a [[book]], a piece of [[furniture]], a garment or a [[household]] item, it is all freely given away, although some operate a one-in, one-out–type policy (swap shops). The free store is a form of constructive [[direct action]] that provides a shopping alternative to a [[monetary]] framework, allowing people to exchange goods and services outside of a money-based economy. The anarchist [[1960s counterculture|1960s countercultural]] group [[Diggers (theatre)|The Diggers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=John Campbell McMillian |author2=Paul Buhle |title=The new left revisited |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_Ohks41z2IC&amp;pg=PA112 |accessdate=28 December 2011 |year=2003 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-976-0 |pages=112–}}&lt;/ref&gt; opened [[free stores]] which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art.&lt;ref name="Lytle_2006_213215"&gt;{{harvnb|Lytle|2006|pp=213, 215}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Diggers took their name from the original [[Diggers|English Diggers]] led by [[Gerrard Winstanley]]&lt;ref name="Digger Archives"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diggers.org/overview.htm |title=Overview: who were (are) the Diggers? |accessdate=2007-06-17 |work=The Digger Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sought to create a mini-society free of money and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="American Experience doc"&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Gail Dolgin]]; Vicente Franco |date=2007 |title=American Experience: The Summer of Love |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/love/index.html |publisher=PBS |accessdate=2007-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although free stores have not been uncommon in the United States since the 1960s, the [[freegan]] movement has inspired the establishment of more free stores. Today the idea is kept alive by the new generations of [[social centres]], anarchists and environmentalists who view the idea as an intriguing way to raise awareness about [[consumer culture]] and to promote the [[reuse]] of commodities.

===Mutual aid===
[[File:La conquête du pain.jpg|right|thumb|''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' by Peter Kropotkin, influential work which presents the economic vision of [[anarcho-communism]].]]
Many anarchists, particularly [[anarcho-primitivists]] and [[anarcho-communists]], believe that variations on a gift economy may be the key to breaking the [[cycle of poverty]]. Therefore, they often desire to refashion all of society into a gift economy. Anarcho-communists advocate a gift economy as an ideal, with neither money, nor markets, nor central planning. This view traces back at least to [[Peter Kropotkin]], who saw in the hunter-gatherer tribes he had visited the paradigm of "[[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]]".&lt;ref&gt;Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1955 paperback (reprinted 2005), includes Kropotkin's 1914 preface, Foreword and Bibliography by Ashley Montagu, and The Struggle for Existence, by Thomas H. Huxley ed.). Boston: Extending Horizons Books, Porter Sargent Publishers. {{ISBN|0-87558-024-6}}. Project Gutenberg e-text, Project LibriVox audiobook&lt;/ref&gt; In place of a market, [[anarcho-communists]], such as those who inhabited some Spanish villages in the 1930s, support a currency-less gift economy where goods and services are produced by workers and distributed in community stores where everyone (including the workers who produced them) is essentially entitled to consume whatever they want or need as payment for their production of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;[Augustin Souchy, "A Journey Through Aragon," in [[Sam Dolgoff]] (ed.), [[The Anarchist Collectives]], ch. 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

As an intellectual abstraction, mutual aid was developed and advanced by [[mutualism (movement)|mutualism]] or labor [[insurance]] systems and thus [[trade union]]s, and has been also used in [[cooperatives]] and other [[civil society]] movements. Typically, mutual-aid groups will be free to join and participate in, and all activities will be [[Voluntariness|voluntary]]. They are often structured as [[Non-hierarchical Organization|non-hierarchical]], [[Bureaucracy|non-bureaucratic]] [[non-profit organizations]], with members controlling all resources and no external financial or professional support. They are member-led and member-organized. They are egalitarian in nature, and designed to support [[participatory democracy]], [[Social equality|equality]] of member status and power, and shared [[leadership]] and [[Consensus decision-making|cooperative decision-making]]. Members' external societal status is considered irrelevant inside the group: status in the group is conferred by participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Francis J. |title=Canadian encyclopedia of social work |year=2005 |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |location=Waterloo, Ont. |isbn=0889204365 |pages=337–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral economy===
English historian [[E.P. Thompson]] wrote of the [[moral economy]] of the poor in the context of widespread English food riots in the English countryside in the late eighteenth century. According to Thompson these riots were generally peaceable acts that demonstrated a common political culture rooted in feudal rights to "set the price" of essential goods in the market. These peasants held that a traditional "fair price" was more important to the community than a "free" market price and they punished large farmers who sold their surpluses at higher prices outside the village while there were still those in need within the village. A moral economy is thus an attempt to preserve an alternative exchange sphere from market penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Edward P. |title=Customs in Common |year=1991 |publisher=New Press |location=New York |pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Edward P. |title=Customs in Common |year=1991 |publisher=New Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of peasants with a non-capitalist cultural mentality using the market for their own ends has been linked to subsistence agriculture and the need for subsistence insurance in hard times. James C. Scott points out, however, that those who provide this subsistence insurance to the poor in bad years are wealthy patrons who exact a political cost for their aid; this aid is given to recruit followers. The concept of moral economy has been used to explain why peasants in a number of colonial contexts, such as the Vietnam War, have rebelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=James C. |title=The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and subsistence in Southeast Asia |year=1976 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The commons===
{{main|Commons}}

Some may confuse common property regimes with gift exchange systems. "Commons" refers to the cultural and natural resources accessible to all members of a society, including natural materials such as air, water, and a habitable earth. These resources are held in common, not owned privately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bollier |first=David |authorlink=David Bollier |year=2002 |title=Reclaiming the commons |journal=Boston Review |url=http://bostonreview.net/BR27.3/bollier.html |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resources held in common can include everything from [[natural resource]]s and [[common land]] to [[software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berry |first=David |date=21 February 2005 |title=The commons |journal=[[Free Software Magazine]] |url=http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/commons_as_ideas |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commons contains [[public property]] and [[private property]], over which people have certain traditional rights. When commonly held property is transformed into private property this process alternatively is termed "[[enclosure]]" or more commonly, "privatization". A person who has a right in, or over, common land jointly with another or others is called a commoner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/commoner |title=Commoner |last=Anon |publisher=Farlex Inc |accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of important aspects that can be used to describe true commons. The first is that the commons cannot be [[commodified]] – if they are, they cease to be commons. The second aspect is that unlike private property, the commons are inclusive rather than exclusive – their nature is to share ownership as widely, rather than as narrowly, as possible. The third aspect is that the assets in commons are meant to be preserved regardless of their [[return of capital]]. Just as we receive them as a shared right, so we have a duty to pass them on to future generations in at least the same condition as we received them. If we can add to their value, so much the better, but at a minimum we must not degrade them, and we certainly have no right to destroy them.&lt;ref name="Capitalism3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Barnes |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Barnes (entrepreneur) |title=Capitalism 3.0: A Guide to Reclaiming the Commons |publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers |series= |year=2006 |doi= |isbn=978-1-57675-361-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The new intellectual commons: free content===
{{main|Free content}}
Free content,  or free information, is any kind of functional work, [[Work of art|artwork]], or other creative [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] that meets the definition of a [[Definition of Free Cultural Works|free cultural work]].&lt;ref&gt;http://freecontentdefinition.org/Definition&lt;/ref&gt; A free cultural work is one which has no significant [[legal]] restriction on people's freedom:
* to use the content and benefit from using it,
* to study the content and apply what is learned,
* to make and distribute copies of the content,
* to change and improve the content and distribute these derivative works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freedomdefined.org/Definition |title=Definition of Free Cultural Works |accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-doc.html |title=Free Software and Free Manuals |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |last=Stallman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Stallman |date=November 13, 2008 |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although different definitions are used, free content is legally similar if not identical to [[open content]]. An analogy is the use of the rival terms [[alternative terms for free software|free software and open source]] which describe ideological differences rather than legal ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html |title=Why Open Source misses the point of Free Software |last=Stallman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Stallman |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free content encompasses all works in the [[public domain]] and also those [[copyright]]ed works whose [[license]]s honor and uphold the freedoms mentioned above. Because copyright law in most countries by default grants copyright holders [[monopoly|monopolistic control]] over their creations, copyright content must be explicitly declared free, usually by the referencing or inclusion of licensing statements from within the work.

Though a work which is in the public domain because its copyright has expired is considered free, it can become non-free again if the copyright law changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080716-eu-caves-to-aging-rockers-wants-45-year-copyright-extension.html |title=EU caves to aging rockers, wants 45-year copyright extension |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |last=Anderson |first=Nate |date=July 16, 2008 |accessdate=August 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information is particularly suited to gift economies, as information is a [[nonrival good]] and can be gifted at practically no cost (zero [[marginal cost]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mackaay |first=Ejan |title=Economic Incentives in Markets for Information and Innovation |journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy |year=1990 |volume=13 |issue=909 |pages=867–910}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heylighen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Heylighen |first=Francis |authorlink=Francis Heylighen |editor=B. Lutterbeck |editor2=M. Barwolff |editor3=R. A. Gehring |title=Open Source Jahrbuch |publisher=Lehmanns Media |year=2007 |chapter=Why is Open Access Development so Successful?}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, there is often an advantage to using the same software or data formats as others, so even from a selfish perspective, it can be advantageous to give away one's information.

====Filesharing====
[[Markus Giesler]] in his [[ethnography]] ''Consumer Gift System'', described music downloading as a system of social solidarity based on gift transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Markus Giesler, [http://sonner.antville.org/files/giesler+-+napster+gift/ Consumer Gift Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Internet]] access spread, file sharing became extremely popular among users who could contribute and receive files on line. This form of gift economy was a model for online services such as [[Napster]], which focused on music sharing and was later sued for [[copyright infringement]]. Nonetheless, online file sharing persists in various forms such as [[Bit Torrent]] and [[Direct download link]].  A number of communications and intellectual property experts such as [[Henry Jenkins]] and [[Lawrence Lessig]] have described file-sharing as a form of gift exchange which provides numerous benefits to artists and consumers alike. They have argued that file sharing fosters community among distributors and allows for a more equitable distribution of media.

====Free and open-source software====
In his essay "[[Homesteading the Noosphere]]", noted [[computer programmer]] [[Eric S. Raymond]] said that [[free and open-source software]] developers have created "a 'gift culture' in which participants compete for prestige by giving time, energy, and creativity away".&lt;ref&gt;http://catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/&lt;/ref&gt; Prestige gained as a result of contributions to source code fosters a social network for the developer; the [[free software movement|open source community]] will recognize the developer's accomplishments and intelligence. Consequently, the developer may find more opportunities to work with other developers. However, prestige is not the only motivator for the giving of lines of code. An anthropological study of the [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] community, as part of a [[Master's degree|master's]] study at the University of North Texas in 2010-11, found that common reasons given by contributors were "learning for the joy of learning and collaborating with interesting and smart people". Motivation for personal gain, such as career benefits, was more rarely reported. Many of those surveyed said things like, "Mainly I contribute just to make it work for me", and "programmers develop software to 'scratch an itch{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Suehle |first=Ruth |title=An anthropologist's view of an open source community |url=http://opensource.com/life/11/1/anthropologists-view-open-source-community |publisher=opensource.com |accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Institute of Infonomics at the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands reported in 2002 that in addition to the above, large corporations, and they specifically mentioned [[IBM]], also spend large annual sums employing developers specifically for them to contribute to open source projects. The firms' and the employees' motivations in such cases are less clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Free/Libre and Open Source Software:  Survey and Study |url=http://flossproject.org/report/Final0.htm |publisher=International Institute of Infonomics, University of Maastricht and Berlecon Research GmbH |year=2002 |accessdate=19 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821233230/http://flossproject.org/report/Final0.htm |archivedate=21 August 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[Linux]] community often speak of their community as a gift economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Matzan |first=Jem |title=The gift economy and free software |url=http://archive09.linux.com/feature/36554 |date=5 June 2004 |accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IT research firm IDC valued the Linux kernel at $18 billion USD in 2007 and projected its value at $40 billion USD in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cioupdate.com/news/article.php/3660141/IDC-Linux-Ecosystem-Worth-40-Billion-by-2010.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Debian]] [[Linux distribution|distribution]] of the [[GNU]]/Linux operating system offers over 37,000 free open-source software packages via their AMD64 repositories alone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch02.en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collaborative works====
Collaborative works are works created by an open community. For example, [[Wikipedia]]{{spaced ndash}}a free online encyclopedia{{spaced ndash}}features millions of articles developed collaboratively, and almost none of its many authors and editors receive any direct material reward.&lt;ref&gt;D. Anthony, S. W. Smith, and T. Williamson, "[http://web.mit.edu/iandeseminar/Papers/Fall2005/anthony.pdf Explaining quality in internet collective goods: zealots and good samaritans in the case of ''Wikipedia'']", THanover : Dartmouth College, Technical Report, November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/reports/TR2007-606.pdf |title=The Quality of Open Source Production: Zealots and Good Samaritans in the Case of ''Wikipedia'' |first1=Denise |last1=Anthony |first2=Sean W. |last2=Smith |first3=Tim |last3=Williamson |journal=Technical Report TR2007-606 |publisher=Dartmouth College |date=April 2007 |accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a gift economy has played a large role in works of fiction about alternative societies, especially in works of [[science fiction]]. Examples include:
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
* ''[[News from Nowhere]]'' (1890) by [[William Morris]] is a utopian novel about a society which operates on a gift economy.
* ''[[The Great Explosion]]'' (1962) by [[Eric Frank Russell]] describes the encounter of a military survey ship and a [[Gandhi]]an pacifist society that operates as a gift economy.
* ''[[The Dispossessed]]'' (1974) by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] is a novel about a gift economy society that had exiled themselves from their ([[capitalism|capitalist]]) homeplanet.
* The [[Mars trilogy]], a series of books written by [[Kim Stanley Robinson]] in the 1990s, suggests that new human societies that develop away from [[Earth]] could migrate toward a gift economy.
* The movie ''[[Pay It Forward (film)|Pay It Forward]]'' (2000) centers on a schoolboy who, for a school project, comes up with the idea of doing a good deed for another and then asking the recipient to "pay it forward". Although the phrase "gift economy" is never explicitly mentioned, the scheme would, in effect, create one.
* ''[[Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom]]'' (2003) by [[Cory Doctorow]] describes future society where rejuvenation and body-enhancement have made death obsolete, and material goods are no longer scarce, resulting in a [[reputation]]-based ([[whuffie]]) economic system.
* ''[[Wizard's Holiday]]'' (2003) by [[Diane Duane]] describes two young wizards visiting a utopian-like planet whose economy is based on gift-giving and mutual support.
* ''[[Voyage from Yesteryear]]'' (1982) by [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]] describes a society of the [[Embryo space colonization|embryo colonists]] of [[Alpha Centauri]] who have a post-scarcity gift economy.
* ''Cradle of Saturn'' (1999) and its sequel ''The Anguished Dawn'' (2003) by James P. Hogan describe a colonization effort on [[Saturn]]'s largest satellite. Both describe the challenges involved in adopting a new economic paradigm.
* [[Science fiction]] author [[Bruce Sterling]] wrote a story, ''Maneki-neko'', in which the cat-paw gesture is the sign of a secret AI-based gift economy.

[[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolutism]]
*{{Term|term= Enlightened absolutism |content= [[Enlightened absolutism]] }}{{defn|1= a form of governing by rulers who were influenced by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (18th-century and early 19th-century Europe). }}
*{{Term|term= Moral absolutism |content= [[Moral absolutism]] }}{{defn|1= the position that there are absolute standards against which moral questions can be judged, and that certain actions are right or wrong, regardless of the context of the act. }}
*{{Term|term= Political absolutism |content= [[Political absolutism]] }}{{defn|1= a political theory that argues that one person should hold all power. }}
{{Term|term= Absurdism |content= [[Absurdism]] }}{{defn|1= [[philosophy]] stating that the efforts of man to find meaning in the [[universe]] will ultimately fail because no such meaning exists (at least in relation to man). Absurdism is related to [[existentialism]], though should not be confused with it, nor [[nihilism]]. }}
{{Term|term= Accidentalism |content= [[Tychism|Accidentalism]] }}{{defn|1= any system of thought that denies the causal nexus and maintains that events succeed one another haphazardly or by chance (not in the mathematical but in the popular sense). In [[metaphysics]], accidentalism denies the doctrine that everything occurs or results from a definite cause. In this connection it is synonymous with [[tychism]] (ruxi, chance), a term used by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] for the theories that make chance an objective factor in the process of the Universe.}}
{{Term|term= Acosmism |content= [[Acosmism]] }}{{defn|1= in contrast to [[pantheism]], denies the reality of the [[universe]], seeing it as ultimately illusory, (the prefix "a-" in Greek meaning negation; like "un-" in English), and only the infinite Unmanifest Absolute as real. This [[philosophy]] begins with the recognition that there is only one Reality, which is infinite, non-dual, blissful, etc. Yet the phenomenal reality of which humans are normally aware is none of these things; it is in fact just the opposite—i.e., dualistic, finite, full of suffering and pain, and so on. And since the Absolute is the only reality, that means that everything that is not-Absolute cannot be real. Thus, according to this viewpoint, the phenomenal dualistic world is ultimately an illusion ("Maya" to use the technical Indian term), irrespective of the apparent reality it possesses at the mundane or empirical level.}}
{{Term|term= Aestheticism |content= [[Aestheticism]] }}{{defn|1= another name for the ''Aesthetic movement'', a loosely defined movement in [[art]] and [[literature]] in later 19th century [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Proponents of the movement held that art does not have any didactic purpose, it need only be beautiful. Life should copy Art. The main characteristics of the movement were: suggestion rather than statement, sensuality, massive use of symbols, and synaesthetic effects - that is, correspondence between words, colors and music.}}
{{Term|term= Agnosticism |content= [[Agnosticism]] }}{{defn|1= the [[philosophy|philosophical]] view that the truth values of certain claims — particularly [[theology|theological]] claims regarding the existence of [[monotheism|God]], [[polytheism|gods]], or [[deity|deities]] — are unknown, inherently unknowable, or incoherent, and therefore, (some agnostics may go as far to say) irrelevant to [[Meaning of life|life]]. Agnosticism, in both its strong (explicit) and weak (implicit) forms, is necessarily a non-atheist and non-theist position, though an agnostic person may also be either an atheist, a theist, or one who endorses neither position. }}
*{{Term|term= Agnostic atheism |content= [[Agnostic atheism]] }}{{defn|1= the philosophical view that encompasses both [[atheism]] and [[agnosticism]]. Due to definitional variance, an ''agnostic atheist'' does not believe in [[God]] or gods and by extension holds true: 'the existence and nonexistence of deities is currently unknown and may be absolutely unknowable', or 'knowledge of the existence and nonexistence of deities is irrelevant or unimportant', or 'abstention from claims of knowledge of the existence and nonexistence of deities is optimal'. }}
*{{Term|term= Agnostic theism |content= [[Agnostic theism]] }}{{defn|1= the philosophical view that encompasses both theism and agnosticism. An agnostic theist is one who views that the truth value of claims regarding the existence of god(s) is unknown or inherently unknowable but chooses to believe in god(s) in spite of this.  }}
*{{Term|term= Strong agnosticism |content= [[Strong agnosticism]] }}{{defn|1= also referred to as ''explicit agnosticism'' and ''positive agnosticism'', it is the view that the evidence in the universe is such that it is impossible for humans to [[knowledge|know]] whether or not any [[deity|deities]] exist. }}
*{{Term|term= Weak agnosticism |content= [[Weak agnosticism]] }}{{defn|1= the position that the evidence is such that the existence or nonexistence of [[deity|deities]] is currently [[knowledge|unknown]], but is not necessarily unknowable. Also called ''implicit agnosticism'', ''empirical agnosticism'', and ''negative agnosticism''. }}
{{Term|term= Altruism |content= [[Altruism]] }}{{defn|1= the belief that people have a moral obligation to serve others or the "greater good"; term coined by [[Auguste Comte]]. Generally opposed to ''self-interest'' or ''egoism''. }}
{{Term|term= Anarchism |content= [[Anarchism]] }}{{defn|1= in politics, any of a number of views and movements that advocate the elimination of rulership or government. Other than being opposed to the state, there is no single defining position that all anarchists hold. Compare and contrast [[libertarianism]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Anarcho-primitivism |content= [[Anarcho-primitivism]] }}{{defn|1= an [[anarchism|anarchist]] critique of the origins and progress of [[civilization]]. Primitivists argue that the shift from [[hunter-gatherer]] to [[agriculture|agricultural]] subsistence gave rise to [[social stratification]], [[coercion]], and [[Social alienation|alienation]]. They advocate a return to non-"civilized" ways of life through [[industrialisation|deindustrialisation]], abolition of [[division of labour]] or [[specialization (functional)|specialization]], and abandonment of [[technology]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Anarcho-syndicalism |content= [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] }}{{defn|1= a form of anarchism that allies itself with [[syndicalism]], that is, with [[labor union]]s, as a force for revolutionary social change. Anarcho-syndicalists seek to replace capitalism and the state with a democratically worker-managed means of production. They seek to abolish the wage system and most forms of private property. }}
{{Term|term= Animism |content= [[Animism]] }}{{defn|1= "animism" has been applied to many different philosophical systems.  This includes [[Aristotle]]'s view of the relation of soul and body held also by the [[stoics]] and [[scholastics]]. On the other hand, [[monadology]] ([[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]) has also been described as animistic. The name is most commonly applied to [[vitalism]], which makes life, or life and mind, the directive principle in evolution and growth, holding that life is not merely mechanical but that there is a directive force that guides energy without altering its amount. An entirely different class of ideas, also termed animistic, is the belief in the ''world soul'', held by [[Plato]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and others. Lastly, in discussions of religion, "animism" refers to the belief in indwelling souls or spirits, particularly so-called "primitive" religions that consider everything inhabited by spirits. }}
{{Term|term= Anthropocentrism |content= [[Anthropocentrism]] }}{{defn|1= also called '''Homocentrism''', is the practice, conscious or otherwise, of regarding the existence and/or concerns of [[human being]]s as the central fact of the [[universe]]. This is similar, but not identical, to the practice of relating all that happens in the universe to the human experience. To clarify, the first position concludes that the fact of human existence is the point of universal existence; the latter merely compares all activity to that of humanity, without making any [[teleology|teleological]] conclusions. }}
{{Term|term= Anthropomorphism |content= [[Anthropomorphism]]&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;Blackburn, Simon. ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]'', Oxford University Press, 1994. This dictionary includes an entry for this word.&lt;/ref&gt; }}{{defn|1= a form of [[personification]] (applying human or animal qualities to inanimate objects) and similar to '''prosopopoeia''' (adopting the persona of another person), is the attribution of human characteristics and qualities to non-human beings, objects, or natural phenomena. [[Animal]]s, forces of [[nature]], and unseen or unknown authors of chance are frequent subjects of anthropomorphosis. Two examples are the attribution of a human body or of human qualities generally to God (or the gods), and creating imaginary persons who are the embodiment of an abstraction such as Death, Lust, War, or the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]. }}
'''[[Antinatalism]]''' is a philosophical position that assigns a negative value to birth. Antinatalists argue that people should refrain from procreation because it is immoral. 
{{Term|term= Antinomianism |content= [[Antinomianism]] }}{{defn|1= in [[theology]] is the idea that members of a particular religious group are under no obligation to obey the [[religious law|laws]] of [[ethics]] or [[morality]] as presented by religious authorities. Antinomianism is the polar opposite of [[legalism (theology)|legalism]], the notion that obedience to a code of religious law is necessary for [[salvation]]. The term has become a point of contention among opposed religious authorities. Few groups or sects explicitly call themselves "antinomian", but the charge is often levelled by some sects against competing sects. }}
{{Term|term= Anti-realism |content= [[Anti-realism]] }}{{defn|1= any position involving either the denial of the objective reality of entities of a certain type or the insistence that humans should be [[agnosticism|agnostic]] about their real existence. Thus, people may speak of '''anti-realism''' with respect to other minds, the past, the future, [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]], [[mathematics|mathematical entities]] (such as [[natural numbers]]), [[morality|moral categories]], the material world, or even thought. }}
{{Term|term= Aristotelianism |content= [[Aristotelianism]] }}{{defn|1= tradition of [[philosophy]] that takes its defining inspiration from the work of [[Aristotle]]. Sometimes contrasted by critics with the rationalism and idealism of [[Plato]], Aristotelianism is understood by its proponents as critically developing Plato's theories. Most particularly, Aristotelianism brings Plato's ideals down to Earth as goals and goods internal to natural species that are realized in activity. This is the characteristically Aristotelian idea of [[teleology]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Neo-Aristotelianism |content= [[Neo-Aristotelianism]] }}{{defn|1= A view of literature and criticism propagated by the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]] -- [[Ronald S. Crane]], [[Elder Olson]], [[Richard McKeon]], [[Wayne Booth]], and others that means "A view of literature and criticism that takes a pluralistic attitude toward the history of literature and seeks to view literary works and critical theories intrinsically." }}
{{Term|term= Arminianism |content= [[Arminianism]] }}{{defn|1= a school of [[soteriology|soteriological]] thought in [[Protestant]] [[Christian theology]] founded by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]. Arminianism is closely related to [[Calvinism]] (or Reformed theology), and the two systems share both history and many doctrines in common. }}
{{Term|term= Asceticism |content= [[Asceticism]] }}{{defn|1= denotes a life characterised by refraining from worldly pleasures ([[austerity]]). Those who practice ascetic lifestyles often perceive their practices as [[virtue|virtuous]] and pursue them to achieve greater [[spirituality]]. In a more cynical context, ascetic may connote some form of self-mortification, ritual punishment of the body or harsh renunciation of pleasure. However, the word certainly does not necessarily imply a negative connotation. }}
{{Term|term= Ascriptivism |content= [[Ascriptivism]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ismbook.com/ascriptivism.html |title=ascriptivism |publisher=Ismbook.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}{{defn|1= "The view that human beings are to be held responsible for their actions even if determinism is true." }}
{{Term|term= Associationalism |content= [[Associationalism]] }}{{defn|1= a political project where "human welfare and liberty are both best served when as many of the affairs of a society as possible are managed by voluntary and democratically self-governing associations".&lt;ref name="Hirst112"&gt;Smith, M. K.; ''[http://www.infed.org/association/b-assoc.htm association, la vie associative and lifelong learning]'' cites Hirst, P. [[#References|References]] page 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Associationalism "gives priority to freedom in its scale of values, but it contends that such freedom can only be pursued effectively if individuals join with their fellows"&lt;ref name="Hirst112"/&gt; }}
{{Term|term= Atheism |content= [[Atheism]] }}{{defn|1= a condition of being without theistic beliefs; an absence of belief in the existence of [[deity|gods]], thus contrasting with [[theism]]. This definition includes both those who assert that there are no gods and those who have no beliefs at all regarding the existence of gods. However, narrower definitions often only qualify the former as atheism, the latter falling under the more general (but rarely used) term [[nontheism]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Agnostic atheism |content= [[Agnostic atheism]] }}{{defn|1= the philosophy that encompasses both [[atheism]] and [[agnosticism]]. Due to definitional variance, an ''agnostic atheist'' does not believe in [[God]] or gods and by extension holds true: 'the existence and nonexistence of deities is currently unknown and may be absolutely unknowable', or 'knowledge of the existence and nonexistence of deities is irrelevant or unimportant', or 'abstention from claims of knowledge of the existence and nonexistence of deities is optimal'. }}
*{{Term|term= Strong atheism |content= [[Strong atheism]] }}{{defn|1= the philosophical position that [[deity|deities]] do not exist. It is a form of [[Atheism#Implicit and explicit atheism|explicit atheism]], meaning that it consciously rejects [[theism]]. Some strong atheists also claim that the existence of any and all gods is logically impossible. Also called ''positive atheism'', ''hard atheism'' and ''gnostic atheism''. It should be noted that a strong atheist also fits the definition of a weak atheist, but that the reverse is not necessarily true: a strong atheist believes there is a lack or absence of evidence for justifying a belief in God or gods, but a weak atheist does not necessarily deny the possibility of God or god(s) existence. }}
*{{Term|term= Weak atheism |content= [[Weak atheism]] }}{{defn|1= disbelief in the [[existence]] of [[God]] or [[deity|gods]], without a commitment to the necessary non-existence of God or gods. Also referred to as ''negative atheism'' or ''implicit atheism.'' The weak atheist generally gives a broad definition of [[atheism]] as a lack or absence of evidence justifying a belief in God or gods, which defines atheism as a range of positions that [[logical consequence|entail]] non-belief, unjustified belief, [[doubt]], or denial of theism. }}
{{Term|term= Atomism |content= [[Atomism]] }}{{defn|1= the theory that all the objects in the universe are composed of very small, [[Eternity|indestructible]] elements. (This is the case for the Western [i.e., Greek] theories of atomism. Buddhists also have well-developed theories of atomism, which involve momentary, or non-eternal, atoms, that flash in and out of existence). }}
*{{Term|term= Social atomism |content= [[Atomism (social)|Social atomism]] }}{{defn|1= the point-of-view that individuals rather than social institutions and values are the proper subject of analysis since all properties of institutions and values merely accumulate from the strivings of individuals. }}
*{{Term|term= Logical atomism |content= [[Atomism (logical)|Logical atomism]] }}{{defn|1= [[Bertrand Russell]] developed [[atomism (logical)|''logical atomism'']] in an attempt to identify the atoms of thought, the pieces of thought that cannot be divided into smaller pieces of thought. }}
{{Term|term= Authoritarianism |content= [[Authoritarianism]] }}{{defn|1=an [[organization]] or a [[State (polity)|state]] that enforces strong, and sometimes oppressive measures against those in its sphere of influence, generally without attempts at gaining their consent and often not allowing feedback on its policies. In an authoritarian state, citizens are subject to state authority in many aspects of their lives, including many that other [[political philosophy|political philosophies]] would see as matters of personal choice. There are various degrees of authoritarianism; even very democratic and liberal states will show authoritarianism to some extent, for example in areas of national security. }}
{{Term|term= Automatism |content= [[Surrealist automatism|Automatism]] or Surrealist automatism }}{{defn|1= an artistic technique of spontaneous writing, drawing, or the like practiced without conscious aesthetic or moral self-censorship. }}

{{Term|term= Behavioralism |content= [[Behavioralism]] }}{{defn|1= (not to be confused with [[behaviorism]] of [[psychology]]) is an approach in [[political science]] that seeks to provide an objective, quantified approach to explaining and predicting political behavior. It is associated with the rise of the [[behavioral sciences]], modeled after the natural sciences. }}
{{Term|term= Behaviorism |content= [[Behaviorism]] }}{{defn|1= (not to be confused with [[behavioralism]] of [[political science]]) is an approach to [[psychology]] based on the proposition that behavior can be researched [[Scientific method|scientifically]] without recourse to inner mental states. It is a form of [[materialism]], denying any independent significance for the mind. Its significance for psychological treatment has been profound, making it one of the pillars of [[pharmacological]] therapy. }}
*{{Term|term= Methodological behaviorism |content= [[Methodological behaviorism]] }}{{defn|1= The objective study of third-person behavior; the data of psychology must be inter-subjectively verifiable; no [[theoretical]] prescriptions. It has been absorbed into general experimental and [[cognitive psychology]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Radical behaviorism |content= [[Radical behaviorism]] }}{{defn|1= Skinner's behaviorism; is considered radical since it expands behavioral principles to processes within the organism; in contrast to methodological behaviorism; not mechanistic or reductionist; hypothetical ([[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]]) internal states are not considered causes of behavior, phenomena must be observable at least to the individual experiencing them. [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] made use of many of radical behaviorism ideas in his study of knowing and language. }}
*{{Term|term= Logical behaviorism |content= [[Logical behaviorism]] }}{{defn|1= Established by Oxford philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]] in his book ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949). }}
*{{Term|term= Teleological behaviorism |content= [[Teleological behaviorism]] }}{{defn|1= Post-Skinnerian, purposive, close to [[microeconomics]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Interbehaviorism |content= [[Interbehaviorism]] }}{{defn|1= Founded by [[Jacob Robert Kantor]] before Skinner's writings and currently worked by L. Hayes; E. Ribes; and S. Bijou. centered in the inter behavior of organisms, field theory of behavior; emphasis on human behavior. }}
*{{Term|term= Psychological behaviorism |content= [[Psychological behaviorism]] }}{{defn|1= |content= As proposed by [[Arthur W. Staats]], it is a variety of behaviorism, based upon a program of human research involving various types of human behavior. }}
{{Term|term= Biologism |content= [[Biologism]] }}{{defn|1= (biological determination) the interpretation of humans and human life from a strictly biological point of view, and it is closely related to genetic determinism }}
{{Term|term= Buddhism |content= [[Buddhism]] }}{{defn|1= a [[dharmic religion]] and [[philosophy]] based on the teachings of the Buddha, [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhārtha Gautama]]. The basic teachings of Buddhism have to do with the nature of suffering or dissatisfaction (''dukkha'') and its avoidance through ethical principles (the Eightfold Path). Buddhism originated in [[India]], and is today largely followed in East Asia, including [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Tibet]], and [[Thailand]]. Buddhism is divided into different sects and movements, of which the largest are the [[Mahayana]], [[Theravada]], and [[Vajrayana]]. }}

{{Term|term= Capitalism |content= [[Capitalism]]&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; }}{{defn|1= an [[economic system]] in which all or most of the [[means of production]] are [[private property|privately owned]] and [[management|operated]] (usually through [[employment|employing]] [[wage]] [[labour (economics)|labour]], and for [[Profit (economics)|profit]]), and in which the [[investment]] of [[capital (economics)|capital]] and the [[Production (economics)|production]], [[logistics|distribution]] and [[price]]s of [[commodities]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] are determined mainly in a [[free market]]. Capitalism has also been called ''[[laissez-faire]] economy'', ''[[free market]] economy'', ''free enterprise system'', ''[[economic liberalism]]'', and ''economic individualism''. }}
*{{Term|term= Anarcho-capitalism |content= [[Anarcho-capitalism]] }}{{defn|1= a philosophy based on the idea of [[individual sovereignty]], and a prohibition against initiatory [[coercion]] and [[fraud]]. It sees the only just basis for [[law]] as arising from [[private property]] norms and an unlimited right of [[contract]] between sovereign individuals. From this basis, anarcho-capitalism rejects the [[State (polity)|state]] as an unjustified monopolist and aggressor against sovereign individuals, and embraces [[anti-statist]] [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]]. Anarcho-capitalists would aim to protect [[individual liberty]] and [[property]] by replacing a government monopoly, which is involuntarily funded through [[taxation]], with private, competing businesses. }}
{{Term|term= Careerism |content= [[Careerism]] }}{{defn|1= the desire to advance one's own [[career]] as a sole aim in life, often at the expense of personal and social growth or development. }}
{{Term|term= Cartesianism |content= [[Cartesianism]] }}{{defn|1= a philosophy based on the ideas and works of [[René Descartes]]. }}
{{Term|term= Christianism |content= [[Christianity|Christianism]] }}{{defn|1= another name for ''Christianity'', the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religion recognizing [[Jesus Christ]] as its founder and central figure. With more than two billion adherents, or about one-third of the total world population, it is the largest world religion. Its origins are intertwined with [[Judaism]], with which it shares much sacred lore, including the [[Old Testament]] (Hebrew Bible). Christianity is sometimes termed an [[Abrahamic religion]], along with [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]]. }}
{{Term|term= Classicism |content= [[Classicism]] }}{{defn|1= in the [[arts]], refers generally to a high regard for [[classical antiquity]], as setting standards for taste that the classicist seeks to emulate. Classicism is usually contrasted with [[romanticism]]; the art of classicism typically seeks to be formal, restrained, and [[Apollo]]nian (nothing in excess) rather than [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] (excess), in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s opposition. It can also refer to the other periods of classicism. In [[theater]], '''Classicism''' was developed by 17th century [[France|French]] [[playwright]]s from what they judged to be the rules of [[History of theater|Greek classical theater]], including the [[Classical unities]] of time, place and action. }}
{{Term|term= Cognitivism |content= [[Cognitivism (ethics)|Cognitivism]] }}{{defn|1= In [[ethics]], cognitivism is the philosophical view that ethical sentences express propositions, and hence are capable of being true or false. See [[Cognitivism (ethics)]]. More generally, cognitivism with respect to any area of discourse is the position that sentences used in that discourse are cognitive, that is, are meaningful and capable of being true or false. In [[psychology]], cognitivism is the approach to understanding the mind that argues that mental function can be understood as the 'internal' rule bound manipulation of symbols. See [[Cognitivism (psychology)]]. }}
{{Term|term= Coherentism |content= [[Coherentism]] }}{{defn|1= There are two distinct types of coherentism. One refers to the [[Truth#Coherence theory|coherence theory of truth]], which restricts true sentences to those that cohere with some specified set of sentences. Someone's belief is true [[if and only if]] it is coherent with all or most of their other beliefs. Usually, coherence is taken to imply something stronger than mere consistency. Statements that are comprehensive and meet the requirements of [[Occam's razor]] are usually to be preferred. The second type of coherentism is the belief in the coherence [[theory of justification]], an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] theory opposing [[foundationalism]] and offering a solution to the [[regress argument]]. In this epistemological capacity, it is a theory about how [[belief]] can be [[theory of justification|justified]]. }}
{{Term|term= Colbertism |content= [[Colbertism]] }}{{defn|1= a variation of [[mercantilism]], which has applied in [[France]] between 1661 and 1683 by the [[superintendent of Finances]] [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]]. }}
{{Term|term= Collectivism |content= [[Collectivism]]&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; }}{{defn|1= a theoretical or practical emphasis on the group, as opposed to (and seen by many of its opponents to be at the expense of) the individual. Some psychologists define collectivism as a syndrome of attitudes and behaviors based on the belief that the basic unit of survival lies within a group, not the individual. Collectivists typically hold that the "greater good" of the group, is more important than the good of any particular individual who is one part of that larger organization. Some collectivists argue that the individual ''incidentally'' serves his own interests by working for the benefit of the group. }}
{{Term|term= Communalism |content= [[Communalism]] }}{{defn|1= Outside of [[South Asia]], communalism involves a broad range of [[social movement]]s and [[social theories]] in some way centered upon the [[community]]. Communalism can take the form of communal living or communal property, among others. It is sometimes said to put the interests of the community above the interests of the individual, but this is usually only done on the principle that the community exists for the benefit of the individuals who participate in it, so the best way to serve the interests of the individual is through the interests of the community. }}
{{Term|term= Communism |content= [[Communism]]&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; }}{{defn|1= a theoretical system of social organization and a political movement based on common ownership of the means of production. As a political movement, communism seeks to establish a classless society. A major force in world politics since the early 20th century, modern communism is generally associated with The Communist Manifesto of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, according to which the capitalist profit-based system of private ownership is replaced by a communist society in which the means of production are communally owned, such as through a [[gift economy]]. Often this process is said initiated by the revolutionary overthrow of the bourgeoisie (see Marxism), passes through a transitional period marked by the preparatory stage of socialism (see Leninism). Pure communism has never been implemented, it remains theoretical: communism is, in Marxist theory, the end-state, or the result of state-socialism. The word is now mainly understood to refer to the political, economic, and social theory of Marxist thinkers, or life under conditions of Communist party rule. }}
{{Term|term= Communitarianism |content= [[Communitarianism]] }}{{defn|1= a group of related but distinct philosophies that began in the late 20th century, opposing aspects of liberalism and capitalism while advocating phenomena such as civil society. Not necessarily hostile to liberalism in the contemporary American sense of the word, communitarianism rather has a different emphasis, shifting the focus of interest toward communities and societies and away from the individual. The question of priority (individual or community) often has the largest impact in the most pressing ethical questions: health care, abortion, multiculturalism, hate speech, and so on. }}
{{Term|term= Compatibilism |content= [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|Compatibilism]] }}{{defn|1= also known as "soft determinism" and championed by [[David Hume|Hume]], is a theory that holds that [[free will]] and [[determinism]] are compatible. According to Hume, free will should not be understood as an absolute ability to have chosen differently under exactly the same inner and outer circumstances. Rather, it is a hypothetical ability to have chosen differently if one had been differently psychologically disposed by some different beliefs or desires. Hume also maintains that free acts are not uncaused (or mysteriously self-caused as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] would have it) but caused by people's choices as determined by their beliefs, desires, and by their characters. While a decision making process exists in Hume's determinism, this process is governed by a causal chain of events. }}
{{Term|term= Comtism |content= [[Comtism]] }}{{defn|1= [[Auguste Comte]]'s positivistic [[philosophy]] that [[metaphysics]] and [[theology]] should be replaced by a hierarchy of sciences from [[mathematics]] at the base to [[sociology]] at the top. }}
{{Term|term= Conceptualism |content= [[Conceptualism]] }}{{defn|1= a [[doctrine]] in [[philosophy]] intermediate between [[nominalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]], that [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]]s exist only within the mind and have no external or substantial [[reality]]. }}
{{Term|term= Confucianism |content= [[Confucianism]] }}{{defn|1= an East Asian ethical and philosophical system originally developed from the teachings of the early Chinese sage [[Confucius]]. It is a complex system of moral, social, political, and religious thought that has had tremendous influence on the history of Chinese civilization down to the 21st century. Some have considered it to have been the "state religion" of imperial China. }}
*{{Term|term= Neo-Confucianism |content= [[Neo-Confucianism]] }}{{defn|1= a form of Confucianism that was primarily developed during the [[Song dynasty]], as a response to the dominance of [[Taoism]] and [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhism]] at the time. Neo-Confucians such as [[Zhu Xi]] recognized that the Confucianism lacked a thorough [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] system, and so synthesized one based on previous Confucian concepts. There were many competing views within the Neo-Confucian community, but overall, a system emerged that resembled both the Buddhist and Taoist thought of the time. }}
*{{Term|term= New Confucianism |content= [[New Confucianism]] }}{{defn|1= a new movement of [[Confucianism]] since the 20th century applying Confucianism to modern times. Not to be confused with [[Neo-Confucianism]]. }}
{{Term|term= Consequentialism |content= [[Consequentialism]] }}{{defn|1= the belief that what ultimately matters in evaluating actions or policies of action are the consequences that result from choosing one action or policy rather than the alternative. }}
{{Term|term= Constructivism |content= [[Constructivist epistemology|Constructivism]] }}{{defn|1= the view that reality, or at least humans' knowledge of it, is a value-laden subjective construction rather than a passive acquisition of objective features. }}
{{Term|term= Consumerism |content= [[Consumerism]] }}{{defn|1= attachment to materialistic values or possessions }}
{{Term|term= Contextualism |content= [[Contextualism]] }}{{defn|1= a collection of views that emphasize the ''context'' in which an action, utterance or expression occurs, and argues that, in some important respect, the action, utterance or expression can only be understood within that context. Contextualist views hold that philosophically controversial concepts, such as "meaning &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt;", "knowing that &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt;", "having a reason to &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;", and possibly even "being true" or "being right" only have meaning relative to a specified context. Some philosophers hold that context-dependence may lead to [[relativism]]; nevertheless, contextualist views are increasingly popular within philosophy. }}
{{Term|term= Conventionalism |content= [[Conventionalism]] }}{{defn|1= philosophical attitude that fundamental principles of a certain kind are grounded on (explicit or implicit) agreements in society, rather than on external reality.

{{Term|term= Creationism |content= [[Creationism]]&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; }}{{defn|1= also referred to as '''creation theology''' is the belief that humans, life, the Earth, and the [[universe]] were created by a [[God|supreme being]] or [[deity]]'s [[supernatural]] intervention. The intervention may be seen either as an ''act of creation'' from nothing (''[[ex nihilo]]'') or the emergence of order from pre-existing chaos. }}
*{{Term|term= Day-age creationism |content= [[Day-age creationism]] }}{{defn|1= a type of [[Old Earth creationism]], it is an effort to reconcile Creation as presented in  [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] with modern scientific theories on the age of the Universe. It holds that the [[Hexameron|six days]] referred to in Genesis are not ordinary 24-hour days, but are much longer periods, thus interpreting Genesis as cosmic [[evolution]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Evolutionary creationism |content= [[Evolutionary creationism]] }}{{defn|1= A lesser used term for [[theistic evolution]], the general opinion that some or all classical religious teachings about [[God]] and [[creation myth|creation]] are compatible with some or all of the modern scientific understanding about biological [[evolution]]. Theistic evolution is not a [[scientific theory|theory]] in the [[Science|scientific]] sense, but a particular view about how the science of evolution relates to some religious interpretations. }}
*{{Term|term= Gap creationism |content= [[Gap creationism]] }}{{defn|1= also called ''Restitution creationism'' or ''Ruin-Reconstruction''; a particular set of Christian beliefs about the creation of the [[Universe]] and the origin of man. The concept of the Gap Theory is widely thought to have been promulgated by [[William Buckland]] and [[Thomas Chalmers]] in the early 19th century, though some adherents maintain that it can be traced back to biblical times. Certainly it became quite popular when it was promoted by the [[Scofield Reference Bible]] in 1909. }}
*{{Term|term= Old Earth creationism |content= [[Old Earth creationism]] }}{{defn|1= a variant of the [[Creationism|creationist]] view of the origin of the [[universe]] and [[life|life on Earth]]. As a theory of origins it is typically more compatible with mainstream scientific thought on the issues of [[geology]], [[cosmology]] and the [[age of the Earth]], in comparison to [[Young Earth creationism]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Young Earth creationism |content= [[Young Earth creationism]] }}{{defn|1= the religious belief that Heaven, Earth, and [[life|life on Earth]] were created by a direct act of [[God]] dating between 6,000 and 10,000 years ago. Its adherents are those [[Christian]]s, [[Jew]]s and [[Muslim]]s who believe that [[God]] created the Earth in six 24-hour days, taking the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew]] text of [[Genesis (Hebrew Bible)|Genesis]] as a [[Biblical literalism|literal account]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Omphalos creationism |content= [[Omphalos creationism]] }}{{defn|1= named after the title of an 1857 book, ''[[Omphalos (book)|Omphalos]]'' by [[Philip Henry Gosse]], in which Gosse argued that in order for the world to be "functional", God must have created the [[Earth]] with mountains and canyons, trees with growth rings, Adam and Eve with hair, fingernails, and [[navel]]s (''[[omphalos]]'' is [[Greek language|Greek]] for "navel"), and that therefore ''no'' evidence that people can see of the presumed [[Age of the Earth|age of the earth]] and [[age of the universe|universe]] can be taken as reliable. The idea has seen some revival in the 20th century by some modern [[Creationism|creationists]], who have extended the argument to light that appears to originate in far-off [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]], although many other creationists reject this explanation (and also believe that Adam and Eve had no navels). }}

Nowadays the word generally refers to the opinions of those inclined to disbelieve in human sincerity, in [[virtue]], or in [[altruism]]: individuals who maintain that only self-interest motivates human behavior. A modern cynic typically has a highly contemptuous attitude towards social [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s, especially those that serve more of a [[ritual]]istic purpose than a practical one, and will tend to dismiss a substantial proportion of [[Mainstream|popular]] [[belief]]s, conventional [[morality]] and accepted [[wisdom]] as irrelevant or obsolete nonsense. }}

{{Term|term= Deconstructionism |content= [[Deconstruction]]ism }}{{defn|1= school and a set of methods of textual criticism aimed at understanding the assumptions and ideas that form the basis for thought and belief. Also called "deconstruction", its central concern is a radical critique of the [[metaphysics]] of the Western philosophical tradition, in which it identifies a [[Phallogocentrism|logicentrism]] or "[[metaphysics of presence]]" which holds that speech-thought (the ''logos'') is a privileged, ideal, and self-present entity, through which all discourse and meaning derive.

{{Term|term= Defeatism |content= [[Defeatism]] }}{{defn|1= Defeatism is acceptance and content with defeat without struggle. In everyday use, defeatism has negative connotation, and is often linked to treason and pessimism. The term is commonly used in the context of war: a soldier can be a defeatist if he or she refuses to fight because he or she thinks that the fight will be lost for sure or that it is not worth fighting for some other reason.

For a "rational basis for religion" they refer to the [[cosmological argument]] (first cause argument), the [[teleological argument]] (argument from design), and other aspects of what was called ''[[natural theology|natural religion]]''. Deism has become identified with the classical belief that God created but does not intervene in the world, though this is not a necessary component of deism. }}

A dogmatic position is not open to rational argument, and is "established" only according to a particular point of view, and therefore of doubtful foundation. }}

It is contrasted with varying kinds of [[monism]], including [[materialism]] and [[phenomenalism]]. Dualism is one answer to the [[mind-body problem]]. [[Pluralism (philosophy of mind)|Pluralism]] holds that there are even more kinds of events or things in the world. }}
*{{Term|term= Substance dualism |content= [[Substance dualism]] }}{{defn|1= is a type of [[ontological dualism]] defended by [[Descartes]] in which it is claimed that there are two fundamental kinds of substance: mental and material. The mental does not extend in space, and material cannot think. It holds that immortal souls occupy an independent realm of existence, while apparently bodies die. This view contradicts [[physicalism]]. }}
{{Term|term= Dynamism |content= [[Dynamism (metaphysics)|Dynamism]] }}{{defn|1= [[cosmology|cosmological]] framework developed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (1646–1716). The idea behind Dynamism in [[cosmology (metaphysics)|metaphysical cosmology]] is that the material world can be explained in terms of active, point-like ''forces,'' with no extension but with [[action at a distance (physics)|action at a distance]]. Dynamism describes that which exists as simple elements, or for Leibniz, [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|Monad]]s, and groups of elements that have only the essence of [[force]]s. It was developed as a reaction against the passive view of matter in [[mechanism (philosophy)|philosophical mechanism]]. }}

*{{Term|term= Ethical egoism |content= [[Ethical egoism]] }}{{defn|1= the [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] position that [[moral agent]]s ought to do what is in their own [[Enlightened self-interest|self-interest]]. It is distinguished from [[psychological egoism]] and [[rational egoism]]. It contrasts with ethical [[altruism (ethics)|altruism]], which holds that moral agents have an ethical [[obligation]] to help or serve others. Ethical egoism does not, however, require moral agents to disregard the well-being of others, nor does it require that a moral agent refrains from considering the [[well-being]] of others in moral deliberation. What is in an agent's self-interest may be incidentally detrimental to, beneficial to, or neutral in its effect on others. It allows for the possibility of either as long as what is chosen is efficacious in satisfying self-interest of the agent. Ethical egoism is sometimes used to support [[libertarianism]] or [[anarchism]], political positions based partly on a belief that individuals should not coercively prevent others from exercising freedom of action. }}

Put concisely, it is the study of knowledge and justified belief. It questions what knowledge is and how it can be acquired, and the extent to which knowledge pertinent to any given subject or entity can be acquired. Much of the debate in this field has focused on the [[philosophical analysis]] of the nature of knowledge and how it relates to connected notions such as [[truth]], [[belief]], and [[theory of justification|justification]]. The term was probably first introduced in Ferrier's ''Institutes of Metaphysic: The Theory of Knowing and Being'' (1854), p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{Term|term= Epiphenomenalism |content= [[Epiphenomenalism]] }}{{defn|1= the view in [[philosophy of mind]] according to which [[nature|physical]] events have [[mind|mental]] effects, but mental events have no effects of any kind. In other words, the [[causality|causal]] relations go only one way, from physical to mental. In recent times it is usually considered a type of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], because it postulates physical events but also non-physical mental events; but historically it has sometimes been thought a kind of [[monism]], because of its sharp divergence from [[substance dualism]]. }}
{{Term|term= Equalitarianism |content= [[Equalitarianism]] }}{{defn|1= another spelling of [[egalitarianism]]. }}
{{Term|term= Essentialism |content= [[Essentialism]] }}{{defn|1= the belief and practice centered on a philosophical claim that for any specific kind of entity it is at least theoretically possible to specify a finite list of characteristics, all of which any entity must have to belong to the group defined. }}
{{Term|term= Eternalism |content= [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|Eternalism]] }}{{defn|1= a [[philosophy|philosophical]] approach to the [[ontology|ontological]] nature of [[philosophy of space and time|time]]. It builds on the standard method of modeling time as a [[dimension]] in [[physics]], to give time a similar [[ontology]] to that of [[space]]. This would mean that time is just another dimension, that [[future]] events are "already there", and that there is no objective flow of time. }}

{{Term|term= Expressivism |content= [[Expressivism]] }}{{defn|1=  a theory about the meaning of [[morality|moral language]]. According to expressivism, sentences that employ moral terms–for example, "It is wrong to torture an innocent human being"–are not descriptive or fact-stating; moral terms such as "wrong," "good," or "just" do not refer to real, in-the-world properties. The primary function of moral sentences, according to expressivism, is not to assert any matter of fact, but rather to express an evaluative attitude toward an object of evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Horgan &amp; Timmons (2006c), pp. 220-221.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the function of moral language is non-descriptive, moral sentences do not have any truth conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Horgan &amp; Timmons (2006b), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, expressivists either do not allow that moral sentences have truth value, or rely on a notion of [[truth|truth value]] that does not appeal to any descriptive truth conditions being met for moral sentences. }}

Extropianism describes a pragmatic [[consilience]] of [[transhuman]] thought guided by a conscious, pro-active, self-directed approach to [[human evolution]] and progress. (''See [[posthuman]]''). Extropians were once concisely described as [[libertarianism|libertarian]] [[transhumanism|transhumanists]], and some still hold to this standard. }}

{{Term|term= Fallibilism |content= [[Fallibilism]] }}{{defn|1= doctrine that absolute certainty about [[knowledge]] is impossible; or at least that all claims to knowledge could, in principle, be mistaken. As a formal doctrine, it is most strongly associated with [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who used it in his attack on [[foundationalism]]. Unlike [[scepticism]], fallibilism does not imply the need for humans to abandon their knowledge- humans needn't have logically conclusive justifications for what they know. Rather, it is an admission that because [[empirical]] knowledge can be revised by further observation, all knowledge, excepting that which is axiomatically true (such as [[mathematics|mathematical]] and [[logic]]al knowledge) exists in a constant state of flux. }}
{{Term|term= Falsificationism |content= [[Falsificationism]] }}{{defn|1= the idea that a proposition or theory cannot be scientific if it does not admit the possibility of being shown to be false.

{{Term|term= Fascism |content= [[Fascism]] }}{{defn|1= political [[ideology]] and mass movement that seeks to place the [[nation]], defined in exclusive biological, cultural, and historical terms, above all other loyalties, and to create a mobilized national community.

{{Term|term= Feminism |content= [[Feminism]] }}{{defn|1= a diverse collection of social theories, political movements, and moral philosophies, largely motivated by or concerning the experiences of women, especially in terms of their social, political, and economic situation. As a social movement, feminism largely focuses on limiting or eradicating gender inequality and promoting women's rights, interests, and issues in society. }}
{{Term|term= Fatalism |content= [[Fatalism]] }}{{defn|1= the view that human deliberation and actions are pointless and ineffectual in determining events, because whatever will be will be. One ancient argument, called the ''idle argument'', went like this: "If it is [[destiny|fate]]d for you to recover from your illness, then you will recover whether you call a doctor or not. Likewise, if you are fated not to recover, you will not do so even if you call a doctor. So, calling a doctor makes no difference." Arguments like this are usually rejected even by causal [[determinism|determinists]], who may say that it may be determined that only a doctor can cure you. }}
{{Term|term= Fideism |content= [[Fideism]] }}{{defn|1= In [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology]], the position that [[reason]] is more-or-less irrelevant to religious belief, that rational or scientific [[arguments for the existence of God]] are fallacious and irrelevant, and have nothing to do with the truth of Christian theology. Its argument in essence goes: "Christian theology teaches that people are [[salvation|saved]] by [[faith]]. But, if God's existence can be ''proven'', either [[empiricism|empirically]] or [[logic]]ally, faith becomes irrelevant. Therefore, if Christian theology is true, no proof of God's existence is possible." The term is occasionally used to refer to a belief that Christians are saved by [[faith]] alone: for which see ''[[sola fide]]''. This position is sometimes called ''[[solifidianism]]''. }}

{{Term|term= Formalism |content= [[Formalism (philosophy)|Formalism]] }}{{defn|1= means a number of different things:
* A certain school in the [[philosophy of mathematics]], stressing [[axiom]]atic proofs through [[theorem]]s specifically associated with [[David Hilbert]].
* A school of thought in law and [[jurisprudence]] that emphasises the fairness of process over substantive outcomes. See [[Legal formalism]].
* In [[economic anthropology]], '''formalism''' is the theoretical perspective that the principles of neoclassical economics can be applied to humans' understanding of all human societies.
* A certain rigorous mathematical method: see [[formal system]].
* A set of notations and rules for manipulating them that yield results in agreement with experiment or other techniques of calculation. These rules and notations may or may not have a corresponding mathematical semantics. In the case no mathematical semantics exists, the calculations are often said to be ''purely formal''. See for example [[scientific formalism]].
* In the study of the arts and literature, '''formalism''' refers to the style of criticism that focuses on artistic or literary techniques in themselves, in separation from the work's social and historical context. See [[formalism (art)]], [[formalism (literature)]].
* In the study of film and film theory, '''formalism''' is a style of criticism that focuses on the technical aspects of filmmaking (e.g., lighting, sets, costumes, etc.). The term also referred to an [[avant-garde]] [[experimental film]] movement, often seen as odd or extremist, that was concerned with the beauty of the actual physical form of film (i.e., the celluloid itself). {{main|Formalist film theory}}

Basic beliefs are beliefs that are [[epistemic self-justification|self-justifying]] or [[self-evidence|self-evident]], and don't need to be justified ''by other beliefs.'' Basic beliefs provide [[epistemic justification|justificatory]] support to other beliefs, which can in turn support further derivative beliefs. Foundationalists hold that basic beliefs are justified by [[mental event]]s or states (such as experiences) that do not constitute beliefs (these are called [[wikt:nondoxastic|nondoxastic]] mental states), or that they simply are not the type of thing that can (or needs to be) justified. }}

The idea is that whenever humans experience something, they experience it as it is ''for themselves'': the object is real as well as mind-independent, but is, in a sense, altered by people's cognition (by the [[Category (Kant)|categories]] and the forms of sensibility, space and time).

Following Wittgenstein, many subscribed to the [[correspondence theory of truth]], although some, like Neurath, believed in [[coherentism]]. They believed that all knowledge should be based on logical inference from simple "protocol sentences" grounded in observable facts.

{{Term|term= Naturalism |content= [[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]] }}{{defn|1= any of several philosophical stances, typically those descended from [[materialism]] and [[pragmatism]], that do not distinguish the [[supernatural]] (including strange entities like non-natural values, and universals as they are commonly conceived) from [[nature]]. Naturalism does not necessarily claim that phenomena or hypotheses commonly labeled as [[supernatural]] do not exist or are wrong, but insists that all phenomena and hypotheses can be studied by the same methods and therefore anything considered supernatural is either nonexistent, unknowable, or not inherently different from natural phenomena or hypotheses. }}
*{{Term|term= Humanistic naturalism |content= [[Humanistic naturalism]] }}{{defn|1= the belief that human beings, as well as plants and animals, are divine and intricate extensions of nature. Followers share a mutual respect for things created directly by nature, even though life must feed upon life for continuance. While most believers are able to adapt to modern change, naturalists prefer the fair exchange of resources, as was in the case of former agricultural and hunter-gatherer societies. Industry and technology are in exact opposition to naturalism. }}

It is thus a stronger and more ambitious view than [[hylozoism]], which holds only that all things are alive. This is not to say that panpsychism believes that all matter is alive or even conscious but rather that the constituent parts of matter are composed of some form of mind and are [[Sentience|sentient]]. }}

{{Term|term= Particularism |content= [[Epistemological particularism|Particularism]] }}{{defn|1= in the study of knowledge, particularism refers to the approach where one asks the question "What do we know?" ''before'' asking "How do we know?" The term appears in [[Roderick Chisholm]]'s "The [[Problem of the Criterion]]", and in the work of his student, [[Ernest Sosa]] ("The Raft and the Pyramid: Coherence versus Foundations in the Theory of Knowledge"). Particularism is contrasted with [[Methodism (philosophy)|Methodism]], which answers the latter question before the former. Since the question "What do we know" implies that humans retain knowledge, it is fundamentally anti-skeptical. }}
{{Term|term= Pelagianism |content= [[Pelagianism]] }}{{defn|1= the belief that [[original sin]] did not taint [[instinct|human nature]] (which, being created from [[God]], was [[divinity|divine]]), and that mortal [[will (philosophy)|will]] is still capable of choosing [[Goodness and value theory|good]] or [[evil]] without [[Miracle|Divine aid]]. }}

It involves a general belief that things are bad, and tend to become worse; or that looks to the eventual triumph of evil over good; it contrasts with optimism, the contrary belief in the goodness and betterment of things generally. A common conundrum illustrates optimism versus pessimism with the question - does one regard a given glass of water as: "Is the glass half empty or half full?" Conventional wisdom expects optimists to reply with half full and pessimists to respond with half empty, but this is not always the case. }}
{{Term|term= Phenomenal conservatism |content= [[Phenomenal conservatism]] }}{{defn|1= a philosophy that holds that it is reasonable to assume that things are as they appear, unless there are positive grounds for doubting this. }}
{{Term|term= Phenomenalism |content= [[Phenomenalism]] }}{{defn|1= in [[epistemology]] and the [[philosophy of perception]], ''phenomenalism'' is the view that physical objects do not exist as things in themselves but only as perceptual [[phenomena]] or sensory stimuli (e.g. redness, hardness, softness, sweetness, etc.) situated in time and in space. In particular, phenomenalism reduces talk about physical objects in the external world to talk about ''bundles of sense-data''. }}
{{Term|term= Philosophy |content= [[Philosophy]] }}{{defn|1= broad field of [[inquiry]] concerning ''[[knowledge]]''; in which the definition of knowledge itself is one of the subjects investigated. Philosophy is the pursuit of [[wisdom]], spans the [[nature]] of the universe and [[human nature]] (of the mind and the body), the relationships between these, and between people. It explores what and how people come to know, including [[existence]] itself, and how that knowledge is reliably and usefully represented, and communicated between and among humans, whether in [[thought]], by [[language]], or with [[mathematics]]. Philosophy is the predecessor and complement of science, and its foundation. It develops notions about the issues that underlie [[science]], and ponders the nature of thought itself. In science, the scientific method, which involves repeated observations of the results of controlled experiments, is an available and highly successful philosophical [[methodology]]. Within fields of study that are concerned directly with humans (economics, psychology, sociology and so forth), in which experimental methodologies are not generally available, subdisciplines of philosophy are developed to provide a rational basis of study in the respective fields. }}
{{Term|term= Physicalism |content= [[Physicalism]] }}{{defn|1= the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] position asserting that everything that exists has a [[physical properties|physical property]]; that is, that there are no kinds of things other than physical things. In contemporary [[philosophy]] physicalism is most frequently associated with [[philosophy of mind]], in particular the [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind/body problem]], in which it holds that the mind is a physical thing in some sense. Physicalism is also called "materialism", but the term "physicalism" is preferable because it has evolved with the physical sciences to incorporate far more sophisticated notions of physicality than matter, for example wave/particle relationships and unseen, non-material forces. }}
{{Term|term= Platonism |content= [[Platonism]] }}{{defn|1= the school of philosophy founded by [[Plato]]. Often used to refer to [[Platonic idealism]], the belief that the entities of the phenomenal world are imperfect reflections of an ideal truth.

*{{Term|term= Neo-Platonism |content= [[Neo-Platonism]] }}{{defn|1= was a school of [[philosophy]] that took shape in the 3rd century A.D. The school was characterized by a systematization of Platonic metaphysics along with a pursuit of mystical union with the divine. }}
{{Term|term= Pluralism |content= [[Pluralism in philosophy|Pluralism]] }}{{defn|1= in the area of philosophy of the mind, distinguishes a position where one believes there to be ultimately many kinds of substances in the world, as opposed to [[monism]] and [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]].

*{{Term|term= Legal positivism |content= [[Legal positivism]] }}{{defn|1= school of thought in the [[philosophy of law]] that claims that [[law]]s are made (deliberately or unintentionally) by human beings, and that there is no ''inherent'' or ''necessary'' connection between the validity of law and what is [[ethics|ethical]] or [[morality|moral]]. }}
{{Term|term= Postmodernism |content= [[Postmodern philosophy|Postmodernism]] }}{{defn|1= philosophical movement characterized by the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] criticism and analysis of Western [[philosophy]]. Beginning as a critique of [[Continental philosophy]], it was heavily influenced by [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[structuralism]] and [[existentialism]], and by the philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Martin Heidegger]]. It was also influenced to some degree by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later criticisms of [[analytic philosophy]]. Within postmodern philosophy, there are numerous interrelated fields, including [[deconstruction]] and several fields beginning with the prefix "post-", such as [[post-structuralism]], [[post-Marxism]], and [[post-feminism]]. In particular postmodern philosophy has spawned a huge literature of [[critical theory]]. }}
{{Term|term= Pragmatism |content= [[Pragmatism]] }}{{defn|1= [[philosophy]] that originated in the [[United States]] in the late 19th century. Pragmatism is characterized by the insistence on consequences, utility and practicality as vital components of meaning and truth. Pragmatism objects to the view that human concepts and intellect represent reality, and therefore stands in opposition to both [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalist]] and [[rationalist]] schools of [[philosophy]]. Rather, pragmatism holds that it is only in the struggle of intelligent organisms with the surrounding environment that theories acquire significance, and only with a theory's success in this struggle that it ''becomes'' true. }}
{{Term|term= Prescriptivism |content= [[Prescriptivism (philosophy)|Prescriptivism]] }}{{defn|1= [[Meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] theory about the [[Semantics|semantical]] content of moral statements, introduced by the philosopher [[R. M. Hare]] in his book ''The Language of Morals''. It holds that moral statements functions similarly to [[Moral imperative|imperative]]s. For example, according to prescriptivism, the statement "Killing is wrong" means something like "You shouldn't kill". What it expresses is an ''imperative''. }}
{{Term|term= Probabilism |content= [[Probabilism]] }}{{defn|1= practical doctrine that gives assistance in ordinary matters to one who is skeptical in respect of the possibility of real knowledge: it supposes that though knowledge is impossible, a man may rely on strong beliefs in practical affairs. This view was held by the [[skepticism|skeptics]] of the [[New Academy]] (''see [[skepticism]] and [[Carneades]].''). Opposed to "probabilism" is "probabiliorism" (Latin ''probabilior'', "more likely"), which holds that when there is a preponderance of evidence on one side of a controversy that side is presumably right. [[academic skepticism|Academic skeptics]] accept probabilism, while [[Pyrrhonian skepticism|Pyrrhonian skeptics]] do not. }}

{{Term|term= Pyrrhonism |content= [[Pyrrhonism]] }}{{defn|1= a sub-philosophy of [[skepticism]] that holds that any assent with regard to non-evident propositions will always remain in a state of perpetual inquiry; therefore, proof or disproof of an observation is not necessarily a valid reason for holding an opinion on the matter. }}
{{Term|term= Pythagoreanism |content= [[Pythagoreanism]] }}{{defn|1= the [[esoteric]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] beliefs held by [[Pythagoras]] and his followers, the Pythagoreans, who were considerably influenced by [[mathematics]]. Pythagoreanism greatly influenced [[Platonism]]. Later revivals of Pythagorean doctrines led to what is now called [[Neopythagoreanism]]. }}

{{Term|term= Spiritualism |content= [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]] }}{{defn|1= a [[religious movement]], prominent from the 1840s to the 1920s, found primarily in English-speaking countries. The movement's distinguishing feature is the belief that the [[spirit]]s of the dead can be contacted by [[adept]]s. These spirits are believed to lie on a higher spiritual plane than humans, and are therefore capable of providing guidance in both worldly and spiritual matters. }}
{{Term|term= Statism |content= [[Statism]] }}{{defn|1= the belief that the state or government should do everything. }}
{{Term|term= Stoicism |content= [[Stoicism]] }}{{defn|1= a Hellenistic school with the principle that self-control, both emotional and physical, leads to an inner strength and character that enables one to harmoniously interact with the natural world.

{{Term|term= Surrealism |content= [[Surrealism]] }}{{defn|1=  cultural movement that began in the early-1920s, best known for the visual artworks and writings of the group members. The works feature the element of surprise, unexpected juxtapositions and [[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequitur]], however many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost with the works being an artifact, and leader [[André Breton]] was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was above all a revolutionary movement.&lt;ref name=appolinaire&gt;In 1917, [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] coined the term "Surrealism" in the program notes describing the ballet ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'' which was a collaborative work by [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Erik Satie]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Léonide Massine]]: "From this new alliance, for until now stage sets and costumes on one side and choreography on the other had only a sham bond between them, there has come about, in ''Parade'', a kind of super-realism ('sur-réalisme'), in which I see the starting point of a series of manifestations of this new spirit ('esprit nouveau')."&lt;/ref&gt; }}
{{Term|term= Symbolism |content= [[Symbol]]ism }}{{defn|1= applied use of any [[icon]]ic representations that carry particular conventional meanings.

{{Term|term= Taoism |content= [[Taoism]] }}{{defn|1= a group of [[China|Chinese]] religious and philosophical traditions. Philosophical Taoism emphasizes various themes found in the ''[[Daodejing]]'' and ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' such as "nonaction" (''[[wu wei]]''), [[emptiness]], detachment, receptiveness, spontaneity, the strength of softness, the [[relativism]] of human values, and the search for a long life. Religious Taoism is not clearly separated from philosophy, but incorporates a number of supernatural beliefs in gods, ghosts, ancestral spirits, and practices such as [[Taoist alchemy]] and [[qigong]]. }}
{{Term|term= Teleologism |content= [[Teleologism]] }}{{defn|1= the supposition that there is design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the works and processes of nature, and the [[philosophy|philosophical]] study of that purpose. Teleology stands in contrast to [[philosophical naturalism]], and both ask questions separate from the questions of [[science]]. While science investigates natural laws and phenomena, Philosophical naturalism and teleology investigate the existence or non-existence of an organizing principle behind those natural laws and phenomena. Philosophical naturalism asserts that there are no such principles. Teleology asserts that there are. }}
{{Term|term= Theism |content= [[Theism]] }}{{defn|1= the view that there is one or more [[deity|god]]s or [[goddess]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Swinburne|Swinburne, Richard]]. ''The Coherence of Theism'', Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it may also mean the belief in God, a god, or gods, who is/are actively involved in maintaining the [[Universe]]. A theist can also take the position that he does not have sufficient evidence to "know" whether God or gods exist, although he believes it through faith. }}
*{{Term|term= Monotheism |content= [[Monotheism]] }}{{defn|1= the belief in a single, universal, all-encompassing [[deity]]. [[Zoroastrianism]] and the [[Abrahamic religion]]s are considered Monotheist. }}
**{{Term|term= Classical theism |content= [[Classical theism]] }}{{defn|1= refers to traditional ideas of the [[monotheistic]] religions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]. Classical theism holds that God is an absolute, [[eternity|eternal]], all-knowing ([[omniscient]]), all-powerful ([[omnipotent]]), and perfect being. God is related to the world as its cause, but is unaffected by the world (immutable). He is [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] over the world, which exists relative to him as a temporal effect. }}
**{{Term|term= Deism |content= [[Deism]] }}{{defn|1= a form of monotheism in which it is believed that one god exists. However, a deist rejects the idea that this god intervenes in the world. Hence any notion of special [[revelation]] is impossible, and the nature of god can only be known through reason and observation from nature. A deist thus rejects the miraculous, and the claim to knowledge made for religious groups and texts. }}
**{{Term|term= Cosmotheism |content= Cosmotheism }}{{defn|1= synonym for pantheism (see below). }}
**{{Term|term= Monistic theism |content= [[Monistic theism]] }}{{defn|1= the type of monotheism found in Hinduism. This type of theism is different from the Semitic religions as it encompasses [[panentheism]], [[monism]], and at the same time includes the concept of a personal God as a universal, omnipotent supreme being. The other types of monotheism are qualified monism, the school of [[Ramanuja]] or [[Vishishtadvaita]], which admits that the universe is part of God, or [[Narayana]], a type of [[panentheism]], but there is a plurality of souls within this supreme Being and [[Dvaita]], which differs in that it is dualistic, as God is separate and not panentheistic. }}
**{{Term|term= Pantheism |content= [[Pantheism]] }}{{defn|1= the view that everything is of an all-encompassing immanent God; or that the universe, or nature, and God are equivalent. More detailed definitions tend to emphasize the idea that natural law, existence and/or the universe (the sum total of all that was, is, or shall be) is represented or personified in the theological principle of 'God'. The existence of a transcendent supreme extraneous to nature is denied. Depending on how this is understood, such a view may be presented as tantamount to [[atheism]], [[deism]] or [[theism]]. }}
***{{Term|term= Pandeism |content= [[Pandeism]] }}{{defn|1= a type of pantheism that combines the pantheistic belief of God being identical to the Universe with the idea from deism (above) that God is revealed by rational examination and does not intervene in the Universe. }}
**{{Term|term=  Panentheism|content= [[Panentheism]] }}{{defn|1= the theological position that [[God]] is [[Immanence|immanent]] within the [[Universe]], but also [[Transcendence (religion)|transcends]] it. It is distinguished from [[pantheism]], which holds that God is synonymous with the material universe. In panentheism, God is viewed as creator and/or animating force behind the universe, and the source of [[universal morality]]. The term is closely associated with the [[Logos]] of [[Greek philosophy]] in the works of [[Herakleitos]], which pervades the [[cosmos]] and whereby all things were made. }}
**{{Term|term= Substance monotheism |content= [[Substance monotheism]] }}{{defn|1= found e.g. in some indigenous African religions, holds that the many gods are different forms of a single underlying substance, and that this underlying substance is God. This view has some similarities to the Christian [[Trinity|trinitarian]] view of three persons sharing one nature. }}
**{{Term|term= Transtheism |content= [[Transtheism]] }}{{defn|1= assumes the existence of [[God]] as an absent [[deity]] and the [[The Ultimate (philosophy)|ultimate]] concept of God's existence is [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and external to all other forms of existence, which implies an impersonal, non-anthropomorphic, non-universemorphic or even non-cosmosmorphic being and view of God. In transtheism, God has one primary attribute, [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Nontheism |content= [[Nontheism]] }}{{defn|1= the absence of belief in both the existence ''and'' non-existence of a [[deity]] (or [[polytheism|deities]], or other [[numinous]] phenomena). The word is often employed as a blanket term for all belief systems that are not [[theism|theistic]], including [[atheism]] (both [[strong atheism|strong]] and [[weak atheism|weak]]) and [[agnosticism]], as well as certain [[Eastern religion]]s like [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Zen Buddhism]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Polytheism |content= [[Polytheism]] }}{{defn|1= belief in, or worship of, multiple [[deity|gods]] or divinities. Most ancient religions were polytheistic, holding to [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]s of traditional deities, often accumulated over centuries of cultural interchange and experience. The belief in many gods does not contradict or preclude also believing in an all-powerful all-knowing supreme being. }}
**{{Term|term= Henotheism |content= [[Henotheism]] }}{{defn|1= devotion to a single [[deity|god]] while accepting the existence of other [[deity|gods]]. Coined by [[Max Müller]], according to whom it is "[[monotheism]] in principle and a [[polytheism]] in fact". Variations on the term have been ''inclusive monotheism'' and ''monarchial polytheism'', designed to differentiate differing forms of the phenomenon. }}
*{{Term|term= Open theism |content= [[Open theism]] }}{{defn|1= A religious approach combining [[Classical Theism]] as well as [[Ancient Greek]] beliefs that question the ideas of [[free will]] and the [[God and eternity|timeless]] nature of [[God]]. }}
*{{Term|term= Philosophical theism |content= [[Philosophical theism]] }}{{defn|1= the belief that [[God]] exists (or must exist), independent of the teaching or revelation of any particular [[religion]]. Some philosophical theists are persuaded of God's existence by philosophical arguments, while others consider themselves to have a religious faith that need not be, or could not be, supported by rational argument. }}
{{Term|term= Theological noncognitivism |content= [[Theological noncognitivism]] }}{{defn|1= the argument that [[religious]] [[language]], and specifically words like "[[God]]" (capitalized), are not cognitively meaningful. It is cited as proof of the nonexistence of anything named "God", and therefore is a basis for [[atheism]]. There are two main arguments: [[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]] used [[verifiability theory of meaning]] to conclude that religious language is meaningless because it is not verifiable, proving [[weak atheism]]. [[George H. Smith]] used an attribute-based approach to argue that the concept "god" has no meaningful attributes, only negatively defined or relational attributes, making it meaningless — leading to the conclusion that "god does not exist", thus proving [[strong atheism]]. }}
{{Term|term= Thomism |content= [[Thomism]] }}{{defn|1= the philosophical school that followed in the legacy of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. The word comes from the name of its originator, whose summary work ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' has arguably been second to only the [[Bible]] in importance to the Catholic Church. }}
{{Term|term= Totalitarianism |content= [[Totalitarianism]] }}{{defn|1= a [[ideal type|typology]] employed by [[political science|political scientists]] to denote [[Modernism|modern]] [[regime]]s in which the [[State (polity)|state]] regulates nearly every aspect of public and private behavior. Totalitarian regimes mobilize entire populations in support of the state and a political [[ideology]], and do not tolerate activities by individuals or groups such as [[labor union]]s, [[Church body|churches]] and [[political party|political parties]] that are not directed toward the state's goals. They maintain themselves in power by means of [[secret police]], [[propaganda]] disseminated through the state-controlled [[mass media]], regulation and restriction of [[freedom of speech|free discussion and criticism]], and widespread use of terror tactics. }}
{{Term|term= Transcendental idealism |content= [[Transcendental idealism]] }}{{defn|1= the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] and later Kantian and German Idealist philosophers; a view according to which human experience is not of things as they are in themselves, but of those things as they appear to human beings. It differs from standard (empirical) [[idealism]] in that it does not claim that the objects of human experience would be in any sense ''within'' the mind. The idea is that whenever humans experience something, they experience it as it is ''for themselves'': the object is real as well as mind-independent, but is, in a sense, altered by people's cognition (by the [[Category (Kant)|categories]] and the forms of sensibility, space and time). Transcendental idealism denies that people could have knowledge of the thing in itself. A view that holds the opposite is called transcendental realism. }}
{{Term|term= Transcendentalism |content= [[Transcendentalism]] }}{{defn|1= a group of new ideas in [[literature]], [[religion]], [[culture]], and [[philosophy]] that advocates that there is an ideal [[spirituality|spiritual]] state that 'transcends' the physical and empirical and is only realized through a knowledgeable intuitive awareness that is conditional upon the individual. The concept emerged in [[New England]] in the early-to mid-19th century. It is sometimes called "''American'' ''Transcendentalism''" to distinguish it from other uses of the word ''[[transcendentals|transcendental]]''. It began as a protest against the general state of culture and [[society]] at the time, and in particular, the state of [[intellectualism]] at [[Harvard]] and the doctrine of the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church that was taught at [[Harvard Divinity School]]. The term ''transcendentalism'' sometimes serves as shorthand for "[[transcendental idealism]]". Another alternative meaning for ''transcendentalism'' is the classical philosophy that God transcends the manifest world. As [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|John Scotus Erigena]] put it to [[Franks|Frankish]] king [[Charles the Bald]] in the year 840 A.D., "We do not know what God is. God himself doesn't know what He is because He is not anything. Literally God is not, because He transcends being." }}
{{Term|term= Transhumanism |content= [[Transhumanism]] }}{{defn|1= a term often used as a synonym for "[[human enhancement]]", is an international, intellectual and cultural movement supporting the use of new [[science]]s and [[technology|technologies]] to enhance human [[human brain|mental]] and [[human anatomy|physical]] abilities and [[aptitude]]s, and [[meliorism|ameliorate]] what it regards as undesirable and unnecessary aspects of the [[human condition]], such as [[suffering]], [[disease]], [[aging]] and involuntary [[death]]. }}
{{Term|term= Transtheism |content= [[Transtheism]] }}{{defn|1= ''see its entry under theism, above.'' }}

In addition, it postulates that in many cases, such incompatible values, may be rationally [[commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]]. As such, value-pluralism is a theory in [[metaethics]], rather than an ethical theory or a set of values in itself. The Oxford historian of ideas, [[Isaiah Berlin]], is accredited with having done the first substantial work on value-pluralism, bringing it to the attention of general academia. }}
{{Term|term= Verificationism |content= [[Verificationism]] }}{{defn|1= an [[epistemic theories of truth|epistemic theory of truth]] based on the idea that the mind engages in a certain kind of activity: "verifying" a [[proposition]].

{{Term|term= Vitalism |content= [[Vitalism]] }}{{defn|1= the doctrine that '''"vital forces"''' are active in [[life|living organisms]], so that life cannot be explained solely by [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]].

{{Term|term= Voluntarism |content= [[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|Voluntarism]] }}{{defn|1= school of thought that regards the will as superior to the [[Intelligence (trait)|intellect]] and to [[emotion]].

{{Term|term= Voluntaryism |content= [[Voluntaryism]] }}{{defn|1= theory advocated by [[Auberon Herbert]], stressing "voluntary taxation" and the boycott of electoral politics. The original sources for voluntaryism can be found in Herbert's book "The Right and Wrong of Compulsion by the State." Some, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]] view Herbert's philosophy as anarchism, however he never called himself an anarchist as he considered anarchism to be a philosophy that does not provide for defense of person and property. }}

'''Gualtiero Piccinini''' (born 1970) is an Italian–American philosopher notable for his work on the nature of [[mind]] and [[computation]] as well as on how to integrate [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]]. He is Professor in the Philosophy Department and the Center for Neurodynamics at the [[University of Missouri, St. Louis]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umsl.edu/~piccininig/ |title=Gualtiero Piccinini's Homepage |publisher=University of Missouri |location=St. Louis |date=10 March 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Piccinini was born and raised in Italy, and studied [[philosophy]] and [[cognitive science]] at the [[University of Turin]]. He then went to graduate school at [[University of Pittsburgh]], specializing in the [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umsl.edu/~piccininig/ Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion of his Ph.D. he held a postdoctoral position at the PNP program at Washington University, St. Louis, devoted to Philosophy, Neuroscience and Psychology. He started his position at University of Missouri, St. Louis in 2005 and received early tenure and promotion to associate professor in 2010 and early promotion to full professor in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umsl.edu/~piccininig/ Piccinini's website]&lt;/ref&gt; From 2011 to 2014 he was the Chair of the Philosophy Department at University of Missouri, St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umsl.edu/~philo/People/Faculty/index.html List of Faculty, Department of Philosophy UMSL]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Cognitive science===
In the area of [[cognitive science]] Piccinini is best known for his [[Computation#Physical phenomenon|mechanistic account of what it takes for a physical system to perform computations]].  He has argued that computation is a kind of mechanistic process that does not require [[mental representation|representation]].&lt;ref&gt;Nir Fresco (2008). "An Analysis of the Criteria for Evaluating Adequate Theories of Computation." Minds and Machines 18 (3).&lt;/ref&gt;  Building on his account of computation, he and co-author Sonya Bahar, an award-winning physicist and Director of the Center for Neurodynamics at University of Missouri, St. Louis, argue that neural computations are neither digital nor analog, but sui generis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201211/is-the-brain-computer Kristian Marlow (2012). "Is the Brain a Computer?" Psychology Today, November 28.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of mind===
Piccinini is also widely known for his critique of [[pancomputationalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Arkoudas, K., “Computation, Hypercomputation, and Physical Science”, Journal of Applied Logic, 6.4 (2008): 461-475.&lt;/ref&gt; and for his view about first-person data such as data from first-person reports.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, D., The Character of Consciousness, Oxford University Press (2010), p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  He has argued that first-person data are scientifically legitimate because they are public like other scientific data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://schwitzsplintersunderblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/comments-on-gualtiero-piccinini-first.html#!/2009/02/comments-on-gualtiero-piccinini-first.html The Splintered Mind: Underblog]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nursingknowledge.wordpress.com/category/philosophers/gualtiero-piccinini/ Nursing, Philosophy, and Science]&lt;/ref&gt; Piccinini has also published influential articles on [[computational theories of mind|computational theories of cognition]], [[concept]]s, and [[consciousness]], with award-winning physicist Sonya Bahar and his post doc and research associate Corey Maley from Princeton University, among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umsl.edu/~piccininig/ Piccinini's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous==
Piccinini has received several grants, awards, fellowships and teaching releases, including a Fellowship at the Institute for Advanced Studies at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and a Scholars' Award by the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umsl.edu/~piccininig/ Piccinini's website]&lt;/ref&gt; He is the recipient of the 2014 Herbert Simon award by the International Association of Computing and Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.umsl.edu/news/2014/02/11/philosophy-association/]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been Philosophy Program Chair for the Southern Society for Philosophy and Psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umsl.edu/~piccininig/ Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the founder of [http://philosophyofbrains.com Brains], an academic group blog in the philosophy of mind, psychology, and neuroscience and one of the founders of SLAPSA, a St. Louis-based organization for the philosophy of science, run by Piccinini, Professor Carl Craver (Washington University Saint Louis) and Professor Kent Staley (Saint Louis University).&lt;ref&gt;[http://slapsa.net/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermann Cohen''' (also known as '''Augustine Mary of the [[Blessed Sacrament]], O.C.D.''', {{lang-fr|Augustin-Marie du Très Saint-Sacrement}}, better known as '''Father Hermann'''; 10 November 1821 – 20 January 1871) was a noted [[German Jewish]] [[pianist]],  who converted to the [[Catholic Church]]. He later became a [[friar]] and [[priest]] of the [[Discalced Carmelite Order]], who was instrumental in re-establishing his Order in both France and England. He was a popular preacher throughout Europe, and was instrumental in introducing the widespread practice of [[Eucharistic adoration|nocturnal adoration of the Blessed Sacrament]].

The cause for Cohen's [[canonization]] has been accepted for investigation by the [[Holy See]].

==Life==

===Early life and musical career===
He was born in Hamburg, one of the four children of David Abraham Cohen and Rosalie Benjamin, part of a large and prosperous Jewish banking family. Although not pious, his parents were members of the [[Reform Judaism]] movement there and taught their son [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and the basics of the Jewish faith.&lt;ref name=AHC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hebrewcatholic.net/hermann-cohen-ocd-2/|work=Association of Hebrew Catholics|title=Hermann Cohen OCD|first=Elias, O.C.D.|last=Friedman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A gifted student, at the age of 4 he began to study the piano, at which he had soon became accomplished. Praised by his teacher, who had arranged successful concerts for him at the age of 7 in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] and [[Frankfurt]], he became the spoiled focus of the family's attention. From his teacher, he also acquired a serious gambling habit, which was to plague him for many years. At the age of 12, his mother resolved to take him to Paris to advance his musical training, against the wishes of her husband, who was experiencing financial difficulties. Undeterred, she approached the [[Grand Duke]]s [[George, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|George of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] and [[Frederick Francis I, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Francis I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], in order to obtain their financial support for her son. Successful in her quest, she took her children and moved to Paris. The family arrived there in July 1834, only to learn that, as a foreigner, Hermann was denied admission to the famed [[Paris Conservatory]].&lt;ref name=SJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.users.cloud9.net/~recross/why-not/Cohen.html|title=The Spiritual Journey of Hermann Cohen|first=Richard|last=Cross|work=Cloud9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Franz Liszt====
[[File:Hermann Cohen Jugendbild.jpg|thumb|Hermann Cohen, young pianist at Paris, 1835.]]This rejection led to a significant direction in Cohen's life. Rosalie Cohen was able to persuade the renowned pianist [[Franz Liszt]] to take her son on as a pupil. Despite his early reluctance, after hearing him play and taken by his good looks, Liszt accepted him as a pupil. Cohen soon became his favorite student. As Liszt himself had been nicknamed ''Putzig'' (German for "little cute guy") by his own teacher, [[Carl Czerny]], he began to call Cohen ''Puzzi'', a diminutive form of the word. Liszt accepted Cohen into his social circle, introducing him to his friends, the author [[George Sand]] and the radical priest, the [[Hugues Felicité Robert de Lamennais|Abbé de Lamennais]], who both also became charmed by the boy. Sand began to dote on the boy and called him ''Le Mélancolique Puzzi''. Lamennais gave the young Jewish boy an autographed copy of his work, ''Paroles d'un croyant''—for which the priest had just been [[excommunicated]] by [[Pope Gregory XVI]]—with the inscription: ''Souvenirs offerts à mon cher petit Puzzi''.&lt;ref name=SJ /&gt;

The following June, Liszt left Paris without warning with his new lover, the [[Countess]] [[Marie d'Agoult]], and moved to [[Geneva]], where he began to teach at the recently founded [[Geneva Conservatory]] of Music. Devastated by the sudden loss of his mentor, Cohen persisted in begging Liszt to allow him to join him there, to which Liszt eventually relented. Cohen's arrival in the Liszt circle in Geneva soon earned him the long-held enmity of the countess. His abilities continued to grow under Liszt’s watchful eye. On 1 October 1835 Cohen played in a concert sponsored by the Princess [[Cristina Trivulzio Belgiojoso]]. Together with Liszt and two other pianists, he played in a four-piano ''Brilliant Potpourri'' on folk airs by Czerny. That same month Liszt entrusted the boy with 10 students of his own. At age 13, Cohen’s career appeared headed for greatness.&lt;ref name=SJ /&gt;

By then Cohen had become Liszt's constant companion, accompanying him and the countess on their holiday trips through the Swiss countryside. He was with them and Sand on a notorious trip to [[Chamonix]]. He later wrote, ''Circumstances led me into the interior of a family unsanctified by the marriage ties''. As dissolute as the circle appeared to the world, Liszt felt himself responsible for the boy's moral as well as his professional development and Cohen was touched when Liszt gave him a Bible. Cohen felt a deep religious experience in the course of one trip, when Liszt played an improvisation of the ''[[Dies Irae]]'' from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]]'' on the Grand Organ of the [[Fribourg Cathedral|Cathedral of St. Nicholas]] in [[Fribourg]].&lt;ref name=SJ /&gt;

In 1837 Liszt and his circle returned to Paris, where the princess had arranged for a famed competition between him and his greatest rival of the period, [[Sigismond Thalberg]]. She came to know Cohen at that time and became a friend and patron. When his increasing debts threatened to drown him, she arranged for a concert, which was to prove unsuccessful, apparently due to his lack of training from the idle lifestyle of gambling and dissolution he had adopted. The shock of this failure led Cohen to return to Hamburg, where he sought help from his father. Alone and in financial straits himself, the elder Cohen had no interest in helping his son. Cohen then turned to a former patron, Grand Duke George of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who sponsored several concerts for him to raise funds. They were successful enough to allow him to return to Paris. There he met a popular Italian singer named Mario, which whom he formed a partnership. The duo traveled to [[London]], where Cohen improved his skills and experienced a number of successes with their concerts.&lt;ref name=SJ /&gt;

Again saddled with debts, by 1839 Cohen began to be estranged from his mentors, both Liszt and the princess, as a result of his lifestyle. The Countess d'Agoult used an affair he had with a married woman in her campaign in an attempt to discredit him in Liszt's eyes, who nonetheless kept Cohen as his companion for his concert tours around Europe until the end of 1840. His ties to Liszt were not without their own consequences. [[Friedrich Wieck]], father of the future [[Clara Schumann]], began to criticize publicly both Liszt and Cohen in the newspapers in [[Leipzig]]. He was furious at Liszt for supporting [[Robert Schumann]] in his own lawsuit against Wieck: "To show cause why his twenty-year-old daughter Clara should not marry Schumann". Liszt shrugged off the charges but Cohen did not and took Wieck to court, where he won his case.&lt;ref name=SJ /&gt;

The year 1841 saw a final rupture between Cohen and Liszt, when the teenager was accused of embezzling funds from some concerts Liszt had given in [[Dresden]]. He was unable to persuade Liszt of his innocence. He felt his life had been wrecked, later calling this experience the result of "a plot hatched in hell". He spent the next five years traveling around Europe with his mother and his sister Henriette, playing concerts and composing works for the piano.&lt;ref name=SJ /&gt;

===Conversion===
Cohen settled in Paris in October 1846, where he shared an apartment with an artist friend. The following spring he met and fell in love with a popular circus rider, Celeste Mogadar, with whom he shared a deep love of music. The relationship soon ended, however, when he broke it off abruptly, indicating that he felt called to place his life in the hands of God.
Disgusted with his life, he began to seek spiritual guidance, visiting churches of the city, where he would spend hours in prayer.&lt;ref name=SJ /&gt;

In May 1847, while playing the organ for a [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament|Benediction service]] in the former Church of St. [[Valerius of Trèves|Valerius]] ({{lang-fr|Saint Valère}}), he became overwhelmed by an intense experience of submission, which he again experienced at the same service the next day, at which time the thought came to him that he should become a Catholic. While he was in [[Bad Ems|Ems]], Germany, to give a concert, he was again overwhelmed during the services in a local church there and resolved to take this step.&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{cite web|last=Zimmerman|first=Benedict|title=Hermann Cohen, Catholic Encyclopedia|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04094c.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen had never known a priest besides Lamennais and was confused as to in whom he could confide. He was introduced to [[Marie Theodor Ratisbonne]], a fellow Jewish convert, who, in turn introduced him to the Abbé Legrande. Under his instruction, Cohen was trained in the Catholic faith and was [[Baptism|baptized]], with the [[Christian name|baptismal name]] of Marie-Augustin-Henri, on 28 August, the [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of his namesake, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]. The baptism took place in the Chapel of Our Lady of Zion, in the presence of Ratisbonne, its founder, and many Jewish Catholics. At his baptism, he experienced an apparition of Christ, the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Blessed Virgin Mary]], and a multitude of saints, all bathed in a brilliant light, as well as an overwhelming experience of love.&lt;ref name=SJ /&gt;

Cohen received [[Confirmation]] the following 3 December from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paris|Archbishop of Paris]], [[Denis Auguste Affre]]. With the support of Jean-Baptiste de Bouillé, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Poitiers|Archbishop of Poitiers]], out of his own experience, he immediately began efforts to popularize the practice of the nocturnal adoration of the Blessed Sacrament by the general faithful.&lt;ref name=CE /&gt;

Cohen soon felt called to be a priest. He first approached the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[monk]]s of the [[Solesmes Abbey|Abbey of Solesmes]], who were known for their studies for the revival of [[Gregorian chant]]. They declined his application. Next he turned to [[Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire]], O.P., who was in the process of re-establishing the [[Dominican Order]] in France, after its destruction during the [[French Revolution]]. He counseled Cohen to find an Order more monastic than the Dominicans. Cohen then explored the more austere branch of the Carmelite Order, the Discalced, (or Barefoot) Carmelites, who follow the reforms of the Spanish [[mysticism|mystics]], [[John of the Cross]] and [[Teresa of Ávila]], who was also of Jewish ancestry.&lt;ref name=SJ /&gt; He felt called to this Order, with its claim to having originated on [[Mount Carmel]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], under the Prophet [[Elijah]]. Being a recent convert was a barrier to his admission, however, due to [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|Church law]], which required a personal visit to [[Rome]] to obtain a [[Dispensation (canon law)|dispensation]].&lt;ref name=AHC /&gt;

===Discalced Carmelite friar===
Cohen gave a farewell concert which cleared his debts, required before he could be admitted to the Order, in the days before the [[French Revolution of 1848|Revolution of 1848]]. Instead of joining the fight in the streets, he was at his favorite devotion, spending the night in adoration before the exposed Blessed Sacrament.&lt;ref name=SJ /&gt; He entered the Discalced Carmelite [[novitiate]] at Le Broussey, in [[Rions]], France, on 19 July of that year. He received the [[religious habit]] on 6 October 1849, being given the [[religious name]] of '''Augustine Mary of the Blessed Sacrament'''. He [[religious profession|professed]] [[religious vows]] as a member of the Order on 7 October 1850.&lt;ref name=AHC /&gt; He then began to study [[Catholic theology|theology]]. In this he faced a major challenge, as his formal education had stopped at the age of ten.&lt;ref name=SJ /&gt; Having been granted an exemption from some of the required courses, he was ordained a priest on 19 April 1851.&lt;ref name=CE /&gt;

Once ordained, Cohen launched himself into a ministry of preaching, which was to lead him to all the capitals of Europe. He preached to thousands in Geneva, Bordeaux, Lyon, and in Paris before huge crowds in prominent churches, such as [[Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]] and [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clotilde]]. The poet, [[Charles Baudelaire]], wrote that he found Cohen's sermons fascinating.&lt;ref name=SJ /&gt; His fiery eloquence and the interest caused by his conversion made him a popular preacher, despite his limited studies. He became a main figure in the restoration of the Carmelites in France, taking an active role in the founding of several [[priory|priories]] of friars in the south of France: [[Bagnères-de-Bigorre]] (1853), [[Lyon]] (1857) and a [[hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] in [[Tarasteix]], near [[Lourdes]] (1857).&lt;ref name=CE /&gt;

====Reconciliation====
By 1852, Cohen and Liszt, who was known for his generosity of spirit, had renewed their association through correspondence. Cohen invited his former mentor to visit him in France, which Liszt, by then living in [[Weimar]], was unable to do. Several years later, Liszt's daughter with the countess reported to her father that her mother had undergone a change of heart and had come to admire Cohen. Liszt returned the offer in 1857, pleading illness for not being able to travel.&lt;ref name=SJ /&gt;

In June 1862, both Cohen and Liszt happened to be in Rome. By this time, Liszt was himself was a [[cleric]], being in [[minor orders]] and a [[Third Order of St. Francis|Franciscan tertiary]]. They met for the first time in years, spending three weeks together, playing music and walking in the [[Coloseum]]. By that time, his mother, Maria Anna Liszt, had ceased to view Cohen with the [[antisemitism]] she had exhibited all her life prior to that.&lt;ref name=SJ /&gt;

====Mission to England====
Cohen's fame as a preacher led to an invitation by [[Cardinal Wiseman]] to come to England to re-establish the Carmelite Order, after its suppression in the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the 16th century, for which he received a special blessing from [[Pope Pius IX]]. He arrived in London in 1862, having £7 (c. ₤550 in modern funds)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/|work=Measuring Worth|title=Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1245 to Present}}&lt;/ref&gt; to support his work. He opened the new [[priory]] with a public religious procession, the first held by English Catholics since the time of the [[Tudors]].&lt;ref name=AHC /&gt; He gained further public attention to his ministry in 1864, when he faced a jeering crowd while administering the [[Last Rites]] to six Catholic sailors about to  be hanged on the gallows of [[Newgate Prison]]. He was lauded for his bravery by ''[[The Times]]'' of London.&lt;ref name=SJ /&gt;

===Final days===
In 1867 Cohen retired to the hermitage he had founded in Tarasteix, France. During this period, his eyesight began to fail and he was diagnosed with [[glaucoma]]. Spurning the surgery prescribed by his doctors, he chose to make a [[pilgrimage]] to the Shrine of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]]. Bathing his eyes there from the miraculous spring attributed to the shrine, his sight was immediately restored. He then returned to his life of solitude in France fully cured, living there in peace for the next few years.&lt;ref name=AHC /&gt;

Cohen's life was uprooted, however, by the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870, when all German nationals were expelled from France. Even though he was exempted by the French government, and his surviving immediate family were living in France, he chose to go into exile in [[Geneva]], Switzerland that following October. He soon heard of the large numbers of French prisoners being held in [[Spandau Prison]], just outside Berlin at that time. Despite his failing health, he volunteered to minister to them, and moved to Berlin in November. He found a facility crammed with over 5,000 prisoners living in squalid conditions, of whom some ten percent were suffering from serious infectious diseases, including [[smallpox]].&lt;ref name=AHC /&gt;

As the prison [[chaplain]], Cohen worked tirelessly to alleviate the needs of the French prisoners, distributing relief supplies in addition to his spiritual services. He said daily [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]], regularly drawing 500 attendees, and heard frequent [[confession (sacrament)|Confession]]s. He administered the [[Last Rites]] to two prisoners with his own hands instead of the prescribed spatula. Within two months, he began to exhibit the symptoms of smallpox himself, dying on 19 January 1871. His remains were buried in [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral]] in Berlin.&lt;ref name=AHC /&gt; After the destruction of the church during [[World War II]] his remains were transferred to the cathedral cemetery.&lt;ref name=SJ /&gt; In 2008 his remains were exhumed and transferred to the priory in Le Broussey where he had entered the Carmelite Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://www.orden-online.de/news/2008/12/16/gebeine-von-hermann-cohen-ocd-nach-frankreich-ueberfuehrt/|work=Orden online|title=Gebeine von Hermann Cohen OCD nach Frankreich überführt|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Infinite regress of homunculus.png|thumb|300px|Idea of 'internal viewer' generates [[infinite regress]] of internal viewers.]]

The '''homunculus argument''' is a [[fallacy]] arising most commonly in the theory of [[Visual perception|vision]]. One may explain (human) vision by noting that [[light]] from the outside world forms an image on the [[retina]]s in the [[human eye|eye]]s and something (or someone) in the [[human brain|brain]] looks at these images as if they are images on a movie screen (this theory of vision is sometimes termed the theory of the [[Cartesian theater]]: it is most associated, nowadays, with the psychologist [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]]).  The question arises as to the nature of this internal viewer. The assumption here is that there is a "little man" or "[[homunculus]]" inside the brain "looking at" the movie.

The reason why this is a fallacy may be understood by asking how the homunculus "sees" the internal movie. The obvious answer is that there is another homunculus inside the first homunculus's "head" or "brain" looking at this "movie". But that raises the question of how ''this'' homunculus sees the "outside world". To answer that seems to require positing ''another'' homunculus inside this second homunculus's head, and so forth. In other words, a situation of [[infinite regress]] is created. The problem with the homunculus argument is that it tries to account for a phenomenon in terms of the very phenomenon that it is supposed to explain.&lt;ref&gt;Richard  L. Gregory. (1987), ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==In terms of rules==
{{unreferenced-section|date=January 2016}}
Another example is with [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] theories that argue that the human brain uses "rules" to carry out operations (these rules often conceptualised as being like the [[algorithms]] of a [[computer program]]). For example, in his work of the '50s, '60s and '70s [[Noam Chomsky]] argued that (in the words of one of his books) human beings use ''Rules and Representations'' (or to be more specific, rules acting on representations) in order to cognate (more recently Chomsky has abandoned this view; cf. the [[Minimalist Program]]).

Now, in terms of (say) chess, the players are given 'rules' (i.e. the rules of chess) to follow. So: who ''uses'' these rules? The answer is self-evident: the players of the game (of chess) use the rules: it's not the case (obviously) that the rules ''themselves'' play chess. The rules themselves are merely inert marks on paper until a ''human being'' reads, understands and uses them. But what about the 'rules' that are, allegedly, inside our head (brain)? Who reads, understands and uses them? Again, the implicit answer is (and, some would argue, must be) a 'homunculus': a little man who reads the rules of the world and then gives orders to the body to act on them. But again we are in a situation of [[infinite regress]], because this implies that the homunculus utilizes cognitive processes that are also rule bound, which presupposes another homunculus inside ''its'' head, and so on and so forth. Therefore, so the argument goes, theories of mind that imply or state explicitly that cognition is [[Rule of inference|rule]] bound cannot be correct unless some way is found to 'ground' the regress.

This is important because it is often assumed in [[cognitive science]] that rules and [[algorithms]] are essentially the same: in other words, the theory that cognition is rule bound is often believed to imply that thought ([[cognition]]) is essentially the manipulation of algorithms, and ''this'' is one of the key assumptions of some varieties of [[artificial intelligence]].

Homunculus arguments are always [[fallacy|fallacious]] unless some way can be found to 'ground' the regress. In [[psychology]] and [[philosophy of mind]], 'homunculus arguments' (or the 'homunculus fallacies') are extremely useful for detecting where theories of [[mind]] fail or are incomplete.

The homunculus fallacy is closely related to [[Ryle's regress]].

==Counterarguments==
{{unreferenced-section|date=July 2014}}
The above cited [[regress argument]] does not necessarily invalidate all forms of the homunculus argument. The regress relies on the idea that the homunculus 'inside' the brain must itself have a homunculus inside it but it is not clear that this is a necessary condition. A [[Cartesian Dualism|dualist]] might argue that the homunculus inside the brain is an immaterial one (such as the Cartesian [[soul]]), or a [[Mysticism|mystic]] might assert that the homunculus is a recharacterization of the infinite consciousness of God (or true self), and thereby does not require a homunculus (or any form, spiritual or material) to have sensory experience, since such experience is a self-aware expression of the universe requiring no end to the regress other than the present moment itself. A [[Non-dualism|non-dualist]] may assert, similarly to the mystic, that a human life form (or any organism) is coterminous and indivisible from its environment, with this unified field of awareness (i.e., universal consciousness) mistaking itself for a homunculus (or an ego). A [[Neurosurgery]] professional may point to the [[cortical homunculus]], a distorted representation of the human body, based on a neurological "map" of the areas and proportions of the brain dedicated to processing motor functions, or sensory functions, for different parts of the body. No evidence of further regress is present, indicating the presence of something akin to a soul. Thus, the regress argument is only valid if there can be no other explanation of the homunculus's cognition supplied, and the arguments of a [[first cause]] or a transcendental, formless consciousness (i.e., awareness underlying and beyond form) are rejected.{{citationneeded|date=March 2015}}

The [[phrase]] "'''I know it when I see it'''" is a [[colloquial]] [[expression (language)|expression]] by which a speaker attempts to categorize an observable fact or event, although the category is subjective or lacks clearly defined parameters. The phrase was used in 1964 by [[United States Supreme Court]] Justice [[Potter Stewart]] to describe his threshold test for [[obscenity]] in ''[[Jacobellis v. Ohio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Peter Lattman |title=The Origins of Justice Stewart's 'I Know It When I See It' |date=September 27, 2007 |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=LawBlog at The Wall Street Journal Online |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2007/09/27/the-origins-of-justice-stewarts-i-know-it-when-i-see-it/ |accessdate=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Peter S.

{{quote|I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description ["hard-core pornography"], and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But ''I know it when I see it'', and the motion picture involved in this case is not that.&lt;ref&gt;''378 U.S. at 197 (Stewart, J., concurring) (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The expression became one of the best-known phrases in the history of the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Gewirtz]], "On 'I Know It When I See It'", ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'', Vol. 105, pp. 1023–1047 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Though "I know it when I see it" is widely cited as Stewart's test for "obscenity", he never used the word "obscenity" himself in his short concurrence. He only stated that he knows what fits the "shorthand description" of "hard-core pornography" when he sees it.&lt;ref&gt;''378 U.S. at 197 (Stewart, J., concurring) (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart's "I know it when I see it" standard was praised as "realistic and gallant"&lt;ref&gt;Harry Kalven, Jr., ''A Worthy Tradition: Freedom of Speech in America'', p. 40 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; and an example of candor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard A.

==History==
The [[Supreme Court of the United States]]' rulings concerning obscenity in the public square have been unusually inconsistent. Though [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] [[free speech]] protections have always been taken into account, both Constitutional interpretationalists and originalists have limited this right to account for public sensibilities. Before ''[[Roth v. United States]]'' in 1957, [[common law]] rules stemming from the 1868 English case ''[[Regina v. Hicklin]]'' have articulated that anything which "deprave[s] and corrupt[s] those whose minds are open to such immoral influences" was said to be obscene, and therefore banned.&lt;ref&gt;''Roth v. United States''. The Oyez Project at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law. 8 February 2012. &lt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1950-1959/1956/1956_582&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roth case gave a clearer standard for deciding what constitutes [[pornography]], stating that obscenity is material where the "dominant theme taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest", and that the "average person, applying contemporary community standards" would disapprove of, reaffirming the 1913 case ''[[United States v. Kennerley]]''. This standard allowed for many works to be called obscene, and though the Roth decision acknowledged "all ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance ... have the full protection of guaranties [sic]", the Justices put public sensibility above the protection of individual rights.

''[[Jacobellis v. Ohio]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Jacobellis v. Ohio''. The Oyez Project at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law. 8 February 2012. &lt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1960-1969/1962/1962_11_2&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; (1964) narrowed the scope of the Roth decision. [[Justice Potter Stewart]], in his concurrence to the majority opinion, created the standard whereby all speech is protected except for "hard-core pornography". As for what, exactly, constitutes hard-core pornography, Stewart said "I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description, and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that." The film in question was [[Louis Malle]]'s ''[[The Lovers (1958 film)|The Lovers]]''.

This was modified in ''[[Memoirs v. Massachusetts]]'' (1966), in which obscenity was defined as anything patently [[wikt:offensive|offensive]], appealing to [[wiktionary:prurient|prurient]] interest, and of no redeeming [[Value (ethics)|social value]]. Still, however, this left the ultimate decision of what constituted obscenity up to the whim of the courts, and did not provide an easily applicable standard for review by the lower courts. This changed in 1973 with ''[[Miller v. California]]''. The Miller case established what came to be known as the [[Miller test]], which clearly articulated that three criteria must be met for a work to be legitimately subject to state regulations. The Court recognized the inherent risk in legislating what constitutes obscenity, and necessarily limited the scope of the criteria. The criteria were:

#The average person, applying local community standards, looking at the work in its entirety, must find that it appeals to the prurient interest.
#The work must describe or depict, in an obviously offensive way, sexual conduct, or excretory functions.
#The work as a whole must lack "serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific values".

The third criterion pertains to judgement made by "reasonable persons" of the United States as a whole, while the first two pertain to that of members of the local community. Due to the larger scope of the third test, it is a more ambiguous criterion than the first two.

'''Immanuel Hermann Fichte''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɪ|x|t|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fichte "Fichte"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-de|ˈfɪçtə|lang}}; ennobled as '''Immanuel Hermann von Fichte''' in 1863; 18 July 1796 – 8 August 1879) was a [[Germans|German]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and son of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]. In his philosophy, he was a [[Theism|theist]] and strongly opposed to the [[Hegelianism|Hegelian School]].

==Life==
Fichte was born in [[Jena]]. He early devoted himself to philosophical studies, being attracted by the later views of his father, which he considered essentially theistic. He graduated from the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] in 1818. Soon after, he became a lecturer in philosophy there. He also attended the lectures of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], but felt averse to what he deemed to be his pantheistic tendencies. As a result of semi-official suggestions, based on official disapproval of his supposedly liberal views, he decided, in 1822, to leave Berlin, and accepted a professorship at the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Saarbrücken]]. In 1826 he went in the same capacity to [[Düsseldorf]]. In 1836 he became an [[extraordinary professor]] of philosophy at the [[University of Bonn]], and in 1840 [[full professor]]. Here he quickly became a successful and much admired lecturer. Dissatisfied with the reactionary tendencies of the [[Prussia]]n Ministry of Education, he accepted a call to the chair of philosophy at the [[University of Tübingen]] in 1842 where he continued to give lectures on all philosophic subjects until his retirement in 1875 when he moved to Stuttgart. He died in [[Stuttgart]] on 8 August 1879.

In 1837, Fichte founded the ''Zeitschrift für Philosophie und speculative Theologie'' and edited from then on. In 1847, the name was changed to ''[[Zeitschrift für Philosophie und philosophische Kritik]]''. Publication was suspended 1848–1852, after which [[Hermann Ulrici]] and [[Johann Ulrich Wirth]] joined him as editors.  This journal served as an organ of Fichte's views, especially on the subject of the [[philosophy of religion]], where he was in alliance with [[Christian Hermann Weisse|C. H. Weisse]] (with whom he regularly corresponded after 1829);&lt;ref&gt;Anatol Schneider, ''Personalität und Wirklichkeit: nachidealistische Schellingrezeption bei Immanuel Hermann Fichte und Christian Hermann Weisse'', Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 2001, pp. 73–4.&lt;/ref&gt; but, whereas Weisse thought that the [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] structure was sound in the main, and its imperfections might be mended, Fichte held it to be defective, and spoke of it as a masterpiece of erroneous consistency or consistent error. Fichte's general views on philosophy seem to have changed considerably as he gained in years, and his influence has been impaired by certain inconsistencies and an appearance of eclecticism, which is strengthened by his predominantly historical treatment of systems, his desire to include divergent systems within his own, and his conciliatory tone.

==Philosophical work&lt;!--'Concrete theism' and 'Concrete theist' redirect here--&gt;==
The great aim of his speculations was to find a philosophic basis for the personality of God, and for his theory on this subject he proposed the term "'''concrete theism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/f/fichteih.htm Immanuel Hermann Fichte] entry at the [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophy attempts to reconcile [[monism]] (Hegel) and [[individualism]] ([[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]]) by means of [[Monadology|monadism]] ([[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]). He attacks Hegelianism for its [[pantheism]], lowering of human personality, and imperfect recognition of demands of the moral consciousness. [[God]], he says, is to be regarded not as an [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] but as an Infinite Person, whose desire it is that he should realize himself in finite persons. These persons are objects of God's love, and he arranges the world for their good. The direct connecting link between God man is the genius, a higher spiritual individuality existing fan by the side of his lower, earthly individuality. Fichte advocates an ethical [[theism]], and his arguments might be turned to account by the apologist of Christianity. In conception of finite personality he recurs to something like monadism of Leibniz. His insistence on moral experience connected with his insistence on personality.

One of the tests which Fichte discriminates the value of previous systems is adequateness with which they interpret moral experience. The same reason that made him depreciate Hegel made him praise [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause|Krause]] ([[panentheism]]) and [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]], and speak respectfully of English philosophy. It is characteristic of Fichte's most excessive receptiveness that in his latest published work, ''Der neuere Spiritualismus'' (1878), he supports his position by arguments of a somewhat occult or [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophical]] cast, not unlike that adopted by [[Frederic William Henry Myers|F. W. H. Myers]].

The regeneration of Christianity, according to Fichte, would consist in its becoming the vital and organizing power in the state, instead of being occupied solely, as heretofore, with the salvation of individuals.

'''Jakob Sigismund Beck''' (originally '''Jacob Sigismund Beck'''; 6 August 1761 – 29 August 1840) was a [[Germany|German]] philosopher.

==Biography==
Beck was born in the village of [[Lisewo Malborskie|Liessau]] in the rural district of [[Malbork|Marienburg]] (Malbork) in [[Royal Prussia]] in 1761. The son of a priest (of Liessau), he studied (after 1783) [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Königsberg]], where [[Christian Jakob Kraus]], [[Johann Schultz]], and [[Immanuel Kant]] were his teachers. After his studies he first accepted a post as a teacher at a grammar school in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]]. With his thesis ''Dissertatio de Theoremate Tayloriano, sive de lege generali, secundum quam functionis mutantur, notatis a quibus pendent variabilibus'', which he wrote in Halle, he was qualified as a university lecturer. He then worked as a lecturer of philosophy at the [[University of Halle]] (1791–1799), before be became a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Rostock]]. He devoted himself to criticism and explanation of the doctrine of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and in 1793 published the ''Erläuternder Auszug aus den kritischen Schriften des Herrn Prof. Kant, auf Anrathen desselben'' ([[Riga]], 1793–1796), which has been widely used as a compendium of Kantian doctrine.

Beck endeavoured to explain away certain of the contradictions which are found in Kant's system by saying that much of the language is used in a popular sense for the sake of intelligibility, e.g. where Kant attributes to things-in-themselves an existence under the conditions of time, space and causality, and yet holds that they furnish the material of our apprehensions. Beck maintains that the real meaning of Kant's theory is [[idealism]]; that knowledge of objects outside the domain of consciousness is impossible, and hence that nothing positive remains when we have removed the subjective element. Matter is deduced by the original synthesis. Similarly, the idea of [[God]] is a [[symbol]]ic representation of the voice of conscience guiding from within. The value of Beck's exegesis has been to a great extent overlooked owing to the greater attention given to the work of [[J. G. Fichte]]. Beside the three volumes of the ''Erläuternder Auszug'', he published the ''Grundriss der kritischen Philosophie'' (1796), containing an interpretation of the Kantian ''Kritik'' in the manner of [[Salomon Maimon]].

Beck died in [[Rostock]].

[[File:Group Photo of members of legislative assembly ,India dated 1937-03-05.JPG|thumb|right|Dr Umar Alisha along with the Members of Legislative Assembly 1937-03-05]]
'''Kavisekhara Dr. Umar Alisha''' (28 February 1885, [[Pithapuram]] – 23 January 1945, [[Narsapur, West Godavari|Narsapur]]), was the sixth ''Peethadhipathi'' of [[Sri Viswa Viznana Vidya Adhyatmika Peetham]] in Pithapuram, [[India]]. He succeeded his father Mohiddin Badusha I.

==Background==
Dr. Umar Alisha actively participated in the [[Khilafat Movement]], a unique battle against the British rulers, waged with Gandhi caps in the early 1920s by the students of the Victoria Diamond Jubilee Medical School, which later became the [[Andhra Medical College]]. It all started on 19 September 1921 when one of the students came to the classroom sporting the [[khadi]] cap. He was incensed like his compatriots of those days over the arrest of the freedom-fighter [[Maulana Mohammad Ali]] at the [[Waltair]] (now [[Visakhapatnam]]) railway station on 1921-09-14. 

Mohammed Ali, one of the famed Ali Brothers (the other was Maulana Shaukat Ali) was proceeding to [[Madras]] along with [[Mahatma Gandhi]] by the Howrah-Madras Mail. Both the leaders alighted at the station packed with a lot of people and policemen. As soon as Mohammed Ali got down from the train, a shivering Superintendent of Police served the arrest warrant on Ali and whisked him away to Central Jail. Gandhi addressed the gathering and continued his journey to Madras.

While in jail, Ali was visited by local Congress leaders, including P.C. Venkatapathi Raju and Vasantarao Butchisundara Rao. Soon a public meeting was held on the beach where loads of foreign clothes were burnt. [[Umar Alisha I|Umar Alisha]], a Telugu poet, made a speech against the arrest of the [[Khilafat movement]] leader. On the morning of 17 September 1921, Ali was taken to the Waltair station from jail with a police escort for his departure to [[Karachi]].

'''''Knowing and the Known''''' is a 1949 book by [[John Dewey]] and [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]].

== Overview ==
As well as a Preface, an Introduction and an Index, the book consists of 12 chapters, or papers, as the authors call them in their introduction.&lt;ref name=KnowingKnown&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dewey|first1=John|title=Knowing and the Known|date=1976|publisher=Praeger|url=https://www.aier.org/sites/default/files/Files/Documents/Standard/KnowingKnownFullText.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapters 1 (Vagueness in Logic), 8 (Logic in an Age of Science) and 9 (A Confused "Semiotic") were written by Bentley; Chapter 10 (Common Sense and Science) by Dewey, while the remainder were signed jointly.

The terminology problem in the fields of [[epistemology]] and [[logic]] is partially due, according to Dewey and Bentley,&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], (1949). ''Knowing and the Known''. Beacon Press, [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]].&lt;/ref&gt; to inefficient and imprecise use of words and concepts that reflect three historic levels of organization and presentation.&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], (1949). ''Knowing and the Known''. Beacon Press, [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. p107-109&lt;/ref&gt; In the order of chronological appearance, these are :

*'''Self-Action''': Prescientific concepts regarded humans, animals, and things as possessing powers of their own which initiated or caused  their actions.
*'''Interaction''': as described by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], where things, living and inorganic, are balanced against something in a system of interaction, for example, [[Newton's laws of motion|the third law of motion]] states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
*'''Transaction''': where modern systems of descriptions and naming are employed to deal with  multiple aspects and phases of action without  any attribution to  ultimate, final, or independent entities, essences, or realities.

==Transactions==
A series of characterizations of Transactions indicate the wide range of considerations involved.&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], (1949). ''Knowing and the Known''. Beacon Press, [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. p121-139&lt;/ref&gt;

*Transaction is inquiry in which existing descriptions of events are accepted only as tentative and preliminary. New descriptions of the aspects and phases of events based on inquiry may be made at any time.
*Transaction is inquiry characterized by primary observation that may range across all subject matters that present themselves, and may proceed with freedom to re-determine and rename the objects comprised in the system.
*Transaction is Fact such that no one of  the constituents can be adequately specified  as apart from the specification of  all the other constituents of the full subject matter.
*Transaction develops and widens the phases of knowledge, and  broadens the system within the limits of observation and report.
*Transaction regards the extension in time to be comparable to the extension in space, so that “thing” is in action, and “action” is observable in things.
*Transaction assumes no pre-knowledge of either organism or environment alone as adequate, but requires their primary acceptance in a common system.
*Transaction is the procedure which observes men talking and writing, using language and other representational activities to present their perceptions and manipulations. This permits a full treatment, descriptive and functional, of the whole process inclusive of all its contents, and with the newer techniques of inquiry required.
*Transactional Observation insists on the right to freely proceed to investigate any subject matter in whatever way seems appropriate,  under reasonable hypothesis.

Illustration of differences between self-action, interaction, and transaction, as well as the different facets of transactional inquiry are provided by statements of positions that Dewey and Bentley definitely did ''not'' hold and which ''never should be read'' into their work.&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], (1949). ''Knowing and the Known''. Beacon Press, [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. p119-121&lt;/ref&gt;

# They do not use any basic differentiation of subject vs. object; of soul vs. body; of mind vs. matter; or self vs. nonself.
# They do not support the introduction of any ultimate knower from a different or superior realm to account for what is known.
# Similarly, they do not tolerate "entities" or "realities" of any kind intruding as if from behind or beyond the knowing-known events, with power to interfere.
# They exclude the introduction of "faculties" or other "operators" of an organism’s behaviors, and require for all investigations  the direct observation and contemporaneous report of findings and results.
# Especially, they recognize no names that are offered as expressions of “inner” thoughts, nor of names that reflect compulsions  by  outer objects.
# They  reject imaginary words and terms said  to lie between the organism and its environmental objects, and require the direct location and source for all observations relevant to the investigation.
# They tolerate no meanings offered as "ultimate" truth or "absolute" knowledge.
# Since they  are concerned with what is inquired into, and the process of knowings, they have no interest in any underpinning. Any statement that is or can be made about a knower, self, mind, or subject, or about a known thing, an object, or a cosmos must be made on the basis of, and in the language applicable to the specific investigation.

In summary, all of human knowledge consists of actions and products of acts in which men and women participate with other human beings, with animals and plants, as well as objects of all types, in any environment. Men and women have, are, and will present their acts of knowing and known in language. Generic people, and specific men and women, are known to be vulnerable to error. Consequently, all knowledge (knowing and known) whether commonsensical or scientific; past, present, or future; is subject to further inquiry, examination, review, and revision.

'''Marek Aleksander Cichocki''' (born 1966 in [[Warsaw]]) is a Polish philosopher, historian of political thought, journalist, conservative columnist and former advisor to [[Lech Kaczyński]], the late President of Poland.

== Biography ==

Cichocki graduated in German Studies, and in 1998 he received his PhD degree in Philosophy at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of [[Polish academy of sciences|the Polish Academy of Sciences]].

Between 1996 and 2000 he was an Assistant Professor in the Institute of Applied Social Sciences at the [[University of Warsaw]], where he has worked since 2001 as Adjunct Professor. Between 2000 and 2002 he lectured in Political Science at the [[Melchior Wankowicz Warsaw College of Journalism]]. He is also a Fellow of the [[Collegium Invisibile|Collegium Invisible]].

Cichocki's scholarly interests include history of political thought (particularly conservative thought and its contemporary perceptions) and current social and political issues including international relations, especially Polish-German relations.

He was Program Director of the Center for International Relations in Warsaw. Since 2004 he has been Program Director at the [[Natolin European Center]] and Editor-in-Chief of its  periodical. Since 2003 he has been publisher and editor-in-chief of the yearbook ''Political Theology''. He collaborates with the Center for Political Thought in Cracow. He has published a number of books, essays and articles on philosophy, political science, and international relations, including ''Polska-Unia Europejska'', ''W pół drogi'' (2002), ''Porwanie Europy'' (2004), or ''Władza i pamięć'' (2006).

Between 2007 and 2010 he co-hosted with [[Dariusz Gawin]] and [[Dariusz Karlowicz]] ''Trzeci Punkt Widzenia'' (A Third Point of View), a TV programme broadcast by the public [[Telewizja Polska|Polish Television]] (TVP).

From 11 January 2007 Cichocki served as a citizen advisor to President Lech Kaczyński.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prezydent.pl/archiwum/ludzie-prezydenta-lecha-kaczynskiego/doradcy-lecha-kaczynskiego/marek-a-cichocki/|title=Marek Aleksander Cichocki – Doradca Społeczny Prezydenta RP|language=Polish|accessdate=Feb 19, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623113249/http://www.prezydent.pl/archiwum/ludzie-prezydenta-lecha-kaczynskiego/doradcy-lecha-kaczynskiego/marek-a-cichocki|archivedate=2013-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a major Polish negotiator during the European Union summit in Brussels in June 2007.

'''Mark Lvovich Slonim''' ({{lang-ru|Марк Льво́вич Сло́ним}}, also known as '''Marc Slonim''' and '''Marco Slonim'''; March 23, 1894&lt;ref name="mlsrussi"&gt;{{it icon}} Giuseppina Giuliano, [http://www.russinitalia.it/dettaglio.php?id=387 "Mark L'vovič Slonim"], [http://www.russinitalia.it/ ''Russi in Italia'' database] entry; retrieved October 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; – 1976) was a Russian politician, literary critic, scholar and translator. He was a lifelong member of the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]], and, in 1917, served as its deputy for [[Bessarabia]] in the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]]. He joined the [[Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly|Samara Government]] during the early phases of the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]], opposing both the [[Bolsheviks]] and the conservative elements of the [[White movement]]. Assigned to his party's Foreign Delegation, Slonim lobbied unsuccessfully for the return of Bessarabia to Russia during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. After a short stay in [[Tuscany]], he settled in [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] in 1922, an editor of ''Volya Rossii'' review.

Slonim, who was also an Italian-trained literary scholar, became ''Volya Rossii''{{'}}s literary theorist and columnist. From that vantage point, he gave encouraged the liberal-progressive and [[Modernist literature|modernist]] side of the [[White émigré]] intellectuals. Slonim argued, against conservatives such as [[Zinaida Gippius]], that the exiles needed to appreciate changes occurring in the [[Soviet Union]] and became one of the first popularizers of Soviet writers in the West. He was also one of the main backers (and an intimate friend) of poet [[Marina Tsvetaeva]].

In 1928, convinced that [[Russian literature]] in exile was in fact dead, Slonim moved to Paris and, as an anti-fascist, opened up to [[Soviet socialist patriotism|Soviet patriotism]]. His 1930s contacts with the [[Union for repatriation of Russians abroad|Union for Repatriation]] were particularly controversial. He escaped World War II and arrived to the United States aboard the [[SS Navemar|SS ''Navemar'']], spending the 1940s and '50s as a teacher at [[Sarah Lawrence College]]. He continued to publish tracts and textbooks on Russian literary topics, familiarizing the American public with the major trends of Soviet poetry and fiction. He spent his final years in [[Geneva]], where he translated [[Andrei Bely]]'s ''Silver Dove'' and worked sporadically on his memoirs.

==Biography==

===Early activities===
Slonim was born in the [[Russian Empire]]'s port city of [[Odessa]] (now in [[Ukraine]]),&lt;ref name="mlsrussi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.jewishgen.org/Ukraine/RES_MNI_Det.asp?id=46305 Ukraine Master Index of Names], birth record at the office of the Odessa city rabbi, [[JewishGen]]&lt;/ref&gt; although some sources have [[Novgorod-Severskiy]], [[Chernihiv Governorate]].&lt;ref name="Aucouturier 1977 p. 411"&gt;Aucouturier &amp; Slonim (1977), p. 411; Aucouturier (1999), p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were upper-middle-class [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jewish]] intellectuals; Slonim's uncle was the literary critic [[Yuly Aykhenvald]].&lt;ref name="Aucouturier 1977 p. 411"/&gt; The future critic was also a distant relative of Yevsey Lazarevich Slonim, whose daughter, [[Véra Nabokov|Vera Yevseyevna]], became the wife of novelist [[Vladimir Nabokov]].&lt;ref name="boyd85"&gt;[[Brian Boyd]], ''Vladimir Nabokov: The American Years'', p. 85. Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]], 1991.  {{ISBN|0-691-06797-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Russologist Michel Aucouturier, Slonim's memoirs show him as an erudite and an adept of [[aestheticism]], whose "socialist sympathies" were only cemented by the [[Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Aucouturier p. 411"&gt;Aucouturier &amp; Slonim (1977), p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; While completing his secondary studies at a classical gymnasium in Odessa, Slonim came into contact with the Socialist Revolutionaries (or "Esers"), and, like his older brother Vladimir before him, became their follower.&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier &amp; Slonim (1977), pp. 411, 413–415&lt;/ref&gt; Their radicalism pitied them against their father, who supported the moderate-liberal [[Constitutional Democratic Party|Kadet Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier &amp; Slonim (1977), p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;

Slonim, who regarded himself as a [[libertarian socialist]] rather than a [[Marxism|Marxist]], worked on establishing "self-instruction circles", circulating banned literature among students, artisans and workers, and traveled to Europe to meet with [[Osip Minor]].&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier &amp; Slonim (1977), pp. 414–417&lt;/ref&gt; As he recalled in the 1960s, the Eser leadership was "appalled to discover than in Odessa and the nearby region most of the work was being done by boys and girls of 16 or 17."&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier &amp; Slonim (1977), p. 417&lt;/ref&gt; According to later sources, he was brought to the attention of the [[Okhrana]] and left Russia surreptitiously.&lt;ref name="mlsrussi"/&gt; From 1911, he studied philosophy and literature at the [[University of Florence]],&lt;ref name="csimigr343"&gt;{{it icon}} Claudia Scandura, [http://www.europaorientalis.it/uploads/files/1995%20n.2/1995%20n.%202.16.pdf "L'Emigrazione russa in Italia: 1918–1919"], in ''Europa Orientalis'', Vol. 14, Issue 2, 1995, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; where he took his [[Ph.D.]]&lt;ref name="krfreedom"&gt;Katharine Reece, [https://www.sarahlawrence.edu/magazine/then-now/features/recovering-marc.html "Freedom of Thought, Freedom to Learn: Recovering Marc Slonim"], in ''Sarah Lawrence Magazine'', Spring 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, he published in Italy a translation of [[Ivan Turgenev]]'s poetry cicle, ''Senility''.&lt;ref name="mlsrussi"/&gt; By 1918, Slonim was also a graduate of [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg Imperial University]].&lt;ref name="mlsrussi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the start of World War I, Slonim followed the "defensist" line of the Eser mainstream, supporting Russia's commitment to the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], and served in the [[Imperial Russian Army|Imperial Army]]. The [[February Revolution]] caught him on the [[Romania in World War I|Romanian Front]],&lt;ref&gt;Constantin ''et al.'' (2011), pp. 394, 404; White, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; but he soon returned to [[Petrograd]], where (Aucouturier writes) "his talents as a propagandist and an orator soon made him one of his party's celebrities".&lt;ref name="Aucouturier p. 411"/&gt; Slonim supported the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and its "defensist" policies against the [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries|Left Esers]], with public disputations against [[Vladimir Karelin]] and [[Maria Spiridonova]].&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier &amp; Slonim (1977), pp. 424–428. See also White, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; According to Slonim, he was one of the youths left in charge of party work: the more senior Esers were either in government or consumed by work in the [[Petrograd Soviet|Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies]].&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier &amp; Slonim (1977), pp. 423–424&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constituent Assembly and Paris Conference===
In his memoirs, Slonim claims to have foreseen the danger posed by the reorganized [[Bolsheviks]], having heard their leader, [[Vladimir Lenin]], speak. He contrasts Bolshevik unity with the Esers' indecisiveness and factionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier &amp; Slonim (1977), pp. 429–434&lt;/ref&gt; He was still active after the [[October Revolution]], which placed Russia under a Bolshevik [[Council of People's Commissars]]. Slonim became an Eser candidate for the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]] in the [[Russian Constituent Assembly election, 1917|November 25 election]], running in the southwestern province of [[Bessarabia]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantin ''et al.'' (2011), p. 147; (2012), pp. 24, 391, 394, 404–406&lt;/ref&gt; He took his seat in the Eser landslide win, and, aged 23, was the youngest parliamentarian.&lt;ref name="krfreedom"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier &amp; Slonim  (1977), p. 411; Aucouturier (1999), p. 379&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lbflamb"&gt;{{fr icon}} Laurent Béghin, [https://textyles.revues.org/2539 "La revue ''Le Flambeau'' et les littératures slaves (1918–1940)"], in ''Textyles'', No. 45, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Days after, Bessarabia formed its own government as the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]], and remained undecided about its future within the [[Russian Republic]]. The elections for the Constituent Assembly were chaotic, and the results were never fully recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt;

Slonim was present in the Assembly on the morning of January 19, 1918, when the Bolsheviks dissolved it by force and opened fire on the supporting crowds.&lt;ref name="krfreedom"/&gt; For a while, he was in the [[Ukrainian State]], helping [[Gregory Zilboorg]] put out a clandestine paper which angered both the Bolsheviks and the [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian nationalists]].&lt;ref&gt;Zilboorg &amp; Slonim, pp. xix–xx&lt;/ref&gt; He later fled to [[Samara, Russia|Samara]], where the Constituent Assembly had formed its own [[Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly|"Committee of Members" government]]. He joined the latter, then, upon its merger into the [[Provisional All-Russian Government]], moved to [[Omsk]].&lt;ref name="Aucouturier 1999, p. 379"&gt;Aucouturier (1999), p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Russian Civil War]] took hold of the countryside, Slonim followed the [[Czechoslovak Legion]] and became friends with its leaders,&lt;ref name="Aucouturier 1999, p. 379"/&gt; trailing across Siberia under an assumed name.&lt;ref name="krfreedom"/&gt; Nevertheless, he disliked the concept of [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied intervention]], and moved closer to the Left Esers. His party sent him abroad as a member of its Foreign Delegation, which originally existed to put persuade the West not to recognize [[Alexander Kolchak]] as Russia's Supreme Ruler.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1918, Slonim had lost his Bessarabian constituency, as the region [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|united with Romania]]. The writer became a strong critic of that merger, claiming that the Romanian identity in both Romania and Bessarabia had been recently fabricated by intellectuals, lacking popular support among the Moldavian peasants (''see [[Moldovenism]]'').&lt;ref name="White, p. 88"&gt;White, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Slonim also claimed that the union process had been triggered by the [[German Empire]] in late 1917, as an anti-Bolshevik move, and supported by Russians who had discarded "personal and national dignity."&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 88. See also Clark, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt; Building on such arguments, Slonim depicted the Russian Empire as a functional and organic economic entity, suggesting that Bessarabia had more in common with Ukraine than with Romania.&lt;ref name="White, p. 88"/&gt;

He also argued that Bessarabia had not been renounced by Russia, not truly annexed by the [[Romanian Kingdom]]. "Sooner of later", he suggested, "there must come about [Bessarabia's] reunion with the Russian State."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledging that there was a "united front" between the [[White movement]] and [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] on the Bessarabian issue, he proposed to overcome the impasse by organizing a [[League of Nations]] referendum in the former Moldavian Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 235–237&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar [[Charles Upson Clark]], who sees Slonim's accounts as among "the best [...] from the Russian standpoint", rejects his theory about the German inspiration for the union, noting that it was in fact a traditional Romanian goal.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 166, 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Slonim joined a self-appointed team of politicians and landowners who claimed to speak for Bessarabia, and attended the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] to lobby for the Russian cause. Among the other members of this body were [[Alexander N. Krupensky]], [[Alexandr K. Schmidt]], [[Vladimir Tsyganko]], and [[Mihail Savenco]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantin ''et al.'' (2011), p. 147; (2012), pp. 391–394&lt;/ref&gt; Slonim, seconded by Tsyganko, circulated rumors of "unheard-of atrocities" committed by the [[Romanian Army]], such as the massacre of 53 people in one village of [[Hotin County]], and the torturing of many others. Interviewed by ''[[L'Humanité]]'', the [[French Communist Party]] paper, Slonim also claimed the socialists were being repressed, and that unconditional union had been voted on "under the menace of machine guns".&lt;ref&gt;A. P., "Atrocités roumaines en Bessarabie. Le Récit de Marco Slonim, ex-député de la Constituante", in ''[[L'Humanité]]'', June 22, 1919, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; These statements were rejected outright by the Bessarabian unionists: [[Ion Inculeț]], the former [[President of Moldova|President of the Moldavian Republic]], called the interview "idiotic", while his aide [[Ion Pelivan]] wrote to ''L'Humanité'' to restate that the union was expressing the free will of the Bessarabian people.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin ''et al.'' (2011), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; In his notes, Pelivan referred to Slonim as a "deserter", an "impostor", and a [[History of the Jews in Belarus|Belarusian Jew]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantin ''et al.'' (2012), pp. 394, 404–406&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tuscany, Berlin, and ''Volya Rossii''===
Slonim spent the years 1919–1922 in [[Tuscany]], becoming a regular contributor to the leftist daily ''[[Il Secolo]]''.&lt;ref name="mlsrussi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csimigr343"/&gt; In an article of August 1920, he opined that only "peace with Russia" and "the complete renunciation of all intervention into [her] internal affairs" could ensure the demise of "[[Soviet Empire|Bolshevist imperialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin Quotidien de Presse Étrangère'', No. 1530, August 21, 1920, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he published at H. Bemporad &amp; figlio an Italian-language work on the revolutionary ideologies of [[Béla Kun]] and the [[Spartacus League]], eponymously titled ''Spartaco e Bela Kun'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Maffio Maffii]], "Notizie bibliografiche: Politica e problemi sociali", in ''L'Italia che Scrive'', Vol. IV, Issue 1, January 1921, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and two memoirs: ''La rivoluzione russa'' ("The Russian Revolution"), and ''Il bolscevismo visto da un russo'' ("Bolshevism as Seen by a Russian").&lt;ref name="mlsrussi"/&gt; The latter was translated into French the following year, as ''Le Bolchévisme vu par un russe''. ''La Revue Critique des Idées et des Livres'' described it as "abundant in little facts from experience", a fresco "of the general misery, terror and fright that have been reigning in Russia for these past three years."&lt;ref&gt;J. M., "Les livres. Politique: ''Le Bolchévisme vu par un russe''", in ''La Revue Critique des Idées et des Livres'', Vol. XXXI, January–March 1921, p. 760&lt;/ref&gt; His thoughts on communism brought him to the attention of [[Benito Mussolini]], leader of the [[Fasci Italiani di Combattimento|Fasci Italiani]], who invited Slonim to write for ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]''.&lt;ref name="mlsrussi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csimigr343"/&gt; Slonim explained that he would never write for the right-wing press; in a later reply, Mussolini insisted that his budding fascist movement was not in fact [[reactionary]].&lt;ref name="csimigr343"/&gt;

Another work, tracing the historical background of Bolshevism and the Esers, appeared in 1921 as ''Da Pietro il Grande a Lenin: Storia del movimento rivoluzionario in Russia'' ("From [[Peter the Great]] to Lenin: History of the Revolutionary Movement in Russia");&lt;ref name="mlsrussi"/&gt; a French edition came out in 1933, at [[Éditions Gallimard]].&lt;ref&gt;Livak (2010), p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; Slonim followed up with an essay on Bolshevik [[Proletkult]] and [[Russian Futurism|Futurism]], taken up by [[Henri Grégoire (historian)|Henri Grégoire]]'s monthly, ''Le Flambeau'' (October 1921). At this early stage, Slonim derided Soviet literary productions, and described the better poets ([[Alexander Blok]] and [[Andrei Bely]]) as incompatible with communist dogmas.&lt;ref name="lbflamb"/&gt;

After a short stay in Berlin, during which time he issued his own journal, ''Novosti Literatury'',&lt;ref name="mlsrussi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Platone, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Slonim settled in [[Prague]], [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]], where he taught at the Russian Free University&lt;ref name="vcpaster"&gt;[http://newspaperarchives.vassar.edu/cgi-bin/vassar?a=d&amp;d=miscellany19590218-01.2.6# "Slonim Views Pasternak's Philosophy in V.C. Lecture"], in ''Vassar Miscellany News'', Vol. XXXXIII, Issue 16, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; and joined the local ''[[Zemgor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; He was also co-opted to write for the Russian-language émigré magazine ''Volya Rossii'' ("Russia's Will", "Russia's Freedom", or "Russia's Free Will"). Its editorial board included Slonim (editorial secretary to 1923, later full editor),&lt;ref name="Aucouturier 1999, p. 379"/&gt; [[Sergey Postnikov]], [[Evsei Stalinskii]], [[Vasily Sukhomlin]], and [[Vladimir Ivanovich Lebedev|Vladimir I. Lebedev]]. The former four were all members of the Eser Foreign Delegation; Lebedev was not.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 25, 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Occupying a Prague building which had reputedly housed [[Mozart]], and also gathering for conversations at ''Národní kavárna'' café, the circle members networked with European policymakers such as [[Aristide Briand]], [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]], and [[Émile Vandervelde]].&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; Although it published noted works of literature, including [[Marina Tsvetaeva]]'s ''Rat-Catcher'', ''Volya Rossii'' had a small readership.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Livingstone, "The Text and Publication", in [[Marina Tsvetaeva]], ''The Ratcatcher: A Lyrical Satire'', p. 32. Evanston: [[Northwestern University Press]], 1999.  {{ISBN|0-8101-1816-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depended largely on Czechoslovak government support, but the subsidies grew thinner by the year.&lt;ref name="Aucouturier 1999, p. 389"&gt;Aucouturier (1999), p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a daily in 1920, it became a weekly in 1922, and a monthly in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier (1999), p. 377; White, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

From its relaunch in 1923, ''Volya Rossii'' was primarily noted as an exponent of the political left, and as such a rival of the more eclectic, Paris-based, ''[[Sovremennye Zapiski]]''. Its acceptance of various Bolshevik reforms made it close to the ''[[Mladorossi]]'' émigrés,&lt;ref name="Aucouturier 1999, pp. 377–378"&gt;Aucouturier (1999), pp. 377–378&lt;/ref&gt; but the magazine saw itself as eminently [[Narodniks|Narodnik]], carrying through the ideology of [[Alexander Herzen]] and [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond them, Slonim saw himself as a legatee of the [[Union of Salvation|Decembrists]].&lt;ref name="Aucouturier 1999, p. 379"/&gt; ''Volya Rossii'' was explicitly against the [[Constitutional Democratic Party|Kadet]] émigrés in Paris, and fought with their leader, [[Pyotr Struve]], for control over the Russian Free University.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 36–38&lt;/ref&gt; It also took a secular approach to anti-communism, decrying the émigrés' debt to [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]]—the church, Slonim asserted, was not a true foundation of Russian identity and culture.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; These positions were summarized in Slonim's sarcastic characterization of ''Sovremennye Zapiski'', a "non-partisan voice of the liberal-democratic broad front, with some tendencies that are sometimes socialist, sometimes religious."&lt;ref&gt;Renna, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary columnist===
''Volya Rossii'' stated its support for "[[Ethical socialism|moral socialism]]", relying on "the spontaneous activity and creativity of the masses."&lt;ref name="Aucouturier 1999, pp. 377–378"/&gt; While the group rallied around Slonim's ideas about Russian organicism and post-imperial federalism, it also firmly rejected expressions of [[Russian nationalism]], envisioning a Russia that rejected "all differences of faith, race or religion".&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt; Slonim himself was a noted adversary of [[Eurasianism]] and theories of Russian exceptionalism, which understood Bolshevism as [[National Bolshevism|compatible with nationalist ideas]]. He interpreted Bolshevism as a "[[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]]" experiment in state control; he still believed in the regime's inevitable failure, and in the reemergence of democratic Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Dmitry Shlapentokh, "Thermidor or Mongol Empire. History as Political Model in Russian Émigré Thought", in ''Cahiers du Monde Russe et Soviétique'', Vol. 32, Issue 3, 1991, pp. 393, 406&lt;/ref&gt; However, as he reported to [[Alexander Kerensky]], the Prague Esers feared the growth of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia's Communist Party]], which could turn on the émigré community.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

While contributing articles on political news and historical sketches, as well as impressions from a 1926 trip to the United States and a 1928 homage to Prague, Slonim became the main literary chronicler at ''Volya Rossii''.&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier (1999), pp. 379–380&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the importance of [[Russian literature]] was to be found in its ability to convey "the vital problems of individual and social existence", and hoped that this tradition would be carried on in exile: "We know that the best among [émigré writers] made their way through suffering and struggle."&lt;ref&gt;Livak (2003), pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1925, Slonim focused his polemics on [[Zinaida Gippius]], whose articles in ''Sovremennye Zapiski'' prophesied the death of Russian literature. Chiding the "old guard" of Russian literati, he argued instead that modern literature was thriving both in Russia and in exile.&lt;ref&gt;Platone, pp. 182–183; Renna, pp. 24–25, 28&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, Gippius came to regard Slonim with intense hostility, particularly since he also promoted Tsvetaeva, her personal enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Karlinsky, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

While their [[Acmeist poetry|Acmeist]] rival [[Georgy Adamovich]] wanted to see through the emergence of a Russian [[psychological novel]], Slonim and [[Ivan Bunin]] believed that psychological introspection and [[social realism]] could still blend into a coherent whole: "spiritual vicissitudes had to be illustrated from the outside so that the reader could see them."&lt;ref&gt;Livak (2003), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; They urged émigrés to follow [[Modernist literature|modernist]] developments and replicate steps taken in Soviet literature. As a reviewer of Soviet works, Slonim identified echoes of the 19th-century philosophical and political epics, showing up in novels by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], [[Boris Pasternak]], [[Vsevolod Ivanov]] and [[Yury Olesha]].&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier (1999), p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; He looked with political optimism to the unfolding of the [[New Economic Policy]], which took Russia back to grassroots capitalism. Slonim searched for clues that communist writers were growing disenchanted with the Soviet state, and kept records about the "more tiresome and woeful" literature of [[agitprop]].&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier (1999), pp. 386–387&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to illustrate such points, ''Volya Rossii'' published fragments of works by Zamyatin, but also by [[Isaac Babel]] and [[Mikhail Sholokhov]], alongside [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] or [[Karel Čapek]].&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; ''Volya Rossii'' soon patronized a generation of émigré modernists, beginning with Tsvetaeva and [[Aleksey Remizov]], followed later by [[Nina Berberova]], [[Dovid Knut]], [[Valentin Parnakh]], [[Vladimir Pozner]], [[Gleb Struve]], and [[Yuri Terapiano]].&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier (1999), p. 380&lt;/ref&gt; However, Slonim's encouragement had a perverse effect: in Russia, authors praised by Slonim or sampled in ''Volya Rossii'' were singled out as potential enemies of the regime. In 1927, the magazine hosted fragments from Zamyatin's novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', the first publication of that work in its original Russian.&lt;ref name="krfreedom"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zilboorg &amp; Slonim, p. xx&lt;/ref&gt; In order not to expose the author's direct contacts with the émigrés, Slonim claimed that these were back-translations from Czech and English reprints.&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier (1999), p. 387; Zilboorg &amp; Slonim, pp. xx–xxi&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Slonim's positive reviews of ''[[Krasnaya Nov']]'' magazine were used against its editor, [[Aleksandr Voronsky]], who was eventually purged from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Maguire, ''Red Virgin Soil: Soviet Literature in the 1920's'', p. 164. Evanston: [[Northwestern University Press]], 2000.  {{ISBN|0-8101-1741-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slonim became a backer of Tsvetaeva and her husband [[Sergei Efron]], who had settled in Prague. Together with [[Salomeya Halpern]], [[Hélène Iswolsky]], [[D. S. Mirsky]] and Lebedev, he organized a Committee to Assist Marina Tsvetaeva.&lt;ref&gt;Feiler, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; He became a friend, confidant, and dedicated promoter of Tsvetaeva, even though she declined interest in Eser ideology and political matters in general.&lt;ref name="krfreedom"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feiler, pp. 125–126, 152–154, 189, 194–195, 240–241; Karlinsky, pp. 127, 160, 188, 201, 223–225, 250&lt;/ref&gt; They continued to disagree over politics, whenever Tsvetaeva made a public show of her loyalty for the [[House of Romanov]].&lt;ref&gt;Feiler, pp. 125–126, 194–195&lt;/ref&gt; Their liaison had romantic undertones: to Tsvetaeva, he was "the dear one", and his departure to be with another woman inspired her to write the poem "Attempt at Jealousy". Thinking that she held an idealized view of him, Slonim, newly separated from his first wife, rejected her advances in 1924, but they remained friends.&lt;ref&gt;Feiler, pp. 152–154&lt;/ref&gt; He was critical of her affair with K. B. Rodzevitch, whom he regarded as a "dull, mediocre" man.&lt;ref&gt;Feiler, pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move to Paris===
By the late 1920s, Slonim had come to share Gippius' opinion that Russian literature in exile was doomed, its links with the Russian soil forever severed.&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier (1999), pp. 378–379, 380; Livak (2003), pp. 33, 109&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that, from 1926 on, the Foreign Delegation had only relied on Soviet publications for understanding the goings-on in Russia,&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 41, 96, 113&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that Soviet literature could be followed for its documentary value.&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier (1999), p. 381&lt;/ref&gt; He himself published an introduction to Russian literature in the 1927 edition of ''[[Slovanský Přehled]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Cronique. Publications", in ''Revue des Études Slaves'', Vol. 8, Issue 1, 1928, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; His skepticism was also showing in his political essays, where he asserted that the Eser cause had been stifled by the [[1922 Moscow Trial of Socialist Revolutionaries|1922 Show Trials]].&lt;ref&gt;Marc Jansen, ''A Show Trial Under Lenin: The Trial of the Socialist Revolutionaries, Moscow 1922'', p. 177. The Hague etc.: [[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]], 1982.  {{ISBN|978-94-009-7608-5}}; White, pp. 96–101&lt;/ref&gt; By then, the Esers' Prague group had become torn between two camps, each accusing the other of serving the Soviets. One was led by [[Viktor Chernov]], the other (comprising the ''Volya Rossii'' group) was headed by Sukhomlin.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 96–100&lt;/ref&gt; Slonim also had a quarrel with writer [[Vasily Yanovsky]]—reportedly, because he commented on Yanovsky's poor use of Russian and his borrowings from [[Mikhail Artsybashev]].&lt;ref&gt;Livak (2003), p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Slonim purchased a printing press in Paris, where he hoped to relaunch ''Volya Rossii''.&lt;ref name="Aucouturier 1999, p. 389"/&gt; He ultimately abandoned the plan and, in 1928, simply relocated to Paris, together with Stalinskii and Sukhomlin.&lt;ref name="White, p. 131"&gt;White, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; They reinforced a Russian colony that was just growing in importance, as French interest in Russian affairs was about to peak.&lt;ref&gt;Livak (2010), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; ''Volya Rossii'' continued to appear in Prague until March 1932,&lt;ref name="Aucouturier 1999, p. 389"/&gt; when it closed down as a result of the Chernov scandal.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 98, 130–131&lt;/ref&gt; In its last years, it supported the [[Right Opposition]] and the [[first five-year plan|Five-Year Plan]], seeing them as evidence of Soviet normalization, and a promise for Eser uprisings. Lebedev even claimed to have traveled inside the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 100–107, 128–130&lt;/ref&gt; Slonim remained skeptical of this "mysticism", while also noting that the expanding [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] regime had emerged from industrialization as a "petty bourgeois" force, its appeal increased among émigré monarchists and Eurasianists.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 129–130&lt;/ref&gt; His articles were regularly featured in other émigré publications: ''Sotsialist-Revolyutsioner'', ''Problemy'' and ''Novaya Gazeta'' in Paris; ''Russkiy Arkhiv'' of [[Belgrade]]; and the American ''Moskva''.&lt;ref name="mlsrussi"/&gt;

Slonim was focusing his attention on writing counter-propaganda descriptions of [[Socialist Realism]], which was entering the official Soviet literary and political discourse under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Readers of his work provide contrasting reviews: Aucouturier finds his 1930 study on ''Stalinism in Literature'' "important";&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier (1999), p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; however, according to the Russian sociologist Evgeny Dobrenko, Slonim's contribution here "overstep[s] the boundaries of scholarship."&lt;ref&gt;Evgeny Dobrenko, ''The Making of the State Writer: Social and Aesthetic Origins of Soviet Literary Culture'', p. 409. Stanford: [[Stanford University Press]], 2001.  {{ISBN|0-8047-3364-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he still upheld the old Narodnik values, Slonim favored aestheticism and [[Russian formalism|formalism]] over [[social determinism]], and, on these grounds, criticized [[Pavel Milyukov]]'s work in literary history.&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier (1999), pp. 381–384; Renna, pp. 26–29&lt;/ref&gt; He also looked for tensions between the official dogma and writers who still cultivated individualism in its various forms, citing works by Pasternak,&lt;ref&gt;Renna, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artyom Vesyoly]], [[Yury Libedinsky]], and [[Leonid Leonov]].&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier (1999), pp. 383–385, 388&lt;/ref&gt; He welcomed Stalin's decision to disband the [[Russian Association of Proletarian Writers]], seeing it as a "Charter of Liberation" for the nonconformist authors.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris, Slonim set up his own literary society, ''Kochev'ye'' ("Camp of Nomads"), its name probably alluding to the [[Primitivism|primitivist]] aesthetics of the Left Esers.&lt;ref name="Aucouturier 1999, p. 389"/&gt; It held weekly session opposite [[Gare Montparnasse]], until 1938, when it dissolved.&lt;ref name="mlsrussi"/&gt; Like [[Nikolai Berdyaev]] and [[Nicholas Zernov]], Slonim also attached himself to the French Catholic circles, which welcomed Russian liberals who were at once anti-communist and anti-fascist.&lt;ref&gt;Livak (2010), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; He was also close to avant-garde painters [[Mikhail Larionov]] and [[Natalia Goncharova]], whom he introduced to Efron and Tsvetaeva when the latter couple also settled in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Feiler, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, he attended a symposium grouping ''Chisla'' magazine writers and members of the [[French Communist Party]], discussing [[André Gide]]'s account of life in the Soviet Union. The meeting veered into scandal when (according to Slonim's account) he took the rostrum and informed both camps that Gide was not in fact a convert to communism, and that "instead of making loud pronouncement they had better read Gide's oeuvre."&lt;ref&gt;Livak (2003), pp. 225–226&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impresario and Soviet "defensist"===
Slonim's work diversified, and he became a literary impresario, founding, with [[George Reavey]], the European Literary Bureau. It had contracts with Berdyaev, [[Samuel Beckett]], [[André Malraux]] and [[Jacques Maritain]].&lt;ref name="White, p. 131"/&gt; He also worked on translations and on editing books for print: in 1930, [[Čestmír Jeřábek]]'s ''Svět hoří''; and in 1934, [[Adèle Hommaire de Hell]]'s ''Mémoires d'une aventurière''.&lt;ref name="Livak 2010, p. 384"&gt;Livak (2010), p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Reavey, he put out one of the first collections of Russian prose rendered in English (1934), which is also noted for its inclusion of Socialist Realists [[Alexander Fadeyev (writer)|Alexander Fadeyev]] and [[Feodor Gladkov]].&lt;ref name="White, p. 131"/&gt; With Gide's help,&lt;ref&gt;Livak (2010), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Slonim and Reavey's anthology of Soviet literature came at Gallimard in 1935, and possibly included unsigned translations by Tsvetaeva.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Kemball]], "Barbarismes et «couleur locale» dans le lexique poétique de Blok. Essai d'analyse plurilingue", in ''Revue des Études Slaves'', Vol. 54, Part 4, 1982, p. 682&lt;/ref&gt; Slonim was by then also publishing regular literary chronicles, turning his attention to works by [[William Faulkner]], [[Peter Neagoe]], and [[D. H. Lawrence]].&lt;ref&gt;Livak (2010), pp. 383–384&lt;/ref&gt;

Slonim was for years critical of émigrés who asked to be resettled in the Soviet Union, denouncing Efron's work for the [[NKVD]]-sponsored [[Union for repatriation of Russians abroad|Union for Repatriation]].&lt;ref&gt;Feiler, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, he finally met Zamyatin, who had escaped Russia, and they "became very good friends"—before Zamyatin's sudden illness and death.&lt;ref&gt;Zilboorg &amp; Slonim, pp. xxii–xxv&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, Slonim had resumed his conferencing on Lenin, networking with Italian anti-fascists such as [[Oddino Morgari]] and [[Alberto Meschi]], and being followed around by Mussolini's [[OVRA]].&lt;ref name="mlsrussi"/&gt;

Slonim and Lebedev became alarmed by the rise of [[Nazi Germany]], and predicted that it would attack the Soviet Union with support from the right-wing exiles. With this in mind, they founded in 1936 a Russian Émigré Defensist Movement (REOD), its newspaper edited by Slonim.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 133–135&lt;/ref&gt; Slonim came to agree with the basic tenets of Soviet thinking: he believed that democracy was doomed, and that the world was becoming split into two camps, of communism and fascism.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 134–135, 138&lt;/ref&gt; He formulated his preference into a [[Soviet socialist patriotism|socialist-patriotic]] manifesto: "The defensist joyfully greets all tidings of the internal and external successes of Russia. When a new factory is built in the Soviet Union, when a strong army is created, when a heroic ﬂight is made, when important discoveries are made and when a talented book is written, the defensist feels a sense of pride."&lt;ref name="White, p. 134"&gt;White, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

He put out in 1935 a sympathetic book on the ill-fated expedition of [[SS Chelyuskin|''SS'' Chelyuskin]], followed in 1937 by ''Les onzes républiques soviétiques'' ("The Eleven [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]]"), at [[Éditions Payot]].&lt;ref&gt;Livak (2010), pp. 383, 384; White, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; The latter book was well-liked in the Soviet Union itself, and recommended by [[Intourist]],&lt;ref name="White, p. 134"/&gt; but criticized by [[Pierre (Piotr) Pascal|Pierre Pascal]] for its geographical and historical inaccuracies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre (Piotr) Pascal|Pierre Pascal]], "Notes bibliographiques. U.R.S.S.: Marc Slonim, ''Les onzes républiques soviétiques''", in ''[[Revue Historique]]'', Vol. 182, June 1938, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, Slonim also translated [[Viktor Shklovsky]]'s ''Voyage de Marco Polo''.&lt;ref name="Livak 2010, p. 384"/&gt; However, he had grown more appreciative of the ''Sovremennye Zapiski'' writers, and in 1939, published generous commentary on [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s work, beginning with ''[[King, Queen, Knave]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Duncan Morris, ''Vladimir Nabokov: Poetry and the Lyric Voice'', p. 393. Toronto etc.: [[University of Toronto Press]], 2010.  {{ISBN|978-1-4426-4020-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Slonim also completed a version of Bunin's ''Liberation of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]'', published by Gallimard but disliked by the author.&lt;ref&gt;Livak (2010), pp. 39, 95&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lebedev abandoned the REOD and moved to America in 1936, Slonim continued his work. This was an especially controversial decision, as the REOD became exposed for its links with the Union for Repatriation and the NKVD. Slonim ultimately presented his resignation in July 1938.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 135, 137–138&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1939, he met Tsvetaeva one final time in Paris, as she and Efron began their return trip to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Feiler, pp. 240–241&lt;/ref&gt; Slonim was still in Paris after the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Nazi–Soviet Pact]] and before the [[Battle of France|Nazi invasion of France]]. Arrested for his contacts with the French communists, he was sent to a French concentration camp.&lt;ref name="White, p. 138"&gt;White, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; By August 1941, he was in Spain, taking the [[SS Navemar|SS ''Navemar'']] from [[Seville]] to New York City. He completed the journey, despite the ''Navemar''{{'}}s "criminally inadequate" facilities, alongside friends [[Zosa Szajkowski]] and [[Mark Zborowski]].&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Moses Leff, ''The Archive Thief: The Man Who Salvaged French Jewish History in the Wake of the Holocaust'', pp. 72–73. Oxford etc.: [[Oxford University Press]], 2015.  {{ISBN|978-0-19-938095-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarah Lawrence College===
Slonim initially lectured on Russian topics at [[Yale College|Yale]], [[University of Chicago|Chicago]] and [[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]], before becoming, in 1943, a professor of Russian and [[comparative literature]] at [[Sarah Lawrence College]], [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]].&lt;ref name="vcpaster"/&gt; While publishing various pieces in American academic journals,&lt;ref name="vcpaster"/&gt; Slonim also contributed to the Jewish cultural review ''Yevreiski Mir''. In a 1944 article for that magazine (quoted favorably by scholar Simon Markish),&lt;ref&gt;Simon Markish, "À propos de l'histoire et de la méthodologie de l'étude de la littérature juive d'expression russe", in ''Cahiers du Monde Russe et Soviétique'', Vol. 26, Issue 2, 1985, pp. 140–141&lt;/ref&gt; he denied the existence of a separate [[Jewish literature]] in Russia, proposing that Jewish authors were merely Russian authors. His stance in this far-reaching debate about [[Jewish assimilation]] was similar to that of his uncle Aykhenvald, including their proposed reference to Jewish writers as "writers who are Jews".&lt;ref&gt;Shrayer, pp. xliii, xlvii–xlviii&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1944, he lectured at the [[Phillips Academy]] East and West Association on the issue of [[Russia–United States relations]].&lt;ref&gt;J.R.W.D., "General School Interests. East and West Lectures Series", in ''The Phillips Bulletin'', Vol. 39, Issue 3, 1945, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Slonim was viewed with caution by the American Esers. They investigated his REOD activity and concluded that he had shown callousness, and had mixed with NKVD envoys, but cleared him of allegations that he had been a spy himself.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 135, 138&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi attack on the Soviet Union]], Slonim and his colleagues, reunited in New York City, resumed the "defensist" line, unconditionally; Chernov took a more moderate stance.&lt;ref name="White, p. 138"/&gt; In February 1945, Slonim finally met Nabokov at a dinner party in New York. Nabokov dismissed him as a Soviet agent, and probably used him as an inspiration for the novella ''Double Talk''.&lt;ref name="boyd85"/&gt; Nabokov's reading is dismissed by his exegetes: Vladimir E. Alexandrov speaks of Nabokov's "unjustified suspicions, including his snubbing of Marc Slonim";&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir E. Alexandrov, ''The Garland Companion to Vladimir Nabokov'', p. 627. New York City &amp; Oxon: [[Routledge]], 1995.  {{ISBN|0-8153-0354-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Boyd]] also notes that Slonim "was in fact firmly against Stalin and the Soviet system."&lt;ref name="boyd85"/&gt; Before 1950, Slonim was again banned in the Soviet Union and the [[Eastern bloc]]: copies of ''Le Bolchévisme vu par un russe'' were confiscated on sight by the [[Ministry of Communications and Information Society (Romania)|Romanian Propaganda Ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;"Comunicate și circulări ministeriale. Ministerul informațiunilor", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', March 25, 1947, p. 2262&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, [[Oxford University Press]] released Slonim's literary panorama, ''The Epic of Russian Literature from Its Origins Through Tolstoy''. According to the ''Revue des Études Slaves'', it was an "intelligent and alert" work, appealing "to the cultivated public rather than the specialists". ''The Epic'', echoing the approach of [[Eugène-Melchior de Vogüé]], focused on the 19th-century novels and debates, being more dismissive of earlier literature.&lt;ref&gt;"Cronique. Publications", in ''Revue des Études Slaves'', Vol. 29, Issue 1, 1952, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; He followed up in 1953 with a second volume, ''Modern Russian Literature'', covering the period from [[Anton Chekhov]] to the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Aucouturier p. 411"/&gt; and a biographical study, ''Tri lyubi Dostoyevskogo'' ("Three Loves of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoevsky]]").&lt;ref name="mlsrussi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aucouturier p. 411"/&gt;&lt;ref name="krfreedom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vcpaster"/&gt; He returned to Italy on a research trip, employed by [[Sapienza University of Rome|La Sapienza University]]'s Institute for Slavic Philology, and, in 1954, edited the collection ''Modern Italian Short Stories''.&lt;ref name="mlsrussi"/&gt; In 1954, at the height of [[McCarthyism]], he appeared before the [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Jenner Committee]], dismissing rumors of communist activities at Sarah Lawrence.&lt;ref name="krfreedom"/&gt;

Additionally, Slonim worked with [[Harvey Breit]] on a [[New American Library|Signet]] anthology of love stories, which appeared in 1955 as ''This Thing Called Love''.&lt;ref&gt;Rochelle Girson, "Time for a Little More 'Yin'", in ''[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]'', October 2, 1955, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, he lectured at [[Vassar College|Vassar]] on Pasternak's philosophical outlook.&lt;ref name="vcpaster"/&gt; A year later, he commemorated Pasternak by moderating a round table for [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Liberty]]. Guests included Reavey, [[B. J. Chute]], [[Herbert Gold]], [[Ferenc Körmendi]], and [[Santha Rama Rau]].&lt;ref&gt;Sosin, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1960, he collected and edited for print selections from [[Mikhail Zoshchenko]]'s satires (as ''Izbrannoe'').&lt;ref name="mlsrussi"/&gt; In parallel, he arranged for print the diaries of [[Leonid Andreyev]]. That project was put on hold by son [[Vadim Andreyev]], for fear that disclosing his father's opinions on Bolshevism would make the ban on his work permanent.&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Leving, Frederick H. White, ''Marketing Literature and Posthumous Legacies. The Symbolic Capital of Leonid Andreev and Vladimir Nabokov'', pp. 44–47, 96, 97. Lanham &amp; Plymouth: [[Lexington Books]], 2013.  {{ISBN|978-0-7391-8260-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years===
According to Aucouturier, Slonim stands out as "one of the first independent critics of the USSR's literary output [and] a pioneer of Soviet literary historiography in the Occident."&lt;ref name="Aucouturier 1999, p. 389"/&gt; Italian writer [[Italo Calvino]], who visited Sarah Lawrence College in 1959, called Slonim "the most famous expert on Russian literature in America".&lt;ref&gt;[[Italo Calvino]], ''Hermit in Paris: Autobiographical Writings'', p. 41. New York City: [[Mariner Books]], 2014. {{ISBN|978-0-544-14669-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philologist Melissa Frazier sees him as an "incredibly significant figure in the phenomenon of Russian émigré culture". She notes: "Slonim did a lot more in the way of plot summary—but in the polarized world of the Cold War, even plot summary was hugely important. [...] He was one of the few in the West actually reading what was being written in the Soviet Union with the recognition that there were still great writers who had stayed behind."&lt;ref name="krfreedom"/&gt;

Slonim retired from Sarah Lawrence in 1962, and from teaching in 1965, living the rest of his life in Switzerland, where he was animator of a Russian literary club.&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier &amp; Slonim (1977), p. 411; Aucouturier (1999), p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963–1964, from his new home in [[Geneva]], Slonim worked on an English version of [[Andrei Bely]]'s ''Silver Dove'', and corresponded over literary details with Maria Olsufyeva, who had finished translating that same novel into Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Stefania Pavan, ''Le carte di Marija Olsuf'eva nell'Archivio contemporaneo Gabinetto G. P. Vieusseux'', pp. 13–15. Rome: Edizioni di storia e letteratura, 2002.  {{ISBN|88-8498-025-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slonim's last standalone book was the 1964 textbook ''Soviet Russian Literature. Writers and Problems'', praised by ''Revue des Études Slaves'' for its "sense of balance", but criticized for its "allusive nature".&lt;ref&gt;José Johannet, "Chronique: Publications. Russe", in ''Revue des Études Slaves'', Vol. 45, Parts 1–4, 1966, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; Social historian Lawrence H. Schwartz notes its "vitriolic" critique of the [[Union of Soviet Writers]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Slonim also contributed regularly to reviews and encyclopedias, answering queries posed by his younger colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier &amp; Slonim (1977), pp. 411–412&lt;/ref&gt; and supporting the Sarah Lawrence graduate program in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="krfreedom"/&gt; Some of his final articles defended a fellow critic, [[Andrei Sinyavsky]], who had angered the Soviet establishment with his reading of [[Alexander Pushkin]].&lt;ref name="Aucouturier p. 411"/&gt; In late 1968, he staged a letter writing campaign in support of the Soviet writer-dissident [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]].&lt;ref&gt;Sosin, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; His historical essay on ''Volya Rossii'' was published in 1972, as part of Nikolai Poltoratsky's review of Russian literature in exile.&lt;ref&gt;Karlinsky, p. 265; Renna, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; He also arranged for print [[Sofiya Pregel]]'s ''Last Poems'' (1973).&lt;ref&gt;Shrayer, p. 479&lt;/ref&gt;

Slonim died in 1976 in the French resort of [[Beaulieu-sur-Mer]].&lt;ref name="mlsrussi"/&gt; His incomplete memoirs, covering the period up to October 1917, were handed by his widow, Tatiana, to Aucouturier, who published them in ''Cahiers du Monde Russe et Soviétique''.&lt;ref&gt;Aucouturier &amp; Slonim (1977), p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; Tatiana Slonim continued to live in Geneva. In 1986, she donated her husband's 16th-century copy of the ''[[Theotokos of Vladimir]]'' to the city's [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire (Geneva)|Art and History Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Marielle Martiniani-Reber, [http://blog.mahgeneve.ch/la-vierge-de-vladimir-du-musee-dart-et-dhistoire/ ''La Vierge de Vladimir du Musée d'art et d'histoire''], [http://blog.mahgeneve.ch/ MAH blog], August 15, 2013; retrieved October 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Norman Robert Campbell''' (1880&amp;ndash;1949) was an English [[physics|physicist]] and [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]]. 

==Early life==
Norman Robert Campbell was born in 1880. He was the son of [[William Middleton Campbell]], [[Governor of the Bank of England]]. He was educated at [[Eton College]] and at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].

==Career==
Campbell became a fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=CMBL899NR|name=Campbell, Norman Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a research assistant at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] under the direction of [[J.  J. Thomson]]. He became an honorary fellow in physics research at [[Leeds University]] in 1913, then worked from 1919 to 1944 as a member of the research staff at [[General Electric]] in London.

Campbell's 1921 book, ''What Is Science?'', was written with the professed aim of encouraging the study of science in the classes of the [[Workers' Educational Association]].  This book is a short introduction to the philosophy of science aimed at a lay audience.  Other than attempting to answer the question raised in the title of the book, it tries to answer some of the central questions of the philosophy of science, such as "what is a law of nature?" and "what is measurement".

Campbell had a particular regard for the ideas and teaching ability of [[Michael Faraday]].

Other publications by Campbell include ''Modern Electrical Theory'' (1907 with supplementary chapters 1921-23), ''The Principles of Electricity'' (1912) and ''An Account of the Principles of Measurement and Calculation'' (1928). His most important work on the philosophy of science was his ''Foundations of Science: The Philosophy of Theory and Experiment'', first published as ''Physics: The Elements'' in 1919 with a second edition appearing posthumously in 1957. In this book Campbell developed his thesis that a critical analysis of science might not require any philosophy at all, but that an investigation of the meaning of [[reality]] and [[truth]] in science as opposed to [[metaphysics]] might be fruitful. Campbell believed that what might be considered "truth" in the realm of science might not be applicable at all in other fields.

Campbell considered that the fundamental function of a scientific [[theory]] was to develop and explain laws, defined as uniformities discovered by [[hypothesis]], [[observation]] and experiment and verifiable from [[experience]]. He also maintained that, to be useful, such laws should display some analogy to other known laws developed by the [[scientific method]].

==Death==
Campbell died in 1949.

'''Online dating''' (or '''Internet dating''') is a system that enables people to find and introduce themselves to new personal connections over the [[Internet]], usually with the goal of developing personal, romantic, or sexual relationships. An '''online dating service''' is a company that provides specific mechanisms (generally websites or applications) for online dating through the use of Internet-connected [[personal computer]]s or mobile devices. Such companies offer a wide variety of [[Moderation system|unmoderated]] [[matchmaking]] services, most of which are profile-based.

Online dating services allow users to become "members" by creating a profile and uploading personal information including (but not limited to) age, gender, sexual orientation, location, and appearance. Most services also encourage members to add photos or videos to their profile. Once a profile has been created, members can view the profiles of other members of the service, using the visible profile information to decide whether or not to initiate contact. Most services offer digital messaging, while others provide additional services such as [[webcast]]s, [[online chat]], telephone chat ([[Voice over Internet Protocol|VOIP]]), and [[message boards]]. Members can constrain their interactions to the online space, or they can arrange a [[dating|date]] to meet in person.

A great diversity of online dating services currently exists. Some have a broad membership base of diverse users looking for many different types of relationships. Other sites target highly specific demographics based on features like shared interests, location, religion, or relationship type. Online dating services also differ widely in their revenue streams. Some sites are completely free and depend on advertising for revenue. Others utilize the [[freemium]] revenue model, offering free registration and use, with optional, paid, premium services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/12/13/badoo-unveils-features-to-help-shy-users-flirt/|title=Badoo Unveils Features to Help Shy Users Flirt|date=2011-12-13|publisher=Mashable.com|author=Brian Anthony Hernandez 7|accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others rely solely on paid membership subscriptions.

Opinions and usage of online dating services also differ widely. A 2005 study of data collected by the [[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] found that individuals are more likely to use an online dating service if they use the Internet for a greater number of tasks, and less likely to use such a service if they are trusting of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kang|first=Tanya|year=2011|title=Why Would You Decide to Use an Online Dating Site? Factors That Lead to Online Dating|journal=[[Communication Research Reports]]|volume=28|issue=3|page=205|doi=10.1080/08824096.2011.566109|author2=Lindsay H. Hoffman}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the mode of online dating resonates with some participants' conceptual orientation towards the process of finding a romantic partner. That is, online dating sites use the conceptual framework of a "marketplace metaphor" to help people find potential matches, with layouts and functionalities that make it easy to quickly browse and select profiles in a manner similar to how one might browse an online store. Under this metaphor, members of a given service can both "shop" for potential relationship partners and "sell" themselves in hopes of finding a successful match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heino|first=R.|author2=N. Ellison |author3=J. Gibbs |title=Relationshopping: Investigating the market metaphor in online dating.|journal=[[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]]|volume=27|issue=4|year=2010|pages=427–447 |doi=10.1177/0265407510361614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trends ==
=== Social trends ===
[[File:Smartphone dating app illustration.jpg|thumb|Since the 2010s, Internet dating has become more popular with smartphones.]]
At the end of November 2004, there were 844 lifestyle and dating sites, a 38% increase since the start of the year, according to Hitwise Inc. The stigma associated with online dating dropped over the years and people view online dating more positively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/29/5-facts-about-online-dating/|title=5 facts about online dating|date=2016-02-29|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2017-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 [[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] on Online Dating noted an increase in usage of online dating sites by Americans to pursue their romantic interests.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2006/03/05/online-dating/|title=Online Dating|last=Madden|first=Mary|last2=Am|date=2006-03-05|website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2017-04-01|last3=Lenhart|first3=a}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one in ten respondents reported visiting these online dating websites.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2005–2012, about 34.95% of Americans reported meeting their spouses online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modern Romance|publisher = Penguin Press|date = 2015-06-16|isbn = 978-1-59420-627-6|first = Aziz|last = Ansari|first2 = Eric|last2 = Klinenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 Pew Research Center's survey reveals that the usage of online dating sites by American adults increased from 9% in 2013, to 12% in 2015. Further, during this period, the usage among 18- to 24-year-olds tripled, while that among 55- to 65-year-olds doubled.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/02/11/15-percent-of-american-adults-have-used-online-dating-sites-or-mobile-dating-apps/|title=15% of American Adults Have Used Online Dating Sites or Mobile Dating Apps|last=Smith|first=Aaron|date=2016-02-11|website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online daters may have more liberal social attitudes compared to the general population in the United States.&lt;ref name=twsDecH19h&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= 2010-12-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2015 study by the [[Pew Research Center]], 80% of the users, and 55% of non-users, said that online dating sites are a good way to meet potential partners.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, respondents felt that online dating is easier, more efficient than other methods, and gives access to a larger pool of potential partners.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Increased dating and marriage outside traditional social circles may be a contributing factor to coincident societal changes, including rising rates of interracial marriage.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Ortega|first=Josue|last2=Hergovich|first2=Philipp|date=2017|title=The Strength of Absent Ties: Social Integration via Online Dating|eprint=1709.10478|class=physics.soc-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, about 45% respondents felt that online dating is more dangerous compared to other methods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Views on online dating were similar across genders, with women expressing more concerns about safety than men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Niche dating sites ====
Sites with specific demographics have become popular as a way to narrow the pool of potential matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/04/14/finding.love.online/|title=Finding love online, despite health problems – CNN.com|date=2010-04-14|work=CNN|accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful niche sites pair people by race, sexual orientation or religion.&lt;ref name="newyorktimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/27/fashion/27niche.html?_r=1&amp;ref=fashion&amp;oref=slogin|title=Let's Say You Want to Date a Hog Farmer|last=Sullivan|first=J. Courtney|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2006-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, the top 5 overall sites held 7% less market share than they did one year ago while the top sites from the top five major niche dating categories made considerable gains.&lt;ref name="techcrunch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/04/24/niche-dating-sites-grow-steadily-as-mainstream-ones-flail/|title=Niche Dating Sites Grow Steadily As Mainstream Ones Flail|publisher=Tech Crunch|accessdate=2006-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niche sites cater to people with special interests, such as sports fans, racing and automotive fans, medical or other professionals, people with political or religious preferences (e.g., Hindu, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, etc.), people with medical conditions (e.g., HIV+, obese), or those living in rural farm communities.

==== Online introduction services ====
In 2008, a variation of the online dating model emerged in the form of introduction sites, where members have to search and contact other members, who introduce them to other members whom they deem compatible. Introduction sites differ from the traditional online dating model, and attracted a large number of users and significant investor interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2008/06/12/speed-dating-site-woome-raises-125m-more-on-41m-valuation/|title=Speed-dating site WooMe raises $12.5M more, enjoys $41M valuation|date=2008-06-12|publisher=VentureBeat|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic trends ===
Since 2003, several free dating sites, operating on ad based-revenue rather than monthly subscriptions, have appeared and become increasingly popular.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Other partially free online dating services offer only limited privileges for free members, or only for a brief period.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Although some sites offer free trials and/or profiles, most memberships can cost upwards of $60 per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realsimple.com/work-life/money/cost-comparison-internet-dating-sites-00000000028239/index.html|title=Cost Comparison: Internet Dating Sites|publisher=realsimple.com|accessdate=2013-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, online dating services in the United States generated $957 million in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.computerworld.com/online_dating_its_bigger_than_porn|title=Online dating: It's bigger than porn – Computerworld Blogs|date=2009-02-13|publisher=Computer World|accessdate=2014-01-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193659/http://blogs.computerworld.com/online_dating_its_bigger_than_porn|archivedate=2014-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Eastern Europe, popular sites offer full access to messaging and profiles, but provide additional services for pay, such as prioritizing profile position, removing advertisements, and giving paying users access to a more advanced search engine. Such sites earn revenue from a mix of advertising and sale of additional options. This model also allows users to switch between free and paying status at will, with sites accepting a variety of online currencies and payment options.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Most free dating websites depend on [[advertising]] revenue, using tools such as [[Google AdSense]] and [[affiliate marketing]]. Since advertising revenues are modest compared to membership fees, this model requires a large number of [[page view]]s to achieve profitability. However, [[Sam Yagan]] describes dating sites as ideal advertising platforms because of the wealth of demographic data made available by users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time100.time.com/2013/04/18/time-100/slide/sam-yagan/|title=Sam Yagan &amp;#124; TIME 100: The 100 Most Influential People in the World &amp;#124; TIME.com|last=Levitt|first=Steven|date=2013-04-18|publisher=Time100.time.com|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
=== Trust and safety ===
There are mixed opinions regarding the safety of online dating. Over 50% of research participants in a 2011 study did not view online dating as a dangerous activity, whereas 43% thought that online dating involved risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Couch | first1 = Danielle | last2 = Liamputtong | first2 = Pranee | last3 = Pitts | first3 = Marian | year = 2011 | title = Online Daters and the Use of Technology for Surveillance and Risk Management | url = | journal = International Journal of Emerging Technologies &amp; Society | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 116–134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because online dating takes place in virtual space, it is possible for profile information to be misrepresented or falsified. While some sites conduct [[background check]]s on members, many do not, resulting in some uncertainty around members' identities. For instance, some profiles may not represent real humans but rather "bait profiles" placed online by site owners to attract new paying members, or "spam profiles" created by advertisers to market services and products.

Profiles created by real humans also have the potential to be problematic. For example, online dating sites may expose more female members in particular to [[stalking]], [[fraud]], and [[sexual violence]] by [[online predator]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} A less malicious form of misrepresentation is that members may lie about their height, weight, age, or marital status in an attempt to market or brand themselves in a particular way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140316230919-1288829-when-personal-branding-get-too-personal|title=When personal branding get too personal! Online dating and your brand.|date=March 16, 2014|publisher=Linkedin|last1=Jones|first1=Cher}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users may also carefully manipulate profiles as a form of [[impression management]].&lt;ref name="Couch 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Couch|first=Danielle|year=2008|title=Online Dating and Mating: The Use of the Internet to Meet Sexual Partners|journal=Qualitative Health Research|author2=Pranee Liamputtong}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online dating site members may try to balance an accurate representation with maintaining their image in a desirable way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellison|first=Nicole|year=2006|title=Managing impressions online: Self-presentation processes in the online dating environment|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|volume=11|issue=2|pages=415–441|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00020.x|author2=Rebecca Heino|author3=Jennifer Gibbs}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that nine out of ten participants had lied on at least one attribute, though lies were often slight; weight was the most lied about attribute, and age was the least lied about.&lt;ref name="Hancock 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hancock|first=Jeffrey|year=2007|title=The truth about lying in online dating profiles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, knowing a large amount of superficial information about a potential partner's interests may lead to a false sense of security when meeting up with a new person.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/fashion/the-end-of-courtship.html?pagewanted=all|title=The End of Courtship|last=Williams|first=Alex|date=2013-01-11|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gross misrepresentation may be less likely on [[matrimonial website|matrimonials sites]] than on casual dating sites.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some dating services have been created specifically for those living with HIV and other STIs in an effort to eliminate the need to lie about one's health in order to find a partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=An ethics of intimacy: Online dating, viral-sociality and living with HIV|url=http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/16366431/2012_Mazanderani_Ethics_of_intimacy_author_final.pdf|journal=BioSocieties|volume=7|issue=4|pages=393–409|doi=10.1057/biosoc.2012.24|author=Mazanderani, F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage of crimes related to online dating may also contribute to perceptions of its risks.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} However, online dating may also have advantages over conventional (offline) dating in that it offers unprecedented access to potential partners for singles who otherwise would not have such access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://psi.sagepub.com/content/13/1/3.full?ijkey=cK9EB6/4zQ0AM&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sppsi|title=Online Dating : A Critical Analysis From the Perspective of Psychological Science|journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest|volume=13|issue=1|pages=3–66|last=Finkel et. al.|first=Eli.J.|access-date=|doi=10.1177/1529100612436522|pmid=26173279|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of dating sites that promote adultery, such as [[Ashley Madison]], has stirred some controversy. Marriage breakups happened in about 6% of online couples, compared to 7.6% of offline ones.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Mean marital satisfaction scores were 5.64 and 5.48 for the online and offline couples, respectively.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}{{Original research inline|date=July 2017}}

=== Billing ===

Online subscription-based services can suffer from complaints about billing practices. Some online dating service providers may have fraudulent membership fees or credit card charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2013/mar/21/bad-romance-online-dating-complaints-made-ftc/|title=Bad romance: Online dating complaints made to the FTC|website=MuckRock|accessdate=2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sites do not allow members to preview available profiles before paying a subscription fee. Furthermore, different functionalities may be offered to members who have paid or not paid for subscriptions, resulting in some confusion around who can view or contact whom.

Consolidation within the online dating industry has led to different newspapers and magazines now advertising the same website [[database]] under different names. In the UK, for example, [[Time Out (company)|''Time Out'']] ("London Dating"), ''[[The Times]]'' ("Encounters"), and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' ("Kindred Spirits"), all offer differently named portals to the same service—meaning that a person who subscribes through more than one publication has unwittingly paid more than once for access to the same service.

=== Imbalanced gender ratios ===

On any given dating site, the [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] is commonly unbalanced. A website may have two women for every man, but they may be in the 35+ range, while the men are generally under 35.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Little is known about the sex ratio controlled for age. [[eHarmony]]'s membership is about 57% female and 43% male,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Compare Online Dating Site reviews and prices at NextAdvisor.com|url = http://www.nextadvisor.com/online_dating/compare.php|website = www.nextadvisor.com|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the ratio at [[Match.com]] is about the reverse of that. When one gets into the specialty niche websites where the primary demographic is male, one typically gets a very unbalanced ratio of male to female or female to male.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brandchannel.com/careers_profile.asp?cr_id=53 Brandchannel.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012200213/http://brandchannel.com/careers_profile.asp?cr_id=53 |date=2007-10-12 }}. Retrieved 21 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have suggested that men are far more likely to send messages on dating sites than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cupid on Trial: An OKCupid Online Dating Experiment|url = http://jonmillward.com/blog/attraction-dating/cupid-on-trial-a-4-month-online-dating-experiment/|website = Jon Millward|accessdate = 2015-12-14|language = en-US|date = 2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, men tend to message the most attractive women regardless of their own attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title="Where Have All the Good Men Gone?" Gendered Interactions in Online Dating|journal = Journal of Marriage and the Family|date = 2014-04-01|issn = 0022-2445|pmc = 4043335|pmid = 24910472|pages = 387–410|volume = 76|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/jomf.12072|first = Derek A.|last = Kreager|first2 = Shannon E.|last2 = Cavanagh|first3 = John|last3 = Yen|first4 = Mo|last4 = Yu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the most attractive women on these sites receiving an overwhelming number of messages, which can in some cases result in them leaving the site.

There is some evidence that there may be differences in how women online rate male attractiveness as opposed to how men rate female attractiveness. The distribution of ratings given by men of female attractiveness appears to be the [[normal distribution]], while ratings of men given by women is highly skewed, with 80% of men rated as below average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/2009/11/17/your-looks-and-online-dating/|title=Your Looks and Your Inbox|author=Christian Rudder|work=OkTrends}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that women are genuinely more picky than men when it comes to appearance on online dating websites.

=== Discrimination ===
[[Gay rights]] groups have complained that certain websites that restrict their dating services to heterosexual couples are discriminating against [[homosexuals]]. Homosexual customers of the popular [[eHarmony]] dating website have made many attempts to litigate discriminatory practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buss|first=Dale|title=Discordant Voices Among eHarmony.com's Customers|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB122782471897362521|accessdate=31 October 2013|newspaper=Wall Street Journal – Eastern Edition|date=28 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; eHarmony was sued in 2007 by a [[lesbian]] claiming that "[s]uch outright discrimination is hurtful and disappointing for a business open to the public in this day and age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2007-06-01-eharmony-suit-discrimination_N.htm|title=Woman sues eHarmony for discrimination – USATODAY.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of discrimination by sexual orientation by dating websites, some services such as [[Gaydar (website)|GayDar.net]] and [[Chemistry.com]] cater more to homosexual dating.

Less than half of Internet daters are open to dating people of all races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yancey|first=George|title=Cross racial differences in the racial preference of potential dating partners|journal=[[The Sociological Quarterly]]|volume=50|year=2009|pages=121–143|doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.2008.01135.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the [[Social exchange theory#Applications|social exchange]] and [[social position|group position]] theories, Asians, Latinos and blacks are more open to dating whites than whites are to dating them. Of those who state a racial preference, 97% of white men exclude black women, 48% exclude Latinas, and 53% exclude Asian women. In contrast, white men are excluded by 76% of black women, 33% Latinas, and only 11% Asian women. Similarly, 92% of white women exclude black men, 77% exclude Latinos, and 93% exclude Asian men. 71% of black men, 31% of Latinos, and 36% of Asian men excluded white women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robnett|first=Belinda|last2=Feliciano|first2=Cynthia|date=2011-05-04|title=Patterns of Racial-Ethnic Exclusion by Internet Daters|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/430702|journal=Social Forces|volume=89|issue=3|pages=807–828|doi=10.1353/sof.2011.0008|issn=1534-7605}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Cynthia|last1=Feliciano|first2=Belinda |last2=Robnett|first3=Golnaz|last3=Komaie|year=2009|title=Gendered Racial Exclusion Among White Internet Daters|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26333132|journal=Social Science Research|volume=38|issue=1|pages=39–54|via=|doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2008.09.004|pmid=19569291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a former employee sued adultery website [[Ashley Madison]] claiming repetitive strain injuries as creating 1000 fake profiles in one three week span "required an enormous amount of keyboarding" which caused the worker to develop severe pain in her wrists and forearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ashley-madison-adultery-website-sued-by-former-employee-1.2421819|title=Ashley Madison adultery website sued by former employee|date=10 November 2013|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; AshleyMadison's parent company, [[Avid Life Media]], [[countersue]]d in 2014, alleging the worker kept confidential documents, including copies of her "work product and training materials." The firm claimed the fake profiles were for "quality assurance testing" to test a new Brazilian version of the site for "consistency and reliability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ashley-madison-adultery-website-countersues-ex-employee-1.2583359|title=Ashley Madison adultery website countersues ex-employee|date=23 March 2014|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, an already-married [[Facebook]] user attempting to close a pop-up advertisement for Zoosk.com found that one click instead copied personal info from her Facebook profile to create an unwanted online profile seeking a mate, leading to a flood of unexpected responses from amorous single males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/facebook-info-sharing-created-zoosk-com-dating-profile-for-married-woman-1.2844953|title=Facebook info sharing created Zoosk.com dating profile for married woman|date=24 November 2014|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]]|first=Rosa|last=Marchitelli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[It's Just Lunch International]] was the target of a New York class action alleging [[unjust enrichment]] as IJL staff relied on a uniform, misleading script which informed prospective customers during initial interviews that IJL already had at least two matches in mind for those customers' first dates regardless of whether or not that was true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/14/us-itsjustlunch-lawsuit-idUSBREA4D0RF20140514|title=It's Just Lunch to face U.S. class-action lawsuit over matchmaking claims|work=Reuters | date=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the US [[Federal Trade Commission]] fined UK-based [[JDI Dating]] (a group of 18 websites, including Cupidswand.com and FlirtCrowd.com)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/dating-site-fined-for-posting-fake-profiles/|title=Dating site fined for posting fake profiles|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; over [[US dollar|US$]]600000, finding that "the defendants offered a free plan that allowed users to set up a profile with personal information and photos. As soon as a new user set up a free profile, he or she began to receive messages that appeared to be from other members living nearby, expressing romantic interest or a desire to meet. However, users were unable to respond to these messages without upgrading to a paid membership ...

In 2017 Darlene Daggett, QVC's president for U.S. commerce from 2002 to 2007, filed a lawsuit against matchmaking agency Kelleher International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Collman|first1=Ashley|title=Former QVC executive, 62, sues reality show matchmaker|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4774926/Retired-executive-sues-matchmaking-company-paid-150k.html|accessdate=18 September 2017|publisher=Daily Mail|date=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company, owned by Amber Kelleher-Andrews
agreed to settle within hours of Daggett filing the lawsuit. Neither talked about the case, citing a non-disclosure agreement, but Daggett's lawsuit gives plenty of detail about her grievances with the California-based company. 'Due to her senior level position in a local firm, [she] felt that social dating sites did not provide her with the degree of screening and privacy she was looking for,' the lawsuit states. She opted in for the company's most expensive plan, the $150,000 CEO level, which guaranteed her matches from around the world and the personal attention of Kelleher-Andrews. 
But Daggett says she did not get what she paid for. Instead, she suffered brief romantic entanglements with increasingly disastrous men.

== Government regulation ==
U.S. government regulation of dating services began with the [[International Marriage Broker Regulation Act]] (IMBRA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/Static_Files_Memoranda/Archives%201998-2008/2006/imbra072106.pdf |title=International Marriage Broker Regulation Act Implementation Guidance – HQOPRD 70/6.2.11 |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] |date=July 21, 2006 |author=Aytes, Michael |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which took effect in March 2007 after a federal judge in Georgia upheld a challenge from the dating site European Connections. The law requires dating services meeting specific criteria—including having as their primary business to connect U.S. citizens/residents with foreign nationals—to conduct, among other procedures, sex offender checks on U.S. customers before contact details can be provided to the non-U.S. citizen. In 2008, the state of New Jersey passed a law which requires the sites to disclose whether they perform background checks.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23117392/|title=Background checks split online dating industry – Technology &amp; science – Security – msnbc.com|date=2008-02-12|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[People's Republic of China]], using a transnational matchmaking agency involving a monetary transaction is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=马玉佳 |url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/2011-08/30/content_23312519.htm |title=Transnational matchmaking illegal in China |publisher=China.org.cn |date=2011-08-30 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philippines]] prohibits the business of organizing or facilitating marriages between Filipinas and foreign men under the [[Philippine Republic Act 6955|Republic Act 6955]] (the Anti-Mail-Order Bride Law) of June 13, 1990; this law is routinely circumvented by basing [[mail-order bride]] websites outside the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KzhEUE35pRcC&amp;pg=PA103 |title=Trafficking And the Global Sex Industry |publisher= |accessdate=2013-04-16|isbn=9780739113134 |author1=Beeks |first1=Karen |last2=Amir |first2=Delila |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=muPfQjYP-0IC&amp;pg=PA55 |title=Romance on a Global Stage: Pen Pals, Virtual Ethnography, and "Mail-Order Brides" |author=Nicole Constable |publisher= |date=2003-08-19 |accessdate=2013-04-16|isbn=9780520937222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mae Ryan |title=Imported Filipino brides share the ups and downs of settling in America |url=http://www.scpr.org/programs/offramp/2012/09/26/28576/imported-filipino-brides-settle-into-love-in-south/ |newspaper=SCPR |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=9 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore's [[Social Development Network]] is the governmental organization facilitating dating activities in the country. Singapore's government has actively acted as a matchmaker for singles for the past few decades, and thus only 4% of Singaporeans have ever used an online dating service, despite the country's high rate of internet penetration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In December 2010, a [[New York State]] Law called the "Internet Dating Safety Act" (S5180-A) went into effect that requires online dating sites with customers in New York State to warn users not to disclose personal information to people they do not know.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetdatingconference.com/new-york-senate-bill-S5180a-internet-dating-safety-act.php|title=S5180-A|publisher=Internetdatingconference.com|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date= February 2011}}

'''Philosophical presentism''' is the view that neither the future nor the past exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time/#PreEteGroUniThe Presentism, Eternalism, and The Growing Universe Theory].&lt;/ref&gt; In some versions of presentism, this view is extended to timeless objects or ideas (such as numbers). According to presentism, events and entities that are wholly past or wholly future do not exist at all. Presentism contrasts with [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] and the [[Growing block universe|growing block theory of time]] which hold that past events, like the [[Battle of Waterloo]], and past entities, like [[Alexander the Great]]'s warhorse [[Bucephalus]], really do exist, although not in the present. Eternalism extends to future events as well.

==Overview==
[[Augustine of Hippo]] proposed that the present is analogous to a knife edge placed exactly between the perceived past and the imaginary future and does not include the concept of time. This should be self-[[evidence|evident]] because, if the present is extended, it must have separate parts – but these must be [[simultaneity|simultaneous]] if they are truly a part of the present. According to early philosophers, time cannot be simultaneously past and present and hence not extended. Contrary to Saint Augustine, some philosophers propose that conscious experience is extended in time. For instance, [[William James]] said that time is "the short duration of which we are immediately and incessantly sensible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = James | first = William | title = The Principles of Psychology | publisher = Henry Holt and Company | volume = 1 | date = 1890 | location = New York | pages = 631 | url = https://archive.org/stream/principlesofpsyc001jame#page/631 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other early presentist philosophers include the [[Indian Buddhism|Indian Buddhist]] tradition. [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy]], a leading scholar of the modern era on [[Buddhist philosophy]], has written extensively on Buddhist presentism: "Everything past is unreal, everything future is unreal, everything imagined, absent, mental... is unreal. Ultimately, real is only the present moment of physical [[wikt:efficiency|efficiency]] [i.e., [[Causality|causation]]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | volume = 1 | title = Buddhist Logic | year = 1962 | publisher = Dover | place = New York | pages = 70–1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[J. M. E. McTaggart]]'s "[[The Unreality of Time]]", there are two ways of referring to events: the [[B-Theory of time|'A Series']] (or 'tensed time': [[wiktionary:yesterday|yesterday]], [[wiktionary:today|today]], [[wiktionary:tomorrow|tomorrow]]) and the [[B-Theory of time|'B Series']] (or 'untensed time': Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday). Presentism posits that the A Series is fundamental and that the B Series alone is not sufficient. Presentists maintain that temporal discourse requires the use of tenses, whereas the "Old B-Theorists" argued that tensed language could be reduced to tenseless facts (Dyke, 2004).

[[Arthur N. Prior]] has argued against un-tensed theories with the following ideas: the meaning of statements such as "Thank goodness that's over" is much easier to see in a tensed theory with a distinguished, present ''now''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Prior |first= Arthur| title= Thank goodness that's over| journal= Philosophy|date=January 1959 | volume = 34 | issue= 128| pages= 12–17 | doi=10.1017/s0031819100029685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar arguments can be made to support the theory of [[egocentric presentism]] (or [[perspectival realism]]), which holds that there is a distinguished, present ''self''.

In modern [[theory of relativity]], the conceptual [[observation|observer]] is at a [[Point (geometry)|geometric point]] in both space and time at the apex of the '[[light cone]]' which observes the events laid out in time as well as space. Different observers may disagree on whether two events at different locations occurred simultaneously depending on whether the observers are in relative motion (see [[relativity of simultaneity]]). This theory depends upon the idea of time as an extended thing and has been confirmed by experiment, thus giving rise to a philosophical viewpoint known as [[four dimensionalism]]. Although the contents of an observation are time-extended, the conceptual observer, being a geometric point at the origin of the light cone, is not extended in time or space. This analysis contains a [[paradox]] in which the conceptual observer contains nothing, even though any real observer would need to be the extended contents of an observation to exist. This paradox is partially resolved in relativity theory by defining a '[[frame of reference]]' to encompass the measuring instruments used by an observer. This reduces the time separation between instruments to a set of constant intervals.{{Sfn | Petkov | 2005}}

Some of the difficulties and paradoxes of presentism can be resolved by changing the normal view of time as a container or thing unto itself and seeing time as a measure of changing spatial relationships among objects. Thus, observers need not be extended in time to exist and to be aware, but they rather exist and the changes in internal relationships within the observer can be measured by stable countable events.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6303">The term '''physics envy''' is a phrase used to criticize modern writing and research of academics working in areas such as "[[soft sciences|softer sciences]]", [[liberal art]]s, business studies and humanities.&lt;ref name="Overcoming ‘Physics Envy’"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Kevin|last2=Primo|first2=David|title=Overcoming ‘Physics Envy’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/opinion/sunday/the-social-sciences-physics-envy.html|website=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sokal"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sokal|first1=Alan|title=Physics envy in psychology: A cautionary tale|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/CCNY_lecture_Nov_19_15.pdf|publisher=[[New York University]]|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="How Business Schools Lost Their Way"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bennis|first1=Warren|last2=O'Toole|first2=James|title=How Business Schools Lost Their Way|url=https://hbr.org/2005/05/how-business-schools-lost-their-way|website=[[Harvard Business Review]]|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term argues that writing and working practices in these disciplines have overused confusing [[jargon]] and complicated mathematics, in order to seem more 'rigorous' and like mathematics-based subjects like physics.&lt;ref name="Dunbar2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin Dunbar|title=The Trouble with Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5HbvQsET6zIC&amp;pg=PA214|date=7 April 2011|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=978-0-571-26519-0|pages=214–231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Academic B.S. as artificial barriers to entry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Noah|title=Academic B.S. as artificial barriers to entry|url=http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/academic-bs-as-artificial-barriers-to.html|website=Economics, neologisms, and distraction|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The success of physics in "mathematicizing" itself, particularly since [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica (Newton)|Principia Mathematica]]'', is generally considered remarkable and often disproportionate compared to other areas of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Eugene Wigner]] remarked "The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve.", while [[Richard Feynman]] said "To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature ... If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in."&lt;/ref&gt; "Physics envy" refers to the envy (perceived or real) of scholars in other disciplines for the mathematical precision of fundamental concepts obtained by physicists. It is an accusation raised against disciplines (typically against [[social sciences]] and [[liberal art]]s such as [[literature]], [[philosophy]], and [[psychology]]) when these academic areas try to express their fundamental concepts in terms of mathematics, which is seen as an unwarranted push for [[reductionism]].

[[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologist]] [[Ernst Mayr]] discusses the issue of the inability to reduce biology to its mathematical basis in his book ''What Makes Biology Unique?''.&lt;ref name="Mayr2004"&gt;Mayr (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]] discusses the ability and desirability of reduction to its mathematical basis in his article "Mysteries of Nature: How Deeply Hidden."&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky contributed extensively to the development of the field of [[theoretical linguistics]], a [[formal science]].

'''Red Wheel Weiser Conari''', also known in different periods in its history as '''RedWheel/Weiser, LLC''' and '''Samuel Weiser, Inc.''', is a book [[publisher]] with three [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s: Red Wheel, Weiser Books and Conari Books. It is America's second-largest{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} [[publisher]] of [[occult]] and [[New Age]] books, behind [[Llewellyn Worldwide]], and is also one of the oldest American publishers to concentrate exclusively on that [[genre]]. It publishes on average 60-75 new titles per year and maintains a large [[backlist]], partly of books that it originally published, and partly of older [[public domain]] rare occult books.

==Imprints==

===Weiser Books===
This main imprint is also the oldest. It was founded as ''Samuel Weiser, Inc.'' in 1956, a time when few other publishers were willing to tackle occult subjects, and was originally an offshoot of the New York City retailer, [[Weiser Antiquarian Books]]. This imprint publishes the backlist and continues to acquire books on occultism, [[astrology]], [[esoteric]] subjects, Eastern religions, [[Wicca]] and related topics.

===Red Wheel===
Red Wheel was founded in 2000 as an imprint for spiritually oriented or occult [[self-help]] and [[how-to]] books, and at that time the company name was changed from Samuel Weiser, Inc. to RedWheel/Weiser, with several other variations being commonly seen, including Weiser, Inc.

===Conari Books===
This imprint was acquired in 2002. Before this, Conari Books had been a separate publisher, based in [[Berkeley, California]], dating back to 1989. This imprint focuses on books that view [[sociology]] and [[parenting]] issues through a spiritual or New Age perspective.

===Turning Stone Press===
Turning Stone was founded in 2012. It is a self-publishing imprint in collaboration with [[Hampton Roads Publishing Company]] and Hierophant Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Red Wheel/Weiser Enters Self Publishing with Turning Stone Press| work = PublishersWeekly.com| accessdate = 2017-12-01| url = https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/50394-red-wheel-weiser-enters-self-publishing-with-turning-stone-press.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disinformation Books===
Disinformation Books was founded in 1997 as the publishing division of [[Disinformation (company)|Disinformation]]. It was acquired by Red Wheel/Weiser in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Red Wheel Weiser Buys Disinformation Books| work = PublishersWeekly.com| accessdate = 2017-12-01| url = https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/book-deals/article/52226-red-wheel-weiser-buys-disinformation-books.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career Press===
Career Press was founded in 1985 by Ron Fry and is focused on business books. Red Wheel/Weiser acquired Career Press in 2017.&lt;ref name="career"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Red Wheel Buys Career Press, Hires Peter Turner| work = PublishersWeekly.com| accessdate = 2017-12-01| url = https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/industry-deals/article/75235-red-wheel-buys-career-press-hires-peter-turner.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Page Books===
New Page Books was founded in 1999 as the general nonfiction imprint of Career Press.&lt;ref name="career"/&gt;

==Location==
The company has been previously located in [[Boston]] and in [[York Beach, Maine]] for most of its history. In 2006, the editorial department moved to [[San Francisco]] and the sales and marketing department moved to [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]].

==Biography==
===Early years===
Boyle was born at [[Lismore Castle]], in [[County Waterford]], Ireland, the seventh son and fourteenth child of [[Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork|The 1st Earl of Cork]] ('the Great Earl of Cork') and Catherine Fenton. Lord Cork, then known simply as Richard Boyle, had arrived in [[Dublin]] from England in 1588 during the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] [[plantations of Ireland]] and obtained an appointment as a deputy [[escheator]]. He had amassed enormous wealth and landholdings by the time Robert was born, and had been created [[Earl of Cork]] in October 1620. Catherine Fenton, [[Countess]] of [[County Cork|Cork]], was the daughter of [[Sir Geoffrey Fenton]], the former [[Secretary of State (Ireland)|Secretary of State for Ireland]], who was born in Dublin in 1539, and Alice Weston, the daughter of [[Robert Weston]], who was born in [[Lismore, County Waterford|Lismore]] in 1541.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Catherine Fenton|work=Family Ghosts|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/auden/cgi-bin/auden/individual.php?pid=I4234&amp;ged=auden-bicknell.ged |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Boyle was [[Fosterage|fostered]] to a local family,&lt;ref name=McCartneyWhitaker&gt;{{citation|title=Physicists of Ireland: Passion and Precision|first1=Mark|last1=McCartney|first2=Andrew|last2=Whitaker|publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing|year=2003|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; as were his elder brothers. Boyle received private tutoring in Latin, Greek, and French and when he was eight years old, following the death of his mother, he was sent to [[Eton College]] in England. His father's friend, [[Sir Henry Wotton]], was then the [[Provost (education)|provost]] of the college.

During this time, his father hired a private tutor, Robert Carew, who had knowledge of [[Irish language|Irish]], to act as private tutor to his sons in Eton. However, "only Mr. Robert sometimes desires it [Irish] and is a little entered in it", but despite the "many reasons" given by Carew to turn their attentions to it, "they practice the French and Latin but they affect not the Irish".&lt;ref name="canny"&gt;{{citation|first=Nicholas|last=Canny|title=The Upstart Earl: a study of the social and mental world of Richard Boyle|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge|year=1982|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending over three years at Eton, Robert travelled abroad with a French tutor. They visited Italy in 1641 and remained in [[Florence]] during the winter of that year studying the "paradoxes of the great star-gazer" [[Galileo Galilei]], who was elderly but still living in 1641.

===Middle years===
Robert returned to England from [[continental Europe]] in mid-1644 with a keen interest in scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;See biographies of Robert Boyle at [http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=522], {{cite web |url=http://www.woodrow.org/teachers/ci/1992/Boyle.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516022301/http://www.woodrow.org/teachers/ci/1992/Boyle.html |archivedate=16 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}, {{cite web |url=http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Boyle.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413025044/http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Boyle.html |archivedate=13 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }} and [https://books.google.com/books?id=fjDXtalPeesC&amp;pg=PT24].&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork|Lord Cork]], had died the previous year and had left him the manor of [[Stalbridge]] in Dorset as well as substantial estates in [[County Limerick]] in Ireland that he had acquired. Robert then made his residence at [[Stalbridge#Stalbridge House|Stalbridge House]], between 1644 and 1652, and conducted many experiments there. From that time, Robert devoted his life to [[science|scientific]] research and soon took a prominent place in the band of enquirers, known as the "[[Invisible College]]", who devoted themselves to the cultivation of the "new philosophy". They met frequently in London, often at [[Gresham College]], and some of the members also had meetings at [[Oxford]].
[[File:Young Robert Boyle on monument St. Patricks.jpg|thumb|left|Sculpture of a young boy, thought to be Boyle, on his parents' monument in [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]].]]
Having made several visits to his Irish estates beginning in 1647, Robert moved to Ireland in 1652 but became frustrated at his inability to make progress in his chemical work. In one letter, he described Ireland as "a barbarous country where chemical spirits were so misunderstood and chemical instruments so unprocurable that it was hard to have any Hermetic thoughts in it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silver|first1=Brian L.|title=The ascent of science|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-513427-8|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1654, Boyle left Ireland for Oxford to pursue his work more successfully. An inscription can be found on the wall of [[University College, Oxford]], the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]] at [[Oxford]] (now the location of the [[Shelley Memorial]]), marking the spot where Cross Hall stood until the early 19th century. It was here that Boyle rented rooms from the wealthy apothecary who owned the Hall.

Reading in 1657 of [[Otto von Guericke]]'s air pump, he set himself with the assistance of [[Robert Hooke]] to devise improvements in its construction, and with the result, the "machina Boyleana" or "Pneumatical Engine", finished in 1659, he began a series of experiments on the properties of air.&lt;ref name=acottLaw/&gt; An account of Boyle's work with the air pump was published in 1660 under the title ''New Experiments Physico-Mechanical, Touching the Spring of the Air, and its Effects''.

Among the critics of the views put forward in this book was a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]], [[Francis Line]] (1595–1675), and it was while answering his objections that Boyle made his first mention of [[Boyle's law|the law]] that the volume of a gas varies inversely to the pressure of the gas, which among English-speaking people is usually called Boyle's Law after his name. The person who originally formulated the hypothesis was [[Henry Power]] in 1661. Boyle in 1662 included a reference to a paper written by Power, but mistakenly attributed it to [[Richard Towneley]]. In continental Europe the hypothesis is sometimes attributed to [[Edme Mariotte]], although he did not publish it until 1676 and was likely aware of Boyle's work at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1663 the Invisible College became [[The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge]], and the charter of incorporation granted by [[Charles II of England]] named Boyle a member of the council. In 1680 he was elected president of the society, but declined the honour from a scruple about oaths.

He made a "wish list" of 24 possible inventions which included "the prolongation of life", the "art of flying", "perpetual light", "making armour light and extremely hard", "a ship to sail with all winds, and a ship not to be sunk", "practicable and certain way of finding longitudes", "potent drugs to alter or exalt imagination, waking, memory and other functions and appease pain, procure innocent sleep, harmless dreams, etc." They are extraordinary because all but a few of the 24 have come true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7798012/Robert-Boyles-prophetic-scientific-predictions-from-the-17th-century-go-on-display-at-the-Royal-Society.html|title=Robert Boyle's prophetic scientific predictions from the 17th century go on display at the Royal Society|date=3 June 2010|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Robert Boyle's Wish list|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7798201/Robert-Boyles-Wish-list.html|accessdate=11 October 2016|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during his time at Oxford that Boyle was a ''[[Cavalier|Chevalier]]''. The Chevaliers are thought to have been established by royal order a few years before Boyle's time at Oxford. The early part of Boyle's residence was marked by the actions of the victorious parliamentarian forces, consequently this period marked the most secretive period of Chevalier movements and thus little is known about Boyle's involvement beyond his membership.

In 1668 he left Oxford for London where he resided at the house of his elder sister [[Katherine Jones, Viscountess Ranelagh|Katherine Jones, Lady Ranelagh]], in [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]]. He experimented in the laboratory she had in her home and attended her salon of intellectuals interested in the sciences. The siblings maintained "a lifelong intellectual partnership, where brother and sister shared medical remedies, promoted each other’s scientific ideas, and edited each other’s manuscripts."&lt;ref name=chf&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pachs.net/events/archive/such_a_sister_became_such_a_brother_lady_ranelaghs_influence_on_robert_boyl/ |title= 'Such a Sister Became Such a Brother': Lady Ranelagh’s Influence on Robert Boyle |first= Michelle |last= DiMeo |date= 2014-02-04 |accessdate=2014-02-05 |publisher= Philadelphia Area Center for History of Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporaries widely acknowledged Katherine's influence on his work, but later historiographers dropped discussion of her accomplishments and relationship to her brother from the their histories.

===Later years===
[[File:boyle-hooke.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shelley Memorial#Boyle-Hooke plaque|Plaque]] at the site of Boyle and Hooke's experiments in Oxford]]
In 1669 his health, never very strong, began to fail seriously and he gradually withdrew from his public engagements, ceasing his communications to the Royal Society, and advertising his desire to be excused from receiving guests, "unless upon occasions very extraordinary", on Tuesday and Friday forenoon, and Wednesday and Saturday afternoon. In the leisure thus gained he wished to "recruit his spirits, range his papers", and prepare some important chemical investigations which he proposed to leave "as a kind of Hermetic legacy to the studious disciples of that art", but of which he did not make known the nature. His health became still worse in 1691, and he died on 31 December that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Michael|title=Robert Boyle Reconsidered|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521892674|pages=xvii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTq1Kr7fr6QC&amp;pg=PR17|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; just a week after the death of his sister, Katherine, in whose home he had lived and with whom he had shared scientific pursuits for more than twenty years. Boyle died from paralysis. He was buried in the churchyard of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], his funeral sermon being preached by his friend, Bishop [[Gilbert Burnet]]. In his will, Boyle endowed a series of lectures that came to be known as the [[Boyle Lectures]].

==Scientific investigator==
[[File:Boyle air pump.jpg|thumb|right|Boyle's air pump]]
Boyle's great merit as a scientific investigator is that he carried out the principles which [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]] espoused in the ''[[Novum Organum]]''. Yet he would not avow himself a follower of Bacon, or indeed of any other teacher. On several occasions he mentions that to keep his judgment as unprepossessed as might be with any of the modern theories of philosophy, until he was "provided of experiments" to help him judge of them, he refrained from any study of the [[atomism|Atomical]] and the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] systems, and even of the Novum Organum itself, though he admits to "transiently consulting" them about a few particulars. Nothing was more alien to his mental temperament than the spinning of hypotheses. He regarded the acquisition of knowledge as an end in itself, and in consequence he gained a wider outlook on the aims of scientific inquiry than had been enjoyed by his predecessors for many centuries. This, however, did not mean that he paid no attention to the practical application of science nor that he despised knowledge which tended to use.

Robert Boyle was an [[alchemy|alchemist]];&lt;ref name="More1941"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/2707281 |last=More |first=Louis Trenchard |title=Boyle as Alchemist |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=61–76 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |date=January 1941 |jstor=2707281}}&lt;/ref&gt; and believing the [[wikt:Transmutation|transmutation]] of metals to be a possibility, he carried out experiments in the hope of achieving it; and he was instrumental in obtaining the repeal, in 1689, of the statute of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] against [[Mines Royal Act 1689|multiplying]] gold and silver.&lt;ref name="sep-boyle"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=MacIntosh |first1=J. J. |last2=Anstey |first2=Peter |chapter=Robert Boyle |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/boyle/notes.html#4 |year=2010 |edition=Fall |at=note 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; With all the important work he accomplished in [[physics]] – the enunciation of [[Boyle's law]], the discovery of the part taken by air in the propagation of sound, and investigations on the expansive force of freezing water, on [[specific gravity|specific gravities]] and [[refraction|refractive]] powers, on [[crystal]]s, on electricity, on colour, on [[hydrostatics]], etc. – [[chemistry]] was his peculiar and favourite study. His first book on the subject was ''The Sceptical Chymist'', published in 1661, in which he criticised the "experiments whereby vulgar [[Spagyric|Spagyrists]] are wont to endeavour to evince their Salt, [[Sulphur]] and [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] to be the true Principles of Things." For him chemistry was the science of the composition of substances, not merely an adjunct to the arts of the alchemist or the physician. He endorsed the view of elements as the undecomposable constituents of material bodies; and made the distinction between [[mixture]]s and [[compound (chemistry)|compound]]s. He made considerable progress in the technique of detecting their ingredients, a process which he designated by the term "analysis". He further supposed that the elements were ultimately composed of [[Subatomic particle|particle]]s of various sorts and sizes, into which, however, they were not to be resolved in any known way. He studied the chemistry of [[combustion]] and of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], and conducted experiments in [[physiology]], where, however, he was hampered by the "tenderness of his nature" which kept him from anatomical [[dissection]]s, especially [[vivisection]]s, though he knew them to be "most instructing".

==Theological interests==
In addition to philosophy, Boyle devoted much time to theology, showing a very decided leaning to the practical side and an indifference to controversial [[polemic]]s. At the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the king in 1660, he was favourably received at court and in 1665 would have received the provostship of Eton College had he agreed to take holy orders, but this he refused to do on the ground that his writings on religious subjects would have greater weight coming from a layman than a paid minister of the Church.

Moreover, Boyle incorporated his scientific interests into his theology, believing that natural philosophy could provide powerful evidence for the existence God. In works such as ''Disquisition about the Final Causes of Natural Things'' (1688), for instance, he criticised contemporary philosophers - such as [[René Descartes]] - who denied that the study of nature could reveal much about God. Instead, Boyle argued that natural philosophers could use the design apparently on display in some parts of nature to demonstrate God's involvement with the world. He also attempted to tackle complex theological questions using methods derived from his scientific practices. In ''Some Physico-Theological Considerations about the Possibility of the Resurrection'' (1675), he used a chemical experiment known as the reduction to the pristine state as part of an attempt to demonstrate the physical possibility of the [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrection of the body]]. Throughout his career, Boyle tried to show that science could lend support to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wragge-Morley|first=Alexander|date=2017|title=Robert Boyle and the representation of imperceptible entities|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-for-the-history-of-science/article/robert-boyle-and-the-representation-of-imperceptible-entities/EAF044425AB23E01295157165B299566|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|volume=|pages=1–24|doi=10.1017/S0007087417000899|issn=0007-0874|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a director of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] he spent large sums in promoting the spread of Christianity in the East, contributing liberally to [[missionary]] societies and to the expenses of translating the Bible or portions of it into various languages. Boyle supported the policy that the Bible should be available in the vernacular language of the people. An [[Irish language]] version of the [[New Testament]] was published in 1602 but was rare in Boyle's adult life. In 1680–85 Boyle personally financed the printing of the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, in Irish.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first= Talbot|last= Baines Reed |title= A History of the Old English Letter Foundries|year=1887|url= https://archive.org/details/ahistoryoldengl00reedgoog/ | pages = 189–90}}. Also {{Citation | editor-first = S.L | editor-last = Greenslade | year = 1963 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IDFBru3-C8MC&amp;pg=PA172 | title = The Cambridge History of the Bible: The West from the Reformation to the Present Day | pages = 172–73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, Boyle's attitude to the Irish language differed from the English [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] class in Ireland at the time, which was generally hostile to the language and largely opposed the use of Irish (not only as a language of religious worship).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Adrian |last=Hastings|title= The Construction of Nationhood: Ethnicity, Religion, and Nationalism |publisher= [[Cambridge University]] |location= Cambridge |year= 1997 |page= 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyle also had a [[monogenism|monogenist]] perspective about [[race (classification of humans)|race]] origin. He was a pioneer studying races, and he believed that all human beings, no matter how diverse their physical differences, came from the same source: [[Adam and Eve]]. He studied reported stories of parents' giving birth to different coloured [[albinos]], so he concluded that Adam and Eve were originally white and that Caucasians could give birth to different coloured races. Boyle also extended the theories of [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Isaac Newton]] about colour and light via optical projection (in [[physics]]) into discourses of [[polygenism|polygenesis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyle|first1=Jen E.|title=Anamorphosis in early modern literature : mediation and affect|date=2010|publisher=Ashgate|location=Farnham, Surrey, [England]|isbn=1409400697|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; speculating that maybe these differences were due to "[[social influence|seminal]] impressions". Taking this into account, it might be considered that he envisioned a good explanation for [[complexion]] at his time, due to the fact that now we know that skin colour is disposed by [[genetic code|genes]], which are actually contained in the [[semen]]. Boyle's writings mention that at his time, for "European Eyes", beauty was not measured so much in [[colour of skin]], but in "stature, comely symmetry of the parts of the body, and good features in the face".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gutenberg.net/1/4/5/0/14504 | title=Experiments and Considerations Touching Colours (1664) (ebook) | publisher=Gutenberg Project | accessdate=11 October 2016 | website=www.gutenberg.net | pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various members of the scientific community rejected his views and described them as "disturbing" or "amusing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Palmeri, Frank |title= Humans And Other Animals in Eighteenth-Century British Culture: Representation, Hybridity, Ethics |year=2006 |pages=49–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his Will, Boyle provided money for a series of lectures to defend the [[Christianity|Christian religion]] against those he considered "notorious infidels, namely [[Atheism|atheists]], [[Deism|deists]], [[Paganism|pagans]], Jews and Muslims", with the provision that controversies between Christians were not to be mentioned (see [[Boyle Lectures]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stmarylebow.co.uk/#/the-boyle-lecture/4535974239 | title = The Boyle Lecture | work = St. Marylebow Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samael Aun Weor''' ({{lang-he-n|סםאל און ואור}}) (March 6, 1917 – December 24, 1977), born Víctor Manuel Gómez Rodríguez, was a spiritual teacher and author of over sixty books of [[Esotericism|esoteric spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements| year = 2004| isbn = 9781134499694| page = 236|editor1-last=Clarke |editor1-first=Peter B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught and formed groups under the banner of 'Universal [[Gnosticism]]', or simply [[gnosis]]. Samael Aun Weor referred to his teachings as 'The Doctrine of Synthesis', which not only emphasizes the existence of the [[perennial philosophy]], but that its highest [[teleological]] function is the accomplishment of 'Christification' and 'Final Liberation.'&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Gordon Melton]] &amp; Martin Baumann ''Religions of the World'', p. 553, ABC-Clio, 2002 {{ISBN|1-57607-223-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Gnostic Bible: The Pistis Sophia Unveiled | year=2005| isbn = 0974591688| page=293| last1=Samael Aun Weor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Victor Manuel Gómez Rodriguez was born in [[Bogotá]], [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]], [[Republic of Colombia]], son of Manuel Gómez Quijano and Francisca Rodríguez de Gómez. He was baptized in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] but later rejected the Church of Rome. His childhood and family life are not well known, except that he had a brother, and his father remarried after a divorce. He was sent to a Roman Catholic Jesuit school but soon quit disillusioned by religion; he was twelve years old at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Le religioni in Italia (Religion in Italy)| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UmfXAAAAMAAJ| year = 2006| publisher = Elledici| language = Italian| isbn = 88-01-03371-0| page = 871| quote = Dopo avere iniziato gli studi in un collegio gesuita...(After beginning his studies in a Jesuit school...)| last1 = Introvigne| last3 = Di Marzio| last2 = Zoccatelli| first1 = Massimo| first2 = Pier Luigi| first3 = Raffaella }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he invested most of his time in the study of metaphysical and esoteric treatises.&lt;ref name="ttm"&gt;{{cite book| author = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Three Mountains| date = 2003-09-01| origyear = 1972| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-5-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnold Krumm-Heller]] founded the ''Iglesia Gnostica'' (Gnostic Church) in Mexico in 1910 and in Brazil he founded the ''[[Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua|Fraternidad de Rosacruz Antiqua]]'' (Fraternity of the Ancient Rosicrucians), following [[Paschal Beverly Randolph|Randolph's]] usage. Between the time after World War II and his death in 1949, Krumm-Heller resumed contact with his Latin America students, where he encountered and subsequently mentored Victor Rodriguez who would subsequently take the name Samael Aun Weor.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDawsonNew|Dawson (2007) p. 55-57]]*&lt;cite id=refDawsonNew&gt;{{cite book| last = Dawson| first = Andrew| authorlink =| title = New era, new religions: religious transformation in contemporary Brazil| publisher = Ashgate Publishing| contribution =| year = 2007| location = Burlington, VT| pages =| url =| doi =| id =| isbn = 978-0-7546-5433-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life, as writer, lecturer and Gnostic teacher, he would demonstrate a profound esoteric knowledge of both Eastern and Western classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Salazar |first=Fernando |title=El Rayo del Superhombre (The Ray of Superman) |year=1977 |publisher=Editorial Logos Solar |language=Spanish |quote=Ha igualado y superado a los más destacados escritores ocultistas o esoteristas como...(He has equaled and bettered the most distinguished occult or esoteric writers like...) |page=119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiographical account, ''The Three Mountains'', Samael Aun Weor stated that because he was born with an awakened [[consciousness]], he was analyzing the previous lives in which he awakened his consciousness before mastering how to walk.&lt;ref name="ttm"/&gt; At the age of 17, he was asked to lecture at the local [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical Chapter]], and a year later was admitted into the occult society [[Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua]] (F.R.A.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lamprecht| first = Harald| title = Neue Rozenkreuzer: ein Handbuch (Neo-Rosicrucians: a manual)| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=q-NT3cCt9I4C| year = 2004| publisher = Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht| language = German| isbn = 3-525-56549-6| page = 157| quote = V. M.  Gómez Rodrigues=Samael Aun Weor }}&lt;/ref&gt; While a student in the F.R.A., Samael Aun Weor methodically studied the entire [[Rosicrucian]] library and it was here that he allegedly learned the secret of the "Great Arcanum", or white [[Sex magic#Samael Aun Weor|Sexual Magic]] – the esoteric key which purportedly underpins all of the world's great religions.&lt;ref name="ttm"/&gt;

Few details of his life are known between the mid-1930s and 1950. He became a spiritual vagabond of sorts, traveling with neither home nor income. At one point he lived with a tribe of indigenous people in the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] in northern Colombia, learning the healing secrets which would later form the foundation of his medical treatise, ''Occult Medicine and Practical Magic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Samael Aun Weor| title = Occult Medicine and Practical Magic| date = 2004-04-01| origyear = 1978| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9745916-2-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also during these years that he claimed to have had his first experience of the [[Sunyata|Illuminating Void]] meeting his "Inner Being" or [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] whose name is "Aun Weor", meaning in Hebrew "Light and Strength."

He was briefly married to Sara Dueños and they had a son named "Imperator". However, in 1946, he met and married the Lady-Adept "Litelantes" (born Arnolda Garro Mora) with whom he lived for 35 years and had four children: Osiris, Isis, Iris, Hypatia. Samael Aun Weor explains that as soon as he met her, this "Lady-Adept" [[Genie]] began to instruct him in the Science of Jinnestan or Jinn State also known as Djinn State or Djinnestan, which he claims involved placing the physical body in the [[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Samael Aun Weor| title = Occult Medicine and Practical Magic| date = 2004-04-01| origyear = 1978| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9745916-2-9| pages = 77–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Aztec religion]] this practice is known as Nahuatlism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Samael Aun Weor| title = Occult Medicine and Practical Magic| date = 2004-04-01| origyear = 1978| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9745916-2-9| pages = 107–109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Aun Weor is related with [[N-dimensional space|hyperspace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Aun Weor| first = Samael| title = The Yellow Book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=krYo5w_PKS4C| date = 2007-04-30| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 978-1-934206-12-6| page = 47| quote = Jinn Science is based on hyperspace; it is a special branch of atomic physics. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 he began teaching a small group of students. In 1950, under the name "Aun Weor", he managed to publish ''The Perfect Matrimony, or The Door to Enter into Initiation'' with the help of his close disciples.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Dawson ''New Era, New Religions'', p. 56, Ashgate Publishing Co., 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-7546-5433-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book, later entitled ''[[The Perfect Matrimony]],'' claimed to unveil the secret of sexuality as the cornerstone of the world's great religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Goldberg| first = Ben Zion| title = The Sacred Fire| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7xvt0__A04MC| year = 1930| publisher = Forgotten Books| isbn = 978-1-60620-047-6| page = 150| quote = ...the intentional loss of semen is an unpardonable sin. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he elucidated topics such as [[sexual transmutation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hill| first = Napoleon| authorlink = Napoleon Hill| title = Think and Grow Rich| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=c86H36mgiM4C| year = 1937| publisher = Forgotten Books| isbn = 978-1-60506-930-2| page = 182| quote = The mystery of sex transmutation (The tenth step toward riches) }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[white tantra]]", and esoteric initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Hidden Wisdom| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1uTgYGT3quAC| date = 2006-05-30| publisher = Quest Books| isbn = 978-0-8356-0844-2| page = 41| quote = ...Samael Aun Weor, has a "White Tantric" orientation...| last1 = Smoley| last2 = Kinney| first1 = Richard| first2 = Jay }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in such a candid manner regarding sex was met with disdain by the majority of the public at the time. Seen as immoral and pornographic, Aun Weor found himself fleeing angry mobs attempting to silence him through violent means. From March 14 to 19 of 1952 Aun Weor spends five days in jail for "committing the crime of healing the sick".&lt;ref name="ttm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Dawson| first = Andrew| title = New Era, New Religions| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-DgoCG9ZIQEC| year = 2007| publisher = Ashgate Pub Co| isbn = 978-0-7546-5433-9| page = 55| quote = ...for a time was imprisoned for 'quackery' by the Colombian authorities. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The account of his incarceration is recounted in a personal diary he later published as ''Secret Notes of a Guru''.

After March 19, 1952, Aun Weor and some disciples build and live near the ''Summum Supremum Sanctuarium'', an "underground temple" in the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] in [[Colombia]]. On October 27, 1954, Aun Weor received what is referred to as the "Initiation of [[Tiphereth]]", which, according to his doctrine, is the beginning of the incarnation of the [[Logos]] or "[[Glorian]]" within the soul. He states that in his case the name of his Glorian has always been called "Samael" through the ages. From then on, he would sign his name Samael Aun Weor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The allure of Gnosticism: the Gnostic experience in [[Jungian psychology]] and contemporary culture| date = 1995-03-01| publisher = Open Court| isbn = 978-0-8126-9277-8| page = 217| quote = ...

Upon being asked exactly what such a title meant, he responded:

{{quote|text=A messenger or avatar, in the most complete sense of the word, is a courier, a man who delivers a message, a servant or maid of the Great Work. So, the word avatar must not fall into misinterpretations, it must be specified with complete clarity. I am, therefore, a servant or crew member, or messenger who delivers a message. Some time ago I said that I am a cosmic mailman, since I am giving the content of a cosmic letter. Therefore, my beloved brethren, the word avatar must never lead us to arrogance, since it only means nothing other than an emissary, a servant, a crew member who gives a message, an epistle, and that is all. In regard to Buddha Maitreya, we must analyze these two words a little in order not to fall into misinterpretations. The Innermost-Buddha in itself is the real Being, the Innermost of each one of us. Thus, when the Innermost or the real Being of somebody has attained its proper intimate Self-realization, then he is declared a Buddha. However, the term Maitreya is individual and collective; thus, from the individual point of view, it represents a teacher whose name is Maitreya, but from the collective point of view Buddha Maitreya must be understood—in the most complete sense of the word—as any initiate who has managed to Christify himself, and that is all.|sign=Samael Aun Weor|source=[http://gnosticteachings.org/the-teachings-of-gnosis/lectures-by-samael-aun-weor/the-avatar The Avatar]}}

Although he would declare himself as the true Kalki Avatar many times throughout his works, he also regularly rejected the worship of his personality:

{{quote|text=I, Samael, am not in need of henchmen or followers, but only imitators of my doctrine: Gnosis.  I do not follow anyone, nor do I want anyone to follow me. What I want is for each one of you to follow his own Self.  I am only a lighthouse in the sea of existence, and I do not need clientele in order to subsist. Since I am against the slavery of souls, I do not want to enslave any soul, nor do I agree with executioners of ideals. Masters exists in abundance, and I am only one of many; thus, those who want to find the Masters will find them inside, within the profundities of their own inner consciousness.|sign=Samael Aun Weor|date=1953|source=[http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/536/43/ Inside the Vestibule of Wisdom]}}

In 1956, he left Colombia and went to Costa Rica and El Salvador. Later in 1956, he settled down for good in [[Mexico City]], where he would begin his public life.&lt;ref name="absolute-man"&gt;{{cite book | author=Oscar Uzcategui | title=Samael Aun Weor, The Absolute Man | publisher=[[AGEAC]] | origyear=2008 | year=2008 | isbn=9789730054798 | page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1960, he had published 20 more books with topics ranging from ''[[Endocrinology]] and [[Criminology]]'' to ''[[Kundalini Yoga]]''. He founded numerous Gnostic Institutions and created Gnostic centers in [[Mexico]], [[Panama]], [[El Salvador]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Venezuela]]. A "triangle" relationship was established between the Universal Gnostic Movement founded by Samael Aun Weor, the South American Liberation Action (ALAS) in [[Argentina]] headed by [[Francisco A. Propato]] Ph.D.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/5883/luxemil.htm%3F200816&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:06:30 Prof. Dr. [[Francisco A. Propato]], Ph.

Propato Spanish translation of the Rubaiyat Of Omar Khayyam]&lt;/ref&gt;), and the [[Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres|Sivananda Aryabarta Ashram]] directed by [[Swami Sivananda]] in [[India]].&lt;ref name="aqu-msg"&gt;{{cite book| author = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Aquarian Message: Gnostic Kabbalah and Tarot in the Apocalypse of St. John| date = 2004-01-01| origyear = 1960| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9745916-5-3| page = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the victories, the development of the Gnostic Movement was not without dramatic setbacks. At the time of publishing the revised edition of ''The Perfect Matrimony'' (1961), the movement had fallen apart. He wrote that "those who did not leave the Gnostic Movement can be counted on the fingers of one hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Perfect Matrimony| date = 2001-11-01| origyear = 1961| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-0-6| page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the time of his death, Samael Aun Weor had completely re-established the broad international reaches the movement previously held.

Into the 1960s, he continued to write many books on topics, such as [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] [[Astrology]], [[Flying Saucers]], and the [[Kabbalah]]. However, he also wrote sociopolitical works such as the ''Platform of POSCLA'' (Partido Socialista Cristiano Latinoamericano, or Latin-American Christian Socialist Party) and ''The Social Christ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Jolie| first = Angelina| authorlink = Angelina Jolie| title = Notes From My Travels| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1njZ6jJw9jAC| accessdate = 2009-08-18| date = 2003-10-28| publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster| isbn = 0-7434-7023-0| page = 222| quote = They tell me about the man they follow - contemporary philosopher Samael Aun Weor - whose teachings are about how humans can get better... }}&lt;/ref&gt; Topics such as the "false" doctrines of [[wall street]] [[materialism]], [[atheism]], and particularly [[Marxism-Leninism]] are discussed. POSCLA's motto was given as, "All for one and one for all," and its method, the conscious practice of [[Ahimsa]].

In what was to be the last decade of his life, he penned works such as ''Parsifal Unveiled'', which details the esoteric symbolism of the [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] opera, and ''Gnostic Anthropology'' in which he heavily criticizes the theories of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], "and their followers". The books ''The Great Rebellion'', ''Treatise of Revolutionary Psychology'', and ''The Revolution of the Dialectic'' provide a ground work for the vast knowledge of esoteric [[psychology]] purported to be found rooted in every genuine religion. During this time, he was preparing the highest vehicle of his doctrine, ''[[The Pistis Sophia Unveiled]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Samael Aun Weor ''Pistis Sophia Unveiled'', Thelema/Glorian, 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-9745916-8-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he meditated, verse-by-verse, upon the extremely esoteric Gnostic text ''[[Pistis Sophia]]''.

;Renunciation of Copyrights
Although he never formally received any income from his works - he lived off the charity of his students - at the 1976 International Gnostic Congress Samael Aun Weor he clarified his stance on the copyright of his works by stating:

{{quote|text=Now, my dear friends, and forever, I renounce, have renounced and will go on renouncing copyrights. My only wish is that these books be sold at a low price, affordable to the poor, affordable to all the children of God. I wish that even the poorest, most destitue citizen be able to obtain these books with the few pennies he carries in his pocket... Whosoever wants to publish them let him publish, for the benefit of diseased mankind.|sign=Samael Aun Weor|date=1976}}

;Prediction of Death
By 1972, Samael Aun Weor referenced that his death and resurrection would be occurring before 1978. In the chapter entitled ''The Resurrection'' in his work ''The Three Mountains'' (1972), he stated that the eight years of ordeals within the [[Book of Job|Trial of Job]] would occur between his 53rd and 61st birthdays. Furthermore, in the same work, it is stated that this ordeal occurs prior to resurrection, and the one going through it is "deprived of everything, even of his own sons, and is afflicted by an impure sickness."&lt;ref name="ttm" /&gt; By August 1977 he had developed [[stomach cancer]]. During this time he continued to speak to both his students and the general public, giving radio and television interviews while touring Mexico. Eventually he was forced to stop, due to debilitating stomach pain. As his condition steadily worsened he would mention to those at his bedside, "Don't cling to my battered body, instead cling to my doctrinal body."&lt;ref name="absolute-man2"&gt;{{cite book | author=Oscar Uzcategui | title=Samael Aun Weor, The Absolute Man | publisher=[[AGEAC]] | origyear=2008 | year=2008 | isbn=9789730054798 | page=638}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samael Aun Weor died on December 24, 1977. He was survived by his wife and children.

Years before his death, he declared he would adopt the use of a duly prepared ancient Egyptian "[[mummy]]" as a vehicle for further work, a vehicle better prepared than his own "physical body". Many of his followers expected him to return publicly shortly after his death. According to his own statements he planned to remain incognito for a certain time so that “the leaven will ferment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== The Doctrine of Synthesis ==

The Doctrine of Synthesis is a term Aun Weor used to describe the teachings he delivered through his books and lectures, because it purportedly elucidates and coherently [[syncretism|syncretizes]] an extensive variety of teachings which study the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Perfect Matrimony| date = 2001-11-01| origyear = 1961| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-0-6| chapter = Introduction }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Faivre ''Access to Western Esotericism'', p. 104, Suny Press, 1994 {{ISBN|978-0-7914-2178-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many of the metaphysical concepts expounded by such authors as [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky]], [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner]], and [[Gurdjieff]] provide a conceptual foundation in Aun Weor's teachings, he considered these works and movements conceptual preparation for the real unveiling of [[occultism]] or gnosis that he taught. His primary goal was not to simply elucidate a myriad of metaphysical concepts, but rather to teach the way to achieve self-realization through the "Direct Path of Christ". As he states in ''The Perfect Matrimony'': "We aspire towards only one thing, only one goal, only one objective: Christification. It is necessary for each human being to Christify himself. It is necessary to incarnate the Christ."

Aun Weor emphasizes that his doctrine is experiential, and must be put into practice for it to be of any value to the student.&lt;ref name="lmt"&gt;{{cite book| author = Samael Aun Weor| title = Logos, Mantra, Theurgy| date = 2007-01-03| publisher = Glorian Pub| isbn = 1-934206-04-0| chapter = Akasa| chapter-url = http://www.gnosticteachings.org/13-akasa| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080529001817/http://www.gnosticteachings.org/13-akasa| archivedate = 2008-05-29| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="teost"&gt;{{cite book |author=Samael Aun Weor |title= The Elimination of Satans Tail |year=1964 |chapter=[http://www.gnosticteachings.org/6-the-dissolution-of-the-i The Dissolution of the I]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his works there are hundreds of techniques and exercises that supposedly are of help in the development of [[psychic powers]], for example leaving the dense physical body at will ([[astral projection]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Karyn Allen|author2=Barbara Astman |author3=Robert Enright |author4=Nickle Arts Museum | title = Canadiana| volume = 7| year = 1985| publisher = National Library of Canada| isbn = 0-88953-049-1| quote = Astral Projection Samael Aun Weor }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to be taught in the schools of the "Higher Worlds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Perfect Matrimony| date = 2001-11-01| origyear = 1961| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-0-6| chapter = Two Rituals }}&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques are always combined with [[meditation]] and [[sexual sublimation|sexual transmutation]], and the perfection of such powers may take more than one lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Mystery of the Golden Blossom| date = 2003-01-01| origyear = 1971| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-2-2| chapter = The Seminal Pearl| quote = The price of enlightenment is paid with one's own life. In the sacred land of the [[Vedas]], there are [[Guru-shishya tradition]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is stated that if a student is successful in awakening [[consciousness]], he or she will eventually experience a continuous state of vigilance not only during the day but also while the physical body is sleeping, and most importantly after death. This is significant because Aun Weor states that those who have a sleeping consciousness are not aware of their postmortem condition, just as they are not aware when they are physically sleeping. The awakening of consciousness allows a student to continue to work regardless of their physical state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Perfect Matrimony| date = 2001-11-01| origyear = 1961| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-0-6| chapter = Consciousness, Subconsciousness, Supraconsciousness, Clairvoyant Consciousness }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===

Religions are viewed as idiosyncratic expressions of immutable and eternal values. Religions are said to be born and die in time, yet their spiritual values always remain eternal. When a religious form has fulfilled its mission, it begins to degenerate and dies, then a new messenger appears and delivers a doctrine appropriate for that culture. Different cultures require different doctrines for their development and this results in a vast difference of religious doctrines. Nevertheless, if one understands their core values, all religions naturally support each other.&lt;ref name="fe"&gt;{{cite book |last=Samael Aun Weor |title=Fundamental Education  |year=1970 |chapter=What to Think, How to Think}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Men| first = Hunbatz| title = Secrets of Mayan Science and Religion| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=I1aphNJzK-MC| year = 1990| publisher = Bear &amp; Co.| isbn = 978-0-939680-63-4| page = 40| quote = Samael Aun Weor cites the key concept that... }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is stated that any authentic religion possess what are called "The Three Factors of the Revolution of the Consciousness"&lt;ref name="threefactors"&gt;{{cite web |last=Samael Aun Weor |title=Three Factors of the Revolution of the Consciousness |url=http://gnosticteachings.org/the-teachings-of-gnosis/the-writings-of-samael-aun-weor/three-factors-of-the-revolution-of-the-consciousness |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128174747/http://gnosticteachings.org/the-teachings-of-gnosis/the-writings-of-samael-aun-weor/three-factors-of-the-revolution-of-the-consciousness |archivedate=2010-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are practical aspects of daily life:

1) Death: The psychological work of eliminating the [[Ego (spirituality)|ego]].
2) Birth: Giving birth to the superior potential of the soul, which is done through chastity and sexual transmutation.
3) Sacrifice: To work to aid suffering humanity "without desiring the fruits of action, without desiring reward; pure, sincere, disinterested sacrifice, giving one’s life in order for others to live, and without asking for anything in return."

Among these 3 factors, Samael Aun Weor highlights that the first one is the most important. 
A teaching that is missing any one of these components is considered incomplete or degenerate.

===Psychology===

The basis of Aun Weor's Practical Work is of a psychological nature. He states in many of his books that the purpose of his doctrine is to affect a psychological change. The terms Gnostic, Esoteric or Revolutionary Psychology are used to describe the psychological methods taught, and are said to be synonymous with the psychological teachings of religion.&lt;ref name="rp"&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = Revolutionary Psychology| date = 2001-12-01| origyear = 1975| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-7-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andre Dawson ''New Era, New Religions'', p. 101, Ashgate Publishing Ltd., 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-7546-5433-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental [[axiom]] presented is that an ordinary human being is not really human at all, but rather an intellectual animal (a rational animal) with [[consciousness]] asleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Samael Aun Weor| title = Treatise of Revolutionary Psychology| date = 2001-12-01| origyear = 1974| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-7-3| page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Samael Aun Weor, a true human being is someone who has no psychological imperfection, an image of God, as in Jesus' saying, "Become perfect as your Father in Heaven is perfect."&lt;ref name="tk"&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Initiatic Path in the Arcana of Tarot and Kabbalah| date = 2003-07-01| origyear = 1978| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-1-4| chapter = Tiphereth }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gm"&gt;{{cite book| author = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Major Mysteries| date = 2009-01-30| publisher = Glorian Pub| isbn = 1-934206-19-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Samael Aun Weor writes of the awakening of consciousness as being very similar to the traditional Buddhist understanding, and throughout his works he describes many analogous processes as they are spoken of in different religions.

In order to awaken the consciousness correctly, Aun Weor stated it was necessary to annihilate the ego. He taught that one’s ego is really not one but many, or a multitude of independent, contradictory desires. Likewise, each person's ego is said to actually contain many "I’s," many "egos," many "aggregates." Each desire is an "I" and each "I" has its own specific causes and conditions that lead to its personification at a particular time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Joel Gonzalez| title = 21st Century Practical Spiritual Metaphysic Guide Book for Atheist &amp; Agnostics| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tOtbubhAhrIC| date = 2011-03-27| publisher = Lulu.com| isbn = 978-0-615-17127-2| page = 211| quote = ... Most important is the elimination of your egos. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the mechanism behind what is commonly called "changing one’s mind" ([[metanoia (psychology)|metanoia]]) because when one "I" changes to another a literal exchange of personified psychological aggregates has taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Samael Aun Weor| title = Treatise of Revolutionary Psychology| date = 2001-12-01| origyear = 1974| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-7-3| chapter = The Permanent Center of Gravity }}&lt;/ref&gt; This "doctrine of the many", the Plural 'I' or Pluralized Ego, is the same as that taught by [[G.I. Gurdjieff]] and his disciple [[P. D. Ouspensky]] and is one of the reasons Aun Weor was sometimes accused of [[plagiarism]]. To this he responded that Gurdjieff was not the author of this doctrine and that its origin is found in Egypt and Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Samael Aun Weor.

;Consciousness

Consciousness is described as a state of being, very closely related to [[God]]. The consciousness within the normal person is said to be 97% asleep. Consciousness asleep is consciousness that is [[subconscious]], [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]], or infraconscious, which are various levels of psychological sleep. Psychological sleep is a way to describe the lack of self-awareness, meaning that the common and ordinary person is not aware of 97% of what constitutes the ordinary state of being. A consciousness asleep is caused by what Aun Weor calls identification, fascination, or the incorrect transformation of impressions, which all imply a type of consciousness that is not aware of its own processes. It is said that to awaken consciousness one must understand that his or her consciousness is asleep. This implies that one must begin to understand every impulse, action, thought and movement one makes, a feat that is said to be accomplished through the mental discipline of [[meditation]] and [[self-observation]]. Furthermore, it is stated that the awakening of consciousness is the only way to acquiring gnosis and achieve a true and radical change by removing the spurious psychological aggregates that cause unnecessary [[Dukkha|suffering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Samael Aun Weor| title = Treatise of Revolutionary Psychology| date = 2001-12-01| origyear = 1974| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-7-3| chapter = Decapitation }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rd"&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Revolution of the Dialectic| date = 2003-12-01| origyear = 1983| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9745916-3-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The awakening of consciousness goes hand in hand with the transmutation of sexual energy because the higher states of consciousness depend upon the energy of sexual transmutation.&lt;ref name="Andrew Dawson 101"&gt;{{cite book| author = Andrew Dawson| title = New era, new religions| year = 2007| publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.| isbn = 978-0-7546-5433-9| page = 101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Psychological aggregates

The purpose of the psychological work is to dissolve all the psychological aggregates one has accumulated.

===Physiology and sexology===

{{quote|We understand people of normal sexuality to be those who have no sexual conflicts of any kind.  Sexual energy is divided into three distinct types.  First: the energy having to do with the reproduction of the race and the health of the physical body in general. Second: the energy having to do with the spheres of thought, feeling and will.  Third: the energy that is found related with the Divine Spirit of man.

Indeed, sexual energy is without a doubt the most subtle and powerful energy normally produced and transported through the human organism.  Everything that a human being is, including the three spheres of thought, feeling and will, is none other than the exact outcome of distinct modifications of sexual energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Perfect Matrimony| url = http://gnosticteachings.org/books-by-samael-aun-weor/the-perfect-matrimony/931-normal-sexuality.html| date = 2001-11-01| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-0-6| chapter = Normal Sexuality| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These nervous systems are referred to as the "Three Brains" or three centers of the intellectual animal, and are named Intellectual Center, the Emotional Center, and the Motor-Instinctual-Sexual Center. Each center is studied in relation to the types of energies or "occult hydrogens" that animate them, the frequency at which each center operates (sexual center being the fastest, then emotional, then intellectual), and how psychological aggregates form and act within each center: psychological aggregates that are expressed through the intellect one way and through the emotions in a different way, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Samael Aun Weor| title = Treatise of Revolutionary Psychology| date = 2001-12-01| origyear = 1974| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-7-3| chapter = The Gnostic Esoteric Work }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Three Centers and Three Traitors
The three centers are directly related to the [[Trinity]], [[Trimurti]], or threefoldness of creation, the intellect being related to the Father ([[Keter (Kabbalah)|Kether]], Affirmation, Positive), the emotion related to the Son ([[Chokmah]], Denial, Negation), and the sexual center related to the [[Holy Spirit]] ([[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]], Reconcile, Neutral). The primary energy of the intellectual brain (Father) is the air, which is then placed in the bloodstream which is related to the emotional brain (Son), and lastly the final condensation of blood is found in the semen or sexual hormones, which is directly related to the Holy Spirit: that which impregnates or manifests creation, [[Shakti]], etc.&lt;ref name="pm-brains"&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Perfect Matrimony| date = 2001-11-01| origyear = 1961| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-0-6| page = 63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tk-sept"&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Initiatic Path in the Arcana of Tarot and Kabbalah| date = 2003-07-01| origyear = 1978| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-1-4| pages = 8–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samael Aun Weor teaches that psychological aggregates form in one of these three centers; therefore, it is said that there are three fundamental defects: the demon of the mind related to the intellectual center, the demon of desire related to the emotional center, and the demon of evil will related to the motor-instinctual-sexual center. They are collectively referred to as the "Three Traitors", and many references to religion are found that are held to symbolize them, for example: [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] (desire), [[Pilate]] (intellect), and [[Caiaphas]] (will) who crucify Jesus; Jubela, Jubelo, and Jubelum who murder [[Hiram Abiff]];&lt;ref&gt;Robert L.

;Lunar Bodies and Solar Bodies
Occult or esoteric anatomy and physiology is also studied, which refers to the study of the [[Subtle body|supra-sensible bodies]] of minerals, plants, animals (rational and irrational), and human beings. It is said that everyone contains seven bodies, closely related to the [[Septenary (Theosophy)|Theosophical septenary]], which Aun Weor calls physical, vital, emotional (astral), mental, causal, buddhic and atmic.&lt;ref name="tk-brains"&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Initiatic Path in the Arcana of Tarot and Kabbalah| date = 2003-07-01| origyear = 1978| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-1-4| page = 27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aun Weor differentiates between an intellectual animal and an authentic human being through the differences in the vehicles of emotion (astral body), mind (mental body) and will (causal body). Intellectual animals (ordinary man and woman) are said to contain the Lunar Astral Body, the Lunar Mental Body, and the Lunar Causal Body, each referred to by different names in different schools of Occultism. It is stated that these lunar bodies are the result of mechanical evolution through the mineral, plant and animal kingdoms and therefore, they are of an infrahuman or animal quality.&lt;ref name="tk-lunarbodies"&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Initiatic Path in the Arcana of Tarot and Kabbalah| date = 2003-07-01| origyear = 1978| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-1-4| page = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only true difference between the rational animal and irrational animals is the intellect, which gives the former the ability to become human, or as Aun Weor states, the intellectual animal has the "seed" or potential of a human latently existing within its sexual organs.&lt;ref name="rp-seed"&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = Revolutionary Psychology| date = 2001-12-01| origyear = 1975| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-7-3| page = xvii| chapter = Introduction }}&lt;/ref&gt;

What are called authentic human beings, although physically appearing identical, have crystallized the Solar Bodies: Solar Astral Body, Solar Mental Body, and Solar Causal Body. Lunar bodies are vehicles that receive the energy of creation (that is, God) at the level of an animal, while the solar bodies permit the reception of a much greater voltage allowing greater levels of wisdom and superior emotion to be incarnated. Aun Weor states that the solar bodies are collectively referred to as vehicles of the "[[soul]]".&lt;ref name="pm-sb"&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Perfect Matrimony| date = 2001-11-01| origyear = 1961| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-0-6| page = 259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aun Weor states that the solar bodies are formed in the same manner that physical bodies are formed: through use of the sexual function. In order to form the solar bodies, sexual transmutation is taught via the hetero [[sex magic#Samael Aun Weor|sexual magic]] of married couples engaged in [[coitus]] without orgasm or seminal ejaculation.&lt;ref name="ecrm"&gt;{{cite book |last=Samael Aun Weor |title=Esoteric Course of Runic Magic |chapter=Rune GIBUR |year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Robinson| first = Marnia| title = Cupid's Poisoned Arrow: from habit to harmony in sexual relationships| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=88EU4S8BhtoC| date = 2009-06-23| publisher = North Atlantic Books| isbn = 978-1-55643-809-7| page = 348| quote = For me the experiment was also a reminder that orgasms let out the lovely magical feelings you have built up during intercourse. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual magic is the arousal of sexual energies through the act of coitus between husband and wife, but instead of expelling those energies through orgasm they are transmuted into higher [[octaves]] of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Perfect Matrimony| date = 2001-11-01| origyear = 1961| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-0-6| page = 21| chapter = The Son of Man }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Fanthorpe| first = Patricia and Lionel|author2=Lionel Fanthorpe |author3=P.

;Three Forms of Sexuality

The topic of sexuality is approached from a very stern point of view, and it is indeed the crux of Aun Weor’s entire message. He states that there are three fundamental types of sexuality: suprasexuality, which is the sexual functioning of someone like Buddha or Jesus, who naturally transmutes all their energy perfectly; normal sexuality, which is defined as those who have no sexual conflict of any kind whatsoever and who transmute their sexual energy or use it to procreate the species; finally, the two spheres of infrasexuality, as described in the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] texts: [[Naamah (demon)|Nahemah]]'s sphere of influence which includes [[fornication]], [[adultery]], [[addiction]] and [[prostitution]] and [[Lilith]]'s sphere of influence, a category which includes [[homosexuality]], [[masturbation]], [[abortion]], [[bestiality]], [[sado-masochism]] and any other "abuse" of the sexual energy.&lt;ref name="pm-sexuality"&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Perfect Matrimony| date = 2001-11-01| origyear = 1961| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-0-6| pages = 45–64 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to his supposedly harsh views towards sex (especially for a "New Age" teacher), he wrote:

{{quote|text=Many hypocritical Pharisees hate us because we are not complaisant with whoredom, because we condemn crime, yet they state that this is why we hate. This is how they imprecisely judge us. What happens is that all of those hypocritical Pharisees from Spiritualism, Theosophism, Rosicrucianism, Aquarianism, etc., yearn for a sanctimonious mastery where masters are complaisant with crime; a type of spiritual whore-master who, complaisant with crime, goes around from lodge to lodge, from school to school, from sect to sect.

===Soteriology===

[[Soteriology]] (study of [[salvation]]) is presented in the light of every notable religion yet usually with special differences not held by orthodox interpretations. There are many degrees of salvation generally accomplished by paying one’s karma, removing the psychological imperfections and finally creating the solar bodies. The idea held by many religions that belief in God alone achieves salvation is categorically rejected.&lt;ref name="psu" /&gt;

Many different levels of salvation are explained, each depending upon the willpower of the individual accomplishing it. For those who do not remove their psychological imperfection (ego) – which is the cause of karma and the suffering of humanity – after approximately 108 rebirths they will have their ego removed forcefully through mechanical devolution within the infradimensions ([[Hell]]). Here it is said that "Mother Nature" mechanically pays out one’s accumulated karma through a great deal of suffering over thousands of years until one is returned to the state of an innocent [[elemental]], or Essence. This is said to be a state of being that is total happiness, yet not cognizant happiness and therefore not complete happiness. It should be noted that Hell is not taught as a place of eternal [[damnation]], just a place to pay one’s karma, and in fact it is seen as a part of God's grace because if the ego is not removed forcefully, these souls would continue to suffer indefinitely. It is held that after Hell, the elemental is reinserted into the mechanics of evolution in order to once again attempt to gain conscious happiness: They are first inserted at the basic level of existence (minerals), and through millions of years, [[Transmigration of the soul|transmigrate]] through increasingly complex organisms until the state of intellectual animal is reached again.&lt;ref name="psu-soter"&gt;{{cite book| author = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Pistis Sophia Unveiled| date = 2005-06-01| origyear = 1983| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9745916-8-8| pages = 211–214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For those who do work on themselves, depending on the degree of perfection, happiness and wisdom they wish to attain, two distinct paths emerge: the Straight Path of [[the Razor's Edge]]  and the Spiral Path. The Spiral Path involves reaching a state of relative enlightenment by choosing the enjoyment of the Higher Worlds ([[Heaven]] or [[Nirvana]]), and occasionally returning to a physical body in order to pay out a little more karma and help humanity in the process.&lt;ref name="psu-soter"/&gt; Samael Aun Weor refers to these as the [[Pratyekabuddha|Pratyeka Buddhas]] and [[Sravaka]]s, and that the vast majority who reach this state choose the Spiral Path because it is very easy and enjoyable. The dangerous Straight Path of the Razor's Edge is the Path of the Bodhisattva who renounces the happiness of the Higher Worlds (Nirvana) in order to help humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = David-Neel| first = Alexandra| authorlink = Alexandra David-Neel| title = Magic and Mystery in Tibet| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Q73tZFdjnDoC| date = 1971-06-01| publisher = Dover Publications Inc.| isbn = 0-486-22682-4| page = 243| quote = As for the method which mystics call the 'Short Path', the 'Direct Path', it is considered as most hazardous. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the doctrine of Samael Aun Weor, the Bodhisattva has a very specific definition, as it is not merely someone who has taken the [[Bodhisattva vows]]. It is the physical ([[Malkhuth (Kabbalah)|Malkuth]]), vital ([[Yesod]]), astral ([[Hod (Kabbalah)|Hod]]), mental ([[Netzach]]) and causal ([[Tiphereth]]) vehicles – in other words the human soul – of a self-realized spirit, ([[Gevurah|Geburah]]-[[Chesed]]) who has chosen the Straight Path of the Razor's Edge in order to incarnate the Christ ([[Keter (Kabbalah)|Kether]]-[[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]]-[[Chokhmah (Kabbalah)|Chokmah]]). In other words, the Bodhisattva is the "Son" of a self-realized God who is trying to return to the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] or 13th Aeon of the Pistis Sophia.&lt;ref name="psu-pratyeka"&gt;{{cite book| author = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Pistis Sophia Unveiled| date = 2005-06-01| origyear = 1983| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9745916-8-8| pages = 283–285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Christology

[[Christ]] is viewed as the savior but not as traditionally understood by contemporary Christianity. Instead, Christ is an impersonal force or intelligence that emanates from the Absolute as the [[Trinity]] and is also referred to as the [[Second Coming#Non-Orthodox Esoteric or Gnostic tradition|Cosmic Christ]]. Christ is said to have existed before Jesus, and is represented in different traditions with names such as [[Thoth]], Ormuz, [[Ahura Mazda]], [[Osiris]], [[Zeus]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Quetzalcoatl]], [[Okidanokh]], [[Kulkulcan]], Chrestos, [[Baldur]], and [[Avalokitesvara]]. It is held that Christ enters into and exalts any individual who is properly prepared, which denotes the complete annihilation of the ego, the exhaustion of all karma and the birth of the solar vehicles, the latter is necessary to handle the super high voltage of Christ. Samael Aun Weor writes that only those who choose the previously mentioned Straight Path of the Razor's Edge can incarnate the Christ because the Spiral Path is not a path of total sacrifice. Likewise, any true Bodhisattva has incarnated the Christ or is in process of doing so. It is said that in history Christ incarnated in [[Jesus]], [[Buddha]], [[Mohammed]], [[Krishna]], [[Moses]], [[Padmasambhava]], [[John the Baptist]], [[Milarepa]], [[Mahavatar Babaji]], [[Joan of Arc]], [[Fu Xi]], [[Ramakrishna]] as well as many others now forgotten by time (or made up in works of fiction) e. g. [[Zanoni]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Perfect Matrimony| date = 2001-11-01| origyear = 1961| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-0-6| pages = 131–132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tk-christ"&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Initiatic Path in the Arcana of Tarot and Kabbalah| date = 2003-07-01| origyear = 1978| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-1-4| pages = 147–148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Samael Aun Weor| title = The Doomed Aryan Race| date = 2003-01-01| origyear = 1967| publisher = Glorian Publishing| isbn = 0-9742755-6-5| page = 104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to notice that some of these individuals represent Christ as an impersonal force, e. g. Jesus, meaning that although he was an individual Christ, he taught the doctrine of the Cosmic Christ, intentionally molding his physical life after the psychological processes that one undergoes to incarnate the Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Segal, Singer, Stein|author2=June Singer | title = The Allure of Gnosticism| date = 1995-03-01| publisher = Open Court Pub Co| isbn = 978-0-8126-9277-8| page = 217| quote = Jesus studied in Egypt and practiced sex magic... }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with Buddha, Jesus is seen as a Bodhisattva who came to help humanity. Jesus is viewed as the Savior of the World because he is a [[Paramartha]]satya (an inhabitant of the Absolute) that physically incarnated specifically for the sake of poor suffering humanity. According to Samael Aun Weor, Jesus purposefully played out physically the internal or psychological struggle one must undergo in the path of Self-Realization; thus, the Gospels are a mixture of reality and kabbalistic, initiatic symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ouspensky| first = P.

[[File:Samael et Litelantes devant l'AGEACAC.jpg|thumb|right|Litelantes and Samael Aun Weor]]

===Anthropology===
His work ''Cosmic Teachings of a Lama'' states that life on Earth did not occur through [[abiogenesis]], but instead through [[pansperma]]. To Samael Aun Weor, the theories of abiogenesis are similar to those of [[spontaneous generation]], and that [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]] had already implicitly refuted the former when the latter was empirically disproved. Furthermore, while evolution is a verified fact of nature, [[speciation]] through [[Darwinian]] [[evolution]] has never been witnessed and is "an absurd theory without basis or foundation."&lt;ref&gt;Aun Weor, Samael''Cosmic Teachings of a Lama''. free online edition, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the sum of zoological variation is determined by the seeds of life traveling throughout space (protected by electromagnetic "whirlwinds") which determine the evolution and devolution of life on any planet. Life, according to Samael Aun Weor, is eternal, however its expression is divided into evolutive and devolutive modes: species evolve, reach a pinnacle, and necessarily devolve and return to a germinal state.

Man, therefore, is not the outcome of the evolution from a common ancestor to the primates, but rather the exponent of an eternal anthropic principle.  Monkeys, apes, and other primates are instead the outcome of certain sub-sects of ancient humanity copulating with animals, and are in a complete state of devolution.&lt;ref&gt;Aun Weor, Samael''Gnostic Anthropology'. free online edition, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=They say that the human being comes from the ape. They came out with the theory of the cynocephalus with a tail, the monkey without a tail and the arboreal men, all of them children of the noeptizoids, etc. But, which of these would then be the missing link? On what day have they found a monkey that is capable of speaking, that is gifted with speech? It has not appeared until now. Therefore, these materialistic gentlemen are ludicrous. They only present us suppositions and not facts.

Therefore are not the materialists refuting the theories of Darwin himself and his henchmen? Does the human being come from the ape? Upon which basis do they sustain this theory? How do they demonstrate it? Until when are we going to wait for the supposed missing link? We want to see that specie of ape speaking like people. That ape has not appeared, therefore such an ape is only a supposition of nonsense that has no reality.|sign=Samael Aun Weor|source=[http://gnosticteachings.org/books-by-samael-aun-weor/the-revolution-of-the-dialectic/1411-materialistic-science.html The Revolution of the Dialectic]}}

He does state however that evolution within a species is possible, yet that no species can evolve from another species. Furthermore, he states that the human or 'intellectual animal' naturally evolves in time, for example our society is an evolution from previous societies - however the evolution of species can never achieve spiritual liberation because it will always return to devolution. Spiritual liberation requires a 'revolution of consciousness'.

=== Eschatology ===
In many books Samael Aun Weor wrote about the "Final Catastrophe" or [[Apocalypse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Samael Aun Weor |title=Final Catastrophe |url=http://gnosticteachings.org/the-teachings-of-gnosis/lectures-by-samael-aun-weor/the-final-catastrophe-and-the-extraterrestrials |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128120913/http://gnosticteachings.org/the-teachings-of-gnosis/lectures-by-samael-aun-weor/the-final-catastrophe-and-the-extraterrestrials |archivedate=2010-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His work ''The Aquarian Message'' is a commentary on the Book of Revelation, which affirms the notion that present civilization will end and a future one will emerge. Only those souls who remove their ego in the present time will avoid the Second Death and re-transmigrations. A specific date is never given, only that this civilization is in the twilight of its existence.&lt;ref name="aqu-msg" /&gt;

===''The Social Christ'' and POSCLA===
Samael Aun Weor wrote about social problems in the books ''The Social Christ'' and ''The Social Transformation of Humanity''.&lt;ref&gt;Aun Weor, Samael ''El Cristo Social''. Unknown publisher, 1964 - English translation 2018, http://thesocialchrist.wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Social Christ''  is primarily concerned with a comprehensive critique of Marxism or [[Dialectical materialism|Dialectical Materialism]], but deals also with the injustices of the Capitalist system;&lt;blockquote&gt;"We are filled with horror in the presence of so much infamy. The ones that cannot pay for a stall in the public markets are persecuted, but they flatter and butter up the powerful gentlemen that steal millions of pesos from the people. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In this way the capitalists fertilize the soil and prepare it in order that in it the filthy flower of Communism can germinate."&lt;/blockquote&gt;All political systems, Samael states, are a reflection of our own psychology, and he explains that in order to finally finish with oppression it is necessary to change our own psychological state through the Death of Ego, combining this with non-violent resistance and the unionization of workers.&lt;blockquote&gt;"The struggle for the triumph of social justice is very long and hard, but we must never use violence, nor revolutions of blood and liquor."&lt;/blockquote&gt;In order "to start a new age and realize the Social Christ on the face of the earth", Samael Aun Weor formed a political party called 'POSCLA', The Christian Socialist Party of Latin America, which he later disbanded as a formal organization.

===Medicine and elemental magic===

In his works, ''Occult Medicine and Practical Magic'', ''Igneous Rose'' and others, Samael Aun Weor taught about elemental magic. In the former work he expressed his opposition to the medicine of modern science, allopathy, and called for the Gnostics to learn the ways of Indigenous and Elemental Medicine.

Samael Aun Weor taught that all the plants of nature are living Elemental Spirits, similarly to Paracelsus and many other esoteric teachers. He states that it is the Elemental Spirits who cure, not simply the 'cadavers of the plants'. Plants should be treated as living beings, harvested at the proper hours etc. He stated that the Elementals of all plants are aspects of The Divine Mother in the form of Mother Nature. In 'Occult Medicine and Practical Magic' he spoke about the healing methods of the Kogi Mamas, who diagnose sicknesses by means of clairvoyance.&lt;ref&gt;Aun Weor, Samael ''Occult Medicine And Practical Magic''. Various editions published, 1977, English online edition p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has labeled Samael Aun Weor's Christian Gnostic Movement as a pseudo-church&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Santagada |first1=Osvaldo D. |last2=Catholic Church |first2=Latin America Episcopal Council |title=Sectas en America Latina (Sects in Latin America) |page=195 |publisher=Ediciones Paulinas - CELAM |year=1989 |language=Spanish |quote=This movement is particularly active in Colombia. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pCsxAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Samael+Aun+Weor+-inauthor:%22Samael+Aun+Weor%22&amp;cd=71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some Roman Catholic authors have accused Samael Aun Weor of trying to seduce Roman Catholic priests and nuns to abandon their [[vows of celibacy]] and practice the sexual teachings promulgated by the Gnostic Movement; these authors also believe that the current wave to discredit the legitimacy of the Roman Catholic Church comes from the same source&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bermudez Ardila| first = Fernando| title = Santos, heroes y satiros (Saints, heroes and satyrs| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WCpCvFvCTeoC| year = 2007| publisher = Fernando Bermudez Ardila| language = Spanish| isbn = 978-958-44-0227-1| pages = 131–132| quote = The Gnostic Church is a new religious ideal created for this day and age. }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others go so far as to label it heresy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bronx |first=Humberto |title=Estudios sobre sectas, errores y herejías (Studies on sects, errors and heresies) |page=81 |publisher=Editorial A. Salazar |language=Spanish |quote=On page 296 of the book ''The Perfect Matrimony'', it reads: "Christ was the son of a Roman soldier and a Hebrew woman." |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Al9ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Samael+Aun+Weor+-inauthor:%22Samael+Aun+Weor&amp;dq=Samael+Aun+Weor+-inauthor:%22Samael+Aun+Weor%22&amp;cd=92 |date=1980* }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 11 Feb 1984 or thereabouts, the Ministry of [[Tenerife]], [[Spain]], denied incorporation to Samael Aun Weor's Universal Christian Gnostic Church of Spain operating from 38 San Francisco St., in [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], Spain, on the grounds that said organization is not a legitimate church as it does not have any record of incorporation as such in any country whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Catalá Rubio| first = Santiago| title = El derecho a la personalidad jurídica de las entidades religiosas (The right of incorporation of religious groups)| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-KtM6bbVCO0C| year = 2004| publisher = Universidad de Castilla, La Mancha| language = Spanish| isbn = 84-8427-205-2| pages = 330–332| quote = Este Ministerio ha resuelto denegar la inscripción en el Registro de Entidades Religiosas de la denominada "Iglesia Gnóstica Cristiana Universal de España." (This Ministry has resolved to deny incorporation to the religious group "Universal Christian Gnostic Church of Spain). }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, after numerous consultations with high-ranking members of the Roman Catholic Church and other figures who prefer to remain anonymous such as lawyers, public prosecutors, psychiatrists and psychologists, Pilar Salarrullana who has been a political figure since 1974 and is considered an expert on sects, published ''Las Sectas'' (''The Sects: a living testament to Messianic terror in Spain'') which became a best-seller with six editions the first year alone and in spite of its popularly inquisitorial tone, it denounces the Gnostic Movements among others as some of the most dangerous anti-social plagues in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bella |first1=López |last2=Álvaro |first2=José |title=Un estudio de antropología social de las organizaciones: el caso del M.G.C.U.

In 1991, F. W. Haack (1935–1991), who was chief delegate of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical Church]] with responsibility for sects and ideologies, attacked Weor's ideology in a German book published in Zurich — nevertheless the Gnostic branches of the movement in Germany and Switzerland are still active and expanding.&lt;ref&gt;F.

'''Shamanic music''' is music played either by actual shamans as part of their rituals, or by people who, whilst not themselves shamans, wish to evoke the cultural background of [[shamanism]] in some way. So '''Shamanic music''' includes both music used as part of shamans' rituals and music that refers to, or draws on, this.

In shamanism the shaman has a more active musical role than the medium in [[spirit possession]]. But a shaman's ritual is a ritual performance and not a musical performance, and this shapes its musical dimension. A shaman uses various ways of making sounds to which different ritual purposes are ascribed. Of particular importance are the shaman's song and shaman's drumming.

Recently in [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia|Siberia]], music groups drawing on a knowledge of shamanic culture have emerged. In the West shamanism has served as an imagined background to musics meant to [[altered state of consciousness|alter a listener's state of mind]].

[[Culture of Korea|Korea]] and [[Tibetan culture|Tibet]] are two cultures where the music of shamanic ritual has interacted closely with other traditions.

[[File:Gitksan man.jpg|thumb|right|Gitksan shaman with rattle]]

== Shamanic and musical performance ==

Although shamans use singing as well as drumming and sometimes other instruments, a shamanic ritual is not a musical performance in the normal sense, and the music is directed more to [[spirits]] than to an audience. Several things follow from this. First, a shamanic ritual performance is, above all, a series of actions and not a series of musical sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Mihály Hoppál, ''Tracing Shamanism in Tuva: A History of Studies'', in Mongush Kenin Lopsan,  ''Shamanic Songs and Myths of Tuva'', Istor Budapest 1997 p 129 "...the struggle with the harmful spirits during which great drumbeats indicated that the shaman had driven a "steel arrow" for each beat into the spirits of sickness."&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the shaman's attention is directed inwards towards her or his visualisation of the spirit world and communication with the spirits, and not outwards to any listeners who might be present.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hodgkinson, ''Musicians, Carvers, Shamans'', Cambridge Anthropology vol 25, no 3, (2005/2006) p 9."Sergei Tumat (a Tuvan shaman who had previously studied music):   “When I shamanize, I'm not here, not in the place where I'm playing the dungur drum, it's just  my material body that's there: I'm away with the spirits, that's where my total attention is. If someone touches me, tries to get my attention there in the yurt, that's dangerous, it  would be like falling a long way: so it's completely different from playing music to an  audience, where you have to be there, to be attentive to what your material body is  doing, to everything I learned in music school...”"&lt;/ref&gt; Third, it is important for the success of the ritual that it be given its own clearly defined context that is quite different from any kind of entertainment. Fourth, any theatrical elements that are added to impress an audience are of a type to make the contact with the spirits seem more real and not to suggest the performer's musical virtuosity. From a musical perspective shamanic ritual performances have the distinctive feature of {{wt|en|discontinuity}}. Breaks may happen because a spirit is proving difficult to communicate with, or the shaman needs to call a different spirit. Typically, phases of the performance are broken off abruptly, perhaps to be restarted after a gap, perhaps not.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Pegg, ''Mongolian Music, Dance and Oral Narrative'', University of Washington Press, 2001, p135-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Hutton, ''The Shamans of Siberia'', Isle of Avalon Press, 1993, p29 and p31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Humphrey, ''Shamans and elders''. Oxford, OUP1996,  p 235-7&lt;/ref&gt; The rhythmic dimension of the music of shamans' rituals has been connected to the idea of both incorporating the rhythms of nature and magically re-articulating them.&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Serra, (in Italian)''Ritmo e ciclità nella cultura sciamanica'', in Antonello Colimberti (ed) ''Musiche e sciamani'', Textus, Milan 2000, p67&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shamanism and possession ==

It has been argued&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Rouget, ''Music and Trance'', University of Chicago Press 1985 p125&lt;/ref&gt; that shamanism and [[spirit possession]] involve contrasting kinds of special states of mind. The shaman actively enters the spirit world, negotiates with her or his own helper spirit and then with other spirits as necessary, and moves between different territories of the spirit world. The possessed medium, on the other hand,  is the passive recipient of a powerful spirit or god. This reflects on the different uses of music involved. Possession music&lt;ref&gt;Fremont E.Besmer, ''Horses, Musicians and Gods: The Hausa Cult of Possession-Trance''.  Ahmadu Bello UP 1983&lt;/ref&gt; is typically long in duration, [[Hypnosis|mesmeric]], loud and intense, with climaxes of rhythmic intensity and volume to which the medium has learned to respond by entering a trance state: the music is not played by the medium but by one or more musicians. In shamanism, the music is played by the shaman, confirms the shaman's power (in the words of the shaman's song), and is used actively by the shaman to modulate movements and changes of state as part of an active journey within the spirit world. In both cases the connection between music and an [[altered state of mind]] depends on both psychoacoustic and cultural factors, and the music cannot be said to 'cause' trance-states.&lt;ref&gt;Roberte Hamayon,(in French) ''Pour en finir avec la 'trance' et 'l'extase' dans l'étude du chamanisme'', in Etudes mongoles et sibériennes 26: Variations Chamaniques 2, 1995, p155 seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sound is tactile; whereas visual information is experienced at the surface, auditory information seems to be both outside and inside the body.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Ong, ''Orality and Literacy: The technologizing of the word'', Methuen, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sound mimesis in various cultures|In oral cultures in which survival involves close contact with nature, sound often connects inner feelings to features of the natural environment]]. In many cases, this holds also for the [[Imitation of sounds in shamanism|music in shamanistic practice, including e.g. onomatopoeia, imitation of animal cries etc.]]. The shaman's use of sound is to catalyse an imaginary inner environment which is experienced as a sacred space-time in which the shaman travels and encounters spirits.  Sound, passing constantly between inner and outer, connects this imaginary space with the actual space of the ritual in which the shaman is moving and making ritual actions and gestures.

It has been suggested that the sound material used by the shaman constitutes a system of sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Ruggero, (in Italian)  ''La musica sciamanica'' . - Xenia - 2004, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of a [[semiotics]] of the sound material would imply a symbolic language shared between the shaman and the surrounding community. However, the evidence suggests that any symbolic language elements are understood only by the shaman and perhaps by other shamans initiated by this shaman. In other words, the symbolic language - if there is one - is more likely to be shared with the spirits than with a human community.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Taussig,  ''The Nervous System'' . - Routledge - 1992 p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

A shaman may use different sounds for different ritual purposes: 
*'''Setting up the sound-space of the ritual''' 
A very important element in [[Shamanism in Siberia|Siberian shamanism]] is the use of hanging metallic objects - possibly including small bells - attached to the shaman's ritual cloak and to the inside of the drum and also sometimes to the beater. This sets up a continuously moving sound field, heard as a single complex sound.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Stiller, ''Handbook of Instrumentation'', University of California Press, 1985, p 121, {{ISBN|0-520-04423-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further element is the spatialisation of sound brought about not only by the shaman's movement, but also by techniques of singing into the drum to create the illusion of the voice coming from elsewhere. Different individual shamans and different local traditions may use different sounds. For example, in the south of Tuva and in Mongolia the ''khomus'', or jaw harp is commonly used in shamanising.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Pegg, ''Mongolian Music, Dance and Oral Narrative'', University of Washington Press, 2001, p124&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Preparation'''
Particular sounds, like bells, may be used for purifying the place in which the ritual is to be performed.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Walker, ''Music as Knowledge in Shamanism and Other Healing Traditions of Siberia'', in
Arctic Anthropology.2003; 40(2): p45&lt;/ref&gt; This is because a ritual involving contact with the spirits is always potentially dangerous, and one of the dangers is that of pollution.

*'''Calling and sending back spirits'''
A bell may also be used for calling or sending back spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kongin Seo, ''Hanyang Kut: Korean Shaman Ritual Music from Seoul'', Routledge 2002 p14&lt;/ref&gt; Shamans will also imitate the sounds of birds and animals in order to call spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Levin, ''Where Rivers and Mountains Sing'',  (Indiana University Press 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Sami shamanic singing, called [[Joik]], is also about summoning, for example, animal spirits, rather than singing about them or representing them: the spirit is experienced as being present.&lt;ref&gt;Tina Ramnarine, ''Acoustemology, Indigeneity &amp; Joik'', Ethnomusicology vol 53, no 2, spring/summer 2009, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Healing'''
Within shamanic ritual, sound can also be used as a healing power, conceived as a way of directing spiritual energy from the shaman into an afflicted person.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Walker, 2003, p46&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tuva]] sick persons are said to have been healed by the sound of a stringed instrument made from a tree struck by lightning.

== Shaman's song ==

The '''shaman's song''' - or ''algysh'' &lt;ref&gt;Mongush Kenin Lopsan, ''Shamanic Songs and Myths of Tuva'' Istor Budapest 1997&lt;/ref&gt; in Tuvan - is personal to the shaman&lt;ref&gt;Mihály Hoppál, ''Studies on Eurasian Shamanism'' in ''Shamans and Cultures''  in Mihály Hoppál and Keith Howard eds pp258-288 Istor Budapest 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and tells of her or his birthplace, initiation, ancestral pedigree, special gifts and special connections to particular spirits. The melody and words are composed by the shaman and generally remain the same throughout the shaman's professional life.  The ''algysh'' is often sung near the beginning of the ritual and accompanied by drumming on the dungur drum. It serves to remind the shaman of their shamanic identity and power. It proclaims the shaman's abilities and announces the shaman to the spirits. In some traditions the shaman's song may be broken up into short sections, varied and recombined in different performances.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Humphrey, ''Shamans and elders''. Oxford, OUP1996,  p 235&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shaman's drum ==

The single headed frame [[frame drum|'''drum''']]  is widely used in shamanic ritual, often with metallic ritual objects dangling inside, held by an interior wooden cross-piece, and played with a special beater that may also itself be a rattle.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Hyder, ''Shamanism and Music in Siberia :  DRUM AND SPACE'' {{cite web |url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/musicanddance/projects/project6/essays/file45912.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622115511/http://www.soas.ac.uk/musicanddance/projects/project6/essays/file45912.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drum will be made of consecrated materials, a specially chosen tree and the skin of a carefully chosen animal, sometimes by a specialist drum-maker. It will also have been 'enlivened' usually by a more powerful shaman so as to give it its spiritual properties.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Pegg, ''Mongolian Music, Dance and Oral Narrative'', University of Washington Press, 2001 p128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sevyan Vainshtein, ''The Tuvan Shaman's Drum and the ceremony of its Enlivening'', in V.Dioszegi (ed), ''Popular Beliefs and Folklore in Siberia'', Bloomington 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The head is sometimes decorated with a graphic typically representing the [[Religious cosmology|division of the cosmos into upper, middle and lower worlds]].  A shamanic ritual often begins with heating the drum head over a fire to bring it up to the desired pitch. A number of theories have been advanced to explain the importance of percussion in ritual music in general.&lt;ref&gt;Damian Walter, ''The Medium of the Message: Shamanism as Localised Practice in the Nepal Himalayas'' in ''The Archaeology of Shamanism'', ed Neil Price, Routledge 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Needham, ''Percussion and Transition'', Man 2:606-14. 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  One line of explanation is [[psychoacoustics|psychoacoustic]], whereby the tempo of the drum enables the shaman to enter the desired brain wave state, which corresponds to the number of beats per second of the drum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthlove.org/ECSTATIC%20TRANCE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105162700/http://www.earthlove.org/ECSTATIC%20TRANCE.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the case of shamanism, it seems that the portable drum is highly suited for a performance in which action and gesture are the top line.&lt;ref&gt;Roberte Hamayon, (in French)''Gestes et Sons, Chamane et Barde'',   in ''Chamanisme et Possession, Cahiers de Musiques Traditionelles 19'', Ateliers d'Ethnomusicologie, Genève, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The physical gesture of playing the drum is often integrated into a shamanic dance. For this reason the drumming is not restricted to regular tempo but may speed up and slow down with irregular accents.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hodgkinson, ''Siberian shamanism and improvised music'', Contemporary Music Review vol 14, parts 1-2, Netherlands, Harwood,1996, p62.&lt;/ref&gt; In some regions, the skin of a shaman's drum should be cut after his/her death.&lt;ref&gt;Mongush Kenin Lopsan,  ''Shamanic Songs and Myths of Tuva'' Istor Budapest 1997  p121&lt;/ref&gt; In others, not.&lt;ref&gt;Vilmos Diószegi,  ''Tracing Shamans in Siberia'' Anthropological Publications, Netherlands 1968, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shamanic groups ==

From the late 1980s with the loosening up of political restrictions a number of Siberian native cultures underwent a cultural renaissance, shamans began to practice openly again, and musicians formed '''bands''' drawing on shamanic traditions. Cholbon&lt;ref&gt;Henri Lecomte,(in French) ''Approches Autochtones du Chamanisme Sibérien au début du XXI Siècle'',  in ''Chamanisme et Possession, Cahiers de Musiques Traditionelles 19'', Ateliers d'Ethnomusicologie, Genève, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and AiTal,&lt;ref&gt;Aimar Ventsel, ''Sakha Pop Music'' p.10 http://www.princeton.edu/~restudy/soyuz_papers/Ventsel.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Sakha/Yakutsk, Biosyntes and early [[Yat-Kha]] in Tuva fall into this category. Nevertheless, the musicians involved, if sometimes unsure of their own exact role, recognized an important difference between artists using shamanic themes and shamans themselves. In the West bands began to apply the label 'shamanic' loosely to any music that might induce a trance state.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Howard, ''Sonic Transformations of  Shamanic Representations''  in AHRP Research Centre Newsletter 4, SOAS 2004, p19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terence McKenna, ''The Archaic revival''  Harper Collins 1991&lt;/ref&gt; This was partly due to the rarity of actual recordings of shamans' rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Rouget, ''Music and Trance'', University of Chicago Press 1985 p130&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the British-Tuvan group [[K-Space (band)|K-Space]] developed ways of combining improvisation, electronics and experimental recording and montage techniques with the more shamanic side of Tuvan traditional music. In Hungary [[Galloping Coroners|Vágtázó Halottkémek]]&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Milun quotes Anna Szemere: ''Up From the Underground - The Culture of Rock Music in Postsocialist Hungary'' Penn State Press 2001, http://www.pum.umontreal.ca/revues/surfaces/vol1/milun.html&lt;/ref&gt;(in English: Galloping Coroners) later [[Galloping Wonder Stag|Vágtázó Csodaszarvas]] set out under the banner of shamanpunk  to use ethnographic materials as manuals on how to reach and communicate ecstatic states. From 2005 Vágtázó Csodaszarvas (Galloping Wonder Stag) continued Vágtázó Halottkémek music philosophy turning it into a neotraditional music style closer to world music, replacing electronic guitars and drums with acoustic volk instruments.

== Korean shamanic music ==
{{See also|Korean shamanism}}

'''[[Korea]]''' is the only country where shamanism appears to have been a state religion practiced by the literate classes, during the Three Kingdoms Period (57BC-668AD). Under successive dynasties shamanism was gradually relegated to a popular or folk status with the arrival of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. The early official status of shamanism is the probable explanation for the fact that shamanic ritual in Korea developed highly complex and established forms. Correspondingly the music used in shamanic rituals is more elaborate in Korea than elsewhere. Furthermore, since the emergence of Korean contemporary nationalism, there has been a strong and sustained state intervention to preserve artistic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Howard, ''Perspectives on Korean Music: Preserving Korean Music: Intangible Cultural Properties as Icons of Identity'' v. 1 (SOAS Musicology Series) 2006&lt;/ref&gt; All of these factors make it uniquely difficult in Korea to distinguish the 'pure' from hybrid and concert forms of shamanic ritual music. For example, ''[[Sinawi]]'' is a musical form that can be used in shamanic rituals, or to accompany folk dances, or for urban concert performance. In the ritual context ''Sinawi'' is often performed by a small ensemble with the ''changgo'' hour-glass drum and two melodic instruments, often the ''taegum'' flute and the ''[[piri]]'' oboe. In concert the ensemble is augmented with stringed instruments&lt;ref&gt;Kyo-Chul Chung  CD notes for ''Seoul Ensemble of Traditional Music'' World Network 12, WDR 54.039.&lt;/ref&gt;   Modern ''Sinawi'' is played in a minor mode in 12/8 time.&lt;ref&gt;CD notes for''A selection of Korean traditional music, volume 2''. Instrumental Music 2, SBCD-4380-2&lt;/ref&gt; The role of music in Korean shamanism seems intermediary between the possession trance model and the Siberian model: in the ''Kut'' ritual, the music, played by musicians, first calls on the god to possess the ''mudang'' (shaman), then accompanies the god during their time in the shaman's body, then sends back and placates the god at the end.&lt;ref&gt;''Shamanism, The Spirit World of Korea'', eds Chai-shin Yu and R.Guisso, Asian Humanities Press, Berkeley California 1988&lt;/ref&gt; However, the shaman is the singer and dancer and the shaman directs the musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Bo Hyeong CD notes for Kim Suk Chul Ensemble: ''Shamanistic Ceremonies of the Eastern Seaboard'',  JVC, VICG-5261 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bön shamanic music and Buddhist music ==

Before Buddhism came to Tibet, the local form of shamanism was '''[[Bön]]'''.  Bön developed into an organised religion. When Buddhism arrived, both religions began competing with each other, and incorporated many of each other's practices. The Bön shaman's drum on a pole became part of Tibetan Buddhist ritual music ensembles. Also, the shang - a kind of bell-cymbal - became incorporated in Buddhist rituals. It was formerly only used by shamans to clear away negative energy before shamanic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret J. Kartomi ''On concepts and classifications of musical instruments''University of Chicago Press, 1990 pp 75-83 {{ISBN|978-0-226-42549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frankperry.co.uk/Tibetan%20Bowls.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216183730/http://frankperry.co.uk/Tibetan%20Bowls.htm |archivedate=2009-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepathoflight.it/worken.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613215026/http://www.thepathoflight.it/worken.php |archivedate=2010-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The practice of giving a sonorous identity to deities, of calling them and sending them back by means of sounds, may well have entered Tibetan Buddhist ritual from Bön tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Helffer (in French)''Traditions musicales dans un monastère du Bouddhisme Tibétain'' in ''L'Homme 171-2'', Paris 2004 pp 183-184&lt;/ref&gt;

He painted the paneled room in a rich and unified palette of brilliant blue-greens with over-[[glaze (painting technique)|glazing]] and metallic [[gold leaf]]. Painted between 1876–77, it now is considered one of the greatest surviving [[Aestheticism|aesthetic]] interiors, and best examples of the [[Anglo-Japanese style]].

==History==
''The Peacock Room'' was originally designed as a dining room in the townhouse located at {{nowrap|49 Prince's Gate}} in the neighbourhood of [[Kensington]] in [[London]], and owned by the British shipping magnate [[Frederick Richards Leyland]].&lt;ref name="brochure"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Merrill |first1=Linda |year=2000 |title=Whistler's Peacock Room |url=http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/online/peacock/images/PeacockRoom.pdf |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |publisher=[[Freer Gallery of Art]] |accessdate=2014-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leyland engaged the British architect [[Richard Norman Shaw]] to remodel and redecorate his home.&lt;ref name="schultz"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schulz |first1=Max F |year=1985 |title=Paradise Preserved: Recreations of Eden in Eighteenth– and Nineteenth– Century England |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-xWNgFtcmAC |location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=306 |isbn=9780521301732 |lccn=85005959 |oclc=11867731 |laysummary=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/description/cam031/85005959.html |accessdate=2014-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw entrusted the remodelling of the dining room to {{nowrap|[[Thomas Jeckyll]]}}, another British architect experienced in the [[Anglo-Japanese style]].&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;&lt;ref name="schultz"/&gt; Jeckyll conceived the dining room as a ''Porsellanzimmer'' (porcelain room).

He covered the walls with 16th-century wall hangings of ''[[Cuir de Cordoue]]'' that had been originally brought to England as part of the dowry of [[Catherine of Aragon]]. They were painted with her heraldic device, the open pomegranate, and a series of red roses, [[Tudor rose]]s, to symbolise her union with [[Henry VIII]]. They had hung on the walls of a [[Tudor architecture|Tudor style house]] in [[Norfolk]] for centuries, before they were bought by Leyland for £1,000.&lt;ref name="peters"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peters |first1=Lisa N |year=1996 |title=James McNeill Whistler |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HewJAAAACAAJ |location=New York City |publisher=Smithmark |page=37 |isbn=9781880908709 |oclc=40598527 |accessdate=2014-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wayne"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peacockroom.wayne.edu/history-london |title=The Story of the Beautiful |last= |first= |author=[[Freer Gallery of Art]] |author2=[[Arthur M.

To the south of the room, a walnut [[welsh dresser]] was placed in the centre, just below the large empty leather panel, and flanked on both sides by the framework shelves. On the east side, three tall windows parted the room overlooking a private park,&lt;ref name="schultz"/&gt; and covered by full-length walnut shutters.&lt;ref name="wayne"/&gt; To the north a fireplace, over which hung the painting by American painter [[James McNeill Whistler]], {{nowrap|''[[Rose and Silver: The Princess from the Land of Porcelain]]''}},&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt; that served as the focal point of the room. The ceiling was constructed in a pendant panelled Tudor-style, and decorated with eight globed pendant gas light fixtures. To finish the room, Jekyll placed a rug with a red border on the floor.&lt;ref name="schultz"/&gt;

Jeckyll had nearly completed his decorative scheme when an illness compelled him to abandon the project. Whistler, who was then working on decorations for the entrance hall of Leyland's house, volunteered to finish Jeckyll's work in the dining room. Concerned that the red roses adorning the leather wall hangings clashed with the colours in ''The Princess'', Whistler suggested retouching the leather with yellow paint, and Leyland agreed to that minor alteration. He also authorised Whistler to embellish the cornice and wainscoting with a "wave pattern" derived from the design in Jeckyll's leaded-glass door, and then went to his home in Liverpool. During Leyland's absence however, Whistler grew bolder with his revisions.

{{quote|Well, you know, I just painted on. I went on ―without design or sketch― it grew as I painted. And toward the end I reached such a point of perfection ―putting in every touch with such freedom― that when I came round to the corner where I started, why, I had to paint part of it over again, as the difference would have been too marked. And the harmony in blue and gold developing, you know, I forgot everything in my joy in it.|[[James McNeill Whistler]]|}}

Upon returning, Leyland was shocked by the "improvements."  Artist and patron quarrelled so violently over the room and the proper compensation for the work that the important relationship for Whistler was terminated. At one point, Whistler gained access to Leyland's home and painted two fighting peacocks meant to represent the artist and his patron, and which he titled {{nowrap|''Art and Money: or, The Story of the Room''}}.&lt;ref name="brochure" /&gt;

Whistler is reported to have said to Leyland, "Ah, I have made you famous. My work will live when you are forgotten. Still, per chance, in the dim ages to come you will be remembered as the proprietor of the Peacock Room."&lt;ref name="peters"/&gt;

The dispute between Whistler and Leyland did not end there. In 1879, Whistler was forced to file for bankruptcy, and Leyland was his chief creditor at the time. When the creditors arrived to inventory the artist's home for liquidation, they were greeted by {{nowrap|''The Gold Scab: Eruption in Frilthy Lucre (The Creditor)''}}, a large painted caricature of Leyland portrayed as an anthropomorphic demonic peacock playing a piano, sitting upon Whistler's house, painted in the same colours featured in the ''Peacock Room''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deyoung.famsf.org/blog/framework-gold-scab-eruption-frilthy-lucre-creditor-james-mcneill-whistler |title=FRAME WORK: The Gold Scab: Eruption in Frilthy Lucre (The Creditor) by James McNeill Whistler |first1=Sarah Bailey |last1=Hogarty |date=2012-05-30 |accessdate=2014-04-30 |publisher=[[de Young (museum)|De Young]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He referenced the incident again in his book, ''[[The Gentle Art of Making Enemies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Whistler |first1=James McNeill |year=1890 |chapter='Noblesse Oblige' |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=jShVMY5NbdsC&amp;pg=PA174 |title=[[The Gentle Art of Making Enemies]] |location=New York City |publisher=Stokes |oclc=181673833 |pages=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to the emotional drama was Whistler's fondness for Leyland's wife, Frances, who separated from her husband in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=Ronald K |last2=Koval  |first2=Anne |title=James McNeill Whistler: Beyond the Myth |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cs1VPwAACAAJ |location=New York City |publisher=[[Carroll &amp; Graf]] |page=209 |isbn=9780786710324 |lccn=95008187 |oclc=249340890 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another result of this drama was Jeckyll who, so shocked by the first sight of ''his'' room, returned home and was later found on the floor of his studio covered in gold leaf; he never recovered and died insane three years later.&lt;ref name="pennell"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elizabeth Robins |first1=Pennell |author-link1=Elizabeth Robins |last2=Pennell |first2=Joseph |author-link2=Joseph Pennell |year=1921 |title=The Whistler Journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-qRAAAAAYAAJ |location=Philadelphia |publisher=J.B.

Having acquired ''The Princess from the Land of Porcelain'', American industrialist and art collector [[Charles Lang Freer]] anonymously purchased the entire room in 1904 from Leyland's heirs, including Leyland's daughter and her husband, the British artist [[Valentine Cameron Prinsep|Val Prinsep]]. Freer then had the contents of the ''Peacock Room'' installed in [[Charles Lang Freer House|his Detroit mansion]]. After Freer's death in 1919, the ''Peacock Room'' was permanently installed in the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] in Washington, D.C. The gallery opened to the public in 1923.&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;

''The Peacock Room'' was closed for renovation, along with other parts of the gallery, in January 2016. It reopened to the public in the summer of 2017.&lt;ref name=renovation&gt;{{cite news |last=BOWLEY |first=GRAHAM |date=10 February 2015 |title=Freer Gallery to Close for Renovations in January

'''Torsti Lehtinen''', [[Finnish people|Finnish]] writer and philosopher,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Torsti+Lehtinen&amp;btnG=#q=Torsti+Lehtinen&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=nws&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=ar:1&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=REA4TtuNLKfViAKA5KTGDg&amp;ved=0CA8QpwUoBQ&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=5907ce0ff923d06f&amp;biw=948&amp;bih=500|title=Vapaus voittaa onnen|last=Wahlstedt|first=Pekka|date=14 July 2009|work=Helsingin Sanomat|language=Finnish|accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Helsinki]] in 1942. He studied philosophy, theology and literature at the [[University of Helsinki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/lehtinen.htm |title=Torsti Lehtinen |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222170101/http://kirjasto.sci.fi/lehtinen.htm |archivedate=22 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959 he made his first trip abroad, to [[Copenhagen]], a city that became and has remained a foreign focal point for him. The years 1979-1982 he lived in [[Stockholm]] before returning to Finland, first to [[Central Finland]] and then, in 1999, to his native Helsinki.

Since his youth he tried his hand in some 40 different professions, the more serious of which were working as a teacher for the socially handicapped for five years and as a software consultant for [[Nokia]] computers for nine years.

In 1982 he published his first [[novel]], ''Kun päättyy Pitkäsilta / Where ends the Longbridge'' (second edition 1992, third 1997). With the publication of his second novel, ''Kuin unta ja varjoa / Like dream and shadow'', in 1983, he became a full-time writer. Since then he has written more than 20 works, including novels, [[aphorism]]s, [[poems]], [[essay]]s, [[play (theatre)|play]]s and non-fiction. He has also edited several books and been a co-writer of around 50 books. Parts of his production have been [[translation|translated]] into [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], German, [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Torsti Lehtinen has also been active as a translator. His translations include the main works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], as well as works from Swedish and English.

Torsti Lehtinen has taught philosophy and creative writing at many Finnish universities and academic institutions, and has held [[seminar]]s and given lectures at, amongst others, the universities of Helsinki, [[University of Tartu|Tartu]] and [[Reykjavík University|Reykjavik]], and the Nordens folkliga akademi in [[Gothenburg]].

He has been awarded several literature prizes, e.g. The WSOY Literature Award, and he won The National Biennial Championships in Essayism in 1995.

Torsti Lehtinen served on the board of the Central Finland Writers’ Association, and, after moving back to Helsinki, was invited to become president of the Helsinki Writers’ Guild in 2003. He also served as vice-president of the [[Finnish Writers’ Association]] (2000–2005) and was created an honorary member of The Central-Finland Writers’ Association in 1995.

His latest novel ''Kainin Merkki'' or ''The Mark of Cain'' was published by Arktinen Banaani in September 2013.&lt;ref name="KAININ MERKKI"&gt;{{cite web|title=KAININ MERKKI|url=http://arktinenbanaani.fi/tuote/torsti_lehtinen/kainin_merkki/9789522701251|accessdate=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Toy drive''' is a charity event that collects toys or money for them to be distributed to poor children.

==Overview==
This is usually for the celebration of [[Christmas]]. Volunteers are brought together to sort through toys to wrap and sort for age appropriateness. Appeals are made in shopping centers, schools, and other places for the public to purchase toys and to meet certain goals. Many charities or organizations will orchestrate a seasonal effort on top of their usual practices. Many police departments, fire departments, and military groups are involved in these efforts. One of the most important and famous toy drives is [[Toys For Tots]] which is operated by the [[United States Marine Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=51PC6-670MkC&amp;pg=PT164&amp;dq=%22toy+drive%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4TAPT7qvLaHjiAKk7pDUDQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ 365 ways to raise funds for your nonprofit], April.

[[File:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|Unfinished sketch of Søren Kierkegaard by Niels Christian Kierkegaard, c. 1840]]
'''''Two Minor Ethical-Religious Essays''''' (original [[Danish language|Danish]] title: ''Tvende ethisk-religieuse Smaa-Afhandlinger'') is a work by the [[Denmark|Danish]] philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], under the [[pseudonym]] H.H., written in 1847 and published on May 19, 1849.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kierkegaard.com/chrono.html SK Chronology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217210337/http://kierkegaard.com/chrono.html |date=2015-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://sorenkierkegaard.org/two-minor-ethical-religious-essays.html Kierkegaard, D. Anthony Storm's Commentary on - Two Minor Ethical-Religious Essays]&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard wrote a book entitled ''[[A Cycle of Ethical-Religious Essays]]'' but chose to publish these two essays as a separate piece while leaving the rest unpublished. The unpublished work would eventually become ''[[The Book on Adler]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sorenkierkegaard.org/book-on-adler.html Kierkegaard, D. Anthony Storm's Commentary on - The Book On Adler]&lt;/ref&gt;  The work is in dual authorship with his signed work ''[[Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits]]'', also completed in 1847.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://sorenkierkegaard.org/kierkegaard-authorial-method.html Kierkegaard, D. Anthony Storm's Commentary on - Kierkegaard's Authorial Method]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pseudonym==
Kierkegaard, known for his frequent use of pseudonyms, would publish only overtly religious works under his own name, but published his philosophical works under pseudonyms.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Each name cultivates a different personality reflective of the overarching meaning of the work. H.H. was the first of two religious pseudonyms, the first being Anti-Climacus, the author of ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'' and ''[[Practice in Christianity]]''. While both are religious, H.H. is less  intellectually and philosophically engaged than Anti-Climacus. H.H. is also not an idealized representation of Christianity despite writing authoritatively.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://deandettloff.wordpress.com/2013/08/02/introducing-kierkegaard-pt-v-major-works-and-pseudonyms-2-the-remainder-of-the-authorship/ Introducing Kierkegaard Pt. V: Major Works and Pseudonyms 2: The Remainder of the Authorship | Re(-)petitions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==First essay==
The first essay is entitled ''Has a Man the Right to Let Himself Be Put to Death for the Truth?'' The essay outlines the idea and practice of martyrdom in Christianity and whether or not the martyr has the right to die for truth. The work would parallel both his relationship to [[Regine Olsen]] and the image of the crucified Christ. 

His conclusion was that humans should not die for truth but instead be lovingly concerned for others. This problem would be later addressed in his essay ''Armed Neutrality'', which is signed under his own name.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Second essay==
The second essay is entitled ''The Difference Between a Genius and an Apostle''. The work focuses on the issue of those who are associated with the Absolute and those who are naturally intelligent or gifted. Although both types of men are similar, the apostle speaks with authority, whereas the genius does not. Kierkegaard regarded it as thoughtless to call [[St. Paul]] a genius if he was divinely inspired, since he spoke with authority.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

{{quote|A genius and an apostle are qualitatively different. All thought breathes in immanence, whereas faith and the paradox are a qualitative sphere unto themselves. Genius is immediateness. Genius is born. An apostle is not born: an apostle is a man called and appointed by God, receiving a mission from him. Authority is the decisive quality.}}

A '''tyrant''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|τύραννος}}, ''tyrannos''), in the modern English usage of the word, is an [[absolute ruler]] unrestrained by law or person, or one who has usurped legitimate sovereignty. Often described as a cruel character, a tyrant defends their position by [[oppressive]] means, tending to control almost everything in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Tyrant |volume=27 |page=548}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0001.238|title=Tyrant|website= The Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert Collaborative Translation Project.

Paris, 1765)|accessdate= 1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Greek term, however, merely meant an authoritarian sovereign without reference to character,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tyrant |title=Tyrant (entry) |website=Merriam-Webster online dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; bearing no [[pejorative]] connotation during the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and early [[Classical Greece|Classical]] periods. However, it was clearly a negative word to [[Plato]], a Greek  philosopher, and on account of the decisive influence of philosophy on politics, its negative connotations only increased, continuing into the [[Hellenistic period]].

[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] define a tyrant as a person who rules without law, using extreme and cruel methods against both their own people and others.&lt;ref&gt;Glad, B.

However, in the late fifth and fourth centuries BC, a new kind of tyrant, the military dictator, arose, specifically in [[Sicily]].

Accusations of tyranny can be applied to a variety of types of government – by an individual (in an autocracy), by a minority (in an oligarchy, [[tyranny of the minority]]) or by a majority (in a democracy, [[tyranny of the majority]]).  The definition is extended to other oppressive leadership and to oppressive policies.  For example, a teacher may find the school administration, the textbook or standardized tests to be oppressive, considering each to represent a tyranny.

==Etymology==
The English noun ''[[:wikt:tyrant|tyrant]]'' appears in [[Middle English]] use, via [[Old French]], from the 1290s.
The word derives from [[Latin]] ''tyrannus'', meaning "illegitimate ruler", and this in turn from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|τύραννος}} ''tyrannos'' "monarch, ruler of a [[polis]]"; ''tyrannos'' in its turn has a [[Pre-Greek]] origin, perhaps from [[Lydian language|Lydian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tyrant|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, pp. 1519–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The final ''-t'' arises in Old French by association with the present participles in ''-ant''.&lt;ref&gt;''tyrant'', ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd edition&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

"The word 'tyranny' is used with many meanings, not only by the Greeks, but throughout the tradition of the great books."&lt;ref name=Adler/&gt;  The Oxford English Dictionary offers alternative definitions: a ruler, an illegitimate ruler (a usurper), an absolute ruler (despot) or an oppressive, unjust or cruel ruler.  The term is usually applied to vicious dictators who achieve bad results for the governed.  The definition of a tyrant is cursed by subjectivity.  Oppression, injustice and cruelty do not have standardized measurements or thresholds.

The Greeks defined both usurpers '''and''' those inheriting rule from usurpers as tyrants.

Old words are defined by their historical usage.  It is difficult to determine which characteristics of tyrants were defining rather than descriptive.  Biblical quotations do not use the word tyrant, but express opinions very similar to those of the Greek philosophers, citing the wickedness, cruelty and injustice of rulers.

* "Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked ruler over a poor people.  A ruler who lacks understanding is a cruel oppressor; but one who hates unjust gain will enjoy a long life." Proverbs 28:15–16
* "By justice a king gives stability to the land, but one who makes heavy extractions ruins it." Proverbs 29:4

The Greek philosophers stressed the (subjective) quality of rule rather than legitimacy or absolutism.  "Both Plato and Aristotle speak of the king as a good monarch and the tyrant as a bad one.  Both say that monarchy, or rule by a single man, is royal when it is for the welfare of the ruled and tyrannical when it serves only the interest of the ruler.  Both make lawlessness – either a violation of existing laws or government by personal fiat without settled laws – a mark of tyranny."&lt;ref name=Adler/&gt;

Enlightenment philosophers seemed to define tyranny by its associated characteristics.

* "The sovereign is called a tyrant who knows no laws but his caprice." Voltaire in a Philosophical Dictionary
* "Where Law ends Tyranny begins." Locke in Two Treatises of Government

The definition is dependent on perspective.  A historical example is George III of England.  From the British perspective he was a legitimate constitutional monarch.  From the colonial perspective he was a tyrant based on a list of grievances enumerated in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].  Colonists were not represented in parliament, so they lacked the rights of the English.  Economic exploitation of the colonies was reasonable (perhaps even popular) from the British perspective, tyranny to the Yankees.

Bad results are also relative. Authoritarian rule might be beneficial (like with [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] of [[Turkey]]) or of limited lasting harm to the country ( like with [[Francisco Franco]] of [[Spain]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chirot | first = Daniel | title = Modern tyrants : the power and prevalence of evil in our age | publisher = Free Press Maxwell Macmillan Canada Maxwell Macmillan International | location = New York Toronto New York | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780029054772 | pages=169, 418–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those who list or rank tyrants can provide definitions and criteria for comparison or acknowledge subjectivity.  Comparative criteria may include checklists or body counts.  Accounting for deaths in war is problematic – war can build empires or defend the populace – it also keeps winning tyrants in power.  "Ch'in Shih-huang is the first emperor of China. He united seven separate kingdoms into a single nation. He built the Great Wall and was buried with the terra-cotta soldiers. The Chinese have mixed feelings about him. They're proud of the nation he created, but he was a maniacal tyrant."  [[Gene Luen Yang]]  Oppressive dictators have held states together ([[Alexander the Great]], [[Josip Broz Tito]]).

A modern tyrant might be objectively defined by proven violation of international criminal law such as [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Early history ==

The state is the product of civilization.  Agriculture allowed greater concentrations of people which lead to more conflict.  Political and military leaders arose to manage conflicts.  All leaders were once dictators.&lt;ref name="Wallechinsky 2006 2"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wallechinsky | first = David | title = Tyrants : the world's 20 worst living dictators | publisher = Regan | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0060590048 | page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "[T]he very essence of politics in [agrarian civilizations] was, by our contemporary democratic standards, tyrannical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chirot | first = Daniel | title = Modern tyrants : the power and prevalence of evil in our age | publisher = Free Press Maxwell Macmillan Canada Maxwell Macmillan International | location = New York Toronto New York | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780029054772 | page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually alternative forms and methods of government arose which allowed belated definitions and criticism.

== Historical forms ==
[[File:Tiranicidas 04.JPG|thumb|A [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton (sculpture)|sculptural pairing]] of [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton]].  They became known as the [[tyrannicides]] after they killed [[Hipparchus (son of Peisistratos)|Hipparchus]], and were the preeminent symbol of [[Athenian democracy]]]]

History has labeled a set of ancient [[List of ancient Greek tyrants|Greek]] and [[List of tyrants of Syracuse|Sicilian]] leaders as tyrants.  History remembers the rulers, their rises, methods, and ends and the environment in which they ruled.  Ancient political commentators Plato and Aristotle lived late in the period of many tyrants.  They had monarchies and democracies for comparison.  The historical definition is best understood from their historical perspective.

In [[ancient Greece]], tyrants were influential opportunists that came to power by securing the support of different factions of a [[deme]]. The word ''tyrannos'', possibly pre-Greek, [[Pelasgian]] or eastern in origin,&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, George "Greece, the history of the Archaic period" in [[John Boardman (art historian)|Boardman, John]] ''et al.'' (1986), ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (OUP)&lt;/ref&gt; then carried no ethical censure; it simply referred to anyone, good or bad, who obtained executive power in a [[polis]] by unconventional means. Support for the tyrants came from the growing middle class and from the peasants who had no land or were in debt to the wealthy landowners. It is true that they had no legal right to rule, but the people preferred them over kings or the [[aristocracy]].

The Greek tyrants stayed in power by using mercenary soldiers from outside of their respective city-state. To mock tyranny, [[Thales]] wrote that the strangest thing to see is ''"an aged tyrant"'' meaning that tyrants do not have the public support to survive for long.

===Aesymnetes===
An [[aesymnetes]] (pl. aesymnetai) had similar scope of power to the tyrant, such as [[Pittacus|Pittacus of Mytilene]] (c. 640–568 BC), and was elected for life or for a specified period by a city-state in a time of crisis – the only difference being that the aesymnetes was a constitutional office and were comparable to the [[Roman dictator]]. Magistrates in some city-states were also called aesymnetai.

===Populism===
Greek tyranny grew out of the struggle of the under classes against the [[aristocracy]], or against priest-kings where archaic traditions and mythology sanctioned hereditary and/or traditional rights to rule. Popular [[coup]]s generally installed tyrants, who often became or remained popular rulers, at least in the early part of their reigns. For instance, the popular imagination remembered [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratus]] for an episode – related by (pseudonymous) [[Aristotle]], but possibly fictional – in which he exempted a farmer from taxation because of the particular barrenness of his plot.

Peisistratus' sons [[Hippias (son of Peisistratus)|Hippias]] and [[Hipparchus (son of Pisistratus)|Hipparchus]], on the other hand, were not such able rulers, and when the disaffected aristocrats [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton|Harmodios and Aristogeiton]] slew Hipparchus, Hippias' rule quickly became oppressive, resulting in the expulsion of the Peisistratids in 510 BC, who resided henceforth in Persepolis as clients of the Persian Shahanshah (King of kings).

===Archaic tyrants=== 
One of the earliest known uses of the word tyrant (in Greek) was by the poet [[Archilochus]], who lived three centuries before Plato, in reference to king [[Gyges of Lydia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor-last = Roberts | editor-first = J. W. |title= tyranny | encyclopedia = The Oxford dictionary of the classical world | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-19-280146-3 }}  Based on Herodotus, The History 1.7-14&lt;/ref&gt;  The king's assumption of power was unconventional.

The heyday of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] tyrants came in the early 6th century BC, when [[Cleisthenes of Sicyon|Cleisthenes]] ruled [[Sicyon]] in the [[Peloponnesus]] and [[Polycrates]] ruled [[Samos Island|Samos]]. During this time, revolts overthrew many governments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Langer | editor-first = William L. | title = An Encyclopedia of World History | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | location = Boston | year = 1948 |p=48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] world. [[Chilon]], the ambitious and capable [[ephor]] of [[Sparta]], built a strong alliance amongst neighbouring states by making common cause with these groups seeking to oppose unpopular tyrannical rule.  By intervening against the tyrants of Sicyon, Corinth and Athens, Sparta thus came to assume Hellenic leadership prior to the Persian invasions.  Simultaneously [[Persian Empire|Persia]] first started making inroads into Greece, and many tyrants sought Persian help against popular forces seeking to remove them.

==== Corinth ====

Corinth hosted one of the earliest of Greek tyrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Freeman | first = Charles | title = The Greek achievement : the foundation of the Western world | publisher = Viking | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0670-885152 |pp=72–73, 99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], growing wealth from colonial enterprises, and the wider horizons brought about by the export of wine and oil, together with the new experiences of the Eastern Mediterranean brought back by returning [[mercenaries|mercenary]] [[hoplites]] employed overseas created a new environment. Conditions were right for  [[Cypselus]] to overthrow the [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] power of the dominant but unpopular clan of [[Bacchiadae]]. Clan members were killed, executed, driven out or exiled in 657 BC.  Corinth prospered economically under his rule, and Cypselus managed to rule without a [[bodyguard]]. When he then bequeathed his position to his son, [[Periander]], the tyranny proved less secure, and Periander required a retinue of mercenary soldiers personally loyal to him.

Nevertheless, under Cypselus and Periander, Corinth extended and tightened her control over her colonial enterprises, and exports of Corinthian pottery flourished.  However, tyrants seldom succeeded in establishing an untroubled line of succession. Periander threw his pregnant wife downstairs (killing her), burnt his concubines alive, exiled his son, warred with his father-in-law and attempted to castrate 300 sons of his perceived enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Durant | first = Will | title = The Life of Greece | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York | year = 1939 | pages= 90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He retained his position.  Periander's successor was less fortunate and was expelled. Afterward, Corinth was ruled by a lackluster oligarchy, and was eventually eclipsed by the rising fortunes of Athens and Sparta.

==== Athens ====

Athens hosted its tyrants late in the Archaic period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Langer | editor-first = William L. | title = An Encyclopedia of World History | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | location = Boston | year = 1948 | pp=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Athens]], the inhabitants first gave the title of tyrant to [[Peisistratos]] (a relative of [[Solon]], the Athenian lawgiver) who succeeded in 546 BC, after two failed attempts, to install himself as tyrant.  Supported by the prosperity of the peasantry and landowning interests of the plain, which was prospering from the rise of olive oil exports, as well as his clients from [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]], he managed to achieve authoritarian power.  Through an ambitious program of public works, which included fostering the state cult of [[Athena]]; encouraging the creation of festivals; supporting the [[Panathenaic Games]] in which prizes were jars of olive oil; and supporting the [[Dionysia]] (ultimately leading to the development of Athenian drama), Peisistratus managed to maintain his personal popularity.

He was followed by his sons, and with the subsequent growth of Athenian [[democracy]], the title "tyrant" took on its familiar negative connotations. The murder of Peisistratus' son, the tyrant [[Hipparchus (son of Peisistratos)|Hipparchus]] by [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton|Aristogeiton and Harmodios]] in Athens in 514 BC marked the beginning of the so-called "cult of the [[tyrannicide]]s" (i.e., of killers of tyrants). Contempt for tyranny characterised this [[Greek hero cult|cult movement]]. Despite financial help from Persia, in 510 the Peisistratids were expelled by a combination of intrigue, exile and Spartan arms.  The anti-tyrannical attitude became especially prevalent in Athens after 508 BC, when [[Cleisthenes]] reformed the political system so that it resembled ''[[demokratia]]'' (ancient participant democracy as opposed to the modern representative democracy).  Hippias (Peisistratus' other son) offered to rule the Greeks on behalf of the Persians and provided military advice to the Persians against the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Durant | first = Will | title = The Life of Greece | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York | year = 1939 | page= 235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Thirty Tyrants]] whom the Spartans imposed on a defeated Attica in 404 BC would not be classified as tyrants in the usual sense and were in effect an [[oligarchy]].

===Sicilian tyrants===
The best known Sicilian tyrants appeared long after the Archaic period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Langer | editor-first = William L. | title = An Encyclopedia of World History | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | location = Boston | year = 1948 | pp=57, 66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tyrannies of Sicily came about due to similar causes, but here the threat of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] attack prolonged tyranny, facilitating the rise of military leaders with the people united behind them. Such Sicilian tyrants as [[Gelo]], [[Hiero I]], [[Hiero II]], [[Dionysius the Elder]], [[Dionysius the Younger]], and [[Agathocles]] maintained lavish courts and became patrons of culture. The dangers threatening the lives of the Sicilian tyrants are highlighted in the morale tale of the "[[Sword of Damocles]]".

===Later tyrants===
Under the [[Macedon]]ian [[hegemony]] in the 4th and 3rd century BC a new generation of tyrants rose in Greece, especially under the rule of king [[Antigonus II Gonatas]], who installed his puppets in many cities of the Peloponnese. Examples were [[Cleon of Sicyon]], [[Aristodemus the Good|Aristodemus of Megalopolis]], [[Aristomachos the Elder|Aristomachus I of Argos]], [[Abantidas|Abantidas of Sicyon]], [[Aristippus of Argos]], [[Lydiadas of Megalopolis]], [[Aristomachos of Argos|Aristomachus II of Argos]],  and [[Xenon (tyrant)|Xenon of Hermione]].

Against these rulers, in 280 BC the democratic cities started to join forces in the [[Achaean League]] which was able to expand its influence even into [[Corinthia]], [[Megaris]], [[Argolis]] and [[Arcadia]]. From 251 BC under the leadership of [[Aratus of Sicyon]], the Achaeans liberated many cities, in several cases by convincing the tyrants to step down, and when Aratus died in 213 BC, Hellas had been free of tyrants for more than 15 years. The last tyrant on the Greek mainland, [[Nabis|Nabis of Sparta]], was assassinated in 192 BC and after his death the Peloponnese was united as a confederation of stable democracies in the Achaean League.

===Roman tyrants===
Roman historians like [[Suetonius]], [[Tacitus]], [[Plutarch]], and [[Josephus]] often spoke of "tyranny" in opposition to "liberty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beard | first = Mary | title = SPQR - A History of Ancient Rome  | publisher = Liveright | location = New York | year = 2015 | pages= 393, 421–428 | isbn = 978-0-87140-423-7}}Beard says that most accounts of the period were written from the senatorial perspective (described at length).  Tacitus was mentioned by Beard in this context, perhaps because he was a senator (the others were aristocrats of a lower rank).  The senate discussed a return to the liberty of the republic almost 70 years into the empire (based on Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Book XIX, Chapter II).  Adler cites Tacitus and Plutarch on liberty.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tyranny was associated with imperial rule and those rulers who usurped too much authority from the [[Roman Senate]].  Those who were advocates of "liberty" tended to be pro-Republic and pro-Senate.  For instance, regarding [[Julius Caesar]] and his assassins, Suetonius wrote:
{{quote|Therefore the plots which had previously been formed separately, often by groups of two or three, were united in a general conspiracy, since even the populace no longer were pleased with present conditions, but both secretly and openly rebelled at his tyranny and cried out for defenders of their liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Julius Caesar 80&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Citizens of the empire were circumspect in identifying tyrants.  "...[[Cicero]]'s head and hands [were] cut off and nailed to the rostrum of the Senate to remind everyone of the perils of speaking out against tyranny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ryan | first = Alan | title = On politics : a history of political thought from Herodotus to the present | publisher = Liveright Pub. Corp | location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-0-87140-465-7 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There has since been a tendency to discuss tyranny in the abstract while limiting examples of tyrants to ancient Greek rulers.  Philosophers have been more expressive than historians.

Josephus identified tyrants in Biblical history (in Antiquities of the Jews) including [[Nimrod]], [[Moses]], the [[Maccabees]] and [[Herod the Great]].  He also identified some later tyrants.

== In the classics ==

Tyranny is considered an important subject, one of the "Great Ideas" of Western thought.  The classics contain many references to tyranny and its causes, effects, methods, practitioners, alternatives...  They consider tyranny from historical, religious, ethical, political and fictional perspectives.  "If any point in political theory is indisputable, it would seem to be that tyranny is the worst corruption of government - a vicious misuse of power and a violent abuse of human beings who are subject to it."&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Adler | editor-first = Mortimer J. | title = Great Books of the Western World | publisher =  Encyclopedia Britannica | location = Chicago | volume = 3: The Great Ideas: II | chapter = 95: Tyranny | year = 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While this may represent a consensus position among the classics, it is not unanimous - Hobbes (for example) dissented, claiming no objective distinction (vicious vs virtuous) existed among dictators.  "They that are discontented under monarchy, call it tyranny; and they that are displeased with aristocracy, call it oligarchy: so also, they which find themselves grieved under a democracy, call it anarchy..." (in Leviathan)

Dante mentioned tyrants ("who laid hold on blood and plunder") in the seventh level of Hell (Divine Comedy) where they are submerged in boiling blood. These included [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Attila]] the Hun who shared the region with highway robbers.

[[Niccolò Machiavelli]] conflates all rule by a single person (whom he generally refers to as a "prince") with "tyranny," regardless of the legitimacy of that rule, in his ''[[Discourses on Livy]]''. He also identifies liberty with [[republic]]an regimes; whether he would include so-called "[[crowned republic]]s" (such as modern [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]]) is somewhat unclear from the text.

[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], as well as the [[Roman Republic]]ans, became generally quite wary of many people seeking to implement a popular coup. [[Shakespeare]] portrays the struggle of one such anti-tyrannical Roman, [[Marcus Junius Brutus]], in his play ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''.

In Gibbons' Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Volume I, Chapter III, Augustus was shown to assume the power of a tyrant while sharing power with the reformed senate.  "After a decent resistance, the crafty tyrant submitted to the orders of the senate; and consented to receive the government of the provinces, and the general command of the Roman armies..."  Emperors "humbly professed themselves the accountable ministers of the senate, whose supreme decrees they dictated and obeyed."  The Roman Empire "may be defined as an absolute monarchy disguised by the forms of a commonwealth."  Roman emperors were deified.  Gibbons called emperors tyrants and their rule tyranny.  His definitions in the chapter were related to the absolutism of power alone - not oppression, injustice or cruelty.  He ignored the appearance of shared rule.

== Enlightenment ==
[[File:Le peuple français demandant la destitution du tyran 10 août 1792-François Gérard-IMG 2351.JPG|thumb|[[François Gérard]], ''The French people demanding destitution of the Tyran on [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August 1792]]'']]

In the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], thinkers applied the word tyranny to the system of governance that had developed around [[aristocracy]] and [[monarchy]]. Specifically, [[John Locke]] as part of his argument against the "[[Divine Right of Kings]]" in his book ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' defines it this way: "Tyranny is the exercise of power beyond right, which nobody can have a right to; and this is making use of the power any one has in his hands, not for the good of those who are under it, but for his own private, separate advantage."&lt;ref&gt;[[Two Treatises of Government]] (199)&lt;/ref&gt; Locke's concept of tyranny influenced the writers of subsequent generations who developed the concept of tyranny as counterpoint to ideas of [[human rights]] and [[democracy]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] referred to the tyranny of [[King George III of Great Britain]] in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], and the concept was refined in turn to refer to the [[Kings of France]], the tyrants of [[Reign of Terror|the Terror]], and to [[Napoleon I]] in turn during the [[French Revolution]] and subsequent regimes.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Methods of obtaining and retaining power ==

The path of a tyrant can appear easy and pleasant (for all but the aristocracy).  A twentieth-century historian said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Hence the road to power in Greece commercial cities was simple: to attack the aristocracy, defend the poor, and come to an understanding with the middle classes.  Arrived at power, the dictator abolished debts, or confiscated large estates, taxed the rich to finance public works, or otherwise redistributed the overconcentrated wealth; and while attaching the masses to himself through such measures, he secured the support of the business community by promoting trade with state coinage and commercial treaties, and by raising the social prestige of the bourgeoisie.  Forced to depend upon popularity instead of hereditary power, the dictatorships for the most part kept out of war, supported religion, maintained order, promoted morality, favored the higher status of women, encouraged the arts, and lavished revenues upon the beautification of their cities.  And they did all these things, in many cases, while preserving the forms of popular government, so that even under despotism the people learned the ways of liberty.  When the dictatorship [of the tyrant] had served to destroy the aristocracy the people destroyed the dictatorship; and only a few changes were needed to make democracy of freemen a reality as well as a form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Durant | first = Will | title = The Life of Greece | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York | year = 1939 | pages= 122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Ancient Greek philosophers (who were aristocrats) were far more critical in reporting the methods of tyrants.  The justification for ousting a tyrant was absent from the historian's description but was central to the philosophers.

"The people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse into greatness.... This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he first appears he is a protector." Plato in The Republic

Dictators inherit the position, rise as company men in the military/party or seize power as entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="Wallechinsky 2006 7"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wallechinsky | first = David | title = Tyrants : the world's 20 worst living dictators | publisher = Regan | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0060590048 | page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early texts called only the entrepreneurs tyrants, distinguishing them from "bad kings".  Such tyrants may act as renters, rather than owners, of the state.

The political methods of obtaining power were occasionally supplemented by theater or force.  Peisistratus of Athens blamed self-inflicted wounds on enemies to justify a bodyguard which he used to seize power.  He later appeared with a woman dressed as a goddess to suggest divine sanction of his rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lane | first = Melissa S. | title = The birth of politics : eight Greek and Roman political ideas and why they matter | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-0-691-16647-6 |pages= 77–78 }}  Based on Herodotus, The History 1.59-60&lt;/ref&gt;  The third time he used mercenaries to seize and retain power.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, The History 1.61-64&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retaining ===

Lengthy recommendations of methods were made to tyrants by Aristotle (in Politics for example) and [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] (in The Prince).&lt;ref name=Adler/&gt;  These are, in general, force and fraud.  They include hiring bodyguards, stirring up wars to smother dissent, purges, assassinations, unwarranted searches and seizures...  Aristotle suggested an alternative means of retaining power - ruling justly.

The methods of tyrants to retain power have changed little in over two thousand years.

They placate world opinion by staging rigged elections.&lt;ref name="Wallechinsky 2006 2"/&gt;
 
They use or threaten violence.&lt;ref name="Wallechinsky 2006 7"/&gt;

They seek popular support by appeals to patriotism and claims that conditions have improved.&lt;ref name="Wallechinsky 2006 7"/&gt;

"The tyrant binds his followers to him by making them accomplices to his crimes." Anonymous&lt;ref name="Frank 1999 889"&gt;{{cite book | last = Frank | first = Leonard | title = Random House Webster's quotationary | publisher = Random House | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780679448501 | page = 889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The tyrant confuses those he can't convince, corrupts those he can't confuse, and crushes those he can't corrupt." Anonymous&lt;ref name="Frank 1999 889"/&gt;

== Psychology of tyrants ==

The classics note that tyrants are often unhappy.&lt;ref name=Adler/&gt; "In every tyrant's heart there springs in the end this poison, that he cannot trust a friend." (Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound). Tyrants appear to suffer psychological pathologies that result in self-destructive behavior. "His grandiosity and his skills in deception, manipulation, and intimidation are an advantage to him in securing power. But as he moves toward absolute power, he is also apt to cross moral and geographic boundaries in ways that place him in a vulnerable position. Thus, he may engage in cruelties that serve no political purpose, challenge the conventional morality in ways that undermine his base, engage in faulty reality testing, and overreach himself in foreign engagements in ways that invite new challenges to his rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pathologies are not evident earlier in life although those without a certain level of brutal self-assurance do not become dictators. The ruled also exhibit pathologies.

'''Václav Benda''' (August 8, 1946, [[Prague]] – June 2, 1999) was a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Roman Catholic]] activist and intellectual, and mathematician. Under Communist rule in [[Czechoslovakia]], Benda was rare in being a believing Christian while also a senior member of the anti-communist dissident organization [[Charter 77]]. After the [[Velvet Revolution]], Benda became the head of an organization charged with investigating the former Communist secret police and their informants.

Benda's idea of a Parallel Polis influenced the thought of other Dissidents like [[Vaclav Havel]] and has been spread in recent years by American Conservative writer [[Rod Dreher]]. The first English anthology of Benda's essays was published by [[St. Augustine's Press]] in 2017.

==Life==
The son of a lawyer, Benda studied a doctorate of Philosophy at [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]], and was also president of the Students' Academic Council.&lt;ref name="guardianobit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bourdeaux|first1=Michael|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/jun/23/guardianobituaries2|title=Vaclav Benda|accessdate=8 October 2015|agency=The Guardian|date=22 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; His academic career ended when he refused to join the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist Party]] in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Benda was active in the dissident movement against the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], and in 1977 became a signatory to [[Charter 77]].&lt;ref name="guardianobit"/&gt; As a result of his political activities he experienced harassment from the government and economic exclusion, being forced to work for brief periods in a large number of different jobs.&lt;ref name="guardianobit"/&gt;

In 1977, he also wrote a short ''[[samizdat]]'' essay called "[[Parallel Polis]]" ({{lang-cs|paralelní polis}}), calling for his fellow dissidents to abandon hope that the repressive social, economic and political institutions in [[Czechoslovakia]] could be changed by protest.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Vaclav-Benda|title=Vaclav Benda|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Benda called for new "parallel institutions" to be created, which would be more responsive to human needs and may someday replace the existing corrupt institutions. He argued that as the communist state would drain any efforts at reform, it was better to start new ones than expend energy fighting old ones. The essay was translated into English in 1978.

Benda's role as a spokesman for Charter 77 resulted in him being arrested in May 1979 and charged with subverting the state, for which he was imprisoned until 1983.&lt;ref name="guardianobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; After his release he resumed his role as spokesman.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; He was also a founder-member of the [[Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted]] (VONS).&lt;ref name="guardianobit"/&gt; While Benda was imprisoned with [[Vaclav Havel]] in [[Ostrava]], they co-wrote a text for the [[Moscow Helsinki Group]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="guardianobit"/&gt;

A devout Roman  Catholic, Benda joined the [[Christian Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Christian Democratic Party]] in 1989, becoming chairman in 1990. The party later merged with the [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]]. Benda's politics were distinct from his former dissident colleagues, and he became an increasingly isolated figure in Czech politics. He was a supporter of former [[Chile]]an dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]], a position which was unpopular in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="guardianobit"/&gt;

From June 25 to December 31, 1992, Benda was Chairman of the Chamber of the Nations.

From 1991 to 1998, Benda served as head of the Bureau for Investigating the Crimes of [[Communist Party]] officials.&lt;ref name="guardianobit"/&gt;

In 1996, he was elected to the [[Senate of the Czech Republic|Czech Senate]] for the Prague 1 district, and held the seat until his death in 1999.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Benda's ideas about a Parallel Polis were later revived by a group of scholars at the [[University of Washington]], and a four-story building called Parallel polis has opened in Prague, housing a bitcoin-only cafe, co-working space, makers lab, and "Institute of cryptoanarchy" in [[Holešovice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/parallel-polis-worlds-first-bitcoin-only-cafe-launches-prague-1472850|title=World's First #Bitcoin Only Café Launches in Prague @Paralelni_polis #hackers|last=Cuthbertson|first=Anthony|date=2014-11-03|newspaper=International Business Times UK|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.paralelnipolis.cz/o-nas/en/|title=Paralelni Polis - Paralelní Polis - Paralelní Polis|last=Ševčík|first=Pavel|website=www.paralelnipolis.cz|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2017 book ''[[The Benedict Option]]'', author [[Rod Dreher]] praised the ideas expressed in Benda's essays and recommended them to American Christians as an example of how to preserve and live their faith in a culture increasingly hostile to it.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/my-night-at-vaclav-benda/ "My Night at Vaclav Benda's"] by Rod Dreher.

'''White Plum Asanga''', sometimes termed '''White Plum Sangha''', is a [[Zen]] school in the Hakuyu Taizan Maezumi lineage,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whiteplum.org/ White Plum Asanga website]&lt;/ref&gt; created by [[Hakuyu Taizan Maezumi]].&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, 174&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of Maezumi's [[Dharma heirs]] and subsequent successors and students.&lt;ref&gt;Maezumi, 171&lt;/ref&gt; A diverse organization spread across the United States and with a small presence in Europe, the White Plum Asanga 
{{quote|[I]ncludes teachers who represent the spectrum of styles to be found to American Zen—socially [[engaged Buddhism]], family practice, Zen and the arts, secularized Zen, and progressive traditionalism."&lt;ref name="westward"&gt;Westward Dharma, 111&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Conceived of informally in 1979 by Maezumi and [[Tetsugen Bernard Glassman]], the White Plum Asanga was named after Maezumi's father Baian Hakujun Dai-osho and then later incorporated in 1995 following Maezumi's death. [[Tetsugen Bernard Glassman]] was the White Plum Asanga's first President and his successor was [[Dennis Genpo Merzel]].&lt;ref&gt;Luminous Passage, 282&lt;/ref&gt; Following Merzel's term, in May 2007, [[Gerry Shishin Wick]] served as elected President of White Plum, until 2013 when Anne Seisen Saunders became the current president.&lt;ref&gt; "Roshi Anne Seisen Saunders voted in as the new President of the White Plum Asanga".
