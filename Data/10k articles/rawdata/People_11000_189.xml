The [[Albanian diaspora]] was formed during the course of the late [[Middle Ages]] and [[early modern Europe|early modern]] period.

Since many served under Greek commanders and served together with Greek stradioti, the process continued. Another factor in this assimilative process was the stradioti's and their families' active involvement and affiliation with the Greek Orthodox or Uniate Church communities in Naples, Venice and elsewhere.

"Možemo reći da svi na neki način pripadamo nekoj vrsti etničke kategorije, a često i više nego jednoj. Kao primjer navodim slučaj zadarskih Arbanasa. Da bismo shvatili Arbanase i problem njihova etnojezičnog (etničkog i jezičnog) identiteta, potrebno je ići u povijest njihova doseljenja koje seže u početak 18. st., tj. točnije: razdoblje od prve seobe 1726., razdoblje druge seobe od 1733., pa sve do 1754. godine koja se smatra završnom godinom njihova doseljenja. Svi su se doselili iz tri sela s područja Skadarskog jezera – Briske, Šestana i Livara. Bježeći od Turaka, kuge i ostalih nevolja, generalni providur Nicola Erizzo II dozvolio im je da se nasele u područje današnjih Arbanasa i Zemunika. Jedan dio stanovništva u Zemuniku se asimilirao s ondašnjim stanovništvom zaboravivši svoj jezik. To su npr. današnji Prenđe, Šestani, Ćurkovići, Paleke itd. Drugi dio stanovništva je nastojao zadržati svoj etnički i jezični identitet tijekom ovih 280 godina. Dana 10. svibnja 2006. godine obilježena je 280. obljetnica njihova dolaska u predgrađe grada Zadra. Nije bilo lako, osobito u samom početku, jer nisu imali svoju crkvu, škole itd., pa je jedini način održavanja njihova identiteta i jezika bio usmenim putem. We can say that all in some way belong to a kind of ethnic category, and often more than one. As an example, I cite the case of Zadar Arbanasi. To understand the problem of the Albanians and their ethnolinguistic (ethnic and linguistic) identity, it is necessary to go into the history of their immigration that goes back to the beginning of the 18th century., etc more precisely: the period from the first migration of 1726, the period of the second migration of 1733, and until 1754, which is considered to be the final year of their immigration. All they moved from three villages from the area of Lake Scutari – Briska, Šestan and Livara. Fleeing from the Ottomans, plague and other troubles, the general provider Nicola Erizzo II allowed them to settle in the area of today's Arbanasa and Zemunik. One part of the population in Zemunik became assimilated with the local population, forgetting their language. These are for example, today's Prenda, Šestani, Ćurkovići, Paleke etc. The second part of the population tried to maintain their ethnic and linguistic identity during these 280 years. On May 10, 2006 marked the 280th anniversary of their arrival in the suburb of Zadar. It was not easy, especially in the beginning, because they did not have their own church, school, etc., and is the only way to maintain their identity and language was verbally."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Novik261262"&gt;{{harvnb|Novik|2015|pp=261–262}}. "Historical Facts. Four villages with Albanian population are located in the Ukraine: Karakurt (Zhovtnevoe) set up in 1811 (Odessa region), Tyushki (Georgievka), Dzhandran (Gammovka) and Taz (Devninskoe) set up in 1862 (Zaporizh’a region). Before migrating to the territory of the Russian empire, Albanians had moved from the south-east of the present day Albania into Bulgaria (Varna region) because of the Osmanli invasion (Державин, 1914, 1926, 1933, 1948, pp. 156–169). Three hundred years later they had moved from Bulgaria to the Russian empire on account of Turkish-Russian opposition in the Balkan Peninsula. Ethnic Albanians also live in Moldova, Odessa and St. Petersburg. Present Day Situation. Nowadays, in the Ukraine and Russia there are an estimated 5000 ethnic Albanians. They live mainly in villages situated in the Odessa and Zaporizh’a regions. The language and many elements of traditional culture are still preserved and maintained in four Albanian villages (Будина, 2000, pp. 239–255; Иванова, 2000, pp. 40–53). From the ethnolinguistic and linguistic point of view these Albanian villages are of particular interest and value since they are excellent examples of a "melting pot" (Иванова, 1995, 1999). Bulgarians and Gagauzes live side by side with Albanians in Karakurt; Russians and Ukrainians share the same space with Albanians in the Azov Sea region. It is worth mentioning that in these multi-lingual environments, the Albanian patois retains original Balkan features."&lt;/ref&gt;

Albanians are primarily composed of two sub-ethnic groups known as the [[Ghegs]] and [[Tosks]]. In the 13th century, the [[Ghegs]] converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] from [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] as a means to resist the [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[Serbs]].&lt;ref name="Stavrianos498"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chisholm1910"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramet381"/&gt; In the 15th century, [[Skanderbeg]] led the [[Albania under the Ottoman Empire|medieval Albanian]] resistance to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest.

==Ethnonym==
{{Further|Names of the Albanians and Albania|Albania (toponym)|Shqiptar}}

The Albanians ({{lang-sq|Shqiptarët}}) and their country Albania ({{lang-sq|Shqipëria}}) have been identified by many [[ethnonym]]s. The most common native [[ethnonym]] is "Shqiptar", plural "Shqiptarë"; the name "Albanians" ([[Byzantine Greek]]: ''Albanoi/Arbanitai/Arbanites''; [[Latin]]: ''Albanenses/Arbanenses'') was used in medieval documents, that gradually entered [[European Languages|European languages]] from which other similar derivative names emerged.&lt;ref name="Elsie200534"/&gt;

From these ethnonyms, names for Albanians were also derived in other languages, that were or still are in use.&lt;ref name="Lloshi277"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BardhylDemiraj534"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamusella241"/&gt; In [[English language|English]] "Albanians"; [[Italian language|Italian]] "Albanesi"; [[German language|German]] "Albaner"; [[Greek language|Greek]] "Arvanites", "Alvanitis" (Αλβανίτης) plural: "Alvanites" (Αλβανίτες), "Alvanos" (Αλβανός) plural: "Alvanoi" (Αλβανοί); [[Turkish language|Turkish]] "Arnaut", "Arnavut"; [[South Slavic languages]] "Arbanasi" (Арбанаси), "Albanci" (Албанци); [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] "Arbineş" and so on.&lt;ref name="Liotta198"&gt;{{harvnb|Liotta|2001|p=198}}. "Among Greeks, the term "Alvanitis"—or "Arvanitis"—means a Christian of Albanian ancestry, one who speaks both Greek and Albanian, but possesses Greek "consciousness." Numerous "Arvanites" live in Greece today, although the ability to speak both languages is shrinking as the differences (due to technology and information access and vastly different economic bases) between Greece and Albania increase. The Greek communities of Elefsis, Marousi, Koropi, Keratea, and Markopoulo (all in the Attikan peninsula) once held significant Arvanite communities. "Arvanitis" is not necessarily a pejorative term; a recent Pan Hellenic socialist foreign minister spoke both Albanian and Greek (but not English). A former Greek foreign minister, Theodoros Pangalos, was an "Arvanite" from Elefsis."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lloshi277"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BardhylDemiraj534"&gt;{{harvnb|Demiraj|2010|p=534}}.

Among the neighbouring peoples and elsewhere the denomination of the Albanians is based upon the root arb/alb, cp.

The term "Albanoi" (Αλβανοί) is first encountered twice in the works of Byzantine historian [[Michael Attaliates]], and the term "Arvanitai" (Αρβανίται) is used once by the same author. He referred to the "Albanoi" as having taken part in a revolt against the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1043, and to the "Arbanitai" as subjects of the Duke of Dyrrachium (modern [[Durrës]]).&lt;ref name="MadgearuGordon25b"/&gt; These references have been disputed as to whether they refer to the people of Albania.&lt;ref name="MadgearuGordon25b"&gt;{{harvnb|Madgearu|Gordon|2008|p=25}}.

"Linguists believe that the ‘Alb-’ element comes from the Indo-European word for a type of mountainous terrain, from which the word ‘Alps’ is also derived."&lt;/ref&gt; Through the root word ''alban'' and its rhotacized equivalents ''arban'', ''albar'', and ''arbar'', the term in Albanian became rendered as ''Arbëneshë/Arbëreshë'' for the people and ''Arbënia/Arbëria'' for the country.&lt;ref name="Elsie200534"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=3–4}}. "Their traditional designation, based on a root *''alban''- and its rhotacized variants *''arban''-, *''albar''-, and *''arbar''-, appears from the eleventh century onwards in Byzantine chronicles (''Albanoi'', ''Arbanitai'', ''Arbanites''), and from the fourteenth century onwards in Latin and other Western documents (''Albanenses'', ''Arbanenses'')."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lloshi277"/&gt; The Albanian language was referred to as ''Arbnisht'' and ''Arbërisht''.&lt;ref name="MënikuCampos2"&gt;{{harvnb|Mëniku|Campos|2012|p=2}}. "Albanian is an Indo-European language, but like modern Greek and Armenian, it does not have any other closely related living language. Within the Indo-European family, it forms a group of its own. In Albanian, the language is called shqip. Albania is called ''Shqipëri'', and the Albanians call themselves ''shqiptarë''. Until the fifteenth century the language was known as ''Arbërisht'' or ''Arbnisht'', which is still the name used for the language in Italy and Greece. The Greeks refer to all the varieties of Albanian spoken in Greece as Arvanitika. In the second century AD, Ptolemy, the Alexandrian mathematician, astronomer and geographer, used the name ''Albanoi'' to refer to an Illyrian tribe that used to live in what is now central Albania. During the Middle Ages the population of that area was referred to as ''Arbanori'' or ''Albanon''. It is clear that the words ''Arbëresh'', ''Arvanitika'', and even ''Albanian'' and ''Albania'' are all related to the older name of the language."&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[exonym]] Albania for the general region inhabited by the Albanians does have connotations to Classical Antiquity, the Albanian language employs a different ethnonym, with modern Albanians referring to themselves as ''Shqip(ë)tarë'' and to their country as ''Shqipëria''.&lt;ref name="Lloshi277"/&gt; Two etymologies have been proposed for this ethnonym: one, derived from the etymology from the Albanian word for eagle (shqipe, var., shqiponjë).&lt;ref name="Kamusella241"/&gt; In Albanian [[folk etymology]], this word denotes a bird [[totem]], dating from the times of Skanderbeg as displayed on the [[Albanian flag]].&lt;ref name="Kamusella241"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ej2-s"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=ALBANCI | encyclopedia =[[Enciklopedija Jugoslavije]] 2nd ed. | volume=Supplement | pages=1 | publisher=[[JLZ]] | location=[[Zagreb]] | year=1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is within scholarship that connects it to the verb 'to speak' (''me shqiptue'') from the Latin "''excipere''".&lt;ref name="Kamusella241"/&gt; In this instance the Albanian endonym like ''[[Slav (ethnonym)|Slav]]'' [[Endonym#Tendencies in the development of exonyms|and others]] would originally have been a term connoting "those who speak [intelligibly, the same language]".&lt;ref name="Kamusella241"&gt;{{harvnb|Kamusella|2009|p=241}}. "Prior to the emergence of the modern self-ethnonym ''Shqiptarë'' in the mid-16th century (for the first time it was recorded in 1555 by the Catholic Gheg, Gjon Buzuku, in his missal), North Albanians (Ghegs) referred to themselves as ''Arbën'', and South Albanians (Tosks) ''Arbër''. Hence, the self-ethnonym ''Arbëreshë'' of the present-day Italo-Albanians (numbering about 100,000) in southern Italy and Sicily, whose ancestors, in the wake of the Ottoman wars, emigrated from their homeland in the 14th century. These self-ethnonyms perhaps influenced the Byzantine Greek Arvanites for ‘Albanians,’ which was followed by similar ones in Bulgarian and Serbian (''Arbanasi''), Ottoman (''Arnaut''), Romanian (''Arbănas''), and Aromanian (''Arbineş''). It is clear that scholars and Albanians themselves agree that they do not agree on any single etymology of the ethnonym ‘Albanian.’ A similar predicament is faced by the self-ethnonym ''Shqiptarë''. The most popular scholarly explanation is that it was formed by analogy to ‘Slavs’ (*''Slovene''), believed to be derived from ''slovo'' (‘word’), and by extension, from *''sluti'' (‘to speak clearly.’) The last explanation semantically contrasts with Slavic ''Niemiec'' (‘mute,’‘stammering,’‘babbling’), and Greek ‘barbarian’ (from ''barbaros'' ‘those who stammer, babble’). Hence, ''Shqiptarë'' could be derived from Albanian ''shqipoi'' (from Latin ''excipere'') for ‘to speak clearly, to understand.’ The Albanian public favors the belief that their self-ethnonym stems from ''shqipe'' (‘eagle’) found on the Albanian national flag."&lt;/ref&gt; The new ethnonyms ''Shqip(ë)tarë'' and ''Shqipëria'' emerged and replaced the older ethnonyms ''Arbëneshë/Arbëreshë'' and ''Arbënia/Arbëria'' between the late 17th and early 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Lloshi277"/&gt; That era brought about religious and other sociopolitical changes.&lt;ref name="Lloshi277"/&gt; As such a new and generalised response by Albanians based on ethnic and linguistic consciousness to this new and different Ottoman world emerging around them was a change in ethnonym.&lt;ref name="Lloshi277"&gt;{{harvnb|Lloshi|1999|p=277}}. "The Albanians of today call themselves ''shqiptarë'', their country ''Shqipëri'', and their language ''shqipe''. These terms came into use between the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries. Foreigners call them ''albanesi'' (Italian), ''Albaner'' (German), ''Albanians'' (English), ''Alvanos'' (Greek), and ''Arbanasi'' (old Serbian), the country ''Albania'', ''Albanie'', ''Albanien'', ''Alvania'', and ''Albanija'', and the language ''Albanese'', ''Albanisch'', ''Albanian'', ''Alvaniki'', and ''Arbanashki'' respectively. All these words are derived from the name ''Albanoi'' of an Illyrian tribe and their center ''Albanopolis'', noted by the astronomer of Alexandria, Ptolemy, in the 2nd century AD. ''Alban'' could be a plural of ''alb''- ''arb''-, denoting the inhabitants of the plains (ÇABEJ 1976). The name passed over the boundaries of the Illyrian tribe in central Albania, and was generalised for all the Albanians. They called themselves ''arbënesh'', ''arbëresh'', the country ''Arbëni'', ''Arbëri'', and the language ''arbëneshe'', ''arbëreshe''. In the foreign languages, the Middle Ages denominations of these names survived, but for the Albanians they were substituted by ''shqiptarë'', ''Shqipëri'' and ''shqipe''. The primary root is the adverb ''shqip'', meaning "clearly, intelligibly". There is a very close semantic parallel to this in the German noun ''Deutsche'', "the Germans" and "the German language" (Lloshi 1984) Shqip spread out from the north to the south, and ''Shqipni/Shqipëri'' is probably a collective noun, following the common pattern of ''Arbëni'', ''Arbëri''. The change happened after the Ottoman conquest because of the conflict in the whole line of the political, social, economic, religious, and cultural spheres with a totally alien world of the Oriental type. A new and more generalised ethnic and linguistic consciousness of all these people responded to this."&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of Albanians in [[Kosovo]] as well as in the adjacent regions of [[Toplica District|Toplica]] and [[Moravac|Morava]] is recorded since the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Anscombe767774785788"&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006b|pp=767–774}}, 785–788. "While the ethnic roots of some settlements can be determined from the Ottoman records, Serbian and Albanian historians have at times read too much into them in their running dispute over the ethnic history of early Ottoman Kosovo. Their attempts to use early Ottoman provincial surveys (tahrir defterleri) to gauge the ethnic make—up of the population in the fifteenth century have proved little. Leaving aside questions arising from the dialects and pronunciation of the census scribes, interpreters, and even priests who baptized those recorded, no natural law binds ethnicity to name. Imitation, in which the customs, tastes, and even names of those in the public eye are copied by the less exalted, is a time—tested tradition and one followed in the Ottoman Empire. Some Christian sipahis in early Ottoman Albania took such Turkic names as Timurtaş, for example, in a kind of cultural conformity completed later by conversion to Islam. Such cultural mimicry makes onomastics an inappropriate tool for anyone wishing to use Ottoman records to prove claims so modern as to have been irrelevant to the pre—modern state. The seventeenth—century Ottoman notable arid author Evliya Çelebi, who wrote a massive account of his travels around the empire and abroad, included in it details of local society that normally would not appear in official correspondence; for this reason his account of a visit to several towns in Kosovo in 1660 is extremely valuable. Evliya confirms that western and at least parts of central Kosovo were ‘Arnavud’. He notes that the town of Vučitrn had few speakers of ‘Boşnakca’; its inhabitants spoke Albanian or Turkish. He terms the highlands around Tetovo (in Macedonia), Peć, and Prizren the ‘mountains of Arnavudluk’. Elsewhere, he states that ‘the mountains of Peć’ lay in Arnavudluk, from which issued one of the rivers converging at Mitrovica, just north-west of which he sites Kosovo's border with Bosna. This river, the Ibar, flows from a source in the mountains of Montenegro north—north—west of Peć, in the region of Rozaje to which the Këlmendi would later be moved. He names the other river running by Mitrovica as the Kılab and says that it, too, had its source in Aravudluk; by this he apparently meant the Lab, which today is the name of the river descending from mountains north—east of Mitrovica to join the Sitnica north of Priština. As Evliya travelled south, he appears to have named the entire stretch of river he was following the Kılab, not noting the change of name when he took the right fork at the confluence of the Lab and Sitnica. Thus, Evliya states that the tomb of Murad I, killed in the battle of Kosovo Polje, stood beside the Kılab, although it stands near the Sitnica outside Priština. Despite the confusion of names, Evliya included in Arnavudluk not only the western fringe of Kosovo, but also the central mountains from which the Sitnica (‘Kılab’) and its first tributaries descend. Given that a large Albanian population lived in Kosovo, especially in the west and centre, both before and after the Habsburg invasion of 1689–90, it remains possible, in theory, that at that time in the Ottoman Empire, one people emigrated en masse and another immigrated to take its place.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Serbs expelled many Albanians from the wider Toplica and Morava regions in Southern Serbia, which the 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]] had given to the [[Principality of Serbia]], many of them settled in Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Jagodic"&gt;{{harvnb|Jagodić|1998}}. para. 1–71.&lt;/ref&gt; In Kosovo, they and their descendants are known as ''Muhaxher'' (meaning ''the exiled'', from the Arabic muhajir).&lt;ref name="Uka525354"&gt;{{harvnb|Uka|2004d|p=52}}.

During the [[First Balkan War]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]], after expelling the Ottoman forces in present-day Albania and Kosovo, committed numerous war crimes against the Albanians, which were reported by the European, American and Serbian opposition press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=1913 {{!}} Leo Freundlich: Albania's Golgotha: Indictment of the Exterminators of the Albanian People |url=http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts20_1/AH1913_1.html |website=www.albanianhistory.net |access-date=2016-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531131757/http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts20_1/AH1913_1.html |archivedate=31 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further during the [[Kosovo War]], Serbian paramilitary forces committed war crimes in Kosovo, although the Serbian government claims that the army was only going after suspected Albanian terrorists.

Culturally, Albanians in Kosovo are very closely related to Albanians in Albania. Traditions and customs differ even from town to town in Kosovo itself. The spoken dialect is [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]], typical of northern Albanians. The language of state institutions, education, books, media and newspapers is the standard dialect of Albanian, which is closer to the [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]] dialect. The most widespread religion among Albanians in Kosovo is [[Islam]], mostly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], and [[Roman Catholicism in Kosovo|Roman Catholicism]].

There are small Albanian populations dating to migrations from the 18th century. One group known as the ''[[Arbanas]]'' are located on Croatia's Dalmatian coast and fled Ottoman repression.&lt;ref name="Barancic551"/&gt; The second known as the ''Албанці'' (Albantsi) are located in scattered communities across southern Ukraine and descend from Albanian warriors who fought against the Ottoman Empire during the [[History of the Russo-Turkish wars|Russo-Turkish wars]] and allowed to settle in the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Novik261262"/&gt; The actual number of the Albanian population in Romania is unofficially estimated at around 10,000 persons. Most members of the community live in [[Bucharest]],&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; while the rest mainly live in larger urban centers such as [[Timișoara]], [[Iași]], Constanța and [[Cluj-Napoca]]. Most families in Romania are Orthodox and trace their origins to the area around [[Korçë]].

The [[Albanians in Italy|Albanian migration]] to [[Italy]] can be broadly categorised into several migration cycles that occurred throughout history which in turn can be attributed to factors such as political or religious difficulties that emerged in the [[Balkan Peninsula]]. It dates back to the 15th-17th centuries as once numerous Albanian and other Balkan soldiers, known as the [[Stratioti]], were recruited to the [[Italian Peninsula]] as prominent [[mercenaries]] by the [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitans]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicilians]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Giornale enciclopedico di Napoli |date=1807 |publisher=Orsiniana |pages=152 |url=https://books.google.it/books?id=EtEAAAAAYAAJ&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA300#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gli arbëreshë e la Basilicata |url=http://distoriadistorie.blogspot.it/2013/03/gli-arbereshe-e-la-basilicata.html |website=distoriadistorie.blogspot.it |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stratiotis, composed of Christians and Muslims, served initially for the [[Republic of Venice]] in their campaigns, among others, against the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Detrez Raymond, Plas Pieter |title=Developing Cultural Identity in the Balkans: Convergence vs Divergence |isbn=90-5201-297-0 |edition=Peter Lang |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=TRttHdXjP14C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=Stradioti&amp;f=false|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Centuries later in the end of the 20th century occurred another and simultaneously the largest migration cycle of Albanians to Italy surpassing the earlier migration of the Arbëreshë.

{{Main|Albanians in Greece}}

An estimated 275,000–600,000 (Includes dual citizens, temporary migrants, and undocumented) Albanians live in [[Greece]], forming the largest immigrant community in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Vathi, Zana. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rV11CQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=albanians+largest+immigrant+community+greece&amp;hl=nl&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Migrating and Settling in a Mobile World: Albanian Migrants and Their Children in Europe''] Springer, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3319130248}} p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; They are economic migrants whose migration began in 1991, following the collapse of the [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania]].

The [[Arvanites]] and [[Albanian-speakers of Western Thrace]] are a group descended from [[Tosks]] who migrated to southern and central Greece between the 13th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref name="Gogonas3"&gt;{{harvnb|Gogonas|2010|p=3}}. "Arvanites originate from Albanian settlers who moved south at different times between the 14th and the 16th centuries from areas in what is today southern Albania The reasons for this migration are not entirely clear and may be manifold. In many instances the Arvanites were invited by the Byzantine and Latin rulers of the time. They were employed to resettle areas that had been largely depopulated through wars, epidemics and other reasons, and they were employed as soldiers. Some later movements are also believed to have been motivated to evade Islamisation after the Ottoman conquest. The main waves of the Arvanite migration into southern Greece started around 1300, reached a peak some time during the 14th century, and ended around 1600. Arvanites first reached Thessaly, then Attica and finally the Peloponnese (Clogg. 2002). Regarding the number of Arvanites in Greece, the 1951 census (the last census in Greece that included a question about language) gives a figure of 23.000 Arvaiithka speakers. Sociohinguistic research in the 1970s in the villages of Attica and Biotia alone indicated a figure of at least 30.000 speakers (Trudgill and Tzavaras 1977), while Lunden (1993) suggests 50.000 for Greece as a whole."&lt;/ref&gt; They are Greek Orthodox Christians, and though they traditionally speak a dialect of [[Tosk Albanian]] known as [[Arvanitika]], they have fully assimilated into the Greek nation and do not identify as Albanians.&lt;ref name="Hall2829"&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1997|pp=28–29}}. "The permeability of ethnic boundaries is also demonstrated in many of the Greek villages of Attiki and Viotia (ancient Attika and Boiotia), where Arvanites often form a majority) These Arvanites are descended from Albanians who first entered Greece between the eleventh and fifteenth centuries (though there was a subsequent wave of immigration in the second half of the eighteenth century). Although still regarded as ethnically distinct in the nineteenth century, their participation in the Greek War of Independence and the Civil War has led to increasing assimilation: in a survey conducted in the 1970s, 97 per crnt of Arvanite informants despite regularly speaking in Arvanitika, considered themselves to be Greek. A similar concern with being identified as Greek is exhibited by the bilingual Arvanites of the Eastern Argolid."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bintliff137138"&gt;{{harvnb|Bintliff|2003|pp=137–138}}. "First, we can explain the astonishing persistence of Albanian village culture from the fourteenth to the nineteenth centuries through the ethnic and religious tolerance characteristic of Islamic empires and so lacking in their Christian equivalents. Ottoman control rested upon allowing local communities to keep their religion, language, local laws, and representatives, provided that taxes were paid (the millet system). There was no pressure for Greeks and Albanians to conform to each other's language or other behavior.
Clear signs of change are revealed in the travel diaries of the German scholar Ludwig Ross (1851), when he accompanied the Bavarian Otto, whom the Allies had foisted as king upon the newly freed Greek nation in the aftermath of the War of Independence in the 1830s. Ross praises the well-built Greek villages of central Greece with their healthy, happy, dancing inhabitants, and contrasts them specifically with the hovels and sickly inhabitants of Albanian villages. In fact, recent scholarship has underlined how far it was the West that built modem Greece in its own fanciful image as the land of a long-oppressed people who were the direct descendants of Pericles.
Thus from the late nineteenth century onward the children of the inhabitants of the new "nation-state" were taught in Greek, history confined itself to the episodes of pure Greekness, and the tolerant Ottoman attitude to cultural diversity yielded to a deliberate policy of total Hellenization of the populace—effective enough to fool the casual observer. One is rather amazed at the persistence today of such dual-speaking populations in much of the Albanian colonization zone. However, apart from the provinciality of this essentially agricultural province, a high rate of illiteracy until well into this century has also helped to preserve Arvanitika in the Boeotian villagers (Meijs 1993)."; p. 140. "In contrast therefore to the more openly problematic issue of Slav speakers in northern Greece, Arvanitic speakers in central Greece lack any signs of an assertive ethnicity. I would like to suggest that they possess what we might term a ''passive ethnicity''. As a result of a number of historical factors, much of the rural population in central Greece was Albanian-speaking by the time of the creation of the modern Greek state in the 1830s. Until this century, most of these people were illiterate and unschooled, yet there existed sufficient knowledge of Greek to communicate with officials and townspeople, itinerant traders, and so on, to limit the need to transform rural language usage. Life was extremely provincial, with just one major carriage-road passing through the center of the large province of Boeotia even in the 1930s (beyond which horseback and cart took over; van Effenterre 1989). Even in the 1960s, Arvanitic village children could be figures of fun for their Greek peers in the schools of Thebes (One of the two regional towns) (K. Sarri, personal communication, 2000). It was not a matter of cultural resistance but simple conservatism and provinciality, the extreme narrowness of rural life, that allowed Arvanitic language and local historic memories to survive so effectively to the very recent period."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VeremisKolipoulos2425"&gt;{{harvnb|Veremis|Kolipoulos|2003|pp=24–25}}. "For the time being, the Greeks of free Greece could indulge in defining their brethren of unredeemed Greece, primarily the Slav Macedonians and secondarily the Orthodox Albanians and the Vlachs. Primary school students were taught, in the 1880s, that ‘Greeks [are] our kinsmen, of common descent, speaking the language we speak and professing the religion we profess’." But this definition, it seems, was reserved for small children who could not possibly understand the intricate arguments of their parents on the question of Greek identity. What was essential to understand at that tender age was that modern Greeks descended from the ancient Greeks. Grown up children, however, must have been no less confused than adults on the criteria for defining modern Greek identity. Did the Greeks constitute a ‘race’ apart from the Albanians, the Slavs and the Vlachs? Yes and no. High school students were told that the ‘other races’, i.e. the Slavs, the Albanians and the Vlachs, ‘having been Hellenized with the years in terms of mores and customs, are now being assimilated into the Greeks’. On the Slavs of Macedonia there seems to have been no consensus. Were they Bulgars, Slavicized Greeks or early Slavs? They ‘were’ Bulgars until the 1870s and Slavicized Greeks, or Hellenized Slavs subsequently, according to the needs of the dominant theory. There was no consensus, either, on the Vlachs. Were they Latinized Greek mountaineers of late immigrants from Vlachia? As in the case of the Slavs of Macedonia, Vlach descent shifted from the southern Balkans to the Danube, until the Romanians claimed the Vlachs for their brethren; which made the latter irrevocably indigenous to the southern Balkan mountains. The Albanians or ‘Arvanites’, were readily ‘adopted’ as brethren of common descent for at least three reasons. Firstly, the Albanians had been living in southern Greece, as far south as the Peloponnese, in considerable numbers. Secondly, Christian Albanians had fought with distinction and in considerable numbers in the War of Independence. Thirdly, credible Albanian claims for the establishment of an Albanian nation state materialized too Late for Greek national theorists to abandon well-entrenched positions. Commenting on a geography textbook for primary schools in 1901, a state committee found it inadequate and misleading. One of its principal shortcomings concerned the Albanians, who were described as ‘close kinsmen of the Greeks’. ‘These are unacceptable from the point of view of our national claims and as far as historical truth is concerned’, commented the committee. ‘it must have been maintained that they are of common descent with the Greeks (Pelasgians), that they speak a language akin to that of the Greeks and that they participated in all struggles for national liberation of the common fatherland.’"&lt;/ref&gt; Arvanitika is in a state of attrition due to language shift towards Greek and large-scale internal migration to the cities and subsequent intermingling of the population during the 20th century.

The Albanian diaspora in Turkey was formed during the Ottoman era through economic migration and early years of the Turkish republic through migration due to sociopolitical discrimination and violence experienced by Albanians in Balkan countries.&lt;ref name="GenisMaynard553555"&gt;{{harvnb|Geniş|Maynard|2009|pp=553–555}}. "Taking a chronological perspective, the ethnic Albanians currently living in Turkey today could be categorized into three groups: Ottoman Albanians, Balkan Albanians, and twentieth century Albanians. The first category comprises descendants of Albanians who relocated to the Marmara and Aegean regions as part of the Ottoman Empire's administrative structure. Official Ottoman documents record the existence of Albanians living in and around Istanbul (Constantinople), Iznik (Nicaea), and Izmir (Smyrna). For example, between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries Albanian boys were brought to Istanbul and housed in Topkapı Palace as part of the ''devşirme'' system (an early Ottoman practice of human tribute required of Christian citizens) to serve as civil servants and Janissaries. In the 1600s Albanian seasonal workers were employed by these Albanian Janissaries in and around Istanbul and Iznik, and in 1860 Kayserili Ahmet, the governor of Izmir, employed Albanians to fight the raiding Zeybeks. Today, the descendants of Ottoman Albanians do not form a community per se, but at least some still identify as ethnically Albanian. However, it is unknown how many, if any, of these Ottoman Albanians retain Albanian language skills. The second category of ethnic Albanians living in modern Turkey is composed of people who are the descendants of refugees from the Balkans who because of war were forced to migrate inwards towards Eastern Thrace and Anatolia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as the Ottoman Empire dissolved. These Balkan Albanians are the largest group of ethnic Albanians living in Turkey today, and can be subcategorized into those who ended up in actual Albanian-speaking communities and those who were relocated into villages where they were the only Albanian-speaking migrants. Not surprisingly, the language is retained by some of the descendants from those of the former, but not those of the latter. The third category of ethnic Albanians in Turkey comprises recent or twentieth century migrants from the Balkans. These recent migrants can be subcategorized into those who came from Kosovo in the 1950s–1970s, those who came from Kosovo in 1999, and those who came from the Republic of Albania after 1992. All of these in the third category know a variety of modern Albanian and are mostly located in the western parts of Turkey in large metropolitan areas. Our research focuses on the history of migration and community formation of the Albanians located in the Samsun Province in the Black Sea region around 1912–1913 who would fall into the second category discussed above (see Figure 1). Turkish census data between 1927 and 1965 recorded the presence of Albanian speakers in Samsun Province, and the fieldwork we have been conducting in Samsun since September 2005 has revealed that there is still a significant number of Albanians living in the city and its surrounding region. According to the community leaders we interviewed, there are about 30,000–40,000 ethnic Albanian Turkish citizens in Samsun Province. The community was largely rural, located in the villages and engaged in agricultural activities until the 1970s. After this time, gradual migration to urban areas, particularly smaller towns and nearby cities has been observed. Long-distance rural-to-urban migration also began in later years mostly due to increasing demand for education and better jobs. Those who migrated to areas outside of Samsun Province generally preferred the cities located in the west of Turkey, particularly metropolitan areas such as Istanbul, Izmir and Bursa mainly because of the job opportunities as well as the large Albanian communities already residing in these cities. Today, the size of the Albanian community in Samsun Province is considered to be much smaller and gradually shrinking because of outward migration. Our observation is that the Albanians in Samsun seem to be fully integrated into Turkish society, and engaged in agriculture and small trading businesses. As education becomes accessible to the wider society and modernization accelerates transportation and hence communication of urban values, younger generations have also started to acquire professional occupations. Whilst a significant number of people still speak Albanian fluently as the language in the family, they have a perfect command of the Turkish language and cannot be distinguished from the rest of the population in terms of occupation, education, dress and traditions. In this article, we are interested in the history of this Albanian community in Samsun. Given the lack of any research on the Albanian presence in Turkey, our questions are simple and exploratory. When and where did these people come from? How and why did they choose Samsun as a site of resettlement? How did the socio- cultural characteristics of this community change over time? It is generally believed that the Albanians in Samsun Province are the descendants of the migrants and refugees from Kosovo who arrived in Turkey during the wars of 1912–13. Based on our research in Samsun Province, we argue that this information is partial and misleading. The interviews we conducted with the Albanian families and community leaders in the region and the review of Ottoman history show that part of the Albanian community in Samsun was founded through three stages of successive migrations. The first migration involved the forced removal of Muslim Albanians from the Sancak of Nish in 1878; the second migration occurred when these migrants’ children fled from the massacres in Kosovo in 1912–13 to Anatolia; and the third migration took place between 1913 and 1924 from the scattered villages in Central Anatolia where they were originally placed to the Samsun area in the Black Sea Region. Thus, the Albanian community founded in the 1920s in Samsun was in many ways a reassembling of the demolished Muslim Albanian community of Nish. This trajectory of the Albanian community of Nish shows that the fate of this community was intimately bound up with the fate of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans and the socio-cultural composition of modern Turkey still carries on the legacy of its historical ancestor."&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2008 report prepared for the [[National Security Council (Turkey)|National Security Council]] of Turkey by academics of three Turkish universities in eastern [[Anatolia]], there were approximately 1,300,000 people of Albanian descent living in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Milliyet, Türkiyedeki Kürtlerin Sayısı. 2008-06-06.&lt;/ref&gt; According to that study, more than 500,000 Albanian descendants still recognize their ancestry and or their language, culture and traditions.&lt;ref name="Zamanheritage"&gt;"[http://www.todayszaman.com/national_albanians-in-turkey-celebrate-their-cultural-heritage_254383.html Albanians in Turkey celebrate their cultural heritage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031102644/http://www.todayszaman.com/national_albanians-in-turkey-celebrate-their-cultural-heritage_254383.html |date=31 October 2015 }}".

Italy's [[Italian invasion of Albania|annexation]] of Albania and its alliance with [[Nazi Germany]] against the allies marked a difficult time for Albanian and Italian Australians as they were thought by Australian authorities to pose a fascist threat. However, the number of Albanian immigrants slowed consequently during that time but also due to immigration restrictions placed by the [[Communism in Albania|communist regime]] in Albania.

The most recent Albanian immigrants came mostly from [[Kosovo]] and the former [[Ex-Yugoslavian countries|Yugoslavian countries]] inclusively [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. The immigrants were mostly Muslims but also Orthodox and Catholics among them the relatives of the renowned Albanian nun and missionary [[Mother Teresa]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; 
  
In 2016, approximately 4,041 persons resident in Australia identified themselves as having been born in [[Albania]], while 15,901 persons identified themselves as having Albanian ancestry, either alone or in combination with another ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/ViewData?breadcrumb=POLTD&amp;method=Place%20of%20Usual%20Residence&amp;subaction=-1&amp;issue=2006&amp;producttype=Census%20Tables&amp;documentproductno=0&amp;textversion=false&amp;documenttype=Details&amp;collection=Census&amp;javascript=true&amp;topic=Ancestry&amp;action=404&amp;productlabel=Ancestry%20(full%20classification%20list)%20by%20Sex&amp;order=1&amp;period=2006&amp;tabname=Details&amp;areacode=0&amp;navmapdisplayed=true&amp; | title = 20680-Ancestry (full classification list) by Sex - Australia| format = Microsoft Excel download |publisher = [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] | work = {{CensusAU|2006}}| accessdate = 2008-06-02}} Total responses: 25,451,383 for total count of persons: 19,855,288.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many Albanian Australians that were born in Italy, Macedonia as well as Kosovo, due to this they are recorded under those statistics.

{{Main|Origin of the Albanians|}}

=== Middle Ages ===

An old Bulgarian text compiled around the beginning of the 11th century contains a possible reference to Albanians.&lt;ref name="Elsie3"/&gt; It is preserved in a Serbian manuscript dated 1628 and was first published in 1934 by Radoslav Grujic. It is a fragment of a once longer text that endeavours to explain the origins of peoples and languages in a question-and-answer form similar to a catechism. It divides the world into seventy-two languages and three religious categories: Orthodox Christians, half-believers (i.e. non-Orthodox Christians) and non-believers. Grujic dated it to the early 11th century and if this and the identification of the ''Arbanasi'' as Albanians are correct it would be the earliest written document referring to the Albanians as a people or language group.&lt;ref name="Elsie3"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It can be seen that there are various languages on earth. Of them, there are five Orthodox languages: Bulgarian, Greek, Syrian, Iberian (Georgian) and Russian. Three of these have Orthodox alphabets: Greek, Bulgarian and Iberian. There are twelve languages of half-believers: Alamanians, [[Franks]], Magyars (Hungarians), Indians, Jacobites, Armenians, [[Saxons]], Lechs (Poles), '''Arbanasi''' (Albanians), Croatians, Hizi, Germans.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first undisputed mention of Albanians in the historical record is attested in Byzantine source for the first time in 1079–1080, in a work titled ''History'' by Byzantine historian [[Michael Attaliates]], who referred to the ''Albanoi'' as having taken part in a revolt against [[Constantinople]] in 1043 and to the ''Arbanitai'' as subjects of the duke of [[Durrës|Dyrrachium]]. It is disputed, however, whether the "Albanoi" of the events of 1043 refers to Albanians in an ethnic sense or whether "Albanoi" is a reference to [[Normans]] from [[Sicily]] under an archaic name (there was also a tribe in Italy by the name of "Albanoi").&lt;ref name="MadgearuGordon25b"/&gt; However a later reference to Albanians from the same Attaleiates, regarding the participation of Albanians in a rebellion around 1078, is undisputed.&lt;ref name="MadgearuGordon25"/&gt; At this point, they are already fully Christianized, although [[Albanian mythology]] and folklore are part of the [[Paleo-Balkan mythology|Paleo-Balkan]] pagan mythology,&lt;ref name="Bonnefoy253"&gt;{{harvnb|Bonnefoy|1993|p=253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular showing Greek influence.&lt;ref name="EliadeAdams179"&gt;{{harvnb|Eliade|Adams|1987|p=179}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 11th century the Albanians were called Arbën/Arbër and their country as [[Arbanon]],&lt;ref name="Norris35"&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|1993 |p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a mountainous area to the west of [[Lake Ochrida]] and the upper valley of the river Shkumbin.&lt;ref name="Nicol160"&gt;{{harvnb|Nicol|1986|p=160}}. "The geographical location of the mysterious 'Arbanon' has at last no doubt been settled by the researches of Alain Ducellier. In the 11th century at least it was the name given to the mountainous area to the west of Lake Ohrid and the upper valley of the river Shkumbin..."&lt;/ref&gt; It was in 1190, when the rulers of Arbanon (local Albanian noble called [[Progon of Kruja|Progon]] and his sons Dhimitër and Gjin) created their [[Principality of Arbër|principality]] with its capital at [[Krujë]].&lt;ref name="Ducellier780a"&gt;{{harvnb|Ducellier|1995|p=780}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of [[House of Progon|Progon Dynasty]] in 1216, the principality came under [[Grigor Kamona]] and [[Gulam of Albania]]. Finally the Principality was dissolved in 1255. Around 1230 the two main centers of Albanian settlements, one around [[Devoll (river)|Devoll river]] in what is now central Albania,&lt;ref name="Ducellier780781"&gt;{{harvnb|Ducellier|1995|pp=780–781}}. "the Albanians dominated the central regions of what is now the Albanian republic, in the areas which are drained by the Devollit river"&lt;/ref&gt; and the other around the region which was known with the name Arbanon.&lt;ref name="Ducellier780781b"&gt;{{harvnb|Ducellier|1995|pp=780–781}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1271 [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]] created the [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|Kingdom of Albania]], after he captured a part of the [[Despotate of Epirus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Historia e popullit shqiptar në katër vëllime (in Albanian)|last = Prifti|first = Skënder|publisher = Botimet Toena|year = 2002|isbn = 978-99927-1-622-9|location = |pages = |page = 207}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major attempt to advance further in direction of Constantinople failed at the [[Siege of Berat (1280–1281)]]. A Byzantine counteroffensive soon ensued, which drove the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] out of the interior by 1281. The [[Sicilian Vespers]] further weakened the position of Charles, and the Kingdom was soon reduced by the [[Epirus (region)|Epirotes]] to a small area around [[Durrës]]. The kingdom however held out until 1368, when the city was captured by [[Karl Topia|Karl Thopia]]. The presence of the kingdom reinforced the influence of Catholicism and the conversion to its rite, not only in the region of Durrës but in other parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lala, Etleva (2008), Regnum Albaniae, the Papal Curia, and the Western Visions of a Borderline Nobility (PDF), Central European University, Department of Medieval Studies|last = Lala|first = Eleva|publisher = Central European University, Department of Medieval Studies|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Budapest, Hungary|pages = 52|url = http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2009/mphlae01.pdf|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new wave of Catholic dioceses, churches and monasteries were founded, a number of different religious orders began spreading into the country, and papal missionaries also reached the territories of the Kingdom of Albania. Those who were not Catholic in Central and North Albania converted and a great number of Albanian clerics and monks were present in the Dalmatian Catholic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Regnum Albaiae, the Papal Curia and the Western Visions of a Borderline Nobility|last = Lala|first = Etleva|publisher = Central European Department for Medieval Studies|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Budapes, Hungary|pages = 146|url = http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2009/mphlae01.pdf|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 14th century a number of [[Albanian principalities]] were created. These included [[Principality of Kastrioti]], [[Principality of Dukagjini]], [[Principality of Albania (medieval)|Princedom of Albania]], and [[Principality of Gjirokastër]]. At the beginning of the 15th century these principalities became stronger, especially because of the fall of the [[Serbian Empire]]. Some of these principalities were united in 1444 under the military alliance called [[League of Lezhë|League of Lezha]].

At the dawn of the establishment of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[Southeast Europe]], the geopolitical landscape was marked by scattered kingdoms of small [[Principalities of albania|principalities]]. The Ottomans erected their garrisons throughout [[southern Albania]] by 1415 and established formal jurisdiction over most of Albania by 1431.&lt;ref&gt;Licursi, Emiddio Pietro (2011). Empire of Nations: The Consolidation of Albanian and Turkish National Identities in theLate Ottoman Empire, 1878–1913. New York: Columbia University. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1443 a great and longstanding revolt broke under the lead of the Albanian national hero [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg]], which lasted until 1479, many times defeating major Ottoman armies led by sultans [[Murad II]] and [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]]. Skanderbeg united initially the Albanian princes and later established a centralized authority over most of the non-conquered territories, becoming [[Skanderbeg|Lord of Albania]]. He also tried relentlessly but rather unsuccessfully to create a European coalition against the Ottomans. He frustrated every attempt by the Turks to regain Albania, which they envisioned as a springboard for the invasion of Italy and western Europe. His unequal fight against the mightiest power of the time won the esteem of Europe as well as some support in the form of money and military aid from Naples, the papacy, [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], and [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]].&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12472/Albania/42646/The-decline-of-Byzantium|title=Albania :: The decline of Byzantium – Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally after decades of resistance, Ottomans captured [[Siege of Shkodra|Shkodër in 1479]] and Durrës in 1501.&lt;ref&gt;Barletius, Marinus. De obsidione Scodrensi. Venice: Bernardino de Vitabilus, 1504.&lt;/ref&gt; Skanderbeg's long struggle to keep Albania free became highly significant to the Albanian people, as it strengthened their solidarity, made them more conscious of their national identity, and served later as a great source of inspiration in their struggle for national unity, freedom, and independence.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="initaly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.initaly.com/regions/ethnic/arberesh.htm|title=In Italy Online – Ethnic Italy – The History of Albanians in Italy|publisher=initaly.com|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion triggered a several waves of migration of Albanians from Albania, Epirus and [[Peloponnese]] to the south of Italy, constituting an [[Arbëreshë people|Arbereshe]] community. Albanians were recruited all over Europe as a light cavalry known as [[stratioti]]. The stratioti were pioneers of light cavalry tactics during this era. In the early 16th century heavy cavalry in the European armies was principally remodeled after Albanian stradioti of the Venetian army, Hungarian [[hussar]]s and German mercenary cavalry units (Schwarzreitern).&lt;ref&gt;Downing 1992, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 16th century, Ottoman rule over Southeast Europe was largely secure. The Ottomans proceeded in stages, first appointing a [[qadi]] along with governors and then military retainers in the cities. [[Timar]] holders, not necessarily converts to Islam, would occasionally rebel, the most famous case of which is [[Skanderbeg]]. His figure would be used later in the 19th century as a central component of Albanian national identity. Ottoman control over the Albanian territories was secured in 1571 when [[Ulcinj]], presently in [[Montenegro]], was captured.

The most significant impact on the Albanians was the gradual [[Islamization]] process of a large majority of the population, although such a process only became widespread in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Clayer"&gt;{{citation|subscription=yes|last=Clayer|first=Nathalie|chapter=Albania|title=Encyclopaedia of Islam|volume=Three|editor-first=Gudrun|editor-last=Krämer|editor2-first=Denis|editor2-last=Matringe|editor3-first=John|editor3-last=Nawas|editor4-first=Everett|editor4-last=Rowson|publisher=Brill Online|year=2012|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-3/albania-COM_23054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainly [[Catholics]] converted in the 17th century, while the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] Albanians became [[Muslim]] mainly in the following century. Initially confined to the main city centres of [[Elbasan]] and [[Shkodër]], by this time the countryside was also embracing the new religion.&lt;ref name="Clayer" /&gt; In Elbasan Muslims made up just over half the population in 1569–70 whereas in Shkodër this was almost 90% and in [[Berat]] closer to 60%. In the 17th century, however, Catholic conversion to Islam increased, even in the countryside. The motives for conversion according to scholars were diverse, depending on the context. The lack of source-material does not help when investigating such issues.&lt;ref name="Clayer" /&gt; Reasons in various different contexts included the incentive to escape high taxes levied on Christian subjects, ecclesiastical decay,&lt;ref name="Giakoumis8687"&gt;{{harvnb|Giakoumis|2010|pp=86–87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; coercion by Ottoman authorities in times of war,&lt;ref name="Koti1617"&gt;{{harvnb|Koti|2010|pp=16–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramet203204"&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|1998|pp=203–204}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi1956321323"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1956|pp=321–323}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the privileged legal and social position Muslims had over that of Christians within the empire.&lt;ref name="Giakoumis8788"&gt;{{harvnb|Giakoumis|2010|pp=87–88}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vickers2011"&gt;{{harvnb|Vickers|2011|pp=17–24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myhill 2006 232"&gt;{{cite book|last=Myhill|first=John |title=Language, religion and national identity in Europe and the Middle East: A historical study|year=2006|location=Amsterdam |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dJK3YxI1NM8C&amp;pg=PT241&amp;dq=Albanian+national+identity#v=onepage&amp;q=Albanian%20national%20identity&amp;f=false |isbn=9789027227119|ref=harv|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas such as Albania, Western Macedonia, Southern Serbia, Kosovo, parts of northern Greece and southern Montenegro in Ottoman sources were referred to as ''Arnavudluk'' or Albania.&lt;ref name="Anscombe200688"&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006|pp=88}}. "This Albanian participation in brigandage is easier to track than for many other social groups in Ottoman lands, because Albanian (''Arnavud'') was one of the relatively few ethnic markers regularly added to the usual religious (Muslim-Zimmi) tags used to identify people in state records. These records show that the magnitude of banditry involving Albanians grew through the 1770s and 1780s to reach crisis proportions in the 1790s and 1800s."; p.107. "In light of the recent violent troubles in Kosovo and Macedonia and the strong emotions tied to them, readers are urged most emphatically not to draw either of two unwarranted conclusions from this article:  that Albanians are somehow inherently inclined to banditry, or that the extent of Ottoman "Albania" or ''Arnavudluk'' (which included parts of present-day northern Greece, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, Kosovo, and southern Serbia) gives any historical "justification" for the creation of a "Greater Albania" today."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anscombe772"&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006b|p=772}}. "In this case, however, Ottoman records contain useful information about the ethnicities of the leading actors in the story. In comparison with ‘Serbs’, who were not a meaningful category to the Ottoman state, its records refer to ‘Albanians’ more frequently than to many other cultural or linguistic groups. The term ‘Arnavud’ was used to denote persons who spoke one of the dialects of Albanian, came from mountainous country in the western Balkans (referred to as ‘Arnavudluk’, and including not only the area now forming the state of Albania but also neighbouring parts of Greece, Macedonia, Kosovo, and Montenegro), organized society on the strength of blood ties (family, clan, tribe), engaged predominantly in a mix of settled agriculture and livestock herding, and were notable fighters — a group, in short, difficult to control. Other peoples, such as Georgians, Ahkhaz, Circassians, Tatars, Kurds, and Bedouin Arabs who were frequently identified by their ethnicity, shared similar cultural traits."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kolovos41"&gt;{{harvnb|Kolovos|2007|p=41}}.

In the 1870s, the [[Sublime Porte]]'s reforms aimed at checking the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s disintegration had clearly failed. The image of the "Turkish yoke" had become fixed in the nationalist mythologies and psyches of the people in the [[Balkan Peninsula|Balkan peninsula]], and their march toward independence quickened. Because of the higher degree of Islamic influence, the Albanians internal social divisions, and the fear that they would lose their [[Albanian language|Albanian-inhabited]] territories to the emerging Balkan states, [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Greece]], were the last of the peoples in the Balkans to desire division from the Ottomans.&lt;ref name="Birth of Albania"&gt;{{cite web|editor1=Raymond Zickel|editor2=Walter R.

{{Main|Albanian language|Albanian dialects}}

[[File:Albanian dialects.svg|thumb|right|The various dialects of the Albanian language in Southern Europe]]

The [[Albanian language]] is an [[Indo-European language]] and occupies an independent branch within the family tree. Although it is an [[Language isolate|isolate language]] within the Indo-European tree, while no other language has been conclusively linked to its branch.

The language is the official language of [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]] and is spoken fluently by the majority of the countries populations. Albanian is as well a recognised minority language in [[Croatia]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Romania]] and Serbia. It is the second most spoken language in Greece ([[Arvanitika]] and [[Cham Albanian dialect|Çam]]), Macedonia and the third most spoken language in [[Italy]] ([[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linguistic diversity among foreign citizens in Italy|url=http://www.istat.it/en/archive/129304|publisher=Statistics of Italy|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In consideration to the large [[Albanian diaspora]], the total number of Albanian speakers is much higher than the native speakers in [[Southern Europe]].

A traditional view, based mainly on the [[Geography of Albania|territory]], where the languages were spoken, links the origin of Albanian with [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]]. Not enough Illyrian archaeological evidence is left behind to come to a definite conclusion. Another theory links the Albanian as originating from the [[Thracian language]]. This theory takes exception to the territory, since the language was spoken in an area distinct from Albania, and no significant population movements have been recorded in the period when the shift from one language to the other is supposed to have occurred.&lt;ref name="Hock54"&gt;{{harvnb|Hock|Joseph|1996|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Albanian can be divided into two cultural and linguistic groups including the northern [[Gheg Albanian|Ghegs]] and the southern [[Tosk Albanian|Tosks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Tribes of Albania,: History, Society and Culture|publisher=I.B.Tauris|date=2015|isbn=9780857739322|page=2|edition=Robert Elsie|url=https://books.google.com/?id=i2IpDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=albanians+ghegs+and+tosks#v=onepage&amp;q=albanians%20ghegs%20and%20tosks&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Robert Elsie|title=Geographical location|url=http://www.albanianlanguage.net/|website=albanianlanguage|language=English|quote=The Albanian language is divided into two basic dialect groups: Gheg in the north of the country and Tosk in the south. The Shkumbin River in central Albania, flowing past Elbasan into the Adriatic, forms the approximate boundary between the two dialect regions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geographic border between both based on dialect is the [[Shkumbin River]]. Gheg is mostly spoken, along with the Albanians in [[Albanians of Croatia|Croatia]] ([[Arbanasi people|Arbanasi]]), [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovo]], [[Albanians in Montenegro|Montenegro]] and Northwestern [[Albanians in Macedonia|Macedonia]]. Tosk speaker include the Albanians of [[Albanians in greece|Greece]] ([[Arvanites]], [[Cham Albanians|Çam]]), Southwestern [[Albanians in Macedonia|Macedonia]] and Southern Italy ([[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]]). The diversity between Ghegs and Tosks can be substantial, both sides identify strongly with the common national and ethnic culture.

Most Albanians in Albania speak foreign languages as revealed by a new study carried out by [[Eurostat]], the statistical agency of the [[European Union]], which analyzed the demography of the adult population 25-64 of several European countries as of 2016. The results of the Adult Education Survey, released in May 2018, showed that the 39.9% of the 25–64 years old albanians is able to use at least one foreign language. The main foreign language known is English with 40.0%, followed by Italian with 27.8% and Greek with 22.9%. The English speakers were mostly young people, the knowledge of Italian is stable in every age group, while there is a decrease of the speakers of Greek in the youngest group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.instat.gov.al/media/4028/adult-education-survey-2017.pdf|title=Press release of the Adult Education Survey|last=|first=|date=10 May 2018|work=Albanian Institute of Statistics|access-date=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Albanians in Italy]] are either Albanian immigrants from the 1990s, who came in Italy following the breakdown of the communist regime in Albania in 1990 and speak [[Albanian language|standard Albanian]] and the [[Italian language]], or the [[Arbëreshë people]], Albanian refugees who fled from [[Albania]] for Southern Italy between the fourteenth and eighteenth centuries in consequence of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] invasion of the [[Balkans]], who nowadays speak the [[Arbëresh language]], a variety of Albanian that derives from [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]] spoken in southern [[Albania]] and follows a similar divergence pattern to [[Arvanitika]].

Nowadays most Albanians are non observant with many who are irreligious. A majority among Albanian Muslims are Sunni, while a large minority are Bektashi (an esoteric Shia-derived sect known for liberal attitudes) and there are also smaller Sufi groups, while Christians are split between Orthodox and Catholics with a smaller presence of Protestant sects.&lt;ref name="BogdaniLoughlin2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogdani|first1=Mirela|last2=Loughlin|first2=John|authorlink2=John Loughlin (political scientist)|title=Albania and the European Union: The Tumultuous Journey Towards Integration and Accession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32Wu8H7t8MwC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=16 April 2017|year=2007|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-308-7|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Albanians first appear in the historical record in [[Byzantine]] sources of the late 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Comnena, Anna. The Alexiad, Book IV.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, they were already fully Christianized. All Albanians were [[Orthodox Christians]] until the middle of the 13th century when the [[Ghegs]] were converted to [[Catholicism]] as a mean to resist the [[Slavs]].&lt;ref name="Stavrianos498"&gt;{{harvnb|Stavrianos|2000|p=498}}. "Religious differences also existed before the coming of the Turks. Originally, all Albanians had belonged to the Eastern Orthodox Church... Then the Ghegs in the North adopted in order to better resist the pressure of Orthodox Serbs."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chisholm1910"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh Chisholm|title=Encyclopædia Britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0PgtAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 July 2013|year=1910|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|page=485|quote= The Roman Catholic Ghegs appear to have abandoned the Eastern for the Western Church in the middle of the 13th century}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramet381"&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|1989|p=381}}. "Prior to the Turkish conquest, the ghegs (the chief tribal group in northern Albania) had found in Roman Catholicism a means of resisting the Slavs, and though Albanian Orthodoxy remained important among the tosks (the chief tribal group in southern Albania), ..."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]] was later overtaken by [[Islam]], which kept the scepter of the major religion during the period of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turkish rule from the 15th century until 1912. [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] and [[Roman Catholicism]] continued to be practiced with less frequency.

During the 20th century the monarchy and later the [[totalitarian state]] followed a systematic secularization of the nation and the national culture. This policy was chiefly applied within the borders of the current Albanian state. It produced a secular majority in the population. All forms of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and other religious practices were prohibited except for old non-institutional [[pagan]] practices in the rural areas, which were seen as identifying with the national culture. The current Albanian state has revived some pagan festivals, such as the [[Spring Day|Spring]] festival ({{lang-sq|Dita e Verës}}) held yearly on 14 March in the city of [[Elbasan]]. It is a national holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://theculturetrip.com/europe/albania/articles/how-to-celebrate-dita-e-veres-in-albania-like-a-local/|website = Culture Trip|title  = How to Celebrate Dita e Verës in Albania Like a Local|last = Masotti|first = Francesca|date = 9 March 2018|accessdate = 29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The communist regime which ruled Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions, and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first [[state atheism|atheist state]]. Religious freedom returned to Albania following the regime's change in 1992. Albanian Sunni Muslims are found throughout the country, [[Albanian Orthodox Church|Albanian Orthodox Christians]] as well as [[Bektashi]]s are concentrated in the south, while Roman Catholics are found primarily in the north of the country.&lt;ref name="International Religious Freedom Report 2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90160.htm |title=Albania: International Religious Freedom Report 2007 |publisher=State.gov|date=14 September 2007 |accessdate=27 August 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 2011 census, 58.79% of Albania adheres to Islam, making it the largest religion in the country. The majority of Albanian Muslims are Sunni with a [[Bektashi]] minority. Christianity is practiced by 16.99% of the population, making it the second largest religion in the country. The remaining population is either [[irreligious]] or belongs to other religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instat.gov.al/media/177358/njoftim_per_media_-_fjala_e_drejtorit_te_instat_ines_nurja_per_rezultatet_finale_te_census_2011.pdf 2011 Albanian Census] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326091156/http://www.instat.gov.al/media/177358/njoftim_per_media_-_fjala_e_drejtorit_te_instat_ines_nurja_per_rezultatet_finale_te_census_2011.pdf |date=26 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before World War II, there was given a distribution of 70% Muslims, 20% Eastern Orthodox, and 10% Roman Catholics.&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/al.html |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |title=The World Factbook: Albania |accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Gallup Global Reports 2010 shows that religion plays a role in the lives of only 39% of Albanians, and ranks Albania the thirteenth least religious country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/128210/Gallup-Global-Reports.aspx |title=Gallup Global Reports |publisher=Gallup.com |date= |accessdate=25 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014034457/http://www.gallup.com/poll/128210/Gallup-Global-Reports.aspx |archivedate=14 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The results of the 2011 census, however, have been criticized as questionable on a number of grounds, and have been said to drastically underrepresent the number of Orthodox, Bektashi and irreligious Albanians, with problems including whole communities reporting that they had not been contacted, workers filling out questions without even asking the respondents and a drastic difference between the final results and the preliminary results with regard to religion (which showed over 70% declining to answer the question about religion).&lt;ref name="OrthDeclaration"&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Declaration: The results of the 2011 Census regarding the Orthodox Christians in Albania are totally incorrect and unacceptable|url=http://orthodoxalbania.org/old/index.php/eng/news/181-official-announcements/868-official-declaration|publisher=orthodoxalbania.org|accessdate=22 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714225100/http://orthodoxalbania.org/old/index.php/eng/news/181-official-announcements/868-official-declaration|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Concerns"&gt;{{cite news|title=Final census findings lead to concerns over accuracy |url=http://www.tiranatimes.com/news.php?id=14605&amp;cat=1 |publisher=Tirana Times |date=19 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006154703/http://www.tiranatimes.com/news.php?id=14605&amp;cat=1 |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.top-channel.tv/artikull.php?id=248098&amp;ref=ml Kisha Ortodokse: S’njohim censusin – Top Channel]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.gazetatema.net/web/2012/12/18/ak-i-ben-kerkese-zyrtare-nishanit-hiqi-urdhrin-e-skenderbeut-janullatosit/ |title=AK- Nishanit: Hiqi ‘Urdhrin e Skënderbeut’ Janullatosit, dekoro themeluesit e Kishës Autoqefale Shqiptare (LETRA) |work= GazetaTema.net |access-date= 14 May 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150516082020/http://www.gazetatema.net/web/2012/12/18/ak-i-ben-kerkese-zyrtare-nishanit-hiqi-urdhrin-e-skenderbeut-janullatosit/ |archive-date=16 May 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.gazetatema.net/web/2012/12/19/prifti-ne-shqiperi-ka-nje-axhende-antiortodokse/ |title=Prifti: Në Shqipëri ka një axhendë anti-ortodokse |work= GazetaTema.com |access-date= 14 May 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170729004347/http://www.gazetatema.net/web/2012/12/19/prifti-ne-shqiperi-ka-nje-axhende-antiortodokse/ |archive-date=29 July 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.gazetatema.net/web/2012/12/19/intervista-vangjel-dule-autoret-e-censusit-manipulatore-te-realitetit-rezoluta-came-historia-nuk-ribehet/ |title=INTERVISTA/ Vangjel Dule: Autorët e censusit, manipulatorë të realitetit.

For part of its history, [[History of the Jews in Albania|Albania has also had a Jewish community]]. Members of the Jewish community were saved by a group of Albanians during the Nazi occupation.&lt;ref name="Sarner1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Sarner|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many left for Israel c. 1990–1992 when the borders were opened after the fall of the communist regime, but about 200 Jews still live in Albania.

=== Literature ===

A modest amount of literature written by early Albanians was about religious themes.&lt;ref name="Elsie4"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known use of written Albanian is a [[Formula e pagëzimit|baptismal formula]] (1462) written by the Archbishop of Durrës [[Paulus Angelus]].&lt;ref name="Elsie5"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1555, a Catholic clergyman [[Gjon Buzuku]] from the Shestan region published the earliest known book written in Albanian titled ''[[Meshari]]'' (The Missal) regarding Catholic prayers and rites containing archaic medieval language, lexemes and expressions obsolete in contemporary Albanian.&lt;ref name="Elsie914"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=9–14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Christian clergy such as [[Luca Matranga]] in the Arbëresh diaspora published (1592) in the Tosk dialect while other notable authors were from northern Albanian lands and included [[Pjetër Budi]], [[Frang Bardhi]], and [[Pjetër Bogdani]].&lt;ref name="Elsie1417212430"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=14–21, 24–30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With the conversion to Islam of many Albanians, Muslim poetic and other literary traditions were adopted giving rise to authors such as the ''[[Bejtexhinj]]'' (Albanian poets) and included individuals like [[Nezim Frakulla]], [[Hasan Zyko Kamberi]], [[Muhamet Kyçyku]], and brothers [[Shahin Frashëri|Shahin]] and [[Dalip Frashëri]].&lt;ref name="Elsie3643"/&gt; They compiled Albanian literature infused with expressions, language and themes stemming from the Middle East and their local socio-cultural environment.&lt;ref name="Elsie3643"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=36–43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Albanian literature was composed in the Arbëresh diaspora by individuals such as [[Giulio Variboba]], [[Nicola Chetta]], [[Giuseppe Schirò]], [[Giuseppe Serembe]], [[Girolamo de Rada]] and others relating to religious, secular, poetic and eventually patriotic themes like Skanderbeg.&lt;ref name="Elsie4464"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=44–64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 19th century ''Rilindja'' (Albanian national awakening), a corpus of Albanian literature with patriotic and other themes emerged calling for Albanian unity, self-determination and celebrating Albanian culture, language, legends and other figures of sociopoltical, cultural and historic importance.&lt;ref name="Elsie6593"/&gt; Figures who left their mark during this period were the poet brothers [[Naim Frashëri|Naim]] and [[Sami Frashëri]], [[Pashko Vasa]], [[Luigj Gurakuqi]] and others.&lt;ref name="Elsie6593"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=65–93}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Albanian independence (1912) until the advent of the Second World War marked a transition from patriotic and political Rilindja related literature to more distinctive, expressive and matured forms of Albanian literature, prose and poetry focusing upon additional themes of contemporary life.&lt;ref name="Elsie94161"/&gt; [[Andon Zako Çajupi]], [[Ndre Mjeda]], [[Faik Konitza]], [[Fan Noli]] who translated many foreign works into Albanian, [[Gjergj Fishta]] who composed the epic the ''[[The Highland Lute|Highland Lute]]'', [[Ernest Koliqi]], modernist poets [[Migjeni]] and [[Lasgush Poradeci]] and others.&lt;ref name="Elsie94161"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=94–161}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Albania, post World War Two emerged as a communist state and Socialist realism became part of the literary scene.&lt;ref name="Elsie162196"/&gt;  Authors and poets emerged such as [[Sejfulla Malëshova]], [[Dritero Agolli]] and [[Ismail Kadare]] who has become an internationally acclaimed novelist and others who challenged the regime through various sociopolitical and historic themes in their works.&lt;ref name="Elsie162196"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=162–196}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Camaj]] wrote in the diaspora while in neighbouring Yugoslavia, the emergence of Albanian cultural expression resulted in sociopolitical and poetic literature by notable authors like [[Adem Demaçi]], [[Rexhep Qosja]], [[Jusuf Buxhovi]].&lt;ref name="Elsie185186199205"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=185–186, 199–205}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Albanian literary scene at the beginning of the 21st century remains vibrant producing new novelists, authors, poets and other writers.&lt;ref name="Elsie19208211"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=196, 208–211}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===

[[Music of Albania|Albanian folk music]]  displays a variety of influences. Albanian folk music traditions differ by region, with major stylistic differences between the traditional music of the [[Ghegs]] in the north and [[Tosks]] in the south. Modern popular music has developed around the centers of [[Korca]], [[Shkodër]] and [[Tirana]]. Since the 1920s, some composers such as [[Fan S. Noli]] have also produced works of Albanian [[classical music]].

'''Arthur Wilton Brown''' (born 24 June 1942)&lt;ref&gt;Marshall 2005, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; is an English [[rock music|rock]] singer and songwriter best known for his flamboyant theatrical performances, and his powerful, wide-ranging operatic voice. He has been a significant influence on a wide range of musicians due to his operatic vocal style, wild stage persona and concepts, and is considered a pioneer of [[shock rock]] and [[progressive rock]] and influential on [[heavy metal music]].

Brown has been lead singer of various groups, most notably [[the Crazy World of Arthur Brown]] and [[Kingdom Come (British band)|Kingdom Come]], followed by a varied solo career as well as associations with [[Hawkwind]], [[the Who]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Klaus Schulze]] and [[Frank Zappa]]. He is best known for his 1968 single "[[Fire (Arthur Brown song)|Fire]]", reaching number one in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and Canada, and number two on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/all_the_no1_songs.php?show=2 |title=Official UK Singles Top 100 – 16th February 2013 &amp;#124; Official UK Top 40 &amp;#124; music charts &amp;#124; Official Singles Chart |publisher= |date= |accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of the single "Fire", the press would often refer to Brown as "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|The God of Hellfire]]",{{sfn|Echard|2005|p=43}} in reference to the opening shouted line of the song, a moniker that exists to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Unterberger, Richie. ''Urban Spacemen and Wayfaring Strangers'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Brown was born in Whitby where his parents ran a guest house. After attending [[Roundhay School|Roundhay Grammar School]] in [[Leeds]], Yorkshire, he attended the [[University of London]] and the [[University of Reading]]&lt;ref name="Larkin"&gt;Larkin, C., ''Virgin Encyclopedia of Sixties Music'' (Muze UK Ltd, 1997), {{ISBN|0-7535-0149-X}}, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; and studied philosophy and law, but he gravitated to music instead, forming his first band, Blues and Brown, while at Reading.&lt;ref name="Larkin" /&gt; After a spell fronting a number of bands in London, Brown then moved to Paris in 1966, where he worked on his theatrical skills.&lt;ref name="Larkin" /&gt; During this period he recorded two songs for the [[Roger Vadim]] film of the [[Émile Zola]] novel ''[[La Curée]]''.&lt;ref name="Larkin" /&gt; Returning to London around the turn of 1966 to 1967, he was a temporary member of a London-based [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]]/soul/[[ska]] group [[the Ramong Sound]] that would soon become the hit-making soul group [[the Foundations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2012_01_01_archive.html|title=Arthur Brown interview about Crazy World &amp; Kingdom Come|website=It's Psychedelic Baby|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Crazy World of Arthur Brown===
By the time the Foundations had been signed to [[Pye Records]], Brown had left the group to form his own band, [[the Crazy World of Arthur Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alan-warner.com/10102/info.php?p=5&amp;pno=0 |title=Guitarist/Composer |publisher=Alan Warner |date= |accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band included [[Vincent Crane]] ([[Hammond organ]] and piano), Drachen Theaker (drums), and Nick Greenwood (bass). Brown quickly earned a reputation for outlandish performances, which included the use of a burning metal helmet, that led to occasional mishaps, such as during an early appearance at the Windsor Festival in 1967, where he wore a colander on his head soaked in methanol. The fuel poured over his head by accident caught fire; a bystander doused the flames by pouring beer on Brown's head, preventing any serious injury.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall 2005, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The flaming head then became an Arthur Brown signature. On occasion he also stripped naked while performing, most notably at the Palermo Pop 70 Festival in Sicily, Italy, July 1970, where he was arrested and deported.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall 2005, pp. 94–101.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also notable for the extreme make-up he wore onstage, which would later be reflected in the stage acts of [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]].&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RS"/&gt; He was also famed for his powerful operatic baritone voice and his high pitched screams.

By 1968, the debut album, ''[[The Crazy World of Arthur Brown (album)|The Crazy World of Arthur Brown]]'' became a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. Produced by [[the Who]]'s manager [[Kit Lambert]], and executive-produced by [[Pete Townshend]] on Track Records, the label begun by Lambert and [[Chris Stamp]], it spun off an equally surprising hit single, "[[Fire (Arthur Brown song)|Fire]]", and contained a version of "[[I Put a Spell on You]]" by [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]], a similarly bizarre showman. "Fire" sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].&lt;ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"&gt;{{Cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins| location= London| page= 236| isbn= 0-214-20512-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song has since seen its opening line "I am the God of Hellfire" [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] in numerous other places, most notably in [[the Prodigy]]'s 1992 rave anthem "[[Fire/Jericho|Fire]]".&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RS"/&gt;

In the late 1960s, the Crazy World of Arthur Brown's popularity was such that the group shared bills with [[the Who]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[the Mothers of Invention]], [[the Doors]], [[the Small Faces]], and [[Joe Cocker]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Richie Unterberger (2014). "Urban Spacemen &amp; Wayfaring Strangers [Revised &amp; Expanded Ebook Edition]: Overlooked Innovators &amp; Eccentric Visionaries of '60s Rock". BookBaby&lt;/ref&gt; Theaker was replaced because of his [[aviophobia]] in 1968 by drummer [[Carl Palmer]], later of [[Atomic Rooster]] and [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]], for the band's second American tour in 1969, on which keyboardist Vincent Crane also left – although he soon returned.&lt;ref name="Larkin" /&gt; However, Crane and Palmer eventually left in June 1969 to form [[Atomic Rooster]], spelling the end for the Crazy World of Arthur Brown.&lt;ref name="Larkin" /&gt;

===Arthur Brown's Kingdom Come===
Though Brown never released another recording as commercially successful as "Fire", he worked with a varied group of musicians on projects called Strangelands, Puddletown Express, and (briefly) the [[Captain Beefheart]]-influenced Rustic Hinge, before releasing three albums with his new band [[Kingdom Come (British band)|Kingdom Come]] in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Larkin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall 2005, pp. 106–111.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Arthur Brown's Kingdom Come has no link with the American/German [[Kingdom Come (band)|hard-rock/glam band of the same name]].|group=N}} 

[[File:EMS VCS 3 synthesizer (1969, SN 297) &amp; DK-1 keyboard (1969), Musée de la Musique de Paris.jpg|thumb|left|Victor Peraino used the [[EMS VCS 3]] synthesizer on the album ''[[Journey (Kingdom Come album)|Journey]]''.]]
The three Kingdom Come albums each have a distinctive character. The first was a highly complex concept album apparently on the theme of humanity living in a zoo and being controlled by cosmic, religious and commercial forces. The second was loosely on the theme of water, which Brown had declared four years earlier would be the subject of the second album by the Crazy World. It was musically more conventional than the first, much less heavy, though stranger in places. The third album, ''[[Journey (Kingdom Come album)|Journey]]'' (1973), recorded in [[Rockfield Studios]] in Wales, was a space rock album, with Brown playing an early [[drum machine]] and thereby replacing a series of drummers. The band also recorded three of its songs in a live [[Peel Session]] for the [[John Peel]] [[BBC Radio 1]] show on 25 September 1972.&lt;ref name="booklet1" /&gt; Richie Unterberger of [[Allmusic]] said that the album has been "most noted in retrospect as one of the first rock records to use a drum machine, which was still quite a novelty back in 1973."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/journey-mw0000320953|title=Journey – Arthur Brown's Kingdom Come, Arthur Brown – Songs, Reviews, Credits – AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown recalled "the whole album is based around the drum machine, and we had a lot of ideas that we wanted to explore using this technology.&lt;ref&gt;Journey (liner). Kingdom Come. Esoteric Recordings. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The drum machine they used was the Bentley Rhythm Ace, the British version of the FR-1.&lt;ref name="booklet1"&gt;{{cite AV media notes| title = Journey| others= Kingdom Come| year = 2003| type = liner| publisher = Castle Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage acts for all three albums featured a wild mix of special effects, dramatic costumes and colourful theatrics, which were sometimes controversial. Brown had declared when Kingdom Come was formed that the intention was to create a multi-media experience and the band always followed that policy. The concepts, the music and the theatrics proved very popular on the university circuit but proved too way-out for a mainstream audience. The band appeared at the 1971 [[Glastonbury Festival]] in Somerset, England and featured in the [[Glastonbury Fayre]] film which was shown in cinemas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/glasmenu.html |title=The Glastonbury Festival 1971 |publisher=Ukrockfestivals.com |date=1971-06-26 |accessdate=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
In later years, Brown released several solo albums. In 1975, he appeared in [[the Who]]'s rock opera movie ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]'' as "The Priest".&lt;ref name="Larkin" /&gt; Later that year he contributed vocals to the song "The Tell-Tale Heart" on the [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]]-based [[concept album]] ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination (Alan Parsons Project album)|Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]'' by [[the Alan Parsons Project]]. In 1979 and 1980, he collaborated with German electronic musician [[Klaus Schulze]], and can be heard on the albums ''[[Dune (Klaus Schulze album)|Dune]]'', ''[[...Live...]]'' and ''[[Time Actor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Mark (2009). "Analog Synthesizers: Understanding, Performing, Buying—From the Legacy of Moog to Software Synthesis". P. 150. CRC Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Brown moved to [[Austin, Texas]], where his wife came from, and obtained a master's degree in counselling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Return of the Hellfire God: Arthur Brown Is Back and Still Crazy After 47 Years|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/the-return-of-the-hellfire-god-arthur-brown-is-back-and-still-crazy-after-47-years-7930779|agency=LA Weekly|date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January 1987, Brown performed "Fire" on the "Flashback" segment of the television programme ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/solid-gold/solid-gold-87-show-16-w-chicago-385850/ |title=Solid Gold – Season 7, Episode 16: Solid Gold 87 Show 16 w/ Chicago |publisher=TV.com |date=5 February 2008 |accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with former [[The Mothers of Invention|Mothers of Invention]] drummer [[Jimmy Carl Black]], he also became a painter and carpenter for some years,&lt;ref name="Larkin" /&gt; and released an album with him, ''Brown, Black &amp; Blue'' (1988). In 1992, Brown and fellow counsellor Jim Maxwell founded Healing Songs Therapy, a service that culminated in Brown creating a song for each client about their emotional issues.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall 2005, pp. 204–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arthur Brown.jpg|thumb|right|Arthur Brown playing at the [[Wickerman Festival]], 2005]]

Brown returned to England in 1996. In 1997, he re-recorded "Fire" with German band [[Die Krupps]], while in 1998, he provided a spoken-word performance on [[Bruce Dickinson]]'s ''[[The Chemical Wedding (Bruce Dickinson album)|The Chemical Wedding]]'' album, reading a portion of three poems by [[William Blake]], and appeared as Satan in Dickinson's music video for "Killing Floor". He was narrator for [[the Pretty Things]]' live performance of their album ''[[S. F. Sorrow]]'' (1998) at [[Abbey Road Studios]]. He also appeared on television, guesting on [[Kula Shaker]] track "Mystical Machine Gun" several times during 1999.

A further change of musical direction occurred, when he formed an acoustic band and went on tour with [[Tim Rose]] in 1999. This band then added Stan Adler (cello and bass) and [[Malcolm Mortimore]] (percussion) and produced the album ''Tantric Lover'' (2000). However, the lineup did not last, and Brown put a new band together with guitarist Rikki Patten and multi-instrumentalist [[Nick Pynn]]. In 2002, Brown was asked to support [[Robert Plant]] on his Dreamland Tour. By now Patten had been replaced by guitarist Chris Bryant. Brown was getting some more media exposure now. His band was briefly called the Giant Pocket Orchestra, and also Instant Flight. In the middle of this, in 2003, Brown released ''Vampire Suite'' (2003), an album with Josh Philips and [[Mark Brzezicki]] of the band [[Big Country]], released on Ian Grant's [[Track Records]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allmusic.com/album/vampire-suite-mw0000321481 "Vampire Suite"]. AllMusic. Retrieved 4 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Also around this time, Brown's back catalogue was re-released by [[Sanctuary Records]].
[[File:The Crazy World of Arthur Brown (15396473559).jpg|thumb|left|The Crazy World of Arthur Brown at Musicport in [[Whitby]], England in 2014]]
Brown reunited the surviving members of Kingdom Come (except Des Fisher) in 2005, for a one-off concert at The Astoria in London, performing material from Kingdom Come's album ''Galactic Zoo Dossier'', with an encore of "Spirit of Joy". This show won Brown the 'Showman of the Year' award from ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine, with Brown receiving the award at the [[Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards]] ceremony held in London's [[Café de Paris (London)|Café de Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards: Winners Announced|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/classic-rock-roll-of-honour-awards-winners-announced/|agency=Blabbermouth|date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Brown and Pynn released ''Voice of Love'' on the Côte Basque record label, featuring a number of original recordings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-voice-of-love-mw0000484861 "The Voice of Love"]. AllMusic. Retrieved 2 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, during a concert in [[Lewes]], East Sussex, England, Brown once again set fire to his own hair. While trying to extinguish the flames, Phil Rhodes, a member of the band also caught fire. Brown carried on after the fire was put out; he had however lost a few chunks of hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.sussexexpress.co.uk/news/God-of-Hellfire-Arthur-Brown.3160077.jp |title=God of Hellfire Arthur Brown burnt in stage stunt – Local |publisher=''Sussex Express'' |date=30 August 2007 |accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared as a priest in the [[music video|video]] for [[The Darkness (band)|the Darkness]] song, "[[Is It Just Me?]]". In 2009, a roll-out re-release of Brown's back catalogue was commenced by [[Cherry Red Records]]' subsidiary Lemon Recordings and continued from 2010 onwards on their sister label [[Esoteric Recordings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cherryredlicensing.co.uk/cherry-red-are-proud-to-be-the-custodians-of-arthur-browns-catalogue/ "Cherry Red are proud to be the custodians of Arthur Brown’s catalogue!"].

In 2010, Brown played a set at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in the Glade. On 10 June 2011, days before his 69th birthday, he played at the [[Ray Davies]] [[Meltdown (festival)|Meltdown Festival]] at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]], London where he invited [[Z-Star]] to duet with him. Six weeks later, again in London, he played the [[High Voltage Festival]]; the gig was recorded and released (on vinyl only) as ''The Crazy World of Arthur Brown Live at High Voltage''. In 2012, Brown and Rick Patten released ''The Magic Hat'' alongside a comic of the same title by [[Matt Howarth]] – a curious, cross-dimensional adventure facilitated by a flaming helmet. In 2013, as the result of a successful pledge campaign on [[PledgeMusic]], Brown released the album "Zim Zam Zim" based on the cosmos having recorded it in his [[yurt]] in [[Lewes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4148135-the-life-of-arthur-brown-and-zim-zam-zim |title=The Life of Arthur Brown and 'Zim Zam Zim' |last=Whyte |first=Woodrow |date=29 August 2014 |website=[[Drowned in Sound]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 July 2017, the Crazy World of Arthur Brown performed at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]'s Elgar Room.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.royalalberthall.com/about-the-hall/news/2017/july/in-pictures-the-crazy-world-of-arthur-brown-wreak-havoc-in-the-elgar-room/ "In pictures: The Crazy World of Arthur Brown wreak havoc in the Elgar Room"].

==Influence==
{{quote box
| quote = Almost 50 years ago, musical icon Arthur Brown stepped out on stage, five-foot tall flames leaping from his head, and uttered one of rock music’s most stirring lines: “I am the God of Hellfire.” At that point, the British theatrical rocker who brought us [[the Crazy World of Arthur Brown]] in '68 had no way of knowing that he would come to be seen as a major pioneer in not only progressive rock and heavy metal, but the entire concept of what makes a stage show. He’s influenced generations of musicians who searched for an edge, from [[King Diamond]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], and [[Peter Gabriel]] to [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], [[Rob Halford]], and [[Alice Cooper]].

Brown's voice, and in particular his high banshee screams, are a precursor to the banshee screaming of many later [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] singers, and his theatrical concepts and stage presence such as the face makeup, especially his black and white face paint ([[corpse paint]]), voodoo dancing, and flaming helmet pioneered a lot of what was to become [[shock rock]] and [[progressive rock]].&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miles|first1=Barry|title=The British Invasion: Arthur Brown|date=2009|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.,|page=274|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r8xbaIlrUREC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;dq=arthur+brown+black+and+white+face+paint&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi52bri66_YAhVsBcAKHTphAwcQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third and final Kingdom Come album, ''[[Journey (Kingdom Come album)|Journey]]'' (1973), is noteworthy for being one of the first rock albums to feature a [[drum machine]], especially on the track "Time Captives".&lt;ref&gt;Marshall 2005, pp. 121–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hawkwind association==
Brown has had a number of associations with [[Hawkwind]]. In 1973, he was one of the performers on [[Robert Calvert]]'s album ''[[Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters]]'', together with a number of other Hawkwind members.&lt;ref name="Hawkwind"/&gt;

In 2001 and 2002, Brown made several guest appearances at live Hawkwind concerts, subsequently touring with them as a guest vocalist. On their December 2002 tour, Hawkwind played several songs by Brown from the Kingdom Come era, along with "Song of the Gremlin", which Brown had sung on ''[[Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters]]''; this was documented on the Hawkwind DVD ''[[Hawkwind videography#Out of the Shadows|Out of the Shadows]]''.&lt;ref name="Hawkwind"&gt;[https://www.allmusic.com/album/captain-lockheed-and-the-starfighters-mw0000201272 "Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters"].

'''Atima Srivastava''' (born 1961 in Mumbai, India) is an author and director who lives in London. She has written [[short stories]], authored two books, and has done multiple film directing and editing projects. Srivastava has won several awards for her work in film and literature. She also teaches and designs creative writing programs in universities throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="paddy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paddyfield.com.hk/authors/atimasrivastava/author.html |title=Atima Srivastava |publisher=Paddyfield.com.hk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Atima Srivastava was born in [[Mumbai]], India in 1961. When she was eight years old, she moved to London with her family, where she still lives today.

==Education==
Srivastava attended the Moat Mount School, now the [[Mill Hill County High School]], in the 1970s. In 1980 she entered the [[University of Essex]] where she earned her bachelor's degree in 1983.&lt;ref name="brit"&gt;{{cite web|author=British Council |url=http://literature.britishcouncil.org/atima-srivastava |title=Atima Srivastava &amp;#124; British Council Literature |publisher=Literature.britishcouncil.org |date=2014-05-19 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Writing===
Srivastava wrote her first novel, ''Transmission'', in 1992. The story follows a young semi-autobiographibcal Anglo-Indian woman named Angie, who, much like Srivastava, works as a film producer. The book focuses on the relationships that Angie has with her parents, an old-fashioned and authoritarian Indian couple, and with Lol and Kathi, an [[HIV]]-positive couple about whom she wants to make a documentary and with whom she has a romantic affair. The title comes from the book's examination of several forms of transmission, the transmission of Indian culture and lifestyle into modern London and of sexually transmitted diseases.

In 2000 Srivastava published her second book, ''Looking for Maya''. The plot tells of another young Anglo-Indian woman, Mira, who works as an author in London. Mira is forced to overcome issues of identity, love, tradition, and modernity as she attempts to find meaning while switching from one romantic entanglement to another.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt; Both novels have [[protagonist]]s who, instead of spiralling into an existential identity crisis over nationality and culture choose to focus on minor events in the characters' lives and their relation to a greater pursuit for love, success, and happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atimasrivastava.bookchums.com/ |title=Atima Srivastava Author of Transmission (90s),Books,Bio,Short Stories, Novels, Read Books of Atima |publisher=Atimasrivastava.bookchums.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Srivastava also written several short stories which have been published in anthologies such as ''New Writing 2001'', ''Well-Sorted'', and ''Tran-Lit''.

She is working on a third novel titled ''The Non-Resident Indian''.&lt;ref name="paddy" /&gt;

===Film and theatre===
Since 1985, Srivastava has worked as a film editor and director. In 1993 she helped produce a TV documentary ''Moving Pictures'' which is a journalism series reporting on global cinema.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3350703/&lt;/ref&gt; She also has written three TV-movie screenplays, ''Dancing in the Dark'' and ''The Legendary Vindaloo'' for Channel 4, and ''Camden Story'' for the BBC. In addition, the [[National Theatre Company]] commissioned her to write a play titled ''Why Not Love?'' which premiered in 2001.&lt;ref name="paddy" /&gt;

===Teaching===
Srivastava has done a significant amount of work as a lecturer and curriculum designer for both British and European universities. In 2000 she  worked as  a lecturer at the New York University-London program where she taught creative writing and at CAPA International Education where she taught a course called Writing the City in addition to creative writing. She also taught various writing and film technique and development courses at IES Abroad between 2002 and 2007 and taught creative writing at the [[University of Greenwich]] from 2007 to 2009.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt; 
Her books have been studied at universities in Poland, Spain, and Russia.

She was also the British author-in-residence at the Universities of Singapore, Sophia in Bulgaria, Mumbai, Berne, Cologne, Mainz, Ewha in Seoul, Connecticut College (USA) and Warwick University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fie.org.uk/london/londonfaculty/atima_srivastava/ |title=London Faculty &amp;#124; FIE: Foundation for International Education |publisher=FIE |date= |accessdate=2014-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222035526/http://www.fie.org.uk/london/londonfaculty/atima_srivastava/ |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

Jiang was released on May 2, 2013, after a plea agreement in which he admitted guilt to a single charge of misuse of Federal office equipment to download copyrighted movies, television shows and pornography.&lt;ref name="Pilot-May2013" /&gt;

==Arrest and Plea Bargain==
On March 28, 2013, a U.S. Judge ordered Jiang released after a federal prosecutor acknowledged there was no evidence that he possessed any sensitive, secret or classified material.&lt;ref name=Hamptonroads.com&gt;{{cite web|last=Sizemore|first=Bill|title=Chinese ex-NASA worker to be released pending trial|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2013/03/chinese-exnasa-worker-be-released-pending-trial|publisher=Hamptonroads|accessdate=28 March 2013|date=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2013, prosecutors dropped a felony charge of lying to federal investigators.&lt;ref name=NIA&gt;{{cite web|title=NIA STATEMENT ON THE RELEASE OF DR.

In his plea agreement, Jiang acknowledged violating a NASA regulation governing use of government office equipment by downloading copyrighted movies, television shows and sexually explicit images on the NASA-owned laptop.&lt;ref name="Pilot-May2013" /&gt;

On October 26, 2015 Congressman John Culberson announced the indictment of two Langley Research Center supervisors, accusing them of complicity in "espionage" in the affair.&lt;ref name=Culberson&gt;{{cite web|last=Culberson|first=John|title=Culberson Reaction to Indictment of NASA Supervisors|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=47156 |publisher=SpaceRef|accessdate=29 Oct 2015|date=29 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However no evidence of espionage was ever presented.

'''Carroll Ashmore Campbell Jr.''' (July 24, 1940{{spaced ndash}}December 7, 2005), was an American [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] politician who served as the [[List of Governors of South Carolina|112th Governor of South Carolina]] from 1987 to 1995. Prior to this, he served as a member of the [[South Carolina Senate]] representing the 2nd district from 1977 to 1978 and as a congressman representing [[South Carolina's 4th congressional district]] from 1979 to 1987.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], the oldest of six children. His father, Carroll Campbell Sr., worked in the textile mills and the furniture business, and later owned a [[motel]] in [[Garden City, South Carolina]].

Campbell grew up in Greenville and the nearby small towns of [[Liberty, South Carolina|Liberty]] and [[Simpsonville, South Carolina|Simpsonville]]. He attended Greenville Senior High School, dropping out during a period that ''[[The Greenville News]]'' characterized as an "unsettled adolescence amid a disintegrating family";{{ref|obit}} his uncle then enrolled him at the [[Private school|private]] [[McCallie School]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], [[Tennessee]].  He attended the [[University of South Carolina]] at [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] but withdrew because of financial concerns{{ref|obit}} and later graduated with a [[Master of Arts]] degree from [[American University]].{{ref|GBPL}}  While a student at South Carolina, he became a member of the Sigma chapter of the [[Pi Kappa Phi]] [[fraternity]].

==Early political career==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
Campbell served in the [[South Carolina House of Representatives]] from 1970 to 1974 during the administration of Governor [[John C. West]], who defeated Republican nominee [[Albert Watson (South Carolina)|Albert Watson]], the choice of [[U.S. Senator]] [[Strom Thurmond]], in the 1970 [[general election]].  With [[Lee Atwater]] as a key political strategist, he made an unsuccessful bid for [[Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina|lieutenant governor]] in 1974 on the [[Ticket (politics)|ticket]] headed by Republican [[James B. Edwards]] of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. While Edwards was elected, Campbell lost to the Democrat [[W. Brantley Harvey, Jr.|Brantley Harvey]]; despite the loss Campbell would continue to seek Atwater's counsel throughout his career.

From 1976 to 1978, during the Edwards administration, he served in the [[South Carolina Senate]]. In between his two stints in the [[South Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]], he served as executive assistant to Governor Edwards.  In 1978, Campbell won election to the [[United States House of Representatives]] from the Greenville-based [[South Carolina's 4th congressional district]]; he defeated [[Max Heller]], the Democratic mayor of Greenville and an emigrant from [[Austria]], to fill the seat vacated by the retiring [[James Robert Mann (South Carolina)|James Mann]]. Campbell hence became the first Republican to hold the 4th district seat since [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction]].
Campbell served as state campaign chairman for [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|presidential campaign in 1980]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 1984|1984]], and as southern regional chairman for [[George Herbert Walker Bush]]'s [[U.S. presidential election, 1988|presidential campaign in 1988]].

==Governor of South Carolina (1987-1995)==

[[File:Campbell, Carroll post-hurricane Hugo.jpg|thumb|Gov. Campbell tours the wreckage after Hurricane Hugo|left]]
As governor, Campbell coordinated the state's response to [[Hurricane Hugo]] in 1989.  Campbell was also known for his role in luring [[BMW#Production outside Germany|BMW]] to build its first U.S. manufacturing facility in [[Greer, South Carolina|Greer]], South Carolina.  In recognition of his role, in 2002 it was announced that BMW had donated $10&amp;nbsp;million for a facility at the site of [[Clemson University]]’s International Center for Automotive Research.{{ref|BMW}} Like nearly all such large donations, it came with [[naming rights]]: the company chose to call the new facility the Carroll A. Campbell Jr. Graduate Engineering Center.

When Campbell was governor, the state was confronted with two major controversies shaking taxpayers' confidence in the trustworthiness of public officials.  Allegations of financial mismanagement at the University of South Carolina led to university president [[James B. Holderman]]'s resignation.  [[Operation Lost Trust]], a federal investigation of bribery and drug use allegations against members of the South Carolina legislature, led to convictions of twenty-seven legislators, lobbyists and others in a vote-buying scandal.{{ref|losttrust}}

During 1993–1994, Campbell was the chairman of the [[National Governors Association]].

[[Term limit]]s prevented him from seeking a third term in the [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1994|1994 election]]. He left office with an unprecedented job approval rating of 72 percent.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Subsequent career==
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2017}}
From 1995 to 2001, Campbell was a Washington, D.C. [[lobbying|lobbyist]], serving as president and CEO of the [[American Council of Life Insurers]]. Campbell briefly considered running for [[U.S. President]] in [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996]], but concluded that the fundraising hurdles were too high.

Following his decision not to run for president that year, Campbell was mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate for [[Bob Dole]] but was ultimately passed over in favor of [[Jack Kemp]], the former U.S. Representative from [[New York's 31st congressional district]] and later the [[United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]] under the first President Bush.{{ref|nationalreview}}

In 1998, Campbell and former South Carolina [[First Lady]] [[Lois Rhame West]] became the co-chairs of [[Winthrop University]]'s first [[capital campaign]]. Under Campbell and West, the campaign raised more than $30 million.&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite news|first=Dan|last=O'Mara|title=Winthrop alum Lois Rhame West, former SC first lady and 'bright light', dies|url=http://www.heraldonline.com/2014/05/06/5936413/winthrop-alum-lois-rhame-west.html|work=[[The Herald (Rock Hill)]]|date=2014-05-06|accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2017}}
[[File:Carroll A Campbell.jpg|thumb|Campbell during his time in Congress]]
Campbell eloped with [[Iris Campbell|Iris Faye Rhodes]] in 1959.{{ref|obit}} They had two sons, Carroll Campbell III, and Mike Campbell, the former of whom unsuccessfully sought the 2010 Republican nomination for SC's [[South Carolina's 1st congressional district|1st congressional district]] to succeed Representative [[Henry E. Brown, Jr.|Henry Brown]]; and the latter of whom was an unsuccessful candidate for Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina in 2006. The family owns franchises for [[Wendy's]] restaurants in South Carolina.

In October 2001, aged 61, Campbell was diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. The revelation forced him to abandon plans to run for governor again in [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 2002|2002]]. He was admitted to a long-term residential treatment facility for Alzheimer's patients in August 2005. He died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on December 7, 2005 at Lexington Medical Center in [[West Columbia, South Carolina|West Columbia]]. After [[lying in state]] at the [[South Carolina State House|State House]], he was eulogized at memorial services at [[Trinity Episcopal Cathedral (Columbia, South Carolina)|Trinity Episcopal Cathedral]] in Columbia and at All Saints Episcopal Church in [[Pawleys Island, South Carolina|Pawleys Island]]. He was buried in the church cemetery of All Saints Episcopal Church.{{ref|obit}}

Upon Campbell's death, [[David Wilkins]], U.S. Ambassador to Canada and former [[Speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives|Speaker]] of the [[South Carolina House of Representatives]], described him as "the master architect" of the South Carolina Republican Party's speedy rise to dominance.{{ref|obit}}

'''Cosimo Commisso''' (born 6 February 1950 in Siderno), also known as "the quail" ("'u quagghia"), is an [[Italy|Italian]] criminal and a member of the [['Ndrangheta]], a mafia-type organization in [[Calabria]]. He belongs to and was the boss of the [[Commisso 'ndrina]] based in [[Siderno]] with his cousin [[Antonio Commisso]] and his brother Rocco Commisso.&lt;ref name=np300705&gt;[http://www.canada.com/national/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=9af45529-0622-4e8e-be40-ebfc4c7a4f2b Back to the 'wolves'], National Post July 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/03/26/drug-smuggling-mobsters-used-retired-police-dogs-to-help-secure-cargo-court-hears.html|title=Drug-smuggling mobsters used retired police dogs to help secure cargo, court hears|publisher=thestar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/world/alleged-toronto-area-mafia-leaders-named-as-suspects-in-massive-italian-crime-probe|title=Alleged Toronto-area Mafia leaders named as suspects in massive Italian crime probe|date=30 September 2015|publisher=nationalpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He took over the reins of the clan from his father [[Francesco Commisso]], who had been the right-hand man of the historical 'Ndrangheta boss of Siderno, [[Antonio Macrì]].&lt;ref name=np300705 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gds151210&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.gazzettadelsud.it/NotiziaArchivio.aspx?art=168190&amp;Edizione=7&amp;A=20101216 È Giuseppe "u mastru" il vero erede di Ntoni Macrì], Gazzetta del Sud, December 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early career ===

He claimed to have been a [[private (rank)|private]] in the [[United States Army]], where he taught boxing.&lt;ref name="jazz6970"&gt;{{cite book |title=Jazz Age: People and Perspectives |first=Mitchell |last=Newton-Matza |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MX6fLIDvWKUC&amp;pg=PA69 |pages=69–70|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date=2009|isbn=9781598840339}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Springer's early life, he "drummed up crowds for [[William Jennings Bryan]]'s tirades [[Prohibition in the United States|against demon rum]]" and was a [[sheet music]] vendor at [[Billy Sunday]]'s [[evangelical]] services.&lt;ref name="daytona"&gt;{{cite news |work=Daytona Beach Morning Journal |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=p4gfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lcsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=788,4132398&amp;dq=zzyzx&amp;hl=en |title=Improbable Name, But... Zzyzx is a Booming Health Spa|first=Stephen V.|last=Roberts|date=19 July 1970|page=8B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[World War I]], Springer worked at a school in [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="jazz6970" /&gt; In the late 1920s, Springer moved to [[Chicago]], where he became involved with an automotive technical school called Greer College.&lt;ref name="jama"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bureau of Investigation: Curtis Howe Springer, A Quack and his Nostrums|journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]|date=14 September 1935|volume=105|issue=11|page=900|doi=10.1001/jama.1935.02760370056027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Springer was fired by 1930, and the school was forced into [[bankruptcy]] shortly afterward.&lt;ref name="jama" /&gt;

Throughout the 1930s, Curtis Springer gave lectures throughout the midwestern United States, claiming to either to be the "Dean of Greer College", or that he represented/attended the fictional institutions of the National Academy, The Springer School of Humanism, the American College of Doctors and Surgeons, the Westlake West Virginia College, and two non-existent [[osteopathy]] schools in [[Meyersdale, Pennsylvania]] and [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="jama" /&gt; Although all his lectures were "free", Springer would ask for [[donations]] part-way through his speech, and often attempt to sell audience members private courses in [[psychoanalysis]] for $25 per session.&lt;ref name="jama" /&gt; In advertisements for his appearances, he would often follow his name with [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], [[Naturopathy|N.D.]], [[D.O.]] or [[Ph.D.]]&lt;ref name="jama" /&gt;

Chicago was largely Springer's home base until the summer of 1934. After he applied for airtime on [[WGN-AM|WGN]] radio, the station contacted [[American Medical Association]]'s Bureau of Investigations for information regarding Springer.&lt;ref name="jama" /&gt; The AMA and [[Better Business Bureau]] quickly began to take note of his completely falsified education record.&lt;ref name="jama" /&gt; Before long, Springer had been labeled as a notorious fraud and doctor-impersonator by the medical community. An extensive article in the September 14, 1936 edition of ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' titled "Curtis Howe Springer: A [[Quackery|Quack]] and His Nostrums" detailed his exploits and lack of education.&lt;ref name="quack"&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Arthur Joseph |editor-last=Cramp |title=Nostrums and Quackery: Articles on the Nostrum Evil and Quackery Reprinted from the Journal of the American Medical Association, Volume 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6P1DAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=curtis+howe+springer&amp;dq=curtis+howe+springer&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UFiqTJa8IIu2sAOb-8HEAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBzgK|pages=162–164|publisher=American Medical Association Press|date=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jama" /&gt; The book concluded that "a most thorough search fails to show that Springer was ever graduated by any reputable college or university, medical or otherwise."&lt;ref name="quack" /&gt;

===Radio career===
Although denied airtime on WGN, he was successful in obtaining a twice-daily slot as a [[radio evangelist]] on Chicago's [[WCFL (AM)|WCFL]].&lt;ref name="jama" /&gt; He began broadcasting on the station in 1934. His programs were often an outlet for his support of [[Franklin Roosevelt]] and [[The New Deal]].&lt;ref name="jama" /&gt; In addition, he would often use the radio show to sell his "[[Snake oil|medicines]]", including the [[antacid]] Re-Hib (confirmed by the American Medical Association to be mostly [[baking soda]]) and Antediluvian Tea ("a crude mixture of [[laxative]] herbs").&lt;ref name="jama" /&gt;

Around 1935, Springer left Chicago and began preaching on [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="jazz6970" /&gt;

=== Health spas and Zzyzx ===
Springer's wife Mary encouraged him to try to launch a health spa and in 1931, he launched a resort called Haven of Rest in [[Fort Hill, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="jazz6970" /&gt; Only six years after it first opened, he lost Haven of Rest due to [[tax evasion|non-payment of taxes]].&lt;ref name="jazz6970" /&gt; He attempted to set up other resorts and gatherings in [[Wilkes-Barre]], [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]], and [[Mount Davis (Pennsylvania)|Mount Davis]] in Pennsylvania; [[Cumberland, Maryland]]; and [[Davenport, Iowa]].&lt;ref name="jama" /&gt;

[[File:SpringerSpaZzyzx.JPG|thumb|Remains of Springer's spa at Zzyzx, California.]]
In 1944, Springer and his new [[fiancée]] Helen filed a [[Land claims|mining claim]] on federal land to 12,800 acres (51.8&amp;nbsp;km²) in [[California]]'s [[Mojave Desert]], claiming a tract about 8 miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) long and 3 miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) wide.&lt;ref name="wordways" /&gt; The land contained the remains of an 1860 Army post and a railroad station on the defunct [[Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad]]. He named the settlement Zzyzx as a gimmick to ensure that it would be "the last word" in health. Zzyzx's original encampment consisted of 20 [[tent]]s, and he recruited [[homeless]] men from [[Los Angeles]]' [[Skid Row, Los Angeles|Skid Row]] to build simple concrete buildings.&lt;ref name="daytona" /&gt; Springer created an imitation [[hot springs]] – which he attempted to pass off as genuine – by using a [[boiler]] to heat several [[heat sink|pool]]s.&lt;ref name="weirdca"&gt;{{cite book

The "Boulevard of Dreams" was a divided parkway leading to an [[oasis]] on [[Lake Tuendae]], later identified as the habitat of the endangered [[Mohave chub]].&lt;ref name="wordways" /&gt; While building his retreat, he spent half the week in [[Los Angeles]], still recording his radio program, and rounding up workers to build his new resort by offering room and board at Zzyzx in exchange for labor.&lt;ref name="weirdca" /&gt;
[[File:DesertStudiesCenterMainBuildingMarch2010.JPG|thumb|left|Administrative building and chapel built by Springer at Zzyzx, California. Now the [[Desert Studies Center]] headquarters.]]
From Zzyzx, Springer continued his syndicated radio program, at one point carried by 221 stations in the United States and 102 more abroad, mixing religious music and his own [[radio evangelism]]. Along with this came his requests that listeners send him "donations" to get his special cures for everything from hair loss to cancer. The potions were actually little more than a blend of [[celery]], [[carrot]] and [[parsley]] juices.&lt;ref name="wordways" /&gt; The Zzyzx Springs experience itself included goat milk; allegedly life-prolonging "[[Antediluvian|Antedeluvian]] Tea"; a $25, self-administered [[hemorrhoid]] cure; more solicitations for "donations"; and a twice-daily sermon over the loudspeakers.&lt;ref name="weirdca" /&gt;

=== Legal challenges and imprisonment ===
By the late 1960s, Springer had begun marking off lots on the land and allowing "donors" of large sums of money to his ministry to build homes on the lots. This caught the attention of federal officials.&lt;ref name="weirdca" /&gt; While Springer had posted mining claims in the area, under the [[General Mining Law of 1872]], it was still public land until such time that he validated the claims for patent by proving to federal government geologists that the claim contained minerals that could be extracted at a profit.

The federal government took Springer to court claiming he was [[squatting]] on federal land.&lt;ref name="wordways" /&gt; In 1974, he was found guilty of the charge. He offered to pay $34,187 in back rent on the land to the [[United States Bureau of Land Management|Bureau of Land Management]], but the government refused the payment and evicted him and his few hundred local followers.&lt;ref name="weirdca" /&gt; Springer was also convicted for making false claims that the health foods he sold would cure everything "from sore toes to [[cancer]]."&lt;ref name="wordways" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lawrence" /&gt; He was represented in court by criminal attorney [[Gladys Root|Gladys Towles Root]]. In the trial, Springer was convicted of [[false advertising]]. He filed several appeals on this conviction, and two years later ended up serving 49 days of a 60-day sentence.

Following the eviction, in 1976, the [[Bureau of Land Management]] allowed the [[California State University]] to manage the facilities and land in and around Zzyzx.&lt;ref name="lawrence" /&gt; A consortium of colleges combined funds and resources to convert the former resort into a research station called the [[Desert Studies Center]];&lt;ref name="wordways" /&gt; schools contributing to the center included California State Universities at [[Cal State Dominguez Hills|Dominguez Hills]], [[Cal State Fullerton|Fullerton]], [[Cal State Los Angeles|Los Angeles]], [[Cal State Long Beach|Long Beach]], [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona|Pomona]] and [[Cal State Northridge|Northridge]].&lt;ref name="gadsden"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Gadsden Times]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SKkfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NtYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2753,2588027&amp;dq=zzyzx+curtis&amp;hl=en |title=Zzyzx getting new lease on life|date=18 November 1976|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his release from prison, Springer and his wife relocated to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]],&lt;ref name="latimes3" /&gt; where he spent the remainder of his life.&lt;ref name="lawrence" /&gt;

== Death ==
Curtis Springer died in Las Vegas on August 19, 1985, at the age of 88.&lt;ref name="weirdca" /&gt; He was buried in the [[Riverside National Cemetery]] in [[Riverside, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FAG|3850932}}&lt;!-- Data on the Find a Grave is from the US Veteran's Affairs Department &amp; confirmed via their gravesite locator tool. http://gravelocator.cem.va.gov/index.html --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Two publications, the journal ''[[Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics|Word Ways]]'' and the book ''[[Weird US|Weird California]]'', have incorrectly reported Springer's year of death as 1986.&lt;ref name="wordways" /&gt;&lt;ref name="weirdca" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2689">'''Daniel Mandl''' (April 20, 1891 &amp;ndash; March 23, 1945) was a [[civil engineer]], [[inventor]], and a student of [[anthroposophy]].

== Life ==
Daniel Mandl was born in [[Prostějov]], [[Moravia]]. He studied engineering at the [[University of Vienna]], [[Austria]]. During [[World War I]], he commanded an [[artillery]] unit of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], and fought in [[Albania]]. A decorated officer, he resumed his studies after World War I. Upon graduation, he was employed by the General Electrical Company in [[Berlin]]. He was involved in the [[electrification]] of [[Slovakia]], and he introduced the then-new technology of [[arc welding]] to [[Czechoslovakia]], making improvements to arc welding [[electrodes]]. He was a student of [[anthroposophy]].

After the annexation of rump Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany on March 15, 1939, Mandl held a teaching position in the Technical School founded by the [[Brno]] Jewish community. He was deported from [[Brno]] to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Terezin]] ([[Theresienstadt]] [[ghetto]] on March 31, 1942, together with his wife Hajnalka and his son Tommy ([[Herbert Thomas Mandl]]). In Terezin, Mandl worked in the Jewish self-administration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boerverlag.de/MANDL2.HTM Herbert Thomas Mandl's ''Die Wette des Philosophen'']&lt;/ref&gt;  He participated in the Jewish cultural life in the ghetto, delivering at least one lecture, titled "A Chapter from Some Thoughts On the History of Humanity," on June 23, 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://makarovainit.com/first.htm ''University over the Abyss'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandl and his son were deported from [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] to [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] on September 28, 1944. Unbeknownst to his son Tommy at the time, Tommy was the only one selected for the transport but his father volunteered to go with him. From [[Auschwitz]], the Mandls were transported, in turn, to several [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]-[[Kaufering concentration camp|Kaufering]] subcamps, where Mandl died March 23, 1945, a mere  six weeks before the end of [[World War II]] (cf. testimonies of his son, Herbert Thomas Mandl).

'''Diana Noel, 2nd Baroness Barham''' (18 September 1762-12 April 1823) was a [[peerage|peer]], philanthropist and an abolitionist who established schools and churches on the [[Gower Peninsula]].

==Early life==
Born on 18 September 1762 at [[Barham Court]], [[Teston]] in [[Kent]], her parents were Margaret (née Gambier) and [[Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham|Charles Middleton]],&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite web |title=Noel [formerly Edwardes; née Middleton], Diana, suo jure Baroness Barham |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-47112 |last=Carter |first=Grayson |work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=23 September 2004 |access-date=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[admiral]] who was created Baron Barham, of Barham Court and Teston in the [[Counties of England|County]] of Kent in May 1805.&lt;ref name="Middleton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burke1845"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Bernard Burke|title=A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZfdRAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA421|year=1845|publisher=H. Colburn|page=421}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were [[Calvinist Methodist]]s, whose friends included religious writer and philanthropist [[Hannah More]], cleric [[George Whitefield]], and politician and abolitionist [[William Wilberforce]].&lt;ref name="Gower Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lady Barham in Gower|journal=Gower journal of the Gower Society|volume=9|year=1956|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10107/1273335|author=Iorworth Hughes Jones|pages=2–3|via=Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru – The National Library of Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
She was married on 21 December 1780 to [[Sir Gerard Noel, 2nd Baronet|Gerard Edwardes]], who was a Cambridge-educated banker and [[member of parliament|member]] of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{acad|id=EDWS776GN|name=Edwards (post Noel), Gerald Noel}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1798, he inherited the estates of his uncle, [[Henry Noel, 6th Earl of Gainsborough]], and [[Name_change#Historical_usage|changed his surname]] to Noel.&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt; They had eighteen children,&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; one of whom, [[Baptist Wriothesley Noel]], stated that his parents' home "combined [[Whigs (British political party)|whig]] politics, evangelical devotion, aristocratic unconventionality, and strong-mindedness in a potent blend".&lt;ref name="LBSO" /&gt;

Gerard's estates, worth £20,800 a year and consisting of 15,000 acres, were put into trust due to the poor state of financial management by 1816.&lt;ref name="LBSO" /&gt;

==Baroness Barham==

Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. In 1741, at 53, he entered into a spiritual phase in which he began to experience dreams and visions, beginning on [[Easter]] Weekend, on 6 April 1744. It culminated in a 'spiritual awakening'
in which he received a revelation that he was appointed by the Lord Jesus Christ to write ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' to reform [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;See Swedenborg, E. [http://www.heavenlydoctrines.org/ ''The Heavenly Doctrine'']&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', the Lord had opened Swedenborg's spiritual eyes so that from then on, he could freely visit [[heaven]] and [[hell]] to converse with angels, demons and other spirits and the [[Last Judgment]] had already occurred the year before, in 1757.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/LJ.html Swedenborg, E.

For the last 28 years of his life, Swedenborg wrote 18 published theological works—and several more that were unpublished. He termed himself a "Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ" in ''True Christian Religion'',&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/tcrtc.html |title=The True Christian Religion, Containing the Universal Theology of The New Church Foretold by the Lord in Daniel 7; 13, 14; and in Revelation 21; 1, 2, by Emanuel Swedenborg |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he published himself.&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/books.html |title=Which of Swedenborg's books are Divine revelation? |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some followers of ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' believe that of his theological works, only those that were published by Swedenborg himself are fully [[divine revelation|divinely inspired]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/books.html "Which of Swedenborg's books are Divine revelation?"]&lt;/ref&gt;   Others have regarded all Swedenborg's theological works as equally inspired, saying for example that the fact that some works were "not written out in a final edited form for publication does not make a single statement less trustworthy than the statements in any of the other works." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Odhner |first1=Carl Theophilus |title="Diary" and the Spiritual Body |journal=New Church Life |date=1912 |page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Church of the New Jerusalem is a branch of Christianity that reveres Swedenborg's writings as Divinely inspired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/508967814|title=Reasons for separating from the old church. : In answer to a letter received from certain persons in Manchester, who profess to believe in the heavenly doctrines of the New Jerusalem Church, as contained in the theological writings of the Late Hon.

== Early life ==
[[File:Hornsgatan 43 Emanuel Swedenborg Stockholm 2005-06-17 013.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque at the former location of Swedenborg's house at Hornsgatan on [[Södermalm]], [[Stockholm]].]]

Swedenborg's father, [[Jesper Swedberg]] (1653–1735), descended from a wealthy mining family. The first known paternal ancestor was Otte Persson from Sundborn parish, mentioned 1571.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.riddarhuset.se/att/swedenborg/|title=Riddarhuset - Ätte- och vapendatabas - Swedenborg|last=|first=|date=2017-06-04|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He travelled abroad and studied theology, and on returning home, he was eloquent enough to impress the Swedish king, [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]], with his sermons in [[Stockholm]]. Through the king's influence, he would later become professor of theology at [[Uppsala University]] and Bishop of [[Skara]].&lt;ref name="Ugglan"&gt;{{sv icon}} [[Nordisk familjebok]], 2nd edition (Ugglan) ''[http://runeberg.org/nfcg/0486.html article Svedberg, Jesper]'' (1918)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enc1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911|first=Alexander James |last=Grieve|wstitle=Swedenborg, Emanuel |volume=26 |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesper took an interest in the beliefs of the dissenting Lutheran [[Pietism|Pietist]] movement, which emphasised the virtues of communion with [[God]] rather than relying on sheer faith (''[[sola fide]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Svedberg's pietistic interests are described in Bergquist (1999), pp. 230–232.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sola fide'' is a tenet of the [[Lutheran Church]], and Jesper was charged with being a [[pietist]] [[heresy|heretic]]. While controversial, the beliefs were to have a major impact on his son Emanuel's spirituality. Jesper furthermore held the unconventional belief that [[angels]] and [[spirit]]s were present in everyday life. This also came to have a strong impact on Emanuel.&lt;ref name="Ugglan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lamm (1978 [1915]; pp.1–19) notes how all Swedenborg biographies at that draw similarities between the beliefs of Jesper and Emanuel. Lamm himself partially agrees with them, but he maintains that there were marked differences between them too.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1703–1709, Swedenborg lived in [[Erik Benzelius the Younger]]'s house. Swedenborg completed his university course at [[Uppsala]] in 1709, and in 1710, he made his [[grand tour]] through the Netherlands, France and Germany before reaching London, where he would spend the next four years. It was also a flourishing center of scientific ideas and discoveries. Swedenborg studied [[physics]], [[mechanics]] and [[philosophy]] and read and wrote [[poetry]]. According to the preface of a book by the Swedish critic [[Olof Lagercrantz]], Swedenborg wrote to his benefactor and brother-in-law Benzelius that he believed that Swedenborg might be destined to be a great scientist.&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz, preface.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Delblanc&gt;x&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific period ==
[[File:Swdbg2.jpg|frame|The Flying Machine, sketched in his notebook from 1714. The operator would sit in the middle and paddle himself through the air.&lt;ref&gt;Söderberg, H. ''Swedenborg's 1714 Airplane: A Machine to Fly in the Air'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;32, or on the video clip at 5:48 on its timeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-k6HRf0E0g |title = Splendors of the Spirit: Swedenborg's Quest for Insight, Part 1 |publisher = YouTube |date = |accessdate = 2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1715 Swedenborg returned to Sweden, where he devoted himself to natural science and engineering projects for the next two decades. A first step was his meeting with King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] in the city of [[Lund]], in 1716. The Swedish inventor [[Christopher Polhem]], who became a close friend of Swedenborg, was also present. Swedenborg's purpose was to persuade the king to fund an [[observatory]] in northern Sweden. However, the warlike king did not consider this project important enough, but did appoint Swedenborg to be assessor-extraordinary on the [[Swedish Board of Mines]] (''Bergskollegium'') in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;The meeting between the King, Polhelm and Swedenborg is described in detail in Liljegren, Bengt, ''Karl XII i Lund : när Sverige styrdes från Skåne'', (Historiska media, Lund, 1999). {{ISBN|91-88930-51-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1716 to 1718, Swedenborg published a scientific periodical entitled ''Daedalus Hyperboreus'' (''"The Northern [[Daedalus]]"''), a record of mechanical and mathematical inventions and discoveries. One notable description was that of a flying machine, the same he had been sketching a few years earlier (see [[Flying Machine (Swedenborg)]]).&lt;ref name="Delblanc" /&gt;

In 1718, Swedenborg published an article that attempted to explain spiritual and mental events in terms of minute vibrations, or "tremulations".

Upon the death of Charles XII, [[Ulrike Eleonora of Sweden|Queen Ulrika Eleonora]] ennobled Swedenborg and his siblings. It was common in Sweden during the 17th and 18th centuries for the children of [[bishops]] to receive that honour, as a recognition of the services of their father. The family name was changed from Swedberg to Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp.114–115&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1724, he was offered the chair of [[mathematics]] at [[Uppsala University]], but he declined and said that he had dealt mainly with [[geometry]], [[chemistry]] and [[metallurgy]] during his career. He also said that he did not have the gift of eloquent speech because of a stutter, as recognized by many of his acquaintances; it forced him to speak slowly and carefully, and there are no known occurrences of his speaking in public.&lt;ref&gt;Berquist (1999), pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish critic Olof Lagerkrantz proposed that Swedenborg compensated for his impediment by extensive argumentation in writing.&lt;ref&gt;Proposed by Lagercrantz, also mentioned by Bergquist (1999), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New direction of studies ahead of his time ==
During the 1730s, Swedenborg undertook many studies of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]. He had the first known anticipation of the [[neuron]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;Fodstad, H. The neuron theory ''Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery'' 2001;77:20-4&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until a century later that science recognized the full significance of the nerve cell. He also had prescient ideas about the [[cerebral cortex]], the hierarchical organization of the [[nervous system]], the localization of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]], the functions of the [[pituitary gland]], the perivascular spaces, the [[foramen of Magendie]], the idea of [[somatotopic arrangement|somatotopic organization]], and the association of frontal brain regions with the intellect. In some cases, his conclusions have been experimentally verified in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Gordh, E.

''Handbook Clinical Neurology'' 2010;95:557-70&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1730s, Swedenborg became increasingly interested in spiritual matters and was determined to find a theory to explain how matter relates to spirit. Swedenborg's desire to understand the order and the purpose of creation first led him to investigate the structure of matter and the process of creation itself. In the ''[[The Principia (book)|Principia]]'', he outlined his philosophical method, which incorporated experience, geometry (the means by which the inner order of the world can be known) and the power of reason. He also outlined his cosmology, which included the first presentation of his [[nebular hypothesis]]. (There is evidence that Swedenborg may have preceded Kant by as much as 20 years in the development of that hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newchurchhistory.org/articles/glb2007/baker.pdf Baker, Gregory L. (1983) "Emanuel Swedenborg – An 18th century cosmologist" in ''The Physics Teacher'', October 1983, pp. 441–6] Retrieved 15 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 1735, in [[Leipzig]], he published a three-volume work, ''Opera philosophica et mineralis'' (''"Philosophical and mineralogical works''") in which he tried to conjoin philosophy and [[metallurgy]]. The work was mainly appreciated for its chapters on the analysis of the [[smelting]] of iron and copper, and it was the work that gave Swedenborg his international reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 142–155.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he also published the small manuscript ''de Infinito'' ("On the Infinite") in which he attempted to explain how the finite is related to the infinite and how the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is connected to the body. It was the first manuscript in which he touched upon such matters. He knew that it might clash with established theologies since he presented the view that the soul is based on material substances.&lt;ref&gt;Lamm (1987), pp. 42–43, notes that by assuming that the soul consists of matter, as Swedenborg did, one becomes a [[materialist]]. He further notes that it was also noted by contemporaries.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc &amp; Lönnroth, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; He also conducted dedicated studies of the fashionable philosophers of the time such as [[John Locke]], [[Christian von Wolff]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and [[Descartes]] and earlier thinkers such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Plotinus]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 165–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1743, at the age of 55, Swedenborg requested a leave of absence to go abroad. His purpose was to gather source material for ''Regnum animale'' (''The Animal Kingdom'', or ''Kingdom of Life''), a subject on which books were not readily available in Sweden. The aim of the book was to explain the soul from an anatomical point of view. He had planned to produce a total of 17 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc and Lönnroth, p.325.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Journal of Dreams'' ==
By 1744, Swedenborg had travelled to the Netherlands. Around the time, he began having strange dreams. Swedenborg carried a travel journal with him on most of his travels and did so on this journey. The whereabouts of the diary were long unknown, but it was discovered in the [[Royal Library of Sweden|Royal Library]] in the 1850s and was published in 1859 as ''Drömboken'', or ''Journal of Dreams''.

Swedenborg experienced many different dreams and visions, some greatly pleasurable, others highly disturbing.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist, pp. 200–208.&lt;/ref&gt; The experiences continued as he traveled to London to progress the publication of ''Regnum animale''. This process, which one biographer has proposed as cathartic and comparable to the [[Catholic]] concept of [[Purgatory]],&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; continued for six months. He also proposed that what Swedenborg was recording in his ''Journal of Dreams'' was a battle between the love of himself and the love of God.&lt;ref&gt;Analysis by Bergquist, p. 209. Bergquist has previously published a separate book commenting on the Journal called ''Swedenborgs drömbok : glädjen och det stora kvalet'' (Stockholm, Norstedt, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visions and spiritual insights ===
In the last entry of the journal from 26–27 October 1744, Swedenborg appears to be clear as to which path to follow. He felt that he should drop his current project and write a new book about the worship of God. He soon began working on ''De cultu et amore Dei'', or ''The Worship and Love of God''. It was never fully completed, but Swedenborg still had it published in London in June 1745.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 210–211.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1745, Swedenborg was dining in a private room at a tavern in London. By the end of the meal, a darkness fell upon his eyes, and the room shifted character. Suddenly, he saw a person sitting at a corner of the room, telling him: "Do not eat too much!". Swedenborg, scared, hurried home. Later that night, the same man appeared in his dreams. The man told Swedenborg that he was the Lord, that he had appointed Swedenborg to reveal the spiritual meaning of the Bible and that he would guide Swedenborg in what to write. The same night, the spiritual world was opened to Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Small Theological Works and Letters" by Emanuel Swedenborg. Edited and published by the Swedenborg Society (London, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scriptural commentary and writings ==
[[File:Arcana Caelestia 0001.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''[[Arcana Cœlestia]]'', first edition (1749), title page.]]

In June 1747, Swedenborg resigned his post as assessor of the board of mines. He explained that he was obliged to complete a work that he had begun and requested to receive half his salary as a pension.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 286–287.&lt;/ref&gt; He took up afresh his study of [[Hebrew]] and began to work on the spiritual interpretation of the Bible with the goal of interpreting the spiritual meaning of every verse. From sometime between 1746 and 1747 and for ten years henceforth, he devoted his energy to the task. Usually abbreviated as ''[[Arcana Cœlestia]]'' or under the [[Latin]] variant ''Arcana Caelestia''&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

Stephen McNeilly (London: Swedenborg Society, 2002), p. 1. Accessed 2010-11-11.&lt;/ref&gt; (translated as ''Heavenly Arcana'', ''Heavenly Mysteries'', or ''Secrets of Heaven'' depending on modern English-language editions), the book became his ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' and the basis of his further theological works.&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was anonymous, and Swedenborg was not identified as the author until the late 1750s. It had eight volumes, published between 1749 and 1756. It attracted little attention, as few people could penetrate its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonsson, Inge. ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc &amp; Lönnroth, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

His life from 1747 to his death was spent in Stockholm, the Netherlands and [[London]]. During the 25 years, he wrote another 14 works of a spiritual nature; most were published during his lifetime.

One of Swedenborg's lesser-known works presents a startling claim: that the Last Judgment had begun in the previous year (1757) and was completed by the end of that year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/LJ.html ''The Last Judgment and Babylon Destroyed. All the Predictions in the Apocalypse are At this Day Fulfilled from Things Heard and Seen''. From 'De Ultimo Judicio Et De Babylonia Destructa'']&lt;/ref&gt; and that he had witnessed it.&lt;ref&gt;''Last Judgment'', #60.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', the Last Judgment took place not in the physical world but in the World of Spirits, halfway between heaven and hell, through which all pass on their way to heaven or hell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/HH.html Swedenborg, E. ''Heaven and Its Wonders From Things Heard and Seen''] (Swedenborg Foundation 1946, #421–535).&lt;/ref&gt; The Judgment took place because the Christian church had lost its charity and faith, resulting in a loss of spiritual free will that threatened the equilibrium between heaven and hell in everyone's life.&lt;ref&gt;''Last Judgment'' #33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|For an extensive explanation of the inner spiritual sense of the book of the ''Apocalypse'', see Swedenborg, E. ''The Apocalypse Revealed Wherein are Disclosed the Arcana Foretold Which Have Hitherto Remained Concealed'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 1928).}}

''The Heavenly Doctrine'' also teaches that the Last Judgement was followed by the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus Christ]], which occurred not by Christ in person but by a revelation from him through the inner, spiritual sense of the Word&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/tcrtc.html |title = Swedenborg, E.

In another of his theological works, Swedenborg wrote that eating meat, regarded in itself, "is something profane" and was not practiced in the early days of the human race. However, he said, it now is a matter of conscience, and no one is condemned for doing it.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ac&amp;section=1002 ''Arcana Coelestia'' #1002, 1003] (Swedenborg Foundation, 1956)&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the early-days ideal appears to have given rise to the idea that Swedenborg was a [[vegetarian]]. That conclusion may have been reinforced by the fact that a number of Swedenborg's early followers were part of the vegetarian movement that arose in Britain in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ivu.org/history/thesis/bible-christian.html|title=The vegetarian movement in England, 1847–1981: A study in the structure of its ideology |last=Twigg |first=Julia |publisher=University of London |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the only reports on Swedenborg himself are contradictory. His landlord in London, Shearsmith, said he ate no meat, but his maid, who served Swedenborg, said that he ate eels and [[pigeon pie]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt, C. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epictc.htm ''The Swedenborg Epic: The life and works of Emanuel Swedenborg''] Bookman Associates, 1952, p. 476, # 642).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Earths in the Universe'', it is stated that he conversed with spirits from [[Jupiter]], [[Mars]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Saturn]], [[Venus]] and the [[Moon]] as well as spirits from planets beyond the [[solar system]].&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E.[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/EU.html ''The Earths in Our Solar System Which are called Planets and the Earths in the Starry Heaven, and Their Inhabitants; Also the Spirits and Angels There From Things Heard and Seen''] 1758. Also Rotch Edition. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1907, in ''The Divine Revelation of the New Jerusalem'' (2012), n. 9-178.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 'encounters', he concluded that the planets of our solar system are inhabited and that such an enormous undertaking as the universe could not have been created for just one race on a planet or one 'Heaven' derived from its properties per planet. Many Heavenly societies were also needed to increase the perfection of the angelic Heavens and Heaven to fill in deficiencies and gaps in other societies. He argued: "What would this be to God, Who is infinite, and to whom a thousand or tens of thousands of planets, and all of them full of inhabitants, would be scarcely anything!"&lt;ref&gt;''Arcana Coelestia'' #6698&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg and the question of life on other planets has been extensively reviewed elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Simons K. [http://swedenborgproject.org/2007/09/08/the-life-on-other-planets-question/ The Life on Other Planets Question] The Swedenborg Project 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg published his work in London or the Netherlands because of their freedom of the press.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 477–478.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trobridge, G. ''Swedenborg, Life and Teaching'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 1976, p. 272).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Swedenborg's grave.jpg|right|thumb|Swedenborg's crypt in [[Uppsala Cathedral]].]]
In July 1770, at the age of 82, he traveled to [[Amsterdam]] to complete the publication of his last work. The book, ''Vera Christiana Religio'' (''The True Christian Religion''), was published there in 1771 and was one of the most appreciated of his works. Designed to explain his teachings to [[Lutherans]], it is the most concrete of his works.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In the summer of 1771, he traveled to London. Shortly before [[Christmas]], he suffered a stroke and was partially paralyzed and confined to bed. His health improved somewhat, but he died in 1772. There are several accounts of his last months, made by those with whom he stayed and by Arvid Ferelius, a pastor of the Swedish Church in London, who visited him several times.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 471–476. Accounts of Swedenborg's last days were collected and published in Tafel II:1, pp. 577 ff, 556 ff, 560 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that Swedenborg wrote a letter to [[John Wesley]], the founder of [[Methodism]], in February. Swedenborg said that he had been told in the world of spirits that Wesley wanted to speak with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5plNwQ4xyfwC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=john+wesley+swedenborg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tv48ELMH0Y&amp;sig=xsFqXKc2uEibBH5YjydRkhEJmvM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=K0OgTbjLM5TUgQfBsd3lBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20wesley%20swedenborg&amp;f=false |title = Documents concerning the life and character of Emanuel Swedenborg – Johann Friedrich Immanuel Tafel – Google Books |publisher = Books.google.com |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wesley, startled since he had not told anyone of his interest in Swedenborg, replied that he was going on a journey for six months and would contact Swedenborg on his return. Swedenborg replied that that would be too late since Swedenborg would be going to the spiritual world for the last time on March 29.&lt;ref&gt;''Epic'', pp. 430ff.&lt;/ref&gt; (Wesley later read and commented extensively on Swedenborg's work.)&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. ''True Christianity, Containing a Comprehensive Theology of the New Church That Was Predicted by the Lord in Daniel 7:13–14 and Revelation 21:1, 2'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 2006, Translator's Preface, Vol. 2, p. 36 ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg's landlord's servant girl, Elizabeth Reynolds, also said that Swedenborg had predicted the date and that he was as happy about it as if he was "going on holiday or to some merrymaking":&lt;ref&gt;''Epic'', p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|In Swedenborg's final hours, his friend, Pastor Ferelius, told him some people thought he had written his theology just to make a name for himself and asked Swedenborg if he would like to recant.  Raising himself up on his bed, his hand on his heart, Swedenborg earnestly replied,

"As truly as you see me before your eyes, so true is everything that I have written; and I could have said more had it been permitted. When you enter eternity you will see everything, and then you and I shall have much to talk about".&lt;ref name="Epic 433"&gt;''Epic'', p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;

He then died, in the afternoon, on the date he had predicted, March 29.&lt;ref name="Epic 433"/&gt; |}}
[[File:Swedenborg House London.jpg|thumb|Swedenborg House, London]]

He was buried in the [[Nordic churches in London#Swedish Church|Swedish Church]] in Princes Square in [[Shadwell]], London. On the 140th anniversary of his death, in 1912/1913, his remains were transferred to [[Uppsala Cathedral]] in Sweden, where they now rest close to the grave of the [[botanist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]]. In 1917, the [[Swedish Church]] in Shadwell was demolished, and the Swedish community that had grown around the parish moved to [[Marylebone]]. In 1938, Princes Square was redeveloped, and in his honour the local road was renamed Swedenborg Gardens. In 1997, a garden, play area and memorial, near the road, were created in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ukstreetmap.info/map-london-swedenborg-gardens-street.html |title = Street map Swedenborg Gardens, map London with Swedenborg Gardens |publisher=Ukstreetmap.info |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ewan-M Ewan Munro+ Add Contact |url = https://www.flickr.com/photos/55935853@N00/3111893982/ |title = Swedenborg Gardens, London Borough of Tower Hamlets, E1 - Flickr – Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eastlondonhistory.com/2011/06/16/history-of-swedenborg-gardens/|title=History of Swedenborg Gardens - eastlondonhistory.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Veracity ==
Swedenborg's transition from scientist to revelator or mystic has fascinated many people ever since it had occurred.

Swedenborg has had a variety of both supporting and critical biographers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/es.html "Who Was Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772)?"] An article including a list of biographies about Swedenborg, with a brief analysis of each biographer's point of view. Accessed June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some propose that he did not have a revelation at all but developed his theological ideas from sources that ranged from his father to earlier figures in the history of thought, notably [[Plotinus]]. That position was first and most notably taken by the Swedish writer Martin Lamm, who wrote a biography of Swedenborg in 1915 that is still in print.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The citation "Bergquist (1999)", which is used here repeatedly, appears to contain mislabelled quotes. See the "Talk" section of this page, under the heading "Bergquist footnote problem".}} [[Olof Lagercrantz]], the Swedish critic and publicist, had a similar point of view, calling Swedenborg's theological writing "a poem about a foreign country with peculiar laws and customs".&lt;ref&gt;''en dikt om ett främmande land med sällsamma lagar och seder''. Largercrantz (1996), backpage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg's approach to demonstrating the veracity of his theological teachings was to find and use voluminous quotations from the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]] to demonstrate agreement between the Bible and his theological teachings. His demonstration of the agreement is found throughout his theological writings since he rejected blind faith and declared true faith to be an internal acknowledgement of the truth.

The vast and consistent use of Biblical confirmations in Swedenborg's theological writings led a Swedish Royal Council in 1771 to examine the heresy charges of 1770 against two Swedish supporters of his theological writings: "there is much that is true and useful in Swedenborg's writings".&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt (1952), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor Hugo]], in Chapter 14 of ''[[Les misérables]]'', felt that Swedenborg had "lapsed into madness".

==Scientific beliefs==
Swedenborg proposed many scientific ideas during his lifetime. In his youth, he wanted to present a new idea every day, as he wrote to his brother-in-law [[Erik Benzelius the Younger|Erik Benzelius]] in 1718. Around 1730, he had changed his mind, and instead believed that higher knowledge is not something that can be acquired, but that it is based on intuition. After 1745, he instead considered himself receiving scientific knowledge in a spontaneous manner from angels.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 364–365.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1745, when he considered himself to have entered a spiritual state, he tended to phrase his "experiences" in [[empirical]] terms, to report accurately things he had experienced on his spiritual journeys.

One of his ideas that is considered most crucial for the understanding of his theology is his notion of [[correspondence (theology)|correspondences]]. But, in fact, he first presented the theory of correspondences only in 1744, in the first volume of ''Regnum Animale'' dealing with the human soul.&lt;ref name="Delblanc" /&gt;

The basis of the correspondence theory is that there is a relationship among the natural ("physical"), the spiritual, and the divine worlds. The foundations of this theory can be traced to [[Neoplatonism]] and the philosopher [[Plotinus]] in particular. With the aid of this scenario, Swedenborg now interpreted the Bible in a different light, claiming that even the most apparently trivial sentences could hold a profound spiritual meaning.&lt;ref name=Korr&gt;Lamm (1987 [1915]), dedicates a chapter to the correspondence theories, pp. 85–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg argued that it is the presence of that spiritual sense which makes the Word divine.&lt;ref&gt;(Swedenborg E, ''The True Christian Religion Containing the Universal Theology of the New Church.'' Swedenborg Foundation 1946, # 200)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prophetic accounts==
Four incidents of purported psychic ability of Swedenborg exist in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several versions of each story.

=== Fire anecdotes ===
On Thursday, 19 July 1759 a great and well-documented fire broke out in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.{{efn|The accounts are fully described in Bergquist, pp. 312–313 and in Chapter 31 of ''The Swedenborg Epic''. The primary source for these accounts is a letter from [[Immanuel Kant]] in 1768 and the Swedenborg collection by Tafel (see [[#Further reading|Further reading]]).}}&lt;ref name="brandhistoriska.org"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.brandhistoriska.org/olyckor_se.html |title = Årtal och händelser i Jönköping |publisher = Brandhistoriska.org |date = |accessdate = 2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staffan Högberg, ''Stockholms historia'' (Stockholm's history), part 1, p. 342; in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=D-IYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR18&amp;lpg=PR18&amp;dq=%22documents+concerning+swedenborg%22+tafel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qu-XD4a3Ry&amp;sig=57fzfakBqB4wjrNlLqYXAZYycjo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LLi-SfEuhtYwnN_Qqgg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result#PPR3,M1 For July 19 date see especially Documents 271–273 in ''Documents concerning the Life and Character of Emanuel Swedenborg Collected, Translated and Annotated by Tafel, RL.'' Volume II, Part 1. (Swedenborg Society, British and Foreign. 36 Bloomsbury Street, London, 1877)] Retrieved 15 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the high and increasing wind it spread very fast, consuming about 300 houses and making 2000 people homeless.&lt;ref name="brandhistoriska.org" /&gt;

When the fire broke out Swedenborg was at a dinner with friends in [[Gothenburg]], about 400&amp;nbsp;km from Stockholm.  He became agitated and told the party at six o'clock that there was a fire in Stockholm, that it had consumed his neighbor's home and was threatening his own. Two hours later, he exclaimed with relief that the fire had stopped three doors from his home. In the excitement following his report, word even reached the ears of the provincial governor, who summoned Swedenborg that same evening and asked for a detailed recounting.

At that time, it took two to three days for news from Stockholm to reach Gothenburg by courier, so that is the shortest duration in which the news of the fire could reach Gothenburg.  The first messenger from Stockholm with news of the fire was from the Board of Trade, who arrived Monday evening.  The second messenger was a royal courier, who arrived on Tuesday.  Both of these reports confirmed every statement to the precise hour that Swedenborg first expressed the information.  The accounts are fully described in Bergquist, pp.&amp;nbsp;312–313 and in Chapter 31 of ''The Swedenborg Epic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic31.htm |title = The Swedenborg Epic: Chapter 31 |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date = |accessdate = 2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As noted above,  primary source for these accounts is a letter from [[Immanuel Kant]] in 1768 and the Swedenborg collection by Tafel (''Documents'' #271–273)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Swedenborg's biographer Lars Bergquist, however, this event took place on Sunday, July 29 – 10 days after the fire.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Bergquist: Swedenborgs Hemlighet, Stockholm 1999. {{ISBN|91-27-06981-8}}. (In Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

(Bergquist states, but does not document, that Swedenborg confirmed his vision of the fire incident to his good  friend, Consul Christopher Springer, "one of the pillars of the church, ... "a man of enviable reputation for virtue and intelligence",&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt S. [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic35.html ''The Swedenborg Epic,'' Chapter 35] Bookman 1952&lt;/ref&gt; "and that Swedenborg's innkeeper, Erik Bergström, heard Swedenborg affirming the story.&lt;ref&gt;Berguist, L. ''Swedenborg's Secret'' Swedenborg Foundation, 2005, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;)

It seems unlikely that the many witnesses to Swedenborg's distress during the fire, and his immediate report of it to the provincial governor,&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist, L, ''Swedenborg's Secret'' (London, The Swedenborg Society, 2005, p. 270).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; would have left room for doubt in the public eye of Swedenborg's report.  If Swedenborg had only received news of the fire by the normal methods there would have been no issue of psychic perception recorded for history.  Instead, "when the news of Swedenborg's extraordinary vision of the fire reached the capital, public curiosity about him was very much aroused."&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt, Chapter 35&lt;/ref&gt;

A second fire anecdote, similar to the first one, but less cited, is the incident of the mill owner Bolander.  Swedenborg warned him, again abruptly, of an incipient fire in one of his mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic38.htm |title=The Swedenborg Epic: Chapter 38 |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queen of Sweden===
The third event was in 1758 when Swedenborg visited Queen [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia|Louisa Ulrika]] of Sweden, who asked him to tell her something about her deceased brother [[Prince Augustus William of Prussia]]. The next day, Swedenborg whispered something in her ear that turned the Queen pale and she explained that this was something only she and her brother could know about.&lt;ref&gt;''Swedenborg Epic'' pp. 278ff.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|According to Bergquist (1999), pp. 314–315, There are several different accounts of the events which makes it difficult to conclude the exact details of the event. Carl Robsahm (see [[#Sources|reference]]) reports the story in this way.}}

=== Lost document ===
The fourth incident involved a woman who had lost an important document, and came to Swedenborg asking if a recently deceased person could tell him where it was, which he (in some sources) was said to have done the following night.{{efn|According to Bergquist (1999), p. 316, there are some ten different reports of this event. There are two trustworthy descriptions, one by Robsahm (writing down Swedenborg's own description) and one by a priest who enquired of the woman in a letter fifteen years later.}}

Although not typically cited along with these three episodes, there was one further piece of evidence:  Swedenborg was noted by the seamen of the ships that he sailed between Stockholm and London to always have excellent sailing conditions.&lt;ref name="Sigstedt, p. 329"&gt;Sigstedt, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;  When asked about this by a friend, Swedenborg played down the matter, saying he was surprised by this experience himself and that he was certainly not able to do miracles.&lt;ref name="Sigstedt, p. 329" /&gt;

== Kant's view ==

In 1763, [[Immanuel Kant]], then at the beginning of his career, was impressed by these accounts and made inquiries to find out if they were true.  He also ordered all eight volumes of the expensive ''Arcana Cœlestia'' (''Heavenly Arcana'' or ''Heavenly Mysteries''). One Charlotte von Knobloch wrote Kant asking his opinion of Swedenborg's psychic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Benz, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This letter is further discussed in Laywine, A., "Kant's Early Metaphysics". ''North American Kant Society Studies in Philosophy'', volume 3 (Atascadero, California: Ridgeview Publishing Company, 1993), pp. 72–74.}}  Kant wrote a very affirmative reply, referring to Swedenborg's "miraculous" gift, and characterizing him as "reasonable, agreeable, remarkable and sincere" and "a scholar," in one of his letters to [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]],&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; and expressing regret that he (Kant) had never met Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 202, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benz 2001, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph Green (merchant)|Joseph Green]], his English friend, who investigated the matter for Kant, including by visiting Swedenborg's home, found Swedenborg to be a "sensible, pleasant and openhearted" man and here again, a scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, three years later, in 1766, Kant wrote and published anonymously a small book entitled ''Träume eines Geistersehers'' (''Dreams of a Spirit-Seer'')&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, G., Magee, G. E. (Swedenborg Foundation 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; that was a scathing critique of Swedenborg and his writings. He termed Swedenborg a "spook hunter"&lt;ref&gt;Benz 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; "without official office or occupation."&lt;ref&gt;Benz, E., Heron, A. (Translator) ''Spiritual Vision and Revelation'', Chapter VI. ''The Mystery of a Date&amp;nbsp;– Fresh light on Kant's Criticism of Swedenborg'', p. 13, reprinted in ''The New Philosophy'' 2001 104:7,&lt;/ref&gt; As rationale for his critique, Kant said he wanted to stop "ceaseless questioning".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; and inquiries about ''Dreams'' from "inquisitive" persons, both known and unknown",&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, G. Did Kant dissemble his interest in Swedenborg? "The New Philosophy" 1999, 102: 531&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's friend [[Moses Mendelssohn]] thought there was a "joking pensiveness" in ''Dreams'' that sometimes left the reader in doubt as to whether ''Dreams'' was meant to make "metaphysics laughable or spirit-seeking credible".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his letters to Mendelssohn, Kant refers to ''Dreams'' less-than-enthusiastically as a "desultory little essay".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant never closed off the possibility of [[mysticism]] or spirits in ''Dreams of a Spirit-Seer'' and the exact relationship of his thought to Swedenborg's remains unclear, according to contemporary scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 185-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
{{Lutheranism}}
Swedenborg claimed in ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' that the teachings of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ were revealed to him.&lt;ref&gt;''Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture''#4, ''True Christian Religion'' # 859, 750, 779&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg considered his [[theology]] a revelation of the true Christian religion that had become obfuscated through centuries of theology. However, he did not refer to his writings as theology since he considered it based on actual experiences, unlike theology,&lt;ref name="Delblanc" /&gt; except in the title of his last work. Neither did he wish to compare it to [[philosophy]], a discipline he discarded in 1748 because, he claimed, it ''"darkens the mind, blinds us, and wholly rejects the faith"''.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Bergquist (1999), p. 178, based on Swedenborg's ''Spiritual Experiences'' (1748), §767 (However, ''Spiritual Experiences'' is not among the works Swedenborg published himself, and thus may not be authoritative revelation. See [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/books.html "Which of Swedenborg's books are Divine revelation?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation of Swedenborg's theology was laid down in ''[[Arcana Cœlestia]]'' (''Heavenly Mysteries''), published in eight Latin volumes from 1749 to 1756. In a significant portion of that work, he interprets the Biblical passages of Genesis and Exodus. He reviews what he says is the inner spiritual sense of these two works of the Word of God. (He later made a similar review of the inner sense of the book of Revelation in ''Apocalypse Revealed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/AR.html |title=The Apocalypse Revealed Wherein are Disclosed the Arcana Foretold Which Have Hitherto Remained Concealed |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Most of all, he was convinced that the Bible describes a human's transformation from a materialistic to a spiritual being, which he calls rebirth or regeneration. He begins this work by outlining how the [[creation myth]] was not an account of the creation of Earth, but an account of man's rebirth or regeneration in six steps represented by the six days of creation. Everything related to mankind in the Bible could also be related to [[Jesus Christ]], and how Christ freed himself from materialistic boundaries through the glorification of his human presence by making it Divine. Swedenborg examines this idea in his exposition of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 286–309.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage ===
One often discussed aspect of Swedenborg's writing is his ideas on marriage. Swedenborg himself remained a bachelor all his life, but that did not hinder him from writing voluminously on the subject. His work on ''Marriage Love'' (''Conjugial Love''{{efn|"[[wiktionary:conjugial|conjugial]]" should not be confused with "[[wiktionary:conjugal|conjugal]]", the general term for marriage.}} in older translations) (1768) was dedicated to this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=1 |title = ML 1 – Small Canon Search – Reading – The Word of God, The Whole Word of God, and Nothing But the Word of God – Searching the Second Advent Christian Bible – The Second Advent Christian Canon of Scripture |publisher = Small Canon Search |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central question with regard to marriage is whether it stops at death or continues into heaven. The question arises due to a statement of Jesus' that there is no marriage in heaven (Luke 20:27–38, Matthew 22:23–32, and Mark 12:18–27). Swedenborg wrote ''The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage In Heaven'' as a detailed analysis of what he meant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.swedenborgproject.org/2011/08/22/the-lord-god-jesus-christ-on-marriage-in-heaven// |title = The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage In Heaven |publisher = The Swedenborg Project |date = |accessdate = 2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of the relationship between husband and wife resumes in the spiritual world in whatever state it was at their death in this world. Thus, a couple in true marriage love remain together in that state in [[heaven]] into eternity. A couple lacking in that love by one or both partners, however, will separate after death and each will be given a compatible new partner if they wish. A partner is also given to a person who loved the ideal of marriage but never found a true partner in this world. The exception in both cases is a person who hates chaste marriage and thus cannot receive such a partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=46 |title=Marriage Love 46–50) |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg saw creation as a series of pairings, descending from the Divine love and wisdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=dlw&amp;section=52 |title =Marriage Love #52 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; that define [[God]] and are the basis of [[:wikt:creation|creation]]. This duality can be seen in the pairing of good and truth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=84 |title=Marriage Love #84 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; charity and faith,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=fa&amp;section=1 |title=Marriage Love #1 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; God and the church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=117 |title = Marriage Love #117 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=83 |title=Marriage Love #83 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, the goal for these pairs is to achieve [[wiktionary:conjunction|conjunction]] between the two component parts. In the case of marriage, the object is to bring about the joining together of the two partners at the spiritual and physical levels, and the happiness that comes as a consequence.

===Trinity===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}
Swedenborg rejected the common explanation of the [[Trinity]] as a Trinity of Persons, which he said was not taught in the [[early Christian]] church. There was, for instance, no mention in the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostolic]] writings of any "Son from eternity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=tcr&amp;section=175 |title=TCR 175 – Small Canon Search – Reading – The Word of God, The Whole Word of God, and Nothing But the Word of God – Searching the Second Advent Christian Bible – The Second Advent Christian Canon of Scripture |publisher=Small Canon Search |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he explained in his theological writings how the Divine Trinity exists in One Person, in One God, the Lord [[Jesus Christ]], which he said is taught in Colossians 2:9. According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', Jesus, the  [[Son of God]], came into the world due to the spread of evil here.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/tcrtc.html ''The True Christian Religion'', particularly sections 163–184 ] (New York: Swedenborg Foundation, 1951).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/DL.html ''The Doctrine of the Lord'']  (New York: Swedenborg Foundation, 1946)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/AC.htm ''The Arcana Coelestia''] (New York: Swedenborg Foundation, various dates)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/njhd.html ''The New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine,'' particularly sections 280–310] New York: Swedenborg Foundation, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg spoke in virtually all his works against what he regarded as the incomprehensible Trinity of Persons concept. He said that people of other religions opposed Christianity because of its doctrine of a Trinity of Persons. He considered the separation of the Trinity into three separate Persons to have originated with the [[First Council of Nicaea]] and the [[Athanasian]] Creed. According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' the Athanasian Creed is true, however, if the Trinity is understood to mean a Trinity in one person and that person being the Lord God Jesus Christ.

===''Sola Fide'' (Faith Alone)===
''The Heavenly Doctrine'' rejects the concept of salvation through [[faith alone|faith-alone]] (''sola-fide'' in Latin), since he considered both [[faith]] and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] necessary for [[salvation]], not one without the other, whereas the Reformers taught that faith-alone procured justification, although it must be a faith which resulted in obedience. The purpose of faith, according to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', is to lead a person to a life according to the truths of faith, which is charity, as is taught in 1 Corinthians 13:13 and James 2:20.

In other words, Swedenborg spoke sharply against the faith-alone doctrine of Luther and others.  He held that justification before God was not based solely upon some imputed righteousness before God, and was not achievable merely by a gift of God's grace (''sola gratia''), granted without any basis in a person's actual behavior in life.  ''Sola-fide'' was a doctrine averred by Martin Luther, John Calvin, Ulrich Zwingli and others during the Protestant Reformation, and was a core belief especially in the theology of the Lutheran reformers [[Martin Luther]] and [[Philip Melanchthon]].

Although the ''sola-fide'' doctrine of the Reformers also emphasized that saving faith was one that effected works&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peacebyjesus.witnesstoday.org/Reformation_faith_works.html |title=Reformation Faith + Works |publisher=Peacebyjesus.witnesstoday.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (by faith-alone, but not by a faith which is alone), Swedenborg protested against faith-alone being the instrument of justification, and held that salvation is only possible through the conjunction of faith and charity in a person, and that the purpose of faith is to lead a person to live according to the truths of faith, which is [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]. He further states that faith and charity must be exercised by doing good out of willing good whenever possible, which are good works or good uses or the conjunction perishes. In one section he wrote:

{{quotation|It is very evident from their [[Epistles]] that it never entered the mind of any of the [[apostles]] that the church of this day would separate faith from charity by teaching that [[Sola fide|faith-alone]] justifies and saves apart from the works of the law, and that charity therefore cannot be conjoined with faith, since faith is from God, and charity, so far as it is expressed in works, is from man. But this separation and division were introduced into the Christian church when it divided God into three persons, and ascribed to each equal Divinity.|True Christian Religion, section 355&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblemeanings.info/books/tcr/sect-336ff.html#TCR355 |title=True Christian Religion, sections 336 ff |publisher=Biblemeanings.info |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Later history ==
Swedenborg made no attempt to found a church.&lt;ref&gt;Block, M.B [https://archive.org/details/newchurchinthene028276mbp ''The New Church in the New World.

E. ''A Religious History of the American People'' (Yale 1972, p. 483).&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of important cultural figures, both writers and artists, were influenced by Swedenborg's writings, including [[Robert Frost]],&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Jeffrey, ''Robert Frost: A Biography'', Houghton Mifflin, 1996, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Johnny Appleseed]], [[William Blake]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Daniel Burnham]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.classic-literature.co.uk/scottish-authors/arthur-conan-doyle/the-history-of-spiritualism-vol-i/ebook-page-02.asp |title = Arthur Conan Doyle – The History of Spiritualism Vol I Page 02 |publisher=Classic-literature.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

T. Suzuki]], and [[W. B. Yeats]]. His philosophy had a great impact on the Duke of [[Södermanland]], later King [[Carl XIII]], who as the [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of Swedish [[Freemasonry]] (''Svenska Frimurare Orden'') built its unique system of degrees and wrote its rituals. In contrast, one of the most prominent Swedish authors of Swedenborg's day, [[Johan Henric Kellgren]], called Swedenborg "nothing but a fool".{{efn|[[Johan Henrik Kellgren]] published an often quoted satirical poem entitled ''Man äger ej snille för det man är galen'' ("''You Own Not Genius For That You are Mad''") in 1787. See Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc &amp; Lönnroth (1999). (''[[wikisource:sv:Man äger ej snille för det man är galen|Link to the full poem, in Swedish]]'')}} A [[heresy]] trial was initiated in Sweden in 1768 against Swedenborg writings and two men who promoted them.{{efn|The trial in 1768 was against Gabrial Beyer and Johan Rosén and was essentially concerned whether Swedenborg's theological writings were consistent with Christian doctrine. A royal ordinance in 1770 declared that writings were "clearly mistaken" and should not be taught. Swedenborg then begged the King for grace and protection in a letter from Amsterdam. A new investigation against Swedenborg stalled and was eventually dropped in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 453–463.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the two and a half centuries since Swedenborg's death, various [[The New Church (Swedenborgian)|interpretations]] of his theology have been made, and he has also been scrutinized in biographies and psychological studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/es.html |title = Who was Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772)? |publisher = Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date = 2006-11-19 |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|See "[[#Sources|Sources]]" and "[[#Further reading|Further reading]]" sections, below.}} Swedenborg, with his claimed new [[Dispensation (period)|dispensation]], has been considered by some to suffer from [[mental illness]].{{efn|[[Johan Henrik Kellgren]] published an often quoted satirical poem entitled ''Man äger ej snille för det man är galen'' (''You Own Not Genius For That You are Mad'') in 1787.

He mentions an earlier biography by the Swedish physician Emil Kleen who concluded that Swedenborg was blatantly mad, suffering "[[paranoia]] and [[hallucinations]]. A similar conclusion was proposed more recently by [[psychiatrist]] John Johnson in "Henry Maudsley on Swedenborg's messianic psychosis", ''British Journal of Psychiatry'' 165:690–691 (1994), who wrote that Swedenborg suffered hallucinations of "acute [[schizophrenia]] or epileptic [[psychosis]]". Another contemporary critique, Foote-Smith E, Smith TJ. Emanuel Swedenborg. ''Epilepsia'' 1996 Feb; 37(2):211-8, proposed that Swedenborg suffered from [[Temporal Lobe Epilepsy]].

While the insanity explanation was not uncommon during Swedenborg's own time, it is mitigated by his activity in the Swedish [[Riddarhuset]] (The House of the Nobility), the [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]] (the Swedish parliament), and the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. Additionally, the system of thought in his theological writings is considered by some to be remarkably coherent.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, he was characterized by his contemporaries as a "kind and warm-hearted man", "amiable in his meeting with the public", speaking "easily and naturally of his spiritual experiences",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic37.htm |title = The Swedenborg Epic: Chapter 37 |publisher = Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trobridge, G.''Swedenborg, Life and Teaching'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 1976, p. 202.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://archive.org/details/emanuelswedenbor00trobuoft |title = Emanuel Swedenborg : his life, teachings and influence : Trobridge, George, 1851–1909 : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher = Archive.org |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; with pleasant and interesting conversation...

(Swedenborg Foundation, 2002, pp. 226, 227.)&lt;/ref&gt; Of note here is Swedenborg's statement that he was commanded by the Lord to publish his writings and "Do not believe that without this express command I would have thought of publishing things which I knew in advance would make me look ridiculous and many people would think lies..."&lt;ref&gt;Block, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

White worked for the Swedenborg Society in London and wrote an affirmative biography of Swedenborg.  However, he was fired for publishing spiritist books and selling them at the Society's store, as well as otherwise interfering with the Society's function. White's response was the 1867 biography, in which he, in Tafel's words, "turn[ed] a complete somersault in his convictions," and wrote a highly derogatory biography of Swedenborg and his teachings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1958">'''Georges Cipriani''' (born 12 April 1950) is a former militant of the group [[Action directe (armed group)|Action directe]].

==Early Life, Work and Involvement with AD==

He was born in [[Tunis]] to a working-class family, and later immigrated to France. In the late 1960s, he worked as a milling machine operator in the machine tool workshop of the [[Renault]]-[[Boulogne-Billancourt|Billancourt]] factory. He was a member of the factory committee at the time of the assassination of [[Gauche prolétarienne]] militant [[Murder of Pierre Overney|Pierre Overney]] on 25 February 1972. For the next 10 years he lived in [[Germany]], returning to France in the early 1980s and becoming a member of [[Action directe (armed group)|Action directe]].

==Arrest and Imprisonment==

Arrested with his accomplices [[Jean-Marc Rouillan]], [[Joëlle Aubron]] and [[Nathalie Ménigon]] on 21 February 1987 on a farm in [[Vitry-aux-Loges]] ([[Loiret]]), Cipriani was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the assassinations of Engineer General [[René Audran]] and [[Georges Besse]].

After several years of solitary confinement and partial confinement, Georges Cipriani was committed to the psychiatric hospital of [[Villejuif]] during the summer of 1993.

His request for the status of semi-liberty, which would enable him to leave prison for extended periods, was denied on 20 August 2009, before being approved on 14 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2010/04/01/action-directe-un-regime-de-semi-liberte-accorde-a-georges-cipriani_1327664_3224.html Action directe : un régime de semi-liberté accordé à Georges Cipriani], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 1er avril 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gianna Jessen''' (born April 6, 1977) is an American [[pro-life]] and [[disability rights]] activist. She is a survivor of a failed [[saline abortion]] attempt.&lt;ref name=T05 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT91 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC05 /&gt;

==Early life==
Jessen was born April 6, 1977 in [[Los Angeles, California]]. Her medical records indicate that she was born in the 30th week of pregnancy to a 17-year-old girl during a failed saline abortion. Jessen's death certificate is signed by the doctor who was performing the [[abortion]].&lt;ref name=T05 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC05 /&gt;

Jessen weighed {{convert|2.5|lbs|kg}} at birth, and, because of the abortion attempt, she was born with [[cerebral palsy]], a motor condition that affects various areas of body movement. She describes it as a "tremendous gift".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/09/27/the-only-reason-i-am-alive-is-the-fact-that-the-abortionist-had-not-yet-arrived-at-work/&lt;/ref&gt; Jessen spent three months in the hospital before being placed in [[foster care]].  She was [[adopted]] at the age of four.&lt;ref name=T05 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jessen Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giannajessen.com/main/featured/bioprint.pdf|title=Gianna Jessen Biography|format=PDF|accessdate=2012-05-07|work=giannajessen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1990s===
Jessen's career as an activist began in 1991, when she was 14, after her adoptive mother, Dianna DePaul, told Jessen she was born to a 17-year-old girl, during a failed abortion attempt. Jessen has since campaigned against abortion, saying "It's more comfortable for people to think of abortion as a political decision, or a right. But I am not a right. I am a human being". Jessen said she's forgiven her birth mother, but is not interested in a relationship with her, citing a strong relationship with her adoptive mother. Jessen has also campaigned against exceptions to [[late-term abortion]] laws, on the grounds of fetal disability, citing her own [[disability]].&lt;ref name=T05&gt;{{cite news

In 1995, four years after Jessen was placed in the national spotlight, author Jessica Shaver published a biography on Jessen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In December 2005 Jessen travelled to [[London]] to support a campaign to reduce the number of abortions under the [[Abortion Act 1967|UK Abortion Act]] and to speak at a parliamentary meeting at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref name=BBC05 /&gt; Both the [[Rowan Williams|Archbishop of Canterbury]] and the [[Cormac Murphy-O'Connor|Archbishop of Westminster]] indicated that they hoped her story would encourage Parliament to look again at abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Grace Griffith''' is a [[folk music|folk]] and [[celtic music|celtic]] [[singing|singer]] based in [[Washington, DC]]. She has been honored with multiple [[Washington Area Music Awards|Wammie awards]] by the [[Washington Area Music Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wamadc.com/wama/wammies/WAMI-abc-e-g.htm Wammie Winners]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, she was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/04/AR2006030401316_pf.html Grace Griffith, in Fine Voice and Spirit as Disease Takes Its Toll Richard Harrington, Washington Post, March 5, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Grace Griffith was raised in a family of ten children on a small farm in [[Southern Maryland]]. At a young age she began singing and accompanying herself on guitar playing in small coffeehouse stages, mentored by her sister Maura. Grace’s parents encouraged her to follow a practical career. Putting her musical hobby to one side she graduated from the [[University of Maryland]] in 1978 with a degree in physical therapy and embarked on a career as a physical therapist. Several years after her college studies she was invited to sing for a local Irish band in Washington DC called “The Hags” and toured the college circuit for two years. Her successor in that band was to become the famed singer-songwriter [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]].
In 1987 Griffith formed a duo called “Hazlewood” with songwriter Susan Graham White. They produced some independent releases and ultimately appeared at the 1991 [[Philadelphia Folk Festival]].&lt;ref name="Official Bio"&gt;[http://www.seamaid.org/grace/bio.html Grace Griffith official site bio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316034154/http://www.seamaid.org/grace/bio.html |date=2008-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to her celtic roots Grace formed an East Coast Celtic group called Connemara which she formed with fiddler/arranger Cathy Palmer along with harpist Tracie Brown. They were also joined on the albums by guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Zan McLeod. They released 2 albums, firstly Beyond Horizon in 1993 and Siren Song in 1995. 
Other musicians to participate on the projects were harpists Sue Richards, Julia Lane, Carol Thompson and Mary Fitzgerald along with box player Billy McComiskey and Jody Marshall on hammered dulcimer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/grace-griffith-p169695/biography Allmusic Guide biography]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1993 as a solo artist Griffith released her debut album ''Every Hue and Shade'' which came out on her own independent label.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/every-hue-and-shade-r229466 Allmusic Guide review]&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Blix Street Records]] based in California were looking for an artist to succeed Ireland's [[Mary Black]] as their main project in the U.S., they signed Griffith on a long term recording contract. They revamped her album ''Every Hue and Shade'' which became her label debut called Grace. In 1996 Blix Street also licensed the two Connemara recordings for distribution.&lt;ref name="Official Bio"/&gt;
Grace completed 2 further albums with ''Minstrel Song'', released in 2000, and followed by ''Sands of Time'' in 2003. Her album [[My Life (Grace Griffith album)|My Life]] in 2006 drew critical acclaim extending beyond her home base of Washington D.C.

Griffith has been called a singer's singer. One of her keen fans of her singing was the late [[Eva Cassidy]]. When Griffith came to know Eva's work, she encouraged Blix Street to sign her as well, which they did just after the release of her album Grace.&lt;ref name="Official Bio"/&gt;
Eva Cassidy was first and foremost a music lover sitting in the front row watching her musical heroes perform in Washington. She was also an avid fan of Grace Griffith who spotted Eva’s face at several of her concerts during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Griffith got to hear about Cassidy’s talents and in 1996 made a drive to Potomac to see the then mystery girl at a small club in Alexandria, VA. By this time the Washington Area Association had awarded Grace more than a dozen “Wammies” including “Best Female Vocalist” and “Best Album”. In September 1996 hearing of Eva Cassidy’s illness she went to visit her. Grace made a telephone call to Bill Straw the President of Blix Street Records explaining the situation and two days later Grace sent a tape of Eva’s [[Live at Blues Alley|Live At Blues Alley]] album to him. On that tape was a recording of "Fields of Gold"; the song became Cassidy’s big hit in what has become a phenomenal posthumous career. "All the colors of the rainbow, all life's palette of beauty and sadness and sweet passion and eternity &amp;mdash; it was all there in that voice that came from that heart and those hands" said Griffith in interview when talking about Eva.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evacassidy.org/eva/graceandeva.htmGrace Griffith interview in January, 2003 with songwriter Steven Digman] the article appeared in the Pickett News in Hagerstown, Maryland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the memorial service for Eva at [[Greenbelt Park]], Griffith performed a haunting Celtic-tinged version of "Golden Thread".

During the next seven years the Eva Cassidy story unfolded whilst Grace Griffith continued to toil in relative obscurity. In one of life’s ironies in 1998 Griffith was diagnosed with the degenerative neurological condition [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name=linernotes&gt;{{cite book|title=Sands Of Time: Liner Notes, June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It affected her life profoundly but although her voice was affected she could still sing but she had to give up playing whistle, guitar, and dulcimer and relied on musical friends to support her.&lt;ref name="Official Bio"/&gt;
At the World Parkinson’s Congress in February 2006 she performed ''If I Can’t Dance'' from her album My Life dedicating it to other fellow Parkinson's Disease sufferers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=My Life: Liner Notes, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Grace underwent pioneering surgery at [[Johns Hopkins University Hospital]] for the implantation of electrodes for [[Deep Brain Stimulation]]. She benefited from the then experimental procedure and has since become an effective speaker and educator on Parkinson’s. Over a period of time as the batteries ran down, her voice diminished. In March 2010, her doctors, though unable to assure her of a positive result, changed and upgraded the batteries, and it proved successful. Griffith had more energy and more voice.
Grace Griffith sang at the opening of the second [[World Parkinson Congress]] (September 28-October 1, 2010) held in [[Glasgow, Scotland]]. Accompanied by Mark Cowan on guitar she performed a traditional tune “The Seasons” (Scots Pastoral song) along with “Sailing” which was a hit for [[Rod Stewart]]. Grace also spoke at a Music &amp; Parkinson’s Disease Workshop on the last day of the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldpdcongress.org/About/WPC2010_summary.cfm World Parkinson Congress 2010 summary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/parkinsonsuk/5035636015/ Flickr Photo]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 2010 Blix Street Records released the compilation album Sailing with the intentions that it would elevate this relatively unknown artist to her rightful place among her peers.&lt;ref&gt;[Blix Street Records Press Release September 15, 2010: retrieved from http://www.blixstreet.com/press_releases/sailing.html on 3 September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the week commencing September 3, 2011 Grace’s song ''My Life'' was added to the BBC Radio 2 B Playlist.&lt;ref&gt;[BBC Radio 2 Playlist: retrieved from http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/music-events/playlist/ on 3 September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==

===Grace===
Grace Griffith’s debut album with [[Blix Street Records]] released on August 6, 1996. It was a re-package of her 13 track independent record called Every Hue and Shade. On this 10 track recording it includes a take of the show tune “Summertime” from the George Gershwin opera [[Porgy and Bess]] and a cover of "Turning Away" written by Scottish singer-songwriter [[Dougie MacLean]] which appeared on his album Indigenous in 1999. It also contains a musical version of the [[W.B.Yeats]] poem "[[The Lake Isle of Innisfree]]"

===Minstrel Song===
On April 24, 2000 Griffith released this 10 track recording on the Blix Street Record label. It was produced by Grammy Award nominee Marcy Marxer. On this album which was a mixture of traditional and contemporary material Griffith interprets songs with arrangements ranging from sparse guitar and cello accompaniment to lush productions. She covers songs by [[Iris Dement]] ("My Life"), [[Jane Siberry]] ("Bound By The Beauty"), [[John Martyn]] ("May You Never") and [[Richard Farina]] ("Swallow Song").

===Sands Of Time===
Her third album with Blix Street Records Grace Griffith collaborates with former Eva Cassidy producer/band members, Chris Biondo and Lenny Williams along with Grace’s long-time friend producer/instrumentalist Marcy Marxer. It is essential a collection of ballads which includes a cover of  “Moment of Forever” written by Kris Kristofferson. The album was dedicated to Eva Cassidy.

===My Life===
On March 14, 2006 Griffith released [[My Life (Grace Griffith album)|My Life]] her fourth studio release for [[Blix Street Records]] and was again produced by Chris Biondo, [[Marcy Marxer]] and Lenny Williams. It consisted of twelve tracks which are all cover interpretations. The title track ''My Life'' was written by [[Iris Dement]] and appeared on her 1994 album My Life.

===Sailing===
On September 28, 2010 Blix Street Records released Sailing which is an 11 track compilation package. The opening track "[[Wondering Where the Lions Are]]” was written by [[Bruce Cockburn]] and first appeared in 1979. The tenth track “Sailing/Ships Are Sailing” is a combination of a cover of the 1975 number one hit ''Sailing'' for [[Rod Stewart]] and "[[Ships are Sailing]]" the popular traditional Irish Reel.

===Passing Through===
After battling Parkinson's disease for more than 15 years, Grace was determined to record one more album. On July 22, 2014 she did just that again with Blix Street. The tracks were mostly recorded a cappella, with generally sparse instruments added later. Grace's former Hazlewood partner, Susan Graham White, added her voice to Grace's new recording of Susan's "Brigid's Shield" and, for one more song, Hazlewood rides again! In addition to eight new recordings, the album includes 4 previously recorded but unreleased tracks that did not quite fit on their intended albums plus the bonus track, "Water Fire and Smoke."

'''Gray Cowan Boyce''' (19 February 1899 - 14 May 1981) was an American [[Medieval history|medieval historian]] and historical [[bibliographer]] whose masterwork was his five volume ''Literature of Medieval History, 1930–1975: A Supplement to Louis John Paetow's "A Guide to the Study of Medieval History"'' (1981).

==Early life==
Gray Cowan Boyce was born in San Francisco on 19 February 1899 and brought up in [[Alameda, California|Alameda]]. He received his advanced education at the [[University of California at Berkeley]], received a B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. in 1920, 1921, and 1925 respectively. He went on to further study at [[Harvard University]] (1922–23), the [[University of Grenoble]] (1925), and the [[University of Ghent]] (1925–26).&lt;ref name=northw&gt;[http://findingaids.library.northwestern.edu/catalog/print_version/inu-ead-nua-archon-658 Guide to the Gray Boyce (1899-1981) Papers.] Northwestern University Library Archival and Manuscript Collections. Retrieved 7 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1926, Boyce joined the faculty at [[Princeton University]]. He remained there until 1946, apart from three years in the [[United States Naval Reserve]] during the Second World War. In 1946 he joined [[Northwestern University]] where he remained until his retirement in 1967.&lt;ref name=northw/&gt;

Boyce's interests increasingly tended towards bibliography and scholarly standards. He was on the editorial board of ''[[The American Historical Review]]'' and one correspondent with that journal quoted approvingly a Boyce review elsewhere where Boyce had said of the reviewed work: "For 364 pages of text there are almost 200 pages of notes. In the opinion of the writer these notes contain material that is not only essential for such a work, but include matter which is frequently as informing and exciting as the narrative itself. A remarkably rich and well-ordered bibliography of forty pages and indexes ... complete the book."&lt;ref&gt;"Communications", ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 56, No. 4 (July 1951), pp. 1040-1042.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his retirement, Boyce moved back to Alameda where he lived with his sister Merle and was able to complete his masterwork, a five volume ''Literature of Medieval History, 1930–1975: A Supplement to Louis John Paetow's "A Guide to the Study of Medieval History"'' (1981). In later life he suffered from [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[glaucoma]].&lt;ref name=northw/&gt;

==Death==
Boyce died on 14 May 1981. His papers are part of the [[Northwestern University Library]] Archival and Manuscript Collections.&lt;ref name=northw/&gt;

==Selected publications==
*''The University of Prague: Modern problems of the German university in Czechoslavakia'', [[Robert Hale Publishing|Robert Hale]], 1937. (With [[William Harbutt Dawson]])

'''Paul D. Hudson''' (born 11 February 1956), better known by his stage name '''H.R.''' ('''Human Rights'''), is the British-American lead singer of the [[United States|American]] [[hardcore punk]] band [[Bad Brains]]. His vocal delivery is very diverse, ranging from a rapid-fire nasal whine, to feral growling and screeches, to smooth near-[[crooning]] or staccato reggae rhymes. He has departed the band periodically to pursue solo efforts that are more mellow [[reggae]] than Bad Brains' usual punk/metal offerings. He is the older brother of [[Earl Hudson]], Bad Brains' drummer.

==Musical career==
H.R. and his bandmates became [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] around 1979. This spiritual direction influenced the music of Bad Brains via his vocals, and inspired the creation of his [[reggae]] band, Human Rights (or H.R.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.nyu.edu/~cch223/usa/badbrains_main.html |title=KFTH – Bad Brains Page |publisher=Homepages.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although reggae is the main focus on his solo material, he explores rock and other musical genres. He has had numerous albums released on [[SST Records]]. A ''[[Village Voice]]'' review of a Bad Brains concert described H.R. on stage "like James Brown gone berserk, with a hyperkinetic repertoire of spins, dives, back-flips, splits, and skanks."{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}, although in recent years his stage presence has become more subdued, primarily due to his spiritual development from the O.G. Punk/Rasta to more of a Rasta Elder (at least on stage), as well as his occasional playing of rhythm guitar.

H.R. has collaborated with the [[Long Beach Dub Allstars]] on their song "New Sun" on the ''[[Right Back]]'' album, and with [[P.O.D.]] on their song "Without Jah, Nothin'", on the album ''[[Satellite (P.O.D. album)|Satellite]]''. 

In recent years, H.R.'s Human Rights performances have become markedly more mellow and restrained, focusing primarily on reggae and rasta. This is a stark contrast to his wildly animated, aggressive stage performances of the late 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beastiemania.com/whois/bad_brains/|title=Who Is Who - Bad Brains|first=Raul|last=Pollicino|website=www.beastiemania.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviews with H.R. feature prominently in the 2006 documentary ''[[American Hardcore (film)|American Hardcore]]'', in which he discusses the early days of hardcore in New York City and Washington D.C., and his association with fellow travelers like [[Minor Threat]] and the [[Cro-Mags]]. In particular, he recalls encouraging [[Ian MacKaye]] to fully articulate Minor Threat's emerging [[straight edge]] philosophy, to give young people a positive direction. As depicted in the 2012 documentary ''Bad Brains: A Band in D.C.'', H.R.'s bizarre behavior, such as wearing a motorcycle helmet during a performance and refusing to sing, causes friction with other members of the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/03/bad-brains-documentary-sxsw/|title=Documentary Bad Brains: A Band in D.C. Sheds Light on Punk Group’s Legacy|last=Calore|first=Michael|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2016, the film ''Finding Joseph I: The HR From Bad Brains Documentary'' premiered in Europe and the United States.  This film features interviews with HR, as well as other musicians, peers, and family members; it chronicles his life, struggles, and philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrdocumentary.com/index.html ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film's companion book was released by Lesser Gods in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lessergodsbooks.com/book/finding-joseph-i/ |title=Finding Joseph I - Lesser Gods |publisher=Lessergodsbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
H.R. has adult children from previous relationships and has been married since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.therealofficialhr.com/about/|title=HR's Biography|website=HR Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, H.R.'s wife, Lori, revealed that H.R. suffers from [[SUNCT syndrome]], a rare [[neurological disorder]] which causes sporadic, excruciating headaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kreps|first1=Daniel|title=Bad Brains' H.R.

[[File:Féraud par Bonneville.jpg|thumb|Jean Bertrand Féraud]]'''Jean Bertrand Féraud''', ([[Arreau]] 4 August 1759 or 1764 - [[Paris]] 20 May 1795)&lt;ref&gt;http://parismuseescollections.paris.fr/fr/musee-carnavalet/oeuvres/jean-bertrand-feraud-1759-1795-depute-a-la-convention-1793-1795-1795#infos-principales accessed 16/04/2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/sycomore/fiche/%28num_dept%29/13027 accessed 16/04/2-17&lt;/ref&gt; was a French politician of the [[French revolution|French revolutionary era]].

== Early life ==
Jean Bertrand was the son of Jean-Baptiste Féraud, notary royal, and his wife Jeanne-Marie Casteret. His uncle Félix Féraud, also a notary, was secretary to the last meeting of the Estates of [[Quatre-Vallées]] in [[Arreau]] in 1789.  He studied law, read the [[Encyclopédistes]], and became a [[freemason]].  When the National Guard was formed in Arreau, he joined it at once and became a captain. In this capacity, he was sent to Paris to take part in the [[Fête de la Fédération]] on 14 July 1790.

== Political career ==
A member of the [[Jacobins]], close to [[Robespierre]] and [[Danton]], Jean Bertrand Féraud was elected to the [[National Convention]] in 1792 from [[Hautes-Pyrénées]]. He was elected 5th of 6 deputies, with 145 votes out of 22 cast.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/sycomore/fiche/(num_dept)/13027 accessed 17/04/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

He protested against the expulsion of the [[Girondins]]. He delivered a public speech on 9 [[Germinal (French Republican Calendar)|Germinal]] Year I (29 March 1793) to the People's Society of [[Tarbes]], at the church of Saint Jean, where the pope was burned in effigy. In May 1793 the Convention appointed him [[representant en mission]] to the [[Army of the Pyrenees]] where he was injured charging at the head of a column.&lt;ref&gt;Jean B. Robert, Vie politique de tous les députés à la Convention nationale, pendant et après la Révolution Paris 1814 p.139&lt;/ref&gt; He carried with him a decree forbidding on pain of death the use or storing of gold or silver money and requiring all exchanges to use the [[assignat]]. On 6 September 1793 he was named [[representant en mission]] to the [[Army of the Rhine]] and the [[Army of the Moselle]] which was striking into Germany. He received his orders from [[Lazare Hippolyte Carnot|Lazare Carnot]] as well as directly from the [[Committee of Public Safety]].

In the Convention, he demanded the death penalty for hoarders, and at the end of the [[trial of Louis XVI]] he voted for the death penalty without appeal or reprieve,&lt;ref&gt;Jean B. Robert, Vie politique de tous les députés à la Convention nationale, pendant et après la Révolution p.139 Paris 1814&lt;/ref&gt; but he also attacked [[Jean-Paul Marat]], accusing him of arson, pillage, murder and anarchy. He managed to escape the proscription which fell on most of his [[Girondin]] allies because he was on mission in the countryside.  Attacked on his return to Paris for having voted against Marat and his Girondin associations, he defended himself based on his record with the armies.

During the [[Thermidorean reaction]], he joined the opponents of Robespierre and, together with [[Paul Barras]] and his troops, he broke into the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] to search out the [[The Mountain|Montagnards]] in hiding there.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/sycomore/fiche/(num_dept)/13027 accessed 17/04/2017&lt;/ref&gt;   After this he occupied himself with the reorganisation of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and the [[Committee of General Security]]. He was then sent as a [[representant en mission]] to the [[Army of the North (France)|Army of the North]].[[Antoine Merlin de Thionville]] described him as 'the maddest colleague you could dream of.'

In the winter and spring of Year III (1795), agriculture and trade were in chaos and the currency was rapidly devaluing.  Townspeople were starving as the prices of staple foods rose. The Convention, which had mobilised its armies against external threats and deployed them to repress rebellions in the provinces, could hardly contain the unrest in Paris. During the [[Revolt of 1 Prairial Year III]] the crowds forced their way into the Convention's sessions to demand bread.

Newly placed in charge of supplies for Paris, Féraud tried to harangue the crowd while waiting for reinforcements from the National Guard, but a woman in the crowd, incensed, shot him dead with a pistol. The crowd cut off his head, hoisted it on a pike, and then carried it aloft into the chamber of the Convention in front of its President&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Fremont-Barnes, Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Revolutions and New Ideologies, 1760-1815, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007 p.594&lt;/ref&gt; - who was not [[François Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas|Boissy d'Anglas]] as shown in a famous painting by [[Fragonard]], but [[Theodore Vernier]].&lt;ref&gt;M.

In the tumult, a 50-year-old locksmith's assistant named Jean Tinelle was arrested and condemned to death on 5 [[Prairial]] Year III for having carried the head on the pike. He was the 2,807th and final person to be condemned to death by the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]] before it was suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;Channaud, Liste générale et très-exacte de tous ceux qui ont été condamnés à mort par le Tribunal Révolutionnaire établi à Paris, 1795, vol.2 p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13412">'''Jean-Louis Vignes''' (April 9, 1780 - January 17, 1862), or as he was known to his Mexican neighbors, "Don Luis del Aliso",  was a French settler to the Los Angeles area during the Mexican era. He was the first commercial wine maker in California and one of the first men to import and plant European ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'' grapes in the state.&lt;ref&gt;R. Irvine &amp; W. Clore ''The Wine Project'' pg 41 Sketch Publications 1997 {{ISBN|0-9650834-9-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A skilled cooper by trade and an adventurer and entrepreneur by choice, he arrived in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] on July 6, 1827.&lt;ref&gt;Jore, Léonce. ''Le Bordelais Jean-Louis Vignes, Pionnier de la Viticulture en Californie.'' Revue historique de Bordeaux et du departement de la Gironde. Bordeaux Avril-Juin 1959. Page 136&lt;/ref&gt; After losing his business in Honolulu due to Queen Ka'ahumanu's edict banning alcohol production, he sailed to California and landed at [[Pueblo de Los Angeles]] in 1831.  In 1850, Vignes was the largest wine producer in California.

==Early years in France==
Jean-Louis Vignes was born to Jean Vignes and Elizabeth Cato on April 9, 1780, in [[Béguey]], a village downriver from Cadillac, [[Gironde]] near [[Bordeaux]], France. He grew up with two brothers, Pierre and Pierre Esliens, and two sisters, both named Marie. The Vignes were artisans. They made barrels for the local wine industry, they raised their own wine, and they processed lees to manufacture wine lees ash, which was used to make fertilizer.

On 21 [[pluviose|Pluviôse Year X]], or February 10, 1802, Jean-Louis Vignes married Jeanne Simon, who was the daughter of Etienne Simon and Marie Laillou. They moved into the family house in Béguey which they acquired on December 30, 1816, along with its cellars and workshop, the vines, {{convert|3.2|acre|m2}} of ploughable lands, and "the copper brandy still that contains three barrels." Jean-Louis Vignes paid 2,100 Francs "in good metallic currency". His signature on the contract was adorned with the three dots of the [[Grand Orient de France|Freemasons]].&lt;ref&gt;Contract signed on December 30, 1816 in the offices of Maître Desarnault, notary in Cadillac. Archives Départementales de la Gironde, Bordeaux, France&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Louis Vignes became a local public figure. He was often a witness to marriages and contracts. In 1820, he managed the census in [[Cadillac, Gironde|Cadillac]], and his name stood prominently at the top of the list. At the end of 1820, his mortgages exceeded 20,000 francs and he ran into financial difficulties. On April 25, 1826, he stopped paying his father the pension he owed, and all his properties were mortgaged.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal du Palais présentant la jurisprudence de la cour de cassation et des courts d'appel de Paris et des autres départements''. Tome II. Paris 1830. Page 116&lt;/ref&gt; He may also have had political troubles. Indeed, in 1824 the new king was the ultra-royalist [[Charles X (France)|Charles X]], who, in an attempt to erase the effects of the Revolution, gave all the public jobs to nobles, and all the citizens who had held public positions under the Republic were considered suspect. Father [[Alexis Bachelot]], who would hear Vignes in confession much later, wrote in a private letter: "Vignes was driven to leave his country after troubles caused by his loyalty, misunderstood considerateness, and too much facility to be of help."&lt;ref&gt;Jore, Léonce. op.cit. Page 136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sandwich Islands (Hawaii)==
Jean-Louis Vignes obtained a passport in Bordeaux. He was described on the application as 45 years old, 5’8" tall, with brown hair and brown eyes, and an oval face with a big nose and a round chin. On November 17, 1826, he boarded the commerce vessel "Comète", which was under the command of Captain Antoine Plassiard. On November 20, 1826, the "Comète" left the [[Gironde estuary]] and entered the Atlantic Ocean with her approximately 30 passengers and her large crew.&lt;ref&gt;Mouly, R.P. SS.CC. ''De la Guillotine aux Iles du Pacifique. Le Père Marie-Joseph Coudrin Fondateur de la Congrégation des Sacrés-Coeurs 1768-1837''. Tolra, Editeur. Paris 1939. Page 156&lt;/ref&gt; After stops at ''[[Isla de los Estados]]'' (Argentina), [[Valparaíso]] (Chile), [[Quilca District|Quilca]] and [[Callao]] (Peru) and [[Mazatlán]] (Mexico),&lt;ref&gt;Mouly, R.P. SS.CC. ''Des Français en Amérique Espagnole (1827-1957)''. Lectures Missionaires. Paris 1957. Pages 12-18&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Comète'' landed in [[Honolulu]] on July 6, 1827. Jean-Louis Vignes settled to start a new life on a small property about three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) from Honolulu and started raising sugar cane, vines, turkeys, and a few cattle. In October 1828, he was hired as manager of Oahu's rum distillery and sent 60 piasters to his family that had remained in France.&lt;ref&gt;De Morineau, Philippe. ''Précis Historique de l’Expédition des Iles Sandwich et des Causes de sa Mauvaise Réussite''. Nouvelles Annales des Voyages et des Sciences Géographiques. Tome 61. Paris, Janvier, Février, Mars 1834. Page 316&lt;/ref&gt; However, the manufacture and sale of liquor did not sit well with the [[Hiram Bingham I|Reverend Hiram Bingham]] and his puritan flock. Reverend Bingham successfully pressured Queen [[Kaahumanu]] to outlaw the sale of rum. In December 1829, the distillery was closed and the sugar cane plantations were destroyed.

In 1830, Jean-Louis Vignes sailed from Oahu on the trading bark "Louisa", under the command of Captain George Wood. The vessel was owned by [[John Coffin Jones]] and was a permanent link between the islands and the west coast of North America. She had come from Boston with a cargo of assorted merchandise to trade in the Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, William Heath. Op.cit. Page 1&lt;/ref&gt; Vignes landed in [[Monterey (California)|Monterey]], [[Alta California]], on June 26, 1831.&lt;ref&gt;Foucrier, Annick. ''Le rêve californien. Migrants français sur la côte Pacifique''. Éditions Belin. Paris 1999. Page 52&lt;/ref&gt; On July 15, 1831, Vignes applied for a Mexican ''carta de seguridad'', stating his occupation as [[Cooper (profession)|cooper]] and distiller.&lt;ref&gt;Carosso, Vincent P. Op.cit. Page 172&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, he is often called Juan-Luis Vignes in period documents.

==Los Angeles==
Upon arriving in Los Angeles in 1831, Jean-Louis Vignes bought {{convert|104|acre|km2}} of land located between the original Pueblo and the banks of the [[Los Angeles River]]. He planted a vineyard and started preparing to make wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The grapes available at the time, of the [[Mission (grape)|Mission variety]], were brought to Alta California by the [[Franciscan]] Brothers at the end of the 18th century. They grew well and yielded large quantities of wine, but Jean-Louis Vignes was not satisfied with the results. Therefore, he decided to import better vines from Bordeaux, [[Cabernet Franc]] and [[Sauvignon blanc]].&lt;ref&gt;Idwall, Jones. ''Vines in the Sun: A Journey Through the California Vineyards.'' William Morrow and Co. New York, 1949. Page 212&lt;/ref&gt;  The vines transited around Cape Horn. To preserve their roots during the long trip, they were inserted in moss and potato slices. Vignes became the first [[Californio]] who grew quality vines, and the first who aged his wines. The common practice at the time was to drink the wine as soon as it was fermented. The exact date of his first vintage is unknown. However, it was probably before 1837, because in 1857 he ran an advertisement claiming that some of his wines were 20 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Newmark, Harris, ''Sixty Years in Southern California 1853-1913''. Fourth Edition. Dawson's Book Shop, Los Angeles 1984. Page 200&lt;/ref&gt;  The wood for the barrels came from land Vignes owned in the [[San Bernardino Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;Foucrier, Annick. Op. Cit. Page 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840, Jean-Louis Vignes made the first recorded shipment of California wine. The Los Angeles market was too small for his production, and he loaded a shipment on the Monsoon, bound for Northern California.&lt;ref&gt;Foucrier, Annick. Op. Cit. Page 53&lt;/ref&gt; By 1842, he made regular shipments to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] and San Francisco.  By 1849, ''El Aliso'', was the most extensive vineyard in California. Vignes owned over 40,000 vines and produced 150,000 bottles, or 1000 barrels, per year.&lt;ref&gt;McGroarty, John Steven. ''History of Los Angeles County''. The American Historical Society. Chicago and New York 1923. Page 31&lt;/ref&gt;

As a prominent citizen of Los Angeles, Jean-Louis Vignes met and entertained such well known men as [[General William Tecumseh Sherman]], [[Thomas O. Larkin|Thomas Larkin]], [[William Heath Davis]] and [[Thomas ap Catesby Jones]]. His wine was drunk all over California and samples were sent to President Tyler in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, William Heath. ''Seventy Five Years in California.'' John Howell. San Francisco. 1929. Page 120&lt;/ref&gt; and to France.

He was quite successful in agriculture. In 1834, he brought a few orange trees from [[Mission San Gabriel]], and planted the first orange grove in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consulfrance-losangeles.org/article.php3?id_article=304 History of the French community in Los Angeles]  Consulate General of France in Los Angeles {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811221937/http://www.consulfrance-losangeles.org/article.php3?id_article=304 |date=August 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1851, he wrote that his two orange groves produced between 5000 and 6000 oranges per season. He also grew 400 peach trees, as well as apricots, pears, apples, figs, and walnuts.&lt;ref&gt;McGroarty, John Steven. ''Los Angeles, From the Mountains to the Sea''. The American Historical Society. Chicago and New York. 1921. Page 189&lt;/ref&gt;

Vignes was the patentee of both [[Rancho Temecula]] and the adjacent [[Rancho Pauba]] in the Temecula Valley.

In 1855, Jean-Louis Vignes sold ''El Aliso'' to his nephews [[Pierre Sainsevain]] and [[Pierre Sainsevain#Jean Louis Sainsevain|Jean-Louis Sainsevain]] for $40,000, the largest sum of money ever paid for real estate in California at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Carosso, Vincent P. ''The California Wine Industry 1830-1895''. University of California Press. Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1951. Page 10&lt;/ref&gt; After his retirement, Vignes continued to be involved in the community. In 1856, he made a large gift to the Catholic Sisters of Charity to participate in the financing of the first hospital, which opened on May 31, 1858. He also contributed to the founding of the first Los Angeles public school.

Jean-Louis Vignes died in Los Angeles on January 17, 1862, at the age of 82.

==Family of immigrants==
Proud of his achievements, Jean-Louis Vignes wrote to his family members back in [[Cadillac, Gironde|Cadillac]] and urged them to join him in California. Almost twenty of them followed him: three of his five children (Marie, Jeanne, Jean) and their respective families; his youngest brother (Pierre Esliens);&lt;ref&gt;Foucrier, Annick. Op. Cit. Page 39&lt;/ref&gt; four nephews (Pierre Sainsevain, Jean-Louis Sainsevain, Jean-Marie Vignes, Vital Vignes) as well as numerous friends of the family. Jean-Louis's wife Jeanne never left France and died in Béguey in 1842.

The area around Vignes' estate had, by the 1850s, become the center of French settlers in Los Angeles, which fully numbered around one tenth of the European and Yankee population at the time, and was known as "French Town".

Vignes and Aliso Streets, in modern-day Los Angeles, commemorate Jean-Louis Vignes contribution to California's history and wine industry.

==Other names==
Alternative names are often found in the literature and in official documents to refer to Jean-Louis Vignes. The most common are: Don Luis del Aliso.

[[File:Jean Smart at 2008 HBO Emmys party 2.jpg|thumb|190px|left|Smart after her Primetime Emmy Award win on September 21, 2008]]
In 2000, Smart was cast as [[Minor characters on Frasier|Lana Gardner]] on the hit show ''[[Frasier]]'', set in her hometown of Seattle.

It’s nice to get nominated and win for something you were particularly proud of. At the time I was a little bit snobby about doing guest parts. Based on what I don’t know. It wasn’t something I was seeking. But my agent said, “You have to read this.” I thought it was hilarious and the show was brilliant so I didn’t even hesitate. I remember when we did the table read with the rest of the cast we could hardly get through it we were laughing so hard."&lt;ref name= berkshire /&gt;

The same year, she played in a Broadway production of ''[[The Man Who Came to Dinner]]'', which earned her a [[Tony Award]] nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roundabouttheatre.org/Shows-Events/Events/Benefit-Readings/The-Man-Who-Came-to-Dinner.aspx|work=Roundabout Theatre Company|title=The Man Who Came to Dinner|accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, she landed roles in several high-profile films including ''[[Sweet Home Alabama (film)|Sweet Home Alabama]]'' (2002), playing the mother in law of [[Reese Witherspoon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sweet Home Alabama (2002)|url=http://www.dustinputman.com/reviews/s/02_sweethome.htm|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the comedy ''[[Bringing Down the House (film)|Bringing Down The House]]'' (2002), opposite [[Queen Latifah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bringing Down the House|url=http://movies.about.com/library/weekly/blbringingdownpicsa.htm| work= [[About.com]]|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also had a supporting role in the independent drama ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]'' (2004).

===US economy and budget===
Throughout his political career, DeMint has favored a type of tax reform that would replace the federal income tax with a national sales tax and, in addition, abolish the [[Internal Revenue Service]].&lt;ref name=Conason&gt;{{cite news |title=The DeMint factor |author=Joe Conason |url=http://www.salon.com/2004/10/08/demint_5/ |work=Salon |date=October 7, 2004 |accessdate=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has supported many changes to federal spending, such as prioritizing a [[balanced budget amendment]] instead of increasing the national [[United States debt ceiling|debt limit]].&lt;ref name=Karl&gt;{{cite news |title=Fighting Words: DeMint Warns Republicans They May Be 'Gone' if They Support Debt Ceiling Increase |author=Jonathan Karl |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senator-jim-demint-warns-republicans-debt-ceiling-vote/story?id=13916811#.UczTdbuYYYw |work=ABC |date=June 24, 2011 |accessdate=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a senator, DeMint proposed a two-year [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] ban to prevent members of Congress from spending federal money on projects in their home states.&lt;ref name=Chebium&gt;{{cite news |title=Showdown Looms as Jim DeMint Faction Presses for Earmark Ban |author=Raju Chebium |url=http://www.wltx.com/news/story.aspx?storyid=106693 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130830191005/http://www.wltx.com/news/story.aspx?storyid=106693 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 30, 2013 |work=WLTX |date=November 12, 2010 |accessdate=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, presidential candidates [[John McCain]], [[Hillary Clinton]], and [[Barack Obama]] co-sponsored DeMint's earmark reform proposal, although it ultimately failed to pass in the Senate.&lt;ref name=Politifact&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/12/jim-demint/sen-jim-demint-says-obeys-partial-earmark-ban-woul/ |title=Sen.

DeMint was opposed to the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] and the bailouts during the [[Automotive industry crisis of 2008–10|automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010]].

===Clashes with the Obama administration===
In October 2009, after the Honduran Army, on orders from the Honduran Supreme Court, [[2009 Honduran coup d'état|removed]] [[Manuel Zelaya]] as President, DeMint visited the country to gather information.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; The trip was approved by Senate [[Minority Leader]] [[Mitch McConnell]] but opposed by Foreign Relations Committee Chairman [[John Kerry]].

In late 2009, DeMint criticized [[Barack Obama]] for waiting eight months into his first term as president before nominating a new head of the [[Transportation Security Administration]].&lt;ref name=Carty&gt;{{cite news |title=DeMint: Obama "Has Downplayed Terrorism" |author=Daniel Carty |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-6037313-503544.html |work=CBS |date=December 30, 2009 |accessdate=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the attempted bombing of [[Northwest Flight 253]] in December 2009, DeMint stated that President Obama had not put enough focus on terrorism while in office.&lt;ref name=Carty/&gt;

===Foreign policy===
In 1999, DeMint voted against the [[NATO]] intervention during the [[Kosovo war]].&lt;ref name=OnTheIssues&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/jim_demint.htm |title=Jim DeMint |work=ontheissues.org |publisher=On The Issues |accessdate=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeMint voted to authorize military force in [[Iraq]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=OnTheIssues/&gt; In 2011, DeMint voted in favor of [[Rand Paul]]'s resolution opposing [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military involvement]] in [[Libya]].&lt;ref name=Shiner/&gt;&lt;ref name=OnTheIssues/&gt; He favored preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons over a policy of containment after their development.&lt;ref name="otiwarnpeace"&gt;[http://www.ontheissues.org/International/Jim_DeMint_War_+_Peace.htm "Jim DeMint on War &amp; Peace"] ''ontheissues.org''.

DeMint is firmly opposed to [[same-sex marriage]]. In his book ''Now or Never: Saving America from Economic Collapse'', DeMint states:

{{quote|Does government have the right to reshape cultural mores by redefining religious institutions to sanction behavior that is considered immoral by all the world's religions? In America, people should have a right to live with whomever they want, but redefining marriage to promote behavior that is deemed costly and destructive is not the proper role of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Archive/Now_Or_Never_Jim_DeMint.htm |title=Jim DeMint in Now Or Never, by Jim DeMint |publisher=OnTheIssues.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

DeMint also argues that same-sex marriage infringes upon religious liberty:

{{quote|We just cannot have, particularly the federal government, redefining marriage or telling us what is right or wrong. And if we help America understand that, folks, we're not trying to get the government to do it our way or your way; what we're asking for is the freedom to allow people to live out their faith and values and their lives the way they want. And we believe that our side will win because I'm convinced that most Americans want to have decent moral lives and share our same values. But if the government continues to press in the wrong direction, it begins to change our culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2012_Values_Voters.htm |title=2012 Values Voters Summit |publisher=OnTheIssues.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

DeMint has repeatedly voted for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="civilrights"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/domestic/Jim_DeMint_Civil_Rights.htm |title=Jim DeMint on Civil Rights |publisher=OnTheIssues.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also voted to ban same-sex adoption in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="civilrights"/&gt; DeMint drew considerable criticism by saying that openly gay teachers should be banned from teaching in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/SC_Senate.htm |title=SC Senate debate analysis |publisher=Charleston City Paper |date=2004-10-22 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human Rights Campaign]] gives DeMint a score of 0% on gay rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Notebook/Note_06n-HRC.htm |title=Public Notes on 06n-HRC |publisher=OnTheIssues.org |date=2006-12-31 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeMint voted against the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], also known as Obamacare, in December 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00396 U.S. Senate: Legislation &amp; Records Home &gt; Votes &gt; Roll Call Vote]&lt;/ref&gt; and he voted against the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00105 |title=U.S. Senate: Legislation &amp; Records Home &gt; Votes &gt; Roll Call Vote |publisher=Senate.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns==

===1998 through 2002===
DeMint served as an informal advisor to Fourth District congressman [[Bob Inglis]] from 1993 to 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/demint/biography.htm |title=Biography on DeMint's House site |accessdate=2003-02-12 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030212092139/http://www.house.gov/demint/biography.htm |archivedate=2003-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Inglis kept his promise to serve only three terms and gave up his seat to run for the Senate against [[Fritz Hollings]], DeMint entered the Republican [[primary election|primary]] for the district, which includes Greenville and [[Spartanburg]]. The district is considered the most Republican in the state, and it was understood that whoever won the primary would be heavily favored to be the district's next congressman.

DeMint finished second in the primary behind [[South Carolina Senate|State Senator]] and fellow Greenville resident [[Michael L. Fair|Michael Fair]], even though he didn't carry a single county in the district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=83888 Our Campaigns – SC District 04 – R Primary Race – Jun 09, 1998&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the runoff, DeMint defeated Fair by only 2,030 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=83889 Our Campaigns – SC District 04 – R Primary Run-Off Race – Jun 23, 1998&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He then defeated Democratic State Senator [[Glenn G.

===2004===
{{Main|United States Senate election in South Carolina, 2004}}
DeMint declared his candidacy for the Senate on December 12, 2002, after Hollings announced that he would retire after the 2004 elections. DeMint was supposedly the [[White House]]'s preferred candidate in the Republican primary.

In the Republican primary on June 8, 2004, DeMint placed a distant second, 18 percentage points behind former governor [[David Beasley]] and just barely ahead of [[Thomas Ravenel]]. Ravenel endorsed DeMint in the following runoff. DeMint won the runoff handily, however.

DeMint then faced [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] state education superintendent [[Inez Tenenbaum]] in the November general election. DeMint led Tenenbaum through much of the campaign and ultimately defeated her by 9.6 percentage points. DeMint's win meant that South Carolina was represented by two Republican Senators for the first time since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], when [[Thomas J. Robertson]] and [[John J. Patterson]] served together as Senators.

DeMint stirred controversy during debates with Tenenbaum when he stated his belief that openly [[homosexuality|gay]] people should not be allowed to teach in [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. When questioned by reporters, DeMint also stated that [[single mother]]s who live with their boyfriends should similarly be excluded from being educators.&lt;ref name="want apology Kinnard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Radnofsky"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Big Read: As U.S. political split widened, a friendship fell into the rift|first1=Louise |last1=Radnofsky|first2=Michael M. |last2=Phillips|work=Wall Street Journal|date=November 11, 2010|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later apologized for making the remarks, saying they were "distracting from the main issues of the debate."

Prior to the 2010 elections, DeMint founded the [[Senate Conservatives Fund]] (SCF), a political action committee that is "dedicated to electing strong conservatives to the United States Senate" and that is associated with the Tea Party movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://senateconservatives.com/site/about Senate Conservatives Fund — About]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/02/mcconnells-repeal-vote-rallies-the-base/70612/ McConnell's Repeal Vote Rallies the Base – Chris Good – Politics – The Atlantic]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/140637-demint-to-iowa-amid-denials-of-presidential-run DeMint to Iowa amid denials of presidential run – The Hill's Blog Briefing Room]&lt;/ref&gt;  As of February 2011, DeMint continued to serve as Chair of SCF, which states that it raised $9.1 million toward the 2010 U.S. Senate elections and which endorsed successful first-time Senate candidates [[Pat Toomey]], [[Rand Paul]], [[Mike Lee (American politician)|Mike Lee]], [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]],  [[Marco Rubio]]  .&lt;ref&gt;[http://senateconservatives.com Senate Conservatives Fund]&lt;/ref&gt; DeMint also supported Joe Miller of Alaska through the SCF. Miller was  an attorney and former federal magistrate and the Tea Party's candidate opposing Lisa Murkowski the incumbent senator in the Alaska primary. Miller won in a close election, however Murkowski ran as a write in candidate and won the election by 39.1% to Miller's 35.1% and by a popular vote of 101,091 to 90,839 respectively.

On October 1, 2010, DeMint, in comments that echoed what he had said in 2004, told a rally of his supporters that openly homosexual and unmarried sexually active people should not be teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Shackleford, Lynne P.

On December 6, 2012, DeMint announced he would resign from the Senate before the [[113th United States Congress|113th Congress]] convened in January 2013 to become president of [[The Heritage Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Henninger06122012"&gt;Henninger, Daniel.

On May 2, 2017, DeMint submitted his resignation after a unanimous vote by the Foundation's board of trustees.&lt;ref name="heritage1"/&gt;

==Citizens for Self-Governance==
In June 2017, DeMint became a senior advisor to [[Citizens for Self-Governance]], a group which is seeking to call a [[convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution]] in order to reduce federal government spending and power. According to DeMint, "The Tea Party needs a new mission. They realize that all the work they did in 2010 has not resulted in all the things they hoped for. Many of them are turning to Article V." The proposed constitutional convention would impose fiscal restraint on Washington D.C., reduce the federal government's authority over states, and impose term limits on federal officials.&lt;ref name=USA/&gt;

==Conservative Partnership Institute==
In 2017, DeMint founded the Conservative Partnership Institute, of which he serves as chairman.&lt;ref name="pol1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/25/jim-demint-conservative-partnership-institute-240933 |date=July 26, 2017 |publisher=''[[Politico]]'' |title=DeMint launches new group to boost conservatives in Washington |first=Jake |last=Lahut}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pol2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/13/white-house-hill-job-fair-645592 |publisher=''[[Politico]]'' |date=June 13, 2018 |title=Trump White House advertises at a Hill job fair amid staff exodus |first=Annie |last=Karni |quote=The fair is being hosted by the Conservative Partnership Institute, an organization founded by former Heritage Foundation president Jim DeMint last year.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stated purpose of the CPI is the professional development of conservative staffers and elected officials.&lt;ref name="pol1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1966">'''Joel (Jo) Walker''', also known as '''JOEL''' or '''Sculptress JOEL'''  is an English sculptor, [[animalier]], known for depicting animals. 

She was commissioned to make a statue of a dog for [[Garsdale railway station]] ([[Settle-Carlisle Railway]]). She was chosen for her detailed work, and portraits of animals. This project attracted the attention of the media including the national press.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2645720/Dog-who-stayed-by-dead-masters-side-for-11-weeks-honoured-with-statue.html  Dog who stayed by dead master's side for 11 weeks honoured with statue], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

She has won prizes for her work including the  [http://www.giftoftheyear.co.uk/ Gift of the Year award] 1994 (Collectibles and Figurines).  
Her work is generally figurative in style, capturing the detailed expressions and attributes of her subjects. Most sculptures are cast by the [[Lost-wax casting|lost wax process]] into Bronze.

Her sculptures have also been used by different Societies as awards and trophies, and in the past she has specialized in the portraits of famous breeds of horses, such as the [[Shire horse]] and [[Shetland pony|Shetland ponies]]. This led to the commission of the centenary sculptures for the Welsh Pony and Cob Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpcs.uk.com/ Welsh Pony and Cob Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another sculpture by the Sculptress JOEL of a famous equestrian subject is that of [[Lady Godiva]]. This brave lady is shown to be riding out on her quest for justice, her head lifted up, one hand holding the mane of the fine Spanish stallion  and her  other hand  gripping the folds of her fallen cloak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rutlandopenstudios.co.uk/photo_3818925.html Rutland Open Studios]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Heskett''', (1937- February, 2014) was a British writer and lecturer on the economic, political, cultural and human value of industrial design. Heskett was a professor at the Institute of Design, [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (1989–2004) and school of design at [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]] (2004–11) teaching in  [[Design history]], [[Design Thinking]], he became the acting dean of the latter (2011–12). He was also a visiting professor at universities in Turkey, Japan, Chile, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.
Between the late 1970s and 2010, he has published ''Industrial Design, Toothpicks and logos: design in everyday life, Design: a very short introduction'' and other books. These were considered as significant contributions to the history of design, to the study of design policy and latterly to the theoretical and applied articulation of the economic value created by design, first in the United Kingdom, then in the United States and, in the last decade of his life, in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sparke|first1=Penny|title=John Heskett obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/12/john-heskett|website=the guardian|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born in Coventry in 1937, Heskett went to the [[Humphrey Perkins School]] in Barrow upon Soar, Leicestershire (1947–54), did national service and gained a degree in economics, politics and history at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dilnot|first=Clive|date=2014-01-01|title=John Heskett (1937–2014)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v078/78.dilnot.html|journal=History Workshop Journal|volume=78|issue=1|pages=309–313|issn=1477-4569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
With his background, Heskett began to write history considering social, economic and political as components of design. In the early 1970s he became part of the emerging first generation of historians of design. 
A variety of jobs followed before he obtained a design history post at [[Lanchester Polytechnic]] (1967–77). Then he taught design history and theory in Sheffield,
and at [[Ravensbourne College]], Bromley, in south-east London (1984–89).
In the late 1970s, John became a prominent member of a group of academics based in several of Britain's art schools (then part of the polytechnics – he was at Sheffield City) who developed the discipline of design history and theory, later to become subsumed under the broader. His first book, Industrial Design, appeared in 1980 and was instantly successful since it provided one of the first accounts of industrial design as responses to changes in production methods and the organization of capitalism.

===In United States===
Heskett left the United Kingdom for the United States in 1988, first to work on a project with the Design Management Institute in Boston, and then after 1989, to teach in the graduate programmes in the Institute of Design at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in Chicago. By 1990 he was working for a Japanese consultancy and throughout the next decades he was invited to speak and advise at institutional and government level in Mexico, Chile, Finland, Japan, Taiwan and South Africa.

===In Hong Kong===
Since 2004, in Hong Kong, Heskett undertook teaching and research on the roles of design in production and more widely in the economy as a whole, examining design policy at national levels in the United States, Europe and, increasingly, Asia.

Heskett was a member of the [[INDEX: Design to Improve Life]] Award Jury since 2004 and a board member of [[CIID]] since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://designtoimprovelife.dk/can-the-centre-hold/|title=CAN THE CENTRE HOLD? - INDEX: Design to Improve Life®|website=INDEX: Design to Improve Life®|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ciid.dk/about/board/john-heskett/|title=Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design  » John Heskett 1937 – 2014|website=ciid.dk|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Heskett is survived by his second wife, Pamela Smith, whom he married in 1992; his daughter, Ingrid, and son, Peter, both from his first marriage, to Irene Alksnis, which ended in divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://johnheskett.com/intro/|title=Introduction - JOHN HESKETT|website=JOHN HESKETT|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Hansen (April 26, 1863 – June 29, 1943)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sterbeurkunde Nr. 399 vom 3. Juli 1943, Standesamt Köln III|periodical=LAV NRW R Personenstandsregister|publisher=|url=http://historischesarchivkoeln.de/lav/getimage.php?img=/Personenstandsregister/Standesamt_Koeln_III/Sterbefaelle/1943/1943_Bd_02/0069.jpg|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-10-05|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a German historian of witchcraft and an archivist in the city of [[Cologne]] where he was killed by a bombing during World War II.

== Life, Education, and Publications ==

Joseph Leonhard Hansen was born in 1863 in Aachen and studied at the Universities of Bonn, Berlin, and Münster, earning a doctorate in 1883. From 1891 until his retirement in 1927, he was director of the [[Historical_Archive_of_the_City_of_Cologne|Historical Archive of the City of Cologne]]. From 1893 to 1927 he was also chairman of the Society for Rhenish History.

Hansen has been referred to as liberal and "freethinking."&lt;ref&gt; HR Trevor-Roper "Religion, The Reformation, and Social Change" (1967) p 276&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen was raised Catholic in Aachen and resided in historically Catholic Cologne, with its famous [[Cologne Cathedral]], nonetheless some have referred to him as "anti-clerical."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Hansen (Hrsg.): Quellen zur Geschichte des Rheinlandes im Zeitalter der Französischen Revolution 1780–1801. Rezension in Sehepunkte 6, 2006, Nr. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, Hansen published ''Zauberwahn, Inquisition und Hexenprozess im Mittelalter und die Entstehung der grossen Hexenverfolgung'' (Magical Illusion, Inquisition, and Witch Trials in the Middle Ages, and the Formation of the Larger Persecution of Witches) and the following year (1901) a companion volume of background materials (''Quellen'' = Sources) was published  titled, ''Quellen und Untersuchungen zur Geschichte des Hexenwahns und der Hexenverfolgung im Mittelalter: Mit einer Untersuchung der Geschichte des Wortes Hexe.'' 

Hansen also published a German translation of [[Henry Charles Lea]]'s three-volume ''History of the Inquisition in the Middle Ages''. 

In 1921, Hansen was elected a corresponding member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref&gt; Holger Krahnke: Die Mitglieder der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen 1751–2001 (= Abhandlungen der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, Philologisch-Historische Klasse. Folge 3, Bd. 246 = Abhandlungen der Akademie der Wissenschaften in Göttingen, Mathematisch-Physikalische Klasse. Folge 3, Bd. 50). Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, Göttingen 2001, {{ISBN|3-525-82516-1}}, S. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, he was accepted as a corresponding member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Mitglieder der Vorgängerakademien. Joseph Hansen. Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften, abgerufen am 1. April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, age 80 Hansen and his wife Johanna (1872-1943) were killed in a bombing raid on Cologne.

== Influence on Witchcraft Studies ==
[[Wolfgang Behringer]] writes that Hansen "unquestionably delivered the consummate synthesis of previous witchcraft studies."&lt;ref&gt; Wolgang Behringer in "Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe" ed. Jonathan Barry, Marianne Hester, and Gareth Roberts (1996) p 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Two historians of witchcraft who were contemporaries of Hansen -- GL Burr and GL Kittredge-- both acknowledged the importance of Hansen. GL Burr writing in 1911 refers to Hansen as "the most eminent German scholar who has... given the world the most careful book on the rise of conception..."&lt;ref&gt; GL Burr, [https://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44817262.pdf New England's Place in Witchcraft] (1911) p 191&lt;/ref&gt; English professor GL Kittredge writing in 1907 was arguably forwarding an anti-thetical view to that of Hansen, yet quoted him at length in untranslated German.&lt;ref&gt; GL Kittredge, [https://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44817238.pdf Notes on Witchcraft] (1907) fn 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1965, [[Carlo Ginzburg]] refers to the "fundamental investigations of J. Hansen, more precisely, have demonstrated how the image of diabolical witchcraft, with all its appendages... was developed between the mid-thirteenth and mid-fifteenth centuries largely through the efforts of theologians and inquisitors... All this... has been documented exhaustively... Thus the goal of the present research is to document and build upon the approach to the question originally developed by Hansen."&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Ginzburg, "The Night Battles" (1966) transl. John &amp; Anne Tedeschi (1983) p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

In a lengthy 1967 essay on the European witch trials, [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] frequently cites Hansen's "important" work. Historian [[HC Erik Midelfort]] refers to Hansen as "the great scholar" in his first work on witchcraft in Germany.&lt;ref&gt; HC Erik Midelfort, "Witchhunting in Southwestern Germany 1562-1684 (1972) p7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]] does not cite or refer to J. Hansen in his work on the subject of witchcraft "Religion and the Decline of Magic" though the title seems similar, albeit inverted, to Hansen's work from 1900.&lt;ref&gt; Keith Thomas "Religion and the Decline of Magic" (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; Writing a few years after K. Thomas, [[Richard Kieckhefer]] acknowledges "no small influence" from K. Thomas while relying heavily on the work of J. Hansen including over a hundred citations in the "Calendar of Witch Trials." &lt;ref&gt; Richard Kieckhefer, "European Witch Trials" (1976) p.106-118, ix,&lt;/ref&gt; Kieckhefer also joins [[Norman Cohn]] (1975) in expressing strong reservations toward one of Hansen's sources (Baron [[Lamothe-Langon]] see below). &lt;ref&gt; Kieckhefer,"Europe's Witch Trials" p. ix, 17&lt;/ref&gt;  

Historians Alan Charles Kors and Edward Peters refer to Hansen as "the great archivist of Cologne" and consider his two works the most important scholarship from the turn of the century. &lt;ref&gt; "Witchcraft in Europe, 400-1700: A Documentary History" ed. Alan Charles Kors &amp; Edward Peters (2000) p. 25 &lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their influence, Hansen's works were not translated into English during the 20th century. 

In 2011, a work that tracked and translated into English a selection of the sources used by Hansen in ''Quellen'' was published by P. G. Maxwell-Stuart.

=== Questions Regarding A Source: Lamothe-Langon ===


In his work on witchcraft, Hansen relied on a vast number of sources and typically included lengthy quotations. These quotes are most often in the original ecclesiastical Latin, the [[lingua franca]] of Europe since the time of [[Jerome]]. In ''Zauberwahn'' these quotes are often placed within the footnotes, and they are featured prominently in the companion work ''Quellen'' ("sources").  With regard to one source, Baron Lamothe-Langon, Hansen writes that he consulted with Professor Ch. Molinier "the best expert on the inquisition in the south of France" who confirmed that archives used by Lamothe-Langon can no longer be found (''nicht mehr aufzufinden sind''). Under these circumstances (''Unter diesen Umständen mussen'') Hansen laments that he can therefore only provide the full extracts in French, as Hansen seems to believe that, before they were lost, the original Latin documents written by the inquisitors were roughly translated into French by Lamothe-Langon as he compiled a three volume work on the inquisition.&lt;ref&gt; Hansen (1901) p. 449-450&lt;/ref&gt;


Writing in 1972, JB Russell follows Hansen in lamenting the missing Latin originals, and that "we must rely upon a summary translation, and though Lamothe-Langon was a careful scholar, we have no way of knowing what was the word he translated as 'sabbat'."  The Latin word "sabbatum" occurs frequently in Jerome's Latin [[vulgate]] and would have been familiar to all within the medieval Church. Twelfth century inquisitors who were operating in Toulouse France sometimes referred to Waldensiens as ''Inzabbbatos''.&lt;ref&gt;Phillipus van Limborch, [https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NohCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=GBS.PA88 History of the Inquisition], p 88 [https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=cysymJOAxLwC&amp;pg=GBS.PP60 1692 Latin edition]&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of the word "sabbatum" as a shorthand to represent a gathering of more than one witch seems most traceable to Francophone writers such as [[Pierre de Lancre]] (1612). Lamothe-Langon, also writing in French, may have helped spread the use of the word as shorthand, and Hansen uses it frequently writing in German. But most fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth century writers who joined in the witchcraft debate seem to rarely, if ever, use the Latin "sabbatum" or vernacular derivatives thereof. &lt;ref&gt; Jeffrey Burton Russell, ''Witchcraft in the Middle Ages'' (1972) p.328 n.26&lt;/ref&gt;  


Writing in 1976, R Kieckhefer cites Russell's work and seems to have become intrigued by his comment regarding the word 'sabbat' but he departs from Russell's view of Lamothe-Langon as a reliable source: "What historians have failed to recognize, however, is that there is serious reason to believe that Lamothe-Langon's texts are forgeries." Kieckhefer bases this on "certain inaccuracies and anachronisms... In particular, Lamothe-Langon uses the word 'Sabbath' in rendering documents for fourteenth-century diabolical assemblies, though this word did not begin to displace the term 'synagogue' of 'synagogue of Satan' until well into the fifteenth century." Kieckhefer cites Russell (as quoted above) but does not provide other sources to support his claims regarding "Sabbath" or "synagogue" or "synagogue of Satan" or whether he means in Latin or a vernacular language.  In a 2002 reprint of an excerpt from the same 1976 work by Kieckhefer, the citation of Russell is removed and replaced with a broad statement: "The Lamothe-Langon texts are now generally regarded as fakes." &lt;ref&gt; The Witchcraft Reader, ed. Darren Oldridge (2002) p. 29, 35 n.11 &lt;/ref&gt; Kieckhefer points out that Norman Cohn shares his opinion (see below), and is careful to note their conclusions were reached independently. A citation that helps explain the serendipity is not included in the 2002 reprint but appeared in 1976: "Cohn and I both based our discoveries in large part on the biographical data in [Richard] Switzer's book of 1962." &lt;ref&gt; Kieckhefer (1976) p. 17, 157 &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Lamothe-Langon}}

=== Norman Cohn's Wider Criticism ===

Writing in 1975, Norman Cohn seems to go further than Kieckhefer. For Cohn, questions about the unreliability of Lamothe-Langon, originally based on a biography, seem to have moved from an intriquing and speculative theory into established fact, and Cohn broadens the issue from pertaining to a handful of documents into what he deems a "spectacular historical hoax." &lt;ref&gt;Cohn (1975) p 187&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the heading "How the Great Witch-Hunt Did Not Start," Cohn lists a number of trials from 1275 to 1360, many of which are included in the work of Hansen (and Soldan), and Cohn claims they are all "false from start to finish. None of these things happened." &lt;ref&gt;Cohn (1975)p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; However, a couple pages later, Cohn concedes that there was a "sole contemporary mention" of a witch trial around 1275" but this trial was for "simple sorcery." (Cohn doesn't provide the Latin term for "simple sorcery.") 

Further on, Cohn again qualifies his initial statement and concedes yet another trial from the list did happen, "In 1329, the inquisitor of Carcassonne did sentence a monk to life imprisonment for practicing love magic..." &lt;ref&gt; Cohn (1975) p.186&lt;/ref&gt; Cohn doesn't provide his source for this "love magic" trial but it can be found in ''Quellen'' where Hansen cites the work of HC Lea and Lea includes the entire 1329 sentence [https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=KAwNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=GBS.PA657 reprinted in the original Latin].&lt;ref&gt;HC Lea, A History of the Inquisition, Vol III (1922) p. 455,657 &lt;/ref&gt; The 1329 sentence refers to...''multas et diversas daemonum conjurationes et invocationes''... and frequently uses the same Latin synonym for witch -- ''sortilegia'' -- found on the title page of [[Nicolas Rémy]]'s [https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=GIYEomQYnxsC&amp;pg=GBS.PP5 work from 1595] where it is claimed that 900 persons were executed for ''sortilegii crimen''. Hansen seems to have further taken the time to verify Lea's transcription of the 1329 sentence in the archives at Paris: ''befinden sich in der Pariser Nationatalbibliothek Msc. Doat col. 27 p. 177, vol. 28 p. 161.''&lt;ref&gt;''Quellen'' (1901) p. 449&lt;/ref&gt;  

In this same Paris archive, Hansen verified, via a separate trial, that the inquisitor named by Lamothe-Langon was operating in Carcassonne in 1276 via a separate trial.&lt;ref&gt;Zauberwahn (1900) p. 309 n.1 &lt;/ref&gt; Operating within Cohn's theory, such corroboration is unhelpful because Lamothe-Langon could have lifted the name from "a standard list of the inquisitors for Toulouse."&lt;ref&gt;Cohn (1975) p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Kieckhefer claims his skepticism is based in "anachronisms in the reports," Cohn seems to suggest the opposite: appearances of authenticity in Lamothe-Langon's accounts could be indicators of copying details from proper sources.


=== Old Partisan Battle: Soldan vs Grimm ===
It is not clear that withdrawing the Lamothe-Langon records in question would have a significant impact on Hansen's lengthy works from 1900-1901 or his broader thesis.  Institutional partisans or those historians of witchcraft who share an affinity with the bottom-up view of [[Jakob Grimm]], and oppose the top-down view of [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Gottlieb_Soldan W.G.Soldan] might have reason to highlight any potential embarrassment to Hansen due to his dogged focus on the culpability at the top-- the "kirche und staat" (church and state)-- and his selection and compilation of the surviving written record on the subject which almost exclusively comes from those sources.

'''Joy Haizelden''' (born 1 December 1998) is a [[2 point player|2.5 point]] British [[wheelchair basketball]] player who was the youngest player to represent Great Britain at the [[2014 Women's World Wheelchair Basketball Championship]] in [[Toronto]].

==Biography==
Joy Haizelden was born on 1 December 1998.&lt;ref name="gwba"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gbwba.org.uk/gbwba/index.cfm/gb-teams/gb-players/gb-women/joy-haizelden/ |title=Joy Haizelton |publisher=[[British Wheelchair Basketball]] |accessdate=5 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Joy and her older sister Miriam, both of whom have [[spina bifida]], were abandoned outside an orphanage in their native China. They were adopted by an English couple, Jim and Margaret Haizelden, who took them to live in  [[Southampton]], in [[Hampshire]], in 2005.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"/&gt; She was a student at The Kings School.&lt;ref name="gwba" /&gt; They could not participate in [[physical education]], so Jim went looking for ways to keep them fit and active. A friend invited him to bring them to his [[wheelchair basketball]] club.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"&gt;{{cite news |title=Teenagers abandoned outside a Chinese orphanage when they were babies now set to be wheelchair basketball stars after being adopted by British couple |newspaper= [[Daily Mail]] |first=Olivia |last=Foster |date= 6 March 2015 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2982519/Teenagers-abandoned-outside-Chinese-orphanage-babies-set-wheelchair-basketball-stars-adopted-British-couple.html |accessdate=5 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haizelden is classified as a [[2 point player|2.5 point player]]. She made her international debut in the Standard Life Head to Head series against the Netherlands in 2013.

The '''King asleep in mountain''' (D 1960.2 in Stith Thompson's [[Motif (folkloristics)|motif index system]]){{sfnp|Ó hÓgáin|1991|p=197}} is a prominent [[folklore]] motif found in many [[Folklore|folktales]] and [[legend]]s. Thompson also termed it as the '''Kyffhäuser''' type.{{r|thompson}} Some other designations are: '''king in the mountain''', '''king under the mountain''', or '''sleeping hero'''.

Examples include the legends of [[Frederic Barbarossa]] at [[Kyffhäuser]], [[Prince Marko|Kraljević Marko]], [[Ogier the Dane]], [[King Arthur]], [[Charlemagne]], and [[King Matjaž]].{{sfnp|Ó hÓgáin|2000|p=92}}{{r|henken}}

The motifs A 571 "Culture hero asleep in mountain", and E 502, "The Sleeping Army" are similar and can occur in the same tale.{{sfnp|Ó hÓgáin|1991|p=197}} A related motif is the "Seven Sleepers" (D 1960.1,{{r|thompson}} also known as the "[[Rip Van Winkle]]" motif), whose type tale is the [[Seven Sleepers]] of [[Ephesus]] ([[Aarne-Thompson classification system|AT tale type]] 766).

== General features ==
[[File:Barbarossa01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Frederick sends out the boy to see whether the ravens still fly.]]

King in the mountain stories involve legendary [[hero]]es, often accompanied by armed retainers, sleeping in remote dwellings, including caves on high mountaintops, remote islands, or supernatural worlds. The hero is frequently a historical figure of some [[military]] consequence in the history of the nation where the [[mountain]] is located.

The stories gathered by the [[Brothers Grimm]] concerning [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] and [[Charlemagne]] are typical of the stories told, and have been influential on many variants and subsequent adaptations. The presence of the hero is unsuspected, until some [[herder|herdsman]] wanders into the cave, typically looking for a lost animal, and sees the hero. The stories almost always mention the detail that the hero has grown a long beard, indicative of the long time he has slept beneath the mountain.

In the Brothers Grimm version, the hero speaks with the herdsman. Their conversation typically involves the hero asking, "Do the [[eagle]]s (or [[raven]]s) still circle the mountaintop?" The herdsman, or a mysterious voice, replies, "Yes, they still circle the mountaintop." "Then begone! My time has not yet come."

The herdsman in this story was then [[supernatural]]ly harmed by the experience: he ages rapidly, he emerges with his [[white hair|hair turned white]], and often he dies after repeating the tale. The story goes on to say that the king sleeps in the mountain, awaiting a summons to arise with his knights and defend the nation in a time of deadly peril. The [[omen]] that presages his rising will be the [[extinction]] of the [[bird]]s that trigger his awakening.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]], ''Deutsche Sagen'' (1816/1818), no. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/grimm/sagen/g028.htm ''Kaiser Karl im Untersberg''] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
A number of [[monarch|kings]], rulers, [[fictional character]]s and religious figures have become attached to this story. They include the following:

=== Religions ===
==== Christianity ====
* St. [[John the Evangelist]] - according to the [[Golden Legend]], he is only sleeping in his grave at [[Ephesus]] until the coming of the [[Antichrist]], when he would be needed as a witness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isidore of Seville]] – De ortu et obitu patrum (5th century)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacobus de Voragine]] – The Golden Legend&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|At a first reading &amp; text search, I cannot find such a legend at http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/goldenlegend/goldenlegend-volume4.asp - pls. more accurate source!|date=August 2016}}

==== Islam ====
* [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]] ([[Islamic mysticism]], especially [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]])

=== Asia (w/o Middle East) ===
==== Japan ====
* [[Kūkai]], founder of [[Shingon Buddhism]]. He is said to be in deep meditation in a temple on [[Mount Kōya]], [[Wakayama Prefecture]], awaiting the coming of [[Maitreya]], the next [[Buddhahood|Buddha]].

==== Philippines ====
* [[Bernardo Carpio]], the "King of the [[Tagalog people|Tagalogs]]", is said to be trapped in the mountains of [[Rodriguez, Rizal]], east of [[Metro Manila]] on [[Luzon]]. Legend has it that Carpio, a man of superhuman strength, causes earthquakes as he struggles to break free of his chains.

=== Europe ===
==== Armenia ====
* Mher&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hums.canterbury.ac.nz/clas/ejms/out_of_print/JMSv1n2/JMSv1n2Boyle.pdf Mher in the Carved Rock], J. A. Boyle, at the Library of the University of Canterbury, [[Christchurch]], New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Baltic states ====
* A popular motif in [[Latvia]]n legends involves a castle sinking into ground leaving a hill behind it. Years later somebody finds a way into the hill and somehow guesses the name of the castle causing it to rise again and its ruler and his people to return to the living.
* [[Vytautas the Great]] (Lithuania). It is believed he will rise from his grave when the worst danger threatens Lithuania in order to defend the motherland at the last battle.

==== Britain and Ireland ====
* [[King Arthur]] ([[Great Britain]] and [[Brittany]]), perhaps the most famous of the "king under the mountain" examples. According to the legend, Arthur was taken away to [[Avalon]] to sleep until he was needed by the people of Britain. Several legends talk of a herdsman who stumbles across a cave on mainland Britain, wherein he finds Arthur sleeping, often with his knights and [[Excalibur]] by his side. In a variation on this, sometimes the exploring herdsman finds instead just Arthur's knights, or [[Sir Lancelot]], [[Guinevere]] and the knights sleeping in wait on the return of the "Once and Future King".
* [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] of the [[Arthurian Cycle|Arthurian legend]], who is imprisoned in an oak tree by [[Nimue]].
* [[Thomas the Rhymer]] is found under a hill with a retinue of knights in a tale from [[Anglo-Scottish border]]. Likewise, [[Harry Hotspur]] was said to have been hunting in the [[Cheviots]] when he and his hounds got holed-up in the Hen Hole (or ''"Hell-hole"'') awaiting the sound of a hunting horn to awaken them from their slumber. Another [[Anglo-Scottish border|border]] variant concerns a party of huntsmen who chase a [[Roe Deer|roebuck]] into the Cheviots when they heard the sweetest music playing from the Henhole, however when they entered they became lost and are trapped to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Tegner; ''Ghosts of The North Country'', 1991 Butler Publishing, {{ISBN|0-946928-40-1}}. p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

* An unnamed [[giant (mythology)|giant]] is supposed to sleep in [[Plynlimon]].

===== Ireland =====
* [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] is said to sleep in a cave/mountain surrounded by the Fianna (he is differentiated from them because of his large stature). It is told that the day will come when the Dord Fiann is sounded three times and Fionn and the [[Fianna]] will rise up again, as strong and well as they ever were. In other accounts he will return to glory as a great hero of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[[Augusta, Lady Gregory]] – Gods and Fighting Men (1904)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond|Gearóid Iarla]], Earl of Desmond, who dozes under Lough Gur with his silver-shod horse{{sfnp|Ó hÓgáin|2000|p=92}}

* [[Sir Francis Drake]]. It is stated that when England is in deadly peril, if [[Drake's Drum]] is beaten, then Sir Francis Drake will arise to defend England from the sea. According to the legend, it can be heard to beat at times when England is at war or significant national events take place.

== Sleeping anti-hero and villain ==
Sometimes this type of story or archetype is also attached to not-so-heroic figures, who are either simple anti-heroes or fully villains, whose return would mean the end of the world, or whose sleep represents something positive. This kind of archetype is known as the "Chained Satan" archetype.&lt;ref name="Mher in the Carved Rock"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hums.canterbury.ac.nz/clas/ejms/out_of_print/JMSv1n2/JMSv1n2Boyle.pdf|title=School of Humanities and Creative Arts - University of Canterbury|website=The University of Canterbury|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among examples of this are:
* The [[Sleeping Giant (Connecticut)|Sleeping Giant]] mountain in [[Connecticut]], United States was said by the local [[Quinnipiac]] Indians to be the demon Hobbomock, sealed by the Great Spirit. One day he would supposedly awaken and destroy the world.

'''Lincoln Davenport Chafee''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|eɪ|f|iː}}; born March 26, 1953) is an American politician from the state of [[Rhode Island]]. He was mayor of [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]] from 1993 to 1999, a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from 1999 to 2007, and the 74th [[Governor of Rhode Island]] from 2011 to 2015. He has been a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] since 2013, having previously been a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] member until 2007 and an independent in the interim.

The son of Republican politician [[John Chafee]], who was the 66th Governor of Rhode Island, the [[United States Secretary of the Navy]], and a U.S. Senator from Rhode Island, Lincoln Chafee's first elected office was as a member of the Warwick City Council in 1985. After John Chafee died in 1999 while serving in the United States Senate, Rhode Island Governor [[Lincoln Almond]] appointed Lincoln Chafee to fill his father's seat in the U.S. Senate to which he was [[United States Senate election in Rhode Island, 2000|elected to a full term in 2000]] as candidate of the Republican Party.

Chafee's tenure in the United States Senate was characterized by his support for fiscal and social policies that often opposed those promoted by the Republican Party. He was defeated in his [[United States Senate election in Rhode Island, 2006|2006 reelection bid]] by Democrat [[Sheldon Whitehouse]]. Chafee subsequently shifted his affiliation towards the Democratic Party by first endorsing [[Barack Obama]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], running as an [[Independent politician|independent]] for Governor of Rhode Island in [[Rhode Island gubernatorial election, 2010|2010]], serving as the co-chair of Obama's [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012|2012 re-election campaign]], and then finally officially switching his registration to the Democratic Party in May 2013. In 2015, he sought nomination to be the Democratic Party candidate in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], but withdrew prior to the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|primaries]].

==Early life, education, and career==

Lincoln Davenport Chafee was born on March 26, 1953 in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], the son of Virginia (née Coates) and [[John Chafee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/senators/chafee.htm |title=Chafee family tree |accessdate=July 3, 2008 |work=Rootsweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chafee's great-great-grandfather [[Henry Lippitt]] was [[Governor of Rhode Island]]. Among his great-great-uncles are Rhode Island Governor [[Charles Warren Lippitt]] and [[United States Senator]] [[Henry Frederick Lippitt]]. His great-uncle [[Zechariah Chafee]] was a [[Harvard Law School|Harvard law]] professor and a notable [[Civil liberties|civil libertarian]]. The Chafee family was among the earliest settlers of [[Hingham, Massachusetts]], before moving south to Rhode Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cFc5AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=%22daniel+cushing%22+hingham+clerk&amp;lr=&amp;ei=DdhJSYXxE5OeMqGA9fcM |title=The Chaffee Genealogy, William Henry Chaffee, 1635–1909, The Grafton Press, New York, 1909 |publisher=Google Books |date=September 2, 2000 |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his mother's side, his great-grandfather [[George de Forest Brush]] was a prolific painter in the [[American Renaissance]], and his great-aunt was painter and theater designer [[Nancy Douglas Bowditch]].

He attended [[Public school (government funded)#United States|public schools]] in [[Warwick, Rhode Island]], [[Providence Country Day School]], and later, [[Phillips Academy]]. At [[Brown University]], Chafee captained the [[wrestling]] team, and in 1975 earned a [[B.A.]] in [[classics]]. He then attended [[Montana State University]]'s non-degree Farrier School (a sixteen-week [[horseshoe]]ing program) in [[Bozeman]]. For the next seven years, he worked as a [[farrier]] at [[Harness racing|harness racetracks]] in the United States and Canada. One of the horses he shod, Overburden, set the track record at [[Northlands Park]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/politics/90421/missing-linc|title=Missing Linc|author=Michael Crowley|work=The New Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In describing how his time as a farrier affected him, Chafee stated that "when you're around horses, you tend to be a quieter person."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Did Lincoln Chafee Even Bother to Run?|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/lincoln-chafee-2016/412141/|website = The Atlantic|publisher = The Atlantic|accessdate = October 26, 2015|language = en|last = Ball|first = Molly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local politics (1985–1999)==

Chafee entered politics in 1985, when he was elected over eight other candidates to become delegate to the Rhode Island Constitutional Convention. A year later he was elected to the Warwick City Council, defeating an incumbent, and re-elected in 1988. He ran for Warwick Mayor in 1990, losing by 5 percent in a three-way race.

In 1992, he was elected Warwick's first Republican mayor in 32 years, and was re-elected in 1994, 1996, and 1998, when he won by 17% and carried all nine wards.

Chafee was praised for his fair-minded and sensible approach to government, including his ability to work with seven Democrats (of nine seats) on the Warwick City Council. He conservatively managed the City's finances, strengthening the city's bond rating and paying down the outstanding pension liability.

He worked effectively and cooperatively with the municipal unions, especially in settling a difficult and prolonged teacher labor dispute that he inherited from the previous administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Emery Jr.|first1=C. Eugene|title=Caprio says Chafee gave Warwick teachers a 19-percent raise|url=http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/14/frank-caprio/caprio-says-chafee-gave-warwick-teachers-19-percen/|website=Politifact Rhode Island|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mayor, Chafee made conservation, environmental protection and wise growth a priority. He purchased 130 acres of open space, planted hundreds of street trees, and created new historic districts and a new economic development "intermodal" district at the state airport. His municipal composting and recycling initiatives dramatically decreased landfill waste. His "Greenwich Bay Initiative", which extended sewer service to the most environmentally-sensitive areas of the city, earned Warwick recognition by EPA as one of the best local watershed programs in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhode Island|url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/success319/RI.cfm|website=US EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States Senate (1999–2007)==

===Elections===

====2000====
{{Main|United States Senate election in Rhode Island, 2000}}

After his father announced he would not seek re-election in 2000, Lincoln Chafee announced he would run for the seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/13/AR2006041301917.html |work=The Washington Post |title=A Republican on the Edge |first=Shailagh |last=Murray |date=April 14, 2006 |accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When John Chafee died suddenly in October 1999, Governor [[Lincoln Almond]] appointed the younger Chafee to serve out the term.

In the general election he faced the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee, then-[[U.S. Representative]] [[Robert Weygand]]. Chafee won the election 57%–41%.

====2006====
{{Main|United States Senate election in Rhode Island, 2006}}

In September 2005, [[Steve Laffey]], the mayor of [[Cranston, Rhode Island|Cranston]], Rhode Island, announced his intention to run against Chafee in the Republican [[primary election]]. Among other stances differing from those of Chafee, Mayor Laffey opposed abortion and [[stem cell research]]. Laffey was supported by notable conservative groups including the [[Club for Growth]] and several anti-abortion groups. Chafee went on to defeat Laffey in the primary on September 12 by a margin of 53%–47%. The turnout for the Republican primary was the largest in Rhode Island history. In his victory speech, Chafee credited independent voters and disaffiliated Democrats for his victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/extra/election/content/projo_20060913_newgop.37563ed.html |title=Extra: Election |work=The Providence Journal |date=September 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Chafee's high approval ratings statewide, the state had tended to lean heavily toward socially liberal or moderate candidates for many decades. As a result, Democrat [[Sheldon Whitehouse]] succeeded by attacking the instances in which Chafee supported his party's conservative congressional leadership (whose personalities and policies were very unpopular statewide).

Chafee lost to Whitehouse in the general election, 54%–46%. In response to a question at a news conference on November 9, 2006, Chafee stated he was unsure whether he would remain in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] after serving out the remainder of his term. According to Michelle R. Smith of the [[Associated Press]], when asked whether he felt that his loss may have helped the country by switching control of power in Congress (toward the Democrats and away from Republicans), he replied: "To be honest, yes."&lt;ref name="Staying with GOP"&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Michelle|title=Chafee unsure of staying with GOP after losing election|url=http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=102x2606946|accessdate=May 28, 2012|newspaper=Associated Press|date=November 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===
Descended from a long line of moderate, center-right New England Republicans, Chafee's stances became increasingly liberal, more so than his father's positions had been.  The now dominant [[Conservatism|conservatives]] referred to him as a "[[Republican In Name Only]]", or RINO. Most notable among these was ''[[Human Events]]'' magazine, which named Chafee "the No. 1 RINO in the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanevents.com/sarticle.php?id=11129 |title=Human Events |work=Human Events |date=December 27, 2005 |accessdate=November 3, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the ''[[National Journal]]'' rated Chafee as the most liberal Republican in the Senate, and placed him to the left of two Democrats, [[Nebraska]]'s [[Ben Nelson]] and [[Louisiana]]'s [[Mary Landrieu]] (the only Republican ranked to the left of the latter senator).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080528042316/http://www.nationaljournal.com/voteratings/pdf/Centrists.pdf The Centrists] National Journal. February 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[GovTrack]] also ranked Senator Chafee as the most liberal Republican member in 2006; according to GovTrack's analysis, Chafee was to the left of his Republican colleagues as well as to the left of fourteen Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/lincoln_chafee/300020|title=Lincoln Chafee, former Senator for Rhode Island - GovTrack.us|website=GovTrack.us|language=en|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known for often disagreeing with the Republican Party leadership, Chafee says he did not cast his ballot for [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 election]], instead choosing to [[Write-in candidate|write in]] former president [[George H. W. Bush]] as a nod to the Republican Party of his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramcigar.com/media/paper366/news/2004/10/05/News/Chafee.Speaks.With.Students.About.Election-741669.shtml |title=The Good 5 Cent Cigar |publisher=Ramcigar.com |accessdate=November 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123040220/http://www.ramcigar.com/media/paper366/news/2004/10/05/News/Chafee.Speaks.With.Students.About.Election-741669.shtml |archivedate=November 23, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chafee frequently criticized the younger Bush's record on the [[natural environment|environment]], and expressed concern about the 2004 Republican [[Party platform|platform]] and overall philosophical direction of the party. He described the younger Bush's presidency as "an agenda of energizing the [[Right-wing politics|far-right-wing]] [[Base (politics)|base]], which is divisive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/ussenate/2004-11-03-ri-chaffee_x.htm# |work=USA Today |title=Sen. Chafee considers leaving GOP |date=November 3, 2004 |accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, he rejected Democratic overtures to leave the Republican Party after appeals to him from other Republican [[United States Senate|senators]] to remain in their caucus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/11/09/republicans.chafee.ap/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041121035252/http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/11/09/republicans.chafee.ap/|archivedate=November 21, 2004 |title=Sen. Lincoln Chafee won't leave GOP|publisher=CNN |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chafee considered challenging George W. Bush for re-nomination in the [[New Hampshire primary]] in 2004 on an anti- (Iraq and Afghanistan) war platform. In his autobiography, ''Against the Tide'' (2007), he states that "In the fall of 2003, part of me thought it was cowardly to oppose the president on so many issues and then not oppose him head-on as he sought renomination." However, he decided not to run after the capture of [[Saddam Hussein]] on December 13, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Chafee, ''Against the Tide'' (2007), p.119-120&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fiscal policy====
Chafee opposes eliminating the federal [[Estate tax in the United States|estate tax]]. Chafee also voted against both the 2001 and 2003 congressional budget bills that cut and/or rebated individuals' federal income taxes. He asserted that tax cuts reduce revenue to the federal government, thereby worsening the federal budget deficit and increasing the amount of money it has to borrow in order to operate. In 2004, Chafee broke with his party again to oppose the acceleration of the Bush tax cuts. "Four Senate moderates -- [[John McCain]] of Arizona, [[Olympia Snowe|Olympia J. Snowe]] and [[Susan Collins]], both of Maine, and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island -- had insisted on attaching a provision that would have applied pay-as-you-go-rules for the next five years."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/21/us/mutiny-by-4-republicans-over-bush-s-tax-cutting-forces-delay-on-the-budget-vote.html|title=Mutiny by 4 Republicans Over Bush's Tax Cutting Forces Delay on the Budget Vote|last=Andrews|first=Edmund L.|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 17, 2005, he was the only Republican to vote in favor of reinstating the top [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax]] rate of 39.6% (which last existed under President [[Bill Clinton]] in the 1990s) on the highest-income taxpayers.

Chafee favors increased federal funding for health care, and supports an increase in the federal [[minimum wage]]. In 2003, Chafee voted against the [[Medicare Part D]] [[prescription drug]] expansion. However, Chafee also cast a crucial procedural vote against a Democratic attempt to kill that bill, which failed by only two votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/news/mcharlesbakst/projo_20031202_mcbcol02.116926.html |title=Providence &amp;#124; Local News &amp;#124; M. Charles Bakst |publisher=Projo.com |date=December 2, 2003 |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chafee also co-sponsored the [[Class Action Fairness Act of 2005]], which expanded federal jurisdiction over class-action lawsuits, and voted against a wholesale ban on gifts from employees of lobbying companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/SenateVote/Party_2006-080.htm |title=Senate Votes on 2006-080 |publisher=Ontheissues.org |date=March 29, 2006 |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Chafee's positions considered to be within the mainstream of the current Republican Party include his support of [[free trade]] agreements (e.g., [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and [[Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Lincoln_Chafee.htm |title=Lincoln Chafee for Senate: Issues2000.org |publisher=Ontheissues.org |date=February 12, 2000 |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act|Bankruptcy Reform]] and the [[USA Patriot Act]]. The [[Cato Institute]]'s Center for Trade Policy Studies identified Chafee as a "free trader" during his U.S. Senate tenure, indicating a pro-[[free trade]], pro-[[market economy|market]], and anti-[[subsidy|subsidies]] voting record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|url=http://www.cato.org/research/trade-immigration/congress?senator=22|title=Free Trade, Free Markets: Rating the Congress|accessdate=September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As U.S. Senator from Rhode Island, Chafee received grades of D in 2000, C- in 2001, C in 2002, C- in 2003 and 2004, and D in 2005 and 2006 from the [[National Taxpayers Union]], a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Taxpayer groups|taxpayers advocacy organization]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.ntu.org/state/legislator/lincoln-chafee|title=National Taxpayers Union - Lincoln Chafee|publisher=[[National Taxpayers Union]]|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environment====

Chafee was one of the few Republicans to vote against allowing drilling in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and was a member of the Republicans for Environmental Protection. He has been endorsed throughout his career by the Sierra Club and the League of Conservative Voters as a strong leader for environmental causes, despite criticisms from other progressive activist groups decrying the endorsement of a (then) Republican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Little|first1=Amanda|title=Green groups endorse Republican Lincoln Chafee; activists cry foul|url=http://grist.org/article/little6/|website=Grist.org|publisher=Grist.org|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social policy====
Chafee authored the "Brownfields" Act of 2002, one of the most significant pieces of legislation in recent years. This act has enabled the clean up and redevelopment of thousands of abandoned urban buildings throughout the United States.

Chafee was a member of the [[Republican Majority for Choice]] and [[Republicans for Choice]]. Chafee was also a member of the [[Republican Main Street Partnership]]

Chafee is [[pro-choice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ontheissues.org/Social/Lincoln_Chafee_Abortion.htm Lincoln Chafee on Abortion] OnTheIssues.org&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Chafee was one of the three Republican Senators to oppose the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]]. His 2006 senatorial re-election bid was endorsed by [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]]. He also supported federal funding for [[embryonic stem cell]] research.

In 2004, Chaffee was one of six Republicans to vote against the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], an amendment intended to ban gay marriage; in 2006, he voted against banning gay marriage a second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/07/14/samesex.marriage/index.html|title=CNN.com - Same-sex marriage Senate battle over, war is not - Jul 15, 2004|website=www.cnn.com|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/13181735/ns/politics/t/gay-marriage-ban-defeated-senate-vote/#.WwzI37TBQUU|title=Gay marriage ban defeated in Senate vote|date=2006-06-07|work=msnbc.com|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, Chafee was the only sitting or former Republican senator to support the legalization of [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]], until [[Rob Portman]] of [[Ohio]] endorsed it in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/03/16/portmans-shift-mirrors-many-others.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

He supports [[affirmative action]] and [[gun politics|gun control]], and was one of only two Republicans to vote against the [[Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act]] (which prevents [[firearms]] manufacturers and [[Federal Firearms License|dealers]] from being held liable for crimes committed with their products). On June 27, 2006, Chafee was one of only three Republicans to vote against the proposed [[Flag Desecration Amendment]].

Chafee opposes the [[death penalty]], and has consistently voted against limiting death penalty appeals in federal cases. He has also favored including [[Capital punishment debate#Discrimination|racial statistics]] in death penalty appeals, and making [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA analysis]] a prerequisite for any federal-level, criminal executions.

On May 23, 2005, Chafee was one of [[Gang of 14|14 bipartisan senators]] to forge a compromise on the Democrats' use of the judicial [[filibuster]], forestalling the Republican leadership's implementation of the so-called "[[nuclear option]]". Under the agreement, the Democrats would retain the power to filibuster a Bush II judicial nominee only in an "extraordinary circumstance", and three of the most conservative Bush [[appellate court]] nominees ([[Janice Rogers Brown]], [[Priscilla Owen]] and [[William H. Pryor, Jr.|William Pryor]]) would receive a vote by the full Senate. Chafee was the only Republican to oppose George W. Bush's nomination of [[Samuel Alito]] to the [[United States Supreme Court]]. However, he voted to end debate on the nomination, helping to end any chance of a Democratic filibuster of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/rhode_island/articles/2006/01/30/chafee_says_he_will_vote_against_alito/ |title=Chafee says he will vote against Alito |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208150415/http://www.boston.com/news/local/rhode_island/articles/2006/01/30/chafee_says_he_will_vote_against_alito/ |archivedate=February 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chafee did not announce his opposition to the nomination until a majority of Senators had already publicly said they would support Alito.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,183204,00.html |publisher=Fox News |title=Alito Filibuster Fails, Confirmation Vote Expected Tuesday |date=January 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foreign policy====
Chafee was the only Republican in the Senate to vote against authorization of [[Iraq Resolution|the use of force in Iraq]]. On June 22, 2006, he was the only Republican to vote for the Levin amendment calling for a nonbinding timetable for a withdrawal of [[US troops]] from [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name="Levin Senate Vote"&gt;{{cite web|title=Roll Call|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00182|publisher=Senate|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chafee voted against the [[Kerry-Feingold Amendment|Kerry-Feingold amendment]] calling for a binding timetable.

Chafee is now involved in [[J Street]], a liberal Jewish group that calls for Israel to withdraw from all occupied territories and advocates for a "two state" solution to the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]].

In November 2006, immediately following the midterm elections, Chafee joined key Democrats in opposing President Bush's renomination of [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]] as [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]]. On December 4, 2006, the White House announced that Bolton would no longer seek the appointment, and would resign within a matter of weeks.

==Political hiatus (2007–2009)==
[[File:RI governor Lincoln Chafee in 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Lincoln Chafee delivers a lecture during his time at Brown University in 2007]]
In December 2006, Chafee announced he was accepting a fellowship to serve as a "distinguished visiting fellow" at Brown University's Thomas J. Watson Jr. Institute for International Studies. The university had Chafee lead a student group studying U.S. foreign policy.&lt;ref name="PROJO"&gt;[http://www.projo.com/news/content/projo-20061215-chafeejob.1219261f.html Chafee takes fellowship at Brown].

In September 2007, Chafee officially left the Republican Party, changing his affiliation to Independent. He said that he did so because of the Republican Party's drifting away from its core values, such as its abandoning fiscal conservatism.  Citing the party's new tendency to pass tax cuts without spending cuts to balance the loss of revenue, he noted how the party was destroying social programs aimed to help middle-class and lower-income Americans, particularly [[Pell Grant]]s and [[Head Start Program|Head Start]].&lt;ref name="AP-Sept07"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/16/AR2007091601815.html Former RI Sen.

In September 2008, Chafee received media attention for describing [[Sarah Palin]], then-[[Governor of Alaska]] and the Republican vice-presidential nominee in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], as a "cocky wacko."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26661483/ns/politics-decision_08/t/former-gop-senator-calls-palin-cocky-wacko/#.TzimFV6KOJM|title=Former GOP senator calls Palin a 'cocky wacko'|date=September 11, 2008 |publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governor of Rhode Island (2011–2015)==

===2010 election===
{{main|Rhode Island gubernatorial election, 2010}}
On January 4, 2010 Chafee formally declared his intention to run for Governor of Rhode Island in 2010 as an independent,

as the incumbent Governor [[Donald Carcieri]] (a Republican re-elected the same day Chafee lost his Senate re-election bid) was [[term-limited]] at the time. On October 31, 2010, electoral analysis site [[FiveThirtyEight.com]] gave Chafee a 63.8% chance of victory, compared to Democratic opponent [[Frank T. Caprio]]'s 26.2% and Republican opponent [[John Robitaille]]'s 10.0%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/forecasts/governor/rhode-island|title=Rhode Island Governor Forecast|publisher=Elections.nytimes.com|accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, other sites, such as the [[Cook Political Report]], classified the race as a "toss-up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cookpolitical.com/governors|title=Cook Political Report – Governors|publisher=Cookpolitical.com|accessdate=November 3, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026191254/http://cookpolitical.com/governors|archivedate=October 26, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chafee's approval rating at the time of his 2006 defeat was between 51% and 63%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mydd.com/story/2007/7/27/11938/2973 |title=Interviewwith Tom Allen |publisher=MyDD |accessdate=November 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303121438/http://www.mydd.com/story/2007/7/27/11938/2973 |archivedate=March 3, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollTrack.aspx?g=417c7a9d-d8ec-4083-8e80-ca577e486925&amp;x=0,0|title=RI Jr Sen Approval|publisher=SurveyUSA|accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 2010, New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] (who had also switched from Republican to Independent in recent years) traveled to Rhode Island. Bloomberg praised Chafee's "experience and integrity", saying that Chafee would put Rhode Islanders' interests "ahead of party interests", and that Chafee would "produce results -— because that's exactly what he did as a mayor and as senator."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsblog.projo.com/2010/09/ny-mayor-bloomberg-visits-prov.html |title=Update: NY Mayor Bloomberg visits RI, endorses Chafee/ Video – Projo 7 to 7 News Blog &amp;#124; Rhode Island news &amp;#124; The Providence Journal |publisher=Newsblog.projo.com |accessdate=November 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107091035/http://newsblog.projo.com/2010/09/ny-mayor-bloomberg-visits-prov.html |archivedate=January 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that President Obama's lack of endorsement of any of the candidates indicated tacit support of Chafee over Democrat Caprio.&lt;ref name="New York Times profile"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lincoln Chafee|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/c/lincoln_chafee/index.html|accessdate=May 8, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 3, 2010|first=Jess|last=Bidgood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chafee easily won the endorsements of all major public school teachers unions, including the Rhode Island affiliates of the [[National Education Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rifuture.org/the-neari-endorses-linc-chafee-.html|title=The NEARI Endorses Lincoln Chafee|publisher=Rifuture.org|date=August 25, 2010|accessdate=November 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718053307/http://rifuture.org/the-neari-endorses-linc-chafee-.html|archive-date=July 18, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[American Federation of Teachers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riteachers4chafee.com |title=RIFT for Chafee |publisher=Riteachers4chafee.com |accessdate=November 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826061908/http://riteachers4chafee.com/ |archivedate=August 26, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in his 2010 gubernatorial campaign.

On November 2, 2010, Chafee won the gubernatorial race, winning with a 36% plurality in the seven-candidate race.

===Switch to the Democratic Party===
In August 2012, he announced plans to attend the [[Democratic National Convention]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], to show support for President [[Barack Obama]]'s re-election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.providencejournal.com/politics/2012/08/independent-ri-gov-chafee-to-attend-democratic-convention.html|title=News - providencejournal.com - Providence, RI|work=providencejournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After constant speculation during his term, Chafee officially joined the Democratic Party on May 30, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = McGowan | first = Dan | last2 = White | first2 = Tim | title = Chafee: Obama 'big reason' for becoming a Dem | publisher = [[WPRI-TV]] | date = 30 May 2013 | url = http://wpri.com/dpp/news/local_news/mcgowan/warwick-ri-gov-lincoln-chafee-officially-becomes-democrat | access-date = 2017-10-08 | deadurl = bot: unknown | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130609054220/http://wpri.com/dpp/news/local_news/mcgowan/warwick-ri-gov-lincoln-chafee-officially-becomes-democrat | archivedate = June 9, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously indicated that he might run for re-election as an Independent or a Democrat.&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/rhode-island/2012/12/14/gov-chafee-open-running-for-term-dem/Q5g9thzMcZzorBrTmyOYuM/story.html|title=RI Gov.

===Recession===
Chafee came to office in the depths of the worst recession in decades. Unemployment peaked at 11.4% in the first months of his tenure. Over his four budgets, July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2015, the rate dropped to 5.9%, second best in the country.

Chafee also inherited a crisis with impending bankruptcies of a number of municipalities including Providence, East Providence, Pawtucket, West Warwick and Woonsocket.

As a former mayor, Chafee was a strong advocate for the state's city and towns. He increased state aid and intervened to protect these distressed communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donnis|first1=Ian|title=Chafee Unveils Plan for State's Distressed Communities; Legislative Outlook Uncertain|url=https://wrnipoliticsblog.wordpress.com/2012/03/15/chafee-unveils-plan-for-states-distressed-communities-legislative-outlook-uncertain/|accessdate=October 28, 2015|publisher=RINPR|date=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One city, Central Falls, did declare a bankruptcy. Chafee appointed a special master to run the city on an interim basis, negotiate concessions with labor and retirees, and pass a budget with tax increases. Central Falls emerged from bankruptcy the following year.

===Fiscal issues===
Chafee had campaigned on a platform that included lowering the state sales tax by creating a 1% tax on 59 tax exempt commodities and services. This would have squarely addressed the Rhode Island legislature annual budget deficit.

A 2012 poll showed that some of Chafee's proposed tax increases, intended to move the state from budget deficit to surplus status, had received negative feedback from Rhode Island residents.  As Governor of Rhode Island, Chafee received grades of D in 2012&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Chris|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/GRC2012.pdf|title=Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors 2012|date=October 9, 2012|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Chris|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/fiscal-policy-report-card-americas-governors-2012|title=Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors: 2012|date=October 9, 2012|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and B in 2014&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaeding|first1=Nicole|last2=Edwards|first2=Chris|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/fprc-on-americas-governors_1.pdf|title=Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors 2014|date=October 2, 2014|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaeding|first1=Nicole|last2=Edwards|first2=Chris|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/fiscal-policy-report-card-americas-governors-2014|title=Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors 2014|date=October 2, 2014|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Cato Institute]], a [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors.

In two of his four budgets, there were no tax increases. At the same time, he restored 20% to local education and higher education, cut by his predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nagle|first1=Kate|title=Chafee's Budget: Education|url=http://www.golocalprov.com/news/chafees-budget-education/|accessdate=October 24, 2015|publisher=GoLocalProv|date=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social issues===
In May 2012, Chafee refused on principle to release a prisoner charged with murder to federal custody because Rhode Island hadn't had an execution since 1842 and the US Attorney refused to guarantee the prisoner, if convicted would receive a maximum life imprisonment without parole. Chafee said: "The State of Rhode Island must seek to protect both the strong [[states' rights]] issues at stake, and the legitimacy of its longstanding public policy against the death penalty."&lt;ref name="Accused Murder"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rivoli|first=Dan|title=Death Penalty Causes State-Fed Clash Over Accused Murderer In Rhode Island|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/340231/20120511/lincoln-chafee-rhode-island-death-penalty.htm|accessdate=May 28, 2012|newspaper=Business &amp; Law|date=May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chafee championed a bill that legalized [[same-sex marriage in Rhode Island]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/marriage-equality/2013/05/02/rhode-island-gov-signs-marriage-equality-bill|title=No. 10: Rhode Island Legalizes Same-Sex Marriage|publisher=Advocate|date=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; signing it into law on May 1, 2012.

Chafee has shown some willingness to deviate from strict "[[War on Drugs]]" policies, in favor of alternative approaches to America's drug-crime problem.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ethan Nadelmann|Nadelmann, Ethan]] (December 27, 2010) [http://www.thenation.com/article/157010/breaking-taboo Breaking the Taboo], ''[[The Nation]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
On "education reform" in general, Chafee does not believe the politically and publicly popular presumption that America's schools are failing, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This notion of all these failing schools, if this were true, how did America get to be at the status where we are in the world if it were that bad? So I don't buy into the trashing of our public school system. Somehow [[Brown University]], and [[University of Rhode Island]] and [[Bryant University]], [[Providence College]] are full of public school students that are doing very, very well and leading America in many fields. Yes, there's room for improvement, I don't deny that and I want to be part of the improvement. But the notion that our public school systems are in disarray and failing, I don't buy that.&lt;ref name="rifuture.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chafee opposes [[charter schools]], saying, "I am wary of charter schools undermining and cherry picking and skimming off the top of our public school system."&lt;ref name="rifuture.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rifuture.org/interview-lincoln-chafee-on-jobs-the-riedc-race-to-the-top-and-more.html|title=Lincoln Chafee on Jobs, the RIEDC, Race to the Top and More|publisher=Rifuture.org|date=September 24, 2010|accessdate=November 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128201916/http://rifuture.org/interview-lincoln-chafee-on-jobs-the-riedc-race-to-the-top-and-more.html|archive-date=November 28, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===38 Studios===
Chafee was the only public figure in Rhode Island to vigorously oppose an ill-fated deal in which the previous Governor committed an unsecured $75 million loan to a former baseball star, [[Curt Schilling]], to develop a new video game, ''[[Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning]]''. The first payments started two months before he took office in January 2011.

The game was released in February 2012 to moderate critical success, but failed commercially. 38 Studios ended up laying off their staff and filed for bankruptcy. According to Schilling, Chafee's public comments calling the game a "failure" caused a publisher to pull out of a $35 million deal that could have paid for a sequel. In response, Chafee said he would need to "verify" Schilling's claim, saying that he couldn't "just take it as a leap of faith." He added that it "isn't accurate" to blame the state for the company's collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Goldfarb, A. (2012, May 29). Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning 2 Nearly Happened - IGN. Retrieved November 28, 2016, from http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/05/29/kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning-2-nearly-happened&lt;/ref&gt;

As chair of the agency securing the loan, Chafee initiated a lawsuit to recover lost funds for Rhode Island taxpayers. To date, about $17 million has been recovered through settlements.

===Christmas tree controversy===
[[File:Christmas Tree at Rhode Island State House 2013.jpg|thumb|right|228x228px|The Rhode Island State House Christmas tree]]
In 2011, [[Fox News]] and local conservatives and pundits stirred up controversy over the Christmas tree at the Rhode Island State House. Governor Chafee called the towering fir, decorated with lights, tinsel and toys, a "holiday tree," because that had been the accepted practice of the two previous governors{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}, both Republicans. Chafee went on national TV with commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], calling Fox News'  "war on Christmas" coverage "angry."

===2014 election===

Chafee had previously indicated that he might run for re-election as an Independent or a Democrat.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; In the face of low approval ratings, polling showing him trailing in both the Democratic primary and the general election, and with weak fundraising, Chafee announced on September 4, 2013 that he would not run for re-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/09/04/why-lincoln-chafees-decision-not-to-run-for-reelection-is-more-good-news-for-democrats/|title=Why Lincoln Chafee's decision not to run for reelection is more good news for Democrats|date=September 4, 2013|accessdate=September 6, 2013|work=The Washington Post|first=Sean|last=Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=secondterm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/09/04/20327881-gov-chafee-wont-run-for-a-second-term?lite|title=Gov.

==2016 presidential campaign==
{{Main|Lincoln Chafee presidential campaign, 2016}}
On April 9, 2015, Chafee announced that he had formed an [[exploratory committee]] in preparation for a potential candidacy for [[President of the United States]] as a Democrat in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/09/politics/lincoln-chafee-2016-presidential-plans/ | title=Lincoln Chafee launches 2016 exploratory committee, goes after Clinton on Iraq | publisher=[[CNN]].com | date=April 9, 2015 | accessdate=May 20, 2015 | author=Merica, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formally declared candidacy on June 3, 2015 with the campaign focused on [[Lincoln Chafee presidential campaign, 2016|ten stated issues]] with "Prosperity Through Peace" being his slogan.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bloo_Linc"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Lincoln Chafee ~~Enters~~ Democratic Presidential Field | last = Brody | first = Ben | publisher = [[Bloomberg Politics]] | date = June 3, 2015 | accessdate = June 3, 2015 | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-06-03/lincoln-chafee-set-to-enter-democratic-presidential-field | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a widely panned debate performance, poor polling numbers, and paltry fundraising, Chafee announced on October 23, 2015 that he would be ending his campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Lincoln Chafee drops out of Democratic primary race |first1= Dan |last1= Merica |first2= Tom |last2= LoBianco |work= CNN |date= October 23, 2015 |url= http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/23/politics/lincoln-chafee-2016-election-dnc-meeting/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==

While serving in the U.S. Senate, Chafee was characterized as a "[[Centrism|moderate]]" or even "[[Rockefeller Republican|liberal Republican]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/06/03/411327420/5-things-you-should-know-about-lincoln-chafee|title=5 Things You Should Know About Lincoln Chafee|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-07-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-partisan ''[[National Journal]]'' in 2005 gave him a composite 59% liberal score and a 41% conservative score.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His record as a more liberal Republican Senator earned him criticism from conservatives; the conservative magazine, ''[[Human Events]]'', labeled him one of the top ten [[Republican In Name Only|RINO]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, or what they consider to be insufficiently conservative, in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://humanevents.com/2005/12/27/top-10-rinos-republicans-in-name-only/|title=Top 10 RINOs (Republicans in Name Only) {{!}} Human Events|work=Human Events|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[GovTrack]], Chafee was the most liberal Republican Senator in 2006 being placed by GovTrack's analysis to the left of every Republican and several Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/lincoln_chafee/300020|title=Lincoln Chafee, former Senator for Rhode Island - GovTrack.us|website=GovTrack.us|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, as governor of Rhode Island, he pursued a centrist agenda that alienated special interests on both the left and right, "from unions to the state's Roman Catholic bishop." He has called for moderation and deescalation in U.S. foreign policy, combined with pragmatic fiscal conservatism, and liberal social policies.

=== Domestic policy ===

==== Abortion ====
Chafee has generally been considered [[pro-choice]]. In the U.S. Senate, Chafee was one of three Republicans to vote against the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swers|first1=Michelle|title=Women in the Club: Gender and Policy Making in the Senate|date=2013|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnQ-es6oHWAC&amp;pg=PA260}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has received a 90-percent rating from [[NARAL]] and previously served on that organization's national board. In 2015 Chafee said that he strongly supported "a woman's right to make her own personal reproductive decisions."&lt;ref name=c2016 /&gt;

Chafee is the only governor to have vetoed a bill proposing the availability of [[Choose Life license plates]] to Rhode Islanders, citing an inappropriateness of using state license plates to fund politically divisive initiatives and as a violation of the [[separation of Church and State]]. This decision was criticized as a violation of [[free speech]] and as having been influenced by his previous post on NARAL's Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lifenews.com/2013/07/17/rhode-island-governor-chafee-vetoes-choose-life-license-plate/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.providencejournal.com/article/20130716/NEWS/307169972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.630wpro.com/2013/07/17/news-chafee-vetoes-choose-life-license-plate-bill/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Crime and civil rights ====
Chafee's policy on firearms regulation mirrors the views of his father, [[John Chafee]], who was generally supportive of a strict regulatory environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carter|first1=Greg|title=Guns in American Society: A-L|date=2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-57607-268-1|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chafee has received "F" ratings from the [[National Rifle Association]] and the [[Gun Owners of America]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lincoln 'Linc' D.

In 2011, as governor of Rhode Island, Chafee challenged an order of a federal court to transfer a prisoner in state custody to the United States government, because the prisoner in question might be subject to [[capital punishment]], which Rhode Island had abolished. At the time, Chafee said, "my actions are motivated by my obligation as governor to safeguard Rhode Island's sovereignty and the integrity of its laws."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhode Island's Governor Explains His Resistance to Federal Death Penalty Case|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/new-voices-rhode-islands-governor-explains-his-resistance-federal-death-penalty-case|website=Death Penalty Information Center|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Andrew|title=Death Penalty Death Watch: Rhode Island and the Rest of the World|url=http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/22/death-penalty-death-watch-rhode-island-and-the-rest-of-the-world/|accessdate=April 11, 2015|work=New York Times|date=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chafee has indicated he is receptive to the idea of legalizing the recreational use of [[marijuana]] while stopping short of supporting such a move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bender|first1=John|title=Gov. Lincoln Chafee Open, But Cautious About Legalizing Recreational Marijuana|url=http://ripr.org/post/gov-lincoln-chafee-open-cautious-about-legalizing-recreational-marijuana|accessdate=April 10, 2015|work=[[Rhode Island Public Radio]]|date=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Chafee said he believed "certain of our rights have been wrongfully infringed upon. Particularly the Fourth Amendment which forbids the tapping of our phones without a warrant."&lt;ref name=c2016 /&gt; While in the U.S. Senate, Chafee was the only Republican to vote against the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]], which restricted [[habeas corpus]] rights of persons detained by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] as [[enemy combatant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Jeff|title=Politics on a Human Scale: The American Tradition of Decentralism|date=2013|publisher=Lexington Books|page=387|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVwrAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Elections ====
Chafee has said he supports requiring voters to present photo identification at polling places.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news|last1=Levitz|first1=Jennifer|title=The Price of Independence|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203686204577113041765247520|accessdate=April 10, 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|date=December 23, 2011|ref=wsj}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 he signed legislation mandating photo ID in Rhode Island elections, stating that he believed requiring photo ID was a "reasonable request to ensure the accuracy and integrity of our elections."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beale|first1=Stephen|title=NEW: Chafee Defends Voter ID Law|url=http://www.golocalprov.com/news/new-chafee-defends-voter-id-bill/|accessdate=April 10, 2015|work=GoLocalProv|date=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rhode Island law does allow voters without an approved form of identification to cast a provisional ballot that will be counted if the voter's signature matches the one on file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voter ID Laws Passed Since 2011|url=https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/voter-id-laws-passed-2011/|date=November 12, 2013|work=Brennan Center for Justice|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, five years after his ''Providence Journal'' commentary urging passage of the plan, Chafee signed legislation entering Rhode Island into the [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Katherine Gregg|date=
July 12, 2013| title=From National Popular Vote to liquor store hours, Chafee signs legislation into law|url=http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/pages/articles/providencejournal_20130712.php|accessdate=July 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As governor he also signed legislation creating the Voter Choice Study Commission "for the purpose of studying [[instant-runoff voting]] and other advanced voting methods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |title=RI Gen L § 17-29-3 (2014)|work=law.justia.com|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/rhode-island/2014/title-17/chapter-17-29/section-17-29-3|accessdate=July 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Senate, Chafee voted in support of the 2002 [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] (commonly known as the McCain-Feingold Act), which tightened regulation of "soft money" contributions in political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate passes McCain-Feingold|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2001/apr/3/20010403-021907-7707r/?page=all|accessdate=April 10, 2015|work=Washington Times|date=April 3, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Environment ====
Chafee has stated his opposition to oil drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]]. In the Senate he opposed the [[Clear Skies Act of 2003]] which critics said would increase [[air pollution]] if enacted. Chafee has argued that granite is objectively the best rock as it is vital to Rhode Island's economy. The [[League of Conservation Voters]] has given Chafee a 79-percent rating while, in 2006, he received an endorsement from the [[Sierra Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuniga|first1=Markos|title=Taking on the System: Rules for Radical Change in a Digital Era|date=2008|publisher=Celebra|isbn=0-451-22519-8|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Metric system ====
Chafee supports switching the U.S. to the [[metric system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/04/politics/lincoln-chafee-metric-system/index.html|title=Metric advocates love Lincoln Chafee – CNNPolitics.com|author=Eric Bradner, CNN|date=June 4, 2015|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Same-sex marriage ====
Chafee opposes a [[Federal Marriage Amendment|constitutional amendment]] intended to ban gay marriage. In 2011, Governor Chafee signed a bill into law legalizing [[civil union]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gaymarriage-rhodeisland/rhode-island-governor-signs-gay-civil-union-law-despite-doubts-idUSTRE7611JF20110702|title=Rhode Island governor signs gay civil union law despite doubts|last=Howard|first=Zach|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, as governor of Rhode Island, Chafee signed legislation legalizing [[same-sex marriage]] in that state, declaring that "we are living up to the ideal of our founders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rhode Island Becomes 10th State To Allow Same-Sex Marriage|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/05/02/180647841/rhode-island-house-passes-same-sex-marriage-bill|accessdate=April 10, 2015|work=[[NPR]]|date=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Taxes ====
As Rhode Island governor, Chafee called for a cut in the commercial property tax to spur economic development in [[Providence, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kuffner|first1=Alex|title=Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee says that the commercial property tax in Providence is second-highest in the nation behind only Detroit|url=http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2012/feb/10/lincoln-chafee/rhode-island-governor-lincoln-chafee-says-commerci/|accessdate=April 10, 2015|work=Providence Journal|date=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[National Taxpayers Union]], a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Taxpayer groups|taxpayers advocacy organization]], as U.S. Senator from Rhode Island,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Chafee received grades of D in 2000, C- in 2001, C in 2002, C- in 2003 and 2004, D in 2005 and 2006, and as Governor of Rhode Island, Chafee received a "B" rating, the [[National Taxpayers Union]] citing his move to repeal the Rhode Island franchise tax and reduce estate taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Which Governors Made the Honor Roll?|url=http://www.ntu.org/governmentbytes/detail/which-governors-made-the-honor-roll|publisher=National Taxpayers Union|accessdate=April 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also as Governor of Rhode Island, Chafee received grades of D in 2012&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; and B in 2014&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; from the [[Cato Institute]], a [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors.

In 2001 and 2003, while in the U.S. Senate, Chafee voted against the [[Bush tax cuts]] arguing he was concerned they favored the highest income brackets and about unchecked growth in the federal deficit. Chafee said that "cutting taxes is easy for politicians, we love to cut taxes. It takes responsibility to make sure our revenues match our expenditures and we're not doing that right now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sen. Lincoln Chafee on the Bush tax cuts proposal|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/04/24/cnna.cnna.chaffee/|accessdate=April 10, 2015|work=CNN|date=April 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iran ====
Chafee supports President Obama's nuclear disarmament agreement with Iran. He has called for deescalation combined with cultural dialogue and exchange modeled after "the [[ping pong diplomacy]] of the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] era."&lt;ref name=book /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scholars Online: Lincoln Chafee|url=http://www.choices.edu/resources/scholars_Chafee.php|website=Choices Program|publisher=[[Brown University]]|accessdate=April 10, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319054442/http://choices.edu/resources/scholars_Chafee.php|archivedate=March 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Israel ====
Chafee has criticized what he has characterized as a Biblical influence on U.S. policy with respect to [[Israel]]. He has said he opposes the expansion of [[Israeli settlements]] in the [[West Bank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mulligan|first1=John|title=Chafee, Laffey differ on Mideast|work=Providence Journal|date=April 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but described Hamas as a "violent organization with a genocidal charter" one year after it revoked its charter calling for the destruction of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 06-092t (Text of Sen.

Chafee has said the U.S. "must make international decisions with brains and not biceps" and criticized Hillary Clinton's vote in support of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.]]

==== Latin America ====
Referring to [[Latin America]], Chafee has called for the U.S. government to "reenagage our neighbors." However, Chafee has also said recent U.S. inattention to the region was "a blessing in disguise" as it allowed democratic governments to flourish free of U.S. influence.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chafee|first1=Lincoln|title=Against the Tide: How a Compliant Congress Empowered a Reckless President|date=2010|publisher=Macmillan|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Russia ====
Chafee has said one of the U.S.' highest priorities should be improving relations with the [[Russian Federation]] and has called for rapprochement, including the lifting of [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|sanctions against Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shabad|first1=Rebecca|title=Lincoln Chafee questions US sanctions against Russia|url=http://thehill.com/policy/international/244243-lincoln-chafee-questions-us-sanctions-against-russia|accessdate=June 7, 2015|work=The Hill|date=June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has called the [[Ukrainian crisis]] a "tug-of-war between Russia and the [[European Union|EU]]" and said that the way to solve the issue was through [[Future enlargement of the European Union#Russia|Russian accession to the European Union]].&lt;ref name=msnbc /&gt;

==== War ====
While serving in the United States Senate, Chafee was one of 23 senators, and the only Republican, to vote against the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002|Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq]], which provided the legal mechanism for the [[2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt; When asked, in 2015, how the U.S. could most effectively deal with [[ISIS]], Chafee said the U.S. should pursue a policy of containment through alliance-building with regional powers.&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;{{cite news|title=Chafee: We should be talking with Iran|url=http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/chafee--we-should-be-talking-with-iran-426037827949|accessdate=April 10, 2015|work=MSNBC|date=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chafee has said the U.S. "must make international decisions with brains and not biceps",&lt;ref name=c2016 /&gt; and at the first 2016 Democratic primary debate, stated that the U.S. must end its use of "[[perpetual war]]s",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Full Transcript: Democratic Presidential Debate|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/us/politics/democratic-debate-transcript.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = October 14, 2015|access-date = October 21, 2015|issn = 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring in part to the [[War on Terror]]. In his speech declaring his withdrawal from the 2016 Presidential race at the annual Women's Leadership Forum in Washington, DC, Chafee again made the case for peace, attacking the field of Republican candidates for demonstrating a lack of desire "to understand anything about the Middle East and North Africa" and instead espousing "more bellicosity, more saber rattling, and more blind macho posturing." He ended the speech by reminding the audience that the United States was one of the strongest countries in history, economically, militarily, and culturally and so not only could afford to take risks for peace, but "must take risks for peace." Arguing for a new paradigm, he concluded by asking the audience whether they wanted to be remembered as bombers of weddings and hospitals, or as peace makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chafee |first1=Lincoln |title=Chafee Withdraws From 2016 Presidential Race |url=https://www.chafee2016.com/chafee-withdraws-from-2016-democratic-presidential-race/ |website=Chafee2016.com |accessdate=October 26, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204075246/http://www.chafee2016.com/chafee-withdraws-from-2016-democratic-presidential-race/ |archivedate=February 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Endorsements ===
Chafee endorsed [[George W. Bush]] in the [[2000 U.S. presidential election]], but declined to endorse Bush in the 2004 contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Michelle|title=Former GOPer-turned-Independent governor could join Dems|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/former-goper-turned-independent-governor-coul|accessdate=April 10, 2014|date=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Chafee endorsed [[Barack Obama]] for U.S. president during the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|Democratic Party presidential primaries]], and went on to serve as national co-chair of Obama's 2012 reelection campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cook|first1=Nancy|title=Former R.I.

&lt;!-- When adding people to this list, please make sure their polyamory is documented via citation here. See Talk page for discussion of this. Also, note that "free love" does not always imply polyamory; sometimes it was closer to "serial monogamy". There is a similar list at Open_marriage#Notable_people_in_open_marriages where people on that list are not necessarily polyamorous but are married.--&gt;
This is a list of notable and historic figures who have been or are polyamorous. [[Polyamory]] is the desire, practice, or acceptance of more than one strong, deep, close and true loving, romantic, and/or [[intimate relationship]] at a time, with the full knowledge and [[consent]] of all involved.

==List==
&lt;!-- When adding people to this list a reliable source must be added that explicitly identifies the subject as "polyamorous". Living people added to this list without such a source may violate our [[WP:BLP]], our policy on biographies of living people, and may be reverted. --&gt;

'''Onuphrius''' or '''Onoufrios''' ({{lang-el|Ὀνούφριος}}), venerated as '''Saint Onuphrius''' in both the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Eastern Catholic Church]]es; '''Venerable Onuphrius''' in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and '''Saint Nofer the Anchorite''' in [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], lived as a [[hermit]] in the desert of [[Upper Egypt]] in the 4th or 5th centuries.{{sfn|Butler, p.94}}

==Life and legends==
Onophrius was one of the [[Desert Fathers]] who made a great impression on Eastern spirituality in the third and fourth centuries, around the time that Christianity was emerging as the dominant faith of the Roman Empire.  At this time many Christians were inspired to go out into the desert and live in prayer in the harsh environment of extreme heat and cold, with little to eat and drink, surrounded by all sorts of dangerous animals and robbers.&lt;ref name=ukrainian/&gt;

It is uncertain in which century Onuphrius lived; the account of [[Paphnutius the Ascetic]], who encountered him in the Egyptian desert, forms the sole source for our knowledge of the life of Saint Onuphrius.{{sfn|Butler, p.94}}  Even the authorship is uncertain; "Paphnutius", a common name of Egyptian origin in the [[Thebaid|Upper Thebaid]], may refer to Paphnutius of Scetis, a 4th-century abbot of [[Lower Egypt]], rather than Paphnutius the Ascetic.{{sfn|Butler, pp.95-96}}  "But Paphnutius the Great [i.e. Paphnutius the Ascetic]," [[Alban Butler]] writes, "also had a number of stories to tell of visions and miraculous happenings in the desert, some of them in much the same vein as the story of Onuphrius."{{sfn|Butler, pp.95-96}}

The name Onuphrius is thought to be a Hellenized form of a [[Copts|Coptic]] name ''Unnufer'', ultimately from 
the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: ''[[:wikt:wnn-nfr|wnn-nfr]]'' meaning "perfect one", or "he who is continually good", an epithet of the god [[Osiris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A tradition, not found in Paphnutius' account, states that Onuphrius had studied [[jurisprudence]] and [[philosophy]] before becoming a monk near [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and then a hermit.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

According to Paphnutius’s account, Paphnutius undertook a pilgrimage to study the hermits’ way of life and to determine whether it was for him.  Wandering in the desert for 16 days, on the 17th day, Paphnutius came across a wild figure covered in hair, wearing a loincloth of leaves.  Frightened, Paphnutius ran away, up a mountain, but the figure called him back, shouting, “Come down to me, man of God, for I am a man also, dwelling in the desert for the love of God.”{{sfn|Butler, p.94}}
[[Image:Kidron jerusalem (10533).jpg|thumb|250px|Stone carving above the entrance of the Onuphrius monastery in [[Akeldama]], Jerusalem (Potter's field). The image shows Onuphrius bowing down to an angel. Notable features are his long beard and leaf loincloth.]]
Turning back, Paphnutius talked to the wild figure, who introduced himself as Onuphrius and explained that he had once been a monk at a large monastery in the Thebaid but who had now lived as a hermit for 70 years, enduring extreme thirst, hunger, and discomforts. He said that it was his guardian angel who had brought him to this desolate place.&lt;ref name=ukrainian/&gt; Onuphrius took Paphnutius to his cell, and they spoke until sunset, when bread and water miraculously appeared outside of the hermit's cell.{{sfn|Butler, p.94}}

They spent the night in the prayer, and in the morning Paphnutius discovered that Onuphrius was near death.  Paphnutius, distressed, asked the hermit if he should occupy Onuphrius’ cell after the hermit’s death, but Onuphrius told him, "That may not be, thy work is in Egypt with thy brethren."{{sfn|Butler, p.94}} Onuphrius asked Paphnutius for there to be a memorial with incense in Egypt in remembrance of the hermit.  He then blessed the traveler and died.{{sfn|Butler, p.94}}

Due to the hard and rocky ground, Paphnutius could not dig a hole for a grave, and therefore covered Onuphrius’ body in a cloak, leaving the hermit’s body in a cleft of the rocks.  After the burial, Onuphrius’ cell crumbled, which Paphnutius took to be a sign that he should not stay.{{sfn|Butler, p.94}}

One scholar has written that Onuphrius’ life "fits the mold of countless desert hermits or anchorites... [However] despite its predictability, Paphnutius' ''Life of Onuphrius'' is marked by several unique details... the years of Onuphrius' youth were passed in a monastery that observed the rule of strict silence; a [[Red Deer|hind]] instructed him in Christian rites and liturgy.  During his sixty years in the desert, Onuphrius' only visitor was an angel who delivered a [[Sacramental bread|Host]] every Sunday..."&lt;ref&gt;Peter W. Parshall; Rainer Schoch, National Gallery of Art (U.S.); ''Origins of European Printmaking'' (Yale University Press, 2005), 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Churches traditionally mark his [[feast day]] on [[June 12 (Orthodox Liturgics)|12 June]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://oca.org/saints/lives/2000/06/12/107799-venerable-onuphrius-the-great "Venerable Onuphrius the Great", Orthodox Church in America]&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Life'' of Onuphrius of later Greek origin states that the saint died on June 11; however, his feast day was celebrated on June 12 in the Eastern Orthodox calendars from an early date.

The legend of Saint Onuphrius was depicted in [[Pisa|Pisa's]] camposanto (monumental cemetery), and in [[Rome]], a church, [[Sant'Onofrio (Rome)|Sant'Onofrio]], was built in his honor on the [[Janiculan Hill]] in the fifteenth century.{{sfn|Butler, p.96}}

Antony, the [[archbishop of Novgorod]], writing around 1200 AD, stated that Onuphrius’ head was conserved in the church of Saint Acindinus (Akindinos) ([[Constantinople]]).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/56850|title=Sant' Onofrio su santiebeati.it|website=Santiebeati.it|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For several decades Orthodox seminarians in Poland have begun their spiritual training in the monastery of St. Onuphrius in Jablechna. It is said that the saint himself chose the place for it, appearing nearly four hundred years ago to fishermen and leaving them an Icon of himself on the banks of the river Buh.&lt;ref name=ukrainian&gt;[http://www.ukrainian-orthodoxy.org/saints/beauty/OnuphriusEng.htm "Venerable Onuphrius the Great", Ukrainian Orthodoxy]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a monastery in [[Jerusalem]] dedicated to him. The monastery is located at the far end of Gai Ben Hinnom, the [[Gehenna]]  valley of hell, further it is situated within the site of a Jewish Second Temple cemetery and is built among and includes many typical burial niches common to that period. The monastery also marks the location of Hakeldama, the purported place where Judas Iscariot hanged himself.

Saint Onuphrius was venerated in [[Munich]], [[Basel]], and southern [[Germany]], and the Basel [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist]] [[Sebastian Brant]] (who named his own son Onuphrius&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Peter W. Parshall; Rainer Schoch, National Gallery of Art (U.S.); ''Origins of European Printmaking'' (Yale University Press, 2005), 319.&lt;/ref&gt;) published a broadside named ''In Praise of the Divine Onuphrius and Other Desert Hermit Saints''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  Onuphrius was depicted in a 1520 painting by [[Hans Schäufelein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bridgemanartondemand.com/art/205761/St_Onuphrius_c1520|title=Art.com - Bridgeman Collection|website=www.bridgemanartondemand.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Images of Saint Onuphrius were conflated with those of the medieval “[[wild man]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/press/exh/206/index.htm National Gallery of Art | Press Office&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830070851/http://www.nga.gov/press/exh/206/index.htm |date=2008-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In art, he is depicted as a wild man completely covered with hair, wearing a girdle of leaves.{{sfn|Butler, p.96}}

He is depicted at [[Snake Church]] (''Yilanlı Kilise'') in the [[Churches of Göreme, Turkey|Göreme valley open-air museum]] in [[Cappadocia]], [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nevsehir.gov.tr/ing_nevsehir_detay.php?id=79 T.C. Nevşehir Valiliği&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became the [[patron saint]] of weavers due to the fact that he was depicted "dressed only in his own abundant hair, and a loin-cloth of leaves".

He (S. Onofrio) was named co-saint patron of the city of [https://web.archive.org/web/20120328113921/http://www.santonofrio.com/home.htm Palermo] in 1650.

===Name variants===
His name appears very variously as '''Onuphrius''', '''Onouphrius''', '''Onofrius'''; and in different languages as '''Onofre''' (Portuguese, Spanish), '''[[Onofrio]]''' (Italian), etc. In [[Arabic]], the saint was known as ''Abū Nufir'' ({{lang-ar|ابو نفر}}) or as ''Nofer'' ({{lang-ar|نوفر}}), which, besides being a variant of the name Onuphrius, also means "herbivore."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
Onuphrius and Onofrio are sometimes Anglicized as '''[[wikt:Humphrey|Humphrey]]''', an unrelated name that is usually given a [[Germanic name|Germanic]] etymology.&lt;!--as in wiktionary--&gt;

===Folklore===
Sicilians pray to Saint Onuphrius when they have lost something. The prayer has many variants but it generally mentions the miraculous properties of Saint Onuphrius' hair . It is widely accepted that repeating the prayer whilst looking for something like keys, a misplaced ring or anything else, will greatly help in finding it sooner.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

'''Robert Macaire''' is a fictional character, an unscrupulous swindler, who appears in a number of French plays, films, and other works of art. In French culture he represents an archetypal villain. He was principally the creation of an actor, [[Frédérick Lemaître]], who took the stock figure of "a ragged tramp, a common thief with tattered frock coat patched pants" and transformed him during his performances into "the dapper confidence man, the financial schemer, the juggler of joint-stock companies" that could serve to lampoon financial speculation and government corruption.&lt;ref name=ramus&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramus|first1=Charles F.|title=Daumier, 120 Great Lithographs |date=1978|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2XB2JrB-cnMC&amp;pg=PR15&amp;|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playwright [[Benjamin Antier]] (1787–1870), with two collaborators [[Saint-Amand (writer)|Saint-Amand]] and [[Polyanthe]], created the character Robert Macaire in the play ''l'Auberge des Adrets'', a serious-minded melodrama. After the work's failure at its 1823 premiere, [[Frédérick Lemaître]] played the role as a comic figure instead. Violating all the conventions of its genre, it became a comic success and ran for a hundred performances. The transformation violated social standards that demanded crime be treated with seriousness and expected criminals to be punished appropriately. The play was soon banned, and representations of the character of Macaire were banned time and again until the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCormick|first1=John|title=Popular Theatres of Nineteenth Century France|date=1993|publisher=Routledge |page=106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IeeJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lemaître used the character again in a sequel he co-authored titled ''Robert Macaire'', first presented in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamilton| first1=Paul|title=The Oxford Handbook of European Romanticism|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=765| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DXswCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA765&amp;|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Robert Macaire.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece: G. W. M. Reynolds' ''Robert Macaire; or the French Bandit in England'' (London: J. Dicks, 1839)]]
The British author [[George W. M. Reynolds|George William MacArthur Reynolds]] authored a penny dreadful entitled ''Robert Macaire; or, The French Bandit in England'' (1839).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| accessdate = 8 January 2017 | title = British Writers and Paris: 1830-1875 | first= Elizabeth | last = Jay | page= 270 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hZFPCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA270&amp; | date = 2016 | publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Physiologie du Robert-Macaire'' (1842) written by [[Pierre-Joseph Rousseau]] (1797–1849) and illustrated by [[Honoré Daumier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher= Museum of Fine Arts Boston | accessdate = 19 February 2016 | title = Physiologie du Robert-Macaire | url = http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/physiologie-du-robert-macaire-167930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; identified Macaire with a variety of contemporary social types, all involved in "shady schemes for instant wealth", and especially [[Émile de Girardin]] (1806-1881), a businessman who promoted his financial adventures through his own newspaper, ''[[La Presse (French newspaper)|La Presse]]''.&lt;ref name=ramus/&gt; Daumier also published a series of a hundred lithographs of Macaire in ''Charivari'' between 1836 and 1842.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| pages=41–2 | title= Caricature and French Political Culture 1830-1848: Charles Philipon and the Illustrated Press | first=David S. | last=Kerr | publisher= Oxford University Press| date=2000 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YXNO_Jc1eb0C&amp;pg=PA42&amp; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Jakobowski]] based his comic opera ''[[Erminie]]'' on an English translation of the play '' Robert Macaire''. It premiered in London in 1885. It had a considerable success. Its first New York production ran for 571 performances.

Two silent films used the character Macaire: ''[[Robert Macaire and Bertrand]]'' (1906) and ''The Adventures of Robert Macaire'' (1925).

The French film ''[[Children of Paradise|Les Enfants du Paradis]]'' (1945), set in the 1830s, presents [[Pierre Brasseur]] as Lemaître playing the role of Macaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Margaret|title=Film and Community in Britain and France: From La Regle du Jeu to Room at the Top|date=2004|publisher=I.B.

''La Robert-Macaire'' was the name of a popular dance, mentioned along with the [[cancan]] in an 1841 play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | accessdate = 14 February 2017| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nQNfAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp; | page = 22 | title = 1841 et 1941, ou aujourd'hui et dans cent ans, revue fantastique en deux actes | language = fr | quote = Messieurs les étudians, / S'en vont à la Chaumière, / Pour y danser l'cancan, / Et la Robert-Macaire ! | author= Cognard Frères and Théodore Muret | date= 1841 | publisher = Lacombe }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earlier use of the name==
Before Lemaître created his politically-charged Macaire character, the name Robert Macaire was associated with a figure in a 14th-century legend who was required to engage in trail-by-combat with a dog. A melodrama called ''[[The Dog of Montarges|Le Chien de Montargis, ou la Forêt de Bondy]]'' premiered in Paris on 18 June 1814 and ran until 1834. It was translated into English&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrymore |first1= William|title=Murder Will Out, or The Dog of Montargis|year=1814|page=55|edition=Plays Submitted to the Lord Chamberlain| first2=John| last2= Fawcett }}&lt;/ref&gt; and German. In an English-language compendium of oddities published in 1869, Macaire murders a man in the forest of [[Bondy]] on the outskirts of Paris. The only witness to survive in the victim's dog. King [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] orders a trial by combat and the dog defeats Macaire, which leads to Macaire's conviction and hanging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | accessdate = 19 February 2016 | title = The Book of Days: A Miscellany of Popular Antiquities | chapter= October 8th | url = http://www.thebookofdays.com/months/oct/8.htm | year = 1869 | first = Robert | last = Chambers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His younger siblings were two brothers, Kevin and Vin, and a sister, Sheila.&lt;ref name=siblings&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article69967603 |title=Obituary paragraphs. |newspaper=[[The Advocate (Tasmania)|The Advocate]] |location=Burnie, Tas. |date=12 April 1954 |accessdate=21 March 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Catholic mother sent him to [[St Virgil's College]] in Hobart to be schooled, although his Catholicism lapsed once he moved out of home and he was later known to be an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] who did not attend Mass.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;[[Michael Field (Australian politician)|Michael Field]], [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/fagan-roy-frederick-12473/text22435 'Fagan, Roy Frederick (1905–1990)'], ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 18 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On leaving school, Fagan joined the staff of the [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia|Commonwealth Bank]] where he worked until 1929, when he resigned to attend university.&lt;ref name=tasbar&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article24954972 |title=ADMITTED TO BAR. |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=9 August 1934 |accessdate=21 March 2013 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was [[Admission to practice law|admitted to the Bar]] in August 1934, after what the Hobart ''Mercury'' newspaper called a "brilliant university career".&lt;ref name=tasbar /&gt; Fagan also completed a Bachelor of Arts and graduated in May 1935.&lt;ref name=barts&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article91723944 |title=DEGREES CONFERRED AT UNIVERSITY. |newspaper=[[The Advocate (Tasmania)|The Advocate]] |location=Burnie, Tas. |date=15 May 1935 |accessdate=21 March 2013 |page=7 Edition: DAILY |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Fagan was asked by the Premier of Tasmania, [[Robert Cosgrove]], to stand for the seat of [[Division of Lyons (state)|Wilmot]] at the [[Tasmanian state election, 1946]]. Immediately following declaration of his election, Fagan was appointed Attorney-General in Cosgrove's cabinet.&lt;ref name=cabinet&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26416884 |title=A Minister Shunned Publicity |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=7 June 1947 |accessdate=18 March 2013 |page=2 Supplement: The Mercury Magazine |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sherman Houston Dudley''' (1872 – March 1, 1940) was an African-American [[vaudeville]] performer and theatre entrepreneur. He gained notability in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century as an individual performer, a composer of [[ragtime]] songs, and as a member and later owner of various minstrel shows including the [[Smart Set (minstrel show)|Smart Set]]. Dudley is also notable as one of the first African Americans to combine business with theater, by starting a black theater circuit, in which theaters were owned or operated by African Americans and provided entertainment by and for African Americans.

==Career==
Reportedly, Dudley was born in 1872 in [[Dallas]], Texas (some sources list his year of birth as 1870&lt;ref name=monsho/&gt; or 1873&lt;ref name=southern/&gt;), "of humble parentage".&lt;ref name=abbot87&gt;Abbot and Seroff 87.&lt;/ref&gt; A jockey early in his youth, he turned to theater and gained a reputation by singing in a [[medicine show]] on a Dallas street corner, singing "[[Dese Bones G'wine Rise Again]]". By 1897 he had his own show, the "S. H. Dudley's Georgia Minstrels", who were performing in [[Galveston]]; later that same year he was on tour with [[P. T. Wright]]'s Nashville Students Company. He gained a reputation for writing popular [[coon song]]s (including a hit song called "Mr. Coon, You'se Too Black For Me"),&lt;ref name=abbot87/&gt; and performed with a number of minstrel comedians in shows in the same vein, including ''A Holiday in Coonville'' (his own production) and ''Coontown Golf Club'' (a production by Tom Brown&lt;ref&gt;Hill and Hatch 141-42.&lt;/ref&gt; and Sam Cousins&lt;ref&gt;Brooks 602.&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Abbot and Seroff 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt; When he toured with Tom Brown and [[Billy Kersands]] in 1902, it was clear that he was a popular, well-known artist in the South, and was billed as "the Lone-Star comedian". In 1903 he married Alberta Ormes, with whom he'd been performing since at least 1901, and was on tour the following year with [[Richard and Pringle's Georgia Minstrels]].&lt;ref name=abbot89/&gt; By this time, he received star billing.&lt;ref name=brooks520/&gt; In the summer of 1904, however, he left that company and moved to Chicago to take over the leading role in [[Gus Hill]]'s Smart Set&lt;ref name=brooks520&gt;Brooks 520.&lt;/ref&gt; after the death of [[Tom McIntosh (comedian)|Tom McIntosh]], performing in the show ''A Southern Enchantment''.&lt;ref name=abbot89&gt;Abbot and Seroff 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dudley performed with the Smart Set for years with great success, though one critic, Sylvester Russell (a writer for the ''[[Indianapolis Freeman]]''), was hard on him from the beginning, presumably because he felt that Dudley's minstrel show background made him unworthy; in 1906, Russell referred to him as "this loathsome comedian who hails from the Lone Star State." It seems that Dudley took all this in stride until 1911, when Russell made a comment about Dudley's son, after which Dudley beat him up "$5,000 worth", according to Russell; Dudley was arrested and fined $1 and court costs, after which Russell sued him for $5,000. Other critics were less hesitant to praise Dudley's performance, and he is now credited with having brought "the street to the stage": "Dudley revitalized the Smart Set and made it into an enduring classic of the American popular stage."&lt;ref&gt;Abbot and Seroff 90.&lt;/ref&gt; In the next Smart Set show, ''The Black Politician'' (1906), Dudley got to use his jockey skills riding a horse on stage, and when in October 1906 a donkey named Shamus O'Brien was added (though another source lists the donkey's name as "Patrick"&lt;ref name=brooks520/&gt;), the donkey and Dudley received high praise from critics, even from Russell.&lt;ref&gt;Abbot and Seroff 96-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, the Smart Set split up in a Northern and a Southern Smart Set, the first being directed by Dudley and the latter by his understudy, [[Tutt Brothers|Salem Tutt Whitney]]; their 1909-10 production, ''His Honor, the Barber'' was written by a white playwright, [[Edwin Handford]], with music written for the show by black composers [[James Tim Brymn]], [[Chris Smith (composer)|Chris Smith]], and [[James Burris]]. The show opened in New Jersey for a mixed audience, and by the time of the final run [[Aida Overton Walker]] had joined the cast.&lt;ref&gt;Abbot and Seroff 102-104.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Dudley was widely known as the "Lone Star Comedian" and had begun to expand his business ventures, moving into theater in an attempt to have a black-owned and operated string of venues around the United States, a dream of his since at least 1907.&lt;ref name=abbot106&gt;Abbot and Seroff 106-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

By about 1910 Dudley was based in Washington D.C., where he served as general manager and treasurer of the [[Colored Actors' Union]]. In 1911 he set up S. H. Dudley Theatrical Enterprises, and began buying and leasing theaters to develop the first black vaudeville circuit, initially around Washington and Virginia;&lt;ref name=monsho&gt;{{cite web|last=Monsho|first=Kharen|title=Dudley, Sherman H.|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fdumj|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had bought his first theater, in Baltimore, in 1912.&lt;ref name=southern&gt;Southern 297-98.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1912, he played his last season with the Smart Set, from then on devoting himself to his "circuit of theaters."&lt;ref name=abbot106/&gt; By 1916 the "Dudley Circuit" had extended into the south and Midwest, enabling black entertainers to secure longer term contracts for an extended season; his circuit provided the basis for the [[Theater Owners Bookers Association]] (TOBA).&lt;ref name=monsho/&gt; His circuit was advertised in a weekly column published in black newspapers, "What's What on the Dudley's Circuit", and by 1914 it included over twenty theaters, "all owned or operated by blacks and as far south as Atlanta." TOBA was founded by people associated with Dudley's circuit, and while the organization was white-owned it had black regional managers, including Dudley (for the Washington, D.C. area).&lt;ref name=southern/&gt;

After 1917 Dudley devoted himself to producing black musicals, including updated Smart Set productions. He sold his theaters around 1930 (due to economic forces "beyond his control"&lt;ref name=southern/&gt;), and retired to a farm in Maryland where he bred thoroughbred racehorses.&lt;ref name=monsho/&gt;

{{The Fourteen Infallible}}
'''The Fourteen Infallibles''' ({{lang-ar|معصومون}} '' Ma‘sūmūn'') ({{lang-fa|چهارده معصوم}} '' Chahar'dah Ma‘sūm'') in [[Twelver|Twelver Shia Islam]] are the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], his daughter [[Fatima Zahra]], and [[Twelve Imams|the Twelve Imams]]. All are considered to be [[ismah|infallible]] under the theological concept of [[Ismah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dabashi|2006|p=463}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Corbin|1993|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, they have the power to commit sin but by their nature are able to avoid doing so, which is regarded as a miraculous gift from [[God in Islam|God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1989|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Infallibles are believed to follow only God's desire in their actions because of their supreme righteousness, consciousness, and love for God.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donaldson|1933|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also regarded as being immune to error in practical matters, in calling people to religion, and in the perception of divine knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ansariyan|2007|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shia]]s believe the Fourteen Infallibles are superior to the rest of creation and to the other major [[Prophets in Islam|prophets]].&lt;ref name="harvnb|Algar|1990"&gt;{{harvnb|Algar|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Treadwell Stone ''' (February 9, 1801 – November, 1895) was an American [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] pastor, [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], and [[Transcendentalist]].

==Life and work==
Thomas Treadwell Stone was born on February 9, 1801 in [[Waterford, Maine]] to Solomon Stone and Hepzibah Treadwell Stone.  His maternal grandfather, Thomas Treadwell, served with the [[Minutemen]] and was at the [[battle of Bunker Hill]] with Colonel [[William Prescott]]'s regiment.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas T. Stone, Letter to his Brother, August 23, 1894, Bolton, Massachusetts Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt;   At that time Waterford was an area of new and sparsely populated farmland, and Solomon Stone made his living as a farmer.  Thomas attended [[Bridgton Academy]] and graduated from [[Bowdoin College]] in 1820.

==Early Career and Marriage==
Thomas married Laura Elizabeth Poor in January 1825 in [[Andover, Maine]] .  Laura's brother [[Henry Varnum Poor]] was a financial analyst and founder of H.V. and H.W. Poor Co.,  which later evolved into the financial research and analysis bellwether, [[Standard &amp; Poor's]]. Thomas and Laura's marriage produced 7 sons (Thomas, Walter, Henry, Lincoln, [[Alfred E. Stone|Alfred]], George, and William) and five daughters (two Lauras, Mary, Martha, and Elizabeth).  After studying theology and performing missionary work in Oxford County, Maine, he was ordained in at the Orthodox Congregational Church in Andover, a traditional Congregational church.  In this most northwesterly town then organized in Maine, he served under a Dr. Tappan from 1824 to 1830.&lt;ref&gt;National Cyclopedia of American Biography, V. 2 (New York, NY, James T. White, 1921)&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1830 to 1832 he headed Bridgton Academy in Maine.&lt;ref&gt;Appleton's Cyclopaedia of American Biography, v.5 (New York. NY. Appleton and Company, 1866).&lt;/ref&gt;   Among his students was [[John Albion Andrew]], the radical abolitionist, who would become Governor of Massachusetts during the Civil War years.

==Formation of Anti-slavery sentiment==
From 1832 to 1846 Stone and his family resided in East Machias, Maine,where he was pastor of the Union Church.  As seen by his writing and lectures during this time, Stone became an early convert to abolitionism.  As early as the 1830s Thomas Stone was exhorting his congregation that slavery was a national problem.  "It was the duty of all Christians", according to Stone, "to do our utmost in resisting [slavery], through the Spirit of Christ."&lt;ref&gt;Lou Falkner Williams, introduction to "Bitter Freedom: William Stone's Record of Service in the Freedmen's Bureau," edited by Suzanne Stone Johnson and Robert Allison Johnson (2008),p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; East Machias was home to many intellectuals at that time, and his church members included many who later took on theological leadership positions in New England educational institutions.  Among them were [[Samuel Harris (theologian)|Samuel Harris]] (President of Bowdoin College and Professor of Theology at [[Yale Divinity School]]), [[Roswell Dwight Hitchcock]] (President, Union Theological Seminary), Ezra Abbott ([[Harvard Divinity School]]), George Harris (Andover Theological School), and [[Arlo Bates]] (professor at MIT).&lt;ref&gt;George Williis Cooke. A Theoretical and Biographical Introduction to Accompany "The Dial", (Cleveland, 1902 Reprint, Bolton Historical Society), 89.&lt;/ref&gt;   Stone lectured for the Massachusetts England Anti-slavery Society, and was a delegate to the 1839 annual meeting of that group.  His sermon ''The Martyr of Freedom'', a discourse delivered at East Machias, in 1837, condemned the killing of [[Elijah Lovejoy]], Stone's friend and an anti-slavery publisher in Illinois.  Lovejoy was a Presbyterian minister editing anti-slavery newspapers in Missouri until his presses were destroyed by mobs.  Lovejoy was killed during an attempt to burn his office in Alton, Illinois.  In his sermon Stone urged his listeners to "proclaim the truth of slavery, not only to peers, but to the slaveholder."  Slavery, he stated, not only destroys those who witness truth but the nation and slaveholder as well.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas T. Stone, The Martyr of Freedom (Boston, [[Isaac Knapp]], 1838), 22-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

These strong abolitionist viewpoints led to Stone's ousting as a Congregationalist minister in 1844.  In 1846 he moved his family from Maine to Massachusetts to become pastor of the First Church of Salem (Massachusetts, Unitarian), where he served until 1852.&lt;ref&gt;First Church In Salem website, http://www.firstchurchinsalem.org/ministers-23.html, retrieved Mar 2012&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he was able to build his anti-slavery fervor, as evidenced by frequent visits by the elite of the movement, including [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[John Greenleaf Whittier]], [[William Lloyd Garrison]], and [[Wendell Phillips]].&lt;ref&gt;George Williis Cooke. A Theoretical and Biographical Introduction to Accompany "The Dial", (Cleveland, 1902 Reprint, Bolton Historical Society), 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactions among many New Englanders to the passage of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] was mixed, but to those who opposed slavery it was fierce.  Discontent among Stone's parishioners at First Church in Salem rose as he became more involved with the fugitive slave issue.  In August 1851, Stone was formally terminated.  His fate was similar to other New England theologians, many who resigned or were dismissed for supporting the anti-slavery cause.

In December 1851 Stone addressed the Salem Female Anti-Slavery Society in Salem, of which his wife, Laura Poor Stone, was a member (an abolition quilt she created there is owned by the Peabody Essex Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Salem Women's History website, http://www.salemwomenshistory.com/First_Church_in_Salem.html, retrieved Mar 2012&lt;/ref&gt;).  During this last recorded public address, he emphasized that slavery was irreconcilable with man being created in God's image, and urged his listeners to know the effects of slavery and pray for its end.  During this speech he acknowledged the sadness and pains suffered by the anti-slavery community by being rejected, denounced and ridiculed by friends, family and church, and thanked them for standing firm for the cause.  Stone and his family moved to [[Bolton, Massachusetts]] in  November, 1852 where he became the 7th minister of the First Parish of Bolton.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton Center Historic Neighborhood Blog, http://boltoncenter.wordpress.com/2010/11/17/street-of-stories/, retrieved Mar 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcendentalism==
Thomas Treadwell Stone, though lesser-known than the other New England Transcendentalists, "had religious, literary, and reform connections to nearly all of the major Transcendentalists and contributed to the DIAL magazine in the early 1840's."&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Transcendentalism, by Tiffany K. Wane, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;  His essay "Man and the Ages" was included in the January 1841 issue, and his "Calvinist's Letter" was published a year later.  "Stone began regular contact with the Boston Transcendentalists and attended meetings of the [[Transcendental Club]], the first organized meeting of people interested in the new philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Transcendentalism, by Tiffany K. Wane, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;  Amos Bronson Alcott numbered him with the members of the Transcendental Club, but it is unknown which meetings he may have attended.&lt;ref&gt;Alcott.net, http://www.alcott.net/alcott/home/champions/Stone.html, retrieved Mar 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Stone was a ready convert to Transcendentalism and an indefatigable worker for the cause of reform.

==Family and Civil War Years==
In 1859 Thomas and his wife Laura moved to [[Brooklyn, Connecticut]] and became pastor of the Unitarian Universalist Church there in 1860.  
The Civil War's anti-slavery theme must have given hope and courage to Stone.  Four of his sons enlisted in the Army of the Potomac, three at the outset and one later.  His son [[William Stone (attorney)|William]] was wounded at [[Antietam]] in September 1862, and again at [[battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] in 1863 as part of the Nineteenth Massachusetts.  William had obvious abolitionist fervor as well, as he was appointed to the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] in March 1866, "probably because of his whole-hearted commitment to black rights".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ibid., p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt;  William also served briefly as the Attorney General for South Carolina.  Thomas's son Lincoln Ripley Stone, was a Surgeon in the [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment]]. Infantry (the first black regiment).  He later practiced medicine in Newton, Massachusetts.  Son George Herbert Stone served as a Private in Co. I, [[38th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]], and died in service in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] in 1863.  Son Henry served as 2d Lieutenant in the 1st Wisconsin Volunteers, and later as Lieutenant Colonel of the 100th U. S. Colored Troops. His son [[Alfred E. Stone|Alfred]] was a noted architect in Providence, RI.

==Final Years==
In 1866 Stone received a [[Doctor of Divinity]] degree from Bowdoin, his Alma Mater.  During his later years he preached and gave lyceum lectures occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;National Cyclopedia and Appleton's Cyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;   Stone returned to Bolton in 1871 where he spent his final years writing.  He died in Bolton in November, 1895. The funeral was held in First Church, Salem, and he and his wife are buried in [[Harmony Grove Cemetery]] in that city.&lt;ref&gt;Salem News, December 4, 1903&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vlasa Mgeladze''' ({{lang-ka|ვლასა მგელაძე}}; {{lang-ru|Власа Джарисманович Мгеладзе}}, ''Vlasa Dzharismanovich Mgeladze''), alias '''Tria''' (Russian: Триа) (1868 – 1943), was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[social democracy|social democratic]] revolutionary and a [[Bolshevik]]-turned-[[Menshevik]] also known as a participant of the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]], of which he wrote a valuable account. 

Mgeladze was an active participant of the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] and the Persian Constitutional Revolution. In 1910, he authored a special report “The Caucasian Social-Democrats in the Persian Revolution” which was sent to the 12th [[International Socialist Bureau|International Socialist Congress]] in [[Copenhagen]] at [[Lenin]]'s urgent request. The report was published in 1910-1911 in Paris and then republished in 1925. His complete memoirs were published in Paris in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Gocheleshvili, Iago (2007), [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00210860601138632 Georgian Sources on the Iranian Constitutional Revolution (1905-1911): Sergo Gamdlishvili's Memoirs of the Gilan Resistance]. ''Iranian  Studies'', vol. 40, no 1: p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1912, Mgeladze, together with [[Grigol Uratadze]], was part of the Georgian delegation to [[Vienna]], where [[Leon Trotsky]] organized his short-lived union of [[Factions of the RSDLP|social democratic factions]] as an alternative to Lenin’s narrow notion of party unity.&lt;ref name="Suny"&gt;[[Ronald Grigor Suny|Suny, Ronald Grigor]] (1994), ''The Making of the Georgian Nation'', p. 176.

The 1921 [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|invasion]] by the [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russian]] army forced Mgeladze into exile to [[France]], where he died in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colisee.org/article.php?id_article=1720 (French) Ière République de Géorgie en exil].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ya'akov Asher''' ({{lang-he-n|יַעֲקֹב אָשֵׁר}}; born 2 July 1965) is an [[Israel]]i rabbi and politician who currently serves as a member of the Knesset for the [[United Torah Judaism]] alliance. A member of the [[Degel HaTorah]] party, he previously served as a member of the Knesset between 2013 and 2015, and was also the thirteenth mayor of [[Bnei Brak]], having taken office in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1058788.html No walk in the park in Bnei Brak - yet] Haaretz, 26 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ya'akov Asher was born and raised in [[Ramat Gan]]. He served in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. Asher is married, with seven children.&lt;ref name=JP&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Features/InThespotlight/Article.aspx?id=302725 Meet the MK: Ya'acov Asher] The Jerusalem Post, 10 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Asher ran for mayor of [[El'ad]], but lost to Tzuriel Krispel. He became mayor of Bnei Brak in 2008, after 19 years on the city council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3625657,00.html Ya'akov Asher promises "not to ask for 100 days of grace"] MyNet, 23 November 2008 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became mayor without an election in the wake of an agreement between Degel HaTorah and [[Agudat Yisrael]] to share the post of mayor on an alternating basis.

Prior to the [[Israeli legislative election, 2013|2013 Knesset elections]], he was placed seventh on the United Torah Judaism list, and entered the Knesset as the alliance won seven seats. His election to the Knesset meant he had to resign his mayoral position. He was placed seventh on the UTJ list again for the [[Israeli legislative election, 2015|2015 elections]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bechirot20.gov.il/election/Candidates/Pages/OneListCandidates.aspx?LPF=Search&amp;WebId=6adadc15-e476-480b-9746-04490aedeb0f&amp;ListID=ba72a662-765c-45af-9d48-fb68080956af&amp;ItemID=44&amp;FieldID=ListNickname_GxS_Text United Torah Judaism list] Central Elections Committee&lt;/ref&gt; but lost his seat when the alliance was reduced to six seats. However, he re-entered the Knesset in May 2016 as a replacement for [[Meir Porush]], when he stood down as part of a seat rotation agreement between the parties in United Torah Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://matzav.com/meir-porush-resigns-yaakov-asher-to-fill-his-knesset-seat/ Meir Porush Resigns, Yaakov Asher to Fill His Knesset Seat] Matzav, 22 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Óengus mac Óengobann''', better known as Saint '''Óengus of Tallaght''' or '''Óengus the Culdee''',&lt;ref&gt;This nickname was first assigned to him, on no apparent authority, by [[John Colgan]] in the 17th century.&lt;/ref&gt; was an Irish bishop, reformer and writer, who flourished in the first quarter of the 9th century and is held to be the author of the ''Félire Óengusso'' ("Martyrology of Óengus") and possibly the ''[[Martyrology of Tallaght]]''.

Little of Óengus's life and career is reliably attested. The most important sources include internal evidence from the ''Félire'', a later [[Middle Irish]] preface to that work, a biographic poem beginning ''Aíbind suide sund amne'' ("Delightful to sit here thus") and the entry for his feast-day inserted into the ''Martyrology of Tallaght''.

==Background==

He was known as a son of Óengoba and grandson of Oíblén,&lt;ref&gt;''Martyrology of Tallaght'', p. 22. (''Oengusa episcopi huí Oíbleáin''); however, ''Aíbind suide sund amne'', stanza 2, has ''mac Oíblén''.&lt;/ref&gt; who is mentioned in a later genealogy as belonging to the [[Dál nAraidi]], a ruling kindred in the north-east of Ireland. A late account prefaced to the Martyrology asserts that Óengus was born in Clúain Édnech or Eidnech ([[Clonenagh]], [[Co. Laois]]), not far from the present town of [[Mountrath]], and brought up at the monastic school founded there by [[St Fintan]], where also his body was buried. The claim may be spurious, since the ''Félire'' itself accords no such importance to the monastic foundation or its patron saint St Fintan.&lt;ref name="Ó Riain"&gt;{{cite book |title= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|chapter=
Óengus of Tallaght |last= Ó Riain |first= Pádraig|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2004|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40885|accessdate= 27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tallaght==

It is sufficiently clear that Óengus became a [[cleric]], since he describes himself as such in the ''Félire'' using the more humble appellation of "pauper" (''pauperán'' and ''deidblén'' in [[Old Irish]]).&lt;ref name="Ó Riain" /&gt; He was an important member of the [[Tallaght Monastery|community]] founded by St. [[Máel Ruain]] at [[Tallaght]] (now in [[South Dublin]]), in the borderlands of [[Leinster]]. Máel Ruain is described as his mentor (''aite'', also "fosterfather"). There are reasons for believing that Óengus was ordained to the office of bishop, a denomination which is first assigned to him in a list of saints inserted into the ''[[Martyrology of Tallaght]]'' (see below).&lt;ref name="Ó Riain" /&gt; If so, his influence may well have extended to the reformed communities which were associated with Tallaght, many of which were founded in Óengus's lifetime. In fact, two such monasteries in [[Co. Limerick]] and [[Co. Laois]], both of them known as Dísert Óengusa ("Óengus's Hermitage"), bear his memory in name.&lt;ref name="Ó Riain" /&gt;

==Writings==

[[Image:National Library of Ireland MS G10 p24.jpg|thumb|right|Excerpt from the [[Martyrology of Oengus]], presenting the entries for 1 and 2 January in the form of quatrains of four six-syllabic lines for each day. In this 16th-century copy (MS G10 at the [[National Library of Ireland]]) we find pairs of two six-syllabic lines combined into bold lines, amended by glosses and notes that were added by later authors.]]

===''Félire Óengusso''===
{{anchor|Félire Óengusso}}&lt;!-- [[Félire Óengusso]], [[Martyrology of Óengus]], and [[Martyrology of Oengus]] redirect here --&gt;
The literary effort most commonly attributed to Óengus is the [[Old Irish]] work known as ''Félire Óengusso'' ("Martyrology of Óengus"), which is the earliest metrical [[martyrology]] — a register of saints and their feast days – to have been written in the vernacular. The work survives in at least ten manuscripts, the earliest being [[Leabhar Breac]] of the early 15th century.

The martyrology proper consists of 365 quatrains, one for each day of the year, and is framed between a lengthy prologue and epilogue. Later scribes added a prose preface, including material on Óengus, and accompanied the text with abundant glosses and scholia. Óengus's principal source was the ''[[Martyrology of Tallaght]]'', an abbreviated version in prose of the ''[[Martyrologium Hieronymianum]]'', but with a multitude of Irish saints added to their respective feastdays. Other sources are given in the epilogue as an "antigraph of [[Jerome]], the martyrology of [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]" and "Ireland's host of books."&lt;ref&gt;''Félire Óengusso'', lines 137–41. Ó Riain, "Óengus of Tallaght." ''ODNB''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dating the calendar====

The precise date of the original composition has proved difficult to ascertain. The usual method of determining a ''[[terminus post quem]]'' has been to argue from the careers of saints and kings referred to in the text, many of whom remain obscure. The ''[[terminus ante quem]]'' is a different game. In view of the selective nature of the ''Félire'', arguments from silence have little to recommend it, at least in individual cases.&lt;ref&gt;Dumville, "''Félire Óengusso''." 26, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; What would have been instructive, the year of Óengus's death, is unknown, but his education by Máel Ruain (d. 792) must at least mean that he did not outlive the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dumville, "''Félire Óengusso''." 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The one thing that is usually accepted is that it was written no earlier than 797, when one of the rulers described in the prologue as having deceased, [[Donnchad mac Domnaill]], king of Tara, died.&lt;ref&gt;''Donnchad dric ruad rogdae'' "Donnchad the wrathful, ruddy, chosen", ''Félire Óengusso'' 221; Dumville, "''Félire Óengusso''." p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf Thurneysen postulated a date before 808 on grounds that the reference to the death of [[Bran Ardchenn|Bran Ardchenn mac Muiredaig]] (d. probably 795), king of Leinster, should be attributed to political sympathies in the reign of his successor [[Fínsnechta Cethardec|Fínsnechta mac Cellaig]] (d. 808).&lt;ref&gt;Thurneysen, "Die Abfassung des ''Félire'' von Oengus."&lt;/ref&gt;

Ó Riain, however, has rejected the traditional date (797 x 808) in favour of a later range, between 828 and 833, while more recently, Dumville has cast doubt on Ó Riain's conclusions and dating methods. First, Ó Riain argues that such sympathies as Thurneysen refers to are pertinent only to the next kings in the royal line, [[Cellach mac Brain]] (r. 829–834) and [[Conchobar mac Donnchada]] (r. 819–833), sons of Bran and Donnchad respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Riain, "The Tallaght martyrologies redated." pp. 37–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumville objects that this political argument glosses over the probability that while Bran and Donnchad gave way to overlords from rival dynasties, they were nevertheless succeeded by members of their family in their own ''[[tuath]]a'' or ''mórthuatha''. The inclusion of these kings in the prologue therefore offers no good reason to move up the ''terminus ante quem''.&lt;ref&gt;Dumville, "''Félire Óengusso''." 28-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, Ó Riain sees reason to identify the saints Airerán (11 August), Modímóc (10 December) and Flann (14 January) with Airfhinnán (d. 803), abbot of Tallaght, [[Dímmán]] of Araid (d. 811) and [[Flann mac Fairchellaig]] (d. 825), abbot of Lismore. Dumville, however, points out a number of weaknesses and concludes with Stokes "that no saint or other person who certainly died in the ninth century is mentioned."&lt;ref&gt;Dumville, "''Félire Óengusso''." pp. 26, 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Third, having identified a number of saints in the ''Martyrology of Tallaght'', the primary model for the ''Félire'', he proposes obits extending to that of [[St Teimnén]] or St Temnán of Linn Duachaill, who died in 828.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Riain, "The Tallaght martyrologies redated." 26 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In Dumville's view, the evidence is ambiguous, since the relationship of the extant copies of the ''Martyrology of Tallaght'' to the lost original which served as the source for the ''Félire'' is yet unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Dumville, "''Félire Óengusso''." 37-8, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Liam Breatnach has also supported Thurneysen's date.&lt;ref&gt;Breatnach, "Poets and Poetry" in McCone and Simms (eds), ''Progress in medieval Irish studies'' (Maynooth, 1996, pp. 65-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Centres of worldly and spiritual power====

Something of Óengus' view on secular politics appears to come through in his prologue to the ''Félire''. In a number of stanzas, the deserted sites of [[Hill of Tara|Tara]], [[Crúachan]] (also Crúachu) and [[Emain Machae]] are interpreted as the former sites of fortresses in which powerful rulers resided before the coming of Christianity. These pagan seats of power are contrasted with the great ecclesiastical centres of Ireland which were flourishing in Óengus' own time, such as [[Armagh]] and [[Clonmacnoise]].&lt;ref name="Stokes p. 24"&gt;''Félire Óengusso'', ed. Stokes, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian [[T.M. Charles-Edwards]], Óengus was responding to the military domination of overlords of his day, commenting that worldly glory is transient, while spiritual power is enduring. To similar effect, Óengus also holds up the example of Máel Ruain, who continues to offer support and comfort after his death, against that of the contemporary warrior-kings Donnchadh and Bran Ardchenn, whose strong exercise of power meant no such thing after theirs.&lt;ref name="Stokes p. 24"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles-Edwards, ''Early Christian Ireland''. 469-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Martyrology of Tallaght''===

It has been suggested that Óengus was actively involved in the compilation if not the composition of the augmented ''[[Martyrology of Tallaght]]''. This was a work of Northumbrian provenance, probably from [[Lindisfarne]], which first passed through [[Iona]] and [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]], where Irish scribes began to make some additions. The manuscript (now lost) finally arrived in Tallaght, where it received the majority of its Irish additions.&lt;ref name="Ó Riain" /&gt; It was written by someone of Óengus's learning and literary skill at Tallaght and there are strong indications that this was Óengus himself: first of all, the sources named by Óengus in the epilogue to the ''Félire'' (see above) would make more sense if these were the materials used for the ''Martyrology of Tallaght''; second, a number of saints whom the same epilogue claims to have included are found in the Martyrology of Tallaght, but not in the actual ''Félire''.&lt;ref name="Ó Riain" /&gt;

==Death==

According to the ''Martyrology of Tallaght'', Óengus's feast-day, and hence the date of his death, is 11 March. The poem beginning ''Aíbind suide sund amne'' claims that he died on a Friday in [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|Dísert]] Bethech ("The Birchen Hermitage").&lt;ref&gt;''Aíbind suide sund amne'', stanza 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these have produced a range of possible dates such as 819, 824 and 830, but pending the dates of the martyrologies, no conclusive answer can be offered.&lt;ref&gt;Dumville, "''Félire Óengusso''", p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; His metrical ''Life'' tells that he was buried in his birthplace Clonenagh.&lt;ref&gt;''Aíbind suide sund amne'', stanza 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==

Becoming a [[hermit]], he lived for a time at {{Not a typo|Disert}}-beagh, where, on the banks of the Nore, he is said to have communed with the [[angel]]s. From his love of [[prayer]] and solitude he was named the "[[Culdee]]"; in other words, the ''Ceile Dé'', or "Servant of God." Not satisfied with his hermitage, which was only a mile from Clonenagh, and, therefore, liable to be disturbed by students or wayfarers, Óengus removed to a more solitary abode eight miles distant. This sequestered place, two miles southeast of the present town of Maryborough, was called after him "the Desert of Óengus", or "Dysert-Enos". Here he erected a little oratory on a gentle eminence among the Dysert Hills, now represented by a [[Ruins|ruined]] and deserted Protestant church.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|work=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=St. Aengus (the Culdee)|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01173a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His earliest biographer in the ninth century&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; relates the wonderful austerities practised by St. Óengus in his "desert", and though he sought to be far from the haunts of men, his fame attracted a stream of visitors. The result was that the good saint abandoned his oratory at Dysert-Enos, and, after some wanderings, came to the [[monastery of Tallaght]], near [[Dublin]], then governed by [[St. Maelruain]]. He entered as a [[lay brother]], concealing his identity, but St. Maelruain soon discovered him and collaborated with him on the Martyrology of Tallaght.
