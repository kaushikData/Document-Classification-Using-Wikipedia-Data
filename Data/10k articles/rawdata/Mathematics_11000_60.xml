'''17''' ('''seventeen''') is the [[natural number]] following [[16 (number)|16]] and preceding [[18 (number)|18]]. It is a [[prime number]].

In English speech, the numbers 17 and 70 are sometimes confused, as they sound very similar.

The number 17 has wide significance in pure [[mathematics]], as well as in [[applied sciences]], law, music, religion, sports, and other [[Popular culture|cultural phenomena]]. Seventeen is the sum of the first four prime numbers.

== In mathematics ==
Seventeen is the seventh [[prime number]]. The next prime is [[19 (number)|nineteen]], with which it forms a [[twin prime]].

Seventeen is a [[permutable prime]] and a [[supersingular prime (moonshine theory)|supersingular prime]].

Seventeen is the third [[Fermat prime]], as it is of the form 2{{sup|2{{sup|''n''}}}} + 1, specifically with ''n'' = 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A019434|title=Sloane's A019434 : Fermat primes|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 17 is a Fermat prime, regular [[heptadecagon]]s can be [[constructible polygon|constructed]] with a [[compass]] and unmarked ruler. This was proven by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].&lt;ref&gt;John H. Conway and Richard K. Guy, ''The Book of Numbers''. New York: Copernicus (1996): 11. "Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) showed that two regular "heptadecagons" (17-sided polygons) could be constructed with ruler and compasses."&lt;/ref&gt;

There are exactly 17 two-dimensional space (plane symmetry) [[group (mathematics)|groups]]. These are sometimes called [[wallpaper group]]s, as they represent the seventeen possible symmetry types that can be used for [[wallpaper]].

Like [[41 (number)|41]], the number 17 is a prime that yields primes in the [[polynomial]] ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p'', for all positive ''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.

Either 16 or 18 [[unit square]]s can be formed into rectangles with perimeter equal to the area; and there are no other [[natural number]]s with this property. The [[Platonist]]s regarded this as a sign of their peculiar propriety; and [[Plutarch]] notes it when writing that the [[Pythagoreans]] "utterly abominate" 17, which "bars them off from each other and disjoins them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Babbitt|first=Frank Cole|title=Plutarch's Moralia|publisher=Loeb|year=1936|volume=V|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/C.html#42|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventeen is the minimum possible number of givens for a [[sudoku]] puzzle with a unique solution. This was long conjectured, and was proved in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=McGuire|first=Gary|title=There is no 16-Clue Sudoku: Solving the Sudoku Minimum Number of Clues Problem|eprint=1201.0749|class=cs.DS|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs inline|date=June 2018}}

There are 17 orthogonal curvilinear [[coordinate systems]] (to within a conformal symmetry) in which the three-variable [[Laplace equation]] can be solved using the [[separation of variables]] technique.

Seventeen is the sixth [[Mersenne prime]] exponent, yielding 131071.

Seventeen is the first number that can be written as the sum of a positive cube and a positive square in two different ways; that is, the smallest ''n'' such that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''n'' has two different solutions for ''x'' and ''y'' positive integers. The next such number is&amp;nbsp;[[65 (number)|65]].

Seventeen is the minimum number of vertices on a graph such that, if the edges are coloured with three different colours, there is bound to be a monochromatic triangle. (See [[Ramsey's theorem#A multicolour example: R.283.2C3.2C3.29 .3D 17|Ramsey's theorem]].)

Seventeen is the only prime number which is the sum of four consecutive primes (2,3,5,7). Any other four consecutive primes summed would always produce an even number, thereby divisible by 2 and so not prime.

===Religion===
* According to [[Leon Kass]], 17 has some significant meaning (as yet not known exactly) in the book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [[patriarch]] [[Jacob]] lived 17 years after his son [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] went missing and presumed dead, and lived 17 years after their reunion in Egypt, and the lifespans of [[Abraham]] aged 175, [[Isaac]] aged 180, and Jacob aged 147 are not a coincidence. "(The sum of the factors in all three cases is 17; of what possible significance this is, I have no idea.)" [[Leon Kass]], ''The beginning of wisdom: reading Genesis'',(Simon and Schuster, 2003), {{ISBN|978-0-7432-4299-8}},  p. 413 n. 10 (citing Genesis 47:28), quote from p. 629 n. 18, found at [https://books.google.com/books?id=IrgnCCtRKKoC&amp;pg=PA413&amp;lpg=PA413&amp;dq=:leon+Kass%22+%2B+%22beginning+of+wisdom%22+%2B+%2217+years%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GsUYzo0y1c&amp;sig=UeDLKEC5iOoBtDfqi0bNykbYWfQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XDE5Sq_vI4-aMrKPzIoN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#PPA413,M1 Google Books]. Retrieved June 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to [[Plutarch]]'s [[Moralia]], the Egyptians have a legend that the end of Osiris' life came on the seventeenth of a month, on which day it is quite evident to the eye that the period of the full moon is over.  Now, because of this, the Pythagoreans call this day "the Barrier," and utterly abominate this number. For the number seventeen, coming in between the square sixteen and the oblong rectangle eighteen, which, as it happens, are the only plane figures that have their perimeters equal their areas, bars them off from each other and disjoins them, and breaks up the [[epogdoon]] by its division into unequal intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/C.html|author=Plutarch, Moralia|title=Isis and Osiris (Part 3 of 5)|publisher= Loeb Classical Library edition|date=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Larry Ellison]]'s victorious 2013 [[Americas Cup]] Oracle racing yacht bears the name "17"

==In other fields==
'''Seventeen''' is:

* Described at [[MIT]] as 'the least random number', according to the [[Jargon File]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/R/random-numbers.html|title=random numbers|website=catb.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supposedly because in a study where respondents were asked to choose a random number from 1 to 20, 17 was the most common choice.
** This study has been repeated a number of times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/01/30/the-power-of-17/|title=The Power of 17|work=Cosmic Variance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In [[Italian culture]], the number 17 is considered unlucky. When viewed as the Roman numeral, XVII, it is then changed anagrammatically to VIXI, which in the [[Latin language]] translates to "I lived", the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] implying "My life is over." (c.f. "''Vixerunt''", [[Cicero]]'s famous announcement of an execution.) [[Renault]] sold its "[[Renault 15/17|R17]]" model in Italy as "R177."

'''''A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits''''' is the title of a [[master's thesis]] written by [[computer science]] pioneer [[Claude Elwood Shannon|Claude E. Shannon]] while attending the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1937.  In his thesis, Shannon, a dual degree graduate of the [[University of Michigan]], proved that [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Then he showed that his calculus was equivalent to certain elementary parts of the calculus of propositions, which in turn was derived from the algebra of logic developed by George Boole.
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; could be used to simplify the arrangement of the [[relays]] that were the building blocks of the electromechanical [[automatic telephone exchange]]s of the day.  Shannon went on to prove that it should also be possible to use arrangements of relays to solve Boolean algebra problems.

The utilization of the [[wikt:binary|binary]] properties of electrical switches to perform logic functions is the basic concept that underlies all [[digital computer|electronic digital computer]] designs.  Shannon's thesis became the foundation of practical [[digital circuit]] design when it became widely known among the [[electrical engineering]] community during and after [[World War II]].  At the time, the methods employed to design logic circuits were ''[[ad hoc]]'' in nature and lacked the theoretical discipline that Shannon's paper supplied to later projects.

Psychologist [[Howard Gardner]] described Shannon's thesis as "possibly the most important, and also the most famous, master's thesis of the century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mind's New Science: A History of the Cognitive Revolution |first=Howard |last=Gardner |authorlink=Howard Gardner |publisher=Basic Books |year=1987 |isbn=0-465-04635-5 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A version of the paper was published in the 1938 issue of the ''[[Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2658">In [[mathematics]], especially [[algebraic geometry]], the '''Bass conjecture''' says that certain [[algebraic K-theory|algebraic ''K''-groups]] are supposed to be finitely generated. The conjecture was proposed by [[Hyman Bass]].

==Statement of the conjecture==
Any of the following equivalent statements is referred to as the Bass conjecture.
* For any [[finitely generated algebra|finitely generated]] '''Z'''-algebra ''A'', the groups ''K&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') are [[finitely generated abelian group|finitely generated]] (''K''-theory of finitely generated ''A''-modules, also known as G-theory of ''A'') for all ''n'' ≥ 0.
* For any finitely generated '''Z'''-algebra ''A'', that is a [[regular ring]], the groups ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') are finitely generated (''K''-theory of finitely generated locally free ''A''-modules).
* For any [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] ''X'' of [[morphism of finite type|finite type]] over [[spectrum of a ring|Spec]]('''Z'''), ''K&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') is finitely generated.
* For any regular scheme ''X'' of finite type over '''Z''', ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') is finitely generated.

The equivalence of these statements follows from the agreement of ''K''- and ''K&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''-theory for regular rings and the localization sequence for ''K&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''-theory.

==Known cases==
[[Daniel Quillen]] showed that the Bass conjecture holds for all (regular, depending on the version of the conjecture) rings or schemes of dimension ≤ 1, i.e., [[algebraic curves]] over [[finite field]]s and the spectrum of the [[ring of integers]] in a [[number field]].

The (non-regular) ring ''A'' = '''Z'''[x, y]/x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has an infinitely generated ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'').

==Implications==
The Bass conjecture is known to imply the [[Beilinson&amp;ndash;Soulé vanishing conjecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Kahn | first1=Bruno | editor1-last=Friedlander | editor1-first=Eric | editor2-last=Grayson | editor2-first=Daniel | title=Handbook of Algebraic K-theory | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | doi=10.1007/3-540-27855-9_9 | year=2005 | chapter=Algebraic ''K''-theory, algebraic cycles and arithmetic geometry | pages=351–428}}, Theorem 39&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2294">'''Christian Heinrich von Nagel''' (28 February 1803 in [[Stuttgart]], Germany &amp;ndash; 27 October 1882 in [[Ulm]], Germany) was a German [[geometer]].

After attending the gymnasium, Nagel went in 1817 to [[Evangelical Seminaries of Maulbronn and Blaubeuren]]. From 1821 to 1825, he took a four-year course of theology at the [[Tübinger Stift]]. Soon after his graduation, he became interested in mathematics. He became mathematics and science teacher at the Lyceum and at the Secondary school in [[Tübingen]]. Already in 1826, he earned doctorate at the local Faculty of Philosophy on a theme ''De triangulis rectangulis ex algebraica aequatione construendis'' (About right triangles construable from an algebraic equation). Until 1830, he held post of a private lecturer in Tübingen. In that year, he moved to [[Ulm]] where he had a better-paid job as a teacher at the Gymnasium in Ulm. Later he was rector of the affiliated Realschule. He was ennobled in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eddy R.

His best known results are from [[triangle]] geometry. One of the notable triangle points, [[Nagel point]], is named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2220">In [[differential topology]], given a family of [[Morse homology|Morse-Smale functions]] on a [[smooth manifold]] ''X'' parameterized by a [[closed interval]] ''I'', one can construct a [[Morse-Smale]] [[vector field]] on ''X'' &amp;times; ''I'' whose [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s occur only on the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]].  The Morse differential defines a [[chain complex|chain map]] from the [[Morse homology|Morse complex]]es at the boundaries of the family, the '''continuation map'''.  This can be shown to descend to an [[isomorphism]] on [[Morse homology]], proving its  invariance of Morse homology of a smooth manifold.  

Continuation maps were defined by [[Andreas Floer]] to prove the invariance of [[Floer homology]] in infinite dimensional analogues of the situation described above; in the case of finite-dimensional Morse theory, invariance may be proved by proving that Morse homology is isomorphic to [[singular homology]], which is known to be invariant.  However, Floer homology is not always isomorphic to a familiar invariant, so continuation maps yield an a priori proof of invariance. 

In finite-dimensional Morse theory, different choices made in constructing the vector field on ''X'' &amp;times; ''I'' yield distinct but [[chain homotopy|chain homotopic]] maps and thus descend to the same isomorphism on homology.  However, in certain infinite dimensional cases, this does not hold, and these techniques may be used to produce invariants of one-parameter families of objects (such as [[contact structure]]s or [[Legendrian knots]]).

In [[linear algebra]], a '''coordinate vector''' is a representation of a vector as an ordered list of numbers that describes the vector in terms of a particular [[ordered basis]]. Coordinates are always specified relative to an ordered basis. Bases and their associated coordinate representations let one realize [[vector space]]s and [[linear transformation]]s concretely as [[column vector]]s, [[row vector]]s, and [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], hence are useful in calculations.

The idea of a coordinate vector can also be used for infinite-dimensional vector spaces, as addressed below.

== Definition ==
Let ''V'' be a [[vector space]] of [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]] ''n'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'' and let 
:&lt;math&gt; B = \{ b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n \} &lt;/math&gt;
be an [[ordered basis]] for ''V''.
Then for every &lt;math&gt; v \in V &lt;/math&gt; there is a unique [[linear combination]] of the basis vectors that equals ''v'':
:&lt;math&gt; v = \alpha _1 b_1 + \alpha _2 b_2 + \cdots + \alpha _n b_n .&lt;/math&gt;
The '''coordinate vector''' of ''v'' relative to ''B'' is the [[sequence]] of [[coordinates]]
:&lt;math&gt; [v]_B = (\alpha _1, \alpha _2, \cdots, \alpha _n) .&lt;/math&gt;
This is also called the ''representation of v with respect of B'', or the ''B representation of v''. The α-s are called the ''coordinates of v''. The order of the basis becomes important here, since it determines the order in which the coefficients are listed in the coordinate vector.

Coordinate vectors of finite-dimensional vector spaces can be represented by [[matrix_(mathematics)|matrices]] as [[column vector|column]] or [[row vector]]s. In the above notation, one can write
:&lt;math&gt; [v]_B = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha_1 \\ \vdots \\ \alpha_n \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;[v]_B = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha_1 &amp; \alpha_2 &amp; \dots &amp; \alpha_n \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

== The standard representation ==
We can mechanize the above transformation by defining a function &lt;math&gt;\phi_B&lt;/math&gt;, called the ''standard representation of V with respect to B'', that takes every vector to its coordinate representation: &lt;math&gt;\phi_B(v)=[v]_B&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\phi_B&lt;/math&gt; is a linear transformation from ''V'' to ''F''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. In fact, it is an [[isomorphism]], and its [[inverse function|inverse]] &lt;math&gt;\phi_B^{-1}:F^n\to V&lt;/math&gt; is simply
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_B^{-1}(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n)=\alpha_1 b_1+\cdots+\alpha_n b_n.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, we could have defined &lt;math&gt;\phi_B^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to be the above function from the beginning, realized that &lt;math&gt;\phi_B^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism, and defined &lt;math&gt;\phi_B&lt;/math&gt; to be its inverse.

==Examples==
=== Example 1 ===
Let P3 be the space of all the algebraic [[polynomials]] in degree at most 3 (i.e. the highest exponent of ''x'' can be 3). This space is linear and spanned by the following polynomials:
:&lt;math&gt;B_P = \left\{  1,  x,  x^2,  x^3 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

matching
:&lt;math&gt;
    1 := \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} ; \quad
    x := \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} ; \quad
  x^2 := \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} ; \quad
  x^3 := \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

then the coordinate vector corresponding to the polynomial
:&lt;math&gt;p \left( x \right) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3&lt;/math&gt;

is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} a_0 \\ a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

According to that representation, the [[differentiation operator]] d/dx which we shall mark D will be represented by the following [[matrix (math)|matrix]]:
:&lt;math&gt;Dp(x) = P'(x) ; \quad [D] = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 3 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
  \end{bmatrix} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Using that method it is easy to explore the properties of the operator: such as [[invertible matrix|invertibility]], [[hermitian|hermitian or anti-hermitian or none]], spectrum and [[eigenvalues]] and more.

=== Example 2 ===
The [[Pauli matrices]] which represent the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] operator when transforming the spin [[eigenstate]]s into vector coordinates.

== Basis transformation matrix ==
Let ''B'' and ''C'' be two different bases of a vector space ''V'', and let us mark with &lt;math&gt;\lbrack M \rbrack_C^B&lt;/math&gt; the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] which has columns consisting of the ''C'' representation of basis vectors ''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,  b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'': 
:&lt;math&gt;\lbrack M\rbrack_C^B = \begin{bmatrix} \lbrack b_1\rbrack_C &amp; \cdots &amp; \lbrack b_n\rbrack_C \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

This matrix is referred to as the '''basis transformation matrix''' from ''B'' to ''C''. It can be regarded as an [[automorphism]] over ''V''.  Any vector ''v'' represented in ''B'' can be transformed to a representation in ''C'' as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\lbrack v\rbrack_C = \lbrack M\rbrack_C^B \lbrack v\rbrack_B. &lt;/math&gt; 

If ''E'' is the [[standard basis]], the notation can be simplified by omitting it, with the transformation from ''B'' to ''E'' being represented:
:&lt;math&gt;v = \lbrack M\rbrack^B \lbrack v\rbrack_B. \,&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                   v &amp;= \lbrack v\rbrack_E, \\
  \lbrack M\rbrack^B &amp;= \lbrack M\rbrack_E^B.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Under the transformation of basis, notice that the superscript on the transformation matrix, ''M'', and the subscript on the coordinate vector, ''v'', are the same, and seemingly cancel, leaving the remaining subscript. While this may serve as a memory aid, it is important to note that no such cancellation, or similar mathematical operation, is taking place.

===Corollary===
The matrix ''M'' is an [[invertible matrix]] and ''M&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the basis transformation matrix from ''C'' to ''B''. In other words,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      &amp;\operatorname{Id} \\[3pt]
  ={} &amp;\lbrack M\rbrack_C^B \lbrack M\rbrack_B^C = \lbrack M\rbrack_C^C \\[3pt]
  ={} &amp;\lbrack M\rbrack_B^C \lbrack M\rbrack_C^B = \lbrack M\rbrack_B^B
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Infinite-dimensional vector spaces==

Suppose ''V'' is an infinite-dimensional vector space over a field ''F''. If the dimension is κ, then there is some basis of κ elements for ''V''. After an order is chosen, the basis can be considered an ordered basis. The elements of ''V'' are finite linear combinations of elements in the basis, which give rise to unique coordinate representations exactly as described before. The only change is that the indexing set for the coordinates is not finite. Since a given vector ''v'' is a ''finite'' linear combination of basis elements, the only nonzero entries of the coordinate vector for ''v'' will be the nonzero coefficients of the linear combination representing ''v''. Thus the coordinate vector for ''v'' is zero except in finitely many entries.

The linear transformations between (possibly) infinite-dimensional vector spaces can be modeled, analogously to the finite-dimensional case, with [[Infinite_matrix#Infinite_matrices|infinite matrices]]. The special case of the transformations from ''V'' into ''V'' is described in the [[full linear ring]] article.

[[File:Cube-root function.svg|thumb|288x288px|Plot of ''y'' = {{radic|''x''|3}}. The plot is symmetric with respect to origin, as it is an [[odd function]]. At ''x'' = 0 this graph has a [[vertical tangent]].]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''cube root''' of a number ''x'' is a number ''y'' such that ''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''.  All [[real number]]s (except zero) have exactly one real cube root and a pair of [[complex conjugate]] cube roots, and all nonzero [[complex number]]s have three distinct complex cube roots.  For example, the real cube root of 8, denoted {{radic|8|3}}, is 2, because 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8, while the other cube roots of 8 are −1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{sqrt|3}}''i'' and −1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;{{sqrt|3}}''i''. The three cube roots of −27''i'' are  
:&lt;math&gt;3i, \quad \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}-\frac{3}{2}i, \quad  \text{and} \quad -\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}-\frac{3}{2}i.  &lt;/math&gt;

The cube root operation is not [[distributivity|distributive]] with [[addition]] or [[subtraction]].

In some contexts, particularly when the number whose cube root is to be taken is a real number, one of the cube roots (in this particular case the real one) is referred to as the ''principal cube root'', denoted with the radical sign {{radic||3}}. The cube root operation is associative with [[exponentiation]] and distributive with [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] if considering only real numbers, but not always if considering complex numbers: for example, the cube of any cube root of 8 is 8, but the three cube roots of 8{{sup|3}} are 8, −4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4''i''{{sqrt|3}}, and −4&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;4''i''{{sqrt|3}}.

==Formal definition==
The cube roots of a number ''x'' are the numbers ''y'' which satisfy the equation

:&lt;math&gt;y^3 = x.\ &lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==

===Real numbers===
For any real number ''x'', there is ''one'' real number ''y'' such that ''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''. The cube function is increasing, so does not give the same result for two different inputs, plus it covers all real numbers. In other words, it is a bijection, or one-to-one. Then we can define an inverse function that is also one-to-one. For real numbers, we can define a unique cube root of all real numbers. If this definition is used, the cube root of a negative number is a negative number.

[[Image:3rd roots of unity.svg|thumb|right|The three cube roots of 1]]
If ''x'' and ''y'' are allowed to be [[complex number|complex]], then there are three solutions (if ''x'' is non-zero) and so ''x'' has three cube roots. A real number has one real cube root and two further cube roots which form a [[complex conjugate]] pair. For instance, the cube roots of [[1]] are:

:&lt;math&gt; 1, \quad -\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i, \quad -\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i. &lt;/math&gt;

The last two of these roots lead to a relationship between all roots of any real or complex number. If a number is one cube root of a particular real or complex number, the other two cube roots can be found by multiplying that cube root by one or the other of the two complex cube roots of 1.

===Complex numbers===
[[Image:Complex cube root.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Plot of the complex cube root together with its two additional leaves. The first image shows the main branch, which is described in the text.]]
[[Image:Riemann surface cube root.svg|right|thumb|200px|[[Riemann surface]] of the cube root. One can see how all three leaves fit together.]]

For complex numbers, the principal cube root is usually defined as the cube root that has the greatest [[real part]], or, equivalently, the cube root whose [[argument (complex analysis)|argument]] has the least [[absolute value]]. It is related to the principal value of the [[natural logarithm]] by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;x^{\frac13} = \exp \left( \frac13 \ln{x} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

If we write ''x'' as

:&lt;math&gt;x = r \exp(i \theta)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is a non-negative real number and ''θ'' lies in the range

:&lt;math&gt;-\pi &lt; \theta \le \pi&lt;/math&gt;,

then the principal complex cube root is

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{x} = \sqrt[3]{r}\exp \left(\frac {i\theta}{3} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

This means that in [[polar coordinates]], we are taking the cube root of the radius and dividing the polar angle by three in order to define a cube root. With this definition, the principal cube root of a negative number is a complex number, and for instance {{radic|−8|3}} will not be −2, but rather {{nowrap|1 + ''i''{{sqrt|3}}}}.

This difficulty can also be solved by considering the cube root as a [[multivalued function]]: if we write the original complex number ''x'' in three equivalent forms, namely

:&lt;math&gt;x = \begin{cases} r \exp (i \theta ), \\[3px] r \exp (i \theta + 2i\pi ),  \\[3px] r \exp ( i \theta - 2i\pi ). \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

{{visualisation_complex_number_roots.svg}}
The principal complex cube roots of these three forms are then respectively

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{x} = \begin{cases} 
\sqrt[3]{r}\exp \left( \frac{i\theta}{3}\right), 
\\ \sqrt[3]{r}\exp \left(\frac{i\theta}{3} + \frac{2i \pi}{3}  \right), 
\\ \sqrt[3]{r}\exp \left(\frac{i\theta}{3} - \frac{2i \pi}{3} \right). \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

Unless {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 0}}, these three complex numbers are distinct, even though the three representations of ''x'' were equivalent. For example, {{radic|−8|3}} may then be calculated to be −2, {{nowrap|1 + ''i''{{sqrt|3}}}}, or {{nowrap|1 − ''i''{{sqrt|3}}}}.

This is related with the concept of [[monodromy]]: if one follows by [[continuous function|continuity]] the function ''cube root'' along a closed path around zero, after a turn the value of the cube root is multiplied (or divided) by &lt;math&gt;e^{2i\pi/3}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Impossibility of compass-and-straightedge construction==

Cube roots arise in the problem of finding an angle whose measure is one third that of a given angle ([[angle trisection]]) and in the problem of finding the edge of a cube whose volume is twice that of a cube with a given edge ([[doubling the cube]]). In 1837 [[Pierre Wantzel]] proved that neither of these can be done with a [[compass-and-straightedge construction]].

==Numerical methods==
[[Newton's method]] is an [[iterative method]] that can be used to calculate the cube root.  For real [[floating-point]] numbers this method reduces to the following iterative algorithm to produce successively better approximations of the cube root of ''a'':

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{3} \left(\frac{a}{x_n^2} + 2x_n\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The method is simply averaging three factors chosen such that
:&lt;math&gt; x_n \times x_n \times \frac{a}{x_n^2}=a &lt;/math&gt;
at each iteration.

[[Halley's method]] improves upon this with an algorithm that converges more quickly with each step, albeit consuming more multiplication operations:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = x_n \left(\frac{x_n^3 + 2a}{2x_n^3 + a}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

With either method a poor initial approximation of ''x''{{sub|0}} can give very poor algorithm performance, and coming up with a good initial approximation is somewhat of a black art. Some implementations manipulate the exponent bits of the floating-point number; i.e. they arrive at an
initial approximation by dividing the exponent by 3.

==Appearance in solutions of third and fourth degree equations==

[[Cubic equation]]s, which are [[polynomial equation]]s of the third degree (meaning the highest power of the unknown is 3) can always be solved for their three solutions in terms of cube roots and square roots (although simpler expressions only in terms of square roots exist for all three solutions, if at least one of them is a [[rational number]]). If two of the solutions are complex numbers, then all three solution expressions involve the real cube root of a real number, while if all three solutions are real numbers then they may be expressed in terms of the [[Casus irreducibilis|complex cube root of a complex number]]. 

[[Quartic equation]]s can also be solved in terms of cube roots and square roots.

==History==

The calculation of cube roots can be to traced back to [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian mathematicians]] from as early as 1800 BCE.&lt;ref name="cbgr"&gt;{{cite book|last=Saggs|first=H. W. F.|title=Civilization Before Greece and Rome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R28oab-7jLcC&amp;pg=PA227|year=1989|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-05031-8|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth century BCE [[Plato]] posed the problem of [[doubling the cube#History|doubling the cube]], which required a [[compass-and-straightedge construction]] of the edge of a [[cube (geometry)|cube]] with twice the volume of a given cube; this required the construction, now known to be impossible, of  the length {{radic|2|3}}.

A method for extracting cube roots appears in ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'', a [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese mathematical]] text compiled around the 2nd century BCE and commented on by [[Liu Hui]] in the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref name="oxf"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crossley|first=John|last2=W.-C.

[[File:Petersen double cover.svg|thumb|250px|A cycle double cover of the [[Petersen graph]], corresponding to its embedding on the [[projective plane]] as a [[hemi-dodecahedron]].]]
In [[graph theory|graph-theoretic]] mathematics, a '''cycle double cover''' is a collection of [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]] in an [[undirected graph]] that together include each edge of the graph exactly twice. For instance, for any [[polyhedral graph]], the faces of a [[convex polyhedron]] that represents the graph provide a double cover of the graph: each edge belongs to exactly two faces.

It is an unsolved problem, posed by  [[George Szekeres]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Szekeres|1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Seymour (mathematician)|Paul Seymour]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Seymour|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and known as the '''cycle double cover conjecture''', whether every [[bridgeless graph]] has a cycle double cover. The conjecture can equivalently be formulated in terms of [[graph embedding]]s, and in that context is also known as the '''circular embedding conjecture'''.

==Formulation==
The usual formulation of the cycle double cover conjecture asks whether every [[Bridge (graph theory)|bridgeless]] [[undirected graph]] has a collection of [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]] such that each edge of the graph is contained in exactly two of the cycles. The requirement that the graph be bridgeless is an obvious necessary condition for such a set of cycles to exist, because a bridge cannot belong to any cycle. A collection of cycles satisfying the condition of the cycle double cover conjecture is called a '''cycle double cover'''. Some graphs such as [[cycle graph]]s and bridgeless [[cactus graph]]s can only be covered by using the same cycle more than once, so this sort of duplication is allowed in a cycle double cover.

==Reduction to snarks==
A [[snark (graph theory)|snark]] is a special case of a bridgeless graph, having the additional properties that every vertex has exactly three incident edges (that is, the graph is [[cubic graph|cubic]]) and that it is not possible to partition the edges of the graph into three [[perfect matching]]s (that is, the graph has no 3-[[edge coloring]], and by [[Vizing's theorem]] has [[chromatic index]] 4). It turns out that snarks form the only difficult case of the cycle double cover conjecture: if the conjecture is true for snarks, it is true for any graph.&lt;ref name="Jaeger"&gt;{{harvtxt|Jaeger|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Jaeger|1985}} observes that, in any potential minimal counterexample to the cycle double cover conjecture, all vertices must have three or more incident edges. For, a vertex with only one edge incident forms a bridge, while if two edges are incident on a vertex, one can contract them to form a smaller graph such that any double cover of the smaller graph extends to one of the original graph. On the other hand, if a vertex ''v'' has four or more incident edges, one may “split off” two of those edges by removing them from the graph and replacing them by a single edge connecting their two other endpoints, while preserving the bridgelessness of the resulting graph. Again, a double cover of the resulting graph may be extended in a straightforward way to a double cover of the original graph: every cycle of the split off graph corresponds either to a cycle of the original graph, or to a pair of cycles meeting at ''v''. Thus, every minimal counterexample must be cubic. But if a cubic graph can have its edges 3-colored (say with the colors red, blue, and green), then the subgraph of red and blue edges, the subgraph of blue and green edges, and the subgraph of red and green edges each form a collection of disjoint cycles that together cover all edges of the graph twice. Therefore, every minimal counterexample must be a non-3-edge-colorable bridgeless cubic graph, that is, a snark.&lt;ref name="Jaeger" /&gt;

==Reducible configurations==
One possible attack on the cycle double cover problem would be to show that there cannot exist a minimum counterexample, by proving that any graph contains a ''reducible configuration'', a subgraph that can be replaced by a smaller subgraph in a way that would preserve the existence or nonexistence of a cycle double cover. For instance, if a cubic graph contains a triangle, a [[Y-Δ transform|Δ-Y transform]] will replace the triangle by a single vertex; any cycle double cover of the smaller graph can be extended back to a cycle double cover of the original cubic graph. Therefore, a minimal counterexample to the cycle double cover conjecture must be a [[triangle-free graph]], ruling out some snarks such as [[Tietze's graph]] which contain triangles. Through computer searches, it is known that every cycle of length 11 or less in a cubic graph forms a reducible configuration, and therefore that any minimal counterexample to the cycle double cover conjecture must have [[girth (graph theory)|girth]] at least 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Huck|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, it is not possible to prove the cycle double cover conjecture using a finite set of reducible configurations. Every reducible configuration contains a cycle, so for every finite set ''S'' of reducible configurations there is a number γ such that all configurations in the set contain a cycle of length at most γ. However, there exist snarks with arbitrarily high girth, that is, with arbitrarily high bounds on the length of their shortest cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kochol|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A snark ''G'' with girth greater than γ cannot contain any of the configurations in the set ''S'', so the reductions in ''S'' are not strong enough to rule out the possibility that ''G'' might be a minimal counterexample.

==Circular embedding conjecture==
If a graph has a cycle double cover, the cycles of the cover can be used to form the 2-cells of a [[graph embedding]] onto a two-dimensional [[cell complex]]. In the case of a cubic graph, this complex always forms a [[manifold]]. The graph is said to be ''circularly embedded'' onto the manifold, in that every face of the embedding is a simple cycle in the graph. However, a cycle double cover of a graph with degree greater than three may not correspond to an embedding on a manifold: the cell complex formed by the cycles of the cover may have non-manifold topology at its vertices. The '''circular embedding conjecture''' or '''strong embedding conjecture'''&lt;ref name="Jaeger"/&gt; states that every [[biconnected graph]] has a circular embedding onto a manifold. If so, the graph also has a cycle double cover, formed by the faces of the embedding.

For cubic graphs, biconnectivity and bridgelessness are equivalent. Therefore, the circular embedding conjecture is clearly at least as strong as the cycle double cover conjecture. However, it turns out to be no stronger. If the vertices of a graph ''G'' are expanded to form a cubic graph, which is then circularly embedded, and  the expansions are undone by contracting the added edges, the result will be a circular embedding of ''G'' itself. Therefore, if the cycle double cover conjecture is true, every biconnected graph has a circular embedding. That is, the cycle double cover conjecture is equivalent to the circular embedding conjecture, even though a cycle double cover and a circular embedding are not always the same thing.&lt;ref name="Jaeger"/&gt;

If a circular embedding exists, it might not be on a surface of minimal genus: Nguyen Huy Xuong described a biconnected [[toroidal graph]] none of whose circular embeddings lie on a torus.&lt;ref name="Jaeger"/&gt;

==Stronger conjectures and related problems==
A stronger version of the circular embedding conjecture that has also been considered is the conjecture that every biconnected graph has a circular embedding on an [[orientability|orientable manifold]]. In terms of the cycle double cover conjecture, this is equivalent to the conjecture that there exists a cycle double cover, and an orientation for each of the cycles in the cover, such that for every edge ''e'' the two cycles that cover ''e'' are oriented in opposite directions through ''e''.&lt;ref name="Jaeger"/&gt;

Alternatively, strengthenings of the conjecture that involve [[graph coloring|colorings]] of the cycles in the cover have also been considered. The strongest of these is a conjecture that every bridgeless graph has a circular embedding on an orientable manifold in which the faces can be 5-colored. If true, this would imply a conjecture of [[W. T. Tutte]] that every bridgeless graph has a [[Nowhere-zero flow|nowhere-zero 5-flow]].&lt;ref name="Jaeger"/&gt;

A stronger type of embedding than a circular embedding is a ''polyhedral embedding'', an embedding of a graph on a surface in such a way that every face is a simple cycle and every two faces that intersect do so in either a single vertex or a single edge. (In the case of a cubic graph, this can be simplified to a requirement that every two faces that intersect do so in a single edge.) Thus, in view of the reduction of the cycle double cover conjecture to snarks, it is of interest to investigate polyhedral embeddings of snarks. Unable to find such embeddings, [[Branko Grünbaum]] conjectured that they do not exist, but {{harvs|txt|last=Kochol|year=2009a|year2=2009b}} disproved Grünbaum's conjecture by finding a snark with a polyhedral embedding.

==Biography==
Arnold studied mathematics as an undergraduate at [[Brown University]], gaining his B.A. in 1975. He continued his studies at the [[University of Chicago]], where he received a Ph.D. in 1979. He then moved to work at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. In 1989, he moved to [[Penn State University]] where he occupied a chair until 2002. He became director of the [[Institute for Mathematics and its Applications]] (IMA) in Minnesota in 2001. At the end of his term as director of the IMA, he becomes the McKnight Presidential Professor of Mathematics at the University of Minnesota. He served as president of the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] in 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation | first = Douglas N. | last = Arnold | title = Curriculum vitae | date = April 2, 2009 | url = http://www.ima.umn.edu/~arnold/vita.pdf }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnold's research initially focused on the [[finite element method]] for the solution of problems in [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. This expanded to take other applications into account, like the collision of [[black hole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation | title = Biographical sketch – Douglas N. Arnold | date = February 14, 2009 | url = http://www.ima.umn.edu/~arnold/biosketch.html }}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Especially well known is Arnold's development of the [[finite element exterior calculus]], a discrete version of [[exterior calculus]] that can be used to analyze the [[numerical stability|stability]] of finite element methods. This was the topic of the plenary lecture Arnold gave at the 2002 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]].&lt;ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''equidistribution theorem''' is the statement that the sequence

:''a'', 2''a'', 3''a'', ... mod 1

is [[Equidistributed sequence|uniformly distributed]] on the [[circle]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, when ''a'' is an [[irrational number]].  It is a special case of the [[ergodic theorem]] where one takes the normalized angle measure &lt;math&gt;\mu=\frac{d\theta}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;.

==History==
While this theorem was proved in 1909 and 1910 separately by [[Hermann Weyl]], [[Wacław Sierpiński]] and [[Piers Bohl]], variants of this theorem continue to be studied to this day.

In 1916, Weyl proved that the sequence ''a'', 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''a'', 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''a'', ... mod 1 is uniformly distributed on the unit interval.  In 1935, [[Ivan Vinogradov]] proved that the sequence ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a'' mod 1 is uniformly distributed, where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''n''th [[prime number|prime]].  Vinogradov's proof was a byproduct of the [[odd Goldbach conjecture]], that every sufficiently large odd number is the sum of three primes.

[[George Birkhoff]], in 1931, and [[Aleksandr Khinchin]], in 1933, proved that the generalization ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''na'', for [[almost all]] ''x'',  is equidistributed on any [[Lebesgue measurable]] subset of the unit interval.  The corresponding generalizations for the Weyl and Vinogradov results were proven by [[Jean Bourgain]] in 1988.

Specifically, Khinchin showed that the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n
f( (x+ka) \bmod 1 ) = \int_0^1 f(y)\,dy  &lt;/math&gt;

holds for almost all ''x'' and any Lebesgue integrable function&amp;nbsp;ƒ.  In modern formulations, it is asked under what conditions the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n
f( (x+b_ka) \bmod 1 ) = \int_0^1 f(y)\,dy  &lt;/math&gt;

might hold, given some general [[sequence]] ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.

One noteworthy result is that the sequence 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''a''&amp;nbsp;mod&amp;nbsp;1 is uniformly distributed for almost all, but not all, irrational ''a''. Similarly, for the sequence ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, for every irrational ''a'', and almost all ''x'', there exists a function ƒ for which the sum diverges. In this sense, this sequence is considered to be a '''universally bad averaging sequence''', as opposed to ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k'', which is termed a '''universally good averaging sequence''', because it does not have the latter shortcoming.

A powerful general result is [[Weyl's criterion]], which shows that equidistribution is equivalent to having a non-trivial estimate for the [[exponential sum]]s formed with the sequence as exponents. For the case of  multiples of ''a'', Weyl's criterion reduces the problem to summing finite [[geometric series]].

'''Abramo Giulio Umberto Federigo Enriques''' (5 January 1871 – 14 June 1946) was an [[Italy|Italian]] mathematician, now known principally as the first to give a [[classification of algebraic surfaces]] in [[birational geometry]], and other contributions in [[algebraic geometry]].

==Biography==
Enriques was born in [[Livorno]], and brought up in [[Pisa]], in a [[Sephardi Jew]]ish family of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] descent. He became a student of [[Guido Castelnuovo]], and became an important member of the [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]]. He also worked on [[differential geometry]]. He collaborated with Castelnuovo, [[Corrado Segre]] and [[Francesco Severi]]. He had positions at the [[University of Bologna]], and then the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]]. He lost his position in 1938, when the [[Fascist]] government enacted the "leggi razziali" (racial laws), which in particular banned Jews from holding professorships in Universities.

The Enriques classification, of complex [[algebraic surface]]s up to birational equivalence, was into five main classes, and was background to further work until [[Kunihiko Kodaira]] reconsidered the matter in the 1950s.  The largest class, in some sense, was that of [[surface of general type|surfaces of general type]]: those for which the consideration of [[differential form]]s provides [[linear system]]s that are large enough to make all the geometry visible. The work of the Italian school had provided enough insight to recognise the other main birational classes. [[Rational surface]]s and more generally [[ruled surface]]s (these include [[quadric]]s and [[cubic surface]]s in projective 3-space) have the simplest geometry. [[Quartic surface]]s in 3-spaces are now classified (when [[non-singular]]) as cases of [[K3 surface]]s; the classical approach was to look at the [[Kummer surface]]s, which are singular at 16 points.  [[Abelian surface]]s give rise to Kummer surfaces as quotients. There remains the class of [[elliptic surface]]s, which are [[fiber bundle]]s over a curve with [[elliptic curve]]s as fiber, having a finite number of modifications (so there is a bundle that is [[locally trivial]] actually over a curve less some points). The question of classification is to show that any surface, lying in [[projective space]] of any dimension, is in the birational sense (after [[blowing up]] and [[blowing down]] of some curves, that is) accounted for by the models already mentioned.

No more than other work in the Italian school would the proofs by Enriques now be counted as complete and [[rigorous]]. Not enough was known about some of the technical issues: the geometers worked by a mixture of inspired guesswork and close familiarity with examples. [[Oscar Zariski]] started to work in the 1930s on a more refined theory of birational mappings, incorporating [[commutative algebra]] methods. He also began work on the question of the classification for [[characteristic p]], where new phenomena arise.  The schools of Kunihiko Kodaira and [[Igor Shafarevich]] had put Enriques' work on a sound footing by about 1960.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11140">'''Financial models with long-tailed distributions and volatility clustering''' have been introduced to overcome problems with the realism of classical financial models. These classical models of financial [[time series]] typically assume [[homoskedasticity]] and [[normal distribution|normality]] cannot explain stylized phenomena such as [[skewness]], [[heavy tails]], and [[volatility clustering]] of the empirical asset returns in finance. In 1963, [[Benoît Mandelbrot|Benoit Mandelbrot]] first used the [[Stable distribution|stable (or &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-stable) distribution]] to model the empirical distributions which have the skewness and heavy-tail property. Since &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-stable distributions have infinite &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-th moments for all &lt;math&gt;p&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the tempered stable processes have been proposed for overcoming this limitation of the stable distribution.

On the other hand, [[GARCH]] models have been developed to explain the [[volatility clustering]]. In the GARCH model, the innovation (or residual) distributions are assumed to be a standard normal distribution, despite the fact that this assumption is often rejected empirically. For this reason, GARCH models with non-normal innovation distribution have been developed.

Many financial models with stable and tempered stable distributions together with volatility clustering have been developed and applied to risk management, option pricing, and portfolio selection.

== Infinitely divisible distributions ==

A random variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is called ''[[infinite divisibility (probability)|infinitely divisible]]'' if,
for each &lt;math&gt;n=1,2,\dots&lt;/math&gt;, there are [[independent and identically-distributed random variables]]

: &lt;math&gt;Y_{n,1}, Y_{n,2}, \dots, Y_{n,n} \, &lt;/math&gt;

such that

: &lt;math&gt;Y\stackrel{\mathrm{d}}{=}\sum_{k=1}^n Y_{n,k}, \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\stackrel{\mathrm{d}}{=}&lt;/math&gt; denotes equality in distribution.

A [[Borel measure]] &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is called a [[Levy measure|''Lévy measure'']] if &lt;math&gt;\nu({0})=0&lt;/math&gt; and

: &lt;math&gt;\int_\mathbb{R}(1\wedge|x^2|) \, \nu(dx) &lt; \infty . &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is infinitely divisible, then the [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]]
&lt;math&gt;\phi_Y(u)=E[e^{iuY}]&lt;/math&gt; is given by

: &lt;math&gt;
\phi_Y(u) =\exp \left( i\gamma u- \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 u^2 +
\int_{-\infty}^\infty
(e^{iux}-1-iux1_{|x|\le 1} ) \, \nu(dx) \right),
\sigma\ge0,~~\gamma\in\mathbb{R}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma\ge0&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\gamma\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is a Lévy measure.
Here the triple &lt;math&gt;(\sigma^2, \nu, \gamma)&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''Lévy triplet of'' &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. This triplet is unique.  Conversely, for any choice &lt;math&gt;(\sigma^2, \nu, \gamma)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the conditions above, there exists an infinitely divisible random variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; whose characteristic function is given as &lt;math&gt;\phi_Y&lt;/math&gt;.

== ''&amp;alpha;''-Stable distributions ==
A  real-valued random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to have an
''&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-stable distribution'' if for any &lt;math&gt;n\ge 2&lt;/math&gt;, there
are a positive number &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; and a real number &lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt; such that

: &lt;math&gt;
X_1+ \cdots + X_n \stackrel{\mathrm{d}}{=} C_n X + D_n, \, 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n&lt;/math&gt; are independent and have the same
distribution as that of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. All stable random variables are infinitely divisible. It is known that &lt;math&gt;C_n=n^{1/\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\alpha\le 2&lt;/math&gt;. A stable random
variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with index &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is called an
''&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-stable random variable''.

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be an &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-stable random variable. Then the
characteristic function &lt;math&gt;\phi_X&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is given by

: &lt;math&gt;
\phi_X(u) =
\begin{cases}
\exp\left( i\mu u - \sigma^\alpha |u|^\alpha \left( 1-i\beta
\operatorname{sgn}(u) \tan\left(
 \frac{\pi\alpha}{2}\right)\right)\right)
 &amp; \text{if } \alpha \in(0,1)\cup(1,2) \\
\exp\left(  i\mu u - \sigma |u| \left( 1+i\beta \operatorname{sgn}(u)
\left(
 \frac{2}{\pi}\right)\ln(|u|)\right)\right)
 &amp; \text{if } \alpha = 1 \\
\exp\left( i\mu u - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 u^2\right)
 &amp; \text{if }\alpha = 2
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

for some &lt;math&gt;\mu\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta\in[-1,1]&lt;/math&gt;.

== Tempered stable distributions==

An infinitely divisible distribution is called a ''classical tempered
stable (CTS) distribution'' with parameter
&lt;math&gt;(C_1,C_2,\lambda_+,\lambda_-,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;,
if its Lévy triplet &lt;math&gt;(\sigma^2, \nu, \gamma)&lt;/math&gt; is given by
&lt;math&gt;\sigma=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;\nu(dx) = \left( \frac{C_1e^{-\lambda_+x}}{x^{1+\alpha}}1_{x&gt;0} +
\frac{C_2e^{-\lambda_-|x|}}{|x|^{1+\alpha}}1_{x&lt;0}\right) \, dx,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C_1, C_2, \lambda_+, \lambda_-&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;2&lt;/math&gt;.

This distribution was first introduced by under
the name of ''Truncated Lévy Flights''&lt;ref name=sb5/&gt; and has been called the ''tempered stable'' or the ''KoBoL'' distribution.&lt;ref name=sb1/&gt; In particular, if
&lt;math&gt;C_1=C_2=C&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then this distribution is called the CGMY
distribution which has been used for
financial modeling.&lt;ref name=sb2/&gt;

The characteristic function &lt;math&gt;\phi_{CTS}&lt;/math&gt; for a tempered stable
distribution is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\phi_{CTS}(u) = \exp\left( iu\mu
+C_1\Gamma(-\alpha)((\lambda_+-iu)^\alpha-\lambda_+^\alpha)
+C_2\Gamma(-\alpha)((\lambda_-+iu)^\alpha-\lambda_-^\alpha)
\right),&lt;/math&gt;

for some &lt;math&gt;\mu\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;\phi_{CTS}&lt;/math&gt; can be extended to the
region &lt;math&gt;\{z\in\mathbb{C}: \operatorname{Im}(z)\in(-\lambda_-,\lambda_+)\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Rosiński [6] generalized the CTS distribution under the name of the
''tempered stable distribution''.  The KR distribution, which is a subclass of the Rosiński's generalized tempered stable distributions, is used in finance.&lt;ref name=sb4/&gt;

An infinitely divisible distribution is called a ''modified tempered stable (MTS) distribution'' with parameter &lt;math&gt;(C,\lambda_+,\lambda_-,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;,
if its Lévy triplet &lt;math&gt;(\sigma^2, \nu, \gamma)&lt;/math&gt; is given by
&lt;math&gt;\sigma=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;\nu(dx) = C \left(\frac{q_\alpha(\lambda_+ |x|)}{x^{\alpha+1}}1_{x&gt;0} +\frac{q_\alpha(\lambda_-
|x|)}{|x|^{\alpha+1}}1_{x&lt;0} \right) \, dx,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C, \lambda_+, \lambda_-&gt;0, \alpha&lt;2&lt;/math&gt; and 
:&lt;math&gt;q_\alpha(x)=x^{\frac{\alpha+1}{2}}K_{\frac{\alpha+1}{2}}(x).&lt;/math&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;K_p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the modified Bessel function of the second kind.
The MTS distribution is not included in the class of Rosiński's generalized tempered stable distributions.&lt;ref name=sb3/&gt;

== Volatility clustering with stable and tempered stable innovation ==

In order to describe the volatility clustering effect of the return process of an asset, the [[GARCH]] model can be used. In the GARCH model, innovation (&lt;math&gt; ~\epsilon_t~ &lt;/math&gt;) is assumed that &lt;math&gt; ~\epsilon_t=\sigma_t z_t ~&lt;/math&gt;, where
&lt;math&gt; z_t\sim iid~ N(0,1) &lt;/math&gt; and where
the series &lt;math&gt; \sigma_t^2 &lt;/math&gt; are modeled by

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma_t^2=\alpha_0+\alpha_1 \epsilon_{t-1}^2+\cdots+\alpha_q \epsilon_{t-q}^2 = \alpha_0 + \sum_{i=1}^q \alpha_{i} \epsilon_{t-i}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

and where &lt;math&gt; ~\alpha_0&gt;0~ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \alpha_i\ge 0,~i&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

However, the assumption of &lt;math&gt; z_t\sim iid~ N(0,1) &lt;/math&gt; is often rejected empirically. For that reason, new GARCH models with stable or tempered stable distributed innovation have been developed. GARCH models with &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-stable innovations have been introduced.&lt;ref name=sc3/&gt;&lt;ref name=sc4/&gt;&lt;ref name=sc5/&gt; Subsequently, GARCH Models with tempered stable innovations have been developed.&lt;ref name=sb3/&gt;&lt;ref name=sc2/&gt;

Objections against the use of stable distributions in Financial models are given in &lt;ref name=sd1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sd2/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8789">In [[algebraic geometry]],  '''flips'''  and  '''flops''' are  codimension-2 [[surgery theory|surgery]] operations arising in the [[minimal model program]], given by [[blowing up]] along a [[relative canonical model|relative canonical ring]].  In dimension 3 flips are used to construct minimal models, and any two birationally equivalent  minimal models are connected by a sequence of flops. It is conjectured that the same is true in higher dimensions.

==The minimal model program==
{{main|Minimal model program}}
The minimal model program can be summarised very briefly as follows: given a variety &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we construct a sequence of [[contracting morphism|contractions]] &lt;math&gt;X = X_1\rightarrow X_2 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow X_n &lt;/math&gt;, each of which contracts some curves on which the canonical divisor &lt;math&gt;K_{X_i}&lt;/math&gt; is negative. Eventually, &lt;math&gt;K_{X_n}&lt;/math&gt; should become [[numerically effective|nef]] (at least in the case of nonnegative [[Kodaira dimension]]), which is the desired result. The major technical problem is that, at some stage, the variety &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; may become 'too singular', in the sense that the canonical divisor &lt;math&gt;K_{X_i}&lt;/math&gt; is no longer [[Cartier divisor|Cartier]], so the intersection number &lt;math&gt;K_{X_i} \cdot C&lt;/math&gt; with a curve &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is not even defined.
 
The (conjectural) solution to this problem is the ''flip''. Given a problematic &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; as above, the flip of &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; is a birational map (in fact an isomorphism in codimension 1) &lt;math&gt;f: X_i \rightarrow X_i^+&lt;/math&gt; to a variety whose singularities are 'better' than those of &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;. So we can put &lt;math&gt;X_{i+1} = X_i^+&lt;/math&gt;, and continue the process.&lt;ref&gt;More precisely, there is a conjecture stating that every sequence &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; ⇢ &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; ⇢ &lt;math&gt;\dots&lt;/math&gt; ⇢ &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; ⇢ &lt;math&gt;\dots&lt;/math&gt; of flips of varieties with Kawamata log terminal singularities, projective over a fixed normal variety &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; terminates after finitely many steps.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major problems concerning flips are to show that they exist and to show that one cannot have an infinite sequence of flips. If both of these problems can be solved then the minimal model program can be carried out. 
The existence of flips for 3-folds was proved by {{harvtxt|Mori|1988}}. The existence of log flips, a more general kind of flip, in dimension three and four were proved by {{harvs|txt|last=Shokurov|year1=1993 |year2=2003}}
whose work was fundamental to the solution of the existence of log flips and other problems in higher dimension. 
The  existence of log flips in higher dimensions has been settled by {{harvs|first=Caucher |last=Birkar|first2= Paolo |last2=Cascini|first3= Christopher D. |last3=Hacon|first4= James|last4= McKernan|year=2010}}. On the other hand, the problem of termination—proving that there can be no infinite sequence of flips—is still open in dimensions greater than 3.

==Definition==
If ''f'':''X''→''Y'' is a morphism, and ''K'' is the canonical bundle of ''X'', then the relative canonical ring of ''f'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\oplus_m f_*(\mathcal O_X(mK))&lt;/math&gt;
and is a sheaf of graded algebras over the sheaf ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; of regular functions on ''Y''.
The blowup ''f''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f^+:X^+= Proj(\oplus_m f_*(\mathcal O_X(mK)))\to Y&lt;/math&gt;
of ''Y'' along the relative canonical ring is a morphism to ''Y''. If the relative canonical ring is finitely generated (as an algebra over ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;) then the  morphism ''f''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is called the '''flip''' of ''f''  if &amp;minus;''K''  is relatively ample, and the '''flop''' of ''f'' if ''K'' is relatively trivial. (Sometimes the induced birational morphism from ''X'' to ''X''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is called a flip or flop.)

In applications, ''f'' is often  a [[small contraction]] of an extremal ray, which implies several extra properties:
*The exceptional sets of both maps ''f'' and ''f''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; have codimension at least 2,
*''X'' and ''X''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; only have mild singularities, such as [[terminal singularities]].
*''f'' and ''f''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are birational morphisms onto ''Y'', which is normal and projective.
*All curves in the fibers of ''f'' and ''f''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are numerically proportional.

==Examples==
The first example of a flop, known as the '''Atiyah flop''', was found in {{harv|Atiyah|1958}}.
Let ''Y'' be the zeros of ''xy'' = ''zw'' in '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and let ''V'' be the blowup of ''Y'' at the origin. 
The exceptional locus of this blowup is isomorphic to '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and can be blown down to '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2 different ways, giving varieties ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The natural birational map from ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to  ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the Atiyah flop.

{{harvtxt|Reid|1983}} introduced '''Reid's pagoda''', a generalization of Atiyah's flop replacing ''Y'' by the zeros of 
''xy'' = (''z''+''w''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;)(''z''&amp;minus;''w''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;).

The '''Hadamard code''' is an [[error-correcting code]] named after [[Jacques Hadamard]] that is used for [[error detection and correction]] when transmitting messages over very noisy or unreliable channels. In 1971, the code was used to transmit photos of Mars back to Earth from the NASA space probe [[Mariner 9]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcs.csueastbay.edu/~malek/TeX/Hadamard.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its unique mathematical properties, the Hadamard code is not only used by engineers, but also intensely studied in [[coding theory]], [[mathematics]], and [[theoretical computer science]].
The Hadamard code is named after the French mathematician [[Jacques Hadamard]].
It is also known under the names '''Walsh code''', '''Walsh family''',&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{Harvtxt|Amadei|Manzoli|Merani|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Walsh–Hadamard code'''&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{Harvtxt|Arora|Barak|2009|loc=Section 19.2.2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in recognition of the American mathematician [[Joseph Leonard Walsh]].

The Hadamard code is an example of a [[linear code]] over a [[binary set|binary alphabet]] that maps messages of length &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; to codewords of length &lt;math&gt;2^k&lt;/math&gt;.
It is unique in that each non-zero codeword has a [[Hamming weight]] of exactly &lt;math&gt;2^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that the [[Block code#The distance d|distance]] of the code is also &lt;math&gt;2^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
In standard [[Block code#Popular notation|coding theory notation]] for [[block code]]s, the Hadamard code is a &lt;math&gt;[2^k,k,2^{k-1}]_2&lt;/math&gt;-code, that is, it is a [[linear code]] over a [[binary set|binary alphabet]], has [[Block code#The block length n|block length]] &lt;math&gt;2^k&lt;/math&gt;, [[Block code#The message length k|message length]] (or dimension) &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and [[Block code#The distance d|minimum distance]] &lt;math&gt;2^k/2&lt;/math&gt;.
The block length is very large compared to the message length, but on the other hand, errors can be corrected even in extremely noisy conditions.
The '''punctured Hadamard code''' is a slightly improved version of the Hadamard code; it is a &lt;math&gt;[2^k,k+1,2^{k-1}]_2&lt;/math&gt;-code and thus has a slightly better [[Block code#The rate R|rate]] while maintaining the relative distance of &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;, and is thus preferred in practical applications.
The punctured Hadamard code is the same as the first order [[Reed–Muller code]] over the binary alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{harvtxt|Guruswami|2009|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally, Hadamard codes are based on [[Hadamard matrix#Sylvester's construction|Sylvester's construction of Hadamard matrices]], but the term “Hadamard code” is also used to refer to codes constructed from arbitrary [[Hadamard matrix|Hadamard matrices]], which are not necessarily of Sylvester type.
In general, such a code is not linear.
Such codes were first constructed by [[R. C. Bose]] and [[Sharadchandra Shankar Shrikhande|S. S. Shrikhande]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If ''n'' is the size of the Hadamard matrix, the code has parameters &lt;math&gt;(n,2n,n/2)_2&lt;/math&gt;, meaning it is a not-necessarily-linear binary code with 2''n'' codewords of block length ''n'' and minimal distance ''n''/2. The construction and decoding scheme described below apply for general ''n'', but the property of linearity and the identification with Reed–Muller codes require that ''n'' be a power of 2 and that the Hadamard matrix be equivalent to the matrix constructed by Sylvester's method.

The Hadamard code is a [[locally decodable]] code, which provides a way to recover parts of the original message with high probability, while only looking at a small fraction of the received word. This gives rise to applications in [[computational complexity theory]] and particularly in the design of [[probabilistically checkable proofs]].
Since the relative distance of the Hadamard code is 1/2, normally one can only hope to recover from at most a 1/4 fraction of error. Using [[list decoding]], however, it is possible to compute a short list of possible candidate messages as long as fewer than &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; of the bits in the received word have been corrupted.

In [[code division multiple access]] (CDMA) communication, the Hadamard code is referred to as Walsh Code, and is used to define individual [[telecommunications|communication]] [[channel (communications)|channels]]. It is usual in the CDMA literature to refer to codewords as “codes”. Each user will use a different codeword, or “code”, to modulate their signal. Because Walsh codewords are mathematically [[orthogonal]], a Walsh-encoded signal appears as [[random noise]] to a CDMA capable mobile [[terminal (telecommunication)|terminal]], unless that terminal uses the same codeword as the one used to encode the incoming [[signal (information theory)|signal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://complextoreal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/CDMA.pdf|title=CDMA Tutorial: Intuitive Guide to Principles of Communications|publisher=Complex to Real|accessdate=10 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720084646/http://www.complextoreal.com/CDMA.pdf|archivedate=20 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Hadamard code'' is the name that is most commonly used for this code in the literature. However, in modern use these error correcting codes are referred to as Walsh–Hadamard codes.

There is a reason for this:

[[Jacques Hadamard]] did not invent the code himself, but he defined [[Hadamard matrix|Hadamard matrices]] around 1893, long before the first [[error-correcting code]], the [[Hamming code]], was developed in the 1940s.

The Hadamard code is based on Hadamard matrices, and while there are many different Hadamard matrices that could be used here, normally only [[Hadamard matrix#Sylvester's construction|Sylvester's construction of Hadamard matrices]] is used to obtain the codewords of the Hadamard code.

[[James Joseph Sylvester]] developed his construction of Hadamard matrices in 1867, which actually predates Hadamard's work on Hadamard matrices. Hence the name ''Hadamard code'' is disputed and sometimes the code is called ''Walsh code'', honoring the American mathematician [[Joseph Leonard Walsh]].

A Hadamard code was used during the 1971 [[Mariner 9]] mission to correct for picture transmission errors. The data words used during this mission were 6 bits long, which represented 64 [[grayscale]] values.

Because of limitations of the quality of the alignment of the transmitter at the time (due to Doppler Tracking Loop issues) the maximum useful data length was about 30 bits. Instead of using a [[repetition code]], a [32, 6, 16] Hadamard code was used.

Errors of up to 7 bits per word could be corrected using this scheme. Compared to a 5-[[repetition code]], the error correcting properties of this Hadamard code are much better, yet its rate is comparable. The efficient decoding algorithm was an important factor in the decision to use this code.

The circuitry used was called the "Green Machine". It employed the [[fast Fourier transform]] which can increase the decoding speed by a factor of three. Since the 1990s use of this code by space programs has more or less ceased, and the Deep Space Network does not support this error correction scheme for its dishes that are greater than 26&amp;nbsp;m.

==Constructions==
While all Hadamard codes are based on Hadamard matrices, the constructions differ in subtle ways for different scientific fields, authors, and uses. Engineers, who use the codes for data transmission, and [[coding theory|coding theorists]], who analyse extremal properties of codes, typically want the [[Block code#The rate R|rate]] of the code to be as high as possible, even if this means that the construction becomes mathematically slightly less elegant.

On the other hand, for many applications of Hadamard codes in [[theoretical computer science]] it is not so important to achieve the optimal rate, and hence simpler constructions of Hadamard codes are preferred since they can be analyzed more elegantly.

===Construction using inner products===
When given a binary message &lt;math&gt;x\in\{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt; of length &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the Hadamard code encodes the message into a codeword &lt;math&gt;\text{Had}(x)&lt;/math&gt; using an encoding function &lt;math&gt;\text{Had} : \{0,1\}^k\to\{0,1\}^{2^k}.&lt;/math&gt;
This function makes use of the [[inner product]] &lt;math&gt;\langle x , y \rangle&lt;/math&gt; of two vectors &lt;math&gt;x,y\in\{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt;, which is defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\langle x , y \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{k} x_i y_i\ \bmod\ 2\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Then the Hadamard encoding of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the sequence of ''all'' inner products with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Had}(x) = \Big(\langle x , y \rangle\Big)_{y\in\{0,1\}^k}&lt;/math&gt;

As mentioned above, the ''punctured'' Hadamard code is used in practice since the Hadamard code itself is somewhat wasteful.
This is because, if the first bit of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is zero, &lt;math&gt;y_1=0&lt;/math&gt;, then the inner product contains no information whatsoever about &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;, and hence, it is impossible to fully decode &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; from those positions of the codeword alone.
On the other hand, when the codeword is restricted to the positions where &lt;math&gt;y_1=1&lt;/math&gt;, it is still possible to fully decode &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence it makes sense to restrict the Hadamard code to these positions, which gives rise to the ''punctured'' Hadamard encoding of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;; that is, &lt;math&gt;\text{pHad}(x) = \Big(\langle x , y \rangle\Big)_{y\in\{1\}\times\{0,1\}^{k-1}}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Construction using a generator matrix===
The Hadamard code is a linear code, and all linear codes can be generated by a generator matrix &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. This is a matrix such that &lt;math&gt;\text{Had}(x)= x\cdot G&lt;/math&gt; holds for all &lt;math&gt;x\in\{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt;, where the message &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is viewed as a row vector and the vector-matrix product is understood in the [[vector space]] over the [[finite field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F_2&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, an equivalent way to write the inner product definition for the Hadamard code arises by using the generator matrix whose columns consist of ''all'' strings &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of length &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, that is,

:&lt;math&gt;G = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\uparrow &amp; \uparrow &amp; &amp; \uparrow\\ 
y_1 &amp; y_2 &amp; \dots &amp; y_{2^k} \\ 
\downarrow &amp; \downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow
\end{pmatrix}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;y_i \in \{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th binary vector in [[lexicographical order]].
For example, the generator matrix for the Hadamard code of dimension &lt;math&gt;k=3&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;
G = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\ 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\ 
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The matrix &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;(k\times 2^k)&lt;/math&gt;-matrix and gives rise to the [[linear operator]] &lt;math&gt;\text{Had}:\{0,1\}^k\to\{0,1\}^{2^k}&lt;/math&gt;.

The generator matrix of the ''punctured'' Hadamard code is obtained by restricting the matrix &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to the columns whose first entry is one.
For example, the generator matrix for the punctured Hadamard code of dimension &lt;math&gt;k=3&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;
G' = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\ 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\ 
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Then &lt;math&gt;\text{pHad}:\{0,1\}^k\to\{0,1\}^{2^{k-1}}&lt;/math&gt; is a linear mapping with &lt;math&gt;\text{pHad}(x)= x \cdot G'&lt;/math&gt;.

For general &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the generator matrix of the punctured Hadamard code is a [[parity-check matrix]] for the [[Hamming code#Hamming codes with additional parity (SECDED)|extended Hamming code]] of length &lt;math&gt;2^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; and dimension &lt;math&gt;2^{k-1}-k&lt;/math&gt;, which makes the punctured Hadamard code the [[dual code]] of the extended Hamming code.
Hence an alternative way to define the Hadamard code is in terms of its parity-check matrix: the parity-check matrix of the Hadamard code is equal to the generator matrix of the Hamming code.

===Construction using general Hadamard matrices===
Generalized Hadamard codes are obtained from an ''n''-by-''n'' [[Hadamard matrix]] ''H''. In particular, the 2''n'' codewords of the code are the rows of ''H'' and the rows of −''H''. To obtain a code over the alphabet {0,1}, the mapping −1&amp;nbsp;↦&amp;nbsp;1, 1&amp;nbsp;↦&amp;nbsp;0, or, equivalently, ''x''&amp;nbsp;↦&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x'')/2, is applied to the matrix elements. That the minimum distance of the code is ''n''/2 follows from the defining property of Hadamard matrices, namely that their rows are mutually orthogonal. This implies that two distinct rows of a Hadamard matrix differ in exactly ''n''/2 positions, and, since negation of a row does not affect orthogonality, that any row of ''H'' differs from any row of −''H'' in ''n''/2 positions as well, except when the rows correspond, in which case they differ in ''n'' positions.

To get the punctured Hadamard code above with &lt;math&gt;n=2^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;, the chosen Hadamard matrix ''H'' has to be of Sylvester type, which gives rise to a message length of &lt;math&gt;\log_2(2n)=k&lt;/math&gt;.

==Distance==
The distance of a code is the minimum [[Hamming distance]] between any two distinct codewords, i.e., the minimum number of positions at which two distinct codewords differ. Since the Walsh–Hadamard code is a [[linear code]], the distance is equal to the minimum [[Hamming weight]] among all of its non-zero codewords. All non-zero codewords of the Walsh–Hadamard code have a [[Hamming weight]] of exactly &lt;math&gt;2^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; by the following argument.

Let &lt;math&gt;x\in\{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt; be a non-zero message. Then the following value is exactly equal to the fraction of positions in the codeword that are equal to one:

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr_{y\in\{0,1\}^k} \big[ (\text{Had}(x))_y = 1 \big] = \Pr_{y\in\{0,1\}^k} \big[ \langle x,y\rangle = 1 \big]\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The fact that the latter value is exactly &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''random subsum principle''. To see that it is true, assume without loss of generality that &lt;math&gt;x_1=1&lt;/math&gt;.
Then, when conditioned on the values of &lt;math&gt;y_2,\dots,y_k&lt;/math&gt;, the event is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;y_1 \cdot x_1 = b&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;b\in\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; depending on &lt;math&gt;x_2,\dots,x_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2,\dots,y_k&lt;/math&gt;. The probability that &lt;math&gt;y_1=b&lt;/math&gt; happens is exactly &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, in fact, ''all'' non-zero codewords of the Hadamard code have relative Hamming weight &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;, and thus, its relative distance is &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;.

The relative distance of the ''punctured'' Hadamard code is &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; as well, but it no longer has the property that every non-zero codeword has weight exactly &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; since the all &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;s vector &lt;math&gt;1^{2^{k-1}}&lt;/math&gt; is a codeword of the punctured Hadamard code. This is because the vector &lt;math&gt;x=10^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; encodes to &lt;math&gt;\text{pHad}(10^{k-1}) = 1^{2^{k-1}}&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, whenever &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is non-zero and not the vector &lt;math&gt;10^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;, the random subsum principle applies again, and the relative weight of &lt;math&gt;\text{Had}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is exactly &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Local decodability ==
A [[locally decodable]] code is a code that allows a single bit of the original message to be recovered with high probability by only looking at a small portion of the received word.

A code is &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;-query [[locally decodable]] if a message bit, &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, can be recovered by checking &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; bits of the received word. More formally, a code, &lt;math&gt;C: \{0,1\}^k \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;, is &lt;math&gt;(q, \delta\geq 0, \epsilon\geq 0)&lt;/math&gt;-locally decodable, if there exists a probabilistic decoder, &lt;math&gt;D:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt;, such that ''(Note: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[Hamming distance]] between vectors &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;)'':

&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \{0,1\}^k, \forall y \in \{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta(y, C(x)) \leq \delta n&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;Pr[D(y)_i = x_i] \geq \frac{1}{2} + \epsilon, \forall i \in [k]&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem 1:''' The Walsh–Hadamard code is &lt;math&gt;(2, \delta, \frac{1}{2}-2\delta)&lt;/math&gt;-locally decodable for &lt;math&gt;0\leq \delta \leq \frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Lemma 1:''' For all codewords, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in a Walsh–Hadamard code, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_i+c_j=c_{i+j}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c_i, c_j&lt;/math&gt; represent the bits in &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in positions &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; respectively, and &lt;math&gt;c_{i+j}&lt;/math&gt; represents the bit at position &lt;math&gt;(i+j)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Proof of lemma 1===
----
Let &lt;math&gt;C(x) = c = (c_0,\dots,c_{2^n-1})&lt;/math&gt; be the codeword in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to message &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;G = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\uparrow &amp; \uparrow &amp; &amp; \uparrow\\ 
g_0 &amp; g_1 &amp; \dots &amp; g_{2^n-1} \\ 
\downarrow &amp; \downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; be the generator matrix of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.

By definition, &lt;math&gt;c_i = x\cdot g_i&lt;/math&gt;. From this, &lt;math&gt;c_i+c_j = x\cdot g_i + x\cdot g_j = x\cdot(g_i+g_j)&lt;/math&gt;. By the construction of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_i + g_j = g_{i+j}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, by substitution, &lt;math&gt;c_i + c_j = x\cdot g_{i+j} = c_{i+j}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Proof of theorem 1===
----
To prove theorem 1 we will construct a decoding algorithm and prove its correctness.

====Algorithm====
'''Input:''' Received word &lt;math&gt;y = (y_0, \dots, y_{2^n-1})&lt;/math&gt;

For each &lt;math&gt;i \in \{1, \dots, n\}&lt;/math&gt;:
# Pick &lt;math&gt;j \in \{0, \dots, 2^n-1\}&lt;/math&gt; uniformly at random
# Pick &lt;math&gt;k \in \{0, \dots, 2^n-1\}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;j+k = e_i&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;j+k&lt;/math&gt; is the bitwise ''xor'' of &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;x_i \gets y_j+y_k&lt;/math&gt;

'''Output:''' Message &lt;math&gt;x = (x_1, \dots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt;

====Proof of correctness====
For any message, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and received word &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; differs from &lt;math&gt;c = C(x)&lt;/math&gt; on at most &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; fraction of bits, &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; can be decoded with probability at least &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}+(\frac{1}{2}-2\delta)&lt;/math&gt;.

By lemma 1, &lt;math&gt;c_j+c_k = c_{j+k} = x\cdot g_{j+k} = x\cdot e_i = x_i&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; are picked uniformly, the probability that &lt;math&gt;y_j \not = c_j&lt;/math&gt; is at most &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, the probability that &lt;math&gt;y_k \not = c_k&lt;/math&gt; is at most &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. By the [[union bound]], the probability that either &lt;math&gt;y_j&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y_k&lt;/math&gt; do not match the corresponding bits in &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is at most &lt;math&gt;2\delta&lt;/math&gt;. If both &lt;math&gt;y_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_k&lt;/math&gt; correspond to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, then lemma 1 will apply, and therefore, the proper value of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; will be computed. Therefore, the probability &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is decoded properly is at least &lt;math&gt;1-2\delta&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \frac{1}{2} - 2\delta&lt;/math&gt; and for &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; to be positive, &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \delta \leq \frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, the Walsh–Hadamard code is &lt;math&gt;(2, \delta, \frac{1}{2}-2\delta)&lt;/math&gt; locally decodable for &lt;math&gt;0\leq \delta \leq \frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

==Optimality==
For ''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;7 the linear Hadamard codes have been proven optimal in the sense of minimum distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=David B. |last=Jaffe |first2=Iliya |last2=Bouyukliev |title=Optimal binary linear codes of dimension at most seven |url=http://www.math.unl.edu/~djaffe2/papers/sevens.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, rectification is achieved by a virtual rotation of the red and green image planes, respectively, to be parallel to the stereo baseline.]]&lt;ref name="FUSIELLO2000_2" /&gt;

== In computer vision==
[[Image:Epipolar geometry.svg|The search for point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_L&lt;/math&gt;'s match is restricted to the line &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbf{e}_R \mathbf{x}_R}&lt;/math&gt;in the right image. Since the images are not rectified, the line &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbf{e}_R \mathbf{x}_R}&lt;/math&gt; is slanted. After rectification it would be horizontal.|thumb|300px|right]]

[[Computer stereo vision]] takes two or more images with known relative camera positions that show an object from different viewpoints. For each pixel it then determines the corresponding scene point's depth (i.e. distance from the camera) by first finding matching pixels (i.e. pixels showing the same scene point) in the other image(s) and then applying triangulation to the found matches to determine their depth.
Finding matches in stereo vision is restricted by [[epipolar geometry]]: Each pixel's match in another image can only be found on a line called the epipolar line.
If two images are coplanar, i.e. they were taken such that the right camera is only offset horizontally compared to the left camera (not being moved towards the object or rotated), then each pixel's epipolar line is horizontal and at the same vertical position as that pixel. However, in general settings (the camera did move towards the object or rotate) the epipolar lines are slanted. Image rectification warps both images such that they appear as if they have been taken with only a horizontal displacement and as a consequence all epipolar lines are horizontal, which slightly simplifies the stereo matching process. Note however, that rectification does not fundamentally change the stereo matching process: It searches on lines, slanted ones before and horizontal ones after rectification.

Image rectification is also an equivalent (and more often used&lt;ref name="ORAM2001" /&gt;) alternative to perfect camera coplanarity. Even with high-precision equipment, image rectification is usually performed because it may be impractical to maintain perfect coplanarity between cameras.

Image rectification can only be performed with two images at a time and simultaneous rectification of more than two images is generally impossible&lt;ref name="SZELISKI2010" /&gt;.

=== Transformation ===
{{further|Transformation matrix}}

If the images to be rectified are taken from camera pairs without geometric [[Distortion (optics)|distortion]], this calculation can easily be made with a [[linear transformation]]. X &amp; Y rotation puts the images on the same plane, scaling makes the image frames be the same size and Z rotation &amp; skew adjustments make the image pixel rows directly line up{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. The rigid alignment of the cameras needs to be known (by calibration) and the calibration coefficients are used by the transform.&lt;ref name="FUSIELLO2000" /&gt;

In performing the transform, if the cameras themselves are calibrated for internal parameters, an [[essential matrix]] provides the relationship between the cameras. The more general case (without camera calibration) is represented by the [[fundamental matrix (computer vision)|fundamental matrix]].  If the fundamental matrix is not known, it is necessary to find preliminary point correspondences between stereo images to facilitate its extraction.&lt;ref name="FUSIELLO2000" /&gt;

=== Algorithms ===
There are three main categories for image rectification algorithms: planar rectification,&lt;ref name="FUSIELLO2000_2" /&gt; cylindrical rectification&lt;ref name="ORAM2001" /&gt; and polar rectification.&lt;ref name="POLLEFEYS1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LIM2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ROBERTO2009" /&gt;

=== Implementation details ===
All rectified images satisfy the following two properties:&lt;ref name="ZHANG2009" /&gt;
* All epipolar lines are parallel to the horizontal axis.
* Corresponding points have identical vertical coordinates.

In order to transform the original image pair into a rectified image pair, it is necessary to find a [[projective transformation]] ''H''. Constraints are placed on ''H'' to satisfy the two properties above. For example, constraining the epipolar lines to be parallel with the horizontal axis means that epipoles must be mapped to the infinite point ''[1,0,0]&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'' in [[homogeneous coordinates]]. Even with these constraints, ''H'' still has four degrees of freedom.&lt;ref name="HARTLEY2003" /&gt; It is also necessary to find a matching ''H' '' to rectify the second image of an image pair. Poor choices of ''H'' and ''H' '' can result in rectified images that are dramatically changed in scale or severely distorted.

There are many different strategies for choosing a projective transform ''H'' for each image from all possible solutions. One advanced method is minimizing the disparity or least-square difference of corresponding points on the horizontal axis of the rectified image pair.&lt;ref name="HARTLEY2003" /&gt; Another method is separating ''H'' into a specialized projective transform, similarity transform, and shearing transform to minimize image distortion.&lt;ref name="ZHANG2009" /&gt; One simple method is to rotate both images to look perpendicular to the line joining their collective optical centers, twist the optical axes so the horizontal axis of each image points in the direction of the other image's optical center, and finally scale the smaller image to match for line-to-line correspondence.&lt;ref name="SZELISKI2010" /&gt; This process is demonstrated in the following example.

=== Example ===
[[File:Lecture 1027 stereo 01.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|A visual representation of the variables used in image rectification example.|Model used for image rectification example.]]
[[File:3DRectificationBAG.jpg|thumb|3D view of image rectification example scene.|3D view of example scene. The first camera's optical center and image plane are represented by the green circle and square respectively. The second camera has similar red representations.]]
[[File:2DRectificationBAG.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|Set of corresponding 2D images from image rectification example scene.|Set of 2D images from example. The original images are taken from different perspectives (row 1). Using systematic transformations from the example (rows 2 and 3), we are able to transform both images such that corresponding points are on the same horizontal scan lines (row 4).]]

Our model for this example is based on a pair of images that observe a 3D point ''P'', which corresponds to ''p'' and ''p' '' in the pixel coordinates of each image. ''O'' and ''O' '' represent the optical centers of each camera, with known camera matrices &lt;math&gt;M=K[I~ 0]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M'=K'[R~ T]&lt;/math&gt; (we assume the world origin is at the first camera). We will briefly outline and depict the results for a simple approach to find a ''H'' and ''H' '' projective transformation that rectify the image pair from the example scene.

First, we compute the epipoles, ''e'' and ''e' '' in each image:
:&lt;math&gt;
e=M \begin{bmatrix} O' \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
=M\begin{bmatrix} -R^T T \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = K[I~ 0]\begin{bmatrix} -R^T T \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = -KR^T T
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
e'=M'\begin{bmatrix} O \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = M'\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = K'[R~T]\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = K'T
&lt;/math&gt;

Second, we find a projective transformation ''H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' that rotates our first image to be perpendicular to the baseline connecting ''O'' and ''O' '' (row 2, column 1 of 2D image set). This rotation can be found by using the cross product between the original and the desired optical axes.&lt;ref name="SZELISKI2010" /&gt; Next, we find the projective transformation ''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' that takes the rotated image and twists it so that the horizontal axis aligns with the baseline. If calculated correctly, this second transformation should map the ''e'' to infinity on the x axis (row 3, column 1 of 2D image set). Finally, define &lt;math&gt;H=H_2H_1&lt;/math&gt; as the projective transformation for rectifying the first image.

Third, through an equivalent operation, we can find ''H' '' to rectify the second image (column 2 of 2D image set). Note that ''H'&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' should rotate the second image's optical axis to be parallel with the transformed optical axis of the first image. One strategy is to pick a plane parallel to the line where the two original optical axes intersect to minimize distortion from the reprojection process.&lt;ref name="FORSYTH2002" /&gt; In this example, we simply define ''H' '' using the rotation matrix ''R'' and initial projective transformation ''H'' as &lt;math&gt;H' = HR^T&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally, we scale both images to the same approximate resolution and align the now horizontal epipoles for easier horizontal scanning for correspondences (row 4 of 2D image set).

Note that it is possible to perform this and similar algorithms without having the camera parameter matrices ''M'' and ''M' ''. All that is required is a set of seven or more image to image correspondences to compute the fundamental matrices and epipoles.&lt;ref name="HARTLEY2003" /&gt;

== Geographic information system ==
Image rectification in [[Geographic information system#Raster-to-vector translation|GIS]] converts images to a standard map coordinate system. This is done by matching ground control points (GCP) in the mapping system to points in the image. These GCPs  calculate necessary image transforms.&lt;ref name="FOGEL2008" /&gt;

Primary difficulties in the process occur 
*when the accuracy of the map points are not well known 
*when the images lack clearly identifiable points to correspond to the maps.

The maps that are used with rectified images are non-topographical. However, the images to be used may contain distortion from terrain. Image orthorectification additionally removes these effects.&lt;ref name="FOGEL2008" /&gt;

Image rectification is a standard feature available with GIS software packages.

{{Calculus |Integral}}

In [[mathematical analysis]], an '''improper integral''' is the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of a [[definite integral]] as an endpoint of the interval(s) of integration approaches either a specified [[real number]], &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, or in some instances as both endpoints approach limits. Such an integral is often written symbolically just like a standard definite integral, in some cases with ''infinity'' as a limit of integration.

Specifically, an improper integral is a limit of the form:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{b\to\infty} \int_a^bf(x)\, dx, \qquad \lim_{a\to -\infty} \int_a^bf(x)\, dx,&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{c\to b^-} \int_a^cf(x)\, dx,\quad
\lim_{c\to a^+} \int_c^bf(x)\, dx,&lt;/math&gt;
in which one takes a limit in one or the other (or sometimes both) endpoints {{harv|Apostol|1967|loc=§10.23}}.

By [[abuse of notation]], improper integrals are often written symbolically just like standard definite integrals, perhaps with ''infinity'' among the limits of integration. When the definite integral exists (in the sense of either the [[Riemann integral]] or the more advanced [[Lebesgue integral]]), this ambiguity is resolved as both the proper and improper integral will coincide in value.

Often one is able to compute values for improper integrals, even when the function is not integrable in the conventional sense (as a [[Riemann integral]], for instance) because of a singularity in the function or because one of the bounds of integration is infinite.

==Examples==
The original definition of the [[Riemann integral]] does not apply to a function such as &lt;math&gt;1/{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; on the interval [1, ∞), because in this case the domain of integration is [[bounded set|unbounded]]. However, the Riemann integral can often be extended by [[continuous function|continuity]], by defining the improper integral instead as a [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]]

:&lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2}\,dx=\lim_{b\to\infty} \int_1^b\frac{1}{x^2}\,dx = \lim_{b\to\infty} \left(-\frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{1}\right) = 1. &lt;/math&gt;

The narrow definition of the Riemann integral also does not cover the function &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; on the interval [0, 1]. The problem here is that the integrand is [[bounded function|unbounded]] in the domain of integration (the definition requires that both the domain of integration and the integrand be bounded). However, the improper integral does exist if understood as the limit

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}\,dx=\lim_{a\to 0^+}\int_a^1\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}\, dx = \lim_{a\to 0^+}(2-2\sqrt{a})=2.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Improper integral.svg|right|thumb|The improper integral&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{dx}{(x+1)\sqrt{x}} = \pi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt; has unbounded intervals for both domain and range.]]Sometimes integrals may have two singularities where they are improper.  Consider, for example, the function {{math|1/((''x'' + 1){{sqrt|''x''}})}} integrated from 0 to {{math|∞}} (shown right). At the lower bound, as {{mvar|x}} goes to 0 the function goes to {{math|∞}}, and the upper bound is itself {{math|∞}}, though the function goes to 0. Thus this is a doubly improper integral. Integrated, say, from 1 to 3, an ordinary Riemann sum suffices to produce a result of {{pi}}/6. To integrate from 1 to {{math|∞}}, a Riemann sum is not possible. However, any finite upper bound, say {{mvar|t}} (with {{math|''t'' &amp;gt; 1}}), gives a well-defined result, {{math|2 arctan({{sqrt|''t''}}) − {{pi}}/2}}. This has a finite limit as {{mvar|t}} goes to infinity, namely {{pi}}/2. Similarly, the integral from 1/3 to 1 allows a Riemann sum as well, coincidentally again producing {{pi}}/6. Replacing 1/3 by an arbitrary positive value {{mvar|s}} (with {{math|''s'' &amp;lt; 1}}) is equally safe, giving {{math|{{pi}}/2 − 2 arctan({{sqrt|''s''}})}}. This, too, has a finite limit as {{mvar|s}} goes to zero, namely {{pi}}/2. Combining the limits of the two fragments, the result of this improper integral is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{dx}{(x+1)\sqrt{x}} &amp;{} = \lim_{s \to 0^+} \int_{s}^{1} \frac{dx}{(x+1)\sqrt{x}}
   + \lim_{t \to \infty} \int_{1}^{t} \frac{dx}{(x+1)\sqrt{x}} \\
  &amp;{} = \lim_{s \to 0^+} \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - 2 \arctan{\sqrt{s}} \right)
   + \lim_{t \to \infty} \left(2 \arctan{\sqrt{t}} - \frac{\pi}{2} \right) \\
  &amp;{} = \frac{\pi}{2} + \left(\pi - \frac{\pi}{2} \right) \\
  &amp;{} = \pi .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This process does not guarantee success; a limit might fail to exist, or might be infinite. For example, over the bounded interval from 0 to 1 the integral of 1/{{mvar|x}} does not converge; and over the unbounded interval from 1 to {{math|∞}} the integral of 1/{{math|{{sqrt|''x''}}}} does not converge.

[[File:Improper integral unbounded internally.svg|right|thumb|The improper integral&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^{1} \frac{dx}{\sqrt[3]{x^2}} = 6&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt; converges, since both left and right limits exist, though the integrand is unbounded near an interior point.]]
It might also happen that an integrand is unbounded near an interior point, in which case the integral must be split at that point. For the integral as a whole to converge, the limit integrals on both sides must exist and must be bounded. For example:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \int_{-1}^{1} \frac{dx}{\sqrt[3]{x^2}} &amp;{} = \lim_{s \to 0} \int_{-1}^{-s} \frac{dx}{\sqrt[3]{x^2}}
   + \lim_{t \to 0} \int_{t}^{1} \frac{dx}{\sqrt[3]{x^2}} \\
  &amp;{} = \lim_{s \to 0} 3(1-\sqrt[3]{s}) + \lim_{t \to 0} 3(1-\sqrt[3]{t}) \\
  &amp;{} = 3 + 3 \\
  &amp;{} = 6.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
But the similar integral
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^{1} \frac{dx}{x}&lt;/math&gt;
cannot be assigned a value in this way, as the integrals above and below zero do not independently converge. (However, see [[Cauchy principal value]].)

== Convergence of the integral ==
An improper integral converges if the limit defining it exists.  Thus for example one says that the improper integral
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\to\infty}\int_a^t f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
exists and is equal to ''L'' if the integrals under the limit exist for all sufficiently large ''t'', and the value of the limit is equal to ''L''.

It is also possible for an improper integral to diverge to infinity.  In that case, one may assign the value of ∞ (or -∞) to the integral. For instance 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{b\to\infty}\int_1^b \frac{1}{x}\,dx = \infty.&lt;/math&gt;
However, other improper integrals may simply diverge in no particular direction, such as
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{b\to\infty}\int_1^b x\sin(x)\,dx,&lt;/math&gt;
which does not exist, even as an [[extended real number]]. This is called divergence by oscillation.

A limitation of the technique of improper integration is that the limit must be taken with respect to one endpoint at a time.  Thus, for instance, an improper integral of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

can be defined by taking two separate limits; to wit

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\,dx = \lim_{a\to -\infty} \lim_{b\to\infty} \int_a^bf(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

provided the double limit is finite. It can also be defined as a pair of distinct improper integrals of the first kind:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\to -\infty}\int_a^cf(x)\,dx + \lim_{b\to\infty} \int_c^b f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is any convenient point at which to start the integration. This definition also applies when one of these integrals is infinite, or both if they have the same sign.

An example of an improper integrals where both endpoints are infinite is the [[Gaussian integral]] &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}\,dx = \sqrt{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;. An example which evaluates to infinity is &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^x\,dx&lt;/math&gt;. But one cannot even define other integrals of this kind unambiguously, such as &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty x\,dx&lt;/math&gt;, since the double limit is infinite and the two-integral method

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\to -\infty}\int_a^cx\,dx + \lim_{b\to\infty} \int_c^b x\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
yields &lt;math&gt;\infty-\infty&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, one can however define an improper integral in the sense of [[Cauchy principal value]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{p.v.} \int_{-\infty}^\infty x\,dx = \lim_{b\to\infty}\int_{-b}^b x\,dx = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The questions one must address in determining an improper integral are:

*Does the limit exist?
*Can the limit be computed?

The first question is an issue of [[mathematical analysis]]. The second one can be addressed by calculus techniques, but also in some cases by [[contour integration]], [[Fourier transform]]s and other more advanced methods.

==Types of integrals==
There is more than one theory of [[integral|integration]]. From the point of view of calculus, the [[Riemann integral]] theory is usually assumed as the default theory. In using improper integrals, it can matter which integration theory is in play.

* For the Riemann integral (or the [[Darboux integral]], which is equivalent to it), improper integration is necessary ''both'' for unbounded intervals (since one cannot divide the interval into finitely many subintervals of finite length) ''and'' for unbounded functions with finite integral (since, supposing it is unbounded above, then the upper integral will be infinite, but the lower integral will be finite).
* The [[Lebesgue integral]] deals differently with unbounded domains and unbounded functions, so that often an integral which only exists as an improper Riemann integral will exist as a (proper) Lebesgue integral, such as &lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.  On the other hand, there are also integrals that have an improper Riemann integral but do not have a (proper) Lebesgue integral, such as &lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}{x}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;. The Lebesgue theory does not see this as a deficiency: from the point of view of [[measure theory]], &lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}{x}\,dx = \infty - \infty&lt;/math&gt; and cannot be defined satisfactorily.  In some situations, however, it may be convenient to employ improper Lebesgue integrals as is the case, for instance, when defining the [[Cauchy principal value]]. The Lebesgue integral is more or less essential in the theoretical treatment of the [[Fourier transform]], with pervasive use of integrals over the whole real line.
* For the [[Henstock–Kurzweil integral]], improper integration ''is not necessary'', and this is seen as a strength of the theory: it encompasses all Lebesgue integrable and improper Riemann integrable functions.

== Improper Riemann integrals and Lebesgue integrals ==
[[File:Improperintegral1.png|right|thumb|200px|Figure 1]]
[[File:Improperintegral2.png|right|thumb|200px|Figure 2]]

In some cases, the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^c f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

can be defined as an integral (a [[Lebesgue integral]], for instance) without reference to the limit

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{b\to c^-}\int_a^b f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

but cannot otherwise be conveniently computed.  This often happens when the function ''f'' being integrated from ''a'' to ''c'' has a [[vertical asymptote]] at ''c'', or if ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∞ (see Figures 1 and 2).  In such cases, the improper Riemann integral allows one to calculate the Lebesgue integral of the function.  Specifically, the following theorem holds  {{harv|Apostol|1974|loc=Theorem 10.33}}:

* If a function ''f'' is Riemann integrable on [''a'',''b''] for every ''b''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''a'', and the partial integrals
::&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b|f(x)|\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
:are bounded as ''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;∞, then the improper Riemann integrals
::&lt;math&gt;\int_a^\infty f(x)\,dx,\quad\mbox{and }\int_a^\infty |f(x)|\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
:both exist.  Furthermore, ''f'' is Lebesgue integrable on [''a'', ∞), and its Lebesgue integral is equal to its improper Riemann integral.

For example, the integral
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty\frac{dx}{1+x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
can be interpreted alternatively as the improper integral
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{b\to\infty}\int_0^b\frac{dx}{1+x^2}=\lim_{b\to\infty}\arctan{b}=\frac{\pi}{2},&lt;/math&gt;
or it may be interpreted instead as a [[Lebesgue integral]] over the set (0, ∞).  Since both of these kinds of integral agree, one is free to choose the first method to calculate the value of the integral, even if one ultimately wishes to regard it as a Lebesgue integral.  Thus improper integrals are clearly useful tools for obtaining the actual values of integrals.

In other cases, however, a Lebesgue integral between finite endpoints may not even be defined, because the integrals of the positive and negative parts of ''f'' are both infinite, but the improper Riemann integral may still exist.  Such cases are "properly improper" integrals, i.e. their values cannot be defined except as such limits.  For example,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty\frac{\sin(x)}{x}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

cannot be interpreted as a Lebesgue integral, since

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty\left|\frac{\sin(x)}{x}\right|\,dx=\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{x}&lt;/math&gt; is nevertheless integrable between any two finite endpoints, and its integral between 0 and ∞ is usually understood as the limit of the integral:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty\frac{\sin(x)}{x}\,dx=\lim_{b\to\infty}\int_0^b\frac{\sin(x)}{x}\,dx=\frac{\pi}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Singularities==
One can speak of the ''singularities'' of an improper integral, meaning those points of the [[extended real number line]] at which limits are used.

==Cauchy principal value==
{{main article|Cauchy principal value}}
Consider the difference in values of two limits:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\to 0^+}\left(\int_{-1}^{-a}\frac{dx}{x}+\int_a^1\frac{dx}{x}\right)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\to 0^+}\left(\int_{-1}^{-a}\frac{dx}{x}+\int_{2a}^1\frac{dx}{x}\right)=-\ln 2.&lt;/math&gt;

The former is the Cauchy principal value of the otherwise ill-defined expression

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^1\frac{dx}{x}{\  }
\left(\mbox{which}\  \mbox{gives}\  -\infty+\infty\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\to\infty}\int_{-a}^a\frac{2x\,dx}{x^2+1}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

but

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\to\infty}\int_{-2a}^a\frac{2x\,dx}{x^2+1}=-\ln 4.&lt;/math&gt;

The former is the principal value of the otherwise ill-defined expression

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{2x\,dx}{x^2+1}{\  }
\left(\mbox{which}\  \mbox{gives}\  -\infty+\infty\right).&lt;/math&gt;

All of the above limits are cases of the [[indeterminate form]] ∞ &amp;minus; ∞.

These [[pathological (mathematics)|pathologies]] do not affect "Lebesgue-integrable" functions, that is, functions the integrals of whose [[absolute value]]s are finite.

==Summability==
An improper integral may diverge in the sense that the limit defining it may not exist.  In this case, there are more sophisticated definitions of the limit which can produce a convergent value for the improper integral.  These are called [[summability]] methods.

One summability method, popular in [[Fourier analysis]], is that of [[Cesàro summation]].  The integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

is Cesàro summable (C,&amp;nbsp;α) if

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\lambda\to\infty}\int_0^\lambda\left(1-\frac{x}{\lambda}\right)^\alpha f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

exists and is finite {{harv|Titchmarsh|1948|loc=§1.15}}.  The value of this limit, should it exist, is the (C,&amp;nbsp;α) sum of the integral.

An integral is (C,&amp;nbsp;0) summable precisely when it exists as an improper integral.  However, there are integrals which are (C,&amp;nbsp;α) summable for α&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 which fail to converge as improper integrals (in the sense of Riemann or Lebesgue). One example is the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty\sin x \,dx&lt;/math&gt;

which fails to exist as an improper integral, but is (C,α) summable for every α&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.  This is an integral version of [[Grandi's series]].

==Multivariable improper integrals==
The improper integral can also be defined for functions of several variables. The definition is slightly different, depending on whether one requires integrating over an unbounded domain, such as &lt;math&gt;\R^2&lt;/math&gt;, or is integrating a function with singularities, like &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=\log(x^2+y^2)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Improper integrals over arbitrary domains===
If &lt;math&gt;f:\R^n\to\R&lt;/math&gt; is a non-negative function that is Riemann integrable over every compact cube of the form &lt;math&gt;[-a,a]^n&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then the improper integral of ''f'' over &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the limit
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\to\infty}\int_{[-a,a]^n}f,&lt;/math&gt;
provided it exists.

A function on an arbitrary domain ''A'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; is extended to a function &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; by zero outside of ''A'':
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}(x)=\begin{cases}f(x)&amp; x\in A\\
0 &amp; x\not\in A
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
The Riemann integral of a function over a bounded domain ''A'' is then defined as the integral of the extended function &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}&lt;/math&gt; over a cube &lt;math&gt;[-a,a]^n&lt;/math&gt; containing ''A'':  
:&lt;math&gt;\int_A f = \int_{[-a,a]^n}\tilde{f}.&lt;/math&gt;
More generally, if ''A'' is unbounded, then the improper Riemann integral over an arbitrary domain in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the limit:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_Af=\lim_{a\to\infty}\int_{A\cap [-a,a]^n}f=\lim_{a\to\infty}\int_{[-a,a]^n}\tilde{f}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Improper integrals with singularities===
If ''f'' is a non-negative function which is unbounded in a domain ''A'', then the improper integral of ''f'' is defined by truncating ''f'' at some cutoff ''M'', integrating the resulting function, and then taking the limit as ''M'' tends to infinity.  That is for &lt;math&gt;M&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, set &lt;math&gt;f_M=\min\{f,M\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then define
:&lt;math&gt;\int_A f = \lim_{M\to\infty}\int_A f_M&lt;/math&gt;
provided this limit exists.

===Functions with both positive and negative values===
These definitions apply for functions that are non-negative.  A more general function ''f'' can be decomposed as a difference of its positive part &lt;math&gt;f_+=\max\{f,0\}&lt;/math&gt; and negative part &lt;math&gt;f_-=\max\{-f,0\}&lt;/math&gt;, so
:&lt;math&gt;f=f_+-f_-&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;f_+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_-&lt;/math&gt; both non-negative functions.  The function ''f'' has an improper Riemann integral if each of &lt;math&gt;f_+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_-&lt;/math&gt; has one, in which case the value of that improper integral is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\int_Af = \int_Af_+ - \int_A f_-.&lt;/math&gt;
In order to exist in this sense, the improper integral necessarily converges absolutely, since
:&lt;math&gt;\int_A|f| = \int_Af_+ + \int_Af_-.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|2005|loc=p. 538}}: "We need to make this stronger definition of convergence in terms of |''f''(''x'')| because cancellation in the integrals can occur in so many different ways in higher dimensions."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ghorpade|Limaye|2010|loc=p. 448}}: "The relevant notion here is that of unconditional convergence." ... "In fact, for improper integrals of such functions, unconditional convergence turns out to be equivalent to absolute convergence."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infix notation''' is the notation commonly used in [[arithmetic]]al and [[logic]]al formulae and statements. It is characterized by the placement of [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]]s between [[operand]]s—"[[infix]]ed operators"—such as the [[plus sign]] in 2 '''+''' 2.

==Usage==
Infix notation is more difficult to [[parsing|parse]] by computers than [[Polish notation|prefix notation]] (e.g. '''+''' 2 2) or [[reverse Polish notation|postfix notation]] (e.g. 2 2 '''+'''). However many [[programming language]]s use it due to its familiarity. It is more used in arithmetic, e.g. 5 '''×''' 6.&lt;ref name="Infix, Postfix and Prefix"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pjj/cs212/fix.html | title=The Implementation and Power of Programming Languages | accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Order of operations==
In infix notation, unlike in prefix or postfix notations, [[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|parentheses]] surrounding groups of operands and operators are necessary to indicate the intended order in which operations are to be performed. In the absence of parentheses, certain precedence rules determine the [[order of operations]].

==Further notations==
Infix notation may also be distinguished from [[Function (mathematics)|function]] notation, where the name of a function suggests a particular operation, and its [[arguments]] are the operands. An example of such a function notation would be '''S'''(1, 3) in which the function S denotes addition: S(1, 3) = 1 + 3 = 4.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11795">This article discusses how [[information theory]] (a branch of mathematics studying the transmission, processing and storage of [[information]]) is related to [[measure theory]] (a branch of mathematics related to [[integral|integration]] and [[probability]]).

== Measures in information theory ==
Many of the concepts in information theory have separate definitions and formulas for [[continuous probability distribution|continuous]] and [[discrete probability distribution|discrete]] cases. For example, [[entropy]] &lt;math&gt;\Eta(X)&lt;/math&gt; is usually defined for discrete random variables, whereas for continuous random variables the related concept of [[differential entropy]], written &lt;math&gt;h(X)&lt;/math&gt;, is used (see Cover and Thomas, 2006, chapter 8). Both these concepts are mathematical [[expected value|expectations]], but the expectation is defined with an [[integral]] for the continuous case, and a sum for the discrete case.

These separate definitions can be more closely related in terms of [[measure theory]].  For discrete random variables, probability mass functions can be considered density functions with respect to the counting measure. Thinking of both the integral and the sum as integration on a measure space allows for a unified treatment. 

Consider the formula for the differential entropy of a continuous [[random variable]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with range &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and [[probability density function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; h(X) = -\int_\mathbb{R} f(x) \log f(x) \,dx. &lt;/math&gt;
This can usually be interpreted as the following [[Riemann–Stieltjes integral]]:
:&lt;math&gt; h(X) = -\int_\mathbb{R} f(x) \log f(x) \,d\mu(x), &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lebesgue measure]].

If instead, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is discrete, with range &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; a finite set, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a probability mass function on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[counting measure]] on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, we can write:
:&lt;math&gt; \Eta(X) = -\sum_{x\in \Omega} f(x) \log f(x) = -\int_\Omega f(x) \log f(x) \,d\nu(x). &lt;/math&gt; 
The integral expression, and the general concept, are identical in the continuous case; the only difference is the measure used.  In both cases the probability density function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem|Radon–Nikodym derivative]] of the [[probability measure]] with respect to the measure against which the integral is taken.

If &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; is the probability measure induced by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then the integral can also be taken directly with respect to &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; h(X) = -\int_X \log \frac{\mathrm d P}{\mathrm d\mu} \,dP, &lt;/math&gt;

If instead of the underlying measure μ we take another probability measure &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;, we are led to the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]]: let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be probability measures over the same space.  Then if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]] with respect to &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math&gt;P \ll Q,&lt;/math&gt; the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem|Radon–Nikodym derivative]] &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm dP}{\mathrm dQ}&lt;/math&gt; exists and the Kullback–Leibler divergence can be expressed in its full generality:

:&lt;math&gt;D_\operatorname{KL}(P \| Q)
   = \int_{\operatorname{supp}P}
     \frac{\mathrm dP}{\mathrm dQ}
     \log \frac{\mathrm dP}{\mathrm dQ}
     \,d Q
   = \int_{\operatorname{supp}P}
     \log \frac{\mathrm dP}{\mathrm dQ}
       \,d P,
&lt;/math&gt;
where the integral runs over the [[support (mathematics)|support]] of &lt;math&gt;P.&lt;/math&gt;  Note that we have dropped the negative sign: the Kullback–Leibler divergence is always non-negative due to [[Gibbs' inequality]].

==Entropy as a "measure"==

[[Image:Entropy-mutual-information-relative-entropy-relation-diagram.svg|thumb|256px|right|[[Venn diagram]] for various information measures associated with correlated variables ''X'' and ''Y''. The area contained by both circles is the joint entropy ''H''(''X'',''Y''). The circle on the left (red and cyan) is the individual entropy ''H''(''X''), with the red being the conditional entropy ''H''(''X''&amp;#124;''Y''). The circle on the right (blue and cyan) is ''H''(''Y''), with the blue being ''H''(''Y''&amp;#124;''X''). The cyan is the mutual information ''I''(''X'';''Y'').]]{{Refimprove section|date=April 2017}}[[Image:VennInfo3Var.svg|thumb|256px|left|[[Venn diagram]] of information theoretic measures for three variables ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''. Each circle represents an individual [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]]: ''H''(''x'') is the lower left circle, ''H''(''y'') the lower right, and ''H''(''z'') is the upper circle. The intersections of any two circles represents the [[mutual information]] for the two associated variables (e.g. ''I''(''x'';''z'') is yellow and gray). The union of any two circles is the [[joint entropy]] for the two associated variables (e.g. ''H''(''x'',''y'') is everything but green). The joint entropy ''H''(''x'',''y'',''z'') of all three variables is the union of all three circles. It is partitioned into 7 pieces, red, blue, and green being the [[Conditional entropy|conditional entropies]] ''H''(''x''&amp;#124;''y'',''z''), ''H''(''y''&amp;#124;''x'',''z''), ''H''(''z''&amp;#124;''x'',''y'') respectively, yellow, magenta and cyan being the [[conditional mutual information|conditional mutual informations]] ''I''(''x'';''z''&amp;#124;''y''), ''I''(''y'';''z''&amp;#124;''x'') and ''I''(''x'';''y''&amp;#124;''z'') respectively, and gray being the [[multivariate mutual information]] ''I''(''x'';''y'';''z''). The multivariate mutual information is the only one of all that may be negative.]]

There is an analogy between [[Claude Elwood Shannon|Shannon]]'s basic "[[Quantities of information|measures]]" of the [[information entropy|information]] content of random variables and a [[measure theory|measure]] over sets.  Namely the [[joint entropy]], [[conditional entropy]], and [[mutual information]] can be considered as the measure of a [[union (set theory)|set union]], [[set difference]], and [[intersection (set theory)|set intersection]], respectively (Reza pp.&amp;nbsp;106–108).

If we associate the existence of abstract [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] &lt;math&gt;\tilde X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde Y&lt;/math&gt; to arbitrary [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] [[random variable]]s ''X'' and ''Y'', somehow representing the [[information entropy|information]] borne by ''X'' and ''Y'', respectively, such that:
* &lt;math&gt;\mu(\tilde X \cap \tilde Y) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; whenever ''X'' and ''Y'' are unconditionally [[statistical independence|independent]], and
* &lt;math&gt;\tilde X = \tilde Y&lt;/math&gt; whenever ''X'' and ''Y'' are such that either one is completely determined by the other (i.e. by a bijection);

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a [[signed measure]] over these sets, and we set:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Eta(X) &amp; = \mu(\tilde X), \\
\Eta(Y) &amp; = \mu(\tilde Y), \\
\Eta(X,Y) &amp; = \mu(\tilde X \cup \tilde Y), \\
\Eta(X\mid Y) &amp; = \mu(\tilde X \setminus \tilde Y), \\
\operatorname{I}(X;Y) &amp; = \mu(\tilde X \cap \tilde Y);
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

we find that [[Claude Elwood Shannon|Shannon]]'s "measure" of information content satisfies all the postulates and basic properties of a formal [[signed measure]] over sets, as commonly illustrated in an '''[[information diagram]]'''. This allows the sum of two measures to be written:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mu(A)+\mu(B)=\mu(A\cup B)+\mu(A\cap B)
&lt;/math&gt;

and the analog of [[Bayes' theorem]] (&lt;math&gt;\mu(A)+\mu(B\setminus A)=\mu(B)+\mu(A\setminus B)&lt;/math&gt;) allows the difference of two measures to be written:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mu(A)-\mu(B)=\mu(A\setminus B)-\mu(B\setminus A)
&lt;/math&gt;

This can be a handy [[mnemonic device]] in some situations, e.g.

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Eta(X,Y) &amp; =\Eta(X)+\Eta(Y\mid X) &amp; \mu(\tilde X \cup \tilde Y) &amp; =\mu(\tilde X)+\mu(\tilde Y \setminus \tilde X) \\
\operatorname{I}(X;Y) &amp; =\Eta(X)-\Eta(X\mid Y) &amp; \mu(\tilde X \cap \tilde Y) &amp; =\mu(\tilde X)-\mu(\tilde X \setminus \tilde Y)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that measures (expectation values of the logarithm) of true probabilities are called "entropy" and generally represented by the letter ''H'', while other measures are often referred to as "information" or "correlation" and generally represented by the letter ''I''. For notational simplicity, the letter ''I'' is sometimes used for all measures.

==Multivariate mutual information==
{{main|Multivariate mutual information}}
Certain extensions to the definitions of Shannon's basic measures of information are necessary to deal with the [[Sigma-algebra|σ-algebra]] generated by the sets that would be associated to three or more arbitrary random variables. (See Reza pp.&amp;nbsp;106–108 for an informal but rather complete discussion.) Namely &lt;math&gt;\Eta(X,Y,Z,\cdots)&lt;/math&gt; needs to be defined in the obvious way as the entropy of a joint distribution, and a multivariate [[mutual information]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}(X;Y;Z;\cdots)&lt;/math&gt; defined in a suitable manner so that we can set:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Eta(X,Y,Z,\cdots) &amp; = \mu(\tilde X \cup \tilde Y \cup \tilde Z \cup \cdots), \\
\operatorname{I}(X;Y;Z;\cdots) &amp; = \mu(\tilde X \cap \tilde Y \cap \tilde Z \cap \cdots);
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

in order to define the (signed) measure over the whole σ-algebra.  There is no single universally accepted definition for the mutivariate mutual information, but the one that corresponds here to the measure of a set intersection is due to Fano (1966: p. 57-59). The definition is recursive.  As a base case the mutual information of a single random variable is defined to be its entropy: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}(X)=\Eta(X)&lt;/math&gt;.  Then for &lt;math&gt;n\geq 2&lt;/math&gt; we set
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}(X_1; \cdots; X_n) = \operatorname{I}(X_1; \cdots; X_{n-1}) - \operatorname{I}(X_1; \cdots; X_{n-1}\mid X_n),&lt;/math&gt;
where the [[conditional mutual information]] is defined as
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}(X_1; \cdots; X_{n-1}\mid X_n) = \mathbb E_{X_n}\big(\operatorname{I}(X_1; \cdots; X_{n-1})\mid X_n\big).&lt;/math&gt;
The first step in the recursion yields Shannon's definition &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}(X_1;X_2)=\Eta(X_1)-\Eta(X_1\mid X_2).&lt;/math&gt;  The multivariate mutual information (same as [[interaction information]] but for a change in sign) of three or more random variables can be negative as well as positive: Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be two independent fair coin flips, and let ''Z'' be their [[exclusive or]]. Then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}(X;Y;Z) = - 1&lt;/math&gt; bit.

Many other variations are possible for three or more random variables: for example, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}(X,Y;Z)&lt;/math&gt; is the mutual information of the joint distribution of ''X'' and ''Y'' relative to ''Z'', and can be interpreted as &lt;math&gt;\mu((\tilde X \cup \tilde Y) \cap \tilde Z).&lt;/math&gt;  Many more complicated expressions can be built this way, and still have meaning, e.g. &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{I}(X,Y;Z\mid W),&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \Eta(X,Z\mid W,Y).&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3926">[[File:Roma jakobson theory.png|right|thumb|The six factors of an effective verbal communication. To each one corresponds a communication function (not displayed in this picture).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Middleton |first=Richard |date=April 1, 1990 |title=Studying Popular Music |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=FJlKLwEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA241 |page=241 |location=Philadelphia, UK |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education]] |isbn=0-335-15275-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Roman Jakobson]] defined six '''functions of language''' (or '''communication functions'''), according to which an effective act of [[verbal communication]] can be described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Waugh |first=Linda R. |year=1980 |url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/1772352 |title=The Poetic Function in the Theory of Roman Jakobson |journal=[[Poetics Today]] |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=57-82 |doi=10.2307/1772352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the functions has an associated factor. For this work, Jakobson was influenced by [[Karl Bühler]]'s [[organon model]], to which he added the poetic, phatic and metalingual functions.

==The six functions of language==
* The ''referential function'': corresponds to the factor of Context and describes a situation, object or mental state. The descriptive statements of the referential function can consist of both definite descriptions and [[deixis|deictic]] words, e.g. "The autumn leaves have all fallen now." Similarly, the referential function is associated with an element whose true value is under questioning especially when the truth value is identical in both the real and assumptive universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://paperwritten.com/blog/the-real-functions-of-language/ |title=The Real Functions of Language |date=January 16, 2017 |access-date=August 18, 2017 |journal=Paper Written}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''poetic function'': focuses on "the message for its own sake"{{sfn|Duranti|1997}} (the code itself, and how it is used) and is the operative function in poetry as well as slogans.
* The ''emotive&lt;ref&gt;Alternatively called "expressive" or "affective".&lt;/ref&gt; function'': relates to the Addresser (sender) and is best exemplified by [[interjections]] and other sound changes that do not alter the [[denotation|denotative meaning]] of an utterance but do add information about the Addresser's (speaker's) internal state, e.g. "Wow, what a view!"
* The ''conative function'': engages the Addressee (receiver) directly and is best illustrated by [[vocative]]s and [[imperative mood|imperatives]], e.g. "Tom! Come inside and eat!"
* The ''[[phatic]] function'': is language for the sake of interaction and is therefore associated with the Contact/Channel factor. The Phatic Function can be observed in greetings and casual discussions of the weather, particularly with strangers. It also provides the keys to open, maintain, verify or close the communication channel: "Hello?", "Ok?", "Hummm", "Bye"...
* The metalingual (alternatively called "metalinguistic" or "reflexive") function: is the use of language (what Jakobson calls "Code") to discuss or describe itself.

==Schooling==
Folkman was a [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition|Putnam Fellow]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/awards/putnam.html Putnam competition results], Mathematical Association of America, retrieved 2010-10-17.&lt;/ref&gt; He received his Ph.D. in 1964 from [[Princeton University]], under the supervision of Milnor, with a thesis entitled ''Equivariant Maps of Spheres into the Classical Groups''.&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|name=John Hal Folkman|id=22443}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
[[File:Folkman graph alt.svg|thumb|Jon Folkman found the [[semi-symmetric graph]] with the fewest possible vertices, the [[Folkman graph]].]]

Jon Folkman contributed important theorems in many areas of [[combinatorics]].

In [[geometric combinatorics]], Folkman is known for his pioneering and posthumously-published studies of [[oriented matroid]]s; in particular, the Folkman–Lawrence topological representation theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Folkman-Lawrence representation theorem is called the "Lawrence representation theorem" by [[Günter&amp;nbsp;M.

&lt;/ref&gt; In [[lattice (order)|lattice]] theory, Folkman solved an [[open problem]] on the foundations of [[enumerative combinatorics|combinatorics]] by proving a [[conjecture]] of [[Gian-Carlo Rota|Gian–Carlo Rota]]; in proving Rota's conjecture, Folkman characterized the structure of the [[homology (mathematics)|homology groups]] of [[matroid|"geometric lattices"]] in terms of the [[free group|free]] [[Abelian group]]s of [[rank of a group|finite rank]].&lt;ref&gt;

In [[convex geometry]], Folkman worked with his [[RAND Corporation|RAND]] colleague [[Lloyd Shapley]] to prove the [[Shapley–Folkman lemma|Shapley–Folkman lemma and theorem]]: Their results suggest that [[Minkowski addition|sums of sets]] are approximately convex; in [[mathematical economics]] their results are used to explain why [[general equilibrium theory|economies with many agents]] have approximate [[economic equilibrium|equilibria]], despite individual nonconvexities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In [[additive combinatorics]], [[Folkman's theorem]] states that for each assignment of finitely many colors to the positive integers, there exist arbitrarily large sets of integers all of whose nonempty sums have the same color; the name was chosen as a memorial to Folkman by his friends.&lt;ref&gt;Page 81 in {{Citation |authorlink=Ronald Graham |first=R. |last=Graham |first2=B. |last2=Rothschild |authorlink3=Joel Spencer |first3=J. H. |last3=Spencer |title=Ramsey Theory |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |year=1990 |isbn=0-471-50046-1 |edition=2nd }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ramsey theory]], the Rado–Folkman–Sanders theorem describes "[[partition regular]]" sets.

===The Folkman Number F(p, q; r)===
For r &gt; max{p, q}, let F(p, q; r) denote the minimum number of
vertices in a graph G that has the following properties:
# G contains no complete subgraph on r vertices,
# in any green-red coloring of the edges of G there is either a green K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; or a red K&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; subgraph.

Some results are

*F(2, 3; 4) &lt; 1000 ([[Vojtěch Rödl]], Andrzej Dudek)

==Brain cancer and despair==
[[File:Erdos head budapest fall 1992.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Erdős]] visited Jon Folkman after Folkman awoke from surgery for brain cancer. To restore Folkman's confidence, Erdős immediately challenged him to solve [[mathematical problem]]s.&lt;ref name="Erdos"/&gt;]]

In the late 1960s, Folkman suffered from [[brain cancer]]; while hospitalized, Folkman was visited repeatedly by [[Ronald Graham]] and [[Paul Erdős]]. After his brain surgery, Folkman was despairing that he had lost his mathematical skills. As soon as Folkman received Graham and Erdős at the hospital, Erdős challenged Folkman with mathematical problems, helping to rebuild his [[Self-confidence|confidence]].

Folkman later purchased a gun and killed himself. Folkman's supervisor at RAND, [[Delbert Ray Fulkerson]], blamed himself for failing to notice suicidal behaviors in Folkman. Years later Fulkerson also killed himself.&lt;ref name="Erdos"&gt;{{citation|title=[[The man who loved only numbers|The man who loved only numbers: the story of Paul Erdős and the search for mathematical truth]]| first=Paul|last=Hoffman|authorlink=Paul Hoffman (science writer)|publisher=Hyperion|year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7868-6362-4|pages=109–110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3906">'''Logic redundancy''' occurs in a [[logic gate|digital gate]] network containing circuitry that does not affect the static logic function. There are several reasons why logic redundancy may exist. One reason is that it may have been added deliberately to suppress transient glitches (thus causing a [[race condition]]) in the output signals by having two or more product terms overlap with a third one.

Consider the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;
Y = A B + \overline{A} C + B C.
&lt;/math&gt;

The third product term &lt;math&gt;BC&lt;/math&gt; is a redundant [[Consensus theorem|consensus term]]. If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; switches from 1 to 0 while &lt;math&gt;B = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; remains 1.  During the transition of signal &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in logic gates, both the first and second term may be 0 momentarily. The third term prevents a glitch since its value of 1 in this case is not affected by the transition of signal &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

Another reason for logic redundancy is poor design practices which unintentionally result in logically redundantly terms. This causes an unnecessary increase in network complexity, and possibly hampering the ability to test manufactured designs using traditional test methods (single stuck-at fault models). (Note: testing might be possible using [[Iddq testing|IDDQ]] models.)

==Removing logic redundancy==
Logic redundancy is, in general, not desired.
Redundancy, by definition, requires extra parts (in this case: logical terms) which raises the cost of implementation (either actual cost of physical parts or [[CPU time]] to process).
Logic redundancy can be removed by several well-known techniques, such as [[Karnaugh map]]s, the [[Quine–McCluskey algorithm]], and the [[Espresso heuristic logic minimizer|heuristic computer method]].

==Adding logic redundancy==
{{Main|hazard (logic)}}

[[Image:K-map 6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.svg|thumb|A k-map showing a particular logic function]]

In some cases it may be desirable to ''add'' logic redundancy.  One of those cases is to avoid [[race condition]]s whereby an output can fluctuate because different terms are "racing" to turn off and on.  To explain this in more concrete terms the [[Karnaugh map]] to the right shows the minterms and maxterms for the following function:

:&lt;math&gt;f(A, B, C, D) = E(6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14).\ &lt;/math&gt;

The boxes represent the minimal AND/OR terms needed to implement this function:

:&lt;math&gt;F = A\overline{C} + A\overline{B} + BC\overline{D}.&lt;/math&gt;

The k-map visually shows where [[race condition]]s occur in the minimal expression by having gaps between minterms or gaps between maxterms.  For example, the gap between the blue and green rectangles.  If the input &lt;math&gt;ABCD=1110&lt;/math&gt; were to change to &lt;math&gt;ABCD=1010&lt;/math&gt; then a race will occur between &lt;math&gt;BC\overline{D}&lt;/math&gt; turning off and &lt;math&gt;A\overline{B}&lt;/math&gt; turning off.
If the blue term switches off before the green turns on then the output will fluctuate and may register as 0.
Another race condition is between the blue and the red for transition of &lt;math&gt;ABCD=1110&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;ABCD=1100&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:K-map 6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 anti-race.svg|thumb|left|Above k-map with the &lt;math&gt;A\overline{D}&lt;/math&gt; term added to avoid race hazards]]

The race condition is removed by adding in logic redundancy, which is contrary to the aims of using a k-map in the first place.
Both minterm race conditions are covered by addition of the yellow term &lt;math&gt;A\overline{D}&lt;/math&gt;.
(The maxterm race condition is covered by addition of the green-bordered grey term &lt;math&gt;A+\overline{D}&lt;/math&gt;.)

In this case, the addition of logic redundancy has stabilized the output to avoid output fluctuations because terms are racing each other to change state.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28236">In [[computational geometry]], a '''maximum disjoint set (MDS)''' is a largest set of non-overlapping geometric shapes selected from a given set of candidate shapes.

Finding an MDS is important in applications such as [[automatic label placement]], [[VLSI]] circuit design, and cellular [[frequency division multiplexing]].

Every set of non-overlapping shapes is an [[independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] in the [[intersection graph]] of the shapes. Therefore, the MDS problem is a special case of the [[maximum independent set]] (MIS) problem. Both problems are [[NP complete]], but finding a MDS may be easier than finding a MIS in two respects:
* For the general MIS problem, the best known exact algorithms are exponential. In some geometric intersection graphs, there are sub-exponential algorithms for finding a MDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ravi | first1 = S. S. | last2 = Hunt | first2 = H.

* The general MIS problem is hard to approximate and doesn't even have a constant-factor approximation. In some geometric intersection graphs, there are [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]]s (PTAS) for finding a MDS.

The MDS problem can be generalized by assigning a different weight to each shape and searching for a disjoint set with a maximum total weight.

In the following text, MDS(''C'') denotes the maximum disjoint set in a set ''C''.

== Greedy algorithms ==
Given a set ''C'' of shapes, an approximation to MDS(''C'') can be found by the following [[greedy algorithm]]:

* INITIALIZATION: Initialize an empty set, ''S''.
* SEARCH: For every shape ''x'' in ''C'':
*# Calculate ''N(x)'' - the subset of all shapes in ''C''  that intersect ''x'' (including ''x'' itself). 
*# Calculate the largest independent set in this subset: ''MDS(N(x))''.
*# Select an ''x'' such that ''|MDS(N(x))|'' is minimized.
* Add ''x'' to ''S''. 
* Remove ''x'' and ''N(x)'' from ''C''.
* If there are shapes in ''C'', go back to Search.
* END: return the set ''S''.

For every shape ''x'' that we add to ''S'', we lose the shapes in ''N(x)'', because they are intersected by ''x'' and thus cannot be added to ''S'' later on. However, some of these shapes themselves intersect each other, and thus in any case it is not possible that they all be in the optimal solution ''MDS(S)''. The largest subset of shapes that ''can'' all be in the optimal solution is ''MDS(N(x))''. Therefore, selecting an ''x'' that minimizes ''|MDS(N(x))|'' minimizes the loss from adding ''x'' to ''S''.

In particular, if we can guarantee that there is an ''x'' for which ''|MDS(N(x))|'' is bounded by a constant (say, ''M''), then this greedy algorithm yields a constant ''M''-factor approximation, as we can guarantee that:

&lt;math&gt;|S|\geq\frac{|MDS(C)|}{M}&lt;/math&gt;

Such an upper bound ''M'' exists for several interesting cases:

=== 1-dimensional intervals: exact polynomial algorithm  ===
[[File:IntervalSelection.svg|20px|right]]
When ''C'' is a set of intervals on a line, ''M''=1, and thus the greedy algorithm finds the exact MDS. To see this, assume w.l.o.g. that the intervals are vertical, and let ''x'' be the interval with the ''highest bottom endpoint''. All other intervals intersected by ''x'' must cross its bottom endpoint. Therefore, all intervals in ''N(x)'' intersect each other, and ''MDS(N(x))'' has a size of at most 1 (see figure).

Therefore, in the 1-dimensional case, the MDS can be found exactly in time ''O''(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n''):&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Agarwal | first1 = P. K. | last2 = Van Kreveld | first2 = M. | last3 = Suri | first3 = S. | doi = 10.1016/s0925-7721(98)00028-5 | title = Label placement by maximum independent set in rectangles | journal = Computational Geometry | volume = 11 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 209 | year = 1998 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Sort the intervals in ascending order of their bottom endpoints (this takes time ''O''(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'')).
# Add an interval with the highest bottom endpoint, and delete all intervals intersecting it.
# Continue until no intervals remain.

This algorithm is analogous to the [[earliest deadline first scheduling]] solution to the [[interval scheduling]] problem.

In contrast to the 1-dimensional case, in 2 or more dimensions the MDS problem becomes NP-complete, and thus has either exact super-polynomial algorithms or approximate polynomial algorithms.

=== Fat shapes: constant-factor approximations  ===
[[File:IntersectingUnitDisks.svg|40px|right]]
When ''C'' is a set of unit disks, ''M''=3,&lt;ref name=Marathe1995&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Marathe | first1 = M. V. | last2 = Breu | first2 = H. | last3 = Hunt | first3 = H. B. | last4 = Ravi | first4 = S. S. | last5 = Rosenkrantz | first5 = D. J. | title = Simple heuristics for unit disk graphs | doi = 10.1002/net.3230250205 | journal = Networks | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 59 | year = 1995 | pmid =  | pmc = | arxiv = math/9409226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because the leftmost disk (the disk whose center has the smallest ''x'' coordinate) intersects at most 3 other disjoint disks (see figure). Therefore the greedy algorithm yields a 3-approximation, i.e., it finds a disjoint set with a size of at least ''MDS(C)''/3.

Similarly, when ''C'' is a set of axis-parallel unit squares, ''M''=2.

[[File:IntersectingDisks.svg|50px|right]]
When ''C'' is a set of arbitrary-size disks, ''M''=5, because the disk with the smallest radius intersects at most 5 other disjoint disks (see figure).

Similarly, when ''C'' is a set of arbitrary-size axis-parallel squares, ''M''=4.

Other constants can be calculated for other [[regular polygon]]s.&lt;ref name=Marathe1995 /&gt;

== Divide-and-conquer algorithms ==
The most common approach to finding a MDS is divide-and-conquer. A typical algorithm in this approach looks like the following:

# Divide the given set of shapes into two or more subsets, such that the shapes in each subset cannot overlap the shapes in other subsets because of geometric considerations.
# Recursively find the MDS in each subset separately.
# Return the union of the MDSs from all subsets.

The main challenge with this approach is to find a geometric way to divide the set into subsets. This may require to discard a small number of shapes that do not fit into any one of the subsets, as explained in the following subsections.

=== Axis-parallel rectangles: Logarithmic-factor approximation ===
Let ''C'' be a set of ''n'' axis-parallel rectangles in the plane. The following algorithm finds a disjoint set with a size of at least &lt;math&gt;\frac{|MDS(C)|}{\log{n}}&lt;/math&gt; in time 
&lt;math&gt;O(n \log{n})&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;

* INITIALIZATION: sort the horizontal edges of the given rectangles by their ''y''-coordinate, and the vertical edges by their ''x''-coordinate (this step takes time ''O''(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'')).
* STOP CONDITION: If there are at most ''n''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;2 shapes, compute the MDS directly and return.
* RECURSIVE PART: 
*# Let &lt;math&gt;x_\mathrm{med}&lt;/math&gt; be the median ''x''-coordinate.
*# Partition the input rectangles into three groups according to their relation to the line &lt;math&gt;x=x_\mathrm{med}&lt;/math&gt;: those entirely to its left (&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{left}&lt;/math&gt;), those entirely to its right (&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{right}&lt;/math&gt;), and those intersected by it (&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{int}&lt;/math&gt;). By construction, the cardinalities of &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{left}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{right}&lt;/math&gt; are at most ''n''/2.
*# Recursively compute an ''approximate'' MDS in &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{left}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{left}&lt;/math&gt;) and in &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{right}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{right}&lt;/math&gt;), and calculate their union. By construction, the rectangles in &lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{left}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{right}&lt;/math&gt; are all disjoint, so &lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{left} \cup M_\mathrm{right}&lt;/math&gt; is a disjoint set.
*# Compute an ''exact'' MDS in &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{int}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{int}&lt;/math&gt;). Since all rectangles in &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{int}&lt;/math&gt; intersect a single vertical line &lt;math&gt;x=x_\mathrm{med}&lt;/math&gt;, this computation is equivalent to finding an MDS from a set of intervals, and can be solved exactly in time ''O(n log n)'' (see above).
* Return either &lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{left} \cup M_\mathrm{right}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{int}&lt;/math&gt; – whichever of them is larger.

It is provable by induction that, at the last step, either &lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{left} \cup M_\mathrm{right}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{int}&lt;/math&gt; have a cardinality of at least &lt;math&gt;\frac{|MDS(C)|}{\log{n}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The approximation factor has been reduced to &lt;math&gt;O(\log{\log{n}})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1137/1.9781611973068.97| chapter = Maximum Independent Set of Rectangles| title = Proceedings of the Twentieth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms| year = 2009| last1 = Chalermsook | first1 = P. | last2 = Chuzhoy | first2 = J. | author2-link = Julia Chuzhoy | isbn = 978-0-89871-680-1| pages = 892}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generalized to the case in which rectangles have different weights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-22935-0_11| chapter = Coloring and Maximum Independent Set of Rectangles| title = Approximation, Randomization, and Combinatorial Optimization.

=== Axis-parallel rectangles with the same height: 2-approximation ===
Let ''C'' be a set of ''n'' axis-parallel rectangles in the plane, all with the same height ''H'' but with varying lengths. The following algorithm finds a disjoint set with a size of at least |MDS(''C'')|/2 in time ''O''(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n''):&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;

* Draw ''m'' horizontal lines, such that:
*# The separation between two lines is strictly more than ''H''.
*# Each line intersects at least one rectangle (hence ''m''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'').
*# Each rectangle is intersected by exactly one line.
* Since the height of all rectangles is ''H'', it is not possible that a rectangle is intersected by more than one line. Therefore the lines partition the set of rectangles into ''m'' subsets (&lt;math&gt;R_i,\ldots,R_m&lt;/math&gt;) – each subset includes the rectangles intersected by a single line.
* For each subset &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;, compute an exact MDS &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt;  using the one-dimensional greedy algorithm (see above).
* By construction, the rectangles in (&lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;) can intersect only rectangles in &lt;math&gt;R_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; or in &lt;math&gt;R_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, each of the following two unions is a disjoint sets:
** Union of odd MDSs: &lt;math&gt;M_1 \cup M_3 \cup \cdots &lt;/math&gt; 
** Union of even MDSs: &lt;math&gt;M_2 \cup M_4 \cup \cdots &lt;/math&gt; 
* Return the largest of these two unions. Its size must be at least&amp;nbsp;|MDS|/2.

=== Axis-parallel rectangles with the same height: PTAS ===
Let ''C'' be a set of ''n'' axis-parallel rectangles in the plane, all with the same height but with varying lengths. There is an algorithm that finds a disjoint set with a size of at least |MDS(''C'')|/(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/''k'') in time ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2''k''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;), for every constant ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;

The algorithm is an improvement of the above-mentioned 2-approximation, by combining [[dynamic programming]] with the shifting technique of.&lt;ref name=HochbaumMaass1985 /&gt;

This algorithm can be generalized to ''d'' dimensions. If the labels have the same size in all dimensions except one, it is possible to find a similar approximation by applying [[dynamic programming]] along one of the dimensions. This also reduces the time to n^O(1/e).&lt;ref name=Chan2003 /&gt;

=== Fat objects with identical sizes: PTAS  ===
Let ''C'' be a set of ''n'' squares or circles of identical size. There is a [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]] for finding an MDS using a simple shifted-grid strategy. It finds a solution within (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''e'') of the maximum in time ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''O''(1/''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt; time and linear space.&lt;ref name=HochbaumMaass1985&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hochbaum | first1 = D.

=== Fat objects with arbitrary sizes: PTAS ===
Let ''C'' be a set of ''n'' [[fat object]]s (e.g. squares or circles) of arbitrary sizes. There is a [[polynomial-time approximation scheme|PTAS]] for finding an MDS based on multi-level grid alignment. It has been discovered by two groups in approximately the same time, and described in two different ways.

'''Version 1''' finds a disjoint set with a size of at least (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1/''k'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;|MDS(''C'')| in time ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''O''(''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;, for every constant ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1:&lt;ref name=Erlebach2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Erlebach | first1 = T. | last2 = Jansen | first2 = K. | last3 = Seidel | first3 = E. | doi = 10.1137/s0097539702402676 | title = Polynomial-Time Approximation Schemes for Geometric Intersection Graphs | journal = SIAM Journal on Computing | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 1302 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scale the disks so that the smallest disk has diameter 1. Partition the disks to levels, based on the logarithm of their size. I.e., the ''j''-th level contains all disks with diameter between (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt; and (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;''j''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, for ''j''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;0 (the smallest disk is in level 0).

For each level ''j'', impose a grid on the plane that consists of lines that are (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;''j''+1&lt;/sup&gt; apart from each other. By construction, every disk can intersect at most one horizontal line and one vertical line from its level.

For every ''r'', ''s'' between 0 and ''k'', define ''D''(''r'',''s'') as the subset of disks that are not intersected by any horizontal line whose index modulo ''k'' is ''r'', nor by any vertical line whose index modulu ''k'' is ''s''. By the [[pigeonhole principle]], there is at least one pair ''(r,s)'' such that &lt;math&gt;|\mathrm{MDS}(D(r,s))| \geq (1-\frac{1}{k})^2 \cdot |\mathrm{MDS}|&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., we can find the MDS only in ''D''(''r'',''s'') and miss only a small fraction of the disks in the optimal solution:

* For all ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; possible values of ''r'',''s'' (0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''r'',''s''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''k''), calculate ''D''(''r'',''s'') using [[dynamic programming]].
* Return the largest of these ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sets.

[[Image:Point quadtree.svg|thumb|200px|A region quadtree with point data]]
'''Version 2''' finds a disjoint set with a size of at least (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2/''k'')&amp;middot;|MDS(''C'')| in time ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''O''(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;, for every constant ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name=Chan2003&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/s0196-6774(02)00294-8 | last1 = Chan | first1 = T. M. | year = 2003 | title = Polynomial-time approximation schemes for packing and piercing fat objects | journal = Journal of Algorithms | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 178–189 | publisher =  | jstor =  | url =  | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The algorithm uses shifted [[quadtree]]s. The key concept of the algorithm is ''alignment'' to the quadtree grid. An object of size ''r'' is called ''k-aligned'' (where ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 is a constant) if it is inside a quadtree cell of size at most ''kr'' (''R''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''kr'').

By definition, a ''k''-aligned object that intersects the boundary of a quatree cell of size ''R'' must have a size of at least ''R''/''k'' (''r'' &gt; ''R''/''k''). The boundary of a cell of size ''R'' can be covered by 4''k'' squares of size ''R''/''k''; hence the number of disjoint fat objects intersecting the boundary of that cell is at most 4''kc'', where ''c'' is a constant measuring the fatness of the objects.

Therefore, if all objects are fat and ''k''-aligned, it is possible to find the exact maximum disjoint set in time ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''O''(''kc'')&lt;/sup&gt; using a divide-and-conquer algorithm. Start with a quadtree cell that contains all objects. Then recursively divide it to smaller quadtree cells, find the maximum in each smaller cell, and combine the results to get the maximum in the larger cell. Since the number of disjoint fat objects intersecting the boundary of every quadtree cell is bounded by 4''kc'', we can simply "guess" which objects intersect the boundary in the optimal solution, and then apply divide-and-conquer to the objects inside.

If ''almost'' all objects are ''k''-aligned, we can just discard the objects that are not ''k''-aligned, and find a maximum disjoint set of the remaining objects in time ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''O''(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;. This results in a (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''e'') approximation, where e is the fraction of objects that are not ''k''-aligned.

If most objects are not ''k''-aligned, we can try to make them ''k''-aligned by ''shifting'' the grid in multiples of (1/''k'',1/''k''). First, scale the objects such that they are all contained in the unit square. Then, consider ''k'' shifts of the grid: (0,0), (1/''k'',1/''k''), (2/''k'',2/''k''), ..., ((''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/''k'',(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/''k''). I.e., for each ''j'' in {0,...,''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1}, consider a shift of the grid in (j/k,j/k). It is possible to prove that every label will be 2''k''-aligned for at least ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2 values of&amp;nbsp;''j''. Now, for every ''j'', discard the objects that are not ''k''-aligned in the (''j''/''k'',''j''/''k'') shift, and find a maximum disjoint set of the remaining objects. Call that set ''A''(''j''). Call the real maximum disjoint set is&amp;nbsp;''A''*. Then:

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0,\ldots,k-1}{|A(j)|} \geq (k-2)|A*|&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the largest ''A''(''j'') has a size of at least: (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2/''k'')|''A''*|. The return value of the algorithm is the largest ''A''(''j''); the approximation factor is (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2/''k''), and the run time is ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''O''(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;. We can make the approximation factor as small as we want, so this is a [[polynomial-time approximation scheme|PTAS]].

Both versions can be generalized to ''d'' dimensions (with different approximation ratios) and to the weighted case.

== Geometric separator algorithms ==
Several divide-and-conquer algorithms are based on a certain [[geometric separator]] theorem. A geometric separator is a line or shape that separates a given set of shapes to two smaller subsets, such that the number of shapes lost during the division is relatively small. This allows both [[polynomial-time approximation scheme|PTAS]]s and sub-exponential exact algorithms, as explained below.

=== Fat objects with arbitrary sizes: PTAS using geometric separators ===
Let ''C'' be a set of ''n'' [[fat object]]s of arbitrary sizes. The following algorithm finds a disjoint set with a size of at least (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''O''({{radic|''b''}}))&amp;middot;|MDS(''C'')| in time ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''O''(''b'')&lt;/sup&gt;, for every constant ''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name=Chan2003 /&gt;

The algorithm is based on the following geometric separator theorem, which can be proved similarly to [[Geometric separator#Proof|the proof of the existence of geometric separator for disjoint squares]]:

::For every set ''C'' of fat objects, there is a rectangle that partitions ''C'' into three subsets of objects – ''C&lt;sub&gt;inside&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''C&lt;sub&gt;outside&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;boundary&lt;/sub&gt;, such that:
::* |MDS(''C''&lt;sub&gt;inside&lt;/sub&gt;)| ≤ ''a''|MDS(''C'')|
::* |MDS(''C''&lt;sub&gt;outside&lt;/sub&gt;)| ≤ a|MDS(''C'')|
::* |MDS(''C''&lt;sub&gt;boundary&lt;/sub&gt;)|  ''c''{{radic|{{mabs|MDS(''C'')}}}}

where ''a'' and ''c'' are constants. If we could calculate MDS(''C'') exactly, we could make the constant ''a'' as low as 2/3 by a proper selection of the separator rectangle. But since we can only approximate MDS(''C'') by a constant factor, the constant ''a'' must be larger. Fortunately, ''a'' remains a constant independent of |''C''|.

This separator theorem allows to build the following PTAS:

Select a constant ''b''. Check all possible combinations of up to ''b''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 labels.
* If |MDS(''C'')| has a size of at most ''b'' (i.e. all sets of ''b''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 labels are not disjoint) then just return that MDS and exit. This step takes ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''O''(''b'')&lt;/sup&gt; time.
* Otherwise, use a geometric separator to separate ''C'' to two subsets. Find the approximate MDS in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;inside&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;outside&lt;/sub&gt; separately, and return their combination as the approximate MDS in ''C''.

Let ''E''(''m'') be the error of the above algorithm when the optimal MDS size is MDS(''C'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''. When ''m''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''b'', the error is 0 because the maximum disjoint set is calculated exactly; when ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''b'', the error increases by at most ''c''{{radic|''m''}} the number of labels intersected by the separator. The worst case for the algorithm is when the split in each step is in the maximum possible ratio which is ''a'':(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''). Therefore the error function satisfies the following recurrence relation:

: &lt;math&gt;E(m) = 0\ \ \ \ \text{ if } m\leq b&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;E(m) = E(a\cdot m) + E((1-a)\cdot m) + c\cdot\sqrt{m} \text{ if } m&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;

The solution to this recurrence is:

: &lt;math&gt;E(m) = (\frac{0}{b}+\frac{c}{\sqrt{b}(\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{1-a}-1)})\cdot m - \frac{c}{\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{1-a}-1}\cdot\sqrt{m}.&lt;/math&gt;

i.e., &lt;math&gt;E(m)=O(m/\sqrt{b})&lt;/math&gt;. We can make the approximation factor as small as we want by a proper selection of ''b''.

This PTAS is more space-efficient than the PTAS based on quadtrees, and can handle a generalization where the objects may slide, but it cannot handle the weighted case.

=== Disks with a bounded size-ratio: exact sub-exponential algorithm ===
Let ''C'' be a set of ''n'' disks, such that the ratio between the largest radius and the smallest radius is at most ''r''. The following algorithm finds MDS(''C'') exactly in time &lt;math&gt;2^{O(r\cdot \sqrt{n})}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Fu&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fu | first1 = B. | title = Theory and application of width bounded geometric separators | doi = 10.1016/j.jcss.2010.05.003 | journal = Journal of Computer and System Sciences | volume = 77 | issue = 2 | pages = 379–392 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The algorithm is based on a [[geometric separator#Separators that are width-bounded strips between parallel hyperplanes|width-bounded geometric separator]] on the set ''Q'' of the centers of all disks in ''C''. This separator theorem allows to build the following exact algorithm:
* Find a separator line such that at most 2''n''/3 centers are to its right (''C''&lt;sub&gt;right&lt;/sub&gt;), at most 2''n''/3 centers are to its left (''C''&lt;sub&gt;left&lt;/sub&gt;), and at most ''O''({{radic|''n''}}) centers are at a distance of less than ''r''/2 from the line (''C''&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;). 
* Consider all possible non-overlapping subsets of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;. There are at most &lt;math&gt;2^{O(r\cdot \sqrt{n})}&lt;/math&gt; such subsets. For each such subset, recursively compute the MDS of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;left&lt;/sub&gt; and the MDS of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;right&lt;/sub&gt;, and return the largest combined set.

The run time of this algorithm satisfies the following recurrence relation:

: &lt;math&gt;T(1) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;T(n) = 2^{O(r\cdot \sqrt{n})} T\left(\frac{2n}{3}\right) \text{ if } n&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;

The solution to this recurrence is:

: &lt;math&gt;T(n) = 2^{O(r\cdot \sqrt{n})}&lt;/math&gt;

== Local search algorithms ==

=== Pseudo-disks: a PTAS ===
A ''pseudo-disks-set'' is a set of objects in which the boundaries of every pair of objects intersect at most twice. (Note that this definition relates to a whole collection, and does not say anything about the shapes of the specific objects in the collection). A pseudo-disks-set has a bounded [[union complexity]], i.e., the number of intersection points on the boundary of the union of all objects is linear in the number of objects.

Let ''C'' be a pseudo-disks-set with ''n'' objects.   The following [[local search algorithm]] finds a disjoint set of size at least &lt;math&gt;(1-O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{b}}))\cdot|MDS(C)|&lt;/math&gt; in time &lt;math&gt;O(n^{b+3})&lt;/math&gt;, for every integer constant &lt;math&gt;b\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name=ChanHarPeled2012&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chan | first1 = T. M. | author1-link = Timothy M. Chan | last2 = Har-Peled | first2 = S. | author2-link = Sariel Har-Peled | doi = 10.1007/s00454-012-9417-5 | title = Approximation Algorithms for Maximum Independent Set of Pseudo-Disks | journal = Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 373 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = | arxiv = 1103.1431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* INITIALIZATION: Initialize an empty set, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.
* SEARCH: Loop over all the subsets of &lt;math&gt;C-S&lt;/math&gt; whose size is between 1 and &lt;math&gt;b+1&lt;/math&gt;. For each such subset ''X'':
** Verify that ''X'' itself is independent (otherwise go to the next subset);
** Calculate the set ''Y'' of objects in ''S'' that intersect ''X''. 
** If &lt;math&gt;|Y|&lt;|X|&lt;/math&gt;, then remove ''Y'' from ''S'' and insert ''X'': &lt;math&gt;S := S-Y+X&lt;/math&gt;.
* END: return the set ''S''.
Every exchange in the search step increases the size of ''S'' by at least 1, and thus can happen at most ''n'' times.

The algorithm is very simple; the difficult part is to prove the approximation ratio.&lt;ref name=ChanHarPeled2012 /&gt;

== Linear programming relaxation algorithms ==

=== Pseudo-disks: a PTAS ===

Let ''C'' be a pseudo-disks-set with ''n'' objects and union complexity ''u''. Using [[linear programming relaxation]], it is possible to find a disjoint set of size at least &lt;math&gt;\frac{n}{u}\cdot|MDS(C)|&lt;/math&gt;. This is possible either with a randomized algorithm that has a high probability of success and run time &lt;math&gt;O(n^3)&lt;/math&gt;, or a deterministic algorithm with a slower run time (but still polynomial). This algorithm can be generalized to the weighted case.&lt;ref name=ChanHarPeled2012 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2778">In [[mathematics]], the '''Morse–Palais lemma''' is a result in the [[calculus of variations]] and theory of [[Hilbert spaces]]. Roughly speaking, it states that a [[smooth function|smooth]] enough [[function (mathematics)|function]] near a critical point can be expressed as a [[quadratic form]] after a suitable change of coordinates.

The Morse–Palais lemma was originally proved in the finite-dimensional case by the [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] [[Marston Morse]], using the [[Gram–Schmidt process|Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization process]]. This result plays a crucial role in [[Morse theory]].  The generalization to Hilbert spaces is due to [[Richard Palais]] and [[Stephen Smale]].

==Statement of the lemma==

Let (''H'',&amp;nbsp;〈&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;〉) be a [[real number|real]] Hilbert space, and let ''U'' be an [[open set|open neighbourhood]] of 0 in ''H''. Let ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''U''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' be a (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2)-times continuously [[differentiable function]] with ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1, i.e. ''f''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sup&gt;(''U'';&amp;nbsp;'''R'''). Assume that ''f''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and that 0 is a non-degenerate [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]] of ''f'', i.e. the second derivative D&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''f''(0) defines an [[isomorphism]] of ''H'' with its [[continuous dual space]] ''H''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;H \ni x \mapsto \mathrm{D}^{2} f(0) ( x, - ) \in H^{*}. &lt;/math&gt;

Then there exists a subneighbourhood ''V'' of 0 in ''U'', a [[diffeomorphism]] ''φ''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''V''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''V'' that is ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; with ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; inverse, and an [[invertible function|invertible]] [[symmetric operator]] ''A''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''H''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''H'', such that

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \langle A \varphi(x), \varphi(x) \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''V''.

==Corollary==

Let ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''U''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' be ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sup&gt; such that 0 is a non-degenerate critical point. Then there exists a ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;-with-''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;-inverse diffeomorphism ''ψ''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''V''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''V'' and an orthogonal decomposition

:&lt;math&gt;H = G \oplus G^{\perp},&lt;/math&gt;

such that, if one writes

:&lt;math&gt;\psi (x) = y + z \mbox{ with } y \in G, z \in G^{\perp},&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;f (\psi(x)) = \langle y, y \rangle - \langle z, z \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''V''.

'''Network medicine''' is the application of [[network science]] towards identifying, preventing, and treating diseases. This field focuses on using [[network topology]] and [[network dynamics]] towards identifying diseases and developing medical drugs. [[Biological network]]s, such as [[protein-protein interaction]]s and [[metabolic pathway]]s, are utilized by network medicine. [[human disease network|Disease networks]], which map relationships between diseases and biological factors, also play an important role in the field. [[Epidemiology]] is extensively studied using network science as well; [[social network]]s and [[flow network|transportation networks]] are used to model the spreading of disease across populations. Network medicine is a medically focused area of [[systems biology]].

== Background ==

The term "network medicine" was coined and popularized in a scientific article by [[Albert-László Barabási]] called "Network Medicine – From Obesity to the "Diseasome", published in The New England Journal of Medicine, in 2007. Barabási states that [[biological system]]s, similarly to social and technological systems, contain many components that are connected in complicated relationships but are organized by simple principles. Using the recent development of [[network theory]], the organizing principles can be comprehensively analyzed by representing systems as [[complex network]]s, which are collections of [[Vertex (graph theory)|nodes]] linked together by a particular relationship. For networks pertaining to medicine, nodes represent biological factors ([[biomolecule]]s, diseases, phenotypes, etc.) and links (edges) represent their relationships (physical interactions, shared metabolic pathway, shared gene, shared trait, etc.).&lt;ref name=chan2012&gt;Chan, S. Y., &amp; Loscalzo, J. (2012). The emerging paradigm of network medicine in the study of human disease. Circulation research, 111(3), 359–374.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three key networks for understanding human disease are the [[metabolic network]], the [[human disease network|disease network]], and the social network. The network medicine is based on the idea that understanding complexity of [[Regulation of gene expression|gene regulation]], [[metabolic reaction]]s, and [[protein-protein interaction]]s and that representing these as complex networks will shed light on the causes and mechanisms of diseases. It is possible, for example, to infer a [[bipartite graph]] representing the connections of diseases to their associated [[gene]]s using the [[OMIM]] database.&lt;ref name=goh2007&gt;Goh, K. I., Cusick, M. E., Valle, D., Childs, B., Vidal, M., &amp; Barabási, A. L. (2007). The human disease network. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104(21), 8685–8690.&lt;/ref&gt; The projection of the diseases, called the human disease network (HDN), is a network of diseases connected to each other if they share a common gene. Using the HDN, diseases can be classified and analyzed through the genetic relationships between them.

== Research areas ==

=== Interactome ===
{{main| Interactome}}
The whole set of molecular interactions in the human cell, also known as the [[interactome]], can be used for disease identification and prevention.&lt;ref name=barabasi2011&gt;Barabási, A. L., Gulbahce, N., &amp; Loscalzo, J. (2011). Network medicine: a network-based approach to human disease. Nature Reviews Genetics, 12(1), 56–68.&lt;/ref&gt; These networks have been technically classified as [[scale-free network|scale-free]], [[assortativity|disassortative]], [[small-world network]]s, having a high [[betweenness centrality]].&lt;ref name=loscalzo2011&gt;Loscalzo, J., &amp; Barabasi, A. L. (2011). Systems biology and the future of medicine. Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Systems Biology and Medicine, 3(6), 619–627.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protein-protein interaction]]s have been mapped, using proteins as [[node (graph theory)|node]]s and their interactions between each other as links.&lt;ref&gt;Rual, J. F., Venkatesan, K., Hao, T., Hirozane-Kishikawa, T., Dricot, A., Li, N., ... &amp; Vidal, M. (2005). Towards a proteome-scale map of the human protein–protein interaction network. Nature, 437(7062), 1173–1178.&lt;/ref&gt; These maps utilize databases such as [[BioGRID]] and the [[Human Protein Reference Database]]. The [[metabolic network]] encompasses the biochemical reactions in [[metabolic pathway]]s, connecting two [[metabolite]]s if they are in the same pathway.&lt;ref&gt;Ravasz, E., Somera, A. L., Mongru, D. A., Oltvai, Z. N., &amp; Barabási, A. L. (2002). Hierarchical organization of modularity in metabolic networks. science, 297(5586), 1551–1555.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have used databases such as [[KEGG]] to map these networks. Others networks include [[cell signaling]] networks, [[gene regulatory network]]s, and [[RNA]] networks.

Using interactome networks, one can discover and classify diseases, as well as develop treatments through knowledge of its associations and their role in the networks. One observation is that diseases can be classified not by their principle [[phenotype]]s (pathophenotype) but by their '''''disease module''''', which is a neighborhood or group of components in the interactome that, if disrupted, results in a specific pathophenotype.&lt;ref name=barabasi2011 /&gt; Disease modules can be used in a variety of ways, such as predicting disease genes that have not been discovered yet. Therefore, network medicine looks to identify the disease [[Modular decomposition#Modules|module]] for a specific pathophenotype using [[cluster analysis|clustering algorithms]].

=== Diseasome ===
{{main| Human disease network}}
[[Human disease network]]s, also called the diseasome, are networks in which the nodes are diseases and the links, the strength of correlation between them. This correlation is commonly quantified based on associated cellular components that two diseases share. The first-published human disease network (HDN) looked at genes, finding that many of the disease associated genes are [[essential gene|non-essential genes]], as these are the genes that do not completely disrupt the network and are able to be passed down generations.&lt;ref name=goh2007 /&gt; Metabolic disease networks (MDN), in which two diseases are connected by a shared [[metabolite]] or [[metabolic pathway]], have also been extensively studied and is especially relevant in the case of [[metabolic disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Braun, P., Rietman, E., &amp; Vidal, M. (2008). Networking metabolites and diseases. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 105(29), 9849–9850.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three representations of the diseasome are:&lt;ref name=loscalzo2011 /&gt;
* '''''Shared gene formalism''''' states that if a gene is linked to two different disease phenotypes, then the two diseases likely have a common genetic origin ([[genetic disorder]]s). 
* '''''Shared metabolic pathway formalism''''' states that if a metabolic pathway is linked to two different diseases, then the two diseases likely have a shared metabolic origin ([[metabolic disorder]]s). 
* '''''Disease comorbidity formalism''''' uses phenotypic disease networks (PDN), where two diseases are linked if the observed [[comorbidity]] between their [[phenotype]]s exceeds a predefined threshold.&lt;ref&gt;Hidalgo, C. A., Blumm, N., Barabási, A. L., &amp; Christakis, N. A. (2009). A dynamic network approach for the study of human phenotypes. PLoS Computational Biology, 5(4), e1000353.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not look at the mechanism of action of diseases, but captures disease progression and how highly connected diseases correlate to higher mortality rates.

Some disease networks connect diseases to associated factors outside the human cell. Networks of environmental and genetic [[etiology (medicine)|etiological factors]] linked with shared diseases, called the "etiome", can be also used to assess the [[clustering coefficient|clustering]] of [[environmental factor]]s in these networks and understand the role of the environment on the interactome.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Y. I., Wise, P. H., &amp; Butte, A. J. (2009). The "etiome": identification and clustering of human disease etiological factors. BMC bioinformatics, 10(Suppl 2), S14.&lt;/ref&gt; The human symptom-disease network (HSDN), published in June 2014, showed that the symptoms of disease and disease associated cellular components were strongly correlated and that diseases of the same categories tend to form highly connected communities, with respect to their symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou, X., Menche, J., Barabási, A. L., &amp; Sharma, A. (2014). Human symptoms–disease network. Nature Communications, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pharmacology ===
{{main| Systems pharmacology}}
Network [[pharmacology]] is a developing field based in [[systems pharmacology]] that looks at the effect of drugs on both the interactome and the diseasome.&lt;ref name=hopkins2008&gt;Hopkins, A. L. (2008). Network pharmacology: the next paradigm in drug discovery. Nature Chemical Biology, 4(11), 682–690.&lt;/ref&gt; The drug-target network (DTN) can play an important role in understanding the mechanisms of action of approved and experimental drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Yıldırım, M. A., Goh, K. I., Cusick, M. E., Barabási, A. L., &amp; Vidal, M. (2007). Drug—target network. Nature biotechnology, 25(10), 1119–1126.&lt;/ref&gt; The network theory view of [[pharmaceutical]]s is based on the effect of the drug in the interactome, especially the region that the [[drug target]] occupies. [[Combination therapy]] for a complex disease (polypharmacology) is suggested in this field since one [[active pharmaceutical ingredient]] (API) aimed at one target may not effect the entire disease module.&lt;ref name=hopkins2008 /&gt; The concept of disease modules can be used to aid in [[drug discovery]], [[drug design]], and the development of [[biomarker]]s for disease detection.&lt;ref name=chan2012 /&gt; There can be a variety of ways to identifying drugs using network pharmacology; a simple example of this is the "guilt by association" method. This states if two diseases are treated by the same drug, a drug that treats one disease may treat the other.&lt;ref&gt;Chiang, A. P., &amp; Butte, A. J. (2009). Systematic evaluation of drug–disease relationships to identify leads for novel drug uses. Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics, 86(5), 507–510.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drug repurposing]], [[drug-drug interaction]]s and drug [[side-effect]]s have also been studied in this field.&lt;ref name=chan2012 /&gt;

=== Network epidemics ===
Network epidemics has been built by applying network science to existing [[epidemic model]]s, as many [[flow network|transportation networks]] and social networks play a role in the spread of disease.&lt;ref&gt;Pastor-Satorras, R., &amp; Vespignani, A. (2001). Epidemic spreading in scale-free networks.

=== Other Networks ===
The development of organs and other biological systems can be modelled as network structures where the clinical (e.g., radiographic, functional) characteristics can be represented as nodes and the relationships between these characteristics are represented as the links
among such nodes.&lt;ref name=scala2014&gt;Scala,A. Auconi,P., Scazzocchio,M., Caldarelli,G.,

[[File:Oberwolfach-3-4.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Decomposition of the complete graph &lt;math&gt;K_7&lt;/math&gt; into three copies of &lt;math&gt;C_3+C_4&lt;/math&gt;, solving the Oberwolfach problem for the input &lt;math&gt;(3,4)&lt;/math&gt;]]
The '''Oberwolfach problem''' is an unsolved problem in mathematics that may be formulated either as a problem scheduling seating assignments for diners,
or more abstractly as a problem in [[graph theory]], on the [[edge cycle cover]]s of [[complete graph]]s. It is named after the [[Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach]], where the problem was posed in 1967 by [[Gerhard Ringel]].{{r|lr}}

==Formulation==
In conferences held at Oberwolfach, it is the custom for the participants to dine together in a room with circular tables, not all the same size, and with assigned seating that rearranges the participants from meal to meal. The Oberwolfach problem asks how to make a seating chart for a given set of tables so that all tables are full at each meal and all pairs of conference participants are seated next to each other exactly once. An instance of the problem can be denoted as &lt;math&gt;OP(x,y,z,\dots)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x,y,z,\dots&lt;/math&gt; are the given table sizes. Alternatively, when some table sizes are repeated, they may be denoted using exponential notation; for instance, &lt;math&gt;OP(5^3)&lt;/math&gt; describes an instance with three tables of size five.{{r|lr}}

Formulated as a problem in graph theory, the pairs of people sitting next to each other at a single meal can be represented as a [[disjoint union of graphs|disjoint union]] of [[cycle graph]]s &lt;math&gt;C_x+C_y+C_z+\cdots&lt;/math&gt; of the specified lengths, with one cycle for each of the dining tables. This union of cycles is a [[regular graph|2-regular graph]], and every 2-regular graph has this form. If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is this 2-regular graph and has &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices, the question is whether the complete graph &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt; can be represented as an edge-disjoint union of copies of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.{{r|lr}}

In order for a solution to exist, the total number of conference participants (or equivalently, the total capacity of the tables, or the total number of vertices of the given cycle graphs) must be an odd number. For, at each meal, each participant sits next to two neighbors, so the total number of neighbors of each participant must be even, and this is only possible when the total number of participants is odd. The problem has, however, also been extended to even values of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; by asking, for those &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, whether all of the edges of the complete graph except for a [[perfect matching]] can be covered by copies of the given 2-regular graph. Like the [[ménage problem]] (a different mathematical problem involving seating arrangements of diners and tables), this variant of the problem can be formulated by supposing that the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; diners are arranged into &lt;math&gt;n/2&lt;/math&gt; married couples, and that the seating arrangements should place each diner next to each other diner except their own spouse exactly once.{{r|hkr}}

==Known results==
The only instances of the Oberwolfach problem that are known not to be solvable are &lt;math&gt;OP(3^2)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;OP(3^4)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;OP(4,5)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;OP(3,3,5)&lt;/math&gt;. It is widely believed that all other instances have a solution, but only special cases have been provable to be solvable.

The cases for which a solution is known include:
*All instances &lt;math&gt;OP(x^y)&lt;/math&gt; except &lt;math&gt;OP(3^2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;OP(3^4)&lt;/math&gt;.{{r|h|ah|assw|hs|hkr}}
*All instances in which all of the cycles have even length.{{r|h|bd}}
*All instances (other than the known exceptions) with &lt;math&gt;n\le 40&lt;/math&gt;.{{r|dfhmr}}
*All instances for certain choices of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, belonging to an infinite subset of the [[prime number]]s.{{r|bs|abhms}}
*All instances &lt;math&gt;OP(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; other than the known exceptions &lt;math&gt;OP(3,3)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;OP(4,5)&lt;/math&gt;.{{r|t}}

==Related problems==
[[Kirkman's schoolgirl problem]], of grouping fifteen schoolgirls into rows of three in seven different ways so that each pair of girls appears once in each triple, is a special case of the Oberwolfach problem, &lt;math&gt;OP(3^5)&lt;/math&gt;. The problem of [[Hamiltonian decomposition]] of a complete graph &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt; is another special case, &lt;math&gt;OP(n)&lt;/math&gt;.{{r|bd}}

[[Alspach's conjecture]], on the decomposition of a complete graph into cycles of given sizes, is related to the Oberwolfach problem, but neither is a special case of the other.
If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a 2-regular graph, with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices, formed from a disjoint union of cycles of certain lengths, then a solution to the Oberwolfach problem for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; would also provide a decomposition of the complete graph into &lt;math&gt;(n-1)/2&lt;/math&gt; copies of each of the cycles of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. However, not every decomposition of &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt; into this many cycles of each size can be grouped into disjoint cycles that form copies of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and on the other hand not every instance of Alspach's conjecture involves sets of cycles that have &lt;math&gt;(n-1)/2&lt;/math&gt; copies of each cycle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3567">In [[chemical bond]]s, an '''orbital overlap''' is the concentration of [[atomic orbital|orbitals]] on adjacent atoms in the same regions of space.  Orbital overlap can lead to bond formation. The importance of orbital overlap was emphasized by [[Linus Pauling]] to explain the molecular [[bond angle]]s observed through experimentation and is the basis for the concept of [[orbital hybridization]].  Since ''s''&amp;nbsp;orbitals are spherical (and have no directionality) and ''p'' orbitals are oriented 90° to each other, a theory was needed to explain why molecules such as [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) had observed bond angles of 109.5°.&lt;ref&gt;Anslyn, Eric V./Dougherty, Dennis A. (2006).  ''Modern Physical Organic Chemistry''.  University Science Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pauling proposed that s and p orbitals on the carbon atom  can combine to form hybrids (sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in the case of methane) which are directed toward the hydrogen atoms. The carbon hybrid orbitals have greater overlap with the hydrogen orbitals, and can therefore form stronger C–H bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Pauling, Linus.  (1960).  ''The Nature Of The Chemical Bond''.  Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A quantitative measure of the overlap of two atomic orbitals Ψ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and Ψ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; on atoms A and B is their '''overlap integral''', defined as

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}_\mathrm{AB}=\int \Psi_\mathrm{A}^* \Psi_\mathrm{B} \, dV,&lt;/math&gt;

where the integration extends over all space. The star on the first orbital wavefunction indicates the [[complex conjugate]] of the function, which in general may be [[complex-valued]].

==Overlap matrix==
The '''overlap matrix''' is a [[square matrix]], used in [[quantum chemistry]] to describe the inter-relationship of a set of [[basis vector]]s of a [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] system, such as an atomic orbital [[basis set (chemistry)|basis set]] used in molecular electronic structure calculations. In particular, if the vectors are [[orthogonal]] to one another, the overlap matrix will be diagonal. In addition, if the basis vectors form an [[orthonormal]] set, the overlap matrix will be the [[identity matrix]]. The overlap matrix is always ''n''&amp;times;''n'', where ''n'' is the number of basis functions used. It is a kind of [[Gramian matrix]].

In general, each overlap matrix element is defined as an overlap integral:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}_{jk}=\left \langle b_j|b_k \right \rangle=\int \Psi_j^* \Psi_k \, d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\left |b_j \right \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the ''j''-th basis [[Bra-ket notation|ket]] ([[vector (geometric)|vector]]), and

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_j&lt;/math&gt; is the ''j''-th [[wavefunction]], defined as :&lt;math&gt;\Psi_j(x)=\left \langle x | b_j \right \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

In particular, if the set is normalized (though not necessarily orthogonal) then the diagonal elements will be identically 1 and the magnitude of the [[off-diagonal element]]s less than or equal to one with equality if and only if there is linear dependence in the basis set as per the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]].  Moreover, the matrix is always [[positive-definite matrix|positive definite]]; that is to say, the eigenvalues are all strictly positive.

In [[calculus]], a '''parametric derivative''' is a [[derivative]] of a [[dependent variable]] ''y'' with respect to an [[independent variable]] ''x'' that is taken when both variables depend on an independent third variable ''t'', usually thought of as "time" (that is, when ''x'' and ''y'' are given by [[parametric equations]] in ''t'' ).

== First derivative ==

Let &lt;math&gt;x(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; be the [[coordinates]] of the points of the curve expressed as functions of a [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] ''t'':

:&lt;math&gt;y=y(t), \quad x=x(t).&lt;/math&gt;

The first derivative implied by these [[parametric equation]]s is 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt} = \frac{\dot{y}(t)}{\dot{x}(t)},&lt;/math&gt;

where the notation &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the derivative of ''x'' with respect to ''t'', for example. This can be derived using the chain rule for derivatives:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dy}{dx} \cdot \frac{dx}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

and dividing both sides by &lt;math&gt; \frac{dx}{dt} &lt;/math&gt; to give the equation above.

In general all of these derivatives — ''dy / dt'', ''dx / dt'', and ''dy / dx'' — are themselves functions of ''t'' and so can be written more explicitly as, for example, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dy}{dx}(t).&lt;/math&gt;

== Second derivative ==

The [[second derivative]] implied by a parametric equation is given by

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)\cdot\frac{dt}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\dot{y}}{\dot{x}}\right)\frac{1}{\dot{x}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{\dot{x}\ddot{y} - \dot{y}\ddot{x}}{\dot{x}^3}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
by making use of the [[quotient rule]] for derivatives.  The latter result is useful in the computation of [[curvature]].

== Example ==

For example, consider the set of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s where:
:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = 4t^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = 3t. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating both functions with respect to ''t'' leads to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = 8t&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dt} = 3,&lt;/math&gt;

respectively. Substituting these into the formula for the parametric derivative, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\dot{y}}{\dot{x}} = \frac{3}{8t},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{y}&lt;/math&gt; are understood to be functions of ''t''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="69122">In [[graph theory]], the '''planar separator theorem''' is a form of [[isoperimetric inequality]] for [[planar graph]]s, that states that any planar graph can be split into smaller pieces by removing a small number of vertices. Specifically, the removal of O(√''n'') vertices from an ''n''-vertex graph (where the ''O'' invokes [[big O notation]]) can [[graph partition|partition]] the graph into disjoint [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraphs]] each of which has at most 2''n''/3 vertices.

A weaker form of the separator theorem with O(√''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') vertices in the separator instead of O(√''n'') was originally proven by {{harvtxt|Ungar|1951}}, and the form with the tight asymptotic bound on the separator size was first proven by {{harvtxt|Lipton|Tarjan|1979}}. Since their work, the separator theorem has been reproven in several different ways, the constant in the O(√''n'') term of the theorem has been improved, and it has been extended to certain classes of nonplanar graphs.

Repeated application of the separator theorem produces a separator hierarchy which may take the form of either a [[tree decomposition]] or a [[branch-decomposition]] of the graph. Separator hierarchies may be used to devise efficient [[divide and conquer algorithm]]s for planar graphs, and [[dynamic programming]] on these hierarchies can be used to devise [[exponential time]] and [[fixed-parameter tractability|fixed-parameter tractable]] algorithms for solving [[NP-hard]] optimization problems on these graphs. Separator hierarchies may also be used in [[nested dissection]], an efficient variant of [[Gaussian elimination]] for solving [[sparse matrix|sparse]] [[System of linear equations|systems of linear equations]] arising from [[finite element method]]s.

[[bidimensionality|Bidimensionality theory]] of  [[Erik Demaine|Demaine]], Fomin, [[Mohammad Hajiaghayi|Hajiaghayi]], and Thilikos generalizes and greatly expands the applicability of the separator theorem 
for a vast set of minimization problems on [[planar graph]]s and more generally  [[graph minor|graphs excluding a fixed minor]].

==Statement of the theorem==
As it is usually stated, the separator theorem states that, in any ''n''-vertex planar graph ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',''E''), there exists a partition of the vertices of ''G'' into three sets ''A'', ''S'', and ''B'', such that each of ''A'' and ''B'' has at most 2''n''/3 vertices, ''S'' has O(√''n'') vertices, and there are no edges with one endpoint in ''A'' and one endpoint in ''B''. It is not required that ''A'' or ''B'' form [[connected graph|connected]] [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraphs]] of ''G''. ''S'' is called the '''separator''' for this partition.

An equivalent formulation is that the edges of any ''n''-vertex planar graph ''G'' may be subdivided into two edge-disjoint subgraphs ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in such a way that both subgraphs have at least ''n''/3 vertices and such that the intersection of the vertex sets of the two subgraphs has O(√''n'') vertices in it. Such a partition is known as a '''separation'''.&lt;ref name="ast90"&gt;{{harvtxt|Alon|Seymour|Thomas|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If a separation is given, then the intersection of the vertex sets forms a separator, and the vertices that belong to one subgraph but not the other form the separated subsets of at most 2''n''/3 vertices. In the other direction, if one is given a partition into three sets ''A'', ''S'', and ''B'' that meet the conditions of the planar separator theorem, then one may form a separation in which the edges with an endpoint in ''A'' belong to ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the edges with an endpoint in ''B'' belong to ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the remaining edges (with both endpoints in ''S'') are partitioned arbitrarily.

The constant 2/3 in the statement of the separator theorem is arbitrary and may be replaced by any other number in the [[open interval]] (1/2,1) without changing the form of the theorem: a partition into more equal subsets may be obtained from a less-even partition by repeatedly splitting the larger sets in the uneven partition and regrouping the resulting connected components.&lt;ref name="d82"&gt;{{harvtxt|Djidjev|1982}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
[[File:Grid separator.svg|thumb|240px|A planar separator for a grid graph.]]
Consider a [[grid graph]] with ''r'' rows and ''c'' columns; the number ''n'' of vertices equals ''rc''. For instance, in the illustration, ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5, ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8, and ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;40. If ''r'' is odd, there is a single central row, and otherwise there are two rows equally close to the center; similarly, if ''c'' is odd, there is a single central column, and otherwise there are two columns equally close to the center. Choosing ''S'' to be any of these central rows or columns, and removing ''S'' from the graph, partitions the graph into two smaller connected subgraphs ''A'' and ''B'', each of which has at most ''n''/2 vertices. If ''r''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''c'' (as in the illustration), then choosing a central column will give a separator ''S'' with ''r''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;√''n'' vertices, and similarly if ''c''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''r'' then choosing a central row will give a separator with at most √''n'' vertices. Thus, every grid graph has a separator ''S'' of size at most √''n'', the removal of which partitions it into two connected components, each of size at most ''n''/2.&lt;ref name="g73"&gt;{{harvtxt|George|1973}}. Instead of using a row or column of a grid graph, George partitions the graph into four pieces by using the union of a row and a column as a separator.&lt;/ref&gt;

The planar separator theorem states that a similar partition can be constructed in any planar graph. The case of arbitrary planar graphs differs from the case of grid graphs in that the separator has size O(√''n'') but may be larger than √''n'', the bound on the size of the two subsets ''A'' and ''B'' (in the most common versions of the theorem) is 2''n''/3 rather than ''n''/2, and the two subsets ''A'' and ''B'' need not themselves form connected subgraphs.

==Constructions==

===Breadth-first layering===
{{harvtxt|Lipton|Tarjan|1979}} augment the given planar graph by additional edges, if necessary, so that it becomes maximal planar (every face in a planar embedding is a triangle). They then perform a [[breadth-first search]], rooted at an arbitrary vertex ''v'', and partition the vertices into levels by their distance from ''v''. If ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[median]] level (the level such that the numbers of vertices at higher and lower levels are both at most ''n''/2) then there must be levels ''l''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that are O(√''n'') steps above and below ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; respectively and that contain O(√''n'') vertices, respectively, for otherwise there would be more than ''n'' vertices in the levels near ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. They show that there must be a separator ''S'' formed by the union of ''l''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the endpoints ''e'' of an edge of ''G'' that does not belong to the breadth-first search tree and that lies between the two levels, and the vertices on the two breadth-first search tree paths from ''e'' back up to level ''l''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The size of the separator ''S'' constructed in this way is at most √8√''n'', or approximately 2.83√''n''. The vertices of the separator and the two disjoint subgraphs can be found in [[linear time]].

This proof of the separator theorem applies as well to weighted planar graphs, in which each vertex has a non-negative cost. The graph may be partitioned into three sets ''A'', ''S'', and ''B'' such that ''A'' and ''B'' each have at most 2/3 of the total cost and ''S'' has O(√''n'') vertices, with no edges from ''A'' to ''B''.&lt;ref name="lt79"&gt;{{harvtxt|Lipton|Tarjan|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By analysing a similar separator construction more carefully, {{harvtxt|Djidjev|1982}} shows that the bound on the size of ''S'' can be reduced to √6√''n'', or approximately 2.45√''n''.

{{harvtxt|Holzer|Schulz|Wagner|Prasinos|2009}} suggest a simplified version of this approach: they augment the graph to be maximal planar and construct a breadth first search tree as before. Then, for each edge ''e'' that is not part of the tree, they form a cycle by combining ''e'' with the tree path that connects its endpoints. They then use as a separator the vertices of one of these cycles. Although this approach cannot be guaranteed to find a small separator for planar graphs of high diameter, their experiments indicate that it outperforms the Lipton–Tarjan and Djidjev breadth-first layering methods on many types of planar graph.

===Simple cycle separators===
For a graph that is already maximal planar it is possible to show a stronger construction of a '''simple cycle separator''', a cycle of small length such that the inside and the outside of the cycle (in the unique planar embedding of the graph) each have at most 2''n''/3 vertices. {{harvtxt|Miller|1986}} proves this (with a separator size of √8√''n'') by using the Lipton–Tarjan technique for a modified version of breadth first search in which the levels of the search form simple cycles.

{{harvtxt|Alon|Seymour|Thomas|1994}} prove the existence of simple cycle separators more directly: they let ''C'' be a cycle of at most √8√''n'' vertices, with at most 2''n''/3 vertices outside ''C'', that forms as even a partition of inside and outside as possible, and they show that these assumptions force ''C'' to be a separator. For otherwise, the distances within ''C'' must equal the distances in the disk enclosed by ''C'' (a shorter path through the interior of the disk would form part of the boundary of a better cycle). Additionally, ''C'' must have length exactly √8√''n'', as otherwise it could be improved by replacing one of its edges by the other two sides of a triangle. If the vertices in ''C'' are numbered (in clockwise order) from 1 to √8√''n'', and vertex ''i'' is matched up with vertex {{nowrap|&amp;radic;8&amp;radic;''n'' &amp;minus; ''i'' + 1}}, then these matched pairs can be connected by vertex-disjoint paths within the disk, by a form of [[Menger's theorem]] for planar graphs. However, the total length of these paths would necessarily exceed ''n'', a contradiction. With some additional work they show by a similar method that there exists a simple cycle separator of size at most (3/√2)√''n'', approximately 2.12√''n''.

{{harvtxt|Djidjev|Venkatesan|1997}} further improved the constant factor in the simple cycle separator theorem to 1.97√''n''. Their method can also find simple cycle separators for graphs with non-negative vertex weights, with separator size at most 2√''n'', and can generate separators with smaller size at the expense of a more uneven partition of the graph. In 2-connected planar graphs that are not maximal, there exist simple cycle separators with size proportional to the [[Euclidean norm]] of the vector of face lengths that can be found in near-linear time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gazit|Miller|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circle separators===
According to the [[Circle packing theorem|Koebe–Andreev–Thurston circle-packing theorem]], any planar graph may be represented by a packing of circular disks in the plane with disjoint interiors, such that two vertices in the graph are adjacent if and only if the corresponding pair of disks are mutually tangent. As {{harvtxt|Miller|Teng|Thurston|Vavasis|1997}} show, for such a packing, there exists a circle that has at most 3''n''/4 disks touching or inside it, at most 3''n''/4 disks touching or outside it, and that crosses O(√''n'') disks.

To prove this, Miller et al. use [[stereographic projection]] to map the packing onto the surface of a unit sphere in three dimensions. By choosing the projection carefully, the center of the sphere can be made into a [[Centerpoint (geometry)|centerpoint]] of the disk centers on its surface, so that any plane through the center of the sphere partitions it into two halfspaces that each contain or cross at most 3''n''/4 of the disks. If a plane through the center is chosen uniformly at random, a disk will be crossed with probability proportional to its radius. Therefore, the expected number of disks that are crossed is proportional to the sum of the radii of the disks. However, the sum of the squares of the radii is proportional to the total area of the disks, which is at most the total surface area of the unit sphere, a constant. An argument involving [[Jensen's inequality]] shows that, when the sum of squares of ''n'' non-negative real numbers is bounded by a constant, the sum of the numbers themselves is O(√''n''). Therefore, the expected number of disks crossed by a random plane is O(√''n'') and there exists a plane that crosses at most that many disks. This plane intersects the sphere in a [[great circle]], which projects back down to a circle in the plane with the desired properties. The O(√''n'') disks crossed by this circle correspond to the vertices of a planar graph separator that separates the vertices whose disks are inside the circle from the vertices whose disks are outside the circle, with at most 3''n''/4 vertices in each of these two subsets.&lt;ref name="mttv97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pa95"&gt;{{harvtxt|Pach|Agarwal|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This method leads to a [[randomized algorithm]] that finds such a separator in [[linear time]],&lt;ref name="mttv97"/&gt; and a less-practical [[deterministic algorithm]] with the same linear time bound.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eppstein|Miller|Teng|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By analyzing this algorithm carefully using known bounds on the [[Packing problem|packing density]] of [[circle packing]]s, it can be shown to find separators of size at most
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt 3}}\left(\frac{1+\sqrt 3}{2\sqrt2}+o(1)\right)\sqrt n\approx 1.84\sqrt n.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Spielman|Teng|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although this improved separator size bound comes at the expense of a more-uneven partition of the graph, {{harvtxt|Spielman|Teng|1996}} argue that it provides an improved constant factor in the time bounds for nested dissection compared to the separators of {{harvtxt|Alon|Seymour|Thomas|1990}}. The size of the separators it produces can be further improved, in practice, by using a nonuniform distribution for the random cutting planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gremban|Miller|Teng|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stereographic projection in the Miller et al. argument can be avoided by considering the smallest circle containing a constant fraction of the centers of the disks and then expanding it by a constant picked uniformly in the range [1,2]. It is easy to argue, as in Miller et al., that the disks intersecting the expanded circle form a valid separator, and that, in expectation, the separator is of the right size. The resulting constants are somewhat worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Har-Peled|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spectral partitioning===
[[Spectral clustering]] methods, in which the vertices of a graph are grouped by the coordinates of the [[eigenvector]]s of [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] derived from the graph, have long been used as a heuristic for [[graph partitioning]] problems for nonplanar graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Donath|Hoffman|1972}}; {{harvtxt|Fiedler|1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As {{harvtxt|Spielman|Teng|2007}} show, spectral clustering can also be used to derive an alternative proof for a weakened form of the planar separator theorem that applies to planar graphs with bounded degree. In their method, the vertices of a given planar graph are sorted by the second coordinates of the [[eigenvector]]s of the [[Laplacian matrix]] of the graph, and this sorted order is partitioned at the point that minimizes the ratio of the number of edges cut by the partition to the number of vertices on the smaller side of the partition. As they show, every planar graph of bounded degree has a partition of this type in which the ratio is O(1/√''n''). Although this partition may not be balanced, repeating the partition within the larger of the two sides and taking the union of the cuts formed at each repetition will eventually lead to a balanced partition with O(√''n'') edges. The endpoints of these edges form a separator of size O(√''n'').

===Edge separators===
A variation of the planar separator theorem involves '''edge separators''', small sets of edges forming a [[cut (graph theory)|cut]] between two subsets ''A'' and ''B'' of the vertices of the graph.  The two sets ''A'' and ''B'' must each have size at most a constant fraction of the number ''n'' of vertices of the graph (conventionally, both sets have size at most 2''n''/3), and each vertex of the graph belongs to exactly one of ''A'' and ''B''. The separator consists of the edges that have one endpoint in ''A'' and one endpoint in ''B''. Bounds on the size of an edge separator involve the [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] of the vertices as well as the number of vertices in the graph: the planar graphs in which one vertex has degree ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, including the [[wheel graph]]s and [[Star (graph theory)|star graphs]], have no edge separator with a sublinear number of edges, because any edge separator would have to include all the edges connecting the high degree vertex to the vertices on the other side of the cut. However, every planar graph with maximum degree Δ has an edge separator of size O(√(Δ''n'')).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Miller|1986}} proved this result for 2-connected planar graphs, and {{harvtxt|Diks|Djidjev|Sýkora|Vrt'o|1993}} extended it to all planar graphs.&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple cycle separator in the [[dual graph]] of a planar graph forms an edge separator in the original graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Miller|1986}}; {{harvtxt|Gazit|Miller|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Applying the simple cycle separator theorem of {{harvtxt|Gazit|Miller|1990}} to the dual graph of a given planar graph strengthens the O(√(Δ''n'')) bound for the size of an edge separator by showing that every planar graph has an edge separator whose size is proportional to the Euclidean norm of its vector of vertex degrees.

{{harvtxt|Papadimitriou|Sideri|1996}} describe a polynomial time algorithm for finding the smallest edge separator that partitions a graph ''G'' into two subgraphs of equal size, when ''G'' is an [[induced subgraph]] of a grid graph with no holes or with a constant number of holes. However, they conjecture that the problem is [[NP-complete]] for arbitrary planar graphs, and they show that the complexity of the problem is the same for grid graphs with arbitrarily many holes as it is for arbitrary planar graphs.

==Lower bounds==
[[File:Geode10.png|thumb|A polyhedron formed by replacing each of the faces of an [[icosahedron]] by a mesh of 100 triangles, an example of the lower bound construction of {{harvtxt|Djidjev|1982}}.]]
In a √''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;√''n'' grid graph, a set ''S'' of ''s''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;√''n'' points can enclose a subset of at most ''s''(''s''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2 grid points, where the maximum is achieved by arranging ''S'' in a diagonal line near a corner of the grid. Therefore, in order to form a separator that separates at least ''n''/3 of the points from the remaining grid, ''s'' needs to be at least √(2''n''/3), approximately 0.82√''n''.

There exist ''n''-vertex planar graphs (for arbitrarily large values of ''n'') such that, for every separator ''S'' that partitions the remaining graph into subgraphs of at most 2''n''/3 vertices, ''S'' has at least √(4π√3)√''n'' vertices, approximately 1.56√''n''.&lt;ref name="d82"/&gt; The construction involves approximating a [[sphere]] by a [[convex polyhedron]], replacing each of the faces of the polyhedron by a triangular mesh, and applying [[isoperimetric theorem]]s for the surface of the sphere.

==Separator hierarchies==
Separators may be combined into a '''separator hierarchy''' of a planar graph, a recursive decomposition into smaller graphs. A separator hierarchy may be represented by a [[binary tree]] in which the root node represents the given graph itself, and the two children of the root are the roots of recursively constructed separator hierarchies for the [[induced subgraph]]s formed from the two subsets ''A'' and ''B'' of a separator.

A separator hierarchy of this type forms the basis for a [[tree decomposition]] of the given graph, in which the set of vertices associated with each tree node is the union of the separators on the path from that node to the root of the tree. Since the sizes of the graphs go down by a constant factor at each level of the tree, the upper bounds on the sizes of the separators also go down by a constant factor at each level, so the sizes of the separators on these paths add in a [[geometric series]] to O(√''n''). That is, a separator formed in this way has width O(√''n''), and can be used to show that every planar graph has [[treewidth]] O(√''n'').

Constructing a separator hierarchy directly, by traversing the binary tree top down and applying a linear-time planar separator algorithm to each of the induced subgraphs associated with each node of the binary tree, would take a total of O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') time. However, it is possible to construct an entire separator hierarchy in linear time, by using the Lipton–Tarjan breadth-first layering approach and by using appropriate [[data structure]]s to perform each partition step in sublinear time.&lt;ref name="g95"&gt;{{harvtxt|Goodrich|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If one forms a related type of hierarchy based on separations instead of separators, in which the two children of the root node are roots of recursively constructed hierarchies for the two subgraphs ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of a separation of the given graph, then the overall structure forms a [[branch-decomposition]] instead of a tree decomposition. The width of any separation in this decomposition is, again, bounded by the sum of the sizes of the separators on a path from any node to the root of the hierarchy, so any branch-decomposition formed in this way has width O(√''n'') and any planar graph has [[branchwidth]] O(√''n''). Although many other related graph partitioning problems are [[NP-complete]], even for planar graphs, it is possible to find a minimum-width branch-decomposition of a planar graph in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Seymour|Thomas|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By applying methods of {{harvtxt|Alon|Seymour|Thomas|1994}} more directly in the construction of branch-decompositions, {{harvtxt|Fomin|Thilikos|2006a}} show that every planar graph has branchwidth at most 2.12√''n'', with the same constant as the one in the simple cycle separator theorem of Alon et al. Since the treewidth of any graph is at most 3/2 its branchwidth, this also shows that planar graphs have treewidth at most 3.18√''n''.

==Other classes of graphs==
Some [[sparse graph]]s do not have separators of sublinear size: in an [[expander graph]], deleting up to a constant fraction of the vertices still leaves only one connected component.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lipton|Tarjan|1979}}; {{harvtxt|Erdős|Graham|Szemerédi|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly the earliest known separator theorem is a result of {{harvtxt|Jordan|1869}} that any [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] can be partitioned into subtrees of at most ''n''/2 vertices each by the removal of a single vertex.&lt;ref name="mttv97"&gt;{{harvtxt|Miller|Teng|Thurston|Vavasis|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the vertex that minimizes the maximum component size has this property, for if it did not then its neighbor in the unique large subtree would form an even better partition. By applying the same technique to a [[tree decomposition]] of an arbitrary graph, it is possible to show that any graph has a separator of size at most equal to its [[treewidth]].

If a graph ''G'' is not planar, but can be [[graph embedding|embedded]] on a surface of [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]] ''g'', then it has a separator with O((''gn'')&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;) vertices. {{harvtxt|Gilbert|Hutchinson|Tarjan|1984}} prove this by using a similar approach to that of {{harvtxt|Lipton|Tarjan|1979}}. They group the vertices of the graph into breadth-first levels and find two levels the removal of which leaves at most one large component consisting of a small number of levels. This remaining component can be made planar by removing a number of breadth-first paths proportional to the genus, after which the Lipton–Tarjan method can be applied to the remaining planar graph. The result follows from a careful balancing of the size of the removed two levels against the number of levels between them. If the graph embedding is given as part of the input, its separator can be found in [[linear time]]. Graphs of genus ''g'' also have edge separators of size O((''g''Δ''n'')&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sýkora|Vrt'o|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphs of bounded genus form an example of a family of graphs closed under the operation of taking [[Minor (graph theory)|minors]], and separator theorems also apply to arbitrary minor-closed graph families. In particular, if a graph family has a [[forbidden minor]] with ''h'' vertices, then it has a separator with O(''h''√''n'') vertices, and such a separator can be found in time O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;&amp;epsilon;&lt;/sup&gt;) for any &amp;epsilon;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kawarabayashi|Reed|2010}}.

The circle separator method of {{harvtxt|Miller|Teng|Thurston|Vavasis|1997}} generalizes to the intersection graphs of any system of ''d''-dimensional balls with the property that any point in space is covered by at most some constant number ''k'' of balls, to ''k''-[[nearest-neighbor graph]]s in ''d'' dimensions,&lt;ref name="mttv97"/&gt; and to the graphs arising from [[finite element method|finite element meshes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Miller|Teng|Thurston|Vavasis|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sphere separators constructed in this way partition the input graph into subgraphs of at most {{nowrap|''n''(''d'' + 1)/(''d'' + 2)}} vertices. The size of the separators for ''k''-ply ball intersection graphs and for ''k''-nearest-neighbor graphs is O(''k''&lt;sup&gt;1/''d''&lt;/sup&gt;''n''&lt;sup&gt;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1/''d''&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="mttv97"/&gt;

==Applications==

===Divide and conquer algorithms===
Separator decompositions can be of use in designing efficient [[divide and conquer algorithm]]s for solving problems on planar graphs. As an example, one problem that can be solved in this way is to find the shortest [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]] in a weighted planar digraph. This may be solved by the following steps:
*Partition the given graph ''G'' into three subsets ''S'', ''A'', ''B'' according to the planar separator theorem
*Recursively search for the shortest cycles in ''A'' and ''B''
*Use [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] to find, for each ''s'' in ''S'', the shortest cycle through ''s'' in ''G''.
*Return the shortest of the cycles found by the above steps.
The time for the two recursive calls to ''A'' and ''B'' in this algorithm is dominated by the time to perform the O(√''n'') calls to Dijkstra's algorithm, so this algorithm finds the shortest cycle in O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') time.

A faster algorithm for the same shortest cycle problem, running in time O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''n''), was given by {{harvtxt|Wulff-Nilsen|2009}}. His algorithm uses the same separator-based divide and conquer structure, but uses simple cycle separators rather than arbitrary separators, so that the vertices of ''S'' belong to a single face of the graphs inside and outside the cycle separator. He then replaces the O(√''n'')  separate calls to Dijkstra's algorithm with more sophisticated algorithms to find shortest paths from all vertices on a single face of a planar graph and to combine the distances from the two subgraphs. For weighted but undirected planar graphs, the shortest cycle is equivalent to the [[minimum cut]] in the [[dual graph]] and can be found in O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') time,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Łącki|Sankowski|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the shortest cycle in an unweighted undirected planar graph (its [[girth (graph theory)|girth]]) may be found in time O(''n'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Chang|Lu|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (However, the faster algorithm for unweighted graphs is not based on the separator theorem.)

Frederickson proposed another faster algorithm for single source shortest paths by implementing separator theorem in planar graphs in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Greg n. Frederickson, Fast algorithms for shortest paths in planar graphs, with applications, SIAM J. Comput., pp. 1004-1022, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an improvement of Dijkstra's algorithm with [[iterative]] search on a carefully selected subset of the vertices. This version takes O(''n'' √(log ''n'')) time in an ''n''-vertex graph. Separators are used to find a division of a graph, that is, a partition of the edge-set into two or more subsets, called regions. A node is said to be contained in a region if some edge of the region is incident to the node. A node contained in more that one region is called a boundary node of the regions containing it. The method uses the notion of a ''r''-division of an ''n''-node graph that is a graph division into O(''n''/''r'') regions, each containing O(''r'') nodes including O(√''r'') boundary nodes. Frederickson showed that an ''r''-division can be found in O(''n'' log ''n'') time by [[recursive]] application of separator theorem.

The sketch of his algorithm to solve the problem is as follows.

1. Preprocessing Phase: Partition the graph into carefully selected subsets of vertices and determine the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in these subsets, where intermediate vertices on this path are not in the subset. This phase requires a planar graph ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp; to be transformed into ''G'' with no vertex having degree greater than 3. From a corollary of [[Euler]]'s formula, the number of vertices in the resulting graph will be ''n'' ≤ 6''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;-12, where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp; is the number of vertices in ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;. This phase also ensures the following properties of a suitable ''r''-division. A suitable ''r''-division of a planar graph is an ''r''-division such that,
* each boundary vertex is contained in at most three regions, and
* any region that is not connected consists of connected components, all of which share boundary vertices with exactly the same set of either one or two connected regions.

2. Search Phase:
* Main Thrust: Find Shortest distances from the source to each vertex in the subset. When a vertex ''v'' in the subset is closed, ''d''(''w'') must be updated for all vertices ''w'' in the subset such that a path exists from ''v'' to ''w''.
* Mop-up: Determine shortest distances to every remaining vertex.

Henzinger et. al. extended Frederickson's ''r''-division technique for the single source shortest path algorithm in planar graphs for nonnegative edge-lengths and proposed a [[linear time]] algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;Monika R. Henzinger , Philip Klein , Satish Rao , Sairam Subramanian, \textit{Faster shortest-path algorithms for planar graphs}, Journal of Computer and System Science, Vol. 55, Issue 1, August 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Their method generalizes Frederickson's notion of graph-divisions such that now an (''r'',''s'')-division of an ''n''-node graph be a division into O(''n''/''r'') regions, each containing ''r''&lt;sup&gt;{O(1)}&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp; nodes, each having at most ''s'' boundary nodes. If an (''r'', ''s'')-division is repeatedly divided into smaller regions, that is called get a recursive division. This algorithm uses approximately log*''n'' levels of divisions. The recursive division is represented by a [[rooted tree]] whose leaves are labeled by distinct edge of ''G''. The root of the [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] represents the region consisting of full-''G'', the children of the root represent the subregions into which that region is divided and so on. Each [[leaf]] (atomic region) represents a region containing exactly one edge.

[[Nested dissection]] is a separator based divide and conquer variation of [[Gaussian elimination]] for solving [[sparse matrix|sparse]] [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] [[System of linear equations|systems of linear equations]] with a planar graph structure, such as the ones arising from the [[finite element method]]. It involves finding a separator for the graph describing the system of equations, recursively eliminating the variables in the two subproblems separated from each other by the separator, and then eliminating the variables in the separator.&lt;ref name="g73"/&gt; The fill-in of this method (the number of nonzero coefficients of the resulting [[Cholesky decomposition]] of the matrix) is O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lipton|Rose|Tarjan|1979}}; {{harvtxt|Gilbert|Tarjan|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing this method to be competitive with [[iterative methods]] for the same problems.&lt;ref name="g73"/&gt;

Klein, Mozes and Weimann &lt;ref&gt;Philip N. Klein, Shay Mozes and Oren Weimann, Shortest Paths in Directed Planar Graphs with Negative Lengths: a Linear-Space O(n log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp; n)-Time Algorithm}, Proceedings of the Twentieth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; gave an O(''n'' log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'')-time, linear-space algorithm to find the shortest path distances from ''s'' to all nodes for a directed planar graph with positive and negative arc-lengths containing no negative cycles. Their algorithm uses planar graph separators to find a [[Jordan curve]] ''C'' that passes through O(√''n'') nodes (and no arcs) such that between ''n''/3 and 2''n''/3 nodes are enclosed by ''C''. Nodes through which ''C'' passes are [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] nodes. The original graph ''G'' is separated into two subgraphs ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp; and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp; by cutting the planar embedding along ''C'' and duplicating the boundary nodes.  For ''i'' = 0 and 1, in ''G''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp; the boundary nodes lie on the boundary of a single face ''F''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;.

The overview of their approach is given below. 
* Recursive call: The first stage recursively computes the distances from ''r'' within ''G''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp; for ''i'' = 0, 1. 
* Intra-part boundary-distances: For each graph ''G'' &lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp; compute all distances in G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp; between boundary nodes. This takes O(''n'' log ''n'') time.
* Single-source inter-part boundary distances: A shortest path in ''G'' passes back and forth between G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp; and G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp; to compute the distances in ''G'' from ''r'' to all the boundary nodes. Alternating iterations use the all-boundary-distances in $G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp; and $G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;. The number of iterations is O(√''n''), so the overall time for this stage is O(''n'' α(''n'')) where α(n) is the inverse [[Ackermann function]].
* Single-source inter-part distances: The distances computed in the previous stages are used, together with a Dijkstra computation within a modified version of each G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;, to compute the distances in ''G'' from ''r'' to all the nodes. This stage takes O(''n'' log ''n'') time.
* Rerooting single-source distances: The distances from ''r'' in ''G'' are transformed into nonnegative lengths, and again Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to compute distances from ''s''. This stage requires O(''n'' log ''n'') time.

An important part of this algorithm is the use of Price Functions and Reduced Lengths. For a directed graph ''G'' with arc-lengths ι(·), a price function is a function φ from the nodes of ''G'' to the [[real number]]s. For an arc ''uv'', the reduced length with respect to φ is ιφ(''uv'') = ι(''uv'') + φ(''u'') − φ(''v''). A feasible price function is a price function that induces nonnegative reduced lengths on all arcs of ''G''. It is useful in transforming a shortest-path problem involving positive and negative lengths into one involving only nonnegative lengths, which can then be solved using Dijkstra’s algorithm.

The separator based divide and conquer paradigm has also been used to design [[data structure]]s for [[Dynamic problem (algorithms)|dynamic graph algorithms]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eppstein|Galil|Italiano|Spencer|1996}}; {{harvtxt|Eppstein|Galil|Italiano|Spencer|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[point location]],&lt;ref name="lt80"/&gt; algorithms for [[polygon triangulation]],&lt;ref name="g95"/&gt; [[shortest path]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Klein|Rao|Rauch|Subramanian|1994}}; {{harvtxt|Tazari|Müller-Hannemann|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the construction of [[nearest neighbor graph]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Frieze|Miller|Teng|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[approximation algorithm]]s for the [[maximum independent set]] of a planar graph.&lt;ref name="lt80"&gt;{{harvtxt|Lipton|Tarjan|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exact solution of NP-hard optimization problems===
By using [[dynamic programming]] on a [[tree decomposition]] or [[branch-decomposition]] of a planar graph, many [[NP-hard]] optimization problems may be solved in time exponential in √''n'' or √''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n''. For instance, bounds of this form are known for finding [[maximum independent set]]s, [[Steiner tree]]s, and [[Hamiltonian cycle]]s, and for solving the [[travelling salesman problem]] on planar graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bern|1990}}; {{harvtxt|Deĭneko|Klinz|Woeginger|2006}}; {{harvtxt|Dorn|Penninkx|Bodlaender|Fomin|2005}}; {{harvtxt|Lipton|Tarjan|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar methods involving separator theorems for geometric graphs may be used to solve Euclidean travelling salesman problem and [[Steiner tree]] construction problems in time bounds of the same form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Smith|Wormald|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[parameterized complexity|parameterized]] problems that admit a [[kernelization]] that preserves planarity and reduces the input graph to a kernel of size linear in the input parameter, this approach can be used to design [[fixed-parameter tractability|fixed-parameter tractable]] algorithms the running time of which depends polynomially on the size of the input graph and exponentially on √''k'', where ''k'' is the parameter of the algorithm. For instance, time bounds of this form are known for finding [[vertex cover]]s and [[dominating set]]s of size ''k''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Alber|Fernau|Niedermeier|2003}}; {{harvtxt|Fomin|Thilikos|2006b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approximation algorithms===
{{harvtxt|Lipton|Tarjan|1980}} observed that the separator theorem may be used to obtain [[polynomial time approximation scheme]]s for [[NP-hard]] optimization problems on planar graphs such as finding the [[maximum independent set]]. Specifically, by truncating a separator hierarchy at an appropriate level, one may find a separator of size O(''n''/√log&amp;nbsp;''n'') the removal of which partitions the graph into subgraphs of size ''c''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'', for any constant ''c''. By the [[four-color theorem]], there exists an independent set of size at least ''n''/4, so the removed nodes form a negligible fraction of the maximum independent set, and the maximum independent sets in the remaining subgraphs can be found independently in time exponential in their size. By combining this approach with later linear-time methods for separator hierarchy construction&lt;ref name="g95"/&gt; and with table lookup to share the computation of independent sets between [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] subgraphs, it can be made to construct independent sets of size within a factor of 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;O(1/√log&amp;nbsp;''n'') of optimal, in linear time. However, for [[approximation ratio]]s even closer to 1 than this factor, a later approach of {{harvtxt|Baker|1994}} (based on tree-decomposition but not on planar separators) provides better tradeoffs of time versus approximation quality.

Similar separator-based approximation schemes have also been used to approximate other hard problems such as [[vertex cover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bar-Yehuda|Even|1982}}; {{harvtxt|Chiba|Nishizeki|Saito|1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Arora|Grigni|Karger|Klein|1998}} use separators in a different way to approximate the [[travelling salesman problem]] for the [[shortest path]] [[metric space|metric]] on weighted planar graphs; their algorithm uses dynamic programming to find the shortest tour that, at each level of a separator hierarchy, crosses the separator a bounded number of times, and they show that as the crossing bound increases the tours constructed in this way have lengths that approximate the optimal tour.

===Graph compression===
Separators have been used as part of [[data compression]] algorithms for representing planar graphs and other separable graphs using a small number of bits. The basic principle of these algorithms is to choose a number ''k'' and repeatedly subdivide the given planar graph using separators into O(''n''/''k'') subgraphs of size at most ''k'', with O(''n''/√''k'') vertices in the separators. With an appropriate choice of ''k'' (at most proportional to the [[logarithm]] of ''n'') the number of [[graph isomorphism|non-isomorphic]] ''k''-vertex planar subgraphs is significantly less than the number of subgraphs in the decomposition, so the graph can be compressed by constructing a table of all the possible non-isomorphic subgraphs and representing each subgraph in the separator decomposition by its index into the table. The remainder of the graph, formed by the separator vertices, may be represented explicitly or by using a recursive version of the same data structure. Using this method, planar graphs and many more restricted families of graphs may be encoded using a number of bits that is [[information theory|information-theoretically]] optimal: if there are ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''n''-vertex graphs in the family of graphs to be represented, then an individual graph in the family can be represented using only (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;o(''n''))log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' bits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|He|Kao|Lu|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to construct representations of this type in which one may test adjacency between vertices, determine the degree of a vertex, and list neighbors of vertices in constant time per query, by augmenting the table of subgraphs with additional tabular information representing the answers to the queries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Blandford|Blelloch|Kash|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Blelloch|Farzan|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Universal graphs===
A [[universal graph]] for a family ''F'' of graphs is a graph that contains every member of ''F'' as a subgraphs. Separators can be used to show that the ''n''-vertex planar graphs have universal graphs with ''n'' vertices and O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;) edges.&lt;ref name="universal"&gt;{{harvtxt|Babai|Chung|Erdős|Graham|1982}}; {{harvtxt|Bhatt|Chung|Leighton|Rosenberg|1989}}; {{harvtxt|Chung|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction involves a strengthened form of the separator theorem in which the size of the three subsets of vertices in the separator does not depend on the graph structure: there exists a number ''c'', the magnitude of which at most a constant times √''n'', such that the vertices of every ''n''-vertex planar graph can be separated into subsets ''A'', ''S'', and ''B'', with no edges from ''A'' to ''B'', with |''S''|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'', and with |''A''|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;|''B''|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''c'')/2. This may be shown by using the usual form of the separator theorem repeatedly to partition the graph until all the components of the partition can be arranged into two subsets of fewer than ''n''/2 vertices, and then moving vertices from these subsets into the separator as necessary until it has the given size.

Once a separator theorem of this type is shown, it can be used to produce a separator hierarchy for ''n''-vertex planar graphs that again does not depend on the graph structure: the tree-decomposition formed from this hierarchy has width O(√''n'') and can be used for any planar graph. The set of all pairs of vertices in this tree-decomposition that both belong to a common node of the tree-decomposition forms a [[trivially perfect graph]] with O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;) vertices that contains every ''n''-vertex planar graph as a subgraph. A similar construction shows that bounded-degree planar graphs have universal graphs with O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') edges, where the constant hidden in the [[O notation]] depends on the degree bound. Any universal graph for planar graphs (or even for trees of unbounded degree) must have Ω(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') edges, but it remains unknown whether this lower bound or the O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;) upper bound is tight for universal graphs for arbitrary planar graphs.&lt;ref name="universal"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8311">In [[potential theory]], the '''Poisson kernel''' is an [[integral kernel]], used for solving the two-dimensional [[Laplace equation]], given [[Dirichlet boundary condition]]s on the [[unit disc]]. The kernel can be understood as the [[derivative]] of the [[Green's function]] for the Laplace equation. It is named for [[Siméon Poisson]].

Poisson kernels commonly find applications in [[control theory]] and two-dimensional problems in [[electrostatics]].
In practice, the definition of Poisson kernels are often extended to ''n''-dimensional problems.

==Two-dimensional Poisson kernels==

=== On the unit disc ===

In the [[complex plane]], the Poisson kernel for the unit disc is given by

:&lt;math&gt;P_r(\theta) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty r^{|n|}e^{in\theta} = \frac{1-r^2}{1-2r\cos\theta +r^2} = \operatorname{Re}\left(\frac{1+re^{i\theta}}{1-re^{i\theta}}\right), \ \ \ 0 \le r &lt; 1.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be thought of in two ways: either as a function of ''r'' and ''θ'', or as a family of functions of ''θ'' indexed by ''r''.

If &lt;math&gt;D = \{z:|z|&lt;1\}&lt;/math&gt; is the open [[unit disc]] in '''C''', '''T''' is the boundary of the disc, and ''f'' a function on '''T''' that lies in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''), then the function ''u'' given by

:&lt;math&gt;u(re^{i\theta}) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi P_r(\theta-t)f(e^{it}) \, \mathrm{d}t, \ \ \ 0 \le r &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;

is [[Harmonic function|harmonic]] in '''D''' and has a radial limit that agrees with ''f'' [[almost everywhere]] on the boundary '''T''' of the disc.

That the boundary value of ''u'' is ''f'' can be argued using the fact that as ''r'' → 1, the functions ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''θ'') form an [[approximate identity|approximate unit]] in the [[convolution algebra]] ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''). As linear operators, they tend to the [[Dirac delta function]] pointwise on ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T'''). By the [[maximum principle]], ''u'' is the only such harmonic function on ''D''.

Convolutions with this approximate unit gives an example of a [[summability kernel]] for the [[Fourier series]] of a function in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') {{harv|Katznelson|1976}}. Let ''f'' ∈ ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') have Fourier series {''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}. After the [[Fourier transform]], convolution with ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''θ'') becomes multiplication by the sequence {''r&lt;sup&gt;|k|&lt;/sup&gt;''}  ∈ ''l''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''Z''').{{elucidate|date=January 2015}} Taking the inverse Fourier transform of the resulting product {''r&lt;sup&gt;|k|&lt;/sup&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''} gives the  [[Abel's theorem|Abel means]] ''A&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;f'' of ''f'':

:&lt;math&gt; A_r f(e^{2 \pi i x}) = \sum _{k \in \mathbf{Z}} f_k r^{|k|} e^{2 \pi i k x}.&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging this [[absolutely convergent]] series shows that ''f'' is the boundary value of ''g'' + ''h'', where ''g'' (resp. ''h'') is a [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] (resp. [[antiholomorphic]]) function on ''D''.

When one also asks for the harmonic extension to be holomorphic, then the solutions are elements of a [[Hardy space]]. This is true when the negative Fourier coefficients of ''f'' all vanish. In particular, the Poisson kernel is commonly used to demonstrate the equivalence of the Hardy spaces on the unit disk, and the unit circle.

The space of functions that are the limits on T of functions in ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''(''z'') may be called ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T'''). It is a closed subspace of ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''') (at least for ''p''≥1). Since ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''') is a [[Banach space]] (for 1 ≤ ''p'' ≤ ∞), so is ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''').

===On the upper half-plane===
The [[unit disk]] may be [[conformal map|conformally mapped]] to the [[upper half-plane]] by means of certain [[Möbius transformation]]s. Since the conformal map of a harmonic function is also harmonic, the Poisson kernel carries over to the upper half-plane. In this case, the Poisson integral equation takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;u(x+iy)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty P_y(x-t)f(t) dt, \qquad y &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The kernel itself is given by

:&lt;math&gt;P_y(x)=\frac{1}{\pi}\frac {y}{x^2 + y^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Given a function &lt;math&gt;f\in L^p(\mathbf{R})&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Lp space|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' space]] of integrable functions on the real line, ''u'' can be understood as a harmonic extension of ''f'' into the upper half-plane. In analogy to the situation for the disk, when ''u'' is holomorphic in the upper half-plane, then ''u'' is an element of the Hardy space, &lt;math&gt;H^p,&lt;/math&gt; and in particular,

:&lt;math&gt;\|u\|_{H^p}=\|f\|_{L^p}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, again, the Hardy space ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' on the upper half-plane is a [[Banach space]], and, in particular, its restriction to the real axis is a closed subspace of &lt;math&gt;L^p(\mathbf{R}).&lt;/math&gt; The situation is only analogous to the case for the unit disk; the [[Lebesgue measure]] for the unit circle is finite, whereas that for the real line is not.

==On the ball==
For the ball of radius &lt;math&gt;r, B_r \subset \mathbf{R}^n,&lt;/math&gt; the Poisson kernel takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;P(x,\zeta) = \frac{r^2-|x|^2}{r\omega _{n-1}|x-\zeta|^n}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x\in B_r, \zeta\in S&lt;/math&gt; (the surface of &lt;math&gt;B_{r}&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;\omega _{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Unit sphere#General area and volume formulas|surface area of the unit (''n''−1)-sphere]].

Then, if ''u''(''x'') is a continuous function defined on ''S'', the corresponding Poisson integral is the function ''P''[''u''](''x'') defined by

:&lt;math&gt;P[u](x) = \int_S u(\zeta)P(x,\zeta)d\sigma(\zeta).&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that ''P''[''u''](''x'') is harmonic on the ball &lt;math&gt;B_{r}&lt;/math&gt; and that ''P''[''u''](''x'') extends to a continuous function on the closed ball of radius ''r'', and the boundary function coincides with the original function ''u''.

==On the upper half-space==
An expression for the Poisson kernel of an [[upper half-space]] can also be obtained.  Denote the standard Cartesian coordinates of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;(t,x) = (t,x_1,\dots,x_n).&lt;/math&gt; 
The upper half-space is the set defined by
:&lt;math&gt;H^{n+1} = \{ (t;\mathbf{x}) \in\mathbf{R}^{n+1} \mid t&gt;0\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The Poisson kernel for ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;P(t,x) = c_n\frac{t}{(t^2+|x|^2)^{(n+1)/2}}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;c_n = \frac{\Gamma[(n+1)/2]}{\pi^{(n+1)/2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Poisson kernel for the upper half-space appears naturally as the [[Fourier transform]] of the [[Abel kernel]]
:&lt;math&gt;K(t,\xi) = e^{-2\pi t|\xi|}&lt;/math&gt;
in which ''t'' assumes the role of an auxiliary parameter.  To wit,
:&lt;math&gt;P(t,x) = \mathcal{F}(K(t,\cdot))(x) = \int_{\mathbf{R}^n} e^{-2\pi t|\xi|} e^{-2\pi i \xi\cdot x}\,d\xi.&lt;/math&gt;
In particular, it is clear from the properties of the Fourier transform that, at least formally, the convolution
:&lt;math&gt;P[u](t,x) = [P(t,\cdot)*u](x)&lt;/math&gt;
is a solution of Laplace's equation in the upper half-plane.  One can also show that as ''t''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;0, ''P''[''u''](''t'',''x'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''u''(''x'') in a suitable sense.

In [[number theory]], a '''practical number''' or '''panarithmic number'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Margenstern|1991}} cites {{harvtxt|Robinson|1979}} and {{harvtxt|Heyworth|1980}} for the name "panarithmic numbers".&lt;/ref&gt; is a positive integer ''n'' such that all smaller positive integers can be represented as sums of distinct [[divisor]]s of ''n''. For example, 12 is a practical number because all the numbers from 1 to 11 can be expressed as sums of its divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: as well as these divisors themselves, we have 5 = 3 + 2, 7 = 6 + 1, 8 = 6 + 2, 9 = 6 + 3, 10 = 6 + 3 + 1, and 11 = 6 + 3 + 2.

The sequence of practical numbers {{OEIS|A005153}} begins
:1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 30, 32, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 64, 66, 72, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 96, 100, 104, 108, 112, 120, 126, 128, 132, 140, 144, 150....

Practical numbers were used by [[Fibonacci]] in his [[Liber Abaci]] (1202) in connection with the problem of representing rational numbers as [[Egyptian fraction]]s. Fibonacci does not formally define practical numbers, but he gives a table of Egyptian fraction expansions for fractions with practical denominators.&lt;ref name="sigler"&gt;{{harvtxt|Sigler|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "practical number" is due to  {{harvtxt|Srinivasan|1948}}. He noted that "the subdivisions of money, weights, and measures involve numbers like 4, 12, 16, 20 and 28 which are usually supposed to be so inconvenient as to deserve replacement by powers of 10." He rediscovered the number theoretical property of such numbers and was the first to attempt a classification of these numbers that was completed by {{harvtxt|Stewart|1954}} and {{harvtxt|Sierpiński|1955}}. This characterization makes it possible to determine whether a number is practical by examining its prime factorization. Every even [[perfect number]] and every [[power of two]] is also a practical number.

Practical numbers have also been shown to be analogous with [[prime number]]s in many of their properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hausman|Shapiro|1984}}; {{harvtxt|Margenstern|1991}}; {{harvtxt|Melfi|1996}}; {{harvtxt|Saias|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterization of practical numbers==
The original characterisation by {{harvtxt|Srinivasan|1948}} stated that a practical number cannot be a [[deficient number]], that is one of which the sum of all divisors (including 1 and itself) is less than twice the number unless the deficiency is one. If the ordered set of all divisors of the practical number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;{d_1, d_2,..., d_j}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;d_1=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_j=n&lt;/math&gt;, then Srinivasan's statement can be expressed by the inequality
:&lt;math&gt;2n\leq1+\sum_{i=1}^j d_i&lt;/math&gt;.

In other words, the ordered sequence of all divisors &lt;math&gt;{d_1&lt;d_2&lt;...&lt;d_j}&lt;/math&gt; of a practical number has to be a [[Complete sequence|complete sub-sequence]].

This partial characterization was extended and completed by {{harvtxt|Stewart|1954}} and {{harvtxt|Sierpiński|1955}} who showed that it is straightforward to determine whether a number is practical from its [[prime factorization]].
A positive integer greater than one with prime factorization &lt;math&gt;n=p_1^{\alpha_1}...p_k^{\alpha_k}&lt;/math&gt; (with the primes in sorted order &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;p_2&lt;\dots&lt;p_k&lt;/math&gt;) is practical if and only if each of its prime factors &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is small enough for &lt;math&gt;p_i-1&lt;/math&gt; to have a representation as a sum of smaller divisors. For this to be true, the first prime &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; must equal 2 and, for every {{mvar|i}} from 2 to&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|k}}, each successive prime &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; must obey the inequality
:&lt;math&gt;p_i\leq1+\sigma(p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2}\dots p_{i-1}^{\alpha_{i-1}})=1+\prod_{j=1}^{i-1}\frac{p_j^{\alpha_j+1}-1}{p_j-1},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Divisor function|sum of the divisors]] of ''x''. For example, 2 × 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 29 × 823 = 429606 is practical, because the inequality above holds for each of its prime factors: 3 ≤ σ(2) + 1 = 4, 29 ≤ σ(2 × 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + 1 = 40, and 823 ≤ σ(2 × 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 29) + 1 = 1171.

The condition stated above is necessary and sufficient for a number to be practical. In one direction, this condition is necessary in order to be able to represent &lt;math&gt;p_i-1&lt;/math&gt; as a sum of divisors of ''n'', because if the inequality failed to be true then even adding together all the smaller divisors would give a sum too small to reach &lt;math&gt;p_i-1&lt;/math&gt;. In the other direction, the condition is sufficient, as can be shown by induction. 
More strongly, if the factorization of ''n'' satisfies the condition above, then any &lt;math&gt;m \le \sigma(n)&lt;/math&gt; can be represented as a sum of divisors of ''n'', by the following sequence of steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stewart|1954}}; {{harvtxt|Sierpiński|1955}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Let &lt;math&gt;q = \min\{\lfloor m/p_k^{\alpha_k}\rfloor, \sigma(n/p_k^{\alpha_k})\}&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;r = m - qp_k^{\sigma_k}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Since &lt;math&gt;q\le\sigma(n/p_k^{\alpha_k})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n/p_k^{\alpha_k}&lt;/math&gt; can be shown by induction to be practical, we can find a representation of ''q'' as a sum of divisors of &lt;math&gt;n/p_k^{\alpha_k}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Since &lt;math&gt;r\le \sigma(n) - p_k^{\alpha_k}\sigma(n/p_k^{\alpha_k}) = \sigma(n/p_k)&lt;/math&gt;, and since &lt;math&gt;n/p_k&lt;/math&gt; can be shown by induction to be practical, we can find a representation of ''r'' as a sum of divisors of &lt;math&gt;n/p_k&lt;/math&gt;.
* The divisors representing ''r'', together with &lt;math&gt;p_k^{\alpha_k}&lt;/math&gt; times each of the divisors representing ''q'', together form a representation of ''m'' as a sum of divisors of ''n''.

==Properties==
*The only odd practical number is 1, because if ''n'' &gt; 2 is an odd number, then 2 cannot be expressed as the sum of distinct divisors of&amp;nbsp;''n''. More strongly, {{harvtxt|Srinivasan|1948}} observes that other than 1 and 2, every practical number is divisible by 4 or 6 (or both).
*The product of two practical numbers is also a practical number.{{sfnp|Margenstern|1991}} More strongly the [[least common multiple]] of any two practical numbers is also a practical number. Equivalently, the set of all practical numbers is closed under multiplication.
*From the above characterization by Stewart and Sierpiński it can be seen that if ''n'' is a practical number and ''d'' is one of its divisors then ''n*d'' must also be a practical number. 
*In the set of all practical numbers there is a primitive set of practical numbers. A primitive practical number is either practical and [[squarefree]] or practical and when divided by any of its prime factors whose [[Prime factorization|factorization]] exponent is greater than 1 is no longer practical. The sequence of primitive practical numbers {{OEIS|A267124|}} begins
::1, 2, 6, 20, 28, 30, 42, 66, 78, 88, 104, 140, 204, 210, 220, 228, 260, 272, 276, 304, 306, 308, 330, 340, 342, 348, 364, 368, 380, 390, 414, 460 ...

==Relation to other classes of numbers==
Several other notable sets of integers consist only of practical numbers:
*From the above properties with ''n'' a practical number and ''d'' one of its divisors (that is, ''d'' | ''n'') then ''n*d'' must also be a practical number therefore six times every power of 3 must be a practical number as well as six times every power of 2.
*Every [[power of two]] is a practical number.&lt;ref name="s48"/&gt; Powers of two trivially satisfy the characterization of practical numbers in terms of their prime factorizations: the only prime in their factorizations, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, equals two as required. 
*Every even [[perfect number]] is also a practical number.&lt;ref name="s48"/&gt; This follows from [[Leonhard Euler]]'s result that an even perfect number must have the form 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1). The odd part of this factorization equals the sum of the divisors of the even part, so every odd prime factor of such a number must be at most the sum of the divisors of the even part of the number. Therefore, this number must satisfy the characterization of practical numbers.
*Every [[primorial]] (the product of the first ''i'' primes, for some ''i'') is practical.&lt;ref name="s48"/&gt; For the first two primorials, two and six, this is clear. Each successive primorial is formed by multiplying a prime number ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; by a smaller primorial that is divisible by both two and the next smaller prime, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;. By [[Bertrand's postulate]], ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;, so each successive prime factor in the primorial is less than one of the divisors of the previous primorial. By induction, it follows that every primorial satisfies the characterization of practical numbers. Because a primorial is, by definition, squarefree it is also a primitive practical number.
*Generalizing the primorials, any number that is the product of nonzero powers of the first ''k'' primes must also be practical. This includes [[Ramanujan]]'s [[highly composite number]]s (numbers with more divisors than any smaller positive integer) as well as the [[factorial]] numbers.&lt;ref name="s48"&gt;{{harvtxt|Srinivasan|1948}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical numbers and Egyptian fractions==
If ''n'' is practical, then any [[rational number]] of the form ''m''/''n'' with ''m'' &lt; ''n'' may be represented as a sum ∑''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''/''n'' where each ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a distinct divisor of ''n''. Each term in this sum simplifies to a [[unit fraction]], so such a sum provides a representation of ''m''/''n'' as an [[Egyptian fraction]]. For instance,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{13}{20}=\frac{10}{20}+\frac{2}{20}+\frac{1}{20}=\frac12+\frac1{10}+\frac1{20}.&lt;/math&gt;

Fibonacci, in his 1202 book ''[[Liber Abaci]]''&lt;ref name="sigler"/&gt; lists several methods for finding Egyptian fraction representations of a rational number. Of these, the first is to test whether the number is itself already a unit fraction, but the second is to search for a representation of the numerator as a sum of divisors of the denominator, as described above. This method is only guaranteed to succeed for denominators that are practical. Fibonacci provides tables of these representations for fractions having as denominators the practical numbers 6, 8, 12, 20, 24, 60, and 100.

{{harvtxt|Vose|1985}} showed that every number ''x''/''y'' has an Egyptian fraction representation with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle O(\sqrt{\log y})&lt;/math&gt; terms. The proof involves finding a sequence of practical numbers ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with the property that every number less than ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; may be written as a sum of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle O(\sqrt{\log n_{i-1}})&lt;/math&gt; distinct divisors of ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, ''i'' is chosen so that ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''xn&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is divided by ''y'' giving quotient ''q'' and remainder ''r''. It follows from these choices that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\frac{x}{y}=\frac{q}{n_i}+\frac{r}{yn_i}&lt;/math&gt;. Expanding both numerators on the right hand side of this formula into sums of divisors of ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; results in the desired Egyptian fraction representation. {{harvtxt|Tenenbaum|Yokota|1990}} use a similar technique involving a different sequence of practical numbers to show that every number ''x''/''y'' has an Egyptian fraction representation in which the largest denominator is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle O(\frac{y\log^2 y}{\log\log y})&lt;/math&gt;.

According to a September 2015 conjecture by [[Zhi-Wei Sun]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://maths.nju.edu.cn/~zwsun/UnitFraction.pdf A Conjecture on Unit Fractions Involving Primes]&lt;/ref&gt; every positive rational number has an Egyptian fraction representation in which every denominator is a practical number. There is a proof for the conjecture on [[David Eppstein]]'s blog.&lt;ref&gt;[https://11011110.github.io/blog/2016/11/20/egyptian-fractions-with.html 0xDE: Egyptian fractions with practical denominators]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analogies with prime numbers ==

One reason for interest in practical numbers is that many of their properties are similar to properties of the [[prime numbers]]. 
Indeed, theorems analogous to [[Goldbach's conjecture]] and the [[twin prime conjecture]] are known for practical numbers: every positive even integer is the sum of two practical numbers, and there exist infinitely many triples of practical numbers ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;''x'',&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Melfi|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giuseppe Melfi|Melfi]] also showed that there are infinitely many practical [[Fibonacci number]]s {{OEIS|id=A124105}}; the analogous question of the existence of infinitely many [[Fibonacci prime]]s is open. {{harvtxt|Hausman|Shapiro|1984}} showed that there always exists a practical number in the interval [''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] for any positive real ''x'', a result analogous to [[Legendre's conjecture]] for primes.

Let ''p''(''x'') count how many practical numbers are at most&amp;nbsp;''x''.
{{harvtxt|Margenstern|1991}} conjectured that ''p''(''x'') is asymptotic to ''cx''/log&amp;nbsp;''x'' for some constant ''c'', a formula which resembles the [[prime number theorem]], strengthening the earlier claim of {{harvtxt|Erdős|Loxton|1979}} that the practical numbers have density zero in the integers.
{{harvtxt|Saias|1997}} proved that for suitable constants ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;c_1\frac x{\log x}&lt;p(x)&lt;c_2\frac x{\log x},&lt;/math&gt;

Finally {{harvtxt|Weingartner|2015}} proved Margenstern's conjecture showing that

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = \frac{c x}{\log x}\left(1 + O\!\left(\frac{\log \log x}{\log x}\right)\right),&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;x \geq 3&lt;/math&gt; and some constant &lt;math&gt;c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof by intimidation''' (or argumentum verbosium) is a [[jocular]] phrase used mainly in [[mathematics]] to refer to a style of presenting a purported [[mathematical proof]] by giving an argument loaded with jargon and appeal to obscure results, so that the audience is simply obliged to accept it, lest they have to admit their ignorance and lack of understanding.&lt;ref&gt;

|pages=15–16

&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is also used when the author is an authority in their field presenting their proof to people who respect ''a priori'' the author's insistence that the [[invalid proof|proof is valid]] or when the author claims that their statement is true because it is trivial or because they simply say so. Usage of this phrase is for the most part in good humour, though it also appears in serious criticism.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

"Proof by intimidation" is also cited by critics of [[junk science]] to describe cases in which [[scientific evidence]] is thrown aside in favour of a litany of tragic individual cases presented to the public by articulate advocates who pose as experts in their field.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Gian-Carlo Rota]] claimed in a memoir that the expression "proof by intimidation" was coined by [[Mark Kac]] to describe a technique used by [[William Feller]] in his lectures.&lt;ref&gt;''He took umbrage when someone interrupted his lecturing by pointing out some glaring mistake. He became red in the face and raised his voice, often to full shouting range. It was reported that on occasion he had asked the objector to leave the classroom. The expression "proof by intimidation" was coined after Feller's lectures (by Mark Kac). During a Feller lecture, the hearer was made to feel privy to some wondrous secret, one that often vanished by magic as he walked out of the classroom at the end of the period. Like many great teachers, Feller was a bit of a con man.'' {{cite book|title=Indiscrete Thoughts|author=[[Gian-Carlo Rota]]|isbn=0-8176-3866-0|publisher=Birkhäuser |location=Boston |url=http://www.lapasserelle.com/escem/finance1/02_probabilities/william_feller.htm|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rafael Bombelli''' (&lt;!-- see Shakespeare --&gt;[[baptism|baptised]] on 20 January 1526; died 1572{{Ref_label|a|a|none}}) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[mathematician]].

Born in [[Bologna]], he is the author of a treatise on [[algebra]] and is a central figure in the understanding of [[imaginary number]]s.

He was the one who finally managed to address the problem with imaginary numbers. In his 1572 book, ''L'Algebra'', Bombelli solved equations using the method of [[Scipione del Ferro|del Ferro]]/[[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia|Tartaglia]]. He introduced the rhetoric that preceded the representative symbols +''i'' and -''i'' and described how they both worked.

The [[lunar crater]] [[Bombelli (crater)|Bombelli]] is named after him.

==Life==
Rafael Bombelli was baptised on 20 January 1526&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gavagai.de/philosoph/HHP78.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in Bologna, [[Papal States]].  He was born to Antonio Mazzoli, a wool merchant, and Diamante Scudieri, a tailor's daughter. The [[Mazzoli]] family was once quite powerful in Bologna.  When [[Pope Julius II]] came to power, in 1506, he exiled the ruling family, the [[Bentivoglios]]. The Bentivoglio family attempted to retake Bologna in 1508, but failed.  Rafael's grandfather participated in the coup attempt, and was captured and executed.  Later, Antonio was able to return to Bologna, having changed his surname to Bombelli to escape the reputation of the Mazzoli family.  Rafael was the oldest of six children.  Rafael received no college education, but was instead taught by an engineer-architect by the name of [[Pier Francesco Clementi]].

Rafael Bombelli felt that none of the works on algebra by the leading mathematicians of his day provided a careful and thorough exposition of the subject.  Instead of another convoluted treatise that only mathematicians could comprehend, Rafael decided to write a book on algebra that could be understood by anyone.  His text would be self-contained and easily read by those without higher education.

Rafael Bombelli died in 1572 in Rome, Italy.

==Bombelli's ''Algebra''==
[[Image:Bombelli - Algebra, 1572 - 56656.jpg|thumb|''Algebra'', 1572]]

In the book that was published in 1572, entitled ''Algebra'', Bombelli gave a comprehensive account of the algebra known at the time.  He was the first European to write down the way of performing computations with negative numbers.  The following is an excerpt from the text:

	"Plus times plus makes plus &lt;br /&gt;
	Minus times minus makes plus &lt;br /&gt;
	Plus times minus makes minus &lt;br /&gt;
	Minus times plus makes minus &lt;br /&gt;
	Plus 8 times plus 8 makes plus 64 &lt;br /&gt;
	Minus 5 times minus 6 makes plus 30 &lt;br /&gt;
	Minus 4 times plus 5 makes minus 20 &lt;br /&gt;
	Plus 5 times minus 4 makes minus 20"

As was intended, Bombelli used simple language as can be seen above so that anybody could understand it.  But at the same time, he was thorough.

Perhaps more importantly than his work with algebra, however, the book also includes Bombelli's monumental contributions to [[complex number]] theory.  Before he writes about complex numbers, he points out that they occur in solutions of equations of the form &lt;math&gt;x^3 = ax + b,&lt;/math&gt; given that &lt;math&gt;(a/3)^3 &gt; (b/2)^2,&lt;/math&gt; which is another way of stating that the discriminant of the cubic is negative.  The solution of this kind of equation requires taking the cube root of the sum of one number and the square root of some negative number.

Before Bombelli delves into using imaginary numbers practically, he goes into a detailed explanation of the properties of complex numbers.  Right away, he makes it clear that the rules of arithmetic for imaginary numbers are not the same as for real numbers.  This was a big accomplishment, as even numerous subsequent mathematicians were extremely confused on the topic.

Bombelli avoided confusion by giving a special name to square roots of negative numbers, instead of just trying to deal with them as regular radicals like other mathematicians did.  This made it clear that these numbers were neither positive nor negative.  This kind of system avoids the confusion that Euler encountered.  Bombelli called the imaginary number ''i'' “plus of minus” and used “minus of minus” for -''i''.

Bombelli had the foresight to see that imaginary numbers were crucial and necessary to solving quartic and cubic equations.  At the time, people cared about complex numbers only as tools to solve practical equations.  As such, Bombelli was able to get solutions using [[Scipione del Ferro#The Solution of the Cubic Equation|Scipione del Ferro's rule]], even in the irreducible case, where other mathematicians such as [[Cardano]] had given up.

In his book, Bombelli explains complex arithmetic as follows:

	"Plus by plus of minus, makes plus of minus. &lt;br /&gt;
	Minus by plus of minus, makes minus of minus. &lt;br /&gt;
	Plus by minus of minus, makes minus of minus. &lt;br /&gt;
	Minus by minus of minus, makes plus of minus. &lt;br /&gt;
	Plus of minus by plus of minus, makes minus. &lt;br /&gt;
	Plus of minus by minus of minus, makes plus. &lt;br /&gt;
	Minus of minus by plus of minus, makes plus. &lt;br /&gt;
	Minus of minus by minus of minus makes minus."

After dealing with the multiplication of real and imaginary numbers, Bombelli goes on to talk about the rules of addition and subtraction.  He is careful to point out that real parts add to real parts, and imaginary parts add to imaginary parts.

==Reputation==

Bombelli is generally regarded as the inventor of complex numbers, as no one before him had made rules for dealing with such numbers, and no one believed that working with imaginary numbers would have useful results.  Upon reading Bombelli's ''Algebra'', [[Leibniz]] praised Bombelli as an ". . . outstanding master of the analytical art."  Crossley {{cn|date=October 2016}} writes in his book, "Thus we have an engineer, Bombelli, making practical use of complex numbers perhaps because they gave him useful results, while Cardan found the square roots of negative numbers useless.  Bombelli is the first to give a treatment of any complex numbers. . . It is remarkable how thorough he is in his presentation of the laws of calculation of complex numbers. . ."[3]

In honor of his accomplishments, a moon crater was named  [[Bombelli (crater)|Bombelli]].

==Bombelli's method of calculating square roots==
Bombelli used a method related to [[continued fractions]] to calculate [[square roots]].  His method for finding &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{n} &lt;/math&gt; begins with &lt;math&gt; n=(a\pm r)^2=a^2\pm 2ar+r^2\ &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; 0&lt;r&lt;1\ &lt;/math&gt;, from which it can be shown that &lt;math&gt; r=\frac{|n-a^2|}{2a\pm r}&lt;/math&gt;.  Repeated substitution of the expression on the right hand side for &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; into itself yields a continued fraction

: &lt;math&gt;a\pm \frac{|n-a^2|}{2a\pm \frac{|n-a^2|}{2a\pm \frac{|n-a^2|}{2a\pm \cdots }}}&lt;/math&gt;

for the root but Bombelli is more concerned with better approximations for &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.  The value chosen for &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is either of the whole numbers whose squares &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; lies between. The method gives the following [[Convergent (continued fraction)|convergents]] for &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{13}\ &lt;/math&gt; while the actual value is 3.605551275... :

: &lt;math&gt; 3\frac{2}{3},\ 3\frac{3}{5},\ 3\frac{20}{33},\ 3\frac{66}{109},\ 3\frac{109}{180},\ 3\frac{720}{1189},\ \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

The last convergent equals 3.605550883... .  Bombelli's method should be compared with formulas and results used by [[Heron of Alexandria|Heros]] and [[Archimedes]]. The result &lt;math&gt;\frac{265}{153}&lt;\sqrt{3}&lt;\frac{1351}{780}&lt;/math&gt; used by Archimedes in his determination of the value of &lt;math&gt;\pi \ &lt;/math&gt; can be found by using 1 and 0 for the initial values of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6635">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] theory of [[harmonic analysis]], the '''Riesz transforms''' are a family of generalizations of the [[Hilbert transform]] to [[Euclidean space]]s of dimension ''d''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.  They are a type of [[singular integral]] [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]], meaning that they are given by a [[convolution]] of one function with another function having a singularity at the origin.  Specifically, the Riesz transforms of a complex-valued function ƒ on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; are defined by
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;R_jf(x) = c_d\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\int_{\mathbf{R}^d\backslash B_\epsilon(x)}\frac{(t_j-x_j)f(t)}{|x-t|^{d+1}}\,dt&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
for ''j''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,2,...,''d''.  The constant ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; is a dimensional normalization given by

:&lt;math&gt;c_d = \frac{1}{\pi\omega_{d-1}} = \frac{\Gamma[(d+1)/2]}{\pi^{(d+1)/2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

where ω&lt;sub&gt;''d''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Volume of an n-ball|volume of the (''d''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-ball]].  The limit is written in various ways, often as a [[Cauchy principal value|principal value]], or as a [[convolution]] with the [[distribution (mathematics)#Tempered distributions and Fourier transform|tempered distribution]]

:&lt;math&gt;K(x) = \frac{1}{\pi\omega_{d-1}} \, p.v. \frac{x_j}{|x|^{d+1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Riesz transforms arises in the study of differentiability properties of harmonic potentials in [[potential theory]] and [[harmonic analysis]].  In particular, they arise in the proof of the [[Calderón-Zygmund inequality]] {{harv|Gilbarg|Trudinger|1983|loc=§9.4}}.

==Multiplier properties==

The Riesz transforms are given by a [[Fourier multiplier]].  Indeed, the [[Fourier transform]] of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;ƒ is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(R_jf)(x) = -i\frac{x_j}{|x|}(\mathcal{F}f)(x).&lt;/math&gt;

In this form, the Riesz transforms are seen to be generalizations of the [[Hilbert transform]].  The kernel is a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] which is [[homogeneous function|homogeneous]] of degree zero.  A particular consequence of this last observation is that the Riesz transform defines a [[bounded linear operator]] from ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;) to itself.&lt;ref&gt;Strictly speaking, the definition ({{EquationNote|1}}) may only make sense for [[Schwartz function]] ''f''.  Boundedness on a dense subspace of ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; implies that each Riesz transform admits a continuous linear extension to all of ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

This homogeneity property can also be stated more directly without the aid of the Fourier transform. If σ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Homothetic transformation|dilation]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; by the scalar ''s'', that is σ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''sx'', then σ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; defines an action on functions via [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_s^* f = f\circ\sigma_s.&lt;/math&gt;

The Riesz transforms commute with σ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_s^* (R_jf) = R_j(\sigma_x^*f).&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the Riesz transforms commute with translations.  Let τ&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; be the translation on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; along the vector ''a''; that is, τ&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''a''.  Then

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_a^* (R_jf) = R_j(\tau_a^*f).&lt;/math&gt;

For the final property, it is convenient to regard the Riesz transforms as a single [[Vector (geometric)|vectorial]] entity ''R''ƒ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ƒ,…,''R''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;ƒ).  Consider a [[rotation]] ρ in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;.  The rotation acts on spatial variables, and thus on functions via pullback.  But it also can act on the spatial vector ''R''ƒ.  The final transformation property asserts that the Riesz transform is [[equivariant]] with respect to these two actions; that is,

:&lt;math&gt;\rho^* R_j [(\rho^{-1})^*f] = \sum_{k=1}^d \rho_{jk} R_kf.&lt;/math&gt;

These three properties in fact characterize the Riesz transform in the following sense.  Let ''T''=(''T''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''T''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;) be a ''d''-tuple of bounded linear operators from ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;) to ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;) such that

* ''T'' commutes with all dilations and translations.
* ''T'' is equivariant with respect to rotations.

Then, for some constant ''c'', ''T'' = ''cR''.

==Relationship with the Laplacian==
Somewhat imprecisely, the Riesz transforms of ƒ give the first [[partial derivative]]s of a solution of the equation

:&lt;math&gt;{(-\Delta)^{\frac{1}{2}} u = f},&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;Delta; is the Laplacian. Thus the Riesz transform of ƒ can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;{R f = \nabla (-\Delta)^{-\frac{1}{2}}f}&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, one should also have
:&lt;math&gt;R_iR_j\Delta u = -\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x_i\partial x_j},&lt;/math&gt;
so that the Riesz transforms give a way of recovering information about the entire [[Hessian matrix|hessian]] of a function from knowledge of only its Laplacian.

This is now made more precise. Suppose that ''u'' is a [[Schwartz function]].  Then indeed by the explicit form of the Fourier multiplier, one has
:&lt;math&gt;R_iR_j(\Delta u) = -\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x_i\partial x_j}.&lt;/math&gt;
The identity is not generally true in the sense of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]].  For instance, if ''u'' is a tempered distribution such that &amp;Delta;''u''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;), then one can only conclude that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x_i\partial x_j} = -R_iR_j\Delta u + P_{ij}(x)&lt;/math&gt;
for some polynomial ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[File:A5-A7.gif|240px|thumb|A [[snub cube]] can be constructed from a transformed [[rhombicuboctahedron]] by rotating the 6 blue square faces until the 12 white square become pairs of equilateral triangles.]]
In [[geometry]], a '''snub''' is an operation applied to a polyhedron. The term originates from [[Kepler]]'s names of two [[Archimedean solid]]s, for the [[snub cube]] (cubus simus) and [[snub dodecahedron]] (dodecaedron simum).&lt;ref&gt;[[Kepler]], ''Harmonices Mundi'', 1619&lt;/ref&gt; In general, snubs have chiral symmetry with two forms, with clockwise or counterclockwise orientations. By Kepler's names, a snub can be seen as an [[Expansion (geometry)|expansion]] of a regular polyhedron, with the faces moved apart, and twists on their centers, adding new polygons centered on the original vertices, and pairs of triangles fitting between the original edges.

The terminology was generalized by [[Coxeter]], with a slightly different definition, for a wider set of [[uniform polytope]]s.

== Conway snubs ==
[[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] explored generalized polyhedron operators, defining what is now called [[Conway polyhedron notation]], which can be applied to polyhedra and tilings. Conway calls Coxeter's operation a ''semi-snub''.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, (2008) p.287 Coxeter's semi-snub operation&lt;/ref&gt;

In this notation, [[Conway snub operator|snub]] is defined by the dual and [[Conway gyro operator|gyro]] operators, as ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''dg'', and it is equivalent to an [[alternation (geometry)|alternation]] of a truncation of an [[Conway ambo operator|ambo]] operator. Conway's notation itself avoids Coxeter's alternation (half) operation since it only applies for polyhedra with only even-sided faces.

In 4-dimensions, Conway suggests the [[snub 24-cell]] should be called a ''semi-snub 24-cell'' because it doesn't represent an alternated [[omnitruncated 24-cell]] like his 3-dimensional polyhedron usage. It is instead actually an alternated [[truncated 24-cell]].&lt;ref&gt;Conway, 2008, p.401 Gosset's Semi-snub Polyoctahedron&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coxeter]]'s snub terminology is slightly different, meaning an [[alternation (geometry)|alternated]] [[Truncation (geometry)|truncation]], deriving the [[snub cube]] as a ''snub [[cuboctahedron]]'', and the [[snub dodecahedron]] as a ''snub [[icosidodecahedron]]''. This definition is used in the naming two [[Johnson solid]]s: [[snub disphenoid]], and [[snub square antiprism]], as well as higher dimensional polytopes such as the 4-dimensional [[snub 24-cell]], {{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|4|node|3|node}} or s{3,4,3}.

A [[regular polyhedron]] (or tiling) with Schläfli symbol, &lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} p , q \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, and [[Coxeter diagram]] {{CDD|node_1|p|node|q|node}}, has [[Truncation (geometry)|truncation]] defined as &lt;math&gt;t \begin{Bmatrix} p , q \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, and {{CDD|node_1|p|node_1|q|node}} and snub defined as an [[alternation (geometry)|alternated]] truncation &lt;math&gt;ht \begin{Bmatrix} p , q \end{Bmatrix} = s \begin{Bmatrix} p , q \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, and Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node_h|p|node_h|q|node}}. This construction requires ''q'' to be even.

A [[quasiregular polyhedron]] &lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} p \\ q \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; or ''r''{''p'',''q''}, with Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node_1|split1-pq|nodes}} or {{CDD|node|p|node_1|q|node}} has a quasiregular [[Truncation (geometry)|truncation]] defined as &lt;math&gt;t\begin{Bmatrix} p \\ q \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; or ''tr''{''p'',''q''}, and Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node_1|split1-pq|nodes_11}} or {{CDD|node_1|p|node_1|q|node_1}} and quasiregular snub defined as an [[alternation (geometry)|alternated]] truncated rectification &lt;math&gt;ht\begin{Bmatrix} p \\ q \end{Bmatrix} = s\begin{Bmatrix} p \\ q \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; or ''htr''{''p'',''q''} = ''sr''{''p'',''q''}, and Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node_h|split1-pq|nodes_hh}} or {{CDD|node_h|p|node_h|q|node_h}}.

For example, Kepler's '''[[snub cube]]''' is derived from the quasiregular [[cuboctahedron]], with a vertical [[Schläfli symbol]] &lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, and [[Coxeter diagram]] {{CDD|node_1|split1-43|nodes}}, and so is more explicitly called a '''snub cuboctahedron''', expressed by a vertical Schläfli symbol &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node_h|split1-43|nodes_hh}}. The snub cuboctahedron is the alternation of the ''truncated cuboctahedron'', &lt;math&gt;t\begin{Bmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and {{CDD|node_1|split1-43|nodes_11}}.

Regular polyhedra with even-order vertices to also be snubbed as alternated trunction, like a ''snub octahedron'', &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} 3 , 4 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, {{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|4|node}} (and ''snub tetratetrahedron'', as &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} 3 \\ 3 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, {{CDD|node_h|split1|nodes_hh}}) represents the [[pseudoicosahedron]], a regular [[icosahedron]] with [[pyritohedral symmetry]].  The ''snub octahedron'' is the alternation of the [[truncated octahedron]], &lt;math&gt;t\begin{Bmatrix} 3 , 4 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and {{CDD|node_1|3|node_1|4|node}}, or tetrahedral symmetry form: &lt;math&gt;t\begin{Bmatrix} 3 \\ 3 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and {{CDD|node_1|split1|nodes_11}}.

Coxeter's snub operation also allows n-[[antiprism]]s to be defined as &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} 2 \\ n \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} 2 , 2n \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, based on n-prisms &lt;math&gt;t\begin{Bmatrix} 2 \\ n \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;t\begin{Bmatrix} 2 , 2n \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} 2 , n \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is a regular n-[[hosohedron]], a degenerate polyhedron, but a valid tiling on the sphere with [[digon]] or [[lune (geometry)|lune]]-shaped faces.

=== Coxeter's higher-dimensional snubbed polytopes and honeycombs ===
In general, a regular polychora with [[Schläfli symbol]], &lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} p , q, r \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, and [[Coxeter diagram]] {{CDD|node_1|p|node|q|node|r|node}}, has a snub with [[extended Schläfli symbol]] &lt;math&gt;s \begin{Bmatrix} p , q, r \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, and {{CDD|node_h|p|node_h|q|node|r|node}} .

A rectified polychora &lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} p \\ q, r \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; = '''r{p,q,r}''', and {{CDD|node|p|node_1|q|node|r|node}}  has snub symbol &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} p \\ q , r \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; = '''sr{p,q,r}''', and {{CDD|node_h|p|node_h|q|node_h|r|node}}.

=== Examples===
[[File:Ortho solid 969-uniform polychoron 343-snub.png|thumb|Orthogonal projection of [[snub 24-cell]]]]
There is only one uniform snub in 4-dimensions, the [[snub 24-cell]]. The regular [[24-cell]] has [[Schläfli symbol]], &lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} 3 , 4, 3 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, and  [[Coxeter diagram]] {{CDD|node_1|3|node|4|node|3|node}}, and the snub 24-cell is represented by &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} 3 , 4, 3 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, [[Coxeter diagram]] {{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|4|node|3|node}}. It also has an index 6 lower symmetry constructions as &lt;math&gt;s\left\{\begin{array}{l}3\\3\\3\end{array}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; or s{3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;} and {{CDD|node_h|splitsplit1|branch3_hh|node_h}}, and an index 3 subsymmetry as &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} 3 \\ 3 , 4 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; or sr{3,3,4}, and {{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|3|node_h|4|node}} or {{CDD|node_h|split1|nodes_hh|4a|nodea}}.

The related [[snub 24-cell honeycomb]] can be seen as a &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} 3 , 4, 3, 3 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; or s{3,4,3,3}, and {{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|4|node|3|node|3|node}}, and lower symmetry &lt;math&gt;s\begin{Bmatrix} 3 \\ 3 , 4, 3 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; or sr{3,3,4,3} and {{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|3|node_h|4|node|3|node}} or {{CDD|node_h|split1|nodes_hh|3a|nodea|4a|nodea}}, and lowest symmetry form as &lt;math&gt;s\left\{\begin{array}{l}3\\3\\3\\3\end{array}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; or s{3&lt;sup&gt;1,1,1,1&lt;/sup&gt;} and {{CDD|nodes_hh|split2|node_h|split1|nodes_hh}}.

A Euclidean honeycomb is an [[alternated hexagonal slab honeycomb]], s{2,6,3}, and {{CDD|node_h|2x|node_h|6|node|3|node}} or sr{2,3,6}, and {{CDD|node_h|2x|node_h|3|node_h|6|node}} or sr{2,3&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;}, and {{CDD|node_h|2x|node_h|split1|branch_hh}}.
: [[File:Tetroctahedric semicheck.png|160px]]

Another Euclidean (scaliform) honeycomb is an [[alternated square slab honeycomb]], s{2,4,4}, and {{CDD|node_h|2x|node_h|4|node|4|node}} or sr{2,4&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;} and {{CDD|node_h|2x|node_h|split1-44|nodes_hh}}:
: [[File:Alternated cubic slab honeycomb.png|160px]]

The only uniform snub hyperbolic uniform honeycomb is the ''snub hexagonal tiling honeycomb'', as s{3,6,3} and {{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|6|node|3|node}}, which can also be constructed as an [[alternated hexagonal tiling honeycomb]], h{6,3,3}, {{CDD|node_h1|6|node|3|node|3|node}}. It is also constructed as s{3&lt;sup&gt;[3,3]&lt;/sup&gt;} and {{CDD|branch_hh|splitcross|branch_hh}}.

Another hyperbolic (scaliform) honeycomb is an [[snub order-4 octahedral honeycomb]], s{3,4,4}, and {{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|4|node|4|node}}.

[[Image:BeachBall.jpg|thumb|This [[beach ball]] shows a [[hosohedron]] with six lune faces, if the white circles on the ends are removed.]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''spherical polyhedron''' or '''spherical tiling''' is a [[tessellation|tiling]] of the [[sphere]] in which the surface is divided or partitioned by [[great arc]]s into bounded regions called spherical polygons. Much of the theory of symmetrical [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] is most conveniently derived in this way.

The most familiar spherical polyhedron is the [[soccer ball]] (outside the United States, Canada, and Australia, a football), thought of as a spherical [[Truncated_icosahedron#Applications|truncated icosahedron]]. The next most popular spherical polyhedron is the [[beach ball]], thought of as a [[hosohedron]]. 

Some [[#Improper_cases|"improper"]] polyhedra, such as the '''[[hosohedron|hosohedra]]''' and their [[dual polyhedron|duals]] the '''[[dihedron|dihedra]]''', exist as spherical polyhedra but have no flat-faced analogue. In the examples below, {2, 6} is a hosohedron and {6, 2} is the dual dihedron.

==History==
The first known man-made polyhedra are spherical polyhedra [[stone carving|carved in stone]]. Many have been found in [[Scotland]], and appear to date from the [[neolithic]] period (the New Stone Age).

During the 10th Century, the Islamic scholar [[Abū al-Wafā' Būzjānī]] (Abu'l Wafa) wrote the first serious study of spherical polyhedra.

Two hundred years ago, at the start of the 19th Century, [[Louis Poinsot|Poinsot]] used spherical polyhedra to discover the four [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedron|regular star polyhedra]].

In the middle of the 20th Century, [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|Coxeter]] used them to enumerate all but one of the [[uniform polyhedron|uniform polyhedra]], through the construction of kaleidoscopes ([[Wythoff construction]]).

== Examples ==
All the [[regular polyhedron|regular]], [[semiregular polyhedron|semiregular polyhedra]] and their duals can be projected onto the sphere as tilings. Given by their [[Schläfli symbol]] {p, q} or [[vertex figure]] a.b.c. ...:

==Relation to tilings of the projective plane==
Spherical polyhedra having at least one [[Inversive geometry|inversive symmetry]] are related to [[projective polyhedra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = McMullen | first1 = Peter | author1-link = Peter McMullen | first2 = Egon | last2 = Schulte | chapter = 6C.

The best-known examples of projective polyhedra are the regular projective polyhedra, the quotients of the [[centrally symmetric]] [[Platonic solid]]s, as well as two infinite classes of even [[dihedra]] and [[hosohedra]]:&lt;ref name=cox&gt;Coxeter, ''Introduction to geometry'', 1969, Second edition, sec 21.3 ''Regular maps'', p. 386-388&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[group theory]], a '''sporadic group''' is one of the 26 exceptional [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] found in the [[classification of finite simple groups]].

A [[simple group]] is a group ''G'' that does not have any [[normal subgroup]]s except for the trivial group and ''G'' itself. The classification theorem states that the [[list of finite simple groups]] consists of 18 [[countably]] infinite families, plus 26 exceptions that do not follow such a systematic pattern. These are the sporadic groups. They are also known as the sporadic simple groups, or the sporadic finite groups. Because it is not strictly a [[group of Lie type]], the [[Tits group]] is sometimes regarded as a sporadic group,&lt;ref&gt;For example, by [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]].&lt;/ref&gt; in which case the sporadic groups number 27.

The [[monster group]] is the largest of the sporadic groups and contains all but six of the other sporadic groups as [[subgroup]]s or [[subquotient]]s.

==Names of the sporadic groups==

Five of the sporadic groups were discovered by [[Émile Léonard Mathieu|Mathieu]] in the 1860s and the other 21 were found between 1965 and 1975. Several of these groups were predicted to exist before they were constructed. Most of the groups are named after the mathematician(s) who first predicted their existence. The full list is:

* [[Mathieu group]]s [[Mathieu group M11|''M''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Mathieu group M12|''M''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Mathieu group M22|''M''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Mathieu group M23|''M''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Mathieu group M24|''M''&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;]]
* [[Janko group]]s [[Janko group J1|''J''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Janko group J2|''J''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or ''HJ'']], [[Janko group J3|''J''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or ''HJM'']], [[Janko group J4|''J''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]
* [[Conway group]]s ''[[Conway group Co1|Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]]'', ''[[Conway group Co2|Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]'', ''[[Conway group Co3|Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]''

* [[Higman–Sims group]] ''HS''
* [[McLaughlin group (mathematics)|McLaughlin group]] ''McL''
* [[Held group]] ''He'' or ''F''&lt;sub&gt;7+&lt;/sub&gt; or ''F''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;

The [[Tits group]] ''T'' is sometimes also regarded as a sporadic group (it is almost but not strictly a group of Lie type), which is why in some sources the number of sporadic groups is given as 27 instead of 26.&lt;ref name="brauer"/&gt; In some other sources, the Tits group is regarded as neither sporadic nor of Lie type.&lt;ref&gt;In [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TitsGroup.html Eric W. Weisstein „Tits Group“ From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource] the Tits group is given the attribute sporadic, whereas in [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SporadicGroup.html Eric W. Weisstein „Sporadic Group“ From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource], however, the Tits group is NOT listed among the 26. Both sources checked on 2018-05-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Anyway, it is the {{nowrap|(''n''{{=}}0)-member}} {{nowrap|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(2)′}} of the infinite family of commutator groups {{nowrap|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;2''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;)′,}} all of them finite simple groups. For ''n''&gt;0 they coincide with the [[Ree group#Ree groups of type 2F4|groups of Lie type]] {{nowrap|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;2''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;).}} But for {{nowrap|''n''{{=}}0,}} the [[derived subgroup]] {{nowrap|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(2)′}}, called Tits group, has an index&amp;nbsp;2 in the group {{nowrap|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(2)}} of Lie type.

Matrix [[group representation|representations]] over finite fields for all the sporadic groups have been constructed.

The earliest use of the term "sporadic group" may be {{harvtxt|Burnside|1911|loc=p. 504, note N}} where he comments about the Mathieu groups: "These apparently sporadic simple groups would probably repay a closer examination than they have yet received".

The diagram on the right is based on the diagram given in {{Harvtxt|Ronan|2006}}. The sporadic groups also have a lot of subgroups which are not sporadic but these are not shown on the diagram because they are too numerous.

==Organization==

Of the 26 sporadic groups, 20 can be seen inside the [[Monster group]] as [[subgroup]]s or [[quotient group|quotients]] of subgroups ([[Section (group theory)|section]]s).

===I. Pariah===

{{main article|Pariah group}}

The six exceptions are ''J''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''J''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''J''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ''O'N'', ''Ru'' and ''Ly''. These six are sometimes known as the [[pariah group|pariahs]].

===II. Happy Family===

The remaining twenty have been called the ''Happy Family'' by [[Robert Griess]], and can be organized into three generations.

====First generation (5 groups): the Mathieu groups====

{{main article|Mathieu groups}}

M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''n'' = 11, 12, 22, 23 and 24 are multiply transitive [[permutation group]]s on ''n'' points. They are all subgroups of M&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a permutation group on [[24 (number)|24]] points.

====Second generation (7 groups): the Leech lattice====

{{see also|Leech lattice|Conway groups}}

All the [[subquotient]]s of the [[automorphism group]] of a lattice in [[24 (number)|24]] dimensions called the [[Leech lattice]]:
* ''Co''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the quotient of the automorphism group by its center {±1}
* ''Co''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the stabilizer of a type 2 (i.e., length 2) vector
* ''Co''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the stabilizer of a type 3 (i.e., length {{radic|6}}) vector
* ''Suz'' is the group of automorphisms preserving a complex structure (modulo its center)
* ''McL'' is the stabilizer of a type 2-2-3 triangle
* ''HS'' is the stabilizer of a type 2-3-3 triangle
* ''J''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the group of automorphisms preserving a quaternionic structure (modulo its center).

====Third generation (8 groups): other subgroups of the Monster====

Consists of subgroups which are closely related to the Monster group ''M'':
* ''B'' or ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a double cover which is the [[centralizer]] of an element of order 2 in ''M''
* ''Fi''&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime; has a triple cover which is the centralizer of an element of order 3 in ''M'' (in [[conjugacy class]] "3A")
* ''Fi''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt; is a subgroup of ''Fi''&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;
* ''Fi''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;  has a double cover which is a subgroup of ''Fi''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;
* The product of ''Th'' = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and a group of order 3 is the centralizer of an element of order 3 in ''M'' (in conjugacy class "3C")
* The product of ''HN'' = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;  and a group of order 5 is the centralizer of an element of order 5 in ''M''
* The product of ''He'' = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and a group of order 7 is the centralizer of an element of order 7 in ''M''.
* Finally, the Monster group itself is considered to be in this generation.

(This series continues further: the product of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and a group of order 11 is the centralizer of an element of order 11 in ''M''.)

The [[Tits group]] also belongs in this generation: there is a subgroup S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;times;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(2)&amp;prime; normalising a 2C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; subgroup of ''B'', giving rise to a subgroup
2·S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;times;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(2)&amp;prime; normalising a certain Q&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; subgroup of the Monster.
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(2)&amp;prime; is also a subgroup of the Fischer groups ''Fi''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Fi''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Fi''&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;, and of the Baby Monster ''B''.
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(2)&amp;prime; is also a subgroup of the (pariah) Rudvalis group ''Ru'', and has
no involvements in sporadic simple groups except the containments we have already mentioned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8444">'''Subtract-a-square''' (also referred to as '''take-a-square''') is a two-player mathematical game of strategy. It is played by two people with a pile of coins (or other tokens) between them. The players take turns removing coins from the pile, always removing a non-zero [[square number]] of coins. The game is usually played as a ''[[misère game|normal play]]'' game, which means that the player who removes the last coin wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Your Move: Logic, Math and Word Puzzles for Enthusiasts|first=David L.|last=Silverman|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1971|isbn=9780486267319|page=143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8tYNQcRov1cC&amp;pg=PA143|contribution=61.

== Example ==
A normal play game starting with 13 coins is a win for the first player provided (s)he starts with a subtraction of 1:
 player 1: 13 - 1*1 = 12
Player 2 now has three choices: subtract 1, 4 or 9. In each of these cases, player 1 can ensure that within a few moves the number 2 gets passed on to player 2: 
 player 2: 12 - 1*1 = 11        player 2:       12 - 2*2 = 8               player 2: 12 - 3*3 = 3
 player 1: 11 - 3*3 =  2        player 1:        8 - 1*1 = 7               player 1:  3 - 1*1 = 2
                                player 2:  7 - 1*1 = 6 or: 7 - 2*2 = 3   
                                player 1:  6 - 2*2 = 2     3 - 1*1 = 2

Now player 2 has to subtract 1, and player 1 subsequently does the same:
 player 2:  2 - 1*1 = 1
 player 1:  1 - 1*1 = 0
   player 2 loses

== Mathematical theory ==

In the above example, the number '13' represents a winning or 'hot' position, whilst the number '2' represents a losing or 'cold' position. Given an integer list with each integer labeled 'hot' or 'cold', the strategy of the game is simple: try to pass on a 'cold' number to your opponent. This is always possible provided you are being presented a 'hot' number. Which numbers are 'hot' and which numbers are 'cold' can be determined [[Recursion|recursively]]:

 1) the number 0 is 'cold', whilst 1 is 'hot'
 
 2) if all numbers 1 .. N have been classified as either 'hot' or 'cold', then
   2a) the number N+1 is 'cold' if only 'hot' numbers can be reached by subtracting a positive square
   2b) the number N+1 is 'hot' if at least one 'cold' number can be reached by subtracting a positive square

Using this algorithm, a list of cold numbers is easily derived:
:0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 34, 39, 44, … {{OEIS|id=A030193}}
A faster [[divide and conquer algorithm]] can compute the same sequence of numbers, up to any threshold &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, in time &lt;math&gt;O(n\log^2 n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=fesg&gt;{{citation

There are infinitely many cold numbers. More strongly, the number of cold numbers up to some threshold &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; must be at least proportional to the square root of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, for otherwise there would not be enough of them to provide winning moves from all the hot numbers.&lt;ref name="golomb"/&gt;
Cold numbers tend to end in 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 9. Cold values that end with other digits are quite uncommon.&lt;ref name="golomb"/&gt; This holds in particular for cold numbers ending in 6. Out of all the over 180,000 cold numbers less than 40 million, only one ends in a 6: 11,356.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/cgt/subsquare.html|first=David|last=Bush|title=the uniqueness of 11,356|work=sci.math|date=October 12, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

No two cold numbers can differ by a square, because if they did then a move from the larger of the two to the smaller would be winning, contradicting the assumption that they are both cold. Therefore, by the [[Furstenberg–Sárközy theorem]], the [[natural density]] of the cold numbers is zero. That is, for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, and for all sufficiently large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the fraction of the numbers up to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; that are cold is less than &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

== Extensions ==

The game subtract-a-square can also be played with multiple numbers. At each turn the player to make a move first selects one of the numbers, and then subtracts a square from it. Such a 'sum of normal games' can be analysed using the [[Sprague–Grundy theorem]]. This theorem states that each position in the game subtract-a-square may be mapped onto an equivalent [[Nim|nim heap size]]. Optimal play consists of moving to a collection of numbers such that the [[nim-sum]] of their equivalent nim heap sizes is zero, when this is possible. The equivalent nim heap size of a position may be calculated as the [[Mex_(mathematics)|minimum excluded value]] of the equivalent sizes of the positions that can be reached by a single move.
For subtract-a-square positions of values 0, 1, 2, ... the equivalent nim heap sizes are
:0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, … {{OEIS|id=A014586}}.
In particular, a position of subtract-a-square is cold if and only if its equivalent nim heap size is zero.

It is also possible to play variants of this game using other allowed moves than the square numbers. For instance, Golomb defined an analogous game based on the [[Moser–de Bruijn sequence]], a sequence that grows at a similar [[asymptotics|asymptotic rate]] to the squares, for which it is possible to determine more easily the set of cold positions and to define an easily computed optimal move strategy.&lt;ref name="golomb"/&gt;

== Misère game ==

Subtract-a-square can also be played as a ''[[misère]]'' game, in which the player to make the last subtraction loses. The recursive algorithm to determine 'hot' and 'cold' numbers for the misère game is the same as that for the normal game, except that for the misère game the number 1 is 'cold' whilst 2 is 'hot'. It follows that the cold numbers for the misère variant are the cold numbers for the normal game shifted by 1:

 Misère play 'cold' numbers:
 1, 3, 6, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18, 21, 23, 35, 40, 45, ...

'''Sir William Rowan Hamilton''' [[Member of the Royal Irish Academy|MRIA]] (4 August 1805 – 2 September 1865) was an Irish mathematician. While still an undergraduate he was appointed Andrews professor of Astronomy and Royal Astronomer of Ireland, and lived at [[Dunsink Observatory]]. He made important contributions to [[optics]], [[classical mechanics]] and [[algebra]]. Although Hamilton was not a physicist–he regarded himself as a pure mathematician–his work was of major importance to physics, particularly his reformulation of [[Newtonian mechanics]], now called [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]. This work has proven central to the modern study of classical field theories such as [[electromagnetism]], and to the development of [[quantum mechanics]]. In pure mathematics, he is best known as the inventor of [[quaternion]]s.

Hamilton is said to have shown immense talent at a very early age. Astronomer Bishop Dr. [[John Brinkley (astronomer)|John Brinkley]] remarked of the 18-year-old Hamilton, 'This young man, I do not say ''will be'', but ''is'', the first mathematician of his age.'

== Life ==

William Rowan Hamilton's scientific career included the study of [[geometrical optics]], [[classical mechanics]], adaptation of dynamic methods in optical systems, applying quaternion and vector methods to problems in mechanics and in geometry, development of theories of conjugate algebraic couple functions (in which complex numbers are constructed as ordered pairs of real numbers), solvability of polynomial equations and general quintic polynomial solvable by radicals, the analysis on Fluctuating Functions (and the ideas from [[Fourier analysis]]), linear operators on quaternions and proving a result for linear operators on the space of quaternions (which is a special case of the general theorem which today is known as the ''[[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]]''). Hamilton also invented "''[[icosian calculus]]''", which he used to investigate closed edge paths on a dodecahedron that visit each vertex exactly once.

===Early life===

Hamilton was the fourth of nine children born to Sarah Hutton (1780–1817) and Archibald Hamilton (1778–1819),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=207|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt; who lived in Dublin at 29 Dominick Street, later renumbered to 36.&lt;ref&gt;Graves 1882, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton's father, who was from Dublin, worked as a solicitor. By the age of three, Hamilton had been sent to live with his uncle James Hamilton,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a graduate of [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] who ran a school in Talbots Castle in [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]], Co. Meath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=12148|title=Hamilton, William Rowan (1805–1865)|year=2004|last=Lewis|first=Albert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His uncle soon discovered that Hamilton had a remarkable ability to learn languages, and from a young age, had displayed an uncanny ability to acquire them (although this is disputed by some historians, who claim he had only a very basic understanding of them).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=207–8|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of seven, he had already made very considerable progress in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and before he was thirteen he had acquired, under the care of his uncle (a linguist), almost as many languages as he had years of age. These included the classical and modern European languages, and [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], [[Sanskrit]], and even [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Malay language|Malay]]. He retained much of his knowledge of languages to the end of his life, often reading Persian and Arabic in his spare time, although he had long since stopped studying languages, and used them just for relaxation.

In September 1813, the American calculating prodigy [[Zerah Colburn (math prodigy)|Zerah Colburn]] was being exhibited in Dublin. Colburn was 9, a year older than Hamilton. The two were pitted against each other in a mental arithmetic contest with Colburn emerging the clear victor.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=208|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to his defeat, Hamilton dedicated less time to studying languages and more time to studying mathematics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fountain and van koningsveld"&gt;{{Cite book

Hamilton was part of a small but well-regarded school of mathematicians associated with [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]] in Dublin, which he entered at age 18.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The college awarded him two Optimes, or off-the-chart grades.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He studied both classics and mathematics, and was appointed Professor of Astronomy just prior to his graduation (BA, 1827, he was awarded MA in 1837).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=209|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then took up residence at Dunsink Observatory where he spent the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=mactutor/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Personal life ===
While attending Trinity College, Hamilton proposed to his friend's sister, who rejected him.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hamilton, being a sensitive young man, became sick and depressed, and almost committed suicide.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He was rejected again in 1831 by Aubrey De Vere (1814-1902).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Luckily, Hamilton found a woman who would accept his proposal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She was Helen Marie Bayly, a country preacher's daughter, and they married in 1833.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hamilton had three children with Bayly: [[William Edwin Hamilton]] (born 1834), Archibald Henry (born 1835), and Helen Elizabeth (born 1840).&lt;ref&gt;Sean O’Donnell (1983) ''William Rowan Hamilton: Portrait of a Prodigy'', Dublin: Boole Press {{ISBN|0-906783-06-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton's married life turned out to be difficult and unhappy as Bayly proved to be pious, shy, timid, and chronically ill.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Optics and mechanics===

{{Classical mechanics|Topic=Scientists}}

Hamilton made important contributions to [[optics]] and to [[classical mechanics]]. His first discovery was in an early paper that he communicated in 1823 to Dr. Brinkley, who presented it under the title of "''Caustics''" in 1824 to the [[Royal Irish Academy]]. It was referred as usual to a committee. While their report acknowledged its novelty and value, they recommended further development and simplification before publication. Between 1825 and 1828 the paper grew to an immense size, mostly by the additional details that the committee had suggested. But it also became more intelligible, and the features of the new method were now easily seen. Until this period Hamilton himself seems not to have fully understood either the nature or importance of optics, as later he intended to apply his method to dynamics.

In 1827, Hamilton presented a theory of a single function, now known as [[Hamilton's principal function]], that brings together mechanics, optics, and mathematics, and which helped to establish the wave theory of light. He proposed it when he first predicted its existence in the third supplement to his "''Systems of Rays''", read in 1832. The Royal Irish Academy paper was finally entitled "''Theory of Systems of Rays''" (23 April 1827), and the first part was printed in 1828 in the ''Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy''. The more important contents of the second and third parts appeared in the three voluminous supplements (to the first part) which were published in the same Transactions, and in the two papers "''On a General Method in Dynamics''", which appeared in the Philosophical Transactions in 1834 and 1835. In these papers, Hamilton developed his great principle of "''Varying Action''". The most remarkable result of this work is the prediction that a single ray of light entering a biaxial crystal at a certain angle would emerge as a hollow cone of rays. This discovery is still known by its original name, "''conical refraction''".

The step from optics to dynamics in the application of the method of "''Varying Action''" was made in 1827, and communicated to the Royal Society, in whose ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'' for 1834 and 1835 there are two papers on the subject, which, like the "''Systems of Rays''", display a mastery over symbols and a flow of mathematical language almost unequaled. The common thread running through all this work is Hamilton's principle of "''Varying Action''". Although it is based on the [[calculus of variations]] and may be said to belong to the general class of problems included under the [[principle of least action]] which had been studied earlier by [[Maupertuis|Pierre Louis Maupertuis]], [[Euler]], [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], and others, Hamilton's analysis revealed much deeper mathematical structure than had been previously understood, in particular the symmetry between momentum and position. Paradoxically, the credit for discovering the quantity now called the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] and [[Lagrange's equations]] belongs to Hamilton. Hamilton's advances enlarged greatly the class of mechanical problems that could be solved, and they represent perhaps the greatest addition which [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]] had received since the work of [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Lagrange]]. Many scientists, including [[Joseph Liouville|Liouville]], [[C. G. J. Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Jean Gaston Darboux|Darboux]], [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]], [[Kolmogorov]], and [[V. I. Arnold|Arnold]], have extended Hamilton's work, thereby expanding our knowledge of [[mechanics]] and [[differential equations]].

While Hamilton's reformulation of classical mechanics is based on the same physical principles as the mechanics of Newton and Lagrange, it provides a powerful new technique for working with the equations of motion. More importantly, both the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] approaches, which were initially developed to describe the motion of [[discrete system]]s, have proven critical to the study of continuous classical systems in physics, and even quantum mechanical systems. In this way, the techniques find use in [[electromagnetism]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[Quantum field theory|quantum]] [[relativity theory]], and [[quantum field theory]].

===Mathematical studies===

{{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}

Hamilton's [[mathematics|mathematical]] studies seem to have been undertaken and carried to their full development without any assistance whatsoever, and the result is that his writings do not belong to any particular "''school''". Not only was Hamilton an expert as an [[arithmetic]] calculator, but he seems to have occasionally had fun in working out the result of some calculation to an enormous number of decimal places. At the age of eight Hamilton engaged [[Zerah Colburn (math prodigy)|Zerah Colburn]], the American "''[[mental calculator|calculating boy]]''", who was then being exhibited as a curiosity in Dublin. Two years later, aged ten, Hamilton stumbled across a [[Latin]] copy of [[Euclid]], which he eagerly devoured; and at twelve he studied [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Arithmetica Universalis]]''. This was his introduction to modern [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Hamilton soon began to read the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', and at sixteen Hamilton had mastered a great part of it, as well as some more modern works on [[analytical geometry]] and the [[differential calculus]].

Around this time Hamilton was also preparing to enter [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], Dublin, and therefore had to devote some time to classics. In mid-1822 he began a systematic study of [[Laplace]]'s ''[[Celestial mechanics|Mécanique Céleste]]''.

From that time Hamilton appears to have devoted himself almost wholly to mathematics, though he always kept himself well acquainted with the [[History of science and technology|progress of science]] both in Britain and abroad. Hamilton found an important defect in one of Laplace's demonstrations, and he was induced by a friend to write out his remarks, so that they could be shown to Dr. [[John Brinkley (astronomer)|John Brinkley]], then the first [[Royal Astronomer of Ireland]], and an accomplished mathematician. Brinkley seems to have immediately perceived Hamilton's talents, and to have encouraged him in the kindest way.

Hamilton's career at College was perhaps unexampled. Amongst a number of extraordinary competitors, he was first in every subject and at every examination. He achieved the rare distinction of obtaining an [[optime]] both for [[Greek language|Greek]] and for [[physics]]. Hamilton might have attained many more such honours (he was expected to win both the [[gold medal]]s at the degree examination), if his career as a student had not been cut short by an unprecedented event. This was Hamilton's appointment to the [[Andrews Professorship of Astronomy]] in the [[University of Dublin]], vacated by Dr. Brinkley in 1827. The chair was not exactly offered to him, as has been sometimes asserted, but the electors, having met and talked over the subject, authorised Hamilton's personal friend (also an elector) to urge Hamilton to become a candidate, a step which Hamilton's modesty had prevented him from taking. Thus, when barely 22, Hamilton was established at the [[Dunsink Observatory]], near Dublin.

Hamilton was not especially suited for the post, because although he had a profound acquaintance with [[theoretical astronomy]], he had paid little attention to the regular work of the practical [[astronomer]]. Hamilton's time was better employed in original investigations than it would have been spent in observations made even with the best of instruments. Hamilton was intended by the university authorities who elected him to the professorship of astronomy to spend his time as he best could for the advancement of science, without being tied down to any particular branch. If Hamilton had devoted himself to practical astronomy, the University of Dublin would assuredly have furnished him with instruments and an adequate staff of assistants.

He was twice awarded the [[Cunningham Medal]] of the [[Royal Irish Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ria.ie/news-%281%29/cunningham-medal-awarded-to-professor-john-v--mcca.aspx?lang=ga-IE|title= Cunningham Medal Awarded to Professor John V.

In 1835, being secretary to the meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science|British Association]] which was held that year in Dublin, he was [[knight]]ed by the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|lord-lieutenant]]. Other honours rapidly succeeded, among which his election in 1837 to the president's chair in the [[Royal Irish Academy]], and the rare distinction of being made a corresponding member of the [[Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences]]. Later, in 1864, the newly established [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] elected its first Foreign Associates, and decided to put Hamilton's name on top of their list.&lt;ref&gt;Graves (1889) Vol. III, pp. 204–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quaternions===

[[File:William Rowan Hamilton Plaque - geograph.org.uk - 347941.jpg|thumb|right|Quaternion Plaque on [[Broom Bridge]]]]

{{main|History of quaternions}}

The other great contribution Hamilton made to mathematical science was his discovery of [[quaternion]]s in 1843.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=210|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1840, [[Benjamin Olinde Rodrigues]] had already reached a result that amounted to their discovery in all but name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Simon L. Altmann | title = Hamilton, Rodrigues and the quaternion scandal | journal = Mathematics Magazine | date = 1989 | volume = 62 | pages = 291–308 | doi = 10.2307/2689481 | jstor = 2689481 | issue = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton was looking for ways of extending [[complex number]]s (which can be viewed as [[Point (geometry)|points]] on a 2-dimensional [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]) to higher spatial dimensions. 
He failed to find a useful 3-dimensional system (in modern terminology, he failed to find a real, three-dimensional [[skew-field]]), but in working with four dimensions he created quaternions. According to Hamilton, on 16 October he was out walking along the [[Royal Canal]] in Dublin with his wife when the solution in the form of the equation

'''{{math|1=''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''j''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''ijk'' = −1}}'''

suddenly occurred to him; Hamilton then promptly carved this equation using his penknife into the side of the nearby [[Broom Bridge]] (which Hamilton called Brougham Bridge).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This event marks the discovery of the [[quaternion group]].

A plaque under the bridge was unveiled by the [[Taoiseach]] [[Éamon de Valera]], himself a mathematician and student of quaternions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/De_Valera.html De Valera] School of Mathematics and Statistics
University of St Andrews, Scotland&lt;/ref&gt; on 13 November 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/H/Hamilton.html Hamilton, William Rowan (1805–1865)]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1989, the [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth]] has organised a pilgrimage called the ''[[Hamilton Walk]]'', in which mathematicians take a walk from Dunsink Observatory to the bridge, where no trace of the carving remains, though a stone plaque does commemorate the discovery.&lt;ref name="hw20"&gt;[http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/ims/bull65/M6501.pdf Twenty Years of the Hamilton Walk] by Fiacre Ó Cairbre, Department of Mathematics,
National University of Ireland, Maynooth (2005), Irish Math. Soc. Bulletin 65 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The quaternion involved abandoning [[commutativity]], a radical step for the time. Not only this, but Hamilton had in a sense invented the cross and dot products of vector algebra. Hamilton also described a quaternion as an ordered four-element multiple of real numbers, and described the first element as the 'scalar' part, and the remaining three as the 'vector' part.

Hamilton introduced, as a method of analysis, both quaternions and [[biquaternion]]s, the extension to eight dimensions by introduction of complex number [[coefficient]]s. When his work was assembled in 1853, the book ''Lectures on Quaternions'' had "formed the subject of successive courses of lectures, delivered in 1848 and subsequent years, in the Halls of Trinity College, Dublin". Hamilton confidently declared that quaternions would be found to have a powerful influence as an instrument of research. 
When he died, Hamilton was working on a definitive statement of quaternion science. His son [[William Edwin Hamilton]] brought the ''Elements of Quaternions'', a hefty volume of 762 pages, to publication in 1866. As copies ran short, a second edition was prepared by [[Charles Jasper Joly]], when the book was split into two volumes, the first appearing 1899 and the second in 1901. The subject index and footnotes in this second edition improved the ''Elements'' accessibility.

One of the features of Hamilton's quaternion system was the differential operator [[del]] which could be used to express the [[gradient]] of a [[vector field]] or to express the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]]. These operations were applied by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Clerk Maxwell]] to the electrical and magnetic studies of [[Michael Faraday]] in Maxwell's [[Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]] (1873). Though the del operator continues to be used, the real quaternions fall short as a representation of [[spacetime]]. On the other hand, the [[biquaternion]] algebra, in the hands of [[Arthur W. Conway]] and [[Ludwik Silberstein]], provided representational tools for [[Minkowski space]] and the [[Lorentz group]] early in the twentieth century.

Today, the quaternions are used in [[computer graphics]], [[control theory]], [[signal processing]], and orbital mechanics, mainly for representing rotations/orientations. For example, it is common for spacecraft attitude-control systems to be commanded in terms of quaternions, which are also used to telemeter their current attitude. The rationale is that combining quaternion transformations is more numerically stable than combining many matrix transformations.  In control and modelling applications, quaternions do not have a computational singularity (undefined division by zero) that can occur for quarter-turn rotations (90 degrees) that are achievable by many Air, Sea and Space vehicles. In pure mathematics, quaternions show up significantly as one of the four finite-dimensional [[normed division algebra]]s over the real numbers, with applications throughout algebra and geometry.

It is believed by some modern mathematicians that Hamilton's work on quaternions was satirized by [[Charles Lutwidge Dodgson]] in [[Alice in Wonderland]]. In particular, the Mad Hatter's tea party was meant to represent the folly of quaternions and the need to revert to [[Euclidean geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124632317 'The Mad Hatter's Secret Ingredient: Math' in ''National Public Radio'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other originality===

{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}

Hamilton originally matured his ideas before putting pen to paper. The discoveries, papers, and treatises previously mentioned might well have formed the whole work of a long and laborious life. But not to speak of his enormous collection of books, full to overflowing with new and original matter, which have been handed over to [[Trinity College, Dublin]], the previous mentioned works barely form the greater portion of what Hamilton has published. Hamilton developed the [[variational principle]], which was reformulated later by [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]]. He also introduced the [[icosian game]] or ''Hamilton's puzzle'' which can be solved using the concept of a [[Hamiltonian path]].

Hamilton's extraordinary investigations connected with the solution of algebraic equations of the [[quintic function|fifth degree]], and his examination of the results arrived at by [[Niels Henrik Abel|N. H. Abel]], [[George Birch Jerrard|G. B. Jerrard]], and others in their researches on this subject, form another contribution to science. There is next Hamilton's paper on fluctuating functions, a subject which, since the time of [[Joseph Fourier]], has been of immense and ever increasing value in physical [[applications of mathematics]]. There is also the extremely ingenious invention of the [[hodograph]]. Of his extensive investigations into the solutions (especially by [[numerical approximation]]) of certain classes of physical differential equations, only a few items have been published, at intervals, in the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]''.

Besides all this, Hamilton was a voluminous correspondent. Often a single letter of Hamilton's occupied from fifty to a hundred or more closely written pages, all devoted to the minute consideration of every feature of some particular problem; for it was one of the peculiar characteristics of Hamilton's mind never to be satisfied with a general understanding of a question; Hamilton pursued the problem until he knew it in all its details. Hamilton was ever courteous and kind in answering applications for assistance in the study of his works, even when his compliance must have cost him much time. He was excessively precise and hard to please with reference to the final polish of his own works for publication; and it was probably for this reason that he published so little compared with the extent of his investigations.

===Death and afterwards===

[[File:2003 Ireland 10 Euro Sir William Hamilton Reverse.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Ireland)|Irish commemorative coin]] celebrating the 200th Anniversary of his birth.]]

Hamilton retained his faculties unimpaired to the very last, and steadily continued the task of finishing the ''Elements of Quaternions'' which had occupied the last six years of his life. He died on 2 September 1865, following a severe attack of [[gout]] precipitated by excessive drinking and overeating.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=William |last=Reville |title=Ireland's Greatest Mathematician |url=http://undersci.ucc.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2014/11/William_Rowan_Hamilton.pdf |publisher=[[The Irish Times]] |date=26 February 2004 |accessdate=4 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in [[Mount Jerome Cemetery]] in Dublin. He had married Helen Bayly and had several children.

Hamilton is recognised as one of Ireland's leading scientists and, as Ireland becomes more aware of its scientific heritage, he is increasingly celebrated. The [[Hamilton Institute]] is an applied mathematics research institute at [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth|NUI Maynooth]] and the [[Royal Irish Academy]] holds an annual public Hamilton lecture at which [[Murray Gell-Mann]], [[Frank Wilczek]], [[Andrew Wiles]], and [[Timothy Gowers]] have all spoken. The year 2005 was the 200th anniversary of Hamilton's birth and the Irish government designated that the ''Hamilton Year, celebrating Irish science''. [[Trinity College Dublin]] marked the year by launching the [[Hamilton Mathematics Institute]].&lt;ref name=HMI&gt;{{cite web|title=About HMI|url=http://hamilton.tcd.ie/?subsite=main&amp;section=about|website=hamilton.tcd.ie|publisher=Trinity College, Dublin|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[commemorative stamps]] were issued by Ireland in 1943 to mark the centenary of the announcement of quaternions.&lt;ref name=Colnect.com&gt;{{cite web|title=William Rowan Hamilton|url=https://colnect.com/en/stamps/list/country/2616-Ireland/series/10231-William_Rowan_Hamilton/theme/23-Sculptures/year/1943|website=colnect.com|publisher=Colnect.com|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 10 [[Euro]]s commemorative silver [[Proof coin]] was issued by the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] in 2005 to commemorate 200 years since his birth.

The newest maintenance depot for the Dublin [[Luas|LUAS]] tram system has been named after him. It is located adjacent to the [[Broom Bridge|Broombridge]] stop on the [[Green Line (Luas)|Green Line]].

[[Image:Winding Number Around Point.svg|thumb|right|250px|This curve has winding number two around the point ''p''.]]
In [[mathematics]], the '''winding number''' of a closed [[curve]] in the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] around a given [[point (mathematics)|point]] is an [[integer]] representing the total number of times that curve travels counterclockwise around the point.  The winding number depends on the [[curve orientation|orientation]] of the curve, and is [[negative number|negative]] if the curve travels around the point clockwise.

Winding numbers are fundamental objects of study in [[algebraic topology]], and they play an important role in [[vector calculus]], [[complex analysis]], [[geometric topology]], [[differential geometry]], and [[physics]], including [[string theory]].

==Intuitive description==
[[Image:Winding Number Animation Small.gif|right|thumb|300px|An object traveling along the red curve makes two counterclockwise turns around the person at the origin.]]

Suppose we are given a closed, oriented curve in the ''xy'' plane.  We can imagine the curve as the path of motion of some object, with the orientation indicating the direction in which the object moves.  Then the '''winding number''' of the curve is equal to the total number of counterclockwise [[Turn (geometry)|turns]] that the object makes around the origin.

When counting the total number of [[Turn (geometry)|turns]], counterclockwise motion counts as positive, while clockwise motion counts as negative.  For example, if the object first circles the origin four times counterclockwise, and then circles the origin once clockwise, then the total winding number of the curve is three.

Using this scheme, a curve that does not travel around the origin at all has winding number zero, while a curve that travels clockwise around the origin has negative winding number.  Therefore, the winding number of a curve may be any [[integer]].  The following pictures show curves with winding numbers between &amp;minus;2 and 3:

==Formal definition==
A curve in the ''xy'' plane can be defined by [[parametric equation]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;x = x(t)\quad\text{and}\quad y=y(t)\qquad\text{for }0 \leq t \leq 1.&lt;/math&gt;

If we think of the parameter ''t'' as time, then these equations specify the motion of an object in the plane between {{nowrap|1= ''t'' = 0}} and {{nowrap|1= ''t'' = 1}}.  The path of this motion is a curve as long as the [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] ''x''(''t'') and ''y''(''t'') are [[continuous function|continuous]].  This curve is closed as long as the position of the object is the same at {{nowrap|1= ''t'' = 0}} and {{nowrap|1= ''t'' = 1}}.

We can define the '''winding number''' of such a curve using the [[polar coordinate system]].  Assuming the curve does not pass through the origin, we can rewrite the parametric equations in polar form:

:&lt;math&gt;r = r(t)\quad\text{and}\quad \theta = \theta(t)\qquad\text{for }0 \leq t \leq 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The functions ''r''(''t'') and ''&amp;theta;''(''t'') are required to be continuous, with {{nowrap| ''r'' &amp;gt; 0}}.  Because the initial and final positions are the same, ''&amp;theta;''(0) and ''&amp;theta;''(1) must differ by an integer multiple of 2''&amp;pi;''.  This integer is the winding number:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{winding number} = \frac{\theta(1) - \theta(0)}{2\pi}.&lt;/math&gt;

This defines the winding number of a curve around the origin in the ''xy'' plane.  By translating the coordinate system, we can extend this definition to include winding numbers around any point ''p''.

==Alternative definitions==
Winding number is often defined in different ways in various parts of mathematics.  All of the definitions below are equivalent to the one given above:

===Alexander numbering===

A simple [[combinatorial]] rule for defining the winding number was proposed by [[August Ferdinand Möbius]] in 1865&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| last=Möbius
| first=August
| authorlink=August Ferdinand Möbius
| title=Über die Bestimmung des Inhaltes eines Polyëders
| journal=Berichte über die Verhandlungen der Königlich Sächsischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften, Mathematisch-Physische Klasse
| date=1865
| volume=17
| pages=31–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and again independently by [[James Waddell Alexander II]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| last=Alexander
| first=J. W.
| authorlink=James Waddell Alexander II
| title=Topological Invariants of Knots and Links
| journal=Transactions of the American Mathematical Society
| date=April 1928
| volume=30
| issue=2
| pages=275–306
| doi=10.2307/1989123}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Any curve partitions the plane into several connected regions, one of which is unbounded.  The winding numbers of the curve around two points in the same region are equal.  The winding number around (any point in) the unbounded region is zero.  Finally, the winding numbers for any two adjacent regions differ by exactly 1; the region with the larger winding number appears on the left side of the curve (with respect to motion down the curve).

===Differential geometry===
In [[differential geometry]], parametric equations are usually assumed to be [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] (or at least piecewise differentiable).  In this case, the polar coordinate ''&amp;theta;'' is related to the rectangular coordinates ''x'' and ''y'' by the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;d\theta = \frac{1}{r^2} \left( x\,dy - y\,dx \right)\quad\text{where }r^2 = x^2 + y^2.&lt;/math&gt;
Which is found by differentiating the following definition for θ:
:&lt;math&gt; \theta(t)=\arctan\bigg(\frac{y(t)}{x(t)}\bigg)&lt;/math&gt; 
By the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], the total change in ''&amp;theta;'' is equal to the [[integral]] of ''d&amp;theta;''.  We can therefore express the winding number of a differentiable curve as a [[line integral]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{winding number} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \oint_C \,\left(\frac{x}{r^2}\,dy - \frac{y}{r^2}
\,dx\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The [[one-form]] ''d&amp;theta;'' (defined on the complement of the origin) is [[closed and exact differential forms|closed]] but not exact, and it generates the first [[de Rham cohomology]] group of the [[punctured plane]].  In particular, if ''&amp;omega;'' is any closed differentiable one-form defined on the complement of the origin, then the integral of ''&amp;omega;'' along closed loops gives a multiple of the winding number.

===Complex analysis===
Winding numbers play a very important role throughout complex analysis (c.f. the statement of the [[residue theorem]]).  In the context of [[complex analysis]], the winding number of a [[closed curve]] &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in the [[complex plane]] can be expressed in terms of the complex coordinate {{nowrap|1= ''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy''}}.  Specifically, if we write ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''re''&lt;sup&gt;''i&amp;theta;''&lt;/sup&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;dz = e^{i\theta} dr + ire^{i\theta} d\theta\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dz}{z} \;=\; \frac{dr}{r} + i\,d\theta \;=\; d[ \ln r ] + i\,d\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

The total change in ln(''r'') is zero, and thus the integral of &lt;math&gt;\frac{dz}{z}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by the total change in &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, the winding number of closed path &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; about the origin is given by the expression&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ContourWindingNumber.html Weisstein, Eric W.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{dz}{z}&lt;/math&gt;.

More generally, if &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a closed curve parameterized by &lt;math&gt;t\in[\alpha,\beta]&lt;/math&gt;, the winding number of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; about &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, also known as the ''index'' of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, is defined for complex &lt;math&gt;z\notin \gamma([\alpha, \beta])&lt;/math&gt; as&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1979RudinW|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=0-07-054235-X|location=New York|pages=201|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ind}_\gamma(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{d\zeta}{\zeta - z}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\alpha}^{\beta}\frac{\gamma'(t)}{\gamma(t)-z}dt&lt;/math&gt;.

This is a special case of the famous [[Cauchy integral formula]].  

Some of the basic properties of the winding number in the complex plane are given by the following theorem:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/RudinW.RealAndComplexAnalysis3e1987|title=Real and Complex Analysis|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1987|isbn=0-07-054234-1|edition=3rd|location=New York|pages=203|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

'''Theorem.''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\gamma:[\alpha,\beta]\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a closed path and let &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be the set complement of the image of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, that is,  &lt;math&gt;\Omega:=\mathbb{C}\setminus\gamma([\alpha,\beta])&lt;/math&gt;.  Then the index of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;,''&lt;blockquote&gt;''&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ind}_\gamma:\Omega\to \mathbb{C},\ \ z\mapsto \frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_\gamma \frac{d\zeta}{\zeta-z}&lt;/math&gt;,''&lt;/blockquote&gt;''is (i) integer-valued, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ind}_\gamma(z)\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z\in\Omega&lt;/math&gt;; (ii) constant over each component (i.e., maximal connected subset) of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;; and (iii) zero if &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is in the unbounded component of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.''

As an immediate corollary, this theorem gives the winding number of a circular path &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; about a point &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.  As expected, the winding number counts the number of (counterclockwise) loops &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; makes around &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;:

'''Corollary.'''  ''If &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the path defined by &lt;math&gt;\gamma(t)=a+re^{int},\ \ 0\leq t\leq 2\pi, \ \ n\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, then'' &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ind}_\gamma(z) = \begin{cases} n, &amp; |z-a|&lt; r; \\ 0, &amp; |z-a|&gt; r. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
===Topology===
In [[topology]], the winding number is an alternate term for the [[degree of a continuous mapping]].  In [[physics]], winding numbers are frequently called [[topological quantum number]]s.  In both cases, the same concept applies.

The above example of a curve winding around a point has a simple topological interpretation. The complement of a point in the plane is [[homotopy equivalent]] to the [[circle]], such that maps from the circle to itself are really all that need to be considered. It can be shown that each such map can be continuously deformed to (is homotopic to) one of the standard maps &lt;math&gt;S^1 \to S^1 : s \mapsto s^n&lt;/math&gt;, where multiplication in the circle is defined by identifying it with the complex unit circle. The set of [[homotopy class]]es of maps from a circle to a [[topological space]] form a [[Group (mathematics)|group]], which is called the first [[homotopy group]] or [[fundamental group]] of that space. The fundamental group of the circle is the group of the [[integers]], '''Z'''; and the winding number of a complex curve is just its homotopy class.

Maps from the 3-sphere to itself are also classified by an integer which is also called the winding number or sometimes [[Pontryagin index]].

===Polygons===
[[File:Star polygon 9 4.png|thumb|The boundary of the regular [[Enneagram (geometry)|Enneagram]] {9/4} winds around its centre 4 times, so it has a [[polygon density|density]] of 4.]]
In [[polygon]]s, the winding number is referred to as the [[polygon density]]. For convex polygons, and more generally [[simple polygon]]s (not self-intersecting), the density is 1, by the [[Jordan curve theorem]]. By contrast, for a regular [[star polygon]] {''p''/''q''}, the density is ''q''.

==Turning number==
One can also consider the winding number of the path with respect to the tangent of the path itself. As a path followed through time, this would be the winding number with respect to the origin of the velocity vector. In this case the example illustrated at the beginning of this article has a winding number of 3, because the small loop ''is'' counted.

This is only defined for immersed paths (i.e., for differentiable paths with nowhere vanishing derivatives), and is the degree of the tangential [[Gauss map]].

This is called the '''turning number''', and can be computed as the [[total curvature]] divided by 2''π''.

==Winding number and Heisenberg ferromagnet equations==
The winding number is closely related with the (2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional continuous Heisenberg ferromagnet equations and its integrable extensions: the [[Ishimori equation]] etc. Solutions of the last equations are classified by the winding number or [[topological charge]] ([[topological invariant]] and/or [[topological quantum number]]).
