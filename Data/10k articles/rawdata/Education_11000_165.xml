'''Abraham Flexner''' (November 13, 1866 – September 21, 1959) was an American educator, best known for his role in the 20th century reform of [[medical education|medical]] and [[higher education]] in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=E. Richard|title=Rockefeller Medicine Men: Medicine and Capitalism in America|publisher=University of California Press Ltd.|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA|isbn=0520042697|pages=135–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After founding and directing a college-preparatory school in his hometown of [[Louisville, Kentucky]], Flexner published a critical assessment of the state of the American educational system in 1908 titled ''The American College: A Criticism''. His work attracted the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Foundation]] to commission an in-depth evaluation into 155 medical schools in the US and Canada.&lt;ref name="Bonner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonner|first1=Thomas Neville|title=Searching for Abraham Flexner|journal=Academic Medicine|date=February 1998|volume=73|issue=2|pages=160–166|doi=10.1097/00001888-199802000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his resultant self-titled ''[[Flexner Report]]'', published in 1910, that sparked the reform of [[medical education]] in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; Flexner was also a founder of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], which brought together some of the greatest minds in history to collaborate on intellectual discovery and research.&lt;ref name="Bonner" /&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Flexner was born in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] on November 13, 1866. He was the sixth of nine children born to German Jewish immigrants, Ester and Moritz Flexner.&lt;ref name="Autobiography"&gt;''Abraham Flexner: An Autobiography'', New York: SImon and Schuster, 1960, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first in his family to complete high school and go on to college.&lt;ref name="Bonner" /&gt; In 1886, at age 19, Flexner completed a Bachelor of Arts in [[classics]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he studied for only two years. In 1905, he pursued graduate studies in [[psychology]] at [[Harvard University]], and at the [[University of Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2003/ms003042.pdf |title=Abraham Flexner Papers – A Finding Aid to the Collection in the Library of Congress |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |page=4 |date=April 2010 |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not, however, complete work on an advanced degree at either institution.

===Personal life===
Flexner had three brothers named Jacob, Bernard and Simon Flexner. He also had a sister named Rachel Flexner.&lt;ref name="ias.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Abraham Flexner|url=https://www.ias.edu/people/flexner |publisher=Institute for Advanced Study}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of Abraham Flexner's experimental schooling allowed him to help finance [[Simon Flexner]]'s medical education at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]]. He proceeded to become a pathologist, bacteriologist and a medical researcher employed by the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research]] from 1901 to 1935.&lt;ref name="ias.edu" /&gt;

[[File:aflexner21.jpg|thumb|right|Flexner circa 1895]]
Flexner also financed his sister's undergraduate studies at [[Bryn Mawr College]]. Jacob ran a drugstore and used the profits from selling the establishment to attend medical school. He then practiced as a physician in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]. Bernard pursued a career in law and later practiced in both Chicago and New York.&lt;ref name="ias.edu" /&gt;

In 1896, Flexner married a former student of his school, [[Anne Crawford Flexner|Anne Laziere Crawford]]. She was a teacher who soon became a successful playwright and children's author. The success of her play ''Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch'' (based on the [[Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch|1901 novel]]) funded Flexner's studies at Harvard and his year abroad at European universities. The couple had two daughters Jean and Eleanor. Jean went on to become one of the original employees of the United States Division of Labor Standards. [[Eleanor Flexner]] became an independent scholar and pioneer of women's studies.&lt;ref name="ias.edu" /&gt;

Flexner grew up in an [[Orthodox Jew]]ish family, however, early on he became a religious agnostic.&lt;ref name="Bonner" /&gt;

In addition to contributions by his brother Simon, their nephew, [[Louis B. Flexner|Louis Barkhouse Flexner]], was founding director of the Mahoney Institute of Neurological Sciences at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and a former editor of the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Death===
Flexner died in [[Falls Church, Virginia]], in 1959 at 92 years of age. He was buried in [[Cave Hill Cemetery]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name="ias.edu"/&gt;

==Career==

===Experimental schooling===
After graduating from Johns Hopkins University in two years with a degree in classics, Flexner returned to Louisville to teach classics at [[Louisville Male High School]]. Four years later, Flexner founded a private school in which he would test his growing ideas about education. Flexner opposed the standard model of education that focused on mental discipline and a rigid structure. Moreover, "Mr. Flexner's School" did not give out traditional grades, used no standard curriculum, refused to impose examinations on students, and kept no academic record of students. Instead, it promoted small learning groups, individual development, and a more hands-on approach to education. Graduates of his school were soon accepted at leading colleges, and his teaching style began to attract considerable attention.&lt;ref name="Bonner" /&gt;

===''The American College''===
In 1908, Flexner published his first book, ''The American College''. Strongly critical of many aspects of American higher education, it denounced, in particular, the university lecture as a method of instruction. According to Flexner, lectures enabled colleges to "handle cheaply by wholesale a large body of students that would be otherwise unmanageable and thus give the lecturer time for research." In addition, Flexner was concerned about the chaotic condition of the undergraduate curriculum and the influence of the research culture of the university. Neither contributed to the mission of the college to address the whole person. He feared that "research had largely appropriated the resources of the college, substituting the methods and interest of highly specialized investigation for the larger objects of college teaching."&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Flexner, ''The American College'', New York: The Century Company, 1908, pp. 215–216&lt;/ref&gt;

His book attracted the attention of [[Henry Pritchett]], president of the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]], who was looking for someone to lead a series of studies of professional education. The book consistently cited Pritchett in discussions of views on educational reform, and the two soon arranged to meet through the then-president of [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Ira Remsen]]. Although Flexner had never set foot inside a medical school, he was Pritchett's first choice to lead a study of American medical education, and soon joined the research staff at the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] in 1908. Although not a physician himself, Flexner was selected by Pritchett for his writing ability and his disdain for traditional education.&lt;ref name="Bonner" /&gt;

===''Flexner Report''===
{{main article|Flexner Report}}
In 1910, Flexner published the ''Flexner Report'', which examined the state of American medical education and led to far-reaching reform in the training of doctors. The ''Flexner Report'' led to the closure of most rural medical schools and all but two African-American medical colleges in the United States, given his adherence to [[germ theory]], in which he argued that if not properly trained and treated, African-Americans and the poor posed a health threat to middle/upper class whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beck AH |title=The Flexner Report and the standardization of American medical education|journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] |volume=291|pages=2139–2140| url =http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/291/17/2139 |doi=10.1001/jama.291.17.2139 |year=2004 |pmid=15126445|issue=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His position was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The practice of the Negro doctor will be limited to his own race, which in its turn will be cared for better by good Negro physicians than by poor white ones. But the physical well-being of the Negro is not only of moment to the Negro himself. Ten million of them live in close contact with sixty million whites. Not only does the Negro himself suffer from hookworm and tuberculosis; he communicates them to his white neighbors, precisely as the ignorant and unfortunate white contaminates him. Self-protection not less than humanity offers weighty counsel in this matter; self-interest seconds philanthropy. The Negro must be educated not only for his sake, but for ours. He is, as far as the human eye can see, a permanent factor in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Black Physicians and Black Hospitals|url=http://medicine.missouri.edu/ophthalmology/uploads/ch06.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002104238/http://medicine.missouri.edu/ophthalmology/uploads/ch06.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-10-02|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ironically, one of the schools, [[Louisville National Medical College]], was located in Flexner's hometown. In response to the report, some schools fired senior faculty members in a process of reform and renewal.&lt;ref&gt;World J Surg. 2012 Mar;36(3):684–8 https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/32172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on Europe===
Flexner soon conducted a related study of medical education in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/33462 |title=T-Space at The University of Toronto Libraries: Medical education in Europe; a report to the Carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching (1912) |publisher=Tspace.library.utoronto.ca |date= |accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bonner (2002), Flexner's work came to be "nearly as well known in Europe as in America."&lt;ref name="Bonner"/&gt; With funding from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], Flexner "...exerted a decisive influence on the course of medical training and left an enduring mark on some of the nation's most renowned schools of medicine."&lt;ref name="Bonner"/&gt; Bonner worried that "the imposition of rigid standards by accrediting groups was making the medical curriculum a monstrosity," with medical students moving through it with "little time to stop, read, work or think." Bonner (2002) calls Flexner "the severest critic and the best friend American medicine ever had."&lt;ref name="Bonner"/&gt;

===New Lincoln School===
Between 1912 and 1925, Flexner served on the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]'s [[General Education Board]], and after 1917 was its secretary. With the help of the board, he founded another experimental school, the [[New Lincoln School#History|Lincoln School]], which opened in 1917, in cooperation with the faculty at [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers College]] of [[Columbia University]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Institute for Advanced Study===
{{main article|Institute for Advanced Study}}
[[File:Albert Einstein and Abraham Flexner at the Institute for Advanced Study.jpg|thumb|right|260px|left to right: [[Albert Einstein]], Abraham Flexner, John R. Hardin, and Herbert Maass at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] on May 22, 1939]]
The [[Louis Bamberger|Bambergers]], heirs to a [[Bamberger's|department store]] fortune, were set on creating a medical school in Newark, New Jersey that gave admissions preference to Jewish applicants in an effort to fight the rampant prejudice against Jews in the medical profession at that time. Flexner informed them that a teaching hospital and other faculties required a successful school. A few months later, in June 1930, he had persuaded the Bamberger siblings and their representatives to fund instead the development of an Institute for Advanced Study.&lt;ref name="ias.edu" /&gt;

The Institute was headed by Flexner from 1930 to 1939 and it possessed a renowned faculty including [[Kurt Gödel]] and [[John von Neumann]].

During his time there, Flexner helped bring over many European scientists who would likely have suffered persecution by the rising [[Nazi]] government. This included [[Albert Einstein]], who arrived at the Institute in 1933 under Flexner's directorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abraham Flexner|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/210137/Abraham-Flexner|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Universities: American, English, German''===
In his 1930 ''Universities: American, English, German'',&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/universitiesamer008115mbp&lt;/ref&gt; Flexner returned to his earlier interest in the direction and purpose of the American university, attacking distractions from serious learning, such as [[College athletics|intercollegiate athletics]], [[Students' union|student government]], and other student activities.

==Legacy==
* The ''[[Flexner Report]]'' and his work in education has had a lasting impact on medical and higher education. The specific impacts of the ''Flexner Report'' on American and Canadian medicine include:
** Average physician quality has increased significantly&lt;ref name="Barzansky1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barzansky|first=Barbara|title=Beyond Flexner: Medical Education in the Twentieth Century|year=1992|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0313259845|edition=1. publ.|author2=Gevitz, Norman |authorlink2=Norman Gevitz }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Medicine has become a lucrative and well-respected profession
** A physician must receive at minimum six years, preferably eight years of post-secondary education, typically in a university setting
** Medical education is based on research, specifically in the fields of human [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]]
** Medical research follows the same protocols as scientific research&lt;ref name="Beck2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=Andrew H.|title=The Flexner report and the standardization of American medical education |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] |date=May 5, 2004|volume=291|issue=17|pages=2139–40|doi=10.1001/jama.291.17.2139|pmid=15126445|url=http://www.cosbyig.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Flexner-report.pdf|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
** The state government must approve the founding of any medical school and medical schools are subject to state regulation 
** The state branches of the [[American Medical Association]] oversee all the conventional medical schools in each state
* The Institute for Advanced Study, which Flexner co-founded, has been conducting valuable research for over 80 years in attempt to understand the complexities of the physical world and humanity

==Honors==
*The [[Association of American Medical Colleges]] created the Abraham Flexner Award for Distinguished Service to Medical Education to annually recognize individuals who have made a notable contribution to American medical education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.aamc.org/initiatives/awards/flexner/|title = Association of American Medical Colleges|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[University of Kentucky College of Medicine]] created the Abraham Flexner Master Educator Awards to recognize achievement in six categories: 
** Educational Leadership and Administration
** Outstanding Teaching Contribution or Mentorship
** Educational Innovation and Curriculum Development
** Educational Evaluation and Research
** Faculty Development in Education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Abraham Flexner Master Educator Awards Categories {{!}} Office of Medical Education|url = https://meded.med.uky.edu/abraham-flexner-master-educator-awards-categories|website = meded.med.uky.edu|accessdate = April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Abraham Flexner Way in [[downtown Louisville]]'s hospital district was named by the [[Louisville Board of Aldermen]] in November 1978 to honor Flexner.

There are four grading systems (or scales) in [[Greece]] – four different GPA – one for higher education, one for secondary education, and two for primary education (grades 3 to 4 and 5 to 6).

== Primary School ==

In 1st and 2nd grades in Greek primary schools there is only descriptive evaluation, with no grades included. In the 3rd and 4th grade grades are only letters (Α-Δ) and in 5th and 6th grades numbers ranging from 1-10 are used.

=== Third and Fourth grade ===

For the National Technical University of Athens (polytehnio) the above grades are different:
9-10 is "excellent", 
7-9 is "very good", 
5-7 is "good", 
0-4.9 is "fail".

Most of the degrees can be equivalent to a bachelor's degree with honours BSc(Hons) / [[Bachelor of Engineering|BEng(Hons)]] since all courses are 4 to 5 years and most of them professionally accredited. 
All modules, from all years, must be passed with a minimum grade of 5.00 (50%) in order for a degree to be assessed/awarded and there is currently no limit in resits. 
The classification (Ἀριστα, Λίαν Καλὠς, Καλὠς) is derived from the overall credit-weighted average for all modules including the 'diplomatiki' (university/polytechnic) or 'ptichiaki' (TEI). (dissertation/project)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16603">'''Asynchronous learning''' is a [[Student-centred learning|student-centered]] teaching method that uses online learning resources to facilitate information sharing outside the constraints of time and place among a network of people.&lt;ref name="Mayadas, F. 1997"&gt;{{Citation | last = Mayadas | first = F |date=March 1997 | title = Asynchronous learning networks: a Sloan Foundation perspective | journal = Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks | volume = 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Asynchronous learning is based on [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist theory]], a student-centered approach that emphasizes the importance of peer-to-peer interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Wu | first1 = D | last2 = Bieber | first2 = M | last3 = Hiltz | first3 = S |date=Fall 2008 | title = Engaging students with constructivist participatory examinations in asynchronous learning networks | journal = Journal of Information Systems Education | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 321–30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach combines self-study with asynchronous interactions to promote learning, and it can be used to facilitate learning in traditional on-campus education, [[distance education]], and [[continuing education]]. This combined network of learners and the electronic network in which they communicate are referred to as an asynchronous learning network.&lt;ref name="Mayadas, F. 1997" /&gt;

The online learning resources used to support asynchronous learning include [[email]], [[electronic mailing lists]], [[Threaded discussion|threaded conferencing systems]], [[Internet forum|online discussion boards]], [[wikis]], and [[blogs]].  [[Learning management system|Course management systems]] such as CampusCruiser LMS,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.campuscruiser.com/Products-Solutions/Products/CampusCruiser-LMS.aspx | title = CampusCruiser}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Desire2Learn]], [[Blackboard Learn|Blackboard]], [[WebCT]], [[Moodle]], and [[Sakai Project|Sakai]], have been developed to support online interaction, allowing users to organize discussions, post and reply to messages, and upload and access [[multimedia]].&lt;ref name= "Bourne, J.R. 1998"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bourne | first = JR |date=September 1998 | title = Net-learning: strategies for on-campus and off-campus network-enabled learning | journal = Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks | volume = 2 | issue = 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These asynchronous forms of communication are sometimes supplemented with synchronous components, including text and voice [[online chat|chat]], telephone conversations, [[videoconferencing]], and even meetings in virtual spaces such as ''[[Second Life]]'', where discussions can be facilitated among groups of students.&lt;ref name="Bourne, J.R. 1998" /&gt;

==History==
The roots of asynchronous learning are in the end of the 19th century, when formalized correspondence education (or [[distance learning]]) first took advantage of the postal system to bring physically remote learners into the educational fold.  The 1920s and 1930s saw the introduction of recorded audio, desynchronizing broadcasting and revolutionizing the mass dissemination of information.  The first significant distribution of standardized educational content took place during [[World War II]]; the branches of the US military produced hundreds of training films, with screenings numbering in the millions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Reiser | first = Robert |date=June 2001 | title = A History of instructional design and technology: Part II: A history of instructional design | journal = Educational Technology Research and Development | volume = 49 | issue = 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Online asynchronous learning began with schools' and universities' substantial investment in computer technology in the early 1980s. With seminal applications such as Seymour Papert's [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]] programming language, students were able to learn at their own pace, free from the synchronous constraints of a classroom lecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Logothings | accessdate = October 15, 2008 | url = http://logothings.wikispaces.com/ | publisher = Wikispaces}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  As computers entered more households and schools began connecting to the nascent [[Internet]], asynchronous learning networks began to take shape. These networks augmented existing classroom learning and led to a new correspondence model for solitary learners.

Using the web, students could access resources online and communicate asynchronously using email and discussion boards. The 1990s saw the arrival of the first telecampuses, with universities offering courses and entire degree plans through a combination of synchronous and asynchronous online instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = UTTC Overview and Mission | publisher = UT Telecampus | accessdate = October 15, 2008 | url = http://telecampus.utsystem.edu/aboututtc/organizationoverview/mission.aspx}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Shah | first = Angela |date=August 1999 | title = College going online | journal = Austin American Statesman | volume = B1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, advanced multimedia and interactivity have enhanced the utility of asynchronous learning networks and blurred the divide between content-creator and content-consumer.  New tools like class blogs and wikis are creating ever-richer opportunities for further asynchronous interaction and learning.

==Development of an asynchronous community==
Though the [[social relationships]] integral to group learning can be developed through asynchronous communication, this development tends to take longer than in traditional, face-to-face settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cox | first = B |date=Summer 2008 | title = Developing interpersonal and group dynamics through asynchronous threaded discussions | journal = Education | accessdate = October 9, 2008 | url = http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of an asynchronous community takes time and effort and tends to follow a projected course of five stages, as described by Waltonen-Moore et al.:

# Introductions – This might include a full biography or a short "getting-to-know-you" questions. Through this step, community members begin to see one another as human beings and begin to make a preliminary, emotive connection with the other members of the community. This step is often characterized by emotive or extravagant language and represents group members' attempts to make themselves known as living individuals behind the emotionless technology medium.&lt;ref name = "web.ebscohost.com"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Waltonen-Moore | first1 = S | last2 = Stuart | first2 = D | last3 = Newton | first3 = E | last4 = Oswald | first4 = R | last5 = Varonis | first5 = E |date=Summer 2006 | title = From virtual strangers to a cohesive online learning community: the evolution of online group development in a professional development course | journal = Journal of Technology and Teacher Education | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | accessdate = October 9, 2008 | url = http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Identify with the group – Members begin to communicate with one another by reference to their commonalities as group members and seek to either establish or make known [[Norms (sociology)|norms]] for successful membership. If this sense of [[group identity]] is not established, the likelihood of poor participation or attrition increases.&lt;ref name="web.ebscohost.com"/&gt;
# Interact – Members will start interacting with one another in reference to the community's established focus and begin to share information with one another.&lt;ref name="web.ebscohost.com"/&gt; If the community is an online learning course, then students will begin to discuss course content.
# Group cohesion and individual reflection – members of the group will begin to validate one another's ideas and opinions while, at the same time, being reflective of their own.&lt;ref name="web.ebscohost.com"/&gt;
# Expansive questioning – Now feeling completely comfortable within the environment, focused upon the content, and respectful of other group members' thoughts and experiences, members will begin to not only post facts and deeply held beliefs, but will actually start to "think out loud", allowing other group members to take part in their personal meaning-making and self-directed inquiry.&lt;ref name="web.ebscohost.com"/&gt;

Asynchronous communities that progress efficiently through these stages tend to share at least three common attributes:

First, the community has an active [[facilitator]] who monitors, guides, and nurtures the discourse.&lt;ref name="web.ebscohost.com"/&gt; Unguided communities tend to have difficulty progressing beyond the second stage of development, because group members can become distracted from the community's intended purpose.

Second, rather than seeking to take on the role of an instructor or disseminator of knowledge, the facilitator recognizes that knowledge is an individual construct that is developed through interaction with other group members.&lt;ref name="web.ebscohost.com"/&gt; Thus, facilitators within successful communities tend not to be pedantic, but supportive.

And third, successful asynchronous communities permit a certain amount of leniency for play within their discourse.&lt;ref name= "web.ebscohost.com"/&gt; That is, communities that insist upon being overly stringent on etiquette and make no room for the social development that comes from play seem to drive away participants.  Rather than enriching discourse on the targeted topic, such attitudes have a negative impact on group identity development and individual comfort levels which will, in turn, decrease overall involvement.

==Roles of instructors and learners==
Online learning requires a shift from a teacher-centered environment to a student-centered environment where the instructor must take on multiple new roles.  The constructivist theory that supports asynchronous learning demands that instructors become more than dispensers of knowledge; it requires that they become [[instructional designer]]s, facilitators, and assessors of both grades and their teaching methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = McQuiggan | first = CA |date=Fall 2007 | title = The role of faculty development in online teaching's potential to question teaching beliefs and assumptions | journal = Online Journal of Distance Learning Administration | volume = 10 | accessdate = October 11, 2008 | url = http://www.westga.edu/~distance/ojdla/fall103/mcquiggan103.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As instructional designers, emphasis is placed on establishing the curriculum, methods and the media through which the content will be effectively delivered. Once the design is in place and executed, the instructor must then facilitate the communication and direct the learning. Instructors typically have to be proficient with elements of electronic communication, as asynchronous courses are reliant on email and discussion board communications and the instruction methods are reliant on virtual libraries of e-documents, graphics, and audio files.  Establishing a communal spirit is vital, requiring much time commitment from the instructor, who must spend time reading, assessing, reinforcing, and encouraging the interaction and learning that is happening.&lt;ref name="Shea, P. J. 2003"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Shea | first1 = PJ | last2 = Pickett | first2 = AM | last3 = Pelz | first3 = WE | year = 2003 | title = A follow-up investigation of ‘teaching presence' in the SUNY Learning Network | journal = Journal for Asynchronous Learning Networks | volume = 7 | pages = 61–80}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The student-centered nature of asynchronous online learning requires students to be actively involved with and take more responsibility for their own learning.  In addition to their normal duties as learners, students are required to:

* Become proficient with the technology required for the course;
* Use new methods of communication with both peers and instructors;
* Strengthen their interdependency through collaboration with their peers.&lt;ref name="Garrison, D. R. 2004"&gt;{{Citation | last = Garrison | first = DR | year = 2004 | title = Student role adjustment in online communities of inquiry: model and instrument validation | journal = Journal for Asynchronous Learning Networks | volume = 8 | pages = 61–74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strengths==

Asynchronous learning's greatest benefit to students is the freedom it gives them to access the course and its instructional materials at any time they choose, and from any location, with an Internet connection.&lt;ref name="Mayadas, F. 1997" /&gt; This allows for accessibility for diverse student populations, ranging from traditional, on-campus students, to working professionals, to international students in foreign countries.

Asynchronous learning environments provide a "high degree of interactivity" between participants who are separated both geographically and temporally and afford students many of the social benefits of face-to-face interaction.&lt;ref name="Mayadas, F. 1997" /&gt; Since students can express their thoughts without interruption, they have more time to reflect on and respond to class materials and their classmates than in a traditional classroom.&lt;ref name="Shea, P. J. 2003" /&gt;

Research shows that the time required to initially design an asynchronous course is comparable to that of a traditional synchronous course.&lt;ref name="Bourne, J.R. 1998" /&gt; However, most asynchronous courses have the potential to reach far more students than a traditional course and course-wide updates or modifications can be disseminated far more quickly and efficiently than traditional lecture models.

Schifter notes that a perceived additional workload is a significant barrier to faculty participation in distance education and asynchronous learning, but that perception can be mitigated through training and experience with teaching in these environments.&lt;ref name="Garrison, D. R. 2004" /&gt;

Another advantage of asynchronous learning (and, as technology develops, many synchronous learning environments) is that there is a record of nearly everything that occurs in that environment. All materials, correspondence, and interactions can be electronically archived. Participants can go back and review course materials, lectures, and presentations, as well as correspondence between participants. This information is generally available at any time to course participants.

==Shortcomings==
Asynchronous learning environments pose several challenges for instructors, institutions, and students. Course development and initial setup can be costly. Institutions must provide a computer network infrastructure, including servers, audio/visual equipment, software, and the technical support needed to develop and maintain asynchronous learning environments. Technical support includes initial training and setup, user management, data storage and recovery, as well as hardware repairs and updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Palmer | first1 = S | last2 = Holt | first2 = D | last3 = Bray | first3 = S | year = 2008 | title = Does the discussion help? the impact of a formally assessed online discussion on final student results | journal = British Journal of Educational Technology | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 847–58 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00780.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research indicates faculty members who are hesitant to teach in asynchronous learning environments are so because of a lack of technical support provided by their institutions.&lt;ref name="Garrison, D. R. 2004" /&gt; However, for faculty to teach successfully in an asynchronous learning environment, they must be technically adept and comfortable enough with the technological tools to optimize their use.

To participate in asynchronous learning environments, students must also have access to computers and the Internet. Although personal computers and web access are becoming more and more pervasive every day, this requirement can be a barrier to entry for many students and instructors. Students must also have the computer/technology skills required to participate in the asynchronous learning program.

The '''British Association of Teachers of Dance''' (BATD) is a UK-based dance examination board, with its Head Office in Glasgow, Scotland.  The officially recognised date for the formation of the society is 30 November 1892, making it the first professional dance organization of its kind in the United Kingdom, and the second oldest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;The American Society of Teachers of Dancing was organized in 1879 and incorporated in 1883. Richardson P.J.S. 1960. ''The social dances of the nineteenth century in England''. Jenkins, London. p121&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the BATD ==

Founded in 1892, the BATD became the first UK dance association of its kind to encourage the organisation of dance professionals into an organised society.  The association may have been in operation earlier than this, however 30 November 1892 is the first recorded date that can be established beyond doubt (see BATD website).

There were 24 founder members recorded in 1892, with an estimated 3,500 members registered by the year 1999.

The British Association is represented in the following countries:
* [[United Kingdom]]
* [[Malta]]
* [[Canada]]
* [[United States|United States of America]]
* [[Australia]]
* [[South Africa]]
* [[Spain]]
* [[France]]
* [[Italy]]
* [[Netherlands]]
* [[Germany]]
* [[Belarus]]
* [[Latvia]]
* [[South Korea]]
The BATD is represented in many other countries, but this list shows those countries where there are a notable number of registered members or where regular meetings of the association are held.

== Configuration of the Society ==
The Society is managed by a President, Vice-Presidents, Trustees Treasurer and an Executive Council.  These are all elected positions, which are balloted at the societies annual conference.
There are various other regional or district committees, which organize meetings, lectures, seminars and other events for the membership in their district.  These positions are nominated and elected by the membership of each district and include a Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, Secretary, Treasurer and Marshall.
Members of the society can seek higher office, first at regional level then at the Executive level.

[[Diane Barron]] was the president of the Association from 2001 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diane Barron]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Branches ==
The primary work of the society is to provide examination syllabi in various dance styles.  There are a number of branches within the society that each specialise in a specific dance subject. They are:
* [[Tap dance|Tap]]
* Stage (known as Theatre or Stage Craft in other organisations)
* [[Ballet]]
* [[Scottish highland dance|Highland]]
* [[Modern Dance]]
* [[Jazz]]
* [[Acro Gymnastics|Acrobatic Dance]]
* [[Hornpipe]]
* [[Jig]]
* Traditional [[Step dance|Step Dancing]]
* European National Ballroom
* Latin American
* Classical
* [[Disco]]
* [[Rock'n'Roll]]
* Country and Western
* [[Scottish Country Dance]]
* [[Dance Exercise]]
* [[Scottish National Dance]]
* [[Majorette (dancer)|Majorette]]
* Dance and Drama
* Special Needs Awards
A range of examinations and awards are available in each dance discipline for children of all ages.  These are typically organized into grades or medal tests, with the work being assessed by a BATD registered examiner.  As well as these examinations for children, the society also offers training for adults and teacher training for dance professionals who wish to become a registered teacher with the BATD.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4591">The '''Center for Railroad Photography &amp; Art''', in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], was incorporated as a [[nonprofit corporation]] in [[Wisconsin]] on December 9, 1997, to inform “the public about [[railroad]] photography and art through education, research and public service programs.” The Center was fostered by John Gruber, a writer with a lifelong interest in railroads and their history who'd had the hobby of photographing railroads since 1960. The Railway and Locomotive History Society honored Gruber in 1994 with a [[lifetime achievement award]] in railroad photography.

While the Center selectively collects [[high-quality photographs]] and works of art related to [[railroading]] and [[railroad workers]], it has no museum, but rather collaborates with [[archives]] and public museums in creating programs with a national outreach. These programs include [[exhibitions]], publications, conferences, a website, and an Internet archive (railroadheritage.org).

== Exhibitions ==
The Center’s first exhibition, Railroads and Photography: 150 Years of Great Images, opened in 1999 at Railfair at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento, later traveling to Altoona, Pennsylvania; Madison, Wisconsin; Lake Forest and Champaign, Illinois; St. Louis, Missouri; Carson City and Ely, Nevada; and Kennesaw, Georgia. Beginning in 2003, with support from the North American Railroad Foundation, the Center created seven photography exhibitions related to “Representations of Railroad Work, Past and Present,” which were shown on both coasts and in the Midwest, notably at Grand Central Terminal in New York City and the state capitol in Madison, Wisconsin. A summary report, It’s Work, resulted.

In 2006, the Center mounted an exhibition of photography and watercolors by the noted artist, Ted Rose, who was asked by the U.S. Postal Service to create [[All Aboard! 20th Century American Trains|railroad-themed U.S. postage stamps]]. The exhibition, which was shown at the Haggerty Museum of Marquette University in Milwaukee and the California State Railroad Museum, was accompanied by a catalog that summarizes Rose’s life and career. The Center also collaborated with Thomas H. Garver to prepare an exhibition (at the Southeast Missouri Regional Museum in Cape Girardeau and the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento) about the photographs of O. Winston Link, the famed railroad photographer and sound recorder.

== Publications ==
Besides the catalogs associated with exhibitions, the Center has produced twenty issues of the journal Railroad Heritage, which began in 2000. Early issues carried articles about noted photographers and artists, plus news of contemporary events. Others have been devoted to conference proceedings, the role of women in railroading, representations of work in railroad photography and art, and the photography of [[Lucius Beebe]] and [[Charles Clegg]].

== Public programs ==
Since 2003, the Center has sponsored annual conferences and an awards program for contemporary railroad photography. In 2006, conferences in Milwaukee and in College Station, Texas, observed the centennial of the diesel locomotive with historical presentations and discussions of the diesel’s effect on railroad art. Public programs have accompanied each exhibition.

== Internet archive ==
In 2007, again with support from the [[North American Railway Foundation]], the Center launched a descriptive website, “railroadheritage.org.” It reproduces images related to railroading from the 1840s to the present, coupled with explanatory texts that describe the images’ content and their historical, technological, and aesthetic importance. The images are drawn from the Center’s own collections and from significant public and private collections around the country. A number of museums and archives are collaborating in the effort. In 2008, the Center extracted thirty-two images from railroadheritage.org and created "American Railroad History in a Nutshell," a feature on the site that depicts and describes, in a digest form, the importance of railroads, their development, and some social historical elements of railroads and railroading.

Since 2009 it has been the subject of numerous controversies due to a supposed political role and in support of the interests of the category of the rectors that compose it, despite the nature of university association. In particular, it was criticized for its support for the draft of the 1905 Law by Minister Gelmini. The criticisms have sometimes come from some of the rectors themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.andu-universita.it/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/rettore-e-crui-2.pdf |title= Bo, il rettore al megafono |trans-title=Bo, the rector with the megaphone |work= {{illm|Corriere del Veneto|it}} |date= 20 July 2010 |quote= La CRUI ''a detta del rettore Zaccaria, [è] "rea" di aver dato fiducia a 360 gradi al disegno di legge Gelmini e alla manovra correttiva che "rischia di dare il colpo di grazia all'istruzione e alla ricerca" |language=it }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://rstampa.istruzione.it/utility/imgrs.asp?numart=URI0C&amp;numpag=1&amp;tipcod=0&amp;tipimm=1&amp;defimm=0&amp;tipnav=1 |title= Il rettore del Politecnico: 'La tragedia dell'università italiana ha assunto toni di farsa...' |trans-title=The rector of the Polytechnic: 'The tragedy of the Italian university has become a farce...' |work= Nuovo Corriere Barisera |date= 19 October 2010 |quote=La CRUI e, in misura minore, il CUN hanno rinunciato ad esercitare un ruolo critico e propositivo, svendendo la propria autorevolezza accademica e la propria indipendenza istituzionale in cambio del piatto di lenticchie di vaghe promesse di revisione dei tagli |language=it }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4153">A '''curriculum framework''' is an organized plan or set of standards or [[outcome-based education|learning outcome]]s that defines the content to be learned in terms of clear, definable standards of what the student should know and be able to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/wa2/buildingcathedrals/measuringsuccess.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041118204211/http://www.angelfire.com/wa2/buildingcathedrals/measuringsuccess.html |archivedate=2004-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A curriculum framework is part of an [[outcome-based education]] or [[standards based education reform]] design. The framework is the second step, defining clear, high standards which will be achieved by all students. The curriculum is then aligned to the standards, and students are assessed against the standards. As compared with [[traditional education]] which is concerned only about delivering content, a [[standards based education reform]] system promises that all will succeed if all are held to high expectations. When the standards are reached, there will be no [[achievement gap]] where some groups are allowed to score lower than others, or the disabled are offered different opportunities than others. All will meet world class standards and be qualified for good colleges and trained for good jobs which pay good wages. In a [[traditional education]] system, the curriculum was defined by those who created textbooks rather than government bodies which assembled groups of stakeholders to create standards based on consensus of what students should know and be able to do.

In some states, curriculum frameworks have been adopted based on traditional academic standards rather than outcome-based constructivist standards, but many frameworks were originally or still based on student-centered learning and constructivism such as [[reform mathematics]], [[whole language]] and [[Inquiry-based Science]] which have been controversial in some states and communities. [[High school graduation examination]]s tie awarding of diplomas to demonstration of meeting the standards set out in the frameworks.

The '''Defence Survive, Evade, Resist, Extract (SERE) Training Organisation''', otherwise known as '''DSTO''', is a military training organisation based at [[RAF St Mawgan|RAF St. Mawgan]], [[Cornwall]] In the United Kingdom. DSTO is a tri-service organisation and trains personnel of the British armed forces in [[Survival skills|survival techniques]], evading capture and resistance from interrogation, prior to overseas deployment.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force have what has been described as a "rich history of survival training". Crews were often lost at sea during the [[Second World War]] which prompted this training to be initiated.&lt;ref name=":SM:"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafstmawgan/aboutus/defenceseretraining.cfm|title=RAF - Defence SERE Training|website=www.raf.mod.uk|language=en|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the DSTO being established, each of the UK's armed forces carried out their own SERE training. The RAF and Royal Navy each provided their own defence, survive, evade and extract training whereas the Resistance Training Wing trained provided all services with resistance training. 

==== Royal Air Force ====
The Royal Air Force can trace such training back to May 1943 with the formation of the '''School of Air/Sea Rescue''', located near [[Blackpool Airport|RAF Squire Gate]] in Lancashire. The school taught RAF and USAAF crews rescue procedures and familiarisation with rescue equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pitchfork|first=Air Cdre Graham|date=2007|title=Training and Survival Aids|url=https://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/documents/Research/RAF-Historical-Society-Journals/Journal-40.pdf|journal=RAF Historical Society Journal|volume=40|pages=58-67|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It relocated to [[RAF Calshot]] in [[Hampshire]] in 1945, when it became the '''Survival and Rescue Training Unit''', before moving to [[RAF Thorney Island]] in [[West Sussex]] during 1946. It disbanded in April 1949, but was replaced by the '''Survival and Rescue Mobile Instruction Unit''' (SRMIU), again at Thorney Island, in January 1950. The SRMIU would provide training to personnel during annual visits to RAF stations, however this method was considered inadequate and in 1955 the '''Search, Rescue and Survival School''' was established as part of No. 2 Air Navigation School. The School moved to [[RAF Mount Batten]] near Plymouth In June 1959. At that time it was renamed the '''School of Combat Survival and Rescue''' (SCSR), reflecting the combat environment which it was expected that survival and rescue skills would typically be used. RAF Mount Batten closed in 1992, with the school relocated to [[RAF St Mawgan]] in [[Cornwall]], where it remained until 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mill|first=Flt Lt Philip|date=2007|title=The RAF Mount Batten Experience|url=https://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/documents/Research/RAF-Historical-Society-Journals/Journal-40.pdf|journal=RAF Historical Society Journal|volume=40|pages=122-133|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk:80/rafstmawgan/aboutus/historyofrafseretraining.cfm|title=History of RAF SERE Training|last=|first=|date=|website=RAF St Mawgan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806175056/http://www.raf.mod.uk:80/rafstmawgan/aboutus/historyofrafseretraining.cfm|archive-date=6 August 2015|dead-url=|access-date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Royal Navy ====
Before 1943, Royal Navy survival training and equipment was the responsibility of two [[Naval rating|ratings]] trained by the RAF. The significance of the work however resulted in a reorganisation whereby the navy would train its own Survival Equipment Officers and ratings. The new '''Royal Navy Survival Equipment School''' (RNSES) initially took up residence at Eastleigh in Hampshire before moving to improved accommodation at Grange Airfield ([[HMS Sultan (establishment)|HMS ''Siskin)'']] in March 1947. In 1955, the school moved to a former boy’s preparatory school (Seafield Park) at [[Hill Head]]. It remained at Hill Head until September 1991 when it relocated to the former Naval Aircraft Technical Evaluation Centre (NATEC) building at [[RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus)|RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS ''Daedalus'')]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafstmawgan/aboutus/historyofnavyseretraining.cfm|title=History of Navy SERE Training|last=|first=|date=|website=RAF St Mawgan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918053708/http://www.raf.mod.uk:80/rafstmawgan/aboutus/historyofnavyseretraining.cfm|archive-date=18 September 2015|dead-url=|access-date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1995, the RNSES become part of the Royal Navy Air Engineering School which was renamed '''Royal Navy Air Engineering and Survival School''' (RNAESS). When Lee-on-Solent closed in March 1996, the RNAESS was relocated to a purpose built building at [[HMS Sultan (establishment)|HMS ''Sultan'']] in [[Gosport]]. The unit was renamed the '''Survival Equipment Group''' and formed part of the Air Engineering and Survival Department, remaining at HMS ''Sultan'' until 2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Resistance Training Wing ====
Formerly 4 Conduct after Capture Company (4 CAC Coy), the Resistance Training Wing (RTW) was part of the now disbanded Joint Services Intelligence Organisation (JSIO) based at [[Joint Intelligence Training Group|Defence Intelligence Security Centre Chicksands]] in [[Bedfordshire]]. The wing trained personnel [[resistance to interrogation]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bahamousainquiry.org/baha_mousa_inquiry_evidence/evidencev1.htm|title=Witness Statement of Lieutenant Commander S059|last=|first=|date=5 May 2010|website=Baha Mousa Public Inquiry|page=2-3|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120215203918/http://www.bahamousainquiry.org/baha_mousa_inquiry_evidence/evidencev1.htm|archive-date=15 February 2012|dead-url=|access-date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Establishment ===
The Defence Survive, Evade, Resist, Extract (SERE) Training Organisation (DSTO) was created in 2008, when the RAF's School of Combat Survival and Rescue was amalgamated with the Royal Navy's Survival Equipment Group and the Resistance Training Wing. Although DSTO is a tri-service organisation, it comes under the control of [[No. 22 Group RAF|No. 22 Group]] within [[RAF Air Command]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Previous to this, training was undertaken at three different sites across the three services at diverse locations such as [[Joint Intelligence Training Group|Chicksands]] and at [[HMS Sultan (establishment)|HMS Sultan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newquayvoice.co.uk/news/5/article/2549/|title=Military return to st Mawgan welcomed {{!}} Newquay Voice|date=8 April 2009|work=www.newquayvoice.co.uk|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Air Force is the lead on aircrew-focused training for military personnel in the United Kingdom and their second training centre (ASTC) is located at [[RAF Cranwell]] in [[Lincolnshire]]. The patron of ASTC is [[Ray Mears]], who himself was in a SERE situation whilst filming in 2005 when his helicopter crashed in [[Wyoming]]. Mears managed to recover all of his crew to safety after the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Survival of the fittest|last1=Allen|first1=Tracey|date=21 October 2016|work=RAF News|publisher=Royal Air Force|issue=1405|page=21|issn=0035-8614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role and operations ==
'''SERE''' is an acronym for '''S'''urvive, '''E'''vade, '''R'''esist and '''E'''xtract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/43483/JWP366.pdf|title=JOINT WARFARE PUBLICATION 3-66 JOINT PERSONNEL RECOVERY.|quote=Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Extraction. SERE is an inclusive term (of US origin) that has recently superseded phrases previously used such as Escape and Evasion and Conduct After Capture. It encompasses all practical and theoretical measures required to prepare personnel for isolation, captivity and recovery.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At a basic level, this is a core aspect of training for all UK military personnel on an annual basis. [[British Army|Regular Army]] personnel are tested as part of their Military Annual Training Tests (MATTs)&lt;ref&gt;Defence Information Notice 2008DIN07-109&lt;/ref&gt; as befits their frontline nature (similar processes are run by the [[Royal Marines]] and [[RAF Regiment]]) with non-frontline personnel mandated to watch a DVD detailing SERE methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gage|editor1-first=William|title=The Baha Mousa Public Inquiry report.|date=2011|publisher=Stationery Office|location=London|isbn=978-0-10-297492-8|page=1256|chapter=6: Survive, Evade, Resist &amp; Extract (SERE) training given to UK service personnel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UK armed forces personnel who train at the SERE school, may be subject to methods of interrogation that are prohibited under international law. This training is carried out under strictly controlled conditions and is only delivered to enable the trainees to understand the methods that may be used against them if they are captured by hostile forces who are not signatories to, or adherents of, the [[Geneva Convention]] or of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Army Inspectorate review into the implementation of policy, training and conduct of detainee handling|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/reports/2010/british_iraq_detainee_handling.pdf|website=globalsecurity.org|publisher=British Army|accessdate=10 February 2017|page=22|format=PDF|date=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SERE is mandated for all aircrew (from across all three services) and involves sea drills for those that require it. Sea drill involves jumping into the sea and spending some time adrift before hauling oneself into a dinghy from where the servicemember can be rescued. The [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]] aircrews practice this with regularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Air Force aircrews based at RAF Coningsby regularly undergo Survive Evade Resist and Extract (SERE) training in the North Sea|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafconingsby/newsweather/index.cfm?storyid=6A799B18-5056-A318-A8A95CC5B0BAA926|website=www.raf.mod.uk|accessdate=10 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television personality [[Carol Vorderman]] undertook sea drills SERE training at RAF St Mawgan as part of her effort to become the ninth female to fly solo around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilkins|first1=Warren|title=Star Carol's survival training|url=http://www.newquayvoice.co.uk/news/5/article/5930/|accessdate=10 February 2017 |work=[[Newquay Voice]] |date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; SERE training is also delivered to aircrew because the nature of their job makes them vulnerable to capture if they have to bale out over or crash an aircraft into hostile territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gould |first1=Matthew |last2=Meek |first2=Daniel |last3=Gibbs |first3=Tony |last4=Sawford |first4=Hannah |last5=Wessely|first5=Simon|last6=Greenberg|first6=Neil |title=What Are the Psychological Effects of Delivering and Receiving 'High-Risk' Survival Resistance Training? |journal=Military Medicine|date=February 2015|volume=180|issue=2|pages=168–177|publisher=Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S |location=Kensington, Maryland |issn=0026-4075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of Archaeology''' at the [[University of York]], England, is a [[academic department|department]] which provides undergraduate and postgraduate courses in [[archaeology]] and its sub-disciplines and conducts associated research. It was founded in 1978 and has grown from a small department based at Micklegate House to more than a hundred undergraduate students based at [[King's Manor]] and with scientific facilities at the '''BioArCh''' centre on the main campus.

==Hosted organisations, research specialities and fieldwork==
The archaeology department hosts several specialist organisations:
*[[Archaeology Data Service]] - an open access digital archive for archaeological research outputs
*[[Internet Archaeology]] - a fully peer-reviewed electronic journal for archaeology
*BioArCh - a specialist centre using scientific and molecular techniques for archaeology
*Centre for Digital Heritage - an interdisciplinary centre studying computer-based approaches to heritage. Working with the universities of [[Aarhus University|Aarhus]] (Denmark), [[Leiden University|Leiden]] (Netherlands), [[Lund University|Lund]] (Sweden), [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]] (Sweden).
*The ''Post Hole'' -  is an archaeology journal run by students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theposthole.org/about |title=The Post Hole |accessdate=11 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The department's faculty has led significant archaeological investigations across [[Great Britain]] and occasionally further afield

The department opened in 1978, 15 years after the [[University of York#History|university]] itself. The first head of department, [[Philip Rahtz]] built a thematic undergraduate programme specialising in the [[Britain in the Middle Ages|British Middle Ages]]. The programme included a 12-week field course in [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavation]].&lt;ref name="Dept History" /&gt; The department expanded under [[Martin Carver]] after his appointment in 1986. A [[postgraduate]] programme was added and the department moved to [[King's Manor]]. Subsequently, the department has grown in numbers of students, staff and the diversity of its specialisms: adding [[environmental archaeology]], [[prehistory]], [[computational archaeology]], [[archaeological science]] and [[cultural heritage management]].&lt;ref name="Dept History" /&gt;

'''[[Education]] in [[Iraq]]''' is administered by the [[Ministry of Education (Iraq)|Ministry of Education]].

[[UNESCO]] reports&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/education/iraq/na_13jan2005.pdf], IRAQ, EDUCATION IN TRANSITION NEEDS AND CHALLENGES 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; that prior to the first [[Gulf War]] in 1991 Iraq had one of the best educational performances in the region. Primary school Gross Enrollment Rate was 100% and literacy levels were high. Since that time education has suffered as a result of American-led domination, sanctions, and instability.

==History under Saddam==
[[File:Saddam1970s.jpg|thumb|[[Saddam Hussein]] Promoting women's literacy and education in the 1970s]]
Iraq established its education system in 1921, offering both public and private paths.  In the early 1970s, education became public and free at all levels, and mandatory at the primary level.  Two ministries manage the education system in Iraq: the Ministry of Education [MOE] and the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research [MOHSR].  The Ministry of Educatiocientific Research [MOHSR] is in charge of tertiary education and research centers.

On 1 June 1972, Saddam oversaw the seizure of international oil interests, which, at the time, dominated the country's oil sector. A year later, world oil prices rose dramatically as a result of the [[1973 energy crisis]], and skyrocketing revenues enabled Saddam to expand his agenda.

Within just a few years, Iraq was providing social services that were unprecedented among Middle Eastern countries. Saddam established and controlled the "National Campaign for the Eradication of Illiteracy" and the campaign for "Compulsory Free Education in Iraq," and largely under his auspices, the government established universal free schooling up to the highest education levels; hundreds of thousands learned to read in the years following the initiation of the program. The government also supported families of soldiers, granted free hospitalization to everyone, and gave subsidies to farmers. Iraq created one of the most modernized public-health systems in the Middle East, earning Saddam an award from the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news2/indepth/words/saddam_hussein.html Saddam Hussein], CBC News, 29 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Moore, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030625145156/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/iraq/war/player1.html The Iraq War player profile: Saddam Hussein's Rise to Power], PBS Online Newshour {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115205745/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/iraq/war/player1.html |date=15 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current structure, status, and scale of education in Iraq ==
[[File:Iraqi_students_receive_school_supplies_061031-F-9085B-140.jpg|thumb|An Iraqi boy at a primary school in the Bayaa District of Baghdad]]

It is generally agreed upon that before 1990, this Educational system in Iraq was one of the best in the region in addressing both access and equality.  However, the situation began to deteriorate rapidly due to several wars and economic sanctions.  According to UNESCO’s 2003 Situation Analysis of education in Iraq, the educational system in the Centre/South worsened despite the provision of basics through the Oil for Food Programme.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO.  Situation Analysis of Education in Iraq.  Paris: 2003, p.56&lt;/ref&gt;  Northern Iraq (Kurdistan) did not suffer as much due to rehabilitation and reconstruction programs organized through several UN agencies.

Since then, major problems have emerged that are hindering the system and include: lack of resources, the politicization of the educational system, uneven emigration and internal displacement of teachers and students, security threats, and corruption.  Illiteracy is widespread in comparison with before, standing at 39% for the rural population. Almost 22% of the adult population in Iraq has never attended school, and a mere 9% have secondary school as highest level completed. As far as gender equity, 47% of women in Iraq are either fully or partly illiterate, as women’s education suffers from differences across regions, and especially between the North and South{{Citation needed|date=September 2016|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; 22% of Iraqi Adults never attended high school!, 47% of Iraqi women are illetrate! were did you get your numbers from.}}.

Since the 2003 invasion and the fall of the former regime [Saddam Hussein], Iraqis with the help of international agencies and foreign governments, have been attempting to create frameworks that would begin to address the issues at hand.

According to the ''National Development Strategy '' of Iraq,&lt;ref&gt;Republic of Iraq.  Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation.  National Development Strategy [NDS] 2005-2007&lt;/ref&gt; published on June 30, 2005, the new vision for Iraq intends to:

“Transform Iraq into a peaceful, unified federal democracy and a prosperous, market-oriented regional economic powerhouse that is fully integrated into the global economy” .&lt;ref&gt;Republic of Iraq.  Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation.  National Development Strategy [NDS] 2005-2007, p. viii&lt;/ref&gt;

This stems from the fact that the country’s economy has been mismanaged for 40 years, and a country that once held a bright private sector and the educated population has come to have one of the lowest human development indicators in the region.

The National Development Strategy [NDS] contains four major areas of concentration:

* Strengthening the foundations of economic growth
* Revitalizing the private sector
* Improving quality of life
* Strengthening good governance and security

The major pillar above that includes the category of education is that of “Improving quality of life”, as ‘healthy citizens tend to be productive citizens that will be able to take advantage of the opportunities provided in a market-oriented economy’ .&lt;ref&gt;Republic of Iraq.  Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation.  National Development Strategy [NDS] 2005-2007, p.xi&lt;/ref&gt;  The exact strategy towards education includes ‘investing in human capital with a focus on adult literacy, vocational training, and actions to reduce drop-out rates at the primary level’ .&lt;ref&gt;Republic of Iraq.  Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation.  National Development Strategy [NDS] 2005-2007, p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education after the 2003 invasion==
[[File:Iraqi medical students at Basra University College of Medicine (2010).JPG|thumb|
Iraqi medical students at Basra University College of Medicine (2010)]]

Following the  [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]], with substantial international assistance, undertook a complete reform of Iraq’s education system. Among immediate goals were the removal of previously pervasive [[Baathist]] ideology from curricula and substantial increases in teacher salaries and training programs, which the [[Saddam Hussein|Hussein]] government was unable to provide in the 1990s. The new Ministry of Education appointed a national curriculum commission to revise curricula in all subject areas. Because of under-funding by the [[Hussein]] regime, in 2003 an estimated 80 percent of Iraq’s 15,000 school buildings needed rehabilitation and lacked basic sanitary facilities, and most schools lacked libraries and laboratories.

In the 1990s, school attendance decreased drastically as education funding was cut and economic conditions forced children into the workforce. After the regime change, the system included about 6 million students in kindergarten through twelfth grade and 300,000 teachers and administrators. Education is mandatory only through the sixth grade, after which a national examination determines the possibility of continuing into the upper grades. Although a vocational track is available to those who do not pass the exam, few students elect that option because of its poor quality. Boys and girls generally attend separate schools beginning with seventh grade. In 2005 obstacles to further reform were poor security conditions in many areas, a centralized system that lacked accountability for teachers and administrators, and the isolation in which the system functioned for the previous 30 years. Few private schools exist. (One notable example: The [[Classical School of the Medes]] in Northern Iraq.) Prior to the occupation of 2003, some 240,000 persons were enrolled in institutions of [[higher education]]. The CIA World Factbook estimates that in 2000 the adult [[literacy rate]] was 84 percent for males and 64 percent for females, with UN figures suggesting a small fall in literacy of Iraqis aged 15–24 between 2000 and 2008, from 84.8% to 82.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mdg/SeriesDetail.aspx?srid=656|work=[[Millennium Development Goals]] Indicators|title=Literacy rates of 15-24 years old, both sexes, percentage|publisher=[[United Nations]]|accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education under the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraqi Kurdistan in northern Iraq faces many problems. There is a large number of people who have "fake and bogus awards like MAs, PhDs and professorial titles". Loyal political party members with fake university titles hold "high official ranks from ministries to university chancellors, deans of colleges, general managers, administrators, supervisors and school headmasters".  Critics state that education in Iraqi Kurdistan is "overshadowed by political rivalry, media propaganda, fake patriotism, nationalist sentiments and party affiliation".  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairobserver.com/region/middle_east_north_africa/kurdinstan-education-sector-is-riddled-with-corruption-80326/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education under the Baathist regime before the 1990s ==
The impact of government policies on the class structure and stratification patterns can be imputed from available statistics on education and training as well as employment and wage structures. Owing to the historic emphasis on the expansion of educational facilities, the leaders of the [[Baath Party]] and indeed much of Iraq's urban middle class were able to move from rural or urban lower-class origins to middle and even top positions in the state apparatus, the public sector, and the society at large.

This social history is confirmed in the efforts of the government to generalize opportunities for basic education throughout the country. Between 1976 and 1986, the number of primary-school students increased 30 percent; female students increased 45 percent, from 35 to 44 percent of the total. The number of primary-school teachers increased 40 percent over this period. At the secondary level, the number of students increased by 46 percent, and the number of female students increased by 55 percent, from 29 to 36 percent of the total. Baghdad, which had about 29 percent of the population, had 26 percent of the primary students, 27 percent of the female primary students, and 32 percent of the secondary students.

Education was provided by the government through a centrally organized school system. In the early 1980s, the system included a six-year primary (or elementary) level known as the first level. The second level, also of six years, consisted of an intermediate-secondary and an intermediate-preparatory, each of three years. Graduates of these schools could enroll in a vocational school, one of the teacher training schools or institutes, or one of the various colleges, universities, or technical institutes.

The number of students enrolled in primary and secondary schools was highest in the central region and lowest in the north, although the enrollment of the northern schools was only slightly lower than that of the south. Before the war, the government had made considerable gains in lessening the extreme concentration of primary and secondary educational facilities in the main cities, notably Baghdad. Vocational education, which had been notoriously inadequate in Iraq, received considerable official attention in the 1980s. The number of students in technical fields had increased threefold since 1977, to over 120,090 in 1986.

The Baath regime also seemed to have made progress since the late 1960s in reducing regional disparities, although they were far from eliminated and no doubt was more severe than statistics would suggest. Baghdad, for example, was the home of most educational facilities above the secondary level, since it was the site not only of [[Baghdad University]], which in the academic year 1983–84 (the most recent year for which statistics were available in early 1988) had 34,555 students, but also of the Foundation of Technical Institutes with 34,277 students, Mustansiriya University with 11,686 students, and the University of Technology with 7,384 students. The universities in [[Basra]], [[Mosul]], and [[Erbil]], taken together, enrolled 26 percent of all students in higher education in the academic year 1983–84.

The number of students seeking to pursue higher education in the 1980s increased dramatically. Accordingly, in the mid-1980s the government made plans to expand [[Salahaddin University]] in Erbil in the north and to establish [[Ar Rashid University|Ar-Rashid University]] outside [[Baghdad]]. The latter was not yet in existence in early 1988 but both were designed ultimately to accommodate 50,000 students. In addition, at the end of December 1987, the government announced plans to create four more universities: one in [[Tikrit]] in the central area, one each at [[Al Kufah]] and [[Al-Qādisiyyah Governorate|Al Qadisiyah]] in the south, and one at [[Al Anbar]] in the west. Details of these universities were not known.

With the outbreak of the war, the government faced a difficult dilemma regarding education. Despite the shortage of wartime manpower, the regime was unwilling to tap the pool of available university students, arguing that these young people were Iraq's hope for the future. As of early 1988, therefore, the government routinely exempted students from military service until graduation, a policy it adhered to rigorously.

== Challenges &amp; problems per the current conditions of education in Iraq ==
There is currently an insufficient supply of schools, and most schools suffer from poor conditions.

* Gap of 3590 schools in 2003 result in double or triple shifts in school buildings
* About 70% of schools lack clean water and latrines
* Almost 1000 schools are built from mud, straw, or tents
* Poor quality of inputs includes: science labs, libraries, equipment, an outdated curriculum, lack of teacher training and food sources, and staff absenteeism
* Centralized Administration
* Insufficient jobs for university graduates, and falling [[academic standards]] in many universities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Adnan Abu Zeed| title =Bogus university graduates clog Iraqi job market| publisher =Al-Monitor| date =February 2015| url =http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/02/iraq-universities-higher-degrees-rise-unemployment.html#| accessdate = 24 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003 and the fall of the dictatorial regime, the war on Saddam Hussein and sectarian conflict has further destabilized the education system in Iraq.

* 2751 schools were damaged severely and require rehabilitation.  2400 schools experienced looting.
* Schools in dangerous areas were forced to close for extended periods
* Education personals were targeted, kidnapped, attacked, and or killed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Jim|author2=Celeste Riendeau |author3=Jessica Rosen |title=Lessons in Academic Rescue: An International Higher Education Response in Post-war Iraq|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|date=16 September 2013|volume=2|issue=3|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2013/lessons-in-academic-rescue}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Teacher absenteeism and that of girls reached a high level, due to the security threat
*Bombings in Baghdad claim lives of 16 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-16696341 | work=BBC News | title=Iraq unrest: Car bombs rock Baghdad Shia districts | date=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the bombing at Samar’a in 2006, displacement of both teachers and students has been another factor in the destabilization of the system.
* ~320,000 students are displaced [200,000 internally]
* ~65% of the displaced are males.  Girls tend to drop out.
* ~20,000 teachers are displaced
* Internal migration patterns vary, which places a burden on the system as it cannot deal with changing demands
* External displacement is located mostly in Jordan (where the students are absorbed into the system, with fees paid by the MOE in Iraq), Syria (where the students continue forward with the Iraqi education system and testing), and Egypt

== Current resources devoted to education in Iraq ==
[[Image:Education in Iraq - one laptop per child.jpg|thumb|[[One Laptop per Child]] in Najmi, [[Al Muthanna Governorate]]]]
Since May 2003, international agencies have been involved in supporting education in Iraq, but fragmented data has not allowed these numbers to be integrated into the governmental budget.  The UN [~US$80 million] and World Bank&lt;ref&gt;World Bank External Website, Iraq, Project Status Sheets &lt;www.worldbank.org&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; have two trust funds that go to help Iraq specifically, while USAID has contracts through the US Supplemental Budget for Iraq.  Although these programs are a great beginning, they do not reach the level as assessed by the October 2003 UN/WB Needs Assessment Study, $4.8 billion.

Current Projects financed by the Iraq Trust Fund, include but are not limited to:

* Emergency Textbook Provision Project: [US$40million].  Since May 2004, the project is intended to finance and distribute 69 million textbooks for 6 million students spread across all of the governorates for the 2004/05 year.
* Emergency School Construction Rehabilitation Project: [US$60million].  Since October 2004, the project is meant to construct 55 school buildings and rehabilitate 133 schools.  The rehabilitation of 133 schools is complete, at an average cost of US$181 per student, and benefits 45,000 pupils while creating 3,000 construction jobs.
* Emergency School Construction Rehabilitation Project- Supplemental Grant for Marshland Schools: [US$6million].  Since October 2006, the grant provides additional funding for the Emergency School Construction and Rehabilitation Project to construct ~33 new schools in the Marshland areas of Iraq.  This would go to benefit between 6,000 and 8,000 children in that region, and create near-term employment opportunities within construction.  Local stakeholders are involved (i.e. NGOs).
* Third Emergency Education Project [US$100million]: The funds are from the International Development Agency [IDA], in collaboration with the World Bank.  This project is in progress (updated July 2008) and aims to develop a national school construction and maintenance program as well as offer capacity building activities.
* A distance learning via satellite television project is underway with UN agencies to produce programs for displaced persons, total $US5 million [not part of the Iraq Trust Fund]

== Current actions ==

Despite endless daily challenges, the education system in Iraq continues to function.  Actions thus far include but are not limited to :

* 3600 schools rehabilitated
* 120,000 teachers recruited
* Focus on girls education
* Curriculum Reform
* Provision of Learning Resources
* Distance learning programs for out of school children (i.e. in Syria)
* Organizational chart reform
* Increasing collaboration with External partners

[[Image:FER.logo.jpg|thumb|200px|Official logo]]
The '''Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing''' ({{lang-hr|Fakultet elektrotehnike i računarstva}}, [[Abbreviation|abbr]]: ''FER'') is a [[faculty (division)|faculty]] of the [[University of Zagreb]]. It is the largest technical faculty and the leading educational as well as research-and-development institution in the fields of [[electrical engineering and computing]] in [[Croatia]].

FER owns four buildings situated in the [[Zagreb]] neighbourhood of Martinovka, [[Trnje]]. The total area of the site is {{convert|43308|m2|abbr=on}}. {{As of|2011}}, the Faculty employs more than 160 professors and 210 teaching and research assistants. In the academic year 2010/2011, the total number of students was about 3,800 in the undergraduate and graduate level, and about 450 in the PhD program.&lt;ref name="progressreport"&gt;[http://www.fer.unizg.hr/_download/repository/FER_-_Progress_Report_2009_-_2011.pdf FER Progress Report 2009-2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of school year 2004/2005, when the implementation of the [[Bologna process]] started at the University of Zagreb, the faculty has two [[baccalaureus]] programmes (each lasting 3 years):&lt;ref name="preddiplomski"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/education/bsc_study | title = About undergraduate (BSc) study programmes at FER | publisher = FER | accessdate = 2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Electrical engineering]] and [[information technology]]
* [[Computer science|Computing]]
After receiving a [[Baccalaureus|bachelor's degree]], students can take part in one of three master's programmes:&lt;ref name="diplomski"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/education/msc_study | title = About master's programmes on FER | publisher = FER | accessdate = 2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Information and [[communication technology]]
* Computing

==Organisation==
[[Image:FER Zagreb.jpg|thumb|360px|Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing's [[Modernist architecture|Modernist style]] Building C tower (built 1956), and Building B.]]
The Faculty comprises 12 [[academic department]]s:
* Applied Physics
* Applied Computing
* Applied Mathematics
* Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering and Measurements
* Electric Machines, Drives and Automation
* Power Systems
* Telecommunications
* Electronic Systems and Information Processing
* Control and Computer Engineering in Automation
* Electroacoustics
* Electronics, Microelectronics, Computer and Intelligent Systems
* Radiocommunications and Microwave Engineering

==History==
The Faculty of Electrical Engineering ({{lang-hr|Elektrotehnički fakultet}}, [[Abbreviation|abbr]]: ''ETF'') was formed on 1 July 1956 when the College of Engineering of the University of Zagreb was divided into ETF and three other new faculties. The faculty existed under this name until 7 February 1995 when it was renamed to its current name.

In 1956, the first curriculum was formed, offering students programme called "Study of Electrical Engineering". The faculty was divided into two departments, one for weak [[electric current|current]] (''Odjel za slabu struju'') and another for the strong current (''Odjel za jaku struju''). This was later referred to as the ETF-1 programme. The Faculty changed its curriculum in 1967, when the ETF-2 curriculum introduced a division of studies into electrical power systems, electronics, electrical machinery and automation. In 1970, the ETF-3 curriculum introduced further specializations, such as nuclear power systems and computing. There was also an ETF-4 curriculum later.

In 1994 name of the faculty changed, and the curriculum was changed from ETF-4 to FER-1. A separate study called "Study of Computing" was formed, so the faculty from then on offered two different degrees - one was the existing ''diplomirani inženjer elektrotehnike'', or [[engineer's degree|graduate engineer]] of electrical engineering, and the new one was ''diplomirani inženjer računarstva'', or [[engineer's degree|graduate engineer]] of computing. In 2004 FER-1 was transformed to FER-2, to conform to the [[Bologna process]]. This involved, among other things, changing the length of the essential course set from four semesters to two semesters, the renaming of the first study program to include the term [[information technology]], and the reworking of the program subdivisions so that they each include five specialized modules.

'''''Faith School Menace?''''' is a television documentary presented by [[Richard Dawkins]] which explores the effects of [[faith school]]s on the students in them and society in general by taking examples in particular from UK faith schools, with the stated aim ''"to explore the balance of rights between a parent's right to educate a child in their own faith, and the children's rights to determine their own beliefs and approach the world with a genuinely open mind"''.&lt;ref name=Scotsman&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/tv-review-faith-schools-menace-1-821648 |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |date=19 August 2010 |title=TV review: Faith Schools Menace?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of broadcast, one third of British schools had some kind of religious affiliation.&lt;ref name=Scotsman/&gt;  Dawkins was refused entry to [[Catholic school|Catholic]] and [[Jewish day school|Jewish]] faith schools, but was allowed to film in a [[Muslim school]], where children were taught what the theory of [[evolution]] was, but that it was not true.&lt;ref name=Indy&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/last-nights-tv-faith-schools-menacemore-4-2056104.html |first=Tom |last=Sutcliffe |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=19 August 2010 |title=Last Night's TV: Faith Schools Menace?/More 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Georg Baur''' (1859–1898) was a [[Vertebrate paleontology|vertebrate paleontologist]] and [[Lamarckism|Neo-Lamarckian]] who studied [[reptile|reptiles]] of the [[Galapagos Islands]], particularly the [[Galápagos tortoise|Galápagos tortoises]], in the 1890s. He is perhaps best known for his subsidence theory of the origin of the Galapagos Islands, where he postulated the islands were the remains of a former landmass, connected to South America via Cocos Island. 

==Early Life &amp; Education==
Baur was born in [[Weisswasser]], [[Bohemia]] in 1859. He spent his early years [[Hohenheim]] near [[Stuttgart]]. As his father was a professor of [[forestry]], Baur initially planned to study forestry. where his father was a professor of forestry. However, while at university he became interested in the fields of [[geology]], [[paleontology]], and [[botany]] instead.&lt;ref name="jstor-global-plants" /&gt;

==Career==
Prior to his work on the Galapagos Islands, Baur was an assistant to [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] at Yale University from 1884 until 1890.&lt;ref name="king-of-the-dino-hunters"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dingus |first1=Lowell |title=King of the Dinosaur Hunters : the life of John Bell Hatcher and the discoveries that shaped paleontology. |date=2018 |publisher=Pegasus Books |isbn=9781681778655}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|104-105}} Baur undertook an expedition to the Galápagos Islands in 1891, leaving New York on May 1, arriving in the Galápagos on June 9, and departing the islands on August 26 for Guayaquil, Panama, and the return to New York. Baur named several [[subspecies of Galápagos tortoise]], including ''Chelonoidis nigra guentheri'' (Baur, 1889), and ''Chelonoidis nigra galapagoensis'' (Baur, 1889).

'''Henry Moyes''' (c1750 – 1807) was a blind Scottish lecturer on [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;A. D. Morrison-Low, ‘[[Moyes, Henry]] (1749/50–1807)’, [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], [[Oxford University Press]], Sept 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

As an itinerant public speaker he helped raise 18th century popular interest in the new field of [[chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;''Some aspects of the history of education in analytical chemistry: published syllabi and their authors, Shaw (1734), Watson (1771), Moyes (1784, 1786) and Sullivan (1856)'' ; [[Fresenius' Journal of Analytical Chemistry]] ; Springer Berlin / Heidelberg; ISSN 0937-0633 (Print) 1432-1130; Issue Volume 347, Numbers 1-2 / January, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; He mixed with the greatest engineers and scientists of the day&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; and attended the [[Lunar Society]].

He came from a humble [[Kirkcaldy]] background and was [[Blindness|blinded]] aged three by [[smallpox]]. In 1766 he was befriended by [[Adam Smith]], when the [[Adam Smith#Later years and writings|latter was in Kirkcaldy]] writing his [[Wealth of Nations]]. The boy showed precocious aptitude and, as well as teaching Moyes himself, Smith secured the patronage of [[David Hume]] and [[Thomas Reid]] in the young man's education.&lt;ref&gt;''Dr [[James Currie (physician)|James Currie]] to [[Thomas Creevey]]'', 24 February 1793, Lpool RO, Currie MS 920 CUR&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hobo Day''' is the homecoming celebration for [[South Dakota State University]]. It is usually celebrated in October. 2012 marked the 100th Anniversary of Hobo Day. Hobo Day has been canceled just twice: once during World War I and a second time in 1942 during World War II.

== Origin of Hobo Day ==

The origin of Hobo Day can be traced back to 1907. A sequence of events occurred that spurred the homecoming celebration that is celebrated today.

In the fall of 1907, SDSU (then South Dakota State College) played Dakota Wesleyan at home in [[Brookings, South Dakota]]. The students, hungry for a win, participated in a "Nightshirt Parade" to stir up enthusiasm for the upcoming game. The men dressed in their nightshirts and women dressed in sheets. The students continued the tradition every homecoming day until in 1911, when the college administration deemed it undignified and un-ladylike for women to dress up in sheets and wander the streets. As a result, the homecoming tradition was ended and a new one needed to form. 

A student by the name of R. Adams Dutcher brought up a concept he had seen attempted at the [[University of Missouri]] that had students dress up as hobos and bums that was ultimately dropped from their homecoming celebrations for various reasons. Without a real event to partake in during homecoming, the concept took wing with much enthusiasm from the student body.&lt;ref&gt;Dunkle 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Hobo Day occurred November 2, 1912. The men were to grow beards for approximately one month and the women were to dress as Indian maidens on Hobo Day. After all the preparation was complete, the entire student body participating in Hobo Day journeyed to the train station to meet the opposing football team. According to the student newspaper, "The onlooker could not have told whether he was in an 1849 Indian village or a Twentieth Century division point on the Northwestern railroad." The new homecoming celebration was a huge success and is still currently in place.

== Parade ==

The Hobo Day parade also included floats built by students that drove down the main street. During the 1940s and 50s, the floats were described as "enormous and spectacular." Due to safety concerns and collapsing floats due to their enormous size, the floats were built smaller and to more manageable proportions. One particular float that caused a sharp decline in float building was a large elaborate float that had an outhouse on the back containing a student with his pants around his ankles on the toilet. After several newspapers in the region declared SDSU students as "vulgar," the college shied away from obscene and large floats. 

The parade is led by a notable alumni or dignitary selected as grand marshal by the Grand Pooba, who is the head of the Hobo Day Committee.

== Bummobile ==

The parade is ended by the Grand Pooba riding through on the historic Bummobile with the rest of the Hobo Day Committee. For seven decades, the Bummobile has led the Hobo Day Parade past the Campanile along Medary Avenue. Otherwise, with the exception of a select number of summer parades and SDSU events, the 1912 Ford Model T remains displayed in a large glass encasing in the Hobo Day Gallery, a Hobo Day showcase room in the SDSU University Student Union, built in 2010. The year of the Bummobile (1912) is significant because it marks the celebration of the first Hobo Day. The Bummobile has been the lead entry in every Hobo Day parade since 1938, with the exception of 1942, when Hobo Day and classes were canceled so students could help with the World War II effort. The Bummobile was donated in 1938 by Frank Weigel, a farmer from Flandreau, S.D. The Model T has shepherded homecoming grand poobas, parade grand marshals and U.S. president-elect, Dwight D. Eisenhower. 

Former Grand Pooba Sara French said a series of problems has arisen in recent years. The Bummobile has started on fire; a tire has fallen off and the brakes have given out. The car had to be pushed through the parade route in 2006. That has prompted French and the Hobo Day Committee to launch an effort to repair and restore the Bummobile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdsufoundation.org/s/1109/sdsu.aspx?sid=1109&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=961&amp;sparam=hobo%20day&amp;scontid=0 Help Save the Bummobile!]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the Bummobile was shipped off to California for a whole year to be restored and repaired, and ever since it runs with minimal problems.5 

== Hobo Day riots ==

In 1990, students and people in Brookings for the event grew agitated after a cold, damp week and created what came to be known at the Hobo Day Riots.

People poured from house parties and congregated at areas on and off campus. A bonfire was started and when a KSFY news vehicle from the Sioux Falls station arrived with a crew to cover the rowdy celebration, students went from jumping over the fire and showing off for the camera to rocking and eventually overturning the station wagon.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hobo Days-Kickin' Country|url=http://kikn.com/tags/hobo-days/|website=kikn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parade barricades were burned, light poles and street signs damaged and an SDSU campus police car was vandalized. Nine men were eventually charged with offenses and Hobo Day's future was in question, according to university officials.

Large house parties were banned and the Hobo Day Committee apologized.

== Current Hobo Day events ==

The events throughout the week, named Hobo Week, are facilitated by South Dakota State University's Hobo Day Committee (HDC). One of 17 coordinators selected to be on the HDC is the Grand Pooba. The Grand Pooba is in charge of selecting and maintaining a committee of students to plan, promote, and execute Hobo Week and Hobo Day. 

'''Hobo Gear Prep Night:''' Students are invited to buy donated clothes for cheap prices to turn into their Hobo Gear, or bring their clothes are buy patches, buttons, and accessories to amp up their outfits. 

'''One Month Club:''' Males grow their beards out and females grow out their leg hair the month leading up to Hobo Day. Men's categories include longest, fullest, patchiest and best attempt. Women's categories include longest, softest and roughest. 

'''Six Month Club:''' Males grow their beards out and females grow out their leg hair for SIX months leading up to Hobo Day (April-October). 

'''Paint the Town:''' Various businesses in Brookings volunteer to have their windows  painted, each team is assigned a window to paint and a winner is chosen based on creativity, theme, and school spirit. 

'''Rally at the Rails:''' This glorified pep fest takes place in downtown Brookings and features a live band, food, dancing, games, and other entertainment for students and community members to kick off Hobo Week in style. 

'''Bum-A-Meal''' Students sign up to participate in a meal one evening of the Hobo week. When they arrive for the event, they are given an address and go to eat at a home in the Brookings community. 

'''Bumfire:''' Traditionally, the Thursday night before the game, students flock out to the "Backyard" for a large bonfire. The local fire department has a large presence at this event! A concert often occurs before or after the bonfire. 

'''Hobolympics:''' Teams from various campus organizations and residence halls compete in a variety of "hobo" athletics.

'''Residence Hall Lobby Decorating:''' Each of the residence halls on campus decorate their lobby, usually in full glory. 

'''Cavorts Talent Show:''' The student talent show takes place the Friday night before Hobo Day. Cavorts, which often sells out in advance, is held in the Performing Arts Center (PAC). The acts performing go through an audition process much earlier in the semester and are selected to perform in the show by student leaders. Once chosen, the acts compete for cash prizes at the actual event. Popular faculty and staff are often chosen to judge acts based on various attributes. In 2010, an audience-voted Fan Favorite prize was introduced to accompany the traditional judge-voted first, second, and third place prizes. 

'''Hobo Day 5k:''' The morning of Hobo Day, there is a 5k sponsored by the local running group, [http://www.prairiestriders.net/ Prairie Striders].

== Hobo Day Gallery==

The Bummobile is the inspiration for the Hobo Day Gallery located in the northwest corner of the Student Union.

The fully restored Bummobile is the centerpiece of the gallery which includes other Hobo Day memorabilia. The Hobo Day Committee helped develop the vision for the Hobo Day Gallery, which serves as a living gallery for students, alumni and visitors to reconnect and to share time-honored traditions of the past. The Class of 1958 took a leadership role in private fundraising for the project and an anonymous member of the Class of 1958 pledged $75,000 as a challenge match to spur donations.  

In Fall 2011, a sculpture of Hobo Day icon Weary Wil with his ever-faithful dog, Spot, following him, was erected outside the north entrance to the University Student Union, near the glass windows showcasing the Bummobile in the Hobo Day Gallery. Following suit in 2013, a statue of Dirty Lil with her kitten Mittens was installed.

Norway’s '''home economics schools''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Husmorskoler''), or '''technical schools for domestic arts''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''fagskoler i husstell'') arose at the end of the 19th century for the purpose of providing specialized instruction in domestic subjects. The schools developed in parallel with agricultural schools ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''[[landbruksskole]]r'') and were intended to teach [[outline of food preparation|food preparation]] and housework. Later these home economics schools were also established in Norway's cities. The schools in the countryside were generally governed by [[Counties of Norway|county councils]] ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''fylkeskommuner'') and town schools by municipal governments.

In the 1960s the home economics schools were renamed as technical schools for domestic arts (''fagskoler i husstell''). The schools weren’t regulated by law before the [[Secondary education law (Norway)|secondary education law]] (''Lov om videregående opplæring'') came into effect in 1974. The home economics schools then became a part of the secondary education program, on an equal footing with [[Gymnasium_(school)#North_European_countries|gymnasiums]] (university preparation schools) and [[professional school (Norway)|practical and professional school]]s (''yrkeskoler'') specializing in business and technical programs. Following the 1976 secondary education law, the gymnasiums were consolidated with the practical and professional schools into a unified secondary education system. Nowadays instruction in restaurant work, food and nutrition is offered as a program discipline within Norway's overall secondary education program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1957">The '''International Congress on Mathematical Education''' (ICME) is held every four years under the auspices of the [[International Commission on Mathematical Instruction]] (ICMI) of the [[International Mathematical Union]] (IMU).

The Congress is planned and organized by separate committees, which operate independently of the ICMI. The aim of the Congress is to present the current states and trends in mathematics education research and in the practice of mathematics teaching at all levels.
The Congress will gather a broad spectrum of participants such as researchers in mathematics education, teacher trainers, practicing teachers, mathematicians, and others interested in mathematics education. The scientific program typically consists of plenary activities, regular lectures, survey teams, topic study groups, discussion groups, workshops, poster presentations, national presentations, etc. The regular lectures are held by experienced researchers or educators who have been invited, whereas most of the other activities are open for registration.

'''Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities''', based in [[Jerusalem]], was established in 1961 by the [[Israel|State of Israel]] to foster contact between Israeli scholars in the [[science]]s and [[humanities]] and  create a think tank for advising  the government on research projects of national importance. Its members include many of Israel's most distinguished scholars.&lt;ref name=stem&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.stemcellforum.org/about_the_iscf/members/israel_academy_of_sciences_and_humanities.cfm  | title=About the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities International Stem Cell Forum | website=StemCellForum.org | accessdate=August 16, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offices of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities are located next door to the official residence of the [[President of Israel]] and the [[Council for Higher Education in Israel]] in [[Albert Einstein Square (Jerusalem)|Albert Einstein Square]] in [[Jerusalem]].

In the sciences, the Academy funds projects on the [[geology]], [[Flora (plants)|flora]], and [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]] of Israel, and facilitates the participation of Israeli scientists in research at international projects, such as high-energy physics at [[CERN]] and [[synchrotron]] radiation at the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]].&lt;ref name=ministry&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/5/Israel%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20and%20Humanities "Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, May 24, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; Israel has the highest concentration of scientists and engineers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Business/Business-News/Israel-leads-world-in-per-capita-scientists-and-engineers Israel leads world in per capita scientists and engineers], ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', 12 may 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The academy funds a number of prestigious awards in the sciences including the [[Alon Prize]].

In the humanities, research is funded into the study of the [[Tanakh]] and [[Talmud]], [[Jewish history]], [[Jewish philosophy]], Jewish art, and the [[Hebrew language]], as well as Hebrew prose and [[Hebrew and Jewish epic poetry|poetry]].&lt;ref name=ministry/&gt;

The Academy administers the [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] Fellowships fund, which fosters relations between scientists from around the world and the Israeli academic community, the [[Israel Science Fund]], with an annual budget of $53 million, and a number of research funds based on grants from the [[Adler Fund for Space Research]], the [[Wolf Foundation]], and the [[Fulks Fund for Medical Research]]. The Academy also runs the [[Israel Academic Center]] in [[Cairo]], which assists Israeli scholars with research into [[Egypt]] and [[Egyptian culture]], and facilitates cooperation with Egyptian academics.

The Academy has observer status at the [[European Science Foundation]], and runs exchange programs with the British [[Royal Society]], the [[British Academy]], the [[Swedish Academy]], and the National Research Council of [[Singapore]].

==History==
[[File:Partial view of campus.jpg|thumb|Partial view of campus]]
[[File:Classroom Interaction.jpg|thumb|Classroom Interaction]]

=== 1954 ===
The institution was originally formed in 1954 as an international boarding school called École des Roches, located in Switzerland's Canton of Valais region.

=== 1979 ===
École des Roches evolved to become the Les Roches Hotel &amp; Tourism School and was recognized as the first hotel management school in Switzerland to offer its courses in English.

=== 1995-1996 ===
In 1995, the Les Roches Hotel and Tourism School founded their first international campus located in Marbella, Spain and under the name Swiss School of Hotel Management and Tourism in Spain. In 1996 the university inaugurated its current campus and soon thereafter became known as the Les Roches Marbella International School of Hotel Management.

=== 2003 ===
In 2003, the school became a member institution of Laureate International Universities, a private international network of degree-granting post-secondary institutions located around the world. During its time under the leadership Laureate International Universities, Les Roches Global Hospitality Education formed part of the organization's 75 accredited universities in 29 countries. 
[[File:Les Roches Marbella Logo.png|thumb|221x221px]]

=== 2004 ===
Les Roches Global Hospitality Education became the first school in Spain to receive institutional accreditation from the [[New England Association of Schools &amp; Colleges]] (NEASC) in the United States. NEASC is one of six regional accrediting associations recognized by the U.S. Department of Education.

Also in 2004, the campus continued its expansion with the addition of a new academic wing, an a la carte restaurant and adjoining kitchen operation, as well as doubling its on campus residence capacity and recreational areas.

=== 2010-2013 ===
In 2010 and again in 2013, the University was voted by the hospitality industry as the number one school in Spain for preparing students for an international career in hospitality management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2011/02/10/andalucia_malaga/1297341823.html|title = La escuela Le Roches elegida la más prestigiosa en formación hotelera|date =2011-02-10|accessdate = |website = El Mundo|publisher = El Mundo|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hoteliermiddleeast.com/15073-top-10-hotel-management-schools-in-the-world/6/|title = Top 10 Hotel Management Schools in the World|date = 2012-09-05|accessdate = |website = Hotelier Middle East|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.laopinioncoruna.es/empresas-en-coruna/2014/06/20/carlos-diez-lastra-director-general/853305.html|title = Carlos Díez de la Lastra, Director General de Les Roches Marbella, afirma que Dirigir un hotel es como dirigir una orquesta|date = 2014-06-21|accessdate = |website = La Opinion A Coruña|publisher = La Opinion|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.europapress.es/turismo/hoteles/noticia-escuela-hotelera-les-roches-marbella-mas-prestigiosa-espana-formacion-20140131112930.html|title = La escuela hotelera Les Roches Marbella, la más prestigiosa de España en formación|date = 2014-01-01|accessdate = |website = Europa Press Turismo|publisher = Europa Press|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the conclusion of a broad industry survey among hiring managers from international hospitality companies around the world. The research was conducted by [[Taylor Nelson Sofres]] (TNS) Travel &amp; Tourism (U.K.), the world’s largest provider of custom research and analysis. The primary purpose of this survey was to establish the relative ‘ranking’ of the various hospitality management schools who provide university-level programmes in Spain and from which international hospitality companies are likely to recruit staff.

=== 2016 ===
In 2016, the Les Roches network of campuses worldwide was acquired by Sommet Education

==Academic structure==
[[File:Academics at Les Roches Marbella.jpg|thumb|Academic Classroom at Les Roches Marbella]]
[[File:cblLRM.jpg|thumb|alt=Les Roches Marbella International School of Hotel Management Experiential Learning|Les Roches Marbella International School of Hotel Management Craft Based Learning]]
The university teaches undergraduate and postgraduate degree programs that specialize in international hospitality management. Undergraduate courses focus on developing advanced business management skills in hotel, restaurant, and service industry operations. The school places emphasis on combining core academic knowledge with hands-on experiential learning as the basis for its educational model. This is achieved by combining traditional classroom learning with purpose-built learning facilities that are designed to simulate a real world hotel environment. During the first two years of the undergraduate course students alternate weekly between craft-based learning classes in the school's simulated facilities and core business-related lecture subjects taught in the classroom. The postgraduate academic structure is identical in nature to the undergraduate program's, however the curriculum involves an accelerated immersion into key areas that takes into consideration the students' previous educational and professional background. Additionally, as part of the undergraduate programs, students complete between two and three internships in international hotels and hospitality related organizations. The postgraduate degree requires one internship semester to complete the program.

=== Academic programs ===
'''Les Roches Hotel Management Diploma''' (3 years)

The traditional Swiss hotel management diploma is devised to provide degree holders a fast-track access to entry-level employment after completing an alternation of three semesters of academic study at the school, and three semesters professional supervised internships. Coursework focuses on administration, management, marketing, culinary arts, and guest relations. Students who complete the six semester program can choose to exit and receive the Les Roches Hotel Management Diploma or continue studying towards a bachelor's degree within the institution.

'''[[Bachelor of Business Administration]]'''''' in International Hotel Management '''(3.5 years)

Initially this internationally accredited&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://cihe.neasc.org/about-our-institutions/roster/les-roches-international-school-hotel-management|title = NEASC Commission on Institutions of Higher Education:  Accreditation Roster.|date = |accessdate = |website = New England Association of Schools and Colleges|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; program follows the same curriculum as the Les Roches Hotel Management Diploma, but includes two additional academic semesters and a total of two internships semesters in place of three. During the final year of the BBA degree program, students have the option to study a specialization in Strategic [[Human Resources]] Management, [[Entrepreneurship]] with Small &amp; Medium Enterprise Management, [[Events management|Events Management]] or [[Resort management|Resort Management]].

Upon completion of the two preliminary semesters students are directly admitted into the full BBA program curriculum.

'''Postgraduate Intensive Diploma in International Hotel Management'''

The university's postgraduate course is designed for students of diverse professional backgrounds. This is a professional one-year program that provides an intensive academic semester covering hotel operations, administration and general business courses. It is designed for people who already have a university degree or diploma and would like to redirect their careers into the international hospitality industry. Integrated into the program is operational management and craft-based training in culinary arts, food &amp; beverage as well as rooms division. The program culminates with a second semester that includes a management training internship in international hospitality establishments.

==== Postgraduate Diploma in Marketing Management for Luxury Tourism ====
This Postgraduate program in Marketing Management for Luxury Tourism is designed for graduates and professionals wishing to fast track their career in marketing management for the hospitality industry. The program aims to provide the expert knowledge and perspective required by professionals and directors in the global and dynamic environment of tourism by understanding the impact of new technologies and new trends.

==== Postgraduate Executive Diploma in International Hotel Management ====

===Internships===

Internships in hotels and other hospitality/tourism organizations are core to the university's educational system. They believe that, together with academic semesters, alternating periods of practical training in the field prepares students to comprehend real-world circumstances and gain professional experience well in advance of earning a degree.

In addition there are 400 more students carrying out professional internships in hotels in Spain and abroad throughout the academic year.

=== International Transfer Program ===
As a branch campus of Les Roches Global Hospitality Education, the school offers international transfer opportunities to branch campuses located in Spain, Switzerland, China, and the United States. In 2014 the institution broadened their program offer by providing students the option of an international transfer program and the opportunity to earn two degrees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17172">A '''masters degree in quantitative finance''' concerns the application of [[List of mathematics-based methods|mathematical methods]] to the solution of problems in [[financial economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/financial_mathematics/content/02_financial/02.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130222949/http://math.nyu.edu/financial_mathematics/content/02_financial/02.html |archivedate=2012-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several like-titled degrees which may further focus on [[financial engineering]], [[financial risk management]], [[computational finance]] and/or [[mathematical finance]]. 

In general, these degrees aim to prepare students for roles as "quants" ([[quantitative analyst]]s), including [[quantitative analyst|analysis]], [[Investment banking#Organizational structure|structuring]], [[trader (finance)|trading]], and [[investment management|investing]]; in particular, these degrees emphasize [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and [[fixed income]], and the [[hedge (finance)|hedging]] and [[financial risk management|management]] of the resultant [[market risk|market]] and [[credit risk]]. 

Formal [[masters degree|masters-level]] training in [[quantitative finance]] has existed since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ederman.com/media/risk-job_market.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The program is usually one to one and a half years in duration, and may include a [[thesis]] component.   Entrance requirements are generally [[multivariable calculus]], [[linear algebra]], [[differential equation]]s and some exposure to [[computer programming]] (usually [[C++]]);&lt;ref name="iafe.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iafe.org/resources_faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604121801/http://www.iafe.org/resources_faq.html |archivedate=2008-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; programs emphasizing [[financial mathematics]] may require some background in [[measure theory]].

The [[curriculum]] builds quantitative skills, and simultaneously develops the underlying finance theory:

*The quantitative component draws on [[applied mathematics]], [[computer science]] and  [[statistical modelling]], and emphasizes [[stochastic calculus]], [[Numerical analysis|numerical methods]] and [[Monte Carlo methods in finance|simulation techniques]];&lt;ref name="nyu.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/financial_mathematics/content/02_financial/02 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602123448/http://www.math.nyu.edu/financial_mathematics/content/02_financial/02 |archivedate=2008-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; some programs also focus on [[econometrics]] / [[time series analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cefims.ac.uk/cgi-bin/programmes.cgi?func=programme&amp;id=42|title=MSc Finance (Quantitative Finance) - Centre for Financial and Management Studies - SOAS University of London|website=www.cefims.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.few.eur.nl/few//index.cfm/site/Erasmus%20School%20of%20Economics/pageid/730795C2-C036-5AA1-D277EA76AEDFF510/index.cfm]&lt;/ref&gt;{{linkspam|date=January 2011}} See [[Outline of finance #Mathematical tools]].

*The theory component usually includes a formal study of [[financial economics]], addressing  [[asset pricing]] and [[financial markets]]; some programs may also include general coverage of [[economics]], [[accounting]], [[corporate finance]] and [[Investment management|portfolio management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iafe.org/resources_core.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822064537/http://www.iafe.org/resources_core.html |archivedate=2006-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/financial-engineering-ms/curriculum|title=Curriculum - Financial Engineering, MS|website=NYU Tandon School of Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The components are then integrated, addressing the [[mathematical modelling|modelling]], [[Valuation of options|valuation]] and [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] of [[equity derivative]]s, [[Commodity market#Derivatives|commodity derivatives]], [[foreign exchange derivative]]s, and [[Fixed income|fixed income instrument]]s and their related [[credit derivative|credit-]] and [[interest rate derivative]]s. Some programs also cover quantitative [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] [[Investment management|management]] and [[Portfolio optimization|-optimization]] [http://www.math.columbia.edu/~greyser/CUcourse.html][http://computational-finance.uw.edu/academics/courses/#543][http://maths.york.ac.uk/www/node/12166][http://www.bu.edu/questrom/degree-programs/ms-in-mathematical-finance/curriculum/][https://web.archive.org/web/20150507131007/http://www.stevens.edu/sit/graduate/financial_engineering.cfm]. See [[Outline of finance #Derivatives pricing]]

The title of the degree will depend on emphasis,&lt;ref name="nyu.edu"/&gt; the major differences between programs being the curriculum's distribution between mathematical theory, quantitative techniques and financial applications.&lt;ref name="iafe.org"/&gt;{{linkspam|date=January 2011}} The more theoretically oriented degrees are usually termed "[[Master of Mathematical Finance|Masters in Mathematical Finance]]" or "[[Master of Financial Mathematics|Masters in Financial Mathematics]]" while those oriented toward practice are termed "[[Master of Financial Engineering|Masters in Financial Engineering]]" (MFE or MSFE), "[[Master of Computational Finance|Masters in Computational Finance]]" (MCF or MSCF), or sometimes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/bcf/graduate/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/academic/mfin/|title=Enroll in a Top Master of Finance Program - MFin - MIT Sloan School of Management|website=mitsloan.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; simply "[[Master of Finance|Masters in Finance]]" (MFin). "Masters in Quantitative Finance" is the more general degree title, although "MQF" degrees are often less theoretical and more practical. The practice oriented programs are often positioned as [[professional degree]]s (and in the [[United States]], are sometimes offered as [[Professional Science Masters]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemasters.com/PSMProgramList/ProgramsbyField/tabid/81/Default.aspx#Math]&lt;/ref&gt;). Programs are sometimes offered as a [[Master of Engineering]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie/academics/master/index.cfm|title=Master of Engineering - School of Operations Research and Information Engineering - Cornell Engineering|website=www.orie.cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a Master of [[Operations Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieor.columbia.edu/ms-financial-engineering|title=MS in Financial Engineering|website=ieor.columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msc.maths.ed.ac.uk/or/programme/finance|title=Operational Research MSc Programmes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other qualifications==
The program differs from a [[Master of Science in Finance]] (MSF), and an [[Master of Business Administration#Content|MBA in finance]], in that these degrees aim to produce finance generalists as opposed to "quants", and therefore focus on [[corporate finance]], [[accounting]], [[equity valuation]] and [[Investment management|portfolio management]]. The treatment of any common topics—usually "[[derivative (finance)|derivatives]]", [[financial modeling]], and [[financial risk management|risk management]]—will be less (or even non) technical. Entrance requirements are similarly less mathematical. Note that [[Master of Finance]] (M.Fin.) and MSc. in Finance degrees, as distinct from the MSF, may be substantially similar to the MQF.

There is some overlap with degrees in [[actuarial science]],&lt;ref name="nuigalway.ie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/ecn/ugrad/fme-details/actuary-details.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610022703/http://www.nuigalway.ie/ecn/ugrad/fme-details/actuary-details.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{linkspam|date=January 2011}} and both degrees are occasionally offered by the same department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poly.edu/academics/programs/financial-engineering-ms/curriculum|title=Curriculum - Financial Engineering, MS|website=NYU Tandon School of Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the programs are almost always separate and distinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.wits.ac.za/NR/rdonlyres/C8C5074B-17A9-49E3-BFCA-B03D3C3236E2/0/MathematicalFinanceSA.doc]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, whereas actuarial programs cover risk and uncertainty as applied to [[pension]]s, [[insurance]] and [[investment]]s, quantitative finance programs are broader (although offer less depth in these areas), and prepare graduates for various of the highly numerate roles in finance&lt;ref name="nuigalway.ie"/&gt; and for other areas that require "quants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ederman.com/new/docs/risk-job_market.pdf|title=Emanuel Derman|first=Emanuel|last=Derman|website=www.ederman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is similarly overlap with a [[Master of Financial Economics]], although the emphasis is very different. That degree focuses on [[Financial Economics|the underlying economics]], and on developing and testing theoretical models, and aims to prepare graduates for [[research]] based roles and for [[doctoral]] study.  The curriculum therefore emphasises coverage of financial theory, and of [[econometrics]], while the treatment of model ''implementation'' (through mathematical modeling and programming), while important, is secondary. Entrance requirements are similarly less mathematical.  Some Financial Economics degrees are substantially quantitative, and are largely akin to the MQF.

For students whose interests in finance are commercial rather than [[academic]], a Masters in Quantitative Finance may be seen as an alternative to a [[PhD]] in finance. At the same time though, "Masters in Mathematical Finance" programs are often positioned as providing a basis for [[doctorate|doctoral study]].

==History==
The first quantitative finance masters programs in the US were offered by [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in 1990, under Dr. [[Michael Ong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riskltd.com/MichaelOngBio.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;{{linkspam|date=January 2011}} (The programs offered were the "Masters of Science in Quantitative Finance" and "Masters of Science in Financial Markets and Trading", and were combined in 2008 to become the "Masters of Science in Finance, with Financial Engineering Concentration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuart.iit.edu/graduateprograms/ms/finance/concentrations/financial_engineering.shtml|title=Master of Science in Finance - IIT Stuart School of Business|website=www.stuart.iit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The [[NYU-Poly]] Financial Engineering degree was the second program of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poly.edu/academics/departments/finance/overview|title=Finance and Risk Engineering|website=NYU Tandon School of Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carnegie Mellon]] introduced its "Masters of Computational Finance" program in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tepper.cmu.edu/master-in-computational-finance/the-mscf-program/index.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[OGI School of Science and Engineering|OGI]]'s Computational Finance Program (1996, now discontinued) was the first such program based in a [[computer science]] department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~moody/#teaching]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mst.ogi.edu/news/S03_Newsletter.html#CF]&lt;/ref&gt; Other pioneering programs include those at [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|NYU's Courant Institute]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[UCLA]] and [[MIT]]. 

Subsequent growth in the number and location of programs has paralleled the growth of [[financial engineering]]—with its growing importance across all aspects of the financial services industries—and of [[risk management]] as [[profession]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fenews.com/fen54/spec-report/capstone/capstone.html|title=FEN Special Report: 2007 Survey of Worldwide Graduate Education Programs in Financial Engineering, Mathematical Finance, Computational/Quantitative Finance and Risk Management|date=23 March 2008|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323081319/http://www.fenews.com/fen54/spec-report/capstone/capstone.html|archivedate=23 March 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Programs are now widely offered internationally—see links below—and in some cases are available [[online education|online]] or via [[distance education]]  (e.g. [[University of Washington|Washington]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://depts.washington.edu/compfin/content/welcome-computational-finance-risk-management |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222000806/http://depts.washington.edu/compfin/content/welcome-computational-finance-risk-management |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of York|York]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maths.york.ac.uk/www/onlinemscmathfin|title=Mathematics - Mathematics, The University of York|website=maths.york.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stevens Institute of Technology|Stevens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcampus.stevens.edu/masters.aspx|title=StevensOnline|website=Stevens Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Southern California|USC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gapp.usc.edu/graduate-programs/masters/financial-engineering/financial-engineering|title=MS in Financial Engineering - USC Viterbi - Prospective Students|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National University of Singapore|NUS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/nusbulletin/faculty-science/master-science-financial-engineering-part-time-full-time-or-distance-learning |title=nus.edu.sg (Archived copy) |accessdate=2015-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007073437/http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/nusbulletin/faculty-science/master-science-financial-engineering-part-time-full-time-or-distance-learning |archivedate=2015-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Mitraniketan ''Vishwavidyapeetam for Open Learning &amp; Total Development''''' is a Non-Governmental organization  located at Vellanad, which is 25&amp;nbsp;km away from Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala state in South India.It is a 500 member community, including a staff of 100 men and women. Mitraniketan works in the fields of  innovation, training and extension in community development, environment, science, education and appropriate technology. The project was begun with a view to offering education and training in a holistic spirit to primarily socially underprivileged children and youngsters. The organization focuses on alternative education mode for development.

==History==
Mitraniketan was founded by [[Padma Shri|Padmashri]] [[Mitraniketan Viswanathan|K.Viswanathan]] in 1956 in his native village.He graduated from Visva Bharati University, Santiniketan (W.B.), studied educational development in USA and Scandinavia, and in the process was inspired to launch the Mitraniketan project, "The Home of Friends", in Sanskrit the word 'Mitra' means Friends 'Niketan' means Home. In 1950s Vellanad was a remote village and there was only one government institution at Vellanad that was Government High School. He started his work by providing supplementary education for the students of nearby schools after school hours. Those class were very informal since  he aimed for a total development in children. As it became a huge success he converted it into a  Malayalam medium school. Now it known as the ''Mitraniketan Vikas Bhavan School''(Primary &amp; Secondary).The greatest challenge he faced at that time was the scarcity of students for a regular schooling. Parents of neighboring children were not ready to send their children for an experiment. but Viswanathan was not ready to loose is faith, he moved some northern districts of Kerala where there are huge number of tribal population. He met them, talked with them, stayed with them.. at last they came forward to send their children with him.Mitraniketan Vikasbhavan school is not a regular school, it aims for developing active citizenship among the students by developing their innate potentials.

'''''Obrazovanye''''' ({{lang-ru|Образование}}, Education)  was a Russian literary and educational magazine, published in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1892–1909, a continuation of an earlier publication called ''Zhenskoye obrazovanye'' (Women's Education, 1876–1891). It was edited originally by [[Vasily Sipovsky]], who in 1896 was succeeded by Alexander Ostrogorsky.&lt;ref name="lit"/&gt;

In 1902 the literary section appeared in the magazine. Among the authors published by ''Obrazovaniye'' were [[Vikenty Veresayev]], [[Aleksey Chapygin]], [[Evgeny Chirikov]], [[Semyon Yushkevich]], [[Sergei Sergeyev-Tsensky]], [[Mikhail Artsybashev]], [[Anastasiya Verbitskaya]] and later [[Alexander Blok]], [[Konstantin Balmont]], [[Ivan Rukavishnikov]], [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]], [[Zinaida Gippius]].

In the early 1900s the journal, part of the Russian leftist press, published the works by such [[Bolshevik]] authors as Vladimir Frische, [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Mikhail Olminsky]], [[Vatslav Vorovsky]] (using the pseudonym P. Orlovsky) and [[Vladimir Lenin]] (fragments of "The Agrarian Questions and the Critics of Marx" appeared in the 1906, No.2 issue of ''Obrazovanye'').

After the [[1905 Revolution]] the magazine drifted to the center right, turned against both Lenin and Gorky, and the Bolshevik fraction advised its members to sever all ties with it.&lt;ref name="lit"&gt;[http://feb-web.ru/feb/kle/kle-abc/ke5/ke5-3691.htm  Образование] at the Brief Literary Encyclopedia (Краткая литературная энциклопедия, КЛЭ)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otus''' is an [[educational technology]] company providing a [[learning management system]], [[data warehouse]] and many [[classroom management|classroom management tools]] for [[K-12 School|K-12]] students, teachers, parents, and administrators. Otus was nominated as a finalist of two 2016 [[Software and Information Industry Association#CODiE Awards|Codie award]]s in the "Best Classroom Management System" and "Best K-12 Course or Learning Management Solution" categories.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siia.net/codie/2016-Finalists&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prweb.com/releases/Otus/2016CodieFinalist/prweb13322162.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Otus was a finalist in EdTech Digest's 2016 "District Data Solution" and "[[Learning Management System]]" categories.&lt;ref&gt;https://edtechdigest.wordpress.com/2016/03/15/2016-finalists/&lt;/ref&gt; Otus co-founder Chris Hull was also recently announced as one of the [[National School Boards Association|National School Boards Association's]] "20 to Watch Educators for 2016".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nsba.org/newsroom/press-releases/national-school-boards-association-names-%E2%80%9C20-watch%E2%80%9D-education-technology&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 2012 by Chris Hull and Pete Helfers, two social studies teachers at Illinois' [[North Shore School District 112|Elm Place Middle School]], Otus was designed to replicate the ideal K-12 classroom experience that the two teachers envisioned.&lt;ref&gt;http://otus.com/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving a grant to bring [[One to one computing (education)|1:1 computing iPads]] to their students, both quickly recognized the limitless potential that classroom management tools offer, but were disappointed with the effectiveness of the current apps on the market.&lt;ref&gt;http://otus.com/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that they could do better, Chris and Pete started to develop Otus while continuing to work their respective teaching jobs, their end-goal being to create an all in one classroom management system integrating everything necessary to run a classroom.&lt;ref&gt;http://chicagoinno.streetwise.co/2015/07/31/edtech-management-platform-otus-expands-to-district-level/&lt;/ref&gt; After reaching out to Chicago-based hedge fund manager Andy Bluhm, who provided them with $2M in funding, Otus was officially launched in August, 2014 and has grown domestically and internationally since.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140826/BLOGS11/140829888/andrew-bluhm-makes-leap-from-hedge-fund-to-ipads&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 10, 2016, Otus owns the trademark phrase "Student Performance Platform." &lt;ref&gt;https://trademarks.justia.com/868/19/student-performance-86819392.html&lt;/ref&gt; Otus has recently partnered with NWEA to become a MAP (Measures of Academic Progress) Authorized Data Partner. Starting Fall 2016, all users of Otus will be able to see and take advantage of MAP data directly in the Otus platform.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prweb.com/releases/Otus/NWEA/prweb13500963.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
Otus competes with other learning management systems such as [[Edmodo]], [[Blackboard Learn]], [[Schoology]], [[Moodle]] and [[Instructure|Canvas by Instructure]] to provide educational tools on a district and school wide basis. Otus in particular aims to offer "everything a mobile classroom could possibly need for both teachers and students"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edtechroundup.org/reviews/otus-the-complete-mobile-learning-environment-for-the-k-12-classroom&lt;/ref&gt; and does so by providing attendance tracking, a digital bookshelf for uploading files, in-app annotations, assignments, papers, polls, blogs, quizzes, and more. Otus integrates third-party apps, such as [[Khan Academy]], [[PARCC]], and many more through their "toolbox" program. Everything a student does through the Otus platform is integrated into a [[deep learning]] program called "analytics" on the Otus app, which complies information from all first and third-party apps and creates a student profile easily accessible by teachers and parents at the teacher's discretion. Otus is freely available for use by students, teachers, and parents, but requires a subscription fee for district administrators.&lt;ref&gt;http://chicagoinno.streetwise.co/2015/07/31/edtech-management-platform-otus-expands-to-district-level/&lt;/ref&gt; Otus is available on [[iOS]] for teachers and students, and the web for all users.&lt;ref&gt;http://otus.com/announcing-otus-on-any-device/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''People for Legal and Non-Sectarian Schools''' ('''PLANS''') is an organization based in [[California]] in the [[United States]] which campaigns against the public funding of [[Waldorf Schools|Waldorf]] methods [[charter schools]] alleging they violate the [[United States Constitution]]'s separation of church and state. The group claims independent Waldorf schools and public Waldorf methods charter schools teach [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] content, that this content is religious in nature, and that the schools disguise the anthroposophical content from the public.  PLANS filed federal suit in 1998 against two California public school districts, [[Sacramento City Unified School District]] and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, to halt the Waldorf methods educational programs implemented in two of their schools. The case was ultimately dismissed on its merits in 2012.

The group was founded in 1995 and became a California non-profit corporation in 1997. Its founding officers, president Debra Snell and secretary [[Dan Dugan (audio engineer)|Dan Dugan]] are former Waldorf school parents.  The organization numbered less than 50 members when the lawsuit was brought.&lt;ref&gt;Deposition testimony by Debra Snell, PLANS vs SCUSD, TRESD 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission statement ==

The group describes its mission as to

# "Provide parents, teachers, and school boards with views of Waldorf education from outside the cult of Rudolf Steiner."
# "Expose the illegality of public funding for Waldorf school programs in the US."
# "Litigate against schools violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment in the US."

== PLANS lawsuit ==

In February 1998, PLANS filed suit against two California public school districts, [[Sacramento City Unified School District]] and [[Twin Ridges Elementary School District]], operating Waldorf-methods schools; one operating a Waldorf-based [[charter school]] and the other operating a Waldorf-based [[magnet school]]. In the complaint, PLANS argued that it was "informed and believes that a primary purpose and primary effect of said operation of Waldorf schools is to advance religion, including the religious doctrines of [[Anthroposophy]]", and as such were acting in violation of the [[1st Amendment|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]] of the [[United States Constitution]] and Article IX of the [[California Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief", PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, filed U.S. District Court Eastern District of California No. Civ. S 98-266, filed 2/11/98&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to PLANS' 1999 Motion for Summary Judgement, the Court ruled against their contention that the primary purpose of the program in those schools was to advance religion, finding that the two school districts targeted have a secular, non-religious purpose for implementing Waldorf teaching methods in their schools, but allowed the case to proceed on the second question, whether a primary effect of the programs may be the [[unintended consequence]] of endorsing any religion to an extent that violates the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;"Memorandum and Order", dated 9/24/99, PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, filed U.S. District Court Eastern District of California No. Civ. S 98-266.  As to "primary purpose", see p18 section "i. Secular Purpose", "The question is whether the school districts can articulate any secular purpose for adopting the Waldorf teaching method....PLANS concedes that the school districts have done so, and presents no relevant evidence casting doubt on those articulations." As to "primary effect", see p19 section "ii. Primary Effect", "PLANS has raised a disputed issue of material fact concerning the religious underpinnings of Waldorf education and whether public funding of Waldorf education has the unintended consequence of advancing Anthroposophy."(p22)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Case dismissed on its merits ===

The trial was scheduled on September 12, 2005, and was expected to run for 16 days. The presiding judge determined two issues to be decided in the trial. The first issue was to determine if anthroposophy is a religion for Establishment Clause purposes - the defendants contended it was not. The second issue, which required first an affirmative ruling that anthroposophy is a religion for Establishment Clause purposes, would decide whether the public schools in those two districts were promoting anthroposophy to an extent that violated the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;"Third Amended Pretrial Conference Order" dated 4/19/2005, PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, filed U.S. District Court Eastern District of California No. Civ. S 98-266.  p15, "A bench trial is scheduled for September 12, 2005.  The estimated length of trial is sixteen days."  p14, "XVI:Separate Trial of Issues: Trial shall be bifurcated.  Trial solely on the issue of whether anthroposophy is a religion shall precede trial of all remaining issues.  Trial of remaining issues, if necessary, will immediately follow trial solely on the issue of whether anthroposophy is a religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial convened as scheduled, but ended in 30 minutes after PLANS failed in their legal burden to present an [[proffer|offer of proof (proffer)]] of evidence sufficient to prove anthroposophy was a religion. PLANS' attorney told the court PLANS could not meet its [[Legal burden of proof|burden]], and that as a result of earlier evidentiary rulings before the court, it could furnish no witnesses at trial to testify anthroposophy was a religion.&lt;ref&gt;"Transcript of Court Trial" held 9/12/05 before Judge Frank C. Damrell, Jr., PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, filed U.S. District Court Eastern District of California No. Civ. S 98-266.  Transcript notes trial commenced at 1:30 p.m. and concluded 2:01 pm. Quotes from transcripts, (The Court): "The Court indicated the issue of whether anthroposophy is a religion for establishment causes is indeed the threshold issue.  I have reviewed the trial briefs of the parties, I have looked at the exhibit list and the witness list, and in doing so, as I indicated in the past, I'm going to require a proffer, Mr. Kendall, on that issue."  (Mr. Kendall):"The only witnesses that we would have been able to offer with regard to this question of anthroposophy--I worked on alternative ways of doing it--would be [named].  You've excluded both of those on the grounds I did not disclose them.  I don't think that's the case, but that is the Court's order.  Without those witnesses, I don't believe we'll be able to sustain our burden of proof." (The Court): Then you have no proffer; that's what you're telling me?" (Mr. Kendall): "That's what I'm telling you."  See also [[proffer]].&lt;/ref&gt; PLANS did attempt to introduce one piece of [[documentary evidence]] on the religion issue.  Arguments were heard, but no evidence was presented during the trial. The court ruled that PLANS failed its evidentiary [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]], and ordered the case be [[on the merits|dismissed on the merits]].&lt;ref&gt;"Findings of Fact and Conclusion of Law", "5. At the trial on September 12, 2005, the court required Plaintiff to make an offer of proof as to how it would prove that anthroposophy is a religion for Establishment Clause purposes given its limited exhibits and witnesses. 6. Plaintiff's counsel first stated that he had "no proffer" based on the court's prior ruling...7. Plaintiff's counsel then stated that he had one item of evidence to support Plaintiff's case that anthroposophy is a religion, namely, Plaintiff's Exhibit 89...11. Plaintiff did not proffer any further exhibits or witnesses on the issue of whether anthroposophy is a religion for Establishment Clause purposes. 12. Plaintiff rested its case on the threshold issue of whether anthroposophy is a religion...B. Conclusions of Law: 1. Plaintiff failed to carry its evidentiary burden of establishing that anthroposophy is a religion for purposes of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the [constitution].  2.  Plaintiff's only proffered evidence, Exhibit 89, is inadmissible for a variety of reasons.  Plaintiff did not offer any foundation to support admissibility of the Exhibit[], nor did Plaintiff authenticate the Exhibit[].  Moreover, the Exhibit is rank hearsay and is not an "adoptive admission" under the exception to the hearsay rule...IT IS ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Plaintiff take nothing, that the action be dismissed on the merits, and that Defendants recover their costs."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decision is appealed ===

PLANS filed a notice of appeal of the decision in November, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;"United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Civil Appeals Docketing Statement", PLANS, Inc., Plaintiff-Appellant v Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District, USCA Docket # 05-17193&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal claims that the earlier rulings preventing PLANS from calling two defense expert witnesses for their own [[wiktionary:in chief|case-in-chief]] left them no witnesses able to give evidence that anthroposophy was a religion.&lt;ref&gt;"Appleant's Opening Brief" {{sic}}, filed 3/13/2006, United States Court of Appeals For the Ninth Circuit, PLANS, Inc. v Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District, # 05-17193, "The case was bifurcated with the matter of whether or not Anthroposophy was a religion to be tried first.  All of the witnesses PLANS intended to use for this part of the trial had been excluded by the court, and PLANS could not proceed."&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier rulings resulted from pretrial motions submitted six months prior to trial.  The two witnesses PLANS wished to call were first disclosed by the defendants as witnesses against PLANS in the case.&lt;ref&gt;"Amended Pretrial Conference Order", dated 3/16/206, PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, # 05-17193, p10, "Plaintiff will not be permitted to call defendant's designated expert witnesses or defendants' previously-designated expert witnesses."&lt;/ref&gt; PLANS argues in the appeal that an [[Discovery (law)#Rule 26. General Provisions Governing Discovery.3B Duty of Disclosure|automatic disclosure rule]] cited by the judge, though in effect at the time of trial in 2005, was not in effect in 1998 when the case was filed, and claims the witnesses were fully disclosed under the applicable rules.&lt;ref&gt;"Appleant's Opening Brief" {{sic}}, filed 3/13/2006, United States Court of Appeals For the Ninth Circuit, PLANS, Inc. v Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District,  # 05-17193, "No party ever disclosed under Rule 26, as this case originated in 1997['''sic'''], when the Eastern District had opted out of Rule 26.  All of the discovery in this case, by all parties, had been conducted through propounded discovery--depositions, interrogatories, admissions, request for production of documents."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Case again dismissed on its merits ===
In November 2010, the judge in the case dismissed it on its merits a second time. With the exception of one item, the [[Bylaws]] of the [[Anthroposophical Society]], all of the plaintiff's evidence was either withdrawn before trial or excluded at trial as inadmissible hearsay. The plaintiff called one percipient witness, not friendly to their cause, and no expert witnesses. In his ruling, the judge cited the plaintiff's attempts to elicit from a percipient witness testimony only allowable from an expert witness, and their "complete failure to present percipient testimony relevant to the essential issues in the case" as already sufficient basis for an adverse judgment. He added, however, that aside from the plaintiff's effective failure to present a viable case, "the evidence suggests that anthroposophy is a method of learning which is available to anyone regardless of their religious or philosophical persuasion. Stated another way, anthroposophy is more akin to a methodology or approach to learning as opposed to a religious doctrine or organized set of beliefs." The judge concluded by giving a detailed analysis on the basis of a number of determining factors why anthroposophy should not be judged a religion for [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= PLANS, Inc. v.

=== Case history ===

After its first ruling in 1999, the U.S. District Court—Eastern District of California has issued key rulings on the case in 2001, 2004 and 2005:

* In 2001, the Court dismissed the case. A legal precedent set earlier in a similar case in New York, though not related to Waldorf education, led the Court to find that PLANS lacked grounds to claim [[taxpayer standing]] in the case. After an appeal by PLANS, the US 9th Circuit Appellate Court in February 2003 reversed the decision on taxpayer standing by the lower court, allowing the case to proceed towards trial.&lt;ref&gt;"Appelles' Brief", filed 4/26/2006, PLANS, Inc. Plaintiff and Appellant v Sacramento City Unified School District; Twin Ridges Elementary School District" United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit #05-17193 p5, "On April 6, 2001, School Districts filed a Notice of New Authority citing Altman v Bedford Central Sch. Dist[] based on School Districts' continued belief that PLANS did not have proper taxpayer standing.[]The district court then ordered additional briefing on the question of taxpayer standing.[]As a result, and based on the new authority, the district court entered judgement in favor of School Districts based on PLANS' lack of taxpayer standing. PLANS appealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit, claiming that it had taxpayer standing because it alleged the entire curriculum at the schools were inherently religious and thus were akin to a publicly funded Catholic charter school.[]The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's ruling on standing on the basis of the analogy comparing Waldorf methods schools to hypothetical publicly funded Catholic charter schools."&lt;/ref&gt;
* In May 2004, PLANS filed a motion for summary judgment, or, in the alternative, summary adjudication, requesting that the Court rule that anthroposophy is a religion, based on material presented by PLANS.&lt;ref&gt;"Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgement, or, in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication" dated 6/25/2004, filed 5/28/2004, PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, filed U.S. District Court Eastern District of California No. Civ. S 98-266, p1 "Notice is given that on June 25, 2004, or as soon thereafter as counsel may be heard by the above entitled court, plaintiff will and hereby does move the court for summary judgement on the ground that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgement as a matter of law for the reason that, as a matter of law, Anthroposophy is a religion for constitutional purposes under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and that, based on the undisputed material facts and admissions of defendant's employees, the use of the term Waldorf by defendants, the training of teachers at Anthroposophical institutions at public expense, the admitted relationship between Anthroposophy and Waldorf education, the conduct of spiritual events by teachers, and/or curriculum decision s based upon Anthroposophical principles, each independently, and together, create an impermissible advancement of religion and/or excessive entanglement between government and religion.  Plaintiff, therefore, prays for summary judgement and that this court grant its request for a permanent injunction, enjoining the operation of public Waldorf schools, or Waldorf methods schools.  In the alternative, plaintiff prays for summary adjudication on the issue of whether or not Anthroposophy is a religion for the purposes of constitutional analysis under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution."&lt;/ref&gt; But the Court did not accept these arguments, and on 15 November 2004 denied the motion, stating that "triable issues of material fact exist as to whether Anthroposophy is a religion". The Court also provided a new opportunity for both sides to declare witnesses and evidence, with a deadline of January 2005 for disclosure of these.&lt;ref&gt;"Memorandum and Order" dated 11/15/2004, PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, filed U.S. District Court Eastern District of California No. Civ. S 98-266, p5 "In order for PLANS to successfully move for summary judgement in this matter, PLANS must prove it is entitled to judgement as a matter of law on two related issues: (1) whether anthroposophy constitutes a "religion" for Establishment Clause purposes; and (2) if anthroposophy is a religion, whether there is anthroposophical curriculum at the two public Waldorf-method schools at issue, thereby constituting a violation of the Establishment Clause.  PLANS has failed to demonstrate that there exists genuine issue as to any material fact on both matters." p9, Conclusion: Triable issues of material fact exist as to whether anthroposophy is a religion, as well as whether the Waldorf method of education implemented at John Morse and Yuba River advances and promotes anthroposophy.  Therefore, PLANS's motion for summary judgment is DENIED"&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2005, the Court issued an order outlining the trial issues and the evidentiary and procedural guidelines for the trial, scheduled for September 12, 2005. The court separated the issues, stating that it would be first necessary to try the question of whether anthroposophy was a religion, and secondly, whether anthroposophy was present in the schools. The order denied PLANS eleven witnesses, for failure by its attorney to make timely disclosure to Defendants, and 105 of PLANS' exhibits, as a result of discovery sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;"Third Amended Pretrial Conference Order" dated 4/19/2005, PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, filed U.S. District Court Eastern District of California No. Civ. S 98-266. p14, "Trial shall be bifurcated.  Trial solely on the issue of whether anthroposophy is a religion shall precede trial of all remaining issues.  Trial of remaining issues, if necessary, will immediately follow trial solely on the issue of whether anthroposophy is a religion." p5, "Defendants' Motion In Limine No. 11: The court granted, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c), defendants' motion to exclude trial witnesses listed by plaintiff who were not disclosed to defendants during discovery.  The following witnesses are excluded from testifying: [11 named].  Defendants' Motion in Limine No 12: The court granted defendants' motion to exclude exhibits listed by plaintiff that were not disclosed to defendants pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c).

* In June, 2009, PLANS' lawyer for the case tendered his "resignation with disciplinary charges pending" from the California Bar;&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.calbar.ca.gov/search/member_detail.aspx?x=166156 California Bar record of disciplinary charges]&lt;/ref&gt; previous disciplinary charges in 2007 and 2008 had cited willful violations of the professional code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.calbar.ca.gov/courtDocs/05-O-4079-1.pdf first disciplinary charges], [http://members.calbar.ca.gov/courtDocs/07-O-12385.pdf second disciplinary charges]&lt;/ref&gt;

* In November, 2010 the ruling on the second trial was published, with a finding against the plaintiff (PLANS) and for the defendants.

== History of the public activity of the group ==

PLANS secretary Dan Dugan delivered prepared presentations to various organizations and PLANS distributed packets of prepared print materials to school boards which were at the time considering adopting Waldorf methods in their districts.&lt;ref&gt;Background corporate statement dated 10-25-1999, application for IRS tax exemption.  One such presentation was delivered to the Sacramento Atheists and Other Freethinkers on Jun 9, 1996, and Sacramento Bee's Jan Ferris reported in "Will Summer Chill Waldorf Protests" (6/11/1997) that in Sacramento's John Morse Waldorf Methods School's otherwise peaceful first year, some objections to the school were made by Sacramento area atheists protesting the school's inclusion of Old Testament stories and cross-cultural creation myths.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dugan also established a webpage for the organization and moderated a public email discussion list, devoted to topics on the [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]] curriculum, anthroposophy, and to discussion related to the Waldorf schools.

In February 1996, Dugan delivered a slide presentation to the school board in Twin Ridges Elementary School District.  The district had been operating a Waldorf-methods charter school for two years.  In response to Dugan's presentations, a local committee formed, headed by Baptist pastor, James Morton, and members of the committee argued both in public meetings and through the local media outlets that the school's teachings were in conflict with the US constitution's provision regarding the separation of church and state.  Morton soon joined PLANS and took a place on its governing board.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Lauer, "Parents challenge NC charter school", The Union, Feb 27 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deposition of James Morton, PLANS, Inc vs Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District&lt;/ref&gt;

PLANS contacted the [[California Attorney General]] in March 1997, arguing for an investigation into Waldorf Methods public schools statewide, urging the officer to act immediately to end the funding of all such schools.

In April 1997, Dugan delivered arguments against the public funding of Waldorf methods education to a board meeting of the Yuba County Office of Education in Marysville, California.  The county operated two schools for juvenile offenders which were both engaged in an experimental project to develop a nationally-replicable Waldorf-based educational model.  Shortly after this meeting, PLANS set up a picket line at one of the Yuba County Waldorf-based schools.  One of the school's teachers joined the PLANS campaign and became Vice-President of their governing board.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Forward, "Group says teaching methods are religious", ''Appeal-Democrat'', Marysville, CA, May 15, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 1996, PLANS made its first contact with the Sacramento Unified School District to urge district officials there to discontinue their planned Waldorf methods magnet school program. Conversion to the new program was funded in its first two years by a $491,000 federal grant, much of it used to begin training the school's faculty in the Waldorf approach. The magnet program proceeded as planned, and Waldorf methods were adopted at the beginning of the 1996/97 school year at Oak Ridge Elementary School.  A parent survey conducted in the following spring indicated parents were mostly satisfied with this new teaching program.  Attendance improved and none of the enrolled students applied for transfer during the district's "open enrollment" period.  But 11 of the 26 teachers requested transfers from Oak Ridge School - half for personal reasons, and the rest objecting to the Waldorf teacher training or to its educational philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Defendant's response to Interrogatories, PLANS, Inc vs Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Will Summer Chill Waldorf Protests?", ''Sacramento Bee'', June 11, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 1997, PLANS officials distributed leaflets entitled, "Save Oak Ridge School From the Steiner Cult".

Parents formed a local committee called "Concerned Citizens for Oak Ridge School".  In May, news media reported that controversial statements had been made by parents during an Oak Ridge meeting, accusing the school of teaching the students about witchcraft, human sacrifices, and religious altars, and charging that the children were being initiated into a cult.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080108203216/http://dwb.sacbee.com/content/links/story/12266380p-13130448c.html School is teaching witchcraft, critics say] Sacramento Bee, May 16, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, PLANS held protests in front of the school, and picketers waved flags and anti-Waldorf signs, some demanding the termination of two staff members in the school.

In a newspaper interview in May, Dugan commented on the independent Waldorf school in Davis: "They believe that there are spirits behind everything. I know there are people who would call that evil. (They) would consider anthroposophy a satanic religion."&lt;ref&gt;California Aggie (Davis), 22 May 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  Dugan, described the educators as "misguided", not "evil".&lt;ref&gt;"Davis Primary School Answers Charges of Racism". Robert Shiu, The California Aggie, May 22, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1997, district officials voted unanimously to continue the Waldorf-methods magnet program, but to relocate it to another campus, John Morse Elementary.  PLANS sought legal assistance and found lawyer Scott Kendall, an attorney affiliated with the Christian evangelical legal organization, the Pacific Justice Institute (PJI).&lt;ref&gt;Debra Snell, "Dr. Morton's death a tragic loss", ''The Nevada City Union'' Aug 23, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The PJI applied for a grant on behalf of PLANS, seeking to raise funds from the evangelical [[Alliance Defense Fund|Alliance Defense Fund (ADF)]] to initiate PLANS' legal suit against public school districts operating Waldorf methods schools. The PJI application alleged the Sacramento school engaged in "Wicca"-based practices, religious proselytizing and coercion, and that a third of the parents had kept their children home from school in protest. A video copy of a local televised news report about the controversy accompanied the application.&lt;ref&gt;ALLIANCE DEFENSE FUND GRANT REQUEST APPLICATION, dated 18 July 1997, made on behalf of PLANS by Pacific Justice Institute and sent to [[Alliance Defense Fund|ADF]].&lt;/ref&gt;

ADF awarded a $15,000 grant in February 1998, and immediately after, PLANS filed suit against Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, demanding a permanent injunction against the implementation of the Waldorf-methods curriculum in the schools, as well as full reimbursement for all legal costs.  PLANS entered into a signed agreement with the Concerned Citizens for Oak Ridge School, promising the organization that in exchange for their efforts assisting PLANS in the lawsuit, PLANS would share one-fifth of any proceeds awarded in the event of a favorable judgement and "cost multiplier" fines imposed.&lt;ref&gt;Letter dated Aug 4, 1998, addressed to Tina Means, Concerned Parents of Oak Ridge School, signed by PLANS directors.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2000 PLANS hired a private detective to attend a voluntary Winter's Solstice celebration for kindergarten through third-graders that took place in the evening in a privately rented meeting hall.  The detective videotaped the ceremony. PLANS played the tape in a presentation to a school board in Chico, California, as evidence that Waldorf teaching methods are religious.&lt;ref&gt;David Ruenzel, "The Spirit of Waldorf Education", ''Education Week'' Vol. 20, Iss. 41 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ongoing challenges against the Waldorf methods public schools in other districts, PLANS pointedly referenced their pending lawsuit, warning that other districts too would face expensive legal challenges if they allowed Waldorf based methods in any of their schools.&lt;ref&gt;John Michael, "Critic of Waldorf education method urges Chico school board to reject the Blue Oak Charter School", ''Chico Enterprise-Record, Dec 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; PLANS' challenges against Waldorf methods charter schools in the Chico Unified and Ross Valley school districts resulted in the denial of pending charter school proposals there.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Isles Nation, "Waldorf-style school stirs controversy", ''Marin Independent Journal'', Aug 3, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross Valley School District board minutes dated Oct 1, 2002 and Oct 28, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Devanie Angel and Laura Smith, "Waldorf critics lose court battle", Chico News and Review, May 31, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the proponents of those charters soon reapplied in alternative districts nearby and both charters were accepted: the Blue Oaks Charter School, opened September 2001 under Chico's Butte County Office of Education, and the Waldorf-Inspired School of Lagunitas, opened September 2004 in the [[Lagunitas School District]].  Sacramento Unified, Twin Ridges Elementary, and Yuba County districts also continue to operate their Waldorf methods programs. Today, there are 19  public schools in California that have adopted the Waldorf methods.&lt;ref&gt;Debra Moon, "From Acorn to Seedling", ''Chico News and Review'', May 30, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Waldorf style school stirs controversy", ''Marin Independent Journal'', Aug 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Gale, "Lagunitas approves Waldorf school", ''Point Reyes Light'', Mar 25 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of PLANS ==

The Oak Ridge School in Sacramento became the target of threats and accusations that its teachers led children through witchcraft and sorcery practices in the classroom.  While neither of these accusations could be attributed to PLANS, school officials accused PLANS of playing to public prejudices and paranoia, and arousing anxieties in the community by presenting a distorted view of their teachings to the parents of the school, most of whom weren't English proficient.&lt;ref&gt;"Educators Spurn Witchcraft, Cult Allegations by Critics", Sacramento Bee, May 11, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  Local picketers who joined the PLANS protest against Oak Ridge credited the PLANS leaflets as the initial source of their concerns,&lt;ref&gt;"School is teaching witchcraft, critics say", Sacramento Bee May 16, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and the town's newspaper concurred, pointing to data from the school which indicated that since introducing Waldorf methods there had been positive impacts on absenteeism, voluntary re-enrollment, as well as overall parent satisfaction as measured shortly before PLANS' appearance at the school. The paper's editor accused PLANS of alarming parents with claims for which there was no evidence, including the suggestion that Waldorf methods were disguised witchcraft teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080108203204/http://dwb.sacbee.com/content/links/story/12266379p-13130444c.html Editorial: The attack on Oak Ridge] Sacramento Bee, June 10, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Public school officials in California's Marysville, Twin Ridges, Novato and Butte schools criticized PLANS as well; a principal in the Yuba County District, which was the target of PLANS' protests over their two Waldorf methods schools, expressed outrage over "the lies, the distortion of facts" when questioned by a reporter.&lt;ref&gt;"Will Summer Chill Waldorf Protests?", Sacramento Bee, June 11, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to the PLANS lawsuit, the Nevada County superintendent of schools characterized it as "despicable" to have to redirect moneys from teachers and curriculum to pay legal costs, and insisted there was no merit to PLANS' accusations.&lt;ref&gt;David Mirhadi, "Court revives lawsuit against charter school", ''The Union'', Feb 12 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The accuracy and expertise of PLANS officials also came under attack during lawsuit witness hearings.  Six of the PLANS board directors and advisors sought to testify as expert witnesses in the case, but each was eliminated due to their lack of expertise on the subjects of anthroposophy and Waldorf education: three were eliminated by the court judge, and the other three subsequently withdrawn voluntarily by PLANS' attorney, Kendall.  After reviewing key sections of the deposition testimony taken of PLANS' most vocal spokesperson, Dugan, the judge expressed "grave doubts about any reliance upon his opinions about anything that has to do with any intellectual endeavor, including anthroposophy" before ruling that Dugan would not be allowed to give testimony in the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Reporter's Transcript, PLANS, Inc. vs Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District, Apr 11, 2001 Document #95&lt;/ref&gt;

When PLANS succeeded in convincing board members in Ross Valley and Chico school districts to vote against proposed Waldorf methods charters there, both proposals were welcomed by other school districts nearby, allowing the new schools to go forward.,&lt;ref&gt;Devanie Angel, "County board's taste turns to Waldorf", ''Chico News and Review'', July 12, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Gale, "Lagunitas approves Waldorf school", ''Point Reyes Light'', Mar 25, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Local news commentators in one of the targeted communities castigated their local school district for caving to PLANS' threat of a lawsuit, and showcased the episode as one of the most notably "boneheaded or downright wrong things" of the past year.&lt;ref&gt;"What were they thinking?", Chico News &amp; Review, Dec 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anthroposophical Society|Anthroposophical Society in America (ASA)]], which is the legal representative of anthroposophy in the United States, has challenged PLANS over PLANS' characterizations of anthroposophy, as well as PLANS' suggestion that the anthroposophical movement has a direct interest or involvement in the growth of Waldorf teaching methods in the public schools.   These were two claims PLANS made in its May 28, 2004, "Motion for Summary Judgement".  Though not a direct party to the case, the ASA petitioned the court's permission to respond to this trial motion as a ''[[amicus curiae|friend of the court]]''.  The court granted ASA's petition and, in July 2004, the organization submitted an 18-page legal brief to the court challenging PLANS' assertions.&lt;ref&gt;"Amicus Curiae Brief of the Anthroposophical Society in America for the Defendants", PLANS, Inc., v Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District, July 13, 2004 Document #187&lt;/ref&gt;

== Argumentation by Waldorf methods charter schools and PLANS ==

Advocates of public Waldorf education claim that Waldorf methods (charter) schools should be able to receive public funding. PLANS claims that although Waldorf representatives often state that a public "Waldorf methods" program has been structured so as not to violate the U.S. Constitution, these schools nevertheless have religious underpinnings. Private Waldorf schools celebrate religious festivals and observe religious holidays, for instance. PLANS asserts that in public Waldorf methods schools these activities are not always avoided and are sometimes simply renamed. PLANS alleges that morning verses recited in the public school in which children thank the sun for its warmth are actually prayers, and claim that the sun is a metaphor Steiner used to refer to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080228014720/http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oid=oid:33641 Schooling the Imagination] Sacramento News and Review, February 03, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In public Waldorf methods schools in the U.S., "God" has been removed from the verse and replaced with "the Sun" to avoid violation of the U.S. Constitution. PLANS claims this is a cosmetic and not a substantive change.

PLANS also claims that not only private, but also public, Waldorf methods schools are anthroposophical institutions. According to PLANS, public Waldorf teachers are required in most cases to take Waldorf teacher training in which they are asked to read works almost exclusively by Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Waldorf education, the focus of which are Steiner's tenets of anthroposophy.

The two Waldorf methods public schools PLANS brought to court presented numerous witnesses and introduced documents which contradicted this claim.&lt;ref&gt;Court witness statements record numbers #174-181. Also defendant expert witness reports; "FRCP, Rule 26 Report of Dr. Douglas Sloan, Professor Emeritus, Teachers College, Columbia University" filed Sep 27, 2004, and expert witness report of Robert Anderson, Administrator of the Standards and Assessment Office of the California Department of Education, dated Jan 23, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The judge ruled that PLANS could not introduce evidence taken in the context of the private and independent Waldorf schools to argue their case against the public Waldorf-methods schools.  The court ruled that private schools are separate entities, and insisted evidence be limited to policies and practices in effect within the litigated public school districts.  The two schools furnished statements and documents in this case showing that the teachers in their Waldorf methods schools were held to the same state mandated training and credential requirements as the teachers in other public schools in those districts.  In response to a demand to prepare a complete list of all Waldorf-related documents and reading materials related to training or instruction in Waldorf teaching methods, neither school district identified a single text written by Rudolf Steiner. Betty Staley, the Rudolf Steiner College staff member who developed the public teacher training program, testified the college's ''1993-1994 Teacher Training Booklists'' did not apply to the public teacher training program, and that only one of the texts from the lists, Steiner's ''Philosophy of Freedom'', was used by the program.&lt;ref&gt;"Deposition of Betty Staley", PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District, d Apr 23 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In their trial case, PLANS did not repeat their claim that these or other texts by Steiner were required in the public Waldorf-methods teacher training.  However, they did claim that the schools "provide[d] books for its teachers that are filled with Anthroposophical doctrine", and that teachers were "hire[d] because of their Anthroposophical training."&lt;ref&gt;"Second Supplemental Answer to Special Interrogatories", PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District, Twin Ridges Elementary School District, Apr 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Staley's testimony, references to spirituality were eliminated from the public Waldorf teachers’ training materials to meet state standards. One teacher who had participated in this program before adopting Waldorf methods in her teaching in the Oak Ridge, and later John Morse schools, reported that Steiner’s philosophy was alluded to in her training and that teachers who wanted to learn more could pay for their own classes, but that most of her colleagues from Morse did not pursue any anthroposophical training in the course of becoming public Waldorf methods teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080228014720/http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oid=oid:33641 Schooled in spirituality] Article in Sacramento News and Reviews by Chrisanne Beckner, February 03, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

PLANS claims the basis of anthroposophy is esoteric Christianity.  In court documents, PLANS argued that Rudolf Steiner considered himself a Christian and that he considered anthroposophy to be a Christian form of theosophy and Rosicrucianism.  PLANS argued that Steiner himself described anthroposophy as a training to access skills of psychic awareness latent in each human being, and argued that the discipline "spiritual science" is not a true science nor philosophy, but a theology.  PLANS acknowledged that Steiner's supporters frequently concede the spiritual foundations of anthroposophy and Waldorf education, but claimed they make a false distinction between ''spiritual'' and ''religious''.  PLANS considered anthroposophy to be part of a New Age religious movement, characterized by its seekers' rejection of orthodoxy and creedal forms of religious expression in favor of a more eclectic and individualized path of spiritual-psychological transformation, a process which PLANS claimed to be generally acknowledged as "religious experience".&lt;ref&gt;Plaintiff's "Answer to Special Interrogatories", pages 3 and 4, (Jan 15, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

PLANS wanted the court to agree that Waldorf methods schools lead students through New Age rituals and interpret them as religious practices.  It also wanted the court to agree that in the schools, anthroposophy permeates every subject, and that the underlying theory of the education is based on theology, not philosophy.  In order to do this, PLANS first needed to convince the court that anthroposophy was a religion.  This attempt was unsuccessful, and PLANS seeks to reverse the decision in appeals court.

== Waldorf educators and public Waldorf methods education ==

Some supporters of Waldorf education have suggested that Waldorf education does not belong in government schools. Eugene Schwartz is a prominent teacher and author who has stated that he agreed with Dugan that Waldorf education could not properly be separated from anthroposophy. In Schwartz's view, although Waldorf education is not sectarian, the children are intended to have inwardly religious experiences. In his speech he exemplified this with the way the origin and history of the Jews is taught in grade three in independent Waldorf schools. Schwartz was fired from his position at a teaching college shortly after the speech, and in a later interview, claimed there were many other Waldorf teachers who agreed with him but were afraid to speak out. In Schwartz's opinion, Waldorf education has the goal of making "everything sacramental", and that "willing, feeling, and thinking" are "soul forces" which are intentionally brought to every aspect of the education. Schwartz objected to educators who would reject the movement's religious aspect to suit the requirements of public education. In the interview, Schwartz lamented the fact that, in his view, public Waldorf methods schools are watered-down imitations of authentic Waldorf education.&lt;ref&gt;David Ruenzel, "The Spirit of Waldorf Education", ''Education Week'' Vol. 20, Iss. 41 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwartz has since become an active promoter of Waldorf education in charter and public schools.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Schwartz, [http://www.sopdigitaledition.com/archive/commonground0310/#/56/ "Waldorf Education in the Twenty-First Century"]. ''Common Ground'' March 2010, pp.  54-56&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Finch Martineau''' (12 June 1755 – 2 December 1847) was an English businessman and a [[philanthropist]], with particular interest in improving the lives of disadvantaged people through education.

==Life and family==
A [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], he was born into the renowned [[Martineau family]] of [[Norwich]] and christened in the [[Octagon Chapel, Norwich|Octagon Chapel]]. His eldest brother Philip Meadows Martineau became a distinguished surgeon and his youngest brother Thomas fathered sociologist [[Harriet Martineau]] and religious philosopher [[James Martineau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Notes on the Pedigree of the Martineau Family|last=Martineau|first=D.|publisher=|year=1907|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineer [[John Martineau]] was another of Peter's nephews.

His first wife Susannah Scott had one son and his second marriage to Catherine Marsh brought him five more children, of whom Peter Martineau Jr was the oldest and Catherine Jr their first daughter – she married solicitor [[Edward Foss]]. Peter Jr wed Eliza Barnard and then Mary Anne, the sister of his schoolmate Sir [[Francis Ronalds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Jr and Mary Anne's children included Sarah, whose husband was brewer and benefactor [[Charles Edward Flower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sirfrancisronalds.co.uk/maryann.html|title=Mary Anne Martineau née Ronalds|website=Sir Francis Ronalds and his Family|access-date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter and Catherine were buried at [[West Norwood Cemetery]].

==Business interests==
Peter Finch Martineau was active in various distinct businesses through his life. He was first a [[dyeing|textile dyer]] in Norwich with his older brother David. He, David and their younger brother John then established a [[brewery]] at the King's Arms Stairs (one of the [[watermen's stairs]] on the [[Thames]]), which [[merged]] with [[Whitbread]] in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Brewing Industry in England 1700-1830|last=Mathias|first=P.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next followed a [[sugar refinery|sugar-refining]] partnership in Goulston Street, [[Whitechapel]] with his son Peter Jr, which continued until around the latter’s death in 1869;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mawer.clara.net/sugarmmac.html|title=Sugar Refiners &amp; Sugarbakers Database|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peter Jr [[patented]] an important new process for clarifying sugar in 1815 with his cousin [[John Martineau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Methods of Refining or Clarifying certain Vegetable Substances|last=Martineau|first=P. &amp; M.|date=8 May 1815|work=UK patent 3912|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Finch also opened a bank in [[St Albans]] after he moved there in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Peter Finch Martineau Esq|last=|first=|date=1848|work=Gentleman’s Magazine|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|volume=29, New Series|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unitarianism in Hertfordshire|last=Ruston|first=A.R.|publisher=|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family in addition invested in mining operations in Devon, Cornwall and overseas, managed by Peter Jr's second cousin [[John Taylor (civil engineer)|John Taylor]]. These included the Wheal Friendship mine at [[Mary Tavy]] and United Mines near [[Redruth]]. They also held Directorships in various Assurance companies: Peter Finch in the [[Hand in Hand Fire &amp; Life Insurance Society|Hand in Hand Fire Insurance Society]], and Peter Jr in the [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society|Equitable Assurance Office]] – he also served as auditor of the [[Phoenix Fire Office|Phoenix Fire Assurance Company]].&lt;ref name="Mart1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=February 2018|title=Peter Finch Martineau and his Son|url=|journal=The Martineau Society Newsletter|volume=41|pages=10-19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Education initiatives==
The Martineaus supported a wide range of targeted education initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Obituary, Peter Martineau|last=|first=|date=1870|work=The Inquirer|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|year=1870|volume=29|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Finch was an early Governor of the [[African Institution]], founded by [[abolitionists]] when they succeeded in making the British slave trade illegal. He helped establish the [[School for the Indigent Blind]] in 1800 and was still chairing its meetings nearly half a century later – the organisation continues today as SeeAbility. He was also a Governor of the [[Deaf education#Great Britain|London Asylum for the Support and Education of the Deaf and Dumb Children of the Poor]]; the House of Refuge for Orphan Girls; and the Refuge for the Destitute, which assisted people discharged from prison to enter the workforce. Finally, he served as Vice-President of the [[Harris Manchester College, Oxford|Manchester Academy]] [[Nonconformist]] higher education institution in [[York]] for nearly two decades.&lt;ref name="Mart1" /&gt; 

==Political activities== 
Like others in his family, Martineau was [[Whig Party (British political party)|Whig]] cum [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] in his politics. A friend of the political philosopher [[William Godwin]], he joined the London [[Revolution Society]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Obituary, Peter Finch Martineau|last=|first=|date=1848|work=Christian Reformer, or Unitarian Magazine and Review|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|volume=4, New Series|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was an energetic supporter of Norwich [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[William Smith (abolitionist)|William Smith]]. He later served as [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of [[Hertfordshire]]. Peter Jr played an active role in the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] from its beginnings in the late 1830s, where he chaired large meetings in the [[boroughs]] where he lived and worked to garner support for the removal of import [[Duty (economics)|duties]].&lt;ref name="Mart1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Anti-corn Law Association|last=|first=|date=23 February 1839|work=Hereford Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5747">'''Raymond Persinger''' (born 1959) is an American artist best known for his large [[bronze sculpture]]s and [[public art]] installations.  

Persinger has created sculptures for many public and private collections, including the City of [[Brea, California]], [[Chapman University]] and the [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] Museum.  His work has been selected for various exhibits by prominent curators, including [[Smithsonian Institution]] curator Dr. [[Virginia Mecklenburg]], curator and Los Angeles-based critic [[Peter Frank (art critic)|Peter Frank]], and [[LACMA]] curator [[Michele Urton]].{{cn|date=January 2013}}

He holds a bachelor's degree from [[California State University, Long Beach]], and a [[Master of Fine Arts]] (MFA) from [[California State University, Fullerton]].{{cn|date=January 2013}}

In 1986, Persinger began working at [[Dinamation]], where he created life-sized sculptures of dinosaurs, extinct mammals and sea creatures for use in museum exhibits and worked as project director and manager/art director of the sculpture department. He was credited for his claw structure theory in [[James Kirkland (paleontologist)|James Kirkland]]'s original paper on the dinosaur ''[[Utahraptor]]''.&lt;ref name="Kirkland93"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kirkland | first1 = J.I. | last2 = Burge | first2 = D. | last3 = Gaston | first3 = R. | year = 1993 | title = A large dromaeosaur [Theropoda] from the Lower Cretaceous of Utah | journal = Hunteria | volume = 2 | issue = 10| pages = 1–16 |url=https://www.academia.edu/225747/A_large_dromaeosaurid_Theropoda_from_the_Lower_Cretaceous_of_Eastern_Utah}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left [[Dinamation]] in 1996.{{cn|date=January 2013}}  Persinger also worked as a freelance artist for [[Disneyland]]’s Entertainment Arts.{{cn|date=January 2013}}

Persinger was the sculpture program chair at the [[Laguna College of Art and Design]] from 1995 through 2013, during this period the sculpture program was considered one of the best [[figurative sculpture]] programs in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Art Institute of Southern California Adds the Figure to the California Landscape|journal=National Sculpture Society|year=2000|issue=1|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2008, [[SIAS University]] in China's [[Henan Province]] invited Persinger and several other artists to participate in an [[International Sculpture Symposium]]. Persinger's finished sculpture will be placed at the entrance of the SIAS campus sculpture garden.&lt;ref name="Arts &amp; Entertainment"&gt;{{cite news|title=Professor Receives New Education in China|newspaper=Laguna Beach Independent|date=4 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

As of 2008, Persinger was working on a Holocaust Monument project with poet and [[Holocaust]] survivor [[Peter Fischl]].  This monument will be placed at several museums around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|title=For a Small Boys Sake|newspaper=Chino Champion|date=August 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persinger has recently turned to [[relief]] images in [[glass]] that examine the spiritual connection between man and nature.

[[Image:Report Cards.jpg|thumb|Students holding their report cards]]
A '''report card''', or just '''report''' in [[British English]], communicates a [[student]]'s performance academically. In most places, the report card is issued by the [[school]] to the student or the student's parents twice to four times yearly. A typical report card uses a grading scale to determine the quality of a student's school work. Throughout [[North America]], the grading scale consists of grades scored in classes taken by the student.  Report cards are now frequently issued in automated form by computers and may be mailed to parents and students. Traditional school report cards contained a section for teachers to record individual comments about the student's work and behavior. Some automated card systems provide for teachers' including such comments, but others limit the report card to grades only.

The term "Report card" is used to describe any systematic listing and evaluation of something for information. For example, many states in the United States have their education departments issue report cards on schools' performance. Political advocacy groups will often issue "report cards" on legislators, "grading" them based on their stances on issues.

==Report cards by geographic area==

In [[Former Yugoslavia]] the role of report cards is widely fulfilled by ''Svedočanstva'' ("Testimonies"), in which all final (annual) grades throughout the entire level of education, as well as any negative or positive critique the student is given, and all of his other school institution-related accomplishments are kept.

===United States===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
In some [[elementary school]]s students typically receive three to four report cards. The academic year is separated into three terms (Sept-Dec, Dec-Mar, Mar-June) and at the end of each term the student will get a report card. It is often followed by a break of some sort. For example; First term Christmas Holidays, second term March break and third term Summer Holidays.  Some school districts may administer report cards on a quarterly basis, usually after each nine week term.

In some [[secondary school]]s students receive two report cards, one at the end of each grading period. They also get mid-term report cards midway through the grading period. For example; a semester goes from Sept-Jan and Jan-June. This would not count for [[summer school]].  Some school districts may administer the report card on a trimester or quarterly schedule as well.

Additionally, in the United States, '''progress reports''' may be issued to track a student's performance in between report cards. They are typically issued at the midpoint of a grading period, (for example: 4½ weeks into a nine-week grading period, or three weeks into a six-week grading period) and contain virtually the same information as the report card. These reports allow students and their parents to see if school performance is slipping and if intervention is required to bring up the grade.

===United Kingdom===
English secondary schools would traditionally issue a written report, no more regularly than once a year. This is changing, however, with many schools now publishing reports similar to a grade report. Pupils at key stage 3 are typically awarded a national curriculum level (up to 8th grade), while [[GCSE]] students will be awarded a grade (from A* to G, or U- from 9 to 1 with the new grading system&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-gcse-9-to-1-grades-coming-soon&lt;/ref&gt;). In 2010 the Government agency for ICT in education, [[BECTA]], put in place a requirement for school report cards for all pupils in the comprehensive school system to have their reports made available to parents online (see also [[electronic grade book]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/apr/27/online-school-reports |title=Online school reports soon to be compulsory  |author=Lucy Tobin |date=27 April 2010 |website= |publisher=[[The Guardian]]|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ontario, Canada===
[[File:OntarioReportCard9-12.svg|thumb|right|An Ontario secondary school report card]]
In Ontario, provincially standardized report cards are issued at the end of each term. In elementary schools (Grades 1-8) 2 separate report cards are used: The Elementary Progress Report, used between October 20 and November 20 of the school year, and the Elementary Provincial Report Card, used at the end of Term 1 (sent home between January 20 and February 20 of the academic year) and at the end of Term 2 (sent home toward the end of June of the school year).

Kindergarten report cards are also provincially standardized as of the 2016-2017 school year. These are strictly comment based report cards and are issued on the same schedule that the grade 1-8 report cards are issued.

Note - As of 2018, only the public and catholic school boards in Ontario are required to used the provincial report cards. Many private schools choose to use the provincial report card to maintain the standards set by Ontario's Ministry of Education.

The report cards for Grade 1-6 use a common template. The first quarter of page 1 shows the student's information.  The bottom 3/4's of the first page includes the Learning Skills descriptors regarding the student's behaviour, teacher comments on the learning skills and overall level for each skill (marked on a scale of E -Excellent, G -Good, S -Satisfactory, N -Needs Improvement). The learning skill categories are Organization, Collaboration, Initiative, Independent Work, Self-Regulation, and Responsibility. Page 2 and 3 contain all of the core subjects. Ontario's education includes seven mandatory subjects: English, Second Language (French or Native), Mathematics, Science and Technology, Social Studies, Health and Physical Education and The Arts. English, French, Mathematics and Art are further divided into Reading, Writing, Oral Communication and Media Literacy for English, Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing for Second Language, Number Sense and Numeration, Measurement, Geometry and Spatial Sense, Patterning and Algebra and Data Management and Probability for Mathematics, and Music, Visual Arts and Drama, and Dance for The Arts. Subject specific comments appear beside the marks for each subject. Page 4 details the marking scale used on the report card, possible marks include R (Remediation required), I (insufficient evidence) D-, D, D+, C-, C, C+, B-, B, B+, A-, A, and A+.is for Parent Comments and Signatures and also for Students to plan goals for the future. 'A' marks mean the student is exceeding the provincial standard, 'B' marks mean that they are meeting the provincial standard, 'C' marks mean that the student is approaching the provincial standard and D marks mean that the student falls below the provincial standard.

The grade 7 and 8 template has a few differences from the 1-6 report card. This report card displays the median for the subject/strand/course. Social Studies is also divided into History and Geography. The 7 and 8 report card offers percentage marks instead of letter grades. These marks are still viewed as equivalent letters as detailed in the above grade 1-6 information. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/growSuccess.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Check system ==
In many elementary schools in North America, a "Check System" is used in the primary grades ([[kindergarten]] to [[third grade]]) in place of letter grades. Teachers give a Check for at the given grade's level, Check Plus for advanced, and Check Minus for below the given grade's level.

A similar system is used for informal, low-stakes grading in US colleges, particularly in the humanities, and especially for short writing samples, such as reaction papers or in-class writing. This serves as an alternative to a numerical or letter grade. Here a check means "acceptable" or " at the expected level", check plus means "better than expected", "good" or outstanding", and check minus means "below expectations", "unacceptable" and "bad". The system may also be supplemented by a 0 (zero) for not done or not applicable. The system is informal, and has variations – the work may not count for the final grade or may count for a small amount. If so, the plus/check/minus may or may not be different in value, with any form of check simply counting as participation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/forums/index.php?topic=66225.0 Using check/check plus/check minus for evaluation], The Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://writing.colostate.edu/GTPathways/check.cfm Grading Informal Writing], Colorado State University&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

Due to their status as significant documents in many formal education systems, many early grade reports were printed on cardboard, card-stock paper, or other heavy paper-based materials that were heavier, more durable, and less bendable than standard-weight paper. Many formal education systems also standardize the dimensions of their grades reports to be as long and wide as large index cards. Because of these card-like qualities, the creators and receivers of such print-based grade reports have historically called them "report cards."

Although the dimensions, weight, and pliability of report cards change depending on their education systems, many institutions and districts now print grades reports/report cards on standard 8.5"x11" copy/printer paper.

In the U.K., report cards were cards which misbehaving students were required to carry with them to each class, at the end of which the teacher would enter a failing or passing grade in conduct for that class. Usually the student was required to carry the card for a week and finish the week with no failing grades in order to be relieved of having to present the card for the following week. In the United States, these were called "conduct cards" in many schools.

A '''Select Entry Accelerated Learning''' (SEAL) program is a form of streaming used in government [[secondary school]]s in [[Victoria, Australia]] to provide a focused educational environment for [[academic giftedness|academically gifted]] children.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.sofweb.vic.edu.au/gifted/acceleration/seal.htm |title=Select Entry Acceleration Learning (SEAL) Programs|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302100549/http://www.sofweb.vic.edu.au/gifted/acceleration/seal.htm|archivedate=2007-03-02|publisher=State of Victoria (Department of Education) |date=4 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.sofweb.vic.edu.au/gifted/acceleration/options.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302100746/http://www.sofweb.vic.edu.au/gifted/acceleration/options.htm |title=Acceleration Options|archivedate=2007-03-02|publisher=State of Victoria (Department of Education) |date=4 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program allows students to undertake Year 8 work in Year 7, and the option to complete their secondary education in five years instead of six, or students can choose to undertake a more comprehensive Victorian Certificate of Education that takes three years instead of two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= It's just a swot hop to the top |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/its-just-a-swot-hop-to-the-top/story-e6frgcjx-1226566868295 |publisher= Newscorp |subscription=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130208135201/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/its-just-a-swot-hop-to-the-top/story-e6frgcjx-1226566868295 |archivedate= 2013-02-08 |first=Alice | last=Pung

Victoria currently has four government secondary schools which are entirely selective entry: [[Melbourne High School]], [[Mac.Robertson Girls' High School]], [[Nossal High School]] and [[Suzanne Cory High School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/parents/secondary/Pages/selective.aspx|title=Selective Entry High Schools|date=17 February 2015|publisher=Department of Education and Training}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus five selective schools: [[John Monash Science School]] (which has a science focus), [[Victorian College of the Arts Secondary School]] (which specialises in dance, music and visual arts), [[Maribyrnong Secondary College]] (with specialist sport programs), the [[Flying Fruit Fly Circus School]], and [[The Alpine School]] (an intensive leadership and enterprise program for year 9).&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/parents/secondary/Pages/types.aspx|title=Types of Government Schools|date=28 September 2013 |publisher=Department of Education and Training}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[Department of Education (Victoria)|Department of Education]] stopped accrediting the SEAL program, with a spokesman saying that schools that offer the program should offer enrolment to local students before students outside the school's zoning region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/department-walks-away-from-selectentry-programs-for-gifted-students-20160404-gnxzti.html|title=Department walks away from select-entry programs for gifted students|last=Cook|first=Henrietta|date=4 April 2016|work=The Age|access-date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
As a form of [[streaming (education)|streaming]], SEAL programs by their very nature attract criticism from those committed to the principles of [[comprehensive education]]. Additionally, because they are not offered by every school, the schools that run them are argued to take away the top students from schools that don't, thus leading to a pool of less diverse schools and a concentration of bright students in a small number of schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Gifted-pupils-drift-from-state-schools/2005/02/25/1109180110509.html |title=Gifted pupils drift from state schools|first= Roslyn|last= Guy|work= The Age|date=26 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/SEAL-performs-but-not-all-applaud/2005/03/04/1109700674071.html?from=moreStories |title=SEAL performs but not all applaud|first= Roslyn|last= Guy|work= The Age|date=5 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/04/1096871811720.html?from=storylhs |title=Selective entry: the state school dilemma |work=The Age |date=5 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21645700-5011683,00.html |title=Test Case|work=The Herald Sun|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615093716/http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/learn/test-case/story-e6frf7ox-1111113440607 |archivedate=2011-06-15| last=Siobhan | first=Duck | date=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [[File:Shimer College Logo.PNG|alt=Shimer College Logo|thumb|Shimer College is one of the few remaining American collegiate institutions to continue the "[[Robert Maynard Hutchins|Hutchin]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s' Plan" as a primary pedagogic philosophy.]] --&gt;
The '''core curriculum of [[Shimer College]]''' is a sequence of 16 required courses humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]]&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;studies. "Basic Studies" courses are generally taken during the first two years, and "Advanced Studies" during the final two years. The "Advanced Integrative Studies" courses, numbered are taken in the final year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nationalgreatbooks.com/cirriculum/structure.asp|title = Shimer College: Reflections on Teaching a Structured Four Year Curriculum|date = |accessdate = 2010-07-07|website = |publisher = National Great Books Curriculum|last = Mullaney|first = Kathleen|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101212230425/http://www.nationalgreatbooks.com/cirriculum/structure.asp|archivedate = 2010-12-12|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to required core classes, ''electives'' offer in-depth work in a particular subject, or basic skills instruction. ''Tutorials ''follow a similar protocol, but with only one or two students per course, and are similar in structure to the [[Supervision system|Oxford-Cambridge supervision system]].{{sfn|Shimer College Catalog|2009|pp = 17–18}}

== Pedagogy ==
Small seminars are sole form of instruction. Classes are composed of no more than twelve students, and read and discuss only original source material.&lt;ref name="bachelors"&gt;{{cite news |title = A Bachelor's in Books?:  Shimer College Brings Great Books Curriculum to City | last = Ritter | first = Jim | newspaper = Chicago Sun-Times | date = 2006-10-06 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1643584.html | accessdate = 2010-04-25 | format = fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;

Through a process Shimer internally calls "shared inquiry", "the text is the teacher, and thus the faculty member's role is to facilitate interaction between the text and the students",{{sfn|Kavaloski |1979|p = 235}}as well as between the students themselves. Readings are also organized by broad historical and philosophical themes, rather than conventional fields.

Faculty are always addressed by first name. Teachers "facilitate" discussion, and therefore may talk little during actual class-time. Often teachers provide historical and relational information not available from other students or the text itself.

=== Broadening "Great Books" ===
Shimer's current 200-book reading list remains largely faithful to the original Hutchins plan; however, new works are judiciously added to the core curriculum. These have included voices originally overlooked in the formation of the canon.{{sfn |Casement|1996|p = 89}}  Now included, for example, are works by  [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Carol Gilligan]], [[Frantz Fanon]], and [[Michel Foucault]], along with other contemporary authors.{{sfn |Casement|1996|p = 89}}

== Core Concentrations ==

=== Humanities ===
The humanities core begins with the study of visual art and music, and progresses through literature, philosophy, and theology. The culminating course, "Critical Evaluation in the Humanities," attempts to approach all the areas of the Humanities through critical evaluation of significant works of the 18th century and later. This course includes Martin Buber's I and Thou, Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment, Friedrich Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil, and Søren Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.shimer.edu/live/files/105-academic-catalog-20132015--final-61913pdf|title =Shimer College Academic Catalog 2013-2015|date =|accessdate =|website =Shimer College Academic Catalog 2013-2015 (pg28)|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150103090324/http://www.shimer.edu/live/files/105-academic-catalog-20132015--final-61913pdf|archivedate =2015-01-03|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social sciences ===
The social sciences sequence opens with major works regarding the individual and society, and proceeds to classical political thought. Advanced courses investigate modern social and political theory, and conclude with the "Theories of Social Inquiry". This course focuses on interpretive methods in sociology, linguistic theory, and 20th century social thought, through works including Clifford Geertz's The Interpretation of Cultures, Paolo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Michel Foucault's Discipline and Punish, and Karl Mannheim's Ideology and Utopia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.shimer.edu/live/files/105-academic-catalog-20132015--final-61913pdf|title =Shimer College Academic Catalog 2013-2015|date =|accessdate =|website =Shimer College Academic Catalog 2013-2015 (pg16)|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150103090324/http://www.shimer.edu/live/files/105-academic-catalog-20132015--final-61913pdf|archivedate =2015-01-03|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Natural sciences ===
The natural sciences course examines the historical course of modern theory, beginning with the presocratic philosophers of the 6th century BCE and progressing to the development of the theory of atoms. The second course traces the evolution of theories of evolution, genetics, and animal behavior. The development of models of infinitesmals, optics, and relativity are covered in the third course. The capstone course traces the study of quantum physics and modern molecular biology. The natural science reading list includes Albert Einstein’s Relativity, Isaac Newton’s Opticks, Richard Feynman’s QED, Antoine Lavoisier’s Elements of Chemistry, and Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.shimer.edu/live/files/105-academic-catalog-20132015--final-61913pdf|title =Shimer College Academic Catalog 2013-2015|date =|accessdate =|website =Shimer College Academic Catalog 2013-2015 (pg16)|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150103090324/http://www.shimer.edu/live/files/105-academic-catalog-20132015--final-61913pdf|archivedate =2015-01-03|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Integrative studies ===
The first basic integrative studies course historically intended to develop fundamental skills in close reading and argumentation students required to further work with original source texts. The content of this course has been modified, and is fulfilled by fourth and fifth level courses, usually reserved for transfer students.

The second course, normally the first taken, the development of logic and mathematics are studied through readings in geometry and axiomatic systems from ancient and modern times.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.shimer.edu/live/files/105-academic-catalog-20132015--final-61913pdf|title =Shimer College Academic Catalog 2013-2015|date =|accessdate =|website =Shimer College Academic Catalog 2013-2015 (pg16)|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150103090324/http://www.shimer.edu/live/files/105-academic-catalog-20132015--final-61913pdf|archivedate =2015-01-03|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advanced integrative studies courses are the capstone courses of the Shimer curriculum. The readings are arranged chronologically in a unified, full-year sequence to demonstrate their historical relationships, beginning with the ancient epic poems The Epic of Gilgamesh and Homer's Iliad, and concluding with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's Reason in History.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.shimer.edu/live/files/105-academic-catalog-20132015--final-61913pdf|title =Shimer College Academic Catalog 2013-2015|date =|accessdate =|website =Shimer College Academic Catalog 2013-2015 (pg16)|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150103090324/http://www.shimer.edu/live/files/105-academic-catalog-20132015--final-61913pdf|archivedate =2015-01-03|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are encouraged to explore connections between assigned texts and those studied in other courses.

== Assessment and student production ==
Beyond assessment of performance in every class (often accounting for over 50% of a student's course grade), Shimer College requires and assesses the production of a number of significant projects throughout a student's undergraduate tenure.

=== Writing Week ===
Students not 
attempting their Comprehensive Examinations, or working on their Senior Thesis, are required to complete a "Semester Project" during the final week of each term (known as "Writing Week"). These projects focus on a topic chosen by students in conjunction with an advisor. These projects do not receive a grade, but are reviewed by the student's instructors, and must be approved before the student can register for the following semester.

=== Research paper ===
Students are required to complete a substantial original research paper, usually undertaken in the third-level Social Science course, before registering for advanced Integrative Studies courses.{{sfn|Shimer College Catalog|2009|p = 21}}

=== Comprehensive examinations ===
Students must pass&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;at least two comprehensive examinations to graduate. After completing the Basic Studies courses all students must pass the Basic Studies Comprehensive Examination to continue on to higher level courses.&lt;ref name="reflections"&gt;{{cite web | title = Shimer College: Reflections on Teaching a Structured Four Year Curriculum | last = Mullaney | first = Kathleen | publisher = National Great Books Curriculum | url = http://www.nationalgreatbooks.com/cirriculum/structure.asp | accessdate = 2010-07-07 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101212230425/http://www.nationalgreatbooks.com/cirriculum/structure.asp | archivedate = 2010-12-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;After completing the Advanced Studies courses, students must pass at least one Area Studies Comprehensive Examination, usually in their area of concentration, in order to graduate. {{sfn|Shimer College Catalog|2009|p = 21}}

Each comprehensive&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;examination involves a week of exercises in reading and writing, as well as an oral component often taking the form of a Socratic seminar.

=== Undergraduate thesis ===
Every student must complete a Senior Thesis in order to graduate, primarily completed during the student's final year. Fulfillment usually takes the form of an analytical or expository essay, but may be a piece of original fiction, poetry, performance, or work of visual art. Students are encouraged to defend their theses orally and the public is invited to these defenses.{{sfn|Shimer College Catalog|2009|p = 21}}

Their [[Senior (education)|senior]] year, Shimer students who take the [[Graduate Record Exam]]
(GRE) typically outscore three of four other potential graduate 
students and "consistently rank among the best in the nation in scores 
on the verbal and analytical portions of the test", with average 
analytic scores in the 91st percentile.&lt;ref name="magazinelauds"&gt;{{cite news | title =Magazine Lauds Shimer College | last = Sweeney | first = Annie | newspaper = Chicago Sun-Times | date = 2000-10-03 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4565471.html | format = fee required | accessdate = 2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smallshimer"&gt;{{cite news | title = Small Shimer College Ranks High in Sending Students on to Ph.D.s | last = Flink | first = John | newspaper = Chicago Tribune | date = 1998-01-26 | url = http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=25606088&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=11417&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD | format = fee required | accessdate = 2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Spelling Bee of Canada''' is a charitable, educational [[spelling bee]] organization founded by Julie Spence in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegridto.com/city/local-news/bee-here-now/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150104074733/http://www.thegridto.com/city/local-news/bee-here-now/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 January 2015|title=Spelling Bee of Canada finals at Delta Chelsea Hotel|author=Jessica Wynne Lockhart|publisher=The Grid TO|date=9 May 2012|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;!-- web.archive.org doesn't have it archived because "Page cannot be crawled or displayed due to robots.txt." --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ctv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/spelling-bee-of-canada-winner-shares-secret-to-success-1.1817902|title=Spelling Bee of Canada champ shares secret to success, looks forward to future in competition|publisher=CTV News|author=Taylor Poelman|date=12 May 2014|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012 over 46,000 children have participated in the competition.&lt;ref name="sharenews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sharenews.com/spelling-bee-of-canada-marks-its-25th-anniversary/|title=Spelling Bee of Canada marks its 25th anniversary|publisher=Share News|date=9 May 2012|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SBOC holds an annual spelling competition for children 6–14 years of age. Participants are divided into three age categories: primary, 6&amp;ndash;8; junior, 9&amp;ndash;11; and intermediate, 12&amp;ndash;14.&lt;ref name="sharenews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oakville.com/articles/oakville-spelling-bee-is-back/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901131800/http://www.oakville.com/articles/oakville-spelling-bee-is-back/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 September 2013|title=Oakville Spelling Bee Is Back!|author=Michael Burton|date=6 April 2011|publisher=oakville.com|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  15+ students will become mentors to participants in their region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spellingbeeofcanada.ca/about|title=About Us|publisher=Spelling Bee of Canada|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though SBOC operates primarily in [[Ontario]], contestants from other provinces are allowed to register and have competed in the past.&lt;ref name="ctv" /&gt;

Julie Spence founded SBOC in order to engage parents and children.  Spelling bees were popular in Jamaica where she grew up, and she recalls realizing during the competitions "how much [it] brought people together".  She is happy with the growth of SBOC but disappointed by the extremely low number of black participants, and she has encountered many black parents who do not want their children to compete.  Veronica Taylor, a Barbadian-born mental health counsellor and the president of SBOC's Hamilton chapter, is also concerned about the lack of black participation, saying that black parents are not encouraging their children but letting them decide if they want to compete.  [[Laurel Broten]], Ontario's [[Ministry of Education (Ontario)|Minister of Education]], praised the SBOC for helping children in the primary, junior and intermediate age ranges improve their vocabulary and public speaking.  "As Minister of Education, I understand the importance of the work you do to help youth across Ontario enrich their learning and build self-confidence," she said.&lt;ref name="sharenews" /&gt;

== Competitions ==
At the 24th Championship Finals in May 2011 at the Delta Chelsea Hotel in Toronto, ON Maya Sen Chawla made history for her home region London, where she became the first ever Spelling Bee of Canada National Champion to hail from London.

The 2014 SBOC finals took place on 11 May 2014 at the Eaton Chelsea in Toronto. The regional competition in April 2014 had 3,000 participants, 84 of whom went on to the finals. The championship title comes with over $10,000 in cash prizes.&lt;ref name="ctv" /&gt; This year's competition also marks the opening of three new regional chapters; the Aga Khan Education Board, Khalsa School of British Columbia, and the Toronto Community Housing chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/?u=582751642a9fa0221dbac7d0a&amp;id=754eec8f3b|title=MEDIA RELEASE {{!}} 84 Spellers Prove They Don't Need Auto-Correct During 27th Annual Ontario Spelling Bee of Canada Championship|website=us7.campaign-archive1.com|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Students rights sidebar}}
{{Rights |By claimant}}
'''Student rights''' are those [[rights]], such as civil, constitutional, contractual and consumer rights, which regulate student rights and freedoms and allow [[student]]s to make use of their educational investment. These include such things as the right to free speech and association, to due process, equality, autonomy, safety and privacy, and accountability in contracts and advertising, which regulate the treatment of students by teachers and administrators. There is very little scholarship about student rights throughout the world. In general most countries have some kind of student rights (or rights that apply in the educational setting) enshrined in their laws and proceduralized by their court precedents. Some countries, like Romania, in the European Union, have comprehensive student bills of rights, which outline both rights and how they are to be proceduralized. Most countries, however, like the United States and Canada, do not have a cohesive bill of rights and students must use the courts to determine how rights precedents in one area apply in their own jurisdictions.

==Canada==
Canada, like the United States, has a number of laws and court precedents which regulate higher education and provide student rights. The Canadian Encyclopedia, which details issues of Canadian life and governance, states that in Canada "Basically two sorts of rights apply to students: substantive rights – the actual rights that students should enjoy – and procedural rights – methods by which students claim their rights. This article is concerned with students in public institutions, although those in private schools can claim rights under the common law and provincial education Acts."&lt;ref&gt;The Canadian Encyclopedia http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/student-rights&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada does not yet have a national student Bill of Rights or comparable document. If and when one is put in place in Canada it is likely that this document will be called a Charter of Student Rights and Freedoms. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is equivalent to the National Bill of Rights in the United States. The Canadian national student union or government is the Canadian Federation of Students and it has not put forth any such bill.

==France==

===Laws and court precedent on student privacy rights===

* [[Right to privacy]] in higher education
In the [[AlBaho Case]], a French criminal court found three senior academics at the ''[[École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris]]'' (ICPSE) guilty of email espionage. This was the first incident where academic staff were found guilty of a criminal act as a result of a complaint made by a student – and where those staff members had the full support of their institution.

==United States==

In the US, students have many rights accorded by bills or laws (e.g. the Civil Rights Act and Higher Education Act) and executive presidential orders. These have been proceduralized by the courts to varying degrees. The US does not, however, have a national Student Bill of Rights and students rely on institutions to voluntarily provide this information. While some colleges are posting their own student bills, there is no legal requirement that they do so and no requirement that they post all legal rights.&lt;ref name="navigatehighered.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navigatehighered.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515152938/http://www.navigatehighered.com/ |archivedate=2013-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laws and court precedent regarding institutional regulations===

* Right to protection from arbitrary or capricious decision making
Decision making should not be arbitrary or capricious / random and, thus, interfere with fairness.&lt;ref name=bach&gt;Bach, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;''Anderson v. Mass. Inst. of Tech.'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan and Lee (2011) The Law of Higher Education and Kaplan and Lee (2009) A legal guide for student affairs professionals&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;Sharick v. Southeastern University of the Health Sciences, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Brody v. Finch University of Health Sciences / Chicago Med. School'', 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; While this case concerned a private school, ''Healy v. Larsson'' (1974) found that what applied to private intuitions applied also to public.&lt;ref name=bowden&gt;Bowden, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to have institutions follow their own rules
Institutions are required, contractually, to follow their own rules.&lt;ref name=bach /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Tedeschi v. Wagner College'',
1978; 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Schaer v. Braneis U.'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mawdsley&gt;Mawdsley, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fellheimer v. Middlebury College'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Institutional documents may also be considered binding implied-n-fact contracts. ''Goodman v. President and Trustees of Bowdoin College'' (2001) ruled that institutional documents are still contractual regardless if they have a disclaimer.
* Right to adherence to bulletins and circulars
Students are protected from deviation from information advertised in bulletins or circulars.&lt;ref name=rafferty14&gt;Rafferty&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=university&gt;''Ross v. Creighton University''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to adherence to regulations
Students are protected from deviation from information advertised in regulations.&lt;ref name=rafferty14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=university /&gt;
* Right to adherence to course catalogues
Students are protected from deviation from information advertised in course catalogues.&lt;ref name=rafferty14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=university /&gt;&lt;ref name=university9&gt;''Andre v. Pace University'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to adherence to student codes
Students are protected from deviation from information advertised in student codes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Kaplan and Lee (2011) The Law of Higher Education&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harwood&gt;''Harwood v. Johns Hopkins'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to adherence to handbooks

* Right to fulfillment of promises made by advisors
''Healy v. Larsson'' (1974) found that a student who completed degree requirements prescribed by an academic advisor was entitled to a degree on the basis that this was an implied contract.
* Right to a continuous contract
''Mississippi Medical Center v. Hughes'' (2000) determined that students have an implied right to a continuous contract during a period of continuous enrollment suggesting that students have the right to graduate so long as they fulfill the requirements as they were originally communicated.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Degree requirement changes are unacceptable.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=optometry&gt;''Doherty v. Southern College of Optometry'', 1988&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bruner v. Petersen'' (1997) found also that contractual protections do not apply in the event that a student, who has failed to meet requirements, is readmitted into a program.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The student may be required to meet additional requirements which support their success. This may also help avoid issues of discrimination.
* Right to notice of degree requirement changes
''Brody v. Finch University of Health Sciences Chicago Med. School'' (1998) determined that students have the right to notice of degree requirement changes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* Right to fulfillment of verbal promises
Verbal contracts are also binding.&lt;ref name=rafferty&gt;Rafferty, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=university3&gt;''Ross v. Creighton University'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt; ''The North Carolina Court of Appeals in Long v. University of North Carolina at Wilmington'' (1995) found, however, that verbal agreements must be made in an official capacity in order to be binding (Bowden, 2007). ''Dezick v. Umpqua Community College'' (1979) found a student was compensated because classes offered orally by the dean were not provided.

===Laws and court precedent on student rights in academic advising===

* Right to fulfillment of promises and verbal promises by advisors
Verbal contracts are binding.&lt;ref name=rafferty /&gt;&lt;ref name=university3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Long v. University of North Carolina at Wilmington'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt; They must be made in an official capacity, however, to be binding.&lt;ref name=bowden /&gt; ''Dezick v. Umpqua Community College'' (1979) found a student was compensated because classes offered orally by the dean were not provided. ''Healy v. Larsson'' (1974) found that a student who completed degree requirements prescribed by an
academic advisor was entitled to a degree on the basis that this was an implied contract. An advisor should, thus, be considered an official source of information.
* Right to a continuous contract during a period of continuous enrollment
''Mississippi Medical Center v. Hughes'' (2000)  determined that students have an implied right to a continuous contract during a period of continuous enrollment suggesting that students have the right to graduate so long as they fulfill the requirements as they were originally communicated.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Kaplan and Lee (2011) the Law of Higher Education and Kaplan&lt;/ref&gt; Degree requirement changes are unacceptable.&lt;ref name=optometry /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Kaplan and Lee (2011) The Law of Higher Education and Kaplan&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bruner v.

This may also help avoid issues of discrimination.
* Right to notice of degree requirement changes
''Brody v. Finch University of Health Sciences Chicago Med. School'' (1998) determined that students have the right to notice of degree requirement changes (Kaplan &amp; Lee, 2011&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;). If a student, for instance, is absent for a semester and is not continuously enrolled they need to know if degree requirements have changed.
* Right to protection from arbitrary or capricious decision making 
Decision making should not be arbitrary or capricious / random and, thus, interfere with fairness.&lt;ref name=bach /&gt;&lt;ref name=anderson /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Brody v. Finch University of Health Sciences / Chicago Med. School'', 1988&lt;/ref&gt; This is a form of discrimination. While this case concerned a private school, ''Healy v. Larsson'' (1974) found that what applied to private intuitions applied also to public.&lt;ref name=bowden /&gt;

===Laws and court precedent on student rights in recruitment===

* Right to basic institutional facts and figures before admission
The 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act (HOEA, 2008)&lt;ref name=hoea&gt;HOEA, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; requires that institutions disclose institutional statistics on the Department of Education (DOE) website to allow students to make more informed educational decisions. Information required on the DOE website includes: tuition, fees, net price of attendance, tuition plans, and statistics including sex, ability, ethnic and transfer student ratios as well as ACT/SAT scores, degrees offered, enrolled, and awarded. Institutions are also required to disclose transfer credit policies and articulation agreements.
* Right to protection from ability discrimination in academic recruitment
The 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act prohibits ability discrimination in academic recruitment. This includes ability discrimination in recruitment. Individuals designated with a disability by a medical professional, legally recognized with a disability&lt;ref name=optometry /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;''Pushkin v. Regents of the University of Colorado''&lt;/ref&gt; and deemed otherwise qualified are entitled to equal treatment and reasonable accommodations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;ADA, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rehabilitation&gt;Section 504 Rehabilitation Act, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court defined Otherwise qualified as an individual who can perform the required tasks in spite of rather than except for their disability.&lt;ref name=hendrickson&gt;Hendrickson, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=southeastern&gt;''Southeastern Community College v. Davis'', 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laws and court precedent on student rights in admissions===

* Right to protection from sex discrimination in admissions
Title IX of the 1972 Higher Education Act Amendments&lt;ref&gt;HEAA, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; protect all sexes from pre-admission inquiries with regard to pregnancy, parental status, family or marital status. It can be seen that this act also protects against such inquiry regarding inter-sexed, transsexual, transgender or androgynous individuals.
* Right to protection from ability discrimination in admissions
The 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA)&lt;ref name=autogenerated16&gt;ADA, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; and Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act.&lt;ref name=rehabilitation11&gt;Rehabilitation Act, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; This includes ability discrimination in admissions. Individuals designated with a disability by a medical professional, legally recognized with a disability&lt;ref name=optometry /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt; and deemed otherwise qualified are entitled to equal treatment and reasonable accommodations in both educational and employment related activities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=rehabilitation /&gt; The Supreme Court defined Otherwise qualified as an individual who can perform the required tasks in spite of rather than except for their disability.&lt;ref name=hendrickson /&gt;&lt;ref name=southeastern /&gt;
* Right to protection from racial discrimination in admissions
Individuals may not be discriminated against on the basis of their color in either undergraduate or graduate school admissions.&lt;ref name=kaplan&gt;Kaplan &amp; Lee, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Florida ex rel. ''Hawkins v. Board of Control'', 1956&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to testing in admissions accommodations
Protection from discrimination in admissions&lt;ref name=hendrickson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Southeastern Community College v. Davis''&lt;/ref&gt; entails that students receive accommodations required to prove they are otherwise qualified, protection from unfair testing practices, testing accommodations for speech, manual and hearing disabilities and access to alternative testing offered in accessible facilities. Alternative testing must also be offered as frequently as are standard tests.&lt;ref name=rehabilitation17&gt;Section 504 Rehabilitation Act, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Where no alternative testing exists, institutions, however, are not responsible for accommodations.&lt;ref name=rehabilitation17 /&gt;&lt;ref name=university19&gt;''Wynne v. Tufts University School of Medicine'', 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to protection from sex discrimination in admissions testing
Educational tests which are biased in favor of one gender, may not be relied upon as the sole source of information decision making.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sharif by Salahuddin v. New York State Education Department'', 1989&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to protection from racially segregating testing policies
Students' equality entails that individuals not be treated differently by individuals or systematically by an institution. Thus, testing policies which systematically discriminate, are unlawful according to the constitution. ''United States v. Fordice'' (1992) prohibited the use of ACT scores in Mississippi admissions, for instance, because the gap between ACT scores of white and black student was greater than the GPA gap which was not considered at all.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;
* Right to race conscious affirmative action in admissions to correct for discrimination
When a school has engaged in racial discrimination in the past they are required by law to take race conscious affirmative action to correct it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1978"&gt;''Bakke v. Regents of the University of California'', 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hopwood"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Podberesky v. Kirwan'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

White students are protected from racial discrimination at historic minority institutions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Co.'', 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Doe v. Kamehameha Schools'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Racial equality calls for the equal treatment of all individuals; it does not permit, however, lower admissions test requirements&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1986"&gt;''United States v.

* Right to protection from differential testing requirements
Students are protected from the use of lower admissions test scores.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1986"/&gt;
* Right to protection from admissions quotas based on demographics 
Students are protected from the use of quotas which set aside seats for certain demographics.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hopwood /&gt;&lt;ref name=mcdonald /&gt;&lt;ref name=bollinger21&gt;Grutter v.

* Right to adherence to registration materials 
Students are protected from deviation from information advertised in registration materials.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=university13&gt;''Mangala v. Brown University''&lt;/ref&gt; This may be a binding implied-in-fact contract. ''Goodman v. President and Trustees of Bowdoin College'' (2001) ruled that institutional documents are still contractual regardless if they have a disclaimer.

===Laws and court precedent on student rights in readmissions===

* Right to equality in readmissions
Institutions must be careful with readmissions after students have failed to complete necessary program requirements. Readmission raises questions as to why individuals were removed from the program in the first place and whether future applicants may be admitted under like conditions. Discrimination may be alleged regarding both the initial removal and also in the case that other students are not readmitted under like circumstances. Kaplan &amp; Lee and Lee (2011)&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; recommend that institutions, if they wish to avoid breach of contract and discrimination accusations, have an explicit readmission policy even if that policy denies readmission. If students take a voluntary leave of absence, institutions must have a valid reason to refuse readmission.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlin v. Trustees of Boston University, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laws and court precedent on student classroom rights===

President and Trustees of Bowdoin College'' (2001) ruled that institutional documents are still contractual regardless if they have a disclaimer.
* Right to the advertised course content 
Students are entitled to receive instruction on advertised course content.&lt;ref&gt;Bach,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Riggin v. Bd. of Trustees of Ball St. Univ.'', 1984, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions have the right to require coverage of designated course material by teachers&lt;ref name=poskanzer&gt;Poskanzer, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Clark v.

* Right to fair grading in accordance with the course syllabus
Students may be graded fairly and in accordance with criteria set forth by the course syllabuses and may be protected from the addition of new grading criteria.&lt;ref name=parkes /&gt;&lt;ref name=penson /&gt; Institutions have the responsibility of preserving quality in grade representations and comparability between classes and prevent grade inflation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=penson /&gt; Teachers have the right, under the first amendment, to communicate their opinions regarding student grades,&lt;ref name=poskanzer /&gt;&lt;ref name=parate&gt;''Parate v. Isibor'', 1989&lt;/ref&gt; but institutions are required to meet students implied contract rights to fair grading practices. Departments may change grades issued by teachers which are not in line with grading policies or are unfair or unreasonable.&lt;ref name=parate /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hills v. Stephen F.

They do not have academic freedom under the law.&lt;ref name=university20 /&gt; Any academic freedom rules are put in place by the school.
* Right to protection from the misuse of time
Students may expect protection from the misuse of time;&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; teachers may not waste students' time or use the class as a captive audience for views or lessons not related to the course.&lt;ref name=penson /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;''Bach, Riggin v. Bd. of Trustees of Ball St. Univ.''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Riggin v. Bd. of Trustees of Ball St. Univ.'' found that instructors may not "wast[e] the time of the students who have come there and paid money for a different purpose."
* Right to effective teaching
Students can expect effective teaching even if it requires departmental involvement in teaching and curriculum development.&lt;ref&gt;Poskanzer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Riggin v. Bd. of Trustees of Ball St. Univ.'', 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Kozol (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Shame of the Nation|last=Kozol|first=Jonathan|publisher=Broadway Paperbacks|year=2005|isbn=978-1-4000-5245-5|location=New York, U.S.A|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; observed that the curriculum development may not be beneficial for all students since some students come from disadvantaged backgrounds where not every student has equitable opportunities to succeed in school. If there is departmental involvement in the students' learning then the departments need to acknowledge that students are different when they belong to a minority group. Ogbu (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogbu|first=John|year=2004|title=Understanding Cultural Diversity and Learning|url=https://eres.csusm.edu/eres/docs/13699/understanding_cultural_diversity.pdf|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=21|pages=347–358|via=|doi=10.2307/1176697}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that for an effective teaching to take place, departments need to understand students at a group level as well as at an individual level because even students within the same minority groups are different. Given that students have the right to effective teaching, department involvement needs to understand cultural diversity and cultural differences before a curriculum development is considered. 
* Right to protection from written or verbal abuse 
Teachers have the right to regulated expression&lt;ref name=poskanzer /&gt;&lt;ref name=holmes /&gt; but may not use their first amendment privileges punitively or discriminatorily&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Axson-Flynn v.

Lorenzo'', 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to protection from ability discrimination in learning
The 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act&lt;ref name=autogenerated16 /&gt; and Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act&lt;ref name=rehabilitation11 /&gt; prohibit disability based discrimination in the classroom.

* Right to protection from testing policies which racially segregate
Students Equality entails that individuals not be treated differently by individuals or systematically by an institution. Thus, testing policies which systematically discriminate, are unlawful according to the constitution. ''United States v. Fordice'' (1992) prohibited the use of ACT scores in Mississippi admissions, for instance, because the gap between ACT scores of white and black student was greater than the GPA gap which was not considered at all.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;

===Laws and court precedent on student group rights===

* Right to equality in the provision of student activities
Institutions have an obligation to provide equal opportunities in athletics, bands and clubs. This includes equal accommodation of interests and abilities for both sexes, provision of equipment and facility scheduling for such activities as games and practices, travel allowance and dorm room facilities. It includes also equal quality facilities including locker rooms, medical services, tutoring services, coaching and publicity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;CRA, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that sufficient opportunities are made available for women, institutions are responsible for complying with Title IX in one of three ways. They must provide athletic opportunities proportionate to enrollment, prove that they are continually expanding opportunities for the underrepresented sex or accommodate the interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex.&lt;ref name=title&gt;HEAA Title IX, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to the disclosure of athletics plans and expenditures
The 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act&lt;ref name=hoea /&gt; also requires the disclosure of athletics information including male and female undergraduate enrollment, number of teams and team statistics including the number of players, team operating expenses, recruitment, coach salaries, aid to teams and athletes and team revenue (HEOA, 2008). This information is required to ensure equality standards are met.

===Laws and court precedent on student residence or residence hall rights===

* Right to have visitors in residence hall rooms
''Good v. Associated Students Univ. of Washington'' (1975) found students have the right to have visitors and solicitors in their residence hall rooms.
* Right to sex equality in housing standards
Students are entitled to housing of equal quality and cost and to equal housing policies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;
* Right to protection from gender segregation in residence
Until the nineteen nineties gender segregation was permissible so long as institutional rationale for doing so was narrowly defined and justifiable.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hogan v. Mississippi State School for Women'', 1982&lt;/ref&gt; This precedent was officially reversed, however, after the Supreme Court in ''United States v. Commonwealth of Virginia'' (1992) found that a woman mistakenly admitted to a men's military college was entitled to remain enrolled.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref name="Faulkner v. Jones, 1995"/&gt;
* Right to disability accommodation in residence facilities
Students with disabilities are also entitled to equal quality dormitories with living accommodations (Section 504 Rehabilitation Act, 1973; Kaplan &amp; Lee, 2011.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fleming v.

===Laws and court precedent on student privacy rights===

* Right to privacy in higher education
''Griswald v. Connecticut'' (1965) found that the third, fourth, and fifteen amendments together constitute an inalienable right to privacy. Students are extended the same privacy rights extended to the community at large.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref name=washington /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Speakes v. Grantham'', 1970&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to privacy of student records
The 1971 Family Rights and Privacy Act&lt;ref name=ferpa&gt;FERPA, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act&lt;ref name=heoa&gt;HEOA, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; protect student information. Students have the right to access their records, dispute record keeping and limited control over the release of documents to third parties.
* Right to approve release of student information 
FRPA and the HOEA require students sign a release before their student records will be provided to third parties (e.g.: to parents and employers tec.). This legislation does allow schools, however, to release information without student approval for the purpose of institutional audit, evaluation, or study, student aid consideration, institutional accreditation, compliance with legal subpoenas or juvenile justice system officers&lt;ref name=ferpa /&gt; or in order to comply with laws requiring identification of sex offenders on campus.&lt;ref name=hoea /&gt; Institutions may also disclose information to student guardians if the student is declared a dependant for tax purposes (FERPA).
* Right to notice of information disclosures
Under FERPA, schools may publish directory information, including the students name, address, phone number, date of birth, place of birth, awards, attendance dates or student ID number, unless students ask the school not to disclose it. The institution must inform students they are entitled to these rights.
* Right to use pseudonyms on public internet forums
Individuals may use pseudonyms online and are not required to identify themselves (Kaplan &amp; Lee, 2011).&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia v. Miller'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
Drug testing Random National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) urine testing is legal to protect athlete health, fair competition and opportunities to educate about drug abuse in sports.&lt;ref&gt;''O'Halloran v. University of Washington'', 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Officials are allowed to watch athletes urinate.&lt;ref&gt;''Hill v. NCAA'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; This overturned an earlier ruling which prohibited urination watching.

===Laws and court precedent on student information rights===
* Right to basic institutional facts and figures before admission
The 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act&lt;ref name=hoea /&gt; requires that institutions disclose institutional statistics on the Department of Education (DOE) website to allow students to make more informed educational decisions. Information required on the DOE website includes: tuition, fees, net price of attendance, tuition plans, and statistics including sex, ability, ethnic and transfer student ratios as well as ACT/SAT scores, degrees offered, enrolled, and awarded. Institutions are also required to disclose transfer credit policies and articulation agreements.
* Right to financial aid information disclosures
The 2008 HOEA&lt;ref name=hoea /&gt; also requires institutions of higher education provide financial aid information disclosures, which essentially advertise the financial aid program, pre eligibility disclosures pertaining to the individual student, information differentiating federally insured or subsidized and private loans, preferred lender agreements, institutional rational for the establishment of preferred lender agreements and notice that schools are required to process any loan chosen by students.
* Right to information about the full cost of attendance
According to the 2008 HOEA, financial aid information disclosures must include the average financial aid awarded per person, cost of tuition, fees, room, board, books, supplies and transport.&lt;ref name=hoea /&gt;
* Right to information about the full cost of loan repayment
According to the 2008 HOEA, financial aid information disclosures must include the amount of aid not requiring repayment, eligible loans, loan terms, net required repayment.&lt;ref name=hoea /&gt;
* Right to detailed federal student loan information
Pre-eligibility disclosures must include notice of repayment, lender details, the principle amount, fees, interest rate, interest details, limits of borrowing, cumulative balance, estimated payment, frequency, repayment start date, minimum and maximum payments and details regarding deferment, forgiveness, consolidation and penalties.&lt;ref name=hoea /&gt;
* Right to standards terminology in financial aid forms
Institutions are also required to utilize standard financial terminology and standard dissemination of financial aid information, forms, procedures, data security and searchable financial aid databases to ensure that students can easily understand their contractual rights and obligations. Forms must be clear, succinct, easily readable and disability accessible.
* Right to detailed third party federal student loan information
The HOEA (2008) requires third party student loan lenders to disclose information concerning alternative federal loans, fixed and variable rates, limit adjustments, co-borrower requirements, maximum loans, rate, principle amount, interest accrual, total estimated repayment requirement, maximum monthly payment and deferral options.
* Right to financial aid awareness campaigns for underrepresented students in high education
The HOEA (2008) requires institutions of higher education to engage in financial aid eligibility awareness campaigning to make students aware of student aid and the realities of accepting it.
* Right to information on use of student fees
''Van Stry v. State'' (1984) found institutions may not use student fees to support organizations outside the university.&lt;ref name=henderickson8 /&gt; Teachers, likewise, have the right to refuse to pay union fees when they are allocated to objectionable political purposes.&lt;ref name=henderickson8 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Aboode v. Detroit Board of Education'', 1977&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that students have a right to know what activities they are being allocated towards.
* Right to the disclosure of athletics plans and expenditures
The 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act requires the disclosure of athletics information including male and female undergraduate enrollment, number of teams and team statistics including the number of players, team operating expenses, recruitment, coach salaries, aid to teams and athletes and team revenue (HEOA, 2008). This information is required to ensure equality standards are met. This ensures that institutions are abiding by Title IX of the 1972 Higher Education Act Amendments which limits sexual discrimination and requires institutions to offer equal sport, club and opportunities.
* There are many other implied information rights. If legislation states that students are entitled to certain information in pre-eligibility loan disclosures, this implies that they are also entitled to have a pre-eligibility loan disclosure.
* Right to information on the justification of policies
''Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia'' (1995) found student fees must be allocated in a viewpoint neutral way. They cannot be based on religious, political or personal views (Henderickson; ''Good v. Associated Students University of Washington'') and they cannot be levied as a punishment.&lt;ref name=henderickson8 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Stanley v. McGrath'', 1983&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that students have a right to policy justification so that they know they are viewpoint neutral.
* Right to information regarding course objectives and content
Students may expect protection from the misuse of time;&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; teachers may not waste students' time or use the class as a captive audience for views or lessons not related to the course.&lt;ref name=penson /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; ''Riggin v. Bd. of Trustees of Ball St. Univ.'' found that instructors may not "wast[e] the time of the students who have come there and paid money for a different purpose." This assumes that students are entitled to know course objectives and content.
* Right to a course syllabus
Students may be graded fairly and in accordance with criteria set forth by the course syllabuses and may be protected from the addition of new grading criteria.&lt;ref name=parkes /&gt;&lt;ref name=penson /&gt; Institutions have the responsibility of preserving quality in grade representations and comparability between classes and prevent grade inflation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=penson /&gt; This assumes that students have the right to a syllabus to ensure fair grading.

===Laws and court precedent on student rights in discipline and dismissal===

* Right to protection from ability discrimination in discipline and dismissal
The 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act&lt;ref&gt;ADA, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; and Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act protect students against discrimination based on ability.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=southeastern /&gt;&lt;ref name=rehabilitation11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=university19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=henderickson8 /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981"&gt;''Pushkin v. Regents of the University of Colorado'', 1981&lt;/ref&gt; This includes ability discrimination in discipline and dismissal. Individuals shall be designated with a disability by a medical professional, legally recognized with a disability.&lt;ref name=optometry /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt;
* Right to due process in disciplinary action
''Matthews v. Elderidge'' (1976) found when there is the possibility that one’s interests will be deprived through procedural error, the value of additional safe guards and governmental interests, including monetary expenses, should be weighed.&lt;ref name=bach /&gt; ''Foster v. Board of Trustees of Butler County Community College'' (1991) found that students are not entitled to due process rights when appealing rejected admissions applications.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; They are not yet students.
* Right to due process in disciplinary with the potential to lead to a monetary loss
Due process is required when actions have the potential to resulting a property or monetary loss or loss of income or future income etc. This includes degree revocation&lt;ref name=bach /&gt;&lt;ref name=crook&gt;''Crook v. Baker''&lt;/ref&gt; or dismissal. Students have a property interest in remaining at the institution and have protection form undue removal.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mangala v. Brown University'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to due process in disciplinary with the potential for a loss of liberty
Students also have a liberty right to protect themselves from defamation of character or a threat to their reputation. Federal district courts have, therefore, found that due process is required in cases involving charges of plagiarism, cheating&lt;ref name=henderickson8 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tully&gt;''Tully v. Orr'', 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and falsification of research data.&lt;ref name=bach /&gt;&lt;ref name=crook /&gt;
* Right to a clear notice of charges in the disciplinary process
In disciplinary measures students are entitled to the provision of a definite charge.&lt;ref name=mawdsley /&gt;&lt;ref name=henderickson8 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Esteban v. Central Missouri State College'', 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Woodis v. Westark Community College'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to a prompt notice of charges in the disciplinary process
Students are entitled to a prompt notice of charges, e.g., ten days before the hearing.&lt;ref name=henderickson8 /&gt;&lt;ref name=missouri&gt;''Esteban v. Central Missouri State College''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;''Board of Curators of the University of Missouri v. Horowitz'', 1978&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to a hearing before an expert judge
In cases involving expulsion or dismissal students are entitled to right to "expert" judgment with a judge who is empowered to expel.&lt;ref name=henderickson8 /&gt;&lt;ref name=missouri /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt;
* Right to inspect all documents in disciplinary hearings
Students may inspect documents considered by institutional officials in disciplinary hearings.&lt;ref name=henderickson8 /&gt;&lt;ref name=missouri /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt;
* Right to be a witness in disciplinary hearings
Students may stand as a witness and tell their story during disciplinary hearings.&lt;ref name=missouri /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt;&lt;ref name=henderickson&gt;Henderickson&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to record disciplinary hearings
Students may record disciplinary hearings to ensure they are conducted in a legal fashion.&lt;ref name=henderickson8 /&gt;&lt;ref name=missouri /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt;
* Right to unbiased ruling in disciplinary hearings
Students can expect rulings in disciplinary hearings to be based solely on evidence presented at the hearing.&lt;ref name=missouri /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderickson,1986&lt;/ref&gt; Students are also entitled to a hearing before a person or committee not involved in the dispute.&lt;ref name=mawdsley /&gt;
* Right to a written statement of findings in disciplinary hearings
Students may expect to receive a written account of findings from disciplinary hearings showing how decisions are in line with evidence.&lt;ref name=henderickson8 /&gt;&lt;ref name=missouri /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt;
* Right to fairness in disciplinary hearings
''Board of Curators of the University of Missouri et al. v. Horowitz'' (1978) found that fairness means that decisions, a) may not be arbitrary or capricious, b) must provide equal treatment with regard to sex, religion or personal appearance etc. and c) must be determined in a careful and deliberate manner.
* Right to hearing before discipline
Hearings must be conducted before suspension or discipline unless there is a proven threat to danger, damage of property or academic disruption.&lt;ref&gt;''Gross v. Lopez'', 1975&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to action in line with inquiry findings 
''Texas Lightsey v. King'' (1983) determined that due process requires that the outcomes of investigation be taken seriously. A student cannot, for instance, be dismissed for cheating after a hearing has found him not guilty.&lt;ref name=bach /&gt;
* Right to investigation and consideration of circumstance
The American Bar Association (ABA) found that the need for a fair and just hearing also precludes the use of zero tolerance policies which ignore the circumstances surrounding an action.&lt;ref name=bach /&gt; An individual who commits a crime because they believe they are in danger may not be held accountable in the same way as an individual who conducts the same crime for self-interest.
* Right to greater due process in criminal matters
Students accused of criminal acts including drug possession,&lt;ref name=bach /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Smyth v. Lubber'', 1975&lt;/ref&gt; plagiarism, cheating&lt;ref name=henderickson8 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tully /&gt; and falsification of research data or fraud, may have greater due process rights.
* Right to cross examine in criminal matters
Students accused of criminal acts may cross-examine witnesses,&lt;ref name=bach /&gt;&lt;ref name=crook4&gt;''Crook v. Baker'', 1987&lt;/ref&gt; counsel.&lt;ref name=bach /&gt;&lt;ref name=gabrilowitz&gt;''Gabrilowitz v. Newman'', 1978&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to an open trial in criminal matters
Students accused of criminal acts may have an open trial to ensure that it is conducted fairly,&lt;ref name=bach /&gt;&lt;ref name=crook4 /&gt; counsel.&lt;ref name=bach /&gt;&lt;ref name=gabrilowitz /&gt;
* Right to a fair evidentiary standard of proof in criminal matters
In non-criminal hearings in the educational setting, schools may use a lesser standard evidence but where criminal matters are concerned they must have clear and convincing evidence.&lt;ref name=bach /&gt;&lt;ref name=crook4 /&gt;
* Right to counsel in criminal matters Students accused of criminal acts may have counsel present. This does not mean that the institution must pay for it but that they
may be present.&lt;ref name=bach /&gt;&lt;ref name=gabrilowitz /&gt;
* Right to a higher appeals process in criminal matters
Students accused of criminal acts should have access to a higher appeals process.&lt;ref&gt;''Clayton v. Princeton'', 1985&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to legal representation during any formal university disciplinary procedure
The [[Student &amp; Administration Equality Act]] is proposed legislation in the North Carolina General Assembly (House Bill 843) would allow any student or student organization that is charged with a violation of conduct at a North Carolina state university the right to be represented by an attorney at any stage of the disciplinary process regarding the charge of misconduct.

===Laws and court precedent on student rights and campus police===

* Right to protection from unwarranted search and seizure
Students are protected from unwarranted search and seizure.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=municipal /&gt; The fourth and fourteenth amendments protect from search and seizure without a warrant. They enshrine the individuals right to be “secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects.” Warrants must include person, place and specific items eligible for search and or seizure. Search and seizure rights do not apply to automobiles.
* Right to arrest by official police officers
Individuals are protected from arrest by undeputized campus police&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;State of North ''Carolina v. Pendleton'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and illegal search and seizure if arrest is made.
* Right to protection from entrapment
Students are protected from entrapment by campus police as individuals are protected outside the educational environment.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Wright v. Schreffler'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to protection from dorm search and seizure
''Piazzola v. Watkins'' (1971) established that students are not required to waive search and seizure rights as a condition of dormitory residence.&lt;ref name=henderickson8 /&gt; Random dorm sweeps are impermissible.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan &amp; Lee; ''Devers v. Southern University'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to clearly defined terms of dorm search and seizure
Institutions may enter rooms in times of emergency, if they have proof of illegal activity or a threat to the educational environment.&lt;ref name=christman /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1968"/&gt; Both these terms must be clearly stipulated in advance. Otherwise institutions must ask for permission to enter.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=chapman /&gt;&lt;ref name=morale /&gt; When dorms rooms are legally searched for narrowly defined reasons or officials are legally permitted to enter student rooms, students are not protected from property damage incurred in the search process&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref name=baughman /&gt; or action taken when evidence is in plain sight.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref name=washington /&gt;
* Right to protection from illegal police search and seizure
Evidence found in student dorm rooms by institutional employees cannot be used in a court of law and institutions cannot allow police to conduct a search and seizure with out warrant.&lt;ref name=christman /&gt;&lt;ref name=commonwealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=piazzola /&gt; Students may not be punished for refusing a warrantless search from institutional authorities or police officers.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref name=municipal /&gt; When students freely allow institutional officials to enter institutions can hold students accountable for evidence in plain sight.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref name=washington /&gt;

===Laws and court precedent on student safety rights===

* Right to protection from injury on campus
A number of state courts have also found that institutions have a responsibility to prevent or make efforts to limit injury on campus from dangerous property and criminal conditions&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=schneider&gt;''Vangeli v. Schneider'', 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=white&gt;White, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=miller&gt;''Miller v. State'', 1984&lt;/ref&gt; so long as injury is both foreseeable and preventable.
* Right to protection from injury in facilities under campus jurisdiction
''Knoll v. Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska'' (1999) found that institutions are responsible for ensuring the safety of facilities which are either under institutional jurisdiction or oversight. Institutions are, thus, responsible for institutionally owned dormitories and fraternities whether on campus or off campus and also for fraternities which may not be owned by the institution but are regulated by the institution. By taking on a regulatory role the institution also takes on this liability. Another state court found, that when students are not lawfully permitted to be on institutional property or in institutional buildings after hours, for instance, the institution is not responsible.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=laura&gt;''Laura O. v. State'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Where institutions willfully take responsibility for something like a fraternity or require students to abide by their rules they also take on the liability.
* Right to protection from foreseeable crime on campus
Students should be safe from for seeable crime especially in light of past reports of crime, if loitering or dangerous conditions have been made etc.&lt;ref name=white /&gt;&lt;ref name=miller /&gt; Institutions are required to take safety precautions including the monitoring of unauthorized personnel in dormitories, taking action against unauthorized personnel when they pose a threat to safety and ensuring adequate security measures are in place.
* Right to protection from injury caused by other students
Students deserve protection from other students over whom the institution has oversight including voluntarily assumed jurisdiction e.g.: clubs, sororities, fraternities, teams.&lt;ref name=white /&gt;&lt;ref name=university5&gt;''Furek v. University of Delaware'', 1991&lt;/ref&gt; This, for instance, includes protection from foreseeable or preventable fraternity hazing even if fraternities are not located on institutional property. The institution also has a responsibility to inform itself of safety risks existent in institutionally regulated programs (White, 2007). State courts have found that institutions are not responsible, however, for screening ex-convicts before admission,&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Eiseman v. State of New York''&lt;/ref&gt; 1987).

===Laws and court precedent on student constitutional rights===

Students have the right to constitutional freedoms and protections in higher education. Prior to the 1960s institutions of higher education did not have to respect students constitutional rights but could act as a parent in the interest of the student (Nancy Thomas, 1991). In 1960 ''Shelton v. Turner'' found "the vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of American schools" and in 1961 ''Dixon v. Alabam'' found that students were not required to give up, as a condition of admission, their constitutional rights and protections.&lt;ref name=bach /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free speech and association rights====

* Right to free speech and association rights
Students retain their first amendment rights in institutions of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;ASHE &amp; Henderickson, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; ''Papish v. Board of Curators of the Univ. of Missouri'' (1973) and ''Joyner v. Whiting'' (1973) found students may engage in speech that do not interfere with the rights of others or of the operation of the school.&lt;ref&gt;ASHE &amp; Henderickson&lt;/ref&gt; Because schools are places of education they may regulate speech by time, manner and place as long as they provide free speech zones for students&lt;ref name=henderickson8 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Perry Ed. Assoc. v. Perry Local Ed. Assoc.'', 1983&lt;/ref&gt; as long as they are not used to limit expression.&lt;ref name=henderickson8 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bayless v. Maritime'', 1970&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to free religious and unaccepted speech
The first amendment protects religious, indecent speech and profane hand gestures including the middle finger.&lt;ref name=bach /&gt;&lt;ref name=henderickson8 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Orin v. Barclay'', 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Papish v. Board of Curators of the University of Missouri''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Joyner v. Widmar v. Vincent'', 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chess v. Widmar'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whiting&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Klein v. Smith'', 1986&lt;/ref&gt; ''Texas v. Johnson'' (1989) found that “[i]f there is a bedrock principle underlying the first amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable. The first amendment does not recognize exceptions for bigotry, racism, and religious intolerance or ideas or matters some may deem trivial, vulgar or profane.”
* Right to expression through clothing
Clothing, armbands, newspaper editorials and demonstrations have all been found legal forms of free speech.&lt;ref&gt;''Tinker v. Des Moines independent Community School District'', 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dixon v. Alabama State Board of Education'', 1961&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to free speech on public forums 
The first amendment covers internet communications.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1980"&gt;''Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rosenberger&gt;''Rosenberger v. Rector of Virginia University'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; On forums designated by the institution as public forums or commonly used as public forums, students may express themselves without content regulation or removal.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=rosenberger /&gt; ''Online Policy Group v. Diebold, Inc.'', 2004 Regulation may take place to prevent illegal activities.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1980"/&gt;

====Equality rights====

* Right to protection from sex discrimination in higher education
Students are protected from discrimination based on sex in any program or activity receiving federal funding except military, fraternity, sorority organizations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=title /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated18&gt;HEA, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oklahoma&gt;''Gossett v. State of Oklahoma'', 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to the protection from sexual harassment in education
Sexual harassment is considered a form of sex discrimination under Title IV of the 1964 Civil Rights Act&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref name=cooper7&gt;Cooper et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Harris v. Forklift Systems Inc.'', 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Meritor Savings Bank FSB v. Vinson'', 1986&lt;/ref&gt; and applies to all federal programs and activities. Sexual harassment has been prohibited in educational settings&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"&gt;''Morse v. Regents of the University of Colorado'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;''Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and applies also to both opposite and same sex harassment by students.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 2002; ''Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=university6&gt;''Nogueras v. University of Puerto Rico'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to sex equality in the provision of student activities
Institutions have an obligation to provide equal opportunities in athletics, bands and clubs. This includes equal accommodation of interests and abilities for both sexes, provision of equipment and facility scheduling for such activities as games and practices, travel allowance and dorm room facilities. It includes also equal quality facilities including locker rooms, medical services, tutoring services, coaching and publicity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; To ensure that sufficient opportunities are made available for women, institutions are responsible for complying with Title IX in one of three ways. They must provide athletic opportunities proportionate to enrollment, prove that they are continually expanding opportunities for the underrepresented sex or accommodate the interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex.&lt;ref name=title /&gt;
* Right to the disclosure of athletics plans and expenditures
The 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act also requires the disclosure of athletics information including male and female undergraduate enrollment, number of teams and team statistics including the number of players, team operating expenses, recruitment, coach salaries, aid to teams and athletes and team revenue.&lt;ref name=heoa /&gt; This information is required to ensure equality standards are met.
* Right to protection from ability discrimination in facilities
The 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act&lt;ref name=autogenerated16 /&gt; and Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act&lt;ref name=rehabilitation11 /&gt; prohibits ability discrimination in higher education.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=southeastern /&gt;&lt;ref name=university19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=henderickson8 /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981"/&gt; This includes ability discrimination in facility use. Individuals designated with a disability by a medical professional, legally recognized with a disability&lt;ref name=optometry /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt; and deemed otherwise qualified are entitled to equal treatment and reasonable accommodations in both educational and employment related activities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=rehabilitation /&gt; The Supreme Court defined Otherwise qualified as an individual who can perform the required tasks in spite of rather than except for their disability.&lt;ref name=hendrickson /&gt;&lt;ref name=southeastern /&gt;
* Right to protection from race discrimination
The 1972 Equal Educational Opportunity Act protects students equal rights to educational opportunity regardless of race and the 1965 Lyndon B. Johnson Executive Order 11246 and the 1964 Civil Rights Act require equal access to employment opportunities regardless of race.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref name=oklahoma /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Anderson v. University of Wisconsin'', 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Garcia v. S.U.N.Y. Health Sciences Center of Brooklyn'', 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to protection from racial segregation
Students are protected from racial segregation which compromises access to quality education.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaye, Bickela &amp; Birtwistle, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Brown v. Board of Education'', 1954&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Fordice'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to affirmative action
All federal employers or federal contractors are required to take affirmative action&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;EO 11246, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; to help counteract the effects of historical discrimination. They must create goals, timetables, action plans, budgets and reporting systems to ensure that marginalized populations are given equal employment opportunities. Regulations must also be posted in conspicuous places
easily available to all staff and potential employees.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15&gt;EO 11246&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to freedom from discrimination in affirmative action
Diversity is defined in much broader terms than race. ''Grutter v. Bollinger'' (2003)&lt;ref name=bollinger21 /&gt; found a “broad range of qualities and experiences that may be considered valuable contributions” and “a wide variety of characteristics besides race and ethnicity.” Members of the majority are also protected from reverse discrimination.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bollinger21 /&gt;&lt;ref name=bollinger /&gt;&lt;ref name=odegaard&gt;''DeFunis v. Odegaard'', 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Race neutral affirmative action policies must make exceptions on an individual basis and may not discriminate based on race or color.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bollinger21 /&gt;&lt;ref name=bollinger /&gt;&lt;ref name=odegaard /&gt;
* Right to protection from discrimination based on national origin in education 
Individuals have the right to equal treatment regardless of national origin in institutions of higher education (HEA, 1965) so long as they are citizens or resident aliens of the United States.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref name=nyquist&gt;''Nyquist v. Jean-Marie Mauclet'', 1977&lt;/ref&gt; The 1986 Immigration and Reform Control Act also prohibits discrimination based on citizenship. Institutions have the right to discriminate based on national origin so long as objectives are both narrowly defined and neutrally applied.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ahmed v. University of Toledo'', 1987&lt;/ref&gt; It is, thus, permissible to require non-resident aliens who are legally present in the United States to have health insurance for instance.
* Right to protection from age discrimination
Age discrimination in federally funded programs is prohibited by the 1975 Age Discrimination Act.&lt;ref name=discrimination&gt;Age Discrimination Act, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; This act builds on the 1967 Age Discrimination in Employment Act.&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;''Cooper v. Nix'', 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adea&gt;ADEA, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Kaplan &amp; Lee, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bynes v. Toll'', 1975&lt;/ref&gt; It provides protection from unequal treatment between people of different ages from any explicit or implied distinctions which effect the benefits of participation.
* Right to equal treatment of student groups
''Gay Activists Alliance v. Board of Regents of University of Oklahoma'' (1981) found student groups are entitled to equal and unbiased recognition. Recognition includes the unbiased allocation of facility and equipment resources except when there is proof that a student group does not maintain reasonable housekeeping or poses a threat of danger, disruption or criminal action.&lt;ref name=henderickson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gay Students Organization of the University of New Hampshire v. Bonner''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Autonomy rights to free choice (26th amendment)====

* Right to personal autonomy
''Healey v. James'' (1972)&lt;ref name=healey&gt;''Healey v. James'', 1972&lt;/ref&gt; found students have the right to self-determination. “Students—who, by reason of the 26th Amendment, become eligible to vote when 18 years of age—are adults who are members of the college or university community. Their interests and concerns are often quite different from those of the faculty. They often have values, views, and ideologies that are at war with the ones which the college has traditionally espoused or indoctrinated.&lt;ref name=healey /&gt; ''Bradshaw v. Rawlings'' (1979) found that "adult students now demand and receive expanded rights of privacy in their college life".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

====Laws and court precedent on student contract rights====
* Right to contract rights
''Carr v. St. Johns University'' (1962) and ''Healey v. Larsson'' (1971, 1974) established that students and institutions of higher education formed a contractual relationship. Institutions of higher education are responsible to ensure that contracts, including those implied and verbal, are fair,&lt;ref name=bach /&gt;&lt;ref name=anderson /&gt; in good faith&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Beukas v. Fairleigh'', 1991, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and not unconscionable.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Albert Merrill School v. Godoy'', 1974&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to adherence to institutional documents
Students are protected from deviation from information advertised in the following documents: registration materials, manuals,&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=university13 /&gt; course catalogues,&lt;ref name=university9 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafferty; ''Ross v. Creighton University''&lt;/ref&gt; bulletins, circulars, regulations,&lt;ref name=rafferty /&gt; ''Ross v. Creighton University'' class syllabi,&lt;ref name=parkes /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name=penson /&gt; student codes,&lt;ref name=harwood /&gt;&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt; and handbooks.&lt;ref name=middleburry /&gt;&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt; These documents may be binding implied-n-fact contracts. ''Goodman v. President and Trustees of Bowdoin College'' (2001) ruled that institutional documents are still contractual regardless if they have a disclaimer. This decision found that "even though the college had reserved the right to change the student handbook unilaterally and without notice, this reservation of rights did not defeat the contractual nature of the student handbook."
* Right to fulfillment of verbal promises
''Ross v. Creighton University'' found that verbal contracts are binding.&lt;ref name=university3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafferty 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The North Carolina Court of Appeals in ''Long v. University of North Carolina at Wilmington'' (1995) found, however, that verbal agreements must be made in an official capacity in order to be binding.&lt;ref name=bowden /&gt; ''Dezick v. Umpqua Community College'' (1979) found a student was compensated because classes offered orally by the dean were not provided. ''Healy v. Larsson'' (1974) found that a student who completed degree requirements prescribed by an academic advisor was entitled to a degree on the basis that this was an implied contract. An advisor should, thus, be considered an official source of information.

====Laws and court precedent on student consumer rights====
John F. Kennedy's 1962 Consumer Bill of Rights, which is not a legal document, asserts that consumers have the right to consumer safety, information preventing fraud, deceit and informed choice, to choose from multiple alternative options and the right to complaint, to be heard and addressed. A number of these principles are enshrined in the law of higher education.
* Right to limited fiduciary care (institutional care in the student's best interest)
''Johnson v. Schmitz'' (2000) found in a federal district court that a PhD committee established for the sole purpose of advising the student had an obligation to advise the student in his best interest.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; This is a limited fiduciary right.
* Right to care regarding the safety of students
''Bradshaw v. Rawlings'' (1979) reiterated that where a special relationship is established, courts may impose a duty upon an institution or individual to ensure the care of others. Duty is defined here “as an obligation to which the law will give recognition in order to require one person to conform to a particular standard of conduct with respect to another person.” Institutions have a duty of care to ensure the safety of students while respecting their personal autonomy. ''Mullins v. Pine Manor'' found that "[t]he fact that a college need not police the morals of its resident students... does not entitle it to abandon any effort to ensure their physical safety”.&lt;ref&gt;White, 2007, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to a grievance filing process
''Dixon v. Alabama'' (1961) determined that when students' constitutional rights are not upheld, students are eligible to sue for damages in a court of law for monetary or material damages.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref name=rehabilitation17 /&gt;&lt;ref name=cooper /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Salvador v. Bennett'', 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hileah, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals may also file complaints regarding discrimination with the federal Office of Civil Rights (OCR).&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref name=discrimination /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Civil Rights Office Tanberg v. Weld County Sheriff'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to protection from injury on campus
A number of state courts have also found that institutions have a responsibility to prevent or make efforts to limit injury on campus from dangerous property and criminal conditions&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=schneider /&gt;&lt;ref name=white /&gt;&lt;ref name=miller /&gt; so long as injury is both foreseeable and preventable.
* Right to protection from injury in facilities under campus jurisdiction
''Knoll v. Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska'' (1999) found that institutions are responsible for ensuring the safety of facilities which are either under institutional jurisdiction or oversight. Institutions are, thus, responsible for institutionally owned dormitories and fraternities whether on campus or off campus and also for fraternities which may not be owned by the institution but are regulated by the institution. By taking on a regulatory role the institution also takes on this liability. Another state court found, that when students are not lawfully permitted to be on institutional property or in institutional buildings after hours, for instance, the institution is not responsible.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref name=laura /&gt;
* Right to protection from foreseeable crime on campus
Students should be safe from for seeable crime especially in light of past reports of crime, loitering or dangerous conditions.&lt;ref name=white /&gt;&lt;ref name=miller /&gt; Institutions are required to take safety precautions including the monitoring of unauthorized personnel in dormitories, taking action against unauthorized personnel when they pose a threat to safety and ensuring adequate security measures are in place.
* Right to protection from injury caused by other students 
Students deserve protection from other students over whom the institution has oversight including voluntarily assumed jurisdiction e.g.: clubs, sororities, fraternities, teams.&lt;ref name=white /&gt;&lt;ref name=university5 /&gt; This, for instance, includes protection from foreseeable or preventable fraternity hazing even if fraternities are not located on institutional property. The institution also has a responsibility to inform itself of safety risks existent in institutionally regulated programs.&lt;ref name=white /&gt; State courts have found that institutions are not responsible, however, for screening exconvicts before admission.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Eiseman v. State of New York'', 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

====Laws and court precedent on student employment rights====
* Right to protection from sex discrimination in the workplace
Students are protected from discrimination based on sex in any program or activity receiving federal funding except military, fraternity, sorority organizations. There are protections for both public and private employment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref name=title /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt;&lt;ref name=oklahoma /&gt; All employment opportunities must be merit based.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated&gt;EO 11375, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to equal pay for sexes in the workplace 
All sexes have the right to equal pay for equal work performed in the workplace in institutions of higher education. This would include student employment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated /&gt; This may suggest that transgender people are also entitled to equal pay in the workplace. 
* Right to protection from forced pregnancy leave
Women do not have to go on mandatory pregnancy leave before birth, and the right to doctor prescribed leave during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;PDA, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to the protection from sexual harassment in the workplace
Sexual harassment is prohibited in both educational and workplace settings&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"/&gt; and applies also to both opposite and same sex harassment by employees.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"/&gt;&lt;ref name=university6 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to active protection from sexual harassment in the workplace
The 1997 Department of Education and Office of Civil Rights Sexual Harassment Guidelines find also that institutions are liable for incidences wherein the institution was aware or "should have been aware" of sexual harassment and took no immediate action.&lt;ref&gt;see also ''Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education''&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of federal court cases involving educational institutions prohibit the maintenance of conditions which allow harassment by other students to continue.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref name=cooper7 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Williams v. Saxbe'', 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Franklin v. Gwinnett'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to protection from ability discrimination in the workplace
Ability discrimination in federally funded and private programs and activities is prohibited under the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act.&lt;ref name=southeastern /&gt;&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref name=university19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=henderickson8 /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981"/&gt; Individuals designated with a disability by a medical professional, legally recognized with a disability&lt;ref name=optometry /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt; and deemed otherwise qualified are entitled to equal treatment and reasonable accommodations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=rehabilitation /&gt; The Supreme Court defined Otherwise qualified as an individual who can perform the required tasks in spite of rather than except for their disability.&lt;ref name=hendrickson /&gt;&lt;ref name=southeastern /&gt;
* Right to protection from ability discrimination in employment recruitment
The 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act&lt;ref name=autogenerated16 /&gt; and Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act.&lt;ref name=rehabilitation11 /&gt; This includes ability discrimination in recruitment. Individuals designated with a disability by a medical professional, legally recognized with a disability.&lt;ref name=optometry /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt;
* Right to protection from ability discrimination in workplace discipline and dismissal
The 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act&lt;ref name=autogenerated16 /&gt; and Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act&lt;ref name=rehabilitation11 /&gt; in discipline and dismissal.&lt;ref name=southeastern /&gt;&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;&lt;ref name=university19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=henderickson8 /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981"/&gt;
* Right to protection from age discrimination
Age discrimination in federally funded programs is prohibited by the 1975 Age Discrimination Act.&lt;ref name=discrimination /&gt; This act builds on the 1967 Age Discrimination in Employment Act.&lt;ref name=adea /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Kaplan &amp; Lee, 2011; Cooper v. Nix, 1974; Bynes v. Toll, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; It provides protection from unequal treatment between people of different ages from any explicit or implied distinctions which effect the benefits of participation.
* Right to protection from race discrimination in employment
Executive Order 11246&lt;ref name=autogenerated15 /&gt; expanded upon the 1953 Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Order 10479,&lt;ref&gt;EO 10479&lt;/ref&gt; which established an anti-discrimination committee to oversee governmental contracting. The 1967 Lyndon B. Johnson Executive Order 11375&lt;ref&gt;EO 11375&lt;/ref&gt; also requires all facets of federal employment or federally contracted employment be regulated based on
merit – this includes institutions of higher education.
* Right to protection from discrimination based on national origin in employment
Individuals have the right to equal treatment regardless of national origin in employment settings&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IRCA, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; so long as they are citizens or resident aliens of the United States.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyquist /&gt; The 1986 Immigration and Reform Control Act also prohibits discrimination based on citizenship.

==European Union==

{{Empty section|date=June 2013}}

==Romania==
Romania is the country with the greatest student rights legislation currently in place.

==The student rights movement==
Students in both Europe and North America began calling for the expansion of civil rights and student rights during the Vietnam War era. They established legal rights by forming student unions and lobbying for institutional policies (thus, changing the cultural treatment of students), lobbying for legislative change on state and national levels and circulating petitions for the creation of national student rights bills. In America, for instance, students won the right to retain their civil rights in institutions of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon v. Alabama 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, this movement has been explosive. Students have banded together and formed unions in individual institutions, at the state and national levels and eventually at the continental level as the European Student Union.&lt;ref name="esu-online1"&gt;[http://www.esu-online.org/news/article/6064/97/ 2008 Students' Rights Charter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926185642/http://www.esu-online.org/news/article/6064/97/ |date=2012-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been instrumental in lobbying for rights in individual countries and in the EU in general. In 2011, for instance, Romania put forth an extensive national student bill of rights providing Romanian students with a hundred rights assembled in a clear and easy to access document.&lt;ref name="esu-online1"/&gt; Europe has also set forth legislation stipulating the rights of EU students studying in other EU countries.

European students have used the tactics established during the global labour movement of the eighteen and nineteen hundreds to gain labour or work place standards. They have unionized, stated their demands both verbally and in writing (sometimes in the form of a proposed student bill of rights), publicized their message and gone on strike.&lt;ref&gt;Beverly Silver: Forces of Labor. Worker's Movements and Globalization since 1870, Cambridge University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-521-52077-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the labor movement, workers in the United States, for example, won the right to a 40-hour work week, to a minimum wage, to equal pay for equal work, to be paid on time, to contract rights, for safety standards, a complaint filing process etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/table_labor Labor and Employment laws &amp;#124; LII / Legal Information Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; Students have, likewise, demanded that these regulations as well as civil, constitutional, contract and consumer rights, which regulate other industries, be applied to higher education.

The European student movement and the United States movement differ in a number of ways. These differences may be a factor in determining why European Students have been more successful in obtaining legally recognized student rights, from the right to access free education to the right to move and study freely from one EU country to the next, to the right to exercise their national legal rights in institutions of higher education.

Differences between European and United States student movements
* National student organization mandates: Different levels of student representation
The European Student Union ESU mandate requires the ESU to determine the demands of students and to convey them to legislators. The United States Student Association USSA also has a mandate to amplify the student voice in legal decision making but it does not stipulate how it will determine the student voice or ensure that it is representative of the students themselves. The ESU focuses on gathering input from students across the nation, creates a student bill of rights enabling students to critique it, proposes legislation to achieve these rights at both the state and continental level and then creates information resources so students know their rights.&lt;ref name="esu-online2"&gt;[http://www.esu-online.org/about/aboutus/ About Us]&lt;/ref&gt; The USSA, determines its objectives through the USSA membership. USSA does not seem to conduct research across the nation or to state student objectives on their website so students can express a desire to add or delete from this list. If the USSA does conduct research they do not show this on their website, do not have a search function on the website and do not publish this information for students.
** Currently, the ESU mandate is to "promote the educational, social, economic and cultural interests of students", to "represent, defend and strengthen students’ educational, democratic and political and social rights and "represent and promote the[m] ... at the European [continental] level towards all relevant bodies and in particular the European Union, Bologna Follow Up Group, Council of Europe and UNESCO."&lt;ref name="esu-online2"/&gt; The ESU will accomplish this by "conducting research", "campaigns", "conferences", "trainings", "partnership projects", "providing information", and creating "publications" for "students, policy-makers and higher education professionals."
** The ASSU's mandate is to "develop[] current and future leaders and amplif[y] the student voice at the local, state, and national levels by mobilizing grassroots power to win concrete victories on student issues. The United States Student Association Foundation ensures the pipeline of effective student leadership by facilitating education, training and other development opportunities at national, state, and local levels in advocating for issues that affect students." The mission statement does not say how they intend to do these things but it seems from the website that they hold grass roots lobbying, student conferences and electoral training, and propose bills to the US Senate.
* National student organization mandates: Publicity for student demands
The ESU clearly states student demands through the nation and through the EU. They have compiled these demands into a [[student bill of rights]], referred to as the 2008 Student Rights Charter. This document is not legally binding but it is a clear representation of all student demands. It helps students, institutions and governments understand what students are demanding&lt;ref name="esu-online1"/&gt; and also helps student unions, in individual institutions, lobby for rights which help change the culture and treatment of students on a local level. The ESU has democratically created a proposed student bill of rights they want accepted in legislation at a national and continental level. These demands include: access to higher education, to student involvement in institutional governance, extracurricular support and curricular quality standards. Each right has been broken down into more detailed demands required to achieve these rights. While student associations in America are pushing for this, there has been no centralized effort through the national student association.

USSA Legislative initiatives have included student debt forgiveness, enabling undocumented immigrant students to attend college, allocating more governmental money toward institutions and students but again these objectives seem to be created by USSA members without national research on the student voice. There is no way to search their website to determine if they conduct research to gather input form students across the nation.
* Institutional student bodies: A student union focus vs. a student government focus.

The European student movement and the United States movement also differ on a local institutional level. In Europe most institutional student organizations are referred to as student unions which suggests that they are engaged in lobbying for student rights. In America these are referred to as Student Governments or Student Associations and the focus is more on learning the democratic process. The problem is, however, that most student governments only have about 20-25% representation in the Academic Senate or institutional decision making body and far less experience in democratic processes than other institutional representatives. Student governments focus on teaching students how to be leaders and participate in democracy where as unions focus more on determining the student voice and achieving student rights through lobbying.

'''The Fund for American Studies''' is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Washington, D.C.]] Founded in 1967, the organization's stated goal is "to change the world by developing leaders for a free society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.tfas.org/Page.aspx?pid=1912|publisher=The Fund For American Studies|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TFAS is a conservative organization specializing in the free market. It has professional associations with conservative organisations like the State Policy Network and Charles Koch Institute&lt;ref&gt;https://www.charleskochinstitute.org/professional-education/partner-organizations/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://spn.org/directory/&lt;/ref&gt; and receives regular donations.&lt;ref&gt;http://conservativetransparency.org/top/?recipient=848&amp;yr=&amp;yr1=1987&amp;yr2=2014&amp;submit=&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Fund for American Studies headquarters.JPG|thumb|The Fund for American Studies headquarters located in the [[Dupont Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
In 1967, [[Charles Edison]] took the first steps toward establishing the institution that is known today as The Fund for American Studies. Edison was a former governor of New Jersey, Secretary of the Navy and son of inventor [[Thomas Alva Edison]].

Concerned about an eroding confidence in the American system of government, Edison recruited [[Walter H. Judd]], David R. Jones, [[Marvin Liebman]], and [[William F. Buckley,&amp;nbsp;Jr.]], to build a program that would educate college students about American government, politics, and economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frohnen|first1=Bruce|last2=Beer|first2=Jeremy|last3=Jeffrey|first3=Nelson|title=American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia|date=2014|publisher=Open Road Media|isbn=9781497651579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 6, 1967, the group incorporated the Charles Edison Youth Fund. In 1969 Governor Edison died suddenly. To honor him and carry on his mission, the organization was renamed the Charles Edison Memorial Youth Fund. In 1985 the organization was renamed again to its present-day title, The Fund for American Studies. In the summer of 1970, the Edison Fund organized the inaugural Institute on Comparative Political and Economic Systems. Fifty-seven students attended the first Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Messer-Davidow|first1=Ellen|title=Disciplining Feminism: From Social Activism to Academic Discourse|date=2002|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822383581|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The Fund for American Studies sponsors 11 collegiate academic programs. Nine Institutes are held each summer in Washington, D.C., the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Hong Kong]]. A tenth Institute is held during the fall and spring semesters in Washington, D.C., and an eleventh Institute is held in [[Santiago, Chile]], in January. The institutes combine lectures, coursework, internships, evening lectures, and site briefings at key institutions of national government.

In addition to its summer and semester Institutes, TFAS sponsors other educational programs and conferences for professors and students throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Programs|url=http://www.tfas.org/Page.aspx?pid=221|publisher=The Fund For American Studies|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it was established in 1970, over 4,000 students have attended ICPES. This Institute is intended primarily for students interested in careers in government, international affairs, public policy and academia. Students study the American political system and market economics and hold internships with places of political and economic interest such as [[Capitol Hill]], federal agencies, think tanks, political groups, or international affairs organizations.

The Institute was named in 1994 in honor of entrepreneur John Engalitcheff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Featured Supporter: John Engalitcheff|url=https://www.tfas.org/featured-supporter-john-engalitcheff|publisher=The Fund For American Studies|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Legal education in the United States}}
'''Trial practice''' is an upper level course offered in most American [[law school]]s designed to teach future [[litigation|litigators]] the fine points of presenting a case to a [[judge]] and [[jury]]. Unlike most law school courses, a trial practice class has very little discussion of [[substantive law]], and is focused on the practical application of [[public speaking]], [[narrative]], and using [[body language]] to communicate a particular set of events to the triers of fact. Trial practice also contains elements of [[strategy]], teaching students how to decide the order in which witnesses should testify, when exhibits should be introduced, and how to trap opposing witnesses into giving testimony that damages their side.

[[evidence (law)|Evidence]] is the area of substantive law most reinforced by a trial practice course, with students learning how to apply evidence law in a real-life setting, including learning when they can object to questions asked of witnesses, what objections to raise, and how to effectively present objections.

Trial practice courses may have a classroom component.  Also, trial practice courses will usually have an ongoing "lab" component where an attorney will instruct a small group of students on trial skills and assist them in honing their craft. Often, students practice against one another in [[mock trial]]s throughout the course; for example, students may be divided into groups of 4, with each group containing two teams who practice against one another in mock trials. 

Rather than a [[final exam]], the course may culminate in a mock trial with volunteer "witnesses".

'''Virginia Open Education Foundation''' ('''VOEF''') is a [[not-for-profit]] [[501(c)(3)]] [[corporation]] dedicated to bringing curriculum and [[education]]al content resources to the [[K-12]] students of the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] through [[open education]]. It was started and is currently directed by [[Middlesex County, Virginia|Middlesex County]] Public Schools Technology Director Mark Burnet.

==Stated mission==

* The mission of this non-profit organization is to bring curriculum and educational content resources to the students of Virginia. The manner in which this is accomplished will be to assess, fund and deploy materials and content held in creative commons.
* Delivery and collaborative tools and methods would be provided to educational institutions within the Commonwealth. It is not intended that this would supplant or encroach on the mission of other educational organizations, but to foster an interoperable framework for resource users of a license-free learning environment.
* It is the philosophy of this organization to support a service business model using [[open source]] content, [[computer software|software]] and systems. This philosophy extends to support global adoption of the best practices of this model as it supports facets of education.
* Methods and systems proposed by this organization must be reviewed and adopted in a framework of the scientific method.

==Virginia Open Textbook Project==

VOEF aims to establish a [[Creative Commons]] [[database]] of educational resources produced by private and public funding and aligned to the Virginia [[Standards of Learning]]. These resources would then be used by individual school systems through [[print on demand]] technology for paper [[textbook]]s and would be accessible [[Internet|online]] through [[content management system]]s.

Burnet advocates that switching to open source content would greatly reduce textbook prices for Virginia and would allow up-to-date content to be generated and distributed quickly. Because the content would be in the creative commons, [[private school]]s would have full rights to use the content, and would be able to modify it for their purposes before use. Also, because content would be generated within the state, it could be based on Virginia's own learning standards instead of those from states like [[Texas]] and [[California]], which are currently used to produce many of Virginia's textbooks. It is the view of the organization that educational resources and implementation would be greatly improved, giving children better access to content, including, eventually, online access. While the initiative is primarily focused on Virginia, all content would be free for use by anyone around the world.

==Legislative efforts==

In January 2007 VOEF worked with State Delegate [[Chris Peace|Christopher Peace]] to propose to the [[Virginia House of Delegates|House]] of the [[Virginia General Assembly|General Assembly]] [http://www.richmondsunlight.com/bill/2007/hj702/ Joint Resolution 702], which would form a joint subcommittee to consider open education implementation in the Commonwealth. This bill was eventually scrapped in favor of an [https://web.archive.org/web/20130311132951/http://jcots.state.va.us/2007%20Content/openeducation.htm Open Education Resources] advisory committee within the [https://web.archive.org/web/20010914230714/http://jcots.state.va.us/ Joint Commission on Technology and Science]. This committee first met in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] on June 20, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130129205845/http://jcots.state.va.us/2007%20Content/metcalmat07.htm JCOTS, "2007 JCOTS and Advisory Committee Meetings and Materials"]&lt;/ref&gt; Members were interested in lowering costs, providing materials to a broader group of learners, and speeding the process of content distribution via electronic delivery and print on demand.

For the 2008 session, a full subcommittee was formed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130129205842/http://jcots.state.va.us/2008%20Content/subcommittees08.htm, "2008 JCOTS sucommittee meeting agenda"]&lt;/ref&gt; An early priority was to unlock some of the production and procurement processes for school textbooks in both K-12 and [[higher education]]. To this end, VOEF submitted a proposal to Peace that culminated in work by the Virginia Department of Education to create [http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?081+sum+hb137 Virginia House Bill 137], which redefined textbooks to include all electronic versions so as to remove restrictions to paper-bound volumes. The bill passed unanimously in every vote, and was signed by [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] [[Tim Kaine]] on March 7, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richmondsunlight.com/bill/2008/hb137/ Richmond Sunlight, "HB137: Textbook purchases; permits local school boards to enter into contracts with publishers."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with VOEF, Chris Peace introduced two more bills in January 2009. The first, [http://www.richmondsunlight.com/bill/2009/hb1940/ HB1940], would authorize the establishment of open education resource centers. Such centers would be able to be either privately or publicly funded, but the legislation would expire if no funding is provided within two years. The second, [http://www.richmondsunlight.com/bill/2009/hb1941/ HB1941], is a proposal that would encourage educational materials produced by the state to be released under a Creative Commons license.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6289">'''Wendy Elsa Greengross''' (1925–2012) was a British [[general practitioner]] and broadcaster. ''[[The Independent]]'' called her "a pioneering counsellor and one of the leading figures in fighting for equal rights for the disabled and the elderly".&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/doctor-wendy-greengross-champion-of-the-elderly-and-the-disabled-8282866.html|title=Doctor Wendy Greengross: Champion of the elderly and the disabled|date=6 November 2012|publisher=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Wendy Elsa Greengross was born  on 29 April 1925, at 10 St Mary's Road, [[Golders Green]], London, the daughter of Morris Philip Greengross, born Moisze Fiszel Gringross (1892–1970), a manufacturing jeweller, and his wife, Miriam Greengross, née Abrahamson (1899/1900–1968).&lt;ref name="ONDB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bayfield |first1=Tony |title=Greengross [married name Katz, later Kates], Wendy Elsa (1925–2012) |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/106704 |website=ONDB |publisher=OUP |accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her father was mayor of [[Holborn]] from 1960 to 1961, and her brother [[Alan Greengross|Sir Alan Greengross]] (born 1929) was a leading Conservative member of the [[Greater London Council]].&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt;

Greengross was educated at [[South Hampstead High School]] from 1936 until she was evacuated to [[Berkhamsted]], Hertfordshire, followed by [[University College Hospital]], where she qualified as a doctor in 1949, and in 1952 won a [[Fulbright Scholarship]] to the [[Chicago Lying-in Hospital]].&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt;

==Career==
Together with her husband, Greengross ran a large general practice in [[Tottenham]], London.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; Opened in 1955, it was one of the UK's first group practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e8504|title=Wendy Greengross|first=Anne|last=Gulland|date=2 January 2013|publisher=|journal=BMJ|volume=346|pages=e8504|accessdate=26 November 2017|via=www.bmj.com|doi=10.1136/bmj.e8504}}&lt;/ref&gt; She particularly promoted [[family planning]], and they were the country's first GP practice to have a dedicated [[marriage guidance]].&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; Greengross worked as a GP for 35 years.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

Greengross received counsellor training from the [[Marriage Guidance Council]] (now Relate), and would go on to become its Chief Medical Adviser.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; In the late 1960s, Greengross started teaching pastoral care and counselling at [[Leo Baeck College]].&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt;

Greengross went into broadcasting in the early 1970s, joining the [[BBC Radio 4]] counselling programme ''[[If You Think You've Got Problems]]'', which ran for nearly eight years.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/15/wendy-greengross|title=Wendy Greengross obituary|first=Suzie|last=Hayman|date=15 October 2012|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=26 November 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had her own television show on BBC1 in 1973, ''[[Let's Talk it Over]]''.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

From 1972 to 1976, Greengross was an [[advice column|agony aunt]] for ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', but "felt the letters passed to her were more about titillation than education".&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

Greengross wrote ''Jewish and Homosexual'', published in 1980, by the [[Reform Synagogues of Great Britain]], which "led the way towards equality within the British Reform and Liberal movements".&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt; Greengross published several sex education books, particularly focused on more marginalised groups, such as ''Sex and the Handicapped Child'' in 1980.&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt;

Greengross was a founding member and chair of the organization [[Sexual Problems of Disabled People]] (SPOD), and a founder of the [[Residential Care Consortium]].&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt;

==Selected publications==
*''Sex in the Middle Years'' (1969)
*''Sex in Early Marriage'' (1970)
*''Entitled to Love: the Sexual and Emotional Needs of the Handicapped'' (1976)
*''Sex and the Handicapped Child'' (1980)
*''Jewish and Homosexual'' (1980)
*''Living, Loving and Ageing'' (1989), with her sister-in-law [[Baroness Sally Greengross]]

==Personal life==
In 1951, she married a surgeon, Alex Kates, and they had five children.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

Wendy is survived by her daughters, Hilary and Polly, sons Nick and Richard, and three grandchildren. Her son Trevor died in 1997.

==Later life==
Greengross lived for many years in [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]], before a retirement flat in [[Regent's Park Road]], where she died on 10 October 2012, of pneumonia.&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt; She was buried at [[Cheshunt]]'s Jewish Cemetery.&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt;

'''Young Actors Theatre Islington (YATI)''' is a [[drama school]] and community theatre based in the [[Islington]] district of London, England. The organisation also functions as a charity agency for children and young adults who wish to pursue a career in acting.

== History ==

The theatre is housed inside a converted Edwardian chapel on Barnsbury Road, and has been a home for the dramatic arts since 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peak|first1=Francesca|title=HomeArts Interview: Andrew Harries, director of Young Actors Theatre|url=https://www.mouthlondon.com/arts/interview-andrew-harries-director-of-young-actors-theatre/|website=Mouth London|publisher=Wet Dog Publishing Ltd.|access-date=2017-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325234214/http://www.mouthlondon.com/arts/interview-andrew-harries-director-of-young-actors-theatre/|archive-date=2014-03-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly the site of the Anna Scher Theatre, the building was reorganised and rechristened the "Young Actors Theatre" in 2005 in order to better accommodate the goals of the charity.

In 2014, actor [[Andy Serkis]] became the president for the organisation, serving in the capacities of both sponsor and ambassador on behalf of the charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brigstock-Barron|first1=Rory|title=Lord of the Rings actor appointed president of Islington theatre|url=http://www.islingtongazette.co.uk/news/lord_of_the_rings_actor_appointed_president_of_islington_theatre_1_3868144|website=Islington Gazette|publisher=Archant Community Media Ltd|accessdate=8 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319124811/http://www.islingtongazette.co.uk/news/lord_of_the_rings_actor_appointed_president_of_islington_theatre_1_3868144|archive-date=2015-03-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Youth For Understanding''' ('''YFU''') is an international educational exchange organization. A network of over 50 independent national organizations worldwide, YFU representatives work together to advance learning across cultures.&lt;ref name="about-yfu"&gt;{{cite web|title=About YFU|url=http://www.yfu.org/index.php/about-yfu|work=Youth For Understanding|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within each country's culture, YFU organizations subscribe to and operate under a common set of principles and standards that aim to facilitate cooperation and harmony.&lt;ref name=aiccb&gt;{{cite book|title=Agreement on International Cooperation and Consensus‐Building (AICCB)|year=2012|publisher=Youth for Understanding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, YFU exchanges approximately 4,500 students worldwide.

==Organization==
YFU conducts its exchange programs via direct contact between independent national organizations in over 50 countries. These autonomous organizations represent the international community network of YFU. Other YFU international activities are carried out by a volunteer International Advisory Council and a professional staff known as the International Secretariat.&lt;ref name="yfubrief"&gt;{{cite web|title=YFU in brief|url=http://www.yfu.org/index.php/about-yfu/yfu-in-brief|work=Youth for Understanding|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
YFU organizations around the world subscribe to a set of basic operating and philosophic standards that embody YFU’s commitment to conducting high quality programs.&lt;ref name=basicstandards&gt;{{cite book|title=International Basic Standards For Educational Exchanges of Youth For Understanding|year=2005|publisher=Youth For Understanding}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standards set the basic requirements that YFU programs must meet.

The umbrella body for national Youth For Understanding organisations across Europe is [[EEE-YFU]].

==History of YFU==
Youth for Understanding was founded by [[Rachel Andresen]]. In 1951 it was proposed to church leaders in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA]] that teenagers from Germany be brought to the United States to live with a family and attend high school for a year. As a result, 75 German teenagers arrived in Michigan in July 1951 and were hosted by volunteer U.S. families.&lt;ref name="about-yfu" /&gt;

{{Globalize/US|date=December 2013}}
The exchange program itself originated in late summer 1951 by the [[HICOG|High Commission in Germany]] as the "Urban/Rural Teen-Age Exchange Program".  Already in its first year it was supported by members of the [[Michigan Council of Churches]] (MCC) under the motto "Youth for Understanding". Within the next 10 years it evolved into two organizations YFU-USA and YFU-Germany.  The first "exchange" from the USA to Germany was a summer program with 30 US high school students organized by MCC-alumni. During that year, Germany became a sovereign country, and the US government stopped funding the exchange program with Germany, which continued as a not-for-profit activity between the two YFU organizations. In 1961/62, a one-year exchange program from the US to Germany was added with 6 initial students from the US.
The first exchanges across the Pacific (with Japan) and to Mexico were established in 1958, and South America in 1959.&lt;ref name="usahistory" /&gt;

YFU, Inc., the non-profit educational organization, was established in 1964, and the organization's offices were moved to [[Rosedale (Washington, D.C.)|Rosedale]] in Washington, D.C. in 1978.&lt;ref name=usahistory&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://yfuusa.org/about-yfu/history.php|work=YFU USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During most of the 1990s, YFU, Inc. served as the primary administrative organization for applications and interviews in the [[Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange]] (CBYX) scholarship program, overseen by the now defunct [[United States Information Agency]] (USIA). With the dissolution of the USIA toward the end of 1999, the CBYX scholarship program began to be reorganized on a regional basis, and YFU ceased its central administrative control{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}.

On March 8, 2002 YFU, Inc. ceased operations and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report No. AUD/CG-03-12|url=http://oig.state.gov/documents/organization/104030.pdf|publisher=United States Department of State, Office of Inspector General|accessdate=2014-07-14|date=December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The YFU organization in United States was reorganized as YFU USA Inc., which opened on March 9, 2002. The organization's offices were moved to [[Bethesda, Maryland]] later in 2002. [[Ulrich Zahlten]], founder and former chair of YFU Germany, became the new chairman of the board of YFU USA. This reorganization also reversed the organization's misfortunes; the annual report for 2005 reports four consecutive years of budget surpluses{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}.

YFU USA has five district offices: Founders, Heartland, Horizon, Northeast and Southeast. YFU remains a volunteer-based organization&lt;ref name=usavolunteer&gt;{{cite web|title=Volunteer|url=http://yfuusa.org/volunteer.php|work=YFU USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; as YFU USA has almost 1,400 active volunteers.&lt;ref name="usahistory" /&gt;

===Organization===
The guidelines for the work of the national YFU organizations will be decided by the International Advisory Council. The committee, which meets twice a year, consists of 15 representatives from national organizations.

Each year, YFU USA awards over 250 full and partial scholarships. Many of these scholarships are to Japan and Germany, which are among the most popular destinations for American students. However, new sponsorships, from both the government and corporate sectors, have allowed more scholarships to be awarded for study in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study abroad|url=http://yfuusa.org/study-abroad.php|work=YFU USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European Educational Exchanges – Youth for Understanding (EEE-YFU) is an international [[student exchange program|youth exchange]] [[non-profit organization|non-profit organisation]], founded in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.intercultural-europe.org/site/database/organisation/european-educational-exchanges-youth-understanding | title=European Educational Exchanges – Youth for Understanding (EEE-YFU) | publisher=[http://www.intercultural-europe.org/ Platform for Intercultural Europe] | accessdate=20 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the [[umbrella organization|umbrella body]] for national Youth For Understanding organisations across [[Europe]] and consists of 28 members.

The mission of EEE-YFU is to advance intercultural understanding, mutual respect, and social responsibility through educational exchanges for youth, families, and communities.

YFU was founded shortly after the end of [[World War II]], in 1951.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} It is one of the world's oldest education exchange organisations and currently{{when|date=July 2014}} has programmes in about 60 countries around the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Founded to allow young [[Germany|Germans]] the opportunity to experience another culture outside of their own, YFU organised for them to go on exchange to the United States in order to see what life was like there and to develop an understanding of [[democracy]]. Since then YFU has grown and now sends young people between 15 and 18 years old on international high school exchanges to other countries, where the students will live with and become a part of a host family.  National YFU organisations from around the world are all independent from one another. However, there does exist an International Secretariat in order to facilitate co-operation and communication amongst them on a global scale, and to provide them with support.

EEE-YFU is a member organisation, and its members are national YFU organisations in Europe.  Unlike the national YFU organisations, it is not involved with the actual logistics and organising of the exchanges.  Instead, it is a member organisation which focuses on representing the interests of its members in several different ways. In supporting its members, EEE-YFU has the following aims: to promote intercultural understanding through youth exchange programmes in Europe; to enhance the public visibility for Youth For Understanding in Europe and with [[Institutions of the European Union|European institutions]] and organisations; to enrich the experience of European exchange students by facilitating educational and content related activities; to facilitate co-operation and networking between member organisations and to provide membership services; to facilitate intra-European activities such as seminars, meetings and conferences on various topics; and to assist in planning and conducting international training for staff and volunteers.

The organisation has its offices in [[Brussels]], Belgium, where it works towards representing its members' interests at European level and to facilitate co-ordination between its national members.

EEE-YFU consists of a [[Board of directors|Board]], which has the ultimate responsibility for the overall strategic direction of the organisation, as well as the European Secretariat based in its office in Brussels. The Secretariat regularly has [[intern]]s and volunteers (often from the [[European Voluntary Service]] programme) working in the office.

EEE-YFU is an international non-profit organisation under Belgian law [[International association without lucrative purpose|(AISBL)]].

EEE-YFU works alongside a number of external organisations, and is regularly granted funding for projects and initiatives by European institutions and other bodies.  Its partners include the [[Council of Europe]] Directorate of Youth &amp; Sports, the [[European Commission]], the [[European Youth Forum]] and the Platform for Intercultural Europe, as well as many others.  It receives funding from the European Commission, the Council of Europe and the Belgian state, as well as other bodies.  EEE-YFU also works closely with other NGOs involved in the youth field, particularly in relation to organising activities.

EEE-YFU works in three main areas: Capacity building; [[lobbying|advocacy]] and representation; and knowledge building and networking.

The organisation fulfills its objectives by organising and facilitating educational activities to provide on-going education in cross-cultural issues to its students, returnees and volunteers.  These help to promote [[Cross-cultural communication|intercultural dialogue]] and [[youth participation]] for a wide range of young people across Europe.  EEE-YFU organises activities such as study sessions, trainings and seminars on various cultural and youth-related issues both nationally and on a European level.  In doing so it often works closely with its member organisations.  An important feature of EEE-YFU's activities is to encourage those students who have participated in exchanges to continue to be involved with YFU by [[volunteering]] once they return home.  This will help to continue the cycle of learning and will allow YFU to reach out to more young people.

EEE-YFU has its own "European Trainer Network", composed of 13 young trainers from 10 different countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.eee-yfu.org/ETN | title=European Trainer Network | publisher=EEE-YFU }}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides its member organisations with a pool of young people with relevant expertise and knowledge that they can use to organise and facilitate a range of events.  This aims to help to increase the capacity for multiplication of competences and knowledge within the international YFU network, and for contributing to the development of training structures of national YFU organisations to provide high quality educational activities. EEE-YFU also has a "Pool of Representatives", composed of 33 young people from various member organisations. The members are an important tool for EEE-YFU's advocacy work, representing EEE-YFU on various seminars, working groups, meetings, conferences and other events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.eee-yfu.org/PoR | title=Pool of Representatives | publisher=EEE-YFU }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following YFU national organisations are members of EEE-YFU:
Austria, [[Belarus]], Belgium ([[Flanders]] &amp; [[Wallonia]]), [[Bulgaria]], [[Czech Republic]], Denmark, [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], France, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], Germany, [[Greece]], Hungary, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Moldova]], [[Netherlands]], Norway, [[Poland]], [[Romania]], Russia, [[Slovakia]], Sweden, Switzerland, [[Turkey]], [[Ukraine]].
