The '''2011 Israeli social justice protests''' ({{lang-he-n|מְחָאָת צֶדֶק חֶבְרָתִי}}), [[#Naming|which are also referred to by various other names in the media]], were a series of demonstrations in [[Israel]] beginning in July 2011 involving hundreds of thousands of protesters from a variety of [[socio-economic]] and religious backgrounds opposing the continuing rise in the [[cost of living]] (particularly housing) and the deterioration of public services such as health and education. A common rallying cry at the demonstrations was the chant; "The people demand social justice!".

As the protests expanded during August 2011, the demonstrations began to also focus on other related issues relating to the social order and power structure in Israel.

The housing protests which sparked the first demonstrations began as a result of a [[Facebook]] protest group that initially led hundreds of people to establish [[tents]] in the [[Rothschild Boulevard]] in the center of [[Tel Aviv]], an act which soon gained momentum, media attention and began a public discourse in Israel regarding the [[Israel's housing bubble|high cost of housing]] and living expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Levin|first1=Jamie|title=Finally, Workers of the World Unite|url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/finally-workers-of-the-world-unite-1.391228|accessdate=18 December 2014|work=Haaretz|date=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, the protests spread to many other major [[cities in Israel]] as thousands of Israeli protesters began establishing tents in the middle of central streets in major cities as a means of protest. As part of the protests, several mass demonstrations have been held across the country, in which hundreds of thousands of people have participated.

A major focus of the protests have been what organizers have termed ''[[social justice]]''. Part of the movement is about changing the social order, and the economic system. Calls to topple the government were made by some parts of the protests.&lt;ref name="Sheafer"&gt;{{cite news|title=Scale of social justice protests surprises experts |url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=233324|work=The Jerusalem Post|author=Melanie Lidman|date=11 August 2011|accessdate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of the protests includes accusations of a political agenda rather than a social one with revelations of funding from specific left-wing individuals and organizations like [[S. Daniel Abraham]] and the [[New Israel Fund]].&lt;ref name="Abraham"&gt;{{cite news|script-title=he:חשיפה: המיליונר האמריקני דניאל אברהם מימן את מחאת האוהלים |url=http://news.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=821074|publisher=Channel 10 (Israel)|authors=Orly Vilnai and Guy Meroz|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=17 August 2011|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]] journalist [[Kalman Libeskind]] claimed that the spontaneous protests had actually been three months in the planning by [[Stan Greenberg]] and orchestrated by left-wing organizations and [[the National Left]].&lt;ref name=Libeskind&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/app/index.php?do=blog&amp;encr_id=79974780b5e0d394fddbd1a00f4f21d3&amp;id=2804 |script-title=he:זו המחאה הספונטנית הכי מתוכננת שראיתם |language=Hebrew|trans-title=The most planned spontaneous protest you have ever seen |date=2 September 2011|accessdate=3 September 2011 |last=Libeskind |first=Kalman |publisher=nrg.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism within the protests accused the 'protest leaders' of not publicizing specific goals, the lack of visibility of their goals, and the damaging impact of media focus being on a few activists.&lt;ref name="Moyal"&gt;{{cite news|title=Alternative tent protests cast doubt on 'social leaders' |url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=235436 |work= The Jerusalem Post |author=Ben Hartman|date=25 August 2011|accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the first large-scale protests in early August, the government announced that a series of measures would be taken to solve the housing shortage, some of which were already under preparation and ratification, and some which were new measures proposed in response to the demands of the protest movement leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/263/592.html חדשות – פוליטי/מדיני nrg – ...נתניהו: נאשר 50 אלף דירות]. Nrg.co.il.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] appointed a team of ministers and senior staff members from his office, headed by Finance Minister [[Yuval Steinitz]], to negotiate with the protest leaders{{Original research inline|date=August 2011}} as well as the [[Trajtenberg Committee]]. Since that time, there was significant criticism of the Prime Minister's perceived insensitivity to the public sentiment, prompting speculation that general sympathy for the protest movement may cause one or more members of the governing coalition to leave the government, triggering national elections.&lt;ref name="Azulay"&gt;{{cite news|title=Trajtenberg vote fiasco prelude to elections |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4130744,00.html|publisher=Yediot Ahronot Newspaper|author=Moran Azulay|date=3 October 2011|accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June 2012, Daphne Leaf and several other activists tried to restart the housing protests by re-erecting a tent encampment on Rothschild Boulevard. The municipality had not given a permit and as a result Leaf, along with eleven other activists, were arrested when they resisted the twenty policemen and municipal inspectors who arrived to dismantle the tents which were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TA protest: Police arrest social justice leader Leef |url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=274833|work=The Jerusalem Post|author=Moran Azulay|date=22 June 2012|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4245902,00.html |title=ynet צפו: דפני ליף נעצרה, הפעילים חסמו את הניידת – חדשות |publisher=Ynet.co.il |date=22 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000759406 |title=צפו: דפני ליף נעצרת במהלך ההפגנה בשדרות רוטשילד – גלובס |publisher=Globes.co.il |accessdate=2012-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815033906/http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000759406 |archivedate=15 August 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ynet.co.il (20 June 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Motivations ===
Numerous factors have led to the protests, in particular rising cost of housing and living expenses in Israel, but also various ongoing issues such as government corruption, rising poverty rates which the [[OECD]] defined as being twice the average of other developed countries, and a widening gap between rich and poor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2011/0815/1224302449821.html "Mass protests and tent cities shake Israeli government"]. The Irish Times (8 August 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographic structural factors, such as a large percentage of educated but dissatisfied youth within the population, extreme poverty in the haredi Jewish sector, and high unemployment in the [[Arab-Israeli]] population have spread the cause of the protests amongst a wide swathe of the Israeli population.&lt;ref name=Rolnik&gt;[http://english.themarker.com/11-reasons-why-summer-2011-was-momentous-in-israeli-history-1.387139?localLinksEnabled=false "10 reasons why summer 2011 was momentous in Israeli history"]. ''The Marker'', 28 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Many have also blamed the erosion of Israel's traditional egalitarian socio-economic model for the rise in public dissatisfaction, claiming that the rise of American-style social structures in Israel is incompatible with Zionist ideology(The word Zion does not exist in the referred article).&lt;ref name=American&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4130150,00.html "Say no to the American way"]. ''Yediot Ahronot'', 3 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major catalyst for public anger has been the significant rise in the cost of living, particularly for the lower and middle class. Although average salaries in Israel tend to be lower than those in the Western world, the cost of many consumer goods is relatively high – particularly basic necessities on which long established price controls have gradually been lifted. Since 2007, Israel has also experienced a gradual rise in housing prices. This increase followed a decade-long period of low housing costs, between 1996 and 2005, as well as a long history of significant government involvement in the public housing sector. According to data from the [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]], from 2005 to 2011 apartment rental prices rose 34% on average, 49% in the Gush Dan region around Tel Aviv. A survey published by the [[Housing and Construction Minister of Israel]] revealed that in 2010, 129 average monthly salaries were required for the purchase of an average priced apartment, an amount significantly higher than countries in the Western world.

=== Events leading to the protests ===
In April 2011, about three months before the cost of living protests began, [[Boaz Gaon]], son of prominent Israeli businessman [[Benny Gaon]], presented activists with a ten-point plan by Democratic pollster and political strategist [[Stan Greenberg]] to defeat the right-wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJvV7DSn2JU&amp; |date=March 2011 |script-title=he:כך יובס הימין לפי סטן גרינברג. פורום רובינגר |trans-title=This is how the right will be defeated by Stan Greenberg.

[[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]] journalist Kalman Libeskind suggested that the protests were a result of this plan.&lt;ref name=Libeskind/&gt;

During June 2011, a month before the housing protest began, another significant large scale demonstration took place in Israel. Commonly referred to by the media as [[the cottage cheese boycott]], this event saw the Israeli public protest against the high cost of many products in Israel and specifically in this case, the high price of cottage cheese. The protest was successful and led to a drop in the retail price of cottage cheese.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Charles. (1 July 2011) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304584004576417543687962906 Israeli Facebook Campaign Keeps Lid on Cheese Prices]. ''The Wall Street Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2023688/Complaints-cottage-cheese-prices-spark-protests-Israel.html A very middle-class protest: Complaints over price of COTTAGE CHEESE spark Israel's biggest demonstration]. ''Daily Mail''. (8 August 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time in Israel that a public protest organized by means of social networking had such a wide public effect in Israel.

In July 2011, 25-year-old Israeli video editor [[Daphne Leef]] had to vacate the central Tel Aviv apartment where she had lived for three years due to major renovations in her building. Leef soon found out that apartment rental prices in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area had skyrocketed. Consequently, she initiated a small-scale public tent protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4096185,00.html|script-title=he:המחאה מתפשטת: אוהלים בבאר שבע ובצפון|publisher=Ynet.co.il |date=17 July 2011|accessdate=24 July 2011|language=Hebrew|trans-title=Check spread: tents in Be'er Sheva and north}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leef opened a Facebook protest page, inviting others to join her protest, and pitched a tent in [[Habima Square]] in Tel Aviv. In response, protesters gathered in the streets around Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv, as well as in Zion Square in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4095171,00.html|script-title=he:מחאת הנדל"ן: שקי שינה בעירייה, אוהלים בכיכר|publisher=Ynet.co.il |date=14 July 2011|accessdate=24 July 2011|language=Hebrew|trans-title=Real estate protest: sleeping bags at City Hall, tents in the square}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4095726,00.html |script-title=he:מחאת הנדל"ן: "נמלא את כל ת"א באוהלים"|publisher=Ynet.co.il |date=15 July 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2011|language=Hebrew|trans-title=Real estate protest: "filled with all TA in tents"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[Protest camp]]s have been described by the protest leaders as being inspired by the [[Hooverville]] tent cities in the Central Park of New York City and in many other cities throughout the United States in which many Americans were forced to live during the [[Great Depression]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

The use of [[social networks]] for public protests began to increase in the early 2010s, with the most significant one being the [[Arab Spring|large-scale demonstrations in Arab countries in the Middle East]] that led to a change of government in several countries such as [[Egypt]] (see [[2011 Egyptian revolution]]). Some see a connection between the Arab Spring protests and the 2011 Israeli housing protests, as the common denominator is, firstly, the use of [[social networking]] to organize public protests,&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2011/07/israel-protests-spread-demanding-social-justice.html "ISRAEL: Is the Arab Spring spreading to the Jewish state?"]. ''Los Angeles Times''.

News.walla.co.il.&lt;/ref&gt; and secondly the fact that these two waves of protests stem from the increase in the [[cost of living]], that they were organized mostly by young people, and that the protesters claims include not only economic demands but also demands for changes in the policies and practices of the ruling government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/158680/egypts-workers-rise Egypt's Workers Rise Up]. ''The Nation'' (17 February 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cities and regions ===

;Tel Aviv
Tel Aviv has been at the epicenter of much of the crisis and has experienced ongoing protests every day from 14 July 2011 onwards. The largest protests were held in downtown Tel Aviv, which has been considered the protest movement's most effective symbol. Hundreds of thousands of people have been estimated to participate in the protests rallies in Tel Aviv.  By late 2015, the social protest camp in Tel-Aviv, near the Arlozorov train station, is the only one remaining in Israel

;Rishon-Lezion
Some tents were established at Rishon-Lezion's municipal park already in late July 2011.

;Jerusalem
{{Expand section|date=August 2011}}

;Haifa
On 13 August 2011 circa 25,000 people turned out to demonstrate in the [[Haifa]] downtown protest with leading local activists, deputy mayor of haifa, [[Shai Abuhatsira]] and chairman of the [[university of Haifa]] students union, [[Yossi Shalom]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Yagna, Yanir.

''Haaretz''.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Beersheba
On 13 August 2011 more than 20,000 people turned out to demonstrate in [[Beersheba]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

;Holon
There were approximately 10 illegally built shacks in Jessie Cohen neighborhood in [[Holon]], built by people from the lower class. On 7 September the shacks were evacuated.

== Continuation of the protest into 2012 ==
Even though the protest ebbed in late 2011, it was revived in 2012. From early 2012, plans were made by various groups to revive the protest. This time the municipality of Tel-Aviv made a preemptive move by warning about no tolerance for any tents being placed on Rothschild St., so tents were instead placed near the railway station in Tel-Aviv. This time protesters were divided in two major camps, as some activists criticized Leef for using upper class donors to finance her protest.

On 22 June 2012, Daphni Leef was arrested at a demonstration in Tel Aviv while her arm was broken. On the following day, her supporters held a massive demonstration where 85 protesters were arrested and glass windows of banks were smashed.

As a result of the split within the protest movement, two separate social justice demonstrations were held in Tel-Aviv on 14 July 2012, to commemorate the first anniversary of the social justice protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Lior | first=Ilan | date=13 July 2012 | url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israeli-demonstrators-to-mark-first-anniversary-of-social-protest-1.450795 | title=Israeli demonstrators to mark first anniversary of social protest | newspaper=Ha'aretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government reactions ==
The Israeli Prime Minister [[Binyamin Netanyahu]] initially reacted to the protests by stating that he is aware of the crisis, and that "the government is working to fix the plague that haunts us for many years. We are a small country, there is great demand and not enough apartments. Help me pass the reform in the Israel Lands Administration". Netanyahu also clarified that "It would take between a year to three years until we would begin seeing results."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=he:נתניהו על מחאת האוהלים: "מטפלים במצוקה בימים אלה"|url=http://www.mako.co.il/news-israel/local/Article-d8cde530a273131004.htm|date=17 July 2011|accessdate=27 July 2011|language=Hebrew|trans-title=Netanyahu protest tents: "We treat distress these days"|publisher=makoערוצי}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government housing plans ===
On 26 July 2011, Prime Minister Netanyahu announced a new housing plan, including significant incentives for contractors who build smaller apartments, rent-earmarked housing and student housing, and plans to add 50,000 apartments to Israel's housing market over the next two years. The plan would allow contractors to purchase land from the [[Israel Land Administration]] up to 50% cheaper if they agree to build small apartments. Contractors bidding on rent-earmarked housing projects would be obligated to rent out 50% of their apartments built for a period of at least ten years, at 30% of their current value, and would be allowed to sell the other 50% of apartments at a price they can set. Contractors would be allowed to raise rent rates annually, in accordance with the [[consumer price index]]. Contractors and land developers who build student housing would be given land for free, but would have to agree to government-supervised rent rates for twenty years. Netanyahu's plan also called for six newly appointed national housing boards to authorize housing projects with little bureaucracy. The boards' mandate would be reviewed every eighteen months. Netanyahu also said that the government would promote the construction of 10,000 housing units for students, and would subsidize students' transportation to allow them to seek housing further away from universities.&lt;ref name="new housing plan"&gt;{{cite news|title=PM announces new housing plan|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4100162,00.html|work=Ynetnews|author=Omri Efraim|date=26 July 2011|accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trajtenberg Committee ===
{{main|Trajtenberg Committee}}
On 8 August 2011, Prime Minister Netanyahu appointed a committee to pinpoint and propose solutions to Israel's socioeconomic problems. The committee's task was to hold discussions with "different groups and sectors within the public", and subsequently make proposals to the government's socioeconomic cabinet, headed by Finance Minister [[Yuval Steinitz]]. Professor [[Manuel Trajtenberg]], chairman of the Planning and Budgeting Committee of the Council for Higher Education, former head of the National Economic Council, and the former Chief Economic Adviser to the Prime Minister, was appointed to head the committee. The committee consists of 14 members, 10 of whom are government or public officials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=233085 Trajtenberg oversees first meetin...

=== Demands of the protesters ===
The initial objective of the leaders of the protest movement focused on reducing the costs of housing in Israel. For the most part, the protest leadership has declared that they would not offer any concrete solutions to the crisis on the grounds that it is not their role, but the government's role. However, the demonstrators in Tel Aviv have promised to work together with the Knesset members and other decision makers to promote legislation aimed at protecting apartment renters against exploitation of their hardships by landlords, in a way that would correspond to similar legislation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calcalist.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3524513,00.html |title=מפגיני הנדל"ן בתל אביב: נפעל לקידום חקיקה שתגן על שוכרי הדירות |publisher=Calcalist.co.il |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some of the public events, protesters call revolution, for Netanyahu's resignation, and the downfall of the government.&lt;ref name="Lior"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/1236548.html כ-150 אלף בני אדם הפגינו ברחבי הארץ; "המדינה מתנכרת לתושביה" – חינוך וחברה – הארץ]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in August 2011, as the protests grew significantly, the demands became more radical as they began to call for a sweeping overhaul of the [[Israeli economy]] and society which would change the current [[Neo liberal]] approach of the Netanyahu government to a more social approach. The list of demands for broader changes in the Israeli society and governance, articulated by protesters and activists, includes the following:

Many movements and organizations have joined the protest. According to the Israeli newspaper "[[Israel HaYom]]", two weeks prior to the protest, the Israeli social movement "[[the National Left]]" sought people on Facebook "who have unreasonable rent fees" to start a campaign to lower the cost of housing for young people. On the day on which the protest began, "the National Left" movement called its activists to get to the Rothschild Boulevard, and organized the delivery of 20 tents to the encampment. In an interview with the Israeli morning show "HaOlam HaBoker" the chairman of the movement, Eldad Yaniv, addressed "Israel HaYom"'s report and explained that the movement "organizes many protests like this throughout country and it just happened that this one became popular".&lt;ref&gt;[http://reshet.ynet.co.il/Shows/Haolam_Haboker/videomarklist,187816/ העולם הבוקר – השמאל הלאומי יצר את מחאת האוהלים]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007180806/http://reshet.ynet.co.il/Shows/Haolam_Haboker/videomarklist%2C187816/ |date=7 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several activists posted [[Daphne Leef]]'s call on the movement's web site and invited their friends to join the encampment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://activism.org.il/node/948#comment-937 בית זה אהל | אקטיביזם] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719174238/http://activism.org.il/node/948#comment-937#comment-937 |date=19 July 2011 }}.

The protest also gained support from the [[National Union of Israeli Students]] and the local student unions throughout Israel, who helped establish the encampments and organized transportation to the demonstration in Tel Aviv. The Jewish U.S.-based non-profit organization "[[New Israel Fund]]" gave guidance and logistical support to the encampments in [[Kiryat Shmona]], [[Be'er Sheva]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themarker.com/news/1.671269 הקרן החדשה תסייע במימון המחאה – חדשות – דה מרקר TheMarker].

The Zionist extra-parliamentary{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} group "[[Im Tirtzu]]", which initially supported the protests, later announced that it would stop its involvement due to the participation of the "New Israel Fund". The [[Bnei Akiva]] and the "Rannim" movements (both of the religious Zionism) announced that they would also stop their involvement in the protests in Tel Aviv. The "Rannim" movement later announced it would continue its participation in the protest but only in the Jerusalem encampment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerusalemnet.co.il/article/38429 עיר האוהלים הירושלמית מוקמת מול החומות – ירושלים נט].

The protests were also joined by "The Coalition for Affordable Housing" and "The Headquarters for a Liable Housing" who bind the following organizations: [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]], [[Bimkom]], [[Women Lawyers for Social Justice]], [[Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel]], [[Movement for Quality Government in Israel]], [[Greenpeace|Greenpeace Israel]], [[Mizrahi Democratic Rainbow Coalition]] and the [[Israel Union for Environmental Defense]]. Additional organizations who joined the protests include the Koach La Ovdim General trade union, the Socialist–Zionist youth movements [[HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed]] and [[Hashomer Hatzair]], the non-Zionist left-wing organization [[Ma'avak Sotzialisti]] the Israeli human rights organization [[Rabbis for Human Rights]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://rhr.org.il/heb/?page_id=4&amp;event_id=13 שומרי משפט – רבנים למען זכויות האדם] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823015442/http://rhr.org.il/heb/?page_id=4&amp;event_id=13 |date=23 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Physicians for Human Rights-Israel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acri.org.il/he/?p=14471 מאבק הדיור: חשש שהרשויות מנסות לרסק את המחאה | האגודה לזכויות האזרח בישראל].

The protests also gained the support of various Israeli mayors and local councils, including the mayor of Tel Aviv [[Ron Huldai]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calcalist.co.il/home/0,7340,L-3369,00.html |title=כלכליסט – דף הבית – הודעת שגיאה |publisher=Calcalist.co.il |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=2012-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122233255/http://www.calcalist.co.il/home/0%2C7340%2CL-3369%2C00.html |archivedate=22 November 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the mayor of Jerusalem [[Nir Barkat]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mako.co.il/news-israel/local/Article-8f84911717e2131004.htm חדשות 2 – ראש עיריית ירושלים: "על הממשלה לייצר דיור בר השגה"]. Mako.co.il.&lt;/ref&gt; and the chairman of the Union of Local Authorities in Israel, [[Shlomo Bohbot]]. Knesset members from both the coalition and the opposition have expressed their support for the struggle; some even visited the various protest encampments. Two weeks after the start of the protest, the chairman of the [[Histadrut]], [[Ofer Eini]], met with protest leaders and announced that the Histadrut would assist them in their contacts with the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000667958 עיני למפגיני האוהלים: "נשתף עמכם פעולה" – גלובס]. Globes.co.il.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jimmy Wales]], a co-founder of [[Wikipedia]], visited the tent cities in Tel Aviv where the protests were taking place. He said, "It's wonderful that in the democracy here, people have the right to go out and express their opinion. I do not know if I agree with the protest or not, because I'm not familiar with the economic and social situation in Israel, but the very fact that freedom of speech and discourse are free in Israel is remarkable."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=232838 Wikipedia founder visits Tel Aviv's tent city]. ''The Jerusalem Post''. (3 January 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Israel Fund]] had originally denied its role&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/141891/ New Israel Fund Alone in Funding Israel Protests]. Forward.com.&lt;/ref&gt; in the development of the protests, but in a January 2012 message, it says that the protestors "organized themselves in new and existing organizations, virtual and community initiatives, local and national groups. Mapping the initiatives, which were initiated by Shatil and the New Israel Fund, outlines the role of this 'big bang'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/new-israel-fund-comes-clean-on-role-in-tent-protests/2012/01/17/ New Israel Fund Comes Clean on Role in Tent Protests].

== Public opinion ==
According to a poll by Channel 10 on 2 August 2011, there is broad public support for the protesters, including 98% of Kadima supporters, and 85% of Netanyahu's Likud supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=819412|script-title=he:סקר: 85% ממצביעי הליכוד ו-78% מש"ס – תומכים במחאה החברתית|trans-title=Survey: 85% of Likud voters and 78% of Shas – support social protest|language=Hebrew|publisher=Nana 10|last=נדב|first=פרי|date=2 August 2011|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the massive support the housing protest has gained, as the protest kept developing and, various public figures and organizations, mostly affiliated with the political right in Israel, gradually increased their criticism of the protests and their organizers. Most of the criticism has focused on the allegations that the protests were not spontaneous, and that they were scheduled and planned by various left-wing media and political organizations in Israel. It is alleged that these organizations exploited the protests initiated by [[Daphne Leef]] as well as the economic distress that exists among large sections of the Israeli public in order to promote a political agenda that they finance, and which is primarily designed to overthrow the current right-wing government headed by [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]; it is alleged that finding actual solutions to the housing crises in Israel is only a secondary concern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/003-D-62157-00.html חדשות מחלקה ראשונה – News1: מחאת האוהלים: הקול של יעקב והידיים של עשו].

* Israeli minister [[Benny Begin]] also criticized the protests, stating that it is a political struggle "with speech writers", aimed at overthrowing the Prime Minister of Israel, under the guise of protesting housing issues which "did not develop recently, and which would not be solved any time soon".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.walla.co.il/?w=/22/1846369 מחאת האוהלים| בני בגין: יש גורמים פוליטיים המקדמים המחאה – וואלה! חדשות].

* On 20 July 2011, "[[Im Tirtzu]]" announced that they would not take part in the housing protests any more because they claimed that the [[New Israel Fund]] and various radical left-wing groups are directly involved in the housing protests. Officials in the organization stated that "Daphne Leef's struggle, who is perceived in the media as the initiator of the struggle, is actually a video editor working for the NIF and Shatil."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inn.co.il/News/News.aspx/223078 הקשר בין הקרן החדשה למאהל המחאה – בארץ – חדשות – ערוץ 7].

* In September 2011, Knesset member [[Aryeh Eldad]] said that 'there is no doubt that the extreme-left and post-zionists are funding the protests.

=== Religious figures ===
* The prominent Israeli [[modern orthodox]] [[rabbi]] [[Yuval Sherlo]] stated that in his opinion the protest movement has become anarchist in nature and therefore he personally finds it difficult to relate with it. He stated that the protest organizers need to change course: "After a big burst of justified pain and anger, without which the troubling issues would not have not been brought up on to the agenda, the protests have been exhausted". Sherlo stated that despite the wide public criticism raised against the Netanyahu government, "this government has done quite a few good things to promote employment, balance payments, and is responsible for the fact that Israel's macro-economic situation is quite good". Later on, Sherlo gave a speech in the movement's protest rally in Jerusalem in which he called on Prime Minister Netanyahu "to embrace these people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4105209,00.html |title=ynet מפגן כוח: 30 אלף "הכריזו עצמאות" בירושלים – חדשות |publisher=Ynet.co.il |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 16 August 2011 prominent Israeli [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox]] [[rabbi]] [[Israel Meir Lau]], who is the former [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi of Israel]] and current [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Tel Aviv]], held a discussion on the ongoing protests with representatives from the National Union of Israeli Students at the offices of the Rabbinate in Tel Aviv. Lau noted that the protest movement is unprecedented in Israel, and added that "this is the first time I remember ever having seen this many people who didn't know each other before, coming together – outside of a time of war. You have captured my heart." In addition, Lau promised to contact Prime Minister Netanyahu personally and tell him to honor the mandate of the Trachtenberg committee and accept its recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartman |first=Ben |url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=233988 |title=Ex-chief rabbi to protester...

=== Media ===
* [[Ben-Dror Yemini]], an editor at [[Maariv]], used his 26 August 2011 weekend column to report a strong left-wing turn of the protests that would attempt to connect the 'social justice' to the events leading up to anticipated September protests on the West Bank. Yemini revealed an agreement summarized after protest leaders met with left-wing leaders and anarchists including the heads of the National Left and [[Peace Now]] to discuss combining activities such as marches to the 'border' and to bring the Palestinians into the protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/app/index.php?do=blog&amp;encr_id=f2b4c1b55be76d1e6d7b777256ea0370&amp;id=2785 |title=nrg מעריב – בלוגים – - מחאה, הסתה והונאה |publisher=Nrg.co.il |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shay Golden, the assistant editor in chief of Maariv and former editor at the Haaretz newspaper has said that he has been made an enemy of the protests since he criticized the media coverage. He accused his media colleagues of forgetting their journalistic responsibilities and subsequently becoming spokespeople for the protests, and silencing opposing voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=827518&amp;sid=217 |date=6 September 2011|accessdate=6 September 2011 |script-title=he:שי גולדן על הסיקור התקשורתי של המחאה: "אנשים שכחו את תפקידם העיתונאי" |trans-title=Golden on the media coverage of the protests: "People have forgotten their jobs as journalists"  |first=David|last=Avraham|publisher=Maariv|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Yair Lapid]], a journalist and television personality who would later become Minister of Finance, has supported the protest since its first days. During the second week of the protest, he published an article in his weekly [[Yedioth Ahronoth]] column titled "The Slaves Revolt", where he sympathized with the protestors and implicitly blamed the Netanyahu government for its unjust allocation of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xn--5dbdmj5dhjq.org.il:80/index.php?title=%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%90%D7%AA_%D7%A6%D7%93%D7%A7_%D7%97%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%AA%D7%99|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120124011545/http://xn--5dbdmj5dhjq.org.il/index.php?title=%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%90%D7%AA_%D7%A6%D7%93%D7%A7_%D7%97%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%AA%D7%99|dead-url=yes|archive-date=24 January 2012|accessdate=4 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tenured''' appointment is an indefinite academic appointment that can be terminated only for [[Causation (law)|cause]] or under extraordinary circumstances, such as financial exigency or program discontinuation. Tenure is a means of defending the principle of [[academic freedom]], which holds that it is beneficial for society in the long run if scholars are free to hold and examine a variety of views.

The modern conception of tenure in US higher education originated with the [[American Association of University Professors]]' (AAUP) 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/report/1940-statement-principles-academic-freedom-and-tenure|title=1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure – AAUP|website=Aaup.org|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jointly formulated and endorsed by the AAUP and the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]] (AAC&amp;U), the 1940 Statement is endorsed by over 250 scholarly and higher education organizations and is widely adopted into faculty handbooks and collective bargaining agreements at institutions of higher education throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/issues/tenure|title=What is academic tenure?|website=Aaup.org|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement holds that, "The common good depends upon the free search for truth and its free exposition" and stresses that academic freedom is essential in teaching and research in this regard.

== By Country ==
=== North America ===
{{See also|Academic tenure in North America}}
Under the tenure systems adopted by many [[university|universities]] and [[college]]s in the United States and Canada, some faculty positions have tenure and some do not. Typical systems (such as the widely adopted "1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure" of the [[American Association of University Professors]]&lt;ref&gt;http://aaup.org/report/1940-statement-principles-academic-freedom-and-tenure; this statement has been adopted by more than 200 scholarly and academic groups (http://aaup.org/endorsers-1940-statement). The American Association of University Professors also publishes [http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/policydocs/contents/RIR.htm "Recommended Institutional Regulations on Academic Freedom and Tenure"].&lt;/ref&gt;) allow only a limited period to establish a record of published research, ability to attract grant funding, [[academic visibility]], teaching excellence, and administrative or community service. They limit the number of years that any employee can remain employed as a non-tenured instructor or professor, compelling the institution to grant tenure to or terminate an individual, with significant advance notice, at the end of a specified time period. Some institutions require promotion to Associate Professor as a condition of tenure. An institution may also offer other academic positions that are not time-limited, with titles such as Lecturer, Adjunct Professor, or Research Professor, but these positions do not carry the possibility of tenure and are said to not be "tenure track." Typically, they have higher teaching loads, lower compensation, little influence within the institution, few if any benefits, and little protection of academic freedom.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== United Kingdom ===
{{See also|Academic ranks in the United Kingdom|Lecturer}}
Academic tenure was eliminated in the United Kingdom in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/40/contents|title=Education Reform Act 1988|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-europe-does-academic-tenure-43362|title=Explainer: how Europe does academic tenure|last=Enders|first=Jürgen|work=The Conversation|access-date=4 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its place there is the distinction between permanent and temporary contracts for academics. A permanent lecturer in UK universities usually holds an open-ended position that covers teaching, research, and administrative responsibilities.

Research lecturers (where they are permanent appointments) are the equivalent in rank of lecturers and senior lecturers, but reflect a research-intensive orientation. Research lecturers are common in fields such as medicine, engineering, and biological and physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eui.eu/ProgrammesAndFellowships/AcademicCareersObservatory/AcademicCareersbyCountry/UnitedKingdom|title=United Kingdom, Academic Career Structure|work=European University Institute|access-date=4 May 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Germany ===
{{See also|Habilitation#Germany|Academic ranks in Germany}}
Academics are divided into two classes. On the one hand, professors (C2/W2 positions in the old/new system of pay grades) are employed as civil servants of the state and hold tenure as a highly safeguarded employment for life. On the other, there is a much bigger group of "junior staff" on fixed-term contracts, research grants, fellowships, and part-time jobs. In 2010, 9% of academic staff were professors, 66% were "junior staff" (including doctoral candidates on contracts), and 25% were other academic staff in secondary employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buwin.de/dateien/2013/buwin2013keyresults.pdf/view|title=buwin2013keyresults.pdf — BuWiN 2017|website=www.buwin.de|language=de|access-date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent research, teaching and management positions below professorship as an "Akademischer Rat" (a civil service position salaried like high school teachers) have become relatively rare compared to the 1970s and 1980s and are often no longer refilled after a retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/wissen/akademische-karrieren-manche-verteidigen-das-system-als-charakterbildend-/5942506-3.html|title=Prekäre Arbeitsverhältnisse an Universitäten nehmen zu
|language=de|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to attain the position of Professor an academic must usually complete a "[[Habilitation]]" (a kind of broader second PhD thesis), after which she or he is eligible for tenureship. This means that, compared to other countries, academics in Germany obtain tenure at a relatively late age, as on average one becomes an Academic Assistant at the age of 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206154130/https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-europe-does-academic-tenure-43362|title=Explainer: how Europe does academic tenure|date=6 February 2018|access-date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the "Juniorprofessur" position (comparable to an assistant professor in the US, but rarely endowed with a tenure track) was introduced as an alternative to "Habilitation". However, the degree of formal equivalence between a "Habilitation" and a successfully completed "Juniorprofessur" varies across the different states (''Bundesländer''), and the informal recognition of having served as a "Juniorprofessur" as a replacement for the "Habilitation" in the appointment procedures for professorships varies greatly between disciplines.

Due to a university system that guarantees universities relative academic freedom, the position of professor in Germany is stronger and more independent than, for instance, in France.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} As civil servants, professors have a series of attendant rights and benefits, yet this status is subject to discussion; for example, the question of relating professorial pay to performance rather than merely to age is now being considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170724064559/http://www.eui.eu:80/ProgrammesAndFellowships/AcademicCareersObservatory/AcademicCareersbyCountry/Germany.aspx#SecurityInThePosition|title=Germany, Academic Career Structure • European University Institute|date=24 July 2017|access-date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments in favor ==
Many argue, among other things, that the job security granted by tenure is necessary to recruit talented individuals into professorships, because in many fields private industry jobs pay significantly more. 

== Arguments against ==
Some have argued that modern tenure systems diminish academic freedom, forcing those seeking tenured positions to profess conformance to the level of mediocrity as those awarding the tenured professorships. For example, according to physicist [[Lee Smolin]], "...it is practically career suicide for a young theoretical physicist not to join the field of [[string theory]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Trouble with Physics]]|author=Lee Smolin|date=2008|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-101835-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Economist [[Steven Levitt]], who recommends the elimination of tenure in order to incentivize higher performance among professors, also points out that a pay increase may be required to compensate faculty members for the lost job security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freakonomics.com/2007/03/03/lets-just-get-rid-of-tenure/|title=Let’s Just Get Rid of Tenure (Including Mine)|last1=Levitt|first1=Steven|authorlink=Steven Levitt|website=[[Freakonomics]]|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some U.S. states have considered legislation to remove tenure at public universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/01/13/legislation-two-states-seeks-eliminate-tenure-public-higher-education|title=Killing Tenure|last1=Flaherty|first1=Colleen|website=[[Inside Higher Ed]]|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A further criticism of tenure is that it rewards complacency. Once a professor is awarded tenure, he or she may begin putting reduced effort into their job, knowing that their removal is difficult or expensive to the institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/01/07/study-links-tenure-criteria-long-term-professor-performance|title=Study links tenure criteria to long-term professor performance|website=Insidehighered.com|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alan Gerard Fletcher''' (27 September 1931 – 21 September 2006) was a British [[graphic designer]].  In his obituary, he was described by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as "the most highly regarded graphic designer of his generation, and probably one of the most prolific".

Born in [[Nairobi]], Kenya, Fletcher moved to England at age five, and studied at four art schools: [[Hammersmith School of Art]], [[Central School of Art]], [[Royal College of Art]] (1953–1956) and lastly [[Yale School of Art and Architecture]] at [[Yale University]] in 1956.

==Early life==
Fletcher was born in Nairobi, where his father was a civil servant.&lt;ref name=guard06&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: Alan Fletcher |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/sep/25/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries |newspaper=The Guardian |date=25 September 2006 |accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When his father was terminally ill he returned to England at the age of five with the rest of his family. He lived with his grandparents in [[Shepherd's Bush]] in [[West (London sub region)|West London]], before being evacuated in 1939 to [[Christ's Hospital]] in [[Horsham]].&lt;ref name=guard06/&gt;

He studied at the [[Hammersmith School of Art]] from 1949, then at the [[Central School of Art]], where he studied under noted typographer [[Anthony Froshaug]] and befriended [[Colin Forbes (graphic designer)|Colin Forbes]], [[Terence Conran]], [[David Nightingale Hicks|David Hicks]], [[Peter Firmin]], [[Theo Crosby]], [[Derek Birdsall]] and [[Ken Garland]]. After a year teaching English at Berlitz Language School in [[Barcelona]], he returned to London to study at the [[Royal College of Art]] from 1953 to 1956, where he met [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], Joe Tilson, [[Len Deighton]], Denis Bailey, [[David Gentleman]] and Dick Smith.&lt;ref name=guard06/&gt;

He married Paola Biagi, an Italian national, in 1956 (they met with a heated discussion about if orange and pink were a good or bad colour pair). He then took up a scholarship to study at the [[Yale School of Art and Architecture]] at [[Yale University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alan Fletcher's archive goes online |url=http://uk.phaidon.com/agenda/design/articles/2013/june/04/alan-fletchers-archive-goes-online/ |date=4 June 2013 |publisher=Phaidon |accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; under [[Alvin Eisenman]], Norman Ives, [[Herbert Matter]], [[Bradbury Thompson]], [[Josef Albers]] and [[Paul Rand]]. He visited [[Robert Brownjohn]], [[Ivan Chermayeff]] and [[Tom Geismar]] in New York, became friends with [[Bob Gill (artist)|Bob Gill]], and was commissioned by [[Leo Lionni]] to design a cover for [[Fortune magazine]] in 1958. After a visit to [[Venezuela]], he returned to London in 1959, having worked briefly for [[Saul Bass]] in Los Angeles and [[Pirelli]] in Milan.&lt;ref name=guard06/&gt;

==Professional career==
He founded a design firm called 'Fletcher/Forbes/Gill' with Colin Forbes and Bob Gill in 1962. An early product was their 1963 book ''Graphic Design: A Visual Comparison'' in [[John Lewis (typographer)|John Lewis]]'s Studio Paperbacks series.

Clients included [[Pirelli]], [[Cunard Line|Cunard]], [[Penguin Books]] and [[Olivetti]]. Gill left the partnership in 1965 and was replaced by Theo Crosby, so the firm became Crosby/Fletcher/Forbes.  Two new partners joined, and the partnership evolved into [[Pentagram (design studio)|Pentagram]] in 1972, with Forbes, Crosby, [[Kenneth Grange]] and [[Mervyn Kurlansky]], with clients including [[Lloyd's of London]] and [[Daimler Benz]]. 
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Architettura_alghero.jpg|right|frame|Architettura ad Alghero]] --&gt;
Much of his work is still in use: a logo for [[Reuters]] made up of 84 dots, which he created in 1965, was retired in 1992, but his 1989 "V&amp;A" logo for [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and his "IoD" logo for the [[Institute of Directors]] remain in use. In last years he designed the logo for the Italian School of Architecture "Facolta' di Architettura di Alghero", ([[University of Sassari]]). In 1962, he co-founded British Design &amp; Art Direction, along with David Bailey, Terence Donovan, which was later renamed Designers and Art Directors Association (D&amp;AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Back Story |url=http://www.dandad.org/dandad/about/the-backstory |date= |publisher= D&amp;AD |accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He left Pentagram in 1992, and worked from the home in [[Notting Hill]] that he had occupied since the early 1960s, where he was assisted by his daughter Raffaella Fletcher, Leah Klein and Sarah Copplestone, and worked for new clients, such as [[Novartis]]. Much of his later work was as art director for the publisher [[Phaidon Press]], which he joined in 1993. For him, life and work were inseparable: "Design is not a thing you do. It's a way of life." (quoted in his obituary in ''[[The Times]]''). He would continue working, even on holiday, drawing on a notepad with a pencil.

A book of his designs, ''Beware Wet Paint'', was published by [[Jeremy Myerson]] in 1994. Fletcher also wrote several books about [[graphic design]] and visual thinking, most notably ''The Art of Looking Sideways'' (2001), which had taken him 18 years to finish.

An exhibition of his life's work was displayed at the [[Design Museum]] in London between 11 November 2006 until 18 February 2007, alongside the posthumous publication of a book, ''Picturing and Poeting''. The exhibition went on tour in 2008. It was installed at the [[Ginza]] Graphic Gallery in Tokyo between the 9 and 31 May 2008, and was installed at the [[Pitzhanger Manor]] Gallery in [[Ealing]], [[West (London sub region)|West London]], between 14 November 2008 and 3 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designmuseum.org/exhibitions/2006/alanfletcher Design Museum exhibition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222221045/http://www.designmuseum.org/exhibitions/2006/alanfletcher |date=22 December 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He won the 1993 [[Prince Philip Designers Prize]] given by the [[Design Council]], was President of the [[D&amp;AD]] (Designers and Art Directors Association) in 1973 and International President of the [[Alliance Graphique Internationale]] from 1982 to 1985.  He was elected to the Hall of Fame of the [[New York Art Directors Club]] in 1994, was a senior fellow of the [[Royal College of Art]] in 1989 and became an honorary fellow of the [[London Institute]] in 2000.

The December 2006 limited-edition cover of Wallpaper* magazine featured one of his last works omitting his calligraphic signature in the compliments slip accompanying his completed work for he was too frail by then.

He died of cancer in London,&lt;!--according to The Independent--&gt; and is survived by his wife and daughter.

== History ==
Altmetric was founded by Euan Adie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stuart|first1=David|title=Research Information|url=https://www.researchinformation.info/feature/rising-metrics-need-go-deeper|accessdate=10 February 2017|date=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SK"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Luther|first1=Judy|title=Altmetrics – Trying to Fill the Gap|url=https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2012/07/25/altmetrics-trying-to-fill-the-gap/|website=The Scholarly Kitchen|publisher=Society for Scholarly Publishing|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hicks|first1=Diana|last2=Wouters|first2=Paul|last3=Waltman|first3=Ludo|last4=de Rijcke|first4=Sarah|last5=Rafols|first5=Ismael|title=Bibliometrics: The Leiden Manifesto for research metrics|journal=Nature|date=22 April 2015|volume=520|issue=7548|pages=429–431|doi=10.1038/520429a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously a researcher, Adie had already worked on Postgenomic.com, an [[Open-source model|open source]] scientific blog aggregator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=McIntosh|editor1-first=Joyce|title=Library and Information Science: Parameters and Perspectives|date=2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781466562028|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 2006. In 2011 Adie entered an altmetrics app into [[Elsevier]]’s Apps for Science competition and won.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://appsforscience.devpost.com/submissions/4138-altmetric/|title=Altmetric {{!}} Apps for Science|website=Apps for Science|language=en|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elsevier-announces-winners-of-apps-for-science-challenge-132995468.html|title=Elsevier Announces Winners of "Apps for Science" Challenge|last=Elsevier|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize money enabled Altmetric to develop a full version of the Altmetric Explorer, released in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.altmetric.com/products/explorer-for-publishers/|title=Explorer for Publishers|date=2015-07-09|newspaper=Altmetric|access-date=2017-02-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012 Altmetric took on additional investment from Digital Science&lt;ref name="Piwowar2013"/&gt; and is still a part of the group today, with offices in [[London]], [[Germany]], the [[United States]] and [[Australia]].

== Concept ==
A term first coined in the altmetrics manifesto in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/|title=altmetrics: a manifesto – altmetrics.org|website=altmetrics.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SK" /&gt; [[altmetrics]] (also known as ‘alternative metrics’) were developed to provide authors and other stakeholders a more comprehensive record of engagement with scholarly work, particularly that which takes place beyond the academy amongst a broader audience.
In order to do this, Altmetric tracks a range of online sites and sources looking for ‘mentions’ (links or written references) to scholarly outputs (which include journal articles, blogs, data sets and more).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.altmetric.com/about-our-data/how-it-works/|title=How it works|date=2015-07-09|newspaper=Altmetric|access-date=2017-02-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of the attention include the mainstream media, public policy documents, social and academic networks, post-publication peer-review forums and, more recently, Wikipedia and the Open Syllabus Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.altmetric.com/about-our-data/our-sources/|title=Our sources|date=2015-07-09|newspaper=Altmetric|access-date=2017-02-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data are tracked in real-time and collated in the Altmetric details pages, which provide a clickable summary of all of the online attention relating to a single research output.

== The Altmetric Attention Score and Donut Badge ==
Altmetric employs an algorithm to assign each item an automatically calculated score. Based on the volume and source of attention an item has received, the score is intended to reflect the reach or popularity of the research output. A multicolored ‘donut’ visualization is also generated to provide a summary of the sources of the attention that an item has received (red for news, light blue for Twitter, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.altmetric.com/about-our-data/the-donut-and-score/|title=The donut and Altmetric Attention Score|date=2015-07-09|newspaper=Altmetric|access-date=2017-02-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/ris/systems/altmetric/details|title=Altmetric donuts - Altmetric - Research Information Systems - Research &amp; Innovation Services -  The University of Sheffield|last=Sheffield|first=University of|website=www.sheffield.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Altmetric make the data available via the Altmetric Bookmarklet, a browser plugin, the Explorer platform, a cloud-hosted database, and [[Application programming interface|API]].

The sources include academic citations and academic platforms, patents, posts on [[social media]] and [[web forums]], [[Wikipedia]] artilces, users on [[Mendeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.altmetric.com/about-our-data/our-sources/|title=Sources of Attention: Altmetric track a unique range of online sources to capture the conversations relating to research outputs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many publishers, including [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], [[Taylor &amp; Francis|Taylor and Francis]], The [[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] Network and [[Springer Nature]] embed the Altmetric ‘Donut’ Badges into their journal article and book pages to show the Altmetric score for individual items from within the publisher platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://olabout.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-822263.html|title=Altmetrics|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/measuring-impact-with-article-metrics/|title=Author Services Measuring impact with article metrics|website=authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sites.jamanetwork.com/altmetric/|title=About Altmetrics on The JAMA Network|last=Network|first=The JAMA|website=sites.jamanetwork.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.springer.com/about+springer/media/pressreleases?SGWID=0-11002-6-1453458-0|title=Springer now sharing data from Altmetric on SpringerLink|newspaper=springer.com|access-date=2017-02-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrei Shleifer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|l|aɪ|f|ər}} {{respell|SHLY|fər}}; born February 20, 1961) is a [[Russian American]] economist and Professor of Economics at [[Harvard University]], where he has taught since 1991. Shleifer was awarded the biennial [[John Bates Clark Medal]] in 1999 for his seminal works in three fields: corporate finance (corporate governance, law and finance), the economics of financial markets (deviations from efficient markets), and the [[economics of transition]].

[[RePEc|IDEAS/RePEc]] has ranked him as the top economist in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html |title=Economist Rankings at IDEAS |publisher=Ideas.repec.org |accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he is also listed as #1 on the list of "Most-Cited Scientists in Economics &amp; Business".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.in-cites.com/nobel/2007-eco-top100.html "Most-Cited Scientists in Economics &amp; Business"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924034122/http://www.in-cites.com/nobel/2007-eco-top100.html |date=2015-09-24 }} ISI Web of Knowledge&lt;/ref&gt;  He served as project director of the [[Harvard Institute for International Development]]'s Russian aid project from its inauguration in 1992 until 1997,&lt;ref name="Shadow Elite"&gt;Wedel, Janine. Shadow Elite: How the World's New Power Brokers Undermine Democracy, Government, and the Free Market. New York: Basic, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; where he and his associates made Russian investments, and settled a lawsuit from the U.S. government for such a violation of HIID's contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/Article/1020662/How-Harvard-lost-Russia.html?ArticleId=1020662&amp;single=true#/.VyuOp-IrJD8]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born to a [[Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/9/29/was-shleifer-screwed-was-andrei-c/ The Harvard Crimson: "Was Shleifer Screwed? - Sure, he had to pay a $2 million settlement—but he also got mad loot from Harvard" By Zachary M. Seward] September 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Soviet Union]] and emigrated to [[Rochester, New York]], as a teenager in 1976, where he attended an inner-city school and learned English from episodes of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''.&lt;ref name=bhayani/&gt;  He then studied [[mathematics]], obtaining his B.A. from [[Harvard University]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shleifer/files/as_cv_5.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108193740/http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shleifer/files/as_cv_5.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, he went to graduate school in [[economics]], acquiring his [[Ph.D.]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1986.  As a freshman at Harvard, Shleifer took [[Math 55]] with [[Brad DeLong]]; he has said that the course made him realize he was not destined to be a mathematician, but the experience gave him a future co-author.&lt;ref name=bhayani&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2007/6/4/andrei-shleifer-and-j-bradford-delong/ |title=Andrei Shleifer and J. Bradford DeLong|last=Bhayani|first=Paras D.|date=June 4, 2007|work=[[Harvard Crimson]]|accessdate=2009-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shleifer also met his mentor and professor, [[Lawrence Summers]], during his undergraduate education at Harvard. The two went on to be co-authors, joint grant recipients, and faculty colleagues.&lt;ref name="Shadow Elite"/&gt;

He has held a tenured position in the Department of Economics at [[Harvard University]] since 1991 and was, from 2001 through 2006, the [[Whipple V. N. Jones]] Professor of Economics.&lt;ref name="Bombardieri2006"&gt;{{cite news |first=Marcella |last=Bombardieri |authorlink= |title=Harvard professor loses honorary title in ethics violation |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/10/14/harvard_professor_loses_honorary_title_in_ethics_violation/ |work=[[Boston Globe]] |publisher= |date=2006-10-14 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, he taught at the [[Booth School of Business|Graduate School of Business]] at [[The University of Chicago]] and briefly at [[Princeton University]].

==Work==
Shleifer's earliest work was in [[financial economics]], where he has contributed to the field of [[behavioral finance]]. He has also written influential papers on political economy, the economics of transition, and economic development, collaborating with his former colleagues in Chicago, [[Kevin M. Murphy]] and [[Robert W. Vishny]]. Their paper "Industrialization and the Big Push" was credited by [[Paul Krugman]] as a major breakthrough which ended a "long slump in development theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/dishpan.html|title=The Fall and Rise of Development Economics|author=Paul Krugman|accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With coauthors [[Rafael La Porta]], [[Simeon Djankov]] and [[Florencio Lopez de Silanes]], Shleifer has also made significant contributions to the study of corporate governance.

In recent years, his research has focused on the [[legal origins theory]] (also sometimes known as ''law and finance'' theory), which claims that the legal tradition a country adheres to (such as [[common law]] or various types of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]) is an important determining factor for a country's development, most of all financial development.

The Clark medal citation described him as a "superb economist, working in the old Chicago tradition of building simple models, emphasizing basic economic mechanisms, and carefully looking at the evidence.... A recurring theme of his research is the respective role of markets, institutions, and governments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeaweb.org/PDF_files/Bios/Shleifer_bio_1999.pdf |title=Andrei Shleifer, Clark medal citation |publisher=aeaweb.org |accessdate=2013-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530160752/http://aeaweb.org/PDF_files/Bios/Shleifer_bio_1999.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asset management==

In 1994 Shleifer founded with fellow academics—and behavioral finance specialists—[[Josef Lakonishok]] and Robert Vishny a Chicago-based money management firm known as LSV Asset Management. As of February 2006, it managed about $50 billion in quantitative value equity portfolios, though, according to the firm's website, Shleifer has sold his ownership stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyii.com/article.asp?PositionID=&amp;ArticleID=1020662&amp;p=33 |title=How Harvard lost Russia |accessdate=2007-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222354/http://www.dailyii.com/article.asp?PositionID=&amp;ArticleID=1020662&amp;p=33 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandal==
During the early 1990s, Andrei Shleifer headed a Harvard project under the auspices of the Harvard Institute for International Development (HIID) that invested U.S. government funds in the development of Russia's economy. Schleifer was also a direct advisor to [[Anatoly Chubais]], then vice-premier of [[Russia]], who managed the Rosimushchestvo (Committee for the Management of State Property) portfolio and was a primary engineer of [[Russian privatization]]. Shleifer was also tasked with establishing a stock market for Russia that would be a world-class capital market.&lt;ref name="McClintick2006"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/Article/1020662/How-Harvard-lost-Russia.html#/.V0mIqpF97nE|title= How Harvard Lost Russia|publisher= Institutional Investor|date= February 27, 2006|accessdate=May 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 complaints about the Harvard project led Congress to launch a [[General Accounting Office]] investigation, which stated that the Harvard Institute for International Development (HIID) was given "substantial control of the U.S. assistance program.”&lt;ref name="Wedel2001"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://janinewedel.info/harvard_cronycapitalismWSJ.html|title= Who Taught Crony Capitalism to Russia? |publisher= The Wall Street Journal Europe|date= March 19, 2001|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) canceled most of its funding for the Harvard project after investigations showed that top HIID officials Andre Shleifer and Jonathan Hay had used their positions and insider information to profit from investments in the Russian securities markets. Among other things, the Institute for a Law Based Economy (ILBE) was allegedly used to assist Shleifer's wife, [[Nancy Zimmerman]], who operated a hedge fund which speculated in Russian bonds.&lt;ref name="McClintick2006"/&gt;

In August 2005, Harvard University, Shleifer and the Department of Justice reached an agreement under which the university paid $26.5 million to settle the five-year-old lawsuit. Shleifer was also responsible for paying $2 million worth of damages, though he did not admit any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="Bombardieri2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/harvard-defendants-pay-over-31-million-to-settle-false-claims-act-allegations-reports-us-attorney-54649792.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Barristers' Ball''' is an annual event held at most [[law school in the United States|law schools]] in [[common law]] countries such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and the [[United Kingdom]].  It is generally a formal/semi-formal affair, often near the end of the academic year, conducted by the institution's [[Student Bar Association]] as a school-wide gathering.

The Expert-level certification program continually updates and revises its testing tools and methodologies to ensure and maintain program quality, relevance and value. Through a rigorous written exam and a performance-based lab exam, these expert-level certification programs set the standard for internetworking expertise.
&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title=Expert Certifications|url=http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/expert.html/|accessdate=31 July 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

The program is currently divided into six different areas of expertise or "tracks".  One may choose to pursue multiple CCIE tracks in several different categories of Cisco technology: Routing &amp; Switching, Service Provider, Security, Collaboration, Data Center, and Wireless.

== CCIE Requirements ==

CCIE candidates must first pass a written qualification exam and then the corresponding hands-on lab exam. Though there are no formal requirements to take a CCIE certification exam, an in-depth understanding of the topics on the exams and three to five years of job experience are expected before attempting certification. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/certifications/expert/ccie_rs/index.html CCIE Routing and Switching&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two test sets for the requirement for certification 
* Written Exam : Duration 120 minutes , 90 - 110 questions with multiple choice and simulation 
* Lab Exam : 8 hours Lab exam (One day), Previously, CCIE Lab Exams were two full days exams
Details: The CCIE Routing and Switching Lab exam consists of a 2 hour Troubleshooting section, a 30 minute Diagnostic section, and a 5 hour and 30 minute Configuration section. The format differs per track.

The eight-hour lab exam tests your ability to configure actual equipment and troubleshoot the network in a timed test situation. You must make an initial attempt at the CCIE lab exam within 18-months of passing the CCIE written exam. Candidates who do not pass must reattempt the lab exam within 12 months of their last scored attempt in order for their written exam to remain valid. If you do not pass the lab exam within three years of passing the written exam, you must retake the written exam before being allowed to attempt the lab exam again.

=== The overview of the CCIE Lab exam  ===  

The CCIE lab exam was first introduced in 1993 with a two-day test. As there was the overwhelming demand to CCIE, the waiting time for taking the lab exam was at least six months. 
In October 2001, Cisco updated the two days lab exam to one day by removing some of the testing measures like diagramming, IP addressing and troubleshooting.  &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title=Experiencing Cisco's notorious CCIE lab |url=https://www.techrepublic.com/article/experiencing-ciscos-notorious-ccie-lab/ |accessdate=18 Aug 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

When the CCIE lap test was two days: 
* The first day:  You should build the network by patching, IP addressing, configuration to terminal servers: it's the verification method of your performance about the whole layer 2 and 3 configurations. Before the end of the day about 5:15 pm, the proctor would mark your capability, and decide whether you are able to attend the second-day lab exam by passing 80% pass mark on the first day.  &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title=On my CCIE Lab Exam in 2001 – Day One |url=https://etherealmind.com/passing-my-ccie-exam-in-2001-part-1/ |accessdate=19 Aug 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

* The second day:  You would receive another paper that covered more configuration for your tasks during the morning session. 
To configure the devices correctly, you should be aware of the core technologies, 
There are various hazards which you should understand the basic networking knowledge including practical experience.  The Proctor would observe your process and let you know whether you can attend the afternoon exam session for the troubleshooting field before the end of the day. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title=On my CCIE Lab Exam in 2001 – Day Two |url=https://etherealmind.com/passing-my-ccie-exam-in-2001-part-2/ |accessdate=19 Aug 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The current CCIE exam consists of eight hours within a day.  &lt;ref&gt;  {{cite web|title=CCIE R&amp;S Lab Exam Overview  |url=https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/ccie_routing_switching/lab_exam_v5  |accessdate=19 Aug 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;   &lt;ref&gt;  {{cite web|title=CCIE Routing and Switching - Lab Exam  |url=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/expert/ccie-routing-switching.html  |accessdate=19 Aug 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;  

* There are three sections for the lab test. 
* The troubleshooting module, the diagnostic module and the configuration module.
* The process of lab examination ensures evaluations of the capabilities to the understanding of the essence networking knowledge of the candidates.
You would receive the result of the lab exam within 48 hours. The failing score reports incorporate the details of your mark on the primary topic ranges. If you pass your lab exam, you will receive the pass result without the details of the statement.

== Tracks of Expert Certification ==
There are seven tracks of Expert Level certifications. It was designed for the requirement of the industry. It was updated over time, and the latest tracks should be verified on CCIE official website.  

* CCDE : The expert-level network design engineers who is capable of translating business needs, budget, and operational constraints into the design of a converged solution.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/expert/ccde.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* CCIE Routing &amp; Switching: The most popular CCIE track. The expert-level network engineers who can plan, operate and troubleshoot complex, converged network infrastructure. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/expert/ccie-routing-switching.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* CCIE Collaboration: Suitable expert level for the Collaboration Architects, Unified Communications Architects, or Voice and Video Network Managers &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/expert/ccie-collaboration.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* CCIE Data Center: Expert of the planning, design, implementation and management of complex, modern IT data center infrastructure. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/expert/ccie-data-center.html &lt;/ref&gt;

* CCIE Service Provider: The expert-level ISP (Internet Service Provider) network engineers who bring the knowledge and skill to build an extensible Service Provider infrastructure to deliver rich managed services &lt;ref&gt; http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/expert/ccie-service-provider.html &lt;/ref&gt;
* CCIE Wireless:  The expert who is able to demonstrate broad theoretical knowledge of wireless networking and a solid understanding of wireless local area networking (WLAN) technologies from Cisco.  &lt;ref&gt; http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/expert/ccie-wireless.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== CCIE Emeritus ==
Active CCIE holders are able to apply for CCIE Emeritus status when they pass their ten year anniversary of CCIE certification.
* CCIE Emeritus status generally applies to those that have moved out of "day to day" network and technical work but would like to stay involved in the CCIE program serving as ambassadors to current and future CCIE program.
* CCIE Emeritus status is a non-active CCIE holder but candidates are recognized for technical proficiency and long term status within the CCIE program.
* CCIE Emeritus holders have the opportunity to re-enter active CCIE status by taking any current CCIE-level written exam. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/expert/ccie-program/emeritus.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continuing Education Program ==
The Continuing Education Program is alternative way of re-certification for the CCIE license instead of passing the written exam. 
This program is managed according to three core principles: Flexibility, Diversity and Integrity. 
* Flexibility: Allowing individuals a wide range of options for the re-certification
* Diversity: Several options of training: online courses, instructor-led training and authoring of content
* Integrity: Achieved by having Cisco authorized content providers with re-certification requirements validate the credits submitted by that individual &lt;ref&gt;https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/cisco-continuing-education-program&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relevance to real-world situations ==
Regarding a new approach to networking with software-defined networking,
there are some critics about CCIE certifications that challenge corner-case scenarios of written and lab exams.  
However, the principle of networking is still the same and a router or a switch is a physical device or just a piece of software, the fundamental networking operations remain the same in the real-world internetworking. CCIE holders are still relevant to the software-defined networking era. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.networkworld.com/article/3097523/careers/plea-to-cisco-ccie-routing-and-switching-written-exam-needs-to-be-fixed.html &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12805">'''Canadian Accredited Independent Schools''' ('''CAIS''') is a national organization for independent schools in [[Canada]]. The Canadian Association of Independent Schools (also known as CAIS) was established in 1981 as a national network for member schools supporting collaborative initiatives in leadership, education, management and governance. Its key activities included organizing, co-ordinating, and facilitating conferences, benchmarking, senior management compensation surveys, and advocacy. 

In parallel, the '''Canadian Educational Standards Institute''' (CESI) was established in 1986 as an organization to develop and promote educational excellence and school improvement in independent schools. Its key activities were to establish national Standards/Best Practices and accreditation process, conducting 10 accreditation visits per year, and research and targeted Professional Development. In October 2009, votes were held at the Annual General Meetings for '''CAIS''' and '''CESI''' to create a new national organization, and after extensive consultation with membership, the organization changed its name to '''Standards in Excellence and Learning''' (SEAL Canada). However, in February 2011, the organization changed its name to '''Canadian Accredited Independent Schools''' (CAIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/canadian-independent-school-organization-changes-name-507726671.html|title=Canadian Independent School Organization Changes Name|date=22 Feb 2011|agency=Canada Newswire}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.cais.ca/ '''Canadian Accredited Independent Schools'''] '''(CAIS)''' in February 2011. Until 

==CAIS Accredited Schools==
CAIS encompasses 91 accredited independent schools, and its aim is to collaborate in the pursuit of exemplary leadership training, research and international standards of educational excellence. The stated vision of the organization is to be "the voice of excellence in learning and leadership, we shape the future of education in Canada and the world."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cais.ca/about-cais/mission-vision-values Mission, Vision and Values], CAIS website.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the CAIS website, there are two CAIS-accredited schools in [[Bermuda]] and one in [[Switzerland]].

Previous to his assumption of the Bates presidency, he was the deputy administrator of the U.S. [[Office of Price Administration]] from March 1937 to July 1941.

Upon being elected the youngest president in Bates history at 34, he increased the student body to 1,004, created the college's [[Study abroad in the United States|study-abroad]] program, and added $5 million to the endowment, more than quadrupling it. At his death he left $9 million to the college in his [[will and testament]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was known for employing economic principles of [[Competition law|competition]] and [[market share]] when dealing with students which ultimately lead him to be successful institutionally but unpopular with students.

== Early life and career ==
Phillips was born in Nelson, [[Pennsylvania]] on May 25, 1910.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from [[Colgate University]] and a Ph.D. from [[Harvard University]]. Phillips then went on to teach, research, and write as an economics professor at Colgate. He served as the deputy administrator in the United States Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supplies from March 10, 1937 to July 1, 1941.

He was a full professor at Colgate and a leading economist before coming to Bates.

At age 34, Phillips became the fourth president of [[Bates College]], on March 1, 1944.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://www.bates.edu/past-presidents/bates-college-presidents/charles-franklin-phillips/&lt;/ref&gt; As president, Phillips initiated the core study program and 3/4 option allowing students to graduate in three years. He also initiated the study abroad program, oversaw the construction of many new buildings at Bates, and had the college's observatory demolished. He is known for initiating the Bates academic program of Education, championing the most traditional strength of the Bates: the liberal arts which featured a core curriculum of liberal arts. He also championed "3/4 option,” permitting a three-year degree from Bates. Phillips expanded the campus with the additions of Memorial Commons (now known as [[Campus of Bates College|Chase Hall]]), Health Center, [[Campus of Bates College|Dana Chemistry Hall]], [[Lane Hall]], [[Campus of Bates College|Page Hall]], and [[Campus of Bates College|Schaeffer Theater]].&lt;ref name="bates.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Charles F.

== Death and legacy ==
Charles Franklin Phillips died on March 3, 1998 in [[Auburn, Maine|Auburn]], Maine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bates.edu/past-presidents/bates-college-presidents/charles-franklin-phillips/|title=Charles Franklin Phillips {{!}} Past Presidents {{!}} Bates College|website=www.bates.edu|access-date=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his death, he and his wife, Evelyn, left $9,000,000 to Bates in his will and testament. This bequest was used to fund the Phillips Fellowships, which are granted to students for research abroad. Phillip's donation is believed to be the largest bequest by an American college president to a college that he did not attend.&lt;ref name="bates.edu"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2406">'''Cognitive strategies''' are the specific methods that people use to [[Problem solving|solve problems]], including all sorts of reasoning, planning, arithmetic, etc. Importantly, a cognitive strategy need not be all "in the head", but will almost always interact with various aspects of what might be called the "execution context".

==Examples==

A commonly used and elegant example of cognitive strategies comes from small-number addition.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R. (1990) The adaptive character of thought. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous different ways (i.e., different strategies) by which one can get the sum of two (let's say) one digit numbers, for example 3+4 (=7). The way that most adults would solve this problem is by simply remembering the answer (a "memory" strategy), but a toddler would probably use one of a number of different finger-counting strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Siegler, R.S., &amp; Shipley, C. (1995). Variation, selection, and cognitive change. In T. Simon &amp; G. Halford (Eds.), Developing cognitive competence: New approaches to process modeling (pp. 31–76). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one can represent the first addend (3) on one's left hand by raising three fingers, and then do the same with four fingers on the right hand, and then count up the number of fingers that are raised. But there are many other ways to do this. For example, one can do the same first step (raise three fingers on one's left hand), and then start counting from 4 as one raises four more fingers one at a time on either the right hand, or even starting from the fourth finger on the left hand (which would require continuing from 6 on the right hand). Different strategies may have very different characteristics in terms of their time and space complexity, memory requirements, etc., and therefore in terms of their error characteristics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6291">The '''Commissioner's Academic Challenge''' (CAC) is Florida's statewide [[high school]] [[quiz bowl]]-like academic tournament. It has been held at the [[Grand Floridian Resort]] in [[Walt Disney World]]  each spring, usually in April, since 2015 (previously, it was held at the [[Contemporary Resort]]). Each [[List of school districts in Florida|county school board in Florida]] is asked to send a team composed of six high school students. Participating counties are separated into three divisions based on their full-time enrollment numbers for grades 9-12.

== Tournament Format ==

Teams compete in up to four untimed matches, with each match consisting of 1) the 5-point question round of 20 "Button" questions, followed by a 10-point Team Question, 2) the 10-point question round of 20 "Button" questions, followed by a 20-point Team Question, and 3) the 15-point round of 25 "Button" questions followed by a 30-point Team Question. '''Button questions''' are quick-response toss-ups, answered by only one team, with correct answers earning points and incorrect answers losing points. The '''Team Questions''' are written worksheets, completed by each team, requiring several minutes to complete. Teams earn points for each correct answer, and are not subject to losing points for incorrect answers as they are in Button questions. The questions asked become progressively harder in each round and cover a variety of fields including English, math, science, social studies, art, music, foreign language (French and Spanish), technology, and multi-subject.  The questions take a variety of forms, such as matching, multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and free response.

Only four players may compete during a given round, but coaches are allowed to make substitutions between rounds.  Most matches feature somewhere between four and six teams competing at the same time.  A panel of judges is present in each competition room to deliberate if a challenge is declared by a team. These judges are experts in their field of study. A '''Reader''' reads most of the questions, aloud, to all the teams in the competition. Some questions, such as foreign language, music, art and physics are written and are distributed on handouts, simultaneously, to all participants. Others, such as music, are played as audio tracks, and some, such as foreign language are displayed as video tracks. A '''Coordinating Judge''' manages the competition in the match, which, although untimed, generally runs about two hours.

The CAC is unlike many other [[quizbowl]] tournaments in that it is a slower-paced, more team-oriented competition.  Team members are allowed to converse with each other at all times, and instead of having individual buzzers, each team is provided with only one or two buzzers that they must share.  The CAC also differs from most tournaments in that there is no "rebounding."  This means that once a team has buzzed in on a question, that question is finished regardless of whether the team gave a correct or incorrect response.

== Awards and Prizes ==

At the conclusion of the tournament, the top three teams in each division receive rings from Herff Jones, while the championship and second place teams also receive trophies and medallions from the [[Florida High School Athletic Association]].

In addition, one winning player from each of the three championship counties, and three other players selected "at large," are chosen to serve on Team Florida, which competes at the [[National Tournament of Academic Excellence]] in June.

== History of CAC ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10258">The '''Core Curriculum''' was originally developed as the main curriculum used by [[Columbia University]]'s [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]] in 1919. Today, customized versions of the Core Curriculum are also completed by students in the [[Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Engineering and Applied Science]] and the [[Columbia University School of General Studies|School of General Studies]] (the other two undergraduate colleges of Columbia University).

The curriculum began in 1919 with "Contemporary Civilization", about the origins of [[western culture|western civilization]]. It became the framework for many similar educational models throughout the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=sage&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Educational Reform and Dissent|author1=Thomas J.

A major addition to the core was made in the 2000s, when a science literacy course was added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Vision of Transdisciplinarity: Laying Foundations for a World Knowledge Dialogue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MbC45UX_4gMC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=Core+Curriculum+Columbia+College+1917&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Core%20Curriculum%20Columbia%20College%201917&amp;f=false|author1=Frédéric Darbellay |author2=Moira Cockell |author3=Jerome Billotte |publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=2008|ISBN=978-1-4200-9228-8|pages=152, 153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Original intentions===
US universities, including [[Harvard]], had seen a trend towards more elective programs during the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=stand/&gt; Columbia's president [[Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard]] supported this trend, but his stance lost ground at the College over the following decades.&lt;ref name=stand&gt;{{cite book|title=Stand, Columbia : a history of Columbia University in the city of New York, 1754-2004|author=Robert A.

The changes were first initiated in the 1880s with the inclusion of courses in study of a ''modern language''. This change, along with a latter change in campus location preceding [[World War I]] set the stage for a major change in curricula focus after the war. The "Contemporary Civilization" course of the time has also been described as a direct response to the US entry into the war, seeking to encourage US involvement by stressing the importance of Western civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Henry James on culture: collected essays on politics and the American social scene|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2DPMMFceqQwC&amp;pg=PR22&amp;dq=Columbia+college+core++world+war+james&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Columbia%20college%20core%20%20world%20war%20james&amp;f=false|author1=Henry James |author2=Pierre A. Walker |page=xxii|publisher=[[University of Nebraska]] Press|year=1999|ISBN=978-0-8032-2589-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its persistence has been attributed to the College's wish to retain authority and autonomy with regard to the university's more specialized graduate programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Changing the subject: how the women of Columbia shaped the way we think|author=Rosalind Rosenberg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X3stnfg-IpQC&amp;pg=PA273&amp;dq=Columbia+college+core+european+universities&amp;cd=15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|page=273|ISBN=978-0-231-12644-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes to the Core===
In the later half of the 20th century US universities moved towards a more elective system. Some historians see the change as a response to social activism&lt;ref name=sage/&gt; - the civil rights, feminist, and various other social movements saw the core curriculum as an inflexible way to promote the canon of "dead white males" and as a failure to acknowledge the essential contributions of other global cultures. Others interpret it as a concession to increasing calls for earlier specialization to prepare students for post-graduate scientific and professional studies.&lt;ref name=sage/&gt;

The Core Curriculum at Columbia has been extended to consider "Major Cultures" as well as greater depth of study in art and music. While Columbia has maintained its Core Curriculum, other undergraduate institutions have either abandoned or modified similar approaches, turning from a prescribed set of courses to "distribution" requirements that aim to ensure educational breadth. The latter are sometimes described as a "core curriculum"; Harvard's review of its requirements illustrates this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/curriculum-review/report.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809032030/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/curriculum-review/report.html |archivedate=2007-08-09 |df= }} curriculum review&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|paragraph|date=August 2014}}
The most recent addition to the Core (2004) is Frontiers of Science.  Frontiers attempts to break the "pyramid" of science education: years of chemistry, math and physics as prerequisites to courses on current scientific research.  One aim of Frontiers is to teach "Scientific Habits of Mind", a set of analytical approaches that apply to all disciplines of science. Frontiers is taught as four, 3 week units: two from the physical sciences (for example, Astronomy and Geology) and two from the life sciences (for example, Neuroscience and Biodiversity).  Outside of Columbia, Frontiers has evoked widespread interest from colleges and universities seeking to initiate or modify a general education science course.  Material developed for Frontiers of Science are available online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fos-online.org fos online dot org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

===Requirements===
The Core Curriculum is an example of what was adopted by many educational institutions in the years following its introduction. All first-year students in the college must take the year-long "Masterpieces of Western Literature" course (known as "Literature Humanities" or Lit Hum), the semester-long "University Writing", and the semester-long "Frontiers of Science". All sophomores are required to take a year of "Contemporary Civilization" (known as CC).  The other requirements, which can be completed any year, include a semester of "Music Humanities"; a semester of "Art Humanities"; two semesters of science, four semesters of a foreign language, two semester-long courses about non-Western major cultures, and two semesters of physical education. Students are also required to pass a swimming test before receiving their diplomas, a common feature among [[Ivy League]] colleges.

==History==
The building served as a factory for several years for companies that built trunks, suitcases, telescope cases and phonographs. After being used as a warehouse, it was converted into a vocational school by the [[National Youth Administration]] in the early 1940s. During [[World War II]], women were trained at the school to build equipment for the war effort.

In 1967, the school moved to larger facility and was later renamed the [[Chippewa Valley Technical College]]. Its former site would be used by the city to house its parks and recreation department. In 2014, it was added to the State and the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/NationalRegister/NR2418|title=1300 1st Avenue|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|accessdate=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since gaining independence from France in 1956, the government of [[Tunisia]] has focused on developing an education system which produces a solid human capital base that could respond to the changing needs of a developing nation. Sustained structural reform efforts since the early 1990s, prudent macroeconomic policies, and deeper trade integration in the global economy have created an enabling environment for growth. This environment has been conducive to attain positive achievements in the education sector which placed Tunisia ahead of countries with similar income levels, and in a good position to achieve [[MDGs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagebank.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2006/05/30/000160016_20060530095000/Rendered/PDF/35575.pdf
|title=The World Bank(2006), "Second  Higher Education Reform Support Project,Republic of Tunisia." Project Appraisal Document}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the HDI  2007, Tunisia is ranked 90 out of 182 countries and is ranked 4th in [[MENA]] region just below Israel, Lebanon, and Jordan. Education is the number one priority of the government of Tunisia, with more than 20 percent of government’s budget allocated for education in 2005/06.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infodev.org/en/Publication.434.html|title=Infodev}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006 the public education expenditure as a percentage of GDP stood at 7 percent.

==Education Sector Reforms==
Tunisian education system was built on the [[France|French]] model, therefore, the focus of the education reformers was to Arabize curriculum and faculty at nation’s schools and universities. Tunisia adopted a phased approach towards Arabization. Given the number of [[Francophone]] nationals and the absence of qualified Arabized teachers to teach scientific subjects, policy makers maintained French both as a foreign language and as a medium of instruction for math and science in primary education. Humanities and social sciences were Arabized incrementally, initially in primary and subsequently in secondary education. In the 1970s, the decision was made to extend Arabization to all subjects in post-primary education, except vocational, professional, and technical tracks. At the university level, French was maintained as the language of instruction in technical institutes and science faculties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/MENAEXT/0,,contentMDK:21617643~pagePK:146736~piPK:226340~theSitePK:256299,00.html
|title=World Bank(2008), The Road Not Traveled: Education Reform in the Middle East and North Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There have also been several other reforms since independence to further improve the education system at all levels:

1)Education is an important Law that actually passed in 1958 emphasized technical and vocational education, and the training of a new breed of educators who are qualified to teach the new curriculum emphasizing Arabic language, literature, Islamic thought and history and geography of the Tunisian and North African region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/MENAEXT/0,,contentMDK:21617643~pagePK:146736~piPK:226340~theSitePK:256299,00.html
|title=World Education News and Reviews(2006)April,Vol 19,Issue 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2)Then a Higher Education Law was passed that placed all government  recognized institutions of higher learning and scientific research under the umbrella of University of Tunis,  an institute that was established in 1960, by incorporating several existing higher schools and institutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/MENAEXT/0,,contentMDK:21617643~pagePK:146736~piPK:226340~theSitePK:256299,00.html
|title=World Education News and Reviews(2006)April,Vol 19,Issue 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3)In the academic year of 1990-91, the New Education Act introduced an increased length of instruction at the primary and secondary levels from 12 to a total of 13 years. It also made it mandatory for students of ages between 6–16 years of age to attain basic education training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/MENAEXT/0,,contentMDK:21617643~pagePK:146736~piPK:226340~theSitePK:256299,00.html
|title=World Education News and Reviews(2006)April,Vol 19,Issue 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4)Tunisia introduced competency-based approach in school curriculum in 2000, and revised textbooks accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/MENAEXT/0,,contentMDK:21617643~pagePK:146736~piPK:226340~theSitePK:256299,00.html
|title=World Bank(2008), The Road Not Traveled: Education Reform in the Middle East and North Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

5) The 2002 Education Act emphasized the importance of ICT in the education sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infodev.org/en/Publication.434.html|title=Infodev}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education System==
The academic year runs from September to June and examinations are held in late June or early July.

===Early Childhood Care and Education(ECE)===
The Tunisian government has shown strong commitment towards pre-school education. Pre-school education is to be imparted in establishments or specifically designated places to the children from three to six years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001480/148046e.pdf
|title=UNESCO(2006)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Tunisia the pre-school education is provided primarily in three settings:

''Kindergartens''- These are socio-educational institutions that come under the supervision of Ministry of Women, Family, and Childhood and they belong to either private sector, the quasi-public local authorities or specialist associations. There has been considerable improvement in the coverage of kindergartens from 7.1 percent in 1990 to 14 percent in 2000.But this rate is still low primarily because most 3 to 6-year-olds do not attend kindergarten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001480/148046e.pdf
|title=UNESCO(2006)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kouttabs'' - These religious institutions also cater for children between 3 and 5 years of age. Their task is to initiate them into learning the Quran as well as reading, writing, and arithmetic. They are under the supervision of the Ministry of Religious Affairs. Reforms have enabled to increase the number of these schools from 378 in 1987 to 961 in 2007. These Kottabs host 25,194 children,11,138 of whom are girls. They are run by mold dibs(teachers)among whom 121 hold degrees in Islamic Sciences, and 60 hold university degrees. A presidential project, “Tomorrow Tunisia”, has been launched to further support Kouttabs so that they fulfill their education mission of consolidating values of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/National_Reports/ICE_2008/tunisia_NR08.pdf
|title=The Development of Education National Report,Republic of Tunisia (2004-2008)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Preparatory year's is also an integral part of basic education but it is not compulsory. It is supervised by the Ministry of Education and Training and is provided in public, private and quasi-public primary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/National_Reports/ICE_2008/tunisia_NR08.pdf
|title=The Development of Education National Report,Republic of Tunisia (2004-2008)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The gross enrollment rate at pre-primary has increased steadily since 2000 from 15 percent to 22 percent in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTEDUCATION/EXTDATASTATISTICS/EXTEDSTATS/0,,menuPK:3232818~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:3232764,00.html|title=edstats(2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic Education===
''Enseignement de base'' consists of nine years of school education and is divided into two distinct stages: 6 years of primary and 3 years of preparatory education (lower secondary). At the end of 9 years  students  sit for ''examen national de fin d’Études de l’enseignement de base'', success in which leads to the ''Diplôme de Fin d’Études de l’Enseignement.''
Students are required to score above 50 percent at the end of sixth grade to progress to the lower secondary level. Although there is a high percentage of students who fail the important grade 6 examinations. Now due to government efforts, the number of students who have to repeat grade 6 is decreasing. In 1991-92,  26 percent of students had to repeat grade 6. But in 1999-2000 that number has dropped to 18 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/MENAEXT/0,,contentMDK:21617643~pagePK:146736~piPK:226340~theSitePK:256299,00.html
|title=World Education News and Reviews(2006)April, Vol 19, Issue 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drop out rate at the primary level is 6 percent and it halved from the drop out the percentage of 12 percent in 2000. The gross enrollment ratio at primary and secondary is greater than 1 which shows that more girls than boys are enrolled at these two education levels. The share of private enrollment at primary level has been slowly increasing from 0.7 percent in 2000 to 0.9 percent in 2003 and in 2007 the private enrollment share was 1.4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTEDUCATION/EXTDATASTATISTICS/EXTEDSTATS/0,,menuPK:3232818~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:3232764,00.html|title=edstats(2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gross enrollment ratio at lower secondary level  in 2007 stood at 113 percent, a jump of about 7 percentage points from the GER  in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTEDUCATION/EXTDATASTATISTICS/EXTEDSTATS/0,,menuPK:3232818~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:3232764,00.html|title=edstats(2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also at the beginning of the 2007/208 school year, 9 Pioneer middle schools were launched to offer gifted students early care that will allow them to pursue their studies in pioneer schools in scientific, literary and art fields, with competent and experienced teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/National_Reports/ICE_2008/tunisia_NR08.pdf
|title=The Development of Education National Report,Republic of Tunisia (2004-2008)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary (upper) education===
The four years of secondary education are open to all holders of Diplôme de Fin d'etudes de l’Enseignement de Base where the students focus on entering university level or join the workforce after completion. The Enseignement secondary is divided into two stages: general academic and specialized.

In the academic stream all students follow a common curriculum for one year after which they choose one of the five specializations from language arts, sciences, and economics and management in case the student is specializing in science at the end of the second year he must choose again but this time between math,experimental sciences, computer sciences or technical sciences . The language of instruction in technical, scientific and mathematics fields is French. At the end of the fourth year of secondary studies, students take [[Tunisian Baccalaureate|Examen National du Baccalauréat]]. Students are tested on average on six subjects. Those students who complete the secondary cycle, but fail the baccalaureate are awarded a certificate of completion that can later be used for entry into the workforce or for entry to further studies in a private school. In 1995 42.5 percent of baccalaureate takers were successful. However, Tunisia has been appearing in [[TIMSS]] since 1999 and has been one of the top performing countries in the Arab region. In 2007, Tunisia ranked second in mathematics and third in science in all of the Arab countries appearing in TIMSS
, inInternationalwith scores 420 and 445 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timss.bc.edu/timss2007/countries.html|title=Countries Participating in TIMSS 2007|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gender parity index of gross enrollment ratio at the secondary level was 1.1 percent in 2006, implying higher female enrollment than male enrollment at the secondary level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTEDUCATION/EXTDATASTATISTICS/EXTEDSTATS/0,,menuPK:3232818~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:3232764,00.html|title=edstats(2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical and Vocational Track===
Professional and vocational programs are administered by the Ministry of Employment, and in more specific disciplines by individual ministries such as agriculture and tourism.
Students can opt to enroll in a two-year vocational program leading to the award of dice the Certificat d’Aptitude Professionnelle. These students who have completed the first two years of secondary education may enroll in two-year vocational programs leading to the award of the ''Brevet de Technicien Professionnel'', which in turn gives access to two-year ''Brevet de Technicien Supérieur'' programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/MENAEXT/0,,contentMDK:21617643~pagePK:146736~piPK:226340~theSitePK:256299,00.html
|title=World Education News and Reviews(2006)April,Vol 19,Issue 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enrollment in TVET at the secondary level has also been rising since 2004.The current(2007) enrollment ratio in TVET is almost 10 percent, with a higher percentage of males enrolled in these programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTEDUCATION/EXTDATASTATISTICS/EXTEDSTATS/0,,menuPK:3232818~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:3232764,00.html|title=edstats(2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Higher education===
The higher education system in Tunisia has experienced a rapid expansion and the number of students has more than tripled over the past 10 years from approximately 102,000 in 1995 to 365,000 in 2005.The gross enrollment rate at the tertiary level in 2007 was 31 percent, with gender parity index of GER of 1.5. The private university system in Tunisia, accounting for about one percent of students, remains small because the regulatory environment does not encourage foreign investment or the use of part-time teachers in private universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagebank.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2006/05/30/000160016_20060530095000/Rendered/PDF/35575.pdf

In Tunisia in 2005–2006, there were 178 public institutions of higher education among which there were 13 universities, 24 higher institutes of technological studies and six higher institutes of teachers' training. The Higher Education Ministry (HEM) supervises 155 institutions and 23 are under the co-supervision of the HEM and other ministries. In addition HEM recognizes 20 university-level private institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infodev.org/en/Publication.434.html|title=Infodev}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public university system is virtually free and student loans are not available for students enrolled in a private university, making it difficult for private universities to attract students who cannot afford to pay the fees.

During the last decade, in addition to creating seven new universities, the [[Government of Tunisia]] (GOT) has made progress in i)in improving the internal efficiency of programs and pass rates in applied science programs and selected short-term programs such as at the higher institutes of technology (Instituts supérieurs des études technologiques) (ZSETS) (ii)introducing shorter term professional programs with more relevance; and(iii)granting greater autonomy to universities to give them the flexibility to respond to the changing environment and adapt academic programs to the needs of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagebank.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2006/05/30/000160016_20060530095000/Rendered/PDF/35575.pdf

Access to post secondary education is guaranteed to all students holding the Diploma zdu [[Baccalaureat]]. The admission process is centrally controlled through the national university orientation system. Although this centralized system has been criticized{{By whom|date=December 2009}} for its rigidity as it leaves students unsatisfied by the disciplines they have been placed in. The pass rate of the Baccalaureate is not very high in Tunisia. On average 60 percent of students fail the baccalaureate each year. Recently since 2005–06, the government has been trying to implement reform that is based on the European three-tier model of bachelor’s, master's and doctoral degrees.This reform is known as LCD :licence (three years) master’s (two-years), doctorate(five years). The new academic credit hour system is meant to give students greater flexibility in designing their study tracks, while allowing them to earn and  transfer credits between institutions both domestically and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infodev.org/en/Publication.434.html|title=Infodev}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the university level the first cycle of studies in the academic stream is of two years, which leads to the award of Diploma d’Etudes Universitaires du Premier Cycle. This first degree is regarded as a preparatory one. Then in most other fields, the second cycle leads to the award of Maitrise, which is considered the first degree in Tunisian university system. Later the Diplome d’Etudes Approfondies (DEA) is awarded to Maitrise holders after a further two-year study and the preparation and defense of a thesis. DEA is also a prerequisite for entry into a doctoral program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/MENAEXT/0,,contentMDK:21617643~pagePK:146736~piPK:226340~theSitePK:256299,00.html
|title=World Education News and Reviews(2006)April,Vol 19,Issue 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this progress, however, numerous challenges remain, as student enrollments in public universities are projected to increase by about 6.6 percent annually, reaching approximately 470,000 (all categories) in 2010, while at the same time, the quality and relevance of education are in need of updating. At 2 percent of GDP, public spending on higher education is already higher than in most countries in the world. Unemployment among university graduates is increasing and the employability of graduates in modern, export-oriented sectors is weak. Mechanisms and incentives to promote quality at the university level are for the most part inadequate and universities cannot fully exercise the autonomy that will help them to better respond to the changes in the labor markets and requirements of a global economy. In sum, due to the projected increase in enrollment, the GOT is faced with a challenge of meeting public demand for higher education in an equitable way, and improving quality in a cost-efficient manner, while responding to existing and new labor market needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagebank.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2006/05/30/000160016_20060530095000/Rendered/PDF/35575.pdf

==ICT Integration in Education==
Tunisia is supported by  international organizations (e.g., the [[World Bank]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in incorporating ICT at all levels of education. These organizations provide support to the government in implementing ICT staff training  programs, supporting professional development, providing networking opportunities; researching, developing and evaluating new policy approaches in setting up [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] infrastructure in the country. Some of the innovative projects were the Mobile laboratories and Mobile Internet Buses connected to the internet via satellites to target schools in rural and remote areas so as to reduce the digital divide. Then launched in 1999Global. Teenager Project was launched that led to global classroom debates in cyber space. Tunisia also hosted the second phase of the world summit on information systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infodev.org/en/Publication.434.html|title=Infodev}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, there were 22,000 computer (0.28 computers for every class), but by 2006 there were 57,000 computers(0.71 computers for every class).Although the presidential election program is working towards achieving 1 computer per class by 2009.It is foreseen that the number of trained teachers  will increase to 80,000 in 2009 from 60,000 in 2006.
All higher education institutes are connected to the internet by El Khawarizmi Calculus Center, which is the official public internet service provider to higher education institutes. The integration of ICT in education is further reinforced by Tunisian Virtual School and the Virtual University of Tunis.

===TVS===
Tunisia was one of the first countries in North Africa and Arab  countries to pioneer in the field of distance education and e-learning through the launch of TVS in January 2002. It provides fee interactive courses, revision modules, assistance and ICT training.

===Virtual University of Tunis===
It was established as a government initiative in 2003, and it now provides 20 percent of the courses through e-learning. It does not cover all specialties but it does award diplomas and certificates. There are 207 modules, representing more than 8,000 hours, that are ready for use. The university currently has 10 functional access centers, and by 2009 there will be 200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infodev.org/en/Publication.434.html|title=Infodev}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adult Education==
The Tunisian government introduced the National Program for Adult Literacy (PNEA) in April 2000. It is supervised by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Solidarity. To support this program various civil society organizations and NGO’s have contributed immensely to ensure that adults could gain skills useful in the current job market. For example, in 2006-2007, 5000 young people aged below 30, 40 of whom women,   took part in introductory vocational training courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/National_Reports/ICE_2008/tunisia_NR08.pdf

The '''Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes''' ('''ENBA''', or '''National School of Fine Arts''') is the main centre of education and training of artists in the republic of [[Honduras]].

== History ==

=== Precursors ===
On 15 April 1878, the first antecedent is registered in this field with the establishment of a Drawing School and Paint located in Tegucigalpa; the Academy of Fine Arts and Applied Drawing to the Industrial Arts is created in 1890, founded and directed by Mr. Tomás Mur, of Spanish nationality. The National Academy of Drawing ''Claroscuro al Natual'' is created in 1934, under the direction of [[Carlos Zúñiga Figueroa]], and by 1938 the School of Arts and Crafts emerges, in this same year, the section of Artistic Drawing is opened, that suggests the creation of the National School of Fine Arts.

=== The school of Fine Arts ===
The National School of Fine Arts (ENBA in Spanish) was founded in 1940 by the President of the Republic, Doctor and General, [[Tiburcio Carías Andino|Tiburcio Carias Andino.]]

Carias Andino awarded the artists Arturo López Rodezno, Maximiliano Ramírez Euceda, Samuel Salgado, and Salvador Posadas, since a year before through a government mandate, the creation of a School of Arts; said characters had proposed themselves the creation of such school in accordance with the president. The same year they were located in the arts building of the ''ENBA'', street 6, Avenue 2 and 3, in front of ''La Libertad'' park in Comayagüela, Central District. In its beginnings, the National School of Fine Arts (ENBA), the students received [[drawing]], [[painting]], and [[sculpture]] classes; some models that were painted came in its majority from Europe, and, captured by the students in a canvas mounted on an easel.

== Mission ==
The ENBA is an educational institution that offers specialized services in the visual arts at middle level, formal and non-formal; to contribute with the development of Honduran plastic arts, the appreciation of art, national and universal culture.

== Vision ==
The ENBA pretends to be a leader institution in the artistic-visual formation in every level of the National Educational System, promoting at the same time the different manifestations of the visual arts and cultures through the activities of teaching, investigation, and extension. Regarding their policies of cultural, academic growth and support for the teaching-learning process, the following are proposed goals in the short, medium, and long term: specify a process of reform that defines the administrative and academic regultaions. Establish a mechanism of financial self-management to strenghten the academic process and cultural extension of the institution. To formulate and push a proposal for the creation of a bachelor's degree in the career of Visual Arts with different specialties. To achieve the costruction of a new building that houses the facilities of what will be the New School of Fine Arts, and the creation of an interactive-didactic Museum of the visual arts.

== Historical and legal issues ==
In 1940, the National School of Fine Arts is created, ascribed to the Ministry of Development, Commerce and Industry, offering courses and diplomas to the graduates of the sixth grade in the modalities of: drawing, perspective, paint, sculpture, ceramic, wood carving and religiuos sculpture, studied in five years.

In 1953, the school becomes part of the Ministry of Education. In 1956, the Plan for Bachelors and Professors of Primary Education is created, granting the title of Teacher of Drawing and Modeling, that is done in two years. This plan of studies dissapears in 1965.

In 1966, the Plan of Teacher of Plastic Arts initiates for graduates of the common cycle of General Culture. This modality replaces the one of Teacher of Drawing and Modeling and is extended until the year of 1975; in this same year the agreement of Legalization of Titles and Diplomas granted since 1940 is issued.

In 1976, the National School of Fine Arts is created by law and that same year, the Master Plan in Plastic Arts is created, that worked until 2005. In 1980, the bachelor's degree in graphic arts is created. In 1993, the Plastic Arts Plan for baccalaureates began, which is currently  working. In 2003, the Bachelor of Science with Orientation in Plastic Education was created within the framework of the Transformation of the National Schools, replacing the above mentioned Master Plan in Plastic Arts.

=== Institutional frame 1940 – 2014 ===
The National School of Fine Arts is an educational public institution of plastic-artistic training of medium level, unique in its genre and academic degree. Depends on the Secretary of Education through the Departmental Direction of Education of Francisco Morazán and the District Direction No. 9. Its curricula is composed by three modalities of study at a diversified level:

* 1. Bachelor's degree in Plastic Arts.
* 2. Bachelor's degree in Graphic Arts.
* 3. Bachelor's degree in Cultural Management.

In the framework of the non-formal education it offers the following modalities:

* 1. Free courses of Artistic Training.
* 2. Drawing courses and Infantile Painting.

This educational center, in its trajectory, has been very important in the Honduran society because of its contribution to the development of visual arts and national culture. It has formed more than 90% of the creators, contemplators, and educators of art.

=== Academy ===
The formal academic activity is done through three modalities of study.

&lt;br&gt;''Bachelor's degree in Plastic Arts:'' this plan of studies pretends to endow its students of the basic and practical theoretical-artistic knowledge that allow them the elaboration of the work of art, aiming them to become the representative artists of the national plastic arts. In addition to training them as professionals in this field, it prepares them to face their future personal challenges, of participation in society and to opt to higher studies. The aspects on which this plan is based are: aesthetic creativity, plastic artistic promoter, human relations and professional ethics, critical judgement, national identity; and democratic attitude.

''Bachelor's degree in Graphic Arts:'' This plan aims to provide to its students of technical-artistic and scientific knowledge that allows them to develop as professionals in the field of visual communication performing as graphic designers, it also forms them in the scientific-humanist area, which will enable them to opt for higher studies.

''Schoolteaching in Plastic Arts:'' plan of studies that aims to provide its students of pedagogical, artistic, and scientific  knowledge to initiate them in the development of neccesary skills in the teaching of plastic art, besides preparing them to continue with higher studies in this field. Through these study modalities since year 1977 until 2006 they have graduated 1,034 young people coming from the different departments of the country. In the established study modalities in the 1957 to 1976 period graduated 154 young people, making a total of 1,188 professionals in this field.

=== Reforms curriculares specific in the educational training ===

The ENBA designs and executes curricular models in response to social demands and to specific historical moments. In the first years of its operation the ENBA offers courses and diplomas to sixth grade graduates in the modalities or sections of: drawing, perspective, painting, sculpture, decoration, ceramic, carving in wood and religious sculpture. These were developed with a duration of five years. 

By 1956, the Plan for Bachelors and Teachers of Primary Education is created. Giving them the title of Teacher of Drawing and Modeling, this plan was completed in two years. In 1966, the Teacher of Plastic Arts initiates for graduates of the common cycle of General Culture, this modality replaces to one of Teacher of Drawing and Modeling and extends to the year 1975. This plan was completed in three years. In 1976, the plan of Teachers of Plastic Arts initiates which works until 2005. In 1975 the agreement of Legalization of Titles and Diplomas granted from 1940 until 1975 is issued and it is "created" by law the National School of Fine Arts, ascribed to the Executive Department of Artistic and Normal.

In 2003 the Bachelor's Degree of Sciences with Orientation in Plastic Education (BEP in Spanish) in the framework of the reforms of the normal and artistic education, presented by the Secretary of Education. This process lasted only five years.

In 2008 under the agreement 1710- SE-2008, starts again the teacher training under the Teachers of Primary Education in Plastic Arts, which is completed in a three year period, running to date. Since 2005, this institution has pretended to elevate the dormation of its modalities of studies on a higher level.

== Budget ==
The government of [[Honduras]] decided to invest an additional 18 billion Lempiras (US$933 million) between 2001 and 2015, towards social projects in [[education]], [[health]] and [[culture]] amounting to 35% of the budget for the reducing poverty strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedoh.org/proyectos/ERP/erp.html|title=Estrategia para la Reducción de la Pobreza|website=www.cedoh.org|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This investment is one more component of the already decided and pre-established budget for these sectors, something the government has not made, instead maintaining the National School of Fine Arts working with a lowered budget and as of the date of May, 2014 has not delivered the 2013 budget, besides the scholarship of $15/month assigned for each student in school. Art has been ignored in Honduras, for example the maximum prize that a national artist can aspire to win is the [[National Prize of Art Pablo Zelaya Sierra]], which only has an annual monetary reward of US$500 to the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/csp/mediapool/sites/ElHeraldo/Metro/story.csp?cid=587450&amp;sid=298&amp;fid=213|title=Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes sin presupuesto - Diario El Heraldo|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/932836.html|title=En el abandono, Escuela Nacional de Artes en Honduras|first=El Universal, Compañia Periodística Nacional.|last=México|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2046">The '''Further and Higher Education Act 1992''' made changes in the funding and administration of [[further education]] and [[higher education]] within [[England and Wales]] with consequential effects on associated matters in Scotland which had previously been governed by the same legislation as England and Wales. It was introduced during the [[First Major ministry]].

The most visible result was to allow thirty-five [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|polytechnic]]s to become [[university|universities]] (often referred to as the "[[new universities (United Kingdom)|new universities]]" or "post-1992 universities"). In addition the Act created bodies to fund higher education in England—[[HEFCE]]—and further education—[[Further Education Funding Council for England|FEFC]]. Universities in Scotland and Wales which had previously been funded by one UK-wide [[Universities Funding Council]] were the subject of other Acts that created higher education funding councils in each country. The act abolished binary line, created national unitary funding councils, removed colleges of further education from local government control, and created quality assessment arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=104836&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=Richards, Huw, "The collision of two worlds", '&amp;#39;Times Higher Education'&amp;#39; (December 5, 1997) |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=1997-12-05 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gavari''' is a 40-day ecstatic dance drama tradition dedicated to the [[Shakti]] [[avatar]] ''Gavari'' (aka ''Gavri'' or ''Gauri''), the principal deity of [[Mewar|Mewar's]] [[Bhil people|Bhil tribe]] in [[Rajasthan]], India. The Mewari Bhils honor Gavari as the creative protective spirit animating all life; and they perform this ritual annually to invoke, experience and celebrate Her powers.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58471382|title=Culture and customs of India|last=Henderson|first=Carol|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=|isbn=0313305137|location=Westport, Conn.|pages=141|oclc=58471382}}&lt;/ref&gt; This centuries-old ceremonial cycle employs austere discipline, [[Religious ecstasy|enraptured trance]], and wild theatrics to also convey ancient myths, historic events, tribal lore, and satiric political commentary. Among all the world’s folk performance traditions, it is quite unique, especially with respect to its epiphanous energy, scale, duration, ascetic rigour and inspirational messaging as well as its still mysterious [[provenance]] and genesis.

== The Gavari Season ==
[[File:Masked Gavari Budia figure from rural Jaisamand troupe.jpg|Masked Gavari Budia figure from rural Jaisamand troupe|right|thumb]]
Each year, ''bhopa'' [[Shamanism|shamans]] from Mewar's Bhil communities petition the Goddess to permit their villagers to perform the Gavari ritual and to accompany them for the weeks of touring. The average wait time for her consent is about 4–5 years, and once the ritual cycle begins, she must also be successfully invoked before each daily ceremony. Only when she visibly possesses one or more troupe members can the dance dramas begin and the ritual proceed.

Each of the 25-25 participating communities forms and dispatches its own Gavari company of 20-80 members. The troupes crisscross Mewar performing more than 600 day-long village ceremonies in all. In total, Gavari troupes in total can play to over a quarter of a million people annually.

During the  40-day Gavari season, all players practice strict austerities to maintain reverent contact with the living earth and the [[Immanence|immanent spirit]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41143548|title=Tribal dances of India|last=|first=|date=1999|publisher=Discovery Pub.

They eat only a single meal each day during the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/keeping-history-alive-dramatically/article2273799.ece|title=Keeping history alive dramatically}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ethnoflorence.skynetblogs.be/mask-bhil-gavari-dance/|title=MASKINDIA BHIL GAVRI GAVARI DANCE Chhoti Undri village Rajasthan : ETHNOFLORENCE Indian and Himalayan folk and tribal arts|website=ethnoflorence.skynetblogs.be|language=fr|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final days, each troupe returns to its home village for a last performance and closing ceremonies. The cycle ends with an immersion rite to return the Goddess’s fertility to their waters and all night raucous celebrations.

A Gavari troupe repertoire may include 10-15 classic traditional tales and new ones are still evolving, but the overarching themes are the sacredness of the natural world, radical human equality, and the feminine nature of the divine.  These values are reflected in traditional Bhil society where the environment is revered, hierarchy is abhorred, and women enjoy greater rights and status than in communities outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitra|first=Aparna|date=2008-06-01|title=The status of women among the scheduled tribes in India|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535707001254|journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics|series=Behavioral Dimensions of the Firm Special Issue|volume=37|issue=3|pages=1202–1217|doi=10.1016/j.socec.2006.12.077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indianmirror.com/tribes/bhiltribe.html|title=Bhil tribal communities|last=|first=|date=|website=www.indianmirror.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Gavari’s many mythic dramas, two of the most popular and often repeated are ''Badalya Hindawa'' (The Banyan Swing) and ''Bhilurana'' (King of the Bhils).

''Badalya Hindawa'' recounts how the Goddess re-greened the Earth after a life-erasing flood and fiercely defends it thereafter from greed, stupidity and harm. The playlet features a powerful guru who loses his disciples beneath a sacred [[banyan]] tree and demands that the local king destroy it as an illicit source of power. The unnerved king complies and has the tree cut down. The Goddess and her [[devi]] sisters are outraged at this desecration and slip into his court disguised as acrobatic dancers to exact revenge. They lure the king close with their artistry, reveal their true nature, indict him for cowardice and sacrilege, and mortally terminate his reign.

[[File:Gavari_Bhilurana_scene_showing_Queen_Victoria_leading_Brit_invasion.jpg|alt=Bhilurana scene of British invaders|right|thumb|''Bhilurana: on left the British invaders, on right Bhils preparing to resist. The green parasol marks the Empress of India, Queen Victoria; the red Goddess Kali, the Bhils’ secret power source.'']]  ''Bhilurana'' is the tale of a composite leader representing five centuries of Bhil resistance to intrusions of all kinds. The play compresses and conflates the armed might of Turkic, Mughal and British invaders and depicts Goddess-inspired Bhil warriors finally driving them all away with daring ambushes, sabotage and shrewd [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]].

Both plays end with celebration, salutations to the Goddess, and clear warnings to interlopers to never violate Nature or their sovereignty again.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gavari - Mewar’s electrifying tribal dance-drama: An Illustrated Introduction|last=Agneya|first=Harish|publisher=Tuneer Films|year=2014|isbn=978-9352123292|location=India|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gavari drama emphasis inspired [[improvisation]] over rehearsal and memorisation. The beginnings and ends of Gavari dramas are known, but how things transpire in between is highly mutable. There are no scripts and many players are illiterate farmers and labourers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bhils|title=Bhils - Dictionary definition of Bhils {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual plays can continue for hours, contain long soliloquies and dialogues, and are only performed by a particular troupe once on four or five years. This intuitive improvisational approach fosters great creative diversity and different villages may present the same stories in many very different ways.  Players strive to perform in a receptive trance known as ''[[Bhava samadhi|bhava]]'', which resembles the fluid creative state that musicians and athletes call "flow" or "[[Flow (psychology)|the zone]]".

=== Characters ===

[[File:Gavari Budia player invoking the role's tutelary spirit.jpg|Budia player|right|thumb]]Depending on the day and the plays selected a single Gavari troupe can present dozens of different characters - goddess avatars, gods, demons, historical figures, sacred animals, corrupt officials, etc. The only constant roles, which exist outside the dramas, are the '''Budia''' figure, his twin '''Rai''' devi consorts and '''Kutkadia''', the  [[master of ceremonies]].

Women are not allowed to tour as actors with the troupe due to the 4-5 day [[Menstrual taboo|menstrual isolation]] Bhil women observe each month. Consequently, all female characters are portrayed by men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Budia embodies a powerful fusion of Shaivite and demonic energies and is a vital protective Gavari figure. He is distinguished by his dramatic horse hair-fringed mask, sacred staff and twin Rai consorts. In each day’s Gavari ceremony the Budia character has three main duties: circling the arena during opening invocations in the opposite direction as the dancers to seal in and protect the energy field they are generating; patrolling the arena perimeter during dance drama sequences to prevent audience members from entering the players' area or shaman circle unless they are clearly entranced; and periodically holding court at the arena’s edge with his Rai escorts to accept offerings on behalf of the troupe and confer blessings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gavari.info/gallery/the-many-faces-of-budia/|title=The Many Faces of Budia – Mewar Gavari|website=www.gavari.info|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Gavari village has its own iconic Budia mask, which is treated as a sacred object and often handed down for generations.

== History ==

=== Bhils ===

{{Main|Bhil people}}
One of India’s oldest and largest tribes, the [[Bhil people]] have primarily lived in the belt extending across contemporary [[Gujarat]], [[Rajasthan]], and [[Madhya Pradesh]] for at least 4,000 years.  About 10 million Bhils live in India today, but only the ±7% who reside in [[Mewar]] participate in the Gavari tradition.

=== Origin ===
There are many speculative theories about Gavari's genesis, but its true age and origin are unknown.

According to one hypothesis, it may have begun in rural Mewar at the end of the 16th century, when Mewaris largely regained control of their lands and lives from the Mughals in [[Battle of Haldighati#Aftermath|1579]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/469652456|title=Medieval India : from Sultanat to the Mughals|last=...|first=Chandra, Satish, 1922-|date=2005|publisher=Har-Anand Publications|year=|isbn=8124110662|edition=Revised|location=New Delhi|pages=121–122|oclc=469652456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/airavat/mughal-mewarconflict|title=mughal-mewarconflict - airavat|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Rajput court gratefully awarded their mountain-dwelling Bhil brethren both unprecedented recognition and vast tracts of fertile agricultural land. The latter boon gradually drew most Bhils out of their forest encampments and began their transition to village agriculture. The 16th century hypothesis thus holds that this settling down of a semi-nomadic people created a nostalgia for their more adventurous heritage. Others assert that Gavari began in the 3rd or 4th century in Gujarat,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and still others that it as old as Bhil culture itself and dates back four millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Rajasthan_State_Gazetteer_History_and_cu.html?id=ngZWAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Rajasthan State Gazetteer: History and culture|last=|first=|date=1995|publisher=Directorate, District Gazetteers, Government of Rajasthan|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=199, 205|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50712988|title=Fairs and festivals of Indian tribes|last=|first=|date=2003|publisher=Discovery Pub.

==Religious and shamanic aspects==
=== Invocations ===
[[File:Gavari ritual invocation gear.jpg|right|thumb|Ritual implements for invocation rites]]
Gavari troupes perform two  distinct invocation rituals.  The first is used to ask the Goddess to permit a village to perform the Gavari cycle. This invocation is held in every Mewari Bhil community on or shortly before the full moon in the Hindu month of ''[[Shravana]]'', which usually falls in August as the monsoon planting season ends.

The second is to confirm Her presence and participation at the start of each day's performance. Both invocations require [[Incense in India|incense]], flowers. [[chant]]ing, [[Madal|''madal'' drum]] and ''thali'' cymbal music, a [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] [[trishula]], and the kindling of a ''[[dhuni]] fire''.

Initial sanction invocations are usually held in a darkened sanctuary attended by a small group of ''bhopa'' shamans, village elders and veteran Gavari players. Other villagers gather outside to await Her decision which is delivered by a possessed trembling ''bhopa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=phRzAGYR9swC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=bhils+trance+invocatons&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Lfm8IUce62&amp;sig=GflvrHHPlRD5qRsjax96avnf7HY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMgMLayq7VAhUmR48KHWbKDuQQ6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=bhils%20trance%20invocatons&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopaedia of Sociology of Religion: Sociology of religions in India|last=Nayar|first=V.

Typical reasons for refusal include discord in the village, shrine disrepair, a poor monsoon, a crop blight, etc., which must be dealt with satisfactorily before petitioning Her again.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gavari.info/gavari-introduction/|title=Gavari Introduction – Mewar Gavari|website=www.gavari.info|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daily confirmation invocations are performed around an altar in the centre of the Gavari arena where shamans, musicians and senior players gather in a tight circle. The rest of the players and occasionally villagers dance counterclockwise around this core to create a welcoming energy field. A guardian  Budia figure circles the dancers in the opposite direction to seal in their energy and protect it from misuse. The Goddess spirit's arrival and presence is signaled by one or more ''bhopas'' falling into trembling [[Bhava samadhi|''bhava'' trance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://udaipurtimes.com/gavri-the-opera-of-mewar/|title=‘Gavri’ the Opera of Mewar|date=2010-09-28|work=UdaipurTimes.com|access-date=2017-07-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other requisite ritual instruments used after Her manifestation include peacock feather [[sceptre]]s to dramatize and distribute possession's quivering energetic power, and heavy ''saankal'' chains with which trance-elated participants often beat their backs.

===Possession and Trance===
Successful invocations have several visible effects. First they connect the village shaman(s) to the Goddess spirit so they can audibly articuiate Her concerns, requests and will.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=hqwYDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT77&amp;lpg=PT77&amp;dq=bhils+trance+invocatons&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xVyok1tXBk&amp;sig=Pv_mXXmCO_9yS2FyLPXdy1HBJyw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMgMLayq7VAhUmR48KHWbKDuQQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bhils%20trance%20invocations&amp;f=false|title=Disappearing Peoples?: Indigenous Groups and Ethnic Minorities in South and Central Asia|last=Brower|first=Barbara|last2=Johnston|first2=Barbara Rose|date=2016-09-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315430393|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, they infuse the Gavari players with creative inspiration to ably enact their roles. Finally, they can overwhelm some villagers with a sense of wonder, grace and bliss. Entranced villagers may be welcomed into the shaman circle or approached for healings and blessings by other members of the crowd. Those possessed often later report feelings of great exhilaration and selfless unity with all surrounding life. Such experiences reinforce Bhils' belief in Gavari's power, their own inalienable equality, and the sacredness of the natural world.

== Social and Cultural Significance ==

[[File:Gavari_comedic_playlet_satirizing_urban_traders.jpg|alt=Greedy urban traders|right|thumb|Satiric skit mocking fat traders who come to fleece the villagers]]
In Gavari, the beauty and power of the natural world are the ultimate expression of divinity. Wilful or heedless damage to its diversity, health or future is thus regarded as not only short-sighted and suicidal, but also criminal and blasphemous.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gavari.info|title=Mewar Gavari – Mewar's ecstatic tribal folk opera|website=gavari.info|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such views are the seed [[Seven generation sustainability]] among many indigenous tribes and their current widespread battles to safeguard water resources, endangered ecosystems and [[biocultural diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rabble.ca/news/2014/11/11-indigenous-resistance-movements-you-need-to-know|title=11 Indigenous resistance movements you need to know {{!}} rabble.ca|website=rabble.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/environment/year-of-clout-10-stories-of-indigenous-environmental-influence-in-2015/|title=Year of Clout: 10 Stories of Indigenous Environmental Influence in 2015 - Indian Country Media Network|website=indiancountrymedianetwork.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gavari is righteously egalitarian and disrespectful of unjust authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58471382|title=Culture and customs of India|last=E.|first=Henderson, Carol|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=|isbn=0313305137|location=Westport, Conn.|pages=156|oclc=58471382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its dramas vividly depict and celebrate the dispatching of powerful officials, gurus and merchants either by the mocking scorn of villagers or the sword of the Goddess in a protective maternal rage. No authority figure is spared and some playlets happily lampoon kings,  Hindu gods like [[Krishna]], and even charlatan ''Bhopa'' shamans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandalia|first=Hemendra S I N G H|title=Tribal Dance-drama Gavari : Theatre of Subversion and Popular Faith|url=https://www.academia.edu/31877270/Tribal_Dance-drama_Gavari_Theatre_of_Subversion_and_Popular_Faith|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The healthy skepticism such skits reflected and encouraged in [[Rajsamand district|rural Mewar]], along with other similar art forms/practices in the subcontinent helped birth India's [[Right to Information Act, 2005|2005 Right to Information Act]], which has been journalistically hailed as "the most significant change to Indian democracy since Independence" &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140313/jsp/opinion/story_18068459.jsp|title=The invisible history of people's movements|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gavari's itinerant format continues to closely network and promote solidarity among Mewar's scattered rural villages as well as their constituent castes and religious communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49276478|title=South Asian folklore : an encyclopedia : Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka|last=|first=|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|others=Claus, Peter J., Diamond, Sarah, 1966-, Mills, Margaret Ann.|year=|isbn=0415939194|location=New York|pages=239|oclc=49276478}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its rich mythic and historical repertoire also helps keep tribal youth aware of their heritage.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

Gavari’s comedic skits on farm finance, greedy middlemen and corrupt merchants offer villagers wry lessons in real world commerce and economic self-defense, especially with regard to crop brokers, [[moneylender]]s, [[Usury|credit scams]], and urban conceptions of wealth.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

Gavari tightens inter-community bonds with its month of itinerant village visitations and solidifies Bhils’ sense of responsibility for a world far beyond their neighboring fields.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although only Bhils play roles in the ceremony, Gavari performances also internally solidify communities by involving all castes, communities and age groups in the preparations and audience delight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/keeping-history-alive-dramatically/article2273799.ece|title=Keeping history alive dramatically|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gavari tradition at home has fallen on hard times&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Rajasthan's government schools now forbid Bhil students to be [[truancy|truant]] to accompany their village Gavari troupes on their month-long pilgrimages. This alone is potentially lethal since Gavari has no scripts or schools and the only way to learn its ceremonies, arts and stories is as an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] participant. 
Add to this the accelerating exodus of working age youth to metro centers in search of employment and the average size and number of rural Gavari troupes continues decline.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/609982250|title=Tribal culture, continuity, and change : a study of Bhils in Rajasthan|last=1973-|first=Majhi, Anita Srivastava,|date=2010|publisher=Mittal Publications|year=|isbn=8183242987|location=New Delhi|pages=150|oclc=609982250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''gradual release of responsibility model''' or '''GRR model''' is a particular style of [[teaching]] which is a structured method of [[pedagogy]] framed around a process devolving responsibility within the learning process from the teacher to the eventual independence of the learner. This instructional model requires that the teacher, by design, transitions from assuming "all the responsibility for performing a task...to a situation in which the students assume all of the responsibility".&lt;ref&gt;(Duke &amp; Pearson, 2002, p. 211). Duke, N. K., &amp; Pearson, P. D. (2002). Effective practices.&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal result is a confident learner who accepts responsibility for their own learning and directs this learning through the [[cognitive process]]es involved, moving through the academic spectrum, to independent choice ([[personalized learning|personalised learning]]). As Buehl (2005) stated, the GRR model "emphasizes instruction that mentors students into becoming capable thinkers and learners when handling the tasks with which they have not yet developed expertise".&lt;ref&gt;Buehl, D. (2005). Scaffolding. Reading Room. Retrieved April 26, 2017 from http://weac.org/articles/readingroom_scaffolding/.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==

While similar models have been identified and represented throughout the study and development of teaching and [[learning]] as a construct, it was Pearson &amp; Gallagher (1983)&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pearson, P.D.|author2=Gallagher, M.|date=October 1983|title=The Instruction of Reading Comprehension|journal=[[Contemporary Educational Psychology]]|volume=8|issue=3|pp=317-344|publisher= University of Illinois, National Institute of Education|location=Washington, DC|doi=10.1016/0361-476X(83)90019-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; who coined the phrase "gradual release of responsibility" to describe this dynamic in the classroom. Basing their model on the ideas of the Russian [[educational theorist]] Lev [[Vygotsky]], Pearson and Gallagher envisioned instruction that moved from explicit modeling and instruction to guided practice and then to activities that incrementally positioned students into becoming independent learners. The teacher guides the students to a point of '[[planned obsolescence]]' on the part of the teacher "...where the student accepts total responsibility for the task, including the responsibility for determining whether or not she is applying the strategy appropriately (i.e, self monitoring)."&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;{{rp|34}}

One element which is crucial to the success of the GRR model is the notion related to '[[instructional scaffolding]]', which is grounded in Vygotsky's concept of the "[[zone of proximal development]]" (ZPD).  This is described as the distance between the actual developmental level of a learner as determined by their independent [[problem solving]] abilities and the level of potential development through problem-solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers. That is, the distance between what the children can do without assistance and what they can accomplish with the assistance of more capable peers. The zone of proximal development can be applied as an umbrella over the entire GRR model. Students are given support in the form of scaffolding and differentiate instruction throughout all four phases of the process. Teachers may offer more challenging material to high-achieving students, and assist lower-achieving students in needs-based groups. Teachers will support students as needed throughout all four steps finally allowing for the eventual independence of each student.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery Wilhelm, Youtube.com. N.p., 2009. Web. 6 Jun 2012. &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2kthBiYHF4&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The GRR model "...assumes that [the student] will need some guidance in reaching that stage of independence and that it is precisely the teacher's role to provide such guidance".&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;{{rp|34}}

Vygotsky (1978) believed that guided interactions, with an adult, or a more skilled peer, could facilitate a higher level of thinking within the zone.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Griffin, &amp; Cole, 1989; Rogoff, 1990). Newman, D., Griffin, P., &amp; Cole, M. (1989). The construction zone. New York: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In Vygotsky's theory, this person is referred to as the "More Knowledgeable Other (MKO)".&lt;ref&gt;McLeod , S.. "Vgotsky." Simply psychology. Simply Psychology, 2007. Web. 7 Jun 2012. &lt;http://www.simplypsychology.org/vygotsky.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The four phases of the GRR Model are: Focus Lesson – "I do it", Guided Instruction – "We do it", Collaborative – "You do it together", and Independent – "You do it alone" (Fisher &amp; Frey 2006). In the GRR model, the MKO exists in the person of the teacher-guide in the "I do it" and "We do it" phases. The MKO resurfaces again in the collaborative process where peers may assist each other as expertise, personal experience, and/or understanding allows.

There have been a number of ways of describing and representing the ways in which adults or more experienced others may assist novice learners within their ZPD. Rogoff (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Apprenticeship in thinking: Cognitive development in social context. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; recognised that this could be achieved through guided participation, and this is similar to the concept of Tharp and Gallimore's theory (1991),&lt;ref&gt;Tharp, R., &amp; Gallimore, R. (1991). A theory of teaching as assisted performance. In P. Light, S. Sheldon, &amp; M. Woodhead (Eds.), Learning to think (pp. 42–62). London, New York: The Open University.&lt;/ref&gt; of "means of assisting" and to that of the practice of [[reciprocal teaching]] recognised by Brown and Palincsar.&lt;ref&gt;Palincsar, A., &amp; Brown, A. (1984). Reciprocal teaching of comprehension-fostering and comprehension-monitoring activities. Educational Psychologist, 21(1 &amp; 2), 73–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have recognised the similarities between this method of instruction and the integrated approach of collaboration in conceptual change (Rochelle, 1992) and the [[Cognitive apprenticeship|cognitive apprenticeship model]] of Collins, Brown, and Newman (1989).

This term 'scaffolding' is a useful metaphor that is used to symbolise the process of supporting a learner in the early stages of the learning process – as the walls get higher – until there is sufficient evidence of knowledge and skills having been acquired, to then be able to remove that scaffolding so the learner is able to 'stand alone', or be effectively independent enough to continue learning 'alone'. In a similar way, there is a gradual dismantling of the scaffolding as the 'job' becomes more secure and so there is a gradual release of responsibility from the teacher to the learner. As scaffolding is temporary, so too are the lessons that are constructed to help students as they embark into unfamiliar thinking. As noted by Pearson and Gallagher, "The critical stage of the model is the 'guided practice,' the stage in which the teacher gradually releases task responsibility to the students." As such, these lessons eventually fade away as students become gradually more comfortable with the learning and are able to work without the necessary guidance of the teacher.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

Although based on the work of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], the influence of Vygotsky's '[[constructivist theory]]' and  learning in the classroom has become more popular because it considers the influence of group processes and social contexts that are, in themselves, influenced by such constructs as [[cultural diversity]] and [[Developmental stage theories|stages of development]].

The GRR model emphasizes instruction that supports and mentors students into becoming capable thinkers and learners when handling tasks with which they have yet to develop expertise in.
It is a successful model and has been documented as an effective approach in teaching many subject areas and a variety of content, from writing achievement, [[reading comprehension]], and [[literacy]] outcomes for [[English language learners]] (Kong &amp; Pearson, 2003).&lt;ref&gt;The road to participation: The construction of a literacy practice in a learning community of linguistically diverse learners. Research in the Teaching of English, 38, 85–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The four phases ==

=== Focused lesson ===


Focus lessons are a time for students to hear the teacher and not answer questions about their own thinking.  This is the time for students to actively listen, take notes and ask for clarification. "I think...", or "I wonder...", or "I predict...." are the types of statements students will hear.  


According to Fisher and Frey, Modeling follows a precise pattern:

#Name the strategy, skill, or task
#State the purpose of the strategy, skill or task
#Explain when the strategy or skill is used
#Use analogies to link prior knowledge to new learning
#Demonstrate how the skill, strategy, or task is completed
#Alert learners about errors to avoid
#Assess the use of the new skill 
"Once students have a skill or strategy modeled, they gain a deeper understanding for when to apply it, what to watch for, and how to analyze their success."&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;Fisher, D., &amp; Frey, N. (2008). Better Learning Through Structured Teaching: A Framework for the Gradual Release of Responsibility. Alexandria, VA:  Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}} Students can then be given time to talk and practice with a partner.  Students need to be provided with examples for them to be successful.

"The key to a quality focus lesson is in the direct explaining and modeling of the skill, strategies, and task."&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt;{{rp|19}}

=== Guided instruction ===

The goal of guided instruction in the gradual release of responsibility model is to guide students toward using different skills, strategies and procedures independently. The student will assume more responsibility with less support from the teacher. Lessons are created as to ensure student success.&lt;ref&gt;Nova Scotia Department of Education (2007). Teaching in Action: Grades 4-6. Halifax, N.S.: Nova Scotia Department of Education. Retrieved May 6, 2012 from http://www.ednet.ns.ca/pdfdocs/curriculum/TIA4-6_WEB.pdf {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919194928/http://www.ednet.ns.ca/pdfdocs/curriculum/TIA4-6_WEB.pdf|archivedate=20150919194928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes when students are struggling with a concept in the classroom, they do not need more teacher modelling, what they really need is guidance and support to meet high expectations.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt;

Teachers meet with needs based groups which are created based on the feedback from [[formative assessment]] with the aim being for students to progress toward completing the outcome or skill independently.&lt;ref&gt;Maynes, N., Julien-Schultz, L., Dunn, C. (2010). Modeling and the Gradual Release of Responsibility: What Does It Look Like in the Classroom? Brock Education Journal, 19(2), 65-77. Retrieved from http://www.ed.brocku.ca/ojs/index.php/brocked/article/view/136/131&lt;/ref&gt; Formative assessments are planned in accordance with specific outcomes, which make it easier for teachers to group students. Groups may change frequently and are not static groups for the entire school year. Student groups change throughout the year based on assessed performance and not on teacher perceived ability.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt; Each group has a purpose and the teacher plans instructional lessons based on the common needs of the group. Guided instruction gives the teacher an opportunity to [[differentiated instruction]] small group instruction, vary the level of prompting and also vary the end product. The teacher must be flexible since the instructional goal of the group may change throughout the sessions.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt;

In a classroom there may be many different guided instruction groups. Each group may be working on a different skill or at a different level. Fisher's model recommends meeting with groups 1–3 times per week, with some groups meeting more frequently and other stronger groups meeting less often. The size of the groups will also vary depending on how much face time is required for the particular skill. It is a common misconception that guided instruction is only for struggling students. This is an opportunity for teachers to provide enrichment for strong students. Guided instruction is based on the pedagogical principles of scaffolding.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt;

A study by Conklin and Wilkins shows growth and advances in reading levels among elementary students when using a guided reading approach. Working with the teacher in small groups gave students a chance to work on specific skills, at their reading level. Students gained confidence when reading 'just right' texts. Since they were not struggling with the text they were able to develop vocabulary, reading comprehension skills and oral language skills.&lt;ref&gt;Conklin, S., Wilkins, K. (2002). Improving Student Reading Skills through the Use of Guided Reading.  Unpublished masters dissertation, Saint Xavier University, Chicago, IL. (ERIC Document Reproduction Service No. ED471575) Retrieved May 6, 2012, from ERIC database.&lt;/ref&gt; Gabl, Kaiser, Long and Roemer found similar results when providing reading intervention in the form of guided reading groups to grade two and grade four students. The results showed an increase in reading fluency and comprehension after using flexible grouping in guided reading.&lt;ref&gt;Gabl, K., Kaiser, K., Long, J.,  Roemer, J. (2007). Improving Reading Comprehension and Fluency through the Use of Guided Reading.  Unpublished masters dissertation, Saint Xavier University, Chicago, IL. (ERIC Document Reproduction Service No. ED496377) Retrieved May 6, 2012, from ERIC database.&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvement in writing can also be seen when teachers implement a guided writing aspect to their literacy based lessons. Gibson notes that providing immediate instructional scaffolding to specific groups of students increases performance. The teacher chooses the instructional goals based on observation and formative assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, S. (2008). Guided Writing Lessons: Second-Grade Students' Development of Strategic Behavior. Reading Horizons, 48(2), 111-132. (ERIC Document Reproduction Service No. EJ833885) Retrieved May 6, 2012, from ERIC database.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of subject matter, students who are taught and then grouped according to need and re-taught based on their needs commonly show improvement.

=== Collaborative learning ===

[[Collaborative learning]] is the third component of the gradual release of responsibility model where students work in small heterogeneous groups on activities that allow them to deepen their understanding through application of the concept being learned.  This stage of the model is the beginning of the transfer of responsibility from the teacher to the students.  The collaborative learning component requires that each student is accountable for their participation by producing an independent product while engaged with his peers.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt;{{rp|63-64}}

There are five key features of collaborative or [[cooperative learning]] that researchers have found essential to produce effective learning. They are [[positive interdependence]], face-to-face interaction, individual and group accountability,  interpersonal and small group skills, and group processing.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D., Johnson, R., Smith, K., &amp; Stoll, E. L. (January 01, 1996). Active Learning: Cooperation in the College Classroom. Communication Education, 45, 3, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;
Positive interdependence within a collaborative learning environment means that each member of the group contributes an individual effort to the task which is necessary for the whole group's success. The interdependence of this structure creates an environment in which all individuals are important to the group as a whole, and the sharing of understandings, processes and ideas among members is common.&lt;ref name="co-operation"&gt;Johnson, David W. and Johnson, Roger T.. (undefined). Cooperative Learning Institute And Interaction Book Company. In An Overview Of Cooperative Learning. Retrieved May 1, 2012, from http://www.co-operation.org/?page_id=65.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Face-to-face interaction]] is another key component of collaborative learning where students interact within their group about their task, providing support, encouragement and praise as needed to reach the goal.&lt;ref name="co-operation" /&gt;  In the face to face groups students can check understanding through discussions of the concepts and ideas of the content being studied.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt;{{rp|66}}
 
Individual and group accountability requires that each member of the collaborative group be responsible for contributing their share of the work. This can be done with clear goals, and assessment that is measurable in terms of achieving goals and the efforts of the group members.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt;{{rp|67}}

Collaborative or cooperative learning requires students to act as a members of a team.  A skill set that includes leadership, active listening, decision making, turn taking and trust making are useful in collaborative learning.   These teamwork skills need to be purposely taught as part of the gradual release of responsibility model.&lt;ref name="co-operation" /&gt;
  
The final key of collaborative learning is group processing.  This refers to the members reflecting on how they are as a group reaching the collaborative learning task, and how as individuals they are learning.  Reflection on the workings of the group,  what worked and what improvements could be made is also a part of the group processing.&lt;ref name="co-operation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt;

=== Independent tasks ===
The last phase of gradual release of responsibility provides students with the opportunity to employ what they have learned in a new situation. Students can be given a variety of independent tasks but the assignments should reflect the other phases of instructional content. While students are working, the teacher's role is to circulate the room listening and making observations.

Due to time restrictions in the classroom, independent work must be completed by the student at home. According to the [[Nova Scotia Department of Education]], [[homework]] is "an assigned activity that students complete outside of regular class time. When assignments are purposeful, engaging, of high quality, and given in moderation, the assignment of homework by teachers is positively associated with student learning success".&lt;ref name="ednet_a"&gt;Nova Scotia Department of Education, English Program Services. (2011). Homework Guide for Teachers ({{ISBN|978-1-55457-390-5}}).
(Homework Tips, 2008) http://www.ednet.ns.ca/pdfdocs/curriculum/Homework_Booklet_for_Teachers-10-12.pdf {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919195328/http://www.ednet.ns.ca/pdfdocs/curriculum/Homework_Booklet_for_Teachers-10-12.pdf|archivedate=20150919195328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Harris Cooper, Jorgianne C. Robinson, and Erika A. Patall has proven, "with only rare exceptions, the relationship between the amount of homework students do and their achievement outcomes was found to be positive and statistically significant".  In a survey sponsored by [[MetLife]], the majority of teachers surveyed said they used homework to "improve skills in the classroom and for improving life skills beyond high school".&lt;ref name="fisherandfrey"&gt;Fisher, D., &amp; Frey, N. (2008). Homework and the gradual release of responsibility: Making "responsibility" possible. English Journal, 98(2), 40-45.

====Benefits of homework====

Studies have shown that classroom instruction and homework can complement one another to result in deeper understanding and improved skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coutts|first=Pamela M.|date=2004-08-01|title=Meanings of Homework and Implications for Practice|url=https://doi.org/10.1207/s15430421tip4303_3|journal=Theory Into Practice|volume=43|issue=3|pages=182–188|doi=10.1207/s15430421tip4303_3|issn=0040-5841}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nova Scotia Department of Education provides the following recommendation for maximum daily homework for all subjects:
{| class="wikitable"
|-

|-
| 4 || 20–30 mins.
|-

Some strategies suggested for students to start self-monitoring and recording of time spent on homework.&lt;ref name="ednet"&gt;Homework Tips. In (2008). Nova Scotia Curriculum Documents Retrieved from https://sapps.ednet.ns.ca/Cart/items.php?CA=1&amp;UID=20090902095839142.227.51.61 http://www.ednet.ns.ca/pdfdocs/curriculum/Homework_Tips_10-12.pdf {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919195257/http://www.ednet.ns.ca/pdfdocs/curriculum/Homework_Tips_10-12.pdf|archivedate=20150919195257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Fisher and Nancy Frey use their research to create a four tiered progression of how homework can benefit students throughout their learning process:

# Fluency Building – A reading assignment related to the day's instructional material allows for the focus on one or two skills.
# Application – Students benefit from being asked to apply their newly gained knowledge independently after initial practice in the classroom.
# Spiral Review – Allows students to apply a number of skills learned in the not so recent past to prepare for major summative assessments. This enables students to develop more confidence and efficiency with material as long as students are able to "organize factual knowledge into larger core concepts".
# Extension – This takes the form of applying mastered knowledge cross-circularly or over many topics.&lt;ref name="fisherandfrey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ednet" /&gt;

====Problems with homework====

Homework is problematic when teachers' observations from the independent phase are not employed when determining how much and what kinds of expectations will be placed on students to accomplish for the next class. There is a concern that homework tasks are assigned prematurely in the instructional process and as a result, students learn things incorrectly. This is extremely problematic since it takes even more time to unlearn misconceptions and misunderstandings.&lt;ref name="fisherandfrey"/&gt;

The Nova Scotia Department of Education states that "students learn to assume responsibility for the independent completion of homework through a process of successive and structured release of responsibility. It is therefore important that homework assignments are geared to the realities of students' developing skills to avoid undue frustration and disengagement."&lt;ref name="ednet_a" /&gt;

In the same survey sponsored by MetLife, 26% of secondary teachers said they often assign homework due to time restrictions which Fisher and Frey suggest to be problematic because this implies that students are regularly given homework assignments for which they are not adequately prepared.&lt;ref name="fisherandfrey" /&gt;

Homework can be a meaningful part of the independent phase of learning when administered thoughtfully based on the observations made during the independent phase of the gradual release of responsibility framework.

'''Hans Adolf Karl Wilhelm Grischkat''' (29 August 1903&lt;ref name="Who" /&gt; – 10 January 1977) was a German conductor, especially a choral conductor, also a church musician and academic teacher. He founded the choir {{ill|Schwäbischer Singkreis|de}} for pioneering concerts and recordings of works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]] in the spirit of [[historically informed performance]]. He was the church musician of the {{ill|Christuskirche, Reutlingen|de|Christuskirche (Reutlingen)|lt=Christuskirche}} in [[Reutlingen]], published Bach cantatas for [[Hänssler]], and was from 1950 a professor of choral conducting at the [[State University of Music and Performing Arts Stuttgart|Musikhochschule Stuttgart]].

== Career ==
Grischkat was born in [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref name="Rastatt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scholz" /&gt; He studied at the [[University of Tübingen]], first natural sciences, then [[musicology]]. He studied at the [[Musikhochschule Stuttgart]] with {{ill|Hermann Keller|de|Hermann Keller (Musikwissenschaftler)}}.&lt;ref name="Rastatt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BC" /&gt;

Grischkat was active in the {{ill|Jugendmusikbewegung|de}}.&lt;ref name="Scholz" /&gt; He founded in 1924 the ''Reutlinger Singkreis'', in 1931 the {{ill|Schwäbischer Singkreis|de}} and in 1936 in Stuttgart the ''Grischkat-Singkreis''. In 1945, he founded the orchestra ''Schwäbisches Symphonie-Orchester Reutlingen'' which is now known as the ''{{ill|Württembergische Philharmonie Reutlingen|de}}'', serving as the conductor until 1950.

Grischkat was in 1926 the first in [[Württemberg]] to perform Bach's ''[[St John Passion]]'' without cuts, and with period instruments.&lt;ref name="Rastatt" /&gt; In 1935 he conducted Bach's ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' in [[historically informed performance]], which became influential in southern Germany.

To celebrate Bach's bicentenary of death in 1950, Grischkat compiled single cantata movements, with new texts, to a concert ''Vom Reiche Gottes'' (Of God's Kingdom),&lt;ref name="Rastatt" /&gt; following an idea by [[Albert Schweitzer]].&lt;ref name="Keller" /&gt;

Grischkat was at the same time the church musician of the {{ill|Christuskirche, Reutlingen|de|Christuskirche (Reutlingen)|lt=Christuskirche}} in [[Reutlingen]] and from 1950 a professor of choral conducting at the [[State University of Music and Performing Arts Stuttgart|Musikhochschule Stuttgart]].&lt;ref name="Rastatt" /&gt; Among his students were [[Frieder Bernius]], [[Wolfgang Gönnenwein]], {{ill|Hanns-Friedrich Kunz|de}} and [[Helmuth Rilling]].

He edited and published for [[Hänssler]] the series ''Die Kantate'', offering sheet music of sacred works and background. He died in [[Stuttgart]].&lt;ref name="Rastatt" /&gt;

== Recording ==

On 19 March 1883 Chiplunkar was appointed as a member of the Poona Municipal Corporation where he effected administrative reform currently practiced, an honor given to twelve distinguished citizens including [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], [[Jyotirao Phule]], Dr. [[R. P. Paranjpe|R.P. Paranjpe]] (KCIE), [[Hari Narayan Apte]], Dr. Vishram Ramji Ghole, and [[M. Visvesvaraya|Sir M Visvesvaraya]].

Chiplunkar was a founding member of the [[Deccan Education Society]], Pune, and [[Fergusson College]], and remained an active member of the Satyashodhak Samaj from 1858-1883.

Known for his charismatic personality and affable nature, Hari Raoji Chiplunkar struck a friendship with the [[Duke of Connaught]] for whom he hosted a reception and banquet in 1888. Chiplunkar built the Connaught House in what is known today as Sadhu Vaswani Chowk, where the Duke and Duchess of Connaught were given a red carpet reception. It was at this banquet, on 2 March 1888 where among the royal guests, dignitaries, industrialists and preeminent families from Bombay and Pune, Mahatma Phule chose to appear as a poor farmer wearing only a short dhoti, an old shirt, and worn out shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unipune.ac.in/chairs/mahatma_phule_chair/mphule_webfiles/Life_%20&amp;%20_Work.htm | title=Life And Work of Mahatma Jotirao Phule | publisher=University of Pune | accessdate=26 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He proceeded to make a stirring speech on the destitution of the untouchables and lower classes, encouraged the Duke to visit the villages of India and witness the conditions shared by nearly nineteen crore Indians living in abject poverty. He also asked the Duke convey to Queen Victoria his message about emancipating the masses through education.

Social reformer [[Savitribai Phule]] was present at Hari Raoji Chiplunkar's funeral in 1896. In 1991, the City of Pune, named the Hari Raoji Chowk commemorating Chiplunkar in Somwar Peth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mangudkar|first1=M.P.|title=Dr.|publisher=Sakal Newspaper|date=19 May 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iran]] has a large network of [[Private University|private]], [[Public University|public]], and state affiliated universities offering degrees in higher education. State-run universities of Iran are under the direct supervision of Iran's [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology]] (for non-medical universities) and [[Ministry of Health and Medical Education]] (for medical schools). According to article 3 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iran guarantees "free education and physical training for everyone at all levels, and the facilitation and expansion of higher education."

==History==

===Pre-Islamic era===
{{See also|Academy of Gundishapur}}
The existence of pre-Islamic era universities such as the [[School of Nisibis]], [[Sarouyeh]], [[Reishahr]], and The [[Academy of Gundishapur]] provide examples of precedence of academic institutions of science that date back to ancient times.

===Islamic era===
{{see also|Hawza|Nizamiyya}}
[[Image:Maqamat hariri.jpg|thumb|right|An academic library in [[Basrah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamic-art.net/blog/archives/000093.php|title=ソムリエの資格はイタリア|author=|date=|work=Islamic-art.net|access-date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; depicted in the 13th century by Yahya ibn Vaseti (یحیی بن واسطی), found in the [[Maqama]] of Hariri (مقامات حریری).]]
The traditions and heritage of these centers of higher learning were later carried on to schools such as Iran's [[Nizamiyya]], and Baghdad's [[House of Wisdom]], during the Islamic era.

===Modern===
It was [[Abbas Mirza]] who first dispatched Iranian students to Europe for a western education.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Clawson]] and [[Michael Rubin (historian)|Michael Rubin]]. ''Eternal Iran''. Palgrave Macmillan. 2005. {{ISBN|1-4039-6276-6}} p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the establishment of ''western style'' academic universities in Iran (Persia) dates back to 1851 with the establishment of [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Darolfonoon]] – which was founded as a result of the efforts of the royal vizier ''[[Amir Kabir|Mirza Taghi Khan Amir Kabir]]'', aimed at training and teaching Iranian experts in many fields of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hassan pour|first1=Faramarz|title=Design of Higher Education Learning Spaces in Iran; From the Qajar Period to the Present Time|journal=Snapshots International Symposium on Learning Spaces, the University of Melbourne|date=5 June 2014|doi=10.13140/2.1.2169.5040|url=http://hdl.handle.net/11343/42271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1855 "The Ministry of Science" was first established, and Ali Gholi Mirza I'tizad al-saltaneh (علیقلی میرزا اعتضاد السلطنه) was appointed Iran's first Minister of Science by [[Nasereddin Shah]].

By the 1890s [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Darolfonoon]] was competing with other prominent institutions of modern learning. The ''Military College of Tehran'' (Madraseh-ye Nezam), established in 1885 with a budget of 10,000-12,000 tomans, was its first rival; and in 1899 the [[Tehran School of Political Sciences|''College of political sciences'' (Madraseh-ye olum-e siyasi)]] was organized within the Foreign ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v6f6/v6f6a086.html Encyclopædia Iranica]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Higher Education, which oversees the operation of all institutes of higher education in Iran, was established in 1967. However, it was back in 1928 that Iran's first university, as we know it today, was proposed by an Iranian physicist, [[Mahmoud Hessaby]]. The University of Tehran (or Tehran University) was designed by French architect [[Andre Godard]], and built in 1934. Today, [[University of Tehran|Tehran University]] is Iran's largest university with over 32,000 students.

In the medical field, it was [[Joseph Cochran]] who first founded a professional school in Iran in 1878, and who is often credited for founding Iran’s "first contemporary medical college",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.ac.ir/AIM/0252/0252127.htm|title=ARCHIVES OF IRANIAN MEDICINE|author=|date=|work=ams.ac.ir|access-date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as founding one of Iran's first modern hospitals ("Westminster Hospital") in [[Urmia]]. The medical faculty Cochran established at [[Urmia University]] was joined by several other Americans, namely Drs. Wright, Homlz, van Nourdon, and Miller. They were all buried in [[Urmia]] as their resting place after serving the area for many years.

In Tehran, [[Samuel M. Jordan]], whom "Jordan Ave." in [[Tehran]] is named after, also was directly responsible for the expansion of the [[Alborz High School|American College in Tehran]]. The school received a permanent charter from the Board of Regents of the [[State University of New York]] in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Lorentz, J. ''Historical Dictionary of Iran''. 1995. {{ISBN|0-8108-2994-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:American College Tehran.JPG|thumb|right|''McCormick Hall, [[Alborz High School|American College of Tehran]]'', circa 1930.]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Tarikh.jpg|thumb|[[Shahid Beheshti University]](Former National University)1965]] --&gt;

By the end of the first Pahlavi period in 1941, the University of Tehran was still the only modern university in the country. Hence, the ministry of science commenced the establishment of other universities in [[Isfahan]], [[Tabriz]], [[Ahvaz]], and [[Shiraz]], with special emphasis given to the medical and veterinary sciences.&lt;ref&gt;''آموزش و پرورش در ایران'' (Education in Iran). [[Naser Takmil Homayoun]]. دفتر پژوهشهای فرهنگی (Center for Cultural Research Publications). p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Oberling]] was highly instrumental in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;''پروفسور ابرلن و نقش او در آموزش پزشکی نوین ایران'' (Dr. Charles Oberling and his role in Iran's modern medical education). شمس شریعت تربقان. [[Tehran University of Medical Sciences|TUMS]] Publications. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, there were four universities with 14,500 undergraduate students whereas in 1977 there were 16 universities with 154,315 undergraduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abrahamian|first=Ervand|title=Structural Causes of the Iranian Revolution|journal=MERIP Reports|date=May 1980|issue=87|pages=21–26|jstor=3011417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|The Shah]] soon initiated projects to build Iranian universities modeled after American schools. Thus ''Pahlavi University'' ([[Shiraz University]] today), [[Sharif University of Technology]], and [[Isfahan University of Technology]], three of Iran's top academic universities were all directly modeled on American institutions such as the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], [[MIT]], and the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/intrntnl/country/mideast.html|title=Trends by Region: MIDDLE EAST and Penn's Global Engagement, University of Pennsylvania University Archives|author=|date=|work=UPenn.edu|access-date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Exporting MIT''. Stuart W. Leslie and Robert Kargon. ''Osiris'', volume 21 (2006), pp. 110–130 Link: [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/resolve?doi=:10.1086/507138]&lt;/ref&gt; The Shah in return was generous in awarding American universities with financial gifts. For example, the [[University of Southern California]] received a gift from the Shah in the form of an endowed chair of [[petroleum engineering]], and a million dollar donation was given to the [[George Washington University]] to create an [[Iranistics|Iranian Studies]] program.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

[[Iranian revolution|The Iranian revolution]] put an end to the massive US-Iran academic relations. In 1980, a major overhaul in the academia and higher education system of Iran initiated by [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] led to what is referred to in Iran as "Iran's Cultural Revolution". However, all universities in the country were closed down from 1980 to 1983.&lt;ref name=parsi12&gt;{{cite book|title=Iran: A RevolutIonary RepublIc in TransItIon|publisher=Institute for Security Studies  European Union|location=Paris|isbn=978-92-9198-198-4|url=http://www.ab.gov.tr/files/ardb/evt/1_avrupa_birligi/1_9_politikalar/1_9_8_dis_politika/Iran_A_revolutionary_republic_in_transition.pdf|author=Paola Rivetti|editor=Rouzbeh Parsi|access-date=27 July 2013|format=Chaillot Papers|chapter=Islamic republic: shaping Iran’s  politics through the campus|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Islamic curricula and Islamic educational setting were introduced when the universities were reopened.&lt;ref name=parsi12/&gt;

In 1986, the ministry of higher education handed over supervision and overseeing of education in the medical sciences in Iran to the ministry of health, treatment and medical education. This was to optimize use of the medical resources in the country, and to promote health, treatment, teaching, and research more efficiently in the field.

After the [[Iran–Iraq War]], some new universities were founded and doctoral programs were developed in the previous universities. The number of university students is now more than six times as many as in 1979 (when Shah was overthrown), so that critics debate whether the national entrance exam is useful anymore or not.

==Academic system of Iranian universities==
{{see also|Science and technology in Iran|Islamic Azad University}}
[[Image:TUMS4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tehran University of Medical Sciences]]' ''Tehran Heart Center'']]
In 2008, Iran had over 3.5 million students enrolled in universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irphe.ir/fa/statistics/Statictics%20Forms/w-br.bruoshoor83-84.pdf|title=موسسه پژوهش و برنامه ریزی آموزش عالی|first=yektaweb|last=يكتاوب|date=|work=irphe.ir|access-date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some 1.7 million in various programs in Islamic Azad university and the remainder in State universities.   In addition the new enrollment numbers for the academic year 2004 were 290 thousand in Azad universities, and 250 thousand in state universities. Iran has 54 state operated universities, and 42 state medical schools. These are primarily the top choice for students in national entrance exams, and have the largest and most prestigious programs. There are 289 major private universities operating as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msrt.ir/htm/Ministry/History.htm History.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312020109/http://www.msrt.ir/htm/Ministry/History.htm |date=2007-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition there are over 40,000 students engaged in master's programs and 20,000 students in PhD programs.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In all these schools, except for private universities such as the [[Islamic Azad University]] system, tuition and room and board is mostly paid for by the government. The universities themselves largely operate on state budgets. There are also institutes like [[Payame Noor University]] that offer degrees remotely or online.

Some schools offer degrees in conjunction with European universities. The [[International University of Chabahar]] for example offers programs under the guidance of [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths University of London]], and [[Royal Holloway]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iuc.ac.ir/aboutus-aboutus-fa.html دانشگاه بین المللی چابهار&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other schools such as the [[Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences]] in [[Zanjan (city)|Zanjan]], have close collaboration with The [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] in [[Trieste]], [[Italy]] for workshops, seminars, and summer schools. The Iranian government also offers intensely competitive but fully paid scholarships for successful applicants to pursue PhD-level studies in several foreign countries, mostly [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msrt.ir/fa/service/58/%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%88-%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%B3-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%AC%D9%88%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86|title=اعزام و بورس دانشجویان|website=www.msrt.ir|language=fa|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 2000, Iran allocated around 0.4% of its [[GDP]] to [[R&amp;D]], which ranks it "far behind industrialized societies" and the world average of 1.4%.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.ac.ir/AIM/0141/malekzadeh0141.html|title=Medical Science and Research in Iran|author=|date=|work=ams.ac.ir|access-date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009 this ratio of research to GDP reached 0.87% and the set target is 2.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irantradelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Irans-Foreign-Trade-Regime-Report.pdf |title=irantradelaw.com |author= |date= |work=IranTradeLaw.com |access-date=8 February 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310232210/http://www.irantradelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Irans-Foreign-Trade-Regime-Report.pdf |archivedate=10 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prominent libraries in Iran==
Large libraries existed in Iran both before and after the advent of Islam and throughout many periods in Iran's history, including the libraries at [[Gondeshapur]], [[School of Nisibis]], and [[Sarouyeh]] during the pre-Islamic era of Iran.

During the Middle Ages, many schools of [[Nizamiyya]] harbored large collections of manuscripts and treatises. In [[Maragheh]], [[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī]] built a library that reportedly contained some 40,000 volumes which was well financed&lt;ref&gt;S. H. Nasr, Oliver Leaman. ''History of Islamic Philosophy''. Vol I. {{ISBN|0-415-25934-7}}. 1993. p. 542&lt;/ref&gt; and the royal library of the [[Samanid]] court in which [[Avicenna]] was granted special access to, is yet another fine example.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Medicine''. Ralph H. Major. Vol 1. Charles C. Thomas Publishers. 1954. p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

The first prototype of a modern national library in Iran was the Library of [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dar al-Funun College]] established in 1851. In 1899 another library called the Nation's Library was inaugurated in [[Tehran]]. Finally, the [[National Library of Iran]] was inaugurated in 1937.

Iran's major national libraries today are:
* [[National Library of Iran]], [[Tehran]]
* [[Central Library of Astan Quds Razavi]], [[Mashad]]
* [[Tabriz National Library]], [[Tabriz]]
* [[Malek National Library]], Tehran
* [[Ayatollah Marashi Najafi Library]], [[Qom]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020330114509/http://marashilibrary.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Iran's Library of The Parliament]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.majlislib.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011229085415/http://www.majlislib.com/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 December 2001|title=Professional Manufacturers &amp; Suppliers from China|author=|date=|work=MajlisLib.com|access-date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology and politics in higher education==
{{see also|Government of Iran}}
Under the rule of the Islamic [[theocracy]] in [[Iran]] since 1979 revolution, the status of science and education has been dramatically affected in the country. In particular, following the so-called [[Iranian Cultural Revolution]] and Islamization of universities after a shutdown period,&lt;ref name="parsi12"/&gt; the quality of science and technology required for development dropped significantly but has since been revived, so much so that Iran ranked 40th in science production and first in scientific growth in the world in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://presstv.com/detail/218692.html Iran ranks first in scientific growth. PressTV, December 31, 2011. Retrieved January 7, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keddie, ''Modern Iran'', (2003), p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exclusion of students===

====Religious====
{{see also|Persecution of Bahá'ís}}
Students of some minority religions have been barred from entering tertiary education institutions in Iran, particularly those of the [[Baha'i Faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bahai.org/story/601|title=New tactic obstructs Baha'i enrollments in Iranian universities - Bahá'í World News Service|author=|date=|work=Bahai.org|access-date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Iranian Revolution of 1979 Baha'i students have been excluded from universities regardless of their national university examination results on basis of their religion. See [[Bahá'í Institute for Higher Education]].

====Gender-based====
{{see also|Iranian restrictions on women's education}}

Additionally, in August 2012, 36 universities declared that 77 BA and BSc courses in 2012–2012 academic year would be "single gender" and effectively exclusive to men, limiting the options of female undergraduate students.&lt;ref name=tt2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Tait|first=Robert|title=Anger as Iran bans women from universities|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/9487761/Anger-as-Iran-bans-women-from-universities.html|access-date=21 August 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneurship==
{{See also|Science in Iran#Technology parks|Venture capital in Iran|Communications in Iran#Technology start-ups}}

In accordance with the [[Economy of Iran#National economic planning|third five-year development plan]], the “entrepreneurship development plan in Iranian universities”, (known as KARAD Plan) was developed, and launched in twelve universities across the country, under the supervision of [[Management and Planning Organization of Iran|Management and Planning Organization]] and the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150915104200/http://www.cgiran.org/main/images/files/20140429102612_IranEntrepreneurshipEcosystemReport-IEA2013-v2.pdf 20140429102612_IranEntrepreneurshipEcosystemReport-IEA2013-v2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brain drain and students abroad==
{{main article|Iran's brain drain|Iranian citizens abroad|Demography of Iran|Economy of Iran}}

Iran tops the world countries in the brain drain phenomenon. In 2002, the CIA estimated that 77% of Iran's population aged 15 and over can read and write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html |title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency |author= |date= |work=CIA.gov |access-date=8 February 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203093100/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html |archivedate=3 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, the adult literacy rate had reached 80.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/iran/literacy-rate|title=Iran - Literacy rate|author=|date=|work=IndexMundi.com|access-date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant majority of this population is at or approaching collegiate levels. Of this population, nearly 150,000 are estimated to exit Iran every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Frances |last=Harrison |title=Huge cost of Iranian brain drain |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6240287.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=8 January 2007 |access-date=8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[BBC: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6240287.stm 6240287.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Iranian government, in 2013, 12,000 foreign students were studying at Iranian universities while 55,686 Iranian students were studying abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/13/feb/1151.html|title=12,000 foreign students studying at Iranian universities|author=|date=|work=Payvand.com|access-date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of this number, 8,883 students were studying in Malaysia, 7,341 in the United States, 5,638 in Canada, 3,504 in Germany, 3,364 in Turkey, 3,228 in Britain, and the rest in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/13/jul/1094.html|title=14,000 foreign students studying in Iran|author=|date=|work=Payvand.com|access-date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-33238813|title=US universities on symbolic visit to Iran|first=Sean|last=Coughlan|date=23 June 2015|publisher=|access-date=8 February 2017|via=www.BBC.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; But according to a newer estimate by the Minister of education, between 350 and 500 thousand Iranians were studying outside of the country in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/14/sep/1002.html|title=Over 350,000 Iranians studying abroad: Education Minister|author=|date=|work=Payvand.com|access-date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference remains unexplained. As of 2015, 42% of recent/young graduates were unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://presstv.com/Detail/2015/04/25/408001/Iran-unemployment-jobless-graduate|title=PressTV-42% of Iranian graduates jobless|author=|date=|work=PressTV.com|access-date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5388">The term '''interdiscipline''' or '''inter-discipline''' means an organizational unit that involves two or more [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]]s, but which have the formal criteria of disciplines such as dedicated research journals, conferences and university departments. It is related to '''[[interdisciplinarity]]''', but it is a noun used for a certain kind of unit ([[academic discipline]]). As shown in the example of demography below a field may be both a discipline and an interdiscipline at the same time.  The example of Information science demonstrates that a field may be regarded as a discipline in some countries but an interdiscipline in other countries.

==Conceptions==
Giesecke (1981)&lt;ref&gt;Giesecke, Hermann (1981). ''Indføring i pædagogik''. København: Nyt Nordisk Forlag. German original: ''Einführung in die Pädagogik.'' München: Juventa 1970 (2. Auflage)&lt;/ref&gt; says about educational research ("[[Pedagogy]]") that is an "[[aporetic]] science", i.e. an interdiscipline.

Tengström (1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tengström, E.|year=1993|title=Biblioteks- och informationsvetenskapen - ett fler- eller tvärvetenskapligt område?|journal=Svensk Biblioteksforskning|issue=1|pages=9–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphases that cross-disciplinary research is a process, not a state or structure. He differentiates three levels of ambition regarding cross-disciplinary research:

*The [[pluridisciplinary]] or [[multidisciplinarity]] level
*The genuine cross-disciplinary level: [[interdisciplinarity]]
*The discipline-forming level [[transdisciplinarity]]

What is described here is a view of social fields as dynamic and changing. [[Library and information science]] is viewed as a field that started as a [[multidisciplinary approach]] based on literature, psychology, sociology, management, computer science etc., which is developing towards an [[academic discipline]] in its own right.

==Examples==
*Biosemiotics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Augustyn, P.|year=2008|title=Biosemiotics: Protoscience, interdiscipline, new biology|journal=Semiotica|volume=172|issue=1–4|pages=479–487|doi=10.1515/SEMI.2008.107}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Demography
:"As a field with its own body of interrelated concepts, techniques, journals, and professional associations, demography is clearly a discipline. But by the nature of its subject matter and methods demography is just as clearly an 'interdiscipline', drawing heavily on biology and sociology for the study of fertility; on economics and geography for studies of migration; and on the health sciences for the study of mortality." (Stycos, 1989, vii).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Stycos, J Mayone|year=1989|title=Demography as an interdiscipline|location=New Brunswick, New Jersey|publisher=Transactions Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kepler Museum''' is a museum of [[astronomy]] in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]], named for the German astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]]. It was founded in 2009, the [[International Year of Astronomy]], with financial support from the Magistrate of the Capital City of Prague and Agentura ProVas, professional and organisational support from the [[Czech Astronomic Society]] and using premises owned by Jitka Steinwaldová.

The three circles in the logo of the Kepler Museum represent the planet [[Mars]], the [[Earth]], and the [[Sun]], the bodies whose mutual positions were studied by Johannes Kepler while he was in the city. The entrance tickets to the museum feature the astronomic dial of the [[Prague Astronomical Clock]] with the exact moment of entry to the museum, with the same data also expressed in the Old Bohemian and in the Babylonian manner. The [[sidereal time]] is also included. The entrance tickets were designed by [[Vojtěch Sedláček]], CEO of Agentura ProVás.

On 31 December 2017, the Kepler Museum in the Old Town closed after eight years, to be taken over by the [[National Technical Museum (Prague)|National Technical Museum]] (NTM). The Kepler Museum exhibition is being transferred to NTM premises on Letná. The scheduled opening Summer 2018.

In Singapore, [[language planning]] is associated with government planning. In this top-down approach, the government influences the acquisition of languages and their respective functions within the [[speech community]] through the education system.&lt;ref name= Kaplan&gt;Kaplan B., Robert, and Richard B. Baldauf Jr. ''Language Planning from Practice to Theory.''  Clevedon: Multilingual Matters ltd., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Language planning aims to facilitate effective communication within the speech community, which can result in a language shift or language assimilation.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias&gt;Cobarrubias, Juan.  "Ethical Issues in Status Planning."  ''Progress in Language Planning: International Perspectives''.  Eds.  Juan Cobarrubias and Joshua Fishman.  New York: Mouton Publishers, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of language planning are very much dependent on the political and social forces present in Singapore during two distinct periods: [[Colonization|Colonisation]] by the British and the Post-Independence period after 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Spolsky, B. (2004). Language policy. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Singapore is a linguistically and ethnically diverse country with a population of about 5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.google.com.sg/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_pop_totl&amp;idim=country:SGP&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=population+of+singapore, | title=World Development Indicators - Google Public Data Explorer | website=www.google.com.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officially, its ethnic composition is approximately 76.8% Chinese, 13.9% Malay, 7.9% Indian, while the remaining 1.4% are mainly Others, a miscellaneous category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehis.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&amp;hid=120&amp;sid=7e115396-984a-4c45-9480-7bb44b801cc1%40sessionmgr11, 'Burdens' and 'handicaps' in Singapore Language Policy: on the limits of language management', p. 98] {{Dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given this diversity, the [[language policy]] in Singapore aims at cultivating amongst its citizens a bilingual proficiency in the English language and a mother tongue that is officially assigned to the specific ethnic communities.

Although the English language is excluded from the list of official mother tongues (Mandarin, Bahasa Melayu, Tamil), it is still recognised as an [[official language]] for practical reasons such as ensuring socio-economic mobility. This is because the ethnically neutral status of English helps to ensure that the distribution of economic advantages is not seen as unduly privileging or benefiting a specific ethnic group, which would otherwise raise the danger of inter-ethnic tension. Additionally, the English language represents the idea of 'modernity' and its association with progress, science, technology and capitalism.&lt;ref name=Pakir&gt;Pakir, A. (1997), 'Education and Invisible Language Planning: The Case of the English Language in Singapore', in Tan, Gopinathan and Ho, pp. 57–74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations of Language Policies==
After [[political independence]] in 1959, the Singapore Government officially accepted Malay as the [[national Language]] of Singapore. However, its importance gradually declined as a result of the social, political and economic developments that had taken place. When vernacular schools were closed in 1987, the Ministry of Education implemented the National System of Education.&lt;ref name=Mohamed&gt;Mohamed, S. (2005) Planning for Malay Language in Education. Centre for Research in Pedagogy and Practice. Nanyang Institute of Education,Singapore.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bilingual Policy encourages Singaporeans to be proficient in both the English language, and in their respective ethnic [[mother tongues]], which include Chinese [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Malay language|Malay]], and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. [[Bilingual education]] is provided by the [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education]] in Singapore.

The Bilingual Policy also aims to promote better understanding amongst the three ethnic groups in line with the effort of [[nation building]]. Additionally, there was also the growing concern that Singapore was facing increasing Western influences, effecting a potential threat of the de-Asianisation or de-culturalisation of the people. Due to the increasing importance of English as an international language, many Singaporeans have started to pay more attention to the learning of the English language and focus less on the learning of their own mother tongue. The Bilingual Policy was then enacted to safeguard Asian identities and values. Alongside English, the [[Singapore Government]] aims to promote Mandarin Chinese, Malay and Tamil so as to prevent the erosion of culture and heritage of the three ethnic groups&lt;ref name=Mohamed /&gt;

Racial harmony is a stated policy of the [[government of Singapore|Singaporean government]], and a [[racial harmony day]] is even celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sam11.moe.gov.sg/racialharmony/index.htm |title=Welcome to the MOE Racial Harmony Website |last= |first= |date= |year=2010 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |accessdate=2013-06-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126120920/http://www.racialharmony.edu.sg/cos/o.x?c=%2Frhd%2Fpagetree&amp;func=view&amp;rid=4921 |archivedate=26 November 2010 |author=Ministry of Education, Singapore |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of four official languages is an element of policy designed to promote racial harmony, as is [[bilingual]]ism in accordance with the belief that the ethnic language is the "carrier of culture" while English is the "language of commerce", a choice motivated by the fact that English had historically been the language of the colonial administration, while being the native language of few Singaporeans at the time of the policy's implementation.&lt;ref name="clammer"&gt;{{cite book | title = Race and State in Independent Singapore 1965-1990 | last = Clammer | first = John | publisher = Ashgate | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-1-84014-029-3 | location=Brookfield | pages=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; With English as the [[lingua franca]], no one ethnicity is favored, but the cultures are preserved. The idea behind this policy is that treating all languages as standard and thus equally prestigious will result in the speakers of each language being treated equally.&lt;ref name="vasil"&gt;{{cite book | title = Asianing Singapore: The PAP's Management of Ethnicity | last = Vasil | first = Raj | publisher = Heinemann Asia | year =1995 |isbn=| location = Singapore | pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Singaporean government promotes [[Standard Singapore English]] as a ''lingua franca'', it heavily discourages the usage of [[Singlish]], a Chinese- and Malay-influenced, [[English-based creole language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nbu.bg/PUBLIC/IMAGES/File/departamenti/4ujdi%20ezitsi%20i%20literaturi/Doklad_Adrien_2.pdf |title=Chinese-based lexicon in Singapore English, and Singapore-Chinese culture |first=Adrian |last=Tien |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127055450/http://nbu.bg/PUBLIC/IMAGES/File/departamenti/4ujdi%20ezitsi%20i%20literaturi/Doklad_Adrien_2.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/events/lingo/papers/jakob.leimgruber.pdf |title=From Post-Creole Continuum to Diglossia: The Case of Singapore English |first=Jakob  |last=Leimgruber |publisher=University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; widely spoken by Singaporeans, but virtually unintelligible to foreign speakers of English.

Y. Ooi (ed.), ''Evolving Identities: The English Language in Singapore and Malaysia'', Singapore: Times Academic Press, pp. 12-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (1998) 'Approaches to Diglossia in the Classroom: The Middle Way. REACT, 2, 18-23.' [http://videoweb.nie.edu.sg/phonetic/papers/diglossia.html (on-line version)]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Media Development Authority]], a statutory board of the government, urges Singaporean mass media to use as little Singlish as possible, declaring it appropriate only for "interviews, where the interviewee speaks only Singlish".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mda.gov.sg/wms.file/mobj/mobj.612.fta_tv_prog_code.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these policies, however, the usage of Singlish outside formal, institutional contexts remains widespread.

The Singaporean government also promotes a single, standardized form of Chinese, discouraging the usage of dialects. While the [[Chinese Singaporean|Chinese community of Singapore]] historically spoke several [[varieties of Chinese]], most of them [[mutually unintelligible]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091016073611/http%3A//www3.telus.net/linguisticsissues/singapore.html 'A Critical Evaluation of Singapore's Language Policy and its Implications for English Teaching by Manfred Wu Man-Fat, Hong Kong.'] Retrieved on 4 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bokhorst-Heng, W.D.

Singapore: Singapore University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Cantonese]], [[Teochew Chinese|Teochew]], and [[Hokkien]], the government has promoted [[Standard Mandarin]], both as a means of unifying Chinese Singaporeans under a common language, and to facilitate communication with Chinese people from outside Singapore. Since 1979, the [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] has promoted use of Mandarin.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Language Ideology===
There were two prominent [[language ideology|language ideologies]] that the Singapore government adopted:

* '''Internationalization'''
** It entails the adoption of a non-[[indigenous language]] as an [[official language]]. The Singapore government adopted a non-indigenous language, English, to exist alongside the indigenous languages of Singapore.
* '''Linguistic Pluralism'''
** It entails a recognition and support of the co-existence of multiple languages within society.
** Some believe it to be in contrast with the language ideology of [[Language shift|linguistic assimilation]], where every member of the [[speech community]], regardless of his [[first language]], must learn the dominant language of the society where he lives in.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias /&gt;

After independence, the Singapore government gave English Language, Mandarin Chinese, Malay Language and Tamil Language shared official status.&lt;ref name="Cobarrubias"/&gt;

The Singapore government attempts to shun away from linguistic assimilation, as it believes it must acknowledge the need to embrace the co-existence of the four official languages in the context of a [[multi-racial]] Singapore.

==Status Planning==
'''Status Planning''' suggests that a particular language or variety may be chosen for specific purposes and given official status. This may result in a [[language policy]] which is a product of [[language planning]], and can be comprehended within the discourse of [[language politics]] and society, or the more informal but powerful political and social aspects of language planning. In this view, one can argue that language status planning issues are related to political issues as status planning focuses on legislative decisions that affect the reallocation of language functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bibliotecavirtualut.suagm.edu/Glossa/Journal/jun2007/Language%20Planning,%20Policy%20and%20Implementation%20in%20South%20Africa.pdf,|title='Language Policy, Planning and Implementation in South Africa', p. 5|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language status can also mean the position or standing of a language vis-à-vis other languages.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;Edwards, John. "Language, Prestige, and Stigma." ''Contact Linguistics''. Ed. Hans Goebel. New York: de Gruyter, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Singapore Government]] recognises the importance of the English language for a multi-racial society and therefore it has been attributed the status of an [[official language]] and a de facto [[national language]]. The government has been active in promoting [[status planning]] in Singapore. One of the most distinct changes in the linguistic landscape of Singapore after independence was promoting the status of the English language. This is done by allocating resources to develop English in various functional domains such as the government, law, business, administration, and in particular, the medium of instruction in schools—even though time is allocated for the learning of Mother tongue languages.

English is the international [[lingua franca]], it was no longer viewed as a colonial language but rather an [[World language|international language]] permitting universal communication. The economic rewards of being proficient in English was emphasised upon perpetuating the mindset that English is the superior language in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Yip, J. S. K., Eng, S. P. and Yap, J. Y. C. (1997), '25 Years of Education Reform', in Tan, Gopinathan and Ho, pp. 3–32&lt;/ref&gt; Besides government administrative domains where English is widely practised, English has gradually been inculcated into social, family and individual habitats as well. Despite the government's attempt to maintain symbolic and cultural capital in the [[Mother tongues]], English has been deeply integrated into the local linguistic landscape of Singapore.&lt;ref name=Silver&gt;Silver, R. E. (2005). The discourse of linguistic capital: Language and economic policy planning in Singapore. Language Policy, 4(1), 47–66&lt;/ref&gt;

It is evident that English has acquired a significant role in the linguistic landscape of Singapore, as Singapore is the only (non-native speaker) country which has adopted English as a working language, short of Singapore, no other country has channelled its language policies into churning out a population that is bi-literate in English and another official language.&lt;ref name=Pakir /&gt;

===Speak Good English Movement (SGEM)===
{{Main|Speak Good English Movement}}

The '''Speak Good English Movement''' is a government-initiated campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singapore-window.org/sw99/90830afp.htm,|title='Singapore to launch speak-good English campaign'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims "to encourage Singaporeans to speak grammatically correct English that is universally understood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goodenglish.org.sg/category/movement/about-us |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401182533/http://www.goodenglish.org.sg/category/movement/about-us |archivedate=1 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }} Speak Good English Movement website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Singapore government sees [[Singlish]] as a variety whose increasing popularity might threaten the ability of [[Singaporeans]] to acquire competence in 'good' English. The latter is prized as a linguistic resource in a world of global economic competition, and the government fears that the presence of Singlish might actually undermine English language proficiency. This led the government, in 2000, to initiate the Speak Good English Movement (SGEM).&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&amp;hid=120&amp;sid=7e115396-984a-4c45-9480-7bb44b801cc1%40sessionmgr11,|title='Burdens' and 'handicaps' in Singapore Language Policy: on the limits of language management', p. 99|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 August 1999, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reported [[Lee Kuan Yew]], Singapore's first Prime Minister, commented on Singlish as a 'handicap':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Those Singaporeans who can speak good English should help to create a good environment for speaking English, rather than advocate, as some do, the use of Singlish… Singlish is a handicap we must not wish on Singaporeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&amp;hid=120&amp;sid=7e115396-984a-4c45-9480-7bb44b801cc1%40sessionmgr11,|title='Burdens' and 'handicaps' in Singapore Language Policy: on the limits of language management', p. 102|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Controversy of the campaign====
While the Speak Good English Movement has seen progress through its engagement via radio shows, on television programmes, and in giving out the 'Inspiring Teacher of English' award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodenglish.org.sg/|title=Speak Good English Movement|website=www.goodenglish.org.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has controversy as well. Despite the government's label of Singlish as a 'handicap', the latter endorsed the usage of Singlish on more than one occasion.

=====SARS crisis=====
When the [[SARS]] crisis broke out in 2003, the Singapore government commissioned a SARS rap song (sometimes known as the "SAR-vivor Rap") to emphasise the importance of proper hygiene.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; The lyrics of the SARS rap song are heavily [[Singlish]], containing terms such as "lah", "leh", and "kiasu".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartlyrics.com/Song562033-Phua-Chu-Kang-Sarvivor-Rap-lyrics.aspx] SARS RAP Lyrics&lt;/ref&gt;

To answer its contradictory stance, the Singapore government provided a rationale that "Singlish was considered necessary in order to communicate with less-educated Singaporeans".&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

=====Singapore Day=====
[[Singapore Day]] is a cultural-cum-[[cuisine]]-based event organised by the Prime Minister's Office Overseas Singaporean Unit. It is aimed at engaging Singaporeans residing overseas. It is held in different cities with a significant community of overseas Singaporeans.

According to a report by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' on 26 April 2009, the event made occasional use of [[Singlish]], such as the lexical item 'chope', which is used to indicate the reservation of a seat.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; The intended audience there is not the 'less-educated', since most of the overseas Singaporeans are working professionals or university students pursuing a degree abroad.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

==Acquisition Planning==
'''Acquisition Planning''' can be defined as the co-ordination of the [[language planning]] goals of the official parties involved in the implementation and integration of a language policy to ensure its timely and cost effective acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/acquisition-planning.html|title=What is acquisition planning? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Singapore, the government has sole control over the acquisition planning of language. This form of [[language planning]] is often done in line with [[status planning]]. The government aims to influence aspects of the language, status, distribution and literacy through the education system.&lt;ref&gt;Liddicoat, Anthony J., and Richard B.

===Curriculum Development Institute of Singapore===
The Curriculum Development Institute of Singapore (CDIS) was formed in 1980 as a division under the Ministry of Education. The institute had the sole task of producing teaching packages under the syllabuses prepared by the Curriculum Planning Division.&lt;ref name=Gopinathan /&gt; In 1998, the Ministry of Education recognised a need to incorporate innovative changes to its Education system besides the current Bilingual Policy. The Ministry introduced three important national initiatives: '''1)'''National Education, '''2)'''Information Technology and '''3)'''Thinking Skills, to the school curriculum&lt;ref name=Mohamed /&gt; The Curriculum Planning Division reduced the content of the existing syllabuses to integrate the three national initiatives into the school curriculum.

===Bilingual Policy===
Under the Bilingual Policy, all students are educated in English as their [[first language]]. The Ministry of Education ensures that the Bilingual Policy is met by students in Primary and Secondary schools- not only are they required to master English as their first language, they also have to learn their Mother Tongue as a [[second language]].&lt;ref name=Goh /&gt; They are offered [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Malay language|Malay]] or [[Tamil language|Tamil]] depending on their father's ethnicity.

While English is the core language of instruction in government schools, mother tongue languages are taught on a weekly basis. While "mother tongue" typically correlates to the first language (L1) overseas, in Singapore, the Ministry of Education refers to it as the "ethnic language" or the second language (L2).&lt;ref name=Goh /&gt; Singapore's language planning is known as exogenous planning, whereby a [[foreign language]] takes on the role as the main language of communication against the indigenous languages in the country. The education system aims to create a workforce that is bi-literate in English and Chinese/Malay/Tamil.&lt;ref name=Wu /&gt;

Despite the intentions of the bilingual policy, there has been an inherent and significant shift from a predominant use of Mandarin Chinese to English within the Chinese community.&lt;ref name="Chew, C. H. 2003 pp.133-154"&gt;Xu, D. M., Chew, C. H., &amp; Chen, S. C. (2003). Language use and language attitudes in Singapore's Chinese community. In S. Gopinathan, A. Pakir, W. K. Ho &amp; V. Saravanan. (Eds.) Language, society and education in Singapore: Issues and trends (pp. 133–154), Singapore: Marshall Cavendish International&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980 Population Census revealed that the use of Malay Language has dropped from 96.7% to 94.3%. The use of English Language in Malay households has increased from 2.3% to 5.5%.

====Outcome of Bilingual Policy====
Report on the Ministry of Education, 1978: Assessment of Bilingual Policy:

Formed in April 1978 and led by Deputy Prime Minister, Dr [[Goh Keng Swee]], the Goh Report assessed the bilingual education programme in Singapore.The Ministry of Education saw its Bilingualism policy as not being universally effective.&lt;ref name=Goh&gt;Goh, K. S. et al. (1979), Report on the Ministry of Education 1978. Singapore: Ministry of Education&lt;/ref&gt; The Goh Report critiqued the Bilingual policy as ineffective [[bilingualism]] leading to the main cause of language education problems in Singapore.&lt;ref name=Goh /&gt; Although the Bilingual policy resulted in a rise in overall literacy rate,&lt;ref&gt;Pakir, A. (1993), 'Two Tongue Tied: Bilingualism in Singapore', in Jones and Ozóg, pp. 73–90&lt;/ref&gt; statistics reveal that less than 40% of the School-going Students had the minimum competency level in two languages at a time.&lt;ref name=Goh /&gt;

Under the review of Singapore’s education system:

* At least 25% of the Primary school cohort did not meet the minimum criteria for literacy levels.
* Only 11% of the armed force recruits were adequately competent in English.
* 97.5% of the Primary 6 students who sat for the [[Primary School Leaving Examination]] (PSLE) obtained A*-C grades in English.
* 86.9% of the Secondary 4 students who sat for the GCE 'O' Level Examinations obtained A*-C grades in English.
* Despite increasing Language exposure time in the school curriculum, teaching strategies were ineffective in enhancing Students' language proficiency.

====Challenges and solutions of Bilingual Policy====
An increasing number of Singaporeans are speaking and using English at home, leading to declining standards in the command of Mother Tongue. The impact of the bilingualism policy however, differs from one ethnic group to another.&lt;ref name=Goh /&gt;

Report on the Ministry of Education (1978): Assessment of Bilingual policy for three ethnic groups; The Chinese community, the Malay Community, the Indian Community

=====The Chinese community=====
The Chinese community struggled with learning two languages; English and [[Mandarin Chinese]]. When Chinese students were exposed to Mandarin Chinese in school, they felt that the language was foreign and hard to grasp. The home context did not favour the learning of Mandarin Chinese because Chinese dialects; [[Hokkien]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Cantonese]], [[Hainanese]], [[Hakka]] were the dominant mode of communication at home depending on dialectal group. The Ministry of Education only allowed Mandarin Chinese in the classroom, Chinese dialects were seen as inferior in status and were an impediment to learning Mandarin Chinese.&lt;ref name=Wu&gt;Wu, M. (2005) A critical evaluation of Singapore's language policy and its implications for English Teaching. Hong Kong&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of the difficulties faced by the Chinese community, the government made several amendments to the educational system to help Chinese students cope with acquiring Mandarin Chinese:&lt;ref name=Mohamed /&gt;

* With the introduction of EM3 stream, Mandarin Chinese and other Primary school subjects were taught at a lower than mainstream level to help academically less inclined students cope with a less demanding curriculum.
* Introduction of Chinese B Mandarin Chinese is taught at a lower than mainstream level to help students with difficulties in Mandarin Chinese still be able to acquire the language at oral- language proficiency levels.
* Establishment of [[Singapore centre for Chinese language|Singapore Centre for Chinese Language]] (SCCL) in November 2009. In recognition of Chinese students who come from non –Mandarin speaking homes, the centre aims to enhance the effectiveness of teaching Chinese as a second language in a bilingual environment that is conducive to the needs of these students.
* The [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] (SMC) was organised in 1979 by then Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] to promote Chinese Language and Culture among Chinese Singaporeans. Essentially this annual event seeks to create heightened awareness of Singaporean Chinese Asian heritage.

=====The Malay Community=====
Malay is valued as the means for transmitting familial and religious values. Malay is widely practised in [[mosques]] and religious schools also known as '’Madrasahs'’. The use of [[Malay language]] has been largely reduced to religious and classroom domains only.&lt;ref name=Mohamed /&gt; The increase in the number of contexts of which English is being practised has resulted in a large proportion of the Malays assimilating to English.

As a result, the ML 'B' programme was introduced in 2000 to help less linguistically inclined students cope with acquiring the Malay language at oral- language proficiency levels. However, the ML 'B' programme was available only at secondary levels and was not offered at pre-university levels.&lt;ref name=Mohamed /&gt;

=====The Indian Community=====
Under the Bilingualism Policy, Singaporean Indians only had the option of [[Tamil language|Tamil]] for their Mother Tongue. Non-Tamil Indian Students were thus at a disadvantage. In recognition of this, the Ministry of Education revised the Bilingual Policy in 1989 to allow Indian Students to choose between [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Urdu]] as their Mother Tongue.&lt;ref name=Mohamed /&gt;

=====Revisions made to Bilingual Policy=====
The development and implementation of the Bilingual Policy is an example of acquisition planning.The Bilingual policy places excessive demands on average students. Most students tackle two foreign languages at primary school level because most of them speak Chinese dialects at home and Mandarin Chinese is used in schools for Chinese lessons.&lt;ref name=Gopinathan&gt;Gopinathan, S. (1980), 'Language Policy in Education: A Singapore Perspectiv3e’, in Afendras and Kuo, pp. 175–202&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Education felt that resources were not effectively employed to meet the goals of the policy. Therefore, amendments were made to allow for more flexibility and to cater to the diverse linguistic needs of the population:&lt;ref name=Goh /&gt;

* Students who could not cope with the demands of a Bilingual education could choose to focus on one language, i.e., English.
* Students who were linguistically inclined were encouraged to take on a third language, in addition to English and their Mother Tongue.

Under this new curriculum, the diverse needs of the students could be met and they could effectively maximise their linguistic capabilities. However, the issue of the lack of command in English was highlighted again in the "Report for Moral Education" in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Education (1979), Report on Moral Education. Singapore: Ministry of Education&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corpus Planning==
'''Corpus planning''' focuses on changes by deliberate planning to the actual corpus or shape of a language. It deals with [[Codification (linguistics)|codification]], and can play a significant role in implementation and elaboration stages. Elaboration can be considered as a language task resulting in increased sophistication of the chosen code.&lt;ref&gt;http://bibliotecavirtualut.suagm.edu/Glossa/Journal/jun2007/Language%20Planning,%20Policy%20and%20Implementation%20in%20South%20Africa.pdf, 'Language Planning, Policy and Implementation in South Africa, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Corpus planning is often undertaken by planners with great linguistic expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Haugen, E. (1983). The implementation of corpus planning: Theory and practice. In J. Cobarrubias &amp; J. A. Fishman (Eds.), Progress in language planning (pp. 269–290). Berlin, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; Corpus planning is also referred as making language planning decisions to engineer changes in the structure of a language.&lt;ref name=FergusonG&gt;Ferguson, Gibson. (2006). Language Planning and Education. Edinburgh University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The Singapore Government has been active in status planning and acquisition planning however with regards to corpus planning in English, nothing has been done.The government modelled [[Singaporean English]] after [[Standard British English]], without recognising the internal issues of English which must be specific to the local context.&lt;ref&gt;Gopinathan, S. and Saravanan, V. (1985), 'Varieties of English and Educational Linguistics: An Agenda for Research’, Singapore Journal of Education, Vol. 7, No. 1, pp. 64–71&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of a government body that deals with language issues such as codification and purification, there is negligence to local English,&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, A. F. (1988), ‘A Standard for Written Singapore English?’, in Foley, pp. 27–50&lt;/ref&gt; it becomes difficult to ascertain whether there is a Standard Singapore English.&lt;ref&gt;Strevens, P. (1980), Teaching English as an International Language: From Practice to Principle. Oxford: Pergamon&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to Chinese language, the government selected Mandarin Chinese as the variety of Chinese language that takes precedence over other social and regional dialects i.e., Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, Hainanese, Hakka.&lt;ref name=Christian&gt;Christian, Donna (1988). “Language Planning: the view from linguistics”, in Frederick J. Newmeyer, ''Language: the socio-cultural context'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 193–211&lt;/ref&gt; Standardization generally entails increasing the uniformity of the norm, as well as of the norm.&lt;ref name="FergusonG"/&gt; The government adopted Mandarin Chinese as one of the four official languages in Singapore and it is mandatory that the Chinese population in Singapore learn Mandarin Chinese as their mother tongue in schools. In addition the government launched the [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] to promote the prestige of Mandarin Chinese against other Chinese dialects.

===Speak Mandarin Campaign (SMC)===
{{Main|Speak Mandarin Campaign}}

The [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] was launched by then Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] in 1979. The campaign seeks to encourage the use of Mandarin and to discourage the use of [[dialects]], characterising the latter as 'burdens,' as summarized in [[Goh Chok Tong]]'s (then First [[Deputy Prime Minister]]) speech marking the 1986 Speak Mandarin Campaign:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Parents know that our bilingual education system is here to stay, when they drop dialects in conversation with their children they are recognising that the continued use of dialects will add to the learning burden of their children.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Outcome===
The success of the campaign was evident 20 years from the launch of the campaign. The campaign has significantly reduced the number of dialect speakers in Singapore. The use of Chinese dialect at home dropped from 81.4% in 1980 to 30.7% in 2000. Meanwhile, households that claimed to use Mandarin as the dominant language at home increased from 10.2% in 1980 to 35% in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] wiki page&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the campaign is successful in reducing the number of dialect speakers in Singapore, it is not always received positively. This is due to two key reasons:

* The Singapore Government does not abandon the usage of [[dialects]] fully.
* Members from other ethnic groups in Singapore felt that they were not treated fairly.

The reason why Mandarin has been chosen among the various Chinese dialects is that it is supposedly able to unite the different dialect groups, and it is also supposedly the variety associated with ancient Chinese culture and its values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&amp;hid=120&amp;sid=7e115396-984a-4c45-9480-7bb44b801cc1%40sessionmgr11,|title='Burdens' and 'handicaps' in Singapore Language Policy: on the limits of language management', p. 101|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is not to say that the government considers the dialects to be totally without cultural value. The government does at times acknowledge that the dialects are also capable of conveying traditional Chinese values.

Excerpted from a speech made by then Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] during the 1991 Speak Mandarin Campaign:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although [[Chinese literature]], idioms and proverb can be translated into English, their full meaning may be lost in the process. A Chinese Singaporean who does not know Chinese- either Mandarin or dialect- runs the risk of losing the collective wisdom of the Chinese civilization.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Non-Mandarin Chinese language speakers have complained that their children have to study two [[foreign languages]] — English and Mandarin.&lt;ref name="Chew, C. H. 2003 pp.133-154"/&gt; This is contrasted to a possible alternative policy of English and their [[native language]], and that the emphasis on Mandarin threatens family ties, as older generations are often not conversant in Mandarin (unless it is their native tongue). Some critics include that the Mandarin education system's goal of promoting cultural identity has left many younger generations of Mandarin speakers unable to communicate with their non-Mandarin Chinese language-speaking grandparents.

==Overview==
Singapore's Bilingual Policy has been commended on contributing to the country's economic success.&lt;ref name=Gopinathan /&gt; The social and political stability that Singapore has enjoyed all these years has also been attributed to the Bilingual policy.&lt;ref&gt;Gopinathan, S. (1977), 'Developing a Language Policy for Education in Singapore', in Crewe, pp. 46–67&lt;/ref&gt; There are however, a lot existing issues and potential problems underlying the bilingual policy, while the English language was useful in attaining national cohesion within the [[Multi-racial]] Country, [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Malay Language]], [[Tamil Language]] have lost their prestige in the society. To rectify these issues, the government, the policy makers and the teaching professions should co-operate with one another. As front-line practitioners, local teachers have direct experience on the needs and difficulties of students. Parents and peers are ''invisible planners'' who have power to determine the success of the government's language policy.&lt;ref name=Pakir /&gt; The collective collaboration of the government, policy makers, local teachers, parents and peers more effective and indigenised language policy can be designed.&lt;ref name=Wu /&gt;

Policy discourse in Singapore has largely overlooked the fact that the linguistic market consists of permeable boundaries and the value of linguistic capital for each language changes as internal and external factors interact together.&lt;ref name=Silver /&gt; The Ministry of Education was critiqued as failing to recognise that perceptions regarding linguistic capital can change, therefore Language Policy implementation (Bilingual Policy) need to consider the feelings and willingness of the recipients as this ultimately determines the final acceptance and success of the policy. Language Policy and implementations need to consider bottom up processes (Individuals and Unofficial Institutions), and not just designed from the top (Government and Official Agencies).&lt;ref&gt;Haarmann, H. (1990). Language planning in the light of a general theory of language: A methodological framework. International Journal of Sociology and Language, 86,103–126&lt;/ref&gt; The population’s perceptions regarding prestige and image of Ethnic Languages are important parameters that need to be established and analysed in accordance with the Government’s Language Policies plans to account for a multicultural country like Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Ager D. E. (2005). Image and prestige planning.Current Issues in Language Planning, 6(1), 1–43&lt;/ref&gt;

The political advantages that English has to offer cannot be denied. While the bilingual policy aims to educate its population in enhancing communication in the international market, it is also able to protect the cultural identities of the indigenous groups by embracing multiculturalism.However, the processes of [[globalisation]] exert increasing pressure on the population to assimilate towards English at the expense of their [[mother tongues]]. While diversity breeds potential threats to globalisation, long-term [[language planning]] must be sensitive enough to tackle the precarious linguistic situation to protect Mandarin Chinese, Malay and Tamil, perhaps even Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati and Urdu alongside English.&lt;ref&gt;Poon, A. Y. K (2004), Language Policy of Hong Kong: Its Impact on Language Education and Language Use in Post-Handover Hong Kong. Journal of Taiwan Normal University: Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Vol. 49, Issue 1, pp. 53–74&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liceo scientifico''' (literally ''scientific lyceum'') is a type of [[secondary school]] in [[Italy]]. It is designed to give students the skills to progress to any [[university]] or [[Higher education|higher educational institution]].&lt;ref name="dpr"&gt;Decreto del Presidente della Repubblica 89/2010 - ''Regolamento di revisione dei licei''. Available [http://www.indire.it/lucabas/lkmw_file/licei2010///Regolamento.pdf here]. Retrieved 14 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Students can attend the ''liceo scientifico'' after successfully completing [[middle school]] (''scuola media'').

The curriculum is devised by the [[Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy)|Ministry of Education]], and emphasises the link between the [[Humanities|humanistic tradition]] and [[Science|scientific culture]].&lt;ref name="dpr" /&gt; It covers a complete and widespread range of disciplines, including [[Italian language]] and [[Italian literature|literature]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[Latin language]] and [[Latin literature|culture]], [[English language]] and [[English culture|culture]], [[art history]] and [[technical drawing]].&lt;ref name="curr"&gt;Decreto del Presidente della Repubblica 89/2010, Appendix F - ''Regolamento di revisione dei licei, Allegato F''. Available [http://www.indire.it/lucabas/lkmw_file/licei2010///Quadri%20orari1.pdf here]. Retrieved 14 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Students typically study for five years, and attend the school from the age of 14 to 19. At the end of the fifth year all students sit for the ''esame di Stato'', a final examination which leads to the ''maturità scientifica''.

A student attending a ''liceo'' is called ''liceale'', although the more generic terms ''studente'' (male) and ''studentessa'' (female) are also in common use. Teachers are known as ''professore'' (male) or ''professoressa'' (female).

==History==
''Liceo scientifico'' was created with the [[Gentile reform]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Decreto Reale 1054/1923 - ''Ordinamento della istruzione media e dei convitti nazionali''. Available [http://www.edscuola.it/archivio/norme/decreti/rd1054_23.pdf here]. Retrieved 14 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, students attended the school for four years and the curriculum was derived from that of the ''ginnasio'', a humanity-centered type of secondary school similar to today's [[liceo classico]]. 

This meant that, despite its name, the ''liceo scientifico'' had more teaching hours dedicated to [[Latin language]] and [[Latin literature|literature]] than [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;Bollettino Ufficiale del Ministero dell’istruzione pubblica, 50, II, 17 Novembre 1923. Pages 4418, 4422 and 4423 available [http://www.subalpinamathesis.unito.it/storiains/it/tab4.pdf here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722063905/http://www.subalpinamathesis.unito.it/storiains/it/tab4.pdf |date=2011-07-22 }}. Retrieved 14 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, students that completed the school were not allowed to progress to university courses in the [[humanities]] or [[jurisprudence]], while students that completed the ''liceo classico'' were allowed to progress to any university course. These limitations drew several criticisms from the academic world.&lt;ref&gt;1924 report by the [[Accademia dei Lincei]]. Available [http://web.unife.it/progetti/matematicainsieme/riforma_gentile/pdf/Gentile04.pdf here]. Retrieved 14 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The curriculum and structure underwent several changes over the course of the following century. Most importantly, in 1969 the ban preventing students of the ''liceo scientifico'' from entering many university courses was finally lifted.&lt;ref&gt;Legge 910/1969 - ''Provvedimenti urgenti per l'Università''. Available [http://guide.supereva.it/diritto/interventi/2001/11/76483.shtml here]. Retrieved 16 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1991 and again later in 1995, school reforms introduced an alternative curriculum, ''[[Piano Nazionale di Informatica]]'' (PNI, literally ''National Plan of Computer Studies'').&lt;ref&gt;C.M. 6 febbraio 1991, n. 24 - ''Piano Nazionale per l'introduzione dell'Informatica nelle scuole secondarie superiori - Innovazione dei programmi di Matematica e Fisica nei bienni e nei trienni - Anno scolastico 1991-92''. Available [http://www.edscuola.it/archivio/norme/circolari/cm024_91.html here]. Retrieved 16 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.M. 27 settembre 1996, n. 615 - ''Piano Nazionale per l'introduzione dell'informatica nelle scuole secondarie superiori. Indicazioni programmatiche relative all'insegnamento della matematica nel triennio del liceo ginnasio e del liceo scientifico e nel secondo biennio dell'istituto magistrale''. Available [http://www.edscuola.it/archivio/norme/circolari/cm615_96.html here]. Retrieved 16 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The new curriculum differed from the old one not only by including [[computer programming]], but also in having more teaching hours dedicated to mathematics and physics.  This new curriculum was optional for schools to implement. Other alternative curricula were also made available for schools to choose from, such as a bilingual curriculum introducing the teaching of a second language in addition to English.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. 8 giugno 1992, n. 198 - ''Sperimentazioni parziali di lingue straniere nei licei e negli istituti magistrali''. Available [http://www.edscuola.it/archivio/norme/circolari/cm198_92.html here]. Retrieved 16 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest major reform, in 2008, eliminated all previous alternative curricula.&lt;ref&gt;Legge 30 ottobre 2008, n. 169 - ''Disposizioni urgenti in materia di istruzione e università''. Available [http://www.edscuola.it/archivio/norme/leggi/dl28808.pdf here]. Retrieved 16 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It significantly increased the teaching hours dedicated to scientific subjects and decreased those dedicated to Latin. In addition to the standard curriculum, it also created the alternative curriculum ''opzione scienze applicate'' (''applied sciences option'') which involves more teaching and laboratory hours for the sciences and does not include Latin.

==Final exam==

The final exam is officially called ''esame di Stato'', although the old name ''esame di maturità'' is still in common use. 
It is composed of three written and one oral part:&lt;ref name="esame"&gt;Legge 1/2007 - ''Disposizioni in materia di esami di Stato conclusivi dei corsi di studio di istruzione secondaria superiore e delega al Governo in materia di raccordo tra la scuola e le università''. Available [http://www.parlamento.it/parlam/leggi/07001l.htm here]. Retrieved 18 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''prima prova'' (''first test''), an [[Italian language]] written test which aims to test the candidate's expressive ability and critical thinking
* ''seconda prova'' (''second test''), a written test on mathematics or physics
* ''terza prova'' (''third test''), a multidisciplinary written test on four of the remaining subjects
* a multidisciplinary oral exam in which the candidate is tested on all the subjects studied in the final year

Students are examined by an exam committee which is formed in equal parts by their own teachers and teachers coming from other schools. The first and second tests are written by the Ministry of Education, while the third test and the oral exam are prepared and administered by the exam committee.&lt;ref name="esame" /&gt;

The final grade is given as a number out of 100, and is the sum of the points obtained by students in the final exam and the credits they accumulated over the previous years.

The '''Maharashtra State Board of Technical Education (MSBTE)''' is an autonomous board of education in the state of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. It designs and implements [[diploma]], post diploma and advanced diploma programs to affiliated institutions. The board was established in 1963 to cater the increasing needs of affiliated institutions and their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maharashtra State Board of Technical Education|title=About MSBTE|url=http://www.msbte.com/msbte_html/index.php?act=about_msbte|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The establishment of a separate board responsible for higher education dates back to 1963. Before the country's independence for [[British Raj]], diploma courses in [[Engineering]] and [[Technology]] were provided institutions like the [[College of Engineering, Pune]], [[Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute]], Mumbai, [[Cusrow Wadia Institute of Technology]], Pune and [[Government Polytechnic, Nagpur]]. A Directorate of Technical Education was set up in 1948 to control technical education in all levels. As industrial development increased, the demand for diploma courses also did, and the government established a separate Board of Technical Examinations in August 1963. It was later renamed to Maharashtra State Board of Technical Education and given an autonomous status in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Directorate of Technical Education, Maharashtra State|title=Present Status of Technical Education|url=http://www.dtemaharashtra.gov.in/approvedinstitues/CMS/Content_Static.aspx?did=40|publisher=Directorate of Technical Education, Maharashtra State|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MSBTE conduct Summer and Winter Exams every six months.   The Summer exams are held during April/May Month and Winter exams are held during November/December month.

==Affiliated Institutes==
All polytechnic institutes in the maharashtra are affiliated to MSBTE, out of which 43 are [[List of Government Polytechnic Colleges in Maharashtra|Government Polytechnic]] institutes.
A total of 25 institutes are affiliated to the board for the academic year 2013-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MSBTE|title=Institute Search For Year 2013|url=http://msbte.com/msbte13/index.php?act=search_inst&amp;sub=2013|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mahe v Alberta''''', [1990] 1 S.C.R. 342 is a [[Lists of landmark court decisions|leading decision]] of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. The ruling is notable because the court established that [[Section Twenty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 23]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' requires that parents of the [[minority language|official-language minority]] in each province have the right either to be represented on the school board, or to have a school board of their own, in order to provide adequate protection for the [[education in Canada|education]] rights of their children.

==Background==
Three [[Edmonton]] citizens, Jean-Claude Mahe, Angeline Martel and Paul Dubé, were dissatisfied with the quality of the [[French language]] schools provided by the [[Alberta]] government. In 1982 they submitted a proposal to the Minister of Education for a new French [[elementary school]] that would be administered by a committee of parents within an autonomous French [[school board]].

The Minister of Education told them that it was not in their policy to make such arrangements and so they suggested they try to do it through the public school board. The board rejected them. Mahé and the others brought an action against the government of Alberta for violating their right to a Francophone-run education system under section 23 of the ''Charter''.

The questions before the Supreme Court were:
# Have the rights of the Francophone population of Edmonton under section 23(2)(b) of the ''Charter'' been violated?
# Do the rights under section 23 include the right to manage and control the schools? If so, what is the nature and extent of the management and control?
# Does the provincial School Act violate section 23? If so, can it be saved under [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]] of the ''Charter''?
# Are the rights affected by section 93 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], [[Section Twenty-nine of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 29]] of the ''Charter'', and section 17 of the [[Alberta Act]]?

==Opinion of the Court==
The Court held that section 23 guarantees representation on the school board, and exclusive control over the children's education with respect to culture; or it can guarantee a separate school board. However, there must be sufficient minority language population to warrant either level of protection. In this particular case, the Court decided representation on an existing school board would be sufficient, and held that this did not interfere with denominational school rights under section 29 of the ''Charter'' since it merely affected language.

The Court's unanimous decision was given by Chief Justice [[Brian Dickson]] He began by examining the purpose of section 23 which is to "preserve and promote the two [[official language]]s of Canada, and their respective cultures". The section was intended to be remedial so as to prevent the loss of a minority group's language and cultural identity and so must be interpreted in light of [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 15]] and [[Section Twenty-seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|27]] of the ''Charter''.

'''Marathon Reading''' is a yearly program put on by the [[UCLA]] department of [[English studies|English]], where a group of students, faculty, community members, [[alumni]], and often even [[celebrity|celebrities]] read a novel (or two) out loud non-stop for a 24-hour period.

Texas Tech University also hosts an annual marathon reading, coordinated by Dr. Rich Rice, Assistant Professor of English. Other higher-learning institutions that put on annual marathon readings include James Madison College at Michigan State University, Cleveland State University, Grand Valley State University, and Ball State University, Dr. Rice's doctoral alma mater.

The [[New Bedford Whaling Museum]] in Massachusetts hosts an annual nonstop reading aloud of [[Moby-Dick]], the novel by [[Herman Melville]]. Held each January since 1995, the event marks the anniversary of Melville’s 1841 departure from the Port of New Bedford and Fairhaven aboard the whale ship Acushnet. Hundreds attend the approximately 25-hour multimedia event, which is [[live-streamed]] on the Internet.

The '''Mosenson Youth Village''' is a [[youth village]] in [[Hod HaSharon]], [[Israel]]. The youth village was named after Ben Zion Mossensohn, a teacher, public figure and one of the founders of [[Tel Aviv]].

== History ==
Mosinzon school was established as a school for [[agriculture]], and was part of a network of schools of the Zionist Youth Movement. Its goal was to teach the young immigrants (''olim'') arriving from the diaspora, along with Israeli youth from around the country, for life of labor, creativity and self-fulfillment, in science, technology, arts and sports. To this end, a boarding school was established, and exists until these days, as part of the youth village.

By the end of World War II, the youth village received young Holocaust survivors who immigrated to Israel. In 1943 the first class of the survivors graduated.

Comprehensive studies started in 1967 in collaboration with the local municipality of Hod-Hasharon.

== Academics ==
Currently the youth village consists of a high-school and a boarding school. The school hosts the children of the local communities, and offers technological and comprehensive studies. Its present principal is Nurit Cohen.

The school was awarded by the [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Ministry of Education]] best absorption of new education workers in 2015-16. In addition, it received the Education Award for cultural collaboration from the Teachers' Association.

The boarding school admits students from all around Israel as well as students from abroad. It is considered to be one of the leading boarding schools in Israel, and recently has received Best Boarding School Education Award.

Mosenson high school offers a variety of unique classes, including sports – such as dancing, swimming, basketball, football and personal sports. It also offers classes of biomedicine, electronics, film, ''Nachshon Program'' and general studies.

Students of the [[Naale program]], from North America, Europe, South Africa, and other countries study at the youth village, where there is also a special program for students who do not speak Hebrew, to enable them to become part of the Israeli society.

The '''National Commission on Excellence in Education''' produced the 1983 report titled [[A Nation at Risk]]. It was chaired by [[David P. Gardner]] and included prominent members such as Nobel prize-winning chemist [[Glenn T. Seaborg]].

It produced a short summary of its findings called '''The United States System of Education''' in which it gives a short history of education since colonial days and, after a Preface, gives an overall view on control and financing of education, organization and structure, statistical data and conclusions. 

== Background ==
In 1983, the New York Times published an article that cited a passage from the “Pursuit of Excellence: Education and the Future of America” by the Rockefeller Brothers’ Fund’s panel, “America at Mid-Century.” At that time, the “Pursuit of Excellence” was the slogan of American politicians. {{what|date=November 2018}} {{who|date=November 2018}} {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} In the same way, Excellence was a popular axiom after the landmark report entitled, “Nation at Risk” by the National Commission on Excellence in Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/19/science/about-education-a-call-from-the-past-for-excellence.html|title=ABOUT EDUCATION; A CALL FROM THE PAST FOR EXCELLENCE|last=Hechinger|first=Fred M.|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The article emphasized among several points the observation that teachers are frequently regarded as identical units of a factory assembly line in the education sector. Mentors regardless of competence teach the same subjects in the same grade, use one kind of textbook, deal with the same number of pupils, and receive equal salaries. This trend has not changed since 1958. The late John W. Gardner who used to be Education Secretary of former President Lyndon Johnson and afterwards Chairman of the Commission insisted that students with academic proficiency should take an additional three years each of mathematics, science, and one foreign language which did not happen. 

The 36-page Nation at Risk Report criticized the state of schools in the United States and clamored for numerous reforms to rectify supposed flaws in the country’s public education system at that time. The commentary described education in America as mediocre. There were few indications of assurance because of test scores that were declining at a rapid pace, low salaries of teachers, and substandard training programs for educators. The turnover rate of teachers became alarmingly high. Statistics showed that some 23 million American grownups did not have sufficient reading and writing skills. This report gained plenty of attention from media. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://neatoday.org/2013/04/25/a-nation-at-risk-turns-30-where-did-it-take-us-2/|title='A Nation at Risk' Turns 30: Where Did It Take Us? - NEA Today|date=2013-04-25|work=NEA Today|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Országos Széchényi Könyvtár 1.jpg|300px|thumb|National Széchényi Library]]
The '''National Széchényi Library''' ({{lang-hu|'''Országos Széchényi Könyvtár'''}}) ('''OSZK''') is a  library in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. It is one of two Hungarian national libraries, the other being [[University of Debrecen Library]].

==History==
The library was founded in 1802 by the highly patriotic Hungarian aristocrat [[Count Ferenc Széchényi]].  Széchényi traveled the world buying Hungarian books, which he assembled and donated to the nation. In the following year the public library was opened in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]]. Széchényi's example resulted in a nationwide movement of book donations to the library.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oszk.hu/en/history_of_the_library|title=History of the Library|last=|first=|date=|website=National Széchényi Library|publisher=|access-date=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1808, the [[Hungarian National Assembly]] ("[[diet (assembly)|Diet]]") created the [[Hungarian National Museum]] to collect the historical, archaeological and natural relics of Hungary. The Museum was merged into the Library and for the last 200 years this is how it has existed, a national depository for written, printed and objective relics of the Hungarian past.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1846, the Hungarian National Museum moved into its new building but it was not until 1949 that the Library became a separate entity again, with its current name. In 1985, the library moved to its new home at the [[Buda Castle|Buda Castle Palace]]. The NSZL works on its catalogue's semantic availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nektar.oszk.hu/wiki/Semantic_web|title=Semantic web - NektarWiki|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of New Mozart Autograph==
In 2014, a Hungarian librarian discovered four pages of Mozart's original score (autograph) of the sonata in Budapest's National Széchényi Library. Until then, only the last page of the autograph survived.{{efn-ua|The original score is close to the first edition, published in 1784.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kozinn|first1=Allan|authorlink=Allan Kozinn|title=A Mozart Mystery: Sonata Manuscript Surfaces in Budapest|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/a-mozart-mystery-sonata-manuscript-surfaces-in-budapest/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=1 October 2014|page=C4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the first movement, in bars 5 and 6 of Variation V, the rhythm of the final eight note of the bar was altered by various editions throughout time. In the menuetto, the last quarter beat of bar 3 is a C-sharp in most editions, but in the autograph an A is printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mozart.oszk.hu/index_en.html#significance|title=K. 331 Sonata in A major|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The paper and handwriting of the four pages matched that of the final page of the score, held in Salzburg.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25693">The '''Princess Grace Foundation-USA''' is a national foundation in the United States which is dedicated to identifying and assisting emerging talent in [[theater]], dance, and film by awarding grants in the form of scholarships, apprenticeships, and fellowships. 

It was named after [[Grace Kelly]], Princess of Monaco. The Foundation has awarded over $8 million to nearly 500 theater, dance, and film artists nationwide. It continues to fund its inaugural disciplines and has expanded its grants program to include playwriting and choreography grants within the theater and dance categories. 

==History==
[[Prince Rainier of Monaco]] established the program to keep helping emerging artists realize their career goals as Princess Grace did during her lifetime. Prince Rainier's children continue to assist in the program in its 28th year. Notable supporters of the Foundation during its inception include [[Gant Gaither]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Cary Grant]], [[John H. Johnson|John Johnson]], [[William P. Rogers]], [[Mary Wells Lawrence]], and [[Lynn Wyatt]].

In 1982, the Board of Trustees, under Robert Hausman, incorporated Princess Grace Foundation-USA as a not-for-profit public charity. In 1984, after the initial fund raising phase was complete, financial grants in the form of scholarships, apprenticeships, and fellowships were awarded to artists associated with schools or companies in the dance and theater disciplines. An arts advisory board composed of distinguished professionals in each of those fields was appointed to choose the most talented applicants as Awards recipients. President Reagan and his wife oversaw the first gala in Washington, D.C.; a tradition now continued annually in the Awards Gala in New York City.

In 2008, the AAB formed a partnership with [[Baryshnikov Arts Center]] (BAC) to provide further support for Princess Grace Awards winners. The Works in Progress Residency provides a cash award of around $25,000 and residence at the Baryshnikov Arts Center, in support of the multimedia and interdisciplinary artistic pursuits of Princess Grace Awards winners. The Residency enables these artists to explore, experiment, and push the boundaries of their work in an environment that focuses on process over product. In 2010, three artists received BAC Residencies: two in Theater and one in Dance.

In 2009, the AAB formed a partnership with [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company]] to provide further support for its Theater Awards winners. The goal of this alliance is to provide a Princess Grace Theater Awards winner with an opportunity to learn from a more established Awards winner by serving as a Co-Assistant Director on a production scheduled as a part of the Steppenwolf season. The partnership has paired [[Alex Torra]] with [[Anna D. Shapiro]] on a production of UP! in 2009 and plans to pair another director with Tina Landau on a production of Hot L Baltimore in 2011.

Currently, [[John F. Lehman, Jr.]] is at the helm, [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco]], serves as Vice-Chairman, and Toby Boshak, who has been with the Foundation for fourteen years, is the Executive Director. 

==The Princess Grace Statue Award==
Past winners of the Awards who distinguish themselves in their artistic disciplines since receiving their initial Princess Grace Awards are eligible to win the Foundation’s highest honor, the Princess Grace Statue Award. In addition to a $25,000 unrestricted cash gift, these awardees are presented with a bronze statuette of Princess Grace created by the Dutch artist [[Kees Verkade]]. To date, fifty-one artists have received this award.

==The Prince Rainier III Award==
In 2005, the board of trustees inaugurated the [[Prince Rainier]] III Award, in honor of the man who helped begin the Foundation. This Award is presented to eminent artists who have not only been highly successful in their careers, but have made significant humanitarian contributions to their fields. To date, [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] (2005), [[Twyla Tharp]] (2006), [[George Lucas]] (2007), [[Glenn Close]] (2008), [[Mandy Patinkin]] (2009), [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Pauletta Washington]] (2010) and [[Julie Andrews]] (2011) Dick Van Dyke (2014) Robert Redford and Sibylle Redford (2015) have received this honor, which includes a grant to the philanthropic organization of their choice.

'''Professor Watchlist''' is a website run by [[Turning Point USA]] that lists U.S. professors deemed to "discriminate against conservative students, promote anti-American values and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/22/new-website-seeks-register-professors-accused-liberal-bias-and-anti-american-values |title=Being Watched |last=Flaherty |first=Colleen |website=[[Inside Higher Education]] |publication-date=2016-11-22|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/professor-watchlist-website-left-wing-propaganda-2016-12 |title=A conservative website is targeting professors and accusing them of spreading 'left-wing propaganda' |last=Sidahmed |first=Mazin |website=[[Business Insider]] |publication-date=December 2, 2016|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2016, the website included about 200 professors.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

The list's claims about the people it includes have been contested as misleading or inaccurate, and its existence has been criticized as a threat to [[academic freedom]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/02/professor-watchlist-website-academic |title=Professor Watchlist website elicits both fear and ridicule in US universities |last=Sidahmed |first=Mazin |website=The Guardian |publication-date=December 2, 2016|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4588165/professor-watchlist-silence-conservative/|title=Professors Targeted by Conservative Watchlist Fire Back: 'It's Obviously an Attempt to Silence People'|last=Reilly|first=Katie|date=|website=Time|publication-date=2016-12-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
[[Campus Reform]], a part of the [[Leadership Institute]], and [[Discover the Networks]], a website run by the [[David Horowitz Freedom Center]], were the sources for most of the professors on the Professor Watchlist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/What-It-s-Like-to-Be-Named/238486|title=What It’s Like to Be Named to a Watch List of ‘Anti-American’ Professors|first=Katherine|last=Knott|date=November 23, 2016|publisher=|access-date=July 13, 2017|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' columnist Rebecca Schuman described the website as "abjectly terrifying" and said that she feared for the safety of the listed professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/education/2016/11/professor_watchlist_is_a_grotesque_catalog_of_left_leaning_academics.html |title=Oh Good, a "Professor Watch List" |last=Schuman |first=Rebecca |website=Slate |publication-date=November 23, 2016|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have criticized the website as a threat to academic freedom; Hans-Joerg Tiede, the associate secretary for the [[American Association of University Professors]]' department of academic freedom, tenure and governance, told [[The New York Times|''The'' ''New York Times'']]: "There is a continuing cycle of these sorts of things. They serve the same purpose: to intimidate individuals from speaking plainly in their classrooms or in their publications."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/us/professor-watchlist-is-seen-as-threat-to-academic-freedom.html?_r=0 |title=Professor Watchlist Is Seen as Threat to Academic Freedom |last=Mele |first=Christopher |website=The New York Times |publication-date=2016-11-28|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics including [[Peter Dreier]] of [[Occidental College]]—who is listed on the site for having criticized the [[National Rifle Association]] and using [[Howard Zinn]]'s ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'' as a required text—have pointed out errors of fact that may make Professor Watchlist less than reliable as a source of information. Dreier's entry in the website lists him as a former employee of the [[Industrial Areas Foundation]] and as the man who inspired college student [[Barack Obama]] to become a community organizer. Dreier identifies these claims about him as "complete fantasy". He also noted elements of his biography that the website completely omitted, such as his work with [[Trade union|labor unions]], his activism in favor of a [[minimum wage]], and the books which he has authored. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dreier|first1=Peter|title=Professor Peter Dreier, targeted by Professor Watchlist, says it gets an F for accuracy|url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/164618|access-date=December 14, 2016|publisher=History News Network|date=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kent State University|Kent State]] professor [[Julio Cesar Pino|Julio Pino]] told ''The New York Times'' the site is "a kind of normalizing of prosecuting professors, shaming professors, defaming professors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20161130/news/161139969/|title=Wheeling High graduate behind conservative 'Professor Watchlist''|first=Kerry|last=Lester|date=30 November 2016|website=dailyherald.com|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website's organizers have responded by claiming that it simply provides conservative students with a guide to their professors, akin to [[Ratemyprofessors.com]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2016/12/02/professor-watchlist/#o7M6W32.5SqE |title=This controversial website is targeting 'radical' left-wing academics |last=Wenzke |first=Marissa |website=Mashable |publication-date=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabling them to avoid left-wing classes.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

Over one hundred [[University of Notre Dame]] faculty members signed an open letter asking to be included in the site, saying in part:&lt;ref name="NDSMCObserver"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndsmcobserver.com/2016/12/letter-professor-watchlist/|title=A letter to Professor Watchlist|date=December 8, 2016|work=The Observer|access-date=January 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|We surmise that the purpose of your list is to shame and silence faculty who espouse ideas you reject. But your list has had a different effect upon us. We are coming forward to stand with the professors you have called "dangerous," reaffirming our values and recommitting ourselves to the work of teaching students to think clearly, independently and fearlessly.}}

In response to the Notre Dame letter, [[University of Chicago]] psychology professor Leslie Kay started the website "Free Academics". This website lists the names of professors across the United States who have signed it to ask for their names to be added to the list. As of December 2016, it had over 1,500 signatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/12/14/the-sort-of-company-we-wish-to-keep-more-than-1500-academics-ask-to-join-controversial-professor-watchlist/|title='The sort of company we wish to keep': More than 1,500 academics ask to join controversial 'Professor Watchlist'|last=Strauss|first=Valerie|date=|website=[[The Washington Post]]|publication-date=December 14, 2016|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2218">'''Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills (QTLS) status''' is a designation awarded to teachers in the [[Further Education]] and Post-Compulsory Education &amp; Training sectors by the Education &amp; Training Foundation (ETF) in the [[United Kingdom]].

Since 1 April 2012, teachers with Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills (QTLS) status have also been recognised as qualified to teach in schools.

Holders of QTLS who are members of the Society for Education &amp; Training (SET) may be appointed to permanent positions as qualified teachers, without any further induction requirements.

QTLS is therefore recognised as equivalent to [[Qualified Teacher Status|QTS]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts#qualified-teacher-learning-and-skills-qtls&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Gaining and Maintaining QTLS==

From November 2014, QTLS has been offered by the Education &amp; Training Foundation (ETF) to members of the Society for Education &amp; Training (SET) for a fee of £485.  In order to obtain QTLS, the candidate is required to register with SET, undertake annual [[Continuing Professional Development]] (CPD) and complete SET's 'Professional Formation' process.  

Prior to November 2014, QTLS was offered by the [[Institute for Learning]] (IfL) which was absorbed into the Education &amp; Training Foundation (ETF) on 31 October 2014.

QTLS is equivalent to [[Qualified Teacher Status|QTS]].  Should an individual want to teach in maintained schools, the same way as any other teacher, then they must hold QTLS, currently be, and remain a member of the Society for Education &amp; Training (SET).

The [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education|PGCE]] in Post-Compulsory Education &amp; Training and the [[Diploma in Education and Training]] (including its predecessors, e.g. [[DTLLS]]) are the qualifications which qualify a teacher to attain QTLS.

{{for|other uses of Rōnin or Ronin|Ronin (disambiguation)}}
In [[Japan]], a {{nihongo|'''''rōnin'''''|浪人||ろうにん}} is a student who has graduated from middle school or high school but has failed to enter a school at the next level, and consequently is studying outside of the school system for entrance in a future year.&lt;ref&gt;Akihiko Yonekawa. Beyond Polite Japanese. page 25. [[Kodansha]] 2001. {{ISBN|4-7700-2773-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;浪人 at Japanese-English dictionaries: [http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&amp;p=浪人&amp;dtype=3&amp;dname=2na プログレッシブ和英中辞典] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130218175532/dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&amp;p=浪人&amp;dtype=3&amp;dname=2na |date=2013-02-18 }} or [http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&amp;p=浪人&amp;dtype=3&amp;dname=2ss ニューセンチュリー和英辞典] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130219003708/dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&amp;p=浪人&amp;dtype=3&amp;dname=2ss |date=2013-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rōnin'' may study at a  ''[[yobikō]]''.

==Etymology==
The term ''rōnin'' is [[colloquial]]; the word {{nihongo|''kanendosei''|過年度生}} is more formal. The term derives from their having no school to attend, as a ''[[rōnin]]'', a masterless samurai, had no leader to serve.

Sometimes, the term 二浪 (short form) or 二年浪人 (full form, 二年 - second year) is used for student who failed exams twice.

==In popular culture==
''Rōnin'' appear frequently in fiction and [[Japanese popular culture]]. As an example, the [[manga]] and [[anime]] series ''[[Love Hina]]'' features three main characters, [[Keitaro Urashima]], [[Naru Narusegawa]], and [[Mutsumi Otohime]], who are described as ''rōnin'' throughout most of the series. In the manga and anime series ''[[Chobits]]'', the protagonist, Hideki Motosuwa, is a ''rōnin'' studying at a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] to get into college. ''[[Maison Ikkoku]]'' also features a ''rōnin'' as its main character; the series centers around his studying for exams as he is distracted by others that he lives with.
The protagonist of ''[[Sekirei]]'', Minato Sahashi, is also a ''rōnin''. ''[[Kanamemo]]'''s Hinata Azuma is a roninsei as well due to her love of gambling and money making, activities which hinder her studies.

'''Speech Buddies''' are a series of [[speech therapy]] tools that are used to remediate articulation and [[speech sound disorder]]s using the widely accepted teaching method of [[tactile feedback]]. Articulation, or speech sound disorders occur when a person has difficulty producing a sound correctly. Sounds may be left off, substituted, added or changed, making it difficult to be understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/speechsounddisorders.htm |title=Speech Sound Disorders: Articulation and Phonological Processes |publisher=Asha.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often occurring when children are learning to speak, these errors are considered a disorder if they persist after a certain [[developmental age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingchild.com/speechchart.html |title=What sounds should my child be saying? |publisher=Talkingchild.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A developmental age at which a child should be able to correctly produce a certain sound is different depending on the difficulty of the sound. The B-sound is one of the first mastered, while the R-sound is more difficult and may not be mastered until several years later.  Most articulation disorders are of no known cause, though many can be attributed to other disorders such as [[autism]], or [[hearing impairment]].

Speech Buddies help treat articulation disorders. There are five different Speech Buddies, each one addressing an individual sound: R, S, L, CH or SH. These tools teach correct [[tongue]] placement when trying to produce problem sounds. This type of learning is called tactile feedback, which uses the sense of touch to promote learning.

Preliminary research results from a single blind [[randomized controlled trial]] suggest that they may increase the speed in which a child can learn to correct his speech sound disorder.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.speech-buddies.com/assets/files/White%20Paper%20SB%20Clincal%20Trial-8-20-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing research is exploring the use of Speech Buddies to help in other speech therapy applications including foreign [[accent reduction]], [[developmental verbal dyspraxia]], acquired [[apraxia of speech]] from [[stroke]] or [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI).  Experts have published clinical experiences using Speech Buddies for articulation disorders and apraxia in industry blogs such as Play on Words, Mommy Speech Therapy and traditional publications such as the [[Chicago Tribune]]. On May 31, 2011, Dr. Max Gomez of WCBS-NY reported on how Speech Buddies are being used to reduce overall cost and treatment time of speech therapy.

Speech Buddies were invented by Articulate Technologies, Inc., in [[San Francisco]], CA. Speech Buddies® and Speech Buddy™ are [[trademark]]s of Articulate Technologies, Inc. They are [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] listed [[medical device]]s.

[[File:Japanese-Teacher's-Room.jpg|thumb|right|A teachers' lounge in Japan]]
A '''staffroom''', also known as a '''teachers' lounge''' outside Great Britain, is a room in a [[primary school]], [[middle school]], [[high school]] or [[college]] where teachers have their desk and prepare their lessons, as opposed to the '''faculty lounge''' in [[United States]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] [[universities]] and to the '''common room''' in [[United Kingdom|British independent schools]], where the [[teacher]]s and/or school [[Employment|staff]] talk to each other, discuss work, eat, drink and socialise while not in class. In [[primary school]], there is usually just one common room, while in [[middle school]], [[high school]], [[college]] and/or [[university]], there can be multiple common rooms.  Faculty lounges and common rooms may have kitchens, desks, and [[Television|television sets.]]

The term is not used to refer to a general kitchen area, for example in an office.{{speculation inline|}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2109">'''The Cortège''' ({{lang-sv|Cortègen}}), or '''The Chalmers Cortège''' (Swedish: ''Chalmerscortègen'') is an annual [[carnival|carnival parade]] held on [[Walpurgis Night]] (30 April) by students of the [[Chalmers University of Technology]] in [[Gothenburg]]. The Cortège consists of around 600 students and around 50 [[truck]] [[carriage]]s, each carriage depicting&amp;mdash;in a satirical and comic way&amp;mdash;significant events that have taken place since the previous parade. The procession makes its way through the city centre, where it is seen by around 250,000 people each year.

In 1909, the students decided to gather all the [[carriage|horse carriage]]s in the city to travel the distance they usually walked. The next year, the [[Chalmers Students' Union]] decided to organize a parade of student culture jokes. In the year 1911 a [[committee]], ''Chalmers Cortège Committé'' (CCC), was created to organize the whole procession. Ever since, except for 1912 due to exam scheduling conflicts, as well as 1940 due to [[World War II]], CCC has arranged The Cortège.

'''The Student School''',  stylised THESTUDENTSCHOOL, is an [[alternative school|alternative high school]] in the [[Toronto District School Board]] founded in 1979. It has approximately 160 students and generally offers 11th and 12th grade academic courses. It is in the same building as [[Western Technical-Commercial School]] and [[Ursula Franklin Academy]].

The school is based loosely on the principles of [[participatory democracy]]. It allows students to vote on significant school policies and actions taken on by the school community in bi-weekly general assemblies. Notably, students and teachers alike receive one vote. Furthermore, students are encouraged to take an active role in community and global politics through various committees and organizations present at school.

It is well known for its support of social justice causes and boycotts. For example, it has a yearly auction that works as a fundraiser for women living in shelters over the holiday season. Also it is home to a community-run garden, a kitchen collective that provides subsidized lunches and free breakfasts to students, and a number of student-run associations.

The school has a number of unique course offerings that correspond to various standard course codes recognized by the [[Toronto District School Board]], for example, "a history of imperialism and protest," "women and gender studies," or "alternative economic models."

The school also has a unique [[absenteeism|absence]] system, where students are not penalized for absences until the fifteenth one, at which point they must appeal to a teacher council in order to receive [[course credit]].

Much like several other alternative schools, teachers are on a first name basis with students.

Established in 1971, the '''Waldorf School of Lexington''' in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]] is a co-ed pre-K through grade 8 independent school. As of September 2015, the school serves over 230 students with 50 full- and part-time faculty and staff members.

The Waldorf School is accredited by the [[Association of Waldorf Schools of North America]] and the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]]. It is also a member of the [[Association of Independent Schools of New England]].

==History==
(Source: [https://web.archive.org/web/20060521195804/http://www.thewaldorfschool.org/home/content.asp?id=720 Waldorf School of Lexington: History of Our School])

Guided by the [[Waldorf Education|educational philosophy]] of [[Rudolf Steiner]], the Waldorf School opened in 1971 as a kindergarten and day care center with a handful of children in a Cambridge church basement. In its third year, the school's three faculty members decided to apply for membership in the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA). For six years the school was sponsored by the Waldorf School of Garden City, NY. By the end of the decade, the school had expanded to sixth grade and had become a full member of AWSNA.

[[Image:Adams School, Lexington MA.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;The Adams School building]]&lt;/center&gt;
In 1980, the school rented the historic Adams School building in Lexington to accommodate the growing number of students. From 1981 to 1984, enrollment increased significantly and the school purchased the Adams building from the town of Lexington in 1983. In 1982, the first eighth grade graduated.

In 1990, a formal Waldorf Parent-Teacher Association was formed, and in 1991 the Board of Trustees elected a parent as its first non-faculty president. During this year, the school was accepted into the Association of Independent Schools of New England (AISNE).

During the 1995-96 school year, the faculty and Board developed a new long-range plan. It established a goal of founding a high school, while keeping the elementary strong. The high school started out in the basement of the Follen Church at 755 Massachusetts Avenue, with ten students in ninth grade.

In 1998, the school successfully conducted a capital campaign to purchase the historic building adjacent to the existing site. Beginning in October, the building at 703 Massachusetts Avenue was gutted and renovated to house up to 56 students on three floors. The High School moved into its new quarters in the spring of 1999, and in June 2000, the first twelfth grade graduated.

In 2002, the school was evaluated by a team from AWSNA and NEASC (New England Association of Schools and Colleges.) The school received accreditation from both organizations.

In 2003, it was decided that the high school would become a separate entity. The high school formed its own board of trustees and is now the [http://www.waldorfhighschool.org Waldorf High School of Massachusetts Bay]. The high school moved to Belmont, MA, in July 2004 to accommodate its growing enrollment.

The school's second building at 703 Massachusetts Avenue, which dates to 1828 and is the oldest brick structure in Lexington, was renovated in 2005 to house the expanded nursery and after-school programs.

As of 2016, the school offers programs for children from birth through eighth grade, including:
- a range of parent-child programs for children from 0–3 years
- play-based nursery and kindergarten
- an arts-integrated academic program for grades 1–8, including 2 foreign languages
- after-school athletics
- after-school programs
- summer camp
- summer storytime

'''Transactional distance''' theory was developed in the 1970s by [[Dr. Michael G. Moore]], Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Education at the [[Pennsylvania State University]] (Moore, 1980). It is the first [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] theory specifically derived from analysis of teaching and learning conducted through [[technology]] as opposed to the many theories developed in the classroom. It is considered by some to be one of the few, if not the only, theory in [[distance education]] that can be used to test hypotheses. It can be used to frame experiments in tutoring or other learner support activities to assess what change there is in the outcomes of student learning, often judged by student completion (Tait, 2017).  Like any theory, the transactional distance model serves as a [[heuristic]] device, a means of identifying questions for research and also a very practical instrument to be used in making these difficult instructional design decisions.

==Description==
The theory consists of a set of principles and a model that defines the pedagogical aspects of education (as contrasted with others such as management and policy) in three sets of variables. The first set consists of elements describing the structure of what is designed to be learned, the second in the interaction or dialog between teacher and learners when that structured program is implemented, and the third is the idiosyncrasies of each individual learner with priority given to the potential self-management or autonomy of the students who interact with teachers within the designed structure (Moore &amp; Kearsley, 2012).
 
Transactional distance theory states that when an instructional designer makes decisions, these decisions will result in a certain amount of structure, dialog and autonomy. These amounts can be either unwitting consequences of the instructional design process, or the result of conscious instructional design decisions. Regardless, these variables interact to create transactional distance which Michael G. Moore defines as “a psychological and communication space to be crossed, a space of potential misunderstanding between the inputs of instructor and those of the learner.” Thus, the utility of the theory is that it provides guidance to instructional designers as to how to design the course: e.g. how much structure, dialog, and autonomy to build into the course, so as to minimize transactional distances and thereby maximize learning outcomes.

==Measuring transactional distance==

A number of researchers have used Moore’s theory as the theoretical underpinning for the development of a number of statistically valid and reliable scales to measure transactional distances. Some of these are listed below together with a brief description.

''Zhang’s Scale of Transactional Distance (2003):'' By the turn of the millennium, distance education had evolved from being synonymous with correspondence courses to being largely web-based. Aixu (Monica) Zhang built on Michael G. Moore’s theory by proposing that transactional distance could be viewed as a measure of the student’s difficulty in becoming actively engaged with their online learning environment. She defined transactional distance by four sets of variables (the Transactional Distance between Students and Students (TDSS), the Transactional Distance between Students and the Teacher (TDST), the Transactional Distance between the Student and the Content (TDSC), and the Transactional Distance between the Student and the Instructional Technology (TDSI). She found that these four sets of variables were highly and statistically correlated with Student Satisfaction, which she adopted as her surrogate measure for Transactional Distance. Her work lead to a 31 element statistically reliable and significant Scale of Transactional Distance.

''Relative Proximity Theory (Swart et al., 2013):'' Zhang’s Scale of Transactional Distance provides a numerical measure for transactional distance based on a five point [[Likert scale|Likert Scale]]. Such a measure assumes meaning only when compared to another similar measure such as, for example, in a statistical pre –post intervention comparison. Many studies do not lend themselves to pre-post intervention comparisons. Relative Proximity Theory borrows from gap, or needs analysis (Kaufman &amp; Guerra, 2013) to yield the transactional distance between an actual and desired state. For example, the transactional distance between an actual class and an ideal class.

''Revised Scale of Transactional Distance (Paul et al., 2015):'' There are many changes in the educational environment that have occurred since Zhang developed her Scale of Transactional Distance: Online education is the fastest growing segment of higher education, mobile computing has become ubiquitous, MOOC’s provide an unprecedented amount of online content to learners and instructors alike. Zhang’s model was re-evaluated in light of these changes. The results provided a 12 element parsimonious version of Zhang’s scale which has excellent factorial validity and reliability, yields better fit statistics, and is easier and less time consuming to apply than the original scale.

''Coll-TD Scale (Wengrowicz et al., 2014):'' This scale builds on Michael G. Moore’s Theory of Transactional Distance to measure the transactional distances of students who are conducting research in virtual group collaborative environments. It defines Transactional Distance as composed of six sets of variables (Communication between Peers, Understanding between Peers, Communication between Peers and Instructor, Understanding between Peers and Instructor, Prior Attitude toward Collaboration, and Satisfaction). This yielded a 40 element statistically reliable and valid instrument.

''Coll-TD/F Scale (Swart et al., 2015):'' This instrument extends the Coll-TD Scale to Flipped Classrooms where collaboration takes place both f2f, during interactive group learning sessions, and outside class (virtual or f2f) during collaboration on projects or take home exams. This 46 element scale was also shown to be statistically valid and reliable.

'''''Waldman v. Canada''''' (Communication No. 694/1996) was a case decided by the UN [[Human Rights Committee]] in 1999.

==Facts==

Under the Education Act of [[Ontario]] every separate school was entitled to full public funding. Separate schools were defined as [[Catholic schools in Canada|Roman Catholic schools]]. The Education Act stated: "1. (1) "separate school board" means a board that operates a school board for Roman Catholics; ... 122. (1) Every separate school shall share in the legislative grants in like manner as a public school". As a result, Roman Catholic schools were the only religious schools entitled to the same public funding as the public secular schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/undocs/session67/view694.htm U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/67/D/694/1996 Para. 2.3]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] confirmed the law in two cases, including [[Adler v. Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/undocs/session67/view694.htm U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/67/D/694/1996 Para. 2.8-2.11]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Waldman wished to provide his children with a [[Jewish education]], and he faced therefore a financial hardship, which was not experienced by a Roman Catholic parent. He contended that the Education Act violated Articles 2, 18, 26, 27 of the Covenant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/undocs/session67/view694.htm U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/67/D/694/1996 Para. 3.1-3.5]&lt;/ref&gt;

==HRC views==

The Committee held that "the Covenant does not oblige States parties to fund schools which are established on a religious basis. However, if a State party chooses to provide public funding to religious schools, it should make this funding available without discrimination. This means that providing funding for the schools of one religious group and not for another must be based on reasonable and objective criteria. In the instant case, the Committee concludes that the material before it does not show that the differential treatment between the Roman Catholic faith and the author's religious denomination is based on such criteria".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/undocs/session67/view694.htm U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/67/D/694/1996 Para. 10.6]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it has found violation of Article 26 (prohibition of [[discrimination]]) in the case. The Committee decided that in view of its conclusions in regard to article 26, no additional issue arises for its consideration under articles 18, 27 and 2.

Committee's member [[Martin Scheinin]] filed a concurring opinion, noting that "Providing for publicly funded education in minority languages for those who wish to receive such education is not as such discriminatory, although care must of course be taken that possible distinctions between different minority languages are based on objective and reasonable grounds. The same rule applies in relation to religious education in minority religions. In order to avoid discrimination in funding religious (or linguistic) education for some but not all minorities States may legitimately base themselves on whether there is a constant demand for such education".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/undocs/session67/view694.htm U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/67/D/694/1996 Individual opinion of M. Scheinin. Para. 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation with other case law==

A day before ''Waldman'' decision, HRC rejected a similar complaint from several Canadians as inadmissible, pointing that "the authors while claiming to be victims of discrimination, do not seek publicly funded religious schools for their children, but on the contrary seek the removal of the public funding to Roman Catholic separate schools. Thus, if this were to happen, the authors' personal situation in respect of funding for religious education would not be improved. The authors have not sufficiently substantiated how the public funding given to the Roman Catholic separate schools at present causes them any disadvantage". Four HRC members, however, submitted a separate opinion, considering the case to be admissible and drawing parallel with ''Waldman v. Canada''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/undocs/session67/view816.htm U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/67/D/816/1998 (4 November 1999)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent actions==
In November 2005, HRC repeated that Canada should adopt steps in order to "eliminate discrimination on the basis of religion in the funding of schools in Ontario."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Political activism==
Dagan was active in actions of [[civil disobedience]] as a method of protesting the [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|Disengagement Plan]]. Dagan helped to organize the 2007 [[Yom Ha'atzmaut]] march to Homesh. During [[Sukkot]] of the same year, Dagan organized a [[pilgrimage]] to Homesh. Many former residents and sympathetic Israelis camped out on the grounds where Homesh houses were demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3451416,00.html|title=Homesh First  plans 'mass pilgrimage' to former West Bank settlement on Sukkot|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/870283.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christian Science Monitor]] quoted Dagan as warning against the disengagement: "You'll be creating a terror state that would threaten most of the country with [[Qassam rocket|Qassam]] [missiles]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0712/p06s01-wome.html|title=New arrivals fight West Bank plan|first=Joshua|last=Mitnick|date=12 July 2005|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Dagan helped to spearhead a public relations campaign focused on welcoming Israelis to the West Bank. Dagan hoped to counter what he said were "radical left-wing Israeli groups" that promote hatred against settlements in Israel and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Settlers PR offensive|date=23 October 2013|work= Alternative News|url= http://alternativenews.org/archive/index.php/politics/israeli-sosaciety/7236-settlers-pr-offensive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, he became involved in an international incident between the U.S State Department and Israel. In January 2015, Jewish settlers at the "[[Adei Ad]] illegal outpost"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chaim |last=Levinson |title=Settlers throw stones at U.S. consulate convoy in West Bank|date=2 January 2015|work= [[Haaretz]]|url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.635066}}&lt;/ref&gt; threw stones at diplomats from a U.S. delegation who had arrived to inspect vandalism reported at a grove of Palestinian-owned trees in the occupied West Bank. It was reported that recently, settlers were suspected of uprooting thousands of olive tree saplings, some of which had been planted in honor of senior Palestinian official [[Ziad Abu Ein]], who collapsed and died after an altercation with an Israeli soldier. The American consulate came to inspect the grove because some of the land owners claim U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dan |last=Williams|title=American Diplomatic Convoy Stoned by Jewish Settlers on West Bank|work= The Jewish Daily Forward |date=2 January 2015|url=http://forward.com/articles/211997/american-diplomatic-convoy-stoned-by-jewish-settle/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter |last=Beaumont |title=Israeli settlers stone two cars belonging to US consulate staff|date= 1 January 2015|work= [[The Guardian]]|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/02/israeli-settlers-stone-two-cars-us-consulate-staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; No injuries were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/11322543/Israeli-settlers-in-stone-throwing-confrontation-with-US-diplomats.html|title=Israeli settlers in stone-throwing confrontation with US diplomats|date=2 January 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; A U.S. State Department spokesman, Jeff Rathke, said, "We can confirm a vehicle from the Consulate General was pelted with stones and confronted by a group of armed settlers today in the West Bank, near the Palestinian village of Turmus Ayya." He added that the U.S. is "deeply concerned" about the attack, and that the Israeli authorities recognize "the seriousness of the incident".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US 'deeply concerned' by settler attack on consulate staff|date=2 January 2015|work= [[Times of Israel]]|url= http://www.timesofisrael.com/us-deeply-concerned-by-settlers-throwing-stones-at-consulate-staff/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A police spokeswoman said the police were investigating the incident, and no arrests had been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli Settlers Threw Stones at U.S. Diplomats' Cars|date=2 January 2015|work= [[Newsweek]]|url= http://www.newsweek.com/israeli-settlers-threw-stones-us-diplomats-cars-296332}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. State Department has offered the Israeli authorities a videotape of the incident showing no American drew weapons. Yossi Dagan, in his role as Head of the Shomron Regional Council, urged Interior Minister [[Gilad Erdan]] to expel the American delegation, claiming they were spies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4610866,00.html |first=Itamar |last=Eichner |title=US embassy: Diplomats did not pull guns on settlers|date= 3 January 2015|work= [[YNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protest Outside Prime Minister's Residence ===

In the end of October 2017 Yossi Dagan, Head of [[Shomron Regional Council]] lead a three week long protest outside of the Prime Minister's Residence in [[Jerusalem]]. Together with leaders of other municipalities in [[Judea and Samaria Area|Judea and Samaria]] ([[West Bank]]) and families of victims of terror. The protesters demanded that the government approve with no delay funding to improve roads and security for the Jewish towns in the region. During the last week they declared a hunger strike. On Friday Nov. 9, the group held a press conference on site together with [[MK David Bitan]] who represented PM [[Netanyahu]] in negotiations, they announced that their demands were accepted and that the PM had signed a letter to the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/fight-over-new-west-bank-roads-drives-settler-leaders-further-apart/|title=Fight over new West Bank roads drives settler leaders further apart|last=Jacob|first=Magid|date=11/9/2017|work=Times of Israel|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Joseph's Tomb ===
Through cooperation and protection of the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] command The Shomron Regional Council organizes periodic visits and events at [[Joseph's Tomb]] in [[Nablus]] [[Shechem]] which in [[West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord|Area A]] under the full control of the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]].
