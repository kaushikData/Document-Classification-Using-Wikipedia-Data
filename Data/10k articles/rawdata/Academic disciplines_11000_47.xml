'''''A Theory of Legal Order''''' ('''''Teoria dell'Ordinamento Giuridico''''') is a book of the Italian [[jurist]] [[Norberto Bobbio]] about one of the [[Ontology|ontological]] elements of ''[[philosophy of law|foundations of law]]'' &amp;mdash; the ''juridical order''.

== Importance ==
Seen by scholars as an important work&lt;ref name="UNIN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FILIPPI"&gt;{{cite book|last=Filippi|first=Alberto|last2=Lafer|first2=Celso|title=A Presença de Bobbio|place=São Paulo|publisher=UNESP|year=2004|page=33|isbn=8571395713}}&lt;/ref&gt; in understanding of a conceptual constructivist approach of the [[scientific method|scientific way]] of thinking law in the new era of the [[jurisprudence of values]], Bobbio's book faces this challenge in five chapters.

== Chapters&lt;ref&gt;Bobbio, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; ==
# Concept of law; going from the ''juridical norm'' to the ''juridical order''.
# Unity of legal order;sources of law; the ''[[grundnorm]]''; law and force.
# Cohesiveness of the legal order; solution of conflicts between norms.
# Completeness of legal order; the problem of ''gaps of law''; [[analogy]].
# Relationships between different legal orders, in different countries or in the same country in different times; different legal orders in the same State.

== Criticism ==
"It's in the first chapter of the book, which could be a possible introduction, that the renowned jusphilosopher opted for not making. It is the connexion of this book, that study the complex of norms, with his former work, [[A Theory of Judicial Norms]], that analyzed isolatedly the norm; and then both constitute his integer general theory of law."&lt;ref name="SHV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pt.shvoong.com/law-and-politics/law/1940893-teoria-ordenamento-jur%C3%ADdico/|title=Teoria do ordenamento jurídico|date=28 October 2009|publisher=Shvoong - A Fonte Global de Resumos e Críticas|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"''A Theory of Legal Order'' is an attempt to solve some problems that the theory of the norm hadn't managed to solve or even had answer unsatisfatorily, as, for instance, the questions of the completeness and conflicts between norms. Bobbio declares expressly that his work can be considered a continuation or complement of [[Kelsen]]'s work, specially his ''General Theory of Law and State''."&lt;ref name="JUS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jus.com.br/revista/texto/6953/sintese-comentada-a-teoria-do-ordenamento-juridico-de-norberto-bobbio|title=Síntese comentada à teoria do ordenamento jurídico de Norberto Bobbiopublisher=Jus.coml.br|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In this work, the italian thinker analyzes no more the norm isolatedly, but the relationship between them inside an order. The author emphasizes the formal aspects of the unity, the cohesiveness and completess of law as a ''closed'' logical system, with the clear intention to survey the law with the objective criteria, ''[[sine qua non]]'' to rise them to a scientific level, through the juridical speech."&lt;ref name="UNIN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.uninove.br/ojs/index.php/prisma/article/viewFile/571/535|title=Bobbio e a Linguagem do Direito|author=Baptista, Fernando Pavan|publisher=Universidade Nove de Julho|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Masterpiece1704edition.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece and  contents page from 1704  edition of ''Aristotle's Masterpiece'']]
'''''Aristotle's Masterpiece''''', also known as '''''The Works of Aristotle, the Famous Philosopher''''', is a [[sex manual]] and a [[midwifery]] book that was popular in England from the early modern period through to the 19th century. It was first published in 1684 and written by an unknown author who falsely claimed to be [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="fissell" /&gt; As a consequence the author is now described as a [[Pseudo-Aristotle]], the collective name for unidentified authors who masqueraded as Aristotle. It is claimed that the book was banned in Britain until the 1960s,&lt;ref name="ex-classics" /&gt; although there was no provision in the UK for "banning" books as such. However reputable publishers and booksellers might have been cautious about vending ''Aristotle's Masterpiece'', at least in the wake of the [[Obscene Publications Act 1857|1857 Obscene Publications Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Lesley A.|title=It wasn't 'banned', and it's hardly rare|url=http://lesleyahall.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/it-wasnt-banned-and-its-hardly-rare.html|publisher=Lesley A. Hall Blog|accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After [[Nicholas Culpeper]]'s ''Directory for Midwives'' had been published in 1651, other writers and booksellers sought to emulate its great success. ''Aristotle's Masterpiece'' was among the two dozen works in the genre which were published in the following decades. This was in sharp contrast to the three titles which had been published on the subject in the previous century. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth century, the work was published in three different versions in 9, 20 and 78 editions respectively.&lt;ref name="fissell" /&gt; It was probably the most widely reprinted book on a medical subject in the eighteenth and early nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="bull" /&gt;

===Versions===
The first version borrowed most of its content from two earlier works, the ''Secret Miracles of Nature'' by [[Levinus Lemnius]] and the anonymous ''Complete Midwives Practice Enlarged''. The latter had been a successful work by itself, coming second only to Culpeper's ''Directory for Midwives'' in number of seventeenth century editions.&lt;ref name="fissell" /&gt;

A second version was released by publisher [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] in 1697. The first half contained most of the first version and the second half was borrowed from John Sadler's ''A Sick Women's Private Looking-Glas'', which was published in 1636. The third version was published around 1710 was more different from the previous versions, but again copied material from other works on the subject. These included the ''Directory for Midwives'', John Pechey's 1698 version of the ''Compleate Midwive's Practice Enlarged'' and other popular books on sex and reproduction available at the time.&lt;ref name="fissell" /&gt;

The third version was still printed and sold to a general audience in the early twentieth century. It remained unchanged from the eighteenth century editions because modern theory on sexuality had not yet been conceived. Because the book was based on the ancient theory of [[humorism]] it provided some outdated information, in particular on the home remedies it prescribed. Nevertheless, it was in fact more accurate and less harmful than some popular works on sexuality dating from the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="bull" /&gt;

===Reasons for attribution to Aristotle===
The title of the work was possibly chosen because Aristotle was seen as a sex expert in early modern England. Another popular pseudo-Aristotelian text which covered sex and reproduction, ''Aristotle's Problems'' (1595), had been responsible for this reputation.&lt;ref name="fissell" /&gt; The real Aristotle had also written works about the reproduction of animals (such as ''[[History of Animals]]'' and ''[[Generation of Animals]]'') and was considered an authority on scientific matters in general.&lt;ref name="bull" /&gt;

==Content==
The third version is divided in two parts. The first part covers anatomy, sexual intercourse and marriage. The second part was intended for married women and explains pregnancy and [[midwifery]].

The first part starts with a description of the male and female [[sex organ]]s in the first chapter. The second chapter advocates sexual intercourse in [[monogamy|monogamous]] relationships and warns against [[polygamy]] and [[adultery]] because it is forbidden by [[christianity|Christian]] doctrine. It finishes with an explanation of when the reproductive age begins and ends. The third chapter explores [[virginity]]. It correctly states that a torn [[hymen]] does not necessarily mean a woman is not a virgin.

The second part continues with the process of [[fertilisation]], pregnancy and how the sex of the fetus can be determined. The second chapter provides advice on how women can become pregnant. The third chapter describes the progress of pregnancy. Failure of the pregnancy, [[infertility]] and its causes are the subject of the fourth chapter. The part ends with a chapter on things women should do and avoid during their pregnancy.

'''Averted vision''' is a technique for viewing faint objects which uses [[peripheral vision]]. It involves not looking directly at the object, but looking a little off to the side, while continuing to concentrate on the object. This subject is discussed in the popular astronomy literature{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} but only a few rigorous studies{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} have quantified the effect. However, the technique is based on well-known properties regarding the structure of the eye{{citation needed|reason=What properties?|date=January 2016}}.

It is claimed{{by whom|date=November 2011}} this technique is most useful to astronomers for viewing large but faint nebulae and star clusters. By developing the technique, some observers report{{by whom|date=January 2016}} a gain of up to three or four [[Apparent magnitude|magnitudes]] (15:1 to 40:1). Others report{{by whom||date=January 2016}} no appreciable improvement.

There is some evidence that the technique has been known since ancient times, as it seems to have been reported by [[Aristotle]] while observing the star cluster now known as [[Messier 41|M41]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://messier.seds.org/more/m041_ari.html M41 possibly recorded by Aristotle]&lt;/ref&gt; This technique of being able to see very dim lights over a long distance has also been passed down over hundreds of generations of sailors whose duties included standing lookout watches, making one better able to spot dim lights from other ships or shore locations at night.

It also matters whether you avert right or left.{{cn|date=September 2018}} The most effective direction is that which places the object on the nasal side of the vision.{{cn|date=September 2018}} This avoids the possibility the object will be imaged on the blind spot at approximately 15 degrees on the temporal side of the line of sight.  So, for right-eyed observers it is best to shift to the right, and for left-eye observers it is best to shift to the left. Some people{{Who|date=October 2010}} also claim that it is better to avert up instead of down. The best thing{{citation needed|reason=Has this been demonstrated as a good approach? Or is it better to simply look in the directions indicated earlier in the paragraph?|date=January 2016}} to do is practice and find the best location for one's own eyes.

A similar technique is called scope rocking, which is done by simply moving the telescope back and forth slightly to move the object around in the field of view. This technique is based on the fact that the visual system is more sensitive to motion than to static objects.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==Physiology==
Averted vision works because there are virtually no [[rod cell|rods]] (cells which detect dim light in black and white) in the [[Fovea centralis|fovea]]: a small area in the center of the eye. The fovea contains primarily [[cone cell|cone]] cells, which serve as bright light and color detectors and are not as useful during the night. This situation results in a decrease in visual sensitivity in central vision at night. Based on the early work of Osterberg (1935), and later confirmed by modern adaptive optics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/eye.2016.107|pmid=27229708|pmc=4985666|title=Variation in rod and cone density from the fovea to the mid-periphery in healthy human retinas using adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy|journal=Eye|volume=30|issue=8|pages=1135–1143|year=2016|last1=Wells-Gray|first1=E. M.|last2=Choi|first2=S. S.|last3=Bries|first3=A.|last4=Doble|first4=N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the density of the rod cells usually reaches a maximum around 20 degrees off the center of vision. 

The resolution of the eye, its ability to resolve fine detail, falls off rapidly beyond 0.6 degrees from the line of sight as illustrated by Anstis (1974).  It is four times poorer at 10 degrees radius as it is within the 0.6 degree radius from the line of sight.

'''Biomechanical engineering''' is a [[bioengineering]] subdiscipline, which applies principles of [[mechanical engineering]] to [[biological systems]] and stems from the scientific discipline of [[biomechanics]]. Topics of interest in the field include [[biomedical engineering]] and [[agricultural engineering]]. '''[[Biomechanics]], specifically,''' is the study of biological systems such as the human body, combined with the study of mechanics, or mechanical applications. Using the skills learned from biology, engineering and physics to research and develop for health care, such as organs that have been made from artificial materials, or new advances with prosthetic limbs. The creation of [[biomaterial]], which is a fake material that can be integrated into living tissue or can live in sync with biological material, is one of the biggest advances in medicine to this day. Those in this field might also hold the job of not only installing, but also adjusting, maintain, repairing, and providing technical help for all the biomaterial.

'''Biomusic''' is a form of [[experimental music]] which deals with [[Natural sounds|sounds created or performed by non-humans]]. The definition is also sometimes extended to include sounds made by humans in a directly biological way. For instance, music that is created by the brain waves of the composer can also be called biomusic as can music created by the human body without the use of tools or instruments that are not part of the body ([[singing]] or vocalizing is usually excluded from this definition).

Biomusic can be divided into two basic categories: music that is created solely by the animal (or in some cases plant), and music which is based upon animal noises but which is arranged by a human composer.  Some forms of music use recorded sounds of nature as part of the music, for example [[new-age music]] uses the nature sounds as backgrounds for various musical [[soundscape]]s, and [[ambient music]] sometimes uses nature sounds modified with reverbs and delay units to make spacey versions of the nature sounds as part of the ambience.

==Forms==

===Bird song and/or biophonies in music===

The incorporation of [[bird song]] in music is one of the most widely studied forms of biomusic. Notable in this regard is the French composer [[Olivier Messiaen]] who began incorporating accurately transcribed bird songs into his music in 1952. One obstacle facing the use of bird songs in music is their complexity and usually very high register. Nevertheless, Messiaen included a variety of bird songs in many of his mature works including his ''[[Catalogue d'oiseaux]]'' ("Birds catalogue"), piano (1956–58) which incorporated songs from thirteen different birds. Also, he incorporated the themes of many birds in his orchestral piece, "''Chronochromie''".

In Western music, recordings of bird songs have also been used in numerous works. The first one is ''[[Pines of Rome]]'' (1924) by [[Ottorino Respighi]] (the third movement includes the sound of a [[nightingale]] recorded onto a phonograph, played in the concert hall during the movement's ending. This was something that had never been done before, and created discussion). A famous one is ''[[Cantus Arcticus]]'' (1972) by the Finnish composer [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]]. Subtitled ''Concerto for Birds and Orchestra'' this piece incorporates tape recordings of birdsong recorded near the Arctic Circle and on the bogs of Liminka in northern Finland.

A nightingale can be heard on [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Cirrus Minor (song)|Cirrus Minor]]" (''[[More (soundtrack)|More]]'', 1969) or "[[Grantchester Meadows (song)|Grantchester Meadows]]" (''[[Ummagumma]]'', 1969), a sample of tweeting birds on [[Laurie Anderson]]'s  "[[O Superman]]" (1981), [[seagull]]s within [[concept album]] ''[[L'Opéra du pauvre]]'' (1983) by French singer-songwriter [[Léo Ferré]]. The entire [[biophony]] of a [[soundscape]] can be heard on the [[Beaver &amp; Krause]] 1968 Warner Brothers album (released in 1970), "''In a Wild Sanctuary''", the first album on the theme of [[ecology]] and the first album to incorporate entire natural soundscapes as components of the orchestration. This work anticipated by 44 years, the 2014 Cheltenham Music Festival (UK) premier of "''The Great Animal Orchestra Symphony for Orchestra and Wild Soundscapes''," composed by [[Bernie Krause]] and Oxford (Balliol College) former composer-in-residence, [[Richard Blackford]], performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. This, too, features the first symphony based on ecological themes and the first to perform, live, with whole natural soundscapes informing the orchestral form and themes, just as biophonies and geophonies inspired music (rhythm, melody, organization of sound, timbre, and dynamic) at the dawn of cultural time.

Commissioned by the [[Alonzo King LINES Ballet]], an international corps based in San Francisco, the score for ''Biophony,'' composed by Bernie Krause and Richard Blackford, consists almost entirely of biophonies and geophonies and premiered in 2015. It has been performed worldwide, since.

It is important to note that of the more than 13,100 bird species, less than 100 have been accepted into Western classical or other music genres (or .007%). With the exception of entire biophonies, the abstract and deconstructed selection of particular birds (and the voices of a few other non-human animals such as certain cetaceans or canids) in these genres have been largely predicated on the convenient ways in which they happen to fit the models consistent with the then-current paradigms of the Academy – those considered to be "musical" at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Animal Orchestra: Finding the Origins of Music in the World's Wild Places, by Bernie Krause (Little Brown, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whale song in music===

Recorded [[whale song]] also frequently inspired [[20th century experimental music]]. One example is in [[George Crumb|George Crumb’s]] ''[[Vox Balaenae]]'' (Voice of the Whale), a composition for electric flute, electric cello, and amplified piano.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgecrumb.net/comp/voice-p.html Vox Balaenae (Voice of the Whale)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511212137/http://www.georgecrumb.net/comp/voice-p.html |date=May 11, 2008 }} The official George Crumb home page (Retrieved 10 October 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Vox Balaenae does not include actual recorded whale songs, it is not a pure biomusic composition. Another similar piece that could be considered true biomusic is ''[[And God Created Great Whales]]'', a piece written in 1970 by American composer [[Alan Hovhaness]]. This work for orchestra and whale songs brings the recorded sounds of [[humpback whale|humpback]], [[bowhead whale|bowhead]], and [[orca|killer]] [[whales]] directly into the concert hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,197507,00.html And God Created Great Whales (1970) for Orchestra and Whale Songs] Artist direct (Retrieved 10 October 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The song "[[Il n'y a plus rien]]", from French singer-songwriter [[Léo Ferré]]'s eponymous album (1973), begins and ends with recorded whale songs mixed with a symphonic orchestra. Another piece utilizing recorded whale song is the ''Earth Mass (Missa Gaia)'' by [[Paul Winter]] (1982) which is performed at the Episcopal Church of St. John the Divine each year to celebrate the Feast of St. Francis. One of the movements uses a four note motive derived from a recorded humpback whale song that opens and closes that segment of the work.

===Neurofeedback===

Music created by [[neurofeedback]] relies on the brainwaves of a human subject to create music. An [[Electroencephalophone]] (a musical instrument that converts brain waves to sound) was first designed by [[Erkki Kurenniemi]] in the 1960s. American composer [[David Rosenboom]] further pioneered work with [[neurofeedback]] music as has [[Brazil]]ian [[composer]] [[Eduardo Reck Miranda]]. Neurofeedback composition is still in development, and though it is widely experimented with, it is still very uncommon to see it performed.

===Cybernetic biomusic===

In 1975, [[Grateful Dead]] associate [[Ned Lagin]] released an album of experimental [[space music]] entitled ''Seastones'' on Round Records; he described the recording as ''"cybernetic biomusic"'', emphasizing the use of computers and synthesizers to create organic-impressionistic sounds and meditative feelings.  The album was one of the first commercially released recordings to feature digital computers and the [[Don Buchla|Buchla]] digital-polyphonic synthesizer.&lt;ref name="prendergast244"&gt;{{cite book |last=Prendrergast |first=Mark |year=2000|title=The Ambient Century: From Mahler to Trance - the Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|pages= 244 |isbn=1-58234-134-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2004 to 2007, [[Pete Townshend]] collaborated with composer [[Lawrence Ball]] and programmer Dave Snowdon to set up a project called [[The Lifehouse Method]], an Internet site where applicants could "sit" for an electronic musical portrait made up from data they entered into the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1052567/townshends-method-finally-ready-for-unveiling|title=Townshend's Method|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 23 April 2007, Ball released a double album on [[iTunes]] called ''Method Music - Imaginary Sitters, Imaginary Galaxies'' which is part of Pete Townshend's Lifehouse Method music project.

===Other examples===

Biomusic can take many other forms. These can include the simple amplification of animal sounds, or the creation of music through the fluctuation of electric current in plants. More unusual still is the use of animal notation: [[Sheet music|music scores]] created by animals, often in the form of paw prints. Biomusic can also take the form of animals trained to perform specific behaviors as part of a musical performance (birds trained to sing for instance).

''[[Music from The Body]]'' is the biomusic [[soundtrack album]] to Roy Battersby's 1970 documentary film ''The Body'', about [[human biology]], narrated by [[Vanessa Redgrave]] and [[Frank Finlay]]. The music was composed and performed in collaboration between [[Pink Floyd]] member [[Roger Waters]] and [[Ron Geesin]], and uses sounds made by the human body (slaps, breathing, laughing, whispering, farts, etc.) in addition to more traditional guitar, piano and stringed instruments.

The experimental ambient/noise group [[Tribes of Neurot]] released an album titled "Adaptation and Survival: The Insect Project" in 2002; a multidirectional sound experiment in which all sounds were originally produced by insects and then manipulated and synthesized.

A collaboration album between [[Breakcore]] artists [[Venetian Snares]] and [[Hecate]] entitled [[Nymphomatriarch]] was composed entirely from sounds of the two performing various sexual activities together, which were distorted and time-stretched to resemble typical [[Breakcore]] samples.

[http://www.translatingnature.org/lake/ The Lake], by artist [[Julie Freeman]] tracked natural biological motion via electronic tagging systems, and transformed the data collected into musical composition and animation.

Musicians [[Caninus (band)|Caninus]], [[Hatebeak]] and [[Lil B]]&lt;ref&gt;http://pitchfork.com/news/48656-lil-bs-cat-keke-the-adopted-tabby-drops-track/&lt;/ref&gt; have used animals as [[Lead vocalist|lead]] or [[backing vocalist]]s.

Biotextiles include implantible devices such as [[surgical suture]]s, [[hernia]] repair fabrics, [[artery|arterial]] [[Medical grafting|grafts]], [[artificial skin]] and parts of [[artificial heart]]s.  They were first created 30 years ago by Dr. Martin W. King, a professor in [[North Carolina State University]]’s College of Textiles[http://www.tx.ncsu.edu/faculty_center/directory/detail.cfm?id=63]. 

'''Medical textiles''' are a broader group which also includes bandages, wound dressings, hospital linen, preventive clothing etc.  [[Antiseptic]] biotextiles are textiles used in fighting against [[cutaneous]] [[bacteria]]l proliferation.  [[Zeolite]] and [[triclosan]] are at the present time the most used molecules.  This original property allows to fightinhibits the development of odours or bacterial proliferation in the diabetic foot.

== New developments ==

In the new paradigm of [[tissue engineering]], professionals are trying to develop new textiles so that the body can form new tissue around these devices so it’s not relying solely on synthetic foreign implanted material.  Graduate student Jessica Gluck has demonstrated that viable and functioning liver cells can be grown on textile scaffolds [http://www.physorg.com/news96302396.html].

'''Carrion''' (from [[Latin]] ''caro'', meaning "meat") is the decaying flesh of a dead animal.

==Overview==
Carrion is an important food source for large [[carnivore]]s and [[omnivore]]s in most ecosystems. Examples of carrion-eaters (or [[scavenger]]s) include [[vulture]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[eagle]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Hovenden, Frank. [http://www.comoxvalleynaturalist.bc.ca/wild_side/2003/vulture.html The Carrion Eaters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601062448/http://www.comoxvalleynaturalist.bc.ca/wild_side/2003/vulture.html |date=1 June 2010 }}.

[[File:Flies settle on a sheep carrion.jpg|thumb|[[Fly|Flies]] settling on a [[sheep]] carrion]]
Carrion begins to decay the moment of the animal's death, and it will increasingly attract insects and breed [[bacteria]]. Not long after the animal has died, its body will begin to exude a foul odor caused by the presence of bacteria and the emission of [[cadaverine]] and [[putrescine]].

Some plants and [[fungus|fungi]] smell like [[Decomposition|decomposing]] carrion and attract insects that aid in reproduction. Plants that exhibit this behavior are known as [[carrion flower]]s. [[Phallaceae|Stinkhorn mushroom]]s are examples of fungi with this characteristic.
[[File:Coyoteelk.jpg|thumb|left|A [[mountain coyote|coyote]] feeding on elk carrion in [[Yellowstone National Park]]'s Lamar Valley during winter.]]
Sometimes carrion is used to describe an infected carcass that is diseased and should not be touched. An example of carrion being used to describe dead and rotting bodies in literature may be found in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' (III.i):&lt;ref&gt;[http://shakespeare.mit.edu/julius_caesar/julius_caesar.3.1.html The Life and Death of Julies Caesar]. SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men, groaning for burial.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example can be found in Daniel Defoe's ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' when the title character kills an unknown bird for food but finds "its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing".

==In Noahide law==
{{main|Noahide laws}}
The thirty-count laws of [[Ulla (Talmudist)]] include the prohibition of humans consuming carrion.&lt;ref&gt;talmud, hullin 92b&lt;/ref&gt; This count is in addition to the standard seven law count and has been recently{{when|date=September 2018}} published from the Judeo-Arabic writing of [[Shmuel ben Hophni Gaon]] after having been lost for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mossad HaRav Kook]] edition of Gaon's commentary to Genesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chaff''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|æ|f}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɑː|f}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cambridge Pronouncing Dictionary|author=Daniel Jones|editor1=Peter Roach |editor2=James Hartman |editor3=Jane Setter |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the dry, scaly protective casings of the seeds of [[cereal grain]], or similar fine, dry, scaly plant material such as scaly parts of [[flower]]s, or finely chopped [[straw]]. Chaff is indigestible by humans, but [[livestock]] can eat it and in [[agriculture]] it is used as livestock [[fodder]], or is a waste material [[plough]]ed into the [[soil]] or burnt.

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|chaff|glume}}
"Chaff" comes from [[Middle English]] ''chaf'', from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''ceaf'', related to [[Old High German]] ''cheva'', "husk".

==Grain chaff==
[[Image:Usdaeinkorn1 Triticum monococcum.jpg|thumbnail|Spikelets of a hulled wheat, [[Einkorn wheat|einkorn]]]]In [[Poaceae|grass]]es (including [[cereal]]s such as [[rice]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s, and [[wheat]]), the ripe seed is surrounded by thin, dry, scaly [[bracts]] (called [[glume]]s, [[Lemma (botany)|lemma]]s and [[palea (botany)|palea]]s), forming a dry [[husk]] (or hull) around the grain. Once it is removed it is often referred to as chaff.
 
In wild  cereals and in the primitive domesticated [[einkorn]],&lt;ref name=Potts&gt;Potts, D. T. (1996) ''Mesopotamia Civilization: The Material Foundations'' [[Cornell University Press]]. p. 62. {{ISBN|0-8014-3339-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[emmer]]&lt;ref&gt;Nevo, Eviatar &amp; A. B. Korol &amp; A.

The process of loosening the chaff from the grain so as to remove it is called ''[[threshing]]'' &amp;ndash; traditionally done by milling or pounding. Separating remaining loose chaff from the grain is called ''[[winnowing]]'' &amp;ndash; traditionally done by repeatedly tossing the grain up into a light wind which gradually blows the lighter chaff away. This method typically utilizes a broad, plate-shaped basket or similar receptacle to hold and collect the winnowed grain as it falls back down.

Domesticated grains such as [[durum wheat]] and [[common wheat]] have been bred to have chaff that is easily removed. These varieties are known as ''free-threshing'' or ''naked''.

Chaff should not be confused with [[bran]], which is finer scaly material that is part of the grain itself.

==Straw chaff==
Chaff is also made by chopping [[straw]] (or sometimes coarse [[hay]]) into very short lengths, using a machine called a [[chaff cutter]].  Like grain chaff this is used as animal feed, and is a way of turning coarse fodder into a form more palatable to livestock.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/collection/search/display.aspx?irn=56 "The Chaff cutter"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiquefarmtools.info/ Cutting chaff by hand]: detail of painting by [[David Teniers the Younger]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorians.asp-host.co.uk/themes/agriculture/chaffcutterobj.htm A Victorian chaff cutter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321063813/http://www.victorians.asp-host.co.uk/themes/agriculture/chaffcutterobj.htm |date=March 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Botany==
In [[botany]], chaff refers to the thin [[List of plant morphology terms#Basic flower parts|receptacular]] [[bracts]] of many species in the sunflower family [[Asteraceae]] and related families. They are modified scale-like [[leaves]] surrounding single [[floret]]s in the flower-head.&lt;ref name="Jones2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Jones|title=Plant Life of Kentucky: An Illustrated Guide to the Vascular Flora|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bsngx7s0OI4C&amp;pg=PA751|date=25 March 2005|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-7194-6|pages=751–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphor==
Chaff as a waste product from grain processing leads to a [[metaphor]]ical use of the term, to refer to something seen as worthless.  This is commonly used in the expression "to separate the wheat from the chaff" from [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 3:12 which says: Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.&lt;ref name="Manser2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin H. Manser|title=I Never Knew That Was in the Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hPJjxbDpxgC&amp;pg=PT1224|date=13 February 2000|publisher=Thomas Nelson Inc|isbn=978-1-4185-6690-6|pages=1224–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare also the "[[Parable of the Tares]]", which refers to a mixture of wheat and [[Lolium temulentum|tares]] (a kind of weed). Another example is in Psalm 1:4 of the [[Bible]], which says: The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. (KJV)

==Use==
Hungarian engineer László Schremmer has recently discovered that by the use of chaff-based filters it is possible to reduce the [[arsenic]] content of  water to 3 microgram/litre. This is especially important in areas where the potable water is provided by filtering the water extracted from the underground [[aquifer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mno.hu/gazdasag/szenzacios-magyar-talalmany-1068315 Newspaper article] (in Hungarian) published by [[Magyar Nemzet]] on April 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1848">A '''committee machine''' is a type of [[artificial neural network]] using a [[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]] strategy in which the responses of multiple neural networks (experts) are combined into a single response.&lt;ref&gt;HAYKIN, S. Neural Networks - A Comprehensive Foundation. Second edition. Pearson Prentice Hall: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  The combined response of the committee machine is supposed to be superior to those of its constituent experts.  Compare with [[ensembles of classifiers]].

== Types ==

===Static structures===
In this class of committee machines, the responses of several predictors (experts) are combined by means of a mechanism that does not involve the input signal, hence the designation static. This category includes  the following methods:
*[[Ensemble averaging]]
In ensemble averaging, outputs of different predictors are linearly combined to produce an overall output.
*[[Boosting (meta-algorithm)|Boosting]]
In boosting, a weak algorithm is converted into one that achieves arbitrarily high accuracy.

===Dynamic structures===
In this second class of committee machines, the input signal is directly involved in actuating the mechanism that integrates the outputs of the individual experts into an overall output, hence the designation dynamic. There are two kinds of dynamic structures:
*[[Mixture of experts]]
In mixture of experts, the individual responses of the experts are non-linearly combined by means of a single gating network.
*[[Hierarchical mixture of experts]]
In hierarchical mixture of experts, the individual responses of the individual experts are non-linearly combined by means of several gating networks arranged in a hierarchical fashion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18510">The '''conservation and restoration of lighthouses''' is the process by which lighthouse structures are preserved through detailed examination, cleaning, and in-kind replacement of materials.  Given the wide variety of materials used to construct lighthouses, a variety of techniques and considerations are required.

[[Lighthouses]] alert sea goers of rocky shores nearby as well as to provide landmark navigation.  Lighthouses also act as a physical representation to maritime history and advancement.  These historic buildings are prone to deterioration due to their location on rocky outcrops of land near the water, as well as severe weather events, and the continued rise of sea levels.  Given these conditions preservation and conservation efforts have increased.

==Exterior==

===Ground===

The ground consists of the land, outbuildings, and landscape that the lighthouse property sits on.  The grounds may also include buildings from other time periods as part of the cultural landscape.  The types of buildings, their relationship to one another, their location over the whole of the property, types of flora and their location, and potential archaeological sites (if they have been identified), are all aspects that are related to the lighthouse and its history and should be considered during conservation of the property.

Outbuildings are prone to deterioration because they were often used for storage and were not maintained to the same standards as the lighthouse.  Former repairs to buildings may have used inexpensive materials as a temporary fix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IALA Lighthouse Conservation Manual|url=https://americanlighthousecouncil.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/lighthouse_conservatiion_manual_ed_1_may_2006.pdf|website=International Association of Lighthouse Authorities}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These materials often degrade making the building unstable.  Any buildings that remain intact and in their original location are historically important to the relationship and usage of the lighthouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines|title=Treatment of Historic Properties, 1995|url=https://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/arch_stnds_8_2.htm|website=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Materials, colors, and details are all representative of the lighthouse when it was active and are often considered during the preservation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Historic Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook.pdf|website=United States Lighthouse Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coatings===

====Paint====

Lighthouse exterior paint was often used in colorful patterns to act as a day marker.  Paint was also used to help protect the exterior structure of the lighthouse from wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Historic Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook.pdf|website=United States Lighthouse Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Evidence of paint degradation include crazing, cracking, peeling between coats, blistering, and wrinkling.  Repair can be made through spot treatments or through a complete replacement of the paint.
Original paint was made of lead and tended to withstand harsh conditions while still protecting the structure.  The required use of National Historic Preservation approved paints has proved difficult as they do not work well with the lighthouse structure's original materials &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piedras Blancas Lighthouse Preservation Expertise|url=https://americanlighthousecouncil.org/2014/10/04/piedras-blancas-lighthouse-seeking-preservation-expertise/#comments|website=American Lighthouse Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, salt in the air can lead to severe chalking of the paint surface and cause premature failure of latex paint products.  Most repainting projects will have to begin with removal of the original base coat, followed by a thorough surface cleaning to remove impurities, then ended with a complete repainting of the structure.  Paint normally only lasts between five and eight years, depending on the lighthouse and conditions.

====Stucco====

[[Stucco]] has been traditionally used as a protective barrier on the exterior of lighthouses.  Stucco is made up of fine granular particles mixed together with a binder.  The composition of stucco has changed significantly over the years and may require laboratory analysis to determine the makeup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Historic Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook.pdf|website=United States Lighthouse Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the problems with stucco arise from prolonged contact with water or moisture which breaks down the structure of the particles and binder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Preservation Briefs|title=The Preservation and Repair of Historic Stucco|url=https://www.nps.gov/tps/how-to-preserve/briefs/22-stucco.htm|website=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the texture of stucco is prone to removal when abraded.  As with most preservation, gentle cleaning of the surface can help remove dirt and impurities and inhibit further deterioration.

===Iron===

Iron was a popular material used in lighthouse construction.  Multiple types of iron were used including: [[cast iron]], [[wrought iron]], [[steel]], [[galvanized iron]], [[galvanized steel]], and [[stainless steel]].  Cast iron was the most popular material because it resists corrosion and can be cast into a multitude of shapes.  Though iron is sturdy it can be prone to deterioration through corrosion (oxidation, glavanic corrosion, and graphitization), weathering, and flaws from the manufacturing process.  Degradation of iron is visible through pitting, cracks, erosion, rust, blistering, flaking, and scaling.

Preservation and restoration of iron should be completed using the least invasive approach possible.  Iron is strong but can be easily damaged through improper or harsh procedures. "Many of the maintenance and repair techniques... particularly those relating to cleaning and painting, are potentially dangerous and should be carried out only by experienced and qualified workmen using protective equipment suitable to the task. It may be necessary to involve a USCG engineer or architect, preservation architect, or building conservator familiar with lighthouse preservation to assess the condition of the iron and prepare contract documents for its treatment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Historic Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://www.nps.gov/maritime/nhlpa/handbook/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook_07_Part4Masonry1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masonry===

The [[masonry]] component of a lighthouse is made up of the bricks and stones on the exterior.  Damage to masonry is primarily caused by water, salt accumulation, expansion and contraction, abrasion, poor ventilation, and inappropriate cleaning techniques (ex. sandblasting).  Masonry may show many signs of deterioration  to include: bulges, cracks, efflorescence, erosion, flaking, sloping or uneven settlement, mold or mildew, missing stones or bricks, condensation buildup, and blistering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Historic Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://www.nps.gov/maritime/nhlpa/handbook/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook_07_Part4Masonry1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cleaning of Masonry====
Basic preservation of lighthouse masonry usually includes gentle surface cleaning.  Appropriate methods for cleaning are determined by the type of masonry that exists on the building.  Some cleaning methods include water, chemical, and laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Preservation Briefs|title=Assessing Cleaning and Water-Repellent Treatments|url=https://www.nps.gov/tps/how-to-preserve/briefs/1-cleaning-water-repellent.htm|website=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are multiple water cleaning methods.  Soaking is a process where the masonry undergoes a prolonged exposure to misting water to remove dirt.  Water washing uses a light to medium pressurized stream of water.  Some water washing may use the addition of detergents to increase dirt removal.  Chemical cleaning is also an option, but may be too harsh depending on the makeup of the masonry.  Chemical cleaners are either acidic or alkaline.  Laser cleaning is effective, mostly on smaller areas of masonry, but can be costly.  Occasionally, a lighthouse may be weatherproofed through covering the masonry with paint, stucco, or whitewash/lime mortar wash; but only if these are historically accurate for the structure.  Due to the differences in materials and construction techniques, only an experienced architectural conservator should be contacted for conservation or restoration work.

===Wood===

Wood was either used for construction on the exterior or in combination with masonry and/or iron to build components of the lighthouse (ex. stairs).  The largest cause for deterioration of wood in lighthouses is from exposure to moisture.  This exposure is normally the result of direct and prolonged exposure to damp conditions.  Other causes for deterioration include pests, fungus, and insects.  Some signs of decomposition include cracking, bulging, holes, peeling paint, leaning of the structure, gaps between joints, and exposed bare wood.

Some complications from wood deterioration can be solved through tight fitting seals around windows and doors, gutter systems, caulking of seams and joints, and sloping away of decking from the structure.  Regular cleaning of the surface may also help reduce accumulated residues on the wood thereby prolonging its usable life.  The most common treatment for replacing degraded wood is to use a splicing technique where new pieces of wood are joined with original wood features.  For severe cases, large in-kind replacements may be necessary.

==Interior==
Most lighthouse interiors were simple in construction and decoration, unless used as part of the light keeper's residence.  A majority of the issues related to lighthouse interiors stem from moisture, condensation, neglect, or inappropriate treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://www.nps.gov/maritime/nhlpa/handbook/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook_18_Part4Interiors.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Addressing issues on the exterior is required first in order to protect the inside of the structure.  Proper ventilation of the structure should be considered.  The season and geographical location of the lighthouse will determine what type and how often air exchanges should take place within the lighthouse.  According to the National Park Service "the absolute minimum air exchange for most mothballed lighthouses consists of one to four air exchanges every hour; one or two air exchanges per hour in winter and often twice that amount in summer."&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://www.nps.gov/maritime/nhlpa/handbook/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook_18_Part4Interiors.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lantern===
The lantern is the large round glass structure, that houses the lens, located at the top of the lighthouse.  This structure is made out of multiple materials, primarily glass, wood, and iron.

Any conservation or restoration processes should keep in mind that the lantern, ventilation shafts, and lens should not be obstructed in anyway.  Any replacement glass must be rated for wind standards that are likely to occur at the top of the lighthouse.

[[File:Kilauea Fresnel Lens.jpg|thumb|Lantern with a lens inside]]

====Lens====

The [[Fresnel lens]] was introduced for use in lighthouses around 1823. Generally, keeping the lens historically preserved, rather than restoration to period, will reduce stress on the lens and keep some of the lens's story intact (e.g. chips of the glass that are documented in historical light keeper's notes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Byrne|first1=Greg|title=The Conservation of the Classical Lighthouse Lens|url=http://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/Lens%20Conservation.pdf|website=United States Lighthouse Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to consult a conservator before attempting any conservation on a lens.  The glass that was used to make the lens is often brittle and may chip easily.  Lens glass etches easily from contact with oils or dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Commandant Instruction 16500.9|title=Classical Lens Maintenance|url=http://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/USCG%20Lens%20Directives.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To secure the prisms of the lens a compound of calcium carbonate, lead, and linseed oil, called [[litharge]], was used.  If deterioration of the litharge is found, it is likely that the prisms are not properly secured within the frame structure of the lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Historic Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook.pdf|website=United States Lighthouse Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the litharge is white in color (lead carbonate) the material is mostly non-porous and may not easily be preserved, meaning that full litharge replacement might be necessary.  If the litharge present is orange-red in color (lead-oxide), this substance tends to be more porous and may allow for stabilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Historic Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook.pdf|website=United States Lighthouse Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the lens was "floated in a trough of mercury"; though this practice has been abandoned, mercury contamination may still exist in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Commandant Instruction 16500.9|title=Classical Lens Maintenance|url=http://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/USCG%20Lens%20Directives.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cleaning a lens=====
Documentation of the prism normally begins with labeling all issues starting from the center prism, listed as number one, and then working outward sequentially. Identification should indicate whether it is an upper or lower prism.  Prisms are checked for firm seating by gently tapping on the ''outside'' of the glass only.  If there is any movement of the glass, conservators are normally called before any work is continued.  If the glass is stable, the prisms will then be checked for particulate matter.  If fine or non-abrasive particles are observed, a soft cotton cloth lightly wetted with distilled water may be used to gently clean the surface.  It is also possible to use denatured alcohol mixed with water to clean the glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Historic Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook.pdf|website=United States Lighthouse Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solution will vary from lens to lens as each has a different glass composition.  A conservator should be called in if any clouding of the glass is found as this is a sign of glass deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Historic Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook.pdf|website=United States Lighthouse Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, a routine polishing of the brass that secures the lenses would take place.  In preventive conservation, the task of brass polishing should not take place as it encourages loss of original material.  The patina that develops over time also helps create a protective barrier around the brass.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Disaster planning==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}Lighthouses are inherently prone to disasters due to their location. A disaster plan can help mitigate some of the issues that occur during a disaster situation. Most disasters are water related but fires, earthquakes, and especially erosion can also be causes. The disaster plan should be tailored to the disaster most likely to affect the lighthouse's location; however, it should take into regard multiple types of disasters. The lighthouse property and objects located within it should be thoroughly documented. Furthermore, complete photograph documentation of the property and collection can help with insurance claims and restoration.  There should be a copy of these documents located at the lighthouse as well as a secondary location in case they may not be accessible at the lighthouse due to a disaster.  Coordination with local authorities, like the police and fire department, may help during an emergency situation. Ideally, files should both be digitized and on paper.

===Moving a lighthouse===
Strong winds and waves cause land erosion around lighthouses. Over extended periods of time, the promontories that lighthouses are normally built on can be eroded to the point where the safety of the lighthouse is impacted. In extreme cases, the lighthouse might need to be relocated to a new plot of land in order to preserve the structure. There are four major lighthouse moves that have taken place in the United States: [[Block Island Southeast Light]]house, [[Cape Hatteras Light]]house, [[Sankaty Head Light]]house, and [[Gay Head Light]]house.

'''DCAF''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|i|ˌ|k|æ|f}}; '''Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces'''; [[French language|French]]: ''Centre pour le contrôle démocratique des forces armées - Genève,'' [[German language|German]]: ''Genfer Zentrum für die demokratische Kontrolle der Streitkräfte'') is an intergovernmental [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]]-based [[think tank]]&lt;ref name="thinktank"/&gt; that provides research and project support to states and international actors in improving [[security sector governance and reform]] (SSG and SSR).

DCAF was established in 2000 in the [[Canton of Geneva]] by the [[Switzerland|Swiss government]] and as of 2018 employs around 170 staff, has seven permanent offices and 63 member states.

== Mandate ==
DCAF was established in October 2000 under [[Law of Switzerland|Swiss law]] as a foundation and on the initiative of the [[Switzerland|Swiss government]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=DCAF By-Laws (unofficial translation from French)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=Geneva|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization states that it is a [[good governance]]-promoting foundation focusing on a specific [[public sector]] area—the [[National security|security sector]]. DCAF is mandated by its intergovernmental Foundation Council to assist partner states and international actors in improving the governance of the security sector through [[reform]] based on international norms and good practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpplatform.ch/pbguide/organisation/geneva-centre-democratic-control-armed-forces-dcaf|title=Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF) {{!}} GPPlatform|website=www.gpplatform.ch|access-date=2017-05-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824012946/http://www.gpplatform.ch/pbguide/organisation/geneva-centre-democratic-control-armed-forces-dcaf|archivedate=24 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Egtved Girl''' {{IPA-da|ˈɛɡtvɛð|}} (''c''. 1390&amp;ndash;1370 BC) was a [[Nordic Bronze Age]] girl whose well-preserved remains were discovered outside [[Egtved]], [[Denmark]] in 1921. Aged 16&amp;ndash;18 at death, she was slim, 160&amp;nbsp;cm tall (about 5&amp;nbsp;ft 3 in), had short, blond hair and well-trimmed nails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldtiden.natmus.dk/livet_i_oldtiden/hvordan_gik_de_klaedt/bronzealderens_dragter/bronzealderens_haarmode/language/vho/ ''Hair fashion of the Bronze age''] National Museum of Denmark. Retrieved 17.11.2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Her burial has been dated by [[dendrochronology]] to 1370 BC. She was discovered together with cremated remains of a child in a [[tumulus|barrow]] approximately 30 metres wide and 4 metres high. Only the girl's hair, brain, teeth, nails and a little of her skin remain preserved.&lt;ref name=Oldtiden&gt;{{cite web|title=Prehistoric period (until 1050 AD)|url=http://oldtiden.natmus.dk/udstillingen/bronzealderen/egtvedpigen/language/uk/|website=Oldtiden.natmus.dk|publisher=Nationalmuseet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burial==
The barrow was [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] in 1921, and an east-western aligned coffin was found. It was transported in sealed condition to the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in [[Copenhagen]], where it was opened and the Egtved Girl discovered.

She was buried fully dressed on an oxhide in the coffin. She wore a loose [[bodice]] with sleeves reaching the elbow. She had a bare waist and wore a short string skirt. She had bronze bracelets and a woolen belt with a large disc decorated with spirals and a spike. At her feet were the cremated remains of a child age 5&amp;ndash;6. By her head there was a small [[birch bark]] box which contained an [[stitching awl|awl]], bronze pins and a [[hair net]].

Before the coffin was closed she was covered with a [[blanket]] and an oxhide.  Flowering [[yarrow]] (indicating a summer burial) and a bucket of beer made of wheat, honey, [[bog-myrtle]] and [[cowberry|cowberries]] were placed atop.  Her distinctive outfit, which caused a sensation when it was unearthed in the 1920s, is the best preserved example of a style now known to be common in [[Northern Europe]] during the [[Bronze Age]].  The good preservation of Egtved girl is due to the acidic bog conditions of the soil, which is a common condition of this locale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |agency= |title=Remains of Bronze-Age Cultic Priestess Hold Surprise |url=http://www.livescience.com/50911-bronze-age-danish-burial.html |quote=The girl's final resting place was first unearthed in 1921, in a large burial mound made of peat bog. |newspaper=[[LiveScience]] |date=May 21, 2015 |accessdate=2015-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |agency= |title=Bronze Age priestess travelled great distances, scientists say |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2015/0522/Bronze-Age-priestess-travelled-great-distances-scientists-say |quote=The burial mound was made out of acidic peat from a bog |newspaper=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |date=May 22, 2015 |accessdate=2015-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists examined [[chemical isotope]]s from tissues in her teeth, fingernails, hair and clothing. The concentration of [[strontium]] in the earth varies with location. These concentrations are reflected in the local water sources from which humans drink, and retained in human tissues. Based on the concentrations of [[strontium-87]] and [[strontium-86]] they found, scientists made informed guesses about the girl's area of origin and where she lived at different times during her life. They suggest that the girl originally lived in [[Schwarzwald|the Black Forest]] region, but married and moved to Denmark. She is believed to have traveled back and forth between the two areas and was buried in Denmark after her death.&lt;ref name="Balter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Balter|first1=Michael|title=Coffin remains tell life story of ancient sun-worshiping priestess|journal=Science|date=May 21, 2015|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/05/coffin-remains-tell-life-story-ancient-sun-worshiping-priestess|accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramskov"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramskov|first1=Jens|title=Det er en tysker: Egtvedpigen stammer fra Schwarzwald|url=http://ing.dk/artikel/det-er-en-tysker-egtvedpigen-stammer-fra-schwarzwald-176214|accessdate=27 September 2016|work=Ingeniøren|date=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Margarita"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margarita Frei|first1=Karin|last2=Mannering|first2=Ulla|last3=Kristiansen|first3=Kristian|last4=Allentoft|first4=Morten E.|last5=Wilson|first5=Andrew S.|last6=Skals|first6=Irene|last7=Tridico|first7=Silvana|last8=Louise Nosch|first8=Marie|last9=Willerslev|first9=Eske|last10=Clarke|first10=Leon|last11=Frei|first11=Robert|title=Tracing the dynamic life story of a Bronze Age Female|journal=Scientific Reports|date=21 May 2015|volume=5|pages=10431|doi=10.1038/srep10431|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2015/150521/srep10431/full/srep10431.html|pmid=25994525|pmc=4440039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstruction==
The outfit was reconstructed for the [[National Museum of Denmark]] by the [[Lejre Experimental Centre]] and is on display there. A reconstructed set of clothes, as well as details of the excavation, are on display in the Egtved Girl's museum at the excavation site.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12618">'''Elder financial abuse''' is a type of [[elder abuse]] in which misappropriation of financial resources or abusive use of [[Economic abuse|financial control]], in the context of a relationship where there is an expectation of trust, causes harm to an older person.

The Older Americans Act of 2006 defines elder financial abuse, or financial exploitation, as “the [[fraud]]ulent or otherwise illegal, unauthorized, or improper act or process of an individual, including a caregiver or [[fiduciary]], that uses the resources of an older individual for monetary or personal benefit, profit, or gain, or that results in depriving an older individual of rightful access to, or use of, benefits, resources, belongings, or assets.”&lt;ref&gt;Older Americans Act of 2006, [http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:42%20section:1397j%20edition:prelim], retrieved July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===By family or caregivers===

Family members and informal or paid caregivers have special access to seniors and thus are often in a position to inflict financial abuse through [[deception]], [[coercion]], misrepresentation, undue influence, or theft. Common abusive practices include:
* Money or property is used without the senior's permission or taken from them, for example removal from their home and then use of the home by the abuser, or depositing income such as pension or benefit checks
* The senior's signature is forged or [[identity theft|identity is misappropriated]] for financial transactions
* The senior is coerced or influenced to sign over deeds or [[will (law)|wills]], or caused to execute legal documents they do not understand
* The abuser fraudulently obtains a [[power of attorney]] or [[guardianship]]
* Money is borrowed from the senior and never repaid

Family members engaged in financial abuse of the elderly may include spouses, children, or grandchildren. They may engage in the activity because they feel justified, for instance, they are taking what they might later inherit or have a sense of "entitlement" due to a negative personal relationship with the older person, or that it is somehow the price of a promise of lifelong care. Or they may take money or property to prevent other family members from getting the money or for fear that their inheritance may be lost due to cost of treating illnesses. Sometimes, family members take money or property from their elders because of gambling or other financial problems or [[substance abuse]]. (source?)

===Scams and fraud targeting seniors===

Seniors are also often deliberately targeted by scams, fraud, and misleading marketing – often by otherwise legitimate businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Shilling, D. (2008, November/December). "Improving the court system's response to elder abuse," Victimization of the Elderly and Disabled, 11, 49, 51-52, 59, 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt; This may include:
* fraudulent investment or insurance schemes
* fraudulent contracts and unauthorized charges imposed by internet service providers
* worthless "sweepstakes" that elderly persons must pay in order to collect winnings
* fake pharmaceutical or diet/health products
* medical billing scams and unnecessary medical care
* predatory or unnecessary lending, for example reverse mortgages
* charitable giving scams, including pressure to rewrite wills
* [[identity theft]]
* [[lottery scam]]s
* [[Work-at-home scheme|work from home schemes]] or other ways to generate income

A 1996 study by [[AARP]]&lt;ref&gt;AARP. (1996). Telemarketing fraud victimization of older Americans: an AARP survey. Washington, DC: AARP.&lt;/ref&gt; found that while individuals over 50 comprised 35% of the American population, they accounted for 57% of all fraud victims (AARP, 1996). Seniors' level of vulnerability to this type of exploitation varies by the type of scam. For example, the AARP found that lottery fraud victims were more likely to be women over 70 living alone, with lower education, lower income, and less financial literacy, while victims of investment fraud were more likely to be men between the ages of 55 and 62 who were married, with higher incomes and greater financial literacy.
&lt;ref&gt;“Off the Hook: Reducing Participation in Telemarketing Fraud (Washington, DC: 2003), [http://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/consume/d17812_fraud.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid financial exploitation===

Hybrid Financial Exploitation (HFE) is financial exploitation that co-occurs with [[physical abuse]] and/or [[neglect]]. HFE victims are more likely to be co-habiting with abusive individual, to have fair/poor health, to fear the abusive individual, to perceive abusive individual as caretaker, and to have a longer duration of abuse.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jackson S, Hafemeister T | year = 2012 | title = Pure financial exploitation vs. Hybrid financial exploitation co-occurring with physical abuse and/or neglect of elderly persons | url = | journal = Psychology Of Violence | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 285–296 | doi=10.1037/a0027273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estimates of size and scope==

Various attempts have been made to estimate the size and scope of the problem. The primary difficulties in estimating the size of the problem are:
* ''Differing descriptions of financial abuse'' – Victims often do not identify as having been a victim of fraud, so researchers generally offer respondents specific examples. The more specific the questions are, the more likely someone is to say they have experienced it – for example, surveys focused on [[identity theft]], [[telemarketing]], "[[Credit card fraud#Unexpected repeat billing|gray charges]]," or [[Securities fraud|investor fraud]] have found much higher rates than general surveys.
* ''Underreporting'' – Studies that rely on government databases or press reports are estimated to be off by factors ranging from five to forty, with 25 being a frequently cited number.&lt;ref&gt;Wasik, J. (2000). The fleecing of America’s elderly. Consumers Digest. March/April.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, because of the [[Social stigma#Current research|stigma]] of victimhood caregivers are more likely to report that their parents have been victimized than the parents are to self-report as victims.
* ''Differences in survey methodology'' – Some surveys ask for losses in the last year, some ask about losses in the last five years, and some ask "have you ever experienced…", and surveys have variously defined seniors as aged 45+, 50+, 60+, and 65+.

[[File:Centre Etude Polymorphisme Humain Institut Genetique Moleculaire Paris France.jpg|thumb|200px|CEPH]]
The '''Fondation Jean Dausset-CEPH''' or '''CEPH''', formerly the '''Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain''' (the ''Center for the Study of Human [[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphisms]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Human Molecular Genetics: Mechanisms of Inherited Diseases|author=Jack J. Pasternak|publisher=Wiley|date=2005|ISBN=9780471719175}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an international genetic research center located in [[Paris]], [[France]]. It produced a map that includes genetic markers of human [[chromosomes]] using a resource of [[biological immortality|immortalised]] cell cultures.

==Background==
In his 2005 addendum to his biography for the 1980 [[Nobel Prize]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1980/dausset-bio.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Dausset]] noted that, thanks to his Nobel Prize and a grant from the French Téléthon, he had been able in 1984 to create the Human Polymorphism Study Centre (CEPH), which soon after became Foundation Jean Dausset-CEPH. Dausset founded CEPH with the collaboration of Professors Howard Cann and Daniel Cohen.

The scientific director of CEPH is currently [[Jean-François Deleuze]] and its president is [[François d'Aubert]], a French politician, an auditor at the Cour des Comptes and a former minister delegate to research.

==Human genome==
Numerous collaborators working on the same large families as Dausset had collected for his Nobel Prize-winning studies on the [[human leukocyte antigen]] system, led to the addition of numerous gene markers and made it feasible to publish the first [[genetic map]] and, later on, the first [[physical map]] of the [[human genome]].

==New resources==
An exhaustive study of human populations around the world has also produced important publications from CEPH. Besides this, DNA samples from [[sibship]]s of people over 95 years old and a bank of [[centenarian]]s now provide a valuable research resource at the Foundation Jean Dausset-CEPH.

[[File:Punnett Square Genetic Carriers.PNG|thumb|Punnett square depicting a cross between two genetic carriers. The chance of two genetic carriers having a child with two copies of the recessive gene, thus being homozygous recessive, is 25%.]]
A '''hereditary carrier''' (or just '''carrier'''), is a person or other organism that has [[Genetics|inherited]] a recessive allele for a genetic trait or mutation but usually does not display that trait or show symptoms of the [[Genetic disease|disease]]. Carriers are, however, able to [[Heredity|pass]] the [[allele]] onto their offspring, who may then express the genetic if they inherit the recessive allele from both parents. The chance of two carriers having a child with the disease is 25%. This phenomenon is a direct result of the [[Dominance relationship#Recessive allele|recessive]] nature of many genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krasnewich|first1=D.|title=Carrier|url=https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=23|website=Talking Glossary of Genetic Terms|publisher=National Human Genome Research Institute|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==X-linked genes==
[[Queen Victoria]], and her daughters Princesses Alice and Beatrix, were carriers of the [[Sex linkage|X-linked]] [[hemophilia]] gene (an abnormal allele of a gene, necessary to produce one of the blood clotting factors). Both had children who continued to pass on the gene to succeeding generations of the royal houses of [[Spain]] and [[Russia]], into which they married.&lt;ref&gt;Potts, W.T.W. "Royal Haemophilia." Journal of Biological Education (Society of Biology) 30.3 (1996): 207. Academic Search Premier. 16 Sept. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Since males only have one X chromosome, males who carried the altered gene had hemophilia B Females have two X chromosomes, so one copy of an [[X-linked recessive]] gene would cause them to be an asymptomatic carrier. These females simply passed it to half of their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pagon|first1=R. A.|last2=Adam|first2=M. P.|last3=Ardinger|first3=H. H.|title=Illustrated Glossary|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/|publisher=GeneReviews. University of Washington, Seattle|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cystic fibrosis==
Up to 1 in 25 individuals of Northern European ancestry may be considered carriers of mutations ([[Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator|CFTR genes]]) that can lead to [[cystic fibrosis]]. The disease appears only when two of these carriers have children, as each pregnancy between them will have a 25% chance of producing a child with the disease. However, it is also thought that carriers of CF may be more resistant to diarrhea during [[typhoid fever]] or [[cholera]], and are therefore not truly asymptomatic. This resistance leads to increased fitness of the carriers, known as a [[heterozygote advantage]], and thereby increases the frequency of the altered genes in the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rodman |first1=D.M. |last2= Zamudio |first2=S. |title= The Cystic Fibrosis Heterozygote--Advantage in Surviving Cholera? |journal= [[Medical Hypotheses]] |date= 1991 |volume=36 |pages= 253–258 |doi= 10.1016/0306-9877(91)90144-n }}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} Although only about 1 of every 3,000 Caucasian newborns has CF, there are more than 900 known mutations of the gene that causes CF. Current tests look for the most common mutations.&lt;ref name= "Edwards"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Edwards |first1=Q. T. |last2=Seibert |first2=D. |last3=Macri |first3=C. |last4=Carolyn |first4=C. |last5=Tilghman |first5=J. |title= Assessing ethnicity in preconception counseling: Genetics--what nurse practitioners need to know|journal=Clinical Practice|date=November 2004|volume=16|issue=11|pages=472–480|doi=10.1111/j.1745-7599.2004.tb00426.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetic testing]] can be used to tell if a person carries one or more mutations of the CF gene and how many copies of each mutation. The test looks at a person’s [[DNA]], which is taken from cells in a blood sample or from cells that are gently scraped from inside the mouth.

The mutations screened by the test vary according to a person's ethnic group or by the occurrence of CF already in the family. More than 10 million Americans, including 1 in 25 Caucasian Americans, are carriers of one mutation of the CF gene. CF is present in other races, though not as frequently as in Caucasian individuals. 1 in 46 Hispanic Americans, 1 in 65 African Americans, and 1 in 90 Asian Americans carry a mutation of the CF gene.&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;

==Sickle cell anemia==
Sickle cell anemia is the most common genetic disorder among African Americans in the United States. While approximately 8% are carriers, 1 in 375 African Americans are born with the disease. Carriers are typically asymptomatic, but they may show symptoms at high altitudes or under oxygen-poor environments as in instances of extreme exercise.&lt;ref name= "Edwards" /&gt; Carriers are also known to be resistant to malaria, suggesting there is a heterozygote advantage in certain regions of Africa. This is a probable explanation for why the disease is most prevalent among African Americans &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=B.|first1=G.|title=Malaria and Sickle-Cell Anemia|journal=Science|date=October 5, 1956|volume=124|pages=619–624|doi=10.1126/science.124.3223.619 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Good Natured''''' is a book by [[primatologist]] [[Frans de Waal]] on animal behavior and the [[Evolutionary ethics|evolution of ethics]].

==Publishing history==

The book was published in 1996 by [[Harvard University Press]] under the full title '''''Good Natured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals'''''. Much of the book details observations of [[primate]] behavior, especially that of [[chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;de Waal 1996, p. 3: "After due attention in this book's first chapter to theories of evolutionary ethics, I will move on to more practical matters. Do animals show behavior that parallels the benevolence as well as the rules and regulations of human moral conduct? … As an ethologist specialized in primatology, I naturally turn most often to the order of animals to which we ourselves belong. … Our ancestors more than likely possessed many of the behavioral tendencies currently found in macaques, baboons, gorillas, chimpanzees, and so on."&lt;/ref&gt; On the final page, he concludes:

{{quote|We seem to be reaching a point at which science can wrest morality from the hands of philosophers. That this is already happening—albeit largely at a theoretical level—is evident from recent books by, among others, [[Richard D. Alexander]], Robert Frank, [[James Q. Wilson]], and [[Robert Wright (journalist)]]. The occasional disagreements within this budding field are far outweighed by the shared belief that evolution needs to be part of any satisfactory explanation of morality. … It takes up space in our heads, it reaches out to fellow human beings, and it is as much a part of what we are as the tendencies that it holds in check.&lt;ref&gt;De Waal 1996, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Grazing marsh''' is a [[British Isles]] term for flat, marshy grassland in [[polder]]s.  It consists of large grass fields separated by fresh or [[brackish]] ditches, and is often important for its wildlife.

==History==

Grazing marshes were created from [[medieval]] times by building [[dike (construction)|sea wall]]s (earth banks) across tidal [[mudflat]]s and [[salt marsh]] to make polders (though the term "polder" is little used in Britain). Polders in Britain are mostly drained by gravity, rather than active pumping. The original tidal drainage channels were augmented by new ditches, and [[flap valve]]s in the sea walls let water drain out at low [[tide]] and prevent the sea or tidal river from entering at high tide.  Constructing polders in this way is called ''inning'' or ''reclaiming'' from the sea.

Grazing marshes have been made in most lowland [[Estuary|estuaries]] in Britain, often leaving only the river channel and the lowest part of the estuary tidal. In a few cases (such as [[Newtown, Isle of Wight|Newtown]] Harbour on the [[Isle of Wight]], and [[Pagham Harbour]] in [[West Sussex]]) the sea walls have been breached, and the estuaries have returned to a tidal state.  Grazing marshes have also been made on low-lying open coasts.

Many grazing marshes were inned in stages, and the old sea walls (called ''counter walls'') may be found marooned far from the current sea wall.  Land levels on either side of a counter wall often differ by several metres. Paradoxically, the lower side is the land inned earlier, because sediment continued to build up on the side that remained tidal.

==Wildlife==

Wintering [[wildfowl]] are characteristic of grazing marshes, often including large flocks of [[Eurasian wigeon]], [[brent goose]], [[white-fronted goose]] and [[Bewick's swan]].  Many of these birds are hunted by predators such as [[peregrine falcon|peregrine]] and [[marsh harrier]].

In summer, [[Wader|waders]] such as [[common redshank]], [[Eurasian curlew]] and [[northern lapwing]] breed.

The ditches often have a range of salinity, depending on how close to the sea wall they are.  The more saline ditches host specialist brackish-water plants and animals.  These include, for example, the rare brackish amphipod ''[[Gammarus]] insensibilis'' and sea club-rush (''Bolboschoenus maritimus'').  Fresher ditches may support rare animals, such as the great silver water beetle (''Hydrophilus piceus'') and the [[great raft spider]] (''Dolomedes plantarius''), and a wide range of pondweeds (''[[Potamogeton]]'' and relatives).

The grassland vegetation usually has a fairly small number of species, but those present are often scarce elsewhere, such as [[Sea Arrowgrass|sea arrowgrass]] (''Triglochin maritimum''), divided sedge (''Carex divisa'') and strawberry clover ''Trifolium fragiferum''.

==Conservation==

Many grazing marshes have been converted into [[arable land]], often using pumped drainage to lower the water levels enough to grow crops.  The low ditch levels and agricultural runoff combine to remove much of the aquatic wildlife, although the arable fields may still be used by some wintering wildfowl.

Some areas of grazing marsh and other polder land have been used to recreate tidal habitats by a process of [[managed retreat]].

Many of the larger areas of grazing marsh bear nature conservation designations, including [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]], [[Special Protection Area]], [[Special Area of Conservation]] and [[Ramsar Site]].

==Examples of grazing marsh==

*[[Pevensey Levels]] in [[East Sussex]]
*[[Romney Marsh]] in [[Kent]] and [[East Sussex]]
*The [[Somerset Levels]]
*The [[Thames Estuary]] marshes in [[Kent]] and [[Essex]]
*Marshes along the [[River Wantsum]] in [[Kent]]—formerly the Wantsum Channel separating the [[Isle of Thanet]] from the mainland
*[[Moss Valley, Derbyshire]]

The '''Heart of Europe Bio-Crystallography Meeting''' (short '''HEC-Meeting''') is an annual [[academic conference]] on [[structural biology]], in particular [[protein crystallography]]. Researchers from universities, other research institutions and industry from [[Austria]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]] and [[Poland]] meet to present and discuss current topics of their research. The talks are predominantly given by PhD students (doctoral students). An exception is the invited HEC lecture, which is held by a renowned scientist of the research field. The format of the HEC meeting has been adopted from the eleven years older [http://regiomeeting.eu/ Rhine-Knee Regional Meeting on Structural Biology].

== History of the HEC-Meeting ==
The HEC-Meeting dates back to an initiative in the year 1998 of Manfred Weiss and Rolf Hilgenfeld, who were researchers at the Institute for Molecular Biotechnology (IMB) in [[Jena]] and intended to establish a meeting format similar to the [http://regiomeeting.eu/ Rhine-Knee Regional Meeting on Structural Biology] in the [[New states of Germany|New Länder]].&lt;ref&gt;Mariusz Jaskolski und Michal M. Sikorski: ''15 Years of Heart of Europe bio-Crystallography Meetings – Reminiscences.'' Poznan 2013, {{ISBN|978-83-927740-1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both conferences are regional meetings of German scientists together with scientific research groups of the neighbouring countries. Nine groups from Germany (the new states and West-Berlin), Poland and Czech Republic participated in the first HEC-Meeting from 8 to 10 October 1998. Later also groups from Austria and the Old Federal States participated.

[[File:2009 Bay Area Maker Faire - Jeri.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Audodidact computer programmer [[Jeri Ellsworth]] at a 2009 Bay Area "Maker Faire" conference.]]
The '''history of women in engineering''' predates the development of the profession of engineering. Before engineering was recognized as a formal profession, women with engineering skills often sought recognition as inventors, such as [[Hypatia]] of Alexandria (350 or 370–415 AD), who is credited with the invention of the [[hydrometer]]. During the Islamic Golden Period from 8th Century until 15th Century along with men who were masters in Engineering, philosophy, mathematics, Science,Physics etc., there were also many muslim women who were inventors and engineers much before the european rennaisance. In the 19th century, women who performed engineering work often had academic training in mathematics or science. [[Ada Lovelace]] (1815–1852) was privately schooled in mathematics before beginning her collaboration with [[Charles Babbage]] on his [[analytical engine]] that would earn her the designation of the "first computer programmer." [[Hertha Marks Ayrton]] (1854–1923), a British engineer and inventor studied mathematics at Cambridge in the 1880s. [[Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu]] (1887–1973) is one of the first female engineers in Europe. In the early years of the twentieth century, a few women were admitted to engineering programs, but they were generally looked upon as curiosities by their male counterparts.

[[Alice Perry]] was the first woman in [[Europe]] to graduate with a degree in engineering in 1906 from [[National University of Ireland, Galway|Queen's College, Galway]].&lt;ref name="Irish Architectural Archive"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irish Architectural Archive|title=PERRY, ALICE JACQUELINE|url=http://www.dia.ie/architects/view/4332/PERRY-ALICEJACQUELINE|website=Dictionary of Irish Architects 1720-1940|publisher=Irish Architectural Archive|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu]], a Romanian engineer graduated from the [[Technical University of Berlin]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="Amazing Romanians"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cociuban|first1=Anca|title=Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu – First female engineer in the world|url=http://amazingromanians.ro/2014/02/13/elisa-leonida-zamfirescu-first-female-engineer-in-the-world/|website=Amazing Romanians|accessdate=8 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208215432/http://amazingromanians.ro/2014/02/13/elisa-leonida-zamfirescu-first-female-engineer-in-the-world/|archivedate=8 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entry of the United States into [[World War II]] created a serious shortage of engineering talent as men were drafted into the armed forces. The [[General Electric Corporation|GE]] on-the-job engineering training for women with degrees in mathematics and physics, and the [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation|Curtiss-Wright]] Engineering Program had "Curtiss-Wright Cadettes"{{r|Bix}}{{Verify source|date=July 2013}} ("Engineering Cadettes", e.g., Rosella Fenton).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=The Penn Stater |title=In Memoriam: Pilot and Physics Teacher |date=July–August 2013 |quote=Fenton...arrived at Penn State in 1942 as part of the '''Curtiss-Wright Engineering Program''', which was training women to replace male engineers who were fighting in World War II. [After] work[ing] at Curtiss-Wright, [she] enlist[ed] in the Navy, including a stint at...Wright-Patterson... She later taught physics at Cal State-Sacramento for 38 years.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company partnered with Cornell, [[Penn State]], [[Purdue]], the [[University of Minnesota]], the [[University of Texas]], RPI, and [[Iowa State University]] to create an engineering curriculum that eventually enrolled over 600 women. The course lasted ten months and focused primarily on aircraft design and production.&lt;ref name=Bix&gt;Bix, Amy Sue, "'Engineeresses' Invade Campus: Four decades of debate over technical coeducation." ''IEEE Technology and Society Magazine,'' Vol. 19 Nr. 1 (Spring 2000), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kathleen McNulty]] (1921–2006), was selected to be one of the original programmers of the [[ENIAC]]. [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] began to admit women engineering students in 1952. The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) had graduated its first female student, [[Ellen Swallow Richards]] (1842–1911) in 1873. The École Polytechnique in Paris first began to admit women students in 1972. The number of BA/BS degrees in engineering awarded to women in the U.S. increased by 45 percent between 1980 and 1994. However, from 1984–1994, the number of women graduating with a BA/BS degree in [[computer science]] decreased by 23 percent.

==Terminology==
Although the terms [[engineer]] and [[engineering]] date from the Middle Ages, they acquired their current meaning and usage only recently in the nineteenth century. Briefly, an engineer is one who uses the principles of engineering – namely acquiring and applying scientific, mathematical, economic, social, and practical knowledge – in order to design and build structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes. Some of the major branches of the engineering profession include [[civil engineering]], [[military engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[computer engineering]], and [[biomedical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title= What is engineering and what do engineers do? | work= National Academy of Engineering website FAQ | url= http://www.nae.edu/About/FAQ/20650.aspx | accessdate= 2011-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventors==
Before engineering was recognized as a formal profession, women with engineering skills often sought recognition as inventors. One of the earliest women inventors was [[Hypatia]] of Alexandria (350? 370?–415), who is credited with the invention of the [[hydrometer]]. [[Tabitha Babbit]] (1784–1853?) was an American toolmaker who invented the first circular saw.  [[Sarah Guppy]] (1770–1852) was an Englishwoman who patented a design for bridge foundations. [[Mary Dixon Kies]] (1752–1837) was the first American woman to receive a patent for her method of weaving straw in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Autumn, ''Mothers and Daughters of Invention: Notes for a Revised History of Invention'' (Metuchen, NJ and London: Scarecrow Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century: entry into technical professions==
With the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century, new technology-based occupations opened up for both men and women. [[Sarah Bagley]] (1806–?) is remembered not only for her efforts to improved working conditions for women mill workers in Lowell, Massachusetts, in the 1830s and 1840s, but also for being one of the earliest women to work as a telegraph operator. [[Mathilde Fibiger]] (1830–1872), a Danish novelist and advocate of women's rights, became a telegraph operator for the Danish State Telegraph system in the 1860s.

Engineering began to be taught as a formal academic discipline in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The [[École Polytechnique]] in France was established in 1794 to teach military and civil engineering; [[West Point Military Academy]] in the United States established a program modeled after the École Polytechnique in 1819. [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI) began to teach civil engineering in 1828. However, none of these institutions admitted women as students at the time of their founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title= No. 1107: Engineering Education | author= John H. Lienhard | work= Engines of our Ingenuity | url= http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1107.htm | accessdate= 2011-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, women who performed engineering work often had academic training in mathematics or science. [[Ada Lovelace]] (1815–1852), [[Lord Byron]]'s daughter, was privately schooled in mathematics before beginning the collaboration with [[Charles Babbage]] on his [[analytical engine]] that would earn her the designation of the "first computer programmer." [[Hertha Marks Ayrton]] (1854–1923), a British engineer and inventor who helped develop electric arc lighting, studied mathematics at Cambridge in 1880, but was denied a degree, as women were only granted certificates of completion at the time.  Similarly, [[Mary Engle Pennington]] (1872–1952), an American chemist and refrigeration engineer, completed the requirements for a BS degree in chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania in 1892, but was given a certificate of proficiency instead.
[https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Morais_de_Sarmento Rita de Morais Sarmento] (1872–1931) was the first woman to obtain an Engineering degree from the Polytechnic Academy of Porto, in Portugal. She obtained this degree in 1894 and latter certified in 1896, which means she may have been the first formally recognised female engineer in Europe.
[[Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu]] (1887–1973) is one of the first formally recognised female engineers in Europe. Due to prejudices against women in the sciences, she was rejected by the School of Bridges and Roads in Bucharest, Romania. However, in 1909, she was accepted at the Royal Academy of Technology in Berlin. She graduated from the university in 1912, with a degree in engineering, specialising in chemistry, possibly becoming one of the first women engineers in the world. Other women in engineering in the same time period include three Danish women: Agnes Klingberg, Betzy Meyer, and Julie Arenholt, who graduated in 1897 and 1901 from 'Polyteknisk Læreanstalt', today known as the Danish Technical University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ida.dk/content/de-foerste-kvindelige-ingenioerer-agnes-og-betzy-pionerer|title=De første kvindelige ingeniører Agnes og Betzy - to pionerer|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Danish Society of Engineers, IDA website|work=|accessdate=2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first female engineering graduate in Britain was [[Alice Perry]] who graduated from Queen's College, Galway in 1906.

Women without formal engineering degrees were also integral to great 19th century civil engineering feats. Emily Warren Roebling is recognized as managing the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, and was the first person to cross the bridge at its opening ceremony in 1883.&lt;ref name="asce.org"&gt;http://www.asce.org/templates/person-bio-detail.aspx?id=11203&lt;/ref&gt; Roebling's husband, Washington Roebling, worked as the chief engineer for the Brooklyn Bridge project until he fell ill of decompression sickness. Upon her husband's illness, Emily Warren Roebling assumed her husband's duties at the project site, and taught herself about material properties, cable construction, calculating catenary curves, and the like.&lt;ref name="asce.org"/&gt;

==20th century: entry into engineering programs==

In the early years of the twentieth century, a few women were admitted to engineering programs, but they were generally looked upon as curiosities by their male counterparts. [[Nora Stanton Blatch Barney]] (1883–1971), daughter of [[Harriot Stanton Blatch]] and granddaughter of [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], was the first woman to receive a degree in civil engineering from [[Cornell University]] in 1905. In the same year, she was accepted as a junior member of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]; however, twelve years later, after having worked as an engineer, architect, and engineering inspector, her request for an upgrade to associate membership was denied. [[Olive Dennis]] (1885–1957), who became the second woman to graduate from Cornell with a civil engineering degree in 1920, was initially hired by the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] as a draftsman; however, she later became the first person to claim the title of Service Engineer when this title was created.

[[Alice Perry]] was the first woman in [[Europe]] to graduate with a degree in engineering in 1908 from [[National University of Ireland, Galway|Queen's College, Galway]].&lt;ref name="Irish Architectural Archive"/&gt; [[Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu]], a Romanian engineer graduated from the [[Technical University of Berlin]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="Amazing Romanians"/&gt;

[[Edith Clarke]], the inventor of the graphical calculator, was the first woman to earn a degree in MIT's electrical engineering department in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engineergirl.org/Engineers/HistoricalEngineers/4399.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke also became the first woman admitted to the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]], the precursor to the IEEE. She taught at the University of Texas Austin, where she was the only woman faculty member in the engineering department.

==World War II engineering programs for women==

The entry of the United States into [[World War II]] created a serious shortage of engineering talent as men were drafted into the armed forces at the same time that industry ramped up production of armaments, battleships, and airplanes.  The U.S. Office of Education initiated a series of courses in science and engineering that were open to women as well as men.

Private programs for women included [[General Electric Corporation|GE]] on-the-job engineering training for women with degrees in mathematics and physics, and the [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation|Curtiss-Wright]] Engineering Program had "Curtiss-Wright Cadettes"{{r|Bix}}{{Verify source|date=July 2013}} ("Engineering Cadettes", e.g., Rosella Fenton).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The company partnered with Cornell, [[Penn State]], [[Purdue]], the [[University of Minnesota]], the [[University of Texas]], RPI, and [[Iowa State University]] to create an engineering curriculum that eventually enrolled over 600 women. The course lasted ten months and focused primarily on aircraft design and production.&lt;ref name="Bix"/&gt;

[[Thelma Estrin]] (1924–2014 ), who would later become a pioneer{{Specify|reason=What did she pioneer?|date=July 2013}} in the fields of computer science and biomedical engineering, took a 1942 three-month engineering assistant course at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] and earned [[University of Wisconsin]] BSc, MSc, and PhD degrees.{{Dubious|reason=This anecdote that she took an engineering assistant course and earning 3 EE degrees doesn't seem to be wikinotable—what did Estrin DO AS AN ENGINEER?|date=July 2013}}

Through an accelerated program brought on by the war, [[Lois Graham]] (1925-2013) graduated from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in 1946&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rpi.edu/about/alumni/inductees/graham.html|title=Lois Graham, Engineering Education Leader|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first woman in the United States to receive a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (M.S. ME ’49, Ph.D. ’59).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://engineering.iit.edu/news/2014/01/memoriam-lois-graham-ms-me-49-phd-59-iit-armour-college-engineering|title=In Memoriam – Lois Graham (M.S.

==Postwar era==

In 1943, the [[United States Army]] authorized a secret project at the University of Pennsylvania's [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]] to develop an electronic computer to compute artillery firing tables for the Army's [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]]. The project, which came to be known as [[ENIAC]], or Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, was completed in 1946.

Previous to the development of the ENIAC, the U.S. Army had employed women trained in mathematics to calculate artillery trajectories, at first using mechanical desk calculators and later the [[differential analyzer]] developed by [[Vannevar Bush]], at the Moore School. In 1945, one of these "computers", [[Kathleen McNulty]] (1921–2006), was selected to be one of the original programmers of the ENIAC, together with  [[Frances Spence]] (1922– ), [[Betty Holberton]] (1917–2001), [[Marlyn Wescoff]], [[Ruth Lichterman]] (1924–1986), and [[Betty Jean Jennings]] (1924–2011). McNulty, Holberton, and Jennings would later work on the [[UNIVAC]], the first commercial computer developed by the [[Remington Rand Corporation]] in the early 1950s.

In 1946, [[Hattie Scott Peterson]] gained a degree in civil engineering, believed to be the first African-American woman to do so.&lt;ref name="California State Library"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hattie Peterson (1913-1993)|url=http://www.library.ca.gov/calhist/calendar6-1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409134822/http://www.library.ca.gov/calhist/calendar6-1.html?utm_source=csl0613|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 April 2016|website=Library.ca.gov|publisher=California State Library|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance to coeducation in engineering schools, 1950s–1970s==

The Cold War and the space race between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] created additional demands for trained engineering talent in the 1950s and 1960s. Many engineering schools in the U.S. that had previously admitted only male students began to tentatively adopt coeducation. After 116 years as an all-male institution, RPI began to admit small numbers of female students in the 1940s. [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] began to admit women engineering students in 1952, but only in programs not available in other state universities. It would be 1968 before women were admitted to all courses offered by Georgia Tech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Terraso |first=David |title=Georgia Tech Celebrates 50 Years of Women |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology News Room |date=2003-03-21 |url=http://www.gatech.edu/news-room/release.php?id=98 |accessdate=2006-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924111921/http://www.gatech.edu/news-room/release.php?id=98 |archivedate=2006-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="females"&gt;{{cite news|first=Joshua|last=Cuneo|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2003-04-11/focus/3|title=Female faculty, staff offer professional perspectives|date=2003-04-11|accessdate=2007-03-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060110222125/http://www.nique.net/issues/2003-04-11/focus/3 |archivedate = January 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) had graduated its first female student, [[Ellen Swallow Richards]] (1842–1911) in 1873; she later became an instructor at MIT. However, until the 1960s, MIT enrolled few female engineering students, due in part to a lack of housing for women students. After the completion of the first women's dormitory on campus, McCormick Hall, in 1964, the number of women enrolled increased greatly.  Influenced in part by the [[second wave feminism]] movement of the late 1960s and 1970s, female faculty members at MIT, including [[Mildred Dresselhaus]] and [[Sheila Widnall]], began to actively promote the cause of women's engineering education.&lt;ref&gt;Bix, "'Engineeresses' Invade Campus," 25-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The École Polytechnique in Paris first began to admit women students in 1972.

[[Margaret Hamilton (scientist)|Margaret Hamilton]] is also notable for her contributions to computer and aerospace engineering in the 1970s. Hamilton, the director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory at the time, is famous for her work in writing the on-board guidance code for the Apollo 11 mission.&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/@verne/margaret-hamilton-the-engineer-who-took-the-apollo-to-the-moon-7d550c73d3fa#.i1blqgw5r&lt;/ref&gt;

==1980s–1990s==

As more engineering programs were opened to women, the number of women enrolled in engineering programs increased dramatically. The number of BA/BS degrees in engineering awarded to women in the U.S. increased by 45 percent between 1980 and 1994. However, during the period of 1984–1994, the number of women graduating with a BA/BS degree in computer science decreased by 23 percent (from 37 percent of graduates in 1984 to 28 percent in 1994). This phenomenon became known as "The incredible shrinking pipeline," from the title of a 1997 paper on the subject by Dr. [[Tracy Camp]], a professor in the Department of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at the [[Colorado School of Mines]].&lt;ref&gt;Camp, Tracy, "The Incredible Shrinking Pipeline", ''Communications of the ACM'', Vol. 40 Nr. 10 (October 1997), 103–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the reasons for the decline cited in the paper included:
* The development of computer games designed and marketed for males only;
* A perception that computer science was the domain of "hacker/nerd/antisocial" personality types;
* Gender discrimination in computing;
* Lack of role models at the university level.&lt;ref&gt;Camp, T., and Gurer, D., "Women in Computer Science: Where Have We Been and Where are We Going?" ''Proceedings, Women and Technology: Historical, Societal, and Professional Perspectives.'' IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society, New Brunswick, NJ, July 1999, 242–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==

===United States===
According to studies by the [[National Science Foundation]], the percentage of BA/BS degrees in engineering awarded to women in the U.S. increased steadily from 0.4 percent in 1966 to a peak of 20.9 percent in 2002, and then dropped off slightly to 18.5 percent in 2008.  However, the trend identified in "The incredible shrinking pipeline" has continued; the percentage of BA/BS degrees in mathematics and computer science awarded to women peaked in 1985 at 39.5 percent, and declined steadily to 25.3 percent in 2008.

The percentage of master's degrees in engineering awarded to women increased steadily from 0.6 percent in 1966 to 22.9 percent in 2008. The percentage of doctoral degrees in engineering awarded to women during the same period increased from 0.3 percent to 21.5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title= S&amp;E Degrees: 1966–2008 | work= National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, National Science Foundation | url= https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf11316/content.cfm?pub_id=4062&amp;id=2 | accessdate= 2011-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Only 9.6% of engineers in Australia are women, and the rate of women in engineering degree courses has remained around 14% since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.robogals.org/about/the-case-for-robogals&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

'''Jane’s Walk''' is a series of neighbourhood walking tours. Named after urban activist and writer [[Jane Jacobs]], Jane's Walks are held annually during the first weekend in May to coincide with her birthday.

Jane's Walks are led by volunteers, and are offered for free.&lt;ref name="janeswalk.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janeswalk.org/information/about/janes-walk/|title=About Jane's Walk - Jane's Walk|work=janeswalk.org|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The walks are led by anyone who has an interest in the neighbourhoods where they live, work or socialise. They are not always about architecture and heritage, and offer a more personal take on the local culture, the social history and the planning issues faced by the residents.&lt;ref name="janeswalk.org"/&gt;

Since its inception in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/article1138720.ece |title=Take a tour of your hidden neighbourhood |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016230721/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/article1138720.ece |archive-date=16 October 2010 |date=30 April 2009 |access-date=17 February 2017 |author=LeBlanc, Dave |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jane’s Walk has happened in cities across North America and around the world.

'''Kinesin-like protein KIF1A''', also known as '''axonal transporter of synaptic vesicles''' or '''microtubule-based motor KIF1A''', is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''KIF1A'' [[gene]].&lt;ref name="entrez"&gt;{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: kinesin family member 1A| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=547| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7539720"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Okada Y, Yamazaki H, Sekine-Aizawa Y, Hirokawa N | title = The neuron-specific kinesin superfamily protein KIF1A is a unique monomeric motor for anterograde axonal transport of synaptic vesicle precursors | journal = Cell | volume = 81 | issue = 5 | pages = 769–80 |date=June 1995 | pmid = 7539720 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(95)90538-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10323250"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keller MP, Seifried BA, Rabin BA, Chance PF | title = Mapping of the kinesin-related gene ATSV to chromosome 2q37 | journal = Hum.

== Function ==

KIF1A is a member of the [[kinesin]] family. This protein is highly similar to mouse heavy-chain kinesin member 1A protein, which is an anterograde motor protein that transports membranous organelles along [[axon]]al [[microtubule]]s. It is thought that this protein may play a critical role in the development of axonal [[neuropathy|neuropathies]] resulting from impaired axonal transport.

NYU Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; stemming from the writings of the French sociologist and philosopher [[Bruno Latour]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; MC focuses exclusively on the [[scientific controversy|controversies surrounding scientific knowledge]] rather than the established scientific facts or outcomes. Thus, it helps sociologists, anthropologists and other social scientists get insights not into scientific knowledge ''per se'', but rather into ''the process of gaining knowledge''. Thus, MC sheds light on those intermediate stages corresponding to the actual research process and pinpoints the connections between scientific work and other types of activities.

==History==
The term "mapping controversies"  was first suggested in relation to analysis of scientific and technological controversies,&lt;ref&gt;Latour., B. Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers through Society, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and then lately re-affirmed as a widely applicable methodological approach going beyond the boundaries of Science Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Latour, B. Reassembling the social: An introduction to actor-network-theory. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually used for the methodology that identifies and tracks down the polemics or debate surrounding a scientific fact, and utilises various visualisation tools to present the problem in its complexity.

Recently Latour initiated the project "Mapping Controversies on Science for Politics (MACOSPOL)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macospol.eu MACOSPOL] www.macospol.eu Retrieved on 2009-02-16&lt;/ref&gt; The showcase website is mappingcontroversies.net &lt;ref&gt;[http://mappingcontroversies.net/Home/AboutMacospol www.mappingcontroversies.net  Retrieved on 2009-12-21 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008-2009 several universities in Europe and USA started teaching "Mapping Controversies" courses for students in political sciences,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medialab.sciences-po.fr/projets/teaching-controversy-mapping/ Média Lab Sciences Po] sciences-po.fr Retrieved on 2017-06-21&lt;/ref&gt; engineering,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demoscience.org/ MIT] web.mit.edu Retrieved on 2009-02-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch/ Ecoles Polytechniques Fédérales de Lausanne] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712012636/http://mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch/ |date=2012-07-12 }} mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch Retrieved on 2009-02-16&lt;/ref&gt; and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mappingcontroversies.co.uk University of Manchester] mappingcontroversies.co.uk Retrieved on 2009-02-16&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier attempt to stage controversies in museum settings took place at the [http://ec.europa.eu/research/conferences/2005/forum2005/docs/mapping_controversies_report.pdf Gallery of Research] in Vienna in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Yaneva, A., Rabesandratana, T., Greiner, B.

[[File:Orchestra.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A symphony orchestra]]

''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'' defines '''music criticism''' as 'the intellectual activity of formulating judgements on the value and degree of excellence of individual works of music, or whole groups or genres'.&lt;ref&gt;Bujic, (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, it is a branch of [[musical aesthetics]]. With the concurrent expansion of interest in music and information media over the past century, the term has come to acquire the conventional meaning of journalistic reporting on musical performances.&lt;ref&gt;Bujic, (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of music criticism==

The musicologist [[Winton Dean]] has suggested that "music is probably the most difficult of the arts to criticize."&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 44&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[plastic arts|plastic]] or literary arts, the 'language' of music does not specifically relate to human sensory experience - Dean's words, "the word 'love' is common coin in life and literature: the note C has nothing to do with breakfast or railway journeys or marital harmony."&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Like dramatic art, music is recreated at every performance, and criticism may therefore be directed both at the text (musical score) and the performance. More specifically, as music has a temporal dimension that requires repetition or development of its material "problems of balance, contrast, expectation and fulfilment ... are more central to music than to other arts, supported as these are by verbal or representational content."&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of a clearly evolved or consensual musical aesthetics has also tended to make music criticism a highly subjective issue. "There is no counter-check outside the critic's own personality."&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 46-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===To end of 18th century===
Critical references to music (often deprecating performers or styles) can be found in early literature, including, for example, in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' and in the writings of medieval music theorists.

According to [[Richard Taruskin]], the active concert life of late 18th-century London meant that "the role and the function of arts criticism as we know it today were the creations of the English public."&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (2010) 571.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first magazines specifically devoted to music criticism seem to have developed in Germany, for example [[Georg Philipp Telemann]]'s ''Der getreue Music-Meister'' (1728), which included publications of new compositions, and ''Der critische Musikus'' which appeared in [[Hamburg]] between 1737 and 1740.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In France in the 1750s, the [[Querelle des Bouffons]] (the dispute between supporters of French and Italian opera styles as represented by [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] respectively) generated essays from [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and others, including [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Rameau's Nephew]]'' (1761).&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (2010), 441-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The English composer [[Charles Avison]] (1709–1770) published the first work on musical criticism in the English language - an ''Essay on Musical Expression'' published in 1752.&lt;ref&gt;Bujic (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Avison claims that since the time of [[Palestrina]] and [[Raphael]], music had improved in status whilst pictorial art had declined.&lt;ref&gt;Avison (1752), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he believes that [[George Frideric Handel]] is too much concerned with naturalistic imitation than with expression,&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 37&lt;/ref&gt; and criticises the habit, in [[Italian opera]]s, of &lt;blockquote&gt;'that egregious absurdity of repeating, and finishing many songs with the first part; when it often happens, after the passions of anger and revenge have been sufficiently expressed, that reconcilement and love are the subjects of the second, and, therefore, should conclude the performance.'&lt;ref&gt;Avison (1752), 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Typically until the late eighteenth century music criticism centred on vocal rather than instrumental music - "vocal music ... was the apex of [the] aesthetic hierarchy. One knew what music was expressing."&lt;ref&gt;Charlton (2003) 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age of Romanticism===
The last years of the eighteenth century reflected both a change of patronage of music from the aristocracy to the rising middle-classes&lt;ref&gt;Conway (2012), 11-2.&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of [[Romanticism]] in the arts. Both of these had consequences for the practice of music criticism; "the tone of the critic was lowered as his audience expanded: he began to approach the reader as a colleague rather than a pedagogue,"&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 38.&lt;/ref&gt; and a new generation of critics began to widen their consideration to other aspects of music than its pure representative aspects, becoming increasingly interested in instrumental music. Prominent amongst these was [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], who wrote in 1809&lt;blockquote&gt;That instrumental music has now risen to a level of which one probably had no inkling not long ago, and that the [[symphony]], especially following...Haydn and Mozart, has become the ultimate form of instrumental music - the ''opera'' of instruments, as it were - all this is well-known to every music-lover.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann (2003) 222-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A further impetus to the direction of music criticism was given by the changing nature of concert programming with the establishment of the European classical music canon; indeed it is at this period that the word 'classical' is first applied to a received musical tradition. At the same time, the proportion of new music to 'canonic' music in concert programming began to decline, meaning that living composers were increasingly in competition with their dead predecessors. This was particularly the case in respect of the rise of [[Beethoven]]'s reputation in his last year and posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;Conway (2012) 50-1; Weber (2001); Weber (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; This gave rise both to writings on the value of the 'canon' and also to writings by composers and their supporters defending newer music.

In 1798 the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'', edited by [[Friedrich Rochlitz]] (1769-1842), began publication in [[Leipzig]], and this is often regarded as the precursor of a new genre of criticism aimed at a wider readership than qualified connoisseurs.&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (2010) 673.&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years a number of regular journals dedicated to music criticism and reviews began to appear in major European centres, including ''[[The Harmonicon]]'' (London 1823-33), ''[[The Musical Times]]'' (London, 1844-date), the ''[[Revue et gazette musicale de Paris]]'' (Paris 1827-1880, founded by [[François-Joseph Fétis]]), the ''Berliner allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' founded in 1825 by [[Adolf Martin Schlesinger|A.M. Schlesinger]] and edited by [[Adolf Bernhard Marx|A. B. Marx]], and the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]'' founded in 1834 in Leipzig by [[Robert Schumann]] and [[Friedrich Wieck]], and later edited by [[Franz Brendel]]. Other journals at this period also began to carry extensive writings on music: [[Hector Berlioz]] wrote for the Parisian ''[[Journal des débats]]'', [[Heinrich Heine]] reported on music and literature in Paris for the Stuttgart ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', the young [[Richard Wagner]] wrote articles for [[Heinrich Laube]]'s magazine ''Zeitung für die elegante Welt'' and during his 1839-42 stay in Paris for Schlesinger's publishing house and for German newspapers. In 1835 [[James William Davison]] (1813–85) began his lifelong career as a music critic, writing 40 years for ''[[The Times]].''&lt;ref&gt;Davison (1912) v.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Science fiction]] and popular literature frequently use the term "neutronium" to refer to a highly dense phase of matter composed primarily of neutrons.

==Neutronium and neutron stars==
{{Main|Neutron star}}
Neutronium is used in popular literature to refer to the material present in the cores of neutron stars (stars which are too massive to be supported by [[electron degeneracy pressure]] and which collapse into a denser phase of matter). This term is very rarely used in scientific literature, for three reasons: there are multiple definitions for the term "neutronium";  there is considerable uncertainty over the composition of the material in the cores of neutron stars (it could be [[neutron-degenerate matter]], [[strange matter]], [[quark matter]], or a variant or combination of the above);  the properties of neutron star material should depend on depth due to changing pressure (see [[#Properties|below]]), and no sharp boundary between the crust (consisting primarily of [[atomic nuclei]]) and almost protonless inner layer is expected to exist.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

When neutron star core material is presumed to consist mostly of free neutrons, it is typically referred to as neutron-degenerate matter in scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Angelo | first1 = J. A. | date = 2006 | title = Encyclopedia of Space and Astronomy | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VUWno1sOwnUC&amp;pg=PA178 | page = 178 | publisher = [[Infobase Publishing]] | isbn = 978-0-8160-5330-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neutronium and the periodic table==
The term "neutronium" was coined in 1926 by Andreas von Antropoff for a conjectured form of matter made up of [[neutrons]] with no [[protons]] or [[electron]]s, which he placed as the [[chemical element]] of [[atomic number]] zero at the head of his new version of the [[periodic table]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} It was subsequently placed in the middle of several spiral representations of the periodic system for classifying the chemical elements, such as those of [[Charles Janet]] (1928), E. I. Emerson (1944), [[John Drury Clark|John D. Clark]] (1950) and in Philip Stewart's [[Chemical Galaxy]] (2005).

{{anchor|Isotopes}}Although the term is not used in the scientific literature either for a condensed form of matter, or as an element, there have been reports that, besides the [[free neutron]], there may exist two bound forms of neutrons without protons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Timofeyuk | first = N. K. | title = Do multineutrons exist? | date = 2003 | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | page = L9 | journal = [[Journal of Physics G]] | arxiv = nucl-th/0301020 | bibcode = 2003JPhG...29L...9T | doi = 10.1088/0954-3899/29/2/102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If neutronium were considered to be an element, then these neutron clusters could be considered to be the [[isotope]]s of that element. However, these reports have not been further substantiated.
*[[Mononeutron]]: An isolated neutron undergoes [[beta decay]] with a [[mean lifetime]] of approximately 15 [[minute]]s ([[half-life]] of approximately 10 minutes), becoming a [[proton]] (the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of [[hydrogen]]), an [[electron]] and an [[antineutrino]].
*Dineutron: The dineutron, containing two neutrons, was unambiguously observed in 2012 in the decay of beryllium-16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schirber, M. | title = Nuclei Emit Paired-up Neutrons | journal = [[Physics (American Physical Society magazine)|Physics]] | date = 2012 | volume = 5 | page = 30 | doi = 10.1103/Physics.5.30 | bibcode = 2012PhyOJ...5...30S | url = http://physics.aps.org/articles/v5/30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Spyrou, A. | display-authors = 4 | author2 = Kohley, Z. | author3 = Baumann, T. | author4 = Bazin, D. | author5 = Brown, B.

Although not called "neutronium", the National Nuclear Data Center's ''Nuclear Wallet Cards'' lists as its first "isotope" an "element" with the symbol '''n''' and atomic number ''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and mass number ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. This isotope is described as decaying to element '''[[hydrogen|H]]''' with a half life of {{val|10.24|.02|u=minutes}}.

== Properties ==
{{see also|Neutron star#Properties}}
Due to the beta (β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) decay of mononeutron and extreme instability of [[#Isotopes|aforementioned heavier "isotopes"]], neutron matter is not expected to be stable under ordinary [[pressure]]s.

Free neutrons decay with a [[half-life]] of 10 minutes and 11 seconds. While this lifetime is long enough to permit the study of neutronium's chemical properties, there are serious practical problems. Having no charge or electrons, neutronium would not interact with ordinary low-energy photons (light) and would feel no electrostatic forces, so it would diffuse into the walls of most containers made of ordinary matter. Certain materials are able to resist diffusion or absorption of [[ultracold neutrons]] due to nuclear-quantum effects, specifically reflection caused by the [[strong interaction]]. In the presence of other elements, low energy (thermal) neutrons readily undergo [[neutron capture]] to form heavier (and often radioactive) isotope of the element. Neutronium is left off most periodic tables.

Neutron matter at standard pressure and temperature is predicted by the [[ideal gas law]] to be less dense than even hydrogen, with a density of only {{val|0.045|ul=kg/m3}} (roughly 27 times less [[density of air|dense than air]]). Similar to helium, neutron matter is predicted to remain gaseous down to absolute zero at normal pressures, as the [[zero-point energy]] of the system is too high to allow condensation. However, neutron matter should in theory, form a degenerate gaseous [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] at these temperatures, composed of neutron pairs called ''dineutrons''. At higher temperatures, neutron matter will condense with sufficient pressure, and solidify with even greater pressure. Such pressures exist in neutron stars, where the extreme pressure causes the neutron matter to become degenerate. However, in the presence of atomic matter compressed to the state of [[electron-degenerate matter|electron degeneracy]], the β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay may be inhibited due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], thus making free neutrons stable. Also, elevated pressures should make neutrons [[degenerate matter|degenerate]] themselves. Compared to ordinary elements, neutronium should be more [[compressibility|compressible]] due to the absence of [[electrically charged]] protons and electrons. This makes neutronium more energetically favorable than (positive-''Z'') [[atomic nuclei]] and leads to their conversion to (degenerate) neutronium through [[electron capture]], a [[Chandrasekhar limit#Applications|process which is believed to occur]] in stellar cores in the final seconds of the lifetime of [[stellar evolution#Massive stars|massive stars]], where it is facilitated by cooling via {{subatomic particle|electron neutrino|link=yes}} emission. As a result, degenerate neutronium can have a density of {{val|4|e=17|u=kg/m{{sup|3}}}}, roughly 13 [[order of magnitude|magnitudes]] denser than the densest known ordinary substances.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} It was theorized that extreme pressures of order {{val|100|ul=MeV/fm3}} may deform the neutrons into a [[cubic honeycomb|cubic symmetry]], allowing tighter packing of neutrons,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Felipe J. Llanes-Estrada |author2=Gaspar Moreno Navarro|arxiv=1108.1859|title=Cubic neutrons |journal=[[Modern Physics Letters A]]|volume=27|issue=6|page=1250033|date=2011 |version= |doi=10.1142/S0217732312500332|bibcode = 2012MPLA...2750033L }}&lt;/ref&gt; or cause a [[strange matter]] formation.

== In fiction ==
The term ''neutronium'' has been popular in [[science fiction]] since at least the middle of the 20th century. It typically refers to an extremely dense, incredibly strong form of matter. While presumably inspired by the concept of [[Neutron degeneracy|neutron-degenerate]] matter in the cores of [[neutron star]]s, the material used in fiction bears at most only a superficial resemblance, usually depicted as an extremely strong solid under [[Earth]]-like conditions, or possessing exotic properties such as the ability to manipulate time and space. In contrast, all proposed forms of [[neutron star]] core material are [[fluid]]s and are extremely unstable at [[pressure]]s lower than that found in [[stellar core]]s. According to one analysis, a neutron star with a mass below about 0.2 [[solar mass]]es would explode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= K. Sumiyoshi |author2=S. Yamada |author3=H. Suzuki |author4= W. Hillebrandt |date=1998 |title= The fate of a neutron star just below the minimum mass: does it explode?  |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |volume=334 |issue= |pages=159–168 |arxiv= astro-ph/9707230 |bibcode=1998A&amp;A...334..159S |quote= Given this assumption... the minimum possible mass of a neutron star is 0.189 (solar masses) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3842">'''Polymer engineering''' is generally an [[engineering]] field that designs, analyses, or modifies polymer materials. Polymer engineering covers aspects of the [[petrochemical industry]], [[polymerization]], structure and characterization of polymers, properties of polymers, [[compounding]] and processing of polymers and description of major polymers, structure property relations and applications.

==Materials==
The basic division of polymers into [[thermoplastics]], [[elastomers]] and [[thermosets]] helps define their areas of application. The latter group of materials includes [[phenolic resin]]s, [[polyester]]s and [[epoxy resin]]s, all of which are used widely in [[composite material]]s when reinforced with stiff fibres such as [[fibreglass]] and [[aramid]]s. Since [[Cross-link|crosslinking]] stabilises the [[thermoset polymer matrix]] of these materials, they have physical properties more similar to traditional engineering materials like [[steel]]. However, their very much lower densities compared with metals makes them ideal for lightweight structures. In addition, they suffer less from [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]], so are ideal for [[safety-critical]] parts which are stressed regularly in service.

Thermoplastics have relatively low [[Young's modulus|tensile moduli]], but also have lower densities and properties such as [[transparency and translucency|transparency]] which make them ideal for [[consumer product]]s and [[medical product]]s. They include [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], [[nylon]], [[acetal resin]], [[polycarbonate]] and [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]], all of which are widely used materials.

[[Elastomer]]s are polymers which have very low moduli and show reversible extension when strained, a valuable property for vibration absorption and damping. They may either be thermoplastic (in which case they are known as [[Thermoplastic elastomer]]s) or crosslinked, as in most conventional rubber products such as [[tyres]]. Typical rubbers used conventionally include [[natural rubber]], [[nitrile rubber]], [[polychloroprene]], [[polybutadiene]], [[styrene-butadiene]] and fluorinated rubbers.

Typical uses of composites are [[monocoque]] structures for [[aerospace]] and [[automobile]]s, as well as more mundane products like [[fishing rod]]s and [[bicycle]]s. The [[stealth bomber]] was the first all-composite aircraft, but many passenger aircraft like the [[Airbus]] and the [[Boeing 787]] use an increasing proportion of composites in their fuselages, such as hydrophobic [[melamine foam]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.polytechinc.com/news/08232013-recognized-by-theboeingcompany&lt;/ref&gt; The quite different physical properties of composites gives designers a much greater freedom in shaping parts, which is why composite products often look different to conventional products. On the other hand, some products such as [[drive shaft]]s, [[helicopter]] rotor blades, and [[propeller]]s look identical to metal precursors owing to the basic functional needs of such components.

The '''principle of orthogonal design''' (abbreviated POOD) was developed by database researchers [[David McGoveran]] and [[Christopher J. Date]] in the early 1990s, and first published "A New Database Design Principle" in the July 1994 issue of Database Programming and Design and reprinted several times. It is the second of the two principles of [[database design]], which seek to prevent databases from being too complicated or redundant, the first principle being the [[principle of full normalization]] ([[POFN]]).

Simply put, it says that no two relations in a [[relational database]] should be defined in such a way that they can represent the same facts. As with [[database normalization]], POOD serves to eliminate uncontrolled storage redundancy and expressive ambiguity, especially useful for applying updates to virtual relations (e.g., [[view (database)]]). Although simple in concept, POOD is frequently misunderstood and the formal expression of POOD continues to be refined.

The principle is a restatement of the requirement that a database is a minimum cover set of the relational algebra. The relational algebra allows data duplication in the relations that are the elements of the algebra. One of the efficiency requirements of a database is that there be no data duplication. This requirement is met by the minimum cover set of the relational algebra.

'''Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego''' is a nonprofit run by the [[University of California, San Diego]]. It was founded as a company in 2001 by [[Sally Ride]], America's first woman in space, along with [[Tam O'Shaughnessy]], Karen Flammer, Terry McEntee, and Alann Lopes to inspire young people in [[science, technology, engineering, and math]] (STEM) and to promote STEM literacy.&lt;ref name="aboutus-company"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sallyridescience.com/about/|title=Sally Ride Science—About|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=change-the-equation&gt;{{cite web |url=http://changetheequation.org/commitment-to-excellence/sally-ride-science-inc|title= Change the Equation|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="temporal-dynamics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tdlc.ucsd.edu/about/about-sally-ride-science.html|title=Sally Ride Science officially joins TDLC as a corporate partner.|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sally Ride Science was relaunched at UC San Diego on October 1, 2015.&lt;ref name=kpbs-srs&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowler|first1=Matthew|title=Sally Ride Science becomes part of UC San Diego|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2015/oct/26/sally-ride-science-becomes-part-uc-san-diego/|website=[[KPBS Public Media|KPBS]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based at UC San Diego Extension, and its programs are coordinated jointly by UC San Diego Extension, [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], and [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piercey|first1=Judy|last2=Davies|first2=Jennifer|title=Sally Ride Science launches at UC San Diego|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/sally_ride_science_launches_at_uc_san_diego|website=UCSD News|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Shaughnessy is executive director and Flammer is director of education for Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego.

Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego focuses on professional development for teachers; K-12 STEM + Arts (STEAM) education, including courses, lectures, and camps; and online programs through UCTV.&lt;ref name=kpbs-srs /&gt; The goal is to help educators build students’ STEM literacy and make connections between what students are learning and the STEM fields that are expected to experience rapid job growth in the coming decades. The nonprofit will create new programs and make use of existing Sally Ride Science programs.

Existing programs include ''Cool Careers in STEM'', which provides professional development for teachers and classroom resources (student books, teacher guides, and a STEM Career Connections Teacher Activity Guide) to awaken students’ interest in STEM topics and careers. Research shows that learning about STEM careers and the diverse people working in these fields inspires students and makes the study of science, technology, engineering, and math more meaningful to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Practice Guides: Encouraging Girls in Math and Science|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncer/pubs/practiceguides/20072003.asp|website=National Center for Education Research|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major existing program is ''Key Concepts in Science''. This integrated standards-based program provides professional development for educators on how to teach science using the [[5E instructional model]], along with classroom resources (student books, hands-on investigations, teacher guides, and assessments) that educators can use to build students’ STEM literacy and college and career readiness. The program reflects research showing that teaching fewer science concepts in greater depth gives students a solid foundation to develop STEM literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Next Generation Science Standards|url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards|website=[[Next Generation Science Standards]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tree swallowing lamp post.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Secondary growth thickens the [[Plant stem|stem]] and [[root]]s, typically making them [[wood]]y. Obstructions such as this metal post and stubs of limbs can be engulfed.]]

In [[botany]], '''secondary growth''' is the growth that results from [[cell division]] in the [[cambium (botany)|cambia]] or lateral [[meristems]] and that causes the [[Plant stem|stem]]s and [[root]]s to thicken, while '''primary growth''' is growth that occurs as a result of cell division at the tips of stems and roots, causing them to elongate, and gives rise to primary tissue. Secondary growth occurs in most [[seed plant]]s, but [[monocots]] usually lack secondary growth. If they do have secondary growth, it differs from the typical pattern of other seed plants.

The formation of secondary vascular tissues from the cambium is a characteristic feature of [[Dicotyledon|dicotyledons]] and [[Gymnosperm|gymnosperms]]. In certain monocots, the vascular tissues are also increased after the primary growth is completed but the cambium of these plants is of a different nature. In the living Pteridophytes this feature is rare but occurs in plants like ''[[Isoetes]]'' and ''[[Botrychium]]''.

==Lateral meristems==
[[File:Tree secondary growth diagram.jpg|thumb|Diagram of secondary growth in a [[tree]] showing idealised vertical and horizontal sections. New [[wood]] is added in each growth season by the lateral meristems, the [[cork cambium]] and [[vascular cambium]].]]

In many [[vascular plants]], secondary growth is the result of the activity of the two lateral meristems, the [[cork cambium]] and [[vascular cambium]]. Arising from ''lateral'' meristems, secondary growth increases the girth of the plant root or stem, rather than its length.  As long as the lateral meristems continue to produce new cells, the stem or root will continue to grow in diameter. In [[woody plant]]s, this process produces [[wood]], and shapes the plant into a [[tree]] with a thickened trunk.

Because this growth usually ruptures the [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] of the stem or roots, plants with secondary growth usually also develop a [[cork cambium]]. The cork cambium gives rise to [[cork (tissue)|thickened cork cells]] to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss. If this is kept up over many years, this process may produce a layer of cork. In the case of the [[cork oak]] it will yield harvestable [[cork (material)|cork]].

==In nonwoody plants==

Secondary growth also occurs in many nonwoody plants, e.g. [[tomato]],&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, N.P. and Heimsch, C. 1964. Stem anatomy and aspects of development in tomato. ''American Journal of Botany'' 51: 7-19. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2440057]&lt;/ref&gt; [[potato]] [[tuber]], [[carrot]] [[taproot]] and [[sweet potato]] [[tuberous root]]. A few long-lived leaves also have secondary growth.&lt;ref&gt;Ewers, F.W. 1982. Secondary growth in needle leaves of ''Pinus longaeva'' (bristlecone pine) and other conifers: Quantitative data. ''American Journal of Botany'' 69: 1552-1559. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2442909]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abnormal secondary growth==
[[File:Monocot Stem.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arecaceae|Palms]] (in the picture ''[[Roystonea regia]]'' palm) increase their trunk diameter by means of division and enlargement of parenchyma tissue, without a real secondary growth (production of secondary vascular strands—secondary xylem and phloem tissues—with the consequent enlargement of the canopy and root system).&lt;ref name="Mauseth 2003"&gt;James D. Mauseth, 2003. ''Botany: An Introduction to Plant Biology, Third Edition.''&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Abnormal secondary growth''' does not follow the pattern of a single vascular cambium producing [[xylem]] to the inside and [[phloem]] to the outside as in ancestral lignophytes. Some [[dicot]]s have anomalous secondary growth, e.g. in [[Bougainvillea]] a series of cambia arise outside the oldest phloem.&lt;ref&gt;Esau, K. and Cheadle, V.I. 1969. Secondary growth in bougainvillea. ''Annals of Botany'' 33: 807-819. [http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/33/4/807]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancestral [[monocots]] lost their secondary growth and their stele has changed in a way it could not be recovered without major changes that are very unlikely to occur. Monocots either have no secondary growth, as is the ancestral case, or they have an "anomalous secondary growth" of some type, or, in the case of palms, they enlarge their diameter in what is called a sort of secondary growth or not depending on the definition given to the term. [[Arecaceae|Palm]] trees increase their trunk diameter due to division and enlargement of [[ground tissue#parenchyma|parenchyma]] cells, which is termed "primary gigantism"&lt;ref name="Mauseth 2003" /&gt; because there is no production of secondary xylem and phloem tissues,&lt;ref name="Mauseth 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MG Simpson (2005) "Arecaceae (Palmae)" In: ''Plant Systematics''. p.185: "...Plant sex is variable, and secondary growth is absent..."&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes "diffuse secondary growth".&lt;ref&gt;Esau, K. 1977. ''Anatomy of Seed Plants''. New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; In some other monocot stems as in ''[[Yucca]]'' and ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracena]]'' with anomalous secondary growth, a cambium forms, but it produces vascular bundles and parenchyma internally and just parenchyma externally. Some monocot stems increase in diameter due to the activity of a primary thickening meristem, which is derived from the [[anatomical terms of location#apical|apical]] meristem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Nesting biology and social structure of Euglossa (Euglossa) townsendi Cockerell (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Euglossini)|journal = Insectes Sociaux|date = 2004-11-01|issn = 0020-1812|pages = 400–409|volume = 51|issue = 4|doi = 10.1007/s00040-004-0760-2|language = en|first = S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2416">'''Social murder''' is a phrase used by [[Friedrich Engels]] in his 1845 work ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England|The Condition of the Working-Class in England]]'' whereby "the class which at present holds social and political control" (i.e. the [[bourgeoisie]]) "places hundreds of [[proletarians]] in such a position that they inevitably meet a too early and an unnatural death".&lt;ref name="Engels1845"&gt;[[Friedrich Engels|Engels, Friedrich]] (2009) [1845]. ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England|The Condition of the Working-Class in England]]''. Cosimo, Inc.

Although originally written with regard to the English city of [[Manchester]] in the [[Victorian era]], the term has controversially been used by [[left-wing]] politicians such as [[John McDonnell]] in the 21st century to describe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] economic policy, as well as events such as the [[Grenfell Tower fire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chernomas|first1=Robert|last2=Hudson|first2=Ian|title=Social murder and conservative economics|journal=Criminal Justice Matters|volume=102|issue=1|year=2015|pages=15–16|doi=10.1080/09627251.2015.1143625}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chakrabortty|first1=Aditya|title=Over 170 years after Engels, Britain is still a country that murders its poor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/20/engels-britain-murders-poor-grenfell-tower|accessdate=21 January 2018|work=The Guardian|date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Press Association|authorlink=Press Association|title=John McDonnell says Grenfell Tower disaster was 'social murder'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/16/john-mcdonnell-says-grenfell-tower-disaster-was-social-murder|accessdate=21 January 2018|work=The Guardian|date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11147">'''Social quality''' is a way of understanding society which is also relevant for social and public policy. Social quality looks at elements that should constitute a good or decent society. It contributes to the body of work concerned with understanding social progress going beyond [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], taking into account the work of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and the [[European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions]]. Whilst most approaches have concentrated on the [[happiness economics|economics]] or [[Subjective well-being|psychology of well-being]], social quality can help understanding the social conditions that enable human flourishing.&lt;ref name="social quality"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbott |first=Pamela |last2=Wallace |first2=Claire |date=2012 |title=Social Quality: A way to measure the quality of society |journal=Social Indicators Research |volume=108 |issue=1 |pages=153–167 |doi=10.1007/s11205-011-9871-0 |pmid=22773884 |pmc=3384781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Social quality.png|400px|right|Social quality diagram]]

There are four elements shown in the diagram on the right. ''Economic security'' refers to the material conditions that enable people to have a long term perspective on their lives, and their confidence for the future. This can include social policies, such as pensions and social security, that ensure this. It also includes economic conditions that enable people to feel secure because they have enough income to cover their basic needs.&lt;ref name="social quality" /&gt; ''Social cohesion'' refers to the bonds that link societies together, deriving from the work of [[Émile Durkheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durkheim |first=Émile |date=1952 |title=Suicide. A Study in Sociology |location=London |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durkheim |first=Émile |date=1952 |title=The Division of Labour in Society|location=New York |publisher=Free Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim]]'s work considers the moral and social relationships between members of society and social groups, including factors such as trust in others, trust in social institutions, a sense of identity, a collective consciousness, solidarity  and commitment to the common good of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dragolov |first=Georgi |last2=Ignácz |first2=Zsófia |last3=Lorenz |first3=Jan |last4=Delhey |first4=Jan| last5=Boehnke |first5=Klaus |date=2013 |title=Social Cohesion Radar. Measuring Common Ground. An international Comparison of Social Cohesion|location=Gutersloh |publisher=Bertelsmann }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Social inclusion'' refers to the way in which individuals and social groups are included into society, either through employment, networks and family or through access to social support of various kinds, this can come through support from other people or from social policies. Social policies that foster social inclusion, reduce poverty and tackle other forms of social exclusion can be important in this respect.&lt;ref name="social quality" /&gt; ''Social empowerment'' refers to the conditions that enable people to participate in their society, such as having good health, education and democratic opportunities for participation, such as voting and joining civil society. However, it can also mean the feelings of being empowered, being able to take control of one's circumstances. It derives from the work of [[Amartya Sen]], who suggests that people need to have the capability to be able to do the things that they wish to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sen |first=Amartya |editor-last=Nussbaum |editor-first=Martha Craven |editor-last2=Sen |editor-first2=Amartya|title=The Quality of Life |location=London|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |date=1993 |chapter=Capability and Well-being }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the social quality approach is fundamentally relational. As such, it emphasises a complex field of conditional (i), constitutional (ii) and normative factors (iii). These are (i) Socio-Economic Security, Social Cohesion, Social Inclusion, Social Empowerment; (ii) Person/human security, Social Recognition, Social Responsiveness, Personal/human Capacity; and (iii) Social Justice (Equity), Solidarity, Equal Valuation, Human Dignity. On the one hand this rejects the Durkheimian view on society as an independent social fact sui generis; on the other hand it qualifies Sen's approach as social quality is not primarily focusing on the subjective side and individuals within society but on the constitution of society by way of people producing and reproducing their daily life and with this society.

==Origins and development==
The idea of social quality began as a [[European Union]] project among a group of social scientists, concerned to develop a better way forward for social policies in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Wolfang |last2=van der Maesen |first2=Laurent |last3=Walker |first3=Alan |date=1997 |title=The Social Quality of Europe|location=The Hague |publisher=Kluwer Law International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Wolfang |last2=van der Maesen |first2=Laurent |last3=Walker |first3=Alan |last4=Thomes |first4=Fleur |date=2001 |title=Social Quality: A Vision for Europe|location=The Hague |publisher=Kluwer Law International }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |editor-last=van der Maesen |editor-first=Laurent |editor-last2=Walker |editor-first2=Alan |date=2012 |title=Social Quality. From Theory to Indicators|location=London |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the concept underwent some fundamental development. Empirically it had been developed amongst others by Pamela Abbott, [[Claire Wallace]] and Roger Sapsford, who looked at how the model can be developed empirically in Europe, [[Eastern Europe]], [[Central Asia]], China and [[Rwanda]]. They have used a different variation, considering the impact on well being, measured through [[life satisfaction]] and human flourishing in order to understand how social quality might work in fostering the well being of people in society.&lt;ref name="social quality" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Pamela| last2=Wallace| first2=Claire |editor-last=Selin|editor-first=Helaine |editor-last2=Gareth|editor-first2=Gaveth|title=Happiness across Cultures: Views of Happiness and Quality of Life in Non-Western Cultures  |location=London|publisher=Springer Verlag|date=2012 |chapter=Happiness in Post-Conflict Rwanda| pages= 361–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Pamela| last2=Wallace| first2=Claire |editor-last=Selin|editor-first=Helaine |editor-last2=Gareth|editor-first2=Gaveth|title=Happiness across Cultures: Views of Happiness and Quality of Life in Non-Western Cultures  |location=London|publisher=Springer Verlag|date=2012 |chapter=Satisfaction and Societal Quality in Kazakhstan| pages= 107–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbott |first=Pamela |last2=Wallace |first2=Claire |date=2014 |title='Rising economic prosperity and social quality. The case of new member states of the European Union |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11205-012-9992-0|journal=Social Indicators Research |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=419–439 |doi=10.1007/s11205-012-9992-0 |accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbott |first=Pamela |last2=Wallace |first2=Claire|last3=Sapsford |first3=Roger |date=2010|title='Surviving the transformation: Social quality in Central Asia and the Caucasus |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10902-010-9187-9|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=199–223  |doi=10.1007/s10902-010-9187-9 |accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This empirical work had been to a large extent emerging from the work undertaken by colleagues in Asia, in particular by Ka Lin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lin |first=Ka |last2=Herrmann |first2=Peter |date=2015 |title=Social Quality Theory. A New Perspective on Social Development|location=New York/Oxford |publisher=Berghahn}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another development is by a marked shift towards questions around 'overall sustainability'. Laurent van der Maesen is the main proponent of this strand contends. In a working paper we read that "international and national (and urban) strategies and policies for development toward 'overall' sustainability not only have to have a strong emphasis on development toward sustainability of cities themselves (internal sustainability) but also – simultaneously – address the development toward sustainability of the cities' surroundings ('Hinterland')".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=International Association of Social Quality  |date=2012 |title=The need for a Comprehensive Conceptual and Methodological Framework for new politics and policies: A social quality perspective; A contribution to the Rio+ 20 Conference on the sustainability of human existence on Earth |journal=IASQ working papers |issue=11 |pages=12 f.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more traditional line is maintained by [[Peter Herrmann (social philosopher)|Peter Herrmann]] who had been since the end of the 1990s advisor of the then European Foundation, later International Association of Social Quality. He claims that 
"[w]e have to reconceptualize ... indicators. They are not measurement instruments sui generis. Rather they are instruments to develop an understanding of complex issues and trends. As such they need to be guided by a sound conceptual reflection of what they are looking for".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herrmann |first=Peter |date=2012 |title=Economic Performance, Social Progress and Social Quality |journal=International Journal of Social Quality |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=41–55 |doi=10.3167/IJSQ.2012.020104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Herrmann is on the one hand reclaiming the methodological and theoretical importance of Social Quality thinking, at least qualifying the empirical orientation. On the other hand, though this does not contradict the orientation on sustainability, Herrmann emphasises the need to reorient debates on "the kind of economy in place" instead of maintaining dichotomies, separations and hierarchies between different areas of societal development. This had been elaborated in a book on defining social policy as matter of producing society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herrmann |first=Peter  |date=2014 |title=Social Policy – Production rather than Distribution.

'''Survival sex''' is [[prostitution]] engaged in by a person because of their extreme need. It describes the practice of people who are [[Homelessness|homeless]] or otherwise disadvantaged in society, trading sex for food, a place to sleep, or other [[basic needs]], or for [[Recreational drug use|drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flowers|first=R.

Some thinkers suggest that people are motivated to prostitute themselves because it is familiar&amp;nbsp;– specifically to victims of [[child sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name=Mallon/&gt; Other researchers state that, while some see it as a normal job, the vast majority want to get out of the industry given the potential for disease and dangerous clients.&lt;ref name=FarleyIQ/&gt;

==Prevalence==
Survival sex is common throughout the world, and has been extensively studied in many countries including the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[New Zealand]], [[Colombia]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Research on AIDS: knowledge, attitudes and practices among street youth | last=Barker | first=G. | journal=Children Worldwide:  International Catholic Child Bureau | year=1993 | volume=20 | issue=2–3 | pages=41–42 | pmid=12179310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers estimate that of [[homeless youth]] in [[North America]], one in three has engaged in survival sex. In one study of homeless youth in [[Los Angeles]], about one-third of females and half of males said they had engaged in survival sex.&lt;ref name="Flowers 2010 110–112"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flowers|first=R. Barri|title=Street kids: the lives of runaway and thrownaway teens|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-4137-2|pages=110–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likelihood increases with the number of days the youth has been homeless, experience of being victimized, engaging in criminal behaviour, using illegal substances, attempting [[suicide]], being [[pregnant]] and having an [[Sexually transmitted infection|STI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neinstein|first=Lawrence S., and Catherine Gordon, Debra Katzman and David Rosen|title=Adolescent Health Care: A Practical Guide|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-9256-1|pages=974|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&amp;linkCode=qs&amp;keywords=0781792568}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=J.M., S.T. Ennett, and C.L. Ringwalt|title=Prevalence and correlates of survival sex among runaway and homeless youth|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=89|issue=9|year=1999|pages=1406–1409|doi=10.2105/AJPH.89.9.1406|pmc=1508758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LGBT|Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender]] street children are three times likelier to engage in survival sex compared with their heterosexual counterparts, according to one study. Another found that [[transgender]] youth are most likely of all to engage in survival sex.&lt;ref name="Flowers 2010 110–112"/&gt;

Survival sex is common in [[refugee camp]]s. In [[internally displaced persons]] camps in northern [[Uganda]], where 1.4 million civilians have been displaced by conflict between Ugandan government forces and the militant [[Lord's Resistance Army]], [[Human Rights Watch]] reported in 2005 that displaced women and girls were engaging in survival sex with other camp residents, local defense personnel, and Ugandan government soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Human Rights Watch|title=The Less They Know, the Better: Abstinence Only HIV/AIDS Programs in Uganda|year=2005|publisher=Human Rights Watch|location=New York|pages=55|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jDXEynHopkgC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=survival+sex#v=onepage&amp;q=survival%20sex&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations==
Some researchers say that [[street children]] do not always see survival sex as exploitative: rather, they sometimes characterize it as the "beginning of a potential relationship." Given that one of the strongest predictors of engagement in survival sex is a prior history of [[sexual abuse]] by adult caregivers, some researchers theorize that rather than being driven to survival sex out of desperation, street children might be reproducing familiar behaviour and relationship patterns.&lt;ref name=Mallon&gt;{{cite book|last=Mallon|first=Gerald P., Peg McCartt Hess|title=Child Welfare for the Twenty-first Century: A Handbook of Practices, Policies, and Programs|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-13072-1|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers maintain that people only engage in survival sex when they have no other options. Psychologist and anti-prostitution activist [[Melissa Farley]], writing in the [[New York Times]], says that prostitution is nearly always coercive and lacking in full consent. She says this is the biggest issue, not simple inequalities between buyers and sellers, nor health and safety risks. Farley says women rarely have viable alternative means of paying for the basic needs of themselves and their loved ones. Farley argues that even having the "job option" is immoral because it will most likely hurt women who are very vulnerable (psychologically, economically, or otherwise). Farley says for women looking to survive, the experience can be [[traumatizing]], and she describes it as "Becoming objects for [[masturbation]]". She also warns that the men who pay for prostitution the most are usually the most violent towards women.&lt;ref name=FarleyIQ&gt;[http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/c-prostitution-facts.html Prostitution Research and Education: Intelligence Squared Debate on "It's wrong to pay for sex"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001155723/http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/c-prostitution-facts.html |date=2012-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Farley, research suggests that very few prostitutes (she estimates that only 5% of women) make the choice freely. She says that most women in prostitution, including those working for [[escort service]]s, have been [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused as children]]. Farley claims that a majority of prostitutes would like to leave the industry.&lt;ref name=FarleyNYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/opinion/12farley.html?em&amp;ex=1205467200&amp;en=1fedfb27c3116307&amp;ei=5087%0A |title=The myth of the victimless crime |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=2008-03-12 |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Herbert echoed a similar opinion, also in the New York Times. Herbert says "Those who think that most of the women in prostitution want to be there are deluded... the world of the prostitute is typically filled with pimps, sadists, psychopaths, drug addicts, violent criminals and disease."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/27/opinion/27herbert.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1310946059-1B1xmETcRvMXHJWoGBy82w |title=Today's hidden slave trade |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=2007-10-27 |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outreach and law enforcement==
{{globalize|date=February 2014}}
[[File:Homeless children in US 2006-10.png|thumb|Homeless children in the US grew from 1.2 million in 2007 to 1.6 million in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Bassuk, E.L., ''et al.'' (2011) [http://www.homelesschildrenamerica.org/media/NCFH_AmericaOutcast2010_web.pdf ''America’s Youngest Outcasts: 2010''] (Needham, MA: The National Center on Family Homelessness) page 20&lt;/ref&gt;]]

US municipalities such as [[Boston]] and [[Dallas]] have noticed a sharp increase in [[Runaway (dependent)|runaways]] engaging in survival sex since 1999. Dallas established a special group home for counseling, from which 75% of the underage girls who receive treatment do not return to prostitution. Congress nearly approved a program for cities to create pilot programs modeled on the Dallas system in 2007, but never appropriated the necessary funds. The Department of Justice has yet to study the number of children involved in prostitution even though they were authorized by Congress to do so in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Urbina, I. (October 26, 2009) [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/us/27runaways.html?pagewanted=all "Running in the Shadows: For Runaways, Sex Buys Survival"] ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Center for Problem Oriented Policing claims, "there is no consensus on whether the practice is widespread," and recommends that runaways should be questioned about sexual abuse but not consensual sex, survival sex, or prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Dedel, K. (2006) ''[http://www.popcenter.org/problems/runaways/ Juvenile Runaways]'' Guide No. 37 (Madison, Wisconsin: Center for Problem Oriented Policing) pp. 1 and [http://www.popcenter.org/problems/runaways/3 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[National Alliance to End Homelessness]], outreach services to help sexually exploited youth should focus on the locations where they congregate and are approached by [[pimp]]s for exploitation, including public spaces such as malls and schools, and the internet. Outreach workers need to develop a close professional relationship with law enforcement to learn about trends and locations, but should carefully avoid compromising their independence or the confidentiality of their clients. Local law enforcement should target pimps and customers (janes or johns) and not the victims (youth and young adult prostitutes) for prosecution to be effective. Partnerships between nonprofit programs and law enforcement can help offer survival sex worker victims community-based services and housing when they are picked up by police officers.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Alliance to End Homelessness]] (2009) ''[http://www.endhomelessness.org/files/2559_file_Sexual_Exploitation_of_Homeless_Youth_10_2009.pdf Homeless Youth and Sexual Exploitation: Research Findings and Practice Implications]'' (Washington, DC: endhomelessness.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[ECPAT|ECPAT International]], when sex industry women and children victims are held in police custody or remand homes, denied freedom and access to information, or abused by police, they are encouraged to lie about their situation and try to escape, so community assistance services are substantially less useful. Similar failures occur when court procedures do not allow victim testimony or representation or, when they do, are neither victim-friendly nor children-friendly; or when decisions on children's futures seldom include the opinions of children, or when the right to privacy is violated by media reporting, or by stigmatization of and discrimination against children exploited in prostitution. Governments have the duty to provide services to children, but sharing that duty with nonprofits by coordination, monitoring, and support, especially with respect to periodic review of placement, is likely to have the best results. Protection measures for children at all stages of the legal process has not been sufficiently implemented through children-friendly courts, justice systems and law enforcement agencies. Decriminalization of children exploited in prostitution is a substantial gap in addressing survival sex worldwide. Successful law enforcement partnerships have included a campaign of brothel-based prostitutes who policed the recruitment of under-age girls in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;Ennew, J.

The term '''suspension of disbelief''' or '''willing suspension of disbelief''' has been defined as a willingness to suspend one's critical faculties and believe something surreal; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite dictionary|author=&lt;!--None listed.--&gt;|date=2018|dictionary=[[Oxford Dictionaries]]|title=suspend disbelief (phrase)|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/suspend_disbelief|access-date=29 July 2018|edition=Online|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=|oclc=656668849|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729045913/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/suspend_disbelief|archive-date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who suggested that if a writer could infuse a "human interest and a semblance of truth" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. '''Cognitive estrangement''' in fiction involves using a person's ignorance to promote suspension of disbelief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Critical Theory|last=Buchanan|first=Ian|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780199532919|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "suspension of disbelief" came to be used more loosely in the later 20th century, often used to imply that the burden was on the reader, rather than the writer, to achieve it. This might be used to refer to the willingness of the audience to overlook the limitations of a medium, so that these do not interfere with the acceptance of those premises. These premises may also lend to the engagement of the mind and perhaps proposition of thoughts, ideas, art and theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= From 'King Kong' to 'Indecent Proposal,' audiences have been asked to buy a premise that can make – or break – a film|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=15 April 1993|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-04-15/entertainment/ca-23034_1_indecent-proposal|accessdate=2010-10-24|first=Robert W.|last=Welkos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspension of disbelief is often an essential element for a magic act or a circus sideshow act. For example, an audience is not expected to actually believe that a woman is [[Sawing a woman in half|cut in half]] or transforms into a gorilla&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Botos|first=Tim|title=‘Gorilla Girl' sideshow act hangs on despite changing times|url=http://www.patriotledger.com/archive/x144223716/-Gorilla-Girl-sideshow-act-hangs-on-despite-changing-times|accessdate=15 October 2012|newspaper=GateHouse News Service; Patriot Ledger|date=21 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to enjoy the performance.

According to the theory, suspension of disbelief is an essential ingredient for any kind of storytelling. With any film, the viewer has to ignore the reality that they are viewing a staged performance and temporarily accept it as their reality in order to be entertained. [[Black-and-white]] films provide an obvious early example that audiences are willing to suspend disbelief, no matter how implausible the images appear, for the sake of entertainment. With the exception of totally color blind people ([[Achromatopsia|achromats]]), no person viewing these films sees the real world without color, but some are still willing to suspend disbelief and accept the images in order to be entertained. Suspension of disbelief is also supposed to be essential for the enjoyment of many films and television shows involving complex stunts, special effects, and seemingly unrealistic plots and characterizations.

== Coleridge's original formulation ==
Coleridge coined the phrase in his ''[[Biographia Literaria]]'', published in 1817, in the context of the creation and reading of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Safire, William.  ''On Language; Suspension of Disbelief''. New York Times. 7 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter XIV describes the preparations with [[Wordsworth]] for their revolutionary collaboration ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' (first edition 1798), for which Coleridge had contributed the more romantic, gothic pieces including ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''. Poetry and fiction involving the supernatural had gone out of fashion to a large extent in the 18th century, in part due to the declining belief in witches and other supernatural agents among the educated classes, who embraced the rational approach to the world offered by the new science. [[Alexander Pope]], notably, felt the need to explain and justify his use of elemental spirits in ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', one of the few English poems of the century that invoked the supernatural. Coleridge wished to revive the use of fantastic elements in poetry. The concept of "willing suspension of disbelief" explained how a modern, enlightened audience might continue to enjoy such types of story.

Coleridge recalled:

{{quote|... It was agreed, that my endeavours should be directed to persons and characters supernatural, or at least romantic, yet so as to transfer from our inward nature a human interest and a semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith. Mr. Wordsworth on the other hand was to propose to himself as his object, to give the charm of novelty to things of every day, and to excite a feeling analogous to the supernatural, by awakening the mind's attention from the lethargy of custom, and directing it to the loveliness and the wonders of the world before us ...&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Biographia Literaria, 1817, Chapter XIV&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The notion of such an action by an audience was however recognized in antiquity, as seen particularly in the Roman theoretical concerns of Horace, who also lived in an age of increasing skepticism about the supernatural, in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (with the quotation ''[[Ut pictura poesis]]'').

== Examples in literature ==
{{See also|Dramatic convention}}
Suspension of disbelief is sometimes said to be an essential component of live theater, where it was recognized by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], who refers to it in the Prologue to ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'':

{{quote|[…] make imaginary puissance […] 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings […] turning the accomplishment of many years into an hourglass.}}

== Psychology ==
Psychological critic Norman Holland points to a neuroscientific explanation.  When we hear or watch any narrative, our brains go wholly into perceiving mode, turning off the systems for acting or planning to act, and with them go our systems for assessing reality. We have, in Coleridge's second, more accurate phrase, "poetic faith". That's why humans have such trouble recognizing lies: they first believe, then have to make a conscious effort to disbelieve.

Only when we stop perceiving to think about what we have seen or heard, only then do we assess its truth-value. If we are really "into" the fiction – "transported", in the psychologists' term – we are, as Immanuel Kant pointed out long ago, "disinterested". We respond aesthetically, without purpose.  We don't judge the truth of what we're perceiving, even though if we stop being transported and think about it, we know quite well it's a fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holland|first1=Norman|title=Spiderman? Sure! The Neuroscience of Disbelief|journal=Interdisciplinary Science Reviews|date=2008|volume=33|issue=4|pages=312–320|url=https://www.researchgate.net/researcher/2003369909_Norman_Holland|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holland|first1=Norman|title=Literature and the Brain|url=http://www.literatureandthebrain.com|website=Literatureandthebrain.com|publisher=PsyArt|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspension of disbelief has also been used within a mental health context by Frank DeFulgentis in his book ''Flux''. It is an attempt to describe the phenomenon of forgetting irrational thoughts associated with cases of [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]]. In the book, the author suggests 'suspending disbelief' as opposed to forcing ourselves to forget; similar to how one would put a virus in quarantine. We can thereby allow ourselves to be absorbed in the activities around us until these irrationalities vanish on their own accord.

== Criticisms ==

[[Aesthetics|Aesthetic philosophers]] generally reject claims that suspension of disbelief accurately characterizes the relationship between people and "fictions." [[Kendall Walton]] notes that, if viewers were to truly suspend disbelief at a horror movie and accept its images as absolute fact, they would have a true-to-life set of reactions. For instance, audience members would cry out, "Look behind you!" to an endangered on-screen character or call the police when they witnessed an on-screen murder.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2025831 Fearing Fictions]", Kendall L. Walton, [[JSTOR]] (''[[Journal of Philosophy|The Journal of Philosophy]]'', Vol. 75, No. 1 (01-1978), pp. 5–27). Retrieved 3 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many of these criticisms simply fail to notice that Coleridge's original statement came in a restrictive clause. The formulation "...that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment which constitutes poetic faith," of necessity implies that there are different sorts of suspension of disbelief and specifies that poetic faith is one instance of a larger class. One need not choose to believe that a character in a horror film is a real person in order, for example, to choose to believe that the character is looking at the building seen in the following reverse-shot.{{or|date=August 2018}}

Not all authors believe that suspension of the disbelief adequately characterizes the audience's relationship to imaginative works of art. [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] challenges this concept in his essay "[[On Fairy-Stories]]", choosing instead the paradigm of secondary belief based on inner [[consistency]] of reality. Tolkien says that, in order for the narrative to work, the reader must believe that what he reads is true within the secondary reality of the fictional world. By focusing on creating an [[Fictional universe#Definition|internally consistent fictional world]], the author makes secondary belief possible. Tolkien argues that suspension of disbelief is only necessary when the work has failed to create secondary belief. From that point the spell is broken, and the reader ceases to be immersed in the story and must make a conscious effort to suspend disbelief or else give up on it entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, J. R. R. “On Fairy-Stories.” The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays, George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1983, pp. 109–61.

'''TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)''' is education and training which provides knowledge and skills for employment.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-UNEVOC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=What+is+TVET|title=What is TVET?|date=28 August 2017|website=UNESCO-UNEVOC|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; TVET uses [[Formal learning|formal]], [[Nonformal learning|non-formal]] and [[informal learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/skills-work-and-life|title=Skills for work and life|last=|first=|date=|website=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|archiveurl=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; TVET is recognised to be a crucial vehicle for [[social equity]], inclusion and sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233030e.pdf|title=Unleashing the Potential: Transforming Technical and Vocational Education and Training|last=Marope|first=P.T.M.|last2=Chakroun|first2=B.|last3=Holmes|first3=K.P.|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100091-1|pages=9-10, 41, 43, 47-48, 56-58, 63, 80, 95, 98-103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of the term TVET ==
The term 'Technical and Vocational Education and Training' or TVET was officiated at the World Congress on TVET in 1999 in [[Seoul|Seoul, Republic of Korea]]. The congress recognised the term TVET to be broad enough to incorporate other terms that had been used to describe similar educational and training activities including Workforce Education (WE), and Technical-Vocational Education (TVE). The term TVET parallels other types of education and training e.g [[Vocational education|Vocational Education]] but is also used as an umbrella term to encompass education and training activities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=What+is+TVET|title=What is TVET?|last=UNESCO-UNEVOC|first=|date=|website=www.unevoc.unesco.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision in 1999 to officiate the term TVET led to the development of the [[UNESCO-UNEVOC]] International Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training in [[Bonn, Germany]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Hybridisation ==
Because of TVET′s isolation with other education streams it was not widely adopted, in particularly in secondary education. Steps were taken to reduce segmentation of education and training and to address institutional barriers that restricted TVET learners′ options including choices to move vertically to higher levels of learning, or horizontally to other streams.

Policy-makers have introduced forms of hybridization with other education systems, additionally some of the distinctions between TVET and ′academic′ education streams have been blurred.&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, R. and Pavlova, M. 2011. Vocationalisation of secondary and higher education: pathways to the world of work. UNESCO-UNEVOC, ''Revisiting Global Trends in TVET: Reflections on Theory and Practice''. Bonn, Germany, UNESCO-UNEVOC International Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training, pp. 40–85.&lt;/ref&gt; This hybridisation has been termed the ′vocationalization of secondary education′, a similar process has happened to a lesser extent in tertiary education.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== France and the Netherlands ===
The [[Baccalauréat|baccalauréat professionnel]] in [[France]], and the [[Education in the Netherlands|middelbaar beroepsonderwijs]] (MBO) ount of work experience in the area they are specializing in.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Germany and Austria ===
Apprenticeships enhanced content within occupational training courses and considerable emphasis has been placed on personal skills.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== India ===
Work education has been included in the primary standards (grades 1–8) to make the students aware of work. At the lower secondary level (grades 9–10) pre-vocational education has been included with the aim to increase students’ familiarity with the world of work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Republic of Korea ===
Around 40% of secondary students are currently enrolled in TVET education, in some schools, academic and vocational students share almost 75% of the curriculum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Russian Federation ===
A new approach to vocationalization of secondary schooling has been introduced within the framework of general educational reform. This has been guided by the Ministry of Education’s strategy of modernization. Vocationalization in the Russian Federation refers to the introduction of profile education at the upper-secondary level (the last two years of schooling, grades 10 and 11) and the process of preparation for profile selection. Profile education provided students with the opportunity to study a chosen area in depth, usually one that would be related to their further study (TVET or academic). Schools could design their own profiles, e.g science, socio-economics, humanities, and technology, or keep a general orientation curriculum. In preparation for the upper-secondary specialization, a ′pre-profiling′ programme in grade 9 has been introduced to help students make their choices in grade 10.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== United States of America ===
Tech-prep programmes in the [[United States|United States of America]] are examples of how the ′blending′ approach was used to help students make the connections between school and work. In year nine, programmes in broad occupational fields such as the health professions, [[Automotive tecnology|automotive technology]], computer systems networking are offered within general technology studies. The programmes continue for at least two years after the end of secondary school, through a tertiary education or an apprenticeship programme, with students achieving an associate degree or certificate by the end of the programme.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Private sector ==
Private TVET providers include [[for-profit]] and [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] institutions. Several factors triggered actions to support the expansion of private TVET including the limited capacities of public TVET providers and their low responsiveness to enterprises and trainees. Private TVET providers were expected to be more responsive because they were subject to fewer bureaucratic restrictions than public institutions (particularly in centralized systems). Their presence was expected to help raise quality system-wide, in many developing countries, government budgets constituted a vulnerable and unreliable source of financing for TVET, an important objective was to finance TVET systems by increasing the contribution of beneficiaries, including employers and trainees.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Private TVET provision over since 2005 has become a significant and growing part of TVET in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, R. K. and Adams, A. V. 2004. ''Skills Development in Sub-Saharan Africa''. Washington, DC, World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;ETF and World Bank. 2005. ''Reforming Technical Vocational Education and Training in the Middle East and North Africa: Experiences and Challenges''. Luxembourg, Office for Official Publications of the European Communities.&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, e.g [[Lebanon]], enrolments in private TVET institutions have exceeded enrolments in public institutions. In [[Jordan]], private provision at the community college level has been promoted by the government.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However not all experiences has been positive with private proprietary institutions or [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], their courses have often been concentrated in professional areas that typically do not require large capital investment, permitting easy entry and exit by private providers from the sector. Quality issues have also emerged, where market information about quality has been unavailable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Technological advancement and its impact==
TVET has an important role to play in technology diffusion through transfer of knowledge and skills. Rapid technological progress has had and continues to have significant implications for TVET. Understanding and anticipating changes has become crucial for designing responsive TVET systems and, more broadly, effective skills policies. The flexibility to adapt the supply of skills to the rapidly, and in some cases radically, changing needs in sectors such as [[information technology]] and the [[green economy]] has become a central feature of TVET systems. Globally, the skills requirements and qualifications demanded for job entry are rising. This reflects a need for not just a more knowledgeable and skilled workforce, but one that can adapt quickly to new emerging technologies in a cycle of continuous learning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

TVET courses have been created to respond to the diverse [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] needs of learners, whether these are related to work, education or citizenship. New courses have been introduced to address occupational changes in the ICT job market, while many TVET providers have shifted provision towards a blended approach, with significantly more self-directed and/or [[Distance education|distance learning]]. In developed countries, new ICT approaches have been introduced to modernize TVET organizations and to manage administration and finance, including learner records.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Education for all ==
{{main|Education For All}}

The Education for All (EFA) movement has had its own implications for TVET at both international and national levels. The third EFA goal lacked precision and measurable targets for TVET, however it called for ensuring ′that the learning needs of all young people and adults are met through equitable access to appropriate learning and life-skills programmes′.&lt;ref&gt;World Conference on Education for All. 2000. ''The Dakar Framework for Action: Meeting our Collective Commitments to Education for All''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; This goal had a symbolic value, helping to raise the visibility of TVET and skills development and create a more prominent place for them on the global education policy agenda. The current bulge of young people requiring TVET learning opportunities is partly fuelled by the success of the EFA movement in opening access to [[basic education]], particularly at the primary level. In 2009, 702 million children were enrolled worldwide in primary education, compared with 646 million in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Institute for Statistics. 2006. ''Participation in Formal Technical and Vocational Education and Training Programmes Worldwide: An Initial Statistical Study''. Bonn. UNESCO-UNEVOC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Continuing TVET ==
Continuing TVET involves ongoing training to upgrade existing skills and to develop new ones and has a much higher profile in ageing societies and knowledge-based economies. Increased recognition of the importance of human capital for economic growth and social development made it necessary to increase learning opportunities for adults in workplaces within the wider context of policies and strategies for lifelong learning.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. 2005. ''Promoting Adult Learning, Education and Training Policy''. Paris, OECD Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In many countries policy-makers have considered ways to expand workplace learning opportunities for workers and to assess and give credit for knowledge and skills acquired in workplaces. Efforts were geared towards training for workers in companies, encouraged by legislation, financial incentives and contractual agreements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Challenges ==
=== Labour market demands and trends ===
Following the [[Global financial crisis in 2009|global financial crisis in 2008]], labour markets across the world experienced structural changes that influenced the demand for skills and TVET. [[Unemployment]] worsened and the quality of jobs decreased, especially for [[youth]]. Gender differentials in labour force participation placed men ahead of women, and skill mismatches deepened. The crisis impacted labour markets adversely and led to deepening uncertainty, vulnerability of employment, and inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Bacchetta, M. and Jansen, M. (eds). 2011. ''Making Globalisation Socially Sustainable''. Geneva, ILO and WTO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, measures to improve efficiency and profitability in the economic recovery have often led to [[jobless recovery|jobless growth]], as happened in [[Algeria]], [[India]] and [[post-apartheid South Africa]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In seeking to address the level of vulnerable employment, TVET systems have focused on increasing the employability of graduates and enhancing their capacity to function effectively within existing vulnerable labour markets and to adjust to other labour market constraints. This has meant enhanced coordination among government departments responsible for TVET and employment policies. It has also created the need for TVET systems to develop mechanisms that identify skills needs early on and make better use of labour market information for matching skills demands and supply. TVET systems have focused more on developing immediate job skills and wider competencies. This has been accomplished by adopting competency-based approaches to instruction and workplace learning that enable learners to handle vulnerable employment, adjust to changing jobs and career contexts, and build their capacity to learn and agility to adapt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Migration flows ===
Increasing migration are significant challenges to the national character of TVET systems and qualifications. TVET qualifications are progressively expected not only to serve as proxies for an individual's competencies but to also act as a form of a currency that signals national and international value.&lt;ref&gt;Leney, T. 2009a. ''Qualifications that Count: Strengthening the Recognition of Qualifications in the Mediterranean Region''. Thematic Study. Turin, Italy, ETF. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.etf.europa.eu/web&lt;/nowiki&gt;. nsf/(RSS)/C125782B0048D6F6C125768200396FB6?OpenDocument&amp;LAN=EN&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; TVET systems have been developing mechanisms to enable credible and fair cross-border recognition of skills. In 2007, the [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] identified three types of recognition that TVET system may use: unilateral (independent assessment by the receiving country), mutual (agreements between sending and receiving countries), and multilateral (mostly between a regional grouping of countries). The most prevalent of these is unilateral recognition, which is mostly under the control of national credential evaluation agencies. Countries have been slow to move from input-based skill evaluations to outcome-based methodologies that focus on competencies attained.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Keevy, J. 2011. ''The recognition of qualifications across borders: the contribution of regional qualifications frameworks''. Background paper commissioned by UNESCO. Pretoria, South African Qualifications Authority.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

TVET systems are responding to migration by providing qualifications that can stand the rigour of these recognition systems and by creating frameworks for mutual recognition of qualifications. Regional Qualifications Frameworks such as those in [[Southern Africa]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[Caribbean]] aim to significantly support the recognition of qualifications across borders.&lt;ref&gt;Keevy, J., Chakroun, B. and Deij, A. 2010. ''Transnational Qualifications Frameworks''. Luxembourg, Publications Office of the European Union.&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts are further supported through the introduction of outcome-based learning methodologies within the broader context of multilateral recognition agreements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Providing broader competencies alongside specialist skills===
Skills for economic development include a mix of technical and [[soft skills]]. Empirical evidence and TVET policy reviews conducted by [[UNESCO]] suggest that TVET systems may not as yet sufficiently support the development of the so-called soft competencies.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2013b. ''Policy Review of TVET in Cambodia''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; images/0022/002253/225360e.pdf#xml=&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?database=&amp;set=53761B39_2_350&amp;hits_rec=2&amp;hits_lng=eng&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2013c. ''Policy Review of TVET in Lao PDR''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; images/0022/002211/221146e.pdf#xml=&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?datab&lt;/nowiki&gt; ase=&amp;set=53761918_0_231&amp;hits_rec=2&amp;hits_lng=eng&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2013d. ''Revue de politiques de formation technique et professionnelle au Benin''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002213/221304f.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries have, however, adopted competency-based approaches as measures for reforming TVET curricula.

The [[HEART Trust National Training Agency]] of [[Jamaica]] adopted this approach, with a particular emphasis on competency standards and balanced job-specific and generic skills. Competency standards aimed to ensure that the training was linked to industry and was up to date, and that competences were integrated into training programmes, along with the needed knowledge, skills and attitudes. The balancing of skill types was to ensure adequate attention was given to job-specific skills as well as the conceptual and experiential knowledge necessary to enable individuals to grow and develop in the workplace, and more generally in society.&lt;ref&gt;HEART Trust NTA. 2009. ''Policy on competency-based education and training''. Draft Concept Paper. Kingston, HEART Trust NTA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Globalization ===
Globalization of the economy and the consequent reorganization of the workplace require a more adaptable labour force, requiring countries to rethink the nature and role of TVET. Globalization intensifies pressure on the TVET sector to supply the necessary skills to workers involved in globalized activity and to adapt existing skills to rapidly changing needs. As a consequence, there is an increasing requirement for more demand-driven TVET systems with a greater focus on modular and competency-based programmes, as well as on cognitive and transferable skills, which are expected to help people adapt to unpredictable conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Promoting social equity and inclusive workplaces ===
Preparing marginalized groups of youths and adults with the right skills and helping them make the transition from school to work is part of the problem faced by TVET in promoting social equity. Ensuring that the workplace is inclusive poses numerous policy challenges, depending on the contextual dynamics of inclusion and exclusion, and the capabilities of individuals. For example, the experiences of exclusion by people with [[Disability|disabilities]] and disadvantaged women may be similar in some ways and different in others. Many individuals experience multiple forms of disadvantage in the workplace, to different degrees of severity, depending on social attitudes and traditions in a specific context or organization. Approaches to inclusiveness in the workplace will therefore vary according to population needs, social diversity and context. To give one example, the Netherlands set about the task of making workplaces more inclusive for low-skilled adults by offering programmes that combine language instruction with work, and in certain cases on-the-job training.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. 2012. ''Better Skills Better Jobs Better Lives – OECD: A Strategic Approach to Skills Policies''. Paris, OECD Publishing. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/better-skills-better-jobs-&lt;/nowiki&gt; better-lives_9789264177338-en&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A review of employer surveys in [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States|United States of America]], reported that employers valued people with disabilities for their high levels of motivation and their diverse perspectives, and found their attendance records to be the same or better than those of other employees.&lt;ref&gt;Employers’ Forum on Disability. 2009. What does the research say are the commercial bene ts? &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.realising-potential.org/six-building-blocks/commercial/what-researchers-&lt;/nowiki&gt; say.html&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Many employers mentioned that being seen as pro-inclusion was positive for the company or organization's image, an advantage that goes well beyond&amp;nbsp;providing employment opportunities to disadvantaged groups. In many cases, however, social and cultural perceptions are an obstacle to making workplaces more inclusive, and this will require sensitive and concerted attention. Some low- and middle-income countries have sought to address this through legislation. In [[Tanzania]] the [[Disabled Persons (Employment) Act of 1982]] established a quota system that stipulates that 2 per cent of the workforce in companies with over fifty employees must be persons with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;SADC and UNESCO. 2011. ''Final Report: Status of TVET in the SADC Region''. Gaborone, SADC, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The 2012 [[Education for All Global Monitoring Report]] concluded that 'all countries, regardless of income level, need to pay greater attention to the needs of young people who face disadvantage in education and skills development by virtue of their poverty, gender or other characteristics'.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;UNESCO. 2012. ''Youth and Skills: Putting Education to Work''. EFA Global Monitoring Report. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002180/218003e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The report found that several barriers and constraints reduced the success of TVET in meeting social equity demands. First, national TVET policies in most cases failed to address the skills needs of young people living in urban poverty and in deprived rural areas. Second, additional funds were needed to support TVET learning opportunities on a much larger scale. Third, the training needs of disadvantaged young women were particularly neglected. The 2012 EFA Global Monitoring Report also noted that skills training alone was not sufficient for the most disadvantaged of the rural and urban poor.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Coherent policies that link social protection, micro-finance and TVET are considered critical for ensuring better outcomes for marginalized groups.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Gender disparities ===
Recent years have seen rising numbers of young women enrolling in TVET programmes, especially in service sector subjects. At times the challenge is to bring more males into female-dominated streams. However, beyond number games, the real gender parity test that TVET systems are yet to pass is balancing the gender participation in programmes that lead to employability, as well as to decent and high-paying jobs. Gender disparities in learning opportunities, and earnings, are a cause for concern. The persistent gender-typing of TVET requires concerted attention if TVET is to really serve a key facilitative role in shared growth, [[social equity]] and [[inclusive development]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233030e.pdf|title=Unleashing the Potential: Transforming Technical and Vocational Education and Training|last=Marope|first=P.T.M|last2=Chakroun|first2=B.|last3=Holmes|first3=K.P.|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100091-1|location=|pages=20, 53, 85, 163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of work, poor quality of work, lack of voice at work, continued gender discrimination and unacceptably high youth unemployment are all major drivers of TVET system reforms from the perspective of social equity. This is an area where TVET systems continue to be challenged to contribute proactively to the shaping of more equitable societies.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Gender equality has received significant international attention in recent years, and this has been reflected in a reduction in gender participation gaps in both [[Primary education|primary]] and [[Secondary education|secondary schooling]]. Efforts to analyse and address gender equality in TVET are relevant to other aspects of equity and dimensions of inclusion/exclusion. In almost all parts of the world, the proportion of girls to total enrolment in secondary education defined as TVET is less than for 'general' secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Institute for Statistics. 2012.

==== Responses ====

===== Bangladesh =====
Integrating women or men into areas of specialization in which they were previously under-represented is important to diversifying opportunities for TVET. The [[National Strategy for Promotion of Gender Equality in TVET]] in [[Bangladesh]] set clear priorities and targets for breaking gender stereotypes. The Strategy developed by a Gender Working Group comprising  fifteen representatives from government ministries and departments, employers, workers and civil society organizations. It provided an overview of the current status and nature of gender inequalities in TVET, highlighted the priority areas for action, explored a number of steps to promote equal participation of women in TVET, and outlined the way forward.&lt;ref&gt;ILO. 2012b. ''Draft National Strategy for Promotion of Gender Equality in TVET''. Dhaka, ILO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/---ilo-dhaka/&lt;/nowiki&gt; documents/publication/wcms_222688.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===== Cambodia =====
In [[Cambodia]], TVET programmes set out to empower young women in traditional trades by upgrading their skills and technology in [[silk weaving]]. This led to the revitalization and reappraisal of a traditional craft by learners and society.&lt;ref&gt;Salzano, E. 2005. ''Technology-Based Training for Marginalised Girls''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===== The Shanghai Consensus of the Third International Congress on TVET =====
The Shanghai Consensus of the Third International Congress on TVET made the following recommendations on expanding access and improving quality and equity, including to:&amp;nbsp;

"Improve [[gender equality]] by promoting equal access of females and males to TVET programmes, particularly in fields where there is strong labour market demand, and by ensuring that TVET curricula and materials avoid stereotyping by gender."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2012.

'''''The Pervert's Guide to Ideology''''' is a 2012 British [[documentary film]] directed by [[Sophie Fiennes]] and written and presented by Slovene [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[psychanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Slavoj Žižek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pervert’s Guide to Ideology: Toronto Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/perverts-guide-ideology-toronto-review-368821|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a sequel to Fiennes's 2006 documentary ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Cinema]]''. Though the film follows the frameworks of its predecessor, this time the emphasis is on [[ideology]] itself. Through [[psychoanalysis]] Žižek explores "the mechanisms that shape what we believe and how we behave".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pervert's Guide to Cinema's Fiennes and Žižek Reteam for ''Pervert's Guide to Ideology''|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/perverts_guide_to_cinemas_fiennes_and_zizek_reteam_for_perverts_guide_to_id|publisher=indiewire.com|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the films that are explored are ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' and ''[[Taxi Driver]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leigh|first=Danny|title=Slavoj Žižek: Blofeld rides again|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/16/slavoj-zizek-perverts-guide-ideology|accessdate=29 September 2012|newspaper=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in the [[United States]] by [[Zeitgeist Films]] in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perverts Uprising!

==Synopsis==
Žižek appears transplanted into the scenes of various movies, exploring and exposing how they reinforce prevailing ideologies.

==Reception==
"Though its ideas are indeed heady and high-flown, they are presented in a way that's consistently engaging and accessible. And the bearded, bulky, Slovenia-born Žižek comes across as a born raconteur and explainer, the kind of professor whose courses are deservedly his department's most popular. You don't have to share his materialist philosophy to find his analyses of culture and movies witty, insightful and usefully thought-provoking."
—Godfrey Cheshire, [[RogerEbert.com]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheshire|first=Godfrey|title=''The Pervert's Guide to Ideology''|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-perverts-guide-to-ideology-2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"What remains? You will get a lot of answers to questions you never knew you had."

"Intellectual rock star Slavoj Žižek dishes out another action-packed lesson in film history and Marxist dialectics with ''The Pervert’s Guide to Ideology'', a riveting and often hilarious demonstration of the Slovenian philosopher’s uncanny ability to turn movies inside out and accepted notions on their head."
—Jordan Mintzer, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mintzer|first=Jordan|title=''The Pervert's Guide to Ideology'': Toronto Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/perverts-guide-ideology-toronto-review-368821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Žižek’s romp through pop culture feels like a strange dream, with a mad professor re-enacting our favourite movie moments through the eyes of a therapist. ''The Pervert’s Guide to Ideology'' is invigorating, zany, completely memorable and often hilarious. Žižek goes from praising Coca-Cola to analyzing what the shark attacks really mean in ''Jaws''."

[[Image:Malta 16 Mnajdra.jpg|thumb| Trilithon entrance, [[Mnajdra]] temple, [[Malta]]]]

A '''trilithon''' (or ''trilith'') is a structure consisting of two large vertical stones (posts) supporting a third stone set horizontally across the top (lintel). It is commonly used in the context of [[megalithic]] monuments. The most famous trilithons are those of [[Stonehenge]] in [[England]], those found in the [[Megalithic Temples of Malta|Megalithic temples]] of [[Malta]], both of which are [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s, and the [[Osireion]] in Egypt.

The word ''trilithon'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "having three stones" (''τρι-/tri-'' 'three' + ''λίθος/lithos'' 'stone') and was first used by [[William Stukeley]].

The term also describes the groups of three stones in the [[Hunebed]] tombs of the [[Netherlands]] and the three massive stones forming part of the wall of the Roman Temple of Jupiter at [[Baalbek]], [[Lebanon]]. Far from [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], another famous trilithon is the [[Ha'amonga 'a Maui|Haʻamonga ʻa Maui]] in [[Tonga]], [[Polynesia]].
__NOTOC__
== Baalbek ==
[[File:Trilithon of Baalbek 3.jpg|thumb|The 3 blocks known as trilithon in Temple of Jupiter Baal ("Heliopolitan Zeus") in Baalbek, Lebanon.]]
A group of three horizontally lying giant stones, which form part of the podium of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Temple of Jupiter (Roman Heliopolis)|Jupiter temple]] of [[Baalbek]], [[Lebanon]], are called a "Trilithon", although they do not fit the above definition. The location of the megalithic structures is atop of a hill in the region, known as Tel Baalbek. Numerous archaeological expeditions have gone to the site starting in the 19th century, primarily German and French groups, and research continued into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://gilgamesh42.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/moving-the-stones-of-baalbek-the-wonders-of-roman-engineering/|title = Moving the Stones of Baalbek–The Wonders of Roman Engineering|last = Adair|first = Aaron|website = Fleeing Nergal, Seeking Stars|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each one of these stones is 19 metres long, 4.2 metres high, 3.6 metres thick and weighs around 800 tonnes.  The supporting stone layer beneath features a number of stones which weigh an estimated 350 tonnes and are 11 metres wide.&lt;ref name="Adam 1977, 52"&gt;{{harvnb|Adam|1977|p = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[quarry]] nearby, [[Stone of the Pregnant Woman|two Roman building blocks]], which were intended for the same podium, surpass 1,000 tonnes.

'''Truth to materials''' is a tenet of [[modern architecture]] (as opposed to [[postmodern architecture]]), which holds that any material should be used where it is most appropriate and its nature should not be hidden. Concrete, therefore, should not be painted and the means of its construction should be celebrated &amp;ndash; by, for instance, not sanding away marks left by timber shuttering (''[[béton brut]]'').  As another example, [[porcelain]] is infrequently used in the exterior facing of buildings, but one modern example is the [[Dakin Building]], [[Brisbane, California]]; therefore, the porcelain panels of this building have been left uncovered by any paint or preservative.

'''Victory gardens''', also called '''war gardens''' or '''food gardens for defense''', were vegetable, fruit, and [[herb]] gardens planted at private residences and public parks in  the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/a-brief-guide-to-german-garden-colonies/a-39133787|title=A brief guide to German garden colonies {{!}} DW {{!}} 30.05.2018|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityfarmer.org/germanAllot.html|title=German Allotment Gardens|website=www.cityfarmer.org|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. [[George Washington Carver]] wrote an agricultural tract and promoted the idea of what he called a "Victory Garden". They were used along with [[Ration Stamps|Rationing Stamps and Cards]] to reduce pressure on the public food supply. Besides indirectly aiding the [[war effort]], these gardens were also considered a [[Civilian|civil]] "[[morale]] booster" in that gardeners could feel empowered by their contribution of labor and rewarded by the produce grown. This made victory gardens a part of daily life on the home front.

[[File:War gardeners 1918 (edited).jpg|thumb|Two American war gardeners in 1918]]

==World War I==

===Canada===
Victory Gardens became popular in Canada in 1917. Under the Ministry of Agriculture's campaign, "A Vegetable Garden for Every Home", residents of cities, towns and villages utilized backyard spaces to plant vegetables for personal use and war effort. In the city of [[Toronto]], ladies organizations brought expert gardeners into the schools to get school children and their families interested in gardening. In addition to gardening, home owners were encouraged to keep hens in their yards for the purpose of collecting eggs. The result was large production of potatoes, beets, cabbage and other useful vegetables.&lt;ref name=Ontario&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hopkins|first1=John Castell|title=The Province of Ontario in the War: A Record of Government and People|date=1919|publisher=Warwick Brothers and Rutter|location=Toronto|pages=60–61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0gzAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=hon+h.w.+richardson+ontario&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P4_7KzQzJA&amp;sig=B7KplcNhume7OcoULM5jQPwDz0o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yI1GVZ7oGoilgwTa5IGIAw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hon%20h.w.%20richardson%20ontario&amp;f=false|ref=Province of Ontario During War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[Image:Sow victory poster usgovt.gif|thumb|left|upright|WWI-era U.S. victory poster featuring [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] sewing seeds.]]
In March 1917, [[Charles Lathrop Pack]] organized the US National War Garden Commission and launched the war garden campaign. Food production had fallen dramatically during [[World War I]], especially in Europe, where agricultural labor had been recruited into military service and remaining farms devastated by the conflict.  Pack and others conceived the idea that the supply of food could be greatly increased without the use of land and manpower already engaged in agriculture, and without the significant use of transportation facilities needed for the war effort.  The campaign promoted the cultivation of available private and public lands, resulting in over five million gardens in the USA&lt;ref&gt;Pack, Charles Lathrop.  ''War Gardens Victorious''  (Philadelphia:  J. B. Lippincott, 1919) p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  and foodstuff production exceeding $1.2 billion by the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Eyle, Alexandra.  ''Charles Lathrop Pack:  Timberman, Forest Conservationist, and Pioneer in Forest Education''  (Syracuse, NY:  Syracuse University Press, 1994)  p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Woodrow Wilson]] said that "Food will win the war." To support the home garden effort, a United States School Garden Army was launched through the Bureau of Education, and funded by the War Department at Wilson's direction.&lt;ref&gt;Hayden-Smith, Rose: Sowing the Seeds of Victory (Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==

===Australia===
[[Australia]] launched a Dig for Victory campaign in 1942 as rationing and a shortage of agricultural workers began to affect food supplies. The situation began to ease in 1943; however, home gardens continued throughout the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/homefront/victory_gardens/|title=Victory gardens, Second World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
In Britain, "digging for victory" used much land such as waste ground, railway edges, ornamental gardens and lawns, while sports fields and golf courses were requisitioned for farming or vegetable growing. Sometimes a sports field was left as it was but used for sheep-grazing instead of being mown (for example see {{section link|Lawrence Sheriff School|Effects of the Second World War}}). By 1943, the number of [[Allotment (gardening)|allotments]] had roughly doubled to 1,400,000, including rural, urban and suburban plots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=x2GUDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=landscape%20and%20englishness&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Landscape and Englishness: Second Expanded Edition|last=Matless|first=David|date=2016-09-15|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2016|isbn=9781780237145|location=London|pages=246|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. H. Middleton]]'s radio programme ''In Your Garden'' reached millions of listeners keen for advice on growing potatoes, leeks and the like, and helped ensure a communal sense of contributing to the war effort (as well as a practical response to food rationing).&lt;ref&gt;A. Harris, ''Romantic Moderns'' (London 2010) p. 240-1&lt;/ref&gt; [[County Herb Committees]] were established to collect medicinal herbs when German blockades created shortages, for instance in ''[[Digitalis purpurea]]'' (Foxglove) which was used to regulate heartbeat. Victory gardens were planted in backyards and on apartment-building rooftops, with the occasional vacant lot "commandeered for the war effort!" and put to use as a cornfield or a squash patch. During World War II, sections of lawn were publicly plowed for plots in [[Hyde Park, London]] to promote the movement, while allotments growing onions in the shadow of the [[Albert Memorial]] also pointed to everybody, high and low, chipping in to the national struggle.&lt;ref&gt;A. Harris, ''Romantic Moderns'' (London 2010) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;  Both [[Buckingham Palace]] and [[Windsor Castle]] had vegetable gardens planted at the instigation of [[King George VI]] to assist with food production.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jun/14/queen-allotment-organic-gardening&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Amid regular [[food rationing|rationing]] of food in Britain, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]  encouraged the planting of victory gardens during the course of World War II. Around one third of the vegetables produced by the United States came from victory gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kallen|first=Stuart A.|title=The War at Home|date=2000|publisher=Lucent Books|location=San Diego|isbn=1-56006-531-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was emphasized to American home front urbanites and suburbanites that the produce from their gardens would help to lower the price of vegetables needed by the [[United States Department of War|US War Department]] to feed the troops, thus saving money that could be spent elsewhere on the military: "Our food is fighting," one US poster read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2004678605/?sid=1dda880c2a44a5d081d03cbfceee1a52 |title=Where our men are fighting, our food is fighting |publisher=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 1943, there were 18 million victory gardens in the United States - 12 million in cities and 6 million on farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=18,000,000 Gardens for Victory|publisher=Popular Mechanics|date=May 1943|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleanor Roosevelt planted a Victory Garden on the white house lawn in 1943. The Roosevelts were not the first presidency to institute a garden in the white house. Woodrow Wilson grazed sheep on the south lawn during World War I to avoid mowing the lawn. Eleanor Roosevelt’s garden instead served as a political message of the patriotic duty to garden, even though Eleanor did not tend to her own garden. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/859687116|title=Cultivating victory : the Women's Land Army and the Victory Garden movement|last=Cecilia,|first=Gowdy-Wygant,|date=2013|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=9780822944256|location=Pittsburgh|oclc=859687116}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Victory Gardens were portrayed as a patriotic duty, 54% of Americans polled said they grew gardens for economic reasons while only 20% mentioned patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38168249|title=Eating for victory : food rationing and the politics of domesticity|last=1962-|first=Bentley, Amy,|date=1998|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=0252067274|location=Urbana|oclc=38168249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although at first the Department of Agriculture objected to [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]'s institution of a victory garden on the [[White House]] grounds, fearing that such a movement would hurt the food industry, basic information about gardening appeared in public services booklets distributed by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], as well as by [[agribusiness]] corporations such as [[International Harvester]] and [[Beech-Nut]]. Fruit and vegetables harvested in these home and community plots was estimated to be {{convert|9000000|-|10000000|ST}} in 1944, an amount equal to all commercial production of fresh vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe40s/crops_02.html|title=Victory Gardens during World War II|work=livinghistoryfarm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/80400530/pdf/hist/bhnhe_1944_misc_pub_550.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Victory Garden movement also attempted to unite the Home-front. Local communities would have festivals and competitions to showcase the produce each person grew in their own gardens. While the garden movement united some local communities, the garden movement separated minorities like African Americans. At harvest shows, separate prizes were awarded to “colored people”, in similar categories, a long-held tradition in Delaware and the deeper South, as well as in Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38168249|title=Eating for victory : food rationing and the politics of domesticity|last=1962-|first=Bentley, Amy,|date=1998|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=0252067274|location=Urbana|oclc=38168249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New York City]], the lawns around vacant [[Riverside (house)|"Riverside"]] were devoted to victory gardens, as were portions of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco's]] [[Golden Gate Park]]. The slogan "grow your own, can your own", was a slogan that started at the time of the war and referred to families growing and canning their own food in victory gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World war II: Civic responsibility|url=http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/lesson_plans/civic_responsibility/smithsonian_siyc_fall07.pdf|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar==
In 1946, with the war over, many British residents did not plant victory gardens, in expectation of greater availability of food. However, shortages remained in the United Kingdom, and rationing remained in place for at least some food items until 1954.

Land at the centre of the [[Conservation areas in Sutton, London#The Sutton Garden Suburb Conservation Area|Sutton Garden Suburb]] in [[Sutton, London]] was first put to use as a victory garden during World War II; before then it had been used as a recreation ground with tennis courts. The land continued to be used as allotments by local residents for more than 50 years until they were evicted by the then landowner in 1997. The land has since fallen into disuse.&lt;ref name="Appraisal"&gt;[https://www.sutton.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/1828/character_appraisal_-_document.pdf Sutton Garden Suburb Conservation Area Character Appraisal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009000722/https://www.sutton.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/1828/character_appraisal_-_document.pdf |date=2016-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fenway Victory Gardens in the [[Back Bay Fens]] of [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and the Dowling Community Garden in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] remain active as the last surviving public examples from World War II. Most plots in the Fenway Victory Gardens now feature flowers instead of vegetables while the Dowling Community Garden retains its focus on vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dowlingcommunitygarden.org/pages/history.htm|title=Dowling Community Garden History|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the turn of the 21st century, interest in victory gardens has grown. A campaign promoting such gardens has  sprung up in the form of new victory gardens in public spaces, victory garden websites and blogs, as well as petitions to renew a national campaign for the victory garden and to encourage the re-establishment of a victory garden on the White House lawn. In March 2009, [[First Lady]] [[Michelle Obama]] planted an {{convert|1100|sqft|m2|adj=on}} "[[Kitchen Garden]]" on the White House lawn, the first since Eleanor Roosevelt's, to raise awareness about healthy food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Marian|last=Burrows|date=March 19, 2009|title=Obamas to Plant Vegetable Garden at White House|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/dining/20garden.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Films ==
Several countries produced numerous information films about growing victory gardens.

'''Von Baer's laws of embryology''' (or '''laws of development''') are four rules discovered by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] to explain the observed pattern of [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]] in different species.&lt;ref name=abz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abzhanov|first1=Arhat|title=von Baer's law for the ages: lost and found principles of developmental evolution |journal=Trends in Genetics|date=2013|volume=29|issue=12|pages=712–722|doi=10.1016/j.tig.2013.09.004|pmid=24120296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Baer formulated the laws in the book ''Über Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere'' ("''On the Developmental History of Animals''"), published in 1828, while working at the [[University of Königsberg]]. He specifically intended to rebut [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]]'s 1808 [[recapitulation theory]]. According to that theory, embryos pass through successive stages that represent the adult forms of less complex organisms in the course of development, and that ultimately reflects ''scala naturae'' (the [[great chain of being]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Opitz |first1=John M. |last2=Schultka |first2=Rüdiger |last3=Göbbel |first3=Luminita |title=Meckel on developmental pathology |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A |date=2006 |volume=140A |issue=2 |pages=115–128 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.31043}}&lt;/ref&gt; von Baer believed that such linear development is impossible. He posited that instead of linear progression, embryos started from one or a few basic forms that are similar in different animals, and then developed in a branching pattern into increasingly different organisms. Defending his ideas, he was also opposed to [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 theory of [[Natural selection|common ancestry and descent with modification]], and particularly to [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s revised recapitulation theory with its slogan "[[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garstang |first1=Walter |authorlink=Walter Garstang |title=The Theory of Recapitulation: A Critical Re-statement of the Biogenetic Law |journal=Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Zoology |date=1922|volume=35 |issue=232 |pages=81–101 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1922.tb00464.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lovtrup |first1=Soren |title=On von Baerian and Haeckelian Recapitulation |journal=Systematic Zoology |date=1978 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=348 |doi=10.2307/2412887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The laws==

Von Baer's laws are a series of statements generally summarised into four points. As translated by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in his ''Scientific Memoirs'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huxley |first1=Thomas Henry |authorlink=Thomas Huxley |editor1-last=Henfrey |editor1-first=Arthur |title=Scientific memoirs, selected from the transactions of foreign academies of science, and from foreign journals. Natural history |year=1853 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |doi=10.5962/bhl.title.28029 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/70597#page/186/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The more general characters of a large group appear earlier in the embryo than the more special characters.
# From the most general forms the less general are developed, and so on, until finally the most special arises.
# Every embryo of a given animal form, instead of passing through the other forms, rather becomes separated from them.
# The embryo of a higher form never resembles any other form, but only its embryo.

==Description==

Von Baer discovered the [[blastula]] (the early hollow ball stage of an embryo) and the development of the [[notochord]] (the stiffening rod along the back of all [[chordate]]s, that forms after the blastula and [[gastrula]] stages). From his observations of these stages in different vertebrates, he realised that [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]]'s [[recapitulation theory]] must be wrong. For example, he noticed that the [[yolk sac]] is found in [[bird]]s, but not in [[frog]]s. According to the recapitulation theory, such structures should invariably be present in frogs because they were assumed to be at a lower level in the evolutionary tree. Von Baer concluded that while structures like the notochord are recapitulated during embryogenesis, whole organisms are not.&lt;ref name="matthen"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Matthen |first1=Mohan |last2=Stephens |first2=Christopher |title=Philosophy of Biology |date=2007 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-0-080-47124-2 |pages=444–445 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=bVww2ZPO258C&amp;pg}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserted that (as translated):

{{quote|The embryo successively adds the organs that characterize the animal classes in the ascending scale. When the human embryo, for instance, is but a simple vesicle, it is an infusorian; when it has gained a liver, it is a mussel; with the appearance of the osseous system, it enters the class of fishes; and so forth, until it becomes a mammal and then a human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ospovat |first1=D. |title=The influence of Karl Ernst von Baer's embryology, 1828–1859: A reappraisal in light of Richard Owen's and William B. Carpenter's "Palaeontological application of 'von Baer's law'" |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |year=1976 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1–28 |doi=10.1007/BF00129171}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In terms of taxonomic hierarchy, according to von Baer, characters in the embryo are formed in top-to-bottom sequence, first from those of the largest and oldest taxon, the [[phylum]], then in turn class, order, family, genus, and finally species.&lt;ref name="matthen"/&gt;

==Reception==

The laws received a mixed appreciation. While they were criticised in detail, they formed the foundation of modern [[embryology]].&lt;ref name=abz/&gt; The British zoologist [[Adam Sedgwick (zoologist)|Adam Sedgwick]] studied the developing embryos of [[Squalus|dogfish]] and [[chicken]], and in 1894 noted a series of differences, such as the green yolk in the dogfish and yellow yolk in the chicken, absence of embryonic rim in chick embryos, absence of [[blastopore]] in dogfish, and differences in the gill slits and gill clefts. He concluded:

{{quote|There is no stage of development in which the unaided eye would fail to distinguish between them with ease... A blind man could distinguish between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sedgwick |first1=Adam |authorlink=Adam Sedgwick (zoologist) |title=Memoirs: On the Law of Development commonly known as von Baer's Law; and on the Significance of Ancestral Rudiments in Embryonic Development |journal=Journal of Cell Science |date=1894 |volume=s2-36 |pages=35–52 |url=http://jcs.biologists.org/content/s2-36/141/35}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The most important supporter of von Baer's laws was Charles Darwin, who wrote in his ''[[Origin of Species]]'':

{{quote|[The] adult [animal] differs from its embryo, owing to variations supervening at a not early age, and being inherited at a corresponding age. This process, whilst it leaves the embryo almost unaltered, continually adds, in the course of successive generations, more and more difference to the adult. Thus the embryo comes to be left as a sort of picture, preserved by nature, of the ancient and less modified condition of each animal. This view may be true, and yet it may never be capable of full proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin |title=On the Origin of Species |date=1859 |publisher=John Murray|location=London |page=338 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Darwin took up the concept of common descent which formed part of his theory of evolution. But von Baer was a vociferous anti-Darwinist, devoting much of his scholarly effort to criticising Darwinism. His criticism culminated with his last work ''Über Darwins Lehre'' ("''On Darwin's Doctrine''"), published in the year of his death in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vucinich |first1=Alexander |title=Darwin in Russian Thought |date=1988 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=0-52-006283-3 |page=93 |url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft5290063h&amp;chunk.id=d0e2212&amp;toc.id=d0e2205&amp;brand=ucpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3274">'''ʿIlm al-ḥurūf''' ({{lang-ar|عِلْم الْحُرُوف}}) or '''the science of letters''' is an Arabic [[Esotericism|esoteric]] science or magic practice concerned with occult properties assigned to the letters of the [[Arabic alphabet]], and the words and names formed from those letters.

Using these properties of letters, ʿilm al-ḥurūf then sought to combine letters based on these magical properties to form words to achieve a desired magical or divinatory effect. It also sought to use these properties to analyze significant names and words, such as the [[Names of God in Islam|99 names of God]], to reveal and understand divine secrets.

== Etymology ==
ʿIlm al-Ḥurūf is composed of the two words ''ʿilm'' ({{lang-ar|عِلْم}}) meaning "science", and ''ḥurūf'' ({{lang-ar|حُرُوف}}), the plural of the word ''ḥarf'' ({{lang-ar|حَرْف}}), meaning "letters".
