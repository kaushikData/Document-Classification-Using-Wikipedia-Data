'''Alfred L. Jenkins''' was an American diplomat, lecturer and author, born September 14, 1916 in [[Manchester, Georgia|Manchester]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name ="Emory"&gt;Alfred Lesesne Jenkins papers 1951–1980, Emory University Archives #681&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New Georgia"&gt;Author Unknown, Cities and Counties:Baxley, ''The New Georgia Encyclopedia'',&lt;/ref&gt; He was a political authority on Chinese-American relations and served under Presidents [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]].  Jenkins has been called "Mr. China" &lt;ref name="Mark Meng"/&gt; and participated in Sino-American relations for more than twenty years.&lt;ref name="Kissenger"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Jenkins graduated from Emory University in 1938 and Duke University with an M.Ed. in 1976.&lt;ref name ="Emory"/&gt; He was also a student at the [[University of Chicago]]'s National War College&lt;ref name ="Emory"/&gt; and attended the National College of Chiropractic in 1986.&lt;ref name ="Country Conscience and Caviar"/&gt;

==Career==
He served in the American Foreign Service from 1946 to 1974 before becoming a freelance writer.&lt;ref name ="Emory"/&gt; Jenkins served in China from 1946 to 1955. He was a member of the [[U.S. National Security Council]] from 1966 to 1969.&lt;ref name ="Emory"/&gt; Jenkins was the senior inspector of the [[U.S. State Department]] Foreign Service and a member of the National Security Council senior staff of President Lyndon B. Johnson.&lt;ref name="Mark Meng"&gt;Meng, Mark (1994) Reed Business Information, St. John’s University Library&lt;/ref&gt; He often submitted memos directly to the President&lt;ref&gt;Bogle, Lori, (2001) Routledge, ''National Security Policy Planning from Truman to Reagan'', Page 262&lt;/ref&gt;  and was, at times, critical of current American policy towards China which was focused on trade, travel and U.N. representation rather than its possible involvement in the Asia–Pacific region (including Vietnam).&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, J. Garr and Wilson, Theodore A. (2007) ''Presidents, Diplomats, and Other Mortals'', page 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Nixon administration he was the director of the State Department's Office of Asian Communist Affairs.&lt;ref name="New Georgia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Szulc, Tad (Feb 17, 1972) [https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0217.html#article President Leaves on Trip to China; Stops in Hawaii], ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewine, Francis (Mar 23, 1973) Kissenger’s  Team Talented/Versatile,  ''Spokane Daily Chronicle''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 he traveled to Paris to exchange information with the French and British concerning affairs with China.&lt;ref&gt;Platt, Nicholas (2009) ''China Boys: How U. S. Relations with the Prc Began and Grew: A Personal Memoir''&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled with [[Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] on an unpublicized diplomatic mission to China in October 1971.&lt;ref name="Kissenger"&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB70/doc21.pdf  Kissenger's  Second Visit to China] Source: ''Xin zhongguo waijiao fengyun'', vol. 3, pp. 59-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins advised Kissinger and President Nixon on all Chinese diplomatic relations &lt;ref name=Goldberg&gt;{{Cite book|last=Goldberg|first=Philip|year=2010|title=American Veda—How Indian Spirituality Changed the West|pages=163–165|publisher=Crown Publishing/Random House|location= New York|isbn=978-0-385-52134-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was instrumental in planning the U.S.’s Chinese missions.&lt;ref&gt;Daly, Dick (Nov 12, 1974) [http://archive.mprnews.org/stories/19741112/american-diplomat-china-alfred-jenkins-discusses-politics-china American diplomat to China, Alfred Jenkins, discusses politics in China] ''MPR Archive''&lt;/ref&gt; His insights into Chinese-American relations gave him a key role in Nixon’s historical diplomatic mission and visit to China in February 1972.&lt;ref name="Mark Meng"/&gt;   Jenkins was considered Kissinger's "right-hand man"  and had final responsibility for drafting the secret "Talking Papers", which served as a guide for U.S. negotiations with China.&lt;ref name="Mark Meng"/&gt;

In 1972 Jenkins was a speaker at a symposium held at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and hosted by [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]. He was given the Superior Service Award by the U.S. State Department in 1973.&lt;ref name ="Emory"/&gt; Jenkins was the chief liaison officer in [[Peking]], China, from 1973 to 1974 before becoming a professional lecturer and writer.&lt;ref name ="Emory"/&gt; In 1975 he appeared on the [[NBC]] TV show ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|Tomorrow]]'' and channel [[KSCI]] in Los Angeles, California, to discuss [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]].&lt;ref name ="Emory"/&gt; He served as chairman of the board of trustees of [[Maharishi International University]] for three years.&lt;ref&gt;Dilley, John R. (December 10, 1975). "TM Comes to the Heartland of the Midwest". ''The Christian Century''. pp. 1129–1132.&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring from the Foreign Service, due to the influence of Joseph Janse, D.C., N.D., a well-known and revered figure in natural medicine and longtime President of National College of Chiropractic (now National University of Health Sciences) in Lombard, IL, in 1981 Jenkins began his studies toward a Doctorate of Chiropractic and graduated shortly before his 70th birthday. He practiced natural medicine as a primary care physician in Gleneden Beach, Oregon for a number of years, but retired when his wife Martha died. Jenkins returned to Alexandria, VA where he lived out his final years.

In 1993 Jenkins published an autobiography called ''Country, Conscience and Caviar: A Diplomat's Journey in the Company of History''.&lt;ref name ="Country Conscience and Caviar"&gt;Unknown Author, [https://www.amazon.com/Country-Conscience-Caviar-Diplomats-Journey/dp/0962226947 ''Country, Conscience and Caviar: A Diplomat's Journey in the Company of History''] ''Amazon''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Angel''''' is an American television series, a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from the television series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. The series was created by ''Buffy''{{'}}s creator, [[Joss Whedon]], in collaboration with [[David Greenwalt]]. It aired on [[The WB]] from October 5, 1999, to May 19, 2004, consisting of five seasons and 110 episodes. Like ''Buffy'', it was produced by Whedon's production company, [[Mutant Enemy Productions|Mutant Enemy]].

The show details the ongoing trials of [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]], a vampire whose human soul was restored to him by gypsies as a punishment for the murder of one of their own.  After more than a century of murder and the torture of innocents, Angel's restored soul torments him with guilt and remorse. Angel moves to Los Angeles, California, after it's clear that his doomed relationship with Buffy, the vampire slayer, cannot continue. During the first four seasons of the show, he works as a private detective in L.A, where he and a variety of associates work to "help the helpless", restoring the faith and saving the souls of those who have lost their way.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;In episode "[[Darla (Angel episode)|Darla]]", Cordelia says: "Angel Investigations, we help the hopeless."&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, this involves doing battle with evil demons or humans allied to them, primarily related to [[Wolfram &amp; Hart]], a law firm supported by occult practices which is an extension of otherworldly demonic forces, which Angel takes over in the final season.  He must also battle his own demonic nature.

===Characters===
{{Main article|List of Angel characters|List of minor Angel characters|List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings|Angel Investigations}}
[[File:Angel cast (Angel casefiles).jpg|thumb|250px|The principal ''Angel'' actors portraying their characters, from left to right: [[Charles Gunn (Angel)|Gunn]], [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia]], [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]], [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce|Wesley]] and [[Winifred Burkle|Fred]]]]
The series focuses around [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] ([[David Boreanaz]]), an Irish vampire who is over 200 years old. Angel was known as Angelus during his rampages across Europe, but was cursed with a soul, which gave him a conscience and guilt for centuries of murder and torture. He left ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' at the end of Season 3 to move to Los Angeles in search of redemption.

He soon finds himself assisted by [[Allen Francis Doyle]] ([[Glenn Quinn]]), another Irish character who is a half-human, half-demon who, although he comes across as a ne'er-do-well hustler, has a heroic side. Doyle serves to pass along the cryptic visions from The Powers That Be to Angel. They're soon joined by [[Cordelia Chase]] ([[Charisma Carpenter]]), also a previous cast member of ''Buffy''. Formerly a popular high school cheerleader, Cordelia starts her tenure on the show as a vapid and shallow personality, but grows over the course of the series into a hero. Cordelia acquires Doyle's visions via a shared kiss prior to Doyle's death. With the death of Doyle in the early episodes of the show's first season, another character from the ''Buffy'' series makes the jump to its spin-off: [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]] ([[Alexis Denisof]]) joins the team under the brave guise of "rogue demon hunter", acting as comic relief and initially not well-accepted. Over time, Wesley shows bravery and strength, as well as some cold blooded killing cruelty, like his colleague [[Rupert Giles]], and grows into a leader.

In Season 2 of the show, the trio are joined by [[Charles Gunn (Angel)|Charles Gunn]] ([[J. August Richards]]), a young demon hunter who must initially adjust to working with and for a vampire. At the end of Season 2, they travel to the demon world Pylea, where they save [[Winifred Burkle|Winifred "Fred" Burkle]] ([[Amy Acker]]), a young Texan physicist whose social skills have become stunted after five years' captivity; she later grows to become more outspoken. Season 3 saw the introduction of [[Connor (Angel)|Connor]] ([[Vincent Kartheiser]]), the "miracle" human child of two vampires, Angel and [[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]]. Abducted into a Hell dimension as a baby, he is raised by Angel's enemy [[Daniel Holtz]], and only a few weeks after he left comes back as a teenager and reluctantly comes to accept his lineage. Although introduced during Season 2, [[Lorne (Angel)|Lorne]] ([[Andy Hallett]]) joins the team during Season 4. An outgoing, pacifistic demon, Lorne's role is predominantly to support the team.

Season 5, the show's final season, introduces several new cast members, chief amongst them [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] ([[James Marsters]]), an old vampire ally/foe of Angel's who also starred in ''Buffy''. In this series, Spike reluctantly fights beside Angel as their rivalry continues – now tinged with Spike existing as another vampire with a soul, and by the romantic feelings that both of them have for Buffy Summers. One of the legendary [[Old Ones (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Old Ones]], [[Illyria (Angel)|Illyria]] (Amy Acker) starts off as an adversary of the team after taking over Fred's body, but comes to join the team as she must learn to cope with the changed world and the new emotions she feels as a result of taking over a human. Finally, there's [[Harmony Kendall]] ([[Mercedes McNab]]), another ''Buffy'' alumna and former friend of Cordelia who was turned into a vampire. Resembling the old personality of Cordelia, Harmony is grudgingly accepted by Angel as his secretary when he takes over the Los Angeles branch of Wolfram &amp; Hart.

Many characters on ''Angel'' made recurring appearances. The two longest-running recurring characters are Lilah Morgan (Seasons 1–4) and [[Lindsey McDonald]] (Seasons 1, 2 and 5), appearing in 36 and 21 episodes, respectively; Lindsey is the only character besides Angel to appear in both the first and last episode of the series. Angel's sire [[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]] ([[Julie Benz]]), first seen in ''Buffy'', plays in an expanded role on ''Angel'' and appears in 20 episodes over the course of the series. [[Elisabeth Röhm]] appears in 15 episodes (Seasons 1–2) as LAPD Detective [[Kate Lockley]], a woman with an often-strained relationship with Angel.

Throughout the series, there were also guest appearances from [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters|''Buffy'' characters]], including main cast members [[Buffy Summers]], [[Willow Rosenberg]] and [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel "Oz" Osbourne]]. The rogue slayer [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] played an important part in episodes of Seasons 1, 2, and 4; [[Anne Steele (Buffyverse)|Anne Steele]] and [[Andrew Wells]] also originated on ''Buffy'' and appeared in two or more ''Angel'' episodes. Whedon also used two actors from his cancelled television series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', [[Gina Torres]] and [[Adam Baldwin]], to play [[Jasmine (Angel)|Jasmine]] and [[Marcus Hamilton (Angel)|Marcus Hamilton]], respectively.

===Setting and filming locations===
{{Main article|Hyperion Hotel}}
Much of ''Angel'' was shot on location in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref name="INSERT NAME"&gt;Various authors, "[http://www.restlessbtvs.com/trivia/category/behind-the-scenes/sets-and-locations/ Sets and Locations]", ''The Ultimate Buffy and Angel Trivia Guide'' (updated 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  The show is set in the city of Los Angeles.  "Los Angeles" are the first words spoken in the premiere episode,&lt;ref&gt;Episode, "City of", ''Angel'' (1999).  Angel says: "Los Angeles.  You see it at night and it shines.  Like a beacon.  People are drawn to it.  People and other things.  They come for all sorts of reasons."&lt;/ref&gt; and the cityscape is the first image seen in the opening credits.  Joss Whedon said, "It is set in Los Angeles because there are a lot of demons in L.A. and a wealth of stories to be told."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;  Producer [[Marti Noxon]] has expanded on this explanation: "Los Angeles was the place that Joss Whedon picked for very specific reasons.  There's a lot of preconceptions about what the place is, but there are a lot of truths.  It's a pretty competitive, intense town, where a lot of lonely, isolated, and desperate people end up.  It's a good place for monsters."&lt;ref&gt;Topping, Keith, ''[[List of Buffyverse guidebooks#"Hollywood Vampire"|Hollywood Vampire]]'', (3rd edition, includes Season 4) ''Virgin Books'' (2004), page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many episodes feature references to the city, and the opening episode of the second season features Lorne offering this observation of the city:

{{quote|In this city, you better learn to get along.  Because L.A.'s got it all: the glamour and the grit, the big breaks and the heartaches, the sweet young lovers and the nasty, ugly, hairy fiends that suck out your brain through your face.  It's all part of the big wacky variety show we call ''Los Angeles''.}}

In the essay, "Los Angeles: The City of Angel" (from the essay collection, ''[[Reading Angel: The TV Spin-off With a Soul]]''), Benjamin Jacob explores why Los Angeles in particular should be important to the series.  Jacob suggests several explanations: first, the name connection ('City of Angels'); second, the double-sided nature, the "other side of the stereotypical sunshine city, Beach Boys and Walt Disney", "the place of pain, anonymity, alienation and broken dreams".;&lt;ref name="jacob"&gt;Jacob, Benjamin, "Los Angelus: The City of Angel", from Abbot, Stacey (editor), ''[[Reading Angel: The TV Spin-off With a Soul|Reading Angel]]'', ''I. B. Tauris'' (September 22, 2005), page 77&lt;/ref&gt; third, American noir was originally a "Los Angelian genre".&lt;ref name="jacob80"&gt;Jacob, Benjamin, "Los Angelus: The City of Angel", from Abbot, Stacey (editor), ''Reading Angel'', ''I. B. Tauris'' (September 22, 2005), page 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Angel'' was originally conceived as supernatural noir.  Noir had continued investigation of the "dark city, a place of regression and darkness as a counterpoint to the city's promise of progress and civilization" that had begun under [[William Blake]] and [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref name="jacob83"&gt;Jacob, Benjamin, "Los Angelus: The City of Angel", from Abbot, Stacey (editor), ''Reading Angel'', ''I. B. Tauris'' (September 22, 2005), page 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

During Season One, [[Angel Investigations]] is based in Angel's apartment.  Actor [[Alexis Denisof]], who played [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]], said: "Angel had this dark, foreboding, underground cellar apartment with columns, with this antique furniture all around, and this pokey little office upstairs"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;""Inside the Agency" featurette ''[[Angel DVDs#Season 2|''Angel'' Season 2 DVD set]]'', disc 3 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  These offices were blown up at the climax of the first season, and Angel Investigations found a new base in the episode "[[Are You Now or Have You Ever Been]]".

Production designer Stuart Blatt outlined the new base: "An old hotel, something [the writers] could use to evoke the past of Los Angeles and some of Angel's history, something kind of creepy and spooky but not too dark because they didn't want something depressing, it's called the [[Hyperion Hotel]].  It's based on many hotels in Los Angeles... Angel lived in a larger suite in the hotel, like a honeymoon suite, the producers wanted Angel to have enough room to relax and get away from it all, do a little pondering, a little brooding, and a little research.  Every once in a while, someone will come up to have a little conversation."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;  In the final season, the team moves to the evil law firm, [[Wolfram &amp; Hart]].

===Format===
Much like ''Buffy'', ''Angel'' is told in a [[Serial (radio and television)|serialized]] format, with each episode involving a self-contained story while contributing to a larger storyline. Unlike ''Buffy'', however, the season-long narratives are not marked by the rise and defeat of a powerful [[antagonist]], commonly referred to as the "[[Big Bad]]" in the parent series. Instead, the overarching story of all five seasons of the series pitted Angel as the central player in a battle between the "good" [[The Powers That Be (Angel)|Powers That Be]] and the "evil" law firm [[Wolfram &amp; Hart]] and his possible role in a prophesied apocalypse. It mixes the complex, series-long storyline along with more stand-alone, [[Villain of the week|villain-of-the-week]] episodes. The show blends different genres, including horror, fantasy, supernatural, and a combination of comedic and dramatic content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tv/angel/EP00317395 |title=Angel |publisher=Zap2it |accessdate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/9479/angel-season-three/ |title=Angel - Season Three |publisher=DVD Talk |author=Tyner, Adam |date=February 11, 2004 |accessdate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/01/angel-collectors-set |title=Angel (Collector's Set) |publisher=IGN |author=Goldman, Eric |date=October 31, 2007 |accessdate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first season is mainly told in a "[[monster of the week]]" format, with each episode creating a self-contained story that took place around the title character. Later seasons became more serialized, where the majority of episodes contribute to a larger [[story arc]] that unfolded over many episodes.  The most extreme example of this is season four, in which almost every episode contributed to the main storyline, and often picked up exactly where the previous episode ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/12183/angel-season-four/ |title=Angel - Season Four |publisher=DVD Talk |author=Tyner, Adam |date=September 5, 2004 |accessdate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series' narrative revolves around Angel and his colleagues, collectively making up the detective agency Angel Investigations, who fight against [[supernatural]] evils and work to "Help the helpless".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;  A typical episode contains one or more villains, or supernatural phenomena that is thwarted or defeated, and one or more people in need of help, a few of them Angel and associates not being able to (including some main characters) since from episode one.  Though elements and relationships are explored and ongoing subplots are included, the show focuses centrally on Angel and his road to redemption.

The most prominent monsters in the [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings|''Angel'' bestiary]] are [[vampire (Buffyverse)|vampires]], which are based on traditional myths, lore, and literary conventions.  Angel and his companions fight a wide variety of [[demon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|demons]], as well as [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Ghosts and spirits|ghosts]], [[werewolf|werewolves]], [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Undead|zombie]]s, and [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Dangerous mortals|ethically unsound humans]].  They sometimes even save the world from annihilation by a combination of physical combat, [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], and detective-style investigation, and are guided by an extensive collection of ancient and mystical reference books.  Visions from higher powers guide the group, and are received by Doyle and later Cordelia.  [[Hand-to-hand combat]] is chiefly undertaken by Angel and later Gunn, though every member of Angel Investigations is combat ready to some degree.  Lorne is able to read peoples' destinies and intentions.  [[Winifred Burkle|Fred]] uses her scientific knowledge to contribute, whilst Wesley contributes his extensive knowledge of [[demonology]] and supernatural lore.

===Storylines===
&lt;!--
THIS SECTION ATTRACTS BLOAT. PLEASE DO NOT ENLARGE IT (if anything it needs some more shrinking). ALSO KEEP IN MIND THIS SECTION NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT ANGEL. KEEP IT VERY SIMPLE! 
--&gt;

At the start of the series, Angel has just moved to Los Angeles.  He is soon visited by Doyle, a messenger sent to him on behalf of [[The Powers That Be (Angel)|The Powers That Be]].  Doyle receives visions that can guide Angel on his mission as a champion of humankind.  Angel also encounters Cordelia Chase, who is trying to launch an acting career.  The three group together to form [[Angel Investigations]], a detective agency that hopes to "help the helpless."  When Doyle dies in the episode "[[Hero (Angel)|Hero]]", he passes on his 'visions' to Cordelia with a kiss. Shortly thereafter, the ex-[[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, joins the group.  Meanwhile, the evil law firm [[Wolfram &amp; Hart]] pay increasing attention to Angel.  They tempt him toward darkness when they resurrect [[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]], Angel's ex-lover and [[vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)#Vampire's siring and rebirth|sire]] — killed by Angel in the first season of ''Buffy'' in the episode "[[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode)|Angel]]".

[[Charles Gunn (Angel)|Charles Gunn]], who was introduced toward the end of the first season in the episode "War Zone", is a street-tough leader of a gang of vampire hunters. He is initially determined to kill Angel, but slowly comes to accept him and join his cause throughout season two.  Wolfram &amp; Hart's star lawyer [[Lindsey McDonald]] primes Darla as its weapon to bring down Angel.  However, Darla is brought back as a human, not a vampire.  But as a human, she suffers from a terminal case of [[syphilis]] — which she had contracted in her original life before being sired.  Lindsey brings in [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]], a vampire originally sired by Angelus, to restore Darla to the cause of evil.  Enraged by this, Angel begins to grow darker.  He cuts himself off from his staff (secretly to keep them away from this kind of dark territory for their own sake) and attempts to go after the pair himself.  In despair, Angel sleeps with Darla (cf. "[[Reprise (Angel)|Reprise]]"), but the next morning, he has an epiphany; seeing the error of his ways, he banishes Darla and reunites with his group.  When Cordelia vanishes, [[Lorne (Angel)|Lorne]], the flamboyant demon owner of karoake bar [[Caritas (Buffyverse)|Caritas]], reluctantly takes Angel and his crew to his home dimension, [[Pylea]], to rescue her.  They return with [[Winifred Burkle|Winifred "Fred" Burkle]], a former physics student who has been trapped in the dimension for five long years.

To get over news of [[The Gift (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|the death of his ex-girlfriend, Buffy]], Angel spends three months in a  [[monastery]], where he encounters some demon monks and goes home frustrated in season three.  He returns to Los Angeles, as does Darla — now bearing his child.  [[Daniel Holtz]], an old enemy of both Angel and Darla, is resurrected by a demon to take revenge on the vampires that killed his family.  The group is puzzled over what might be the first vampire birth. Darla sacrifices her life to save the life of her child, [[Connor (Angel)|Connor]].  The gang is eager to care for the infant, but Wesley soon learns of a (false) frightening prophecy that suggests that Angel will murder his son.  Feeling disconnected from the group, Wesley does not share this information, and quietly kidnaps Connor.  This backfires as he is attacked and the child is seized by Holtz and his protégée [[List of minor Angel characters#Justine Cooper|Justine]]. Wanting Angel to suffer the loss of a child as he did, Holtz escapes through a rip in the fabric of space to the dimension of Quor'Toth, and raises the boy as his own.  Angel feels that his son is lost forever, and tries to murder Wesley.  Though he survives, Wesley is banished from the group.  Weeks later, Connor returns, but because time moves faster in Quor'Toth, he is now a teenage boy, having been raised by Holtz.  Tricking Angel into believing he needs to be the one to take Connor in, Holtz gives Angel a letter letting Connor know that he will be leaving and to trust Angel.  Holtz gets Justine to kill him, but ends up making it look like a vampire attack so Connor will assume the worst.  Connor imprisons his birth father, Angel, in a casket and drops it to the bottom of the ocean. Cordelia's visions have been progressively getting worse, and she becomes part demon to make them easier on herself. Her old lover, the [[Groosalugg]], comes back from Pylea to be with her, but leaves her when he discovers that she instead loves Angel.

Despite his exile from his old friends, Wesley locates and frees Angel at the beginning of season four.  A hellish [[List of minor Angel characters#The Beast|Beast]] emerges and blocks out the sun over L.A.  He then proceeds to kill the staff at Wolfram &amp; Hart.  Although the city survives, the sunlight seems to be blotted out permanently.  The team resorts to releasing Angel's soul, believing Angelus knows helpful information about the beast.  Although the team takes safety precautions, Angelus is released from his cell by Cordelia, who is at the time under the influence of the soon to be born [[Jasmine (Angel)|Jasmine]].  Luckily they manage to restore Angel's soul, thanks to help from [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] and [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]].  Their efforts, however, do not prevent the coming of [[Jasmine (Angel)|Jasmine]], who was indirectly responsible for the work of the Beast.  Jasmine, it turns out, was formerly one of the Powers That Be and plans to solve all the world's problems by giving humanity total happiness through spiritual enslavement to her.  She arrives in our world through manipulation of Cordelia and Connor, using them as a conduit into our world, eventually forcing Cordelia to fall into a coma.  Fred is accidentally inoculated against Jasmine's spell by contact with her blood and frees the rest of the gang though they remain hopelessly outnumbered by thousands already entranced by Jasmine.  Angel travels through a magic portal into a world previously visited by Jasmine to find a way of breaking her power over L.A.'s populace.  By revealing her true name, they are able to break Jasmine's spell over everyone.  Jasmine confronts Angel, but is then killed by Connor.  Connor is revealed never to have been under Jasmine's influence, but he went along for the sake of having a semblance of family and happiness.  In the season finale, they are met by Lilah Morgan, the resurrected Head of Wolfram &amp; Hart's Special Project Division, who congratulates them on preventing [[world peace]], and says that as a token of their appreciation, Wolfram &amp; Hart would like to give them the Los Angeles branch.  To help save Cordelia and Connor, who has gone mad with confusion over losing everything, Angel reluctantly agrees.

In season five, the gang begins to settle into their new lives at Wolfram &amp; Hart.  Gunn undergoes a special cognitive procedure that transforms him into a brilliant lawyer.  The group receives an [[amulet]] that resurrects a past companion of Angelus, the en-souled vampire [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]], initially as a ghost-like presence but later regains corporeal status due to the machinations of [[Lindsey McDonald]] in a surprise return.  Cordelia, who has been in a [[coma]], has ''[[Powers That Be (Angel)|The Powers That Be]]'' grant her one last request, in which she helps Angel get "back on track", then dies.  Angel is briefly reunited with his son Connor, now in a new identity thanks to the agreement between Angel and Wolfram &amp; Hart at the end of Season Four. Connor regains the memories of his former identity, but doesn't acknowledge this to protect his new parents (though he later reveals to Angel that he does in fact remember his previous life).  Fred finally declares her affections to Wesley, but shortly after is possessed by an ancient and powerful demon called [[Illyria (Angel)|Illyria]].  Wesley is devastated by the loss of Fred, but agrees to help Illyria adjust to her new form and the unfamiliar world she's in.  Angel, after getting one last vision from Cordelia before her death, infiltrates the [[Circle of the Black Thorn]], a [[secret society]] responsible for engineering the [[Apocalypse]], and plans to take them all out in a simultaneous, hard-hitting strike.  Because this is probably a [[suicide mission]], he tells each of his friends to spend the day as if it were their last.  That night, the team launches its attack on the Circle, dividing up their targets.  When Wesley is fatally stabbed, Illyria, concerned for his safety, arrives at his side after killing her targets, but is unable to save him.  Illyria asks Wesley if he'd like her to assume the form of Fred, and Wesley agrees, allowing him to say goodbye to the woman he loved.  Lorne leaves and disappears into the night, his innocence destroyed, after fulfilling Angel's last order to kill Lindsey, the former Wolfram &amp; Hart lawyer who had turned his back on the firm. Angel confronts [[Senior Partners]]' new liaison [[List of minor Angel characters#Marcus Hamilton|Marcus Hamilton]], and defeats him with help from Connor.

Once the Circle has been dismantled, Angel and the surviving members of his gang [[wikt:rendezvous|rendezvous]] in the alley behind the Hyperion Hotel.  Illyria arrives with news of Wesley's death and feels the need to lash out her anger/grief. Spike too arrives, triumphant about his successful mission and hungry for further violent fighting. Gunn emerges, staggering from a serious stomach wound, but ready to fight.  The survivors wait as the [[Senior Partners]]' army of warriors, [[giant (mythology)|giant]]s, and a [[dragon]] approaches. Angel and his crew prepare for the upcoming battle, with Angel saying, "Personally, I kind of want to slay the dragon". The series then ends with Angel saying, "Let's go to work", after which he and his team attack the army of monsters head on.

===Episodes===
{{Main|List of Angel episodes}}

===Origins===
Co-producer Greenwalt points out, "There's no denying that ''Angel'' grew out of ''Buffy''." Several years before ''Angel'' debuted, Joss Whedon developed the concept behind ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' to invert the Hollywood formula of "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie."&lt;ref name=blondegirl&gt;Billson, Anne, ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer (BFI TV Classics S.)''. British Film Institute (December 5, 2005), pp24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; The character Angel was first seen in the [[Welcome to the Hellmouth|first episode]] and became a regular, appearing in the opening credits during seasons 2 and 3. According to the fictional universe first established by ''Buffy'', the '[[Buffyverse]]',&lt;ref&gt;The term 'Buffyverse' is used amongst fans of ''Buffy/Angel'' online to describe the fictional universe established by ''Buffy/Angel''. It is also used in published materials such: Walton, Andy, "[http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/05/19/buffy.sidebar/ Slang-age in the Buffyverse]", ''CNN'' (February 18, 2004 ), and the book, Ouellette, Jennifer, [http://physics.about.com/od/physicsbooks/gr/buffyverse.htm ''Physics of the Buffyverse''], ''Penguin Books'' (January 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Angel was born in 18th-century Ireland; after being turned into a soulless, immortal vampire, he became legendary for his evil acts, until a band of wronged Gypsies punished him by restoring his soul, overwhelming him with guilt. Angel eventually set out on a path of redemption, hoping that he could make up for his past through good deeds. In ''Buffy''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Graduation Day, Part Two|Season Three finale]], he leaves [[Sunnydale]] for L.A. to continue his atonement without Buffy. Whedon believed that "Angel was the one character who was bigger than life in the same way that Buffy was, a kind of superhero."&lt;ref&gt;Havens, Candace, ''Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy'' Benbella Books (May 1, 2003), p103.&lt;/ref&gt; Whedon has compared the series to its parent, "It's a little bit more straightforward action show and a little bit more of a guys' show."&lt;ref&gt;Bassom, David, "Buffy, Angel and Me," from ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer magazine'' #12 (UK, September 2000), page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the central concept behind ''Buffy'' was "high school as a horror movie" in small-town America,&lt;ref&gt;'Said, SF', "[http://www.shebytches.com/SFSaidgb.html Interview with Joss Whedon by SF Said] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430050551/http://www.shebytches.com/SFSaidgb.html |date=April 30, 2009 }}", ''Shebytches.com'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; co-creators David Greenwalt and Whedon were looking to make ''Angel'' into a different "gritty, urban show."&lt;ref&gt;Havens, Candace, ''Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy'' Benbella Books (May 1, 2003), p102 (quote from Greenwalt)&lt;/ref&gt; Whedon explained, "We wanted a much darker show, darker in tone. It's set in Los Angeles because there are a lot of demons in L.A. and a wealth of stories to be told. We also wanted to take the show a little older and have the characters deal with demons in a much different way. Buffy is always the underdog trying to save the world, but Angel is looking for redemption. It's those two things that creatively make the shows different."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Havens, Candace, ''Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy'' Benbella Books (May 1, 2003), p101-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Angel101.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The title character, [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]], from the premiere episode, "[[City Of]]".]]
Whedon and Greenwalt prepared a six-minute promotional video pitch, often called the "Unaired ''Angel'' pilot" for the [[The WB Television Network|WB Network]].&lt;ref name="topping"&gt;Topping, Keith, ''Hollywood Vampire'', (3rd edition, includes Season 4) ''Virgin Books'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Some shots from this short were later used in the opening credits.&lt;ref name="topping"/&gt;

Early during the life of the series, some effort was made to slightly soften the original concept. For example, scenes were cut from the pilot episode, "City of," in which Angel tasted the blood of a murder victim;&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Maryelizabeth &amp; Holder, Nancy &amp; Mariotte, Jeff, ''[[List of Buffyverse guidebooks#"Casefiles"|Casefiles]]'', ''Pocket Books'' (May 2002), page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; the episode that was originally written to be the second episode, "[[Corrupt (Angel)|Corrupt]]", was abandoned altogether. Writer [[David Fury]] explained, "The network was shocked. They said 'We can't shoot this. This is way too dark.' We were able to break a new idea, we had to turn it over in three days."&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Maryelizabeth &amp; Holder, Nancy &amp; Mariotte, Jeff, ''Casefiles'', ''Pocket Books'' (May 2002), page 43-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the tone was lightened and the opening episodes established [[Angel Investigations]] as an idealistic, shoestring operation.

A first draft script reveals that ''Angel'' was originally intended to include the character [[Whistler (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Whistler]], played by [[Max Perlich]], who had already been featured in two ''Buffy'' episodes, "[[Becoming, Part One]]" and "[[Becoming, Part Two|Part Two]]".&lt;ref&gt;Topping, Keith, ''Hollywood Vampire'', (3rd edition, includes Season 4) ''Virgin Books'' (2004), pages 18–19. Also see: Greenwalt, David &amp; Whedon, Joss, [http://www.twiztv.com/scripts/angel/season1/angel-earlydraft.htm Angel pilot, early draft] ''20th Century Fox'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Perlich said, "I never got called again. If they had called, I would have probably accepted because it was a great experience and I think Joss is very original and talented."&lt;ref&gt;Dilullo, Tara, "Where are they now? Max Perlich" in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer Magazine" #62, ''Titan Magazines'' (July 2004 issue), pages 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the producers created a Whistler-like character, [[Allen Francis Doyle|Doyle]]. [[Cordelia Chase]], also from the original Sunnydale crew, joined Angel and Doyle.

===Executive producers===
Joss Whedon is credited as executive producer throughout the run of the series.&lt;ref name="whedonimdb"&gt;Various authors, "[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0923736/ Joss Whedon]", ''Internet Movie Database'' (updated 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside ''Angel'', he was also working on a series of other projects such as ''Buffy'', ''[[Fray (comic)|Fray]]'', ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', which would later also lead to the film ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]''.&lt;ref name="whedonimdb" /&gt;

For the first three seasons, David Greenwalt, who co-created the series with Whedon, was also credited as executive producer;&lt;ref&gt;Various authors, "[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0339264/ David Greenwalt]", ''Internet Movie Database'' (updated 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; during this time, he also took on the role of [[show runner]]. He left to oversee ''[[Miracles (TV series)|Miracles]]'', but continued to work on ''Angel'' as a consulting producer for the final two seasons. [[Tim Minear]] also served as an executive producer during the second season, contributing heavily to the season's story arc. At the start of the fourth season, [[David Simkins]] was made show runner and executive producer, but after three months, he left the show due to "creative differences" and is not credited in any episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whedon.info/A-Brief-History-of-Mutant-Enemy.html|title=A Brief History of Mutant Enemy|work=Whedon.info|date=May 24, 2004|accessdate=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established ''Angel'' writer [[Jeffrey Jackson Bell|Jeffrey Bell]] took over for the balance of season 4 and became executive producer for season 5. After ''Buffy'' concluded, writer [[David Fury]] joined the staff as executive producer for the final season.

[[Fran Rubel Kuzui]] and her husband, [[Kaz Kuzui]], were also credited as executive producers throughout ''Angel'',&lt;ref&gt;Various authors, "[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0476900/ Fran Kuzui]" and "[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0476901/ Kaz Kuzui]", ''Internet Movie Database'' (updated 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; but were not involved in any writing or production for the show. Jeffrey Bell mentions in his DVD commentary during the closing credits of the ''Angel'' series finale "[[Not Fade Away (Angel episode)|Not Fade Away]]" that two people were credited and paid for ''Angel'' without needing to ever step on the set.&lt;ref&gt;''Angel Complete Fifth Series DVD Boxset.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Angel'' crew member Dan Kerns also revealed in an essay that two executive producers "received credit and sizeable checks for the duration of ''Buffy'' and ''Angel'' for doing absolutely nothing".&lt;ref&gt;Kerns, Dan, "Angel by the Numbers", from Yeffeth, Gareth (editor), ''[[Five Seasons of "Angel"]]'', ''Benbella''(October 2004), p25.&lt;/ref&gt; Their credit, rights and royalties for the whole ''Buffy'' franchise, which includes spin-off ''Angel'', relate to their funding, producing and directing of the original movie version of ''Buffy''.&lt;ref&gt;See Kerns, Dan, "Angel by the Numbers", from Yeffeth, Gareth (editor), ''Five Seasons of "Angel"'', ''Benbella''(October 2004), p25, and Golden, Christopher, and Holder, Nancy, ''Watcher's Guide Vol. 1''. Simon &amp; Schuster (October 1, 1998), "Gail Berman and Fran Kuzui came to [Whedon] to ask if he wanted to do the TV series" (p241). Also see ''Watcher's Guide Vol. 1'', pp246–249.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
Script-writing was done by [[Mutant Enemy Productions|Mutant Enemy]], a production company created by Joss Whedon in 1997. The writers with the most writing credits for the series include: Joss Whedon, David Greenwalt, Tim Minear, Jeffrey Bell, [[David Fury]], [[Steven S. DeKnight]], [[Mere Smith]], and [[Elizabeth Craft and Sarah Fain]].&lt;ref&gt;Various authors, "[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162065/fullcredits Full Cast and Crew for ''Angel'']", ''Internet Movie Database'' (updated 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors with writing credits include: [[Shawn Ryan]], [[Ben Edlund]], [[Drew Goddard]], Jeannine Renshaw, [[Howard Gordon]], [[Jim Kouf]], [[Jane Espenson]], [[Doug Petrie]], [[Tracey Stern]], [[David H. Goodman]], Scott Murphy, [[Marti Noxon]] and [[Brent Fletcher]].

Jane Espenson has explained how scripts came together for Mutant Enemy Productions series ''Buffy'', ''Angel'' and ''Firefly'':&lt;ref name="espensonwriting"&gt;Espenson, Jane, "[http://www.fireflyfans.net/firefly/espenson.htm The Writing Process] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011095900/http://fireflyfans.net/firefly/espenson.htm |date=October 11, 2007 }}", ''Fireflyfans.net'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; a meeting was held and an idea was floated (generally by Whedon) and the writers brainstormed to develop the central theme of the episode and the character development. Next, the staff meet in the anteroom to Whedon's office to begin "breaking" the story into acts and scenes; the only one absent would be the writer working on the previous week's episode.

Next, the writers developed the scenes onto a marker-filled whiteboard, featuring a "brief ordered description of each scene."&lt;ref name="espensonwriting" /&gt; A writer was then selected to create an outline of the episode's concept– occasionally with some dialogue and jokes– in one day. The outline was then given to the show runner, who revised it within a day. The writer used the revised outline to write the first draft of the script while the other writers worked on developing the next. This first draft was usually submitted for revision within 3–14 days; afterward, a second (and sometimes third) draft was written. After all revisions were made, the final draft would be produced as the "shooting draft".

===Music===
{{Main article|Music in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel}}
''Angel'' features a mix of [[orchestration|original]], [[indie (music)|indie]], rock and pop music.

The opening theme was composed by [[Holly Knight]] and [[Darling Violetta]], an alternative rock group that performed two songs during the third season of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''. Holly Knight was the music producer of the track. The next year, ''Angel'' invited bands to submit demos for the theme music to the show. They asked bands to use "dark superhero ideas" and "Cello-rock".&lt;ref&gt;AngelHART, "[http://websites.cable.ntl.com/%7Efraxis/the_ww/old/features/thomas.html Interview – Jymm Thomas of Darling Violetta – interviewed by Angelheart] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009171307/http://websites.cable.ntl.com/~fraxis/the_ww/old/features/thomas.html |date=October 9, 2006 }}", ''Watchers Web'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Darling Violetta watched pivotal Angel-related episodes of ''Buffy'' such as "[[Passion (Buffy episode)|Passion]]", "[[Becoming (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Becoming, Parts One and Two]]" for inspiration. Eventually, Whedon accepted Darling Violetta's interpretation of an ''Angel'' theme as that most suitable to the show. The theme has a slower tempo than the ''Buffy'' theme, as well as heavier use of acoustic instruments such as [[cello]]. In 2005, the band composed an extended version of the ''Angel'' theme called "The Sanctuary Extended Remix", which featured on the soundtrack of the series ''[[Angel: Live Fast, Die Never]]''.

The demon karaoke bar, [[Caritas (Buffyverse)|Caritas]], is frequently used to spotlight pop hits. There has also been a soundtrack album, ''Angel: Live Fast, Die Never''. The soundtrack mostly consists of scores created for the show by [[Robert J. Kral]] along with a remixed theme and four other songs from the show. [[Douglas Romayne]] scored 33 episodes of ''Angel'' in seasons 4 and 5, along with series lead composer, Rob Kral.

===Cancellation===
On February 14, 2004, the [[WB Network]] announced that ''Angel'' would not be brought back for a sixth season. The one-paragraph statement indicated that the news, which had been reported by an [[web site|Internet site]] the previous day, had been leaked well before the network intended to make its announcement.&lt;ref&gt;KJB, "[http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/492/492496p1.html Breaking News: Angel to End After 5 Seasons.  Whedon talks about cancellation]", ''IGN.com'' (February 13, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Joss Whedon posted a message on a popular fan site, The Bronze: Beta, in which he expressed his dismay and surprise, saying he was "heartbroken"&lt;ref&gt;Whedon, Joss, [http://www.bronzebeta.com/Archive/Joss/Joss20040214.htm Online post], ''Bronzebeta.com'' (February 14, 2004).  Archived version.&lt;/ref&gt; and described the situation as "Healthy Guy Falls Dead From a Heart Attack."&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Jeff [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,637917,00.html The X Factor] (May 21, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Fan reaction was to organize letter-writing campaigns, online petitions, blood and food drives, advertisements in trade magazines and via mobile billboards, and attempts to lobby other networks ([[UPN]] was a favorite target, as it had already picked up ''Buffy''). Outrage for the cancellation focused on [[Jordan Levin]], WB's Head of Entertainment. It was the second highest-rated program to be canceled on the WB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whedon.info/A-Brief-History-of-Mutant-Enemy.html|title=A Brief History of Mutant Enemy|publisher=Whedon.info|date=May 24, 2004|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Head writer David Fury "guaranteed" that if Joss Whedon had not requested an early renewal, ''Angel'' would have been back for a Season 6:&lt;blockquote&gt;

The only reason that ''Angel'' didn't come back...it's a very simple thing. Because our ratings were up, because of our critical attention, Joss specifically asked Jordan Levin, who was the head of [[The WB]] at the time, to give us an early pick-up because every year they [would] wait so long to give ''Angel'' a pick-up [and] a lot of us [would] turn down jobs hoping that ''Angel'' will continue– he [Joss] didn't want that to happen. So, he was feeling very confident and he [Joss] just asked Jordan, "Like, make your decision now whether you're going to pick us up or not," and Jordan, sort of with his hands tied, with his back up against the wall, called him the next day and said, "Okay, we're cancelling you." Jordan's no longer there and The WB has since recognized...I believe Garth Ancier at The WB said that it was a big mistake to cancel ''Angel''. There was a power play that happened that just didn't fall out the way they wanted it to. We wanted to get an early pick-up, we didn't. In fact we forced them [the WB] to make a decision, and with his hand forced he [Levin] made the decision to cancel us.

I guarantee that, if we waited as we normally did, by the time May had come around they would have picked up ''Angel''. I can guarantee that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikejozic.com/buffyweek6.html |title=MEANWHILE Interviews... Buffy Post Mortem |publisher=Mikejozic.com |date=September 2004 |accessdate=June 16, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100511081943/http://www.mikejozic.com/buffyweek6.html| archivedate= May 11, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Angel'''s final episode, "[[Not Fade Away (Angel episode)|Not Fade Away]]", aired on the WB on May 19, 2004. The ambiguous final moments left some fans hoping for the continuation of ''Angel'' and the Buffyverse in the future, hopes that came to fruition in November 2007 with the publication of the first issue of the [[comic book]] series ''[[Angel: After the Fall]]''. The series is [[Joss Whedon]]'s official continuation of the ''Angel'' television series and follows in the footsteps of the comic book ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'', whose first issue was published in March 2007.

==Themes==
While ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' was built around the angst of adolescence, ''Angel'' chronicles the different stages of adulthood after one leaves home and begins working.  Cordelia Chase, who had been the most popular and superficial girl in [[Sunnydale High]] on ''Buffy'', develops over the course of the series from an insecure young woman struggling in a daunting real world into an unexpectedly mature woman.  Similarly, Wesley, the once uptight and bookish [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], becomes a man of quiet confidence and often ruthless action.

[[File:Opening credits (Angel TV series).jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Angel'' screenshot from the opening credits.  Taking place in a dark metropolis, ''Angel'' often alluded to the [[Hardboiled|noir]] detective genre that influenced the show.]]

In much the same way as ''Buffy'' had been both a homage and parody of traditional [[horror films]], ''Angel'' gave the same treatment to the classical ''[[film noir]]''.  Producer Kelly Manners said "''Angel'' is a dark show about a man looking for redemption... We have an alcoholic metaphor with ''Angel''.  Angel is a guy who is one drink away from going back to his evil roots"&lt;ref&gt;"Season 1 featurette" ''[[Angel DVDs#Season 1|''Angel'' Season 1 DVD set]]'', disc 3 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  He attempts to find redemption through helping the helpless of Los Angeles in a fashion similar to that of noir detectives.  The first episode even included a [[Philip Marlowe]]-style voiceover.  Angel filled the role of the reluctant, streetwise detective who has dealings with a variety of underworld characters.  In this case, the "underworld" is a literal underworld of demons and supernatural beings.  In one instance, Angel is explicitly compared with fictional noir private-detective Marlowe.&lt;ref&gt;Episode "[[Dear Boy (Angel)|Dear Boy]]", ''Angel'' (2000).  Wesley says of Angel, "Oh he's eccentric, all the great ones are.  Sherlock Holmes, Philip Marlowe."&lt;/ref&gt;  Many traditional ''noir'' stories and characters were explored in earlier episodes, including the ditzy but attractive secretary, the cagey but well-informed partner, and clashes with crooked lawyers, femme fatales and meddlesome, too-good-for-their-own-good cops.  These were usually given a modern or supernatural twist.

The style and focus of the show changed considerably over its run, and starting late in season two the original noir idea was mostly discarded in favor of more large-scale supernatural-themed conflicts.  In later seasons, the mythology and stories became increasingly complex; in Season Four, one of the characters on the show itself described the storyline as "a turgid supernatural soap opera."&lt;ref&gt;"[[Players (Angel episode)]]", ''20th Century Fox'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas the show initially dealt with the difficulty of being kind to people on a personal basis, the show ultimately focused on Angel's status as an [[archetype|archetypal]] [[Champion]] for humanity, and explored ideas such as moral ambiguity, the spiritual cost of violence, and the nature of [[free will]].  The enduring theme throughout the series was the struggle for [[Redemption (religious)|redemption]].

''Angel'' explored trust motifs as an increasingly central focus of the show. In the first two seasons, there were sprinklings of deceit and treachery, but in the last three seasons duplicity began to pervade the thematic structure, culminating in Season Five when almost every episode included some kind of double-cross, trickery, or illusion.  An idea presented in Season Three was that even [[prophecy]] can betray, as they are often deceiving if not plain lies.  In Season Five, it is repeatedly emphasized that the characters can trust no one in their new situation.  The series is also notable for harsh betrayals within the cast of main characters; such events often having lethal consequences.

''Angel'' depicted the feelings of loneliness, danger, and callousness often attributed to the urban Los Angeles megalopolis.  The divisions between the ordered world of the day and the chaotic world of the night have been trademark themes of ''noir'' and by depicting a protagonist who literally has no daytime life, the series was able to explore these same themes in more dramatic, metaphorical ways.  As the series progressed, the creators were able to explore darker aspects of the characters, particularly Angel, who commits a number of morally questionable actions, and periodically reverts to his evil persona [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angelus]].

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Criticisms of ''Angel'' are often put into the context of it being a spin-off to popular show ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', and will at times refer to it being "better than" or "lesser than" its parent show. For example, an article in ''[[The Independent]]'' states, "The LA-set spin-off to ''Buffy'' was initially dismissed as the original's poor cousin but gradually developed into a darkly entertaining show in its own right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Hughes, Sarah | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/buffys-creator-makes-his-valley-of-the-dolls-1684993.html | title = Buffy's creator makes his valley of the dolls  | date = May 15, 2009 | work = [[The Independent]] | accessdate =May 16, 2009 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090516232132/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/buffys-creator-makes-his-valley-of-the-dolls-1684993.html| archivedate= May 16, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. ratings===
In two of the four seasons when both shows were in production, ''Buffy''{{'}}s overall yearly ratings were higher than ''Angel''{{'}}s.&lt;ref&gt;Topping, Keith, ''[[List of Buffyverse guidebooks#"Hollywood Vampire"|Hollywood Vampire]]'', (3rd edition, includes Season 4) ''Virgin Books'' (2004), page 360: "During [November–December 2002], ''Angel'' was getting slightly higher ratings than ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy]]'', aided by a new Sunday-slot and the popular series ''[[Charmed]]'' as its lead-in show."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-offs==
''Angel'', itself a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from ''Buffy'', has in turn inspired a whole "industry" of books, comics, and merchandise.

===Expanded universe===
{{Main article|List of Angel comics}}
Outside of the TV series, ''Angel'' has been officially expanded and elaborated on by authors and artists in the so-called "[[Buffyverse]] [[Expanded Universe]]".  The creators of these works may or may not keep to established continuity.  Similarly, writers for the TV series were under no obligation to use information which had been established by the [[Expanded Universe]], and sometimes contradicted such continuity.

Many of these works are set at particular times within the Buffyverse.  For example, Joss Whedon has written an ''Angel'' mini-series of comics, ''[[Long Night's Journey (Angel comic)|Long Night's Journey]]'', which was specifically set in early ''Angel'' Season Two.  [[Angel comics|''Angel'' comics]] were originally published by [[Dark Horse Comics]], which published them from 2000 until 2002.  [[IDW Publishing]] obtained rights to publish ''Angel'' comics in 2005 and has been releasing them since. Spinning off from the ''Angel'' comics comes an entire series of ''Spike'' comics, using the ''Angel'' logo's typeface in its depiction of the name "Spike", among these are the comics ''[[Spike vs. Dracula]]'', ''[[Spike: Asylum]]'' and ''[[Spike: Shadow Puppets]]''.  As of November 2007 to February 2009, the story of the series was continued canonically in lieu of a Season Six in a 17-issue maxi-series titled ''[[Angel: After the Fall]]'', written by [[Brian Lynch (writer)|Brian Lynch]] and plotted by both Lynch and Joss Whedon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=110401 IDWEEK: Brian Lynch talks Spike and Angel @ Newsarama.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428030336/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=110401 |date=April 28, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=110457 IDWEEK: Joss Whedon talks Angel, After The Fall @ Newsarama.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429040155/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=110457 |date=April 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This spun off into numerous ''Angel'' titles set after the television series, of which all are now considered canon, until 2011 when ''Angel'' rights revert to Dark Horse Comics who began to publish ''Angel'' comics under the banner of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine#Angel .26 Faith|Angel &amp; Faith]]''.

Following their success with a series of [[List of Buffy novels|''Buffy'' novels]], [[Pocket Books]] purchased the license to produce novels for ''Angel''.  Twenty-four [[Angel novels|''Angel'' novels]] were published. [[Jeff Mariotte]] became the most successful ''Angel'' novelist, publishing eleven ''Angel'' novels.  They also published seven [[Buffy/Angel novels|''Buffy''/''Angel'' crossover books]] that featured settings and characters from both series.

===Undeveloped spin-offs===
{{Main article|Undeveloped Buffy the Vampire Slayer spinoffs}}
In March 2006, Joss Whedon still talked of the possibility of a [[television movie|TV movie]] involving Spike to be written and directed by Tim Minear.

===Merchandise===
''Angel'' has inspired magazines and companion books, as well as countless websites, online discussion forums, and works of [[fan fiction]].  [[Eden Studios]] have published an [[Angel (role-playing game)|''Angel'' role-playing game]].

==Biography==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2016}}
Anup Singh Choudry is an Ugandan-born Sikh of Punjabi ancestry. His grandfather Hari Singh had migrated from Rawalpindi to Uganda in the early 1900s serving in the then Crown Colony's civil service system. His late father Tarlok Singh had also served in Uganda's civil service, retiring shortly before 1972 when [[Idi Amin]] &lt;!--, the Commander of Uganda's Army &gt; coupe leader &gt; Dictator turned President and finally CBE 'Conqueror of the British Empire'--&gt; seized the properties and businesses of all the country's Asians and European citizens and forced around 30,000 Asians holding British passports to flee to Britain.

&lt;!--With his appointment as a Justice of the High Court of Uganda, he has now added the title of Judge/Justice to his credits as a lawyer, auditor, businessman and author of several books.--&gt;After being schooled in Uganda he travelled to England to study at the [[University of London]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. Having qualified as a solicitor, he practised law in England for 20 years until 2000 after which he practised as an auditor in quality control.

'''Return to Uganda'''

Anup Singh Choudry has come full circle now by returning to Uganda and its civil service. 
In 2004 he was nominated for appointment as a Judge of the Uganda High Court by Uganda's Judicial Service Commission, being approved by the Ugandan parliament.
 
'''On respect'''

Anup Singh Choudry said the following in a BBC interview:

"In any decent society or civilised society we all have the same values as human beings and our values have a base in our spiritual values. At the moment society is looking to its social fabric to give it values and forgetting the spiritual base. And that is where we are losing respect as we would define it in the previous generations."

"In my generation I was taught to respect elders, neighbours, the authorities and teachers. The moment that discipline breaks down what happens is a loss of respect for teachers, for your parents, your religion and the law."&lt;!--ref needed --&gt;

Justice Choudry said he was delighted to be appointed to the bench and added that he would serve Uganda with the same vigour, diligence and dedication as had his late father Tarlok Singh and late grandfather Hari Singh.
 
The new Justice was one of the delegates at the meeting in Lahore last year in connection with the setting up of Baba Nanak University at Nanakana Sahib in Pakistan where he eloquently put forward his case for allocation of 2500 acres of land for the university campus in a proposal that was successfully approved by the Pakistani authorities.

{{Ancient Greek religion}}

'''Artemis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|t|ɪ|m|ɪ|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἄρτεμις}} Artemis, {{IPA-grc|ár.te.mis|att}}), in the [[ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology|myth]], is the goddess of the hunt, the wilderness, wild animals and chastity. 

Artemis is the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and the twin sister of [[Apollo]]. She was the patron and protector of young girls, and was believed to bring disease upon women and relieve them of it. In later [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] times, she even assumed the role of [[Eileithyia]] in aiding women during childbirth. Much like [[Athena]] and [[Hestia]], Artemis preferred to remain a maiden and is sworn never to marry. 

Artemis was one of the most widely venerated of the Ancient Greek deities and her [[Temple of Artemis|temple]] at Ephesus was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. Artemis' symbols included a bow and arrow, a quiver and hunting knives and the [[deer]] and the [[Cupressus|cypress]] were sacred to her. The goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] is her Roman equivalent. 

== Etymology ==
The name Artemis ([[Proper noun|''noun'']], [[Gender (linguistics)|''feminine'']]) is of unknown or uncertain etymology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artemis|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Artemis&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Babiniotis"/&gt; although various sources have been proposed.&lt;ref name="Andrew Lang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Charles Anthon"/&gt;

According to [[Johann Theodor Jablonski|J. T. Jablonski]],&lt;ref name="Charles Anthon"/&gt; the name is also [[Phrygia]]n and could be "compared with the royal appellation ''Artemas'' of [[Xenophon]]. According to [[Charles Anthon]] the primitive root of the name is probably of Persian origin from *''arta'', *''art'', *''arte'', all meaning "great, excellent, holy," thus Artemis "becomes identical with the great mother of Nature, even as she was worshipped at Ephesus".&lt;ref name="Charles Anthon"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Anthon |first=Charles |author= |authorlink=Charles Anthon |authors= |editor= |encyclopedia= A Classical dictionary |title=Artemis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIYMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA210#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= |edition= |date= |year=1855 |month= |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|volume= |location=New York |id= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |pages=210 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anton Goebel "suggests the root στρατ or ῥατ, "to shake," and makes Artemis mean the thrower of the dart or the shooter".&lt;ref name="Andrew Lang"/&gt;

The name may be possibly related to [[Greek language|Greek]] ''árktos'' "[[bear]]" (from [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] *''h₂ŕ̥tḱos''), supported by the bear cult the goddess had in [[Attica]] ([[Brauronia#Cult of Artemis Brauronia|Brauronia]]) and the [[Neolithic]] remains at the [[Arkoudiotissa Cave]], as well as the story of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]], which was originally about Artemis ([[Arcadia]]n epithet ''kallisto'');&lt;ref&gt;Michaël Ripinsky-Naxon, ''The Nature of Shamanism: Substance and Function of a Religious Metaphor'' (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1993), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; this cult was a survival of very old totemic and shamanistic rituals and formed part of a larger [[bear worship|bear cult]] found further afield in other [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] cultures (e.g., Gaulish [[Artio]]). It is believed that a precursor of Artemis was worshipped in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Crete]] as the goddess of mountains and hunting, [[Britomartis]]. While connection with [[Anatolia]]n names has been suggested,&lt;ref&gt;Campanile, ''Ann. Scuola Pisa'' '''28''':305; Restelli, ''Aevum'' '''37''':307, 312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwin L. Brown, "In Search of Anatolian Apollo", ''Charis: Essays in Honor of Sara A. Immerwahr'', ''Hesperia Supplements'' '''33''' (2004:243–257). p. 251: Artemis, as Apollo's inseparable twin, is discussed in pp. 251ff.&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest attested forms of the name ''Artemis'' are the [[Mycenaean Greek]] {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀳𐀖𐀵}}, ''a-te-mi-to'' /Artemitos/ and {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀴𐀖𐀳}}, ''a-ti-mi-te'' /Artimitei/, written in [[Linear B]] at [[Pylos]].&lt;ref&gt;John Chadwick and Lydia Baumbach, "The Mycenaean Greek Vocabulary" ''Glotta'', '''41'''.3/4 (1963:157-271). p. 176f, ''s.v.''

Christidis, "Further remarks on A-TE-MI-TO and A-TI-MI-TE", ''Kadmos'' '''11''':125–28.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] suggested that the ''e''/''i'' interchange points to a [[Pre-Greek]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Artemis was venerated in [[Lydia]] as ''Artimus''.&lt;ref&gt;''Indogermanica et Caucasica: Festschrift fur Karl Horst Schmidt zum 65. Geburtstag'' (Studies in Indo-European language and culture), W. de Gruyter, 1994, ''Etyma Graeca'', pp. 213–214, on [https://books.google.com/books?id=P3vb4KDB_UkC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=lydian+artimus&amp;ei=QpsNTOjcC5bCzQSXlpXeCw&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=lydian%20artimus&amp;f=false Google books]; Houwink ten Cate, ''The Luwian Population Groups of Lycia and Cilicia Aspera during the Hellenistic Period'' (Leiden) 1961:166, noted in this context by Brown 2004:252.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgios Babiniotis]], while accepting that the etymology is unknown, also states that the name is already attested in Mycenean Greek and is possibly of Pre-Greek origin.&lt;ref name="Babiniotis"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Dictionary of Modern Greek|Λεξικό της Νέας Ελληνικής Γλώσσας]]|first=Georgios|last=Babiniotis|authorlink=Georgios Babiniotis|location=Athens|year=2005|publisher=Κέντρο Λεξικολογίας|chapter=Άρτεμις|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Greek writers, by way of [[folk etymology]], and some modern scholars, have linked Artemis (Doric ''Artamis'') to ἄρταμος, ''artamos'', i.e. "butcher"&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)/rtamos|ἄρταμος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|*)/artemis|Ἄρτεμις|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or, like [[Plato]] did in ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', to {{lang|grc|ἀρτεμής}}, ''artemḗs'', i.e. "safe", "unharmed", "uninjured", "pure", "the stainless maiden".&lt;ref name="Andrew Lang"&gt;{{cite book|title=Myth, Ritual, and Religion|first=Andrew|last=Lang|authorlink=Andrew Lang|url=https://archive.org/stream/mythritualreligi02lang#page/209/mode/1up|pages=209–210|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co|location=London|year=1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charles Anthon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)rtemh/s|ἀρτεμής|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Birth ===
[[File:Apollo Artemis Brygos Louvre G151.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Apollo (left) and Artemis (right). [[Brygos]] (potter, signed), [[Briseis Painter]], Tondo of an Attic red-figure cup, ca. 470 BC, [[Louvre]].]]

[[File:Artemis Kephisodotos Musei Capitolini MC1123.jpg|thumb|250px|Roman marble ''Bust of Artemis'' after [[Cephisodotus the Elder|Kephisodotos]] ([[Musei Capitolini]]), Rome.]]

Various conflicting accounts are given in Classical Greek mythology regarding the birth of Artemis and Apollo, her twin brother. However, in terms of parentage, all accounts agree that she was the daughter of Zeus and [[Leto]] and that she was the twin sister of Apollo.

An account by [[Callimachus]] has it that Hera forbade Leto to give birth on either terra firma (the mainland) or on an island. Hera was angry with her husband Zeus because he had impregnated Leto but the island of [[Delos]] disobeyed Hera and Leto gave birth there.

According to the [[Homeric Hymn]] to Artemis the island where Leto gave birth was [[Ortygia]].&lt;ref&gt;Hammond. ''Oxford Classical Dictionary.'' 597-598.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Cretan history Leto was worshipped at [[Phaistos]] and, in Cretan mythology, Leto gave birth to Apollo and Artemis on the islands known today as [[Paximadia (islands)|Paximadia]].

A ''[[scholium]]'' of [[Servius]] on ''[[Aeneid]]'' iii. 72 accounts for the island's archaic name Ortygia&lt;ref&gt;Or as a separate island birthplace of Artemis— "Rejoice, blessed Leto, for you bare glorious children, the lord Apollon and Artemis who delights in arrows; her in Ortygia, and him in rocky Delos," says the [[Homeric Hymn]]; the etymology ''Ortygia'', "Isle of Quail", is not supported by modern scholars.&lt;/ref&gt; by asserting that Zeus transformed Leto into a [[quail]] (''ortux'') in order to prevent Hera from finding out about his infidelity, and Kenneth McLeish suggested further that in quail form Leto would have given birth with as few birth-pains as a mother quail suffers when it lays an egg.&lt;ref&gt;McLeish, Kenneth. ''Children of the Gods'' pp 33f; Leto's birth-pangs, however, are graphically depicted by ancient sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

The myths also differ as to whether Artemis was born first, or Apollo. Most stories depict Artemis as born first, becoming her mother's midwife upon the birth of her brother Apollo.

=== Childhood ===
The childhood of Artemis is not fully related in any surviving myth. The ''[[Iliad]]'' reduced the figure of the dread goddess to that of a girl, who, having been thrashed by [[Hera]], climbs weeping into the lap of Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' XXI 505-13&lt;/ref&gt;

A poem by [[Callimachus]] to the goddess "who amuses herself on mountains with archery" imagines some charming vignettes. Artemis, while sitting on the knee of her father, Zeus, asked him to grant her several wishes:

# to always remain a virgin
# to have many names to set her apart from her brother Phoebus ([[Apollo]])
# to have a bow and arrow made by the Cyclops
# to be the Phaesporia or Light Bringer
# to have a knee-length tunic so that she could hunt
# to have sixty "daughters of [[Okeanos]]", all nine years of age, to be her choir
# to have twenty Amnisides Nymphs as handmaidens to watch her dogs and bow while she rested
# to rule all the mountains
# any city
# to have the ability to help women in the pains of childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/CallimachusHymns1.html#3|title=Callimachus – Hymn III to Artemis 1-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artemis believed that she had been chosen by [[Moirai|the Fates]] to be a midwife, particularly since she had assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin brother, Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katinkahesselink.net/other/artemis.html On-line English translation].&lt;/ref&gt; All of her companions remained virgins, and Artemis closely guarded her own chastity. Her symbols included the golden bow and arrow, the hunting dog, the stag, and the moon. Callimachus tells&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Callimachus – Hymn III to Artemis 46&lt;/ref&gt; how Artemis spent her girlhood seeking out the things that she would need to be a huntress, how she obtained her bow and arrows from the isle of [[Lipari|Lipara]], where [[Hephaestus]] and the [[Cyclops]] worked.

Oceanus' daughters were filled with fear, but the young Artemis bravely approached and asked for bow and arrows. Callimachus then tells how Artemis visited [[Pan (god)|Pan]], the god of the forest, who gave her seven bitches and six dogs. She then captured six golden-horned deer to pull her chariot. Artemis practiced with her bow first by shooting at trees and then at wild beasts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Intimacy ===
As a virgin, Artemis had interested many gods and men, but only her hunting companion, [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]], won her heart. Orion was accidentally killed either by Artemis or by Gaia.

The river god [[Alpheus (mythology)|Alpheus]] was in love with Artemis, but as he realizes that he can do nothing to win her heart, he decides to capture her. Artemis, who is with her companions at Letrenoi, goes to Alpheus, but, suspicious of his motives, she covers her face with mud so that the river god does not recognize her. In another story, Alphaeus tries to rape Artemis' attendant [[Arethusa (mythology)|Arethusa]]. Artemis pities Arethusa and saves her by transforming Arethusa into a spring in Artemis' temple, [[Artemis Alphaea]] in Letrini, where the goddess and her attendant drink.

Bouphagos, the son of the Titan Iapetus, sees Artemis and thinks about raping her. Reading his sinful thoughts, Artemis strikes him at Mount Pholoe.

{{anchor|Siproites}} Siproites is a boy, who, either because he accidentally sees Artemis bathing or because he attempts to rape her, is turned into a girl by the goddess.

=== Actaeon ===
Multiple versions of the Actaeon myth survive, though many are fragmentary. The details vary but at the core, they involve a great hunter, [[Actaeon]] who Artemis turns into a stag for a transgression and who is then killed by hunting dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, "The Failure of Orpheus", ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' '''124''' (1994:163-196) p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''Homo Necans'' (1972), translated by Peter Bing (University of California Press) 1983, p 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the dogs are his own, who no longer recognize their master. Sometimes they are Artemis' hounds.

According to the standard modern text on the work, Lamar Ronald Lacey's ''The Myth of Aktaion: Literary and Iconographic Studies'', the most likely original version of the myth is that Actaeon was the hunting companion of the goddess who, seeing her naked in her sacred spring, attempts to force himself on her. For this hubris, he is turned into a stag and devoured by his own hounds. However, in some surviving versions, Actaeon is a stranger who happens upon her. According to the Latin version of the story told by the Roman [[Ovid]]&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' iii.131; see also pseudo-Apollodorus' ''Bibliotheke'' iii. 4&lt;/ref&gt; having accidentally seen Artemis (Diana) on [[Mount Cithaeron]] while she was bathing, he was changed by her into a stag, and pursued and killed by his fifty hounds.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Different tellings also diverge in the hunter's transgression, which is sometimes merely seeing the virgin goddess naked, sometimes boasting he is a better hunter than she,&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, "Aktaion and a Lost 'Bath of Artemis'" ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''110''' (1990:26-42)&lt;/ref&gt; or even merely being a rival of Zeus for the affections of [[Semele]].

=== Adonis ===
[[File:Giuseppe-Mazzuoli-The-Death-of-Adonis-hermitag.jpg|thumb|right|''The Death of Adonis'', by [[Giuseppe Mazzuoli (1644–1725)|Giuseppe Mazzuoli]], 1709 – ''[[Hermitage Museum]]''.]]
In some versions of the story of [[Adonis]], Artemis sent a [[Boar|wild boar]] to kill Adonis as punishment for his hubristic boast that he was a better hunter than her.

In other versions, Artemis killed Adonis for revenge. In later myths, Adonis had been related as a favorite of [[Aphrodite]], and Aphrodite was responsible for the death of [[Hippolytus (mythology)#Hippolytus as Virbius|Hippolytus]], who had been a favorite of Artemis. Therefore, Artemis killed Adonis to avenge Hippolytus’s death.

In yet another version, Adonis was not killed by Artemis, but by Ares, as punishment for being with Aphrodite.

=== Orion ===
[[Orion (mythology)|Orion]] was Artemis' hunting companion. In some versions, he is killed by Artemis, while in others he is killed by a [[Scorpius#Mythology|scorpion]] sent by [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. In some versions, Orion tries to seduce Opis,&lt;ref&gt;"Another name for Artemis herself", [[Karl Kerenyi]] observes, ''The Gods of the Greeks'' (1951:204).&lt;/ref&gt; one of Artemis' followers, and she kills him. In a version by [[Aratus]],&lt;ref&gt;Aratus, 638&lt;/ref&gt; Orion takes hold of Artemis' robe and she kills him in [[self-defense]].

In yet another version, Apollo sends the scorpion. According to [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]]&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''[[Poeticon astronomicon]]'', ii.34, quoting the Greek poet Istrus.&lt;/ref&gt; Artemis once loved Orion (in spite of the late source, this version appears to be a rare remnant of her as the pre-Olympian goddess, who took consorts, as [[Eos]] did), but was tricked into killing him by her brother Apollo, who was "protective" of his sister's maidenhood.

=== The Aloadae ===
The twin sons of [[Poseidon]] and [[Iphidemia]], Otos and Ephialtes, grew enormously at a young age. They were aggressive, great hunters, and could not be killed unless they killed each other. The growth of the [[Aloadae]] never stopped, and they boasted that as soon as they could reach heaven, they would kidnap Artemis and [[Hera]] and take them as wives. The gods were afraid of them, except for Artemis who captured a fine deer (or in another version of the story, she changed herself into a doe) and jumped out between them. The Aloadae threw their spears and so mistakenly killed each other.

=== Callisto ===

[[File:Tizian 015.jpg|thumb|''[[Diana and Callisto]]'' by [[Titian]]]]

[[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]] was the daughter of Lycaon, King of Arcadia and also was one of Artemis's hunting attendants. As a companion of Artemis, she took a vow of chastity. Zeus appeared to her disguised as Artemis, or in some stories Apollo gained her confidence and took advantage of her or, according to [[Ovid]], raped her. As a result of this encounter, she conceived a son, Arcas.

Enraged, Hera or Artemis (some accounts say both) changed her into a bear. Arcas almost killed the bear, but Zeus stopped him just in time. Out of pity, Zeus placed Callisto the bear into the heavens, thus the origin of Callisto the Bear as a constellation. Some stories say that he placed both Arcas and Callisto into the heavens as bears, forming the [[Ursa Minor]] and [[Ursa Major]] constellations.

=== Iphigenia and the Taurian Artemis ===
Artemis punished [[Agamemnon]] after he killed a sacred stag in a [[sacred grove]] and boasted that he was a better hunter than the goddess. When the Greek fleet was preparing at [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]] to depart for [[Troy]] to begin the [[Trojan War]], Artemis becalmed the winds. The seer [[Calchas]] advised Agamemnon that the only way to appease Artemis was to sacrifice his daughter [[Iphigenia]]. Artemis then snatched Iphigenia from the altar and substituted a deer. Various myths have been told about what happened after Artemis took her. Either she was brought to Tauros and led the priests there or became Artemis' immortal companion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisFavour.html#Iphigeneia |title=FAVOUR OF ARTEMIS : Greek mythology |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |author=Aaron J. Atsma |accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Niobe ===
A Queen of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and wife of [[Amphion]], [[Niobe]] boasted of her superiority to Leto because while she had fourteen children ([[Niobids]]), seven boys and seven girls, Leto had only one of each. When Artemis and Apollo heard this impiety, Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics, and Artemis shot her daughters, who died instantly without a sound. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions two of the Niobids were spared, one boy and one girl. Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, killed himself. A devastated Niobe and her remaining children were turned to stone by Artemis as they wept. The gods themselves entombed them.

=== Chione ===
Chione was a princess of Pokis. She was beloved by two gods, [[Hermes]] and [[Apollo]], and boasted that she was prettier than Artemis because she made two gods fall in love with her at once. Artemis was furious and killed Chione with her arrow or struck her dumb by shooting off her tongue. However, some versions of this myth say Apollo and Hermes protected her from Artemis' wrath.

=== Atalanta, Oeneus and the Meleagrids ===
[[File:Artemis libation Louvre CA599.jpg|thumb|right|Artemis pouring a libation, c. 460-450 BC.]]
Artemis saved the infant [[Atalanta]] from dying of exposure after her father abandoned her. She sent a female bear to suckle the baby, who was then raised by hunters. In some stories, Artemis later sent a bear to hurt Atalanta because others claimed Atlanta was a superior hunter.

Among other adventures, Atalanta participated in the hunt for the [[Calydonian Boar]], which Artemis had sent to destroy [[Calydon]] because King [[Oeneus]] had forgotten her at the harvest sacrifices. In the hunt, Atalanta drew the first blood and was awarded the prize of the skin. She hung it in a sacred grove at [[Tegea]] as a dedication to Artemis.

[[Meleager]] was a hero of Aetolia. King [[Oeneus]] had him gather heroes from all over Greece to hunt the [[Calydonian Boar]]. After the death of [[Meleager]], Artemis turned his grieving sisters, the [[Meleagrids]] into [[guineafowl]] that Artemis loved very much.

=== Aura ===
In [[Nonnus]] ''[[Dionysiaca]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Aura does not appear elsewhere in surviving literature and appears to have been offered no [[Cult (religion)|cult]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aura (mythology)|Aura]] was the daughter of [[Lelantos]] and [[Periboia]]. She was a virgin huntress, just like Artemis and proud of her maidenhood. One day, she claimed that the body of Artemis was too womanly and she doubted her virginity. Artemis asked [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]] for help to avenge her dignity and caused the rape of Aura by [[Dionysus]]. Aura became a mad and dangerous killer. When she bore twin sons, she ate one of them while the other one, [[Iacchus]], was saved by Artemis. Iacchus later became an attendant of [[Demeter]] and the leader of [[Eleusinian Mysteries]].

=== Polyphonte ===

[[Polyphonte]] was a young woman who fled home preferring the idea of a virginal life with Artemis to the conventional life of marriage and children favoured by Aphrodite. As a punishment Aphrodite cursed her, causing her to have children by a bear. The resulting offspring, Agrius and Oreius, were wild cannibals who incurred the hatred of Zeus. Ultimately the entire family were transformed into birds and more specifically ill portents for mankind.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], Metamorphoses, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trojan War ===
Artemis may have been represented as a supporter of Troy because her brother [[Apollo]] was the patron god of the city and she herself was widely worshipped in western Anatolia in historical times. In the ''[[Iliad]]''&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' 21.470 ff).&lt;/ref&gt; she came to blows with Hera, when the divine allies of the Greeks and Trojans engaged each other in conflict. Hera struck Artemis on the ears with her own quiver, causing the arrows to fall out. As Artemis fled crying to Zeus, Leto gathered up the bow and arrows.

Artemis played quite a large part in this war. Like her mother and brother, who was widely worshipped at Troy, Artemis took the side of the Trojans. At the Greek's journey to Troy, Artemis becalmed the sea and stopped the journey until an oracle came and said they could win the goddess' heart by sacrificing [[Iphigenia]], [[Agamemnon]]'s daughter. Agamemnon once promised the goddess he would sacrifice the dearest thing to him, which was Iphigenia, but broke that promise. Other sources{{which|date=November 2010}} said he boasted about his hunting ability and provoked the goddess' anger. Artemis saved Iphigenia because of her bravery. In some versions of the myth,{{which|date=November 2010}} Artemis made Iphigenia her attendant or turned her into [[Hecate]], goddess of night, witchcraft, and the underworld.

[[Aeneas]] was helped by Artemis, Leto, and Apollo. Apollo found him wounded by Diomedes and lifted him to heaven. There, the three of them secretly healed him in a great chamber.

== Worship ==
[[File:Jerash Temple of Artemis.jpg|thumb|''Roman Temple of Artemis'' in [[Jerash, Jordan]], built during the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]].]]

{{Main|Brauronia}}

Artemis, the goddess of forests and hills, was worshipped throughout [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;“. . . a goddess universally worshipped in historical Greece, but in all likelihood pre-Hellenic.” Hammond, ''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Her best known [[Cult (religious practice)|cults]] were on the island of [[Delos]]
(her birthplace), in Attica at [[Brauron]] and Mounikhia (near [[Piraeus]]), and in [[Sparta]]. She was often depicted in paintings and statues in a forest setting, carrying a bow and arrows and accompanied by a deer.

The ancient Spartans used to sacrifice to her as one of their patron goddesses before starting a new [[military campaign]].

[[Athenian festivals]] in honor of Artemis included [[Elaphebolia]], [[Mounikhia]], Kharisteria, and [[Brauronia]]. The festival of [[Artemis Orthia]] was observed in [[Sparta]].

Pre-pubescent and adolescent Athenian girls were sent to the [[sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron]] to serve the Goddess for one year. During this time, the girls were known as ''arktoi'', or little she-bears. A myth explaining this servitude states that a bear had formed the habit of regularly visiting the town of Brauron, and the people there fed it, so that, over time, the bear became tame. A girl teased the bear, and, in some versions of the myth, it killed her, while, in other versions, it clawed out her eyes. Either way, the girl's brothers killed the bear, and Artemis was enraged. She demanded that young girls "act the bear" at her sanctuary in atonement for the bear's death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Golden|Golden, M.]], ''Children and Childhood in Classical Athens'' ([[Baltimore]]: [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 1990), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LvV0CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT84&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 84].&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginal Artemis was worshipped as a fertility/childbirth goddess in some places, assimilating [[Ilithyia]], since, according to some myths, she assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin. During the [[classical antiquity|Classical period]] in [[Athens]], she was identified with [[Hecate]]. Artemis also assimilated [[Caryatis]] ([[Carya (goddess)|Carya]]).

As '''Aeginaea''', she was worshipped in [[Sparta]]; the name means either huntress of [[chamois]], or the wielder of the javelin ({{lang|grc|αἰγανέα}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], iii. 14. §&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schmitz |first=Leonhard |author-link =  |contribution=Aeginaea |editor-last=Smith | editor-first=William |title=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |volume=1 |page=26 |publisher= |place=Boston |year=1867 |contribution-url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0035.html |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in Sparta, Artemis ''Lygodesma'' was worshipped. This epithet means "willow-bound" from the Gr. ''lygos'' (λυγός, willow) and ''desmos'' (δεσμός, bond). The [[willow tree]] appears in several ancient Greek myths and rituals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YTfxZH4QnqgC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=artemis+lygodesma&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=g1MyQhf-b8&amp;sig=gBMucGkaGbYr7-hTHT11NCFovPo&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y-KoT-i4D4Kd8gPFivnLBA&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=artemis%20lygodesma&amp;f=false Bremmer Jan N. (2008) ''Greek Religion and Culture, the Bible and the Ancient Near East'', Brill, Netherlands, p. 187.]&lt;/ref&gt;

She was worshipped at [[Naupactus]] as '''Aetole'''; in her temple in that town there was a statue of white marble representing her throwing a javelin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], x. 38. §&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt; This "Aetolian Artemis" would not have been introduced at Naupactus, anciently a place of [[Ozolian Locris]], until it was awarded to the [[Aetolia]]ns by [[Philip II of Macedon]]. Strabo records another precinct of "Aetolian Artemos" at the head of the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]].&lt;ref&gt;"Among the Heneti certain honours have been decreed to Diomedes; and, indeed, a white horse is still sacrificed to him, and two precincts are still to be seen — one of them sacred to the Argive Hera and the other to the Aetolian Artemis. (Strabo, v.1.9 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/5A*.html on-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Agoraea]] she was the protector of the [[agora]].

As '''[[Agrotera]]''', she was especially associated as the patron goddess of hunters. In Athens Artemis was often associated with the local [[Aegina|Aeginian]] goddess, '''[[Aphaea]]'''. As '''[[Potnia Theron]]''', she was the patron of wild animals; [[Homer]] used this title. As '''[[Kourotrophos]]''', she was the nurse of youths. As '''Locheia''', she was the goddess of childbirth and midwives.

She was sometimes known as '''[[Cynthia]]''', from her birthplace on [[Cynthus|Mount Cynthus]] on [[Delos]], or '''Amarynthia''' from a festival in her honor originally held at Amarynthus in [[Euboea]].

She was sometimes identified by the name '''[[Phoebe (mythological characters)|Phoebe]]''', the feminine form of her brother Apollo's solar epithet [[Phoebus]].

'''Alphaea''', '''Alpheaea''', or '''Alpheiusa''' ([[Ancient Greek|Gr.]] {{lang|grc|Ἀλφαῖα}}, {{lang|grc|Ἀλφεαία}}, or {{lang|grc|Ἀλφειοῦσα}}) was an epithet that Artemis derived from the river god [[Alpheus (mythology)|Alpheius]], who was said to have been in love with her.&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Schmitz | first = Leonhard | authorlink = Leonhard Schmitz | title = Alphaea | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 133 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0142.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was under this name that she was worshipped at Letrini in [[Elis]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' vi. 22. §&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'' viii. p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Ortygia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]] on [[Pindar]]'s ''Pythian Odes'' ii. 12, ''Nemean Odes'' i. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Artemis Alphaea was associated with the wearing of masks, largely because of the legend that while fleeing the advances of Alpheius, she and her [[nymph]]s escaped him by covering their faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = G. | last = Dickins | authorlink = | author2 = Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies | title = Terracotta Masks | booktitle = The Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia: Supplementary Papers | pages = 172 | publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers]] | year = 1929 | location = London, England | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=bFlZAAAAMAAJ | accessdate = 2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As '''Artemis Anaitis''', the 'Persian Artemis' was identified with [[Anahita]]. As [[Apanchomene]], she was worshipped as a hanged goddess.

{{anchor|Tauropolos}}She was also worshiped as '''Artemis Tauropolos''', variously interpreted as "worshipped at [[Taurica|Tauris]]", "pulled by a yoke of bulls", or "hunting bull goddess". A statue of Artemis "Tauropolos" in her temple at [[Brauron]] in Attica was supposed to have been brought from the [[Crimea|Taurians]] by [[Iphigenia]]. [[Tauropolia]] was also a festival of Artemis in [[Athens]]. There was a ''Tauropolion'', a temple in a ''[[temenos]]'' sacred to Artemis Tauropolos, in the north Aegean island of Doliche (now [[Ikaria]]). There is a Temple to 'Artemis Tauropolos' (as well as a smaller temple to an unknown goddess about {{convert|262|m|abbr=off}} south, on the beach) located on the eastern shore of Attica, in the modern town of Artemida (Loutsa). An aspect of the Taurian Artemis was also worshipped as [[Aricina]].

== Attributes ==
===Virginity===
An important aspect of Artmeis' persona and worship was her virginity, which may seem contradictory given her role as a goddess associated with childbirth. It is likely that the idea of Artemis as a virgin goddess is related to her primary role as a huntress. Hunters traditionally abstained from sex prior to the hunt as a form of ritual purity and out of a belief that the scent would scare off potential prey. The ancient cultural context in which Artemis' worship emerged also held that virginity was a prerequisite to marriage, and that a married woman became subservient to her husband. In this light, Artemis' virginity is also related to her power and independence. Rather than a form of asexuality, it is an attribute that signals Artemis as her own master, with power equal to that of male gods. It is also possible that her virginity represents a concentration of fertility that can be spread among her followers, in the manner of earlier mother goddess figures. However, some later Greek writers did come to treat Artemis as inherently asexual and as an opposite to [[Aphrodite]].&lt;ref name=Hjerrild&gt;Hjerrild, B. (2009). Near Eastern equivalents to Artemis. Tobias Fischer-Hansen &amp; Birte Poulsen, eds. ''From Artemis to Diana: The Goddess of Man and Beast''. Museum Tusculanum Press. {{ISBN|8763507889}}, 9788763507882.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a mother goddess===
Despite her virginity, both modern scholars and ancient commentaries have linked Artemis to the archetype of the [[mother goddess]]. Artemis was traditionally linked to fertility and was petitioned to assist women with childbirth. According to [[Herodotus]], the Greek playwright [[Aeschylus]] identified Artemis with [[Persephone]] as a daughter of [[Demeter]]. Her worshipers in [[Arcadia]] also traditionally associated her with Demeter and Persephone. In [[Asia Minor]], she was often conflated with local mother goddess figures, such as [[Cybele]], and [[Anahita]] in [[Iran]]. However, the archetype of the mother goddess was not highly compatible with the Greek pantheon, and though the Greeks had adopted worship of Cybele and other Anatolian mother goddesses as early as the 7th century BCE, she was not directly conflated with any Greek goddesses; instead, bits and pieces of her worship and aspects were absorbed variously by Artemis, Aphrodite, and others as Eastern influence spread.&lt;ref name=Hjerrild/&gt;

=== As the Lady of Ephesus ===
{{Main|Temple of Artemis}}
[[File:Statue of Artemis Ephesus.jpg|thumb|right|The Artemis of Ephesus, 1st century AD ([[Ephesus Archaeological Museum]])]]

At Ephesus in [[Ionia]], Turkey, her temple became one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the World]]. It was probably the best known center of her worship except for Delos. There the Lady whom the Ionians associated with Artemis through ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'' was worshipped primarily as a [[mother goddess]], akin to the Phrygian goddess [[Cybele]], in an ancient sanctuary where her [[cult image]] depicted the "Lady of Ephesus" adorned with multiple large beads. Excavation at the site of the ''Artemision'' in 1987–88 identified a multitude of tear-shaped [[amber]] beads that had been hung on the original wooden statue (''[[xoanon]]''), and these were probably carried over into later sculpted copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/98868504/49-MORRIS-Potnia-Aswiya-Anatolian-Greek-Religion|title="Potnia Aswia: Anatolian Contributions to Greek Religion" by Sarah P.

===Symbols===
* '''Bow and arrow'''

According to the [[Homeric Hymn]] to Artemis, she had golden bow and arrows, as her epithet was '''Khryselakatos''' ("of the Golden Shaft") and '''Iokheira''' ("showered by arrows"). The arrows of Artemis could also bring sudden death and disease to girls and women. Artemis got her bow and arrow for the first time from The Kyklopes, as the one she asked from her father. The bow of Artemis also became the witness of Callisto's oath of her virginity. In later cult, the bow became the symbol of waxing moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Bow |title= Bow |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Chariots'''
Artemis' chariot was made of gold and was pulled by four golden horned deer (Elaphoi Khrysokeroi).

Although quite seldom, Artemis is sometimes portrayed with a hunting spear. Her cult in Aetolia, the Artemis Aetolian, showed her with a hunting spear. The description about Artemis' spear can be found in Ovid's Metamorphosis,{{Where|date=July 2011}} while Artemis with a fishing spear connected with her cult as a patron goddess of fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Spears |title= Spears|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a goddess of maiden dances and songs, Artemis is often portrayed with a lyre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisGoddess.html#Dance |title= Dance |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Deer]]'''
Deer were the only animals held sacred to Artemis herself. On seeing a deer larger than a bull with horns shining, she fell in love with these creatures and held them sacred. Deer were also the first animals she captured. She caught five golden horned deer called '''Elaphoi Khrysokeroi''' and harnessed them to her chariot.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; The [[Labours of Hercules|third labour of Heracles]], commanded by [[Eurystheus]], consisted of catching the [[Cerynitian Hind]] alive. Heracles begged Artemis for forgiveness and promised to return it alive.

* '''Hunting dog'''
Artemis got her hunting dogs from [[Pan (god)|Pan]] in the forest of Arcadia. Pan gave Artemis two black-and-white dogs, three reddish ones, and one spotted one – these dogs were able to hunt even lions. Pan also gave Artemis seven bitches of the finest Arcadian race. However, Artemis only ever brought seven dogs hunting with her at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Pack|title=Pack |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Bear]]'''
The sacrifice of a bear for Artemis started with the Brauron cult. Every year a girl between five and ten years of age was sent to Artemis' temple at Brauron. The Byzantine writer Suidos relayed the legend in Arktos e Brauroniois. A bear was tamed by Artemis and introduced to the people of Athens. They touched it and played with it until one day a group of girls poked the bear until it attacked them. A brother of one of the girls killed the bear, so Artemis sent a plague in revenge. The Athenians consulted an oracle to understand how to end the plague. The oracle suggested that, in payment for the bear's blood, no Athenian virgin should be allowed to marry until she had served Artemis in her temple ('played the bear for the goddess').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Cult/ArtemisCult.html |title=Cult |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Boar]]'''
The boar is one of the favorite animals of the hunters, and also hard to tame. In honor of Artemis' skill, they sacrificed it to her. Oineus and Adonis were both killed by Artemis' boar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Animals |title=Animals |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Guinea fowl]]'''
Artemis felt pity for the [[Meleagrids]] as they mourned for their lost brother, Meleagor, so she transformed them into Guinea Fowl to be her favorite animals.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}
* '''Buzzard [[hawk]]'''
Hawks were the favored birds of many of the gods, Artemis included.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}
* [[Arecaceae|Palm]] and [[Cypress]] were issued{{Clarify|date=August 2010}} to be her birthplace. Other plants sacred to Artemis are [[Amaranth]] and [[Asphodelus|Asphodel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Plants|title= Plants |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In art ==
[[File:Bust of the goddess of Issa, Vis Museum, Croatia.JPG|thumb|right|Fourth century [[Praxiteles|Praxitelean]] bronze head of a goddess wearing a [[lunate]] crown, found at Issa ([[Vis (island)|Vis]], Croatia).]]

The oldest representations of Artemis in Greek Archaic art portray her as ''[[Potnia Theron]]'' ("Queen of the Beasts"): a winged goddess holding a stag and leopard in her hands, or sometimes a leopard and a lion. This winged Artemis lingered in ex-votos as [[Artemis Orthia]], with a sanctuary close by [[Sparta]].

In Greek classical art she is usually portrayed as a maiden huntress, young, tall and slim, clothed in a girl's short skirt,&lt;ref&gt;Homer portrayed Artemis as girlish in the ''[[Iliad]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; with hunting boots, a quiver, a bow&lt;ref&gt;Greek poets could not decide whether her bow was silver or gold: "Over the shadowy hills and windy peaks she draws her golden bow." ([[Homeric Hymn]] to Artemis), and it is a golden bow as well in [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 1.693, where her nymph's is of horn. "And how often goddess, didst thou make trial of thy silver bow?", asks [[Callimachus]] for whom it is a [[Cydonia (ancient Greece)|Cydonian]] bow that the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]] make for her (Callimachus, Hymn 3 to Artemis).&lt;/ref&gt; and arrows. Often, she is shown in the shooting pose, and is accompanied by a [[hunting dog]] or stag. When portrayed as a moon goddess, Artemis wore a long robe and sometimes a veil covered her head. Her darker side is revealed in some vase paintings, where she is shown as the death-bringing goddess whose arrows fell young maidens and women, such as the daughters of [[Niobe]].

Artemis was sometimes represented in Classical art with the crown of the [[crescent]] [[moon]], such as also found on [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]] and others.

On June 7, 2007, a Roman era bronze sculpture of ''[[Artemis and the Stag]]'' was sold at [[Sotheby's]] auction house in New York state by the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]] for $25.5 million.

== Legacy ==
===In astronomy===
[[105 Artemis]], the [[Artemis (crater)]], the [[Artemis Chasma]] and the [[Artemis Corona]] have all been named after the goddess.

Artemis is the acronym for "Architectures de bolometres pour des Telescopes a grand champ de vue dans le domaine sub-Millimetrique au Sol", a large [[bolometer]] camera in the [[Submillimetre astronomy|submillimeter]] range that was installed in 2010 at the [[Atacama Pathfinder Experiment]] (APEX), located in the [[Atacama desert|Atacama Desert]] in northern Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apex-telescope.org/instruments/pi/artemis/ |title=APEX – Artemis |publisher=Apex-telescope.org |date=2010-01-11 |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In taxonomy ===
The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] genus ''[[Artemia]]'', which entirely comprises the family Artemiidae, derives from Artemis. ''Artemia'' are aquatic crustaceans known as brine shrimp, the best known species of which, ''[[Artemia salina]]'', or [[Sea Monkeys]], was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' in 1758. ''Artemia'' live in salt lakes, and although they are almost never found in an open sea, they do appear along the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean coast]] near [[Ephesus]], where the [[Temple of Artemis]] once stood.

'''Automatic writing''' or '''psychography''' is a claimed psychic ability allowing a person to produce written words without consciously writing. The words purportedly arise from a subconscious, [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[supernatural]] source.{{R|"Spence"}} Scientists and skeptics consider automatic writing to be the result of the [[Ideomotor phenomenon|ideomotor effect]]{{R|"Burgess"}}{{R|"Heap"}}{{R|"Erickson"}}{{R|"Karen"}} and even proponents of automatic writing admit it has been the source of innumerable cases of self-delusion.{{R|"Nickell4"}} Automatic writing is not the same thing as [[free writing]].

==History==

===Early history===

An early example of the practice is the 16th century [[Enochian]] language, allegedly dictated to [[John Dee]] and [[Edward Kelley]] by [[Enochian angels]] and integral to the practice of [[Enochian magic]].{{R|"Karen2"}}

Parapsychologist [[William Fletcher Barrett]] wrote that "automatic messages may take place either by the writer passively holding a pencil on a sheet of paper, or by the [[planchette]], or by a 'ouija board'."{{R|"Barrett"}} In [[spiritualism]], spirits are claimed to take control of the hand of a [[mediumship|medium]] to write messages, letters, and even entire books. Automatic writing can happen in a trance or waking state.{{R|"Dictionary"}} The [[Surrealist]] poet [[Robert Desnos]] claimed he was among the most gifted in automatic writing.{{R|"Thacker"}} Some [[psychical researchers]] such as [[Thomson Jay Hudson]] have claimed no spirits are involved in automatic writing and the [[subconscious mind]] is the explanation.{{R|"Hudson"}}

Automatic writing as a spiritual practice was reported by [[Hyppolyte Taine]] in the preface to the third edition of his ''De l'intelligence'', published in 1878.{{R|"Taine"}} Besides "ethereal visions" or "magnetic auras", [[Fernando Pessoa]] claimed to have experienced automatic writing. He said he felt "owned by something else", sometimes feeling a sensation in the right arm he claimed was lifted into the air without his will.{{R|"Pessoa"}} Georgie Hyde-Lees, the wife of [[William Butler Yeats]], also claimed she could write automatically.{{R|"Marjorie"}} [[Sri Aurobindo]] as well as The Mother ([[Mirra Alfassa]]) regularly practiced Automatic writing.

A prominent alleged example of automatic writing is the Brattleboro hoax. When [[Charles Dickens]] died in 1870 he left The [[Mystery of Edwin Drood]] unfinished. According to the itinerant printer [[T.P. James|T. P. James]] this angered Dicken's spirit so much that he channeled the rest of the novel through James's hand. This is supposed to have begun on Christmas Eve 1872 and continued in thrice weekly sessions until completion.{{R|"Heller"}}

Shortly after his 1917 marriage to [[Georgie Hyde-Lees]] the poet [[W. B. Yeats]] came to be heavily influenced by her delving into what they referred to as "the automatic script".{{R|"Yeats"}}

The medium [[Pierre L. O. A. Keeler]] had an alleged spirit writing communication from [[Abraham Lincoln]] currently exhibited at the [https://lilydaleassembly.org/place-to-see-points-of-interest/lily-dale-museum/ Lily Dale Museum]. Despite Lincoln being a well known skeptic and Keeler having been known to employ magician's tricks this is used as one of the many examples of skeptics purportedly endorsing spiritualism—posthumously.{{R|"Nickell4"}} Skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] who made a detailed examination of the "spirit" writing concluded it had no resemblance to Lincoln's handwriting and described the message as "bogus".&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (2007). ''Adventures in Paranormal Investigation''. University Press of Kentucky. pp. 42-47. {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2467-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Conan Doyle]], in his book ''The New Revelation'' (1918), wrote that automatic writing occurs either by the writer's subconscious or by external spirits operating through the writer.{{R|"Doyle"}} Doyle and his wife led an automatic writing séance with [[Harry Houdini]] where Lady Doyle wrote fifteen pages of purported messages from Houdini's mother although this information was immediately discounted as fraudulent by Houdini.{{R|"Houdini"}}

Paranormal investigator [[Harry Price]] exposed the supposed automatic writing in the [[Borley Rectory]] as the wall-scrawling of a housewife attempting to hide an extramarital affair.{{R|"Karen"}}

There was an apocalyptic cult led by a lapsed [[Scientologist]] named Keech. He and his followers were waiting for an alien ship to take them to the nonexistent planet Clarion and save them from a worldwide flood that was to commence at midnight on December 20, 1954. When that didn't occur Keech allegedly got an automatic writing message from God calling the whole thing off.{{R|"Sharp"}}{{R|"Jeffrey"}}

===Recent===

In 1975, Wendy Hart of [[Maidenhead]] claimed she wrote automatically about Nicholas Moore, a sea captain who died in 1642.{{R|"Rabey"}} Also in 1975 the [[CIA]] attempted to employ [[remote viewing]] through the [[Stargate Project]]. In the spring of 1989 [[Defense Intelligence Agency]]'s remote viewing unit was called in to assist in locating the fugitive Charlie Jordan. One Angela Dellafiora employed a form of automatic writing she called written remote viewing. Although there are conflicting accounts of exactly where she claimed Jordan was she was apparently able to describe his location "somewhere in northern Wyoming, near a campground" accurately.{{R|"Nickell3"}}

[[David Icke]] claims to have been alerted he was a ''Son of the Godhead'' through his automatic writing.{{R|"Icke"}} [[Vassula Ryden]] claims to receive and transcribe messages from her guardian angel Daniel, Jesus, Yahweh.{{R|"Curty"}} She has provoked both skepticism and credulity from Catholic laity and clergy, as well as the skeptical community at large.{{R|"Nickell2"}} Alleged cases of automatic writing have included [[Joseph Smith]]{{R|"Apocrypha"}}, [[Patience Worth]]{{R|"Karen"}}, [[Aleister Crowley]]{{R|"Booklaw"}}, [[Jane Roberts]]{{R|"Seth"}}, [[Helen Schucman]] {{R|"Miracles"}} and [[Neale Donald Walsch]].{{R|"Conversations"}}{{R|"Lim"}}

==Scientific analysis and skepticism==

Scientists and skeptics consider automatic writing to be the result of the [[Ideomotor phenomenon|ideomotor effect]].{{R|"Burgess"}}{{R|"Heap"}}{{R|"Erickson"}}{{R|"Karen"}}

According to skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]], "automatic writing is produced while one is in a dissociated state. It is a form of motor automatism, or unconscious muscular activity."{{R|"Nickell"}} Neurologist [[Terence Hines]] has written "automatic writing is an example of a milder form of [[dissociative state]]".{{R|"Hines"}}

Paranormal researcher [[Ben Radford]] writes in his 2017 book ''Investigating Ghosts'' that there is no real way to know if the writing is coming from "outside their bodies," you "must take their word for it. Because the source of the information is at issue and the medium cannot be validated, we must turn to the content of the material." Various psychic mediums have claimed to channel famous dead people like Susan Lander who claimed that [[Betsy Ross]] contacted her to say, "I am gay and I fly the flag of pride and liberty for all of us." Radford states that historians say that there is "no credible historical evidence that Ross ... either made or had a hand in designing the American flag." Without some kind of validation, "anyone can claim to communicate with the spirit of anyone." Radford states that it would seem to be easier for the ghost to communicate by voice than by controlling a pen, considering spelling and grammar are more difficult. "Automatic writing should logically hinder, not help spirit communication."&lt;ref name="Radford 2017"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Radford |first1=Ben|authorlink=Ben Radford |title=Investigating Ghosts: The Scientific Search for Spirits |date=2017 |publisher=Rhombus Publishing Company |location=Corrales, New Mexico |isbn=9780936455167 |pages=182–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific studies===

In an 1890 paper on hypnotism [[Morton Prince]] claims, "automatic writing is not a purely unconscious reflex act, but, the product of conscious individuality," and further claims that the hand that is writing is under the control of a separate hypnotic personality during trances.{{R|"Prince1"}}{{R|"Prince2"}} Physician [[Charles Arthur Mercier]] in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' (1894) criticized the spiritualist interpretation of automatic writing, concluding, "there is no need nor room for the agency of spirits, and the invocation of such agency is the sign of a mind not merely unscientific, but uninformed."{{R|"Mercier"}}

Psychology professor [[Théodore Flournoy]] investigated the claim by nineteenth-century medium [[Hélène Smith]] (Catherine Müller) she did automatic writing to convey messages from [[Mars]] in Martian language. Flournoy concluded her "Martian" language had a strong resemblance to Ms. Smith's native language of French and her automatic writing was "romances of the subliminal imagination, derived largely from forgotten sources (for example, books read as a child)." He invented the term [[cryptomnesia]] to describe this phenomenon.{{R|"Randi1"}}

In 1927, psychiatrist [[Harold Dearden]] wrote that automatic writing is a psychological method of "tapping" the unconscious mind and there is nothing mysterious about it.{{R|"Deardon"}}

In 1986, A. B. Joseph investigated two female patients who were found to exhibit [[ictal]] [[hypergraphia]].{{R|"Joseph"}}

Automatic writing behavior was discovered by Dilek Evyapan and Emre Kumral in three patients with [[Cerebral hemisphere|right hemispheric]] damage.{{R|"Dilek"}}

A 2012 study of ten [[psychograph]]ers using [[single photon emission computed tomography]] showed differences in brain activity and writing complexity during alleged trance states vs. normal state writing.{{R|"PECT"}}

==Pop culture and media==

In an interview in ''GQ'', [[David Byrne]] indicates an interest in automatic writing due to the influence of [[Brian Eno]].{{R|"Alex"}}

Automatic writing is touted by medium [[Bonnie Page]] in a ''Sentinel and Enterprise'' article as a method of accessing [[claircognizance]] abilities.{{R|"Page"}}

Portions of [[Van Morrison]]'s album ''[[Astral Weeks]]'' supposedly are inspired by dreams, reveries, and automatic writing.{{R|"Van"}}

Czech director [[Jan Svankmajer]] claims he concocted the screenplay for his hybrid film ''Insect (Hmyz)'' in a fit of automatic writing.{{R|"Jan"}}

[[William S. Burroughs]] has described his book ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' as "automatic writing gone horribly wrong" and believed he found his subconscious taken over by a hostile entity.{{R|"William"}}{{R|"Wills"}}

{{Other uses|Aventinus (disambiguation)}}
'''Aventinus''' (said to have reigned 854-817 BC),&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] ''Roman Antiquities'' 1.71&lt;/ref&gt; one of the mythical kings of [[Alba Longa]], who was buried on the [[Aventine Hill]] later named after him.  He is said to have reigned thirty-seven years, and to have been succeeded by [[Procas]], the father of [[Amulius]].

[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], in analysing [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', Book vii. 656, speaks of an Aventinus, a king of the aboriginal inhabitants of Rome, who was killed and buried on the hill afterwards called the [[Aventine Hill]].  This king may be conflated with this one or with [[Aventinus (mythology)|a separate figure]] in the ''Aeneid'':

:"The Aventine is a hill in the city of Rome.  It is accepted that it derives its name from birds (aves) which, rising from the Tiber, nested there (as we read in the eighth book of a suitable home for the nests of ill-omened birds).  This is because of a king of the Aboriginal Italians, Aventinus by name, who was both killed and buried there - just as the Alban king Aventinus was, he who was succeeded by Procas.  Varro, however, states that amongst the Roman people, the Sabines accepted this mountain when it was offered them by Romulus, and called it the Aventine after the Aventus river in its area.  It is therefore accepted that these different opinions came later, for in the beginning it was called Aventinus after either the birds or the Aboriginal King: from which it is accepted that the son of Hercules mentioned here took his name from that of the hill, not vice versa."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.657|title=Commentary on the Aeneid of Virgil|last=Maurus Servius Honoratus|authorlink=Maurus Servius Honoratus|publisher=[[Perseus Project]], [[Tufts University]]|accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Maher''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɑːr}}; born January 20, 1956)&lt;ref name=filmref /&gt; is an American comedian, political commentator and television host. He is known for the [[HBO]] political talk show ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'' (2003–present) and the similar [[Late night television in the United States|late-night]] show called ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' (1993-2002), originally on [[Comedy Central]] and later on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

Maher is known for his sarcastic attitude,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qxa5uj95B84C&amp;pg=PA87 |title=American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story |first=Cynthia |last=True |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2002 |isbn=9780380803774 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; political satire and sociopolitical commentary.

Maher supports the legalization of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[same-sex marriage]]. His critical views of religion were the basis for the 2008 documentary film ''[[Religulous]]''.

==Early life==
Maher was born in New York City. His father, William Aloysius Maher Jr.,&lt;ref name=fdr1/&gt; was a network news editor and radio announcer, and his mother, Julie Maher (née Berman), was a nurse.&lt;ref name="filmref"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/32/Bill-Maher.html|title=Bill Maher Biography|publisher=Film Reference|accessdate=January 17, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108083123/http://www.filmreference.com/film/32/Bill-Maher.html|archivedate=January 8, 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in his Irish-American father's Roman Catholic religion. Until his early teens, he was unaware that his mother, whose family was from Hungary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dead-frog.com/comedians/comic/bill_maher|title=Bill Maher|work=Dead-Frog|accessdate=April 10, 2013|quote= Part Hungarian part Irish...}}&lt;/ref&gt; was Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0205/24/lkl.00.html|title=Interview With Bill Maher|date=May 24, 2002|publisher=CNN|accessdate=January 17, 2008|quote= My mother is Jewish.

====''Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher''====
{{Main|Politically Incorrect}}
Maher assumed the host role on ''Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher'', a late-night political talk show that ran on Comedy Central from 1993 to 1997 and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1997 to 2002. The show regularly began with a topical monologue by Maher preceding the introduction of four guests, usually a diverse group of individuals, such as show business, popular culture, political pundits, political consultants, authors, and occasionally news figures. The group would discuss topical issues selected by Maher, who also participated in the discussions.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/27/arts/television-lots-of-political-humor-and-no-morton-kondracke.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/M/Maher,%20Bill |title = TELEVISION; Lots of Political Humor, and No Morton Kondracke|date = February 27, 1994 |newspaper = The New York Times | first=Bill| last=Carter |accessdate = August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerry Seinfeld]], a regular guest on the show, stated that ''Politically Incorrect'' reminded him of talk shows from the 1950s and '60s "when guests interacted with each other as much as with the host".&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

''Politically Incorrect'' won an array of awards, including an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Technical Direction, two [[CableACE]] awards for Best Talk Show Series, and a [[Genesis Award]] for Best Television Talk Show. Maher earned numerous award nominations for his producing, writing, and hosting of ''Politically Incorrect'', including ten [[Emmy]] nominations, two [[TV Guide]] nominations, and two [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]] nominations. ABC decided against renewing Maher's contract for ''Politically Incorrect'' in 2002, after he made a controversial on-air remark six days after the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebigstory.org/ov/ov-politicallyincorrect.html |title=The Big Story: Politically Incorrect |accessdate=June 19, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070713120522/http://thebigstory.org/ov/ov-politicallyincorrect.html| archivedate= July 13, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He agreed with his guest, conservative [[pundit (expert)|pundit]] [[Dinesh D'Souza]], that the 9/11 terrorists did not act in a cowardly manner (in rebuttal to [[George W. Bush|President Bush]]'s statement calling them cowards). Maher said, "We have been the cowards. Lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away. That's cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building. Say what you want about it. Not cowardly. You're right." Maher later clarified that his comment was not anti-military in any way whatsoever, referencing his well-documented longstanding support for the American military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Goldberg |first=Danny |authorlink= |title=It's a Free Country: Personal Freedom in America After September&amp;nbsp;11 |publisher=RDV Books |year=2002 |page=77 |isbn=0-9719206-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Garofoli |first=Joe |title=Talk host's towering rant: S.F. not worth saving |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/11/11/MNGFMFMNV41.DTL |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=October 9, 2007 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102175526/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2005%2F11%2F11%2FMNGFMFMNV41.DTL |archivedate=November 2, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving complaints, [[FedEx]] and [[Sears|Sears Roebuck]] pulled their advertisements from the show, costing the show significant revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Navasky |first=Victor |title=Profiles in Cowardice |url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20011105/navasky |newspaper=[[The Nation]] |accessdate=October 9, 2007 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090630183528/http%3A//www%2Ethenation%2Ecom/doc/20011105/navasky |archivedate=June 30, 2009 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjnUyVhccr4C&amp;pg=PA389 |title=Entertainment and Society: Influences, Impacts, and Innovations |last=Sayre |first=Shay |last2=King |first2=Cynthia |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2010 |edition=2 |isbn=9780203882931 |accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maher's remarks after 9/11 were not the first time he had sparked controversy on ''Politically Incorrect''. In the same year, he expressed his deep regrets and apologized after being widely criticized for comparing his dogs to retarded children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/18/us/tv-host-s-words-draw-criticism-and-apology.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=TV Host's Words Draw Criticism and Apology|date=January 18, 2001|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was canceled on June 16, 2002, and the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] had dropped the show from its [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-[[Network affiliate|affiliated]] stations months prior. On June 22, 2002, just six days after the cancellation of ''Politically Incorrect'', Maher received the Los Angeles Press Club president's award (for "championing free speech").&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; Maher was on the board of judges for the 2002 [[PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award]].&lt;ref&gt;Siems, Larry (April 11, 2002).

====''Real Time with Bill Maher''====
{{Main|Real Time with Bill Maher}}
In 2003, Maher became the host, co-producer, and co-writer of ''Real Time with Bill Maher'', a weekly hour-long political comedy talk show on the cable television network [[HBO]]. In 2016, HBO renewed ''Real Time'' through 2018, for its 15th and 16th seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prudom|first1=Laura|title=‘Real Time With Bill Maher’ Renewed Through 2018|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/real-time-with-bill-maher-renewed-season-15-16-1201827123/|accessdate=August 1, 2016|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During an interview, Maher told [[Terry Gross]] (on NPR's ''[[Fresh Air]]'') that he much prefers having serious and well-informed guests on his program, as opposed to the random celebrities that fleshed out his roundtable discussions on ''Politically Incorrect''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4490632|work=NPR|title=Bill Maher: Four More Years|date=February 8, 2005|accessdate=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with his previous show, ''Politically Incorrect'', Maher begins ''Real Time'' with a comic opening monologue based upon current events and other topical issues. He proceeds to a one-on-one interview with a guest, either in-studio or via satellite. Following the interview, Maher sits with two or three panelists, usually consisting of [[pundit (expert)|pundits]], authors, activists, actors, politicians, and journalists, for a discussion of the week's events.

''Real Time'' has earned widespread praise. It has been nominated for more than ten Primetime [[Emmy Awards]] and six [[Writers Guild of America|Writer's Guild]] awards. In 2007, Maher and his co-producers were awarded the Television Producer of the Year Award in Variety Television by the Producers Guild of America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.producersguild.org/?page=PGA_Award_19902010&amp;hhSearchTerms=PGA+and+Award+and+Winners+and+1990-2010 Producers Guild of America Awards – Winners 1990-2010]; PGA.org; May 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Maher holds the record for the most Emmy nominations without a win, having been nominated on 22 occasions and not winning once. Eleven of the nominations were for ''Politically Incorrect'', while nine were for ''Real Time''. The other two were nominations for two of his HBO comedy specials: ''[[I'm Swiss]]'' and ''[[Bill Maher: The Decider]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2009/07/will-emmys-biggest-loser-bill-maher-ever-win.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Gold Derby | date=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Notable responses to ''Real Time'' episodes=====
In late May 2005, Alabama Congressman [[Spencer Bachus]] sent a letter to [[Time Warner]]'s board of directors requesting ''Real Time'' be canceled after remarks Maher made after noting the military had missed its recruiting goals by 42 percent. Bachus said he felt the comments were demeaning to the military and treasonous. Maher stated his highest regard and support for the troops and asked why the congressman criticized him instead of doing something about the recruitment problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,157435,00.html |title=Bill Maher's Remark About Army 'Borders on Treason,' Lawmaker Says – Celebrity Gossip |publisher=FOX News |date=May 23, 2005 |accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 2010, Maher aired a clip of Delaware [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senatorial candidate [[Christine O'Donnell]] from the October 29, 1999 episode of his old show ''Politically Incorrect'' on his current show ''Real Time with Bill Maher'',&lt;ref name="McGreal2010-09-20"&gt;{{cite news|last=McGreal|first=Chris|title=Christine O'Donnell: I dabbled in witchcraft|date=September 20, 2010|work=The Guardian|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/20/christine-o-donnell-dabbled-witchcraft|accessdate=September 20, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922011030/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/20/christine-o-donnell-dabbled-witchcraft| archivedate= September 22, 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/bs-ae-arts-story-1119-20101118,0,6769640.story|title=Bill Maher celebrates the art of standup|first=Michael|last=Sragow |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she mentioned that she had "dabbled in witchcraft". This was one of the most notable of numerous controversial statements by O'Donnell that made her the most covered candidate in the 2010 mid-term election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalism.org/numbers_report/midterms’_media_mainstays The Midterms' Media Mainstays | Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2010/09/19/christine-odonnell-witchcraft-bill-maher|title=Christine O'Donnell, witchcraft, and Bill Maher: TV and politics put a hex on common sense|author=Ken Tucker|work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, Maher invited [[Milo Yiannopoulos]] to be interviewed on ''Real Time.'' Yiannopoulos accepted, despite protests from some commentators and fans. The appearance on Maher's show harmed Yannopoulos's career due to comments in the interview in which he seemed to express sympathy toward perpetrators of child sexual abuse. In the days following the interview, Yiannopoulos had his invitation to speak before the 2017 [[Conservative Political Action Conference]], as well as a book deal with [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], cancelled.

===Other work===
In 2004 Maher appeared on stage as Satan in [[The Steve Allen Theater]] production of "Hollywood Hell House", a spoof of the Christian-run [[hell house]]s. The show was a faithful reproduction of an evangelistic scare-experience written by Reverend Keenan Roberts to terrify teenagers into declaring themselves Christians. "Our faith is that putting this up as itself, it will hoist itself on its own petard, that it's comical just as it is," explained producer Maggie Rowe. The show featured a rotating cast of over 160 celebrities, including [[Andy Richter]] (Jesus), [[Richard Belzer]], [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]], [[Traci Lords]], [[Craig Bierko]], [[Sarah Silverman]], and [[Julia Sweeney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/aug/22/entertainment/ca-artsnotes22.3|title=Scared straight to Hollywood|first=Lynne|last=Heffley|date=August 22, 2004|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maher and director [[Larry Charles]] teamed up to make the movie ''[[Religulous]]'', described by trade publication ''Variety'' as a documentary "that spoofs religious extremism across the world". It was released on October 3, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Demara, Bruce. (September 10, 2007.) [https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/254761 "Maher preaches to the TIFF choir"]. ''[[The Toronto Star]]''.

Maher said this reportedly in response to Trump having previously challenged President [[Barack Obama]] to produce his birth certificate, and having offered $5 million payable to a charity of Obama's choice if Obama would produce his college applications, transcripts, and passport records.&lt;ref name="Allen6Feb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee1Nov"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nydailynews.com/news/election-2012/trump-puts-kibosh-5m-offer-obama-article-1.1195668|title=Trump puts kibosh on $5M offer to Obama|work=Daily News|location=New York|first=Kristen A.|last=Lee|date=November 1, 2012|accessdate=August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maher favors ending [[corporate welfare]] and federal funding of [[Non-profit organization|non-profits]] as well as the legalization of gambling, prostitution, and cannabis. Maher is a member of the advisory boards for both the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws|NORML]] and [[Marijuana Policy Project]], organizations that support regulated [[Legality of cannabis|legalization of cannabis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://norml.org/advisory-board|work=[[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]]|title=NORML Advisory Board|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mpp.org/vip/|work=[[Marijuana Policy Project]]|title=MPP Advisory Board|accessdate=March 22, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66ADLLlLM?url=http://www.mpp.org/vip/|archivedate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been called "one of the brightest torches for sensible marijuana policy" and "a contemporary cannabis statesman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-/weed-time-with-bill-maher_b_5128776.html|title=Weed Time With Bill Maher|work=The Huffington Post|date=2014-04-11|accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maher describes himself as an environmentalist, and he has spoken in favor of the [[Kyoto treaty]] on [[global warming]] on his show ''Real Time''.

Since the 9/11 attacks, he has endorsed certain uses of profiling at airports, saying that "Places like Israel, where they have faced terrorism for a long time, of course understand that profiling is part of all detective work.

He opposed the [[Iraq War]] from the beginning, and has summarized his opinion by saying that the United States and the world have had to pay too high a price for the war. He is skeptical of Iraq surviving without civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Modell|first=Josh|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/bill-maher,14307|title=Bill Maher &amp;#124; Film &amp;#124; Interview|publisher=''The A.V.

In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]], Maher announced his support for U.S. Senator [[Barack Obama]] (D-IL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/20080204_down_to_the_wire|title=Ear to the Ground – Down to the Wire|publisher=Truthdig|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Maher welcomed Obama's electoral victory, he subjected him to criticism after he took office for not acting more boldly on health care reform and other progressive issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/15/bill-maher-tells-olberman_n_215964.html|work=Huffington Post|title=Bill Maher Tells Olbermann Why He's Criticizing Obama|date=June 15, 2009|first=Marcus|last=Baram |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2012, after his 'Crazy Stupid Politics' special streamed on Yahoo! Screen, Maher announced that he was contributing $1 million to Priorities USA, the Obama SuperPAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screen.yahoo.com/crazystupidpolitics|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120224193941/http://screen.yahoo.com/crazystupidpolitics|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 24, 2012|title=CrazyStupidPolitics: Bill Maher Live on Yahoo!

On the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], Maher says he is "more on the side of the Israelis" and doesn't consider both sides equally guilty. He acknowledges that "Palestinians do have gripes", and he has been critical of U.S. financial aid to Israel, saying "they don't need our money, they can handle it themselves." Maher also notes that most Israelis would prefer a two-state solution and oppose the hard-line stance of their Israeli government, which he describes as having been taken over by their version of the Tea Party. However, Maher has defended Israel's military actions against Palestinian militants amid criticism over civilian deaths and disproportionate casualty count between Israelis and Palestinians during the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict|2014 Gaza war]]. He argues that Israel is still showing restraint, and he finds it ironic that the same people who were incredulous over how the Jews in World War II were led "to their slaughter", can't understand why they are defending themselves now.&lt;ref name="Jewish Journal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaite.com/tv/%E2%80%98people-die-in-wars%E2%80%99-maher-and-guests-battle-over-gaza-civilian-deaths/ Bill Maher Defends Israel Again: 'People Die in Wars], Mediaite, August 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Maher is a gun owner, and explained in his February 12, 2013 appearance on the late night TV talk show ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'' that he owns guns for personal home protection. However, he does not identify himself as a "proud" gun owner, commenting that being a proud gun owner is akin to "saying I'm a 'proud remote control owner'". Maher has stated that statistics showing that gun owners are more likely to harm a member of their household are caused by irresponsible gun owners, and believes that tragedies such as school shootings will not lead to fundamental change in gun laws because both [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] favor guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Walls Have Ears, and Other Side Effects of This Medication|series=[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]|season=3|number=45|airdate=February 12, 2013|network=[[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2013, Bill Maher expressed on his show limited support for the [[National Security Agency|NSA's]] [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] intelligence data collection from private phone calls and the Internet, saying that the threat of terrorists obtaining and using nuclear weapons was the tipping point for him. While he stated that he trusted the Obama administration to employ the program responsibly, he described the NSA's access to private data as a "slippery slope", and worried about whether other politicians would be as responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Garcia, Arturo|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/06/07/maher-defends-nsa-data-searches-its-not-because-im-brave-but-because-im-scared|title=Maher defends NSA data searches: It's not because I'm brave, but because I'm scared|publisher=[[The Raw Story]]|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the leadup to the 2014 midterm elections, Maher conducted a "Flip a District" contest on his HBO show. His audience was asked to select one "terrible, entrenched" member of Congress in a close election race—"the loserest loser of all"—to remove from office. Maher aimed to help oust that representative by shining a "national spotlight" on the politician during segments of his show and stand-up comedy appearances in that member's district during the Fall election.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/arts/television/maher-wants-his-show-to-decide-a-house-race.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-thecaucus&amp;_r=1 Maher Wants His Show to Decide a House Race]; New York Times; Bill Carter; January 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.real-time-with-bill-maher-blog.com/index/2014/1/31/test Flip a District]; Real Time with Bill Maher; June 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maher endorsed [[Maine Question 1, 2014|a 2014 Maine referendum]] to ban the use of bait, traps, and dogs to hunt bears in Maine. He specifically criticized the use of bait, referring to its use as "nothing but an execution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Bangor Daily News]]|url=http://stateandcapitol.bangordailynews.com/2014/09/15/famous-talk-show-host-bill-maher-endorses-referendum-to-ban-bear-baiting|title=Famous talk show host Bill Maher endorses referendum to ban bear baiting|date=September 15, 2014|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]], Maher initially endorsed Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] on February 5, 2016. Maher later announced his support for [[Hillary Clinton]] after Sanders had lost the Democratic Party primary elections.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://observer.com/2016/07/bill-maher-im-with-her-or-im-with-stupid/ Bill Maher: 'I'm With Her' or 'I'm With Stupid']".

===Religion===
{{See also|Religulous}}
Maher is highly [[Criticism of religion|critical of all religion]] and views it as highly destructive. He has been described, or self-identified, variously as an agnostic, [[Atheism|atheist]], and [[Apatheism|apatheist]], while objecting to having his views defined by a single label. In his 2008 feature film ''[[Religulous]]'', he refers to himself as agnostic.&lt;ref&gt;Holden, Stephen (September 30, 2008). [https://movies.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/movies/01reli.html "Believers, Skeptics and a Pool of Sitting Ducks"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; He has rejected being grouped with explicit atheists, saying in 2002, "I'm not an atheist. There's a really big difference between an atheist and someone who just doesn't believe in religion. Religion to me is a bureaucracy between man and God that I don't need, but I'm not an atheist, no."&lt;ref name=AVClub&gt;Thompson, Stephen (October 9, 2002). [http://www.avclub.com/articles/is-there-a-god,1413/ "Is There a God?"]. ''[[The A.V.

When discussing his apatheism and his views on the existence of God, he said on a scale from 1 to 7 (7 being "absolutely certain there is no god"), he was only at 6.9, like [[Richard Dawkins]], "because we just don't know ... but we just don't think about it." He added, "There's atheist and there's agnostic, and I'm okay with us not splitting the difference on those; if you are just not a super-religious person, you are on my team."&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;[http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/07/12/maher-on-religion "Bill Maher explains his 'apatheism,' apathetic atheism"].

[...] believe it or not, I don't really enjoy talking about religion all the time. In fact, not only is atheism not a religion, it's not even my hobby, and that's the best thing about being an atheist.

In defense of his criticism of Islam, Sharia law and Muslim culture, Maher says he is "... someone who believes in the values that Western people believe in that a lot of the Muslim world does not. Like separation of church and state. Like equality of the sexes. Like respect for minorities, free elections, free speech, freedom to gather. These things are not just different from cultures that don't have them.... It's better ... I would like to keep those values here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/bill-maher-stands-by-mohammed-remarks-i-dont-need-to-apologize-for-being-a-proud-westerner|title=Bill Maher Stands By Mohammed Remarks: 'I Don't Need To Apologize For Being A Proud Westerner'|publisher=Mediaite|date=November 1, 2010|accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing studies and poll results by [[Pew Research Center]], the [[World Economic Forum]] and others, Maher says the human rights violations and "illiberal ideas" found in Islam are not extremist views held by a small minority, but are supported by a majority of citizens in Muslim countries. Maher has criticized liberals as hypocritical for defending these core liberal values and ideals only at home, while not condemning the oppression of these values and groups in Muslim culture.&lt;ref name="VF1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sasson|first1=Eric|title=Yes, Bill Maher Is Boorish.

"I'm just shining a light on the reality of the situation. I don't even understand why this is so controversial."&lt;ref name="VF1"/&gt;

Maher received the 2009 [[Richard Dawkins Award]] from [[Atheist Alliance International]].&lt;ref&gt;Timonen, Josh (September 28, 2009).

===Health care===
Maher has stated that the [[American Medical Association]] is a powerful lobbying group and one of the primary reasons why the United States had failed to enact health care reform.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;(2009-06-15). {{YouTube|wJ2L1aQy-io|Keith Olbermann: Bill Maher Talks About Taking On Obama}}.{{Dead link|date=July 2011}} Countdown With Keith Olbermann.

"Forget getting the sixty votes or sixty percent—sixty percent of people don't believe in evolution in this country—he just needs to drag them to it, like I said, they're stupid; get health care done, with or without them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV Media|url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/bill-maher-pt2-082409/1149697|title=Bill Maher Part 2|work=The Tonight Show|accessdate=October 18, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830072642/http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/bill-maher-pt2-082409/1149697|archivedate=August 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] in a televised debate with [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], Maher said that "if Jesus was in charge of the country we'd probably have health care for everybody."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/bill-maher-on-the-factor-part-ii-the-two-bills-clash-on-religion|title=Bill Maher On ''The Factor'', Part II: The Two Bills Clash On Religion|date=September 30, 2010|last=Davis|first=Glenn|publisher=Mediaite|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maher has expressed the view that a lot of illness is the result of poor diet and lack of exercise, and that medicine is often not the most appropriate way of addressing illness. In an episode of his show about the 2008 presidential candidates' health plans, Maher stated that poor nutrition is a primary cause of illness, and that "the answer isn't another pill."&lt;ref&gt;''Real Time with Bill Maher''; [https://web.archive.org/web/20071015061830/http://hbo.com/billmaher/new_rules/20070928.html September 28, 2007]; HBO&lt;/ref&gt; He also has said: "If you believe you need to take all the pills the pharmaceutical industry says you do, then you're already on drugs!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winhs.org|publisher=WINHS, World Institute of Natural Health Sciences|title=Home|accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has expressed his distaste for the [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] and health care industries in general, on the grounds that they make their money out of treating people who are made sick by consuming [[junk food|unhealthy food]] that corporations urge upon the public. He maintains that mass consumption of [[high-fructose corn syrup]] is a contributor to the rise in frequency of [[obesity in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0409/13/lkl.00.html Larry King Live – Interview With Bill Maher]; CNN; September 13, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In a discussion with [[Michael Moore]] about the film ''[[Sicko]]'', Maher said, "The human body is pretty amazing; it doesn't get sick, usually, for no reason. I mean, there's some genetic stuff that can get to you, but, basically, people are sick in this country because they're poisoned. The environment is a poisoning factor, but also, we gotta say, they poison themselves. They eat shit. People eat shit, and that's, to my way of thinking, about 90 percent of why people are sick, is because they eat shit."&lt;ref&gt;Kerry Trueman, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kerry-trueman/maher-and-moore-chew-out-_b_50004.html Maher and Moore Chew (Out) the Fat]; ''The Huffington Post''; May 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tara Parker-Pope]] and former Senator (R-TN) Dr. [[Bill Frist]], a physician, have called his criticism of the [[2009 flu pandemic vaccine|H1N1 flu vaccinations]] unscientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/13/bill-maher-vs-the-flu-vaccine|work=The New York Times|first=Tara|last=Parker-Pope|date=October 13, 2009|title=Bill Maher vs. the Flu Vaccine|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infectious diseases expert [[Paul Offit]] has written that misinformation about vaccines from celebrities like Maher has put children at unnecessary risk. Offit says that celebrities like Maher are seen as "less credible" and would still be considered just "great entertainment" if they weren't joined by the former Director of the [[National Institutes of Health]], Dr. [[Bernadine Healy]] and influential pediatrician, [[Robert Sears (physician)|Dr. Robert Sears]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Offit|first=Paul|title=Deadly Choices: How the Anti-Vaccine Movement Threatens us all |publisher=Basic Books|authorlink=Paul Offit|pages=168–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I'm not a germ theory denier. I believe vaccinations can work. Polio is a good example. Do I think in certain situations that inoculating Third World children against malaria or diphtheria, or whatever, is right? Of course. In a situation like that, the benefits outweigh costs. But to me living in Los Angeles? To get a flu shot? No."&lt;ref&gt;Slotek, Jim (October 28, 2009). [http://www.winnipegsun.com/entertainment/tv/2009/10/28/11548266-sun.html "Needling Bill Maher"].

===Views on 9/11 conspiracy theories===
Maher has been a critic of [[9/11 conspiracy theories]]. On October 19, 2007, Maher confronted several [[9/11 Truth movement|9/11 truthers]] and had them ejected from his show audience after they interrupted the live show numerous times by calling out from the audience. The incident drew significant media attention and praise from Fox News talk show host and frequent critic [[John Gibson (political commentator)|John Gibson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,304240,00.html|title=Hat's Off to Bill Maher|date=October 22, 2007|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=January 17, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225170927/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C304240%2C00.html|archivedate=December 25, 2007|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, he began dating former Playboy Cyber Girl [[Coco Johnsen]]. In November 2004, at the end of their 17-month relationship, Johnsen sued Maher for US$9 million for "pain and suffering" for alleged "insulting, humiliating and degrading racial comments". Her suit stated that Maher promised to marry her and father her children, support her financially and buy a house in Beverly Hills.

When commentators suggested there was a pattern to his dating because both his girlfriend and former girlfriend were black, Maher said, "People say I'm into black women.

I'm just into women who are real, and they happen to be black."&lt;ref name="savvy"/&gt; From 2009-11, Maher dated former adjunct professor, [[science education|science educator]], and current ''[[Skeptics' Guide to the Universe]]'' co-host [[Cara Santa Maria]].&lt;ref name=DailyNews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intouchweekly.com/2011/03/bill_maher.php "Bill Maher &amp; Cara Santa Maria Split"], ''[[InTouch Weekly]]'', March 21, 2011. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906155003/http://www.intouchweekly.com/2011/03/bill_maher.php|date=September 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Maher was dating [[Ontario]]-born singer [[Anjulie|Anjulie Persaud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1224401/toronto-mayor-rob-ford-gets-support-from-bill-maher|title=Bill Maher supports Rob Ford|publisher=[[Global News]]|date=March 22, 2014|first=John|last=Kennedy|accessdate=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:P1010956 temple bouddhiste Lerab Ling et la vallee.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Lerab Ling]], in [[Montpellier]], [[Languedoc-Roussillon]].]]
[[Buddhism]] is the fourth largest religion in [[France]], after [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]].

France has over two hundred [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] meditation centers, including about twenty sizable retreat centers in rural areas. The Buddhist population mainly consists of [[China|Chinese]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], and [[Koreans|Korean]] immigrants, with a substantial minority of native French converts and "sympathizers." The rising popularity of Buddhism in France has been the subject of considerable discussion in the French media and academy in recent years.

==Demographics==

In the early 1990s, the [[French Buddhist Union]] (UBF, founded in 1986) estimated there to be 600,000 to 650,000 Buddhists in France, with 150,000 French converts among them.&lt;ref name="globalbuddhism.org"&gt;Obadia, Lionel (2001). [http://www.globalbuddhism.org/jgb/index.php/jgb/article/view/30/38 Tibetan Buddhism in France: A Missionary Religion?], Journal of Global Buddhism 2, 92-109&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, sociologist [[Frédéric Lenoir]] estimated there are 10,000 converts and up to 5 million "sympathizers," although other researchers have questioned these numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Lenoir, Frédéric. Le bouddhisme en France.Paris: Fayard, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; A 1997 opinion poll counted as sympathizers young people who feel "an intellectual affinity with Buddhism or expressed a sympathy to a Buddhist worldview."&lt;ref&gt;Opinion poll conducted by CSA La vie RTL: "Dieu intéresse-t-il les jeunes?" published in La vie, no. 2691, 27 March-2 April 1997, 18-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Alexandra David-Néel]] was an important early French Buddhist. She is best known for her 1924 visit to the forbidden (to foreigners) city of [[Lhasa]], capital of [[Tibet]], and wrote more than 30 books about Buddhism, philosophy, and her travels. In 1911 Alexandra traveled to India, to further her study of Buddhism. She was invited to the royal monastery of [[Sikkim]], where she met Maharaj Kumar (crown prince) Sidkeon Tulku. She became Sidkeong's "confidante and spiritual sister" (according to Ruth Middleton), and perhaps his lover (Foster &amp; Foster). She also met the thirteenth [[Dalai Lama]] twice in 1912, and had the opportunity to ask him many questions about Buddhism&amp;mdash;a feat unprecedented for a European woman at that time.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Buddhist teachers of various traditions began to visit France, as detailed below.

==Zen Buddhist communities==

[[Taisen Deshimaru]] was a Japanese [[Zen Buddhist]] who founded numerous [[zendo]]s in France. [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] [[Vietnam]]ese-born Zen Buddhist nominated for the  [[Nobel Peace Prize]] by [[Martin Luther King]], founded the [[Unified Buddhist Church]] (Eglise Bouddhique Unifiée) in France in 1969. [[Plum Village]], a monastery and retreat center in the [[Dordogne]] in southern France, is his residence and the headquarters of his international [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]].
[[File:Temple des 1000 Boudhas 2.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Temple of One Thousand Buddhas]], in [[La Boulaye]], [[Saône-et-Loire]], [[Burgundy (French region)|Burgundy]].]]

==Tibetan Buddhist communities==
By the late 1990s, it has been estimated that there are more than 140 [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] meditation centers in France. The first Tibetan Buddhist communities in France were established in the early 1970s. The highest-ranking head of schools to reside in France, [http://sakya-ngor.org/ H.E. Phendé Khenchen], established his temple of E Wam Phendé Ling in 1973. He is of the [[Ngor]] school of Buddhism. Buddhism in France's growth was catalyzed by visits, in 1975  of the [[Karmapa]] , head of the Kagyü school, [[Dudjom Rinpoche]] and [[Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]], also very high lamas, who visited [[Dordogne]], where they established retreat centers with the help of [[Pema Wangyal Rinpoche]]. [[Pema Wangyal Rinpoche]] is the son of [[Kangyur Rinpoche]], another high lama who was among the first to take western disciples. Dudjom Rinpoche later moved to France, where he passed away.

[[Kalu Rinpoche]], also a highly esteemed lama, visited France in 1971, 1972 and 1974 &lt;ref&gt;Kalu Rinpoche: Excellent Buddhism: An Exemplary Life, Clear Point Press 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1976 led the first traditional three-year retreat for westerners in France. In the [[Kagyu]] lineage such retreats confer the title "lama" on those who complete them. It is estimated that sixty percent of the centers and monasteries in France are affiliated with the Kagyu school.&lt;ref name="globalbuddhism.org"/&gt;
1982 the [[Dalai Lama]] visted France.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dalailama.com/the-dalai-lama/events-and-awards/travels/travels-1980-1989&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are about twenty retreat centres representing all the different schools  as well as many town-based centres which are under the direction of great Tibetan Buddhist masters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lerabling.org/index.php?pid=77

Monasticism has traditionally been the bedrock of Tibetan Buddhism, but there were only a few dozen ordained French monks and nuns until the mid-1990s. However, there are now at least 300, most of whom were trained at the two monasteries in Auvergne.&lt;ref name="wwrn.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=14098&amp;sec=52&amp;con=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185000/http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=14098&amp;sec=52&amp;con=2|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-09-30|title="Buddhism in France is booming," World Wide Religion Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous French monk in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition is [[Matthieu Ricard]], a longtime student of Dilgo Khyenste Rinpoche who is the son of famous philosopher [[Jean-Francois Revel]]. He has published books on Buddhism which have contributed to interest in Buddhism and French Buddhists among the [[intelligentsia]].

==Media and national interest==
"Wisdom of Buddhism", a weekly French TV program, draws about 250,000 viewers, according to the Buddhist Union of France.&lt;ref name="wwrn.org" /&gt;

Philosopher [[Luc Ferry]], appointed Minister of Youth and Education in 2002, published an article in Le Point magazine in which he asked, "Why this Buddhist wave? And why particularly in France, a very Catholic country in the past? ... In this time of de-Christianization, Buddhism has furnished to the West a rich and interesting alternative."&lt;ref name="wwrn.org" /&gt;

In the 19th century, the British first brought Hindus from India to Australia to work on cotton and sugar [[plantations]]. Many remained as small businessmen, working as camel drivers, merchants and [[Hawker (trade)|hawkers]], selling goods between small rural communities. These days Hindus are well educated professionals in fields such as medicine, engineering, commerce and information technology, constituting a [[model minority]]. The Hindus in Australia are mostly of [[Hinduism in India|Indian]], [[Hinduism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan]], [[Hinduism in Fiji|Fijian]], [[Hinduism in Malaysia|Malaysia]], [[Hinduism in Singapore|Singapore]], [[Hinduism in Nepal|Nepali]], and [[Hinduism in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]] origin, with some originating from other parts of the [[Indian subcontinent]] including [[Sindh]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} 

The majority of Australian Hindus live along the [[Geography of Australia|Eastern Coast]] of Australia and are mainly located in the cities of [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]]. According to the {{CensusAU|2016}}, the Hindu population numbered 440,310 individuals, of whom 39% lived in Greater [[Sydney]], 29% in Greater [[Melbourne]], and 8% each in Greater [[Brisbane]] and Greater [[Perth]]. The states and territories with the highest proportion of Hindus are the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (2.57%) and [[New South Wales]] (2.43%), whereas those with the lowest are [[Queensland]] (0.98%) and [[Tasmania]] (0.50%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Census TableBuilder - Dataset: 2016 Census - Cultural Diversity |url=https://guest.censusdata.abs.gov.au/webapi/jsf/tableView/tableView.xhtml|work=Australian Bureau of Statistics – Census 2016|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a community Hindus live relatively peacefully and in harmony with the local populations. They have established a number of temples and other religious meeting places and celebrate most [[Hindu festivals]].

During [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] [[United States|America]], a '''hush harbor''' (or hush arbor, brush harbor or brush arbor) was a place where slaves would gather in secret to practice religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aGGdyAlobAEC|title=Slave Missions and the Black Church in the Antebellum South|last=Cornelius|first=Janet Duitsman|date=1999-01-01|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=9781570032479|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Religion grew to become a highly respected part of slave life. It offered the enslaved hope and reassurance. Slaves were forced to organize and conduct these meetings in secret because the idea of slaves assembling without supervision left the owners in fear. The meetings were held after dark, once [[field slave|field]] and [[house slave|house]] chores were completed, and carried on late into the night.

[[Christianity]] was the prominent religion forced on the African Slaves after being transported to the Americas. After being exposed to Christian ideas, the slaves began to understand them more. Slaves discovered promising stories and passages in the [[Bible]] that offered hope. The story of [[Jesus Christ]] suffering on the cross drew attention because of the similar, harsh treatment they both received.

The hush harbors served as the location where slaves could combine their African religious traditions with Christianity. It was safe to freely blend the [[religious Syncretism|components of each religion]] in these meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Space-Architecture-Representation-Identity/dp/1941332137|title=Dark Space: Architecture, Representation, Black Identity|last=Gooden|first=Mario|date=2016-02-23|publisher=Columbia Books on Architecture and the City|isbn=9781941332139|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slaves could let go of all their hardships and express their emotions. Here is where [[Negro spirituals]] originated. The songs created by slaves were known to contain a double meaning, revealing the ideas of religious salvation and freedom from slavery. The meetings would also include practices such as dance. African [[Ring shout|shouts]] and rhythms were also included.

Slaves would suffer severe punishments had they been [[Slave patrol|caught in a hush harbor meeting]]. Slave owners were confident that they would compare [[Treatment of slaves in the United States|treatment, working conditions, and punishments]], leaving them worried about [[slave revolt|revolts]] and riots. The most common price would be a whipping. African American churches taught that all people were equal in God's eyes and viewed the doctrine of obedience to one's master taught in white churches as hypocritical. Instead the African American church focused on the message of equality and hopes for a better future.&lt;ref&gt;http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/nineteen/nkeyinfo/aareligion.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2213">{{Expand Italian|Italo|date=September 2016}}
'''Italus''' or '''Italos''' (from {{Lang-grc|Ἰταλός}}) was a legendary king of the [[Oenotrians]], who were among the earliest inhabitants of [[Italy]]. In his ''Fabularum Liber'' (or ''Fabulae''), [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]] recorded the myth that Italus was a son of [[Penelope]] and [[Telegonus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Telegonus|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite|year=2014|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Aristotle]] ([[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]])&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D7%3Asection%3D1329b#note-link2 7.1329b], on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thucydides]] ([[History of the Peloponnesian War]]),&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''The Peloponnesian War'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+6.2.4&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 6.2.4], on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; Italus was the [[eponym]] of Italy (''[[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]]''). Aristotle relates that, according to tradition, Italus converted the Oenotrians from a pastoral society to an agricultural one and gave them various ordinances, being the first to institute their system of common meals.

Writing centuries later, the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] in his ''Rhomaike Archaiologia'' (''Antiquitates romanae'', "Roman Antiquities"), cites [[Antiochus of Syracuse]] for the information that Italus was an Oenotrian by birth and relates the tradition that Italia was named after him, as well as another account that derives the name "Italia" from a word for calf,&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, ''Roman Antiquities'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/1B*.html 1.35], on LacusCurtius&lt;/ref&gt; an etymology also stated by [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]], [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]],&lt;ref&gt;''Rerum Rusticarum'', 2.5&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]].

{{Zoroastrianism}}
The '''Kayanians''', also '''Kays''', '''Kayanids''' or '''Kaianids''', or '''Kiani''', are a semi-mythological dynasty of Persian tradition and folklore which supposedly ruled after the [[Pishdadian dynasty|Pishdadids]], and before the historical [[Achaemenids]]. Considered collectively, the Kayanian kings are the heroes of the [[Avesta]], the sacred texts of [[Zoroastrianism]], and of the ''[[Shahnameh]]'', [[Iran]]'s national epic. 

As an epithet of kings and the reason the dynasty is so called, [[Middle Persian|Middle]] 𐭪𐭣 and [[Persian language|New Persian]] کی ''kay(an)'' originates from [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''𐬐𐬀𐬎𐬎𐬌‎'' ''[[Rishi|kavi]]'' (or ''kauui'') "king" and also "poet-sacrificer"&lt;!-- so Skjaervo's gloss --&gt; or "poet-priest".&lt;!-- Bailey, Arya IV, p.79 --&gt; The word is also etymologically related to the Avestan notion of ''[[khvarenah|kavaēm kharēno]]'', the "divine royal glory" that the Kayanian kings were said to hold. The [[Kiani Crown]] is a physical manifestation of that belief.

==In scripture==
The earliest known foreshadowing of the major legends of the Kayanian kings appears in the [[Yasht|''Yashts'']] of the [[Avesta]], where the dynasts offer sacrifices to the gods in order to earn their support and to gain strength in the perpetual struggle against their enemies, the [[Aniran|''Anaryas'']] (non-Aryans, sometimes identified as the [[Turan]]ians).

In ''Yasht'' 5, 9.25, 17.45-46, Haosravah, a Kayanian king later known as [[Kai Khosrow|Kay Khosrow]], together with [[Zoroaster]] and [[Jamasp]] (a premier of Zoroaster's patron [[Vishtaspa]], another Kayanian king) worship in [[Airyanem Vaejah]]. The account tells that King Haosravah united the various [[Aryan]] ([[Iranian peoples|Iranian]]) tribes into one nation (''Yasht'' 5.49, 9.21, 15.32, 17.41).

==In tradition and folklore==
Towards the end of the [[Sassanid]] period, [[Khosrow II]] (590-628, named after the Kay Khosrow of legend) ordered a compilation of the legends surrounding the Kayanians. The result was the ''Khwaday-Namag'' or "Book of Lords," a long historiography of the Iranian nation from the primordial [[Gayomart]] to the reign of Khosrow II, with events arranged according to the perceived sequence of kings and queens, fifty in number.

The compilation may have been prompted by concern over deteriorating national spirit. There were disastrous [[Extreme weather events of 535–536|global climate changes of 535-536]] and the [[Plague of Justinian]] to contend with and the Iranians would have found much-needed solace in the collected legends of their past. 

Following the collapse of the Sassanid Empire and the subsequent rise of Islam, the Kayanian legends fell out of favour until the first revival of Iranian culture under the [[Samanid]]s. Together with the folklore preserved in the Avesta, the ''Khwaday-Namag'' served as the foundation of other epic collections in prose, such as those commissioned by Abu Mansur Abd al-Razzaq, the texts of which have since been lost. The Samanid-sponsored revival also led to the resurgence of Zoroastrian literature, such as the [[Denkard]], book 7.1 of which is also a historiography of Kayanians. The best known work of the genre is however Firdowsi's [[Shahnameh]] "[[Book of Kings (Firdusi)]]", which - though drawing on earlier works - is entirely in verse.

'''Kenneth L. Gentry, Jr.''' (3 May 1950) is a [[Calvinism|Reformed]] [[theologian]],  and an ordained minister in the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church General Assembly]]. He is particularly known for his support for and publication on the topics of [[orthodox preterism]] and [[postmillennialism]] in [[Christian eschatology]], as well as for [[theonomy]] and six-day creation. He holds that each of these theological distinctives are logical and theological extensions of his foundational theology, which is Calvinistic and Reformed.

==Biography==
Gentry was born in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. He is married (since July 1971) and has three children and six grandchildren.

He received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Biblical Studies]] from [[Tennessee Temple University]] (1973, cum laude). After graduating he enrolled at [[Grace Theological Seminary]] in [[Winona Lake, Indiana]]. After two years at Grace Seminary (1973–1975) he left [[dispensationalism]], having become convinced of a [[Covenant Theology|covenant]] and [[Reformed theology]]. He transferred to [[Reformed Theological Seminary]] in [[Jackson, Mississippi]] (1975–1977). Upon completing studies at [[Reformed Theological Seminary]] he was awarded the [[Master of Divinity|M.Div.]] in 1977. After several years of pastoral ministry, he earned a [[Master of Theology|Th.M.]] (1986) and a [[Doctor of Theology|Th.D.]] (1987, magna cum laude) from [[Whitefield Theological Seminary]], both in the field of [[New Testament]].

While at Reformed Theological Seminary he studied under [[Greg L. Bahnsen]], a leading [[presuppositional apologetics|presuppositional apologist]]. Though Gentry initially resisted the distinctive ethical and eschatological views of Bahnsen, he was eventually persuaded of both theonomic ethics and postmillennial eschatology and became a staunch co-defender of them with Bahnsen. Over the years he developed a close friendship with Bahnsen, often lecturing with him in conferences, co-writing a book with him (''House Divided: The Break-up of Dispensational Theology''), eventually joining the staff of Bahnsen's Southern California Center for Christian Studies, and finally contributing to the [[festschrift]] in honor of Bahnsen, titled: ''The Standard Bearer.''

Gentry retired from full-time pastoral ministry in 2015 after serving thirty-five years in three conservative and Reformed denominations: The Presbyterian Church in America, The Orthodox Presbyterian Church, and The Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Assembly. He is the Director of GoodBirth Ministries, a non-profit religious educational ministry, "committed to sponsoring, subsidizing, and advancing serious Christian scholarship and education" (GoodBirth website: www.GoodBirthMinistries.com).

==Writings==
Gentry is the leading contemporary theological expositor of the first century for the date when the Apostle John's Revelation content preponderantly transpired. The first century tribulation paradigm is a profoundly different eschatology than that held by most American evangelical Christians that the tribulation and rapture haven't yet occurred.

Kenneth Gentry's works ''[[The Beast of Revelation]]'' and ''[[He Shall Have Dominion]]'' attempt to explain the identity of the Beast and what God's true redemptive plan for humanity are. Gentry's work is considered by his followers to be important for soteriological reasons.

Gentry's work enfilades the error of much contemporary Christian pre-trib eschatology, also serving to argue that incorrect interpretation of the Bible is possible even by sincere experts.

Gentry is perhaps best known for his book ''[[Before Jerusalem Fell]]'', which argues that the [[Book of Revelation]] was written before the [[destruction of Jerusalem]] in 70 AD. He holds that many of the dramatic events in Revelation correspond to the persecution of Christians under the [[Roman empire|Roman imperium]] as well as to the [[First Jewish-Roman War|Jewish War against Rome]] which resulted in the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jewish temple]]. This book is the published version of his doctoral dissertation in 1986 under the title "The Dating of the Book of Revelation: An Exegetical, Theological and Historical Argument for a Pre-A.D. 70 Composition."

===Revelation commentary===
Gentry has completed a two-volume academic [[bible commentary|commentary]] on Revelation titled: ''The Divorce of Israel: A Redemptive-Historical Interpretation''. It is currently being proofed and typeset by Tolle Lege Press and is scheduled for release in 2018. According to preliminary studies he has released ("The Wrath of God and Israel", Fountain Inn, SC: 2007), he will be presenting evidence that "[[Babylon (New Testament)|Babylon]]" ({{bibleverse||Rev.|16:19-19:2}}) is a metaphor for 1st century Jerusalem, and that the book's author [[John of Patmos|John]] is following the pattern of the [[Old Testament]] [[prophet]]s in denouncing [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem's]] unfaithfulness by such images (see especially {{bibleverse||Jer.|2-3}} and {{bibleverse||Ez.|16}}).

Gentry holds that the theme of Revelation is [[Jesus|Christ's]] judgment coming against those who pierced him ({{bibleverse||Rev|1:7}}), and presents the "slain Lamb" ({{bibleverse||Rev|5:8,13}}; etc.) as wreaking vengeance upon 1st-century Jerusalem. He argues that the seven-sealed scroll is God's [[divorce]] decree against his unfaithful Old Testament wife (Israel) so that he might take a new bride, the Church (Rev. 21-22). Thus, Revelation dramatizes the transition from the old covenant, [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]]-based, [[Jew|Judaic]] economy to the [[New Covenant]], spiritual economy that includes all ethnicities, not just Jews (compare [[supersessionism]]).

According to his research updates, Gentry sees strong similarities between Revelation and the Epistle to the Hebrews. Both works seek to demonstrate Christianity's superiority to Judaism by showing [[New Covenant]] Christianity supplanting [[Old Covenant]] Judaism (Heb. 8:13; Rev. 2:9; 3:9; 11:1-2). He notes that both documents even end up pointing the reader to the [[New Jerusalem]] from heaven (Heb.12:22; Rev. 21:2), which represents Christianity. He also draws parallels in thought between the Gospel of Matthew and Revelation. He sees evidence for this in Matthew's strong imagery regarding old covenant Judaism's demise in the [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|rise of Christianity]] (Matt. 8:10-12; 21:33-46; 22:1-13; 23:29-38).

{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Kriyananda''' (born '''James Donald Walters'''; May 19, 1926, [[Azuga]] – April 21, 2013, [[Assisi]]) was a direct disciple of the [[yogi]] [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] and the founder of Ananda, a worldwide movement of spiritual intentional communities based on Yogananda's [[World Brotherhood Colonies]] ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.swamikriyananda.org/| title = Kriyananda - Official Website | accessdate = 1 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=April 2013}} Yogananda made Walters a minister for his organization, the [[Self-Realization Fellowship]] (SRF). He authorized him to teach [[Kriya Yoga]] while with SRF, and appointed him the head monk for the SRF Mount Washington monks only. {{third-party-inline|date=April 2013}} After Yogananda's death, Walters was given final vows of [[Sannyasa|sannyas]] in 1955 by then SRF President Daya Mata and given the name Kriyananda.  In 1960, upon the passing of M.W. Lewis, the SRF Board of Directors elected Kriyananda to the Board of Directors and to the position of Vice President. In 1962, the SRF Board of Directors voted unanimously to request his resignation.&lt;ref name="path" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last= |title=Self-Realization Magazine|year=1949–1960|location=Los Angeles, California |publisher= Self-Realization Fellowship |ISSN= 0037-1564 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kriyananda is the author of about 150 published books/booklets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;PAGE=First| title = Library of Congress | accessdate = 1 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=&amp;qt=owc_search| title = World Cat (OCLC) | accessdate = 1 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the composer of over 400 pieces of music, which altogether have sold over three million copies.

==Biography==

===Early life===
J. Donald Walters was born on May 19, 1926, in [[Teleajen]], [[Romania]] to American parents, Ray P. and Gertrude G. Walters. His father was an oil geologist with the [[Esso Corporation]] (since renamed [[Exxon]] in the United States) who was then assigned to the Romanian oilfields. He received an international education in Romania, Switzerland, England, and the United States. He attended [[Haverford College]] and [[Brown University]], leaving the latter with only a semester left before graduation to dedicate his life to searching for God.&lt;ref name="path"&gt;Swami Kriyananda, ''The New Path - My Life with Paramhansa Yogananda''. (Crystal Clarity Publishers, 2009). {{ISBN|978-1-56589-242-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time with Yogananda===
In September 1948, in New York, Walters read Yogananda's ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]'', a book he says transformed his life. By September 12, Walters had decided to leave his old life behind, and soon afterwards traveled cross-country by bus to southern California to become one of Yogananda's disciples. In Hollywood, California, Walters first met Yogananda at the Self-Realization Fellowship temple there and was accepted as a disciple.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

As recounted in his autobiography, ''The New Path'',&lt;ref name="path" /&gt; Walters, twenty-two years old at this point, took up residence with other monks at SRF's mother center headquarters located on top of [[Mount Washington, Los Angeles]]. A year later, Yogananda had put Walters in charge of the monks there, asked him to write articles for the SRF magazine, had him lecture at various SRF centers,&lt;ref name="path " /&gt; ordained him a minister, and appointed him to initiate students into Kriya Yoga.&lt;ref name="path" /&gt; In their three and one half years (9/1948–3/1952) together, Walters took extensive notes of his many conversations with his master, which he later published in ''The Essence of Self-Realization''&lt;ref name="essence"&gt;Kriyananda, ''The Essence of Self-Realization'' Crystal Clarity Publishers (2003) {{ISBN|0-916124-29-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Conversations with Yogananda''.&lt;ref name="conversations"&gt;Kriyananda, ''Conversations With Yogananda: Stories, Sayings, and Wisdom of Paramhansa Yogananda'' Crystal Clarity Publishers (2004) {{ISBN|1-56589-202-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Yogananda===
On March 7, 1952, Paramahansa Yogananda was a speaker at a banquet for the visiting Indian Ambassador to the U.S., [[Binay Ranjan Sen]], and his wife at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]] in downtown Los Angeles. While giving his speech, Yogananda suddenly dropped to the floor and died. Walters was present in the hall, and this was a pivotal moment for the young monk.

In 1953, the SRF published Walter's book, ''Stories of Mukunda'',&lt;ref&gt;Walters, James Donald Erzieher ''Stories of Mukunda'' Los Angeles: Self-Realization Fellowship (1953) {{OCLC|633537040}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See ''Autobiography of a Yogi'', (1955) 6th ed., {{OCLC|546634}} p. 498&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1960 an LP album with him singing Yogananda's ''Cosmic Chants'', entitled ''Music for Meditation''.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In 1955, Walters was given his final vows of sannyas into the order of [[Shankaracharya]] swamis, by [[Daya Mata]], SRF president from 1955 until her death in 2010, and took the monastic name of "Kriyananda".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Yogananda stated in his ''Autobiography of a Yogi'' regarding this order:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every swami belongs to the ancient monastic order which was organized in its present form by Shankara. Because it is a formal order, with an unbroken line of saintly representatives serving as active leaders, no man can give himself the title of swami. He rightfully receives it only from another swami; all monks thus trace their spiritual lineage to one common guru, Lord Shankara. By vows of [[poverty, chastity, and obedience]] to the spiritual teacher, many Catholic Christian monastic orders resemble the Order of Swamis.&lt;ref name=ancient&gt;Yogananda, Paramhansa, ''Autobiography of a Yogi'' Nevada City, California:Crystal Clarity Publishers (1995 [1946]) {{ISBN|1565891082}} [[s:Autobiography of a Yogi/Chapter 24|Wikisource, Chapter 24]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was made the director of the SRF Center Department, which guides SRF's meditation groups and centers, and was made a minister of Yogananda's Hollywood temple.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} He lectured for SRF in the United States, as well as in Canada, Mexico, England, France, Switzerland, Italy, Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, and India.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In 1958, when Daya Mata, then President of SRF, traveled to India with Ananda Mata and another nun, he came along as well. In 1960, upon the death of Board member and Vice President of SRF, M.W. Lewis, the SRF Board of Directors, who were direct disciples appointed to the board by Yogananda, elected Kriyananda as a member and Vice President of the Board. He served in that capacity until dismissed in 1962.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Dismissal===
Kriyananda remained in India, serving the SRF until 1962, when the SRF's board of directors voted unanimously to request his resignation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  SRF said that the reasons for his dismissal had to do with specific actions of his – his basic pattern of behavior and being self-serving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldberg |first=Phillip |date= 2013 |title=American Veda: From Emerson and the Beatles to Yoga and Meditation How Indian Spirituality Changed the West|publisher=Harmony}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Kriyananda constantly argued that his dismissal was unjust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beverley |first=James |date= 2009 |title=Nelson's Illustrated Guide to Religions |publisher=Thomas Nelson, Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outward accomplishments==
Kriyananda established Ananda Village as a World Brotherhood Colony in 1968 on 40 acres (160,000 m2) of land near Nevada City, California – his portion of a 160-acre (0.6 km2) parcel acquired with [[Zentatsu Richard Baker|Richard Baker]], [[Gary Snyder]], and [[Allen Ginsberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Suiter, John. ''Poets on the Peaks'' (2002) Counterpoint. {{ISBN|1-58243-148-5}}; {{ISBN|1-58243-294-5}} (pbk) pg. 251&lt;/ref&gt; The village was actually founded with the signing of the first purchase agreement of a larger parcel of land on July 4, 1969.&lt;ref name="manyhands"&gt;[http://www.ananda.org/inspiration/books/many-hands/ Helin, Sadhana Devi ''Many Hands Make a Miracle'']&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kriyananda, these communities provide a supportive environment of “simple living and high thinking” where 1,000 full-time residents live, work, and worship together. The establishment of [[World Brotherhood Colonies]] was one of Yogananda's central "Aims and Ideals" published in his ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]'' until 1958.

Kriyananda founded various retreat centers: The Expanding Light Yoga and Meditation Retreat and nearby Ananda Meditation Retreat, both located near Nevada City, California, U.S.A.; Ananda Associazione near Assisi, Italy; and Ananda Gurgaon, India.

There are over 125 Ananda Meditation groups in 19 countries, all of which were inspired in one way or another by Kriyananda. [[Image:Expanding Light-1.JPG|thumb|left|The Expanding Light retreat center in California, founded by Kriyananda]]

Kriyananda stated that at Yogananda's request he devoted his life to teaching. Over the course of sixty years, he lectured on four continents in five languages. He gave thousands of lectures and continued lecturing in Asia, Europe, and America until his death.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Kriyananda met a number of well-known spiritual teachers: [[Anandamayi Ma]]; [[Sivananda Saraswati]] and his disciples [[Chidananda]] and [[Satchidananda]]; [[Muktananda]]; [[Satya Sai Baba]]; [[Neem Karoli Baba]]; the [[14th Dalai Lama]]; [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada]]; [[Ravi Shankar]]; [[Vicka Ivankovic]], visionary of [[Medjugorje]]; and a few others.&lt;ref&gt;''Visit to Saints of India'', Ananda Sangha Publications, {{ISBN|978-81-89430-24-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s, one of Kriyananda's inter-religious projects near New Delhi, India, received personal support from India's Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. He also had personal contact with [[Indira Gandhi]]; with India's Vice President [[Radhakrishnan]]; and, in 2006, with India's President, [[Abdul Kalam]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In following his guru's guidance that his task would be "writing, editing, and lecturing",&lt;ref name="path" /&gt; Kriyananda wrote about 150 books, each of which he stated was intended to help individuals expand their awareness.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} By the application of Yogananda's teachings, they expand on such varied topics as marriage, education, leadership and success, spiritual communities, yoga, self-healing, art, architecture, astrology, and philosophy, as well as Yogananda's teachings on the Bible, the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]], and other scriptures.

One of Kriyananda's books is ''The Path'' (revised as ''The New Path'' in 2009), which among other things contains details of the three and a half years he spent as Yogananda's direct disciple in Los Angeles. In 2010, ''The New Path'' received the Eric Hoffer Award in the Self-Help section, given with the statement, in part: "... The author begins with a history of his own life, an outstanding, engrossing narrative rich in vivid detail. An American youth with an early, unrelenting desire to find truth in spiritual experience, he eventually discovers his attraction to Eastern yogic science. A growing fascination and ardor culminate in his becoming a dedicated, chosen disciple of Yogananda."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hofferaward.com/HAbookwinners.html#self-help Eric Hoffer Award - Book Award Winners, in Self-Help category],  Retrieved 6-11-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Kriyananda started Crystal Clarity Publishers and the East-West book shops in Sacramento and Mountain View, California, and Seattle, Washington.

Kriyananda's plays include ''The Peace Treaty'' and ''The Jewel in the Lotus''. He wrote his first play at age fifteen and worked and studied with the Dock Street Theater in Charleston, South Carolina, in his early 20s. Rome's famous [[Teatro Valle]] (its oldest still-active theater, built in 1726) hosted ''The Peace Treaty'' in June 2009.

Kriyananda won poetry and essay contest prizes at [[Haverford College]] and also studied under the poet [[W.H. Auden]] at Bryn Mawr College.&lt;ref name="path" /&gt;

In 1973, Kriyananda developed a system for educating children called Education for Life. Education for Life schools state that they offer character development, strong academics, and development of moral strength. The school curriculum is ecumenical; students from all religious backgrounds may attend. There are schools in Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; and Palo Alto and Nevada City, California (all U.S.A.); in Italy near Assisi; and one was recently (2009) started in Gurgaon, India. Other schools are adopting the curriculum and ideals of Education for Life. Kriyananda's educational ideas also inspired Ananda College, a yoga university as envisioned by Paramahansa Yogānanda,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} located near Nevada City, California.

Kriyananda created [[Ananda Yoga]]. Yogananda had asked him often to perform the asanas for visiting guests, in his presence. This inspired him to create Ananda Yoga. It is designed to uplift consciousness, and to prepare the student for meditation. Its distinguishing features are the affirmations associated with postures.

Kriyananda took over 15,000 photographs, many of which he said captured the consciousness of human beings behind the image. His photos have been used on inspirational posters, on album covers, for slideshows, in film productions, and in books.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Kriyananda created several paintings, which have been used on book covers and on posters.

He also produced films, as follows:
*  ''Saint [[Francis of Assisi]]'' (narration,  music, photography)
*  ''Mediterranean Magic'' (narration,  music, photography)
*  ''The Land of Mystery'' (narration,  music, photography)
*  ''The Autobiography of a Yogi'' (narration,  music, photography)
*  ''Christ Lives!'' (narration,  music, photography)
*  ''Different Worlds'' (narration,  music, photography)

==Volunteer work==
*  1948–2013: As a [[Sannyasa|renunciate]]  or as a householder, Kriyananda dedicated his life in service to others. Copyrights to his books and music were placed in a trust. [[Royalties]] were directed toward the work of sharing Kriyananda’s teachings with the public. For many years in his later life, he received no [[salary]] or [[stipend]], and depended on donations for all his needs, including food, housing, and medical care.
*  1997: After the destructive [[1997 Umbria and Marche earthquake|Umbria and Marche earthquake]] that damaged large areas around [[Assisi]], [[Italy]], including the Basilica of St. Francis, Kriyananda raised funds to help rebuild homes in the area, in a campaign called “Hope and Homes for Italy”. He encouraged the use of wood instead of stone building materials, to minimize future earthquake fatalities.

==Legal cases==

===Self-Realization Fellowship Church vs Ananda Church of Self-Realization &amp; J. Donald Walters litigation===

Self-Realization Fellowship filed suit against James Donald Walters (a.k.a. Kriyananda) and Walters' (then-called) Church of Self-Realization regarding the changing of the name to the Church of Self-Realization and on issues regarding specific writings, photographs and recordings of Paramahansa Yogananda. The litigation lasted for around twelve years (1990–2002).&lt;ref name=jury&gt;{{cite news |author=Doug Mattson | title=Jury: Copyrights violated by church | location =Grass Valley, California | agency= |newspaper=The Union |date=October 30, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SRF claimed Yogananda wanted SRF to maintain the [[copyrights]] to his works and to publish them. SRF also claimed exclusive and sole rights ([[trademark]] and [[service mark]]) to the names "Self-Realization Fellowship", "Self-Realization Fellowship Church", and "Paramahansa Yogananda", as well as all images of Yogananda and the term "Self-Realization".&lt;ref name="faith" /&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=January 2013}}

SRF lost some copyright and trademark claims in the federal court in Sacramento, California,{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} but prevailed on its claim that Yogananda repeatedly stated his intentions for SRF to maintain copyrights to his works and to publish them.&lt;ref name="jury"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelsons"&gt;{{cite book |author=Beverley, James |title=Nelson's illustrated guide to religions: a comprehensive introduction to the religions of the world |publisher=Thomas Nelson |year=2009 |isbn=9780785244912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both SRF and Ananda had wins and losses. SRF won the service marks to "Self-Realization Fellowship" and "Self-Realization Fellowship Church". SRF lost its service marks to the names "Paramahansa Yogananda" and "Self-realization", its claim of Unfair Competition, and its claim to own copyrights on ten photos of Yogananda.{{third-party-inline|date=October 2012}} Ananda submitted the following counterclaim and lost all four claims: (1) Violation of the Sherman Act, (2) Libel, (3) Slander, and (4) Unfair Business Practices.  In 1992, the court dismissed the second and third counterclaims on 1st Amendment grounds, and Ananda subsequently withdrew the other two counterclaims.&lt;ref name="faith"&gt;{{cite book |author=Novak, Devi |title=Faith is my armor: the life of Swami Kriyananda |publisher=Crystal Clarity Publishers |year=2006 |ISBN=978-1-56589-213-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=October 2012}}

At the jury trial in 2002, SRF won the claim that Ananda violated SRF's copyrights to magazine articles written by Yogananda.&lt;ref name="jury"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelsons"/&gt; Another issue on which the jury found in SRF's favor was its claim that Ananda violated SRF copyrights to recordings of Yogananda's voice.&lt;ref name="jury"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelsons"/&gt; In mid-litigation, Ananda began publication of Yogananda's first, 1946 edition of ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lccn.loc.gov/99165624 Library of Congress Catalog Record]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the long litigation was completed with a jury verdict. As reported in ''The Union'', a newspaper located in Grass Valley, California, on October 30, 2002:

{{quote|The case hinged on the writings and recordings of Paramahansa Yogananda, a native of India who founded Self-Realization Fellowship in the late 1920s. He died in 1952. Walters became a member in 1948 but was "thrown out" in 1962, said Stillman's legal partner, Michael Flynn.

Walters, known as Kriyananda, later started Ananda Village in Nevada County. It became home to hundreds of followers who also revered Yogananda and his words. The group republished his articles and sold his recordings, according to Stillman and Flynn.

Jurors ultimately agreed with Self-Realization Fellowship's argument that Yogananda had repeatedly made his intentions clear before dying - he wanted the Fellowship to maintain copyrights to his works.&lt;ref name="jury"/&gt;}}

===Anne-Marie Bertolucci vs J Donald Walters &amp; Ananda litigation===
In 1997–98, Anne-Marie Bertolucci, a former resident of Ananda, filed suit against Ananda, Ananda minister Danny Levin, and J. Donald Walters (Kriyananda).

The jury found the church (Ananda) and Kriyananda liable for "[[constructive fraud]]", with a finding of "[[malice (law)|malice]]" and "[[fraud]]ulent conduct". The church, Kriyananda and Levin were found liable for "intentional infliction of emotional distress" with a finding of "malice" and a finding of "despicable conduct" against the church. The church was found liable for "negligent supervision" of Kriyananda, with a finding of "malice and fraud" on the part of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Vicky Anning | title=COURT: Jury stings Ananda Church and its leaders | location=Palo Alto, California | agency= | newspaper=Palo Alto Weekly| date= February 11, 1998 | url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/news/1998_Feb_11.ANANDA.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kriyananda was judged to have misrepresented himself as a monk and to have caused emotional trauma, and was ordered to pay $685,000 in compensatory [[damages]], and another $1 million in [[punitive damages]]. The jury also found that Levin had made "unwelcome sexual advances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | title=$1 million judgment against swami |location =Palo Alto, California |agency= |newspaper=Palo Alto Weekly |date=February 27, 1998 |url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/news/1998_Feb_27.ANANDA1.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The punitive damages were reduced by $400,000 on appeal.  The Ananda Church responded to the million-plus-dollar judgment by filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal [[bankruptcy]] code.&lt;ref name="SF Weekly"&gt;{{cite news |author=Goa, Helen |title=Sex and the Singular Swami |work=San Francisco Weekly |date=March 10, 1999 |url=http://www.sfweekly.com/1999-03-10/news/sex-and-the-singular-swami/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; That allowed Ananda to settle the lawsuit by paying $1.8 million to Bertolucci and her attorneys.  They presented, according to Kriyananda, "lies and complete distortions of the truth." {{third-party-inline|date=January 2013}} Ananda hired a private investigator who was caught rummaging in the trash of opposing counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Wayne Wilson  |title=Church-financed trash raid disrupts sex-abuse lawsuit |location=Sacramento, California |agency= |newspaper=The Sacramento Bee |date=November 2, 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The judge's [[Sanctions (law)|sanctions]] of Ananda included disallowing the questioning of the women alleging sexual misconduct.&lt;ref name="SF Weekly"/&gt;

===Ananda Assisi vs Italian authorities===
In March 2004, Italian authorities raided the Ananda colony in Assisi, responding to [[allegations]] of a former resident who accused Ananda Assisi of fraud, [[usury]] and labor law violations. Nine residents were detained for questioning. They also had a warrant for Kriyananda's detention, but he was in India. A seven-year-long investigation followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theunion.com/article/20040327/NEWS/103270094/0/ARCHIVES |title=Swami clear in Italy case: Ananda founder safe from arrest, supporters say |author=Jamie Bate |newspaper=The Union |date=27 March 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208042905/http://www.theunion.com/article/20040327/NEWS/103270094/0/ARCHIVES |archivedate=February 8, 2012 |accessdate=29 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, the judge ruled that the case was "non luogo a procedere perché il fatto non sussiste" (not to be continued as the matter is without substance).

==Recent years==
Kriyananda married in 1981, and publicly renounced his monastic vows in the Shankaracharya order on the occasion of his second marriage in 1985 and returned to using his birth name, James Donald Walters. He was later divorced. In 1995, on his own, he resumed his monastic name and vows.

From 1996, as Kriyananda, he lived and taught for seven years at the Ananda Italy center, near [[Assisi]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In 2003, he moved to India, where he began an Ananda center in [[Gurgaon]], near Delhi. For five years (until May 1, 2009) he appeared on [[Sadhna TV]] and [[Aastha TV]], television channels that were broadcast throughout India, Asia, Europe, and the United States. Since his 2003 move to India, Ananda teachers have been giving classes on meditation and Kriyā Yoga in many major Indian cities. In 2009, at age 83, he moved to [[Pune, India|Pune]] to start a new community.

In 2009, he established a new swami order, different from Yogananda's lineage in the Giri branch of the Swami Order of Shankara.&lt;ref name="ancient"/&gt; According to Kriyananda, he believed that in this new age ([[Kali Yuga]]) not all old patterns remained valid, some reformation was necessary. Some of the features of the newly formed Nayaswami order are: (1) Nayaswamis can be single or married. (2) They can be freely creative, if the purpose is to serve others. (3) A new Nayaswami is named not by one Nayaswami (which had been the tradition), but by three. (4) A Nayaswami of this new order is called "Nayaswami", with "naya" meaning "new". Hence, he initiated himself and gave himself the title Nayaswami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Sonal Srivastava | title= The naya swami| location =India |newspaper=The Times of India |date= Oct 24, 2011|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/The-naya-swami/articleshow/10472677.cms }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 2013, he died in his home in Assisi.&lt;ref name=passes&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian |title=Swami Kriyananda passes away in Italy |location=India |newspaper=The Times of India - Life |date=April 21, 2013 |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-21/india/38709459_1_swami-kriyananda-paramhansa-yogananda-india |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615205119/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-21/india/38709459_1_swami-kriyananda-paramhansa-yogananda-india |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 15, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His remains were brought back to Ananda Village in May 2013.

'''Kutha meat''' or '''Kuttha meat''' is defined as "meat of animal or fowl slaughtered slowly", as prescribed by the Muslim [[Dhabihah|halal]] procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karen Pechilis|author2=Selva J.

Both the [[Hindu]] and the [[Sikh]] communities view slow methods of killing animals negatively and forbid adherents from consuming such meat. The objection to Kutha meat has been the belief that the slow death by bleeding the animal is an inhumane way of killing animals to prepare meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singha|first=Dr. H.S.|title=Sikhism: A Complete Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nRodBu9seiIC&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=25 November 2010|edition=Paperback|series=Sikh Studies|volume= Book 7|date=30 May 2009|publisher=Hemkunt Press|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-7010-245-8|page=81|chapter=7 Sikh Traditions and Customs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikh tradition recommends the ''[[jhatka]]'' method instead, where the animal is killed in a single strike.&lt;ref name="Engineers2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Niir Board Of Consultants|author2=Engineers|last-author-amp=yes|title=Medical, Municipal and Plastic Waste Management Handbook|date=2009|publisher=National Institute of Industrial Research|isbn= 9788186623916|page= 214|quote=Halal is the method preferred by Muslims and jhatka by the Hindus/Christians/Sikhs, etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rayall, Gurbachan Singh (31 Dec 1998).

==Description==

Kutha meat is any meat produced by slow bleeding or religious sacrifice of animals.&lt;ref name="PechilisRaj2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pashaura Singh|editor=Karen Pechilis|editor2=Selva Raj|title=South Asian Religions: Tradition and Today |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kaubzRxh-U0C&amp;pg=PA242 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-44851-2|page=242}}, Quote: "The Sikh Rahit Maryada forbids hair cutting, adultery, the use of intoxicants, and the eating of Kutha meat, that is Muslim halal meat, obtained through the slow bleeding or religious sacrifice of animals".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jamie S.

# Dishonouring the hair
# Eating the meat of an animal slaughtered the [[halal|Muslim way]] or the Jewish ''[[Kosher]]'' way (Kutha)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Jamie|title=The Religions of Canadians|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-0516-9|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Cohabiting with a person other than one's spouse
# Using tobacco

===Jhatka meat===
According to Singha, the ''Kutha'' meat is forbidden in Sikhism as one of the ''kurahits'', though there is no clarity on encouraging or discouraging meat consumption in general. The rejection of ''Kutha'' meat was initiated by Sikh Gurus:&lt;ref name=singha81/&gt;

{{Quote|
According to the ancient Aryan Hindu tradition, only such meat as is obtained from an animal which is killed with one stroke of the weapon causing instantaneous death is fit for human consumption. However, with the coming of Islam into India and the Muslim political hegemony, it became a state policy not to permit slaughter of animals for food, in any other manner, except as laid down in the Quran – the kosher meat prepared by slowly severing the main blood artery of the throat of the animal while reciting verses from the Quran. It is done to make slaughter a sacrifice to God and to expiate the sins of the slaughter. Guru Gobind Singh took a rather serious view of this aspect of the whole matter. He, therefore, while permitting flesh to be taken as food repudiated the whole theory of this expiatory sacrifice and the right of ruling Muslims to impose it on the non-Muslims. Accordingly, he made ''jhatka'' meat obligatory for those Sikhs who may be interested in taking meat as a part of their food.|HS Singha|Sikhism, A Complete Introduction&lt;ref name=singha81&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. H.S. Singha|title=Sikh Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nRodBu9seiIC&amp;pg=PA81|year=2005|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=978-81-7010-245-8|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While ''jhatka'' meat is acceptable in Sikhism, not all sources of meat is acceptable. According to Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair, the cow, the buffalo and the ox are an integral part of rural Sikh livelihoods, and these are never slaughtered for consumption by any method, treated with respect and beef is strictly avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair|title=Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdhLAQAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-0231-7|pages=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saint Peter's Basilica facade, Rome, Italy.jpg|thumb|[[St. Peter's Basilica]], the largest church in the world.]]
This article lists the '''largest church buildings''' as measured by various criteria.

==Scope==
The term ''church'' is open to interpretation and debate. In this article, it means any [[Church (building)|building]] that was built for the primary purpose of weekly public Christian worship. The list does include at least one building—the [[Hagia Sophia]]—that was originally a church but later became a mosque and is now a museum. The list does not include some buildings from the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].  Two of their buildings are significantly larger than any buildings on the list - the Conference Center in Salt Lake City is 130,000 square meters and the Salt Lake Temple is over 23,500 square meters.  However neither of those buildings are used for public worship weekly. They also have scores of other temples that are large enough to be included, but are similarly not used for public worship, which are found at [[List of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

==Measurements==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Relative size of churches.png|thumb|Relative size of churches]] --&gt;

Whilst claims are made about the relative size of churches many of these claims are not easily substantiated. "Largest" is at best a vague term, which is often not qualified by claimants. Accepted measures of largeness could include area, volume, length, width, height, and/or capacity, although the last is far more subjective. It is important to note therefore that churches may claim to be "the largest" based on only one of these measurements; and thus that there may be several churches that have claims to be "the largest church". Since there is no official body governing these claims, there is no generally accepted criterion for being "the largest church".

The list below attempts to rank churches by different (more-or-less) objective criteria, and thus may generate different orders depending on the measure used. Churches for which claims are made but dimensions cannot be found are not included on the below lists.

For [[length]], [[width]] and [[height]], there is usually a definitive statistic for each church, which can easily be compared. However, for [[area]] and [[volume]], the situation is often more complex. It is often possible to find multiple values quoted for the area/volume of a church in references. Many values appear to be estimates or approximations (especially for volume), or may have been calculated by multiplying lengths, widths and heights. In the latter case, the exact dimensions used (internal vs. external, etc.) may give very different figures. Therefore, although area and volume are the most common 'largeness' measures, they are also apt to be the least reliable. This should be borne in mind when comparing church sizes.

* San Petronio de Bologna: The footplan of the building is a simple rectangle
** Area = length of the building x width of the building = 132 m x 60 m
* The volume, without the roofs, can be calculated as a sum of five cuboids, one single (the central nave) and two pairs (the aisles and the files of chapels). The sum each of the pairs can be calculated as one cuboid of double width. Knowing the height of the central nave and the width of the building, the measures of the sections can be calculated by measuring an orthograde photo of the facade.
** Volume = (traverse section of the central nave [width = 22 m, height = 44.27 m] + sum of the traverse sections of the two aisles [width = 20 m, height = 29.06 m] + sum of the traverse sections of the two files of chapels [width = 18 m, height = 22.38 m]) x length of the building [132 m]

'''Maiden Castle''' is an [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]] {{convert|1.6|mi}} south west of [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], in the English county of [[Dorset]].&lt;ref name="Pastscape"&gt;{{citation |title=Maiden Castle |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=451864 |publisher=Pastscape.org.uk |accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;/ref&gt; Hill forts were fortified hill-top settlements [[Hillforts in Britain|constructed across Britain during the Iron Age]].

The earliest [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence of human activity on the site consists of a [[Neolithic]] [[causewayed enclosure]] and [[bank barrow]]. In about 1800&amp;nbsp;BC, during the [[Bronze Age]], the site was used for growing crops before being abandoned. Maiden Castle itself was built in about 600&amp;nbsp;BC; the early phase was a simple and unremarkable site, similar to many other hill forts in Britain and covering {{convert|6.4|ha}}. Around 450&amp;nbsp;BC it was greatly expanded and the enclosed area nearly tripled in size to {{convert|19|ha|acre|abbr=on}}, making it the largest hill fort in Britain and, by some definitions, the largest in Europe. At the same time, Maiden Castle's defences were made more complex with the addition of further [[defensive wall|rampart]]s and [[ditch (fortification)|ditches]]. Around 100&amp;nbsp;BC, habitation at the hill fort went into decline and became concentrated at the eastern end of the site. It was occupied until at least the [[Roman Britain|Roman period]], by which time it was in the territory of the [[Durotriges]], a [[Celt]]ic tribe.

After the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] in the 1st century&amp;nbsp;AD, Maiden Castle appears to have been abandoned, although the Romans may have had a military presence on the site. In the late 4th century&amp;nbsp;AD, a temple and ancillary buildings were constructed. In the 6th century&amp;nbsp;AD the hill top was entirely abandoned and was used only for agriculture during the medieval period.

Maiden Castle has provided inspiration for composer [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] and authors [[Thomas Hardy]] and [[John Cowper Powys]]. The study of hill forts was popularised in the 19th century by archaeologist [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]]. In the 1930s, archaeologist [[Mortimer Wheeler]] and [[Tessa Wheeler|Tessa Verney Wheeler]] undertook the first [[archaeology|archaeological excavations]] at Maiden Castle, raising its profile among the public. Further excavations were carried out under Niall Sharples, which added to an understanding of the site and repaired damage caused in part by the large number of visitors. Today the site is protected as a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]] and is maintained by [[English Heritage]].

==Before the fort==
[[Image:Maiden castle dorset.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Maiden Castle from the north]]
Before the hill fort was built, a [[Neolithic]] [[causewayed enclosure]] was constructed on the site. Dating from around [[4th millennium BC|4000&amp;nbsp;BC]], it was an oval area enclosed by two ditches,&lt;ref name="Sharples 34"&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;/ref&gt; It is called a causewayed enclosure because the way the ditches were dug meant that there would originally have been gaps.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; These gaps, and the bank being only {{convert|17|cm}} high, indicate the site would not have been defensive. Instead the ditches may have been symbolic, separating the interior of the enclosure and its activities from the outside.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist Niall Sharples, who was involved in excavating the hill fort in the 1980s, has identified the hilltop views of the surrounding landscape as a likely factor for the enclosure's position.&lt;ref name="Sharples 34"/&gt; Situated on the side of the hill, it would have been visible from several miles away, and when first cut the ditches would have exposed the underlying white chalk and stood out against the green hillside. The interior of the enclosure has been disturbed by later habitation and farming. The site does not appear to have been inhabited, although a grave containing the remains of two children, aged 6–7, has been discovered.&lt;ref name="Sharples 35-37"&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;35–37.&lt;/ref&gt; The enclosure is the earliest evidence of human activity on the site.&lt;ref name="Sharples 35-37"/&gt;

The purpose of Neolithic causewayed enclosures is unclear, and they probably had a variety of functions. In addition to the burials, which indicate the site at Maiden Castle was important for rituals related to death, pottery from the coast and areas to the east and west was found here, indicating that the site was a meeting place that attracted people over long distances.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;53.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radiocarbon dating]] indicates that the enclosure was abandoned around 3,400&amp;nbsp;BC. Arrowheads discovered in the ditches may indicate that activity at the enclosure met a violent end.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;54–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a period of about 50&amp;nbsp;years, a [[bank barrow]] was built over the enclosure. It was a {{convert|546|m|adj=on}} long mound of earth with a ditch on either side; the parallel ditches were {{convert|19.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} apart.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;56.&lt;/ref&gt; Many barrows lie over graves and are monuments to the deceased, but as the barrow at Maiden Castle did not cover any burials, scholars have suggested that it was a boundary marker. This would explain the limited human activity on the hilltop for the 500&amp;nbsp;years after the bank barrow's construction.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1,800&amp;nbsp;BC, during the early [[Bronze Age]], the hill was cleared and used to grow crops, but the soil was quickly exhausted and the site abandoned. This period of abandonment lasted until the [[Iron Age]], when the hill fort was built.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;65–67.&lt;/ref&gt; The bank barrow survived into the Iron Age as a low mound, and throughout this period construction over it was avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;94–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First hill fort==
[[File:Aerial photograph of Maiden Castle, 1935.jpg|thumb|300px|The white line across the hill fort where the ramparts deviate inwards marks the extent of the early fort. Photograph taken in 1935 by Major George Allen (1891–1940).]]
Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the [[1st millennium BC|first millennium&amp;nbsp;BC]].&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Corney, &amp; Cunliffe (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been defensive sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and resulting pressure on agriculture. 

Since the 1960s, the dominant view has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze. As a result, trading patterns shifted, and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Archaeologist [[Barry Cunliffe]] believes that population increase still played a role and has stated that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/2008/swords/swords-found.html |title=Time Team: Swords, skulls and strongholds |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |date=2008-05-19 |accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are around 31&amp;nbsp;hill forts in Dorset; archaeologist Sharples, who undertook excavations at Maiden Castle, proposed that hill forts were used to control agricultural land to support a large community. Those in Dorset were situated near expanses of fertile land. Monumental defences such as the ditch at Maiden Castle indicate that the land was disputed and communities fought each other for control.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;76,&amp;nbsp;82.&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by Cunliffe, who argues that the elaborate earthworks such as those around the entrances to Maiden Castle and [[Danebury]] were used to defend the weakest part of the hill fort. They increased the time the attackers took to reach the gateway, which would have left them vulnerable to defenders armed with [[Sling (weapon)|slings]]. Hoards of carefully selected sling stones have been found at both sites.&lt;ref&gt;Cunliffe (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructed on a territorial boundary in about 600&amp;nbsp;BC, the first hill fort at Maiden Castle was a {{convert|6.4|ha|adj=on}} area surrounded by a single ditch.&lt;ref name="Sharples 72"&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;15,&amp;nbsp;72.&lt;/ref&gt; The hill it sits on is part of a ridge on the north side of the South Winterborne valley, which feeds the [[River Frome, Dorset|River Frome]]. At the eastern end of the ridge and rising {{convert|132|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, the site of the first hill fort was not the highest point along the ridge. The highest point is the neighbouring Hog Hill, which is only {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} higher.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; The hill [[Topographic prominence|projects]] about {{convert|40|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the surrounding countryside, which is about {{convert|90|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991b), p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt; The defences were {{convert|8.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and consisted of the V-shaped ditch and a rampart.&lt;ref name="Sharples 72"/&gt; The rampart would probably have been timber-faced around just the entrances. Elaborate timber facing would have been used to impress visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;74.&lt;/ref&gt; The site could be accessed by an entrance in the northwest and a double entrance in the east. The double entrance is unique in hill forts in the British Isles. The reason for a double entrance is unclear; however, archaeologist Niall Sharples has suggested that it was a form of segregation. It is likely that several farming communities lived in the hill fort and wanted different entrances.&lt;ref name="Sharples 72"/&gt;

The defences of the first hill fort were rebuilt on at least one occasion; the ditch was deepened by {{convert|1.5|to|7|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The [[Earthworks (engineering)|spoil]] from re-digging the ditch was deposited on the back of the rampart. At the same time, the defences around the eastern entrances were made more complex. A bank and ditch were built outside the two entrances, and a bank was erected between them. The bank had a wall faced with limestone, which was brought from more than {{convert|3|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} away. Sharples believes this would have created an impressive entrance and was a demonstration of the settlement's high status.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;76.&lt;/ref&gt; The Early Iron Age archaeology has been largely destroyed due to later activity on the site. However, nearby [[Poundbury]] and [[Chalbury Hill Fort|Chalbury]] date to the same period, so through comparison it is possible to infer the Early Iron Age activity at Maiden Castle.&lt;ref name="Sharples 79"&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;79.&lt;/ref&gt; From parallels at these sites, Sharples deduces that it was probably densely occupied, with separate areas for habitation and storage.&lt;ref name="Sharples 79"/&gt; Not much is known about the [[Archaeological culture|material culture]] and economy of the Early Iron Age, and the paucity of finds from this period at Maiden Castle makes it difficult to draw conclusions about activity on the site.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developed hill fort==
[[Image:Maiden castle dorset ramparts.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Maiden Castle's southern defences were made up of four [[defensive wall|rampart]]s and three [[ditch (fortification)|ditches]].]]
In the Early Iron Age, Maiden Castle was generally unexceptional; it was one of over 100&amp;nbsp;hill forts of similar size built around the same time in the area that is now [[Berkshire]], Dorset, [[Hampshire]], and [[Wiltshire]]. In the Middle Iron Age, Maiden Castle was expanded and in the process it became the largest hill fort in Britain&lt;ref name="Sharples 11, 83"&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;11,&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.open2.net/historyandthearts/history/locations_maiden_castle.html |title=Maiden Castle, Dorset |publisher=[[Open University]] |accessdate=2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Millett (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scarre (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;184.&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the largest in Europe.&lt;ref name="Pastscape"/&gt;&lt;ref name="English Heritage"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.15733 |title=Maiden Castle |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |accessdate=2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to archaeologist Niall Sharples it is, by some definitions, the largest in western Europe.&lt;ref name="Sharples 11, 83"/&gt; In about 450&amp;nbsp;BC, Maiden Castle was expanded from {{convert|6.4|to|19|ha|abbr=on}}. The area was initially enclosed by a single bank and ditch, with the bank standing {{convert|2.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} high although the ditch was shallow. The hill fort's expansion was not unique; it was one of a series of "developed hill forts" in southern England. As some hill forts were expanded, many of the smaller hill forts that had proliferated in the Early Iron Age fell out of use, as was the case in Dorset. The developed hill forts in Dorset were spaced widely apart. This, and the abandonment of the smaller hill forts in the area when the developed hill forts were built, indicates that these developed hill forts were important.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; The developed hill forts of Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire were equally spaced apart, with roughly equal access to resources such as water.&lt;ref&gt;Cunliffe (1983), pp.&amp;nbsp;67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of developed hill forts has been attributed to Iron Age society becoming more complex.&lt;ref&gt;Cunliffe (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of one dominant hill fort in an area indicates that the inhabitants of a particular hill fort became more important than their contemporaries, possibly through warfare. However, a general dearth of evidence for destruction and an increase of artefacts associated with crafts and industry suggest that the reason for change was economic. Hill forts may have become important as centres of trade.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cunliffe (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;52.&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by the possibility that the multiple rings of ditches often employed at developed hill forts (the technical term for which is "[[Hill fort#Types of hill fort|multivallate]]") were likely to be not just defensive; so many ditches and ramparts, such as those at Maiden Castle, were excessive for defence alone so were likely used as statements of power and authority.&lt;ref name="Cunliffe 2000 50"&gt;Cunliffe (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/ref&gt; Developed hill forts were generally densely occupied; this is best demonstrated at Danebury, where 57% of the site has been excavated.&lt;ref name="Cunliffe 2000 50"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Corney, &amp; Cunliffe (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;58.&lt;/ref&gt; While developed hill forts were of a higher status than their smaller predecessors, they were not all equal. Cunliffe states that the Maiden Castle's monumental defences probably indicate that it was of higher status than other developed hill forts.&lt;ref&gt;Cunliffe (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;51.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maiden Castle, Dorchester..jpg|300px|thumb|The ramparts and ditches of the developed hill fort.]]
Maiden Castle expanded westwards, and the ditch was extended to enclose the neighbouring Hog Hill. The peaks of the two hills encompassed by the new, larger hill fort were separated by a [[dry valley]]. A shaft dug into the valley was possibly used as a water source.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost immediately after the single ditch enclosure was expanded to {{convert|19|ha|abbr=on}}, work began on making the defences more elaborate. The existing rampart was heightened to {{convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and more ramparts and ditches were added. On the south of the fort, four ramparts and three ditches were added, but because of the steepness of the northern slope of the hill, the fourth rampart did not extend all the way round, and only three ramparts were built on the northern side. At the same time, the eastern entrance was again made more complex through the addition of further earthworks, lengthening the approach to the site.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The four-post structures common in hill forts throughout England are also found in Maiden Castle. Their purpose on this site is uncertain however, since at {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} square they have been considered by archaeologists to be too small for dwellings; as a result, it has been concluded that these structures were probably granaries.&lt;ref name="Sharples 87-88"&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;87–88.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of granaries suggests that the fort was used to control the area's food supply.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;89.&lt;/ref&gt; Little evidence has been discovered for houses in Maiden Castle during the site's reconstruction in the 5th century&amp;nbsp;BC; this is probably because the site has not been fully excavated and a quarry used to provide material for the rampart may have obliterated the evidence.&lt;ref name="Sharples 87-88"/&gt; It appears that houses were not built near the ramparts until after the defences were complete.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;90.&lt;/ref&gt; Maiden Castle was occupied throughout the Iron Age and its inhabitants lived in [[Roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouse]]s. The later houses appear to be organised in rows, and to be roughly similar in size, a reorganisation which indicates the increasing power of the elites over Iron Age society.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;90–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronze objects such as pins, jewellery, and rivets have been found on the site, dating from the Middle Iron Age. As there was no local source of tin and copper ore, this demonstrates long distance trade, probably with the southwest. Although bronze was not produced at Maiden Castle, there is evidence of it being reworked.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;104–105.&lt;/ref&gt; Good quality iron ore could be found in the surrounding area, but the hill fort does not appear to have been a centre for iron production in this period; this is not unusual as very few hill forts in Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire exhibit traces of iron production.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;106.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the Iron Age, most of the pottery found at Maiden Castle was produced locally&amp;nbsp;– within about {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}}&amp;nbsp;– however later on sources further afield became more important, and by the Late Iron Age 95% of the pottery came from the area around [[Poole Harbour]], more than {{convert|35|mi|km|abbr=on}} away.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;107.&lt;/ref&gt; This long-range trade has been taken as evidence for increasing relationships with groups of people over large areas and the emergence of tribal identities.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;114–115.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Sharples states that developed hill forts such as Maiden Castle are not towns and cannot be considered truly urban because they are so closely related to agriculture and storage,&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt; Cunliffe and fellow-archaeologists Mark Corney and Andrew Payne describe developed hill forts as "town-like settlements", a form of proto-urbanism.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Corney, and Cunliffe (2007), pp.&amp;nbsp;5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
Across Britain, many hill forts fell out of use in the 100&amp;nbsp;years around the turn of the millennium.&lt;ref name="Cunliffe 1983, p. 74"&gt;Cunliffe (1983), p.&amp;nbsp;74.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that this, and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons (such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries), was caused by increased interaction with the [[Roman Empire]]. The developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites, whose power was based on agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;116,&amp;nbsp;123.&lt;/ref&gt; Such change is not as obvious in Dorset as it is in the rest of Britain, but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts in the area and a proliferation of small undefended farmsteads, indicating a migration of the population.&lt;ref name="Sharples 116"&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 100&amp;nbsp;BC, Maiden Castle's organised street pattern was replaced by more random habitation. At the same time, the western half of the site was abandoned and occupation was concentrated in the east of the fort.&lt;ref name="Sharples 116"/&gt; Also during the Late Iron Age, some of the earthworks around the eastern gateway were filled in and settlement expanded beyond the entrance, and into the areas between the banks. Excavations by archaeologist [[Mortimer Wheeler]] in this area revealed several houses, storage pits, an area used for iron working, and a cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;117.&lt;/ref&gt; On the industrial site, more than {{convert|62|kg|abbr=on}} of iron slag was discovered in an area of {{convert|30|sqm|abbr=on}}, and it is believed the site produced around {{convert|200|kg|abbr=on}} of iron. The amount of ore required could not have been supplied by local sources, so most likely originated from areas of specialist iron production such as the [[Weald]], south west England, and Wales. Maiden Castle is one of the most important iron production sites from the Late Iron Age in southern Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;118.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little evidence for burial in the Iron Age until late on in the period, and it is believed that the prevalent method of disposing of a body was by [[excarnation]]. Wheeler's excavations on the cemetery in the eastern gateway revealed 52&amp;nbsp;burials, but only part of the cemetery was investigated, so the total number of burials is likely to be at least double this figure. One area of the cemetery featured burials of 14&amp;nbsp;people who had died in violent circumstances,&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;125.&lt;/ref&gt; including one body with a Roman catapult bolt in its back. Wheeler used the "war cemetery", as he described it, as evidence of a Roman attack on Maiden Castle.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;119–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman activity and abandonment==
[[Image:Roman temple, Maiden Castle.jpg|thumb|left|300px|right|Site of the Roman [[temple]] at Maiden Castle]]
In AD&amp;nbsp;43, the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] began. Vespasian's subsequent campaign to conquer the tribes of the [[Atrebates]], [[Dumnonii]], and Durotriges in the southwest of Britain took place in AD&amp;nbsp;43–47.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly (2006), p.&amp;nbsp;97.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the discovery of a group of bodies in the Late Iron Age formal cemetery that had met a violent death, archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler created a vivid story of the fall of Maiden Castle to Roman forces. He believed a legion wreaked destruction on the site, butchering men, women, and children, before setting fire to the site and [[slighting]] its defences. However, there is little archaeological evidence to support this version of events, or even that the hill fort was attacked by the Romans. Although there is a layer of charcoal, it is associated with the iron works, and the main evidence for slighting of defences comes from the collapse of an entranceway to the fort. Although 14&amp;nbsp;bodies in the cemetery exhibited signs of a violent death, there is no evidence that they died at Maiden Castle.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The eastern part of the hill fort remained in use for at least the first few decades of the Roman occupation, although the duration and nature of habitation is uncertain. Many 1st-century Roman artefacts have been discovered near the east entrance and in the centre of the hill fort. It has been suggested that Maiden Castle was occupied as a Roman military outpost or [[castra|fort]] and the settlement discontinued, as there is no known fort in the area and it was not uncommon for hill forts in the southwest to have been occupied by Roman forces. This was a characteristic of [[Vespasian]]'s campaign in the region; there was military occupation at [[Cadbury Castle, Somerset|Cadbury Castle]] in [[Somerset]], [[Hembury]] in [[Devon]], and [[Hodd Hill]] in Dorset.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;125–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maiden Castle had been abandoned by the end of the 1st century, a time when ''[[Durnovaria]]'' (Dorchester) rose to prominence as the ''[[civitas]]'', or regional capital, of the [[Durotriges]], a Celtic tribe whose territory was in southwest England.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;126.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in July 2015 archaeologists from [[Bournemouth University]] discovered the remains of the Iron Age settlement of [[Duropolis]] and believe that the abandonment of the fort may be connected with the new site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www1.bournemouth.ac.uk/news/2015-07-12/dig-unearths-prehistoric-town|title=Dig Unearths Prehistoric Town|publisher=[[Bournemouth University]]|date=12 July 2015|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ancient geographer [[Ptolemy]], writing in the 2nd century&amp;nbsp;AD, ''Dunium'' was the main settlement of the Durotriges. Although ''Dunium'' has long been thought to refer to Maiden Castle, [[Hod Hill]] and [[Hengistbury]] have been identified as two other possible sites for ''Dunium''.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright &amp; Cunliffe (1985), p.&amp;nbsp;97.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dunium'' may have derived from [[British language (Celtic)|British]] ''duno-'' which meant "a fort".&lt;ref name="Mills 377"&gt;Mills (1977), p.&amp;nbsp;377.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime after 367, a Romano-Celtic temple was built at Maiden Castle in the eastern half of the hill fort.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;16,&amp;nbsp;130.&lt;/ref&gt; The date was deduced from a hoard of coins discovered beneath a mosaic floor in the temple. A central room, measuring {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} square, was surrounded by a {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} passageway, similar to many Romano-Celtic temples found in the south of England. Nearby were two other buildings: a rectangular building {{convert|7.9|x|5.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} with two rooms that may have been a house for a priest, and a circular building that may have been a shrine. At the same time as the temple was built, the fort's eastern gateway was refurbished; there was possibly another shrine inside the gateway.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later history==
[[File:Aerial photograph of Maiden Castle from the west, 1937.jpg|thumb|300px|Excavations at Maiden Castle in October 1937. Photograph by Major George Allen (1891–1940).]]
The 4th-century temple gradually fell into disuse and Maiden Castle was used predominantly as pasture. There is evidence for activity on the site in the form of a few post-Roman or Anglo Saxon burials, some possibly Christian, but the hill fort was not reused as a settlement. In the 16th and 17th centuries, a barn was built over the "war cemetery".&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;130–131.&lt;/ref&gt; The only other significant activity on the hill top after the Romans was a short period of cultivation in the 17th century, as demonstrated by traces of [[ridge and furrow]] caused by ploughing.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;131.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern name for the hill fort is first recorded in 1607 as ''Mayden Castell''; it is not unique to the site and occurs in several other places in Britain and is widely taken to mean a "fortification that looks impregnable" or one that has never been taken in battle.&lt;ref name="Mills 377"/&gt; Alternatively, the name may derive from the [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] ''mai-dun'', meaning a "great hill".&lt;ref&gt;Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society (1922), p.&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent explanation has been advanced by [[Richard Coates]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Maiden Castle, Geoffrey of Monmouth and Hārūn al-Rashīd |journal=Nomina |volume=29 |date=2006 |pages=5–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the name is only of [[medieval]] origin, and was applied simultaneously to the considerable number of [[Maiden Castle (disambiguation)|identically named locations]] around the country.

Over the following centuries, the site was abandoned completely and became open pasture, although it was of interest to [[antiquarian]]s. [[Thomas Hardy]], who built [[Max Gate|his house]] within sight of it,&lt;ref&gt;Pite (2006), p.&amp;nbsp;267f.&lt;/ref&gt; described the castle in a short story, "Ancient Earthworks and What Two Enthusiastic Scientists Found Therein" (1885) about a local antiquarian who spent much time investigating the site.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, composer [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] wrote ''Mai-Dun'', a symphonic rhapsody, about the hill fort in Dorset.&lt;ref&gt;Latham (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O76-MaiDun.html |title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music: Mai-Dun |year=1996 |last1=Kennedy |first1=Michael |last2=Bourn |first2=Joyce |accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Cowper Powys]] wrote a novel titled ''[[Maiden Castle (novel)|Maiden Castle]]'' in 1936, which was set in Dorset.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/aug/12/featuresreviews.guardianreview14 |last=Drabble |first=Margaret |title=The English degenerate |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 August 2006 |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological investigations==
The first widespread investigation of hill forts was carried out in the second half of the 19th century under the direction of [[Augustus Pitt-Rivers]],&lt;ref&gt;Cunliffe (1983), pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until the 1930s that Maiden Castle was methodically investigated, the first large-scale excavation of the interior of a hill fort.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Corney, &amp; Cunliffe (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1934 and 1937, [[Mortimer Wheeler]] and [[Tessa Wheeler|Tessa Verney Wheeler]] excavated both the interior and the defences, work that was funded almost entirely by donations from the public. Wheeler's use of the media to disseminate information about the site resulted in Maiden Castle becoming well known.&lt;ref name="Tessa Verney Wheeler"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WMb9CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA260&amp;lpg=PA260&amp;dq=Tessa+Verney+Wheeler;+Women+and+Archaeology+Before+World+War+Two&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=29OMd2b4un&amp;sig=WFXLKaqtfTb7bV_fsbVlhRzV14E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidqOWhnabRAhUsIMAKHZJDDFQQ6AEIQzAK#v=onepage&amp;q=maiden%20castle&amp;f=false |title=Tessa Verney Wheeler: Women and Archaeology Before World War Two |last=Carr |first=Lydia C. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=26 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright &amp; Cunliffe (1985), pp.&amp;nbsp;97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of about 80&amp;nbsp;hill forts to have been excavated by 1940, in a period known as "hill fort mania" during the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Cunliffe (1983), p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1985 and 1986 further excavations under Niall Sharples were prompted by the hill fort's deteriorating condition, partly caused by the large number of visitors to the site. Under the auspices of [[English Heritage]], repair work and archaeological investigations were undertaken concurrently.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), p.&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright &amp; Cunliffe (1985), p.&amp;nbsp;98.&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques such as radiocarbon dating were available to Sharples that were unavailable to Wheeler, allowing the site to be dated.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples (1991a), pp.&amp;nbsp;18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was made a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]] in 1981, giving Maiden Castle protection against unauthorised change; it is now maintained by English Heritage.&lt;ref name="Pastscape"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Maiden Castle |url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1015775 |publisher=Historic England |accessdate=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; With parking facilities and information boards for visitors, Maiden Castle is open to the public all year round.&lt;ref name="English Heritage"/&gt; Today, the site is in the [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] of [[Winterborne Monkton]] at {{gbmapping|SY66938848}}.&lt;ref name="Pastscape"/&gt;

'''Mesopotamian mythology''' refers to the [[myth]]s, [[religious text]]s, and other literature that comes from the region of ancient [[Mesopotamia]] in modern-day [[Western Asia|West Asia]]. In particular the societies of [[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], and [[Assyria]], all of which existed shortly after 3000 BCE and were mostly gone by 400 CE.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mesopotamian-religion|title=Mesopotamian religion|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These works were primarily preserved on stone or clay tablets and were written in [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] by scribes. Several lengthy pieces have survived, some of which are considered the oldest stories in the world, and have given historians insight into Mesopotamian ideology and cosmology.

== Creation myths ==
There are many different accounts of the creation of the earth from the Mesopotamian region. This is because of the many different cultures in the area and the shifts in narratives that are common in ancient cultures due to their reliance on word of mouth to transmit stories. These myths can share related themes, but the chronology of events vary based on when or where the story was written down.

=== Atra-Hasis ===
''See main article: [[Atra-Hasis]]''

Atra-Hasis refers both to one of the Mesopotamian myths focusing on the earth’s creation, and also the main character of that myth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/19325158|title=Myths from Mesopotamia : creation, the flood, Gilgamesh, and others|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Dalley, Stephanie.|isbn=0198143974|location=Oxford [England]|oclc=19325158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The myth possibly has Assyrian roots, as a fragmented version may have been found in the [[Library of Ashurbanipal|library of Ashusbanipal]], though translations remain unsure. Its most complete surviving version was recorded in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. The myth begins with humans being created by the mother goddess [[Mami (goddess)|Mami]] to lighten the gods' workload. She made them out of a mixture of clay, flesh, and blood from a slain god. Later in the story though, the god [[Enlil]] attempts to control overpopulation of humans through various methods, including famine, drought, and finally, a [[Flood myth|great flood]]. Humankind is saved by Atrahasis, who was warned of the flood by the god [[Enki]] and built a boat to escape the waters, eventually placating the gods with sacrifices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Eridu Gensis ===
''See main article: [[Sumerian creation myth|Sumerian Creation Myth]]''

Eridu Gensis has a similar plot to that of the Akkadian myth, Atra-Hasis, though it is harder to tell what happens exactly in Eridu Gensis because the tablet upon which it was recorded is badly damaged. The two stories share the flood as the major event however, although the hero who survives in Eridu Gensis is called Zi-ud-sura instead of Artahasis. Eridu Gensis was recorded around the same time as Atra-Hasis, however the fragmented tablet that held it was found in [[Nippur]], located in modern-day east [[Iraq]], while the version of Atra-hasis that came from the same time was found in the library of Ashurbanipal, in modern-day north Iraq.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Enuma Elis ===
''See main article: [[Enûma Eliš|Enuma Elis]]''

Enuma Elis (also spelled Enuma Elish) is a Babylonian creation myth with an unclear composition, though it possibly dates back to the [[Bronze Age]]. This piece was thought to be recited in a ritual celebration of the Babylonian new year. It chronicles the birth of the gods, the world, and man, whose purpose was to serve the gods and lighten their work load.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The focus of the narrative is on praising [[Marduk]], the patron god of Babylon, who creates the world, the calendar, and humanity.

== Heroic epics ==
These stories tended to focus on a great hero, following their journey through trials or simply important events in their life. Stories like these can be found in many different cultures around the world, and often give insight into the values of those societies. For example, in a culture that celebrated a hero that was devout to the gods or respecting their father, it can be inferred that the society valued those traits.

=== Epic of Gilgamesh    ===
{{Main|Epic of Gilgamesh}}

The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the most well known Mesopotamian myths, and is often regarded as the oldest known piece of literature in the world. It was initially a number of individual short stories, and was not combined into one cohesive epic until the 18th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The story follows the Sumerian king Gilgamesh, typically regarded as a historical figure, and his good friend, Enkidu through various adventures and quests that eventually lead to Enkidu's death. The second half of the epic deal with Gilgamesh, distressed about the death of his friend and his own impending mortality, as he searches for immortality. In the end he fails, but he comes to terms with the fact that he is eventually going to die and returns to his city of Uruk a wiser king.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/796081940|title=A reader of ancient Near Eastern texts : sources for the study of the Old Testament|last=David.|first=Coogan, Michael|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195324921|location=New York|oclc=796081940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Myth of Adapa ===
{{Main|Adapa}}

The earliest record of myth of Adapa is from the 14th century. Adapa was a Sumerian citizen who was blessed by the god Enki with immeasurable intelligence. However, one day Adapa was knocked into the sea by the south wind, and in a rage he broke the south wind’s wings so that it could no longer blow. Adapa was summoned to be judged by [[Anu|An]], and before he left Enki warned him not to eat or drink anything offered to him. However, An had a change of heart when he realized just how smart Adapa was, and offered him the food of immortality, which Adapa, dutiful to Enki, turned down. This story is used as an explanation for humankind’s mortality, it is associated with the [[fall of man]] narrative that is also present in Christianity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1028993193|title=Revolutionizing a world : from small states to universalism in the pre-Islamic Near East|last=Mark,|first=Altaweel,|others=Squitieri, Andrea,|isbn=9781911576631|location=London|oclc=1028993193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common themes ==
[[Immortality]] is a constant goal of the characters in Mesopotamian epics. No matter the version of the story, the man who survives the flood, whether Atrahasis, Zi-ud-sura, or Utnapishtim, is granted immortality by the gods. This character then makes a reappearance in the Epic of Gilgamesh, when Gilgamesh is searching for immortality after coming to fear death and the underworld after hearing stories from his friend, Enkidu, about what awaits humanity after death. Enkidu says:&lt;blockquote&gt;On entering the House of Dust, &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;everywhere I looked there were royal crowns gathered in heaps, &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;everywhere I listened, it was the bearers of crowns, &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;who, in the past, had ruled the land,&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;but who now served Anu and Enlil cooked meats,&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;served confections, and poured cool water from waterskins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/37157754|title=The epic of Gilgamesh|date=1997|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers|others=Jackson, Danny P., 1946-|isbn=0865163529|edition= 2nd|location=Wauconda, Ill., USA|oclc=37157754}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Upon hearing that his position in life did not matter in the underworld, Gilgamesh is terrified and seeks out Utnapishtim, who has achieved immortality after surviving the flood sent by the gods to wipe out humanity. Immortality is also touched on in the myth of Adapa. Adapa’s accidental refusal to eat the food of immortality offered to him by the gods is used as an explanation for the fact that humans die.

Also common in Mesopotamian myths is the reoccurring concept that humanity’s purpose is to serve the gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/epic/hd_epic.htm|title=Mesopotamian Creation Myths {{!}} Essay {{!}} Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|last=Spar|first=Author: Ira|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|language=en|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all of the creation myths, humans are only made by the gods in order to help in the fields or offer sacrifices. When they get too be too numerous, loud, or otherwise bothersome, the gods attempt to control the population through plagues, droughts, and most famously, the great flood. This disregard for human life emphasizes the hierarchy that existed in the Mesopotamian consciousness, with humans existing as subjects to the will of the gods.

== Sources ==
Modern understanding of Mesopotamian mythology has been provided through archeological excavations of West Asia and the recovery of many stone and clay tablets, some of which contained the records of many myths. There have been different versions of each myth found in various locations across the region, with inconsistencies between each but maintaining overall common themes and narratives. These versions were written in different languages, including Akkadian, [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], and Old Babylonian, and were often translated from one to another, leading to further inconsistencies due to the inherently imperfect nature of these translations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Mordecai Menahem Kaplan''' (June 11, 1881 – November 8, 1983), was a [[rabbi]], essayist and Jewish educator and the co-founder of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] along with his son-in-law [[Ira Eisenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rabbi Scheinerman|title = Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan (1881–1983)|year = 2008|url = https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/kaplan.html|accessdate = 2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Kaplan was born in [[Švenčionys]], [[Lithuania]], to Rabbi Israel and Haya (Anna) Kaplan. In 1889, he emigrated to the United States with his mother and sisters to join his father in New York City who was working with the Chief Rabbi [[Jacob Joseph]]. He attended [[Etz Chaim Yeshiva (Manhattan)|Etz Chaim Yeshiva]] in [[Manhattan]] for a short period. In 1895 Kaplan attended the [[City College of New York]]. From 1893 to 1902 he also studied at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]]. After graduating from CCNY in 1900 he went to [[Columbia University]] studying philosophy, sociology and education receiving a master's degree and a Doctorate. Majoring in philosophy, he wrote his Masters thesis on the ethical philosophy of [[Henry Sidgwick]]. His lecturers included the philosopher of [[Ethical movement|ethical culture]] [[Felix Adler (professor)|Felix Adler]] and the sociologist [[Franklin Henry Giddings|Franklin Giddings]].&lt;ref&gt;For a biography of Kaplan's life consult, Mel Scult Judaism Faces the Twentieth Century- A Biography of Mordecai M. Kaplan, Wayne State University Press, 1993 {{ISBN|0-8143-2279-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1908 he married Lena Rubin. He received ''[[semikhah]]'' from Rabbi [[Yitzchak Yaacov Reines|Isaac Jacob Reines]] while on his honeymoon. Kaplan began his career as an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbi at [[Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun]], a [[synagogue]] in New York. In 1912, he was an advisor to the creators of the [[Young Israel]] movement of [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]], together with Rabbi [[Israel Friedlander]].&lt;ref name=KaplanYoungIsrael&gt;For Kaplan founding Young Israel, see:

He held the first public celebration of a [[bat mitzvah]] in the United States, for his daughter [[Judith Kaplan Eisenstein|Judith Kaplan]], on March 18, 1922, at the [[Society for the Advancement of Judaism]], his synagogue in New York City.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/firstbat.html |title=The First American Bat Mitvah |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date=1922-03-18 |accessdate=2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waskow, Arthur Ocean and Phyllis Ocean Berman.

&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Kaplan recited the preliminary blessing, read a portion of that week's Torah portion in Hebrew and English, and then intoned the closing blessing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

From 1934 until 1970 Kaplan wrote a series of books in which he expressed his Reconstructionist ideology, which centred on the "concept of Judaism as a civilization". He was a prolific writer, keeping a journal throughout most of his life.

After the death of his wife in 1958, he married Rivka Rieger, an Israeli artist. 
He died in New York City in 1983 at the age of 102. He was survived by Rivka and his daughters Dr. [[Judith Kaplan Eisenstein|Judith Eisenstein]] (formerly Judith Kaplan), [[Hadassah Musher]], Dr. [[Naomi Wenner]] and [[Selma Jaffe-Goldman]].

==Relationship with Orthodox Judaism==
Kaplan began his career as an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbi at [[Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun]] in New York City, assisted in the founding of the [[Young Israel]] movement of [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] in 1912,&lt;ref name=KaplanYoungIsrael/&gt; and was the first rabbi hired by the new (Orthodox) [[Jewish Center (Manhattan, New York)|Jewish Center]] in Manhattan when it was founded in 1918. He proved too radical in his religious and political views and resigned from the Jewish Center in 1921. He was the subject of a number of polemical articles published by Rabbi [[Leo Jung]] (who became the rabbi of the Jewish Center in 1922) in the Orthodox Jewish press.

He then became involved in the [[Society for the Advancement of Judaism]], where on March 18, 1922, he held the first public celebration of a [[Bat Mitzvah]] in America, for his daughter Judith. This led to considerable criticism of Kaplan in the Orthodox Jewish press.

Kaplan's central idea of understanding Judaism as a religious civilization was an easily accepted position within [[Conservative Judaism]], but his naturalistic conception of [[God]] was not as acceptable. Even at JTS, as ''The Forward'' writes, "he was an outsider, and often privately considered leaving the institution. In 1941, the faculty illustrated its distaste with Kaplan by penning a unanimous letter to the professor of homiletics, expressing complete disgust with Kaplan's ''The New Haggadah'' for the Passover Seder. Four years later, seminary professors [[Alexander Marx]], [[Louis Ginzberg]] and [[Saul Lieberman]] went public with their rebuke by writing a letter to the Hebrew newspaper ''Hadoar'', lambasting Kaplan's prayer book and his entire career as a rabbi."&lt;ref name="silver"&gt;Zachary Silver, "A look back at a different book burning," ''The Forward'', June 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 the [[Union of Orthodox Rabbis]] "formally assembled to excommunicate from [[Judaism]] what it deemed to be the community's most heretical voice: Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, the man who eventually would become the founder of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]]. Kaplan, a critic of both Orthodox and Reform Judaism, believed that Jewish practice should be reconciled with modern thought, a philosophy reflected in his ''Sabbath Prayer Book''..."&lt;ref name="silver" /&gt; Due to Kaplan's evolving position on [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish theology]] and the liturgy, he was also condemned as a heretic by members of [[Young Israel]], which he had assisted in founding. His followers attempted to induce him to formally leave Conservative Judaism, but he stayed with JTS until he retired in 1963. Finally, in 1968, his closest disciple and son-in-law [[Ira Eisenstein]] founded a separate school, the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] (RRC), in which Kaplan's philosophy, Reconstructionist Judaism, would be promoted as a separate religious movement.

==University establishment==
Kaplan wrote a seminal essay "On the Need for a University of Judaism," in which he called for a University setting that could present Judaism as a deep culture and developing civilization. His proposal included programs on dramatic and fine arts to stimulate Jewish artistic creativity, a college to train Jews to live fully in American and Jewish culture as contributing citizens, a school to train Jewish educators, and a rabbinical seminary to train creative and visionary rabbis. In 1947, with the participation of Rabbi [[Simon Greenberg]] his efforts toward that end culminated in the establishment of the [[American Jewish University]], then known as the [[University of Judaism]]. His vision continues to find expression in the graduate, undergraduate, rabbinical, and continuing education programs of the University.

==Kaplan's theology==
Kaplan's [[theology]] held that in light of the advances in [[philosophy]], [[science]], and [[history]], it would be impossible for modern Jews to continue to adhere to many of Judaism's traditional theological claims. Kaplan's naturalistic theology has been seen as a variant of [[John Dewey]]'s philosophy. Dewey's naturalism combined atheism with religious terminology in order to construct a religiously satisfying philosophy for those who had lost faith in traditional religion. Kaplan was also influenced by [[Émile Durkheim]]'s argument that our experience of the sacred is a function of social [[solidarity]]. [[Matthew Arnold]] and [[Hermann Cohen]] were among his other influences.

In agreement with prominent medieval Jewish thinkers including [[Maimonides]], Kaplan affirmed that God is not personal, and that all [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] descriptions of God are, at best, imperfect metaphors. Kaplan's theology went beyond this to claim that God is the sum of all natural processes that allow man to become self-fulfilled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To believe in God means to accept life on the assumption that it harbors conditions in the outer world and drives in the human spirit which together impel man to transcend himself. To believe in God means to take for granted that it is man's destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society. In brief, God is the Power in the cosmos that gives human life the direction that enables the human being to reflect the image of God.&lt;ref&gt;Sonsino, Rifat. ''The Many Faces of God: A Reader of Modern Jewish Theologies''. 2004, page 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not all of Kaplan's writings on the subject were consistent; his position evolved somewhat over the years, and two distinct theologies can be discerned with a careful reading. The view more popularly associated with Kaplan is strict [[Humanistic naturalism|naturalism]], à la [[John Dewey|Dewey]], which has been criticized{{who|date=August 2013}} as using religious terminology to mask a non-theistic (if not outright [[atheism|atheistic]]) position. A second strand of Kaplanian theology exists, which makes clear that God has [[ontological]] reality, a real and absolute existence independent of human beliefs, while rejecting classical [[theism]] and any belief in miracles.&lt;ref&gt;The Radical American Judaism of Mordecai M.

As a reward of Nanu Singh Saini's help in his liberation from the prison and his contributions in military campaigns as a general, his family was granted a large jagir which was spread in Patiala, Jind and Ambala regions. Along with Chahal Sardars of Patiala, this [[Saini]] family's estates in Patiala were the largest territories that any noble family owned in Phulkian riyasat. Nanu Singh Saini's family was also known as 'Wade Ghar Wale' in the Phulkian court because they had been granted a sprawling {{convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on}} bungalow at Der Sodhian by the ruling family.

'''''Psilocybe hispanica''''' is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Hymenogastraceae]]. It produces small brown [[mushroom]]s with conical to convex [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|10|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter and [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] {{convert|16|to|25|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.5|to|1|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick. Reported as new to science in 2000, it is only known from the [[Pyrenees]] mountain range in northern Spain and southwestern France, where it grows on horse dung in grass fields at elevations of {{convert|1700|to|2300|m|abbr=on}}. The mushroom contains the [[psychoactive]] compound [[psilocybin]]. The possible depiction of this species in the 6,000-year-old Selva Pascuala [[rock art]] suggests that it might have been used in ancient [[religious ritual]]s—the oldest evidence of such usage in prehistoric Europe.

}}

==Taxonomy==
The species was described by Mexican mycologist [[Gastón Guzmán]] in a 2000 publication, based on specimens collected by Ignacio Seral Bozal near [[Huesca]] in northern Spain in 1995. ''Psilocybe hispanica'' is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Semilanceata'' of the genus ''[[Psilocybe]]'' because of its thick-walled [[spore]]s and [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] that bruises blue with handling.&lt;ref name=Guzman2000/&gt; The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''hispanica'' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for "Spanish".&lt;ref name=Cady2005/&gt;

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] ranges in shape from somewhat conical to convex, and reaches diameters of {{convert|5|to|10|mm|in|1}}. Its surface is smooth, somewhat sticky to dry, and brown to brownish-yellow. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are somewhat [[adnation|adnate]], and brown-violaceous with whitish edges. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|16|to|25|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.5|to|1|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick, cylindrical, and slightly bulbous at the base. It is whitish-yellow, with [[wine (color)|vinaceous]] or blue-green to blackish tones towards the base. Mature specimens do not have a [[annulus (mycology)|veil]] on the stem. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish, but like most psilocybin-containing species, stains blue when injured.&lt;ref name=Guzman2000/&gt;

The [[spore]]s are [[ellipsoid]] and measure 12–14.5 by 6.5–8&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]. They have a brownish-yellow wall greater than 1&amp;nbsp;μm thick and a broad apical [[germ pore]] with an acute [[hilum (biology)|hilar appendix]] at the base (a region where the spore was once attached to the [[sterigma]]). The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells in the [[hymenium]]) are four-spored, [[hyaline]] (translucent), and measure 32–44 by 8–12&amp;nbsp;μm. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is made of a layer 130–150&amp;nbsp;μm thick, with hyaline, thin-walled gelatinized [[hypha]]e measuring 1.5–4&amp;nbsp;μm broad. The hypodermium (the tissue layer directly under the pileipellis) is made of thin-walled, hyaline hyphae, 2.5–8&amp;nbsp;μm broad, with a brownish incrusting [[pigment]]. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the hyphae.&lt;ref name=Guzman2000/&gt;

''[[Psilocybe semilanceata]]'' is roughly similar in appearance to ''P.&amp;nbsp;hispanica'', but may distinguished by its mycenoid (''[[Mycena]]''-like) appearance and acute [[umbo (mycology)|umbonate]] cap.&lt;ref name=Guzman2000/&gt; Although the grassland habitat of the two species is similar, ''P.&amp;nbsp;semilanceata'' does not grow directly on dung; rather, it is a [[saprobic]] species that grows on decaying grass roots.&lt;ref name=Keay1990/&gt; ''[[Psilocybe fimetaria|P.&amp;nbsp;fimetaria]]'' also resembles ''P.&amp;nbsp;hispanica'', but it also has a mycenoid appearance and has a ring on the stem. In terms of microscopic characteristics, ''P.&amp;nbsp;fimetaria'' has larger cheilocystidia that measure 20–32 by 4–8&amp;nbsp;μm. ''P.&amp;nbsp;hispanica'' differs from ''[[Psilocybe liniformans|P.&amp;nbsp;liniformans]]'' var. ''liniformans'' in that it lacks a gelatinous gill edge. [[Psilocybe liniformans var. americana|''P. liniformans'' var. ''americana'']] has larger cheilocystidia, measuring 22–33 by 5.5–9&amp;nbsp;μm, and it is known to grow only on soil around herbs, in the Northwest and Northeast USA and Chile.&lt;ref name=Guzman2000/&gt; ''[[Deconica coprophila]]'' (formerly known as ''Psilocybe coprophila'') is a [[little brown mushroom|small brownish mushroom]] that also grows on dung, but it does not contain psilocybin and does not have a bluing stem.&lt;ref name="urlCalifornia Fungi: Psilocybe coprophila"/&gt;

==Habitat and distribution==
''Psilocybe hispanica'' is a [[coprophilous fungus]] (dung-loving), and produces fruit bodies that grow solitarily or in dense groups on horse dung; sometimes more than 25 fruit bodies can arise from the same dung.&lt;ref name=Guzman2003/&gt; In Guzmán's original report, they were found in a Pyrenean meadow in [[Aragon]], at an elevation of {{convert|2300|m}}. In 2003, the species was reported from Tramacastillo de Tena, a small village in the Pyrenees; it was also reported to have "penetrated the French part of the Pyrenees". Within its restricted range, the mushroom is "very common" at altitudes of {{convert|1700|to|2300|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Guzman2003/&gt;

==Uses==
The mushroom is consumed recreationally by Spanish youths for its [[psilocybin mushroom|mind-altering]] effects;&lt;ref name=Guzman2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=FernandezSasia2006/&gt; other mushrooms used recreationally in Spain include ''P.&amp;nbsp;semilanceata'' and ''[[Psilocybe gallaeciae|P.&amp;nbsp;gallaeciae]]''.&lt;ref name=Cole2006/&gt; Guzmán and Castro report that a 17th-century medallion found in [[Tena Valley]] in the southern Pyrenees had images of a devil and mushrooms carved on it. The mushrooms—possibly either ''P.&amp;nbsp;semilanceata'' or ''P.&amp;nbsp;hispanica'', according to Guzmán and Castro—were used in [[witchcraft]], a common practice in the valley during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=Guzman2003/&gt;

It has been argued that prehistoric rock art at a site known as Selva Pascuala near the Spanish town of [[Villar del Humo]] offers evidence that ''P.&amp;nbsp;hispanica'' was used in [[religious ritual]]s 6,000 years ago. The [[rock shelter]] at Selva Pascuala was discovered in the early 20th century; in the early 21st century it was noticed that objects in one of the murals, which  previously had been described as "mushrooms", matched the general [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of ''P.&amp;nbsp;hispanica'': the mural depicts a row of 13 mushroom-like objects with convex to conical caps, and ringless stems that vary from straight to sinuous (wavy). Additionally, the mural shows a bull, which suggests an association with the coprophilic ''P.&amp;nbsp;hispanica''. Although the hallucinogenic species ''P.&amp;nbsp;semilanceata'' is also widespread in the area where the mural was found, its differing shape (narrowly conical and acutely [[papilla (mycology)|papillate]]) and its habitat on soil instead of dung suggests it is not the species represented in the mural. If the interpretation is correct, the mural represents the oldest evidence of psychedelic fungi use in Europe, and the third reported instance of rock art suggesting prehistoric usage of neurotropic fungi. The only older example is from [[Tassili n'Ajjer]], in the [[Sahara desert]] in southeast [[Algeria]]. In 1992, the Italian ethnobotanist [[Giorgio Samorini]] reported finding a painted mural dated 7000 to 9000 BCE portraying mushrooms,&lt;ref name=Samorini1992/&gt; later tentatively identified as ''[[Psilocybe mairei]]'', a species known from Algeria and [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name=Akers2011/&gt;

A '''pujari''' or '''archaka''' ([[Sanskrit]]: पूजारी) is a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Hindu temple|temple]] priest. The word comes from the Sanskrit word "पूजा" meaning worship. They are responsible for performing temple rituals, including (pūjā) and [[aarti]]. Pujari are mainly drawn from the Hindu [[Brahmin]]. Both men and women can be pujari.

'''Queen of Heaven''' was a title given to a number of ancient sky goddesses worshipped throughout the ancient Mediterranean and Near East during ancient times. Goddesses known to have been referred to by the title include [[Inanna]], [[Anat]], [[Isis]], [[Astarte]], and possibly [[Asherah]] (by the prophet [[Jeremiah]]). In Greco-Roman times [[Hera]], and her Roman aspect [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] bore this title. Forms and content of worship varied.  In modern times, the title "Queen of Heaven" is still used by [[Contemporary paganism|contemporary pagans]] to refer to the [[Magna Dea|Great Goddess]], while [[Catholicism|Catholics]], [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]], and some [[Anglican]] [[Christianity|Christians]] now apply the ancient title to [[Queen of Heaven|Mary]], the mother of [[Jesus]].

==Inanna==

{{main|Inanna}}
Inanna was the Sumerian goddess of love and war. Despite her association with mating and fertility of humans and animals, Inanna was not a mother goddess, and is rarely associated with childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;Fiore, Silvestro. ''Voices From the Clay: the development of Assyro-Babylonian Literature''. University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Inanna was also associated with rain and storms and with the planet Venus.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, Thorkild. ''The Treasures of Darkness: a History of Mesopotamian Religion.'' Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the title of Queen of Heaven was often applied to many different goddesses throughout antiquity, Inanna is the one to whom the title is given the most number of times. In fact, Inanna's name is commonly derived from ''Nin-anna'' which literally means "Queen of Heaven" in [[Sumerian language|ancient Sumerian]] (It comes from the words [[EREŠ|NIN]] meaning "lady" and [[DINGIR|AN]] meaning "sky"),&lt;ref&gt;Wolkstein, Diane and Noah Kramer, Samuel, "Inanna: Queen of Heaven and Earth" - a modern, poetic reinterpretation of Inanna myths&lt;/ref&gt; although the cuneiform sign for her name (Borger 2003 nr. 153, U+12239 𒈹) is not historically a ligature of the two.
In several myths, Inanna is described as being the daughter of [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]], the ancient Sumerian god of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;Wolkstein, Diane, and Samuel Noah Kramer. ''Inanna: Queen of Heaven and Earth: Her Stories and Hymns from Sumer''. Harper &amp;Row, Publishers, 1983, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In other texts, however, she is often described as being the daughter of either [[Enki]] or [[Anu|An]].&lt;ref&gt;http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr141.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr131.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr132.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These difficulties have led some early Assyriologists to suggest that Inanna may have been originally a [[Proto-Euphratean]] goddess, possibly related to the [[Hurrian]] mother goddess [[Hannahannah]], accepted only latterly into the Sumerian pantheon, an idea supported by her youthfulness, and that, unlike the other Sumerian divinities, she at first had no sphere of responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Rivkah (1991), "Inanna-Ishtar as Paradox and a Coincidence of Opposites" (History of Religions, Vol. 30, No. 3 (Feb., 1991)), pp. 261-278&lt;/ref&gt;
The view that there was a [[Proto-Euphratean]] substrate language in Southern Iraq before Sumerian is not widely accepted by modern Assyriologists.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio, Gonzalo (1999), "On the Alleged "Pre-Sumerian Substratum" (Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 51, 1999 (1999)), pp. 1-16&lt;/ref&gt; In Sumer [[Inanna]] was hailed as "Queen of Heaven" in the third millennium BC. In [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] to the north, she was worshipped later as [[Ishtar]]. In the Sumerian ''Descent of Inanna'', when Inanna is challenged at the outermost gates of the underworld, she replies:&lt;ref&gt;Wolkstein, Diane and Samuel Noah Kramer. ''Inanna: Queen of Heaven and Earth: Her Stories and Hymns from Sumer''. Harper and Row, Publishers, 1983, New York. (Page 55)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I am Inanna, Queen of Heaven, &lt;br&gt;On my way to the East}}

Her cult was deeply embedded in Mesopotamia and among the Canaanites to the west. F. F. Bruce describes a transformation from a Venus as a male deity to Ishtar, a female goddess by the Akkadians. He links Ishtar, Tammuz, Innini, Ma (Cappadocia), Mami, Dingir-Mah, Cybele, Agdistis, Pessinuntica and the Idaean Mother to the cult of a great
Mother-goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, F. F. (1941), "Babylon and Rome" (The Evangelical Quarterly, Vol. 13, (Oct. 15, 1941)), pp. 241-261&lt;/ref&gt;

== Astarte ==

The goddess, the Queen of Heaven, whose worship [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]] so vehemently opposed, may have been possibly [[Astarte]].
Astarte  is the name of a [[goddess]] as known from Northwestern [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] regions, cognate in name, origin and functions with the goddess [[Ishtar]] in [[Mesopotamia]]n texts. Another [[transliteration]] is ''‘Ashtart''; other names for the goddess include [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] עשתרת (transliterated ''Ashtoreth''), [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] ''‘ṯtrt'' (also ''‘Aṯtart'' or ''‘Athtart''), [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] &lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;''As-tar-tú'' (also ''Astartu'') and [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] ''Uni-Astre'' ([[Pyrgi Tablets]]).

[[File:As-Julia Maesa-Sidon AE30 BMC 300.jpg|left| thumb|Astarte riding in a [[chariot]] with four branches protruding from roof, on the reverse of a [[Julia Maesa]] coin from [[Sidon]]]]
According to scholar [[Mark S. Smith]], Astarte may be the Iron Age (after 1200 BC) incarnation of the Bronze Age (to 1200 BC) [[Asherah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Astarte was connected with [[fertility]], [[human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[war]]. Her symbols were the [[lion]], the [[horse]], the [[sphinx]], the [[dove]], and a [[star]] within a circle indicating the planet [[Venus]]. Pictorial representations often show her naked. Astarte was accepted by the [[Greece|Greek]]s under the name of [[Aphrodite]]. The island of [[Cyprus]], one of Astarte's greatest faith centers, supplied the name Cypris as Aphrodite's most common byname. Asherah was worshipped in ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] as the consort of [[El (deity)|El]] and in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] as the [[wikt:consort|consort]] of [[Yahweh]] and [[Queen of Heaven#Antiquity|Queen of Heaven]] (the Hebrews baked small cakes for her festival):&lt;ref&gt;[[William G.

{{quote|"Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger." &lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 7:17–18&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|"... to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem ..."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 44:17&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Hebrew Bible references==
Worship of a "Queen of Heaven" (Hebrew מלכת השמים, ''Malkath haShamayim'') is recorded in the [[Book of Jeremiah]], in the context of the Prophet condemning such religious worship as [[blasphemy]] and a violation of the teachings of the [[Yahweh|God of Israel]]. In Jeremiah 7:18:

{{quote|The children gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead the dough and make cakes of bread for the Queen of Heaven. They pour out drink offerings to other gods to provoke me to anger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=30&amp;chapter=7&amp;verse=18&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse Biblegateway, Jeremiah 7, 18].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Jeremiah 44:15-18:
{{quote|Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, along with all the women who were present—a large assembly—and all the people living in Lower and Upper Egypt, said to Jeremiah, "We will not listen to the message you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD! We will certainly do everything we said we would: We will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and will pour out drink offerings to her just as we and our fathers, our kings and our officials did in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. At that time we had plenty of food and were well off and suffered no harm. But ever since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have had nothing and have been perishing by sword and famine."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=30&amp;chapter=44&amp;version=31&amp;context=chapter Biblegateway, Jeremiah 44].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There was a temple of [[Yahweh]] in Egypt at that time, the 6th-7th centuries BC, that was central to the Jewish community at [[Elephantine]] in which Yahweh was worshipped in conjunction with the goddess [[Anath]] (also named in the temple papyri as Anath-Bethel and Anath-Iahu).&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Raphael Patai: "The Hebrew Goddess": Duke University Press: third edition&lt;/ref&gt;

The goddesses [[Asherah]], [[Anath]] and [[Astarte]] first appear as distinct and separate deities in the tablets discovered in the ruins of the library of [[Ugarit]] (modern Ras Shamra, Syria). Some biblical scholars{{who|date=August 2013}} tend to regard these goddesses as one, especially under the title "Queen of heaven".

[[John Day (Old Testament scholar)|John Day]] states that "there is nothing in first-millennium BC texts that singles out Asherah as 'Queen of Heaven' or associates her particularly with the heavens at all."&lt;ref&gt;Day, John. ''Yahweh and the gods and goddesses of Canaan''. Continuum International Publishing Group - Sheffie (26 Dec 2002). {{ISBN|978-0-8264-6830-7}}, p.&amp;nbsp;146.&lt;/ref&gt; [[F. F. Bruce]], an evangelical (Biblical) scholar differentiates between Astarte and Asherah as two distinct feminine deities.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, F. F. (1941), "Babylon and Rome" (The Evangelical Quarterly, Vol. 13, (Oct. 15, 1941)), p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isis==
{{main|Isis}}
[[File:Apuleius - Project Gutenberg eText 12788.png|200px|right|thumb|[[Apuleius]] wrote about the Queen of Heaven, referring to [[Queen regnant|Queen]] [[Isis]]]]
Isis was venerated first in Egypt. As per the Greek historian [[Herodotus]], writing in the fifth century BC, Isis was the only goddess worshiped by all Egyptians alike,&lt;ref&gt;Histories 2.42&lt;/ref&gt; and whose influence was so widespread by that point, that she had become completely [[Syncretism|syncretic]] with the Greek goddess [[Demeter]].&lt;ref&gt;Histories 2.156&lt;/ref&gt; It is after the conquest of Egypt by [[Alexander the Great]], and the [[Hellenization]] of the Egyptian culture initiated by [[Ptolemy I Soter]], that she eventually became known as 'Queen of Heaven'.&lt;ref&gt;R.E Witt, "Isis in the Ancient World", 1997, {{ISBN|0-8018-5642-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Lucius Apuleius]] confirms this in Book 11, Chap 47 of his novel, ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', in which his character prays to the "Queen of Heaven". The goddess herself responds to his prayer, delivering a lengthy monologue in which she explicitly identifies herself as both the Queen of Heaven and Isis. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then with a weeping countenance, I made this orison to the puissant Goddess, saying: O blessed Queen of Heaven...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thus the divine shape breathing out the pleasant spice of fertile Arabia, disdained not with her divine voice to utter these words unto me: Behold Lucius I am come, thy weeping and prayers has moved me to succor thee. I am she that is the natural mother of all things, mistress and governess of all the elements, the initial progeny of worlds, chief of powers divine, Queen of Heaven... and the Egyptians which are excellent in all kind of ancient doctrine, and by their proper ceremonies accustomed to worship me, do call me Queen Isis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/ga/ga48.htm |title=The Golden Asse of Apuleius: The Eleventh Booke: The Forty-seventh Chapter |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2001 census counted 29,026 Rastafari.&lt;ref name="us" /&gt;

==Religious freedom==
Jamaica's constitution provides for freedom of religion, and its laws and policies contribute to the generally free practice of religion.&lt;ref name=us/&gt; The law at all levels protects this right in full against abuse, either by governmental or private actors. The government generally respects religious freedom in practice.&lt;ref name=us/&gt; In 2008, the U.S. government learned of no reports of societal abuses or discrimination in Jamaica based on religious affiliation, belief, or practice.&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

'''Section 29''' of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' is the section of ''Charter'' that most specifically addresses rights regarding [[denominational school]]s and [[separate school]]s.  Section 29 is not the source of these rights but instead reaffirms the pre-existing special rights belonging to [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Protestant]]s, despite [[freedom of religion]] and religious [[social equality|equality]] under [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|sections 2]] and [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|15]] of the ''Charter''.  Such rights may include financial support from the [[provinces and territories of Canada|provincial governments]].  In the case ''[[Mahe v. Alberta]]'' (1990), the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] also had to reconcile denominational school rights with [[minority language]] [[education in Canada|education]]al rights under [[Section Twenty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 23]] of the ''Charter''.

==Text==
The section reads:
 
{{cquote|29. Nothing in this Charter abrogates or derogates from any rights or privileges guaranteed by or under the Constitution of Canada in respect of denominational, separate or dissentient schools.}}

==Purpose==
The [[Constitution of Canada]] contains a number of denominational school rights.  They usually belong to Catholics and Protestants wherever they form the minority population of the relevant province.  The current [[Chief Justice of Canada]] [[Beverley McLachlin]] once referred to this as an early form of freedom of religion in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Beverley McLachlin, "Freedom of Religion and the Rule of Law:  A Canadian Perspective," in ''Recognizing Religion in a Secular Society: Essays in Pluralism, Religion, and Public Policy''. Ed. Douglas Farrow. McGill-Queen's University Press, 2004, pages 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 93 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' awards jurisdiction over education to the provincial governments, with a few exceptions.  Catholics have denominational school rights in [[Ontario]]. Both Catholics and Protestants had these rights in [[Quebec]], until abrogated by the ''[[Amendments to the Constitution of Canada#Post-1982 amendments to the Constitution|Constitution Amendment, 1997 (Québec)]]''.  Quebec was and is predominantly Catholic (though the effects this has had on the province's politics have changed over the years; see [[Quiet Revolution]]).  Section 17 of the [[Alberta Act, 1905]] also guarantees denominational school rights for Catholics in [[Alberta]].  While the rights for Catholics and Protestants seem to contradict ''Charter'' values of equality, section 29 clarifies the privileges cannot be challenged on ''Charter'' grounds.  It was inserted because the authors of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'' did not want to be held responsible for challenging the old system.&lt;ref&gt;Dyck, Rand. ''Canadian Politics: Critical Approaches.'' Third ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Nelson Thomson Learning, 2000), p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted in the Supreme Court case ''[[''Reference re Bill 30, An Act to Amend the Education Act (Ont.)'']]'' [1987] 1 SCR 1148 (SCC), this clarification is really the only function of section 29.  Section 29 does not itself shield the rights of denominational schools from the ''Charter'', since the rights are themselves a part of the Constitution and thus cannot be unconstitutional or subject to ''Charter'' review.&lt;ref&gt;''Reference re Bill 30, An Act to Amend the Education Act (Ont.)'', [1987] 1 SCR 1148 (SCC), at paras. 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt;  This line of thinking was confirmed by the Supreme Court in ''[[Gosselin (Tutor of) v. Quebec (Attorney General)]]'' (2005).

==Interpretation==
In the case ''[[Adler v. Ontario]]'' (1996) religious freedoms under sections 2 and 15 of the ''Charter'' were used to argue that lack of government funding for [[Jewish Canadian]] schools and certain Christian schools in Ontario was unconstitutional, since by contrast Catholic schools received government money.  The majority of the Supreme Court, however, dismissed the argument, noting section 93's importance as an agreement made between the founders of the nation to make [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] possible.  Since it was a political deal and not based upon the principle of freedom, section 2 of the ''Charter'' could not extend section 93 rights to other religions.  Moreover, to find that section 2 could extend denominational school rights would contradict the specificity of section 93, and section 29 indicates such a contradiction cannot exist and that denominational schools are not ''Charter'' issues.

In ''[[Mahe v. Alberta]]'', the Court found that minority language rights of [[French Canadian]]s in Alberta required that the French community be represented on the [[school board]].  While this seemed to border on altering denominational school rights and raised section 29 concerns, since the school board in this case was a religious one, the Court justified it since the religious content of the education was unchanged, and the powers of the school board were merely "regulated" so that the religious teachings could be provided in [[French language|French]].

'''''Shavei Israel''''' ({{lang-he|שבי ישראל}}, ''Returners of Israel'') is an Israeli-based [[Judaism|Jewish]] organization that encourages people of [[Zera Yisrael|Jewish descent]] to strengthen their connection with [[Israel]] and the [[Jewish people]]. Founded by [[Michael Freund (Israeli)|Michael Freund]] in 2002, ''Shavei Israel'' locates [[lost Jews]] and [[Crypto-jews|hidden Jewish]] communities and assists them with returning to their roots and, sometimes, with [[aliyah]] (immigration to Israel). The organization’s team is composed of academics, educators and rabbis.

==Goals and objectives==
The Shavei Israel organization was founded to help people whose ancestors had become separated from Judaism (including alleged descendants of the [[Lost tribes of Israel]], [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]], hidden Jews, and Jewish forcibly assimilated under Communist rule,) reconnect with the [[Jewish]] people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shavei.org/communities/bnei_menashe/articles-bnei_menashe/the-emergence-turkey%E2%80%99s-hidden-jews-2/?lang=en Michael Freund, "The Emergence of Turkey’s Hidden Jews"], ''The Jerusalem Post,''  24 March 2011, at the Shavei Israel website&lt;/ref&gt; and in the second decade of this century also became active in helping individuals and groups of converts become part of the mainstream Jewish and Israeli communities.&lt;ref name="FishbaneBecoming"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fishbane|first1=Matthew|title=Becoming Moses|url=https://tabletmag.atavist.com/becoming-moses|accessdate=2 May 2016|publisher=Tablet Magazine|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Shavei Israel sponsors rabbis and teachers to work with groups of "lost Jews," provide them the Jewish education and assist them in [[aliyah]] if they choose. Its affiliated rabbis are posted in [[Palma de Mallorca]], [[Barcelona]], [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], [[Granada]], and [[Sevilla]] in [[Spain]]; [[Belmonte Municipality|Belmonte]] in northern [[Portugal]], [[San Nicandro Garganico|San Nicandro]] in southern [[Italy]], [[Brazil]], [[Krakow]] and [[Wroclaw]] in  [[Poland]]; and in [[Mizoram]] and [[Manipur]], in [[North-East India]]. In December 2010,  Rabbi Shlomo Zelig Avrasin was sent to work with the [[Subbotniks|Subbotnik]] [[Jewish]] communities in [[Russia]], particularly [[Vysoky, Talovsky District, Voronezh Oblast|Vysoky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3992298,00.html "Russia's Subbotnik Jews get rabbi"], Ynetnews; accessed 17 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jerusalem, it operates Machon Miriam, a Spanish-language "conversion and return institute."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shavei.org/machon-miriam/?lang=en Machon Miriam], Shavei Israel website&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of Spanish and Portuguese crypto-Jews graduate from Machon Miriam each year, and undergo formal conversion by [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Israel's Chief Rabbinate]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==History==

===Amishav===
'''''Amishav''''' is an organisation distinct from Shavei Israel, which it predates and to whose creation it contributed. It was founded in 1975 by [[Rabbi Eliyahu Avichail]] and follows goals similar to those of Shavei Israel.&lt;ref name="KestenbaumDiaspora"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kestenbaum|first1=Sam|title=The New Jewish Diaspora?|url=http://forward.com/news/339682/the-new-jewish-diaspora/|accessdate=2 May 2016|publisher=The Forward|date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://amishav-onetree.org&lt;/ref&gt; Several years after founding Amishav, Rabbi Avichail stepped aside as leader of the organisation in favour of Michael Freund.  Freund went on to found Shavei Israel in 2002.&lt;ref name="FishbaneBecoming"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KestenbaumDiaspora"/&gt;&lt;ref name="halkin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grassrootsoptions.org/index.php?module=Pagesetter&amp;func=viewpub&amp;tid=4&amp;pid=0 |title=Interview with Hillel Halkin |year=2006 |accessdate=2007-03-03 |work=grassrootsoptions |author=Linda Chhakchhuak }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michael Freund===
Michael Freund, founder and director of Shavei Israel, was reared in Mahhattan and immigrated to Israel 1995. In 1996 he became deputy director of communications under Prime Minister [[Binyamin Netanyahu]].  It was while serving in this post that he first learned of the Bnei Menashe when a letter arrived from the Bnei Menashe community in India beseeching the Prime Minister to enable them to make [[aliyah]].&lt;ref name="KestenbaumDiaspora"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MochkofskyFaithful"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mochkofsky|first1=Graciela|title=The Faithful|url=https://story.californiasunday.com/colombian-church-orthodox-judaism?mc_cid=ac12775c6b&amp;mc_eid=3d01b86f89|accessdate=2 May 2016|publisher=[[California Sunday Magazine]]|date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Freund is the largest single funder of Shavei Israel.&lt;ref name="FishbaneBecoming"/&gt;

===Bnei Menasha of India===
The organization supported the [[Bnei Menashe]] of India in being recognized as "descendants of Israel" by the Israeli Chief Rabbi in March 2005. Shavei Israel assisted with teachers in India.&lt;ref&gt;Itamar Eichner, [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3831308,00.html "Members of Bnei Menashe to make aliyah"], ynetnews.com, 01.08.10&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, a total of 2,000 Bnei Menashe have made [[aliyah]]. The organization assists immigrants with their integration into Israeli society. [[File:Bnei Menashe01 Jusmine.JPG|thumb|left|Bnei Menashe in [[Adloyada]] of [[Purim]] in [[Karmiel|Carmiel]], Israel.]]

As part of its educational efforts, the organization has published a series of books on Judaism in a dozen languages, including Chinese, Japanese, Mizo, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Russian and German.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shavei.org/products-page/?lang=en Book Store], Shavei.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005 Rabbi Shlomo Amar announced the recognition of the Bnei Menashe by Israel and their possibility of immigration under the Law of Return. Those who wanted to immigrate were required to undergo a formal, full conversion as their people had been separated from Judaism for so long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4400957.stm Rabbi backs India's 'lost Jews'], BBC News, South Asia, 1 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2005 the Bnei Menashe completed the construction of a [[mikvah]] in Mizoram under the supervision of Israeli rabbis to start the process of [[conversion to Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/09/17/windia17.xml "India's lost tribe recognized as Jews after 2,700 years"], Peter Foster, Telegraph.co.uk, 17 de 09 de 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Freund supported the resettlement of 218 Bnei Menashe in [[Upper Nazareth]] and [[Karmiel]] in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;''Jerusalem Post''&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 1,700 Bnei Menashe moved to Israel, mainly settlements in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] (until the [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|disengagement]] in 2005).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/123481 "More than 200 Bnei Menashe arriving in Israel"], Israel National News; accessed 17 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
In 2013 Freund learned of a large groups of Latin Americans from Christian families who were converting to orthodox Judaism, thousands or tens of thousands of whom wanted to immigrate to Israel.  Freund began working with Israeli authorities and with the Latin American converts, and the first, small group of converts moved to Israel in June 2015.&lt;ref name="MochkofskyFaithful"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ForeroColombian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Forero|first1=Juan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/from-colombian-evangelicals-to-jews-in-region-with-a-hidden-jewish-past/2012/11/23/04889712-2f2f-11e2-af17-67abba0676e2_story.html|accessdate=2 May 2016|title=Colombian evangelical Christians convert to Judaism, embracing hidden past|publisher=Washington Post|date=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Shavei has been criticised for offending followers of non-[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] spiritual traditions and favoring Orthodox Israeli Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Socolovsky,[http://www.ourjerusalem.com/news/story/news20031018.html "For Portugal's crypto-Jews, new rabbi tries to blend tradition with local custom"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927034206/http://www.ourjerusalem.com/news/story/news20031018.html |date=2007-09-27 }}, Our Jerusalem.com, 13 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mass conversion of Mizo-Kuki peoples aroused the concern of the Indian government, as it prohibits proselytizing. In November 2005 Israel recalled the Rabbinic Court teams which had been preparing several hundred Bnei Menashe for conversion to calm the concerns of the [[Government of India|Indian government]]. At the time, some Hindu groups complained that the government had paid more attention to Christian complaints of proselytizing than to their own about Christian missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Surya Narain Saxena,

After suspending the issuance of visas to Bnei Menashe for a few years, in January 2010 the Israeli government announced that the remaining 7,200 Bnei Menashe could make aliyah within a period of 1–2 years after completing conversion at facilities in Nepal. This allowed them to avoid problems with India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3831308,00.html "Members of Bnei Menashe to make aliyah"], Arutz Sheva; accessed 17 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suppressive Person''', often abbreviated '''SP''', is a term used in [[Scientology]] to describe the "antisocial personalities" who, according to Scientology's founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]], make up about 2.5% of the population. A statement on a [[Church of Scientology]] website describes this group as including notorious historic figures such as [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;Reitman, Janet "Inside Scientology:Unlocking the complex code of America's most mysterious religion", Rolling Stone, February 2006 pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is often applied to those whom the Church perceives as its enemies, such as those whose "disastrous" and "suppressive" acts are said to impede the progress of individual Scientologists or the Scientology movement.&lt;ref&gt;Paulick, James "Scientology Wins Court Battle in Germany",Deustche Welle, 28 April 2008  - According to Hubbard, "a Suppressive Person or Group is one that actively seeks to suppress or damage Scientology or a Scientologist by Suppressive Acts….A Suppressive Person or Group becomes 'fair game.'" - http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1567596,00.html Retrieved 7 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the reasons Scientology doctrines portray Suppressive Persons as such a danger is that they are supposed to make people around them become '''Potential Trouble Sources''' (abbreviated '''PTS''').  Scientology defines a PTS as "a person who is in some way connected to and being adversely affected by a suppressive person. Such a person is called a potential trouble source because he can be a lot of trouble to himself and to others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientology.org/feature/glossary/index.html#p |title=Church of Scientology Official Site |publisher=Scientology |accessdate=2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard suggested that Potential Trouble Sources make up 17.5% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Sommer, Mark "Breaking In, Breaking Out", Buffalo News, 31 January 2005 - "A PTS is someone from among the 20 percent of the population that Hubbard declared was predisposed against Scientology."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and definitions==
As with most Scientology terminology, "Suppressive Person" was coined by [[L. Ron Hubbard]]. In her book ''[[Another Gospel (book)|Another Gospel: Cults, Alternative Religions, and the New Age Movement]]'', Ruth A. Tucker wrote that the concept appeared to have first been introduced into Scientology in the 1960s "as membership grew and as authoritarian control [by Hubbard] increased." Tucker notes that many of those who joined Scientology during this period were "well-educated people who prided themselves in independent thinking [who] struggled with the idea of allowing any other individual to completely dominate their opinions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tucker, Ruth A. Tucker|title=[[Another Gospel (book)|Another Gospel: Cults, Alternative Religions, and the New Age Movement]]|page= 313|publisher=Zondervan|date= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Hubbard's early writings on Suppressive Persons focus on their alleged responsibility for poor management within the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hubbard, L. Ron||title=HCO Policy Letter |date= August 7, 1965|work=Suppressive Persons, Main Characteristics Of}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Urban, Hugh B. "Fair Game: Secrecy, Security, and the Church of Scientology in Cold War America." Journal of the American Academy of Religion 74.2 (2006): 356-389.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church's official glossary defines a Suppressive Person as being:
:a person who possesses a distinct set of characteristics and mental attitudes that cause him to suppress other people in his vicinity. This is the person whose behavior is calculated to be disastrous. Also called ''[[Ethics (Scientology)|antisocial personality]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Scientology Glossary | publisher = Church of Scientology International | url = http://www.scientology.org/en_US/feature/glossary/index.html#s | accessdate = 2006-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church regards these "antisocial personalities" as being those "who possess characteristics and mental attitudes that cause them to violently oppose any betterment activity or group,"&lt;ref name="The ASP"&gt;[http://www.scientologyethics.org/page06.htm Scientology Ethics and Judicial Matters: The Antisocial Personality] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616081621/http://scientologyethics.org/page06.htm |date=2006-06-16 }}.  Website accessed 2006-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; This concern with "groups" continues in the official ''[[Scientology Handbook]]'', which states the corollary: "The antisocial personality supports only destructive groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=CSI | title=The Antisocial Personality |  work=How Can Scientology Help Me With...? | url=http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/sh11_1.htm | accessdate=2006-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policies and practices==
According to the Hubbard textbook ''Introduction to Scientology Ethics'' ("the Ethics book"), when an individual is found to be under the influence of a Suppressive Person, it is believed that this will affect their general well-being.  An individual with an SP in their vicinity is likely to be under stress or frequently upset, and this would potentially jeopardize the stability of any treatment or education. Therefore, a parishioner who is found to have such suppressive connections is not permitted to participate in certain Scientology classes and counseling until the situation has been adequately resolved.

The Ethics book provides a guideline for use in sorting out such a condition.  A first step is always to educate the person about the phenomenon of the Suppressive Person and the effects this is believed to have on the individuals close to the SP.  Once the education step is completed, the person can further follow the guidelines to sort out the situation so that the parishioner is no longer negatively affected.

[[List of Scientology Security Checks|Scientology Security checks]] are also common for SP and PTS situations. If reasonable attempts have been made to "handle" the situation to no avail, the parishioner may take the option of "[[disconnection|disconnecting]]" from the SP. In ''Introduction to Scientology Ethics'', "disconnection" is defined as a self-determined decision made by an individual that he is not going to be connected to another.  It is a severing of communication by one individual against the other.

The concept of the Suppressive Person in Scientology has been the source of some controversy, due in some part to aversion to the idea of "disconnecting" from close family members and friends.

Another source of controversy related to the Suppressive Person doctrine is the formal administrative judgment that labels an individual a "Suppressive Person." This is known as an "SP Declare," and has been issued as a "Flag Ethics Order" since 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientology-lies.com/documents/ethics-order.html Ethics Orders], assembled from various documents&lt;/ref&gt; This is because presently, an SP Declare needs to be approved by the "International Justice Chief" (IJC),&lt;ref&gt;HCOPL 19 October 1976 "SP/SG Terminals", p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; who resides at [[Gold Base]], which is not a formal Scientology office and thus not authorized to issue Ethics Orders.&lt;ref&gt;HCOPL ?? ???? 1978 "Riverside Gold Center Facility", p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Scientologists can be and have been labelled Suppressive Persons. A Suppressive Person is anyone who has been responsible for "suppressive acts," defined by Hubbard as being "the overt or covert actions or omissions knowingly and willfully undertaken to suppress, reduce, prevent or destroy case gains, and/or the influence of Scn on activities, and/or the continued Scn success and actions on the part of organizations actions and Scientologists."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, in ''Modern Management Technology Defined'', p. 509&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, entire groups can be declared Suppressive; Suppressive Groups, in Hubbard's view, are "those which seek to destroy Scn or which specialize in injuring or killing persons or damaging their cases or which advocate suppression of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this broader definition, suppressiveness included more than just publicly opposing Scientology; it also included any group supporting activities to which Hubbard was strongly opposed, especially [[psychiatry]]. Specifically, Hubbard considered reporters and government agents to be members of Suppressive Groups: "There are no good reporters. There are no good government or SP group agents. The longer you try to be nice, the worse off you will be. And the sooner one learns this, the happier he will be."&lt;ref&gt;HCOPL 26 December 1966 "PTS Sections, Personnel and Execs", p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology maintains a central list of ex-members and splinter groups formally declared to be Suppressive. In an executive directive of 1992, the Church's "International Justice Chief" lists over 400 groups and over 2,300 individuals considered to be Suppressive.&lt;ref&gt;Flag Executive Directive 2830RB of 25 July 1992, "Suppressive Persons and Suppressive Groups" list, exhibited in ''Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz'', No. CV 91-6426 HLH (Tx), April 4, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The list includes individual ex-Scientologists and breakaway groups regarded as hostile or heretical, such as [[Erhard Seminars Training]] (EST).

=== Abuse of the label ===
In a lecture he made on 19 July 1966, [[L. Ron Hubbard]] expressed concern about the possible abuse of the "Suppressive Person" label in respect of those who are otherwise good citizens and contribute to civil society:

:You should upgrade your idea of what an SP is.  Man, meet one sometime!  A real one!  A real monster....Well, in all the time we've been around here we only had one SP that I know of.  One real SP that was on staff.... And I don't know of another single SP that we've ever had on staff.  Isn't that interesting.  You see all these SP orders and so on...Don't throw it around carelessly, because this is an--a very exaggerated condition, SP.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "About Rhodesia," lecture, 19 July 1966, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course tape transcripts, Lecture Set 421-434, pp. 223-224&lt;/ref&gt;

Some former Scientologists have alleged that there has indeed been such abuse. For example, [[Bent Corydon]] describes seeing Scientology franchise holder Gary Smith declared Suppressive on the spot during the October 1982 Mission Holders' Conference, simply for not obeying a shouted order to change his seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Corydon | first = Bent | authorlink = Bent Corydon |author2=L. Ron Hubbard, Jr. |authorlink2=Ronald DeWolf  | year = 1987 | title = L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman? | publisher = Lyle Stuart | location = Secaucus, New Jersey | isbn = 0-8184-0444-2}}, pp. 204-205. An online edition of the book is at [http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/mom/Messiah_or_Madman.txt ].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--p. 204-5--&gt;
There are also instances where SP declarations have disrupted families and businesses.&lt;ref name="unperson"&gt;{{cite news |author = Robert Farley |url = http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/24/Tampabay/The_unperson.shtml |title = The unperson |publisher = [[St. Petersburg Times]] |date = 2006-06-24 |pages = 1A, 14A|accessdate = 2006-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2006 ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' article entitled "SP profiles", one Scientologist found himself declared an SP after he repeatedly challenged the validity of a "patter drill" in which he was instructed to read passages of a course to a wall.  He insisted the drill was not based on Hubbard teachings and stated that he had been previously threatened with an SP declare after a run-in with a Scientology attorney on an unrelated issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/25/Tampabay/Church_spokesman_says.shtml |title='&amp;#39;Church spokesman says Times report is unfair'&amp;#39; By ROBERT FARLEY, St. Petersburg Times Staff Writer; Published June 25, 2006. Retrieved 2007-06-24 |publisher=Sptimes.com |accessdate=2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views by religious scholars on disconnection===
{{main article|Disconnection}}
Those who communicate with Suppressive Persons can face being branded SPs themselves by Scientology. Associates of the branded SP are ordered to disconnect from that person. Religious scholars have taken a negative view of Scientology's disconnection policies, which includes many who have previously testified on behalf of Scientology. For example, religious scholar [[J. Gordon Melton]] stated, "I just think it would be better for all concerned if they just let them go ahead and get out and everyone goes their own way, and not make such a big deal of it. The policy hurts everybody."&lt;ref&gt;Farley, Rob (June 25, 2006). [http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/25/Tampabay/The_unperson.shtml "The unperson"]. ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taulihawa is located roughly {{convert|25|km}} to the south-west of [[Lumbini]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] and the birthplace of [[Gautama Buddha]].&lt;ref name=UNESC01997&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/180|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre - World Heritage Committee Inscribes 46 New Sites on World Heritage List|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/666|title=Lumbini, the Birthplace of the Lord Buddha|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kapilavastu was an ancient city and the capital city of the [[Shakya]] kingdom.
King [[Śuddhodana]] and [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Queen Māyā]] are believed to have lived at Kapilavastu, as did their son Prince Siddartha Gautama until he [[Gautama Buddha#Renunciation and ascetic life|left the palace]] at the age of 29.&lt;ref name=EoB2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Trainor|first=K|editor-last=Keown|editor-first=D|editor2-last=Prebish|editor2-first=CS|title=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|chapter=Kapilavastu|pages=436–7|publisher=Routledge|location=Milton Park, UK|year=2010|isbn=978-0-415-55624-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFpcAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=kapil#v=onepage&amp;q=kapilavatthu&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Truman Washington Dailey''', (October 19, 1898 &amp;ndash; December 16, 1996) 
also known as '''Mashi Manyi''' ("Soaring High") and  '''Sunge Hka''' ("White Horse"), was the [[terminal speaker|last native speaker]] of the Otoe-Missouria dialect of [[Chiwere language|Chiwere]] (Baxoje-Jiwere-Nyut'chi), a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] language. He was a member of the [[Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians]].

== Early life ==
He was born on October 19, 1898, on the [[Otoe tribe|Otoe-Missouria]] reservation in [[Oklahoma Territory]]. His father, George Washington Dailey, was a member of the Eagle Clan of the [[Missouri tribe|Missouria]] and belonged to a traditionalist group within the combined Otoe-Missouria tribe called the "Coyote Band." As a result, Truman Dailey was well-versed in the traditional lore of his people. Dailey attended [[Oklahoma A&amp;M College]] until 1922. While at Oklahoma A&amp;M, Dailey performed in the college band and was made a member of [[Kappa Kappa Psi]] band fraternity. In 1928, he married Lavina Koshiway, daughter of Jonathan Koshiway, who was one of the founders of the [[Native American Church]]. By 1938, Truman and Lavina were conducting their own church services, where he was considered a [[Road Man]] (ceremonial leader). During the next decade Dailey served in administrative offices in the Native American Church of Oklahoma and the newly formed Native American Church of the United States.

== Later life and career ==
During the 1960s, Dailey worked at [[Disneyland]] as the announcer for the American Indian programs. When [[Walt Disney]] hired him, he allowed Dailey to use one of his own Indian names in the show, simply changing it to "Chief White Horse". During this time he also appeared on ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]''. After leaving California, he and Lavina returned to Oklahoma in 1970, where he taught the Otoe-Missouria language in tribal classes and later served as a consultant for the [[University of Missouri]] native language project, in order to record Otoe-Missouria for posterity. Dailey remained a vocal advocate of Native American ceremonial rights. In 1974, he testified in Washington, DC, and in Omaha, NE, regarding the ceremonial use of feathers and other natural objects in opposition to the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Law]]. Dailey also testified before the [[United States Senate]] Select Committee on Indian Affairs in 1978 (Senate Joint Resolution 102). The resulting legislation, the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]], was signed into law by [[Jimmy Carter|President Carter]] but was only partially successful, so that in 1992, Dailey, now 93 years of age, was called upon once again to give testimony to the Senate committee. This time the subject was the [[Native American Church]]'s most notable characteristic, the ceremonial use of [[peyote]]. The resulting amendment to the Act legalized the use of peyote for official Native American religious purposes. The following year, the University of Missouri at Columbia awarded him an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters. Lavina Koshiway Dailey had died in 1988. Truman Dailey died on December 16, 1996, and was buried next to her in the Otoe-Missouria Tribal Cemetery.

'''Tua Pek Kong''' ({{zh|c=大伯公|p=Dàbó Gōng}}, [[Hakka]]: Thai phak koong, [[Hokkien]]: Tuā-peh-kong, [[Cantonese]]: daai6-baak3-gung1,  {{lang-ms|Topekong}}, {{lang-id|Toa Pekong}}). lit. "grand uncle") is one of the pantheon of Indonesian, [[Malaysian Chinese Gods|Malaysian]], [[Singaporean Chinese religion|Singaporean]] folk religions. He is believed to have arrived in [[Penang]] 40 years before [[Francis Light]] in 1746.

Tua Pek Kong was a man named Zhang Li (张理) from the [[Hakka people|Hakka]] clan. His Indonesian [[Sumatra]]-bound boat was struck by wind and accidentally landed on [[Penang]] island of [[Malaysia]], which at that time had only 50 inhabitants. After his death, the local people began worshipping him and built the Tua Pek Kong temple there. Today Tua Pek Kong is worshipped by [[Malaysian Chinese]] throughout the country. Tua Pek Kong is often mistaken for [[Tu Di Gong]], partially because of their physical similarities.

[[Chung Keng Quee]] was a principal donor to the Haichu-yu (Sea Pearl) Tua Pek Kong Temple (1865 and 1868) in [[Tanjung Tokong]], [[Penang]]. Another famous temple is the [[Tua Pek Kong Temple, Sibu]] with its 7-storey pagoda and has become a landmark for [[Sibu]].

==History and origin==

The Vanzha are traditionally associated with the craft of weaving. They claim to be [[Rajput]]s who were saved from extermination by the [[Hindu]] goddess Hinglaj mata, who saved them from being exterminated on the condition that they take up weaving. The Vanzha are found mainly in [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] and speak the Kathiawari dialect of [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]].

==Present circumstances==

The Vanzha remain weavers, and weave both cotton and silk clothes. A few Vanzha have now take up tailoring as an occupation. They are [[Hindu]] and many follow the cult of the Ramdev Pir.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  Three edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 1427-1430&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Revelation]] describes a '''war in heaven''' between [[angels]] led by the [[Archangel]] [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] against those led by "the dragon", identified as the [[Devil in Christianity|devil]] or [[Satan]], who are defeated and thrown down to the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|12:7-9|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Gregg+%22lengthiest+of+these%22&amp;btnG= |author=Joan Young Gregg|title=Devils, Women, and Jews: Reflections of the Other in Medieval Sermon Stories|page=28|publisher=[[State University of New York]]|date=1997|isbn=0-7914-3417-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revelation's war in [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]] is related to the idea of [[fallen angel]]s, and possible parallels have been proposed in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

==Revelation 12:7–10==
{{further information|Revelation 12}}
{{quote|7 Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. 8 But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. 9 The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.|Revelation 12:7–10 (NIV)}}

[[File:Paradise Lost 1.jpg|thumb|280px|Michael casts out rebel angels. Illustration by [[Gustave Doré]] for [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.]]

==Interpretations==
The Christian tradition has stories about angelic beings cast down from heaven by God,{{cn|date=October 2018}} often presenting the punishment as inflicted in particular on Satan. As a result of linking this motif with the cited passage of the Book of Revelation, the casting of Satan down from heaven, which other versions of the motif present as an action of God himself, has become attributed to the archangel Michael at the conclusion of a war between two groups of angels, of whom (because of the mention of the dragon's tail casting a third of the stars of heaven to the earth) one third are supposed to have been on the side of Satan, in spite of the fact that the casting down of the stars ({{bibleverse||Revelation|12:4|ESV}}) is recounted as occurring before the start of the "war in heaven" ({{bibleverse||Revelation|12:7|ESV}}).

Commentators have attributed Satan's rebellion to a number of motives, all of which stem from his great pride. These motives include:
* a refusal to bow down to mankind on the occasion of the [[List of first men or women in mythology and religion| creation of man]] - as in the [[Armenia]]n, [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]], and [[Latin]] versions of the ''[[Life of Adam and Eve]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sections 14-15 of the [http://micro5.mscc.huji.ac.il/~armenia/website/ Armenian,][http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/pseudepigrapha/TheBookOfAdam.htm Georgian], and [http://www.ccel.org/c/charles/otpseudepig/adamnev.htm Latin] versions of the ''Life of Adam and Eve''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islam]]ic tradition holds a similar view: [[Devil (Islam)|Iblis]] refuses to bow down to [[Islamic views on Adam| Adam]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Quran]] [http://www.cmje.org/religious-texts/quran/verses/007-qmt.php#007.011 7:11-12]&lt;/ref&gt;
* the culmination of a gradual distancing from God through use of [[free will]] (an idea of [[Origen of Alexandria]]).&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article ''Origen''&lt;/ref&gt;
* a declaration by God that all were to be subject to his Son, the [[Messiah]] (as in Milton's ''Paradise Lost'').&lt;ref&gt;Book 5, lines 654-668 {{cite web |url= http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/lost/pl5.html |title= Archived copy |accessdate= 2008-06-29 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080516062603/http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/lost/pl5.html |archivedate= 16 May 2008 |df= dmy | quote =  [...] but not so wak'd / Satan, so call him now, his former name / Is heard no more [in] Heav'n; he of the first, / If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power, / In favour and præeminence, yet fraught / With envie against the Son of God, that day / Honourd by his great Father, and proclaimd / Messiah King anointed, could not beare / Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaird. / Deep malice thence conceiving &amp; disdain, / Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houre / Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv'd / With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave / Unworshipt, unobey'd the Throne supream / Contemptuous [...].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] states in his sermon ''Wisdom Displayed in Salvation'': &lt;blockquote&gt;"Satan and his angels rebelled against God in heaven, and proudly presumed to try their strength with his.

In the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1911) article "St. Michael the Archangel", [[Frederick Holweck]] wrote: "St. John speaks of the great conflict at the end of time, which reflects also the battle in heaven at the beginning of time." He added that Michael's name "was the war-cry of the good angels in the battle fought in heaven against the enemy and his followers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10275b.htm |author = Holweck, Frederick |title= St. Michael the Archangel |publisher= [[The Catholic Encyclopedia]] |volume= 10 |location= New York |date= 1911 |accessdate= January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) teaches that Revelation 12 concerns an actual event in the [[Pre-existence#Mormonism |pre-mortal existence of man]]. The [[Book of Moses]], included in the LDS "[[standard works]]" canon, references the War in Heaven and Satan's origin as a fallen angel of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last= Top | first= Brent L. | authorlink = Brent L.

Evidence for this interpretation comes from the phrase "the dragon and his angels"&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Matthew|matt|25|41}}&lt;/ref&gt;; this specific phrasing became paramount to the reinforcement of the notion that people associated angels with the [[devil]] preceding the writing of Revelation.

Several modern Bible-commentators view the "war in heaven" in Revelation 12:7–13 as an [[eschatology| eschatological]] vision of the [[End times |end of time]] or as a reference to [[spiritual warfare]] within the [[Christian Church| church]], rather than (as in [[John Milton|Milton's]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'') "the story of the origin of Satan/[[Lucifer]] as an angel who rebelled against God in primeval times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0VC1rzAtgFsC

Such a myth had developed in pre-Christian Judaism (''1-2 En.''), and there are fragmentary echoes of it in the New Testament (Jude 6; 2 Pet. 2:4).

The strength of the church is in having the Lord Jesus for the Captain of their salvation. Pagan idolatry, which was the worship of devils, was cast out of the empire by the spreading of Christianity. [...] The servants of God overcame Satan by the blood of the Lamb, as the cause. By the word of their testimony: the powerful preaching of the gospel is mighty, through God, to pull down strong holds. By their courage and patience in sufferings: they loved not their lives so well but they could lay them down in Christ's cause. These were the warriors and the weapons by which Christianity overthrew the power of pagan idolatry; and if Christians had continued to fight with these weapons, and such as these, their victories would have been more numerous and glorious, and the effects more lasting. The redeemed overcame by a simple reliance on the blood of Christ, as the only ground of their hopes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have seen the ''war in heaven'' as "not literal" but symbolic of events on earth.&lt;ref&gt;''One hundred and seventy three sermons on several subjects'': Volume 1, Page 137 [[Samuel Clarke]], John Clarke, J.

==Hebrew Bible parallels==
{{see also|Cherub in Eden}}
Parallels are drawn to the passage in {{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:4-17|NIV}} that mentions the "son of the morning" that had "fallen from heaven" and was "cast down to the earth". In verse 12 of this passage, the [[Hebrew]] word that referred to the morning star was translated into Latin as [[Lucifer]]. With the application to the Devil of the morning star story, "Lucifer" was then applied to him as a proper name. The name Lucifer, the [[Latin]] name (literally "Light-Bearer" or "Light-Bringer") for the morning star (the planet [[Venus (astronomy)|Venus]] in its morning appearances), is often given to the Devil in these stories. The brilliancy of the morning star—which eclipses all other stars, but is not seen during the night—may be what gave rise to myths such as the [[Babylonia]]n story of Ethana and Zu, who was led by his pride to strive for the highest seat among the star-gods on the northern mountain of the gods (an image present also in {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|28:14}}), but was hurled down by the supreme ruler of the Babylonian Olympus.&lt;ref name=JE-L&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=612&amp;letter=L |title=Lucifer |website=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stars were then regarded as living celestial beings.&lt;ref name=JE-L/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Job|38:7|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' states that the myth concerning the Morning star was transferred to Satan by the first century before the [[Common Era]], citing in support of this view the ''[[Life of Adam and Eve]]'' and the [[2 Enoch|Slavonic Book of Enoch]] 29:4, 31:4, where Satan-[[Sataniel]] is described as having been one of the archangels. Because he contrived "to make his throne higher than the clouds over the earth and resemble 'My power' on high", Satan-Sataniel was hurled down, with his angels, and since then he has been flying in the air continually above the [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]]. According to Jewish thought, the passage in ''Isaiah'' was used to prophesy the fate of the [[List of Kings of Babylon|King of Babylon]], who is described as aiming to rival God.&lt;ref name=JE-L/&gt;

==Dead Sea Scrolls==
Some scholars discern the concept of a war in heaven in certain [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], namely, the [[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]], also known as the [[War Scroll]] (1QM and 4Q491-497), the [[Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice]], Song 5 (4Q402), and the Melchizedek document ([[11Q13]]).

In the War Scroll, according to Menahem Mansoor, the angels of light, who are identified with Michael, the prince of light, will fight in heaven against the angels of darkness, who are identified with [[Belial]], while the Sons of Light fight the Sons of Darkness on earth, and during the last of the seven battles described in the scroll will come and help the Sons of Light win the final victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Mansoor+%22seven+battles+described%22&amp;btnG= |title=Mansoor "seven battles described" - Google Search}}{{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James R. Davila]] speaks of Song 5 of the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice as describing "an eschatological war in heaven similar to that found in 11Q13 and to traditions about the archangel Michael in the War Rule and the book of Revelation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Davila+%22war+in+heaven+similar%22&amp;btnG=|author=James R. Davila|title=The Dead Sea scrolls as background to postbiblical Judaism and early Christianity: papers from an international conference at St. Andrews in 2001|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|location=Leiden|date=2003|isbn=978-90-04-12678-7|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests that [[Melchizedek]], who is mentioned both in the Melchizedek document and the fifth of the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, may be a divine warrior who is involved in the conflict with the archangel Michael in the [[futurist]] sense.

That the Melchizedek document (11Q13) concerns a war in heaven is denied by Fred L. Horton, who remarks that "there is no hint in the extant portion of the 11Q Melchizedek of a revolt of heavenly beings against the heavenly council, and the only dissenting spirit is the traditional Belial";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Horton+%22only+dissenting+spirit%22&amp;btnG= |author=Fred L. Horton|title=The Melchizedek Tradition|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=2005|isbn=978-0-521-01871-5|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; the view of Davila, however, is that the document originally was about an eschatological war in heaven, with Melchizedek as angelic high priest and military redeemer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Angel+%22originally+described+the+eschatological%22&amp;btnG= |author=Joseph L.

==Depiction==
The [[motif (narrative)|motif]] of the fall of Satan and his angels can be found in Christian [[angelology]] and [[Christian art]], and the concept of fallen angels (who, for rebelling against God, were downgraded and condemned to being earthbound) is widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=24&amp;letter=F |title=Fall Of Angels |website=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
[[Anatole France]] in the 1914 novel ''{{lang|fr|[[Revolt of the Angels|La Révolte des Anges]]}}'' adapted the Christian references to make a parable about revolts and revolutionary movements.

In Milton's ''Paradise Lost'' (1674), the angel Lucifer leads a rebellion against God before the [[Fall of Man]]. A third of the angels, including [[Paganism|pagan]] angels such as [[Moloch]] and [[Belial]], are hurled by [[God]] from Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/pl/book_1/text.shtml}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
The subject of the War in Heaven has been depicted by many noted artists, both in paintings and in sculptures, including works by [[Pieter Paul Rubens]], [[Guido Reni]] and [[Jacob Epstein]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8511">'''Yatiri''' are medical practitioners and community healers among the [[Aymara people|Aymara]] of [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]] and [[Peru]], who use in their practice both symbols and materials such as [[coca]] leaves.  Yatiri are a special subclass of the more generic category [[Qulliri]], a term used for any traditional healer in Aymara society.

==Current status of the Yatiri==
===Politics===
As a result of current events in [[Bolivia]], Yatiris and anything related to their practices have become quite popular, as a reaction against perceived threats from [[globalization]] and Western culture, especially anything related to the USA.  [http://www.eldiario.net El Diario, Bolivian newspaper], mentions offerings made to the Pachamama and other such deities at most contemporary 2007 government events led by President [[Evo Morales]].

==Problems faced by Yatiri==
===Historical===
As a result of Spanish colonization and the influence of Western culture, the Yatiri face pressure from the Western notion of individualism, as opposed to the traditional Aymara concept of community.  The Christian church has also often ostracised the Yatiri, perceiving their role to be superfluous in modern religious practice, and a form of [[paganism]].
This has changed as current government officials openly support Yatiri presence in events that formerly might have had a Catholic chaplain under the terms and practice of the [[Concordat]] with the [[Holy See]].
Nevertheless, normal practice for most Andean people mixes practices from both traditions, for example in the '''cha'lla'', a blessing bestowed on any form of property, often done with both sacrifices to the Pachamama and Catholic prayers.

===Generational===
The Western educational system has introduced to the Aymara people a strong Western orientation that often alienates younger generations from appreciation of the Yatiri.

===Modern Medicine===
Whereas the Aymara perceive 'health' to be a relationship with nature, with members of the community, and with ancestors; and the Yatiri play a vital role in strengthening and repairing these relationships, Western medicine treats health as an isolated problem within an individual and does not have a place for the role of community healers.

==Terminology==
Several Aymara words and phrases are indispensable for an understanding of the role of Yatiri within the Aymara community.  As these concepts are unique to the Aymara setting, there is no adequate English translation.
''Qulliri'' are healers associated with medicinal herbs, and require no special initiation to take up their vocation.
''[[Layqa]]'', traditionally marginalized and shunned, live on the outskirts of Aymara communities and use frogs and snakes in rituals to do harm to others.  One becomes a ''layqa'' by agreeing (usually for a price) to do these rituals to harm a person, on behalf of a client.
''Rayu'' refers to lightning and its physical manifestations. Those who have been struck by lightning are often called ''rayun purita'' ("struck by lightning") or ''purita'' ("arrived"). It is these ''purita'' who have been called to become ''yatiri''. In their healing ceremonies, ''yatiri'' interact with (among other things) ''achachilas'' and ''ruwitus''. ''Achachilas'' are ancestors different from biological ancestors, and ''ruwitus'' are human skulls that are considered to be dead elders in either a generational or a cultural sense. ''Ch'amakani'' ("someone who has or owns the darkness") is an elder ''yatiri'' who undertakes the training of an apprentice ''yatiri''-to-be.

==The Yatiri in the Community==
===Are Yatiri Shamans?===
Outsiders have often referred to the Yatiri as '[[Shamanism|shamans]];' however the role of the Yatiri differs markedly from that of the Central Asian shamans.  Shamans typically live and practice in isolation, undergo private and individual initiations to their roles, and practice ecstatic techniques in conjunction with their work.  They also typically learn to heal by learning to heal themselves after a near-death experience.  In contrast, the Yatiri are full members of Aymara communities who participate in the regular lifestyle of the Aymara, and learn their trade from masters.  Like shamans, Yatiri can be both female and male.

===Linguistic Approach to Define the Yatiri===
The word ''yatiri'' comes from the verb ''yatiña'' 'to know.'  Thus a yatiri is literally 'someone who knows.'  The thing that distinguishes yatiri from others in the community is that they have been struck by lightning, and have become yatiri.  The lightning strike is a sign of having been called, but it does not automatically make one a yatiri.  In modern times, because '''qulliri''' is a neutral term, not associated by Westerners with sorcery, many yatiri have been called qulliri when outsiders inquire as to their status.  Strictly speaking, yatiri ''are'' qulliri, but they are a special class of qulliri who have also experienced the lightning strike and undergone initiation to become yatiri.  Yatiri are never called 'yatiri' to their face, but rather are referred to as '''ak'ulliri''' "''someone who chews coca''", '''aytiri''' "''someone who picks up the coca''" or '''uñiri''' "''someone who reads coca''."

==On Becoming Yatiri==
There are many factors at play in a person's calling to become a yatiri.  Who a person will become is affected by the season in which she is born, by her patron saint, and by her '''ichutata ichumama''' (a specific kind of godparent).  The confirmation of this calling, however, is marked by the lightning strike, which typically happens to an unmarried Aymara out herding the flocks.  The lightning strike marks her as '''purita''', "one who is struck."  However, occasionally lightning will strike somebody who is not called, making her a '''pantata''' "one who has been struck mistakenly."  At the lightning strike, the purita is said to have died and passed from death to rebirth; in fact if anyone else witnesses this strike it is believed that the purita will die.  If a person has the signs of a yatiri, and has been struck by lightning, she is a purita and cannot refuse the call to become a yatiri.  Likewise, a person who does not have the signs and has not been struck, may not seek to become a yatiri.  Once a yatiri-to-be has aged a few years, she undertakes a journey to find her '''ch'amakani''', the senior yatiri who will train her.  Hilario, the yatiri interviewed by Tomas Huanca in his 1987 thesis traveled three times to his ch'amakani's homeland, each time as a traveling musician, and once there received tutoring from Hilario, his ch'amakani.  When the candidate is ready to become a yatiri, she will ask permission of the '''achachila''' (spiritual ancestor) through her ch'amakani.

==The Yatiri's Role in Healing==
A yatiri is a full participant in the Aymara community; her special role does not relieve her from the social and agricultural duties shared by all community members.  She never makes the first move in healing, but always waits for someone who has a complaint or a problem to consult her.  Just as she is obliged to wait for requests, the yatiri is likewise obliged to treat all who do come to her.  She typically exercises her role at home in the presence of either the patient or someone who is acting on the patient's behalf.  Occasionally, the yatiri's ritual helpers will indicate that she must treat the patient in person, or travel to a ritual place in order to give an offering.  She will also practice outside her home if the patient requests such.  The principal helper in the yatiri's curing ceremony is the '''riwutu''' or human skull.  Riwutu are ancestors who have been killed, usually by "robbers," and are seen as an intermediary between the world of humans and that of the dead.  The riwutu is placed together with saxra bullets (small pieces of metal or stone that have been fused together by lightning), as well as with '''tari''' llama wool, coca, and sculptures of the saints.  If the yatiri has been asked to discover a lost object or one taken by thieves, she may use candles in her  ceremony.  If she is to heal somebody ill, she may use a piece of cloth-- '''isi'''-- that has touched the patient.

'''Yogini''' (spelled also jogan)
, {{IPA-sa|ˈjoganː|IPA}} is the feminine Sanskrit word of the masculine ''[[yogi]]'', while the term "[[yogin]]" is used in neutral, masculine or feminine sense.&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, Sanskrit English Dictionary with Etymology, Oxford University Press, योगिन्, Archive: [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/tamil/recherche yogini]&lt;/ref&gt; More than a gender label for all things yogi, ''yogini'' represents both a female master practitioner of [[yoga]] and a formal term of respect for female Hindu or Buddhist spiritual teachers in [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Tibet]].

In the Hindu tradition, ''yogini'' has referred of women who are part of the [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga school]] of Hindu traditions and to the women who were part of the [[Gorakshanath]] founded Nath Yogi tradition.{{sfn|White|2012|pp=8-9, 234-256, 454-467}} A Yogini, in some contexts, refers to the sacred feminine force made incarnate, as an aspect of [[Parvati]], and revered in yogini temples of India as the Eight Matrikas or the Sixty-four Yoginis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/orissareview/oct2004/englishPdf/originoftantricism.pdf Chaudhury, Janmejay.

N., ''History of the Sakta Religion'', Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt. Ltd. (New Delhi, 1974, 2d ed. 1996), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Yogini also refers to women who are a part of Hindu and Buddhist tantra traditions.&lt;ref name=ritagross87&gt;Rita Gross (1993), Buddhism After Patriarchy, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|978-0791414033}}, page 87, 85-88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Gordon White (2013), Tantra in Practice, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120817784}}, pages xiii-xv&lt;/ref&gt; In Tantric Buddhism, Miranda Shaw states that a large number of women like Dombiyogini, Sahajayogicinta, Lakshminkara, Mekhala, Kankhala Gangadhara, Siddharajni, and others, were respected yoginis and advanced seekers on the path to [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Miranda.  ''Passionate Enlightenment:  Women in Tantric Buddhism'', Princeton University Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Tibetan Buddhism and Bön tradition, some [[ngagmas]] are comparable, in practice, to the [[Mahasidda]] yoginis of Indian Buddhism.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

==Yogini in history==
Yogini (jogan) is a term that finds reference in ancient and medieval texts in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], typically in the context of and as aspect of [[Devi]]. The ''Devi Sukta'' of the [[Rigveda]] 10.125.1 through 10.125.8, is among the most studied hymns declaring that the ultimate [[metaphysic]]al reality ([[Brahman]]) is a Devi,{{Sfn| McDaniel |2004|p=90}}{{Sfn| Brown |1998|p=26}}

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
I have created all worlds at my will, without being urged by any higher being, and I dwell within them.
I permeate the earth and heaven, all created entities with my greatness, and dwell in them as eternal and infinite consciousness.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Devi Sukta, Rigveda 10.125.8|Translated by June McDaniel{{Sfn| McDaniel |2004|p=90}}{{Sfn| Brown |1998|p=26}}&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit original see: [https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.१२५ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं १०.१२५];&lt;br&gt;for an alternate English translation, see: [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rig_Veda/Mandala_10/Hymn_125 The Rig Veda/Mandala 10/Hymn 125] Ralph T.H.

The [[Vedas]] include numerous goddesses including [[Ushas]] (dawn), [[Prithvi]] (earth), [[Aditi]] (cosmic moral order), [[Saraswati]] (river, knowledge), [[Vāc]] (sound), [[Nirṛti]] (destruction), [[Ratri]] (night), Aranyani (forest), and bounty goddesses such as Dinsana, Raka, Puramdhi, Parendi, Bharati, and Mahi among others are mentioned in the ''[[Rigveda]]''.&lt;ref name=kinsley717&gt;David Kinsley (2005), Hindu Goddesses: Vision of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-8120803947}}, pages 6-17, 55-64&lt;/ref&gt; However, the women are not discussed as frequently as men.&lt;ref name=kinsley717/&gt; All gods and goddesses are distinguished in the Vedic times,&lt;ref name=kinsley18&gt;David Kinsley (2005), Hindu Goddesses: Vision of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-8120803947}}, pages 18, 19&lt;/ref&gt; but in the post-Vedic texts, particularly in the early medieval era literature, they are ultimately seen as aspects or manifestations of one Universal Absolute, the Supreme power, [[Para Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher John Fuller (2004), The Camphor Flame: Popular Hinduism and Society in India, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691120485}}, page 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest evidence of Yogis and their spiritual tradition, states Karel Werner, is found in the Kesin hymn of the [[Vedas]], where these yogins are praised.&lt;ref&gt;Karel Werner (1977), Yoga and the Ṛg Veda: An Interpretation of the Keśin Hymn (RV 10, 136), Religious Studies, Vol. 13, No. 3, page 289; '''Quote:''' The Yogis of Vedic times left little evidence of their existence, practices and achievements. And such evidence as has survived in the Vedas is scanty and indirect. Nevertheless, the existence of accomplished Yogis in Vedic times cannot be doubted."&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no mention that these Vedic era Yogi included women. Scholars note that some ancient Vedic sages ([[Rishi]]s) were women.&lt;ref&gt;Swami [[Vivekananda]] public lecture, Vedanta Voice of Freedom, {{ISBN|0-916356-63-9}}, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daughters of the Goddess:  Women Saints of India, by Linda Johnsen PhD.,  Yes Int'l Publishers, 1994, pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; A female rishi is known as a ''rishika''.&lt;ref&gt;The Shambhala Encyclopedia of YOGA, p.244&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''yogini'' has been in use in medieval times to refer to a woman who belongs to the [[Gorakshanath]]-founded Nath Yogi tradition.{{sfn|White|2012|p=8-9}} They usually belong to Shaiva tradition, but some Natha belong to the Vaishnava tradition.&lt;ref name=lorenzenmunozx&gt;David N. Lorenzen and Adrián Muñoz (2012), Yogi Heroes and Poets: Histories and Legends of the Naths, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|978-1438438900}}, pages x-xi&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, states David Lorenzen, they practice [[Yoga]] and their principal God tends to be ''Nirguna'', that is a God that is without form and semi-[[Monism|monistic]],&lt;ref name=lorenzenmunozx/&gt; influenced in the medieval era by the [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism, [[Madhyamaka]] school of Buddhism, as well as Tantra and Yogic practices.&lt;ref&gt;David Lorenzen (2004), Religious Movements in South Asia, 600-1800, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195664485}}, pages 310-311&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David N. Lorenzen and Adrián Muñoz (2012), Yogi Heroes and Poets: Histories and Legends of the Naths, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|978-1438438900}}, pages 24-25&lt;/ref&gt; Female yoginis were a large part of this tradition, and many 2nd-millennium paintings depict them and their Yoga practices. David Lorenzen states that the Nath yogis have been very popular with the rural population in South Asia, with medieval era tales and stories about Nath yogis continuing to be remembered in contemporary times, in the Deccan, western and northern states of India and in Nepal.&lt;ref name=lorenzenmunozx/&gt;

In medieval mythology such as [[Kathāsaritsāgara]], ''yogini'' is also the name of a class of females with magical powers, fairies who are sorceresses sometimes enumerated as 8, 60, 64 or 65.&lt;ref&gt;[[Monier-Williams]], ''Sanskrit Dictionary'' (1899).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Hatha-Yoga-Pradipika'' text mentions Yogini.&lt;ref&gt;The Shambhala Encyclopedia of Yoga, Georg Feurstein Ph.D., Shambhala Publications, Boston 2000, p.350&lt;/ref&gt;

In real life, historical evidence on ''Yogini Kaulas'' suggests that yogini tradition in Hinduism, who practiced Yoga philosophy and Tantra, were well established by the 10th century.{{sfn|White|2012|p=73-75, 132-141}} This development was not limited to Hinduism, and included Yogini in Buddhist tantra traditions.{{sfn|White|2012|p=73-75, 132-141}}

===Temples to the Sixty-four Yogini===
[[File:Yoginis in a circular format.JPG|thumb|Chausathi Jogini ('Sixty-four Yogini') Temple located at Hirapur, [[Odisha]].]]
[[File:Hirapur ei02-47.jpg|thumb|One of the Yogini of Chausathi Jogini Temple at Hirapur, [[Odisha]].]]
[[File:Chausath Yogini Temple (16313518811).jpg|thumb|8th-century Chausath Yogini Temple in [[Madhya Pradesh]].]]

There are four major extant shrines of the Sixty-four Yogini (''Chausathi jogan''), among other spellings) in India (named for 64 legendary yogini), two in [[Odisha]] and two in [[Madhya Pradesh]]. One of the most impressive yogini temples in Odisha is the ninth century CE [[hypaethral]] [[Chausathi Jogini Temple]] located at Hirapur in [[Khurda district]], 15&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Bhubaneshwar]]. Another hypaethral sixty-four yogini temple in Odisha is the Chausathi Yogini Pitha in [[Ranipur-Jharial]], near [[Titilagarh]] in [[Balangir district]]. Two images of the Sixty-four Yogini are missing from this temple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orissagov.nic.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/aug2004/engishPdf/Pages41-44.pdf Patel, C.B. ''Monumental Efflorescence of Ranipur-Jharial'' in ''Orissa Review'', August 2004, pp.41-44] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015200/http://orissagov.nic.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/aug2004/engishPdf/Pages41-44.pdf |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two notable yogini temples in [[Madhya Pradesh]] are the ninth-century Chaunsath Yogini Temple to the southwest of the western group of temples in [[Khajuraho]], near Chhatarpur in [[Chhatarpur District]], and the 10th century CE Chaunsath Yogini Mandir in [[Bhedaghat]], near [[Jabalpur]] in [[Jabalpur district]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jabalpur.nic.in/aboutus.htm Jabalpur district official website – about us] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814182114/http://jabalpur.nic.in/aboutus.htm |date=August 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devata.org/2010/03/chausath-yogini-temple-complete-inventory-of-goddesses-and-gods/ Chausath Yogini Temple - Site Plan, Photos and Inventory of Goddesses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417084708/http://www.devata.org/2010/03/chausath-yogini-temple-complete-inventory-of-goddesses-and-gods/ |date=April 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iconographies of the yogini images in four yogini temples are not uniform. In the Hirapur temple, all yogini images are with their ''vahanas'' (vehicles) and in standing posture. In Ranipur-Jharial temple the yogini images are in dancing posture. In Bhedaghat temple, yogini images are seated in ''Lalitasana''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/orissareview/oct2004/englishPdf/originoftantricism.pdf Chaudhury, Janmejay.

===Association with Matrikas===
Often the [[Matrikas]] are confused with the legendary yoginis, who may number sixty-four or eighty-one.&lt;ref&gt;Dehejia, Vidya, ''Yogini Cult and Temples''&lt;/ref&gt; In Sanskrit literature, the ''yoginis'' have been represented as the attendants or various manifestations of [[Durga]] engaged in fighting with the demons [[Shumbha]] and [[Nishumbha]], and the principal yoginis are identified with the Matrikas.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharyya, N. N., ''History of the Sakta Religion'', Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt. Ltd. (New Delhi, 1974, 2d ed. 1996), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Other yoginis are described as born from one or more Matrikas. The derivation of 64 yogini from eight Matrikas became a tradition. By mid-11th century, the connection between yoginis and Matrikas had become common lore. The [[mandala]] (circle) and [[chakra]] of yoginis were used alternatively. The 81 yoginis evolve from a group of nine Matrikas, instead eight. The Saptamatrika (Brahmi, Maheshvari, Kaumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrani (Aindri) and Chamundi) joined by [[Chandi|Candika]] and Mahalakshmi form the nine-Matrika cluster. Each Matrika is considered to be a yogini and is associate with eight other yoginis resulting in the troupe of 81 (nine times nine).&lt;ref&gt;Wangu p.114&lt;/ref&gt; Some traditions have only seven Matrikas, and thus fewer yoginis.

'''Yueh Hai Ching Temple''' (Traditional Chinese {{linktext|粵海|清|廟}}, Simplified Chinese {{linktext|粤海|清|庙}})&lt;!--Chinese in infobox--&gt;&lt;ref name=yhct/&gt;, also known as the '''Wak Hai Cheng Bio''' from its [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] pronunciation, is a Chinese temple in [[Singapore]] located in [[Raffles Place]] in [[Singapore]]'s [[Downtown Core|central business district]]. The temple, whose name literally means "Temple of the Calm [[South China Sea|Cantonese Sea]]",&lt;ref name=yhct&gt;{{citation |last=Thulaja |first=Naidu Ratnala |contribution=Yeh Hai Ching Temple |contribution-url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_327_2005-01-18.html |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/ |title=Singapore Infopedia |publisher=National Library Board |location=Singapore |date=2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first stop for Chinese immigrants to Singapore in the early 19th century.

==History==
The early history of Yueh Hai Ching temple is obscured. Multiple narratives provide conflicting accounts on the date the temple was first constructed. Some traced the history of the temple to as far back as to 1738.&lt;ref&gt;潘醒农，潮侨溯源集}&lt;/ref&gt; The general consensus is that the temple was first put up in 1820 &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Yueh Hai Ching Temple Preservation Guide}&lt;/ref&gt; as a simple wood and attap temple. In 1826, pioneer of Man Say Soon Company, Lim Poon erected a shrine on the same site on Phillip Street with a 999-year lease. It was managed by a board of trustees consisting of 14 members. The shrine was constructed so that sailors sailing between Singapore and China during the 19th century could offer their prayers and gratitude for their safe journey. This is reflected in the temple’s name, which translates as “Temple of the Calm Sea Built by the Guadong People”. Phillip Street was once near the sea, so that sailors could head to the temple immediately after docking. Due to land reclamation, the temple was effectively distanced from the shore.

When Ngee Ann Association was formed in 1845, it took over the management from Many Say Soon Company. Between 1852 and 1855, the present temple was constructed. In 1895, Ngee Ann Association submitted a building plan which called for substantial rebuilding of the temple. By the late 19th century, was the second largest and most influential of the Chinese dialect groups after Fujian.&lt;ref&gt;In granite and chunam:the national monuments of Singapore}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides being a place of worship, Yueh Hai Ching Temple also acted as a community centre and a meeting place. According to historian Pan Xing Nong, on 26 June 1994, the president of Ngee Ann Association then called for prayers at the temple for the impending World War I. As such, the temple played an important role in the everyday life of the Teochew community. It was where people socialized and exchanged news. It served as a place of congregation for immigrants from the same province to provide mutual support for each other.

Further restoration was carried out between 1995 and 1997 (URA, 1997). The latest round of restoration was officially carried out from 2011 to 2014. However, study of the temple structure for restoration purposes commenced a few years before 2011 (Personal interview with Dr. Yeo Kang Shua). This restoration is highly acclaimed. It is given an Award of Merit for 2014 UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards for Culture Heritage Conservation, 2014 Urban Redevelopment Authority’s Architectural Heritage Awards and 2013 National Architecture Institute of China’s Vernacular Architecture Award &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://asd.sutd.edu.sg/projects/projects-faculty/yueh-hai-ching-temple-wak-hai-cheng-bio/ | title=Yueh Hai Ching Temple (Wak Hai Cheng Bio) | publisher=SUTD | accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural features==
Covering a total floor area of 1440 square metres, the Yueh Hai Ching Temple was divided into two temples, each with its own entrance. The right temple is dedicated to Xuan Tian Shang Di, otherwise known as Duo Lau Yah. The left temple is dedicated to Tian Hou Sheng Mu, otherwise known as Ma Zu. The Xuan Tian Shang Di is a god worshipped by the Taoist. It is very much respected and worshipped by the secret societies in 19th Century. Mazu is worshipped as she guides ships to safety in times pf peril.

The Yueh Hai Ching Temple is an expression of a Taoist temple of Chinese architecture.

===Orientation===
An important feature of classical Chinese architecture is its attention to the concept of orientation, which is developed into a special branch of art called Feng Shui. Buildings invariably face south or a little to the east. Yueh Hai Ching Temple is orientated to the southeast (Figure 6), which allows it to take advantage of the southeasterly winds and sunshine to provide the people living in the halls and courtyards with a pleasant micro-climate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Organisation of space===
====Symmetrical layout====
One of the characteristics of classical Chinese architecture is the symmetrical structuring of the plan and elevation. Yue Hai Ching Temple has asymmetrical layout.

====Enclosed courtyard====
Courtyards and gardens as visual components of Chinese architecture. Upon passing through the front entrance gate, the large forecourt gives visitors a paronamic view of the entire temple. The courtyard of Yueh Hai Ching Temple are enclosed by the walls and buildings around it, takes on a special introverted quality. The seclusion of the courtyard, separated from the outside world, forms a world by itself. The stone-paved courtyard provides abundant supplies of air and light for interior space.

===Elaborated roofscape===
The roof of the temple of Xuan Tian Shang Di has ridge ornaments over the nave in the form of two dragons flanking a blazing pearl, which is lifted on a metal rod. To the ancient Chinese, the dragon is the emblem of guardianship and vigilance and the symbol of strength, authority and justice. The roof of the temple of Mazu has a ridge design composed of dragons guarding the city against evil influences and were emblematic of geomantic power to revert evil forces into beneficial energy.

Both roofs have the most unusual ornaments of complicated layouts of one- and two-storey mini-structures and human figurines. They are laid in such a way as to depict clusters of buildings within a Chinese town. In this temple, not only is the ridge extremely crowded with dragons and miniature models of dwellings, the copings, gable ends and hips are also adorned with all kinds of structures of pagodas, sheds, dwellings and niches. Human figurines area displayed everywhere, depicting scenes from Chinese operas which illustrate the courageous and meritorious deeds of the gods and ancient heroes of Chinese legend.

These figures were created using a traditional technique known as cut-and paste porcelain shard work (嵌瓷 or [[剪瓷雕]]). Wires and rods are used to form armatures around which a cement-like lime base is formed of either limestone powder or seashell powder. The limp is mixed with sand and helpwool to form the substance onto which porcelain shards are set, providing a glazed sheen which gives a smooth and vibrant aesthetics.

===Exposure of structural element===
The support system of the massive roof timbering is visible in Yueh Hai Ching Temple. The exposed wooden structural truss are of highly decorated elements. The carvings on the beams are engraved in many different layers, with the most dramatic being the pierced-relief carvings. This style of carving is more three-dimensional. Not only the wood carvings are exceptionally detailed, they are also decorated in gold foil and paint.

===Colour===
Yellow is the symbol of earth, the property of the Emperor. As such, it is often regarded as a symbol of grandeur, power and state. In the temple, gold (instead of yellow) is used on roof trusses, brackets, eaveboards, Door Gods and he Chinese characteristics of plaques.

Blue, the colour of sky, is also an Imperial colour which signifies the colour of the east. In the temple, blue is used for decorative painted patterns on beams and background colours of plaques.

Red is associated with prosperity and good fortune. It is also associated with the ‘yang’ principle of the sun. happiness and the south. In the temple, red is used on roof purlins, trusses and doors.

Green, which signifies the officials of lower rank, is associated with the water element. In the temple, green is used on roof rafters, roof tiles of the boundary walls and background colour of the plaques.

==Cultural artifacts==
Yueh Hai Ching Temple contains 19 temple plaques, 11 sets of couplets, 2 stone inscriptions, 1 bronze inscriptions, 2 bronze bells, 5 inscribed beams, 2 ceremonial placards and 1 “cloud coard” wooden chime.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Epigraphy in Singapore 1819–1911}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four censers and one plaque are in the collection of Ngee Ann Kongsi. One of the stone censor may date to 1819.

The temple is presented with an imperialplague from Emperor Guangxu in 1907. Yueh Hai Ching Temple is one of the only two temples being given this honour. The signboard which reads “Auspicious Clouds above the Sea at Dawn”, is now hung at the Mazu temple.

{{Kings of Judah}}

'''Zedekiah''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|z|ɛ|d|ᵻ|ˈ|k|aɪ|ə}}), also written '''Tzidkiyahu''',{{efn|{{Hebrew Name|צִדְקִיָּהוּ|Ṣidəqíyahū|Ṣiḏəqiyā́hû|"My righteousness is [[Yahweh]]"}}; [[Koine Greek|Greek]]: Σεδεκίας, ''Sedekías''; {{lang-la|Sedecias}}}} originally called '''Mattanyahu''' or '''Mattaniah''', was a biblical character, the last [[king of Judah]] before the destruction of the kingdom by [[Babylon]]. Zedekiah had been installed as king of Judah by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], king of Babylon, after a [[Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC)|siege of Jerusalem]] in 597 BC, to succeed his nephew, [[Jeconiah]], who was overthrown as king after a reign of only three months and ten days.

[[William F. Albright]] dates the start of Zedekiah's reign to 598 BC, while [[E. R. Thiele]] gives the start in 597 BC.&lt;ref name=Thiele&gt;Edwin Thiele, ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'', (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951;  2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). {{ISBN|0-8254-3825-X}}, 9780825438257, 217.&lt;/ref&gt; On that reckoning, Zedekiah was born in c. 617 BC or 618 BC, being twenty-one on becoming king. Zedekiah's reign ended with the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|siege and fall of Jerusalem]] to Nebuchadnezzar II, which has been dated to 587 or 586 BC.&lt;ref name="Young2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robb Andrew Young|title=Hezekiah in History and Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=autR6tfCb7wC&amp;pg=PA18|date=3 May 2012 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-21608-1|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prophet [[Jeremiah]] was his counselor, yet he did not heed the prophet and his epitaph is "he did evil in the sight of the Lord". ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|24:19–20|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|52:2–3|NIV}})

==Background==
When Babylon rose against Assyria it caused upheavals that led to the destruction of Judah. Egypt, concerned about the new threat, moved northward to support Assyria. It set on the march in 608, moving via Judah. King Josiah attempted to block the Egyptian forces, and fell mortally wounded in battle at [[Battle of Megiddo (609 BC)|Megiddo]]. Josiah's younger son [[Jehoahaz of Judah|Jehoahaz]] was chosen to succeed his father to the throne. Three months later the Egyptian pharaoh [[Necho II|Necho]], returning from the north, deposed Jehoahaz in favor of his older brother, [[Jehoiakim]]. Jehoahaz was taken back to Egypt as a captive.&lt;ref name=bakon&gt;Bakon, Shimon. [http://jbq.jewishbible.org/assets/Uploads/362/362_zedekiah.pdf  "Zedekiah: Last King of Judah"], ''Jewish Bible Quarterly'', Vol. 36, No. 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Egyptians were defeated by the Babylonians at the [[Battle of Carchemish]] in 605 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II then besieged Jerusalem. Jehoiakim changed allegiances to avoid the destruction of Jerusalem. He paid tribute from the treasury, some temple artifacts, and some of the royal family and nobility as hostages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to the Old Testament Prophetic Books|author=[[C. Hassell Bullock]]|page=340|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KabKHP4qZMIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA340#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent failure of the Babylonian invasion into Egypt undermined Babylonian control of the area, and after three years, Jehoiakim switched allegiance back to the Egyptians and ceased paying the tribute to Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.drshirley.org/hist/hist05.html | title=The Divided Monarchy c. 931–586 BC | first=Shirley J. |last=Rollinson | date=June 28, 2017 |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 599 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II invaded Judah and again laid siege to Jerusalem. In 598 BC, Jehoiakim died during the siege and was succeeded by his son Jeconiah (also known as Jehoiachin). Jerusalem fell within three months. Jeconiah was deposed by Nebuchadnezzar, who installed Zedekiah, Jeconiah's uncle, in his place.&lt;ref&gt;2 Chronicles 36:9-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford History of the Biblical World'', ed. by Michael D Coogan. Published by Oxford University Press, 1999. pg 350&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and reign==
[[File:Germany Zwiefalten Münster Nebuchadnezzer and Zedekiah.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] faces off against Zedekiah, who holds a plan of [[Jerusalem]], in this [[Baroque sculpture|Baroque]]-era depiction in [[Zwiefalten Abbey]] in [[Germany]]]]

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], Zedekiah was made king of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar II in 597 BC at the age of twenty-one. This is in agreement with a Babylonian chronicle, which states, "The seventh year: In the month Kislev the king of Akkad mustered his army and marched to Hattu. He encamped against the city of Judah and on the second day of the month Adar he captured the city (and) seized (its) king. A king of his own choice he appointed in the city (and) taking the vast tribute he brought it into Babylon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Readings from the Ancient Near East: Primary Sources for Old Testament Study|publisher=Baker Academic |isbn=978-0801022920 |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kingdom was at that time tributary to Nebuchadnezzar II. Despite the strong remonstrances of Jeremiah, Baruch ben Neriah and his other family and advisors, as well as the example of [[Jehoiakim]], he revolted against [[Babylon]], and entered into an alliance with [[Pharaoh]] [[Apries|Hophra]] of [[Egypt]]. Nebuchadnezzar responded by invading Judah ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:1|HE}}). Nebuchadnezzar began a siege of [[Jerusalem]] in December 589 BC. During this siege, which lasted about thirty months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Doug and Amy-Jill Levine|title=The Meaning of the Bible|year=2011|publisher=HarperOne|location=New York City |isbn=9780062067739 |pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; "every worst woe befell the city, which drank the cup of God's fury to the dregs" ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:3|HE}}; {{bibleverse||Lamentations|4:4|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Lamentations|5|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Lamentations|9|HE}}).

At the end of Zedekiah's eleven-year reign, Nebuchadnezzar succeeded in capturing Jerusalem. Zedekiah and his followers attempted to escape, making their way out of the city, but were captured on the plains of [[Jericho]], and were taken to [[Riblah]].

There, after seeing his sons put to death, his own [[eye-gouging|eyes were put out]], and, being loaded with chains, he was carried captive to [[Babylon]] ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:1–7|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|36:12|HE}}; {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|32:4–5|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|34:2–3|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|39:1–7|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|52:4–11|HE}}; {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|12:13|HE}}), where he remained a prisoner until he died.

After the fall of Jerusalem, [[Nebuzaradan]] was sent to destroy it. The city was plundered and razed to the ground. [[Solomon's Temple]] was destroyed. Only a small number of vinedressers and husbandmen were permitted to remain in the land ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|52:16|HE}}).

==Aftermath==
[[Gedaliah]], with a [[Babylonia|Chaldean]] guard stationed at [[Mizpah in Benjamin|Mizpah]], was made governor to rule over the remnant of Judah, the [[Yehud (Babylonian province)|Yehud Province]] ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:22-24|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|40:6–8|HE}}). On hearing this news, all the Jews that were in [[Moab]], [[Ammon]], [[Edom]], and in other countries returned to Judah ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|40:11–12|HE}}). However, before long Gedaliah was assassinated, and the population that was left in the land and those that had returned fled to Egypt for safety ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:26|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|43:5–7|HE}}) In Egypt, they settled in [[Migdol]], [[Tahpanhes]], [[Noph]], and [[Pathros]]. ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|44:1|HE}}).

==Chronological notes==
[[File:102.Zedekiah's Sons Are Slaughtered before His Eyes.jpg|thumb|Zedekiah's sons are slaughtered before his eyes, by [[Gustave Doré]]]]
The [[Babylonian Chronicles]] give 2 Adar (16 March), 597 BC, as the date that Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem, thus putting an end to the reign of [[Jeconiah|Jehoaichin]].&lt;ref&gt;D. J. Wiseman, ''Chronicles of Chaldean Kings in the British Museum'' (London: Trustees of the British Museum, 1956) 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Zedekiah's installation as king by Nebuchadnezzar can therefore be firmly dated to the early spring of 597 BC. Historically there has been considerable controversy over the date when Jerusalem was captured the second time and Zedekiah's reign came to an end. There is no dispute about the month: it was the summer month of Tammuz (Jeremiah 52:6). The problem has been to determine the year. It was noted above that Albright preferred 587 BC and Thiele advocated 586 BC, and this division among scholars has persisted until the present time. If Zedekiah's years are by accession counting, whereby the year he came to the throne was considered his "zero" year and his first full year in office, 597/596, was counted as year one, Zedekiah's eleventh year, the year the city fell, would be 587/586. Since Judean regnal years were measured from Tishri in the fall, this would place the end of his reign and the capture of the city in the summer of 586 BC. Accession counting was the rule for most, but not all, of the kings of Judah, whereas "non-accession" counting was the rule for most, but not all, of the kings of Israel.&lt;ref name=Thiele /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie McFall, "A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles," ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' 148 (1991) 45.[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf&amp;date=2010-07-19+09:25:20]&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of the [[Babylonian Chronicles]] in 1956, however, gave evidence that the years of Zedekiah were measured in a non-accession sense. This reckoning makes year 598/597 BC, the year Zedekiah was installed by Nebuchadnezzar according to Judah's Tishri-based calendar, to be year "one," so that the fall of Jerusalem in his eleventh year would have been in year 588/587 BC, i.e. in the summer of 587 BC. The Babylonian Chronicles allow the fairly precise dating of the capture of [[Jeconiah|Jehoiachin]] and the start of Zedekiah's reign, and they also give the accession year of Nebuchadnezzar's successor [[Amel-Marduk]] (Evil Merodach) as 562/561 BC, which was the 37th year of Jehoiachin's captivity according to 2 Kings 25:27. These Babylonian records related to Jehoiachin's reign are consistent with the fall of the city in 587 but not in 586, as explained in the [[Jeconiah|Jehoiachin/Jeconiah]] article, thus vindicating Albright's date. Nevertheless, scholars who assume that Zedekiah's reign should be calculated by accession reckoning will continue to adhere to the 586 date, and so the infobox contains this as an alternative.

==Book of Mormon==
According to the [[Book of Mormon]], Zedekiah's son [[Mulek]] escaped death and traveled across the ocean to the [[Americas]], where he founded a nation, the [[Mulekites]], which later merged with another Israelite splinter group, the [[Nephite]]s, to form one nation who retained the name Nephites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/hel/6/10#10|title=Helaman 6|website=scriptures.lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/hel/8/21#21|title=Helaman 8|website=scriptures.lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genealogical note==
Zedekiah was the third son of [[Josiah]], and his mother was [[Hamutal]] the daughter of Jeremiah of [[Libnah]], thus he was the brother of [[Jehoahaz of Judah|Jehoahaz]] ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|23:31|NIV}}, {{bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|24:17-18|NIV}}, {{bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|23:31|NIV}}, {{bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|24:17-18|NIV}}).

His original name was '''Mattanyahu''' ({{lang-he|מַתַּנְיָהוּ}}, ''Mattanyāhû'', "Gift of [[Tetragrammaton|God]]"; {{lang-el|Μαθθανιας}}; {{lang-la|Matthanias}}; traditional English: '''Mattaniah'''), but when Nebuchadnezzar II placed him on the throne as the successor to [[Jehoiachin]], he changed his name to Zedekiah ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|24:17|NIV}}).
