== Early life ==
Abel Bosum was born the oldest of 11 children of his mother Lucy Busom.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/successful-cree-negotiator-finds-the-french-canadian-father-he-never-knew-1.2781824|title=Abel Bosum finds the father he never knew|work=CBC News|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born on an island on Dore Lake in Northern Quebec. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His father, Cypien Caron, was a French-Canadian from Quebec City who had a relationship with Lucy Busom in her settlement near Chibougamau, Quebec.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; His mother Lucy was not allowed to marry his father because of the traditional values of their community and so Abel Bosum would not meet his biological father until he was 53 years old.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Abel Bosum's stepfather, Sam Neepoosh, would act as his father figure during his early years until Neepoosh passed away when Abel Bosum was 14 years old in 1969.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For 10 years, Abel Bosum attended the La Tuque Residential school in La Tuque, Quebec, run by the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, 150 km north of Trois-Rivières.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.anglican.ca/tr/histories/la-tuque-quebec/|title=La Tuque School — Quebec - Anglican Church of Canada|work=Anglican Church of Canada|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once Abel Bosum left the school, he worked in underground mines in the [[Chibougamau]] area and also took fishing jobs in order to support his family. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Career ==

=== Head of economic-development department of the Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee) ===
Abel Bosum studied business administration and began to work for the Grand Council of the Crees (GCC) at age 22 where he was named the head of its economic-development department. He held this position for 6 years. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Abel Bosum, while he worked to help other Cree communities with the GCC, he came to the realisation that his own people were in need of support to help ameliorate their living conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Chief of the Oujé-Bougoumou ===
In 1984, at age 28, Abel Bosum became the chief of the [[Oujé-Bougoumou, Quebec|Oujé-Bougoumou]], a position he would hold for 14 years. [[Oujé-Bougoumou, Quebec|Oujé-Bougoumou]] which translates to "the place where the people gather",&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; is the Cree nation in which Abel Bosum was born. When Abel Bosum became its chief it marked the beginning of a new era for the people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Over the preceding half century, they had been struggling to survive as a group and were considered "among the most destitute people of the developed world".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Finkel, A. (2006). ''Social Policy and Practice in Canada : A History''. Waterloo, Ont: WLU Press. &lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1926 and 1970, they had been forced to move their settlements seven times because of mineral discoveries that had been made in the region of [[James Bay]], their traditional homeland.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Because of the amount of relocation that the nation had undergone, by the 1970s many of its members were living in tarpaper and plywood shacks along logging roads, without running water or heat, and were split into six family groups. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Others had moved to other Northern Quebec First Nations communities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Abel Bosum had moved to [[Val-d'Or|Val D'Or]], Quebec.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During the period before he became chief and while he worked for the Grand Council of the Quebec Crees, Abel Bosum served as a link among members of the community and its elders.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; When meeting and discussing with the Oujé-Bougoumou elders about the nation's situation, they and Abel Bosum decided that they wished to take action.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; With Abel Bosum as their leader, they decided to negotiate with the federal and provincial governments to try to rectify the situation of the nation and return it to a community that could flourish. It was under this premise that Abel Bosum became chief of the Oujé-Bougoumou with the goal of negotiating with the Province of Quebec to provide his people with more suitable living conditions and to defend and promote the Oujé-Bougoumou's aboriginal rights in Quebec and Canada.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Negotiating on behalf of the Oujé-Bougoumou ===
There were several challenges that Abel Bosum faced in his negotiations on behalf of the Oujé-Bougoumou nation. One was their omission from the [[James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement]] made in 1975 that provided compensation to Cree people in the [[James Bay]] region.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These stipends from the [[Government of Quebec|Quebec provincial government]] would aid in the development of Cree nations. However due to the mistake of an employee of the Canadian Federal Department of Indian Affairs in 1936, who had falsely combined the [[Oujé-Bougoumou, Quebec|Oujé-Bougoumou]] nation with the [[Mistissini (Cree village municipality)|Mistassini Cree]] nation, one located 90 kilometres away, the Oujé-Bougoumou had no recognised land rights in their traditional territory.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, they were excluded from the benefits of the James Bay pact that other Cree nations were able to have. This issue is one that Abel Bosum spent significant time bringing awareness to.  

Abel Bosum's negotiation strategy was based on gaining recognition for the [[Oujé-Bougoumou, Quebec|Oujé-Bougoumou]] who had not been able to sufficiently make themselves a priority to provincial and national government so as to effect change for their status.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; By having an anthropological study done of his people, Abel Bosum was able to give them a clear and distinct identity with a historical basis. This would legitimise the group and give them a stronger basis for their claim as a people.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Abel Bosum then worked to develop a proposal that would allocate land to his people which he submitted to both the [[Government of Canada|federal government of Canada]] and the provincial government of Quebec. Although at this time the nation itself had no financial resources left, they and Abel Bosum were supported by the Grand Council of the Crees to continue their struggle.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

During the negotiations he was leading on behalf of his people, Abel Bosum held many meetings among members of the Oujé-Bougoumou. The meetings had the goal of bringing together the interests of the community members surrounding a common goal and served to help bridge generational differences that existed among its members.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; By uniting the Oujé-Bougoumou around a common vision for their future, allowing elders to pass on their knowledge of traditional culture to the younger generations, and discussing the way things had been for the nation before contact with settlers in Northern Quebec due to mining, Abel mobilised the members of the younger generation of the Cree nation who began to pressure the government to act on the issues facing their community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Furthermore, because of the spread-out locations of the members of Oujé-Bougoumou, Abel Bosum strove to bring together his people even before they obtained their own territory. To do so he established an Oujé-Bougoumou office that organised them into a political action group.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

==== Political obstacles ====
When attempting to obtain recognition from the federal and provincial governments, there were additional hurdles that Abel Bosum encountered. Because the Canadian federal government insisted that the Oujé-Bougoumou have a land base in order to be recognised, and the Quebec government, newly under [[Parti Québécois|Parti Quebecois]] leadership in 1976, "strongly opposed the establishment of any new federal lands in Quebec,"&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Abel Bosum found his nation at an impasse with the provincial government. However, after bringing a letter to [[René Lévesque|René Levesque]], premier of Quebec, from the federal government stating that the Oujé-Bougoumou would be recognised upon obtaining a land base, and with much negotiation effort on the part of Abel Bosum and the Oujé-Bougoumou Crees, the premier conceded one square mile of territory for an Oujé-Bougoumou village.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; With this commitment secured, Abel Bosum returned to the federal government which agreed to begin negotiations to recognise the Oujé-Bougoumou officially.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

Abel Bosum's goal was for the Oujé-Bougoumou to become full participants in the treaty that benefited the Cree peoples of Northern Quebec, the James Bay Northern Quebec Agreement (JBNQA).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; But, the Quebec government told the Oujé-Bougoumou that they could only settle in an area not already part of a mining claim or part of a forestry concession in the region. This condition limited the options of the Oujé-Bougoumou such that they were not able to find a suitable territory to settle in because they lacked any commercial opportunities for the Oujé-Bougoumou people.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In the early 1980s,the Oujé-Bougoumou traditional territory was occupied by two municipal areas, six mining sites, and the operations of six forestry companies.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|title=The forgotten Crees lauded on world stage (Ouje-Bougoumou)|last=|first=|date=March 31, 1996|work=Catholic New Times|archive-date=June 9, 2010|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, after a change in the leadership of the Quebec provincial government to the Quebec liberal party, Abel Bosum tried to negotiate with the new premier, [[Robert Bourassa]]. These negotiations did not last long before an impasse was reached and so Abel Bosum decided to take another approach.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Breaking through ====
Abel Bosum then decided to get into contact with someone who had been involved with the original JBNQA negotiations. Member of Provincial Parliament [[John Ciaccia]], had negotiated on behalf of Quebec and was able to inform Abel Bosum of what obstacles needed to be overcome in order to solve the challenge he had been facing to obtain recognised territory for his people.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Abel Bosum was able to reach a verbal agreement with this senior provincial minister to re-negotiate Oujé-Bougoumou land as soon as the Quebec Liberal party came to power.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

In his dealings with the Quebec provincial government, Abel Bosum first wished to have his people granted a larger area in which to live by the province than one square mile. He was able to get the Liberal Quebec government to agree to grant his people a territory similar in size to that of other Cree nations in Northern Quebec. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Although at this time, Quebec refused to re-open the JBNQA talks, there were a certain number of Oujé-Bougoumou registered under the [[Mistissini, Quebec|Mistissini]] nation, which was a part of the agreement. Abel's strategy consisted of proposing that Mistissini land be transferred to the Oujé-Bougoumou based on the number of Oujé-Bougoumou among the Mistissini so that the Oujé-Bougoumou could effectively be under the treaty. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;Abel Bosum then had John Ciaccia amend the JBNQA to effect this change.

Another way that Abel Bosum was able to put pressure on the government was by having the Grand Council of the Crees proclaim that they would not be a signatory party to any agreement unless the Oujé-Bougoumou be also included. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;Abel Bosum says that he subsequently had "several meetings with the prime minister" of Canada that were able to secure more commitments from the federal government. In 1986, this brought him to the point where he could, with the consultation of his people, select a site where their new village would be developed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Linking the Oujé-Bougoumou's situation to human rights activism ===
During the time he was negotiating with the Provincial and Federal governments to improve the situation of his people, Abel Bosum concurrently had to deal with the social issues that his community faced living in makeshift settlements along remote highways. Abel Bosum referred to their condition as an "urgent" one and worked to instill temporary measures to safeguard the health and well-being of the Oujé-Bougoumou while a new area of settlement was being negotiated.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; For example, Abel Bosum was able to "get some funding" to install trailers with washrooms and running water in the six main encampments at which his people resided.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

In order to apply pressure on the government, Abel Bosum also involved the media and his own people to document the conditions that the Oujé-Bougoumou were living in and expose their situation to the public. Through the media coverage they received, the Oujé-Bougoumou were also able "to attend various conferences dealing with human rights and housing where they could bring awareness surrounding their struggles."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; By informing the public of his people's situation, and emphasizing the human rights violations they were encountering within a first world country, Abel Bosum successfully put more pressure on the provincial and federal  governments to change the situation of the Oujé-Bougoumou and negotiations re-started with more commitment on their part.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

=== Civil disobedience ===
The federal government began to make preliminary offers to Abel Bosum and the Oujé-Bougoumou to finance their new settlement however these offers were lower than the nation thought it needed to adequately address the needs of the community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The federal government decided to provide a maximum of $14 million CAD to the Oujé-Bougoumou to begin their new village, but after much internal discussion and consultation with the elders, and despite the risk that they might not get another offer as other [[First Nations|first nations]] had not gotten after refusing a government offer, Abel Bosum refused the offer on behalf of the Oujé-Bougoumou.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

After a year of silence from the government on the issue, the Oujé-Bougoumou were looking to apply pressure by whatever means they could on the government to get a larger financial commitment from it for the construction of their village.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; First, Abel Bosum encouraged his people to occupy the site that they had chosen for their home without a final agreement granting them the territory. Energy Resources Quebec opposed this strategy and demanded that they stop building on the land.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, the Cree disobeyed and made camps as they left their former makeshift ones by the sides of the roads.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Second, with more young Cree getting involved, discussions began surrounding blockades and other acts of civil disobedience. For maximum impact, Abel Bosum and the Oujé-Bougoumou decided to block a nearby forestry road that also served as an access road to mining sites and to a popular recreational fishing location, the Assinica river.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This strategy affected the commerce in the area significantly as it obstructed activities of three resource sectors and "created a lot of tension for the region."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;         

=== A final agreement ===                                    

With the pressure put on the government based on the disruptive civil disobedience practiced by the Oujé-Bougoumou in Northern Quebec, real strides were made to reach a final agreement for the village in which this nation could permanently reside. Abel Bosum was contacted by the Liberal provincial minister of natural resources for Quebec, Raymond Savoie who wished to meet with him to develop a comprehensive agreement that would put an end to the grievances of the Oujé-Bougoumou.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; At the meeting was a delegation of 15 members from Quebec as well as one negotiator from the Canadian government who had come to speak with Abel Bosum. In discussions that went late into the night and early into the morning, the governments agreed in principle to support the construction of the Oujé-Bougoumou village and "to provide a social and economic development fund" that would serve to keep the Oujé-Bougoumou people employed and allow them to develop their own economic opportunities in the future.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, the federal government later backed out of the agreement because it did not agree with the principle of a social and economic development fund. Because the province of Quebec felt more pressure from the civil disobedience of the Oujé-Bougoumou to make a deal with them, Abel Bosum continued to negotiate solely with the province.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Finally he was able to obtain a deal granting the Oujé-Bougoumou financial support for the infrastructure of their village and a $20 million contribution towards social and economic development for the nation as well as 167 square kilometers of land.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; He then sought to use this agreement to put leverage on the federal government to gain their contribution for the village's success. Making use as he had earlier of information politics, this time in the form of a media campaign, so that dialogue might continue with the federal government, Abel Bosum pressured them to put a new negotiator in place to deal with the Oujé-Bougoumou and other Cree issues.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Oujé-Bougoumou's struggle had become a symbolic one for aboriginal rights issues in Canada. 

In 1992, Abel Bosum and Oujé-Bougoumou signed a deal that brought them $43.6 million from the federal government towards the construction of their village. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Though this deal, according to Abel Bosum, "'did not include everything we wanted,"&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; it was considered by him to be a good enough one to justify signing especially given the pressing needs of the members of the Oujé-Bougoumou who did not have homes.

=== The Oujé-Bougoumou village ===
The village that Abel Bosum is credited with founding is located Lake Opemisca, Quebec.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Built in consultation with the Oujé-Bougoumou people, it is home to 750 Cree and has been recognised by the United Nations as one of 50 model communities worldwide.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Peritz, I. (2005, Nov 26). In cree village, there's no place like home. ''The Globe and Mail'' Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ubishops.ca:2048/docview/383610220?accountid=8636&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; It gained this recognition because it was able to fulfill needs of the community while also being an environmentally sustainable and technologically advanced settlement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Although it is located in a remote area of Northern Quebec, its inhabitants have a low level of unemployment and new houses are continuing to be built to meet the demand of young Cree people who wish to gain ownership of their own home.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The village is considered to be a unique one in Canada as it provides excellent living conditions in modern houses to Indigenous peoples. The design of the village is one that seeks to reflect the "values and culture of the Oujé-Bougoumou people."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

== Later career ==

=== Work in his village as chief ===

After securing the deal to finance his village with the Quebec and Canadian governments, Abel Bosum as chief of the Oujé-Bougoumou worked to facilitate the social and economic development for his people in their new home. This involved securing access to essential natural resources so that his community could be financially self-sustaining as well as tackling social issues that his people had developed mainly due to the instability of their dwellings.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; For example at a certain point, "over 90 per cent of Oujé-Bougoumou adults had alcohol problems, and that has fallen below 50 per cent."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Abel Bosum's main goal for his village however was for it to prove that aboriginal groups in Canada can make good use of the resources provided to them by the government and that these communities can exist in an politically and economically independent state.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Negotiating for all Crees: Quebec negotiator for the Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee) ===

Based on his work in advocating for his own nation's rights with the government of Quebec,  in 1998, Abel Bosum was chosen to negotiate on behalf of all the Crees of Quebec as the GCC Quebec negotiator.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the year 2000, he was able "to break a two-year-long impasse between the Crees and Quebec."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the summer of 2000, he began negotiating with Quebec on the 1975 James Bay agreement, eventually reaching a new agreement for governing the James Bay region with the Quebec government in 2012.

In 2002, Abel Bosum led the negotiations of the [[Agreement Respecting a New Relationship Between the Cree Nation and the Government of Quebec|Agreement Respecting a New Relationships Between the Cree Nation and the Government of Quebec]] (La Paix des Braves) signed on February 7th, 2002, between the Government of Quebec and the Grand Council of the Crees (GCC). This agreement serves to better integrate the Crees into the economic activities that go on in their region, shares the revenues from them with Quebec Crees, and also allows them to make decisions pertaining to their own development with the funds they receive from the provincial government.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gcc.ca/issues/paixdesbraves.php|title=The Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee) &gt; Critical Issues &gt;|website=www.gcc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abel Bosum has worked to negotiate on behalf of the Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay in order to obtain health and social services for Cree people. He has also negotiated for the Cree School Board and represented the GCC in discussions with neighbouring aboriginal nations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Furthermore, he has negotiated on behalf of the GCC and several individual Cree communities "with five mining companies to ensure financial benefits, employment and environmental protection measures" be provided to Cree people in the areas where mining activities are conducted.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Finally, in 2012, he negotiated the James Bay Governance Agreement that would change the way the region is administered by giving "Cree jurisdiction over the traditional Cree territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/quebecam/2012/07/25/a-new-model-for-governing/|title=Historic agreement with the James Bay Cree|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cbc.ca|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The agreement also developed new Cree governance structures.

=== Charitable work ===

Abel Bosum was chosen as president of the Aanischaaukamikw Foundation and Cree Cultural Institute on April 2nd, 2015.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Abel Bosum has helped to raise $25.6 million to develop the institute. The foundation is a registered charitable organisation, is not-for-profit, and obtained the funding it required to build the cultural institute from "Cree and non-Cree governments, corporate partners, private foundations and individuals."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Grand Chief of the Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee) ===

Abel Bosum was elected for a four-year term as Grand Chief of the Council of the Crees of Northern Quebec on July 24th, 2017 with 55.9% of the vote share. He defeated the outgoing Deputy Grand Chief Rodney Mark. He succeeded Grand Chief [[Matthew Coon Come]] who had previously served five-terms as Grand Chief over a 40-year period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

As Grand Chief he has overseen the adoption of Bill C-70 into law by the Canadian government. The bill provides the Eeyou Istchee with a higher degree of political self-determination as it allows the GCC to "create its own culturally relevant laws and have more say on a variety of local governance issues, including development."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://senate-gro.ca/new-laws/c-70-cree-naskapi/|title=More self-determination for two northern Quebec First Nations|work=Senate GRO|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill is an extension of the rights provided in the 1975 James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement. According to Abel Bosum, as expressed in his address to the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples, it as an important step to advancing towards full Cree self-governance.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gcc.ca/newsarticle.php?id=491|title=The Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee) &gt; Statement By Grand Chief Dr. Abel Bosum To The Standing Senate Committee On Aboriginal Peoples On Bill C-70, Cree Nation Of Eeyou Istchee Governance Agreement Act|website=gcc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition ==
In 1998, Abel Bosum received Canada's National Aboriginal Achievement Award in the category of Community Development for his work with the Oujé-Bougoumou Cree community.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In June of 2016, Abel Bosum received the degree of Doctor of Civil Law, Honoris Causa, from [[Bishop's University]] in Sherbrooke, Quebec.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; And, in 2018, he was appointed to the [[Order of Canada]], an honour recognising "outstanding achievement, dedication to the community and service to the nation."&lt;ref&gt;Governor General Updates on 125 New Appointments to the Order of Canada.

== Activism ==
Alexandra Billings is an [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] and [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] activist who argues for the equality of the LGBTQ community and urges others to use their voices to create change within the LGBTQ community.&lt;ref name="news.usc.edu"/&gt; In 2016, Billings was awarded the [[Human Rights Campaign]] Visibility Award, which recognizes outstanding members of the LGBTQ community who live openly and freely in the public eye. After receiving the award, Billings thanked the audience, but also said, “I look around and I see you all and I cannot tell you how grateful I am that you’re here, and I have to say something to you I think you look great, you look swell and it’s wonderful that you’re here eating the chicken it’s delightful but I must tell you that we have to do something more than sit and speak and talk to our neighbors and eat great food and put on fancy clothes.” She challenges the audience to use their voices to speak loudly in order to create change and ultimately, equality for the LGBTQ community. In 2017, [[Transparent (TV series)|Transparent]], the hit TV show Billings stars in, won the [[GLAAD]] Media Award for Outstanding Comedy Series. When accepting the award on behalf of the cast, Billings urges the audience to talk to people who disagree with their beliefs in order to spark conversation and create change instead of staying complacent. Specifically, she calls out the older LGBTQ generation and asks them to guide the younger LGBTQ generation because they will be the ones continuing the fight for equality in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=GLAAD|title=Alexandra Billings Calls for Unity l 28th Annual GLAAD Media Awards|date=2017-04-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1f5hrH-CdU|accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; When delivering the commencement speech to the graduating class of the University of California State, Long Beach in 2015, Billings once again emphasized the importance of voice when she told the students that it is their job is to speak loud, big, and wide in order to spread their voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=csulbwebteam|title=Alexandra Billings CSULB College of the Arts Commencement Speech 2015|date=2015-06-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfOsS1CA0HY|accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

Billings lives in [[Hollywood]], [[California]] with her wife Chrisanne, whom she initially met at age sixteen in drama class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=csulbwebteam|title=Alexandra Billings CSULB College of the Arts Commencement Speech 2015|date=2015-06-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfOsS1CA0HY|accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were married in a commitment ceremony in Chicago on December 4, 1995.&lt;ref name=chicagopride /&gt;  Billings was chosen as the Grand Marshal for the Pride Parade in Chicago, Illinois on June 28, 2009.

Billings has been living with HIV since 1994, and has been an advocate for HIV health initiatives, as well as trans issues and trans rights. When talking about her fight to battle AIDS, she says that she believes the reason she has survived all these years is because of her wife who stood by her, loved her, and supported her through it all.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Campaign"/&gt; She has spoken about her status in a number of interviews, including a 2016 article with her hometown paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160216/entlife/160219215/ |title='Transparent' transgender actress bullied growing up in Schaumburg |publisher=Dailyherald.com |date=2016-02-16 |accessdate=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also spoke to POZ Magazine for a 2003 interview about life with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poz.com/article/Star-Billings-616-5876 |title=Star Billings |publisher=POZ |date=2003-05-01 |accessdate=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Assassination of George I of Greece, 1913.png|thumb|right|Assassination of [[George I of Greece]] by Alexandros Schinas in 1913 as depicted in a contemporary [[lithograph]]]]

'''Alexandros Schinas''' ({{lang-el|Αλέξανδρος Σχινάς}}) (c.1870 &amp;ndash; May 6, 1913), also known as '''Aleko Schinas''', (in the 1870's, most probably in [[Volos]] where he was the founder of an anarchist school &amp;ndash; May 6, 1913 in [[Thessaloniki]]),  was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[anarchism|anarchist]]{{r|anarchist}} notable for assassinating [[List of Kings of Greece|King]] [[George I of Greece]] in [[Thessaloniki]] in 1913 as an example of propaganda of the deed.{{sfn|Kemp|2018}}{{sfn|Bernhard Blumenau|2013|p=30}}

== Early life ==
Schinas was most probably born in Volos in the 1870's. Schinas studied medicine in univercity of Athens and during that time developed interest on anarchism. There he opened a famous anarchist school in Volos but was shut down by the government.{{sfn|Kemp|2018}}. After spending some time and working in [[New York City]] he returned to Greece in February 1913.{{sfn|Kemp|2018}}{{sfn|Henry E. Mattox|2015|p=22}}. By that time, he was alcoholic and leaning towards anarchism.{{sfn|Kemp|2018}}{{sfn|Tomai|2012|ps=: Tomai presents some primary sources describing Schinas as a weird person with socialist ideas ie that there would not be any more poor or rich people and no one would have to work more than 2 hours per day}}

== Assassination of King George I ==
On March 18, 1913, at around 5:15 PM,Schinas (who was around 40 at the time) shot King George I in the back from a distance of two paces while the king was walking in [[Thessaloniki]], near White Tower.{{sfn|Henry E. Mattox|2015|p=22}} Entering below the king's shoulder blade, the bullet pierced his heart. By the time the king arrived at the hospital, he was already dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tomai|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schinas was taken into custody immediately, initially refusing to explain the reason for the crime. Later, Schinas declared that he killed the king because the latter refused to give him the money he asked for.&lt;ref name="sorrow"&gt;''Sorrow Throughout Greece'', by Marconi Transatlantic Wireless Telegraph; ''The New York Times''; March 19, 1913; pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek government released statements claiming that Schinas was an alcoholic vagrant.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times (London)''; 20 March 1913; pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt;Schinas was tortured throughout the following night, being "forced to undergo examinations", but he refused to give the names of any accomplices.&lt;ref name="NYT320"&gt;''The New York Times''; March 20, 1913; pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt; On May 6, he died by allegedly jumping out of the window of the gendarmerie in Thessaloniki, but is unclear whether it was a suicide.{{sfn|Kemp|2018}} 

All istorians cites Schinas as educated anarchist.{{sfn|Bernhard Blumenau|2013|p=30}}

== Biography ==
Amar Nath Bhaduri, born on 12 November 1935 at [[Shyambazar]], in northern [[Kolkata]] in the Indian state of [[West Bengal]], did his schooling at the [[Scottish Church Collegiate School]] before continuing his college studies at [[Presidency College, Calcutta|Presidency College]] and the [[University College of Science, Technology &amp; Agriculture]] of [[Calcutta University]].&lt;ref name="Amar Nath Bhaduri - Obituary"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/sep102003/677.pdf | title=Amar Nath Bhaduri - Obituary | author=Samir Bhattacharya | journal=Current Science | date=10 September 2003 | volume=85 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving to the US, he secured the degree of Doctor of Science from [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]] in 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the Board of Regents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lzcXAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA218|year=1963|publisher=The University|pages=218–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after completing his post-doctoral studies at [[Harvard Medical School]], returned to India in 1966 to join the [[Jadavpur University]] as a member of faculty of the department of pharmacy. He served the institution till his move to the [[Indian Institute of Chemical Biology]] (IICB) in 1985 and superannuated as the director of the institute; in between, he had a short stint at [[Roche Institute of Molecular Biology]] during 1975–76.&lt;ref name="Deceased Fellow - A. N. Bhaduri" /&gt; Post his retirement, he continued his association with IICB as an emeritus scientist. He was also serving as an honorary professor at Calcutta and Jadvapur universities when he died on 5 June 2003 at Kolkata, succumbing to age-related illnesses, at the age of 67, survived by his wife, son and daughter.&lt;ref name="Amar Nath Bhaduri - Obituary" /&gt; The Indian National Science Academy has documented his life in their ''Biographical Memoirs''.&lt;ref name="Biographical Memoirs"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://insaindia.res.in/bm.php?letter=A | title=Biographical Memoirs | publisher=INSA | date=2016 | accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
At the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Bhaduri was associated with [[Paul Srere]] and worked on [[citrate]] metabolism and [[fatty acid biosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="Amar Nath Bhaduri - Obituary" /&gt; It was during his post-doctoral studies at Harvard Medical School, he elucidated the effect of [[uridine]] [[nucleotides]] on an [[epimerase]]. Later, he continued his researches at Jadavpur University and discovered methodologies for the purification of [[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] and for the regulation of [[UDP-glucose 4-epimerase]] from S. fragilis. His researches revealed that the enzyme was ''[[allosterically]] activated by metabolically-related [[sugar phosphates]]'' and its allosteric kinetics is uni-directional, a property helpful in the regulation of [[galactose metabolism]]. He also proposed a protocol for the desensitization of the enzyme by heat, thereby generating hyperbolic kinetics and demonstrated that the addition and dissociation of [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] activated or de-activated the enzyme. His work was reported to have widened the understanding about the active sites of the enzyme&lt;ref name="Amar Nath Bhaduri - Obituary" /&gt; as well as of the molecular mechanisms of [[Allosteric regulation|allostericity]].&lt;ref name="Brief Profile of the Awardee"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ssbprize.gov.in/content/Detail.aspx?AID=331 | title=Brief Profile of the Awardee | publisher=Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize | date=2016 | accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied the host-parasite interaction of [[Leishmania donovani]], a protozoal pathogen affecting humans, and his work attempted to explain the biomodulatory role for [[Ca2+]] in the life cycle of the parasite.&lt;ref name="Deceased Fellow - A. N.

In late March 2015, shortly after the death of the first [[Prime Minister of Singapore]], [[Lee Kuan Yew]], Yee uploaded a video on YouTube criticising Lee. In the video, Yee compared Lee to [[Jesus]], and cast both in an unfavourable light. Yee also uploaded to his blog an image depicting Lee and [[Margaret Thatcher]] engaged in [[anal sex]]. Yee was arrested and charged with "intention of wounding the religious feelings of [[Christians]]", obscenity, and "threatening, abusive or insulting communication." The first two charges fall under the [[Penal Code (Singapore)|Singapore Penal Code]]. The third charge, which was later withdrawn, was a response to the video's criticism of Lee and falls under the [[Protection from Harassment Act (Singapore)|Protection from Harassment Act]] (POHA).

Yee's trial, which took place on 7 to 8 May 2015, attracted much public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Amos Yee pleads not guilty to both charges|url = http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/amos-yee-pleads-not-guilty-both-charges|accessdate = 16 May 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150512132225/http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/amos-yee-pleads-not-guilty-both-charges|archive-date = 12 May 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court found Yee guilty on 12 May 2015,&lt;ref name="HUSSAIN"&gt;{{cite web|title = Teenage blogger Amos Yee out on bail|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/courts-crime/story/teenage-blogger-amos-yee-out-bail-20150512|website = Straits Times|accessdate = 16 May 2015|first = AMIR|last = HUSSAIN|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150515005120/http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/courts-crime/story/teenage-blogger-amos-yee-out-bail-20150512|archive-date = 15 May 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sentenced him to four weeks in jail.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|title = Singapore court frees 16-year-old blogger Amos Yee - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/06/asia/singapore-teen-blogger-amos-yee-freed/index.html|website = CNN|accessdate = 6 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150707131633/http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/06/asia/singapore-teen-blogger-amos-yee-freed/index.html|archive-date = 7 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Singapore Frees Amos Yee, 16, Blogger Who Criticized Lee Kuan Yew|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/world/asia/singapore-amos-yee-lee-kuan-yew.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 6 July 2015|access-date = 6 July 2015|issn = 0362-4331|first = Austin|last = Ramzy|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150707102006/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/world/asia/singapore-amos-yee-lee-kuan-yew.html|archive-date = 7 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentencing was backdated to include 53 days served in remand, and hence Yee was freed immediately following the trial.&lt;ref name="channelnewsasia1"&gt;{{cite web|title = Amos Yee given 4-week backdated jail term; blogger is 'remorseful', says lawyer|url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/amos-yee-given-4-week/1963292.html|accessdate = 7 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150708020317/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/amos-yee-given-4-week/1963292.html|archive-date = 8 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo1"&gt;{{cite web|title = Amos Yee released: Teenage blogger appeared "traumatised"|url = https://sg.news.yahoo.com/amos-yee-released-teenage-blogger-071502585.html|accessdate = 7 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150708083806/https://sg.news.yahoo.com/amos-yee-released-teenage-blogger-071502585.html|archive-date = 8 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yee appealed against both the court conviction and sentence on 9 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Alice Chia |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/amos-yee-files-appeal/1995234.html |title=Amos Yee files appeal against conviction and sentence |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |date=22 August 2015 |accessdate=13 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110064813/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/amos-yee-files-appeal/1995234.html |archive-date=10 November 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yee's imprisonment drew criticism from human rights organisations, including [[Amnesty International]], which considered Yee to be a [[prisoner of conscience]].&lt;ref name="NYT March 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="July 6 ABC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Singapore teen in anti-Lee video walks free after jail sentence backdated|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-06/singapore-teen-in-anti-lee-video-walks-free-after-sentencing/6599370|accessdate=14 August 2015|agency=ABC News|date=6 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915070651/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-06/singapore-teen-in-anti-lee-video-walks-free-after-sentencing/6599370|archive-date=15 September 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 2016, Yee fled to the United States to seek political asylum. On 24 March 2017, Yee was originally granted asylum in the [[United States of America]] by the Chicago court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US judge grants Amos Yee's asylum request|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/us-judge-grants-amos-yees-asylum-request|accessdate=25 March 2017|work=The Straits Times|date=25 March 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325113101/http://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/us-judge-grants-amos-yees-asylum-request|archive-date=25 March 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the U.S. government appealed against the decision to grant Yee asylum, so he was held at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) center during the appeal process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/amos-yee-faces-more-time-in-detention-as-us-government-appeals-asylum-decision|title=Amos Yee faces more time in detention as US government appeals asylum decision|first=|last=paulam@st|date=26 April 2017|publisher=|access-date=27 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427192802/http://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/amos-yee-faces-more-time-in-detention-as-us-government-appeals-asylum-decision|archive-date=27 April 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amos Yee was released from a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in downtown Chicago on 26 September 2017 following an immigration appeals court's decision to uphold his bid for asylum.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|title=Singapore blogger granted asylum released from custody in Chicago|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-singapore-blogger-chicago-asylum-20170926-story.html|accessdate=26 September 2017|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=26 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926233356/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-singapore-blogger-chicago-asylum-20170926-story.html|archive-date=26 September 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Amos gained overwhelmingly negative attention for his videos and debates in favour of pedophilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Amos Yee receives death threats for publicly supporting pedophilia |url= http://theindependent.sg/amos-yee-receives-death-threats-for-publicly-supporting-pedophilia/ |accessdate= 25 November 2017 |work= The Independent |location= Singapore |date= 25 November 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171125051611/http://www.theindependent.sg/amos-yee-receives-death-threats-for-publicly-supporting-pedophilia/ |archive-date= 25 November 2017 |dead-url= no |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017 Yee was evicted from his apartment in Chicago due to his pro-pedophile stance. In May 2018 Amos' channel was removed by YouTube due to his content being in breach of YouTube’s content policies.

In March 2011, Yee won awards for Best Short Film and Best Actor at ''[[The New Paper]]'''s First Film Fest (FFF) for his film ''Jan''. ''The New Paper'' described Yee as having taken on four different acting roles in his "self-written, self-directed film", which was described as a "twisted dark comedy" in which a boy tries to persuade his three friends to help a cancer-stricken girl.&lt;ref name=NewPaper2012A/&gt;&lt;ref name=FFFwinner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youths gone mild|url=http://newshub.nus.edu.sg/news/1201/PDF/YOUTHS-tnp-12jan-p22.pdf|website=[[The New Paper]]|accessdate=3 April 2015|date=12 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403013242/http://newshub.nus.edu.sg/news/1201/PDF/YOUTHS-tnp-12jan-p22.pdf|archive-date=3 April 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FFFback&gt;{{cite web|last1=Soh|first1=Joanne|title=FiRST Film Fest is back!|url=http://www2.tnp.sg/fff2/content/first-film-fest-back|website=[[The New Paper]]|accessdate=5 May 2015|date=1 December 2011|location=Singapore|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518075535/http://www2.tnp.sg/fff2/content/first-film-fest-back#|archive-date=18 May 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yee, thirteen at the time, was described as having made the film "in his bedroom".&lt;ref name=yorkerheller/&gt; The FFF awarded Yee a [[Sony Handycam NEX-VG10]] video camera and [[Sony Vegas Movie Studio]] HD Platinum 10 [[video editing software]].&lt;ref name=FFFback/&gt;

Following the success of ''Jan'', FFF chief judge [[Jack Neo]] offered an [[internship]] to Yee, and additionally invited Yee to [[audition]] for Neo's film, ''[[We Not Naughty]]'', a film about [[juvenile delinquency]]. When Yee did so in May 2011, Neo cast Yee in a minor acting role after Yee improvised and improved the language in a script given to him.&lt;ref name=FFFwinner/&gt;&lt;ref name=MyPaper2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=FFFback/&gt; Yee played a "smart younger brother" to a lead actor's character, and was allowed by Neo to write his own dialogue.&lt;ref name=FFFback/&gt; Neo said that while Yee only had three scenes in the movie, they were "crucial".&lt;ref name=FFFback/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewPaper2012B&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chua |first1=Charlene |title=Teen actor flamed for video dissing CNY (page 2) |url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Showbiz/Story/A1Story20120120-323071/2.html |work=[[The New Paper]] |location=Singapore |accessdate=1 April 2015 |date=22 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401020158/http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Showbiz/Story/A1Story20120120-323071/2.html |archive-date=1 April 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo also praised Yee as a "natural comedian" with a passion for film-making.&lt;ref name=FFFback/&gt; Regarding Yee being labelled as arrogant, Neo said that "just because [Yee] acts arrogant doesn't mean he is ...

In January 2012, Yee was widely criticised by [[netizens]] for uploading a video to YouTube which – according to ''[[My Paper]]'' – "called the [[Chinese New Year]] a rip-off of the Western New Year's Day".

=== Charging and remand ===
On 31 March three charges were read out to Yee in the [[State Courts of Singapore]], two of which were related to the 2015 video. The first charge was that Yee's 2015 video violated Section 298 of the [[Penal Code]], Chapter 224, as it "contained remarks against Christianity, with the deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of Christians in general".

On 29 April Yee breached his bail conditions on not uploading content online again by making two blog posts; the first questioned "the ridiculous terms of [his] bail", which Yee said "has absolutely nothing to do with my presence in court". In the second, he accused his father of being "abusive" and violent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amos Yee posts on blog, breaches bail terms|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/amos-yee-posts-blog-breaches-bail-terms|website=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|accessdate=30 April 2015|date=30 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503201940/http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/amos-yee-posts-blog-breaches-bail-terms|archive-date=3 May 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 April, the charge concerning remarks against Lee Kuan Yew was stood down.

It remains to be decided whether Law will have to forfeit the previous $20,000 posted. Yee was again taken into remand because of a lack of anyone posting bail.&lt;ref name=TodayAssault/&gt; Law later told ''The Online Citizen'' that while he wanted to post bail for Yee again, Yee rejected Law's offer as he did not want himself to be gagged, leading to Law discharging himself. Law also said that he did not regret acting as Yee's bailor, and that from talking to Yee, he had found him to be childlike and lacking in empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2015/05/vincent-law-no-regrets-as-bailor-for-amos-yee|title=Vincent Law: No regrets as bailor for Amos Yee|last1=Xu|first1=Terry|website=[[The Online Citizen]]|accessdate=6 May 2015|date=5 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530233330/http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2015/05/vincent-law-no-regrets-as-bailor-for-amos-yee/|archive-date=30 May 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 May Yee's lawyers appealed for a change in bail amount and bail conditions, arguing that accessing social media was "like drinking water" to Yee, and that the ban on Yee posting online content was "too broad and disproportionate". The prosecution was willing to lower the bail amount and release Yee from having to report daily to a police station if Yee went for psychiatric counselling, but Yee refused. Consequently, the High Court judge [[Tay Yong Kwang]] decided to maintain Yee's bail conditions.&lt;ref name=wheneight&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neo|first1=Chai Chin|title=High Court dismisses bid to vary Amos Yee's bail conditions|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/high-court-dismisses-bid-vary-amos-yees-bail-conditions?singlepage=true|website=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|accessdate=6 May 2015|date=6 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212340/http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/high-court-dismisses-bid-vary-amos-yees-bail-conditions?singlepage=true|archive-date=9 May 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Law|first1=Elizabeth|title=No change for Amos Yee's bail conditions|url=http://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore-news/no-change-amos-yees-bail-conditions|website=[[The New Paper]]|accessdate=6 May 2015|date=6 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518072242/http://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore-news/no-change-amos-yees-bail-conditions|archive-date=18 May 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Defence comprises Alfred Dodwell and Chong Jia Hao from Dodwell &amp; Co LLC and Ervin Tan from Michael Hwang Chambers LLC. The proceedings were presided over by District Judge Jasvendar Kaur.

The proceedings began with arguments from the defence regarding the obscenity charge. They argued that the legal test to determine whether or not an image is obscene is whether "it has an effect which is to tend to deprave and corrupt" any person who is exposed to it, and that the prosecution has not provided any evidence that the image passes the test. They argued that Section 292, under which Amos Yee is being charged, "is targeted at peddlers and purveyors of pornography" and that it is "wholly inapt to describe the mischief (if any) in this case". The prosecution had argued that Yee's own comments showed his intention to "corrupt and deprave", but the defence countered that a person cannot be convicted [[ipse dixit]]. They also argued that the image was "not a pornographic image, designed to arouse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dodwell-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Amos-Yee-8-May-15-Prosecution-Closing-Submissions.pdf|title=Public prosecutor v Amos Yee Pang Sang|access-date=8 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824140534/https://www.dodwell-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Amos-Yee-8-May-15-Prosecution-Closing-Submissions.pdf|archive-date=24 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In court documents, Yee explained that his intention in critiquing both Christianity and Lee Kuan Yew was to open discussions on what he saw as "problems" with the faith and Singapore. He said that he was aware his critique would lead some people to take offence, but argued that this promoted discussion that "was healthy for positive change to take place in future." Yee also explained that while he "was aware that critiquing these problems (with the Christian faith) would promote ill-will", he saw this as "a natural consequence", and that "promoting ill-will is a prerogative for positive change to happen in society, especially if the issue at hand were initially controversial." In the hearing, Yee's defence lawyers Ervin Tan sought to challenge the understanding of the word "obscene" in relation to the charge against Yee for circulating obscene imagery. Another of his lawyers Alfred Dodwell was allowed to admit one more exhibit that he said would "vindicate his client". While the prosecution initially challenged this, the judge allowed its submission, to applause from members of the public in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Verdict in blogger Amos Yee's trial due Tuesday|url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/judge-to-deliver/1833616.html|accessdate = 16 May 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150515023621/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/judge-to-deliver/1833616.html|archive-date = 15 May 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the court documents was the revelation that Yee knew that the contents of his blogs and videos would be offensive, but went ahead with posting them. Yee had said that he was "aware that the content of the video was offensive and would promote feelings of disharmony and ill-will within the Christian community".&lt;ref name="channelnewsasia.com"/&gt;

Yee's trial drew international attention. The [[Wall Street Journal]] writes that Yee's trial showcases "Singapore's struggle to adapt its tradition of censorship to the realities of the digital era."&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/teen-youtube-rant-tests-singapores-censorship-limits-1431081983 |title= Teen YouTube Rant Tests Singapore's Censorship Limits |work= The Wall Street Journal |location= Singapore |date= 31 March 2015 |accessdate= 8 May 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150510203258/http://www.wsj.com/articles/teen-youtube-rant-tests-singapores-censorship-limits-1431081983 |archive-date= 10 May 2015 |dead-url= no |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Verdict ===

The court found Yee guilty and convicted him of both charges on 12 May 2015. With regards to the obscenity charge, judge Jasvender Kaur said that "standards of obscenity will change from time to time", and differ among countries, and that "it was up to the courts to decide based on community standards." Kaur considered the effect that image had on teenagers, and concluded that it met the "strongest possible disapproval and condemnation". With regards to the second charge on making remarks intending to hurt the feelings of Christians, Kaur said that Yee's remarks were "clearly derogatory and offensive to Christians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/courts-crime/story/amos-yee-find-out-verdict-his-case-tuesday-afternoon-20150512|title=Amos Yee found guilty of both charges, sentencing on June 2 pending probation report|access-date=12 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513214609/http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/courts-crime/story/amos-yee-find-out-verdict-his-case-tuesday-afternoon-20150512|archive-date=13 May 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yee's bail was reduced to $10,000, and his parents paid the bail. The prohibition for him to post online was lifted. Yee was required to remove the offensive YouTube video and the blog post in question; it is not an offence, however, for other people to re-post Yee's videos or blog post. Yee complied, but 9 days later, on 21 May Yee made public both the blog post and video again.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|title = Prosecution calls for reformative training for Amos Yee after he refuses to cooperate with probation officer|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/courts-crime/story/prosecution-calls-reformative-training-amos-yee-after-he-refuses-c|website = Straits Times|accessdate = 27 May 2015|first = AMIR|last = HUSSAIN|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150528015003/http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/courts-crime/story/prosecution-calls-reformative-training-amos-yee-after-he-refuses-c|archive-date = 28 May 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Singapore teen in trouble again for re-posting anti-Lee video|url = http://zeenews.india.com/news/world/singapore-teen-in-trouble-again-for-re-posting-anti-lee-video_1602592.html|accessdate = 27 May 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150529203022/http://zeenews.india.com/news/world/singapore-teen-in-trouble-again-for-re-posting-anti-lee-video_1602592.html|archive-date = 29 May 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The verdict attracted international attention. International rights group [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) criticised the verdict as "publicly punishing a youthful dissident who dared besmirch the image of the recently passed leader, and intimidating anyone else who might think of doing the same in the future."

=== Molestation allegations ===

On 13 May 2015, a day after being released, Yee took to Facebook alleging that he had been molested by his ex-bailor Law. Law said the allegation was "false". Yee invited the media to "catch" him at an [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|MRT]] station, but he did not show up. Yee later revealed that his allegations were part of a ploy to "manipulate the press to indulge in the thoroughly exhausting experience of waiting in Pasir Panjang fruitlessly for several hours". Yee also revealed that Law "didn't really molest" him, but maintained that Law was "creepy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Amos Yee manipulates mainstream media with allegation of molest|url = http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2015/05/amos-yee-manipulates-mainstream-media-with-allegation-of-molest/|accessdate = 16 May 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150518104348/http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2015/05/amos-yee-manipulates-mainstream-media-with-allegation-of-molest/|archive-date = 18 May 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Amos Yee manipulates mainstream media with molestation allegations {{!}} Asian Correspondent|url = http://asiancorrespondent.com/132897/amos-yee-manipulates-mainstream-media-with-allegation-of-molestation/|website = asiancorrespondent.com|accessdate = 16 May 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150517073829/http://asiancorrespondent.com/132897/amos-yee-manipulates-mainstream-media-with-allegation-of-molestation/|archive-date = 17 May 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the allegations, Law told [[The Online Citizen]] (TOC) that "he found Yee's clarification to be insincere and that it does not fully absolve him from the allegation of molest", said that he would "take legal action" for defamation if Yee does not apologise publicly and fully retract the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Amos' former bailor demands 'unreserved apology'|url = http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/05/14/amos-former-bailor-demands-unreserved-apology/|accessdate = 16 May 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150515120610/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/05/14/amos-former-bailor-demands-unreserved-apology/#|archive-date = 15 May 2015|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Amos Yee's bailor Vincent Law demands 'unreserved apology' for molestation claim|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/courts-crime/story/amos-yees-bailor-demands-unreserved-apology-molestation-claim-2015#sthash.eOUaQxUy.dpuf|website = Straits Times|accessdate = 16 May 2015|first = OLIVIA|last = HO|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150516021040/http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/courts-crime/story/amos-yees-bailor-demands-unreserved-apology-molestation-claim-2015#sthash.eOUaQxUy.dpuf|archive-date = 16 May 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yee stated that "it was stupid of people to believe that he would actually issue a sincere apology". He attributes this "inherent stupidity" to "the mindset inherent in that of religion". He then proceeded to call Law a "molester", a "mentally unsound person" and a "hypocrite". Yee also described his interactions with Law and explained how he plotted to publicly humiliate Law while he was in remand prison.

=== Sentencing ===
On 27 May 2015, Yee was called back to court for an urgent hearing as he refused to meet with his assigned probation officer. The prosecution called for a report to assess Yee's suitability for reformative training, arguing that a jail term or a fine would have no rehabilitative effect.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Amos Yee should be sent to Reformative Training Centre: Prosecution|url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/amos-yee-to-return-to/1874696.html|accessdate = 27 May 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150626113031/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/amos-yee-to-return-to/1874696.html|archive-date = 26 June 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Prosecution seeks reformative training for Amos Yee|url = http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/prosecution-seeking-reformative-training-amos-yee-who-has-made-public-offending-content|accessdate = 27 May 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150531052819/http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/prosecution-seeking-reformative-training-amos-yee-who-has-made-public-offending-content|archive-date = 31 May 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 June Yee was remanded for three weeks and a report was made to assess whether Yee was suitable to serve reformative training.&lt;ref name="channelnewsasia2"&gt;{{cite web|title = Amos Yee trial: Teen blogger remanded for 3 weeks|url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/amos-yee-trial-teen/1886442.html|accessdate = 24 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150626121752/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/amos-yee-trial-teen/1886442.html|archive-date = 26 June 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this remand period, no bail option was offered. This decision came after Yee rejected the option of probation and instead pleaded for a jail term.

On 23 June 2015 district judge Kaur ordered that Yee be remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for two weeks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Amos Yee remanded at IMH for 2 weeks|url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/amos-yee-remanded-at-imh/1934264.html|accessdate = 24 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150623082145/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/amos-yee-remanded-at-imh/1934264.html|archive-date = 23 June 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to a report by Dr Munidasa Winslow who said that Yee may suffer from autism-spectrum disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Autism spectrum disorder: Fixated preferences could be a sign|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/more-singapore-stories/story/amos-yee-may-have-autism-spectrum-disorder-fixated-prefe|website = Straits Times|accessdate = 25 June 2015|first = JOAN|last = CHEW}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reformative training suitability report found Yee physically and mentally suitable for reformative training. Kaur reported that she was exploring other sentencing options, such as a mandatory treatment order, which would compel Yee to undergo psychiatric treatment.

At the Institute for Mental Health, Yee was evaluated by psychiatrist Cai Yi Ming,&lt;ref name="asiaone1"&gt;{{cite web|title = Sentence backdated, Amos Yee released|url = http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/sentence-backdated-amos-yee-released|accessdate = 7 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150710015957/http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/sentence-backdated-amos-yee-released|archive-date = 10 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who said that Yee "promised not to re-offend as he realised what he did was against the law and could disrupt social harmony". Contrary to the suspicions that Winslow had, Cai's report concluded that Yee does not suffer from any mental disorder, and would benefit from having a counsellor or mentor guide him in using the Internet.&lt;ref name="thestar.com.my"&gt;{{cite web|title = Sentence backdated, Amos Yee released - Regional {{!}} The Star Online|url = http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Regional/2015/07/07/Amos-Yee-Released/|website = www.thestar.com.my|accessdate = 7 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150707203821/http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Regional/2015/07/07/Amos-Yee-Released/|archive-date = 7 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that Yee was "trapped in the Net" and is "unable to discern untruths in cyberspace".&lt;ref name="channelnewsasia1"/&gt;

====Sentence criticism====
Yee's sentence was met with criticism from the United Nations Human Rights Office which called for the immediate release of Yee in line with its commitment under the UN Convention on the Rights of Child.&lt;ref name="Nylander"&gt;{{cite web|title = UN Urges Singapore To Release 16-Year-Old Blogger Amos Yee: UPDATED|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/jnylander/2015/06/23/un-urges-singapore-to-release-16-year-old-blogger-accused-of-posting-critical-lee-kuan-yew-photos/|accessdate = 24 June 2015|first = Johan|last = Nylander|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150623073304/http://www.forbes.com/sites/jnylander/2015/06/23/un-urges-singapore-to-release-16-year-old-blogger-accused-of-posting-critical-lee-kuan-yew-photos/|archive-date = 23 June 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It said that "while recognizing the Singapore authorities concern with public morality and social harmony, OHCHR is concerned that the criminal sanctions considered in this case seem disproportionate and inappropriate in terms of the international protections for freedom of expression and opinion."&lt;ref name="Nylander"/&gt; The group appealed to the Singapore authorities to give special considerations to Yee's juvenile status and ensure that his treatment with the best interests of the child.

Yee's sentence was also met with criticism from the Humans Rights Watch. Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director said that "nothing that Amos Yee said or posted should ever have been considered criminal – much less merit incarceration." He went on the say that "the dismal state of Singapore's respect for free expression can be seen in the decision to impose the criminal justice system on outspoken 16-year-olds".&lt;ref name="Nylander"/&gt; In response to the mandatory psychiatric treatment that Yee is ordered to undergo, Robertson said that "The court has provided no adequate justification for Yee's further detention and has ordered forced psychiatric tests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Singapore: Exonerate 16-Year-Old Blogger {{!}} Human Rights Watch|url = https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/06/22/singapore-exonerate-16-year-old-blogger|publisher = Human Rights Watch|accessdate = 24 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150624015311/http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/06/22/singapore-exonerate-16-year-old-blogger|archive-date = 24 June 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yee's sentence was met with opposition from within Singapore. Singaporean politician [[Goh Meng Seng]] said that even though he did not like Amos "because he's rude in the Singapore context", he felt that "he [had] to defend his rights."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Singaporean academic Cherian George, lawyer Peter Low, a former president of the Law Society of Singapore, as well as leading rights activists, academics, filmmakers and members of the arts community signed a letter saying that they were "troubled by the State’s harsh reactions and that "sending Yee to the facility could deter young people in the city-state from expressing their views openly for fear of reprisals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Singapore activists, human rights groups denounce 'harsh' treatment of Amos Yee|url = http://www.themalaymailonline.com/world/article/singapore-activists-human-rights-groups-denounce-harsh-treatment-of-amos-ye|accessdate = 5 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150707135556/http://www.themalaymailonline.com/world/article/singapore-activists-human-rights-groups-denounce-harsh-treatment-of-amos-ye|archive-date = 7 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, an open letter expressing concerns about the way Yee was treated was signed by 77 individuals, including civil society activist Braema Mathi, playwright Alfan Sa'at and academic Cherian George, saying that Yee's prosecution has created a "negative impact on his well-being and that of his family".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Open letter over state's treatment of Amos Yee sent to PM|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/open-letter-over-states-treatment-of-amos-yee-sent-to-pm|accessdate = 5 July 2015|first = DANSON|last = CHEONG|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150706171125/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/open-letter-over-states-treatment-of-amos-yee-sent-to-pm|archive-date = 6 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Yee's mother apologised to Yee on her own Facebook profile&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/mary.toh.927/posts/107008039641495 |title=Mary Toh - Sorry Son.

====Hospitalisation====
On 5 July 2015, the night before Yee's next hearing was scheduled to be held, Yee was admitted to the [[Emergency department|Accident and Emergency department]] at [[Changi Hospital]]&lt;ref name="Amos Yee sent to hospital"&gt;{{cite web|title = Amos Yee sent to hospital|url = http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2015/07/amos-yee-sent-to-hospital/|accessdate = 6 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150705200851/http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2015/07/amos-yee-sent-to-hospital/|archive-date = 5 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; for low [[blood glucose]] levels.

On 6 July Yee was sentenced to four weeks in jail,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; one week for posting obscene materials and three weeks for wounding the religious feelings of Christian in his video calling Lee Kuan Yew a “horrible person”, with the sentences to be served consecutively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Amos Yee, Singaporean teenager who berated founding father Lee Kuan Yew in online video, given 4 weeks in jail|url = http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/1834003/amos-yee-singaporean-teenager-who-berated-founding-father|accessdate = 6 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150706190229/http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/1834003/amos-yee-singaporean-teenager-who-berated-founding-father|archive-date = 6 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was addressed directly by the judge Kaur who said that she hopes that Yee would "rethink long and hard his decision not to continue with formal education," before acknowledging that there are few dropout success stories.&lt;ref name="asiaone1"/&gt;

Yee was released immediately after his sentences were announced as they were backdated to 2 June when he was in remand (Yee was in remand for 50 days).&lt;ref name="The changing faces of Amos Yee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thestar.com.my"/&gt; Yee's demeanor when he was freed differed from his previous court appearances. Yee appeared pale and gaunt,&lt;ref name="yahoo1"/&gt; wore a frown on his face and kept his head bowed most of the time. In court, Deputy Public Prosecutor Hay Hung Chun said that they saw Yee's actions as "no less than a significant repudiation of his previous posturing, and it is an important acknowledgment that he has finally accepted the gravity of what he had done and that he was or is willing now to make amends by undoing it.” This was in response to Institute of Mental Health child psychiatrist Cai Yiming's report that Yee had admitted to his guilt and has “realised what he has done was against the law and could disrupt social harmony”. As a result of the change which Hay describes as "seismic", Hay announced that the prosecution would be asking for just one day of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Amos Yee released after 4-week jail term is backdated|url = http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/teenage-blogger-amos-yee-sentenced-four-weeks-jail|accessdate = 6 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150707222206/http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/teenage-blogger-amos-yee-sentenced-four-weeks-jail|archive-date = 7 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his release, Yee began to ask for cash donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Traumatized Amos Yee is open for Donation|url = http://www.freedistrict.com/asia/singapore-2-asia/traumatized-amos-yee-open-donation-9983.html|accessdate = 23 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150723174220/http://www.freedistrict.com/asia/singapore-2-asia/traumatized-amos-yee-open-donation-9983.html|archive-date = 23 July 2015|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She questioned the motive of the sentence, asking whether it was "justice for a crime", or "just as a way to quash Amos into docility.”&lt;ref name="yahoo1"/&gt; The [[Association of Women for Action and Research]] criticised the court decision and urged the state to be mindful of the "stigmatising effect of such prosecutions in the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = AWARE statement on the prosecution of Amos Yee|url = http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2015/07/aware-statement-on-the-prosecution-of-amos-yee-2/|accessdate = 23 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150723172433/http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2015/07/aware-statement-on-the-prosecution-of-amos-yee-2/|archive-date = 23 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/aware-expresses-grave-concerns-over-amos-yee-case|title = AWARE expresses grave concerns over Amos Yee case|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protests against treatment of Yee ===

Yee's sentence led to protests from several activist groups. On 27 June 2015 about sixty people under the banner of the [[Taiwan Association for Human Rights]] demonstrated outside the Singapore Trade Office in Taipei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About 60 demonstrate outside S'pore Trade Office in Taipei; call for Amos Yee's release|url = http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/about-60-demonstrate-outside-spore-trade-office-taipei-call-amos-yees-release|accessdate = 1 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150701092455/http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/about-60-demonstrate-outside-spore-trade-office-taipei-call-amos-yees-release|archive-date = 1 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters from more than 10 civil society groups under the banner of the Taiwan Association for Human Rights (TAHR) held placards and chanted "Free Amos Yee" for about half an hour.

[[File:Free Amos Yee 1.jpg|thumb|Hong Kong students protest to release Amos Yee]]
On 30 June university students in [[Hong Kong]] held a protest to urge the Singapore government to release Yee. Student activist group Scholarism, which took part in the protest, published a post asserting that the actions taken against Yee "reflects the unreasonable oppression and the very limited acceptance of dynamic voices in the so-called 'modernised' society of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Hong Kong students protest near Singapore consulate urging Amos Yee's release|url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/hong-kong-students/1952510.html|accessdate = 1 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150911023107/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/hong-kong-students/1952510.html|archive-date = 11 September 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Release Singaporean teen blogger Amos Yee, Hong Kong student group Scholarism urges|url = http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1829377/singapore-should-release-teen-blogger-amos-yee-hong-kong|accessdate = 1 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150702070403/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1829377/singapore-should-release-teen-blogger-amos-yee-hong-kong|archive-date = 2 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Hong Kong students protest outside Singapore consulate, urge release of Amos Yee, East Asia News &amp; Top Stories - The Straits Times|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/hong-kong-student-group-scholarism-urges-release-of-amos-yee-petition-planned-outside|accessdate = 1 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150701193241/http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/hong-kong-student-group-scholarism-urges-release-of-amos-yee-petition-planned-outside|archive-date = 1 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July a demonstration was held in Hong Kong, where protestors burnt [[effigies]] of [[Lee Hsien Loong]] and [[Lee Kuan Yew]], to demand the release of Yee. About 50 people from various civic and political groups gathered with banners and placards near the Singapore Consulate in Admiralty district.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title = Protesters in Hong Kong demand release of Singaporean teen Amos Yee|url = http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1832719/admiralty-protesters-demand-release-singaporean-teen-amos|accessdate = 5 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150706172417/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1832719/admiralty-protesters-demand-release-singaporean-teen-amos|archive-date = 6 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They held banners and placards that read "Dissident is not Demented" and "Freedom of Speech should not be infringed".&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Also on 5 July in Singapore, a rally organised by Community Action Network, a group of individuals describing themselves as "concerned about freedom of expression in Singapore", was attended by an estimated 500 people.&lt;ref name="yahoo2"/&gt; The rally was held to demand the release of Yee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Rally at Hong Lim Park calls for Amos Yee's release|url = http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/rally-hong-lim-park-calls-amos-yees-release|accessdate = 5 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150706141639/http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/rally-hong-lim-park-calls-amos-yees-release|archive-date = 6 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisers of the protest were "damning" in their condemnation of the state’s handling of Yee’s case. Jolovan Wham, a social worker and civil activist said that “[the activists] came together to protest what the government is doing to Amos Yee, and to take a stand on freedom of expression,” citing "an unprecedented crackdown on freedom of expression in Singapore” in the last few years.&lt;ref name="yahoo2"/&gt;

Yee filed an appeal against the conviction and sentence, ahead of 20 July 2015 deadline for making an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Singaporean blogger Amos Yee appeals against conviction, sentence|url = http://www.themalaymailonline.com/world/article/singaporean-blogger-amos-yee-appealing-against-conviction-sentence|accessdate = 23 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150723184253/http://www.themalaymailonline.com/world/article/singaporean-blogger-amos-yee-appealing-against-conviction-sentence|archive-date = 23 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yee's lawyer, Dodwell, said that "whether this was a crime or not still remains a question [that they wanted to] determine in the high court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Amos Yee files appeal against conviction and sentence|url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/amos-yee-files-appeal/1995234.html|accessdate = 23 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150722175126/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/amos-yee-files-appeal/1995234.html|archive-date = 22 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yee's mother said that she wanted "to know for sure that what Amos has done is not criminally wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Teen blogger Amos Yee files appeal|url = http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/305598|website = www.malaysiakini.com|accessdate = 23 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150723172940/http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/305598|archive-date = 23 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the hearing at the High Court, Yee's lawyers want the appeal to be heard by a non-Christian judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Lawyers want judge who's not Christian for Amos Yee appeal|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/lawyers-want-judge-whos-not-christian-for-amos-yee-appeal|accessdate = 23 July 2015|first = OLIVIA|last = HO|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150723200453/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/lawyers-want-judge-whos-not-christian-for-amos-yee-appeal|archive-date = 23 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second offence for hurting religious feelings, arrest and conviction==

In his post on 27 November 2015, Amos addressed [[Calvin Cheng]]'s comments on killing the children of terrorist members. He wrote, "Oh yes and **** [[Islam]], and Allah doesn’t exist, but say you see a prick from ISIS who wants to kill or has even killed before, don't think that's a scenario where it's alright to kill him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2016/05/24/timeline-of-amos-yees-latest-arrest-by-the-singapore-police-force-over-section-298-of-penal-code/|title=Timeline of Amos Yee's latest arrest by the Singapore Police Force over Section 298 of penal code - The Online Citizen|date=24 May 2016|publisher=|access-date=19 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824101839/https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2016/05/24/timeline-of-amos-yees-latest-arrest-by-the-singapore-police-force-over-section-298-of-penal-code/|archive-date=24 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His statement prompted several police reports from the public,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Min Kok|title=Singaporean, 17, believed to be blogger Amos Yee, investigated for allegedly offensive religious remarks|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/singaporean-17-believed-to-be-blogger-amos-yee-investigated-for-allegedly|accessdate=16 March 2016|publisher=Straits Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320085950/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/singaporean-17-believed-to-be-blogger-amos-yee-investigated-for-allegedly|archive-date=20 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Amos Yee to be interviewed by police for offensive remarks|url = http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/amos-yee-be-interviewed-police-offensive-remarks|accessdate = 16 December 2015|date = 16 December 2015|website = TODAYonline|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151218090155/http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/amos-yee-be-interviewed-police-offensive-remarks|archive-date = 18 December 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent police investigation in December 2015 for allegedly posting offensive material on his blog.

On 13 May 2016, it was reported in the Straits Times that Yee was arrested on 11 May for ''allegedly uttering words last November with a deliberate intent to wound religious or racial feelings'' and for ''[[Unsupervised probation|not showing up at a police station]]''.

===Trial===
On 17 August 2016, Yee stood trial over six charges for deliberate intent to wound religious feelings and two charges for failure to turn up for police interviews. He was not represented by a lawyer. Seven police officers were summoned as prosection's witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/amos-yee-back-in-court-over-offensive-videos|title=Amos Yee back in court over offensive videos|first=|last=hermes|date=18 August 2016|publisher=|access-date=11 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111205635/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/amos-yee-back-in-court-over-offensive-videos|archive-date=11 November 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the trial could proceed further, Yee was granted permission to go for Criminal Case Resolution process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2016/08/17/amos-yee-represents-himself-in-court-to-stand-trial-against-8-charges/|title=Amos Yee represents himself in court to stand trial against 8 charges - The Online Citizen|date=17 August 2016|publisher=|access-date=11 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111204958/https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2016/08/17/amos-yee-represents-himself-in-court-to-stand-trial-against-8-charges/|archive-date=11 November 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life in US ==
On 16 December 2016, Amos Yee fled to the United States where he was detained at Chicago's [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare Airport]] after announcing his intention to seek political asylum. During the application, he was incarcerated in [[McHenry County, Illinois|McHenry County]] Jail in [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rachel Au-Yongrachelay |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/teenage-blogger-amos-yee-detained-in-united-states |title=Teenage blogger Amos Yee detained in United States, Singapore News &amp; Top Stories |publisher=The Straits Times |date=23 December 2016 |accessdate=13 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230204424/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/teenage-blogger-amos-yee-detained-in-united-states |archive-date=30 December 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently transferred to [[Dodge County, Wisconsin|Dodge County]] Detention Facility in [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/us-judge-grants-amos-yees-asylum-request |title=US judge grants Amos Yee's asylum request, United States News &amp; Top Stories |publisher=The Straits Times |date=25 March 2017 |accessdate=13 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408200808/http://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/us-judge-grants-amos-yees-asylum-request |archive-date=8 April 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yee was granted asylum in the US on 24 March 2017, after the judge ruled that Yee faced persecution in Singapore for his political opinions; the judge cited the different ways that [[Calvin Cheng|Cheng]] and Yee were treated in his decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Philemon |first1=Jewel |title=Amos Yee is deserving of asylum, US Board of Immigration Appeal rules |url=http://www.theindependent.sg/amos-yee-is-deserving-of-asylum-us-board-of-immigration-appeal-rules/ |work=The Independent |location=Singapore |date=26 September 2017 |access-date=5 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107015822/http://www.theindependent.sg/amos-yee-is-deserving-of-asylum-us-board-of-immigration-appeal-rules/ |archive-date=7 November 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Teen blogger Amos Yee granted US asylum |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/teen-blogger-amos-yee-granted-us-asylum/3624426.html |accessdate=25 March 2017 |work=Channel NewsAsia |location=Singapore |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325023808/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/teen-blogger-amos-yee-granted-us-asylum/3624426.html |archive-date=25 March 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yee was due to serve his national service upon reaching 18 years old in October 2016.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news |title=Singapore blogger seeking U.S. asylum regrets posts in home country |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-singapore-blogger-idUSKBN14J1ZC |accessdate=25 March 2017 |publisher=Reuters |date=30 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326055355/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-singapore-blogger-idUSKBN14J1ZC |archive-date=26 March 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By leaving Singapore, Yee breached Singaporean law which mandates [[National service in Singapore|compulsory military service]] for all Singaporean men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Singapore teen blogger Amos Yee granted US asylum |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39388810 |accessdate=25 March 2017 |work=BBC News |date=25 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325032956/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39388810 |archive-date=25 March 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 April 2017, the U.S. government appealed against the decision to grant Yee asylum, so he continued to be held at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) center during the appeal process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; On his reasons for seeking U.S. asylum, Reuters reported that although Yee was highly critical of the U.S. government abroad, he has said that - "It is not going to the best country. This is about going to the country that most effectively promotes my political philosophy of [[anarchist communism|anarchical communism]] and ending private property and wage labor".&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

Amos Yee was released from a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in downtown Chicago on 26 September 2017 following an immigration appeals court's decision to uphold his bid for asylum. A Board of Immigration Appeals decision upheld Chicago immigration judge Samuel Cole's March ruling that Yee had a "well-founded fear" of being persecuted upon return to Singapore. The judge said the aim of jailing Yee in Singapore at such a young age was to stifle his political speech. With asylum status, Yee will be eligible to apply for a green card in a year.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"/&gt;

Yee told reporters after his release that he can now criticise the Singaporean government without fear of imprisonment, and that while he planned to make more critical videos on the topic, he might also broaden his work to US politics since he is in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Singaporean blogger released after winning U.S. ruling for asylum|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-singapore-blogger/singaporean-blogger-released-after-winning-u-s-ruling-for-asylum-idUSKCN1C12WW|accessdate=27 September 2017|publisher=Reuters|date=27 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926234641/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-singapore-blogger/singaporean-blogger-released-after-winning-u-s-ruling-for-asylum-idUSKCN1C12WW|archive-date=26 September 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"/&gt;

'''Louise Johanna "Anneke" Grönloh''' (7 June 1942 – 14 September 2018) was an Indonesia-born Dutch singer. She had a successful career starting in 1959 that lasted throughout the 1960s, and scored a hit with "Brandend Zand", one of the best-selling Dutch songs of all time.

== Life ==
[[File:Diva Anneke Gronloh.jpg|thumb|Anneke Grönloh in 2007]]
Grönloh was born in [[Minahasa Regency|Tondano]], [[North Celebes]], [[Netherlands East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]), and spent her early years in the Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies in a Japanese concentration camp. Her father, an officer in the KNIL, had been [[interned]] before her birth.

After the war, the family moved to the Netherlands, and Grönloh grew up in [[Eindhoven]]. At the ''Gemeentelijk Lyceum'' (Municipal College) she met and played with [[Peter Koelewijn]] and his band ''Peter en zijn Rockets'' at parties. In 1959 her career took off after she won a talent show. On 31 August 1964 she married [[Wim-Jaap van der Laan]], a DJ for Dutch radio station [[Radio Veronica]], and in 1965 began singing in the [[Snip en Snap|Sleeswijk Revue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europopmusic.eu/Holland_pages/Gronloh.html|title=Anneke Gronloh – europopmusic|language=Dutch|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1960s she scored hits, especially with "Brandend Zand" (English: "Burning sand"). At the height of her fame, in 1964, Grönloh took part in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1964|Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song "[[Jij bent mijn leven]]" (English: "You are my life"), which ended with a joint tenth place with the Belgian entry, and by the end of the 1960s she had begun an international singing career.

Besides popular music, Grönloh also performed the [[kroncong]] genre, singing songs such as "[[Bengawan Solo (song)|Bengawan Solo]]", "Boeroeng Kakatua", and "Nina Bobo", and also sings jazz, which she claims is her favorite genre.

== Singer of the Century==
In 2000, Grönloh was named "Singer of the Century" because of the record-breaking sales of "Brandend Zand". In the same year, she was also a participant on the television program [[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother VIPS]]. In 2006 she released ''Anneke and Friends'', a DVD of her theater tours. Later that year she was part of the theater tour "Purple 100", replacing [[Corry Brokken]] who could not perform due to illness.

== End of career ==
Grönloh had retired due to health problems; she played her last show on 26 August 2017.

== Death ==
Grönloh died on 14 September 2018, at the age of 76. Reports indicate that she will be laid to rest in France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.star2.com/entertainment/2018/09/23/singer-anneke-gronloh-dies/ ‘Bengawan Solo’, ‘Asmara’ singer Anneke Gronloh dies] ''Star2'' (September 23, 2018).

[[File:Barney Hill, Betty Hill and dog, Desley.jpg|thumb|right|Betty and Barney Hill with their dog, Delsey.]]
'''Barney and Betty Hill''' were an American couple who claimed they were abducted by [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] in a rural portion of the state of [[New Hampshire]] from September 19 to September 20, 1961. It was the first widely publicized report of an [[alien abduction]] in the United States.

The incident came to be called the "Hill Abduction" and the "Zeta Reticuli Incident" because the couple stated they had been kidnapped by aliens who claimed to be from the [[Zeta Reticuli]] system. Their story was adapted into the best-selling 1966 book ''The Interrupted Journey'' and the 1975 television movie ''[[The UFO Incident]]''.  In September 2016, plans were announced to make a film based on the events, with an unknown release date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/613639-famous-alien-abduction| title=Alien Abduction Tale Heads to the Big Screen| work=ComingSoon.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Betty Hill's notes, tapes, and other items have been placed in the permanent collection at the [[University of New Hampshire]], her [[alma mater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.library.unh.edu/special/index.php/betty-and-barney-hill| title=Special Collections, University Archives &amp; Museum| work=unh.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, the state Division of Historical Resources marked the site of the alleged craft's first approach with a [[List of New Hampshire historical markers (201–225)#224. Betty and Barney Hill Incident|historical marker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Jordan |first=Jessica |title=Little Green Men Celebrated in NH |pages= |newspaper=NH.com |location= |date=July 25, 2011 |url=http://www.nh.com/nhbloggers/927157-180/little-green-men-celebrated-in-nh.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201234308/http://www.nh.com/nhbloggers/927157-180/little-green-men-celebrated-in-nh.html |archivedate=February 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The Hills lived in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearse|first=Steve|title=Set Your Phaser to Stun|date=2011|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|page=355|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gg6Yha6LJWUC&amp;pg=PA355&amp;dq=Betty+and+Barney+Hill+abduction+portsmouth+nh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zEsSU8fLAsHP2wWInYCYDg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Betty%20and%20Barney%20Hill%20abduction%20portsmouth%20nh&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} Barney (1922–1969) was employed by the [[United States Postal Service]], while Betty (''née'' Eunice Barrett)&lt;ref&gt;{{https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9674737/betty-hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1919–2004) was a [[social work]]er. Active in the local [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] congregation, the Hills were also members of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] and community leaders, and Barney sat on a local board of the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]]. They were an [[interracial marriage|interracial couple]] at a time when it was particularly uncommon in the United States; Barney was [[African Americans|African American]] and Betty was [[White Americans|white]].

== UFO encounter ==
According to a variety of reports given by the Hills, the alleged UFO sighting happened on September 19, 1961, around 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. The Hills were driving back to Portsmouth from a vacation in [[Niagara Falls]] and [[Montreal]]. Just south of [[Lancaster, New Hampshire]], Betty claimed to have observed a bright point of light in the sky that moved from below the moon and the planet [[Jupiter]], upward to the west of the moon. While Barney navigated [[U.S. Route 3]], Betty reasoned that she was observing a falling star, only it moved upward.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, 1961, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Since it moved erratically and grew bigger and brighter, Betty urged Barney to stop the car for a closer look, as well as to walk their dog, Delsey. Barney stopped at a scenic picnic area just south of [[Twin Mountain, New Hampshire|Twin Mountain]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman/Marden, Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience, 2007. p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Betty, looking through binoculars, observed an "odd-shaped" craft flashing multi-colored lights travel across the face of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman/Marden, ''Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience'', 2007, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Because her sister had several years earlier said she saw a [[flying saucer]], Betty thought it might be what she was observing. Through binoculars, Barney observed what he reasoned was a commercial airliner traveling toward [[Vermont]] on its way to Montreal. However, he soon changed his mind, because without looking as if it had turned, the craft rapidly descended in his direction. This observation caused Barney to realize, "this object that was a plane was ''not'' a plane."&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, ''The Interrupted Journey'', 1966, p 76.&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly returned to the car and drove toward [[Franconia Notch]], a narrow, mountainous stretch of the road.

The Hills claimed that they continued driving on the isolated road, moving very slowly through Franconia Notch in order to observe the object as it came even closer. At one point, the object passed above a restaurant and signal tower on top of [[Cannon Mountain (New Hampshire)|Cannon Mountain]] and came out near the [[Old Man of the Mountain]]. Betty testified that it was at least one and a half times the length of the granite cliff profile, which was {{convert|40|ft|m}} long, and that it seemed to be rotating. The couple watched as the silent, illuminated craft moved erratically and bounced back and forth in the night sky.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Stanton and Kathleen Marden. ''Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience'', 2007, pp. 103–04&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately one mile south of [[Franconia Notch|Indian Head]], they said, the object rapidly descended toward their vehicle, causing Barney to stop in the middle of the highway. The huge, silent craft hovered approximately {{convert|80–100|ft|m}} above the Hills' [[Chevrolet Bel Air|1957 Chevrolet Bel Air]] and filled the entire field of view in the windshield. It reminded Barney of a huge pancake. Carrying his pistol in his pocket, he stepped away from the vehicle and moved closer to the object. Using the binoculars, Barney claimed to have seen about 8 to 11 humanoid figures, who were peering out of the craft's windows, seeming to look at him. In unison, all but one figure moved to what appeared to be a panel on the rear wall of the hallway that encircled the front portion of the craft. The one remaining figure continued to look at Barney and communicated a message telling him to "stay where you are and keep looking." Barney had a recollection of observing the humanoid forms wearing glossy black uniforms and black caps. Red lights on what appeared to be bat-wing fins began to telescope out of the sides of the craft, and a long structure descended from the bottom of the craft. The silent craft approached to what Barney estimated was within {{convert|50–80|ft|m}} overhead and {{convert|300|ft|m}} away from him. On October 21, 1961, Barney reported to [[National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena]] (NICAP) investigator Walter Webb that the "beings were somehow not human".&lt;ref&gt;Webb, 1961, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barney "tore" the binoculars away from his eyes and ran back to his car. In a near hysterical state, he told Betty, "They're going to capture us!"&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Jerome. ''The UFO Book'', 1998, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the object again shift its location to directly above the vehicle. He drove away at high speed, telling Betty to look for the object. She rolled down the window and looked up. Almost immediately, the Hills heard a rhythmic series of beeping or buzzing sounds, which they said seemed to bounce off the trunk of their vehicle. The car vibrated and a tingling sensation passed through the Hills' bodies. The Hills said that then they experienced the onset of an altered state of consciousness that left their minds dulled. A second series of beeping or buzzing sounds returned the couple to full consciousness. They found that they had traveled nearly {{convert|35|mile|km}} south, but had only vague, spotty memories of this section of road. They recalled making a sudden, unplanned turn, encountering a roadblock, and observing a fiery orb in the road.

== Immediate aftermath ==
Arriving home at about dawn, the Hills assert that they had some odd sensations and impulses they could not readily explain: Betty insisted their luggage be kept near the back door rather than in the main part of the house. Their watches would never run again. Barney said that the leather strap for the binoculars was torn, though he could not recall it tearing. The toes of his best dress shoes were scraped. Barney says he was compelled to examine his genitals in the bathroom, though he found nothing unusual. They took long showers to remove possible contamination and each drew a picture of what they had observed.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman and Marden. ''Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience'', 2007, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perplexed, the Hills say they tried to reconstruct the chronology of events as they witnessed the UFO and drove home. But immediately after they heard the buzzing sounds, their memories became incomplete and fragmented.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Jerome. ''The UFO Book'', 1998, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; After sleeping for a few hours, Betty awoke and placed the shoes and clothing she had worn during the drive into her closet, observing that the dress was torn at the hem, zipper and lining. Later, when she retrieved the items from her closet, she noted a pinkish powder on her dress. She hung the dress on her clothesline and the pink powder blew away. But the dress was irreparably damaged. She threw it away, but then changed her mind, retrieving the dress and hanging it in her closet. Over the years, five laboratories have conducted chemical and forensic analyses on the dress.&lt;ref&gt;University of New Hampshire Archival Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

There were shiny, concentric circles on their car's trunk that had not been there the previous day. Betty and Barney experimented with a [[compass]], noting that when they moved it close to the spots, the needle would whirl rapidly. But when they moved it a few inches away from the shiny spots, it would drop down.&lt;ref&gt;See Friedman/Marden, 2007, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Initial report to the U.S. Air Force and NICAP ===
On September 21, Betty telephoned [[Pease Air National Guard Base|Pease Air Force Base]] to report their UFO encounter, though for fear of being labeled eccentric, she withheld some of the details. On September 22, Major Paul W. Henderson telephoned the Hills for a more detailed interview. Henderson's report, dated September 26, determined that the Hills had probably misidentified the planet Jupiter. (This was later changed to "optical condition", "inversion" and "insufficient data".) (Report 100-1-61, Air Intelligence Information Record) His report was forwarded to [[Project Blue Book]], the U.S. Air Force's UFO research project.

Within days of the encounter, Betty borrowed a UFO book from a local library. It had been written by retired Marine Corps Major [[Donald Keyhoe|Donald E. Keyhoe]], who was also the head of NICAP, a civilian UFO research group. On September 26, Betty wrote to Keyhoe. She related the full story, including the details about the humanoid figures that Barney had observed through binoculars. Betty wrote that she and Barney were considering hypnosis to help recall what had happened. Her letter was eventually passed on to Walter N. Webb, a Boston astronomer and NICAP member.

Webb met with the Hills on October 21, 1961. In a six-hour interview, the Hills related all they could remember of the UFO encounter. Barney asserted that he had developed a sort of "mental block" and that he suspected there were some portions of the event that he [[memory inhibition|did not wish to remember]]. He described in detail all that he could remember about the craft and the appearance of the "somehow not human" figures aboard the craft.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, 1961, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Webb stated that "they were telling the truth and the incident probably occurred exactly as reported except for some minor uncertainties and technicalities that must be tolerated in any such observations where human judgment is involved (e.g., exact time and length of visibility, apparent sizes of object and occupants, distance and height of object, etc.)."&lt;ref&gt;Webb, 1961, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Betty's dreams ==
Ten days after the alleged UFO encounter, Betty began having a series of vivid dreams. They continued for five successive nights. Never in her memory had she recalled dreams in such detail and intensity. But they stopped abruptly after five nights and never returned again. They occupied her thoughts during the day. When she finally did mention them to Barney, he was sympathetic, but not too concerned, and the matter was dropped. Betty did not mention them to Barney again.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, 1966, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1961, Betty began writing down the details of her dreams. In one dream, she and Barney encountered a roadblock and men who surrounded their car. She lost consciousness, but struggled to regain it. She then realized that she was being forced by two small men to walk in a forest in the nighttime, and of seeing Barney walking behind her, though when she called to him, he seemed to be in a trance or [[sleepwalking]]. The men stood about five feet to five feet four inches tall, and wore matching blue uniforms, with caps similar to those worn by military cadets. They appeared nearly human, with black hair, dark eyes, prominent noses and bluish lips. Their skin was a greyish colour.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman/Marden, 2007, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the dreams, Betty, Barney, and the men walked up a ramp into a disc-shaped craft of metallic appearance. Once inside, Barney and Betty were separated. She protested, and was told by a man she called "the leader" that if she and Barney were examined together, it would take much longer to conduct the exams. She and Barney were then taken to separate rooms.

Betty then dreamt that a new man, similar to the others, entered to conduct her exam with the leader. Betty called this new man "the examiner" and said he had a pleasant, calm manner. Though the leader and the examiner spoke to her in English, the examiner's command of the language seemed imperfect and she had difficulty understanding him.

The examiner told Betty that he would conduct a few tests to note the differences between humans and the craft's occupants. He seated her on a chair, and a bright light was shone on her. The man cut off a lock of Betty's hair. He examined her eyes, ears, mouth, teeth, throat and hands. He saved trimmings from her fingernails. After examining her legs and feet, the man then used a dull knife, similar to a letter opener, to scrape some of her skin onto what resembled [[cellophane]]. He then tested her nervous system and he thrust the needle into her navel, which caused Betty agonizing pain, whereupon the leader waved his hand in front of her eyes and the pain vanished.

The examiner left the room and Betty engaged in conversation with the "leader". She picked up a book with rows of strange symbols that the "leader" said she could take home with her. She also asked from where he came, and he pulled down an instructional map dotted with stars.

In Betty's dream account, the men began escorting the Hills from the ship when a disagreement broke out. The leader then informed Betty that she couldn't keep the book, stating that they had decided that the other men did not want her to even remember the encounter. Betty insisted that no matter what they did to her memory, she would one day recall the events.

She and Barney were taken to their car, where the leader suggested that they wait to watch the craft's departure. They did so, then resumed their drive.&lt;ref&gt;See Fuller, 1966, pp. 295–302 for a full account of Betty's dreams.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical help and more interviews ==

=== Missing time ===
On November 25, 1961, the Hills were again interviewed at length by NICAP members, this time C.&amp;nbsp;D. Jackson and Robert E. Hohmann.

Although the Hills had noted that they had arrived home later than anticipated, the drive should have taken about four hours (178 miles). They claimed not to have realized that they arrived home seven hours after their departure from [[Colebrook, New Hampshire|Colebrook]]. When Hohman and Jackson noted this discrepancy to the Hills, the couple had no explanation (a phenomenon [[Ufology|ufologists]] call "[[Alien abduction#Return|missing time]]"). The Hills claimed to recall almost nothing of the 35 miles between Lincoln/Indian Head and [[Ashland, New Hampshire|Ashland]]. Both claimed to recall an image of a fiery orb sitting on the ground. Betty and Barney reasoned that it must have been the moon, but Hohmann and Jackson informed them that the moon had set earlier in the evening.&lt;ref name="Clark, 1998, p. 282"&gt;Clark, 1998, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of [[hypnosis]] came up, and it was decided that it should be carried out in order to elicit previously irretrievable memories. Barney was apprehensive about hypnosis, but thought it might help Betty put to rest what Barney described as "the 'nonsense' about her dreams."&lt;ref name="Clark, 1998, p. 282" /&gt;

By February 1962, the Hills were making frequent weekend drives to the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]], hoping that revisiting the site might spark more memories. They were unsuccessful in trying to locate the site where they observed a fiery orb sitting in the road. However, they were able to eliminate several possible routes. (They found what they claimed was the "capture" site on [[Labor Day]] weekend in 1965.)

=== Private disclosure ===
On November 23, 1962, the Hills attended a meeting at the [[clergy house|parsonage]] of their church where the invited guest speaker was Captain [[Ben H. Swett]] of the [[United States Air Force]], who had recently published a book of his poetry. After he read selections of his poetry, the pastor asked him to discuss his personal interest in hypnosis. After the meeting broke up, the Hills approached Captain Swett privately and told him what they could remember of their strange encounter. He was particularly interested in the "missing time" of the Hills' account. The Hills asked Swett if he would hypnotize them to recover their memories, but Swett said he was not qualified to do that and cautioned them against going to an amateur hypnotist, such as himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://bswett.com/1963-09BettyAndBarney.html| title=Betty and Barney Hill| author=Ben H. Swett| work=bswett.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First public disclosure ===
{{unref|section|date=September 2018}}
On March 3, 1963, the Hills first publicly discussed the UFO encounter with a group at their church.

On September 7, 1963, Captain Swett gave a formal lecture on hypnosis to a meeting at the Unitarian Church. After the lecture, the Hills told him that Barney was going to a [[psychiatrist]], a Mr. Stephens, whom he liked and trusted. Captain Swett suggested that Barney ask Stephens about the use of hypnosis in his case.

When Barney next met with Stephens, he asked about hypnosis. Stephens referred the Hills to Benjamin Simon of [[Boston]].

On November 3, 1963, the Hills spoke before an amateur UFO study group, the Two State UFO Study Group, in [[Quincy Center]], [[Massachusetts]].

The Hills first met Simon on December 14, 1963. Early in their discussions, Simon determined that the UFO encounter was causing Barney far more worry and anxiety than he was willing to admit. Though Simon dismissed the popular [[extraterrestrial hypothesis]] as impossible, it seemed obvious to him that the Hills genuinely thought they had witnessed a UFO with human-like occupants. Simon hoped to uncover more about the experience through hypnosis.

== Simon's hypnosis sessions ==
Simon began hypnotizing the Hills on January 4, 1964. He hypnotized Betty and Barney several times each, and the sessions lasted until June 6, 1964. Simon conducted the sessions on Barney and Betty separately, so they could not overhear one another's recollections. At the end of each session he reinstated [[amnesia]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

=== Barney's sessions ===
Simon hypnotized Barney first. His recall of witnessing non-human figures was quite emotional, punctuated with expressions of fear, emotional outbursts and incredulity. Barney said that, due to his fear, he kept his eyes closed for much of the abduction and physical examination. Based on these early responses, Simon told Barney that he would not remember the hypnosis sessions until he was certain he could remember them without being further traumatized.

Under hypnosis (as was consistent with his conscious recall), Barney reported that the binocular strap had broken when he ran from the UFO back to his car. He recalled driving the car away from the UFO, but that afterwards he felt irresistibly compelled to pull off the road and drive into the woods. He eventually sighted six men standing in the dirt road. The car stalled and three of the men approached the car. They told Barney to not fear them. He was still anxious, however, and he reported that the leader told Barney to close his eyes. While hypnotized, Barney said, "I felt like the eyes had pushed into my eyes."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 1998, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barney described the beings as generally similar to Betty's hypnotic (not dream) recollection. The beings often stared into his eyes, said Barney, with a terrifying, mesmerizing effect. Under hypnosis, Barney said things like, "Oh, those eyes. They're there in my brain" (from his first hypnosis session) and "I was told to close my eyes because I saw two eyes coming close to mine, and I felt like the eyes had pushed into my eyes" (from his second hypnosis session) and "All I see are these eyes... I'm not even afraid that they're not connected to a body. They're just there. They're just up close to me, pressing against my eyes."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 1998, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

Barney related that he and Betty were taken onto the disc-shaped craft, where they were separated. He was escorted to a room by three of the men and told to lie on a small rectangular exam table. Unlike Betty, Barney's narrative of the exam was less detailed, as he continued to keep his eyes closed for most of the exam. A cup-like device was placed over his genitals. He did not experience an [[orgasm]], though Barney thought that a [[semen|sperm]] sample had been taken. The men scraped his skin and peered in his ears and mouth. A thin tube or cylinder was inserted into his [[anus]] and quickly removed. Someone felt his spine and seemed to be counting his [[vertebra]]e.

Betty reported a conversation with the "leader" that she understood in English. Barney said that he heard them speaking in a mumbling language he did not understand, yet he also understood them in English. Betty also mentioned this detail. The few times they communicated with him, Barney said it seemed to be "thought transference"; at that time, he was unfamiliar with the word "[[telepathy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 1998, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Betty and Barney stated that they hadn't observed the beings' mouths moving when they communicated in English with them.

He recalled being escorted from the ship and taken to his car. In a daze, he watched the ship leave. Barney remembered a light appearing on the road, and he said, "Oh no, not again." He recalled Betty's speculation that the light might have been the moon, though the moon had in fact set several hours earlier. He also stated that he attempted to produce the code-like buzzing sounds which seemed to strike the car's trunk a second time by driving from side to side and stopping and starting the vehicle. His attempt was unsuccessful.

=== Betty's sessions ===
Under hypnosis, Betty's account was similar to the events of her five dreams about the UFO abduction, but there were also notable differences, mainly pertaining to her capture and release. The technology on the craft was different. The short men had a significantly different physical appearance from that of her dreams. The sequential order of the abduction event was also different from Betty's dream account.  Barney's and Betty's memories in [[hypnotic regression]] were consistent with one another but contradicted some of the information in Betty's dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman/Marden, 2007, 119–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Betty exhibited considerable emotional distress during her capture and examination. Simon ended one session early because tears were flowing down her cheeks and she appeared distressed.

Simon gave Betty the post-hypnotic suggestion that she could sketch a copy of the "star map" that she later described as a three-dimensional projection similar to a [[Holography|hologram]]. Eventually, she did what Simon suggested.  Although she said the map had many stars, she drew only those that stood out in her memory. Her map consisted of twelve prominent stars connected by lines and three lesser ones that formed a distinctive triangle ([[#Analyzing the star map|see below]]). She said she was told the stars connected by solid lines formed "trade routes", whereas dashed lines were to less-traveled stars.

=== Simon's conclusions ===
After the hypnosis sessions, Simon speculated that Barney's recollection of the UFO encounter was possibly a fantasy inspired by Betty's dreams. Simon thought it was the most reasonable and consistent explanation. Barney rejected this idea, noting that while their memories were consistent in some regards, there were also portions of both their narratives that were unique to each. Barney was now ready to accept that they had been abducted by the occupants of a UFO, though he never embraced it as fully as Betty did.

Though the Hills and Simon disagreed about the nature of the case, they all concurred that the hypnosis sessions were effective: the Hills were no longer tormented by anxiety about their experience.

Afterwards, Simon wrote an article about the Hills for the journal ''Psychiatric Opinion'', explaining his conclusions that the case was a singular psychological aberration.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Simon, "Hypnosis in the Treatment of Military Neurosis" (''Psychiatric Opinion'', Volume 4, Number 5, pp. 24–28, October 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publicity after the hypnosis sessions ==
The Hills went back to their regular lives. They were willing to discuss the alleged UFO encounter with friends, family and the occasional UFO researcher, but the Hills apparently made no effort to seek publicity.

On October 25, 1965, a [[wikt:front page|front page]] story in the ''[[Boston Evening Traveller|Boston Traveller]]'' asked "UFO Chiller: Did THEY Seize Couple?"&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 1998, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; Reporter John H. Luttrell of the ''Traveler'' had allegedly been given an [[Tape recorder|audio tape]] recording of the lecture the Hills had made in Quincy Center in late 1963. Luttrell learned that the Hills had undergone hypnosis with Simon; he also obtained notes from confidential interviews the Hills had given to UFO investigators. On October 26, [[United Press International]] (UPI) picked up Luttrell's story, and the Hills earned international attention.

In 1966, writer [[John G. Fuller]] secured the cooperation of the Hills and Simon and wrote the book ''The Interrupted Journey'' (see below) about the case. The book included a copy of Betty's sketch of the "star map". The book was a quick success, and went through several printings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Testament for Believers |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,828455,00.html |quote=On the night of Sept. 19, 1961, Barney Hill and his wife Betty were driving home to Portsmouth, N.H., after a holiday in Montreal. A brilliant waxing moon sailed through a cloudless and star-fretted sky. As the Hills watched, first idly and then in terrified astonishment, one of the stars detached itself from the firmament and came down to earth—so near that the Hills could see it was no star. |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 18, 1966 |access-date=July 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in life, Betty claimed to have seen UFOs a number of times after the initial abduction, and she "became a celebrity in the UFO community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.beyondtopsecret.com/alienAbductionHills.html| title=beyondtopsecret.com| work=beyondtopsecret.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barney died of a [[Intracerebral hemorrhage|cerebral hemorrhage]] on February 25, 1969, at age 46; Betty Hill died of cancer on October 17, 2004, at age 85, never having remarried.

== Analyzing the star map ==&lt;!-- [[Betty Hill star map]] links here --&gt;
[[File:Zeta reticuli.svg|thumb|right|Marjorie Fish's interpretation of Betty Hill's purported alien star map, with "Sol" (upper right) being the [[Latin]] name for the Sun.]]

In 1968, Marjorie Fish of [[Oak Harbor, Ohio]], read Fuller's ''Interrupted Journey''. She was an [[elementary school]] teacher and amateur [[astronomer]]. Intrigued by the "star map", Fish wondered if it might be "deciphered" to determine which [[star system]] the UFO came from. Assuming that one of the fifteen stars on the map must represent the Earth's Sun, Fish constructed a three-dimensional model of nearby Sun-like stars using thread and beads, basing stellar distances on those published in the 1969 [[Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars|Gliese Star Catalogue]]. Studying thousands of vantage points over several years, the only one that seemed to match the Hill map was from the viewpoint of the [[double star]] system of [[Zeta Reticuli]].

Fish sent her analysis to Webb. Agreeing with her conclusions, Webb sent the map to [[Terence Dickinson]], editor of the popular magazine ''[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]]''. Dickinson did not endorse Fish and Webb's conclusions, but for the first time in the journal's history, ''Astronomy'' invited comments and debate on a UFO report, starting with an opening article in the December 1974 issue. For about a year afterward, the opinions page of ''Astronomy'' carried arguments for and against Fish's star map. Notable was an argument made by [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Steven Soter]],&lt;ref&gt;see Clark, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that the seeming "star map" was little more than a [[Randomness|random]] alignment of chance points. In an episode of [[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|''Cosmos'']] in 1980, Sagan demonstrated that without the lines drawn in the maps, the Hill map bore no resemblance to the real-life map. In contrast, those more favorable to the map, such as David Saunders, a statistician who had been on the [[Condon Committee|Condon UFO study]], argued that unusual alignment of key Sun-like stars in a plane centered around Zeta Reticuli (first described by Fish) was statistically improbable to have happened by chance from a random group of stars in our immediate neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nicap.org/articles/hillzeta.htm| title=The Zeta Reticuli Incident| work=nicap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gravitywarpdrive.com/Zeta_Reticuli_Incident.htm#Zeta%20Reticuli%20Incident| title=Zeta Reticuli Incident| work=gravitywarpdrive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Interrupted Journey'' ==
The 1966 publication of ''Interrupted Journey'', by John G. Fuller, details much of the Hills' claims. Excerpts of the book were published in ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine, and ''Interrupted Journey'' went on to sell many copies and greatly publicize the Hills' account. Betty's niece Kathleen Marden explored Fuller's themes along with scientist [[Stanton T. Friedman]] in her book ''Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience''. Marden knew Betty well and had spoken with her at great length about the encounter.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} She also examined all of the historical records and scientific reports pertaining to the case and transcribed the Hills' hypnosis sessions with Benjamin Simon for her detailed comparative analysis.

== Refutations ==
Psychiatrists later suggested that the supposed abduction was a [[hallucination]] brought on by the stress of being an interracial couple in early 1960s United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ufocasebook.com/Hill.html| title=The Betty and Barney Hill Abduction, Part 1-UFO Casebook Files| author=B. J. Booth| work=ufocasebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betty discounted this suggestion, noting her relationship with Barney was happy, and their interracial marriage caused no notable problems with their friends or family. As noted in ''The Interrupted Journey'', Simon thought that the Hills' marital status had nothing to do with the UFO encounter.

Skeptic blogger [[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]] noted that the hypnosis sessions occurred over two years after the reported abductions, which afforded the couple plenty of time to discuss their encounter.  Dunning concluded that the Hills' "inventive tale from the mind of a lifelong UFO fanatic&amp;nbsp;... is unsupported by any useful evidence, and is perfectly consistent with the purely natural explanation." He added that a timeline analysis of the two Air Force radar sightings from that night in the Project Blue Book record shows that neither correlated with the Hills' story. The Air Force concluded that both targets were probably [[weather balloon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4124|number=124|title=Barney and Betty Hill: The Original UFO Abduction|access-date= May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bellero.png|right|thumb|250|An alien (played by actor [[John Hoyt]]) depicted on television twelve days before the making of Hill's "Grey" hypnosis tape]]

In his 1990 article "Entirely Unpredisposed", Martin Kottmeyer suggested that Barney's memories revealed under hypnosis might have been influenced by an episode of the [[science fiction]] television show ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', titled "[[The Bellero Shield]]", which was broadcast about two weeks before Barney's first hypnotic session. The episode featured an extraterrestrial with large eyes who says, "In all the universes, in all the unities beyond the universes, all who have eyes have eyes that speak." The report from the regression featured a scenario that was in some respects similar to the television show. In part, Kottmeyer wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.debunker.com/texts/unpredis.html| title=Entirely Unpredisposed| publisher=www.debunker.com| access-date=September 19, 2008| last=Kottmeyer| first=Martin}} (originally published in ''Magonia'' magazine, January 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wraparound eyes are an extreme rarity in science fiction films. I know of only one instance. They appeared on the alien of an episode of an old TV series ''The Outer Limits'' entitled "The Bellero Shield". A person familiar with Barney's sketch in "The Interrupted Journey" and the sketch done in collaboration with the artist David Baker will find a "frisson" of "[[déjà vu]]" creeping up his spine when seeing this episode. The resemblance is much abetted by an absence of ears, hair, and nose on both aliens. Could it be by chance? Consider this: Barney first described and drew the wraparound eyes during the hypnosis session dated 22 February 1964. "The Bellero Shield" was first broadcast on 10 February 1964. Only twelve days separate the two instances. If the identification is admitted, the commonness of wraparound eyes in the abduction literature falls to cultural forces.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When a different researcher asked Betty about ''The Outer Limits'', she insisted she had "never heard of it".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 1998, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Kottmeyer also pointed out that some motifs in the Hills' account were present in the 1953 film, ''[[Invaders from Mars (1953 film)|Invaders from Mars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Carl | last = Sagan | authorlink=Carl Sagan | title = [[The Demon-Haunted World]]: Science As a Candle in the Dark | place = | publisher = [[Ballantine Books]] | series =  | volume = | edition =  | date = March 1997 | page = 102 | isbn = 0-345-40946-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A careful analysis of Barney's description of the non-human entities that he observed reveals significant similarities between the "Bifrost Man" and Barney's descriptive details. One must also take into account Barney's conscious, continuous recall of the entities he observed on the hovering craft. They were dressed in black, shiny uniforms and were "somehow not human".

[[James D. Macdonald|Jim Macdonald]], a resident of the area in which the Hills claimed to have been abducted, has produced a detailed analysis of their journey which concludes that the episode was provoked by their misperceiving an aircraft warning beacon on [[Cannon Mountain (New Hampshire)|Cannon Mountain]] as a UFO.&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;Macdonald, J. ''[http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/009378.html Making Light: Alien Abduction]'', accessed 15-05-09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jordan&gt;Jordan, C. ''[http://www.colebrookchronicle.com/Sept23.pdf Colebrook Chronicle: Betty and Barney Hill's Epic UFO N.H. Adventure Began in Colebrook]'', accessed 24-09-11&lt;/ref&gt; Macdonald notes that from the road the Hills took, the beacon appears and disappears at exactly the same time the Hills describe the UFO as appearing and disappearing. The remainder of the experience is ascribed to stress, [[sleep deprivation]], and false memories "recovered" under hypnosis. UFO expert [[Robert Sheaffer]] writes after reading Macdonald's recreation that the Hills are the "poster children" for not driving when sleep deprived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://badufos.blogspot.com/2011/10/mr-and-mrs-hills-wild-ride.html| title=Mr. (and Mrs.) Hills' Wild Ride |author=[[Robert Sheaffer]] |publisher= Bad UFOs|date=October 25, 2011 |access-date=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macdonald's article focuses primarily on the Hills' observations of the light in the sky and the timing of the journey, discounting the Hills' accounts of close encounters south of Cannon Mountain as [[Recovered-memory therapy|recovered memories]].

''Skeptical Inquirer'' columnist Robert Shaeffer wrote the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I was present at the National UFO Conference in New York City in 1980, at which Betty presented some of the UFO photos she had taken. She showed what must have been well over two hundred slides, mostly of blips, blurs, and blobs against a dark background. These were supposed to be UFOs coming in close, chasing her car, landing, etc... After her talk had exceeded about twice its allotted time, Betty was literally jeered off the stage by what had been at first a very sympathetic audience. This incident, witnessed by many of UFOlogy's leaders and top activists, removed any lingering doubts about Betty's credibility—she had none. In 1995, Betty Hill wrote a self-published book, ''A Common Sense Approach to UFOs''. It is filled with obviously delusional stories, such as seeing entire squadrons of UFOs in flight and a truck levitating above the freeway.&lt;ref&gt;Sheaffer, R. ''The UFO Verdict: Examining the Evidence.''  Prometheus Books, 1986, pp. 34–44.  {{ISBN|0879751460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sheaffer later wrote that as late as 1977, Betty Hill would go on UFO vigils at least three times a week. During one evening she was joined by UFO enthusiast John Oswald. When asked about Betty's continuing UFO observations, Oswald stated, "She is not really seeing UFOs, but she is calling them that." On the night they went out together, "Mrs. Hill was unable to distinguish between a landed UFO and a streetlight". In a later interview, Sheaffer recounts that Betty Hill writes "UFOs are a ''new'' science&amp;nbsp;... and ''our'' science cannot explain them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

By 1964, Johnson had founded "Celestron Pacific" as a division of Valor Electronics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philharrington.net/old60.htm |title=Nights of Future Passed - Celestron Pacific |publisher=philharrington.net }}&lt;/ref&gt; offering [[Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope]]s from 4" to 22". In 1970 Celestron introduced its "C8" 8" diameter 2032&amp;nbsp;mm focal length, ƒ10 telescope, the first of a new line of telescopes built using methods developed by Celestron to produce Schmidt-Cassegrains at a high volume and low cost.&lt;ref name=ut/&gt; These models made significant inroads into the [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomical]] and educational communities.

Johnson, the founder of the company, sold Celestron in 1980.&lt;ref name=astronomy/&gt; Celestron was acquired by [[Tasco]] in 1997 and almost went out of business when Tasco folded in 2001.

In early 2002 Celestron's rival, [[Meade Instruments]], attempted a takeover but a bankruptcy court allowed the sale of the company back to its original owners. The [[company (law)|company]] had been [[United States|U.S.]] owned until April 2005 when it was acquired by SW Technology Corporation, a [[Delaware]] company and affiliate of [[Synta Technology Corporation of Taiwan]]. Synta is a manufacturer of astronomy equipment and related components and at that time had been a supplier for Celestron  for over 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/celestron-purchased-by-sw-technology-corporation-a-delaware-company-affiliate-of-synta-technology-corporation-54201487.html prnewswire.com, Celestron Purchased by SW Technology Corporation, a Delaware Company, Affiliate of Synta Technology Corporation - TORRANCE, Calif., April 6 /PRNewswire]&lt;/ref&gt;

Celestron was the first large scale commercial manufacturer of the [[Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope]], introducing its "C8" 8" diameter 2032&amp;nbsp;mm focal length, ƒ10 telescope in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hzpoQRh9QEQC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=first+celestron+c8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FQxzT4qHKKrj0QH1zvCfAQ&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20celestron%20c8&amp;f=false James Mullaney, A buyer's and user's guide to astronomical telescopes &amp; binoculars, page 51]&lt;/ref&gt; The primary innovation Celestron/Tom Johnson came up with was a way to produce [[Schmidt corrector plate]]s using a vacuum to pull the glass blanks into a pre-shaped curve mold called a "master block" during the polishing process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uncle-rods.blogspot.com/2010/02/down-with-love.html Rod Mollise, Down with Love, uncle-rods.blogspot.com, Sunday, February 21, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3837124.html METHOD FOR MAKING REPLICA CONTOUR BLOCK MASTERS FOR PRODUCING SCHMIDT CORRECTOR PLATES, United States Patent 3837124]&lt;/ref&gt;   This allowed for the inexpensive mass production of corrector plates of uniform shape. The telescope line had a trademark matte orange tube (changed to glossy black in 1980, and back to semi-gloss orange in 2006), and double-fork [[equatorial mount]], and became a popular large aperture, compact design.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Other telescopes product lines include the CGE, CGEM, CPC, NexStar, Omni, Onyx, AstroMaster, Ambassador, TravelScope, and PowerSeeker product lines. These range from large computerized reflectors with GPS to decorative/casual viewing telescopes with brass tube refractors on wood mounts.

Celestron products (as of 2010) include:
* 5", 6", 8", 9.25", 11", and 14" Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes (the number denoting the [[aperture]]) on [[German equatorial mount]]s (all) or fork mounts (C8, C9.25, C11), with most benefiting from [[GoTo (telescopes)|GoTo]] control.
* A range of 8", 9.25", 11", and 14" modified Schmidt-Cassegrains with a more advanced optical design
* A range of 2.4 to {{convert|6|in|mm|sing=on}} [[refractor]] telescopes.
* 6 to {{convert|10|in|mm|sing=on}} traditional [[Newtonian reflector|reflector]] telescopes on German equatorial mounts.
* [[SkyScout]] - an astronomical sky finder or a personal planetarium.
* Digital, Biological, and Stereo viewing microscopes
* Binoculars and Spotting scopes
* Various mounts
* Numerous [[eyepiece]] lines, including both simple Plossl and complex wide-field designs such as the X-Cel and Luminos eyepiece lines.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}

Celestron telescopes offer the option to use computerized location of astronomical objects as well as mounts that will aim themselves at any given object, a technology known as GoTo. Most of the computerized models can be connected to an external computer via an [[RS-232]] cable, allowing them to be controlled by a third-party astronomy program or connected to a [[GPS]] receiver. GPS receivers are useful for programming the telescope with its precise location and time, which aids the alignment process required for GoTo.

Some motorized telescopes sold during the mid 80s to early 90s, including the Celestron Compustar® which used a form of GoTo technology, were not programmed to allow for dates after 2000; making some Celestron products susceptible to the [[Y2K bug]]. However, a third party chip to update the computer is available for some products.

==Competition with Meade==
{{details|Meade Instruments}}

Since their founding in 1972, [[Meade Instruments]] has been one of Celestron's chief rivals. Design, sizing, introduction, and pricing of each company's products lines and models have been in response to their competition with each other.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} There has been litigation over infringement of patents between the two companies, one instance regarding [[GoTo (telescopes)|GoTo technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jul/09/business/fi-rup9.8 |title=Meade, Celestron Settle Patent Lawsuits |agency=Bloomberg |date=July 9, 2004|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2013, Sunny Optics Inc, a unit of the Chinese firm Ningbo Sunny Electronic Co Ltd, completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of Meade.

'''Charles Bradlaugh''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|æ|d|l|ɔː}}; 26 September 1833 – 30 January 1891) was an English political activist and [[atheism|atheist]]. He founded the [[National Secular Society]] in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secularism.org.uk/charlesbradlaugh.html|title=Charles Bradlaugh (1833–1891): Founder|accessdate=22 March 2008|publisher=National Secular Society|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416094558/http://www.secularism.org.uk/charlesbradlaugh.html|archivedate=16 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, Bradlaugh was elected as the Liberal MP for [[Northampton (UK Parliament constituency)|Northampton]]. His attempt to affirm as an atheist ultimately led to his temporary imprisonment, fines for voting in the Commons illegally, and a number of by-elections at which Bradlaugh regained his seat on each occasion. He was finally allowed to take an oath in 1886. Eventually, a parliamentary bill which he proposed became law in 1888 which allowed members of both Houses of Parliament to affirm, if they so wished, when being sworn in. The new law resolved the issue for witnesses in civil and criminal court cases.

==Early life==
Born in [[Hoxton]] (an area in the [[East End of London]]), Bradlaugh was the son of a solicitor's clerk. He left school at the age of eleven and then worked as an office errand-boy and later as a clerk to a coal merchant. After a brief spell as a [[Sunday school]] teacher, he became disturbed by discrepancies between the [[Thirty-nine Articles]] of the Anglican Church and the Bible. When he expressed his concerns, the local vicar, John Graham Packer, accused him of [[atheism]] and suspended him from teaching.&lt;ref&gt;See Bradlaugh-Bonner (1908, p.8); Headlingly (1888, pp. 5–6); Tribe (1971, p.18)&lt;/ref&gt; He was thrown out of the family home and was taken in by [[Eliza Sharples]] Carlile, the widow of [[Richard Carlile]], who had been imprisoned for printing [[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[The Age of Reason]]''. Soon Bradlaugh was introduced to [[George Holyoake]], who organised Bradlaugh's first public lecture as an atheist.

At the age of 17, he published his first pamphlet, ''A Few Words on the Christian Creed''. However, refusing financial support from fellow [[Freethought|freethinkers]], he enlisted as a soldier with the [[7th Dragoon Guards|Seventh Dragoon Guards]] hoping to serve in [[India]] and make his fortune. Instead he was stationed in [[Dublin]]. In 1853, he was left a legacy by a great-aunt and used it to purchase his discharge from the army.

==Activism and journalism==
[[File:Bradlaugh 0001.jpg|thumb|left|140px]]
Bradlaugh returned to London in 1853 and took a post as a solicitor's clerk. By this time he was a convinced freethinker and in his free time he became a pamphleteer and writer about "secularist" ideas, adopting the pseudonym "[[iconoclasm|Iconoclast]]" to protect his employer's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3183 |title=Charles Bradlaugh |publisher=Oxforddnb.com |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gradually attained prominence in a number of liberal or radical political groups or societies, including the [[Reform League]], Land Law Reformers, and Secularists.

He was President of the London Secular Society from 1858. In 1860 he became editor of the secularist newspaper, the ''[[National Reformer]]'', and in 1866 co-founded the [[National Secular Society]], in which [[Annie Besant]] became his close associate. In 1868, the ''Reformer'' was prosecuted by the British Government for [[blasphemy]] and [[sedition]]. Bradlaugh was eventually acquitted on all charges, but fierce controversy continued both in the courts and in the press.

A decade later (1876), Bradlaugh and Besant decided to republish the American [[Charles Knowlton]]'s pamphlet advocating birth control, ''The Fruits of Philosophy, or the Private Companion of Young Married People'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Knowlton | first = Charles | editor-last1 = Besant | editor-first1 = Annie | editor-last2 = Bradlaugh| editor-first2 = Charles | author-link = Charles Knowlton | editor-link1 = Annie Besant | editor-link2 = Charles Bradlaugh | title = Fruits of philosophy: a treatise on the population question | publisher = Reader's Library | location = San Francisco | date = October 1891 | origyear = 1840 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38185/38185-h/38185-h.htm | oclc = 626706770}} [https://archive.org/details/fruitsphilosoph00knogoog View original copy.]

The two activists were both tried in 1877, and [[Charles Darwin]] refused to give evidence in their defence, pleading ill-health, but at the time writing to Bradlaugh that his testimony would have been of little use to them because he opposed birth control. They were sentenced to heavy fines and six months' imprisonment, but their conviction was overturned by the Court of Appeal on the basis that the prosecution had not set out the precise words which were alleged to be obscene in the indictment. The [[Malthusian League]] was founded as a result of the trial to promote birth control. He was a member of a Masonic lodge in [[Bolton]], although he was later to resign due to the nomination of the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] as Grand Master.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/bradlaugh_c/bradlaugh_c.html |title=Charles Bradlaugh |website=Freemasonry.bcy.ca |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 March 1881 he spoke at the opening of [[Leicester Secular Society]]'s new [[Leicester Secular Hall|Secular Hall]] in Humberstone Gate, Leicester. The other speakers were [[George Jacob Holyoake]], [[Annie Besant]] and [[Harriet Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leicestersecularsociety.org.uk/history_gimson.htm#%281%29|title=Random Recollections of Leicester Secular Society|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Bradlaugh was an advocate of trade unionism, [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republicanism]], and [[universal suffrage]], and he opposed socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Theresa Notare, ''A Revolution in Christian Morals: Lambeth 1930-Resolution #15. History and Reception'' (ProQuest, 2008), 188.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[anti-socialism]] was divisive, and many secularists who became socialists left the secularist movement because of its identification with Bradlaugh's [[Classical liberalism|liberal]] [[individualism]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} He was a supporter of [[Irish Home Rule]], and backed France during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. He took a strong interest in [[British Raj|India]].

==Parliament==
[[File:Brandlaugh-arrested.png|right|thumb|Bradlaugh's arrest in Parliament|200px]]
In 1880 Bradlaugh was elected Member of Parliament for [[Northampton (UK Parliament constituency)|Northampton]]. To take his seat and become an active Parliamentarian, he needed to signify his allegiance to the Crown and on 3 May Bradlaugh came to the Table of the House of Commons, bearing a letter to the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker]] "begging respectfully to claim to be allowed to [[Affirmation in law|affirm]]" instead of taking the religious [[Oath of Allegiance (UK)|Oath of Allegiance]], citing the Evidence Amendment Acts of 1869 and 1870. Speaker [[Henry Brand, 1st Viscount Hampden|Brand]] declared that he had "grave doubts" and asked the House for its judgment. [[Lord Frederick Cavendish]], for the Government, moved that a Select Committee be set up to decide whether persons entitled to make a solemn affirmation in court were also allowed to affirm instead of taking the Parliamentary oath.&lt;ref&gt;Arnstein, p. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1880/may/03/parliamentary-oath-mr-bradlaugh&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Select Committee===
[[File:charles bradlaugh cartoon.png|thumb|left|Caricature from ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', 1881 – "Mr. Bradlaugh, M.P., The Northampton Cherub"]]
This Select Committee held only one brief meeting on 12 May 1880. The [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], Sir [[Henry James, 1st Baron James of Hereford|Henry James]], moved that anyone entitled to affirm to give evidence in court was also entitled to affirm instead of taking the Oath in Parliament. Sir [[John Holker]], Conservative MP for [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]], moved an amendment to reverse this finding, and the committee split down the middle with eight members (seven Conservatives and [[Charles Henry Hopwood]], Liberal MP for [[Stockport (UK Parliament constituency)|Stockport]]) supporting the amendment and eight (all Liberals) opposing it; on the casting vote of the chairman [[Spencer Horatio Walpole]] the amendment was carried.&lt;ref&gt;Arnstein, p. 38; "Report from the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Oath" HCP 159 (1880).&lt;/ref&gt; Bradlaugh was not surprised that the Committee had gone against him, and notified the Speaker that he would attend to take the Oath on 21 May.

===Attempts to take the Oath===
To explain his actions, Bradlaugh wrote an open letter to ''[[The Times]]'' which was published on the morning of 21 May. He said it would have been hypocritical to voluntarily take the oath "including words of idle and meaningless character" without protest when another form of words was available, but now that the Select Committee had ruled he must, he would do so and "regard myself as bound not by the letter of its words, but by the spirit which the affirmation would have conveyed had I been permitted to use it."

Bradlaugh's letter was regarded as a direct provocation by his opponents, and when he came to the table, Sir [[Henry Drummond Wolff]] rose to object to the administration of the Oath to Bradlaugh. Speaker Brand allowed him to object, and Wolff argued that the Evidence Amendment Acts referred to by Bradlaugh only allowed an affirmation to one who regarded the oath as meaningless, so the House should not allow Bradlaugh to take it. Prime Minister [[William Gladstone]], alerted to the fact that a protest was possible, moved to set up a second Select Committee to examine whether it was possible to interfere with a Member wishing to take the oath. Gladstone's amendment was carried by 289 to 214.&lt;ref&gt;Arnstein, p. 40-51; ''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1880/may/21/parliamentary-oath-me-bradlaugh Hansard]'' 3ser vol 252 cols 187–221, [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1880/may/24/adjourned-debate 333–422].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Select Committee===
[[File:Charles Bradlaugh, Vanity Fair, 1880-06-12.jpg|right|thumb|Bradlaugh by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 1887]]
The Select Committee began deliberating on 1 June 1880, when it considered a paper put in by Sir [[Erskine May, 1st Baron Farnborough|Thomas Erskine May]], the Clerk of the House. Sir Thomas found several precedents for Members disabled to sit for refusing to take the Oath, together with Quaker MP [[Joseph Pease (railway pioneer)|Joseph Pease]] who was permitted to affirm, and Jewish MPs Baron [[Lionel de Rothschild]] and [[David Salomons]] who were eventually allowed to take the Oath while omitting the words "on the true faith of a Christian."&lt;ref&gt;"Report from the Select Committee on Parliamentary Oath (Mr. Bradlaugh)", HCP 226 (1880), Appendix No. 1 (pp. 25–33).&lt;/ref&gt;

On the following day, Erskine May and Bradlaugh himself were questioned by the Committee, with Bradlaugh arguing that, should the Committee decide he had no right to affirm, he would take the oath and regard it as binding on his conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Evidence, Q 85.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Committee decided its report, it agreed by one vote an amendment declaring that the House could "and, in the opinion of your Committee, ought to" prevent Bradlaugh taking the Oath.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Select Committee, p. xv–xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; It also added (by 12 votes to 9) that it would be possible for an action in the High Court of Justice to test whether an affirmation was genuinely legal, and therefore recommended that if Bradlaugh sought to affirm, he should be allowed to do so in order that such an action be brought to clarify the law.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Select Committee, p. xvii–xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; The second Select Committee had effectively reversed the outcome of the first.&lt;ref&gt;Arnstein, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

When it was known that this was the likely outcome of the Select Committee, Bradlaugh's fellow Northampton MP [[Henry Labouchère]] initiated a debate on a motion to allow Bradlaugh to affirm. Sir [[Hardinge Giffard]] moved an amendment that Bradlaugh be not permitted to take either the Oath or make an affirmation. After two days of debate,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1880/jun/21/mr-bradlattgh-resolution Hansard], 3ser, vol 253 cols 443–513, [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1880/jun/22/adjourned-debate 550–628].&lt;/ref&gt; Giffard's amendment was carried by 275 to 230, a defeat which surprised Gladstone. The majority comprised 210 Conservatives, 34 Liberals and 31 Irish Home Rulers; supporting Bradlaugh were 218 Liberals, 10 Home Rulers and 2 Conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;Arnstein, p. 73-4.&lt;/ref&gt; On the next day, Bradlaugh came to the Table claiming to take the Oath; in consequence of the previous night's vote the Speaker ordered him to withdraw.

Bradlaugh was permitted to address the House from behind the Bar (which was technically outside the Chamber), and treated the occasion as his [[maiden speech]]. He based his argument on law, contending that he was not legally disqualified, and asking "as one man against six hundred" for the same justice he would receive in the Courts. Although well received, the speech was too late to reverse the decision, and Henry Labouchère was forced to withdraw a motion to rescind it.&lt;ref&gt;Arnstein, pp. 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imprisonment===
{{Quote box|width=30em|fontsize = 90%|bgcolor = #F0F0F0|quote=The initial difficulty is in defining the word "God." It is equally impossible to intelligently affirm or deny any proposition unless there is at least an understanding, on the part of the affirmer or denier, of the meaning of every word used in the proposition. To me the word "God" standing alone is a word without meaning. . . . So long as the word "God" is undefined I do not deny "God."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;--Charles Bradlaugh&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/IsThereAGod |title=Is There a God? : Bradlaugh, Charles, 1833–1891 : Free Download &amp; Streaming |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Charles Bradlaugh MP, drawn by Walter Sickert.png|thumb|A cartoon of Charles Bradlaugh in 1890, drawn by artist [[Walter Sickert]]]]
At that point Bradlaugh was summoned back to the table to be told the outcome of the debate; having relayed it, the Speaker then ordered him to withdraw. Bradlaugh "respectfully refused" to obey an order of the House which was "against the law." The Conservative leader Sir [[Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh|Stafford Northcote]] successfully moved a motion that Bradlaugh be required to withdraw (agreed on a division by 326 to 38, Liberal MPs being unwilling to challenge a motion which sustained the House's legal authority) but Bradlaugh "positively refused to obey." The [[Serjeant-at-Arms]] was sent for and led Bradlaugh out to the Bar of the House, but Bradlaugh then immediately returned to the table claiming to take the Oath. At this Sir Stafford Northcote moved that Bradlaugh be taken into custody. The House agreed, on a division by 274 votes to 7 and Bradlaugh was taken to the small prison cell located under [[Big Ben]] in the Clock Tower.&lt;ref&gt;Arnstein, p. 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lord Randolph Churchill]] roused the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] by leading resistance to Bradlaugh.

Because Members had to take the oath before being allowed to take their seats, he effectively forfeited his seat in Parliament. His seat fell vacant and a by-election was declared. Bradlaugh was re-elected by Northampton four times in succession as the dispute continued. Supporting Bradlaugh were [[William Ewart Gladstone]], [[T. P. O'Connor]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]] as well as hundreds of thousands of people who signed a public petition. Opposing his right to sit were the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and other leading figures in the [[Church of England]] and Roman Catholic Church.

On at least one occasion, Bradlaugh was escorted from the House by police officers. In 1883 he took his seat and voted three times before being fined £1,500 for voting illegally. A bill allowing him to affirm was defeated in Parliament.

In 1886 Bradlaugh was finally allowed to take the oath, and did so at the risk of prosecution under the Parliamentary Oaths Act. Two years later, in 1888, he secured passage of a [[Oaths Act 1888|new Oaths Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leicestersecularsociety.org.uk/history_gimson.htm#%281%29 |title=Random Recollections of Leicester Secular Society |publisher=Leicestersecularsociety.org.uk |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which enshrined into law the right of affirmation for members of both Houses, as well as extending and clarifying the law as it related to witnesses in civil and criminal [[Trial (law)|trials]] (the Evidence Amendment Acts of 1869 and 1870 had proved unsatisfactory, though they had given relief to many who would otherwise have been disadvantaged). Bradlaugh spoke in Parliament about the [[London matchgirls strike of 1888]].

==Personal life==
His daughter, [[Hypatia Bradlaugh Bonner]] (1858–1935), was a peace activist, author, atheist and freethinker. She was named for [[Hypatia]], the Ancient Greek pagan philosopher, mathematician, astronomer and teacher, who was murdered by a mob of [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] monks devoted to the Christian archbishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

[[File:Photo of the Charles Bradlaugh Statue in Northampton, Abington Square.jpg|thumb|Photo of the Charles Bradlaugh Statue in Northampton, Abington Square with a large crowd.]]

In 1898, Bradlaugh's daughter Hypatia Bradlaugh Bonner wrote a pamphlet in answer to the question that was often addressed to her: whether her father "changed his opinions and became a Christian" before he died. Bonner laid out all the evidence and concluded that her father gave no indication that his opinions had changed in the "smallest" way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/didcharlesbradla45bonn#page/n0/mode/1up |title=Did Charles Bradlaugh die an atheist? |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration==
A statue of Bradlaugh is located on a traffic island at Abington Square, [[Northampton]]. The statue points west towards the centre of Northampton, the accusing finger periodically missing due to vandalism{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}. In 2014 the statue was cleaned and returned to the stonework. New signs are to be installed in 2015 on the roundabout reading "Charles Bradlaugh MP".

Since 2002, an "Annual Commemoration" has taken place beneath the statue at 3&amp;nbsp;pm on the Sunday closest to his birthday, organised by the Charles Bradlaugh Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://charlesbradlaughsociety.wordpress.com/about/|title=About the Charles Bradlaugh Society|work=Charles Bradlaugh Society|accessdate=23 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223160643/https://charlesbradlaughsociety.wordpress.com/about/|archivedate=23 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attendees are invited to speak about Charles Bradlaugh. 2014 saw the addition of the inaugural Bradlaugh Talk with speakers on issues relevant to Bradlaugh.

Bradlaugh Fields, a community wildlife park situated to the north of Northampton, was named after Charles Bradlaugh when it opened in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Bradlaugh Fields |url=http://www.bradlaughfieldsandbarn.co.uk/history-of-park.html |website=Bradlaugh Fields &amp; Barn |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924141730/http://www.bradlaughfieldsandbarn.co.uk/history-of-park.html |archivedate=24 September 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other landmarks bearing his name include ''The Charles Bradlaugh'' [[pub]], Charles Bradlaugh Hall at the [[University of Northampton]] and Bradlaugh Hall in Lahore, Pakistan.

==History==
Since the early Medieval period, many Armenians have lived as [[Armenian diaspora|diaspora]], due to foreign invasions of Armenia, national and religious persecution, genocide and wars. The formation of the present-day Armenian diaspora in the [[North Caucasus]] took place during the 17th and 18th centuries, although the first [[Hemshin peoples|Hemshin Armenians]] arrived during the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Fd43BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71|title=Ethnic Belonging, Gender, and Cultural Practices: Youth Identities in Contemporary Russia|last=Ulrike|first=|date=2014-04-15|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=|isbn=9783838261522|location=|pages=71|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The migrations of Armenians to the [[Kuban]] took place in a series of waves. The first took place from the late 1780s to the 1860s, when around 3,000 Armenians came to the region from the Russian towns of [[Astrakhan]], [[Kizlyar]] and [[Mozdok]], as well as around 300 [[Persian Armenians|Persian Turkish Armenians]]. During this period, the first Armenian settlements in the Kuban were founded, including Armavir, founded in 1839, considered to be the first. Armenian communities were also established in larger towns such as [[Novorossiysk]], [[Anapa]] and [[Ekaterinodar]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Fd43BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72|title=Ethnic Belonging, Gender, and Cultural Practices: Youth Identities in Contemporary Russia|last=Ulrike|first=|date=2014-04-15|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=|isbn=9783838261522|location=|pages=72|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second wave of migrants came during the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, when around 30,000 mostly Turkish Hemshin Armenians arrived in the region, along with a few from [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]] and [[Transcaucasia]]. During this period two different types of migrants can be identified: those who came for economic reasons who were attracted by Russian government and those who were forced to leave due to the oppression and [[Armenian Genocide|genocide by the Ottoman government]]. The peak of migration activity was reached at the end of the 1870s as a result of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]], in the 1890s when [[pogroms]] took place against Armenians in Turkey and [[Baku]] and from 1915 to 1920 when mass persecution of the Armenian population took place in Turkey.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The third wave of migration took place during the 1950s, when most Armenians settled in [[Anapsky District]], mainly in the settlement of [[Gaikodzor]]. These were migrants from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], so-called Akhalkalaki Armenians, named after the town of [[Akhalkalaki]] in southern Georgia, and comprised less than 300 people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The fourth wave took place in the 1970s mainly from two regions: those who came from [[Azerbaijan]], so-called [[Karabakh]] Armenians, and those from [[Central Asia]], such as [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbekistan]], [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]] and [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghizia]]. They primarily came to Krasnodar Krai for economic reasons and numbered from 5,000 to 7,000 people. From the end of the 1980s to the mid-1990s, more migrants (approximately 300,000) resettled in the Kuban region as a result of the ethnic conflicts across the Soviet Union, mainly from conflict areas such as Azerbaijan, Armenia and [[Fergana Valley]] (Uzbekistan and Kirghizia). After these conflicts, there were also migrants who came as a result of poor economic conditions in the newly formed republics, from Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and republics of Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Fd43BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73|title=Ethnic Belonging, Gender, and Cultural Practices: Youth Identities in Contemporary Russia|last=Ulrike|first=|date=2014-04-15|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=|isbn=9783838261522|location=|pages=73|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3680">The '''shooting of Christopher Penley''', a 15-year-old boy, occurred on January 13, 2006, at Milwee Middle School in [[Longwood, Florida]]. During class, Penley took out an [[Airsoft]] gun that was designed to look realistic. Penley ran from the room and eventually entered a restoom area.  [[SWAT]] officers arrived on the scene and tried to negotiate with him. Penley pointed the Airsoft gun at an officer, who responded by shooting Penley.

==Shooting==
He had briefly taken classmate Maurice Cotey hostage in a classroom and then later barricaded himself in an outdoor bathroom at Milwee Middle School in [[Longwood, Florida]], with an [[Airsoft]] gun painted entirely black to disguise it as a [[Beretta 92]]. After the weapon was discovered by Cotey, Penley forced him into the closet and shut off the lights in the classroom. The student immediately fled and informed security and later phoned police. [[SWAT]] arrived on the scene shortly thereafter, while a negotiator attempted to initiate contact with Penley. After a twenty-minute stand-off he aimed the pistol at Lieutenant Michael Weippert who responded by shooting him.

He was transported to Orlando Regional Medical Center where he remained on life support for two days before dying of his wounds. Several of his organs were removed and used as [[organ donation|transplants]]. [[Seminole County, Florida|Seminole County]] [[Sheriff]] Don Eslinger said the boy was suicidal and would not respond to negotiators who tried to talk him down in the bathroom.

Some students at the school told the media after the incident that they knew he had "something planned". Police have been criticized for initiating action instead of waiting for Penley's father to arrive so that his father might convince him to surrender. The ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' reported that Ralph Penley was not told of events until after his son was shot. The [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]] investigated the shooting and found it entirely justified, as Penley aimed a weapon at the deputy.

==Aftermath==
Penley's organs were [[organ donation|donated]] by his family. His death gave nine people vital organs. Christopher Penley has also had a game room at the Landmark Church dedicated to him and a Youth center. The youth center the Adolescent Life Coaching Center opened in honor of Christopher Penley's memory and to give a place for the voice of youth to be heard.

Penley's family filed a lawsuit against police; however, a judge dismissed the suit after determining that the shooting was justified.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2009-06-11/news/milwee_1_weippert-penley-seminole&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Codependency''' is a controversial concept&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lilienfeld |first1=Scott |title=The teaching of courses in the science and pseudoscience of psychology |journal=Teaching of Psychology |date=2001 |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=182-191}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a dysfunctional helping relationship where one person supports or [[Enabling|enables]] another person's [[addiction]], poor [[mental health]], immaturity, irresponsibility, or under-achievement.&lt;ref name="BPDFamily"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Johnson|first=R. Skip|title=Codependency and Codependent Relationships |url=http://bpdfamily.com/content/codependency-codependent-relationships|publisher=[[BPDFamily.com]]|date=13 July 2014|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the core characteristics of codependency, the most common theme is an excessive reliance on other people for approval and a sense of identity.&lt;ref name="BPDFamily"/&gt;
Given its [[grassroots]] origin, the precise definition of codependency varies based on the source but can be generally characterized as a subclinical and situational or episodic behavior similar to that of [[dependent personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="BPDFamily"/&gt; In its broadest definition, a codependent is someone who cannot function from his or her innate self and whose thinking and behavior is instead organized around another person, or even a process, or substance.&lt;ref name="dummies"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lancer|first1=Darlene|title=Codependency for Dummies|date=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=New Jersey|isbn=1118095227|page=30|edition=1st|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118095227}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, people who are addicted to a substance, like drugs, or a process, like gambling or sex, can also be considered codependent. In its most narrow definition, it requires one person to be physically or psychologically addicted, such as to [[heroin]], and the second person to be psychologically dependent on that behavior.&lt;ref name="Dictionary.reference.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/codependent |title=Codependent &amp;#124; Define Codependent at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some users of the codependency concept use the word as an alternative to using the concept of [[dysfunctional families]], without statements that classify it as a disease.&lt;ref name="Archive copy, July 24, 2008"&gt;[http://health.yahoo.com/relationships-resources/codependency-dysfunctional-families/healthwise--shc77.html Codependency / Dysfunctional Families] [https://web.archive.org/web/20080724053811/http://health.yahoo.com/relationships-resources/codependency-dysfunctional-families/healthwise--shc77.html Archive copy, July 24, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to [[disability studies]] specialist [[Lennard J. Davis]], historically, the concept of co-dependence "comes directly out of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], part of a dawning realization that the problem was not solely the addict, but also the family and friends who constitute a network for the alcoholic."&lt;ref name=Davis08&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Lennard J.|title=Obsession: A History|year=2008|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=London|isbn=0-226-13782-1|page=178|authorlink=Lennard J. Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "While not an actual diagnosis, the term “codependent” was first used to describe how family members of individuals with substance abuse issues might actually interfere with recovery by overhelping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriksen|first1=Ellen|title=Is Your Relationship Codependent? And What Exactly Does That Mean?|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-your-relationship-codependent-and-what-exactly-does-that-mean/|website=Scientific American|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was subsequently broadened to cover the way "that the codependent person is fixated on another person for approval, sustenance, and so on."&lt;ref name="Davis08"/&gt; The concept of codependency overlaps with, but developed in the mainstream independently from, the older [[psychoanalytic]] concept of the passive dependent personality which is attaching oneself to a stronger personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berne|first=Eric|title=A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis|year=1976|publisher=Penguin|isbn=0-345-30922-7|pages=64 and 241|authorlink=Eric Berne}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Dependency" is well-established in psychological literature. Whereas early on [[psychoanalytic theory]] emphasized the oral character and structural basis of dependency, [[social learning theory]] considered a tendency to be acquired by learning and experience, and [[Attachment Theory|ethological attachment theory]] posited that attachment or affectional bonding is the basis for dependency. All three theories have contributed to the concept of dependent personality disorder as defined by the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]. The definition and criteria have changed in the different versions of the DSM.  In DSM-I, passive dependency personality was characterized by helplessness, [[denial]], and indecisiveness, and was considered a subtype of passive aggressive personality. By DSM-IV, there were nine criteria with an essential feature of a pervasive or lifetime pattern of dependent and submissive behavior. The DSM-IV definition emphasized the excessive need to be taken care of,  leading to submissive and clinging behavior and fear of separation.&lt;ref name=sperry&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sperry, M.D., Ph.D|first1=Len|title=Handbook of Diagnosis and Treatment of DSM-IV Personality Disorders|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|location=Kentucky|isbn=9780415935692|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The codependency movement may have its roots in the theories of German psychoanalyst [[Karen Horney]]. In 1941, she proposed that some people adopt what she termed a "Moving Toward" personality style to overcome their basic anxiety. Essentially, these people move toward others by gaining their approval and affection, and subconsciously control them through their dependent style. They are unselfish, virtuous, martyr-like, faithful, and turn the other cheek despite personal humiliation. Approval from others is more important than respecting themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rotunda, Ph.D|first1=Robert J.|title=Codependency|url=http://uwf.edu/rrotunda/psych/pco4310/hands-on-codependent.html|publisher=University of West Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Anon]] was formed in 1951, 16 years after Alcoholics Anonymous was founded.&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://aa.org/aatimeline | title = AA Timeline | publisher = Alcoholics Anonymous | accessdate = 2014-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Anon holds the view that alcoholism is a family illness&lt;ref name="Al-Anon"&gt;{{ cite web | last = Al-Anon Family Groups | url = http://www.al-anon.alateen.org/about.html | title = Suggested Al-Anon Preamble to the Twelve Steps | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] | work = www.al-anon.alateen.org | accessdate = 2010-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the earliest recognitions of codependency.

The expansion of the meaning of codependency happened very publicly.&lt;ref name="Travis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Travis|first=Trish|title=The Language of the Heart, A Cultural History of the Recovery Movement from Alcoholics Anonymous to Oprah Winfrey|year=2009|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, N.C.|isbn=978-0-8078-3319-3|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet G. Woititz|Janet G. Woititz's]] ''Adult Children of Alcoholics'' had come out in 1983 and sold two million copies while being on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list for forty-eight weeks.&lt;ref name="Travis"/&gt; [[Robin Norwood]]'s ''[[Women Who Love Too Much]]'', 1985, sold two and a half million copies and spawned Twelve Step groups across the country for women "addicted" to men.&lt;ref name="Travis"/&gt; [[Melody Beattie]] popularized the concept of codependency in 1986 with the book ''[[Codependent No More]]'' which sold eight million copies.&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Rice, ''A Disease of One's Own'' (1998) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, [[Timmen L. Cermak|Timmen Cermak, M.D.]] wrote ''Diagnosing and Treating Co-Dependence: A Guide for Professionals''. In the book and an article published in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs (Volume 18, Issue 1, 1986), Cermak argued (unsuccessfully) for the inclusion of codependency as a separate [[personality disorder]] in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-III-R; American Psychiatric Association, 1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morgan Jr.|first1=JP|title=What is codependency?|journal=J Clin Psychol|date=1991 |volume=47|issue=5|pages=720–9|doi=10.1002/1097-4679(199109)47:5&lt;720::aid-jclp2270470515&gt;3.0.co;2-5|pmid=1939721}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cermak's book paved the way for a Twelve-step take-off program, called [[Co-Dependents Anonymous]].&lt;ref name="Irving 1999 30"&gt;{{cite book|last=Irving|first=Leslie|title=Codependent Forevermore, The Invention of Self in a Twelve Step Group|year=1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-38471-3|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Co-Dependents Anonymous meeting was held October 22, 1986.&lt;ref name="Irving 1999 30"/&gt;

Mainstream psychological scientists have questioned the validity of the codependency construct as a form of pseudoscientific "psychobabble" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tavris |first1=C. |title=Psychobabble and biobunk: Using psychology to think critically about issues in the news |date=1995 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and its scientific status remains uncertain.

==Symptoms and behaviors==
Codependency does not refer to all caring behavior or feelings, but only those that are excessive to an unhealthy degree.&lt;ref name="alcoholism"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moos|first=R.H.|title=Alcoholism Treatment: Context, Process and Outcome|year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-504362-6 |author2=Finney, J.W. |author3=Cronkite, R.C.}}{{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the distinctions is that healthy empathy and caregiving is motivated by conscious choice; whereas for codependents, their actions are compulsive, and they usually aren't able to weigh in the consequences of them or their own needs that they're sacrificing.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Some scholars and treatment providers feel that codependency is an overresponsibility and that overresponsibility needs to be understood as a positive impulse gone awry. Responsibility for relationships with others needs to coexist with responsibility to self.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=S.C.|title=A critical analysis of the concept of codependency|journal=Social Work|date=1994|volume=39|issue=6|pages=677–685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Codependency has been referred to as the disease of a lost self.&lt;ref name="dummies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitfield|first1=Charles|title=The Child Within|date=1987|publisher=Health Communications, Inc.|location=Florida|isbn=0932194400|page=28|edition=1st|url=https://www.amazon.com/Healing-Child-Within-Discovery-Dysfunctional/dp/0932194400}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Codependent relationships are marked by intimacy problems, dependency, control (including caretaking) denial, dysfunctional communication and [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]], and high reactivity. Often, there is imbalance, so one person is abusive or in control or supports or enables another person's addiction, poor mental health, immaturity, irresponsibility, or under-achievement.&lt;ref name="lancer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lancer|first1=Darlene|title=Conquering Shame and Codependency: 8 Steps to Freeing the True You|date=2014|publisher=Hazelden|location=Minnesota|isbn=978-1-61649-533-6|pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some codependents often find themselves in relationships where their primary role is that of rescuer, supporter, and confidante. These helper types are often dependent on the other person's poor functioning to satisfy their own emotional needs.&lt;ref name="BPDFamily"/&gt; Many codependents place a lower priority on their own needs, while being excessively preoccupied with the needs of others. Codependency can occur in any type of relationship, including family, work, friendship, and also romantic, peer or community relationships.&lt;ref name="patterns"&gt;[http://www.coda.org/tools4recovery/Patterns2-2011.htm Codependents Anonymous: Patterns and Characteristics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824075736/http://www.coda.org/tools4recovery/Patterns2-2011.htm |date=2013-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly cited symptoms of codependency are:&lt;ref name="BPDFamily"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://winning-teams.com/definitions.html Winning Teams: Definitions in Psychology], Dr. David Thomas PhD&lt;/ref&gt;
*intense and unstable interpersonal relationships
*inability to tolerate being alone, accompanied by frantic efforts to avoid being alone
*chronic feelings of [[boredom]] and [[emptiness]]
*subordinating one's own needs to those of the person with whom one is involved
*overwhelming desire for acceptance and affection
*[[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]]
*over-controlling
*external referencing
*dishonesty and denial
*[[psychological manipulation|manipulation]]
*lack of [[Trust (emotion)|trust]]
*low [[self-worth]].

==Patterns and characteristics==
Codependency can occur in any type of relationship, including family, work, friendship, and also romantic, peer or community relationships.&lt;ref name="patterns"/&gt;

===Enmeshed romantic relationship===
In a codependent relationship, the codependent's sense of purpose is based on making extreme sacrifices to satisfy their partner's needs. Codependent relationships signify a degree of unhealthy "clinginess", where one person does not have [[self-sufficiency]] or [[autonomy]]. One or both parties depend on their loved one for fulfillment.&lt;ref name=webmd&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wetzler, PhD|first1=Scott|title=Psychology division chief at Albert Einstein College of Medicine|url=http://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/features/signs-of-a-codependent-relationship|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly problematic pairings include:

:'''[[Personality disorder]] and codependent pairing''' 
:* '''[[Borderline personality disorder]]'''. There is a tendency for loved ones of people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) to slip into "caretaker" roles, giving priority and focus to problems in the life of the person with BPD rather than to issues in their own lives. Too often in these kinds of relationships, the codependent will gain a sense of worth by being "the sane one" or "the responsible one".&lt;ref name=Danielle&gt;{{cite web|last1=Danielle|first1=Alicia|title=Codependency and Borderline Personality Disorder: How to Spot It|url=http://www.borderlinepersonalitytreatment.com/codependency-and-borderline-personality-disorder-how-to-spot-it.html|publisher=Clearview Women's Center|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* '''[[Narcissistic personality disorder]]'''. Codependents of [[narcissists]] are sometimes called co-narcissists.&lt;ref name=co&gt;Rappoport, Alan, PhD. [http://www.alanrappoport.com/pdf/Co-Narcissism%20Article.pdf Co-Narcissism: How We Adapt to Narcissistic Parents. The Therapist, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt; Narcissists, with their ability to get others to "buy into their vision" and help them make it a reality, seek and attract partners who will put others' needs before their own.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Crompton, ''All About Me: Loving a Narcissist'' (London 2007) p. 157 and p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Codependents can provide the narcissist with an obedient and attentive audience — the perfect backdrop for a self-absorbed narcissist.&lt;ref&gt;Crompton, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Among the reciprocally interlocking interactions of the pair are the narcissist's overpowering need to feel important and special and the co-dependent person's strong need to help others feel that way.

:'''Codependent and/or impulse-disordered individuals and codependent pairing'''&lt;ref name="cermak"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cermak M.D.|first1=Timmen L.|title=Diagnostic Criteria for Codependency|journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs|date=1986|volume=18|issue=1|pages=15–20|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02791072.1986.10524475#preview|doi=10.1080/02791072.1986.10524475}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:* [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).
:* [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD)
:* Manic state of [[bipolar disorder]]
:* [[Autism Spectrum Disorder]] (ASD)

===Dysfunctional family===
In the [[dysfunctional family]] the child learns to become attuned to the parent's needs and feelings instead of the other way around.&lt;ref name="lancer"/&gt; Parenting is a role that requires a certain amount of self-sacrifice and giving a child's needs a high priority. A parent can, nevertheless, be codependent towards their own children if the caretaking or parental sacrifice reaches unhealthy or destructive levels.&lt;ref name="patterns"/&gt; Generally, a parent who takes care of their own needs (emotional and physical) in a healthy way will be a better caretaker, whereas a codependent parent may be less effective, or may even do harm to a child.&lt;ref name="patterns"/&gt; Codependent relationships often manifest through enabling behaviors, especially between parents and their children. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ambrosiatc.com/addiction/codependency/?ambTRK=PR |title=Are You Enabling? |publisher=Ambrosia Treatment Center |access-date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way to look at it is that the needs of an infant are necessary but temporary, whereas the needs of the codependent are constant. Children of codependent parents who ignore or negate their own feelings may become codependent.

==Recovery and prognosis==
Not all [[mental health]] professionals agree about standard methods of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1300/J023v03n03_05 |title=On Terms Used and Abused: The Concept of 'Codependency' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fjyJ3QWJgPQC&amp;pg=PA113 |year=1989 |last1=Gomberg |first1=Edith S Lisansky |editor1-first=Edith S |editor1-last=Gomberg |journal=Drugs &amp; Society |volume=3 |issue=3–4 |pages=113–32 |isbn=978-0-86656-965-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caring for an individual with a physical addiction is not necessarily treating a pathology. The caregiver may only require [[assertiveness]] skills and the ability to place responsibility for the addiction on the other.&lt;ref name="alcoholism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="affleck"/&gt; There are various [[Recovery model|recovery]] paths for individuals who struggle with codependency.  For example, some may choose cognitive-behavioral [[psychotherapy]], sometimes accompanied by chemical therapy for accompanying depression. There also exist support groups for codependency, such as [[Co-Dependents Anonymous]] (CoDA), [[Al-Anon/Alateen]], [[Nar-Anon]], and [[Adult Children of Alcoholics]] (ACoA), which are based on the [[twelve-step program]] model of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] and [[Celebrate Recovery]] a Christian, Bible-based group.&lt;ref name="COLLET1990"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collet |first=L |year=1990 |title=After the anger, what then? ACOA: Self-help or self-pity? |journal=Family Therapy Networker |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=22–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many self-help guides have been written on the subject of codependency.

Sometimes an individual can, in attempts to recover from codependency, go from being overly passive or overly giving to being overly [[aggressive]] or excessively [[selfish]].&lt;ref name="alcoholism"/&gt; Many therapists maintain that finding a balance through healthy [[assertiveness]] (which leaves room for being a caring person and also engaging in healthy caring behavior) is true recovery from codependency and that becoming extremely selfish, a [[bullying|bully]], or an otherwise conflict-addicted person is not.&lt;ref name="alcoholism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="affleck"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.55.1.29 |title=Causal attribution, perceived benefits, and morbidity after a heart attack: An 8-year study |year=1987 |last1=Affleck |first1=Glenn |last2=Tennen |first2=Howard |last3=Croog |first3=Sydney |last4=Levine |first4=Sol |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=55 |pages=29–35 |pmid=3571655 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing a permanent stance of being a victim (having a [[victim mentality]]) would also not constitute true recovery from codependency and could be another example of going from one extreme to another.&lt;ref name="alcoholism"/&gt; A victim mentality could also be seen as a part of one's original state of codependency (lack of empowerment causing one to feel like the "subject" of events rather than being an empowered actor).&lt;ref name="alcoholism"/&gt; Someone truly recovered from codependency would feel empowered and like an author of their life and actions rather than being at the mercy of outside forces.&lt;ref name="alcoholism"/&gt; A victim mentality may also occur in combination with [[passive–aggressive]] control issues.&lt;ref name="alcoholism"/&gt; From the perspective of moving beyond victim-hood, the capacity to forgive and let go (with exception of cases of very severe abuse) could also be signs of real recovery from codependency, but the willingness to endure further abuse would not.&lt;ref name="alcoholism"/&gt;

Unresolved patterns of codependency can lead to more serious problems like alcoholism, drug addiction, [[eating disorders]], [[sex addiction]], psychosomatic illnesses, and other [[self-destructive]] or [[self-defeating personality disorder|self-defeating behaviors]].&lt;ref name="cd"&gt;"Codependence", in: Benjamin J. Sadock &amp; Virginia A. Sadock (eds), Kaplan &amp; Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry on CD, Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 7th ed. 2000, {{ISBN|0-7817-2141-5}}, {{ISBN|2-07-032070-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; People with codependency are also more likely to attract further abuse from aggressive individuals, more likely to stay in stressful jobs or relationships, less likely to seek medical attention when needed and are also less likely to get promotions and tend to earn less money than those without codependency patterns.&lt;ref name="cd"/&gt; For some people, the social insecurity caused by codependency can progress into full-blown [[social anxiety]] disorders like [[Specific social phobia|social phobia]], [[avoidant personality disorder]] or painful [[shyness]].&lt;ref name="cd"/&gt; Other stress-related disorders like [[panic disorder]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] or [[PTSD]] may also be present.&lt;ref name="cd"/&gt;

==Failed proposal for inclusion in DSM==
[[Timmen L. Cermak, M.D.|Timmen Cermak, M.D.]], proposed that co‐dependency be listed as a [[personality disorder]] in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-III-R; American Psychiatric Association, 1987). Cermak reasoned that when specific personality traits become excessive and maladaptive and caused significant impairment in functioning or caused significant distress, it warrants a personality disorder diagnosis.&lt;ref name="cermak"/&gt;

Cermak proposed the following criteria for this disorder:&lt;ref name="cermak"/&gt; 
# Continued investment of [[self-esteem]] in the ability to control both oneself and others in the face of serious adverse consequences. 
# Assumption of responsibility for meeting others' needs to the exclusion of acknowledging one's own. 
# Anxiety and boundary distortions around intimacy and separation. 
# [[Enmeshment]] in relationships with personality disordered, chemically dependent, other co ‐ dependent, and/or impulse ‐ disordered individuals. 
# Three or more of the following:
## Excessive reliance on [[denial]] 
## Constriction of emotions (with or without dramatic outbursts)
## [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] 
## [[Hypervigilance]] 
## Compulsions
## [[Anxiety]] 
## [[Substance abuse]] 
## Has been (or is) the victim of recurrent physical or sexual abuse 
## Stress ‐ related medical illnesses 
## Has remained in a primary relationship with an active substance abuser for at least two years without seeking outside help.

==Controversies==
Some scholars believe that codependency is not a negative trait, and does not need to be treated, as it is more likely a healthy personality trait taken to excess. Codependency in nonclinical populations has some links with favourable characteristics of family functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1545-5300.1998.00513.x |title=Family of Origin and Current Relationship Influences on Codependency |year=1998 |last1=Prest |first1=Layne A. |last2=Benson |first2=Mark J. |last3=Protinsky |first3=Howard O. |journal=Family Process |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=513–28 |pmid=9934570}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Stan Katz]] states that codependence is over-diagnosed, and that many people who could be helped with shorter-term treatments instead become dependent on long-term self-help programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Stan|title=The Codependency Conspiracy: How to Break the Recovery Habit and Take Charge of Your Life,}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language of, symptoms of, and treatment for codependence derive from the [[medical model]] suggesting a [[disease]] process underlies the behavior. However, there is no evidence that codependence is caused by a disease process.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In their book, “Attached.”, Dr. [[Amir Levine]] and [[Rachel S. F. Heller]], address what they call the “codependency myth” by asserting that [[attachment theory]] is a more scientific and helpful model for understanding and dealing with [[attachment in adults]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Levine |first1=Amir |last2=Heller |first2=Rachael S. F. |year=2010 |title=Attached. |url=http://www.attachedthebook.com/ |location=New York, New York |publisher=Tarcher/Penguin |pages=56–61 |isbn=9781101475164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These books featured tight plotlines and riotous humor, touching at the same time some serious topics: ''The Great Dinosaur Robbery'' and ''Nephew'' deal with the Cold War, ''After Me, the Deluge'' with religion.

''After Me, the Deluge''  was interpreted into the lavish stage musical ''Aggiungi un Posto a Tavola'' by the Italian impresarios [[Pietro Garinei]], [[Sandro Giovannini]]  and Iaia Fiastri in 1974 and has been running in Italy for 42 years.  It is firmly entrenched as a family favourite and is reported to have been seen by more than 15-million people.

'''George Lanakilakekiahiali{{okina}}i Na{{okina}}ope''' (February 25, 1928 – October 26, 2009), born in [[Kalihi|Kalihi, Hawai{{okina}}i]] and raised in [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]],&lt;ref name="III2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harris M. Lentz III|title=Obituaries in the Performing Arts, 2009: Film, Television, Radio, Theatre, Dance, Music, Cartoons and Pop Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CH_GCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA384|date=17 May 2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5645-1|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a celebrated [[kumu hula]], master [[Music of Hawaii|Hawaiian chanter]], and leading advocate and preservationist of native [[Hawaiian culture]] worldwide. He taught hula dancing for over sixty years in [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]], [[Japan]], [[Guam]], [[Australia]], [[Germany]], [[England]], [[North America]], and [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://honoluluweekly.com/cover/story-continued/2007/03/the-merrie-master/ Honolulu Weekly Article August 29, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Na{{okina}}ope was a scholar of ancient hula, which is hula developed and danced before 1893. He first studied hula at the age of three years under his great-grandmother, Mary Malia Pukaokalani Na{{okina}}ope, who lived to be over 100 years old. At the age of four he began to study with Mary Kanaele, the mother and teacher of Edith Kanaka'ole. When he moved to [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]] at the age of ten, he studied for ten years with Joseph Ilala{{okina}}ole. After graduating from high school, Na{{okina}}ope moved to [[Honolulu]] where he opened the George Na{{okina}}ope Hula School, then later continued his studies under Kumu Hula Lokalia Montgomery and Tom Hiona.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kanehulafestival.com/Uncle%20George%20Pictures.htm Profile at the Kane Hula Festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905143456/http://www.kanehulafestival.com/Uncle%20George%20Pictures.htm |date=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Na{{okina}}ope began to teach hula at the age of thirteen. His family was poor, so he taught hula for fifty cents per week in order to continue to pay for school. He taught chant and kahiko to the Ray Kinney dancers, and traveled with [[Ray Kinney]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kalena.com/uncle_george.html Excerpt from the March 1996 Hula Mae'ole Seminar Brochure]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Na{{okina}}ope founded the [[Merrie Monarch Festival]],&lt;ref name="Lyons2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reneé Critcher Lyons|title=The Revival of Banned Dances: A Worldwide Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=msFUDqrOTNgC&amp;pg=PA36|date=26 January 2018|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-9041-7|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; an annual week-long festival of traditional Hawaiian arts, crafts, and performances featuring a three-day hula competition. The festival became both a popular success and an important part of the [[Hawaiian Renaissance]]. In an interview Na{{okina}}ope said of founding the festival, "I felt the hula was becoming too modern and that we have to preserve it. [[David Kalakaua]] [King of Hawaii, 1874–91; aka "The Merrie Monarch"] brought the hula back to [[Hawaii]] and made us realize how important it was for our people. There was nothing here in Hilo, so I decided to honor Kalakaua and have a festival with just hula. I didn't realize that it was going to turn out to be one of the biggest things in our state."

Na{{okina}}ope was honored with numerous other awards, including being named a [[Living Treasure of Hawai'i]] by the Buddhist temple [[Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawai'i]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Keepers of culture named  |work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/01/13/news/story09.html |date=January 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Treasure of Hawai{{okina}}i" by [[George W. Bush|President George W.

In 2007, Na{{okina}}ope founded the [[Halau Hula Is Hawai'i Trust]] and [[Hula Is Hawai'i, LLC]], and instructed his entire estate to be placed into his trust. Despite his [[Last Will and Testament]], certain individuals went against his wishes.

Na{{okina}}ope founded the ''Humu Mo{{okina}}olelo'', a quarterly journal of the hula arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digicoll.manoa.hawaii.edu/music/Pages/syllabus.php?route=courses.php&amp;course=38|title=Hawaiian Music Collection|last=|first=|date=|website=digicoll.manoa.hawaii.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329064219/https://digicoll.manoa.hawaii.edu/music/Pages/syllabus.php?route=courses.php&amp;course=38|archive-date=March 29, 2016|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giuseppe Bonavia''' (1821 – 2 September 1885) was a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] [[draftsman]] and [[architect]] who was mainly active in the second half of the 19th century. Born in [[Valletta]], he was initially a clerk of works with the [[Royal Engineers]], before becoming the Head of the Civil Service Works Department.&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiavone|first1=Michael J.|title=Dictionary of Maltese Biographies Vol. 1 A-F|date=2009|publisher=Pubblikazzjonijiet Indipendenza|location=[[Pietà, Malta|Pietà]]|isbn=9789993291329|pages=220–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonavia designed in a variety of styles, including [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] and [[Neoclassical architecture]].

'''Grant Naylor''' was the [[pseudonym|collective name]] used by writers [[Rob Grant]] and [[Doug Naylor]] for their collaborative work, including the television series ''[[Red Dwarf]]''. Grant and Naylor themselves called this pseudonym a "gestalt entity" (i.e. something which is greater than the sum of its parts).

The collaboration began in the mid-1980s when the duo co-wrote [[BBC Radio 4]] programmes such as ''Cliché'' and its sequel ''[[Son of Cliché]]'', and [[television programmes]] such as ''[[Spitting Image]]'', ''[[The 10 Percenters]]'', and various [[Jasper Carrott]] projects. The pair are also credited with writing the lyrics to "[[The Chicken Song]]" and a number of other musical parodies for the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[satire|satirical]] television show, ''Spitting Image''.

The "Grant Naylor" collaboration, as it had become known, created the cult science-fiction comedy series, ''Red Dwarf''. Later episodes of ''Red Dwarf'' were made by a company named after this pseudonym, '''Grant Naylor Productions'''.

In the mid-1990s, after the success of Series VI of ''Red Dwarf'', the "Grant Naylor" collaboration ended, leaving Naylor with all the writing duties for the show. When Doug Naylor was apparently left with control of ''Red Dwarf'', Rob Grant cited creative differences as the reason for his departure.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} His main reason however, he said, was that he "wished to have more on his 'tombstone' than ''Red Dwarf''."

Doug Naylor went on to write series seven to twelve of ''Red Dwarf'' by himself, sometimes in collaboration with other writers, particularly on series seven.

In 1999 and 2000, Rob Grant independently wrote two television series, ''[[Dark Ages (TV series)|Dark Ages]]'' and ''[[The Strangerers]]'', and script edited the series ''[[Stressed Eric]]''. In the past few years he has written four solo books and is rumoured to be working on an animated series entitled ''[[Cruel Aliens (TV series)|Cruel Aliens]]''.

Since the end of the eighth series of ''Red Dwarf'' in 1999, Grant Naylor Productions under Doug Naylor attempted to make a feature-length movie version of the show.&lt;ref name="The movie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thereddwarfzone.co.uk/movie.htm |title=Red Dwarf The movie |publisher=www.thereddwarfzone.co.uk |accessdate=2008-02-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204141520/http://www.thereddwarfzone.co.uk/movie.htm#filming |archivedate=2008-02-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it proved impossible to find sufficient funding. Instead, a new three-part TV miniseries, ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth]]'', was created and shown on channel [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] over the Easter weekend in April 2009. Since then Grant Naylor Productions have created a tenth series ''[[Red Dwarf X]]'', broadcast in 2012. Red Dwarf XI was broadcast on UKTV's Dave channel from September to October 2016. Red Dwarf XII, which was shot back-to-back with XI, aired from October to November 2017.

'''Guo Zhongmin''' (June 24, 1966 - February 23, 2003) was a Chinese [[mass murder]]er who killed 13 people in [[Yangxiaoxiang]], [[Huludao]], [[People's Republic of China]] on February 18, 2003, before committing suicide.

Due to a land dispute with three neighbours he armed himself with a knife and a stick, entered their homes and stabbed or beat a total of 13 people, all of them fatally, before he fled and hid in the mountains. Searched by more than 1000 police officers Guo eventually committed suicide by swallowing pesticide when he was surrounded on February 23.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-71884392.html Thirteen dead in land-dispute stabbings in northeast China], ''[[Associated Press]]'' (February 20, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 16, 2004, he was kidnapped from an [[Abidjan]] parking lot and has not been seen since.&lt;ref name=globeandmail-2007-08-23/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbc-2007-08-23/&gt;  In early 2012 remains suspected to belong to Kieffer were found in the [[Issia Department|department of Issia]], in the west of Côte d'Ivoire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canadian-journalist-s-remains-possibly-found-in-ivory-coast-1.1295091|title=Canadian journalist's remains possibly found in Ivory Coast|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Kieffer was born and raised in France; his family lives in the [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Rhône-Alpes]]. He studied [[law]] in [[Montreal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

From 1984 to 2002, Kieffer worked for the French financial newspaper ''[[La Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name=globeandmail-2007-08-23&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070823.wkieffer0823/BNStory/International/?page=rss&amp;id=RTGAM.20070823.wkieffer0823

== Kidnapping and probable murder ==
At approximately 1 p.m. on April 16, 2004, Kieffer was kidnapped in the parking lot of a shopping center in [[Abidjan]].&lt;ref name=globeandmail-2007-08-23/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbc-2007-08-23/&gt;  At the time he was working on a story about money laundering and illegal currency transfers allegedly involving the Ivorian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

He had been drawn there by someone claiming to have leads on a government corruption story he was assembling. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}  He has never been seen since, nor has a corpse been found. To this day his fate and the identity of his kidnappers remains a mystery.

In a 2006 interview regarding her book ''Bitter Chocolate'', CBC journalist [[Carol Off]] claimed that Kieffer's disappearance and probable murder was related to his investigation of the shady practices involving the Ivorian government and the [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] industry. She had travelled to Côte d'Ivoire to research her book, and claimed that upon her arrival in the country Canadian embassy officials had given her a stern warning regarding Kieffer:

: SU: "Did you ever find yourself in danger like he [Kieffer] did?"

: Off: "I had a meeting with the Canadian Embassy and they said "you shouldn't be here asking questions about cocoa. It's very dangerous. But if you have to, at the very least, don't ask any questions about Guy-André Kieffer. Whatever you do, don't even mention his name."

: "Maybe that's good advice, but wherever I went they would raise his name and in ways that I realized weren't even veiled threats. I would be speaking with somebody in the business and they would say, 'You know what happened to the last person who asked these questions? I wonder where he is now?' They would just look at you. You got the message. I quickly realized how incredibly sinister and evil this story really was."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Legal proceedings ==
In May 2004, civil proceedings concerning Kieffer's disappearance were launched in France by Kieffer's family and [[Reporters Without Borders|Reporters sans frontières]]. The French magistrate charged with the case was sent to Abidjan and there interrogated Michel Legré, a brother-in-law of the wife of Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo, who was allegedly the last person to see Kieffer alive. Legré provided a list of names of influential Ivorians who he alleged were involved in Kieffer's kidnapping.&lt;ref name=amnesty-2005/&gt;

This list of names was subsequently published in some Ivorian newspapers. In 2004, Legré was arrested in Abidjan by Ivorian police and charged with complicity in a kidnapping, illegal imprisonment and [[murder]]. He was also charged with defamation for naming the individuals on the list.&lt;ref name=amnesty-2005/&gt; Legré was provisionally released in 2005 and has since fled the country &amp;ndash; or is in an unknown location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_jeune_afrique.asp?art_cle=LIN16097oestmrgelle0 Où est Michel Legré ?] 16 septembre 2007, [[Jeune Afrique]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the French magistrate was not granted access to all of the persons named by Legré. The magistrate questioned Legré himself on 21 October 2004, and on 13 December 2004 requested that Legré be temporarily moved to France, as he felt Legré was unable to speak freely in his Ivorian prison. However, the French government initially did not aid in this request, for which they were denounced by Kieffer's wife Osange Silou-Kieffer.&lt;ref name=amnesty-2005/&gt;

On August 23, 2007, French president [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] met with Kieffer's wife Osange Silou-Kieffer in Paris, and expressed his determination to aid in the case. Silou-Kieffer claimed that Sarkozy's predecessor [[Jacques Chirac]] had never answered her request for a meeting.&lt;ref name=globeandmail-2007-08-23/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbc-2007-08-23/&gt;

Silou-Kieffer indicated she had asked Sarkozy to pressure Ivorian president [[Laurent Gbagbo]] to allow French judges to interrogate Ivorian suspects in the case.&lt;ref name=globeandmail-2007-08-23/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbc-2007-08-23/&gt;

In July 2008 [[Simone Gbagbo]] &amp;ndash; [[First Lady of Côte d'Ivoire]] &amp;ndash; was formally called for questioning by a French investigative judge, examining the April 2004 disappearance and presumed death of Kieffer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_depeche.asp?art_cle=AFP01738affaiegujel0 Affaire Kieffer: Simone Gbagbo et un ministre convoqués chez le juge]. 8 July 2008 - AFP.&lt;/ref&gt;    Speculation has surrounded the Ivorian first family, as Michel Legré is the brother-in-law of Simone Gbagbo.

[[File:HermanKlein1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Herman Klein]]
'''Herman Klein''' (born '''Hermann Klein'''; 23 July 1856 – 10 March 1934) was an English music critic, author and teacher of singing.  Klein's famous brothers included [[Charles Klein|Charles]] and [[Manuel Klein]].  His second wife was the writer [[Kathleen Clarice Louise Cornwell]], and one of their children was the writer [[Denise Robins]].

For thirteen years, Klein was a vocal teacher at the [[Guildhall School of Music]] in London, becoming a lifelong proponent of the methods of [[Manuel García (baritone)|Manuel Garcia]] and helping to edit Garcia's book on the subject.  In 1876 he took up musical journalism, writing for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' from 1881–1901, among other publications.  He also contributed prolifically to ''The Musical Times''.  From 1901 to 1909, Klein lived and taught singing in New York City, where he wrote for ''[[The New York Herald]]''.  He was one of the first critics to take notice of the gramophone and was appointed "musical adviser" to Columbia Records in 1906 in New York.  He returned to England in 1909.

Klein wrote over half a dozen books about music and singers, as well as English translations of operas and art songs.  He was a noted authority on [[Gilbert and Sullivan]].  In 1924 he began writing for ''[[The Gramophone]]'' and was in charge of operatic reviews, as well as contributing a monthly article on singing, from then until his death.

==Biography==

===Personal life===
Klein was born in [[Norwich]], Norfolk, [[East Anglia]], England the son of Hermann Klein senior and his wife Adelaide (née Soman). Apparently, the elder Klein emigrated from [[Riga|Riga, Latvia]],&lt;ref name=Stoneobit&gt;Stone, Christopher. "Herman Klein, July 23, 1856 – March 10, 1934", reprinted in Moran, p. 603&lt;/ref&gt; then part of the [[Russian Empire]], and home to a large community of [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] Jews such as the Kleins.  Once in Norwich, his father became a professor of foreign languages at the King Edward VI Grammar School, and his mother taught dance.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in New York (City and State)''. Lewis Historical Publ. Co., 1909, p. 787.  A petition from the Jews of Norwich, ''Norwich Petition For the Removal of the [[Disabilities (Jewish)|Disabilities]] of the Jews'', 24 January 1848, includes the signature of a David Soman, boot and shoemaker, who may have been the father of Adelaide.  Transcription in the archives of [http://www.Jewishgen.org JewishGen].&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Klein's five brothers were Max, a violinist, [[Charles Klein|Charles]], a dramatist; [[Manuel Klein|Manuel]], a composer; [[Alfred Klein|Alfred]], an actor; and Philip.  They had a sister, Adelaide.&lt;ref&gt;1871 and 1881 England Census, available on Ancestry.com.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the uncle of producer Philip Klein (1888–1935).

Although his forename was frequently spelled as "Hermann" until [[World War I]], he "deprecated any foreign pronunciation of it and was proud of his British citizenship and upbringing".&lt;ref name=timesobit&gt;"Mr. Herman Klein: Music critic, teacher, and writer", ''[[The Times]]'', 12 March 1934, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The musical activities of Norwich, particularly its Festival and the Cathedral services, impressed him as a boy.&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt; He was educated in Norwich and later in London.&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U212414 "Klein, Herman",] ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 3 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Klein was married three times.  His first wife was Emily May Brown, a ballerina, with whom he had a daughter, Sibyl Klein, who became an actress;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/01/12/101965798.pdf "News of the Playhouses",] ''The New York Times'', 12 January 1903, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; they divorced.&lt;ref name=gramophone73/&gt; On 19 February 1890, he married a 17-year-old Australian-born heiress [[Kathleen Clarice Louise Cornwell]], later a popular writer, at the [[West London Synagogue]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.JewishGen.org ''United Kingdom Marriages, 1838–1972''] at JewishGen.org&lt;/ref&gt; Their children included two writers:  Adrian Bernard L. Klein (1892–1969), who changed his name to [[Adrian Cornwell-Clyne]] and wrote books on photography and [[cinematography]], and Denise Naomi Klein (1897–1985), who under her first married name, [[Denise Robins]], became a best-selling romantic novelist&lt;ref name=bear/&gt; and was the first president of the [[Romantic Novelists' Association]] (1960–1966).  Her daughter, Patricia Robins, is also a popular romance writer under the name [[Claire Lorrimer]].  Klein and Kathleen Clarice had another son, Daryl Kleyn (b. 1894).&lt;ref name=ykn&gt;Lorrimer, Claire. ''You Never Know'', autobiography&lt;/ref&gt; During their marriage, Kathleen Clarice began an affair with a young man, Herbert Arthur Berkeley Dealtry (b. 1878), who was a [[Worcestershire Regiment]] officer. When Klein became aware of it, he filed a petition for divorce, which was granted in December 1901. He was still affiliated with the West London Synagogue in 1901, the year of his divorce and his departure for New York.&lt;ref name=bear&gt;[http://bearalley.blogspot.com/2007/09/kathleen-clarisa-cornwell.html Kathleen Clarisa Cronwell], bearalley online at bearalley.blogspot.com (accessed 13 February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in British Jewry'', p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; Klein's third wife was Helene Fox, a [[Christian Science]] practitioner of Boston, Massachusetts, whom he married in 1905.&lt;ref name=gramophone73/&gt;

Klein died in London, aged 77.&lt;ref name=Stoneobit/&gt;

===Career===
For thirteen years, Klein was a vocal teacher at the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama|Guildhall School of Music]] in London and also trained many professional singers privately.&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 12 March 1934, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote songs and short works for piano. In 1874, Klein returned to Norwich temporarily to help his ailing mother. That year [[Manuel Patricio Rodríguez García|Manuel Garcia]] also moved into the same house as Klein at [[1 Bentinck Street]] in London. Klein became his student for four years and was closely associated with him for another six years.&lt;ref&gt;''Musical Courier'', 15 March 1905, p. 18. Klein called Garcia "the greatest singing teacher who ever lived." For their address, see 1881 England Census, available on Ancestry.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The friendship became a transformative experience for Klein, who would recall Garcia and his singing principles in many of his writings throughout his life.  He helped edit Garcia's book on his singing method, published in English in 1872 (later revised by Klein and published as ''Hints on Singing'' in 1894).&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;

In 1876 Klein took up musical journalism.  He began writing for ''The Examiner'' in 1879, and then for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' (1881–1901), ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', ''The Citizen'', and the ''Lady's Pictorial''.  He was for many years a musical correspondent of ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Scotsman]]'' and also contributed prolifically to ''The Musical Times''.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;

From 1901 to 1909, He lived in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;His brothers Charles and Manuel lived and worked in New York. Klein lived at 154 West 77th St. NYC.  See ''Musical Courier'', 5 November 1902, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote for ''[[The New York Herald]]'', taught singing,&lt;ref&gt;Klein's teacher Manuel Garcia wrote: "It is gratifying to me to know that the great American people appreciate the sound theories of the old school, and they will assuredly find in you one among its few capable exponents." See ''Musical Courier'', 11 December 1901, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a founder and first chairman of the [[New York Singing Teachers' Association|National Association of Teachers of Singing]].&lt;ref&gt;''Musical Courier'', 13 November 1907, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=T7gqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=Klein+%22National+Association+of+Teachers+of+Singing%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LPyI1aB5Zj&amp;sig=mikKU5nz8wGy0X8M6m0V7Jx4WAA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=p-IfSrCjC8Sktgfg9IHMBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2 ''Papers and Proceedings of the Music Teachers' National Association''], pp. 172–76, Music Teachers National Association (1927)&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first critics to take notice of the [[phonograph|gramophone]].  He was appointed "musical adviser" to [[Columbia Records]] in 1906 in New York and was responsible for introducing [[David Bispham]], [[Anton van Rooy]], [[Lillian Blauvelt]] and [[Ruth Vincent]] and others to the recording studio.&lt;ref name=Stoneobit/&gt; Klein eventually came to hold an unfavourable view of American musical life and returned to Britain in May 1909, continuing to teach and write.&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt; He wrote over half a dozen books about music and singers, as well as English translations of operas and art songs. In 1924 he began writing for ''[[The Gramophone]]'' and was in charge of operatic reviews, as well as contributing a monthly article on singing, from then until his death.&lt;ref name=gramophone73&gt;Wimbush, Roger.

Among his other activities, Klein listed "Inventor of the Phono-Vocal Method of learning singing with the aid of a gramophone" and "Past Grand Organist of Grand Lodge of Freemasons".&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; He was a member of the Critics' Circle, of which he was President and also Chairman of its musical committee.&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt;

==Publications==
In addition to publishing several books containing his criticism or music commentary, in which he left "vivid pictures of the great singers whose art he studied in the opera house",&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt; Klein translated several operas, including ''[[Carmen]]'', and poems of over seventy songs by [[Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Brahms]].&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; He was an authority on [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], having, as a young man, known [[Arthur Sullivan]] well and worked with him on musical committees.  Klein arranged for Sullivan to provide incidental music for [[Henry Irving]]'s 1889 production of ''[[Macbeth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; He later contributed articles on Gilbert and Sullivan to ''[[The Gramophone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Herman.

The '''Hitler family''' comprises the relatives and ancestors of [[Adolf Hitler]] (20 April 1889&amp;nbsp;– 30 April 1945), an [[Austria–Hungary|Austrian]]-born [[Germans|German]] politician and the leader of the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'', abbreviated NSDAP), commonly known as the Nazi Party. He was dictator of Germany, holding the titles [[Chancellor of Germany#Chancellor of the Third Reich (1933–1945)|Chancellor of Germany]] from 1933 to 1945, and served as [[head of state]] as ''[[Führer|Führer und Reichskanzler]]'' from 1934 to 1945. He is noted for his central role in the rise of [[fascism]] in Germany, provoking the start of [[World War II]], and the death of millions of people in [[the Holocaust]].

Before the birth of Adolf Hitler the [[German name#Nachname|family surname]] had many variations that were often used almost interchangeably. Some of the common variances were Hitler, Hiedler, Hüttler, Hytler, and Hittler. [[Alois Schicklgruber]] (Adolf's father) changed his name on 7 January 1877 to "Hitler", which was the only form of the last name that Adolf used.&lt;ref name=TreeExamples&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Adolf Hitler's online family tree (1998, drawn by Jennifer Rosenberg) at about.com, [http://history1900s.about.com/library/holocaust/nhitanc.htm Online Family Tree]. Family trees can also be found in various Hitler biographies; e.g. see Toland (1976), pp.10–11; Kershaw (1999), p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family has long been of interest to [[historian]]s and [[genealogist]]s because of the biological uncertainty of Hitler's paternal grandfather as well as the family's inter-relationships and their psychological effect on Hitler during his childhood and later life.

==Etymology==
''Hitler'' may be a spelling variation of the name ''Hiedler'', meaning one who resides by a ''Hiedl'' - in [[Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian dialects]] a term for a subterranean fountain or river.&lt;ref&gt;Udolph, Jürgen Udolph &amp; Fitzek, Sebastian (2005) ''Professor Udolphs Buch der Namen: Woher sie kommen, was sie bedeuten'' Munich: C. Bertelsmann.&lt;/ref&gt; Or the ''Hitler'' surname may be based on "one who lives in a hut" (German ''Hütte'' for "hut").&lt;ref&gt;Jetzinger, Franz (1976) [1956]. ''Hitler's Youth''. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, p.32. {{ISBN|978-0-8371-8617-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family history==

===Earliest family members===
The roots of the Hitler family tree go back to Stefan Hiedler (born 1672) and Agnes Capeller, whose grandson Martin Hiedler (17 November 1762 – 10 January 1829), married Anna Maria Göschl (23 August 1760 – 7 December 1854). This couple had at least three children, Lorenz, Johann Georg (baptised 28 February 1792 – 9 February 1857), and Johann Nepomuk (19 March 1807 – 17 September 1888). Johann Georg was the stepfather of Alois Hitler, who was Adolf Hitler's father, and Johan Nepomuk was the future Führer's maternal great-grandfather. There is no additional information about Lorenz Hiedler.&lt;ref name=TreeExamples/&gt; The Hiedlers were from [[Weitra#Geography|Spital]], part of [[Weitra]] in [[Austria]].{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|pp=3-5}}

===Johann Georg and Johann Nepomuk===
Brothers [[Johann Georg Hiedler|Johann Georg]] and [[Johann Nepomuk Hiedler]] are connected to Adolf Hitler in several ways, although the biological relationship is disputed.

Johann Georg was legitimized and considered the officially accepted paternal grandfather of Hitler by [[Nazi Germany]]. Whether he was actually Hitler's biological paternal grandfather remains unknown.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=4}} He married his first wife in 1824, but she died in childbirth five months later. In 1842, he married [[Maria Schicklgruber|Maria Anna Schicklgruber]] (15 April 1795 – 7 January 1847) and became the legal stepfather to her illegitimate five-year-old son, [[Alois Hitler|Alois]].

Around age 10, near the time of his mother's death, Alois went to live with Johann Nepomuk on his farm.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=5}} Johann Nepomuk Hiedler (also known as Johann Nepomuk Hüttler) was named after a [[Bohemian]] [[saint]], [[John of Nepomuk|Johann von Nepomuk]], an important saint for Bohemians of both [[Germans|German]] and [[Czech people|Czech]] ethnicity. Johann Nepomuk became a relatively prosperous farmer and was married to Eva Maria Decker (1792–1873), who was fifteen years his senior.

The Nazis issued a pamphlet during the 1932 second elections campaign titled "Facts and Lies about Hitler" which refuted the rumour spread by the S.P.D. and Center Party that Hitler had Czech ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/tatsachenundluegen.htm |title= Facts and Lies about Hitler |publisher= Nazi party |year= 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that any of Hitler's known ancestors were of Czech origin.&lt;ref&gt;Hitler's Vienna: A Portrait of the Tyrant as a Young Man By Brigitte Hamann, page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Father of Alois Hitler===
[[File:Alois Hitler.jpeg|thumb|[[Alois Hitler]], Adolf's father]]

The identity of the [[Alois Hitler#Biological father|biological father of Alois]] is disputed. Legally, Johann Nepomuk Hiedler was the step-uncle of Alois Schicklgruber (later Alois Hitler), and Johann Nepomuk's brother [[Johann Georg Hiedler]], a wandering miller, was his step-father.&lt;ref&gt;Toland (1976), p.4&lt;/ref&gt; For reasons unknown, Johann Nepomuk took in Alois when he was a boy and raised him. It is possible that he was, in fact, the natural father of Alois but could not acknowledge this publicly due to his marriage. Another possibility is that he took pity on the ten-year-old Alois after the death of the boy's mother [[Maria Anna Schicklgruber|Maria]], as it could hardly have been a suitable life for a ten-year-old child to be raised by an itinerant miller. Johann Nepomuk died on 17 September 1888 and left Alois a considerable portion of his life savings. 

It was later claimed that Johann Georg had fathered Alois prior to his marriage to Maria, although Alois had been declared illegitimate on his birth certificate and baptism papers. The claim that Johann Georg was the true father of Alois was not made during the lifetime of either Johann Georg or Maria. In 1877, 20 years after the death of Johann Georg and almost 30 years after the death of Maria, Alois was legally declared to have been Johann Georg's son. Johann Nepomuk engineered the plan to change the surname of Alois to "Hitler" and to have Johann Georg declared the biological father of Alois in 1876. Johann Nepomuk collected three "witnesses" (his son-in-law and two others) who testified before a notary in Weitra that Johann Georg had several times stated in their presence that he was the actual father of Alois and wanted to make Alois his legitimate son and heir. The parish priest in [[Döllersheim]], where the original birth certificate of Alois resided, altered the birth register. Alois was 39 years old at the time and was well-known in the community as "Alois Schicklgruber".&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Toland (1976), pp.4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, Johann Georg Hiedler is one of three people often cited as having possibly been the biological grandfather of Adolf Hitler. The other two are Johann Nepomuk and a [[Graz]] [[Jew]] by the name of Leopold Frankenberger (rumored by ex-Nazi [[Hans Frank]] during the [[Nuremberg Trials]]). In the 1950s, the third possibility became popular among historians, but modern historians have concluded that Frank's speculation has no factual support. Frank said that Maria came from "Leonding near Linz", when in fact she came from the hamlet of Strones, near the village of Döllersheim.

===Pölzl family===
[[Johanna Hiedler]], the daughter of Johann Nepomuk and Eva Hiedler (''[[née]]'' Decker) was born on 19 January 1830 in Spital (part of [[Weitra]]) in the [[Waldviertel]] of [[Lower Austria]]. She lived her entire life there and was married to Johann Baptist Pölzl (1825–1901), a farmer and son of Johann Pölzl and Juliana (Walli) Pölzl. Johanna and Johann had 5 sons and 6 daughters, of whom 2 sons and 3 daughters survived into adulthood, the 3 daughters being [[Klara Hitler|Klara]], Johanna, and Theresia. Klara’s brothers' identities are unknown.

===1870s===
{{main|Alois Hitler}}
At the age of 36, Alois Hitler was married for the first time, to Anna Glasl-Hörer, who was a wealthy, 50-year-old daughter of a customs official. She was sick when Alois married her and was either an invalid or became one shortly afterwards. Not long after marrying her, Alois Hitler began an affair with 19-year-old Franziska "Fanni" Matzelsberger, one of the young female servants employed at the Pommer Inn, house #219, in the city of [[Braunau am Inn]], where he was renting the top floor as a lodging. Smith states that Alois had numerous affairs in the 1870s, resulting in his wife initiating legal action; on 7 November 1880 Alois and Anna separated by mutual agreement. Matzelsberger became the 43-year-old Hitler's girlfriend, but the two could not marry since under [[Roman Catholic]] canon law, divorce is not permitted. 



===1880s===
[[File:Klara Polz Hitler.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Klara Hitler|Klara Pölzl Hitler]], third wife of Alois and mother of Adolf.]]
On 13 January 1882, Matzelsberger gave birth to Hitler's illegitimate son, also named Alois, but since they were not married, the child was Alois Matzelsberger. Hitler remained with Matzelsberger while his wife, Anna, grew sicker and died on 6 April 1883. The next month, on 22 May at a ceremony in Braunau with fellow customs officials as witnesses, Hitler, 45, married Matzelsberger, 21. He then legitimized his son as Alois Hitler Jr.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/h/hitler-adolf/oss-papers/text/oss-profile-04-01.html|title=OSS Psychological Profile of Hitler, Part Four|website=www.nizkor.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; later a Berlin restaurateur.&lt;ref name="gunther1940"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n43/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | author=Gunther, John |authorlink=John Gunther| location=New York| year=1940 | page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matzelsberger went to [[Vienna]] to give birth to [[Angela Hitler]]. When she was still only 23, she acquired a lung disorder and became too ill to function. She was moved to Ranshofen, a small village near Braunau. 

In 1876, three years after Alois married Anna Glasl-Hörer, he hired [[Klara Pölzl]] as a household servant. She was the 16-year-old granddaughter of his step-uncle (and possible father or biological uncle) Nepomuk. Matzelsberger demanded that the "servant girl" Klara find another job, and Hitler sent Pölzl away. During the last months of Matzelsberger's life, Klara Pölzl returned to the home of Alois to look after the invalid and their two children.&lt;ref name=Langer114&gt;Langer, Walter (1972). ''The Mind of Adolf Hitler'', New York, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Matzelsberger died in Ranshofen on 10 August 1884 at the age of 23. After her death, Pölzl remained in Hitler's home as housekeeper.&lt;ref name=Langer114/&gt; 

Pölzl was soon pregnant by Alois. If Johann Nepomuk was the father of Alois, Klara was the half-niece of Alois; if Johann Georg was his father, she was his first cousin once removed. Smith writes that if Hitler had been free to do as he wished, he would have married Pölzl immediately, but because of the affidavit concerning his paternity, Hitler was now legally Pölzl's first cousin once removed, too close to marry. He submitted an appeal to the church for a humanitarian waiver.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Alois petitioned the church for an episcopal dispensation citing "bilateral affinity in the third degree touching the second" to describe his rather complicated family relationship to Klara. The local bishop apparently believed this relationship was too close to approve on his own authority, so he forwarded the petition to Rome on behalf of Alois, seeking instead a papal dispensation, which was approved before the birth of the couple's first child. ''See'' [https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/r/rosenbaum-hitler.html Rosenblum article].&lt;/ref&gt; Permission came, and on 7 January 1885 a wedding was held at Hitler's rented rooms on the top floor of the Pommer Inn. A meal was served for the few guests and witnesses. Hitler then went to work for the rest of the day. Even Klara found the wedding to be a short ceremony. Throughout the marriage, she continued to call him ''uncle''.

On 17 May 1885, five months after the wedding, the new Frau Klara Hitler gave birth to her first child, Gustav. A year later, on 25 September 1886, she gave birth to a daughter, Ida. During the winter of 1887–8, [[diphtheria]] struck the Hitler household, resulting in the deaths of both Gustav (8 December) and Ida (2 January). Klara and Alois had been married for three years, and all their children were dead, but Alois still had the children from his relationship with Matzelsberger, Alois Jr. and Angela. On 20 April 1889, Klara gave birth to Adolf. Recent research indicates that Otto Hitler, a brother of Adolf Hitler's long thought to have been born in 1887,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kershaw | first = Ian | title = Hitler: A Biography | publisher = W.

===1890s===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1989-0322-506, Adolf Hitler, Kinderbild.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Infant Adolf, son of Alois and Klara.]]
Adolf was a sickly child, and his mother fretted over him. Alois, who was 51 when Adolf was born, had little interest in child rearing and left it all to his wife. When not at work he was either in a tavern or busy with his hobby: [[apiculture|keeping bees]]. In 1892, Alois was transferred from Braunau to Passau. He was 55, Klara 32, Alois Jr. 10, Angela 9, and Adolf 3 years old. In 1894, Alois Hitler was reassigned to [[Linz]]. Klara gave birth to their fifth child, Edmund, on 24 March 1894, and it was decided that she and the children would stay in Passau for the time being.

In February 1895, Alois Hitler purchased a house on a 3.6 hectare (9-acre) plot in Hafeld near [[Lambach]], approximately 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of [[Linz]]. The farm was called the Rauscher Gut. He moved his family to the farm and retired on 25 June 1895 at the age of 58 after 40 years in the customs service. He found farming difficult; he lost money, and the value of the property declined. On 21 January 1896, [[Paula Hitler|Paula]] was born. Alois was often home with his family. He had five children ranging in age from infancy to 14; Smith suggests he yelled at the children almost continually and made long visits to the local tavern. Robert G. L. Waite noted, "Even one of his closest friends admitted that Alois was 'awfully rough' with his wife [Klara] and 'hardly ever spoke a word to her at home.'" If Hitler was in a bad mood, he picked on the older children or Klara herself, in front of the rest.

After Alois and Alois Jr had a violent argument, Alois Jr left home at 14, and the elder Alois swore he would never give the boy a penny of inheritance beyond what the law required. Apparently Alois Jr's relations with his stepmother Klara were also strained. After working as an apprentice waiter in the [[Shelbourne Hotel]] in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], Alois Jr was arrested for theft and served a five-month sentence in 1900, followed by a nine-month sentence in 1902.

===1900s===
Edmund, the youngest Hitler boy, died of [[measles]] on 2 February 1900. Alois wanted his son Adolf to seek a career in the civil service. However, Adolf had become so alienated from his father that he was repulsed by whatever Alois wanted. Adolf sneered at the thought of a lifetime spent enforcing petty rules. Alois tried to browbeat his son into obedience while Adolf did his best to be the opposite of whatever his father wanted.

Alois Hitler died in 1903, leaving Klara a government [[pension]]. She sold the house in [[Leonding]] and moved with young Adolf and Paula to an apartment in [[Linz]], where they lived frugally. By 1907, Klara had fallen very ill due to [[breast cancer]]. Adolf cried when told by her doctor [[Eduard Bloch]] that his mother "had little chance of surviving".{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=13, 14}} Despite continued medical treatment by Dr. Bloch, Klara's condition did not improve and in October, he told Adolf her condition was hopeless. Klara died at home in Linz on 21 December 1907. Adolf and Paula were left with some financial support from their mother's pension and her modest estate of about 2,000 Kronen, after the medical and funeral costs were paid.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=15, 16}} Klara was buried in [[Leonding]]. Hitler had a close relationship with his mother during her lifetime. He was crushed by her death and carried the [[grief]] for the rest of his life. Speaking of Hitler, Bloch later recalled that after Klara's death he had never seen "anyone so prostrate with grief". Hitler wrote years later that his mother's death was a " 'dreadful blow' ".{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=15, 16}}

On 14 September 1903&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Hauner | first=Milan | coauthors= | title=Hitler: a chronology of his life and time | year=1983 | publisher=Macmillan | location=London | isbn=0-333-30983-9 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Zdral | first=Wolfgang | coauthors= | title=Die Hitlers | date= | publisher=Campus Verlag GmbH | location= | isbn=3-593-37457-9 | page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angela Hitler, Adolf's half-sister, married Leo Raubal (11 June 1879 – 10 August 1910), a junior tax inspector, and on 12 October 1906 she gave birth to a son, [[Leo Rudolf Raubal Jr|Leo]]. On 4 June 1908 Angela gave birth to [[Geli Raubal|Geli]] and in 1910 to a second daughter, Elfriede (Elfriede Maria Hochegger, 10 January 1910 – 24 September 1993).

===1910s===
In 1909, Alois Hitler Jr. met an Irishwoman by the name of [[Bridget Dowling]] at the [[Dublin Horse Show]]. They eloped to [[London]] and married on 3 June 1910. William Dowling, Bridget's father, threatened to have Alois arrested for [[kidnapping]], but Bridget dissuaded him. The couple settled in [[Liverpool]], where their son [[William Patrick Hitler]] was born in 1911. The family lived in a flat at 102 Upper Stanhope Street. The house was destroyed in the last German [[Liverpool Blitz|air-raid on Liverpool]] on 10 January 1942. Nothing remains of the house or those that surrounded it, and the area was eventually cleared and grassed over. Bridget Dowling's memoirs claim Hitler lived with them in Liverpool from 1912 to 1913 while he was on the run to avoid being [[conscription|conscripted]] in his native [[Austria-Hungary]], but most historians dismiss this story as a fiction invented to make the book more appealing to publishers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.ie/~irishrts/Sample%20Hitler%20His%20Irish%20Relatives.htm "Hitler: His Irish Relatives"], by Tony McCarthy in ''Irish Roots'' magazine. Retrieved: 2010-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Alois attempted to make money by running a small restaurant in [[Dale Street]], a boarding house on Parliament Street and a hotel on Mount Pleasant, all of which failed. Alois Jr. left his family in May 1914 and he returned alone to the [[German Empire]] to establish himself in the safety-razor business.

Paula had moved to [[Vienna]], where she worked as a secretary. She did not have contact with Hitler during the period comprising his difficult years as a painter in Vienna and later [[Munich]], military service during the [[First World War]] and early political activities back in Munich. She was delighted to meet him again in Vienna during the early 1920s, though she later claimed to have been privately distraught at his subsequent rising fame.

====First World War====
{{Main|Military career of Adolf Hitler}}
When the [[First World War]] broke out, Alois Jr. was stranded in Germany and it was impossible for his wife and son to join him. He married another woman, Hedwig Heidemann (or Hedwig Mickley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cicero.de/97.php?ress_id=7&amp;item=1722|title=cicero.de/97|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922192610/http://www.cicero.de/97.php?ress_id=7|archivedate=2009-09-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), in 1916. After the war, a third party informed Bridget that he was dead.

At the outbreak of the [[First World War]], Adolf Hitler was a resident of Munich and volunteered to serve in the [[Bavarian Army]] as an Austrian citizen.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=90}} Posted to the [[6th Bavarian Reserve Division|Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16]] (1st Company of the List Regiment).{{sfn|Weber|2010|pp=12–13}}{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=90}} Hitler's case was not exceptional as he was not the only Austrian soldier in the List Regiment. It is likely Hitler was accepted into the Bavarian army either simply because nobody had asked him whether he was a German citizen when he first volunteered or because the recruiting authorities were happy to accept any volunteer and simply did not care what Hitler's nationality was, or because he might have told the Bavarian authorities that he intended to become a German citizen.{{sfn|Weber|2010|p=16}}

He served as a dispatch [[runner (soldier)|runner]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in France and Belgium,{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=53}} spending nearly half his time well behind the front lines.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=54}}{{sfn|Weber|2010|p=100}} He was present at the [[First Battle of Ypres]], the [[Battle of the Somme]], the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] and the [[Battle of Passchendaele]], and was wounded at the Somme.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=30}}

He was decorated for bravery, receiving the [[Iron Cross]], Second Class, in 1914.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=30}} Recommended by [[Hugo Gutmann]], he received the Iron Cross, First Class, on 4 August 1918,{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=59}} a decoration rarely awarded to one of Hitler's rank (''[[Gefreiter]]''). Hitler's post at regimental headquarters, providing frequent interactions with senior officers, may have helped him receive this decoration.{{sfn|Bullock|1962|p=52}} Though his rewarded actions may have been courageous, they were probably not highly exceptional.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=96}} He also received the [[Wound Badge|Black Wound Badge]] on 18 May 1918.{{sfn|Steiner|1976|p=392}}

During his service at the headquarters, Hitler pursued his artwork, drawing cartoons, and instructions for an army newspaper. During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916, he was wounded either in the groin area{{sfn|Jamieson|2008}} or the left thigh by a shell that had exploded in the dispatch runners' dugout.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=57}}
[[File:Hitler 1914 1918.jpg|thumb|upright|Hitler as a soldier during the First World War (1914–1918)]]
Hitler spent almost two months in the Red Cross hospital at [[Beelitz]], returning to his regiment on 5 March 1917.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=58}} On 15 October 1918, he was temporarily blinded by a [[mustard gas]] attack and was hospitalised in [[Pasewalk]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=59, 60}} While there, Hitler learnt of Germany's defeat,{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=97}} and—by his own account—on receiving this news, he suffered a second bout of blindness.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=102}}

Hitler became embittered over the collapse of the war effort, and his ideological development began to firmly take shape.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=61, 62}} He described the war as "the greatest of all experiences", and was praised by his commanding officers for his bravery.{{sfn|Keegan|1987|pp=238–240}} The experience reinforced his passionate German patriotism and he was shocked by Germany's [[Capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]] in November 1918.{{sfn|Bullock|1962|p=60}} Like other German nationalists, he believed in the ''Dolchstoßlegende'' ([[stab-in-the-back legend]]), which claimed that the German army, "undefeated in the field", had been "stabbed in the back" on the [[home front]] by civilian leaders and [[Marxism|Marxists]], later dubbed the "November criminals".{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=61–63}}

The [[Treaty of Versailles]] stipulated that Germany must relinquish several of its territories and [[demilitarization|demilitarise]] the [[Rhineland]]. The treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on the country. Many Germans perceived the treaty—especially [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|Article 231]], which declared Germany responsible for the war—as a humiliation.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=96}} The Versailles Treaty and the economic, social, and political conditions in Germany after the war were later exploited by Hitler for political gains.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=80, 90, 92}}

===1920s===
On 14 March 1920, [[Heinz Hitler|Heinrich "Heinz" Hitler]] was born to Alois Jr and his second wife, Hedwig Heidemann. In 1924, Alois Jr was prosecuted for [[bigamy]], but [[acquittal|acquitted]] due to Bridget's intervention on his behalf. His older son, [[William Patrick Hitler|William Patrick]], stayed with Alois and his new family during his early trips to [[Weimar Republic]] Germany in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

When Adolf was confined in [[Landsberg Prison|Landsberg]], Angela made the trip from Vienna to visit him. Angela's daughters, Geli and Elfriede, accompanied their mother when she became Hitler's housekeeper in 1925; [[Geli Raubal]] was 17 at the time and would spend the next six years in close contact with her half-uncle.{{sfn|Bullock|1999|p=393}} Her mother was given a position as housekeeper at the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]] villa near [[Berchtesgaden]] in 1928.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=177}} Geli moved into Hitler's [[Munich]] apartment in 1929 when she enrolled in the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig Maximilian University]] to study medicine. She did not complete her medical studies.{{sfn|Görtemaker|2011|p=43}}

As he rose to power as leader of the [[Nazi Party]], Hitler kept a tight rein over his half-niece and behaved in a domineering and possessive manner.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=219}} When he discovered she was having a relationship with his chauffeur, [[Emil Maurice]], he forced an end to the affair and dismissed Maurice from his personal service.{{sfn|Görtemaker|2011|p=43}}{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=220}} After that he did not allow her to freely associate with friends, and attempted to have himself or someone he trusted near her at all times, accompanying her on shopping trips, to the movies, and to the opera.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=219}}

Adolf met [[Eva Braun]], 23 years his junior, at [[Heinrich Hoffmann (photographer)|Heinrich Hoffmann]]'s photography studio in [[Munich]] in October 1929.{{sfn|Görtemaker|2011|p=13}} He occasionally dated other women as well, including Hoffmann's daughter, Henrietta, and [[Maria Reiter]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=218}}

===1930s===
Hitler's half-niece Geli Raubal took her own life in 1931. Rumours immediately began in the media about a possible sexual relationship, and even murder.{{sfn|Görtemaker|2011|p=43}}{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=221}} Historian [[Ian Kershaw]] contends that stories circulated at the time as to alleged "sexual deviant practices ought to be viewed as ... anti-Hitler propaganda".{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=219}}

After having little contact with her brother Adolf, Paula was delighted to meet him again in Vienna during the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, Walter (1972). ''[[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]'', New York 1972 pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt; By her own account, after losing a job with a Viennese insurance company in 1930 when her employers found out who she was, Paula received financial support from her brother (which continued until his suicide in late April 1945). She lived under the assumed family name ''Wolf'' at Hitler's request (this was a childhood nickname of his which he had also used during the 1920s for security purposes) and worked sporadically. She later claimed to have seen her brother about once a year during the 1930s and early 1940s.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

When the NSDAP won 107 seats in the Reich parliament in 1930, the ''Times Union'' in Albany, NY, published a statement of Alois Jr.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anna Rosmus|Rosmus, Anna]] (2015) ''Hitlers Nibelungen''. Grafenau: Samples. p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Alois Jr. established a restaurant in [[Berlin]] which became a popular meeting place for [[Sturmabteilung|SA Stormtrooper]]s. He managed to keep the restaurant open through the duration of [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Angela strongly disapproved of Adolf's relationship with [[Eva Braun]]; she eventually left Berchtesgaden as a result and moved to [[Dresden]]. Hitler broke off relations with Angela and did not attend her second wedding. On 20 January 1936 she married German architect Professor Martin Hammitzsch, the Director of the State School of Building Construction in Dresden.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Second World War===
As Hitler led Germany into the Second World War, he became distant from his family. Angela and Adolf became estranged after she disapproved of Adolf's relationship with Eva Braun, but eventually re-established contact during the war. Angela was his intermediary to the rest of the family, because Adolf did not want contact. In 1941, she sold her memoirs of her years with Hitler to the [[Eher Verlag]], which brought her 20,000 [[Reichsmark]]. Meanwhile, Alois Jr. continued to manage his restaurant throughout the duration of the war. He was arrested by the [[United Kingdom|British]], but released when it became clear he had played no role in his brother's regime.

A couple of Adolf's relatives served in Nazi Germany during the war. Adolf's nephew Heinz was a member of the Nazi Party. He attended an elite military academy, the [[National Political Institutes of Education]] (Napola) in [[Ballenstedt]]/[[Saxony-Anhalt]]{{ref label|interrogation|1|b}}. Aspiring to be an officer, Heinz joined the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|''Heer'' (army)]] as a signals NCO with the 23rd Potsdamer Artillery Regiment in 1941, and he participated in the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]], [[Operation Barbarossa]]. On 10 January 1942, he was captured by Soviet forces and sent to the [[Moscow]] military prison [[Butyrka]], where he died, aged 21, after interrogation and [[torture]]. He never married nor had children.

In the spring of 1945, after the destruction of [[Dresden]] in the massive bomb attack of [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|13/14 February]], Adolf moved Angela to [[Berchtesgaden]] to avoid her being captured by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s. Also, he let her and his younger sister [[Paula Hitler|Paula]] have over 100,000 [[Reichsmark]]. Paula barely saw her brother during the war. There is some evidence Paula shared her brother's strong [[German nationalism in Austria|German nationalist]] beliefs, but she was not politically active and never joined the Nazi Party.&lt;ref name="Interrogation II with Paula Hitler"&gt;[http://www.shoah.dk/Paula/page_6.htm Interrogation II with Paula Hitler].&lt;/ref&gt; During the closing days of the war, at the age of 49, she was driven to [[Berchtesgaden]], Germany, apparently on the orders of [[Martin Bormann]].

After midnight on the night of 28–29 April 1945, Adolf and [[Eva Braun]] were married in a small civil ceremony within the ''[[Führerbunker]]'' in Berlin.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=342}} At the same location, on the following day of 30 April, the couple [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=955}}

===Post-Second World War===
In Hitler's [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|last will and testament]], he guaranteed Angela a pension of 1,000 [[Reichsmark]] monthly. It is uncertain if she ever received any of this amount. Nevertheless, she spoke very highly of him even after the war, and claimed that neither her brother nor she herself had known anything about [[the Holocaust]]. She declared that if Hitler had known what was going on in the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], he would have stopped them.

Adolf's sister Paula was arrested by US intelligence officers in May 1945 and debriefed later that year.&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usd230.k12.ks.us/PICTT/eisenhower/PaulaWolff/1.html |title=Interview with Paula Wolff |accessdate=2013-03-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216092128/http://www.usd230.k12.ks.us/PICTT/eisenhower/PaulaWolff/1.html |archivedate=February 16, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A transcript shows one of the agents remarking she bore a physical resemblance to her sibling. She told them the [[USSR|Russians]] had confiscated her house in [[Austria]], the Americans had expropriated her Vienna apartment and that she was taking English lessons. She characterized her childhood relationship with her brother as one of both constant bickering and strong affection. Paula said she could not bring herself to believe her brother had been responsible for [[the Holocaust]]. She also told them she had met Eva Braun only once. Paula was released from American custody and returned to [[Vienna]], where she lived on her savings for a time, then worked in an arts and crafts shop.

Other relatives of Hitler were approached by the Soviets. In May 1945, five of Hitler's relatives were arrested, his first cousins, Maria, Johann and Eduard Schmidt, along with Maria's husband Ignaz Koppensteiner, their son Adolf, and Johann Schmidt Jr., son of Maria and Eduard's deceased brother Johann. Koppensteiner was arrested by the Soviets on the basis that he "approved of [Hitler's] criminal plans against the USSR." He died in a Moscow prison in 1949. Both Eduard and Maria died in Soviet custody in 1951 and 1953, respectively. Johann Jr. was released in 1955. These relatives were posthumously pardoned by Russia in 1997.&lt;ref name="Pardon"&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/7260/russia-pardons-alleged-hitler-kin/|title=Russia pardons alleged Hitler kin|newspaper=Jewish News of Northern California|date=1997-12-19|accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vindicated"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/hitler-relatives-vindicated-1154982.html|title=Hitler relatives vindicated|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=April 7, 1998|accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arrested"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1998/Hitler-Relatives-Allegedly-Arrested/id-7b6169298be04d6b7ee5b8ee82e09412|title=Hitler Relatives Allegedly Arrested|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=July 18, 1998|accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, Paula Hitler moved to [[Berchtesgaden]], reportedly living "in seclusion" in a two-room flat as Paula Wolff. ("Wolf" was Adolf Hitler's self-adopted nickname.)&lt;ref&gt;Evans, R.J., ''The Third Reich in History and Memory.'' Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, she was looked after by former members of the [[SS]] and survivors of her brother's inner circle.&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt; In February 1959, she agreed to be interviewed by [[Peter Morley (filmmaker)|Peter Morley]], a documentary producer for [[United Kingdom|British]] television station [[Associated-Rediffusion]]. The resulting conversation was the only filmed interview she ever gave and was broadcast as part of a programme called ''Tyranny: The Years of Adolf Hitler''. She talked mostly about Hitler's childhood. Angela died of a stroke on 30 October 1949. Her brother, Alois Jr., died on 20 May 1956 in [[Hamburg]]. At that time, his name was Alois Hiller.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anna Rosmus|Rosmus, Anna]] (2015) ''Hitlers Nibelungen''.Grafenau: Samples. p.46&lt;/ref&gt; Paula, Adolf's last surviving sibling, died on 1 June 1960, at the age of 64.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Associated Press]]|title=Paula Hitler |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/209208842.html?dids=209208842:209208842&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=JUN+03%2C+1960&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Paula+Hitler%2C+Adolf's+Kin&amp;pqatl=google |quote=Berchtesgaden, Germany (AP) Paula Hitler, sister of Adolph [sic] Hitler, died Wednesday, according to police. |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 3, 1960 |accessdate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged children===
It is alleged that Hitler had a son, [[Jean-Marie Loret]], with a Frenchwoman named Charlotte Lobjoie. Jean-Marie Loret was born in March 1918 and died in 1985, aged 67.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Hitler had son with French teen |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/9088865/Hitler-had-son-with-French-teen.html |author=Peter Allen |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2012-02-22 |date=2012-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loret married several times, and had up to nine children. His family's lawyer has suggested that, if their descent from Hitler could be proven, they may be able to claim royalties for Hitler's book, ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/02/17/is-jean-marie-loret-hitlers-long-lost-son/|title=Is Jean-Marie Loret Hitler's long-lost son?|newspaper=National Post|author=Wordsworth, Araminta|date=February 17, 2012|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several historians such as [[Anton Joachimsthaler]],&lt;ref&gt;''Korrektur einer Biographie. Adolf Hitler, 1908–1920'' [''Emendation of a Biography. Adolf Hitler, 1908–1920''], Munich, 1989, pp. 162–64&lt;/ref&gt; and Sir [[Ian Kershaw]],&lt;ref&gt;''Hitler 1889–1936: Hubris''; Vol. 1, note 116 to Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; say that Hitler's paternity is unlikely or impossible to prove.

Angela married Leo Raubal Sr. (1879–1910). They had three children: [[Leo Rudolf Raubal Jr]] had one son, Peter Raubal, in 1931{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}; [[Geli Raubal]] committed suicide without having ever had a child in 1931; and Elfriede Raubal who married Ernst Hochegger in 1937 and had a son, Heiner Hochegger, in 1945{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} and a daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Ron Rosenbaum|Rosenbaum, Ron]]|title=Explaining Hitler|publisher=De Capo Press|isbn=978-0306823183|page=123–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinz Hitler|Heinz]], who was the son of Alois from his second marriage, died in a Soviet military prison in 1942 without children. [[William Patrick Hitler|William Patrick]], the son of Alois was his first marriage, married Phyllis Jean-Jacques in 1947 in the US, where they had four children. Also in that year, he changed his surname to Stuart-Houston; some have commented on its similarity with the name of the [[British people|British]] [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] writer [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/William-Stuart-Houston/6000000008260951961|title=William Patrick Stuart-Houston (Hitler)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their children, Alexander Adolf Stuart-Houston (1949), Louis Stuart-Houston (1951), Howard Ronald Stuart-Houston (1957), and Brian William Stuart-Houston (1965) have all had no children;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDFs/hitler_family_tree00.pdf|title=Hitler's family tree}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only Howard, who died in a car crash in 1989, was ever married.

According to David Gardner, author of the ''Last of the Hitlers'': "They didn’t sign a pact, but what they did is, they talked amongst themselves, talked about the burden they’ve had in the background of their lives, and decided that none of them would marry, none of them would have children. And that’s...a pact they’ve kept to this day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/10/end-hitlers-family-line-pact-sons-hitlers-nephew-never-children/|title=The End of Hitler’s Family Line – The Pact Between the Sons of Hitler’s Nephew Never to Have Children}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though none of Stuart-Houston's sons had children, his son Alexander, now a social worker, said that contrary to this speculation, there was no pact to intentionally end the Hitler bloodline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1382115/Getting-to-know-the-Hitlers.html|title=Getting to know the Hitlers|first=David|last=Gardner|date=24 October 2017|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5811">{{About|the Delaware politician|the Pennsylvania Congressman|Jacob Broom (congressman)}}

'''Jacob Broom''' (October 17, 1752 – April 25, 1810) was an [[United States|American]] [[businessperson]] and [[politician]] from [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], in [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]], [[Delaware]]. As a delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787]], he was a signer of the [[United States Constitution]].  He was also appointed as a delegate to the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)]] but did not attend, and he served in the [[Delaware General Assembly]].  He was the father of Congressman [[James M. Broom]] and grandfather of Congressman [[Jacob Broom (congressman)|Jacob Broom]].

His father was James Broom, a blacksmith turned prosperous farmer, and his mother was Esther Willis, a Quaker. In 1773 he married Rachel Pierce, and together they raised eight children.&lt;ref name=NatArch/&gt;

==Constitutional Convention==
Despite his lack of involvement in national politics prior to the Constitutional Convention, Broom was a dedicated supporter of strong central government. When [[George Washington]] visited Wilmington in 1783, Broom urged him to "contribute your advice and influence to promote that harmony and union of our infant governments which are so essential to the permanent establishment of our freedom, happiness and prosperity."

Broom carried these opinions with him to [[Philadelphia]], where he consistently voted for measures that would assure a powerful government responsive to the needs of the states. He favored a nine-year term for members of the Senate, where the states would be equally represented. He wanted the state legislatures to pay their representatives in Congress, which, in turn, would have the power to veto state laws. He also sought to vest state legislatures with the power to select presidential electors, and he wanted the President to hold office for life. Broom faithfully attended the sessions of the Convention in Philadelphia, and spoke out several times on issues that he considered crucial, but he left most of the speechmaking to more influential and experienced delegates. [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] delegate [[William Pierce (politician)|William Pierce]] described him as "a plain good Man, with some abilities, but nothing to render him conspicuous. He is silent in public, but cheerful and conversable in private."&lt;ref name=NatArch/&gt;

==Later career==
After the convention, Broom returned to Wilmington, where in 1795 he erected a home near [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]] on the outskirts of the city. Broom's primary interest remained in local government. In addition to continuing his service in Wilmington's government, he became the city's first postmaster (1790–92).

For many years, he chaired the board of directors of Wilmington's Delaware Bank. He also operated a cotton mill, as well as a machine shop that produced and repaired mill machinery. He sold his mill property in 1802 to the [[DuPont]]s and it became the center of the DuPont manufacturing empire.  Broom was also involved in an unsuccessful scheme to mine bog iron ore. A further interest was [[internal improvements]]: [[toll road]]s, [[canal]]s, and [[bridge]]s. A letter to his son James in 1794 touches upon a number of these pursuits.

Broom also found time for philanthropic and religious activities. His long-standing affiliation with the Old Academy led him to become involved in its reorganization into the College of Wilmington, and to serve on the college's first [[Board of directors|Board of Trustees]]. Broom was also deeply involved in his community's religious affairs as a lay leader of the [[Holy Trinity Church (Old Swedes)|Old Swedes Church]].

He died at the age of 57 in 1810 while in Philadelphia on business and was buried there at [[Christ Church Burial Ground]].&lt;ref name=NatArch&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_founding_fathers_delaware.html The Founding Fathers: Delaware], National Archives, accessed 2010-11-21&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cenotaph]] was placed in his honor at the Christ Episcopal Church by the Delaware State Society, NSDAR, in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{FAG|11831771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
His home near the [[Brandywine Hundred|Brandywine]], the [[Jacob Broom House]], was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1974.

Broom Street in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/odd/archives/002071.asp |title=Odd Wisconsin Archives |publisher=Wisconsinhistory.org |date=2006-03-29 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeffrey David Sachs''' ({{IPAc-en|s|æ|k|s}}; born November 5, 1954) is an American [[economist]], public policy analyst, and former director of [[the Earth Institute]] at [[Columbia University]], where he holds the title of [[University Professor (Columbia)|University Professor]], the highest rank Columbia bestows on its faculty. He is known as one of the world's leading experts on economic development and the fight against poverty.

Sachs is the Quetelet Professor of Sustainable Development at Columbia's [[School of International and Public Affairs]] and a professor of health policy and management at Columbia's [[Columbia Mailman School of Public Health|School of Public Health]]. As of 2017, he serves as special adviser to the [[United Nations]] (UN) [[United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] [[António Guterres]] on the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), a set of 17 global goals adopted at a UN summit meeting in September 2015. He held the same position under the previous UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-Moon]] and prior to 2016 a similar advisory position related to the earlier [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs),&lt;ref name="UCL"&gt;"[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/people/jeffrey-d-sachs Jeffrey D.

Retrieved 2017-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt; eight internationally sanctioned objectives to reduce extreme poverty, hunger and disease by the year 2015. In connection with the MDGs, he had first been appointed special adviser to the UN Secretary-General in 2002 during the term of [[Kofi Annan]].&lt;ref name="UCL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;Shaw, Adam (April 10, 2017).

"Guterres’ spokesman Stephane Dujarric confirmed&amp;nbsp;... this week that Jeffrey Sachs, a world-renowned economist who has served as a senior U.N. adviser since 2002, will continue in that role."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Sachs became a member of the International Advisory Council of the Center for Social and Economic Research (CASE). He is co-founder and chief strategist of [[Millennium Promise|Millennium Promise Alliance]], a nonprofit organization dedicated to ending [[extreme poverty]] and hunger. From 2002 to 2006, he was director of the [[United Nations Millennium Project]]'s work on the MDGs. He is director of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network and co-editor of the [[World Happiness Report]] with [[John F. Helliwell]] and [[Richard Layard, Baron Layard|Richard Layard]]. In 2010, he became a commissioner for the [[Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development]], whose stated aim is to boost the importance of broadband in international policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadbandcommission.org/commissioners/Pages/default.aspx |title=Commissioners|accessdate=2017-07-18 |website=Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sachs has written several books and received many awards.

==Early life and education==
Sachs was raised in [[Oak Park, Michigan|Oak Park]], a suburb of [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], the son of Joan (née Abrams) and Theodore Sachs, a labor lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/13/us/theodore-sachs-labor-lawyer-72.html |title=Theodore Sachs Labor Lawyer, 72&amp;nbsp;– New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2001-03-13 |accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Oak Park High School (Michigan)|Oak Park High School]] and attended [[Harvard College]], where he received his bachelor of arts [[Latin honors|''summa cum laude'']] in 1976.&lt;ref name="CSD"&gt;[http://csd.columbia.edu/author/jsachs/ Jeffrey D. Sachs]". Earth Institute, Center for Sustainable Development. Columbia University. csd.columbia.edu. Retrieved 2017-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to receive his [[master of arts|MA]] and [[doctor of philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[economics]] from Harvard with his thesis titled ''Factor Costs and Macroeconomic Adjustment in the Open Economy: Theory and Evidence'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hollis.harvard.edu/?itemid=&amp;#124;library/m/aleph&amp;#124;003907491 | title = Factor Costs and Macroeconomic Adjustment in the Open Economy: Theory and Evidence | publisher = Harvard University Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was invited to join the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]] while still a Harvard graduate student.

== Academic career ==

=== Harvard University ===
In 1980 he joined the Harvard faculty as an assistant professor and was promoted to associate professor in 1982. A year later, at the age of 28, Sachs became a full professor of economics with tenure at Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia gets Star Professor from Harvard|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/05/nyregion/columbia-gets-star-professor-from-harvard.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the next 19 years at Harvard, he became the Galen L. Stone Professor of International Trade,&lt;ref name="ContempAuthors"&gt;"Jeffrey D. Sachs." ''Contemporary Authors Online''. Detroit: Gale, 2016. Retrieved via ''Biography in Context'' database, 2017-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt; director of the [[Harvard Institute for International Development]] at the [[Kennedy School of Government]] (1995–1999), and director of the Center for International Development (1999–2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2002/09/developmental-troubles.html |title=Developmental Troubles |date=September–October 2002 |work=Harvard Magazine. ''harvardmagazine.com'' |access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Columbia University ===
From 2002 to 2016 Sachs served as director of the Earth Institute of Columbia University,&lt;ref name="UCL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CSD"/&gt; a university-wide organization of more than 850 professionals from natural science and social science disciplines, with a common mission to address complex issues facing the Earth, in support of sustainable development. Sachs's classes are taught at the [[School of International and Public Affairs]] and the [[Columbia Mailman School of Public Health|Mailman School of Public Health]], and his course "Challenges of Sustainable Development" is taught at the undergraduate level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Undergraduate Program in Sustainable Development|url=http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sachs has consistently advocated for the expansion of university education on sustainable development. He helped to introduce the Ph.D. in sustainable development at Columbia University, one of the first Ph.D. programs of its kind in the U.S., and championed the new Masters of Development Practice (MDP), which led to a consortium of major universities around the world offering the new degree. The Earth Institute also guided the adoption of sustainable development as a new major at Columbia College.

Sachs's policy and academic works span the challenges of globalization, and include the relationship of trade and economic growth, the [[resource curse]] and extractive industries, public health and economic development, economic geography, strategies of economic reform, international financial markets, macroeconomic policy, global competitiveness, climate change, and the end of poverty. He has written or co-authored hundreds of scholarly articles and several books, including three bestsellers and a textbook on macroeconomics.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 2011 Sachs called for the creation of a third U.S. political party, the Alliance for the [[Radical center (politics)|Radical Center]].&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, Jeffrey R. (2011).

== Scholarship and commentary ==

===Advising in post-communist economies===
Sachs has worked as an economic adviser to governments in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the former [[Soviet Union]]. A trained [[macroeconomist]], he advised a number of national governments in the transition from [[communism]] or developmentalism to [[market economies]].

In 1985, when Bolivia was shifting from a dictatorship to a democracy through national elections, Sachs was invited by the party of Bolivian dictator Hugo Banzer to advise him on an anti-inflation economic plan to implement once he was voted to office. This stabilization plan centered around price deregulation, particularly for oil, as well as cuts to the national budget. Sachs stated that his plan could end Bolivian hyperinflation, which had reached up to 14,000%, in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = : Economic Possibilities for Our TimeThe End of Poverty|last = Sachs|first = Jeffrey D.|publisher = Penguin|year = 2005|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Banzer ultimately lost the race to the party of former elected president and traditionally developmentalist Victor Paz Estenssoro, Sachs's plan was still implemented through plans that excluded most of Paz's cabinet. Inflation quickly stabilized in Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Unsettling Statecraft: Democracy and Neoliberalism in the Central Andes|last = Conaghan and Malloy|first = |publisher = University of Pittsburgh Press|year = 1994|isbn = |location = Pittsburgh|page = 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Dallas Morning News|last = Bridges|first = Tyler|date = June 29, 1987|work = Bolivia Turns to Free Enterprise Among Hard Times|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Sachs advised Poland's [[anticommunist]] [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity movement]] and the government of Prime Minister [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]]. He wrote a comprehensive plan for the transition from central planning to a market economy, which became incorporated into Poland's reform program led by Finance Minister [[Leszek Balcerowicz]]. Sachs was the main architect of Poland's successful debt reduction operation. Sachs and IMF economist David Lipton advised the rapid conversion of all property and assets from public to private ownership. Closure of many uncompetitive factories ensued.&lt;ref name="Hardy 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardy|first=Jane|title=Poland's New Capitalism|year=2009|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Poland, Sachs was firmly on the side of rapid transition to "normal" capitalism. At first he proposed U.S.-style corporate structures, with professional managers answering to many shareholders and a large economic role for stock markets. That did not bode well with the Polish authorities, but he then proposed that large blocks of the shares of privatized companies be placed in the hands of private banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Doug Henwood]] |url=http://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/Sachs.html |title=Left Business Observer #111, August 2005 |publisher=Leftbusinessobserver.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there were some economic  [[shortages]] and [[inflation]], but prices in Poland eventually stabilized.&lt;ref name="Foreign Affairs"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeffrey Sachs and David Lipton |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19900601faessay5998/jeffrey-sachs-david-lipton/poland-s-economic-reform.html |title=Lipton, David and Sachs, Jeffrey.

Sachs's ideas and methods of transition from central planning were adopted throughout the transition economies. He advised [[Slovenia]] (1991) and [[Estonia]] (1992) in the introduction of new stable and convertible currencies. Based on Poland's success, he was invited first by Soviet president [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and then by Russian president [[Boris Yeltsin]] on the transition to a market economy. He served as adviser to Prime Minister [[Yegor Gaidar]] and Finance Minister Boris Federov during 1991–93 on macroeconomic policies.

===Work on global economic development===
More recently, Sachs has turned to global issues of [[economic development]], [[poverty alleviation]], [[health policy|health and aid policy]], and [[environmental sustainability]]. He has written extensively on [[climate change]], [[public health|disease control]], and [[globalization]]. Since 1995, he has been engaged in efforts to alleviate poverty in Africa.

[[File:Sachs at UN.jpg|thumb|Sachs at a UN meeting, 2009]]

In his 2005 work, ''[[The End of Poverty]]'', Sachs wrote, "Africa's governance is poor because Africa is poor." According to Sachs, with the right policies and key interventions, [[extreme poverty]]—defined as living on less than $1 a day—can be eradicated within 20 years. India and China serve as examples, with the latter lifting 300 million people out of extreme poverty during the last two decades. Sachs has said that a key element to accomplishing this is raising aid from $65 billion in 2002 to $195 billion a year by 2015. He emphasizes the role of geography and climate, as much of Africa is landlocked and disease-prone. However, he stresses that these problems can be overcome.&lt;ref name="UNMP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/who/sachs.htm|title=United Nations Millennium Project, 2006|publisher=Unmillenniumproject.org|date=2007-01-01|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party inline|date=July 2015}}

Sachs suggests that with improved seeds, irrigation, and fertilizer, the [[crop yields]] in Africa and other places with [[subsistence farming]] can be increased from 1 ton per hectare to 3 to 5 tons per hectare. He reasons that increased harvests would significantly increase the income of subsistence farmers, thereby reducing poverty. Sachs does not believe that increased aid is the only solution. He also supports establishing [[microcredit|credit and microloan programs]], which are often lacking in impoverished areas.&lt;ref name="UUNCDF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncdf.org/english/microfinance/pubs/newsletter/pages/2005_04/news_sachs.php |title=Booth, Mindy. UN Capital Development Fund, 2005 |accessdate=2008-07-22 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608125335/http://www.uncdf.org/english/microfinance/pubs/newsletter/pages/2005_04/news_sachs.php |archivedate=June 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sachs advocates the distribution of free [[bed nets|insecticide-treated bed nets]] to combat [[malaria]]. The economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa $12 billion per year. Sachs estimates that malaria can be controlled for $3 billion per year, thus suggesting that anti-malaria projects would be an economically justified investment.&lt;ref name="Medical News Today"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/74907.php|title=Medical News Today, 2007|publisher=Medicalnewstoday.com|date=2007-06-24|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Millennium Villages Project]], which he directs, operates in more than a dozen African countries and covers more than 500,000 people. The MVP has engendered considerable controversy associated as critics have questioned both the design of the project and claims made for its success.  In 2012 ''[[The Economist]]'' reviewed the project and concluded "the evidence does not yet support the claim that the millennium villages project is making a decisive impact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/feastandfamine/2012/05/jeffrey-sachs-and-millennium-villages?zid=295&amp;ah=0bca374e65f2354d553956ea65f756e0|title=Jeffrey Sachs and the millennium villages: Millennium bugs|accessdate=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have pointed to the failure to include suitable controls that would allow an accurate determination of whether the Projects methods were responsible for any observed gains in economic development. A 2012 ''Lancet'' paper claiming a 3-fold increase in the rate of decline in childhood mortality was criticized for flawed methodology, and the authors later admitted that the claim was "unwarranted and misleading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/06/24/does-it-take-a-village|title=Does It Take a Village?|date=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sachs works closely with the [[Islamic Development Bank]] to scale up programs of integrated rural development and sustainable agriculture among the bank's member countries. One such project supports pastoralist communities in Eastern Africa, with six participating nations: [[Djibouti]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Somalia]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], and [[South Sudan]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Following the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), in 2000, Sachs was among the leading academic scholars and practitioners on the MDGs.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} He chaired the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health (2000–01), which played a pivotal role in scaling up the financing of health care and disease control in the low-income countries to support MDGs 4, 5, and 6. He worked with UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] in 2000–2001 to design and launch [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]].&lt;ref name="Mountains Beyond Mountains"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kidder|first1=Tracy|title=Mountains Beyond Mountains|date=2003|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=257|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked with senior officials of the [[George W. Bush administration]] to develop the PEPFAR program to fight [[HIV/AIDS]], and the PMI to fight [[malaria]]. On behalf of Annan, from 2002 to 2006 he chaired the [[UN Millennium Project]], which was tasked with developing a concrete action plan to achieve the MDGs. The UN General Assembly adopted the key recommendations of the UN Millennium Project at a special session in September 2005. The recommendations for rural Africa are currently being implemented and documented in the Millennium Villages, and in several national scale-up efforts such as in Nigeria.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Presently a special adviser to secretary-general [[António Guterres]],&lt;ref name="UCL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaw"/&gt; Sachs is an advocate for the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals, which build upon and supersede the MDGs.

In his capacity as a special adviser at the UN, Sachs has frequently met with [[diplomat|foreign dignitaries]] and [[heads of state]]. He developed a friendship with international celebrities [[Bono]] and [[Angelina Jolie]], who traveled to Africa with Sachs to witness the progress of the Millennium Villages.&lt;ref name="Stars"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.looktothestars.org/news/139-sachs-appeal---who-is-jeffrey-sachs|title=Purcell, Myrlia. Look to the Stars: The World of Celebrity Giving, 2006|publisher=Looktothestars.org|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sachs has consistently criticised the [[International Monetary Fund]] and its policies around the world, and blamed international bankers for what he claims is a pattern of ineffective investment strategies.&lt;ref name="FT1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uv.es/~fores/AcosoTextual/sachsbio.html|title=Sachs, Jeffrey. The Financial Times, 1997|publisher=Uv.es|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Greek government-debt crisis]] in July 2015, Sachs, with [[Heiner Flassbeck]], [[Thomas Piketty]], [[Dani Rodrik]] and [[Simon Wren-Lewis]], published an open letter to the Chancellor of Germany, [[Angela Merkel]], regarding Greek debt.&lt;ref name="FT2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/offener-brief-von-oekonomen-an-angela-merkel-jetzt-ist-der-zeitpunkt-die-gescheiterte-sparpolitik-zu-ueberdenken/12021886.html|title=Jetzt ist der Zeitpunkt, die gescheiterte Sparpolitik zu überdenken|publisher=tagesspiegel.de|date=2015-07-07|accessdate=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sachs is one of the founders of the [[Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project]].&lt;ref name=NYT120115&gt;{{cite news|author1=Justin Gillis|title=A Path Beyond the Paris Climate Change Conference|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/01/science/beyond-paris-climate-change-talks.html|accessdate=1 December 2015|work=The New York Times|date=1 December 2015|quote=Dr. Sachs helped start what is perhaps the most serious effort to draw up a detailed road map for the energy transition: the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project, based in Paris and New York. Over the past couple of years, the effort enlisted teams from 16 countries, which account for the large majority of global emissions, to devise such plans.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, he supported President [[Donald Trump|Trump]]'s view that  the [[United States]] should come out of [[Syria]] "very soon," adding: "It’s long past time for the United States to end its destructive military engagement in Syria and across the Middle East, though the security state seems unlikely to let this happen."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2018/04/05/trump-right-about-syria-time-leave/pG9aYO3yp1zFDIDy45A29O/story.html Trump is right about Syria: It’s time to leave], April 05, 2018, Jeffrey Sachs, [[The Boston Globe]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Sachs's economic philosophies have been the subject of both praise and criticism. One of Sachs's strongest critics is [[William Easterly]], a professor of economics at [[New York University]]. Easterly reproached ''[[The End of Poverty]]'' in his review for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and Easterly's 2006 book ''White Man's Burden'' is a response to Sachs's argument that poor countries are stuck in a "[[poverty trap]]" from which there is no escape except by massively scaled-up foreign aid. Sachs himself has emphasized the need for a multifaceted approach to economic development, of which increased and responsible foreign aid is nearly always a necessary part.&lt;ref name="The End of Poverty"&gt;Sachs, Jeffrey (2005). ''The End of Poverty''&lt;/ref&gt; Easterly presents statistical evidence that he claims proves that many [[emerging markets]] attained their higher status without the large amounts of foreign aid Sachs proposes.&lt;ref name="WPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25562-2005Mar10.html |title=A Modest Proposal |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2005-03-13 |accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nina Munk]], author of the 2013 book ''The Idealist: Jeffrey Sachs and the Quest to End Poverty'', says that poverty eradication projects endorsed by Sachs, although well intended, have - years later - "left people even worse off than before".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/episode/2013/09/10/the-quest-to-end-poverty-nina-munk/ |title=Anna Maria Tremonti, "The Quest to End Poverty: Nina Munk", CBC Radio, 2013-09-10 |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2013-09-10 |accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Paul Theroux]], commenting on Sachs's $120 million effort to aid Africa, says these temporary measures failed to create sustaining improvements but only "created dependence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424053111903747504579185800700741812.html?mod=BOL_hp_highlight_1#articleTabs_article%3D0|title=Africa's Aid Mess|date=Nov 30, 2013|author=Paul Theroux|newspaper=Barron's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Flagkarmapa.svg|right|thumb|Karmapa's flag]]
The '''Karmapa''' (honorific title ''[[His Holiness]] the Gyalwa'' (རྒྱལ་བ་, Victorious One) ''Karmapa'', more formally as ''Gyalwang'' (རྒྱལ་དབང་ཀརྨ་པ་, King of Victorious Ones) ''Karmapa'', and informally as the ''Karmapa Lama'') is the head of the [[Karma Kagyu]], the largest sub-school of the [[Kagyu]] (བཀའ་བརྒྱུད, {{bo|w=bka' brgyud}}), itself one of the four major schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. 

The historical seat of the Karmapas is [[Tsurphu Monastery]] in the [[Doilungdêqên County|Tolung valley]] of [[Tibet]]. The Karmapa's principal seat in exile is the Dharma Chakra Centre at [[Rumtek Monastery]] in [[Sikkim]], [[India]]. His regional monastic seats are [[Karma Triyana Dharmachakra]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [http://www.dhagpo.org/en/ Dhagpo Kagyu Ling] in Dordogne, [[France]].

Due to a controversy within the Karma Kagyu school over the recognition process, the identity of the current 17th Karmapa is disputed by some. See [[Karmapa controversy]] for details.

==Origin of the lineage==
[[Düsum Khyenpa, 1st Karmapa Lama]] ({{bo|w=Dus gsum Mkhyen pa}}, 1110–1193), was a disciple of the Tibetan master [[Gampopa]]. A talented child who studied Buddhism with his father from an early age and who sought out great teachers in his twenties and thirties, he is said to have attained [[bodhi|enlightenment]] at the age of fifty while practicing [[dream yoga]]. He was henceforth regarded by the contemporary highly respected masters Shakya Śri and Lama Shang as the Karmapa, a manifestation of [[Avalokiteśvara]], whose coming was predicted in the ''[[Samadhiraja Sutra]]''&lt;ref&gt;Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche. [http://www.rinpoche.com/samadisutra.html King of Samadhi Sutra: Oral commentaries given in Rinpoche's monastery in Boudhanath, Nepal, January 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhistinformation.com/lankavatara_sutra.htm The Lankavatara Sutra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113184106/http://www.buddhistinformation.com/lankavatara_sutra.htm |date=2006-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The source of the oral lineage, traditionally traced back to the Buddha [[Vajradhara]], was transmitted to the Indian master of [[mahamudra]] and [[tantra]] called [[Tilopa]] (989-1069), through [[Naropa]] (1016–1100) to [[Marpa Lotsawa]] and [[Milarepa]]. These forefathers of the Kagyu (Bka' brGyud) lineage are collectively called the "Golden Rosary".

[[Karma Pakshi, 2nd Karmapa Lama]] (1204–1283), is often said to be the first person ever recognized and empowered as a [[tulku]] ({{bo|w=sprul sku}}), a reincarnated [[lama]] (bla ma).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/wiki/renaissanceold/Karmapa.html |title=Karmapa Concept Encyclopedia Analysis |publisher=Collab.itc.virginia.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black Crown==
The Karmapas are the holders of the [[Black Crown]] ({{bo|w=Zhwa-nag}}) and are thus sometimes known as "the Black Hat Lamas". This crown ({{bo|w=rang 'byung cod pan}} "self-arisen crown"), is traditionally said to have been woven by the [[dakini (Buddhism)|dakinis]] from their hair and given to the Karmapa in recognition of his spiritual realization. The physical crown displayed by the Karmapas was offered to [[Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama]] by the [[Yongle Emperor]] of China as a material representation of the spiritual one.

The crown was last known to be located at [[Rumtek Monastery]] in [[Sikkim]], the last home of the [[16th Karmapa]], although that location has been subject to some upheaval since 1993 causing some to worry as to whether or not it is still there. An inventory of items remaining at Rumtek is purported to be something the Indian government is going to undertake in the near future.

'''Katherine Edwina "Kay" Francis''' (née '''Gibbs''', January 13, 1905&amp;nbsp;– August 26, 1968) was an American stage and [[Cinema of the United States|film]] actress.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', August 28, 1968, page 63.&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief period on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the late 1920s, she moved to film and achieved her greatest success between 1930 and 1936, when she was the number one female star at the [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] studio and the highest-paid American film actress.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Osborne|Osborne, Robert]]. Introduction to ''King of the Underworld'', [[Turner Classic Movies]] (18 September 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Some of her film-related material and personal papers are available to scholars and researchers in the [[Wesleyan University]] Cinema Archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyan.edu/cinema|title=The Wesleyan Cinema Archives|publisher=Wesleyhan.edu|accessdate=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Francis was born in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma Territory]] (present-day [[Oklahoma]]), in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;The 1910 census lists 1905 as her birth year.&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents, Joseph Sprague Gibbs and his actress wife Katharine Clinton Francis,&lt;ref name="wwb"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bubbeo|first1=Daniel|title=The Women of Warner Brothers: The Lives and Careers of 15 Leading Ladies, with Filmographies for Each|date=2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786462360|pages=86–98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OfwMkz8vpIgC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=%22Katherine+Edwina+Gibbs%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjip_C--tXWAhWF0YMKHcJjDg4Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Katherine%20Edwina%20Gibbs%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been married in 1903; however, by the time their daughter was four, Joseph had left the family. Francis inherited her unusual height from her father, who stood 6 feet 4 inches. She was to become Hollywood's tallest leading lady (5&amp;nbsp;ft 9 in) in the 1930s.

While she never discouraged the assumption that her mother was the pioneering American businesswoman who established the "[[Gibbs College|Katharine Gibbs]]" chain of vocational schools, Francis was actually raised in the hardscrabble theatrical circuit of the period. In reality, her mother had been born in Nova Scotia, Canada, and eventually became a moderately successful actress and singer under the stage name Katharine Clinton.

Francis was often out on the road with her mother, and attended [[Catholic schools]] when it was affordable, becoming a student at the Institute of the Holy Angels at age five.&lt;ref&gt;enumerated on May 28, 1910 (Ancestry.com)&lt;/ref&gt; After also attending Miss Fuller's School for Young Ladies in [[Ossining (village), New York|Ossining, New York]] (1919) and the Cathedral School (1920), she enrolled at the Katharine Gibbs Secretarial School in New York City. At age 17, Francis became engaged to a well-to-do [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]] man, James Dwight Francis. Their December 1922 marriage at New York's Saint Thomas Church ended in divorce.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Stage career==
In the spring of 1925, Francis went to Paris to get a divorce. While there, she was courted by a former [[Harvard]] athlete and member of the [[Boston Bar Association]], Bill Gaston. Francis and Gaston saw each other only on occasion; he was in Boston and Francis had decided to follow her mother's footsteps and go on the stage in New York. She made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB name|80097}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[Characters in Hamlet|Player Queen]] in a modern-dress version of Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' in November 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{ibdb title|9941|Hamlet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis claimed she got the part by "lying a lot, to the right people". One of the "right" people was producer [[Stuart Walker (film-maker)|Stuart Walker]], who hired Francis to join his Portmanteau Theatre Company, and she soon found herself commuting between [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Cincinnati]], playing wisecracking secretaries, saucy French floozies, walk-ons, bit parts, and heavies.

By February 1927, Francis returned to Broadway in the play ''Crime''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ibdb title|10244|Crime}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sylvia Sidney]], although a teenager at the time, had the lead in ''Crime'' but would later say that Francis stole the show.

After Francis' divorce from Gaston, she became engaged to a society playboy, Alan Ryan Jr. She promised Ryan's family that she would not return to the stage&amp;nbsp;– a promise that lasted only a few months before she was back on Broadway as an [[aviator]] in a [[Rachel Crothers]] play, ''Venus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ibdb title|10529|Venus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis was to appear in only one other Broadway production, a play called ''Elmer the Great'' in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{ibdb title|10720|Elmer the Great}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written by [[Ring Lardner]] and produced by [[George M. Cohan]], the play starred [[Walter Huston]]. He was so impressed by Francis that he encouraged her to take a screen test for the [[Paramount Pictures]] film ''[[Gentlemen of the Press]]'' (1929). Francis made this film and the [[Marx Brothers]] film ''[[The Cocoanuts]]'' (1929) at Paramount's [[Kaufman Astoria Studios|Astoria Studios]] in [[Astoria, Queens]], New York.

==Film career==
[[File:Kay-francis-trailer.jpg|thumb|299px|Kay Francis in trailer for ''[[The House on 56th Street]]'' (1933)]]
By that time, major film studios, which had formerly been based in New York, were already well-established in California, and many [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actors had been enticed to travel west to [[Hollywood]] to make sound films, including [[Ann Harding]], [[Aline MacMahon]], [[Helen Twelvetrees]], [[Barbara Stanwyck]], [[Humphrey Bogart]], and [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]]. Francis, signed to a contract with [[Paramount Pictures]], also made the move and created an immediate impression. She frequently co-starred with [[William Powell]], and appeared in as many as six to eight movies a year, making a total of 21 films between 1929 and 1931.

Francis's career flourished in spite of a slight, but distinctive, [[Rhotacism (speech impediment)|speech impediment]] (she pronounced the letters "r" and "l" as "w") that gave rise to the nickname "Wavishing Kay Fwancis".

Francis' career at Paramount changed gears when [[Warner Bros.]] promised her star status at a better salary. She appeared in [[George Cukor]]'s ''[[Girls About Town (film)|Girls About Town]]'' (1931) and ''[[24 Hours (1931 film)|24 Hours]]'' (1931). After Francis' career skyrocketed at Warner Bros., she would return to Paramount for [[Ernst Lubitsch]]'s ''[[Trouble in Paradise (film)|Trouble in Paradise]]'' (1932).

In 1932, Warner Bros. persuaded both Francis and Powell to join the ranks of Warners stars, along with [[Ruth Chatterton]]. In exchange, Francis was given roles that allowed her a more sympathetic screen persona than had hitherto been the case—in her first three featured roles she had played a villainess. For example, in ''[[The False Madonna]]'' (1932), she played a jaded society woman nursing a terminally ill child who learns to appreciate the importance of hearth and home. On December 16, 1931, Francis and her co-stars opened the [[Paramount Theatre (Oakland, California)|Paramount Theatre]] in [[Oakland, California]], with a gala preview screening of ''The False Madonna''.

===Mainstream successes===
From 1932 through 1936, Francis was the queen of the Warners lot, and increasingly, her films were developed as star vehicles. By the mid-thirties, Francis was one of the highest-paid actors, according to [[IMDb]], to the tune of, by 1935, earning a yearly salary of $115,000 (compared to [[Bette Davis]] with $18,000) in the United States. From the years 1930 to 1937, Francis appeared on the covers of 38 film magazines, the most for any adult performer and second only to [[Shirley Temple]], who appeared on 138 covers during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slide|first=Anthony|title=Inside the Hollywood Fan Magazine: A History of Star Makers, Fabricators, and Gossip Mongers|year=2010|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson|isbn=978-1-60473-413-3|page=131|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hDG6auRCJ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis had married writer-director [[John Meehan (screenwriter)|John Meehan]] in New York, but soon after her arrival in Hollywood, she consummated an affair with actor and producer [[Kenneth MacKenna]], whom she married in January 1931.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} When MacKenna's Hollywood career foundered, he found himself spending more time in New York, and they divorced in 1934.

Francis frequently played long-suffering heroines, in films such as ''[[I Found Stella Parish]]'', ''[[Secrets of an Actress]]'', and ''[[Comet Over Broadway]]'', displaying to good advantage lavish wardrobes that, in some cases, were more memorable than the characters she played—a fact often emphasized by contemporary film reviewers. Francis' [[clotheshorse]] reputation often led Warners' producers to concentrate resources on lavish sets and costumes, designed to appeal to [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era female audiences and capitalize on her reputation as the epitome of chic, rather than on scripts.

Eventually, Francis herself became dissatisfied with these vehicles, and began openly to feud with Warners, even threatening a lawsuit against them for inferior treatment. This, in turn, led to her demotion to [[B-movies|programmers]], such as ''[[Women in the Wind]]'' (1939), and, in the same year, to the termination of her contract.

The Independent Theatre Owners Association paid for an advertisement in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' in May 1938 that included Francis, along with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Mae West]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], and others, on a list of stars dubbed "[[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]".&lt;ref name="life19380516"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20oEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=XjWspoIvpF&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=Box-office Busts | work=Life | accessdate=September 8, 2012 | pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her release from Warners, Francis was unable to secure another studio contract. [[Carole Lombard]], one of the most popular stars of the late 1930s and early 1940s (and who had previously been a supporting player in Francis' 1931 film, ''Ladies' Man''), tried to bolster Francis' career by insisting Francis be cast in ''[[In Name Only]]'' (1939). In this film, Francis had a supporting role to Lombard and [[Cary Grant]], but recognized that the film offered her an opportunity to engage in some serious acting. After this, she moved to [[character actor|character]] and supporting parts, playing catty professional women – holding her own against [[Rosalind Russell]] in ''The Feminine Touch'', for example – and mothers opposite rising young stars such as [[Deanna Durbin]]. Francis did have a lead role in the Bogart gangster film ''[[King of the Underworld (1939 film)|King of the Underworld]]'', released in 1939.

===World War II era===
[[File:Kay Francis loc.png|left|thumb|225px|Kay Francis and Mitzi Mayfair pose in faux-Army style uniforms after a [[United Service Organizations|USO]] tour]]
With the start of [[World War II]], Francis did volunteer work, including extensive war-zone touring, which was first chronicled in a book attributed to fellow volunteer [[Carole Landis]], ''[[Four Jills in a Jeep]]'', which became a popular 1944 film of the same name, with a cavalcade of stars and [[Martha Raye]] and [[Mitzi Mayfair]] joining Landis and Francis to fill out the complement of Jills.

Despite the success of ''Four Jills'', the end of the war found Francis virtually unemployable in Hollywood. She signed a three-film contract with [[Poverty Row]] studio [[Monogram Pictures]] that gave her production credit as well as star billing. The results – the films ''Divorce'', ''Wife Wanted'', and ''Allotment Wives'' – had limited releases in 1945 and 1946. Francis spent the remainder of the 1940s on the stage, appearing with some success in ''[[State of the Union (play)|State of the Union]]'' and touring in various productions of plays old and new, including one, ''Windy Hill'', backed by former Warners colleague [[Ruth Chatterton]]. Declining health, aggravated by an accident in 1948 in which she was badly burned by a radiator, hastened her retirement from show business.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Personal life==
{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=My life? Well, I get up at a quarter to six in the morning if I'm going to wear an evening dress on camera. That sentence sounds a little ga-ga, doesn't it? But never mind, that's my life ... As long as they pay me my salary, they can give me a broom and I'll sweep the stage. I don't give a damn. I want the money ... When I die, I want to be cremated so that no sign of my existence is left on this earth. I can't wait to be forgotten.|source = — From Kay Francis's private diaries, ''c.'' 1938.&lt;ref name="The Kay Francis Papers" /&gt; }}

Francis married five times. Her diaries, preserved in an academic collection at [[Wesleyan University]], paint a picture of a woman whose personal life was often in disarray.&lt;ref name="The Kay Francis Papers"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kay Francis Papers|url=http://www.wesleyan.edu/cinema/collections/francis.html|publisher=Wesleyan Cinema Archives|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She regularly socialized with homosexual men, one of whom, [[Anderson Lawler]], was reportedly paid $10,000 by [[Warner Bros.]] to accompany her to Europe in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann|first=William J.|title=Behind the Screen: How Gays and Lesbians Shaped Hollywood, 1910–1969|year=2001|publisher=Viking|location=New York|isbn=0670030171|pages=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Francis was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] and underwent a [[mastectomy]], but the cancer had spread and proved fatal. Having no living immediate family members, Francis left more than $1,000,000 to [[The Seeing Eye]], which trains [[guide dog]]s for the blind. She died in 1968, aged 63, and her body was immediately [[cremated]]; her ashes were scattered.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11703">'''Khaleel Mohammed''' is a Guyanese-born professor of [[Religion]] at [[San Diego State University|San Diego State University (SDSU)]], in [[San Diego, California]], a member of Homeland Security Master's Program, and a core faculty member of SDSU's [http://www.cias.sdsu.edu Center for Islamic and Arabic Studies].

==Biography==
Khaleel Mohammed was born in Guyana. He studied Islamic law at Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. After completing an MA in Judaism and Islam at Concordia University, Montreal, he pursued a PhD in Islamic law at McGill University in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/misfit-at-the-mosque-1.141646 Misfit in the mosque, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Mohammed's specialties are Islam, [[Islamic Law]], and Comparative Religion. His research interests include [[Islam]]ic and [[Arabic studies]], [[Islamic law]] (classical and modern), comparative religion, [[Jewish]]/[[Christian]]/Islamic encounter, [[Qur'anic exegesis]] (classical and modern), [[hadith]], gender/sex issues and [[Islamic sexual jurisprudence|sexuality]] in Islam, terrorism, [[antisemitism in Islam]], [[Arab-Israeli relations]], and [[Liberalism and progressivism within Islam|reform in Islam]]. He is a proponent of [[Interfaith marriage in Islam|inter-faith marriage]] (between Muslim women and non-Muslim men) without the traditionally required conversion of the non-Muslim spouse, and is a registered marriage-officiant.

Mohammed teaches courses on [[World Religions]], [[The Qur'an]], Religious Violence and Non-Violence, Sex and Gender in Islam, and [[Abrahamic Religions]].[http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/courses_khaleel_mohammed.htm courses_khaleel mohammed]

Mohammed has testified as an "[[expert witness]]" for the prosecution in cases involving allegations of [[terrorism]]-related activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2013/03/13/07-10457.pdf UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/19/preemptive-prosecution-muslims-cointelpro|title=The FBI's anticipatory prosecution of Muslims to criminalize speech|author=[[Glenn Greenwald]]|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2014-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged Islamophobia==
Khaleel Mohammed has stated that in some cases foreign-born [[Imam]]s "are a threat to Canada" and that "They come from Bangladesh, South Africa, Guyana, Egypt and Syria etc. and they bring their cultural baggage with them."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206070641/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=604855a0-7b9c-4519-a841-f4736d59eaa1|title=The scathing scholar|date=2007-12-06|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also suggested that the fact that immigrants native languages are used in Canadian mosques is a problem and that "They (Canadian imams) have to speak English...All mosques I've been to -- give or take five per cent -- have been using an overwhelming amount of Arabic".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Mohammed has been both praised and lambasted by far right and [[Zionism|Zionist]] publications such as [[Campus Watch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/1232|title=The dissenting Muslim: SDSU's Khaleel Mohammed looks to the Quran for his controversial thesis: Palestine belongs to the Jews. - Campus Watch|website=www.campus-watch.org|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  He has appeared in "Obsession: Radical Islam’s War With the West,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jihadwatch.org/2017/11/san-diego-state-university-professor-khaleel-mohammed-on-robert-spencer-satanic-ignoramus|title=San Diego State University professor Khaleel Mohammed on Robert Spencer: "Satanic ignoramus"|website=www.jihadwatch.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; a film widely criticized as Islamophobic and produced by the far right [[Clarion Project]].

He states that he was once accused of being racist, for having stated that "95% of contemporary Muslims are exposed to [[anti-Semitic]] teachings".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=13587|title=FrontPage Magazine - The Koran and the Jews|accessdate=2014-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has received hate mail for his statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=604855a0-7b9c-4519-a841-f4736d59eaa1|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206070641/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=604855a0-7b9c-4519-a841-f4736d59eaa1|archivedate=2007-12-06|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2007-02-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teachings on Israel ===
Mohammed attracted attention for a 2004 interview in which he stated that Sura 5 verse 21 of the [[Qur'an]], and the [[medieval]] [[exegetes]] of the Qur'an, say that [[Israel]] belongs to the [[Jews]]. He translates it thus:
:"[Moses said]: O my people! Enter the Holy Land which God has written for you, and do not turn tail, otherwise you will be losers."

Mohammed says of Israel, "It's in the Muslim consciousness that the land first belonged to the Jews. It doesn't matter if the Jews were exiled 500 years or 2000 years, the Holy Land, as mentioned in Quran belongs to Moses and his people, the Jews."&lt;ref name=judd&gt;Handler, Judd. "The dissenting Muslim". San Diego Jewish Journal, August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
He states that the issues about the land of Israel ought not to be settled via references to scripture, but rather by the use of human rights legislation.

[[Image:Leib Yaffe2.jpg|thumb|Leib Yaffe]]
'''Leib Yaffe''' (born 1876) ({{lang-he|אריה לייב יפה }}) was a [[Hebrew]] poet, journalist and editor of [[Haaretz]] newspaper.

''' 'Mamilov`s''' ([[Ingush language|ING.]] – Mamil-nakan – Ingush [[teip]]) is an [[Ingush people|Ingush]] clan. The clan comprises about 1,500 people. It is one of a few Ingush clans whose members share one name.
 
They come from the village of [[Erzi (rural locality)|Erzi]] [[Dzheyrakhsky District]] [[Republic of Ingushetia|Ingushetia]] (since 2000 a part of the State Nature Reserve "Erzi").
At this time, they live mostly in [[Malgobeksky District]] and Dzheyrakhsky District of Ingushetia.

Ingush local historian and [[ethnographer]] [[Akhriev, Chakh Elmurzievich|Chakh Akhriev]] describes the origins:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Kist – the son of a famous [[Syrian]] the owner of the house Kamen (Comnenus), during the first [[Crusades]] moved from [[Syria]] and [[Abkhazia]], and hence, after a while, went to the [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. But Georgia was at that time in the sad state of constant attacks [[Arabs]] and [[Turkey|Turkish]], so that Kist was forced to run away from here into impregnable [[Caucasus Mountains]] and lived in one of the gorges [[North Caucasus]], near the headwaters of [[Terek River|Terek]] and ... His son Chard (according to some – Cha) was also the son Chard. The latter was built in Arzi (Erzi) 16 "siege" towers and castles that exist at the present time. After Chard followed by his direct descendants: Oedipus, Elbiaz and the sons of the last  Manuel (Mamil) and And (Yand). After the death of Manuel (Mamil) his son Daurbek  quarreled with his uncle And, left Kist society and moved to a nearby, Dzherahovskoe society.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The clan has a relationship with Yandiev and Dakhkilgov clans.

The Mamilova belonged to the 19th-century tower complex Erzi bronze figure of an eagle, made at the end of the 8th century to the [[Arab Caliphate]], known as the "[[Suleymans Eagle]]" and considered one of the symbols of Ingushetia.

'''José Joaquim de Campos da Costa de Medeiros e Albuquerque''' (September 4, 1867 – June 9, 1934) was a Brazilian [[poet]], [[politician]], [[teacher]], journalist, [[short story]] writer, [[civil service|civil servant]], essayist, orator, [[novelist]] and dramatist. He is famous for writing the lyrics of the [[Brazilian Republic Anthem]] in 1890.

He founded and occupied the 22nd chair of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]] from 1897 until his death in 1934.

He was also the President of the Academy in 1923.

==Life==
Albuquerque was born in 1867 in [[Recife]], [[Pernambuco]], the son of Dr. José Joaquim de Campos de Medeiros e Albuquerque. Initially homeschooled by his mother, he studied at the [[Colégio Pedro II (Rio de Janeiro)|Colégio Pedro II]] and later in [[Lisbon]]. Returning to Brazil, he studied [[natural history]] with [[Émil Goeldi]] and was tutored by [[Sílvio Romero]]. He initially worked as a primary teacher, getting in contact with famous writers such as [[Francisco de Paula Ney]] and [[Pardal Mallet]]. In 1889 he published his first poetry books: ''Pecados'' and ''Canções da Decadência'', of strong [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] influence.

In 1888 he worked for the newspaper ''Novidades'' alongside [[Alcindo Guanabara]], defending [[Abolitionism|Abolitionist]] ideals. With the [[República Velha|proclamation of the Republic in Brazil]], he was nominated a secretary by [[Aristides Lobo]] and a minister by [[Benjamin Constant Botelho de Magalhães]]. From 1890 onwards he became a teacher for the [[Escola Nacional de Belas Artes]] and wrote the lyrics of the [[Brazilian Republic Anthem]].

He was a convicted atheist for most of his life, but he converted to [[catholicism]] later in life.

During his last years of life, he would write for many newspapers, using [[pen name]]s such as '''Armando Quevedo''', '''Atasius Noll''', '''J. dos Santos''', '''Max''' and '''Rifiúfio Singapura'''.

He died in 1934.

[[File:Milenko Stojković.jpg|thumb|Stojković]]
'''Milenko Stojković''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Миленко Стојковић}}; 1769, Kličevac, [[Požarevac]] &amp;ndash; 1831) was a [[Serbian revolution]]ary and ''[[bimbaša]]'' in the First Serbian Uprising early in the 19th century.  He is most famous for executing four [[dahije]] (renegade janissaries) tyrants during the start of the [[First Serbian Uprising]], in vengeance for the "[[Slaughter of the Knezes]]".

Having apprehended and, while running away, Milenko executed the Turkish tyrants Aganlija, Kucuk Alija, Mula Jusuf and Mehmed Focic, responsible for the killing of Serbian Princes that triggered the First Serbian Uprising, on the island of [[Ada Kaleh]] on the River Danube.

'''Mohammed Kazem Yazdi''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: محمد کاظم یزدی) (born 1831)&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Iranian Constitutional Revolution and the Clerical Leadership of Khurasani|author=Farzaneh, M.M.|date=2015|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=9780815653110|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IIP3CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA214|page=214|accessdate=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a prominent [[Twelver]] [[Shia]] [[Marja']] centered in [[Najaf]], most famous for his anti-constitutionalist stand during the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] of 1905–1911. He is said to have at first reflected the attitude of the "piously apolitical [[ulama]]" and refused to take a stand in favor of the Constitution despite insistent pressure by pro-Constitution talebs, but then opposed the Constitution siding with [[Sheikh Fazlollah Noori]] when Noori's son came to Najaf to enlist clerical support.

In the ensuing reaction against the politicized students in Najaf and the execution of Noori, Yazdi was supported by his Arab followers, the Ottoman governor, and the group known as the "Army of God" (''jond Allah''). His victory over the Constitutionalists and their clerical leader [[Mohammad-Kazem Khorasani]] was "complete," with Yazdi emerging as "the undisputed master of the Holy Cities." According to secular historian [[Ahmad Kasravi]], several thousand would pray behind Yazdi at [[salat]] but only 30 or so prayed behind his rival Khorasani.&lt;ref&gt;*[https://books.google.com/books?id=IQci1YIffjYC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52 The Turban for the Crown: The Islamic Revolution in Iran By Said Amir Arjomand]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activity==
He disagreed with [[Akhund Khorasani]] in terms of constitutionalism. He thought, in contrary to Akhund Khorasani who allowed a pragmatic approach to constitutionalism, that [[Usuli|Usulism]] does not allow to act freely in supporting constitutionalism. He thought that politics is beyond his expertise and therefore did not take part in politics.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; while Akhund Khorasani was an eminent [[Marja']] in [[Najaf]], many imitators prayed behind the kazem Tabataei and it shows that he was an eminent figure along with Akhund Khorasani in religious authority.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mantle of the Prophet|author=Mottahedeh, R.|date=2014|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=9781780747385|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YlsQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT118|accessdate=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words both Mohammad Kazem and Khorasani had constituted a great Shia school in Najaf although they had different views in politics at the same time.&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Iraq: The ancient sites and Iraqi Kurdistan|author1=Hann, G.|author2=Dabrowska, K.|author3=Greaves, T.T.|date=2015|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=9781841624884|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-9RNCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA292|page=292|accessdate=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; when khorosani died Yazdi elected as supreme Marja.

'''Noureddine Zekri''' (born in [[Batna City|Batna]]) is an [[Algeria]]n [[manager (association football)|football manager]] and former player who most recently managed [[Al-Wakrah Sport Club|Al-Wakrah]] in [[Qatar Stars League]].

Zekri previously managed [[MC Alger]] in the [[Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 1]] before resigning on July 10, 2011.&lt;ref name="resign"&gt;[http://www.dzfoot.com/news-9479/l1-mca-zekri-s-en-va-thiessen-nouvel-entraineur/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managerial career==
Zekri gained his coaching badges, a UEFA A License, in Italy's famous football coaching centre, the [[Coverciano|FIGC Settore Tecnico Coverciano]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.settoretecnico.figc.it/news.aspx?c=3&amp;sc=15&amp;ssc=36&amp;n=537 SI E’ CONCLUSO IL CORSO “UEFA A” PER ALLENATORI DI SECONDA CATEGORIA]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brera Calcio ===
Zekri started coaching the newly born Milan-based team [[Brera Calcio]] in 2000 in [[Serie D]], but he was sacked shortly after and replaced with [[Walter Zenga]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2000/08/12/il-mio-brera-calcio-allarena-con-il.html&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Brera Calcio in 2005/2006 season and the following season he succeeded in getting the team promoted from [[Prima Categoria]] to [[Promozione]], resigning immediately after.

=== ES Sétif ===
On December 8, 2009, Zekri was announced as the coach of [[Algeria]]n club [[ES Sétif]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lebuteur.com/division-1/actualites/ess-noureddine-zekri-nouvel-entraineur-de-lentente Noureddine Zekri, nouvel entraîneur de l’Entente]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first season, Zekri won the [[2009–10 Algerian Cup|Algerian Cup]], the [[2009 North African Cup of Champions|North African Cup of Champions]] and the [[2010 North African Super Cup|North African Super Cup]].

However, On August 18, 2010, Zekri was sacked from his managerial position due to the poor results gained in the [[2010 CAF Champions League]] group stage, picking up just one point out of the first three group matches. The 1-0 loss against Zimbabwe side [[Dynamos F.C.|Dynamos]] was the final straw for [[ES Sétif]] president [[Abdelhakim Serrar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lebuteur.com/division-1/actualites/ess-cest-desormais-officiel-gianni-nouvel-entraineur |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820073307/http://www.lebuteur.com/division-1/actualites/ess-cest-desormais-officiel-gianni-nouvel-entraineur |archivedate=2010-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MC Alger===
On March 11, 2011, Zekri was appointed as the coach of [[MC Alger]], replacing outgoing [[France|Frenchman]] Alain Michel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dzfoot.com/news-8599/l1-noureddine-zekri-nouvel-entraineur-du-mca/ L1 : Noureddine Zekri nouvel entraineur du MCA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313141737/http://www.dzfoot.com/news-8599/l1-noureddine-zekri-nouvel-entraineur-du-mca/ |date=2011-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed a 16-month contract with the club. In his first game as manager, MC Alger lost 4-1 to [[Dynamos F.C.]] of [[Zimbabwe]] in the first round of the [[2011 CAF Champions League]]. However, the team managed to win the return leg 3-0 to qualify to the next round. On July 10, 2011, Zekri resigned from his position.&lt;ref name="resign"/&gt;

==Early life, education, and medical career==
Broun was born in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], the son of Gertrude Margaret (née Beasley) and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Georgia State Senate|Georgia state senator]] [[Paul Collins Broun, Sr.]] (1916–2005), who represented [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]] and the surrounding area from 1963 to 2001.&lt;ref name="sixty-five"&gt;{{cite web|title=Members Of The General Assembly Of Georgia - Term 1965-1966|publisher=State of Georgia|url=http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/cgi-bin/govdimag.cgi?path=dbs/1965/ga/s700/_ps1/g4/1965_h66/sess_p1_sno_p1.con/&amp;user=galileo&amp;sessionid=637f8586-1547653717-5036&amp;serverid=DU&amp;instcode=afpl&amp;return=ggpd%3fuserid%3dgalileo%26dbs%3dggpd%26action%3dretrieve%26recno%3d70%26numrecs%3d100%26__rtype%3drecno%26key%3dy-ga-bs700-b-ps1-bg4-b1965-h66-bsess-p1-sno-p1|date=February 1965|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandfather was a minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/broun.htm |title=broun |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broun is a graduate of [[Clarke Central High School|Athens High School]] and the [[University of Georgia]] at Athens (B.S., Chemistry, 1967) and earned his [[Doctor of Medicine]] (1971) from the [[Medical College of Georgia]] in [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=B001262 |title=BROUN, Paul C., Jr. – Biographical Information |publisher=Bioguide.congress.gov |date=May 14, 1946 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[medical internship|internship]] was at [[Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center|Good Samaritan Hospital]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] and [[medical residency|residency]] at [[UAB Hospital|University Hospital]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. He then practiced general medicine; starting in 2002 he maintained a practice based solely on [[house call]]s.

==Early campaigns==
Broun first ran for public office in 1990, challenging Democratic U.S. Congressman [[Richard Ray]], of [[Georgia's 3rd congressional district]]. Ray defeated him 63%–37%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=33815 |title=GA District 3 Race – Nov 6, 1990 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broun ran again in 1992, but lost in the Republican primary to State Senator [[Mac Collins]], 55%–45%. Broun won five of the district's seventeen counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=364834 |title=GA District 3 – R Primary Race – Jul 21, 1992 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins went on to defeat Ray, 55%–44%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=27826 |title=GA District 3 Race – Nov 3, 1992 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Democratic U.S. Senator [[Sam Nunn]] decided to retire. Broun was one of six Republicans who ran for the Republican nomination [[United States Senate election in Georgia, 1996|in the race]]. Broun finished fourth, with 3% of the vote. [[Guy Millner]], a businessman, finished first with 42% of the vote. He won the run-off election against state representative [[Johnny Isakson]],&lt;ref name=fec&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe1996/senate.htm|title=1996 U.S. Senate Results|publisher=Federal Elections Commission|accessdate=2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=174301 |title=GA US Senate – R Primary Runoff Race – Aug 6, 1996 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had received 35% of the vote in the primary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=174300 |title=GA US Senate – R Primary Race – Jul 9, 1996 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; then lost the general election to Democrat [[Max Cleland]] by one percentage point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=163 |title=GA US Senate Race – Nov 5, 1996 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections===
;2007
{{Main|Georgia's 10th congressional district special election, 2007}}
In February 2007, Republican U.S. Congressman [[Charlie Norwood]], of [[Georgia's 10th congressional district]], died of cancer. Broun announced his candidacy before Dr. Norwood passed. There was a special election open primary in June 2007, where candidates of all parties participated in the primary. A candidate needed 50% to win outright, and there would be a run-off if no candidate earned it the first time. Ten candidates filed: six  Republicans, three Democrats, and a Libertarian. State Senator [[Jim Whitehead (politician)|Jim Whitehead]] was the only elected politician to run, and was the front-runner. He won the endorsement of Senator [[Saxby Chambliss]] (R-GA).

In the primary, Whitehead finished first with 44% of the vote. Broun qualified for the run-off, ranking second with 21% of the vote, with only 198 votes more than third-place finisher James Marlow, a Democrat. Broun won a plurality of just four counties: [[Oconee County, Georgia|Oconee]] (47%), [[Jackson County, Georgia|Jackson]] (42%), [[Oglethorpe County, Georgia|Oglethorpe]] (37%), and [[Morgan County, Georgia|Morgan]] (31%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sos.georgia.gov/elections/election_results/2007_0619/026.htm |title=6/19/2007 – U.S. Representative, District 10 |publisher=Sos.georgia.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=343830 |title=GA – District 10- Special Election Race – Jun 19, 2007 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the runoff campaign, Whitehead angered some voters by failing to appear at a debate held in Athens and then by referring to his [[alma mater]], the University of Georgia, as a "liberal bastion" that should be eliminated, save for the football team.&lt;ref name=cq&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/cq/2007/07/24/cq_3155.html |work=Congressional Quarterly |publisher=The New York Times |title=Georgia Conservative Broun Fulfills House Dreams With Special Win |last=Kapochunas |first=Rachel |date=July 24, 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the July 17, 2007 election, Broun upset Whitehead by a margin of just 0.8%, a difference of just 394 votes. After the votes were certified, Whitehead declined to ask for a recount despite the narrow margin.&lt;ref name=cq/&gt; Broun won the counties in the Northern part of the district, while Whitehead won the counties in the southern part. Broun's best two performing counties were [[Clarke County, Georgia|Clarke]] (90%) and Oconee (88%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=373459 |title=GA – District 10- Special Election Runoff Race – Jul 17, 2007 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2008
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Georgia, 2008#District 10}}
Broun was challenged by Republican State Representative and House Majority Leader [[Barry Fleming]], who had endorsed Whitehead in the 2007 election. Broun defeated Fleming in the July 2008 primary, 71%–29%. He won every county in the district. However, his weakest performance was in the Southeastern part. He won counties like Richmond with just 52% and Columbia with just 58%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=384606 |title=GA District 10 – R Primary Race – Jul 15, 2008 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the general election with 61% to 39% against Democrat Bobby Saxon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=387950 |title=GA – District 10 Race – Nov 4, 2008 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2010
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Georgia, 2010#District 10}}
Broun won re-election to a second full term, defeating Democrat Russell Edwards, 67%–33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=488731 |title=GA – District 10 Race – Nov 2, 2010 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/results/house | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | title=House Results Map|accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2012
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Georgia, 2012#District 10}} In November 2011, Republican [[Mac Collins]], who had represented much of Middle Georgia in Congress a decade earlier, said he was likely to challenge Broun in 10th District, newly redrawn because of redistricting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Athens Banner-Herald]] |url=http://www.macon.com/2011/10/01/1726216/transportation-unity.html |title=Political Notebook: Transportation unity; CAO Thomas leaving |date=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, Collins decided he would not challenge Broun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ajc.com/political-insider-jim-galloway/2012/05/19/mac-collins-says-he-won%E2%80%99t-run-against-paul-broun/|title=Mac Collins says he won’t run against Paul Broun |date=May 19, 2012|author=Jim Galloway |publisher=Atlanta Journal-Constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, Broun won the Republican primary, defeating retired Army officer Stephen Simpson. Broun faced no Democratic candidate in the November general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Broun Wins Georgia 10th Congressional District GOP Primary |agency=Associated Press|date= July 31, 2012 |url=http://www2.wspa.com/news/2012/jul/31/broun-wins-georgia-10th-district-gop-congressional-ar-4248323/ |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A leaked video of a speech given at Liberty Baptist Church Sportsman's Banquet on September 27, 2012, shows Broun telling supporters that, "All that stuff I was taught about evolution and embryology and the Big Bang Theory, all that is lies straight from the pit of Hell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/07/nation/la-na-nn-paul-broun-evolution-hell-20121007|title=U.S. Rep. Paul Broun: Evolution a lie 'from the pit of hell'|date=Oct 7, 2012|accessdate=2016-10-25|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Broun also believes that the world is less than 9,000 years old and was created in six literal days. In response to these remarks, coupled with Broun being on the [[House Science Committee]], libertarian radio talk show host [[Neil Boortz]] spearheaded a campaign to run the English naturalist and evolutionary theorist [[Charles Darwin]] against Broun, with the intention of drawing attention to these comments from the scientific community and having Broun removed from his post on the House Science Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/17/paul-broun-charles-darwin_n_1974054.html|title=Paul Broun, Charles Darwin Face Off: Republican Faces Odd Write-In Opponent In Georgia House Race|date=Oct 17, 2012|accessdate=2012-10-21|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broun won re-election on November 6, 2012, receiving 209,917 votes across the district.  Charles Darwin received about 4000 [[write-in ballot]]s in [[Athens-Clarke County, Georgia|Athens-Clarke County]] as protest votes against Broun's views on evolution, while Broun received 16,980 votes in that county.&lt;ref name=abh-darwin&gt;Jim Thompson, [http://onlineathens.com/election/2012-11-08/charles-darwin-gets-nearly-4000-write-votes-athens-against-rep-broun Charles Darwin gets 4,000 write-in votes in Athens against Paul Broun], [[Athens Banner-Herald]], November 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ap-darwin&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/charles-darwin-earns-4000-write-in-votes-against-creationist-ga-congressman/2012/11/08/71e9b888-29fb-11e2-aaa5-ac786110c486_story.html Charles Darwin earns 4,000 write-in votes against creationist Ga. congressman], [[Associated Press]], November 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

;2016
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Georgia, 2016#District 9}} In 2016, Broun announced his candidacy for Congress, running for [[Georgia's 9th congressional district]], a district that one political journal ranked as the third-most-conservative in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cookpolitical.com/file/2013-04-49.pdf |title=Partisan Voting Index, Districts of the 113th Congress|publisher=The Cook Political Report |date= |accessdate=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broun ran in a five-candidate Republican primary race with fellow Tea Party challengers Roger Fitzpatrick, Bernie Fontaine and Mike Scupin, against [[incumbent]] candidate [[Doug Collins (politician)|Doug Collins]], who held the 9th seat since 2012. In the May primary, Collins won with 52,943 votes (61.3 percent of the vote), over Broun's 18,761 votes (22 percent), Fitzpatrick's 8,942 votes (10.5 percent), Scupin's 2,854 votes (3.36 percent), and Fontaine's 2,338 votes (2.75 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlineathens.com/mobile/2016-05-24/paul-broun-fails-bid-congressional-seat |title=Paul Broun fails in bid for congressional seat|publisher=onlineathens.com |date=2016-05-25 |accessdate=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===
On July 25, 2007, Broun was sworn in by [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Nancy Pelosi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlineathens.com/stories/072607/news_20070726055.shtml "Broun sworn in"], OnlineAthens.com, July 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On January 3, 2013, Broun declined to vote for [[John Boehner]]'s re-election as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]], instead nominating outspoken Florida Representative [[Allen West (politician)|Allen West]], even through West lost his bid for re-election in November 2012 and was no longer a member of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Moody (January 3, 2013), [https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/john-boehner-elected-speaker-house-190301689--politics.html John Boehner re-elected as speaker of the House] ''[[Yahoo News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Politico]] reporter Charlie Mahtesian, Broun has "a flair for the provocative."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/blogs/charlie-mahtesian/?ml=bl_cm Who are the Boehner resisters?] ''[[Politico]]'' January 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Broun is a political [[Christian right|conservative Christian]]. In May 2009, Broun proposed legislation that would have proclaimed 2010 "The Year Of The Bible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0509/22832.html |title=Lawmaker wants to make 2010 'Year of the Bible' |publisher=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] |date=May 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also introduced a bill to ban the sale or rental of sexually explicit materials on U.S. military installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.5821 |title=Bill Text – 110th Congress (2007-2008) – THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Broun and 91 co-sponsors introduced H.J.Res.89, a proposition for the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]]. The proposed amendment to the [[United States Constitution]] would define marriage as "as consisting only of the union of a man and a woman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-hj89/show|title=H.J.Res.89: Marriage Protection Amendment|date=May 22, 2008|publisher=OpenCongress.org|accessdate=2009-07-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614005619/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-hj89/show|archivedate=June 14, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Roger Wicker]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Mississippi|MS]]) and eight other senators introduced a proposition for the amendment with S.J.Res.43 on June 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:S.J.RES.43:|title=S.

Broun's voting record is [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]] receiving a 96% rating from the [[National Taxpayers Union]] and supports a [[Balanced budget amendment|balanced-budget amendment]] to the constitution.  Broun supports an amendment that would require a two-thirds majority in congress to raise revenues and require that all excess revenue to be returned to the American taxpayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broun.house.gov/balancedbudget/ |title=Congressman Paul Broun, M.D |publisher=Broun.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/70001/paul-broun#.UKmTWIdQXQ8 |title=Paul Broun – Ratings and Endorsements – Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Broun also voted against the [[stimulus bill|American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] and decries the high cost of the bill.&lt;ref name="thepoliticalguide1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/Profiles/House/Georgia/Paul_Broun/Views/The_Economy/ |title=Paul Broun – The Economy |publisher=Thepoliticalguide.com |date=December 15, 2008 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Broun signed [[Americans for Prosperity]]'s "No Climate Tax" pledge, promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.&lt;ref&gt;http://americansforprosperity.org/noclimatetax//wp-content/uploads/2008/10/broun.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Broun, in September 2008, voted against the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] which created the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]], or "TARP".&lt;ref&gt;[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll674.xml FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 674], [[Clerk of the United States House of Representatives]], September 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Broun voted against the [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] of 2009.&lt;ref name="thepoliticalguide1"/&gt;

Broun supports the repeal of [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|ObamaCare]], and has argued for less sweeping approaches to health care reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broun.house.gov/healthcarebill/brounbill.htm |title=Congressman Paul Broun, M.D |publisher=Broun.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; His proposal involves a 100% tax deduction of healthcare costs, allowing consumers to shop for health insurance across state lines, and the privatization of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jilani |first=Zaid |url=http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2009/10/26/66139/broun-privatize-medicare/ |title=Rep.

On January 3, 2013, Broun introduced the [[Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2013 (H.R. 24; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would direct the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) to prepare, within 12 months of enactment, an audit of the [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]] and the [[Federal Reserve Banks]].&lt;ref name=cbo24&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO – H.R. 24|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45717|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MarcosAudit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marcos|first1=Cristina|title=House passes bill to audit the Federal Reserve|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/218047-house-passes-bill-to-audit-the-federal-reserve|accessdate=17 September 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broun said that "this is a vital piece of legislation that will help to usher in a new era of transparency in this nation's monetary policy."&lt;ref name="MarcosAudit"/&gt; Broun argued that because Congress created the Federal Reserve, "it must therefore be subject to the oversight and regulation of Congress."&lt;ref name="MarcosAudit"/&gt;

Broun supported efforts to defund Obamacare during the October, 2013 [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|U.S. federal government shutdown]], calling it "a stand for principles that would lead to prosperity for all Americans as they fought to dismantle the president's health care law." According to Broun, "It was the fight that Americans had been waiting and hoping for...the majority of Americans applauded our efforts and encouraged us to stand strong",&lt;ref&gt;Paul C. Broun, ''The Augusta Chronicle'', October 26, 2013 [http://chronicle.augusta.com/opinion/opinion-columns/2013-10-26/fight-defeat-obamacare-was-worth-it-and-heres-why], "The fight to defeat Obamacare was worth it—and here's why"&lt;/ref&gt; although a CBS News poll reported that 72 percent of Americans disapproved of shutting down the federal government over differences on the Affordable Care Act.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Dutton, Jennifer De Pinto, Anthony Salvanto and Fred Backus, CBS News, October 3, 2013 [http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57605822/poll-americans-not-happy-about-shutdown-more-blame-gop/], "Poll: Americans not happy about shutdown; more blame GOP"&lt;/ref&gt;

Broun has argued for continued U.S. support of Israel on both strategic and theological grounds, saying, "It's absolutely imperative that we support Israel—our brothers and sisters in the Middle East—not only because of the geopolitical reasons there, which are strong enough in themselves, but because of a promise God made to Abraham."&lt;ref&gt;Georgia Senate Candidate Paul Broun: Support Israel Or God Will Curse America

He obtained a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] in Sociology, before completing his post-graduation at the [[University of Lubumbashi]] in 1993. He then completed [[Master of Science|M.Sc.]] in [[Political Science]] from the [[Panthéon-Assas University]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="Virunga_2011"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.virunganews.com/content/view/1996/2/ |title= Rwanda: Pierre Damien Habumuremyi appointed as new Prime Minister.| date = 2011-06-10 | publisher=Virunga News | accessdate=2012-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He earned a Ph.D. in Political Science from the [[University of Ouagadougou]] in 2011.

== Career ==

Pierre Habumuremyi started his career as an academic, serving as the assistant professor at the [[National University of Rwanda]] from 1993 to 1999, and also served as a lecturer at the Kigali Independent University and the Kigali Lay Adventist University during 1997-1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.primature.gov.rw/the-prime-minister.html | title = The Prime Minister | accessdate = 2012-11-21 | publisher = PMO Rwanda }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he also worked as a project coordinator at German Technical Assistance programme (GTZ Kigali) during 1995-1997 and a Senior Project Manager for the [[Catholic Relief Services]] during 1997-2000.&lt;ref name="Virunga_2011"/&gt;

From 2000 to 2003, he was the Deputy Executive Secretary of the [[Elections in Rwanda|National Electoral Commission]] of Rwanda, after which he served as the Executive Secretary until 2008.&lt;ref name="Virunga_2011"/&gt; Habumuremyi was elected as one of Rwanda's nine representatives in the [[East African Legislative Assembly]] on 11 May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Felly Kimenyi, [http://mail.newtimes.co.rw/news/index.php?i=14904&amp;a=6293 "Parliament elects Rwanda’s representatives to the EALA"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218215612/http://mail.newtimes.co.rw/news/index.php?i=14904&amp;a=6293 |date=2014-02-18 }}, ''The New Times'', 12 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded as Executive Secretary of the National Electoral Commission by Charles Munyaneza in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Ngabonziza, [http://allafrica.com/stories/200807300077.html "Former NEC boss leaves office"], ''The New Times'', 29 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierre-Damien Habumuremyi was subsequently appointed to the Rwandan government as Minister of Education in May 2011, replacing [[Charles Murigande]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/fr_fr/noticias/africa/2011/4/18/Remaniement-ministeriel-Rwanda-Premier-ministre-inchange,e348011a-0488-43a0-a8e9-510985fc675c.html "Remaniement ministériel au Rwanda, le Premier ministre inchangé"], Angola Press Agency, 7 May 2011 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed as Prime Minister on 6 October 2011. His appointment came as a surprise, given his relatively low profile on the political scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://dispatchrwanda.com/2011/10/26/new-prime-minister-damien-habumuremyi/ | title = New Prime Minister Damien Habumuremyi | date = 2011-10-26 | accessdate = 2012-11-21 | publisher = Rwanda Dispatch }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by Anastase Murekezi on 23 July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.umuseke.rw/anastase-murekezi-yagizwe-minisitiri-wintebe-mushya/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-07-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105046/http://www.umuseke.rw/anastase-murekezi-yagizwe-minisitiri-wintebe-mushya/# |archive-date=2014-08-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephen Tong Tjong Eng''' ({{zh|c=唐崇榮| p=Táng Chóngróng|j=tong4 sung4 wing4}}, born 1940) is a [[Chinese Indonesian]] [[Reformed]] pastor, [[evangelism|evangelist]], teacher and musician. He heads the [[Indonesian Reformed Evangelical Church|Reformed Evangelical Church of Indonesia]], which houses the [[megachurch]] [[Messiah Cathedral]], and is one of the largest Christian Reformed church facilities in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="christianpost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="improbable"/&gt; He has preached in countries around the world, and guest lectured at theological seminaries and schools.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Stephen Tong – In Step with The Holy Spirit, limited edition (Jakarta: STEMI)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Tong was born in 1940 in [[Xiamen]], China,&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;Tong, Stephen (2010). Dr. Stephen Tong: Life and Ministries in Pictures – 70 Years of Blessing 1940–2010, limited edition. Surabaya: Momentum Christian Literature.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} from the couples of Tong Pai Hu, a businessman whose family was highly regarded by the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] government,&lt;ref&gt;Memoar Solomon Tong – Conductor SSO (Surabaya: Jaring Pena, 2009), p. 9-13&lt;/ref&gt; and Tan Tjien Nio (Indonesian name: Dorcas Tanjowati).&lt;ref&gt;Freda Hatfield Tong ''Sons for the Master'', 65–67&lt;/ref&gt; He is the sixth of eight children,&lt;ref name=Tong /&gt; only one of whom was a girl.{{#tag:ref|The Tong family consisted of seven sons: Tony (Tong Tjong Po), Peter (Tong Tjong Ping), John (Tong Tjong Tjoe), Caleb (Tong Tjong Ming), Solomon (Tong Tjong An), Stephen (Tong Tjong Eng) and Joseph (Tong Tjong Hway). They also had one daughter, Mary (the eldest sister, died at young age). Five of the sons, including Stephen, became Christian ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Kwantes|2005|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} his father died when Stephen was 3; his family wealth had eroded during the years of [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese imperialism]].&lt;ref name=Freda&gt;Freda Hatfield Tong ''Sons for the Master'' (Singapore: Path Seeker Ltd., 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Tong's mother fostered their brothers and sister alone.&lt;ref&gt;Memoar Solomon Tong – Conductor SSO (Surabaya: Jaring Pena, 2009), p. 18-24&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, he with his mother and siblings migrated to [[Surabaya]], Indonesia, to find a better place of living during the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Communist Revolution]].&lt;ref name=Freda /&gt; He completed primary education at Min Guang Primary School and he graduated from Chung Hwa High School (中華高中學) in 1958.  Though he had not graduated yet, he had been teaching as either assistant or formal teacher from 1957 till 1960 at Zhong Guo Nui Xue School and Yi Xing Night School.&lt;ref name=Tong /&gt;{{rp|8}}

When Tong was 15 years old, he had strong beliefs in communism, which he called "[[Karl Marx]]'s dialectical materialism". He ascribed to [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[Darwinism|theory of evolution]], and had a deep hatred towards Christianity, which he regarded as "the foolish religion which came from the devilish West and has illogical teachings".&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Stephen Tong &amp; co, ''Serving My Times: Pictoral Story &amp; Ministries, limited edition'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; However, he respected that her mother had a devoted spiritual life: "When I was small, the first words I'd hear in the morning were those of my mother while she prayed. She prayed for each of us children by name, and asked God to guide us.".&lt;ref name="kwantes245"&gt;{{Harvp|Kwantes|2005|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, his mother asked him to attend a Christian Youth Conference that was conducted by the Southeast Asia Bible Seminary (SEABS) ({{lang-id|Madrasah Alkitab Asia Tenggara, now Seminari Alkitab Asia Tenggara}}, SAAT) in [[Malang]] in 1957. On 9 January, the last day of the conference, when [[Andrew Gih]] gave a revival sermon, Tong became a Christian.&lt;ref name="kwantes245-6"&gt;{{Harvp|Kwantes|2005|pp=245–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began to share the Gospel, and taught children in Christian schools. In 1960, he enrolled in SEABS,&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Stephen Tong, ''In Step with The Holy Spirit, limited edition'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; and later graduated with a [[Bachelor of Theology]] in 1964. He then joined SEABS's faculty, and taught theology and philosophy classes from 1964 to 1988.&lt;ref name= Tong /&gt;{{rp|8}}&lt;ref name="tokoh"/&gt;

== Ministry ==
While he was a teacher at SABS, Tong served as an evangelist at THKTKH ([[Min Nan]]: Tiong Hoa Kie Tok Kauw Hwee [中华基督教会]); ({{lang-id |Gereja Kristus Tionghua, now GKT (Gereja Kristus Tuhan)}}), transliterated "Church of Christ The Lord",&lt;ref name = "Kuiper"&gt;{{Citation | first = Arie | last = de Kuiper | title = Mulai Dari Musa Dan Segala Nabi | place = Jakarta | publisher = BPK Gunung Mulia | year = 1996 | page = 82}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and travelled weekly between Malang and Surabaya.&lt;ref group = "note"&gt;The distance between Malang and Surabaya is {{convert |200|km|mi| abbr =on}}.

DR. Stephen Tong | year = 2007 | accessdate = 20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around at that time, he had tried leading some Gospel Rallies in various cities in Indonesia. Then since 1969, he received invitations to lead Gospel Rallies in various countries, including Europe, America, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, etc. It is especially for Chinese and Indonesian speakers. In 1974, he started to hold seminars in Surabaya to provide truthful doctrinal understanding for churches in Indonesia.&lt;ref name=Tong /&gt;{{rp|9}}

In 1978, he along with [[Jahja Ling]] established Stephen Tong Evangelistic Ministries International (STEMI).&lt;ref name=Tong /&gt;{{rp|9}} One of its goals is to equip people for full-time ministry.&lt;ref name="instep4-6"&gt;Dr. Stephen Tong, ''In Step with The Holy Spirit, limited edition'' (Jakarta: STEMI, 2007), pp. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt; He preaches at cities across Southeast Asia.

In 1982, he received his [[Ordination#Christianity|ordination]] as pastor. He served at GKT ({{lang-id|Gereja Kristus Tuhan}}, "Church of Christ The Lord"), then ministered in GKA ({{lang-id|Gereja Kristen Abdiel}},  "Servant Christian Church").&lt;ref name="reformiert"/&gt; He has conducted services in Mandarin and Indonesian, but some of his speaking engagements have been in [[Min dialect|Fujian]] and English.&lt;ref name="tokoh"/&gt;

Since then, he has guest lectured in Theology and delivered sermons in various prominent universities at the [[China Graduate School of Theology]] (Hong Kong), [[China Evangelical Seminary]] (Taiwan), [[Trinity Theological College, Singapore|Trinity Theological College (Singapore)]], [[Regent College]] (Canada), and universities in the United States, including: [[Westminster Theological Seminary]], [[Harvard]], [[MIT]], [[Stanford]], [[Yale]], [[University of California Berkeley]], [[University of Maryland]], [[Columbia University]], [[Cornell University]], etc.&lt;ref name=Tong /&gt;{{rp|9}}

Since the GRII has found in 1998, his services have extended to many major cities in Indonesia, including Surabaya, Medan, Malang, Bandung, especially during the Christmas and Easter seasons.&lt;ref name="rally2010"&gt;{{cite web

Since 2000, he travels weekly to around 5 countries (Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Taiwan) to serve tirelessly for approximately 6000 audiences.&lt;ref name=Tong /&gt;{{rp|9}} In 2009, Ric Cannada, Chancellor of [[Reformed Theological Seminary]], noted in his school's newsletter that Tong's weekly preaching schedule included "two Sunday services in [[Jakarta]]; every Sunday evening at two services in a church in [[Singapore]]; every Monday evening at a church in [[Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia]]; every Tuesday night at a church in Hong Kong; and every Wednesday night at a church in [[Taipei, Taiwan]]."&lt;ref name="rtsnews2009"/&gt;

=== Reformed Evangelical Movement ===
Tong observed that many churches have been influenced by worldly philosophy, and ones that were loyal to the genuine teaching of the Bible were rare. In 1984, he started the Reformed Evangelical Movement with the purpose of restoring the understanding of theology based on God's revelation in the Scripture and igniting people with zeal for evangelism.{{qn|date=November 2012|reason=This sounds like a quote from an article, please cite source}} The movement is "aimed at meeting the challenge of the [[Charismatic movement]] as well as liberalism."&lt;ref name="griivisi"&gt;{{cite web | title = Sekilas Visi | work = ''grii.org'' | url = http://www.grii.org/grii-visi.htm | accessdate = 8 August 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080804015204/http://www.grii.org/grii-visi.htm | archivedate = 4 August 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He conducted theological seminars such as the Christian Faith Development Seminar ({{lang-id|Seminar Pembinaan Iman Kristen}}, SPIK),&lt;ref name="tokoh"/&gt; to introduce [[Reformed]] theology to the people in Jakarta. His first seminar, "Faith and Religion", was attended by about 1,200 people.{{citation needed|date=November 2012|reason=need source for number and event}} He would later adapt the seminars into [[#Bibliography|books]] and multimedia, which he publishes in-house.&lt;ref name="wtsprofessor"/&gt; The SPIK seminars have become the source material for the Indonesian Reformed Evangelical Institution ({{lang-id|Lembaga Reformed Injili Indonesia}}, LRII), a seminary which Tong co-founded with pastors Caleb Tong and Yakub Susabda in 1986.&lt;ref name="tokoh"/&gt;

In 1986, Tong started the Evangelical Reformed High School for [[layman|laymen]] in Surabaya. In 1987, he started a similar high school in Jakarta, and in 1990, he started one in Malang. The goal is to encourage Christian congregations from all denominations to study Calvinist theology.{{citation needed|date=November 2012|reason=need source for this goal statement}} He has served as a [[rector (academia)#Asia|rector]] for these schools.&lt;ref name="tokoh"&gt;{{cite web

=== Reformed Evangelical Church of Indonesia ===
{{main|Indonesian Reformed Evangelical Church}}
[[Image:Messiah Cathedral in Night.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Messiah Cathedral, captured from Kemayoran Street.]]
Stephen Tong founded the Reformed Evangelical Church of Indonesia in 1989 to establish a church based on [[Reformed]] theology and congregations that are committed to evangelism. He is currently the Head of Synod. Although the church subscribes to the [[Reformed Christian confessions of faith|Reformed confessions]], it also has its specific confessions of faith.&lt;ref name="griivisi"/&gt;{{elucidate|date=November 2012|reason=how is it different?}} In 2004, GRII had congregations in five Indonesian cities and has expanded to branch churches around the world in Asia, Australia, Germany, and North America.

'''Yang Teramat Mulia Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj ibni Almarhum Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah II''', ([[Jawi script|Jawi]]: تونكو عبدالرحمن ڤوترا الحاج ابن المرحوم سلطان عبدالحميد حاليم شه) {{post-nominals|list=[[Order of the Crown of the Realm|DMN]], [[Royal Family Order of Kedah|DK]], [[Kedah Supreme Order of Merit|DUK]], [[Order of Australia|AC]], [[Order of the Companions of Honour|CH]]}}; (8 February 1903 – 6 December 1990) was a Malaysian politician who served as the first [[Chief Minister]] of the [[Federation of Malaya]] from 1955 to 1957, before becoming Malaya's first [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] after independence in 1957. He remained Prime Minister following the formation of [[Malaysia]] in 1963, when [[Sabah]], [[Sarawak]], and [[Singapore]] joined the federation, until his resignation in 1970.

Commonly known simply as "Tunku" (a [[Malay styles and titles|Malay royal title]]), Tunku Abdul Rahman is widely regarded, even by his critics, as Malaysia's "[[Founding fathers|founding father]]", the architect of [[Federation of Malaya Independence Act 1957|Malayan independence]] and the [[Proclamation of Malaysia|formation of Malaysia]]. As such, he is often referred to as ''Bapa Kemerdekaan'' (Father of Independence) or ''Bapa Malaysia'' (Father of Malaysia).&lt;ref name=NYT_Obit&gt;{{cite news|title=Tunku Abdul Rahman, 87, Dead; First Prime Minister of Malaysia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/07/obituaries/tunku-abdul-rahman-87-dead-first-prime-minister-of-malaysia.html|accessdate=25 June 2015|work=[[New York Times]]|date=7 December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cheah_2002&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cheah|first1=Boon Kheng|title=Malaysia: The Making of a Nation|date=2002|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|location=Singapore|isbn=9812301542|pages=109–110|chapter=The Tunku as "Founding Father of the Nation"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Tunku Abdul Rahman was born on 8 February 1903, at Istana Pelamin Palace in Alor Setar, Kedah,&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Abdul Rahman Putra Alhaj, Tunku |edition=15th |year=2010|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, Illinois |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the seventh son and one of 45 children of [[Abdul Hamid Halim of Kedah|Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah]], the twenty-fifth ruler of the Kedah Sultanate. Tunku's mother was Che Manjalara (Nueang Nandanagara), a Thai, and the sixth wife of Sultan Abdul Hamid; she was the daughter of Luang Naraborirak (Kleb Nandanagara), a district officer in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michael Leifer|first1=Joseph Liow|title=Dictionary of the Modern Politics of Southeast Asia|date=20 November 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-62233-8|page=59|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=G5KLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=tunku+abdul+rahman+born+1903&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, [[cholera]] and [[malaria]] were very common all over Kedah and at least two of Tunku's brothers and his older sister died from cholera while Tunku himself suffered from intermittent attacks of malaria until he left for London in 1920.

He received early education at the Alor Setar Malay Primary School before furthering his studies at the government English school, [[Kolej Sultan Abdul Hamid|Sultan Abdul Hamid College]]. He and his fellow siblings were later sent by his parents to [[Debsirin School]] in Bangkok. He returned home in 1915 to continue his education at the [[Penang Free School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cuisine of the Premiers|date=2009|publisher=ITBM|isbn=978-9-830-68395-9|pages=19–20|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=QkW5Ng_axaYC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=tunku+abdul+rahman+born+1903&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University===
When Tunku was 17, he won the Kedah State Government scholarship to further his studies at [[Cambridge University]].&lt;ref name="biography1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.biography.com/people/tunku-abdul-rahman-9174103|title= Tunku Abdul Rahman biography|author= Biography.com|date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After about a year, Tunku realised that he was making very little progress in his studies. After a meeting with Mr. Ezekiel, his guardian, in the office of the [[Crown Agents]], Ezekiel arranged for Tunku to move to [[Cambridge]] and to be taught by and live with [[Basil Atkinson]]. Atkinson was an experienced tutor and he prepared Tunku to sit for university entrance examinations known as "[[Responsions|Little Go]]". The following year, he took the entrance exams and he obtained high marks for all his papers with a Pass for the whole examination. He was accepted as an undergraduate at [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge|St Catharine's College]], one of the colleges of the University of Cambridge and graduated with a bachelor's degree of Arts in Law and History in 1925.

Five years after sailing from Singapore, at the age of 23, he sailed home. The Crown agents secured Tunku a berth in a passenger ship, which stopped at [[Penang]]. Tunku Ibrahim, the Regent and his eldest brother, was unhappy with Tunku's choice of degrees and he ordered Tunku to return to England to be admitted to the [[English Bar]]. On Tunku's initiative, the Malay Society of Great Britain was formed, with Tuanku [[Abdul Rahman of Negeri Sembilan|Abdul Rahman]] of Negeri Sembilan (later the 1st [[Yang Di-Pertuan Agong]]) as President and Tunku Abdul Rahman of Kedah as Honorary Secretary and the driving force.  In May 1930, Tunku sat for Part One of the Bar examination. Although he managed to pass three papers, his failure in one paper resulted in him failing the whole examinations in Part One. Tunku sailed to Penang in January 1931. Since Tunku was on a State scholarship, he was automatically a government servant when he returned. Tunku Ibrahim, was still the regent and he told Tunku that he was in disgrace for failing the Bar examinations in London.

==Career in Kedah==
===Kulim===
In January 1931, Tunku was appointed a Cadet in the Kedah Civil Service.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; Later, he was transferred to [[Kulim]] as Assistant District Officer. In Kulim, Tunku devoted much of his time touring the district and getting to know the problems of the peasants who made up 90% of the population.  Tunku also devoted some of his time to prepare for Cadet's Law exam to qualify for promotion. He took the exams and passed it on his first attempt.

===Padang Terap===
About a year later, Tunku was promoted to be [[District Officer]] of [[Padang Terap]]. The post of District Officer Padang Terap was unpopular because [[Kuala Nerang]] was rife with malaria. As soon as Tunku took over the district, he gave orders for a survey to be made of the swamps which bordered the town, obtained an estimate for draining them and applied to the State Secretariat for the necessary funds. Unfortunately, Tunku's plea for funds were rejected. He wrote again to the State Secretariat, asking that funds be made available to drain the swamps and to rid Kuala Nerang of the main breeding place of the carriers of malaria. This time the money came and the work was carried out under Tunku's supervision.

===Langkawi===
Due to the fact that Tunku Ibrahim, the Regent, was known to be strongly opposed to mixed marriages and since there was a law in Kedah which forbade members of the royal family to marry non-Malays without the prior approval of the Ruler or Regent, the Tunku married [[Violet Coulson]] who lived in [[Penang]]. In 1934, the Regent died unexpectedly and was succeeded as Regent by Tunku Mahmud, the Sultan's younger brother, who was more broad-minded and gave consent to the marriage. This enabled Violet to move to [[Kuala Nerang]], but the Secretary to the Government showed his disapproval by transferring Tunku to the isolated post of District Officer at [[Langkawi]].

The district consisted of a group of islands, thinly populated, sparsely cultivated and without roads. When Tunku applied for government funds to develop Langkawi his application was rejected. Ever-resourceful, Tunku's genius in winning co-operation from members of the public of all communities led to the construction of a jetty and later to the opening of several earth roads using money and material which he collected.

===Sungai Petani===
The British advisor at the time, S.W. Jones made a visit to Langkawi and was so impressed by Tunku's initiative that he persuaded the Council of State to transfer and promote him to the post of District Officer of [[Sungai Petani]], the second most important district in Kedah. Tunku soon became the most popular District Officer Sungai Petani had ever known.

The Commissioner of Police in Kedah clashed with Tunku and called on the Secretary to the Government to complain about Tunku. This caused Tunku to be transferred to [[Kulim]] as District Officer.

==World War II and the Japanese occupation==
{{See also|Japanese occupation of Malaya}}

While in London, Tunku sat once more for the Bar Examinations, as he planned to leave the Civil Service and to enter private practice as soon as he had qualified as an advocate and solicitor. Tunku succeeded in passing the Part One Examination, in 1939.
However, with the advent of World War II, Tunku was recalled to [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and ordered to resume duty as District Officer in [[Kulim]], where he remained for the next three years.

He was responsible for the Civil Defence preparations implemented by district officers. Tunku was appointed Deputy Director of Air Raid Precautions for South [[Kedah]]. Tunku recognised the need to prepare for the evacuation of civilians in the event of invasion and in 1941 he gave orders for the constructions of six "Long Houses" made of round timber and with attap roofs on a low hill about two miles away from the town. Funds for this work had been refused by the State Secretariat and Tunku therefore invited donations from local town dwellers who would benefit if evacuations became necessary.

By October 1941, British troops had prepared defensive positions in North Kedah. On the morning of 8 December 1941, the [[Malayan Campaign|Invasion]] by the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]] began. The attack was quickly followed by the advance of [[Tomoyuki Yamashita|General Yamashita]]'s army which had landed unopposed on beaches near [[Songkla]] the previous night. A second assault force came ashore, unopposed, on the coast of Petani and advanced towards Betong and Kroh. A [[Battle of Kota Bharu|third but smaller force]] landed close to [[Kota Bahru]] in [[Kelantan]] despite vigorous opposition.

Unaware of the extent of the Japanese attack, Tunku went to his office and ordered general alert for his air wardens. Later that morning, he met the leading shopkeepers and advised them to evacuate their families to the "Long House".

Tunku's eldest surviving brother, [[Badlishah of Kedah|Tunku Badlishah]], had succeeded Tunku Mahmud as Regent in 1937 when the latter died. He was now in control, since [[Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah|Sultan Abdul Hamid]], although still alive, was incapacitated. At about 9 o'clock on the night of invasion, Syed Omar telephoned Tunku and told him that the Regent had decided to evacuate the [[Abdul Hamid Halim of Kedah|77-year-old Sultan]] to [[Penang]], and thence to [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]]. Tunku disagreed with this decision, feeling the need for the Sultan to remain with his people, he absconded with him during the journey. Soon after, the Japanese began bombing Penang.

===Occupation===
With the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese]]'s bombing [[Penang]], the Regent and his family fled. They were given accommodation in Sidim when the second and more severe bombing of Penang town took place on 11 December 1941, which caused hundreds of civilians to be killed. Upon returning, to [[Kulim]], Tunku found out that all the Police were no longer on duty. Tunku's first concern was to prevent looting and he called all members of the disbanded [[Kedah]] Volunteer Force in Kulim to come to his assistance. These men formed a vigilante corps and Tunku arranged for them to patrol the town at night. He was also responsible for the acquiring of emergency food stores from the Government Rice Mill at [[Bagan Serai]] in [[Perak]]. By 16 December 1941, the Japanese army had occupied the west coast of Kedah, including all the main towns.  The Japanese Military Governor of Kedah an assuming office appointed another of Tunku's brothers, Tunku Mohamed Jewa, to be a temporary Regent until the Sultan returned to [[Alor Setar]].

On 17 December, the Sultan, the Regent and his family and senior officers of the State Government set off for Alor Setar with a Japanese military escort. In Kulim, Tunku reluctantly remained as District Officer for another year as a servant to the Japanese Military Administration.

Friction between Tunku and the Japanese officials were frequent, and he was removed from his position of authority. The Siamese were then put in charge. Soon after the takeover by the Siamese, Tunku was appointed the Superintendent of Education.

In 1942, the Japanese transported thousands of young male Malayans to work on the construction of a [[Death Railway|railway]] from North [[Siam]] to [[Burma]]. Tunku helped house and feed some escapees from the railway construction project at considerable risk to himself.

On 6 and 9 August 1945, atom bombs were dropped on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] respectively. A week later, the Japanese Imperial government in Tokyo agreed to an [[Japanese surrender|unconditional surrender]].

===Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army movement (MPAJA)===
{{See also|Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army}}

When the Japanese surrender was announced over the wireless in mid-August, plans were hurriedly prepared in Ceylon for the dispatch of a British Military Administration. At the same time, the top Chinese Communist leaders in Malaya, [[Fong Chong Pik]], who was nicknamed "the Plen" and a young Chinese Rebel named [[Chin Peng]] decided to try seize control of the civil administration in as many states as possible. Tunku and his followers were responsible for the peace-keeping efforts and the protection of Alor Setar from the [[Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army]].

==Malayan Union and study leave==
=== Protest against Malayan Union ===
On 19 August, the surrender of the [[Japanese Imperial Army|Japanese Army]] had become common knowledge in [[Alor Setar]]. With the Japanese surrender, several groups of people talked about independence and discussed how it might be attained. Malay societies were formed all of the peninsular with similar objectives, but with no co-ordination. On 10 October 1945, the Secretary of State for the Colonies issued his Policy Statement on a "[[Malayan Union]]." In [[Kedah]], both the principal Malay organisations held protest meetings and rallies. Tunku spoke forcefully at these rallies, but he recommended opposition by peaceful means.

[[Harold MacMichael|Sir Harold MacMichael]], representing the British Government, arrived in [[Kuala Lumpur]] on 11 October 1945. He came to Alor Setar after visiting the Sultans of [[Sultan Ibrahim of Johor|Johor]], [[Musa Ghiatuddin Riayat Shah of Selangor|Selangor]], [[Sultan Abu Bakar of Pahang|Pahang]], and [[Sultan Abdul Aziz of Perak|Perak]] and securing their signatures to a new treaty. In [[Kedah]], MacMichael was told that the Ruler would consult his Council of State before holding a discussion with him. With these consultations proceeded, rallies and processions in opposition to the treaty were held in every district and in the center of Alor Setar. Tunku was one of the most popular speakers in [[Alor Setar]], [[Sungai Petani]], and [[Kulim]], but he was not invited to take part in any of the discussions convened by his half-brother, [[Sultan Badlishah of Kedah|Sultan Badlishah]]. After three days of negotiations the Sultan followed the example of his brother rulers. The Sultan's surrender was vigorously criticised by the public and by Tunku. MacMichael flew back to London after securing all the signatures from the rulers for the new treaty. Then the British Prime Minister announced that the Malayan Union would come into effect on 1 April 1946.

A British officer who had held Tunku's post before the war was appointed Superintendent of Education, Kedah in his place. The State Government did not give Tunku any new position. During this period, Tunku held no office in any Malay organisation.

===Law Studies===
Tunku applied for 18 months' study leave and arranged to return to England to resume his law studies. He arrived in [[Liverpool]] on 27 December 1946 and travelled by train to London, and remained there for the next 18 months.

When he passed all his law exams, Tunku sailed back to Malaya on the P.&amp;.O. Corfu in January 1949 to be met by his wife, children and friends in [[Penang]]. A few days later he called on the Secretary to the Government to inform him that he was now a qualified advocate and solicitor, but the reception was neutral. Tunku was instructed to report to the State Legal Advisor for duty as a deputy public prosecutor.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; His work was routine and he spent his days reading case files.

==Political career==
===United Malay National Organisation (UMNO)===
''Further information: [[United Malay National Organisation]]''

Tunku was invited to accept the chairmanship of the [[Kedah]] branch of UMNO, the political party which had been formed by [[Onn Jaafar|Dato' Onn Bin Jaafar]]. But before long, the Attorney-General, Fosters-Sutton, visited Kedah and met Tunku in his office to ask if he would like to take up a new appointment in [[Kuala Lumpur]], which Tunku accepted. In Kuala Lumpur, Tunku was allotted an office in the Federal Secretariat in Kuala Lumpur, together with other Deputy Public Prosecutors. Tunku's work received a favourable report and he was transferred with promotion, to the post of President of the Selangor Court. At the same time, political crisis was brewing in UMNO. When the Communist terrorists launched an armed rebellion from jungle bases, UMNO founder and president, Onn, felt the need for racial harmony and a non-communal political party.

A General Assembly was to be held in Kuala Lumpur in August 1951, and Onn had made it known that if his proposals were not accepted in this meeting, he would resign. Malay leaders while discussing the crisis recognised that they must find a successor to Onn. At that time, Tunku's qualities and ability as a leader were almost unknown outside Kedah. Finally, three candidates, including Tunku, were suggested to be nominated for the post of President if Onn stepped down. [[Abdul Razak Hussein|Abdul Razak]], the State Secretary of [[Pahang]] and UMNO deputy president went to meet Tunku in his house, to ask him to agree to the nomination, but Tunku was reluctant. Instead, Tunku replied that Razak himself was much better qualified to be nominated. But Razak convinced Tunku that he was much too young to gain the support of Malay masses.

After much persuasion, Tunku reluctantly accepted the nomination. The UMNO Assembly met on 23 August 1951, where Tunku received 57 votes and his nearest rival had 11. In his acceptance speech, Tunku demanded that independence should be granted to Malaya as soon as possible. Tunku was still President of the Sessions Court in Kuala Lumpur, with daily duties to perform drawing a government salary and living in government quarters. Tunku informed the Chief Justice of his intention to resign from government service.

In the eyes of the average UMNO member, Tunku was first and foremost the brother of the [[Sultan of Kedah]], and a member of a royal house, which carried some prestige within Malaya.  Tunku had acquired a wealth of experience as a district officer in Kedah, which enable him to understand and sympathise with the problems of the rural population, who made up a large proportion of the UMNO membership.

===Alliance Party===
''Further information: [[Alliance Party (Malaysia)|Alliance Party]]/[[Barisan Nasional]]''

At the time of [[Onn Jaafar]]'s resignation from the presidency of [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]], he had predicted that the party would disintegrate with in three months. But even before the end of that period, it became clear that although influential [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] and some prominent [[Malaysian Indian|Indians]] and Ceylonese had become members of Onn Jaafar's new party, very few Malays had done so. Tunku held and expressed the view that Malayan communities could not be united within a single political party. He believed that each community need its own political party and its own political leaders, and he was proven to be right. The first trial of strength between all the rival political parties took place in January 1952.

On 6 October 1951, [[Henry Gurney|Sir Henry Gurney]] was killed in an ambush by Communist terrorists. He was replaced by General [[Gerald Templer|Sir Gerald Templer]] who brought with him a new policy from the British Government in London. Templer was to guide the people of Malaya towards the attainment of a United Malayan Nation. The policy had also called for the partnership of all communities. To put this new policy into effect, the government had agreed to hold elections at the Municipal and Town Council level, as a first step towards a democratic government, and [[Kuala Lumpur]] was chosen as one of the venues for the experiment. All the existing political parties were prepared to contest.

One of these political organisation was the [[Malaysian Chinese Association|Malayan Chinese Association]], or MCA. MCA was brought into existence in 1949 by two men, [[Henry Lee Hau Shik|Colonel H. S. Lee]], the President of the Selangor Mining Association, and [[Tan Cheng Lock]] of Malacca. It occurred to him that if MCA and UMNO formed an alliance at the municipal level, their chances of success would be greater. Together with his deputy, they met and sought the approval of Dato' Yahaya, the Chairman of UMNO in Kuala Lumpur. They quickly reached an agreement. Under the chairmanship of Col. H. S. Lee, a combined committee from the MCA and UMNO was formed and 12 candidates were selected, one for each area, some Malays, some Chinese and one Indian. The committee then began a vigorous campaign to enlist support for "The Alliance".

News of the venture appeared in all the leading newspapers. Tunku was in [[Province Wellesley]] when he read the news. He received a telephone call from an UMNO leader in Kuala Lumpur asking him to come back at once for a discussion. On his way to meet the UMNO leaders in Kuala Lumpur, he saw a leading member of [[Independence of Malaya Party]], or IMP, and asked for his opinion of the "Alliance." Tunku was confronted by protesting political colleagues, but he told them that he supported the Alliance and Intended to help in the campaign in Kuala Lumpur.

At the counting of votes on 16 February 1952, the "Alliance" won nine seats, IMP, two and an Independent one. The success of UMNO-MCA alliance was repeated in other municipal and town council elections, starting in Johor Bahru, where, to the chagrin of Dato' Onn, the Alliance won all the seats.

Tunku followed up the Municipal elections by holding a 'Round Table Conference' on 3 February 1953, attended by leaders of the MCA and UMNO, in the Selangor Miner's Club, Kuala Lumpur. Everyone agreed to establish a permanent alliance of UMNO and MCA as a political body with Independence for Malaya as its principal objective.

They also discussed the possibility of forming a united front with Independence of Malayan Party, or the IMP. Tunku arranged a meeting with Onn. He brought H. S. Lee and [[Ismail Abdul Rahman|Dr Ismail]]. Onn brought three lawyers and two Malay civil servants. At the meeting, Onn told Tunku that IMP could only work together with the Alliance leaders if they disbanded the Alliance and joined IMP. Tunku tried to find some ground for compromise, but Onn was adamant and the meeting ended. Tunku disagreed fundamentally with Onn's conception of a single political party consisting of members of all communities. He knew by instinct that each community needed its own political party. The challenge that lay before him was finding a way to unite the communal parties. Soon, the Alliance leaders met again to discuss their campaign. They drew up proposals which included a request for an elected majority and a firm date for the first elections.

At the Legislative Council, when the demands by the Alliance were discussed, Onn told the Legislative Council that the holding of the elections should be planned as a gradual process and he questioned Tunku's demand. Onn's remarks were relayed to the Secretary of State and damaged Tunku's image.

===Meeting in London===
In August 1953, [[Gerald Templer]] offered Tunku a portfolio in the Government, but Tunku refused it. Earlier in July 1953, the government set up a working committee to examine the possibility of holding State and Federal Elections. The committee was set up after Templer obtained the concurrence of Malay Rulers who at first were quite reluctant to accept such proposals due to their deep-rooted fear of what might befall them if Independence were granted. When the names of the members of the Election Committee were announced, Tunku observed that a majority of them were [[Onn Jaafar]]'s supporters.

During the discussion, the members found themselves in two groups. The majority approved certain recommendations while [[Barisan Nasional|the Alliance]] minority disagreed and made their own proposals. When the majority recommendations were accepted and proposed by the Government. Alliance representatives all over the country attacked the Government's proposals with a new rallying cry – '[[Merdeka]]'. By then, recommendations had been forwarded to London, and Tunku in consultations with the Alliance leaders decided that they must ask for an interview with the Secretary of State in London. Tunku sent a long telegram to the Secretary of State asking him to meet a delegation from the Alliance.

On 14 April 1954, a reply was received from the Secretary of State who rejected the request for an interview. Emergency meetings of [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] and [[Malayan Chinese Association|MCA]] leaders were held and a decision was made. The decision was severely criticised both inside and outside the Alliance and it required great courage and determination for Tunku to proceed. Next were the financial problems. Tunku called for an emergency meeting at UMNO in [[Malacca]] where he asked for financial help. The response from UMNO members was swift. A quantity of money and even personal jewellery were handed to Tunku. After some final travel arrangements, Tunku and [[Mohammad Tahir Tan Tong Hye|T.H Tan]] left Singapore on 21 April 1954, for London. Tunku flew to London all too conscious of the doubts of his Alliance partners and the strong criticism from Government officials.

Before he left, he was aware that Onn Jaafar had dissolved IMP and formed a new political party called '[[Parti Negara]]'. Onn had abandoned his vision of an all-communities party and directed his attention to the Malay community. Tunku realised that Parti Negara would attempt to weaken UMNO and subvert some of his UMNO supporters. But Tunku also knew that he must act now if the granting of Independence was not to be delayed indefinitely. London in mid April 1954 was cold, damp and cheerless. There was not even one press reporter to meet Tunku. Knowing their financial resources were limited, Tunku took T.H. Tan with him to Gloucester Road Hotel and booked a double room. He then telephoned his old friend, [[David Rees-Williams, 1st Baron Ogmore|David Rees]], who was now a prominent member of the [[British Labour Party]].

David Rees, was the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the Colonies under the Labour government from 1947 to 1950. David Rees was a valuable and influential ally. Tunku and Tan went to meet him the next morning in his chambers near the Inner Temple. David Rees promised to do everything possible to persuade [[Oliver Lyttelton, 1st Viscount Chandos|Oliver Lyttleton]] to receive Tunku and his delegation. His persuasion proved to be potent, and on 24 April, Lyttleton agreed to meet Tunku. However, there was one problem. Lyttleton had arranged to leave for [[Uganda]] on an official visit on the following day and would not return until 10 May. It was a long time to wait and it would be stretch their financial resources to the limit, but Tunku decided to stay on.

Meanwhile, with David Rees's help, Tunku gave a Press Conference at which he explained the popular support for the Alliance. He then had meetings with members of parliament of all three parties. Tunku's relaxed manner, the fluency of his spoken English and his genial personality attracted his audience and provided ample justification for his mission. When the contents of the 'Election Proposal' were released by the Colonial Office only then did Tunku discover that the Secretary of State had not accepted all the recommendations of the Election Committee. But Tunku was not satisfied. He had asked for at least 60 elected members. A substantial majority of elected members was essential.

While Lyttleton was overseas Tunku prepared his brief and on 14 May, Tunku, [[Abdul Razak Hussein|Abdul Razak]] and T.H Tan were ushered into the Secretary of State's room in the Colonial Office. Tunku explained in detail the Alliance's views on the importance of a workable elected majority and on the need for early elections, but the Secretary of State insisted that the Alliance try out the Colonial Office Election proposals. Tunku pressed on further for an agreement on at least three-fifths of the elected majority but the Secretary of State wouldn't commit to his suggestion.

Finally, the meeting came to an end. Tunku had to fly back on 20 May, to attend the debate on the Elections Committee proposals in the Legislative Council. A letter from the Colonial Office was delivered to Tunku's hotel room on 19 May. It was beautifully phrased, but the contents could be summarised in two words – no change. T.H Tan cabled the gist of the reply to the Alliance co-chairman, [[Tan Cheng Lock]]. He and Tunku then left London the next day, leaving Abdul Razak to open an UMNO-MCA Merdeka Freedom Bureau through which publicity material in support of early independence could be distributed in England.

===Boycott===
In [[Kuala Lumpur]], Tunku met members of the [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] Executive Committee in the morning, and the "Alliance Round Table" members the same night. [[Barisan Nasional|The Alliance]] leaders accepted the view that the mission had achieved a measure of success. It was also agreed that the request from the Secretary of State to give the elections proposals a trial could not be accepted. They have prepared a resolution which was drafted by [[Henry Lee Hau Shik|Col. H.S. Lee]], rejecting the Colonial Office proposals. The next day, Tunku, [[Ismail Abdul Rahman|Dr. Ismail]] and Leong Yew Koh, the Secretary General of [[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]] took the Resolution to [[Gerald Templer|General Templer]]'s office. Templer read the document without comment and then requested that the release of the resolutions to the press be delayed.

At the Alliance Round Table meeting that night, the Alliance was adamant and the boycott went into effect. About a thousand Alliance members at all levels took part. It was a subtle process with results that were not immediately felt, but which were cumulative. The boycott was widely criticised. The Secretary of State called for consultations with the Rulers by the High Commissioner. Tunku decided that the Alliance should take the initiative and present their views first.

That day, nearly 2,000 Alliance supporters assembled at the government office building in support of the proposals. Attempts to break the Alliance boycott were made by Michael Hogan, the Attorney General and David Gray, the acting Chief Secretary, Hogan and Gray met MacGillivray with their suggestions, and the High Commissioner agreed to their initiative.

Hogan and Gray then met H.S. Lee in Kuala Lumpur and explained the motive of their visit. H. S. Lee then contacted Tunku and Dr. Ismail who were in [[Johor Bahru]] with the news. Tunku reacted positively to the compromise offered but he wanted further assurance from the High Commissioner himself. On 6 July, MacGillivray signed a letter agreeing to the Alliance's request after receiving approval from Lyttleton. The Alliance then called off the boycott.

===Elections===
''Further information: [[Malayan general election, 1955]]''

After [[Barisan Nasional|The Alliance]] called off the boycott, Elections to State Councils with Alliance participation could now proceed. Tunku and his colleagues travelled tirelessly to prepare for the coming trial of strength. Tunku took [[Tan Cheng Lock]] and [[Henry Lee Hau Shik|H.S Lee]] with him whenever possible and in particular when touring the northern Malay states, and emphasised the importance of unity among Malayans of all communities. At each State capital, the Alliance leaders called on the Ruler and assured him of their loyalty and support.

The links between [[United Malay National Organisation|UMNO]] and [[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]] grew stronger and on Tunku's initiative a National Council which became the supreme executive body of the Alliance was established. It took the place of the 'Round Table' which had no executive power and Tunku was formally recognised as 'Leader of the Alliance'. The first two elections to State Councils took place late in 1954 in [[Johor]] and [[Terengganu]]. In both state the Alliance won sweeping victories. [[Parti Negara]] did not capture a single seat. Tunku was now a popular figure in every state and in almost every kampung. He travelled constantly.

Towards the end of 1954, Tunku was invited by the Director of Operations to serve on the Federation War Executive Committee. The government had promised to hold elections to the Federal Legislative Council in 1955, and in March of that year, it was announced that Nomination Day would be in June, and that 27 July would be Election Day. Many Malay government officers resigned to offer themselves as candidates. As nomination day approached, Tunku was plagued by demands that a high proportion of the candidates should be Malay.

Tunku brought the matter to the next UMNO Assembly and urged the members to adopt what he called "a policy of racial unselfishness". Tunku's arguments were compelling and he won a unanimous vote of confidence. Almost at the eleventh hour, Tunku's repeated emphasis on the importance of unity during the elections brought him a bonus. The [[Malayan Indian Congress]], MIC, which had wavered in its support of Parti Negara, now promised to back the Alliance, representing the [[Malaysian Indian|Indian]] community.

On Nomination day, the Alliance entered a candidate in every one of the 52 constituencies. Parti Negara entered 30 candidates. 29 Malays and one Chinese. Four other political parties entered a total of 29 candidates. Eighteen others stood as Independents. Two weeks before Nomination Day, [[Hussein Onn|Onn]] announced that he would stand in [[Johor Bahru|Johor Bharu]], and challenged Tunku to stand against him. It was a tactical error. The Alliance let it be known that the Party would decide where Tunku should stand, and it gave the headquarters an opportunity to select a candidate who could be expected to defeat Onn.

Tunku's resisted invitations to forecast the election results, but he let it be known that he was confident of an Alliance victory. It was only during the last week of the elections that Tunku toured his own constituency. Everywhere he went, he was promised total support. He spent the day before the elections in the UMNO House in [[Alor Setar]] and telephoned the Alliance headquarters in every state.

On polling day, after casting his vote, he drove himself on a whirlwind tour to constituencies in Kedah and then set off to [[Kuala Lumpur]] accompanied by [[Mohammad Tahir Tan Tong Hye|T.H Tan]]. Tunku stopped at every main polling station en route, and only arrived in Kuala Lumpur at 11pm, making it possible for him to enter the town unrecognised. Tunku always enjoyed company of his friends but on the night of 27 July, he was exhausted and wanted to be alone. Tunku spent the night at the Eastern Hotel, listening to the results of the elections until the Kuala Lumpur Radio Station went off air at 3AM.

Tunku won with a majority of more than 20,000 votes, Sulaiman won with 5,943 votes and Dato' Onn only managed to secure 2,802 votes. The Alliance won 51 seats, the [[Pan Malaysian Islamic Party|Pan Malayan Islamic Party (PMIP)]] won only one seat and the [[Parti Negara|National Party (PN)]] won none.

===Early days as Chief Minister===
High Commissioner [[Donald MacGillivray|MacGillivray]] invited Tunku to the King's House for a first formal discussion on Sunday, 31 July. Tunku handed the High Commissioner for a list of 11 Cabinet Minister: six Malays, three Chinese and two Indians. The list would still have to be passed to the Rulers for their formal concurrence that would take some time. On 1 August, Tunku was received by a British Assistant Secretary to the Government at the Federal Secretariat building.

On 9 August, Tunku made his first broadcast to the nation from an old wooden structure at Young Road, [[Kuala Lumpur]]. During the broadcast, he said:{{quote|I am very determined to strive for self-government and Independence as soon as possible by constitutional means. Others have been obliged to fight the colonial power before they achieved their freedom and this will not be necessary in Malaya.

[[Barisan Nasional|The Alliance]] has proved that they have the support of at least 80 per cent of adult population, and that the three principal communities worked closely together at all levels to win the election. I will take the opportunity to ask the new Secretary of State for the Colonies to arrange for constitutional talks in London as soon as possible since the present Federal Constitution is now workable during his visit to Kuala Lumpur.

The [[Malayan Emergency]] continues to obstruct progress and swallow up funds that should be used for development and I will try my best to end the Emergency through a fresh initiative. Finally, I assure government officers who belong to other political parties that they have no reason to fear official disfavor.}}

There had been another General Election in United Kingdom, won again by the Conservatives. [[Alan Lennox-Boyd, 1st Viscount Boyd of Merton|Alan Lennox-Boyd]] was the new [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Secretary of States for the Colonies]]. He was to visit Malaya and be present at the new Legislative Council meeting on 1 September. At their first informal meeting at King's House in Kuala Lumpur, Tunku found in the new Secretary of States an unexpected affinity. They were able to speak freely and they shared a sense of humour. Lennox-Boyd agreed to hold constitutional talks in London in January 1956,&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; provided that the Rulers were represented. When the Rulers met at their conferences in Kuala Lumpur in September 1955, Tunku sought and was granted a special audience. Tunku asked the Rulers to appoint representatives for the constitutional talks to be held in London. As the days for the talks got closer, travel plans were discussed.

===Baling Talks===
''Further information: [[Baling Talks]]''

In dealing with the [[Malayan Emergency|Emergency]], Tunku had offered amnesty to the communist terrorists soon after he became Chief Minister. 186 "Safe Areas" were named in four million leaflets, which were dropped over the jungle from Air Force planes. The results had been disappointing but an unsigned letter from Communist headquarters in South [[Thailand]] asked for a ceasefire. Tunku showed the letter to [[Donald MacGillivray|MacGillivray]] and [[Geoffrey Bourne, Baron Bourne|General Bourne]]. Then, with their agreement, Tunku issued a reply in the Press stating that he was willing to meet [[Chin Peng]].

After a further exchange of letters, Tunku and Chin Peng met in Southeast [[Kedah]] near the Siamese border in December 1955. Tunku had 2 objectives for the meeting, one was to clarify the amnesty terms, the other was to make it clear that Tunku spoke for the people of Malaya and not as a representative of the British. Chin Peng could not accept the amnesty terms because the British did not allow communists in the jungle to enjoy equal status with other Malayans. Chin Peng demanded that the [[Malayan Communist Party]] (MCP) be legalised and be allowed to participate in the elections.

Singaporean Chief Minister [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]] asked if the MCP would lay down their arms if Malaya was granted Independence, Chin Peng refused as the amnesty offer was unacceptable to the MCP, and that they would never disband the MCP. Discussions continued after dark without either side making any concessions. The talks failed to reach any agreement and ended at 10AM the next morning.

Following failure of the talks, Tunku decided to withdraw the offer of an amnesty on 8 February 1956, five months after if had been offered. He stated that he would not willingly meet the communists again unless they indicated beforehand their desire to see him with a view to making "a complete surrender". He said that the Communists had made it clear to him that their ideology and that of himself and his party could not exist side by side. Therefore, the war must be intensified until one or the other gave in. "I have every confidence that the people of Malaya will give their fullest support and co-operation to the action I have taken."

==Road to Independence==
After Tunku and [[Alan Lennox-Boyd, 1st Viscount Boyd of Merton|Lennox-Boyd]] agreed to hold constitutional talks in London in January 1956, provided that the Rulers were represented. When the Rulers met at their conferences in [[Kuala Lumpur]] in September 1955, Tunku sought and was granted a special audience. Tunku asked the Rulers to appoint representatives for the constitutional talks to be held in London.

Finally on 1 January 1956, the two delegations sailed together from Singapore to [[Karachi]] on the ''Asia'',  Before they arrived at Karachi, their draft proposals had been finalised, and they entered Lancaster House in London on 16 January, as the [[Merdeka]] Mission, with a single leader, Tunku.

Finally on 8 February 1956, Tunku's fifty-third birthday, he and Lennox-Boyd signed the Independence agreement, scheduled for August 1957.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Tunku and his mission left London on 16 February, had a short break in [[Cairo]] and landed in Singapore four days later.

The next day, Tunku went to [[Malacca]] where he had decided to make his first public announcement on their success. His speech was simple and brief, muffled by the constant chorus of "Merdeka". Soon after Tunku's return from London, a Constitutional Commission as set up in [[Kuala Lumpur]]. The Commission travelled to every State, hearing evidence and receiving memoranda. The Alliance National Council spent months preparing a detailed memorandum from the Commission, most of which were accepted.

The Commissioner's report was published in Kuala Lumpur in February 1957. [[Donald MacGillivray|MacGillivray]] then set up a Working Committee to prepare final recommendations for the consideration of the British Government. When the subject of '[[jus soli]]' (citizenship by right of birth) was mentioned, Tunku, as the inspired diplomat, managed to persuade the [[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]] leaders to agree to its omission from the official recommendations.

==Premiership==
[[File:Aankomst van premier van Malakka Abdul Rahman, Bestanddeelnr 911-2803.jpg|thumb|Tunku Abdul Rahman during a state visit to The [[Netherlands]] (May 1960)]]
Tunku Abdul Rahman dominated the politics of [[independent (nation)|independent]] [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] (which became [[Malaysia]] in 1963), and led the [[Barisan Nasional|Alliance]] to landslide wins in the [[Malayan general election, 1959|1959]], and [[Malaysian General Election, 1964|1964]] general elections. He not only served as the first prime minister of Malaya, but also as its foreign minister.

The formation of Malaysia was one of his greatest achievements. In 1961 he made a speech at the Foreign Correspondents Association of Southeast Asia in Singapore, proposing a federation Malaya, Singapore, [[Sabah]], [[Sarawak]], and [[Brunei]]. On 16 September 1963, with the federation of all these states except Brunei, Tunku Abdul Rahman was formally restyled as [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]].

However, the racial factor was worsened with the inclusion of Singapore, which increased the Chinese proportion to more than 40%. Both [[UMNO]] and the [[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]] were nervous about the possible appeal of [[Lee Kuan Yew]]'s [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) to voters in Malaya, and tried to organise a party in Singapore to challenge Lee's position there, despite an earlier agreement that he would not do so (see [[PAP-UMNO relations]]). Lee in turn retaliated by running PAP candidates in Malaya at the 1964 federal elections, winning one seat. 

This provoked Tunku to demand that Singapore be permanently removed from the union of Malaysia. This order led to the development of the [[Independence of Singapore Agreement 1965]] which achieved total independence for Singapore from Malaysia in that one move.  The same day, 7 August 1965, Tunku announced to the [[Parliament of Malaysia]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]] that it should vote yes on the resolution to have Singapore be put out of the Federation and Singapore's secession and independence became official on 9 August 1965.

At the [[Malaysian general election, 1969|1969 general election]], the Alliance's majority was greatly reduced. Demonstrations following the elections sparked the [[May 13 Incident|13 May racial riots]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Some UMNO leaders led by [[Tun Abdul Razak]] were critical of Tunku's leadership during these events, and an emergency committee [[MAGERAN]] took power and declared a state of emergency.

His powers as Prime Minister were severely curtailed, and on 22 September 1970 (a day after his agnatic first-degree nephew became king of Malaysia), he was forced to resign as Prime Minister in favour of [[Tun Abdul Razak|Abdul Razak]]. He subsequently resigned from UMNO presidency in June 1971, in the midst of severe opposition of the 'Young Turks' comprising party rebels such as [[Mahathir Mohamad]] and [[Musa Hitam]]. The duo later became Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia respectively.

==Involvements in Islam==
After making Islam the religion of the Federation in 1960, Tunku established the Islamic Welfare Organisation (PERKIM), an organisation to help Muslim converts adjust to new lives as Muslims. He was President of PERKIM until a year before his death. In 1961 Malaysia hosted the first International Qur'an Recital Competition, an event that developed from Abdul Rahman's idea when he organised the first state-level competition in Kedah in 1951.

Malaysia is a founder member of the OIC. Its headquarters are in Jeddah but it was actually established at the Conference of Islamic Nations held in Kuala Lumpur in 1969. Tunku was its first secretary-general since 1970.

On the occasion of his 80th birthday, he stated in 9 February 1983 edition of ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'' newspaper  that the "country has a multi-racial population with various beliefs. Malaysia must continue as a secular State with Islam as the official religion." In the same issue of ''The Star'', Tunku was supported by the third Malaysian Prime Minister, [[Hussein Onn]], who stated that the "nation can still be functional as a secular state with Islam as the official religion."&lt;ref&gt;Ooi, J. 2007.

Accessed 21 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports involvement==
Tunku became Vice-President of [[Kedah FA|Kedah Football Association]] after his return from Cambridge in the late 1930s. Later in 1949, Tunku became President of [[Selangor FA|Selangor Football Association]], and a few years later, he became President of [[Football Association of Malaysia]] for 20 years. During his Presidency, he introduced a competition for those under-18 years old such as the ''Piala FAM'' (FAM Cup) and the ''Piala Rahman'' (Rahman Cup).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org.my/museum/hof/ind/tarn.htm Hall of Fame]. Olympic.org.my. Retrieved on 27 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Being an avid sportsman, Tunku was a firm believer that sports can be a good catalyst in bringing about greater social unity among Malaysians of various races and religions. Therefore, he supported and initiated many sports events. These included an international football tournament, the Pestabola Merdeka (Independence Football Festival) in 1957. The following year, he was elected as the first president of [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC), a post he held until 1977.&lt;ref name="Weinberg2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben Weinberg|title=Asia and the Future of Football: The Role of the Asian Football Confederation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sk2sCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA80|date=22 May 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-57632-7|pages=80–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-afc.com/60th-anniversary-asias-history-makers-60th-anniversary-news/asian-icons-tunku-abdul-rahman-putra-al|title=Asian Icons: Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al Haj |publisher=Asian Football Confederation|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunku also loved horse racing and was a regular at the [[Selangor Turf Club]]. He claimed that his lucky number was 13, and that he would win horse races that were held on the 13th of the month, especially on Friday the 13th for him. Tunku's racing interests included the champion racehorse [[Think Big (horse)|Think Big]]. After it won the 1974 [[Melbourne Cup]], Think Big's owners, Malaysian businessman Dato [[Tan Chin Nam]] and Australian property developer Rick O'Sullivan, invited Tunku to join them as a part-owner of the horse.  Think Big then won its second Melbourne Cup in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thinkbigstud.com.au/Dato-Tan-Chin-Nam.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816210034/http://thinkbigstud.com.au/Dato-Tan-Chin-Nam.asp |archivedate=16 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, having acquired substantial shares in ''The Star'', a Penang-based newspaper, he became the newspaper's chairman. His columns, "Looking Back" and "As I See It", were critical of the government, and in 1987 [[Mahathir Mohamad|Mahathir]] banned the newspaper. This led to a split in UMNO, with Tunku himself and another former PM, [[Hussein Onn|Hussein]], setting up a new party called [[UMNO Malaysia]], but its registration was quashed by [[Mahathir Mohamad|Mahathir]], who set up his own [[UMNO Baru]] (New UMNO). Tunku later supported [[Semangat 46|Semangat 46 (S46)]], a splinter group of UMNO led by [[Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah]]. He campaigned actively for the latter in the [[Malaysian general election, 1990|General election of 1990]], but was already in very poor health. The well-educated, visionary Tunku stood in contrast to Mahathir's brand of nationalism, which promised to help ethnic Malays, who were purportedly economically and socially stunted by the aftereffects of the colonial British "divide and rule" system.

==Personal life==
It was in Kulim that Tunku married his first wife, [[Lady Meriam|Meriam Chong]] who was the daughter of his friend, Chong Ah Yong, a [[Thai Chinese]]. A year after their marriage, Tunku's daughter Tunku Khadijah was born. A year later, a son Tunku Ahmad Nerang was born. A month after Meriam gave birth to her second child, she contracted a severe attack of malaria and died.

On Meriam's death, Tunku wrote to his lady friend in England, [[Violet Coulson]], who ran a coffee shop that Tunku had frequented as a student. When Tunku's letter reached Violet, she dropped everything and turned up in Singapore. They were secretly married by the Kadi in the Malay mosque in Arab Street according to Muslim rites. After conversion, Violet's Muslim name was Puteh Bte Abdullah. Violet went to live in Penang because they had no approval of the Ruler or Regent. Tunku Ibrahim, the Regent, was strongly opposed to mixed marriages, but when he died unexpectedly in 1934 and was succeeded as Regent by Tunku Mahmud, the Sultan's younger brother, he consented to the marriage. Though their marriage went well, Tunku's responsibilities in the public service were all-consuming and after a separation where Violet returned to London, they were divorced amicably in 1947.

He then married [[Sharifah Rodziah Syed Alwi Barakbah]], with whom he adopted four children, Sulaiman, Mariam, Sharifah Hanizah (granddaughter) and Faridah.&lt;ref&gt;"Tunku Abdul Rahman, 87, Dead, First Prime Minister of Malaysia", New York Times, Obituaries, 12/7/1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
He died peacefully on 6 December 1990&lt;ref name="biography1"/&gt; at the age of 87. Among those who witnessed his last breath were Chief Secretary Tun Ahmad Sarji, Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad|Mahathir]], and a few others. The PM later ordered the Chief Secretary to announce the death of Tunku. He was buried at the [[Kedah royal mausoleum|Langgar Royal Mausoleum]] in Alor Star.

The '''Vasojevići''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Васојевићи}}, {{IPA-sh|ʋâso̞je̞ʋit͡ɕi|pron}}) is a historic [[Tribes of Montenegro|Montenegrin Highland tribe]] and a territorial unit in northeastern [[Montenegro]], in the region of [[Brda, Montenegro|Brda]] ("the Highlands"). It is the largest of the historical tribes, occupying the area between Vjetarnih Lijeva Rijeka in the South and [[Bihor (region)|Bihor]] under [[Bijelo Polje]] in the North, [[Mateševo]] in the West to [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] in the East. The tribe (''pleme'') is one of seven Highland tribes (Vasojevići, [[Moračani]], [[Rovčani]], [[Bratonožići]], [[Kuči]], [[Piperi clan|Piperi]] and [[Bjelopavlići (clan)|Bjelopavlići]]). Vasojevići is also the name of the region inhabited by the Vasojevići. Most of the tribe's history prior to the 16th century has naturally been passed on through [[oral history]].

Although the unofficial center is [[Andrijevica]] in north-eastern Montenegro, the tribe stems from Lijeva Rijeka in central Montenegro. The tribe was formed by various tribes that were united under the rule of the central Vasojević tribe. These tribes later migrated to the [[Komovi Mountains|Komovi]] mountains and the area of [[Lim River|Lim]]. The emigration continued into what is today [[Serbia]] and other parts of [[Montenegro]].

Though sense of tribal affiliation diminished in recent years, is not a thing of a past. Tribal association and organizations still exist (e.g. Udruženje Vasojevića "Vaso"). It could be clearly seen during the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006]] with the Vasojevići united opposition.

==Geography==
It occupies the area between Vjetarnih Lijeva Rijeka in the South and [[Bihor (region)|Bihor]] under [[Bijelo Polje]] in the North, [[Mateševo]] in the West to [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] in the East.

==History==

===Early history===
The oldest mention of the Vasojevići dates to 1444, where it is described as not a tribe, but as an ethnic group (a people). The [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] Senate report filed by Ragusan merchants dating to October 29, 1444, speaks of the Vasojevići (and their leader Vaso&lt;ref&gt;Vukić 1969, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;), living near Medun, in Rikavac, having together with the Bjelopavlići and Piperi attacked Ragusan merchants, doing material damage.&lt;ref&gt;Dašić 1986, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; According to some historians, the fact that the Vasojevići were not mentioned in the 1455 document, points to them having migrated from Upper Zeta.&lt;ref&gt;Dašić 1986, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 1485 defter, the Vasojevići and Bratonožići were not yet established tribes.&lt;ref name="Strugar1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vlado Strugar|title=Prošlost Crne Gore kao predmet naučnog istraživanja i obrade|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=maYMAAAAIAAJ|year=1987|publisher=Crnogorska akademija nauka i umjetnosti|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
In 1658, the seven tribes of [[Kuči]], Vasojevići, [[Bratonožići]], [[Piperi (tribe)|Piperi]], [[Klimenti]], [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti]] and [[Gruda (tribe)|Gruda]] allied themselves with the [[Republic of Venice]], establishing the so-called "Seven-fold banner" or "alaj-barjak", against the Ottomans.&lt;ref name=MZ&gt;{{cite book|title=Mitološki zbornik|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rvUSAQAAIAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Centar za mitološki studije Srbije|pages=24, 41–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1689, an uprising broke out in Piperi, [[Rovca]], [[Bjelopavlići (tribe)|Bjelopavlići]], Bratonožići, Kuči and Vasojevići, while at the same time an uprising broke out in [[Prizren]], [[Peć]], [[Priština]] and [[Skopje]], and then in [[Kratovo, Macedonia|Kratovo]] and [[Kriva Palanka]] in October ([[Karposh's Rebellion]]).&lt;ref name="armije1968"&gt;{{cite book|author=Belgrade (Serbia). Vojni muzej Jugoslovenske narodne armije|title=Fourteen centuries of struggle for freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2m8MAQAAMAAJ|year=1968|publisher=The Military Museum|page=xxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===

Documents, especially the letter of Ivan Radonjić from 1789, show that the ''Montenegrins'' were identified as Serbs, and that the Banjani, Kuči, Piperi, Bjelopavlići, Zećani, Vasojevići, Bratonožići were not identified as "Montenegrins" but only as ''Serb tribes''. They were all mentioned only in a regional, geographical, and tribal manner, and never as an ethnic category.&lt;ref&gt;Vukčević 1981, p. 46 {{quote|... да Бан&gt;ани, Дробн&gt;аци, Кучи, Пи- пери, Б)елопавлићи, Зепани, Васо^евићи, Братоножићи нијесу Црно- горци. Они су сви поменути само као регионални односно географски и племенски појмови а никако као етничка категорща, при чему се ш^му Црна Гора не даје никакво преимућство над другима, осим што ^е Црна Гора ставлена на прво мјесто.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century the folklore of the tribe was influenced by the Orthodox [[millenarianism]] that had developed during the mid Ottoman era. According to one such folk legend, an elder of the Vasojevići, Stanj, foretold Greek priests the advent of a Serbian messiah, a dark man (''crni čovijek'') who would liberate the Serbs from the Turks. These myths as part of the official Serbian Orthodox doctrine provided both a de facto recognition of Ottoman rule and the denial of its legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.yorku.ca/hist/tgallant/documents/roudometofnationalismclassversion.pdf|title=From Rum Millet to Greek Nation: Enlightenment, Secularization, and National Identity in Ottoman Balkan Society, 1453–1821|last=Roudometof|first=Victor|year=1998|publisher=Journal of Modern Greek Studies|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
During the [[Second World War]], the Vasojevići were divided between the two armies of [[Chetniks|Serb Chetniks]] ([[Monarchism|royalists]]) and [[Yugoslav Partisans]] ([[communists]]) that were fighting each other&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=ipQ8AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=vasojevic&amp;dq=vasojevic&amp;hl=sv&amp;pgis=1&lt;/ref&gt; (vojvoda [[Pavle Đurišić]] formed the most successful Chetnik units out of mainly Vasojevići). As a result, the conflict spread within the tribal structures.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006===

In May 2006, [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|Montenegro gained independence]] after a referendum on the future of the [[State Union of Serbia and Montenegro]]. However, 72% of voters in [[Andrijevica]] municipality, the unofficial centre of the Vasojevići region, voted against Montenegrin independence. It was the second highest result against breaking the state union with [[Serbia]] (after [[Pluzine]] municipality).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/documents/odihr/2006/08/20077_sr.pdf OSCE Referendum o drzavnom statusu]&lt;/ref&gt;

The People's Assembly of Vasojevići stated many times that, apart from being Montenegrin, all Vasojevići are Serb&lt;ref name="Vasojevicki Zakon 1"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.srpsko-nasledje.co.rs/sr-l/1999/01/article-16.html |title=Vasojevicki Zakon u Dvanaest Tocaka, part 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vasojevicki Zakon 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srpsko-nasledje.co.rs/sr-l/1999/02/article-18.html |title=Vasojevicki Zakon u Dvanaest Tocaka, part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milija Komatina, Crna Gora I Srpsko Pitanje: Prilog Izucavanju Integrativnih i Dezintegrativnih Tokova (Montenegro and the Serbian Question: A Contribution to the Study of Integrative and Disintegrative Currents) (Belgrade: Inter Ju Press, 1966), page 171&lt;/ref&gt; and, thus, strongly oppose and have always opposed Montenegrin secession from [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arhiva.kurir-info.rs/Arhiva/2006/jun/27/V-05-27062006.shtml Udruzenie Vasojevicia Vaso]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcnen.com/Arhiva/2001/17-12-2001.htm Vasojevici za Srpstvo i Jugoslaviju]&lt;/ref&gt; The Montenegrin census of 2003 revealed that 89,81% of the Vasojevići declared themselves as [[Serb]] while 9,43% declared themselves as [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]].

===2010s===
During the [[War in Ukraine]], some locals of villages of Andrijevica, part of the Vasojevići tribe, decided to sell and give up land for free to Russia, stating that "we are brothers".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rtv.rs/sr_ci/region/vasojevici-nude-zemlju-putinu_475497.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropology==

It is a tradition of all brotherhoods to show respect to ancestors by knowing precisely genealogy and the history of the tribe and a family.  This also allows members of the clan to be unite, to act together and always to recognise kin.&lt;ref name="Ivan"/&gt;

According to a folk myth, the founder of the tribe was ''Vaso''.&lt;ref name="Ivan"&gt;I. R. Dragović, Beograd, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; According to one myth Vaso was a descendant of the medieval Serbian [[Nemanjić dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Bogdan-Ivan"&gt;Bogdan Lalević-Ivan Protić, Vasojevići u crnogorskoj granici, Srpski etn. zbornik 5, Beograd 1903&lt;/ref&gt; Vaso's great-grandfather was [[Stefan Konstantin]], the rival King, who was defeated by his half-brother [[Stephen Uroš III Dečanski of Serbia|Stefan Uroš III]] in 1322. Stefan Konstantin had a son, Stefan Vasoje, who was brought up at the court of [[Dušan the Mighty]]. Stefan Vasoje participated in the battles of Dušan, and when he had received sufficient experience, he was put by the Emperor as ''voivode'' at [[Sjenica]]. Stefan Vasoje had a son, Stefan Konstantin II (1342–1389, known as ''Vojvoda [[Vasojević Stevo]]'' in folklore), who participated in the [[Battle of Kosovo (1389)]], where he died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patriotmagazin.com/arhiva/0133/media/001.htm Kosovski ciklus epskih pjesama]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Pogibija Pavla Orlovića i Steva Vasojevića na Kosovu"&lt;/ref&gt; is believed to be either the grandfather or great-grandfather of Vaso.&lt;ref name="Ivan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vesović"/&gt; The legend further alleges that Vaso, one of five sons of Stefan Konstantin II (all brothers are founders of clans), moved to Lijeva Rijeka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdjukic.com/DJUKICIODPAVICA/04Vasojevice%20i%20Vasojevici%20str%2025_49.pdf|title=Archived copy|access-date=2011-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425092345/http://www.sdjukic.com/DJUKICIODPAVICA/04Vasojevice%20i%20Vasojevici%20str%2025_49.pdf|archive-date=2012-04-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the fall of [[Smederevo fortress]] (1459) and the subsequent fall of the whole [[Serbian Empire]], [[Serbs]] from [[Kosovo]], [[Metohija]] and [[Šumadija]] fled from the incoming [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] to [[Bosna (region)|Bosna]] and, after its fall (1463), into [[Herzegovina]]. Vaso, the founded of the tribe, fled along with these waves of refugees. In 1465 he moved from [[Herzegovina]] to [[Lijeva Rijeka]] in [[Zeta]] (modern day [[Montenegro]]).

Vaso's descendants gradually expanded to the north-east and inhabited the region by the river [[Lim River|Lim]] called [[Polimlje]] – the area around the [[Komovi mountains]], [[Andrijevica]] and [[Berane]] 
&lt;ref name="Ivan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vesović"&gt;R-J. V. Vesović, 1935, "Pljeme Vasojevići", Državna Štampa u Sarajevu, Sarajevo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cemović"&gt;M. P. Cemović, 1993, "Vasojevići" (IInd edn), Izdavacki cavjet Zavicajnog udruzenja Vasojevicia, Beograd&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Komovi Mountains.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Komovi Mountains, Kom Vasojevićki on the left]] Thus, they formed the largest tribe (pleme) of all seven highland tribes of Montenegro (i.e. Vasojevići, [[Moračani]], [[Rovčani]], [[Bratonožići]], [[Kuči]], [[Piperi clan|Piperi]] and [[Bjelopavlići (clan)|Bjelopavlići]]). In modern [[Montenegro]] the area of Vasojevići falls into following municipalities: [[Berane]], [[Podgorica]], [[Kolašin]], [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] and [[Bijelo Polje]] (around 15% of [[Montenegro]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2001/05/23/srpski/F01052203.shtml Pribijanje uz rođake]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the highest mountains of the modern day [[Montenegro]] is named after the tribe: [[Komovi Mountains|Kom Vasojevićki]] (2461 meteres) and the whole area inhabited by the tribe is frequently called "Vasojevići".&lt;ref name="Vesović"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cemović"/&gt;

Part of the tribe that stayed free from the Turkish occupation lives in the area of [[Lijeva Rijeka]] and [[Andrijevica]] (Upper Nahija) – they are all called Upper Vasojevići. Lower Vasojevici (or Lower Nahija) inhabited the area of [[Berane]]. Most of the Lower Vasojevići were within the Turkish reign until [[Balkan Wars]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Cemović"/&gt;

Tribe members were perceived as noblemen and rarely mingled with common folk – people who did not have a common ancestor. Vasojevići called them Ašani (earlier also Asa and Hasa)&lt;ref&gt;Predanja o zajedničnom poreklu nekih crnogorskih i nekih arbanaških plemena {{cite web |url=http://www.rastko.org.rs/rastko-al/zbornik1990/mbarjaktarevic-predanja_l.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313015959/http://www.rastko.org.rs/rastko-al/zbornik1990/mbarjaktarevic-predanja_l.php |archivedate=2013-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and today this term has come to denote Vasojevići of other origin.&lt;ref name="Ivan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vesović"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cemović"/&gt;

In a book "Pleme Vasojevići" written in 1935, R. Vešović describes the structure of the Vasojevići.&lt;ref name="Vesović"/&gt; The list of families was exhausting when the book was completed but since then new families may have developed. Sometimes, with the very distant genealogy, slight variations of names, chronology and relationships exist concurrently but there is no doubt among the Vasojevići members which family belongs to which brotherhood, branch and sub-branch.&lt;ref name="Ivan"/&gt; Never has any family questioned the structure depicted below.&lt;ref name="Vesović"/&gt; The brotherhoods of Vasojevići stem from different tribes, of no common kinship and ancestry, which were united under the rule of a central tribe that extended its name to the other clans.&lt;ref name="Vucinich1975"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vucinich|first=Wayne S.|title=A study in social survival: the katun in Bileća Rudine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n95BAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Vasojevici+%2B+origin&amp;dq=Vasojevici+%2B+origin&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kQPFTqXkGKz64QSJpOiuDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwATgU|accessdate=17 November 2011|year=1975|publisher=University of Denver|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also connected to the Vasojević tribe are the [[Vojnović noble family]].{{how|date=December 2014}}

===Brotherhoods===

All people of the Vasojevići are descendants of three Vaso sons: Rajo, Novak and Mioman. Hence the three great clans (bratstva) of the Vasojevići:&lt;ref name="Vesović"/&gt;

* '''Rajevići'''
* '''Novakovići'''
* '''Miomanovići'''

The local legend has it that Vaso had a fourth son, by the name of Đuro, who left home and settled in [[Crmnica]], where he founded the brotherhood of Đurovići. The legend also recounts how after the [[Battle of Kosovo (1448)|Second Battle of Kosovo]], defeated [[John Hunyadi|Janos Hunyadi]] (Sibinjanin Janko in [[Serbian epic poetry]]) along with his wounded (according to some traditions already dead) nephew Banovac Sekula retreated to the safety of the high Komovi mountains. There he was received by Vaso and his sons, who all gave him a gift respectively: Rajo a sword, Novak a horse, and Mijoman a gun. However, suddenly there was a shout to the arms as the enemy was approaching, and both Novak and Mijo took their gifts back. Rajo, on the other hand, did not want to, so he equipped himself with another weapon. Hynadi blessed him for this, and predicted that he and his brothers will be great heroes, as well as their descendants, but that his own will always be the largest and that they will always be the leaders of the tribe.

Rajevići is the biggest branch. It is in turn divided into three branches&lt;br&gt; (again after Raja’s sons or grandsons: Đuro, Dabet and Uglješa Damir-Kovač).

'''William Childs Westmoreland''' (March 26, 1914 – July 18, 2005) was a  [[United States Army]] [[General (United States)|general]], most notably commander of United States forces during the [[Vietnam War]] from 1964 to 1968. He served as [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] from 1968 to 1972.

Westmoreland adopted a strategy of [[Attrition warfare|attrition]] against the [[Viet Cong]] and the [[North Vietnamese Army]], attempting to drain them of manpower and supplies. He also made use of the United States' edge in artillery and air power, both in tactical confrontations and in relentless strategic bombing of North Vietnam. Many of the battles in Vietnam were technically United States victories, with the United States Army in control of the field afterward; holding territory gained this way proved difficult, however. Public support for the war eventually diminished, especially after the [[Battle of Khe Sanh]] and the [[Tet Offensive]] in 1968. By the time he was re-assigned as Army Chief of Staff, United States military forces in Vietnam had reached a peak of 535,000 personnel. Westmoreland's strategy was ultimately politically unsuccessful. Growing United States casualties and the draft undermined United States support for the war while large-scale casualties among non-combatants weakened South Vietnamese support. This also failed to weaken North Vietnam's will to fight, and the [[Government of South Vietnam]]—a factor largely out of Westmoreland's control—never succeeded in establishing enough legitimacy to quell defections to the Viet Cong.

==Early life==
William Childs Westmoreland was born in [[Spartanburg County, South Carolina]], on March 26, 1914 to Eugenia Talley Childs and James Ripley Westmoreland. His [[upper middle class]] family was involved in the local banking and textile industries. At the age of 15, William became an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] at Troop 1 Boy Scouts, and was recipient of the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] and [[Silver Buffalo]] from the [[Boy Scouts of America]] as a young adult. After spending a year at [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]] in 1932,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/william-westmoreland-9528510|title=William Westmoreland|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was appointed to attend the [[United States Military Academy]] on the nomination of Senator [[James F.

==Military career==
Following graduation from West Point in 1936, Westmoreland became an artillery officer and served in several assignments with the 18th Field Artillery at Fort Sill. In 1939, he was promoted to first lieutenant, after which he was a battery commander and battalion staff officer with the 8th Field Artillery at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii.

===World War II===
In World War II, Westmoreland saw combat with the 34th Field Artillery Battalion, [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]], in [[French Tunisia|Tunisia]], [[Sicily]], [[Vichy France|France]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]; he commanded the 34th Battalion in Tunisia and Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ca5/militaryhistoryus/history.html|title=Field Artillery Unit History &amp; Links|website=[[angelfire.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reached the temporary wartime rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], and on October 13, 1944, was appointed the [[chief of staff]] of the 9th Infantry Division.&lt;ref&gt;Headquarters Morning Report, 13 Oct 1944, Division Headquarters, 9th Infantry Division.

After the war, Westmoreland completed Airborne training at the Infantry School in 1946. He then commanded the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, [[82d Airborne Division]]. From 1947 to 1950, he served as chief of staff for the 82d Airborne Division. He was an instructor at the Army Command and General Staff College from 1950 to 1951. He then completed the Army War College as a student in 1951, and stayed as an instructor from 1951 to 1952.

===Korean War===
Westmoreland was promoted to Brigadier General in November 1952 at the age of 38, making him one of the youngest U.S. Army generals in the post-World War II era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zaffiri |first=Samuel |date=1994 |title=Westmoreland: A Biography of General William C.

After returning to the United States, Westmoreland was deputy assistant chief of staff, G–1, for manpower control on the Army staff from 1953 to 1955.  In 1954, he completed a three-month management program at [[Harvard Business School]]. As Stanley Karnow noted, "Westy was a corporation executive in uniform."&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Karnow. ''Vietnam: A History.'' p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Westmoreland was the United States Army's Secretary of the General Staff from 1955 to 1958. He then commanded the [[101st Airborne Division]] from 1958 to 1960. He was [[Superintendent of the United States Military Academy]] from 1960 to 1963. In 1962, Westmoreland was admitted as an honorary member of the Massachusetts [[Society of the Cincinnati]]. He was promoted to lieutenant general in July 1963 and was Commanding General of the [[XVIII Airborne Corps]] from 1963 to 1964.

===Vietnam War===
;Background and overview

{{Quote|text=Master philosopher of war Karl von Clausewitz emphasized almost a century and a half earlier that because war is controlled by its political object, the value of this object must determine the sacrifices to be made for it both in magnitude and also in duration. He went on to say, Once the expenditure of effort exceeds the value of the political object, the object must be renounced.|author=Harry G. Summers}}

The attempted French re-colonization of [[First Indochina War|Vietnam]] following World War II culminated in a decisive [[French Fourth Republic|French]] defeat at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]].&lt;ref name = "nat"&gt;{{cite book |title = Lịch sử thế giới hiện đại |last= Nguyễn Anh Thái (chief author) |first = |authorlink = |author2 = Nguyễn Quốc Hùng |author3=Vũ Ngọc Oanh |author4 = Trần Thị Vinh |author5 = Đặng Thanh Toán |author6 = Đỗ Thanh Bình  |year = 2002 |publisher = Giáo Dục Publisher |location= Ho Chi Minh City |id = 8934980082317 |pages = 320–22 |url = |accessdate = |language = Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flitton|first1=Dave|title=Battlefield Vietnam – Dien Bien Phu, the legacy|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQdFGr7NQ4o|publisher=Public Broadcasting System PBS|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Geneva Conference (April 26 – July 20, 1954) discussed the possibility of restoring peace in [[Indochina]], and temporarily separated Vietnam into two zones, a northern zone to be governed by the Việt Minh, and a southern zone to be governed by the [[State of Vietnam]], then headed by former emperor [[Bảo Đại]]. A Conference Final Declaration, issued by the British chairman of the conference, provided that a general election be held by July 1956 to create a unified Vietnamese state. Although presented as a consensus view, this document was not accepted by the delegates of either the State of Vietnam or the United States. In addition, China, the Soviet Union and other communist nations recognized the North while the United States and other non-communist states recognized the South as the legitimate government. By the time Westmoreland became army commander in [[South Vietnam]], the option of a Korea-type settlement with a large demilitarised zone separating north and south, favored by military and diplomatic figures, had been rejected by the US government, whose objectives were to achieve a decisive victory, and not to use vastly greater resources. The infiltration by regular [[North Vietnam]] forces into the South could not be dealt with by aggressive action against the northern state because intervention by China was something the US government was concerned to avoid, but President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had given commitments to uphold South Vietnam against  communist [[North Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;Westmoreland's War: Reassessing American Strategy in Vietnam  By Gregory Daddis p74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globetrotter.berkeley.edu"&gt;Conversations with History: Institute of International Studies, UC Berkeley [http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/conversations/Summers/ Harry Kreisler of the Institute of International Studies and Colonel Harry G. Summers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Westmoreland's War: Reassessing American Strategy in Vietnam,  By Gregory Daddis p74&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]], General [[Harold Keith Johnson]], and subsequently historians such as [[Harry G. Summers, Jr.]] came to see US goals as having become mutually inconsistent, because defeating the Communists would require declaring a national emergency and fully mobilising the resources of the US. President Johnson was critical of Westmoreland's defused corporate style, considering him overattentive to what government officials wanted to hear. Nonetheless, Westmoreland was operating within longstanding army protocols of subordinating the military to civilian policymakers. The most important constraint was staying on the strategic defensive out of fear of Chinese intervention, but at the same time President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had made it clear that there was a higher commitment to defending Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Peter J. Schifferle 1994"&gt;The Ia Drang Campaign 1965: A Successful Operational Campaign or Mere Tactical Failure?, Peter J. Schifferle (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Parameters.To Change a War: General Harold K. Johnson and the PROVN Study, LEWIS SORLEY&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the thinking about defense was by academics turned government advisors who concentrated on nuclear weapons, seen as making conventional war obsolete. The fashion for counter-insurgency thinking also denigrated the role of [[conventional warfare]]. Despite the inconclusive outcome of the Korean War, Americans expected their wars to end with the unconditional surrender of the enemy.&lt;ref name="globetrotter.berkeley.edu"/&gt;

The [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]] of 2 August 1964 led to a dramatic increase in direct American participation in the war, with nearly 200,000 troops deployed by the end of the year. [[Viet Cong and PAVN strategy, organization and structure]] meant Westmoreland faced a dual threat. Regular North Vietnamese army units infiltrating across the remote border were apparently concentrating to mount an offensive and Westmoreland considered this the danger that had to be tackled immediately. There was also entrenched guerrilla subversion throughout the heavily populated coastal regions by the [[Viet Cong]]. Consistent with the enthusiasm of [[Robert McNamara]] for statistics, Westmoreland placed emphasis on [[body count]] and cited the [[Battle of Ia Drang]] as evidence the communists were losing. However, the government wished to win at low cost, and policymakers received McNamara's interpretation indicating huge American casualties in prospect, prompting a reassessment of what could be achieved. Moreover, the Battle of Ia Drang was unusual in that US troops brought a large enemy formation to battle. After talking to junior officers General Johnson became skeptical about localised concentrated [[search and destroy]] sweeps of short duration, because the Communist forces controlled whether there were military engagements, giving an option to simply avoid battle with US forces if the situation warranted it. The alternative of sustained countrywide pacification operations, which would require massive use of US manpower, was never available to Westmoreland, because it was considered politically unacceptable.&lt;ref name="Peter J. Schifferle 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Westmoreland p96"&gt;Westmoreland: The General who Lost Vietnam  By Lewis Sorley p96&lt;/ref&gt;

In public at least, he continued to be sanguine about the progress being made throughout his time in Vietnam, though supportive journalist [[James Reston]] thought  Westmoreland's characterizing of the conflict as [[attrition warfare]] presented his generalship in a misleading light.&lt;ref&gt;Westmoreland's War: Reassessing American Strategy in Vietnam,  By Gregory Daddis p74-5&lt;/ref&gt; Westmoreland's critics say his successor, General [[Creighton Abrams]], deliberately switched emphasis away from what Westmoreland dubbed attrition. Revisionists point to Abrams's first big operation being a tactical success that disrupted North Vietnamese build up, but resulted in the [[Battle of Hamburger Hill]], a  political disaster that effectively curtailed Abrams's freedom to continue with such operations.&lt;ref name="Peter J.

;Commander in South Vietnam

Westmoreland was sent to Vietnam in 1963. In January 1964, he became deputy commander of [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] (MACV), eventually succeeding [[Paul D. Harkins]] as commander, in June. Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]] told President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in April that Westmoreland was "the best we have, without question".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Best in the Army|url=http://whitehousetapes.net/clip/lyndon-johnson-robert-mcnamara-best-army|work=Presidential Recordings Program|accessdate=16 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the head of the MACV, he was known for highly publicized, positive assessments of U.S. military prospects in [[South Vietnam|Vietnam]]. However, as time went on, the strengthening of communist combat forces in the South led to regular requests for increases in U.S. troop strength, from 16,000 when he arrived to its peak of 535,000 in 1968 when he was promoted to [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army chief of staff]].

On April 28, 1967, Westmoreland addressed a joint session of Congress. "In evaluating the enemy strategy", he said, "it is evident to me that he believes our Achilles heel is our resolve. ... Your continued strong support is vital to the success of our mission. ... Backed at home by resolve, confidence, patience, determination, and continued support, we will prevail in Vietnam over the communist aggressor!" Westmoreland claimed that under his leadership, United States forces "won every battle".&lt;ref name = "Sheehan"&gt;Sheehan, Neil ''A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann And America in Vietnam'' 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The turning point of the war was the 1968 [[Tet Offensive]], in which [[Communism|communist]] forces attacked cities and towns throughout [[South Vietnam]]. At the time, Westmoreland was focused on the [[Battle of Khe Sanh]] and considered the Tet Offensive to be a diversionary attack. It is not clear if Khe Sanh was meant to be distraction for the Tet Offensive or vice versa;&lt;ref&gt;Willbanks, James H. ''The Tet Offensive: A Concise History''. Columbia University Press, 2007, pp. 104–09&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes this is called the [[Battle of Khe Sanh#Riddle of Khe Sanh|Riddle of Khe Sanh]]. Regardless, U.S. and South Vietnamese troops successfully fought off the attacks during the Tet Offensive, and the communist forces took heavy losses, but the ferocity of the assault shook public confidence in Westmoreland's previous assurances about the state of the war. Political debate and public opinion led the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Administration|Johnson administration]] to limit further increases in U.S. troop numbers in Vietnam. Nine months afterward, when the [[My Lai Massacre]] reports started to break, Westmoreland resisted pressure from the incoming [[Nixon administration]] for a cover-up,{{citation needed|date=October 2009}} and pressed for a full and impartial investigation by Lieutenant General [[William Peers|William R. Peers]]. However, a few days after the tragedy, he had praised the same involved unit on the "outstanding job", for the "U.S. infantrymen had killed 128 Communists [''sic''] in a bloody day-long battle". Post 1969 Westmoreland also made efforts to investigate the [[Phong Nhị and Phong Nhất massacre]] a year after the event occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://h21.hani.co.kr/section-021003000/2000/021003000200011150334008.html|title="한국군도 많이 당했다" 채명신 전 주월한국군총사령관 인터뷰… 남베트남군 사령관 만나 사과한 적도|author=Kim Chang-seok|newspaper=[[Hankyoreh]]|date=2000-11-15|accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westmoreland was convinced that the Vietnamese communists could be destroyed by fighting a war of [[Attrition warfare|attrition]] that, theoretically, would render the [[Vietnam People's Army]] unable to fight. His war strategy was marked by heavy use of artillery and airpower and repeated attempts to engage the communists in large-unit battles, and thereby exploit the US's vastly superior firepower and technology. However, the [[North Vietnamese Army]] (NVA) and the [[National Liberation Front of South Vietnam]] (NLF) were able to dictate the pace of attrition to fit their own goals: by continuing to fight a guerrilla war and avoiding large-unit battles, they denied the Americans the chance to fight the kind of war they were best at, and they ensured that attrition would wear down the American public's support for the war faster than they.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nation.time.com/2011/09/30/the-general-who-lost-vietnam/|title=The General Who Lost Vietnam|first=Mark|last=Thompson|publisher=|via=[[time.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:General William Westmoreland and President Lyndon B. Johnson in the Oval Office - NARA - 192557.tif|thumb|General Westmoreland with Lyndon B. Johnson in the White House, November 1967.]]
Westmoreland repeatedly rebuffed or suppressed attempts by [[John Paul Vann]] and [[Lew Walt]] to shift to a "pacification" strategy.&lt;ref name="Sheehan" /&gt; Westmoreland had little appreciation of the patience of the American public for his time frame, and was struggling to persuade President Johnson to approve widening the war into [[Kingdom of Cambodia (1953–1970)|Cambodia]] and [[Kingdom of Laos|Laos]] in order to interdict the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]]. He was unable to use the absolutist stance that "we can't win unless we expand the war". Instead, he focused on "positive indicators", which ultimately turned worthless when the Tet Offensive occurred, since all his pronouncements of "positive indicators" did not hint at the possibility of such a last-gasp dramatic event. Tet outmaneuvered all of Westmoreland's pronouncements on "positive indicators" in the minds of the American public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McPherson|first1=Harry|title=Vietnam, a television history: Tet (1968) minute 3:24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oMu3MHsmxM|publisher=PBS|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the communists were severely depleted by the heavy fighting at Khe Sanh when their conventional assaults were battered by American firepower, as well as tens of thousands of deaths in the Tet Offensive, American political opinion and the panic engendered by the communist surprise sapped U.S. support for the war, even though the events of early 1968 put the United States and South Vietnam into a much stronger military position.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

At one point in 1968, Westmoreland considered the use of [[nuclear weapons]] in Vietnam in a contingency plan codenamed [[Fracture Jaw]], which was abandoned when it became known to the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/world/asia/vietnam-war-nuclear-weapons.html|title=U.S. General Considered Nuclear Response in Vietnam War, Cables Show|last=Sanger|first=David E.|date=October 6, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Army Chief of Staff===
In June 1968, Westmoreland was replaced by General [[Creighton Abrams]], the decision being announced shortly after the Tet Offensive. Although the decision had been made in late 1967, it was widely seen in the media as a punishment for being caught off guard by the communist assault. He was mentioned in a ''Time'' magazine article as a potential candidate for the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 Republican presidential nomination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836932-9,00.html|title=The Temper of the Times|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=1967-04-14|accessdate=2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:General William Westmoreland Press Conference Outside the White House - NARA - 192558.tif|thumb|Press conference outside the White House in April 1968.]]
Westmoreland served as [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] from 1968 to 1972. In 1970, as Chief of Staff, in response to the [[My Lai Massacre]] by United States Army forces (and subsequent cover up by the Army chain of command), he commissioned an army investigation that compiled a comprehensive and seminal study of leadership within the army during the Vietnam War demonstrating a severe erosion of adherence to the army's officer code of "Duty, Honor, Country". The report, entitled ''Study on Military Professionalism'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA063748|accessdate=19 Oct 2015|publisher=[[US Army War College]]|title=Study on Military Professionalism|date=30 June 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; had a profound influence on Army policies, beginning with Westmoreland's decision to end the policy that officers serving in Vietnam would be rotated into a different post after only six months. However, to lessen the impact of this damaging report, Westmoreland ordered that the document be kept on "close hold" across the entire Army for a period of two years and not disseminated to War College attendees. The report only became known to the public after Westmoreland retired in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Generals: American Military Command from World War II to Today|author=Ricks, Thomas E|isbn=1594204047|publisher=The Penguin Press|date=30 Oct 2012|chapter=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many military historians have pointed out that Westmoreland became Chief of Staff at the worst time in history with regard to the army. Guiding the army as it transitioned to an all-volunteer force, he issued many directives to try to make Army life better and more palatable for United States youth—e.g., allowing soldiers to wear sideburns and to drink beer in the mess hall. However, many hard-liners scorned these as too liberal.

==Later years==
Westmoreland ran unsuccessfully for governor of [[South Carolina]] in the [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1974|1974 election]]. He published his autobiography the following year. Westmoreland later served on a task force to improve educational standards in the state of South Carolina.

In 1986, Westmoreland served as [[grand marshal]] of the Chicago Vietnam Veterans parade. The parade, attended by 200,000 Vietnam veterans and more than half a million spectators, did much to repair the rift between Vietnam veterans and the American public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/14/us/vietnam-veterans-in-chicago-parade-cheered-by-crowds.html|work=The New York Times|title=Vietnam Veterans In Chicago Parade Cheered By Crowds|date=June 14, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/24930165.html?dids=24930165:24930165&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+17%2C+1986&amp;author=Article+by+William+Mullen%2C+A+Sunday+Magazine+staff+writer&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=AT+PEACE%2C+AT+LAST+AFTER+11+YEARS+AND+AN+EMOTIONAL+PARADE%2C+VIETNAM+VETS+FINALLY+FEEL+WELCOME&amp;pqatl=google At peace, at last after 11 years and an emotional parade, Vietnam vets finally feel welcome]. ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. August 17, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Westmoreland versus CBS: ''The Uncounted Enemy''==
[[Mike Wallace]] interviewed Westmoreland for the [[CBS]] special ''[[The Uncounted Enemy]]: A Vietnam Deception''. The documentary, shown on January 23, 1982, and prepared largely by CBS producer [[George Crile III]], alleged that Westmoreland and others had deliberately underestimated [[Viet Cong]] troop strength during 1967 in order to maintain U.S. troop morale and domestic support for the war. Westmoreland filed a lawsuit against CBS.

In ''[[Westmoreland v. CBS]]'', Westmoreland sued Wallace and CBS for [[libel]], and a lengthy legal process began. Just days before the lawsuit was to go to the jury, Westmoreland suddenly settled with CBS for an apology, no more than CBS had originally offered. Some contend that Judge Leval's instructions to the jury over what constituted "actual malice" to prove libel convinced Westmoreland's lawyers that he was certain to lose.&lt;ref name="jrank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/12756/Westmoreland-v-CBS-Inc.html|title=Westmoreland v. CBS – further readings|accessdate=2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IsYIhP_8G4C&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=westmoreland+v+cbs&amp;source=web&amp;ots=fPkP_7K7jo&amp;sig=pOWzfwlLsEzYdHYZzTwvXbzSWI8|title=The Tet Offensive: Intelligence Failure in War|publisher=Cornell University Press|accessdate=2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others point out that the settlement occurred after two of Westmoreland's former intelligence officers, Major General Joseph McChristian and Colonel Gains Hawkins, testified to the accuracy of the substantive allegations of the broadcast, which were that Westmoreland ordered changes in intelligence reports on Viet Cong troop strengths for political reasons. Disagreements persist about the appropriateness of some of the methods of CBS's editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/W/htmlW/wallacemike/wallacemike.htm|title=Mike Wallace|publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|accessdate=2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A deposition by McChristian indicates that his organization developed improved intelligence on the number of irregular Viet Cong combatants shortly before he left Vietnam on a regularly scheduled rotation. The numbers troubled Westmoreland, who feared that the press would not understand them. He did not order them changed, but instead did not include the information in reporting to Washington, which in his view was a decision that the data was not appropriate to report.

Based on later analysis of the information from all sides, it appears clear that Westmoreland could not sustain a libel suit because CBS's principal allegation was that he had caused intelligence officers to suppress facts. Westmoreland's anger was caused by the implication of the broadcast that his intent was fraudulent and that he ordered others to lie.

During the acrimonious trial, Mike Wallace was hospitalized for depression, and despite the legal conflict separating the two, Westmoreland and his wife sent him flowers. Wallace's memoir is generally sympathetic to Westmoreland, although he makes it clear he disagreed with him on issues surrounding the Vietnam War and the Nixon Administration's policies in Southeast Asia.

==Views on Vietnam War==
[[File:Westmoreland.png|thumb|[[Herbert Abrams|Herbert Elmer Abrams]]' portrait of General Westmoreland]]
In a 1998 interview for ''[[George (magazine)|George]]'' magazine, Westmoreland criticized the battlefield prowess of his direct opponent, North Vietnamese general [[Võ Nguyên Giáp]]. "Of course, he [Giap] was a formidable adversary", Westmoreland told correspondent [[W. Thomas Smith, Jr.|W. Thomas Smith Jr.]] "Let me also say that Giap was trained in small-unit, guerrilla tactics, but he persisted in waging a big-unit war with terrible losses to his own men. By his own admission, by early 1969, I think, he had lost, what, a half million soldiers? He reported this. Now such a disregard for human life may make a formidable adversary, but it does not make a military genius. An American commander losing men like that would hardly have lasted more than a few weeks." In the 1974 film ''[[Hearts and Minds (film)|Hearts and Minds]]'', Westmoreland opined that "The Oriental doesn't put the same high price on life as does a Westerner. Life is plentiful, life is cheap in the Orient. And as the philosophy of the Orient expresses it: Life is not important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Quỳnh Phạm|author2=Himadeep Muppidi|editor1-last=Blaney|editor1-first=David L.|editor2-last=Tickner|editor2-first=Arlene B.|title=Claiming the International|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|isbn=978-0-415-63068-9|page=179|chapter=Wrestling the Frame}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westmoreland's view has been heavily criticized by [[Nick Turse]], the author of the book ''Kill Anything That Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam''. Turse said that many of the Vietnamese killed were actually innocent civilians, and the Vietnamese casualties were not just caused by military cross-fire but were a direct result of the U.S. policy and tactics, for example the policy "kill everything that moves" which enabled the U.S. soldiers to shoot civilians for "suspicious behavior". He concluded that, after having "spoken to survivors of massacres by United States forces at Phi Phu, Trieu Ai, My Luoc and so many other hamlets, I can say with certainty that Westmoreland's assessment was false". He also accused Westmoreland of concealing evidence of atrocities from the American public when he was the Army Chief of Staff.&lt;ref name = "nick"&gt;[[Nick Turse|Turse, Nick]] (October 9, 2013). [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/opinion/for-america-life-was-cheap-in-vietnam.html?_r=0 "For America, Life Was Cheap in Vietnam"]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In more than a decade of analyzing long-classified military criminal investigation files, court-martial transcripts, Congressional studies, contemporaneous journalism and the testimony of United States soldiers and Vietnamese civilians, I found that Gen. William C. Westmoreland, his subordinates, superiors and successors also engaged in a profligate disregard for human life.|Nick Turse&lt;ref name="nick"/&gt;}}

Historian Derek Frisby also criticized Westmoreland's view during an interview with ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'':

{{quote|General William Westmoreland, who commanded US military operations in the Vietnam War, unhesitatingly believed Giap was a butcher for relentlessly sacrificing his soldiers in unwinnable battles. Yet, that assessment in itself is key to understanding the West's failure to defeat him. Giap understood that protracted warfare would cost many lives but that did not always translate into winning or losing the war. In the final analysis, Giap won the war despite losing many battles, and as long as the army survived to fight another day, the idea of Vietnam lived in the hearts of the people who would support it, and that is the essence of "revolutionary war".|Derek Frisby&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Domínguez [http://www.dw.de/vo-nguyen-giap-a-master-of-revolutionary-war/a-17141733 Vo Nguyen Giap – 'A master of revolutionary war'] Deutsche Welle, 07.10.2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For the remainder of his life, Westmoreland maintained that the United States did not lose the war in Vietnam; he stated instead that "our country did not fulfill its commitment to South Vietnam. By virtue of Vietnam, the U.S. held the line for 10 years and stopped the [[Domino theory|dominoes from falling]]."

==Personal life==
Westmoreland first met his future wife, Katherine (Kitsy) Stevens Van Deusen, while stationed at [[Fort Sill]]; she was nine years old at the time and was the daughter of the post executive officer, Colonel Edwin R. Van Deusen. Westmoreland met her again in North Carolina when she was nineteen and a student at [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]]. The couple married in May 1947 and had three children: a daughter, Katherine Stevens; a son, James Ripley II, and another daughter, Margaret Childs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/20/international/asia/20westmoreland.html?pagewanted=print|title=William C.

Just hours after Westmoreland was sworn in as Army Chief of Staff on July 7, 1968, his brother-in-law, Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Van Deusen (commander of 2nd Battalion, [[47th Infantry Regiment (United States)|47th Infantry Regiment]]), was killed when his helicopter was shot down in the [[Mekong Delta]] region of Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyarmy.org/panel/battle/68070702.HTM|title=Westy In-law Dies in Viet|date=1968-07-07|work=[[Pacific Stars and Stripes]]|accessdate=2007-09-14|series=6807PSS.AVN, 68070399.KIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westmoreland died on July 18, 2005, at the age of 91 at the Bishop Gadsden retirement home in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. He had suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease]] during the final years of his life. He was buried on July 23, 2005, at the [[West Point Cemetery]], [[United States Military Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americansportscastersonline.com/westmorelandmemoriam.html|title=General William Westmoreland, Friend of ASA, Dies|date=1991-05-31|publisher=[[American Sportscasters Online]]|accessdate=2011-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[General William C.

In 1996, the [[National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution]] authorized the General William C. Westmoreland award. The award is given each year in recognition to an outstanding SAR veterans volunteer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sar.org/Committees/Veterans/Westmoreland_Award|title=General William C.
