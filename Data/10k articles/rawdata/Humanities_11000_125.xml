      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2759">'''Advice''', in [[constitutional law]], is formal, usually binding, instruction given by one constitutional officer of state to another. Especially in [[parliamentary system|parliamentary systems of government]], [[Head of state|heads of state]] often act on the basis of advice issued by [[Prime Minister|prime ministers]] or other government ministers. For example, in [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], the monarch usually appoints [[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]] on the advice of his or her prime minister.

Among the most prominent forms of advice offered are:
* Advice to appoint and remove individual ministers.
* Advice to [[dissolve parliament]].
* Advice to deliver formal statements, such as a [[speech from the throne]].

In some states, the duty to accept advice is legally enforceable, having been created by a constitution or statute. For example, the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law of Germany]] requires the [[President of Germany|President]] to appoint federal ministers on the advice of the [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]]. In others, especially under the [[Westminster system]], advice may legally be rejected; for example, in several [[Commonwealth realm]]s, [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] is not legally obliged to accept the advice of her ministers. This lack of obligation forms part of the basis for the Queen's [[reserve powers]]. Nevertheless, the [[constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]] that the head of state accept ministerial advice is so strong that in ordinary circumstances, refusal to do so would almost certainly provoke a [[constitutional crisis]]. 

Although most advice is binding, in comparatively rare instances it is not. For example, many heads of state may choose not to follow advice on a dissolution of parliament where the government has lost the confidence of that body. In some cases, whether the advice is mandatory or truly just advisory depends on the context and authority of the person offering it. Hence the [[President of Ireland]] ordinarily is obliged to dissolve ''[[Dáil Éireann]]'' (the House of Representatives) when advised  to do so by the ''[[Taoiseach]]'' (prime minister). However, where a ''taoiseach'' has (in the words of the [[Constitution of Ireland]]) "ceased to retain the support of a majority in ''Dáil Éireann''" (i.e., lost the confidence of parliament) the President has the option of refusing to follow that advice.&lt;ref&gt;Article 13.2.2. of ''Constitution of Ireland'' (1937)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1787">'''Amana German''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Amana-Deutsch'' or ''Kolonie-Deutsch'') is a dialect of [[West Central German]] that is still spoken by several hundred people in the [[Amana Colonies]] in [[Iowa]].

The Amana Colonies were founded in 1856 by [[Inspirationalists]] of [[Germans|German origin]] who came from [[West Seneca, New York|West Seneca]] near [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] in [[New York (state)|New York]]. Amana is derived from the [[Hessian dialect]], which is a West Central German dialect. There are seven villages in Amana with slightly different dialect features.

Even though the use of the language is in decline, it is far from being [[Endangered language|moribund]]. There are several major studies about the language of Amana.&lt;ref&gt; Philip E. Webber: ''Kolonie-Deutsch: Life and Language in Amana'', Ames, 2006, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anglo-Americans''' are people who are English-speaking inhabitants of [[Anglo-America]]. It typically refers to the nations and ethnic groups in the Americas that speak English as a native language who comprise the majority of people who speak [[English language|English]] as a [[first language|first language]]. This usage originated in the discussion of the history of English-speaking people of the United States and the Spanish-speaking people residing in the [[western United States]] during the [[Mexican–American War]].{{dubious|the French English conflict had been going on much longer|date=October 2018}}

== Usage ==
The term is ambiguous and used in several different ways. While it is primarily used to refer to people of [[England|English]] ancestry, it (along with terms like ''[[Anglo]]'', ''Anglic'', ''[[English-speaking world|Anglophone]]'', and ''Anglophonic'') also used to denote all people of British or Northern European ancestry&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/anglo Oxford English Dictionary: "Anglo"] ''North American A white English-speaking person of British or northern European origin, in particular (in the US) as distinct from a Hispanic American or (in Canada) as distinct from a French-speaker.''&lt;/ref&gt; or all people of European ethnic origin who speak English as a mother tongue and their descendants in the New World, regardless of their prior racial or ethnic background, much like ''Hispanic'' refers to people of any race.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Mish, Frederic C., Editor in Chief ''Webster's Tenth New Collegiate Dictionary'' Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A.:1994--Merriam-Webster See original definition (definition #1) of ''Anglo'' in English: It is defined as a synonym for ''Anglo-American''--Page 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dictionary.com"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Anglo | title = Anglo – Definitions from Dictionary.com; American Heritage Dictionary | accessdate = 2008-03-29 | quote = Usage Note: In contemporary American usage, Anglo is used primarily in direct contrast to Hispanic or Latino. In this context it is not limited to persons of English or even British descent, but can be generally applied to any [[non-Hispanic white]] person, making mother tongue (in this case English) the primary factor. Thus in parts of the United States such as the [[Southwest United States]] with large Hispanic populations, an American of Polish, Irish, or German heritage might be termed an Anglo just as readily as a person of English descent. However, in parts of the country where the Hispanic community is smaller or nonexistent, or in areas where ethnic distinctions among European groups remain strong, Anglo has little currency as a catch-all term for non-Hispanic whites. Anglo is also used in non-Hispanic contexts. In Canada, where its usage dates at least to 1800, the distinction is between persons of English and French descent. And in American historical contexts Anglo is apt to be used more strictly to refer to persons of English heritage, as in this passage describing the politics of nation-building in pre-Revolutionary America: "The 'unity' of the American people derived ... from the ability and willingness of an Anglo elite to stamp its image on other peoples coming to this country" (Benjamin Schwarz). |publisher= Lexico Publishing Group, LLC| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080315013806/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Anglo| archivedate= 15 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a person, for example, of Chinese descent who adopts the American or Canadian culture would have English-speaking "Anglo-American", "Anglic", "Anglophone", "Anglo", or "Anglophonic" children (in contrast to Spanish-speaking Chinese descent people living in Hispanic America, who would be "Hispanic"). Thus, ''Anglo-American'', ''Anglic-American'', ''Anglophone-American'', ''Anglo'', or ''Anglophonic-American'' can refer to all those whose families who, regardless of race or ethnicity, have become mainstream English-speaking people in the United States, English Canada, English-speaking areas of the Caribbean, Belize, and Guyana, including those of [[Afro-Anglo American|African descent]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 2017, the [[Pew Research Center]] reported that 18% of people who identify as Hispanic in the United States speak English as a first language compared to 90% of non-Hispanics.&lt;ref name=PRCFade&gt;{{Cite web|last1= Gonzalex-Barrera   |first1=Ana|last2= Lopez |first2=Gustavo |last3= Lopez |first3=Mark Hugo |authorlink=   |title=Hispanic Identity Fades Across Generations as Immigrant Connections Fall Away   |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|date= December 20, 2017|url=http://www.pewhispanic.org/2017/12/20/hispanic-identity-fades-across-generations-as-immigrant-connections-fall-away/  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
The term implies a relationship between the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] (specifically [[England]]), or the two countries' shared language, English, and/or cultural heritage. In this context the term may refer to an [[English American]], a person from the United States whose ancestry originates wholly or partly in England, a person from the United States who speaks English as their first language (see [[American English]]), a collective term referring to those countries that have similar legal systems based on [[common law]], [[United Kingdom–United States relations|relations]] between the United Kingdom and United States, or [[Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules]], a national cataloging code.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dictionary.com" /&gt;

The term is also used, less frequently, to denote a connection between English people (or the English language) and the Western Hemisphere as a whole. In this context, the term can mean a person from the Americas whose ancestry originates wholly or partly in England (see [[British diaspora]]) or a person from the Americas who is a [[white American]] and speaks English as their first language, a person from the Americas who speaks English as their first language (see [[English-speaking world]] and [[Languages of the Americas]]), or a person from [[Anglo-America]].

== Adjective ==
The adjective Anglo-American is used in the following ways:
* to denote the cultural sphere shared by the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]] and [[English Canada|English]] [[Canada]]. For example, "Anglo-American culture is different from French culture." Political leaders including [[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] have used the term to discuss the "[[Special Relationship]]" between Britain and America.
* to describe relations between Britain and the United States. For example, "[[United Kingdom–United States relations|Anglo-American relations]] became more relaxed after the [[War of 1812]]."

'''Aristotle''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ær|ɪ|ˌ|s|t|ɒ|t|əl}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/aristotle "Aristotle"] entry in ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc-gre|[[:el:Αριστοτέλης|Ἀριστοτέλης]]}} ''Aristotélēs'', {{IPA-grc|aristotélɛːs|pron}}; 384–322&amp;nbsp;BC){{refn|That these dates (the first half of the Olympiad year 384/383 BC, and in 322 shortly before the death of Demosthenes) are correct was shown by [[August Boeckh]] (''Kleine Schriften'' VI 195); for further discussion, see [[Felix Jacoby]] on ''[[FGrHist]]'' 244 F 38. Ingemar Düring, ''Aristotle in the Ancient Biographical Tradition'',  Göteborg, 1957, {{p.|253}}|group= n}} was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]] and scientist born in the city of [[Stagira (ancient city)|Stagira]], [[Chalkidiki]], in the north of [[Classical Greece]]. Along with [[Plato]], he is considered the "Father of Western Philosophy". Aristotle provided a complex and harmonious synthesis of the various existing philosophies prior to him, including those of Socrates and Plato, and it was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its fundamental intellectual lexicon, as well as problems and methods of inquiry. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be central to the contemporary philosophical discussion.

Little is known about his life. His father, [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined [[Plato's Academy]] in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven ([[Circa|c.]] 347 BC).&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt; His writings cover many subjects – including [[Physics (Aristotle)|physics]], [[biology]], [[zoology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], ethics, [[aesthetics]], [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetry]], theatre, music, [[rhetoric]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[economics]], [[politics]] and government&amp;nbsp;– and constitute the first comprehensive system of [[Western philosophy]]. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of [[Philip II of Macedon]], tutored [[Alexander the Great]] beginning in 343 BC.&lt;ref name="philosophy1972"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1972. Book One. Ancient Philosophy, Part II. Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, Chapter XXII. {{isbn|978-0671201586}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching Alexander gave Aristotle many opportunities. He established a library in the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books, which were [[papyrus]] [[scrolls]]. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of [[Platonism]], but, following Plato's death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to [[empiricism]].{{sfn|Barnes|1995|p=16}} He believed all concepts and knowledge were ultimately based on [[perception]]. Aristotle's views on [[natural science]]s represent the groundwork underlying many of his works.

Aristotle's views on [[Aristotelian physics|physical science]] profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Their influence extended from [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]] into the [[Renaissance]], and were not replaced systematically until [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] and theories such as [[classical mechanics]]. Some of Aristotle's [[zoology|zoological]] observations, such as on the [[Hectocotylus|hectocotyl (reproductive) arm]] of the [[octopus]], were disbelieved until the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, studied by medieval scholars such as [[Peter Abelard]] and [[John Buridan]]. [[Aristotelianism]] profoundly influenced [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400)|Islamic thought]] during the [[Middle Ages]], as well as [[Christian theology]], especially the [[Neoplatonism]] of the [[Early Church]] and the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Catholic Church]]. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as "The First Teacher". His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]].

All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of academic study. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication.{{sfn|Barnes|1995|p=9}} Aristotle has been depicted by major artists including [[Raphael]] and [[Rembrandt]]. [[Early Modern]] theories including [[William Harvey]]'s [[circulation of the blood]] and [[Galileo Galilei]]'s [[kinematics]] were developed in reaction to Aristotle's. In the 19th century, [[George Boole]] gave Aristotle's logic a mathematical foundation with his system of [[Boolean algebra|algebraic logic]]. In the 20th century, [[Martin Heidegger]] created a new interpretation of Aristotle's political philosophy, but elsewhere Aristotle was widely criticised, even ridiculed by thinkers such as the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] and the biologist [[Peter Medawar]].{{sfn|Leroi|2015|page=353}}&lt;!--and see cited text below--&gt;  More recently, Aristotle has again been taken seriously, such as in the thinking of [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], while [[Armand Marie Leroi]] has reconstructed [[Aristotle's biology]]. The image of Aristotle tutoring the young Alexander remains current, and the ''Poetics'' continues to play a role in the [[cinema of the United States]].

In general, the details of Aristotle's life are not well-established. The biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points.&lt;ref&gt;See Shields, C., "Aristotle's Philosophical Life and Writings" in ''The Oxford Handbook of Aristotle'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2012), {{pp.|3|16}}, {{ISBN|978-0195187489}}. Düring, I., ''Aristotle in the Ancient Biographical Tradition'' (Göteborg, 1957) covers ancient biographies of Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of Aristotle's parents died when he was about thirteen, and [[Proxenus of Atarneus]] became his guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Edith |title=Aristotle's Way: How Ancient Wisdom Can Change Your Life |date=2018 |publisher=[[The Bodley Head]] |page=14 |isbn=978-1847924070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although little information about Aristotle's childhood has survived, he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)#Kingship and the royal court|Macedonian monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Anagnostopoulos | first=Georgios | title=A Companion to Aristotle | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-118-59243-4 | page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of seventeen or eighteen, Aristotle moved to Athens to continue his education at [[Platonic Academy|Plato's Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Blits |first=Kathleen C. |date=1999-04-15 |title=Aristotle: Form, function, and comparative anatomy |journal=The Anatomical Record |volume=257 |issue=2 |pages=58–63 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0185(19990415)257:2&lt;58::AID-AR6&gt;3.0.CO;2-I|pmid=10321433 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving Athens in 348/47&amp;nbsp;BC. The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy's direction after control passed to Plato's nephew [[Speusippus]], although it is possible that he feared the anti-Macedonian sentiments in Athens at that time and left before Plato died.&lt;ref name="Lord Intro"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Lord, Carnes |title=The Politics |author=Aristotle |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=1984 |pages=Introduction |isbn=978-0226921846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle then accompanied [[Xenocrates]] to the court of his friend [[Hermias of Atarneus]] in [[Asia Minor]]. After the death of Hermias, Aristotle travelled with his pupil [[Theophrastus]] to the island of [[Lesbos]], where together they researched the [[botany]] and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon. While in Lesbos, Aristotle married [[Pythias]], either Hermias's adoptive daughter or niece. She bore him a daughter, whom they also named Pythias. In 343 BC, Aristotle was invited by [[Philip II of Macedon]] to become the tutor to his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/aristotle/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Shields|first=Christopher|date=2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philosophy1972"/&gt;

Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of [[Macedon]]. During Aristotle's time in the Macedonian court, he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]].&lt;ref name="Peter Green"&gt;{{cite book |author=Green, Peter |title=Alexander of Macedon |publisher=University of California Press |date=1991 |pages=58–59 |isbn=978-0520275867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest and Aristotle's own attitude towards [[Persia]] was unabashedly [[Ethnocentricism|ethnocentric]]. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be "a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants".&lt;ref name="Peter Green"/&gt; By 335&amp;nbsp;BC, Aristotle had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]]. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with [[Herpyllis]] of Stagira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]]. According to the ''[[Suda]]'', he also had an ''[[eromenos|erômenos]]'', [[Palaephatus|Palaephatus of Abydus]].&lt;ref&gt;William George Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', {{vol.|3}}, [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2421.html {{p.|88}}] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628035803/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2421.html |date=28 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This period in Athens, between 335 and 323 BC, is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works.&lt;ref name="philosophy1972"/&gt; He wrote many dialogues, of which only fragments have survived. Those works that have survived are in [[treatise]] form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', ''[[On the Soul]]'' and ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. Aristotle studied and made significant contributions to "logic, metaphysics, mathematics, physics, biology, botany, ethics, politics, agriculture, medicine, dance and theatre."&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;{{Cite IEP |url-id=aristotl |title=Aristotle (384—322 B.C.E.) |author=Anon |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of his life, Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexander's relationship with Persia and Persians. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but the only evidence of this is an [[Hagnothemis|unlikely claim]] made some six years after the death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Green, Peter |title=Alexander of Macedon |publisher=University of California Press |date=1991 |page=460 |isbn=978-0520275867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled. In 322&amp;nbsp;BC, Demophilus and [[Eurymedon the Hierophant]] reportedly denounced Aristotle for impiety,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Filonik |first=Jakub |date=2013 |title=Athenian impiety trials: a reappraisal |journal=Dike |issue=16 |pages=72–73 |doi=10.13130/1128-8221/4290 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting him to flee to his mother's family estate in [[Chalcis|Chalcis, on Euboea]], at which occasion he was said to have stated: "I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=W.

===Logic===
{{main|Term logic}}
{{details|Non-Aristotelian logic}}

With the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Degnan, Michael |date=1994 |title=Recent Work in Aristotle's Logic |journal=Philosophical Books |volume=35 |issue=2 (April 1994) |pages=81–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th-century advances in [[mathematical logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Corcoran, John |date=2009 |title=Aristotle's Demonstrative Logic |journal=History and Philosophy of Logic |volume=30 |pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] stated in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' that with Aristotle logic reached its completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Immanuel Kant |author=Kant, Immanuel |date=1787 |title=Critique of Pure Reason |edition=Second |pages=Preface |oclc=2323615}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
====History====

Aristotle states that 'on the subject of reasoning' he 'had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Olmos|first=Paula|title=Greek Science in the Long Run: Essays on the Greek Scientific Tradition (4th c. BCE-17th c. CE)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0UsBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-3841-2|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Plato reports that [[syntax]] was devised before him, by [[Prodicus of Ceos]], who was concerned by the correct use of words. Logic seems to have emerged from [[dialectics]]; the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' in their discussions, but never truly understood the logical implications. Even Plato had difficulties with logic; although he spoke of a [[deductive system]], he did not construct one, relying instead on dialectic argument.&lt;ref name="Bochenski 1951"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bocheński | first=I. M. | title=Ancient Formal Logic | publisher=North-Holland | date=1951 | page= |oclc=1024546731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from [[premise]]s, so he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the [[Logical consequence|conclusions]] would logically follow. He realised that a method for obtaining conclusions would be beneficial. He never devised such a method, but in his book ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', he introduced his division method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Rose | first=Lynn E. | title=Aristotle's Syllogistic | publisher=Charles C.

What we today call ''Aristotelian logic'' with its [[Syllogism#Types|types of syllogism]] (methods of logical argument),&lt;ref name=SEPmedieval-syllogism&gt;{{cite SEP|url-id=medieval-syllogism |title=Medieval Theories of the Syllogism |author=Lagerlund, Henrik |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle himself would have labelled "analytics". The term "logic" he reserved to mean ''dialectics''. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the ''[[Organon]]'' around 40 BC by [[Andronicus of Rhodes]] or others among his followers.&lt;ref name=Pickover2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Pickover |first=Clifford A. |title=The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, 250 Milestones in the History of Mathematics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrslMKTgSZwC&amp;pg=PA52 |year=2009 |publisher=Sterling |isbn=978-1-4027-5796-9 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books are:

# ''Categories''
# ''On Interpretation''
# ''Prior Analytics''
# ''Posterior Analytics''
# ''Topics''
# ''On Sophistical Refutations''

The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the ''Categories,'' the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in ''On Interpretation'', to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the ''Analytics'')&lt;ref&gt;"Prior Analytics", 24b18–20; [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/#SynSemSen Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: ''Ancient Logic'': Aristotle: Non-Modal Syllogistic] and [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/#ModLog ''Ancient Logic'': Aristotle: Modal Logic]&lt;/ref&gt; and dialectics (in the ''Topics'' and ''Sophistical Refutations''). The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory ''stricto sensu'': the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. The ''Rhetoric'' is not conventionally included, but it states that it relies on the ''Topics''.&lt;ref name=SEParistotle-logic&gt;{{cite SEP|url-id=aristotle-logic|author=Smith, Robin|title=Aristotle's Logic|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epistemology===
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Plato]] (left) and Aristotle in [[Raphael]]'s 1509 fresco, ''[[The School of Athens]]''. Aristotle holds his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and gestures to the earth, representing empirical observation, whilst Plato gestures to the heavens, representing [[The Forms]], and holds his ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The School of Athens by Raphael |url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/famous-paintings/school-of-athens.htm |publisher=Visual Arts Cork |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Like his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]]. Aristotle's [[ontology]] places the universal (''katholou'') in [[particular]]s (''kath' hekaston''), things in the world, whereas for Plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate. This means that Aristotle's [[epistemology]] is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world, and rises to knowledge of the universal, whereas for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal [[Theory of Forms|Forms]] (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these.&lt;ref name=SEParistotle-logic/&gt; For Aristotle, "form" is still what [[phenomena]] are based on, but is "instantiated" in a particular substance.&lt;ref name=SEPsubstuniv/&gt; Aristotle uses [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] from examples alongside [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], whereas Plato relies on deduction from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles.&lt;ref name=SEParistotle-logic/&gt;

In Aristotle's terminology, "natural philosophy" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. Aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. Aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as "science". Note, however, that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term "scientific method". For Aristotle, "all science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or theoretical" (''Metaphysics'' 1025b25). His practical science includes ethics and politics; his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry; his theoretical science covers physics, mathematics and metaphysics.&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt;

===Metaphysics===
{{main|Metaphysics (Aristotle)}}
The word "metaphysics" appears to have been coined by the first century AD editor who assembled various small selections of Aristotle's works to the treatise we know by the name ''Metaphysics''.&lt;ref name="Stanford.Enc.Philosophy"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cohen |first1=S. Marc |title=Aristotle's Metaphysics |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-metaphysics/ |date=2000-10-08 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab Center for the Study of Language and Information Stanford University Stanford, CA 94305-4115 |accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle called it "first philosophy", and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science (physics) as the contemplative (''theoretikē'') philosophy which is "theological" and studies the divine. He wrote in his ''Metaphysics'' (1026a16):

{{quote|if there were no other independent things besides the composite natural ones, the study of nature would be the primary kind of knowledge; but if there is some motionless independent thing, the knowledge of this precedes it and is first philosophy, and it is universal ''in just this way'', because it is first. And it belongs to this sort of philosophy to study being as being, both what it is and what belongs to it just by virtue of being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |author2=Sachs, Joe (trans.) |title=Aristotle's ''Metaphysics'' |year=1999 |page=111 |publisher=Green Lion Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Substance, potentiality and actuality====
{{see|Hylomorphism|Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)}}

Aristotle examines the concepts of [[Substance theory|substance]] (''ousia'') and [[essence]] (''to ti ên einai'', "the what it was to be") in his ''Metaphysics'' (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form, a philosophical theory called [[hylomorphism]]. In Book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the [[Material substratum|substratum]], or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the ''potential'' house, while the form of the substance is the ''actual'' house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other [[Genus-differentia definition|differentia]] that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1043a 10–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SEPactupote&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=aristotle-metaphysics/#ActuPote |title=Aristotle's Metaphysics |first=S. Marc |last=Cohen |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the change (''[[Potentiality and actuality|kinesis]]'') and its causes now, as he defines in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'' 319b–320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from:
# growth and diminution, which is change in quantity;
# locomotion, which is change in space; and
# alteration, which is change in quality.

[[File:Flute-player dolphin Alcesti Group MAN.jpg|thumb|Aristotle argued that a capability like playing the flute could be acquired – [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|the potential made actual]] – by learning.]]

The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (''[[Dunamis|dynamis]]'') and actuality (''[[entelecheia]]'') in association with the matter and the form. Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (''dynamei'') plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (''poiein'') or 'be acted upon' (''paschein''), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate – being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise – acting). Actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (''telos'') is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.&lt;ref name=SEPactupote/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For that for the sake of which (''to hou heneka'') a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' IX 1050a 5–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a [[final cause]] or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality. With this definition of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, "what is it that makes a man one"? Since, according to [[Plato]] there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same.&lt;ref name=SEPactupote/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1045a–b&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SEPsubstdef&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=aristotle-metaphysics/#SubsDefi |title=Aristotle's Metaphysics: Substance and Definition |first=S. Marc |last=Cohen |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Universals and particulars====
[[File:Platonic and Aristotelian Forms.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|[[Plato]]'s [[Theory of forms|forms]] exist as [[universals]], like the ideal form of an apple. For Aristotle, both matter and form belong to the individual thing ([[hylomorphism]]).]]
{{main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}

Plato argued that all things have a [[Theory of forms|universal form]], which could be either a property or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyse a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other. Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but "good" is still a proper universal form. Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time, and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. Where Plato spoke of the world of forms, a place where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.&lt;ref name=SEPsubstuniv&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=aristotle-metaphysics/#SubsUniv |title=Aristotle's Metaphysics: Substances and Universals |first=S.

In his ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'', Aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by [[Empedocles]], [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], [[Air (classical element)|Air]], and [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], to two of the four sensible qualities, hot, cold, wet, and dry. In the Empedoclean scheme, all matter was made of the four elements, in differing proportions. Aristotle's scheme added the heavenly [[Aether (classical element)|Aether]], the divine substance of the [[Celestial spheres|heavenly spheres]], stars and planets.{{sfn|Lloyd|1968|pages=133–139, 166–169}}

====Motion====
{{see|History of classical mechanics}}

Aristotle describes two kinds of motion: "violent" or "unnatural motion", such as that of a thrown stone, in the ''Physics'' (254b10), and "natural motion", such as of a falling object, in ''On the Heavens'' (300a20). In violent motion, as soon as the agent stops causing it, the motion stops also; in other words, the natural state of an object is to be at rest,&lt;ref name="Allain 2016"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Allain |first1=Rhett |title=I'm So Totally Over Newton's Laws of Motion |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/03/im-totally-newtons-laws-motion/|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=11 May 2018 |date=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Rhett Allain notes that [[Newton's First Law]] is "essentially a direct reply to Aristotle, that the natural state is ''not to change'' motion.&lt;ref name="Allain 2016"/&gt;|group=n}} since Aristotle does not address [[friction]].&lt;ref name="Drabkin1938"/&gt; With this understanding, it can be observed that, as Aristotle stated, heavy objects (on the ground, say) require more force to make them move; and objects pushed with greater force move faster.&lt;ref name="Susskind 2011"/&gt;{{refn|Leonard Susskind comments that Aristotle had clearly never gone [[ice skating]] or he would have seen that it takes force to stop an object.&lt;ref name="Susskind 2011"/&gt;|group=n}} This would imply the equation&lt;ref name="Susskind 2011"/&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;F = mv&lt;/math&gt;,

incorrect in modern physics.&lt;ref name="Susskind 2011"/&gt;

Natural motion depends on the element concerned: the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens,{{refn|For heavenly bodies like the Sun, Moon, and stars, the observed motions are "to a very good approximation" circular around the Earth's centre, (for example, the apparent rotation of the sky because of the rotation of the Earth, and the rotation of the moon around the Earth) as Aristotle stated.&lt;ref name="Rovelli2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rovelli |first1=Carlo |title=Aristotle's Physics: A Physicist's Look |journal=Journal of the American Philosophical Association |volume=1 |issue=1 |year=2015 |pages=23–40 |doi=10.1017/apa.2014.11 |arxiv=1312.4057}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} while the 4 Empedoclean elements move vertically up (like fire, as is observed) or down (like earth) towards their natural resting places.&lt;ref name="Rovelli2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drabkin1938"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Drabkin |first1=Israel E. |title=Notes on the Laws of Motion in Aristotle |journal=The American Journal of Philology |date=1938 |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=60–84| jstor=90584}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Drabkin quotes numerous passages from ''Physics'' and ''On the Heavens'' (''De Caelo'') which state Aristotle's laws of motion.&lt;ref name="Drabkin1938"/&gt;|group=n}}

[[File:Aristotle's laws of motion.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Aristotle's laws of motion. In ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' he states that objects fall at a speed proportional to their weight and inversely proportional to the density of the fluid they are immersed in.&lt;ref name="Drabkin1938"/&gt; This is a correct approximation for objects in Earth's gravitational field moving in air or water.&lt;ref name="Rovelli2015"/&gt;]]

In the ''Physics'' (215a25), Aristotle effectively states a quantitative law, that the speed, v, of a falling body is proportional (say, with constant c) to its weight, W, and inversely proportional to the density,{{refn|Drabkin agrees that density is treated quantitatively in this passage, but without a sharp definition of density as weight per unit volume.&lt;ref name="Drabkin1938"/&gt;|group=n}} ρ, of the fluid in which it is falling:&lt;ref name="Rovelli2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drabkin1938"/&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;v = c\frac{W}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;

Aristotle implies that in a [[vacuum]] the speed of fall would become infinite, and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible.&lt;ref name="Rovelli2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drabkin1938"/&gt; Opinions have varied on whether Aristotle intended to state quantitative laws. Henri Carteron held the "extreme view"&lt;ref name="Drabkin1938"/&gt; that Aristotle's concept of force was basically qualitative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carteron |first1=Henri |title=Notion de Force dans le Systeme d'Aristote |date=1923 |publisher=J. Vrin |location=Paris |pages=1–32 and passim |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other authors reject this.&lt;ref name="Drabkin1938"/&gt;

[[Archimedes]] corrected Aristotle's theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places; metal boats can float if they [[Archimedes' principle|displace enough water]]; floating depends in Archimedes' scheme on the mass and volume of the object, not as Aristotle thought its elementary composition.&lt;ref name="Rovelli2015"/&gt;

Aristotle's writings on motion remained influential until the [[Early Modern]] period. [[John Philoponus]] (in the [[Middle Ages]]) and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] are said to have shown by experiment that Aristotle's claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=philoponus&lt;!--see#2.2--&gt; |title=John Philoponus |author=Wildberg, Christian |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contrary opinion is given by [[Carlo Rovelli]], who argues that Aristotle's physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity, that of objects in the [[Earth]]'s gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air. In this system, heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones (whether friction is ignored, or not&lt;ref name="Rovelli2015"/&gt;), and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium.&lt;ref name="Susskind 2011"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Susskind |first1=Leonard |authorlink1=Leonard Susskind |title=Classical Mechanics, Lectures 2, 3 |url=http://theoreticalminimum.com/courses/classical-mechanics/2011/fall/lecture-2 |website=The Theoretical Minimum |date=3 October 2011 |accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Philoponus and Galileo correctly objected that for the transient phase (still increasing in speed) with heavy objects falling a short distance, the law does not apply: Galileo used balls on a short incline to show this. Rovelli notes that "Two heavy balls with the same shape and different weight do fall at different speeds from an aeroplane, confirming Aristotle's theory, not Galileo's."&lt;ref name="Rovelli2015"/&gt;|group=n}}

Newton's "forced" motion corresponds to Aristotle's "violent" motion with its external agent, but Aristotle's assumption that the agent's effect stops immediately it stops acting (e.g., the ball leaves the thrower's hand) has awkward consequences: he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it, resulting in the Medieval [[theory of impetus]].&lt;ref name="Rovelli2015"/&gt;

====Four causes====
{{main|Four causes}}
[[File:Aristotle's Four Causes of a Table.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Aristotle argued by analogy with woodwork that a thing takes its form from [[four causes]]: in the case of a table, the wood used ([[material cause]]), its design ([[formal cause]]), the tools and techniques used ([[efficient cause]]), and its decorative or practical purpose ([[final cause]]).{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=88–90}}]]

Aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors.  His term ''aitia'' is traditionally translated as "cause", but it does not always refer to temporal sequence;  it might be better translated as "explanation", but the traditional rendering will be employed here.&lt;ref name=Lloyd1996fourcauses&gt;{{cite book | last=Lloyd | first=G. E. R. | author-link=G. E. R. Lloyd | date=1996 | work=Adversaries and Authorities: Investigations into ancient Greek and Chinese science | title=Causes and correlations | publisher=Cambridge University Press | pages=96–100, 106–107 | isbn=978-0-521-55695-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hankison1998"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hankinson | first=R. J. | date=1998 | title=Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought | publisher=Oxford University Press | page=159 | isbn=978-0198237457 | doi=10.1093/0199246564.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Material cause]] describes the material out of which something is composed. Thus the material cause of a table is wood. It is not about action. It does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino.&lt;ref name=Lloyd1996fourcauses/&gt;
* The [[formal cause]] is its form, i.e., the arrangement of that matter. It tells us what a thing is, that a thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea in the mind of the sculptor that brings the sculpture into being. A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create a drawing.&lt;ref name=Lloyd1996fourcauses/&gt;
* The [[efficient cause]] is "the primary source", or that from which the change under consideration proceeds. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of "cause" as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. In the case of two dominoes, when the first is knocked over it causes the second also to fall over.&lt;ref name=Lloyd1996fourcauses/&gt; In the case of animals, this agency is a combination of [[developmental biology|how it develops from the egg]], and [[physiology|how its body functions]].{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=91–92, 369–373}}
* The [[final cause]] (''telos'') is its purpose, the reason why a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve. This covers modern ideas of motivating causes, such as volition.&lt;ref name=Lloyd1996fourcauses/&gt; In the case of living things, it implies [[adaptation]] to a particular way of life.{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=91–92, 369–373}}

====Optics====
{{further|History of optics}}

Aristotle describes experiments in [[optics]] using a [[camera obscura]] in ''[[Problems (Aristotle)|Problems]]'', book 15. The apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small [[aperture]] that let light in. With it, he saw that whatever shape he made the hole, the sun's image always remained circular. He also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lahanas |first=Michael |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Optics.htm |title=Optics and ancient Greeks |website=Mlahanas.de |accessdate=26 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411051535/http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Optics.htm |archivedate=11 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chance and spontaneity====
{{further|Accident (philosophy)}}

According to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental things]], "from what is spontaneous". There is also more a specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names "luck", that only applies to people's moral choices.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' 2.6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller1973"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Willard M. |title=Aristotle on Necessity, Chance, and Spontaneity |journal=New Scholasticism |volume=47 |issue=2 |year=1973 |pages=204–213 |doi=10.5840/newscholas197347237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomy===
{{further|History of astronomy}}

In [[astronomy]], Aristotle refuted [[Democritus]]'s claim that the [[Milky Way]] was made up of "those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays," pointing out correctly that if "the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Meteorology'' 1.8, trans. E.W. Webster, rev. J. Barnes.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DenglerSW-Stromboli-20040928-1230x800.jpg|thumb|Aristotle noted that the ground level of the [[Aeolian islands]] changed before a [[volcanic eruption]].]]

===Geology===
{{further|History of geology}}

Aristotle was one of the first people to record any [[geology|geological]] observations. He stated that [[Uniformitarianism|geological change]] was too slow to be observed in one person's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moore, Ruth |title=The Earth We Live On |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |year=1956 |page=13 |oclc=1024467091}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''Meteorology''. Book 1, Part 14&lt;/ref&gt;
The geologist [[Charles Lyell]] noted that Aristotle described such change, including "lakes that had dried up" and "deserts that had become watered by rivers", giving as examples the growth of the [[Nile delta]] since the time of [[Homer]], and "the upheaving of one of the [[Aeolian islands]], previous to a [[volcanic eruption]]."'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Charles Lyell |author=Lyell, Charles |url=https://archive.org/details/principlesgeolo01unkngoog |title=Principles of Geology |date=1832 |page=17 |oclc=609586345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology===
{{main|Aristotle's biology}}
[[File:Tremoctopus violaceus5.jpg|thumb|upright|Among many pioneering zoological observations, Aristotle described the reproductive [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]] of the [[octopus]] (bottom left).]]

====Empirical research====

Aristotle was the first person to study biology systematically,{{sfn|Leroi|2015|page=7}} and biology forms a large part of his writings. He spent two years observing and describing the zoology of [[Lesbos]] and the surrounding seas, including in particular the Pyrrha lagoon in the centre of Lesbos.{{sfn|Leroi|2015|page=14}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=D'Arcy |authorlink1=D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson |title=Historia animalium |work=The works of Aristotle translated into English |editor1=Ross, W.D.|editor2=Smith, J. A. |date=1910 |publisher=Clarendon Press |url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/history/index.html |page=Prefatory Note |oclc=39273217}}&lt;/ref&gt; His data in ''[[History of Animals]]'', ''[[Generation of Animals]]'', ''[[Movement of Animals]]'', and ''[[Parts of Animals]]'' are assembled from his own observations, statements given by people with specialised knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen, and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas.{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=196, 248}} His apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is a historical accident: his works on [[botany]] have been lost, but two books on plants by his pupil Theophrastus have survived.&lt;ref name="Day2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Day |first1=J. |title=Botany meets archaeology: people and plants in the past |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |volume=64 |issue=18 |year=2013 |pages=5805–5816 |doi=10.1093/jxb/ert068|pmid=23669575 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle reports on the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and the catches of fishermen. He describes the [[catfish]], [[electric ray]], and [[frogfish]] in detail, as well as [[cephalopod]]s such as the [[octopus]] and [[paper nautilus]]. His description of the [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]] of cephalopods, used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until the 19th century.{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=66–74, 137}} He gives accurate descriptions of the four-chambered fore-stomachs of [[ruminant]]s,{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=118–119}} and of the [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] embryological development of the [[hound shark]].{{sfn|Leroi|2015|page=73}}

He notes that an animal's structure is well matched to function, so, among birds, the [[heron]], which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish, has a long neck and long legs, and a sharp spear-like beak, whereas [[duck]]s that swim have short legs and webbed feet.{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=135–136}} [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], too, noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal, but unlike Aristotle used the data to come to the theory of [[evolution]].{{sfn|Leroi|2015|page=206}} Aristotle's writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution, but while Aristotle was aware that new mutations or [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridisations]] could occur, he saw these as rare accidents. For Aristotle, accidents, like heat waves in winter, must be considered distinct from natural causes. He was thus critical of Empedocles's materialist theory of a "survival of the fittest" origin of living things and their organs, and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results.&lt;ref name=sed&gt;{{cite book |title=Creationism and Its Critics in Antiquity |first=David |last=Sedley |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgRuJEfzUG8C |year=2007 |publisher=University of California Press |page=189 |isbn=978-0520253643}}&lt;/ref&gt; To put his views into modern terms, he nowhere says that different species can have a [[common descent|common ancestor]], or that one kind can [[speciation|change into another]], or that kinds can become [[extinction|extinct]].{{sfn|Leroi|2015|page=273}}

====Scientific style====
[[File:Two of Aristotle's Growth Laws.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Aristotle inferred growth laws from his observations on animals, including that [[brood size]] decreases with body mass, whereas [[gestation]] period increases. He was correct in these predictions, at least for mammals: data are shown for mouse and elephant.]]

Aristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense.{{sfn|Taylor|1922|page=42}} He used the ancient Greek term ''pepeiramenoi'' to mean observations, or at most investigative procedures like dissection.{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=361–365}} In ''Generation of Animals'', he finds a fertilised hen's egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo's heart beating inside.&lt;ref name=LeroiBBC&gt;{{cite web |last1=Leroi |first1=Armand Marie (Presenter) |title=Aristotle's Lagoon: Embryo Inside a Chicken's Egg |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00gqlyy |publisher=BBC |accessdate=17 November 2016 |date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=197–200}}

Instead, he practised a different style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal explanations from these.{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=365–368}}{{sfn|Taylor|1922|page=49}} This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as [[genomics]]. It does not result in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, Aristotle's biology is scientific.{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=365–368}}

From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of [[biological rules|rules]] relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. [[Life expectancy|Lifespan]] increases with [[gestation period]], and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, [[fecundity]] decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.{{sfn|Leroi|2015|page=408}}{{-}}

====Classification of living things====
{{further|Scala naturae}}
[[File:Scyliorhinus retifer embryo.JPG|thumb|Aristotle recorded that the [[embryo]] of [[Mustelus canis|&lt;!--a different species shown--&gt;a dogfish]] was attached by a cord to a kind of placenta (the [[yolk sac]]), like a higher animal; this formed an exception to the linear scale from highest to lowest.{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=72–74}}]]

Aristotle distinguished about 500 species of [[animal]]s,&lt;ref name="BergstromDugatkin2012"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bergstrom, Carl T. |author2=Dugatkin, Lee Alan |title=Evolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SeaEZwEACAAJ |date=2012 |publisher=Norton |isbn=978-0-393-92592-0 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rhodes1974"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rhodes |first=Frank Harold Trevor |title=Evolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWGt0bff8agC |date=1974 |publisher=Golden Press |isbn=978-0-307-64360-5 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; arranging these in the ''History of Animals'' in a graded scale of perfection, a ''[[scala naturae]]'', with man at the top. His system had eleven grades of animal, from highest potential to lowest, expressed in their form at birth: the highest gave [[viviparity|live birth]] to hot and wet creatures, the lowest laid cold, dry mineral-like eggs. Animals came above [[plant]]s, and these in turn were above minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |date=1982 |title=The Growth of Biological Thought |publisher=Belknap Press |isbn=978-0674364462 |pages=201–202}} see also: {{cite book |last=Lovejoy |first=Arthur O. |authorlink=Arthur O. Lovejoy |date=31 January 1976 |title=The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674361539}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grouped what the modern zoologist would call [[vertebrate]]s as the hotter "animals with blood", and below them the colder [[invertebrate]]s as "animals without blood". Those with blood were divided into the live-bearing ([[mammal]]s), and the egg-laying ([[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[fish]]). Those without blood were insects, crustacea (non-shelled – cephalopods, and [[crustacea|shelled]]) and the hard-shelled [[mollusc]]s ([[bivalve]]s and [[gastropod]]s). He recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale, and noted various exceptions, such as that sharks had a [[placenta]] like the tetrapods. To a modern biologist, the explanation, not available to Aristotle,&lt;!--Leroi p. 113--&gt; is [[convergent evolution]].{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=111–119}} He believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes; this [[teleological]] view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mason, Stephen F. |title=A History of the Sciences |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_history_of_the_sciences.html?id=PLlMAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Collier Books |date=1979 |isbn=978-0020934004 |pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===

====Soul====
{{further|On the Soul}}
[[File:Aristotelian Soul.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Aristotle proposed a three-part [[Soul#Aristotle|structure for souls]] of plants, animals, and humans, making humans unique in having all three types of soul.]]

Aristotle's [[psychology]], given in his treatise ''[[On the Soul]]'' (''peri psyche''), posits three kinds of [[soul]] ("psyches"): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. Humans have a rational soul. The human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the ''[[Nous#Aristotle|nous]]'' (intellect) and ''logos'' (reason).{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=156–163}}

For Aristotle, the soul is the [[Hylomorphism#Body–soul hylomorphism|form]] of a living being. Because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP|url-id=aristotle-psychology |title=Psychology |author=Shields, Christopher |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, he placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mason, Stephen F. |title=A History of the Sciences |publisher=Collier Books |date=1979 |isbn=9780020934004 |oclc=924760574 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers, with the exception of [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Guthrie, W. |title=A History of Greek Philosophy Vol. 1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2010 |page=348 |isbn=978-0521294201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Memory====

According to Aristotle in ''On the Soul'', memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal "appearance" and an occurrence in the past.{{sfn|Bloch|2007|p=12}} In other words, a memory is a mental picture ([[wikt:phantasm|phantasm]]) that can be recovered. Aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation, Aristotelian '[[common sense]]', and thinking.{{sfn|Bloch|2007|p=61}}{{sfn|Carruthers|2007|p=16}}

Aristotle uses the term 'memory' for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation, and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents. Memory is of the past, prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. Retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for our previous experience and present experience.{{sfn|Bloch|2007|p=25}}

Because Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions, people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences. To search for these impressions, people search the memory itself.{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=30}} Within the memory, if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. Recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another. If the chain of "images" is needed, one memory will stimulate the next. When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed.{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=25}} Recollection is thus the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression.{{sfn|Carruthers|2007|p=19}} Only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. Animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations. Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed.{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=296}}

[[File:Aristotle Senses Perception Memory Dreams Action.svg|thumb|upright=2.3|Senses, perception, memory, dreams, action in Aristotle's psychology. Impressions are stored in the [[sensorium|seat of perception]], linked by his [[Laws of Association]] (similarity, contrast, and [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]]).]]

Aristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain impressions, was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity, contrast, and [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]], described in his [[Laws of Association]]. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled.{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=259}}

====Dreams====
{{see |Dream#Classical history}}

Aristotle describes sleep in ''On Sleep and Wakefulness''.&lt;ref name=Dreaming&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holowchak |first1=Mark |title=Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out |journal=Ancient Philosophy |date=1996 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=405–23 |url=http://www.pdcnet.org/ancientphil/Ancient-Philosophy |doi=10.5840/ancientphil199616244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses&lt;ref name=Shute1941&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shute |first1=Clarence |title=The Psychology of Aristotle: An Analysis of the Living Being |date=1941 |publisher=Columbia University Press |pages=115–18 |oclc=936606202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or of digestion,&lt;ref name=Dreaming/&gt; so it is vital to the body.&lt;ref name=Shute1941/&gt; While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness. Since a person cannot sense during sleep they can not have desire, which is the result of sensation. However, the senses are able to work during sleep,&lt;ref name=Shute1941/&gt; albeit differently,&lt;ref name=Dreaming/&gt; unless they are weary.&lt;ref name=Shute1941/&gt;

Dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner.&lt;ref name=Shute1941/&gt; Aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water, and then look away, the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention, it leaves an impression.&lt;ref name=Dreaming/&gt; When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored.&lt;ref name=Shute1941/&gt; However, during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences.&lt;ref name=Dreaming/&gt; So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience.&lt;ref name=Modrak&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Modrak |first1=Deborah |title=Dreams and Method in Aristotle |journal=Skepsis: A Journal for Philosophy and Interdisciplinary Research |date=2009 |volume=20 |pages=169–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; During sleep, a person is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. Since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams, like the infatuated person.&lt;ref name=Dreaming/&gt; This leads the person to believe the dream is real, even when the dreams are absurd in nature.&lt;ref name=Dreaming/&gt;

One component of Aristotle's theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs. He claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being. Aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences.&lt;ref name=Webb&gt;{{cite book |last1=Webb |first1=Wilse |title=Dreamtime and dreamwork: Decoding the language of the night |date=1990 |publisher=Jeremy P. Tarcher  |isbn= 978-0-87477-594-5 |pages=174–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it. If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred. Secondly, any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream. For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, this sensory experience is not part of the dream. Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences.&lt;ref name="Modrak"/&gt;

===Ethics===

{{main|Aristotelian ethics}}

Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kraut |first1=Richard |title=Aristotle's Ethics |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/ |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=19 March 2018 |date=1 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (''ergon'') of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the ''[[De Anima|psuchē]]'' (''soul'') in accordance with reason (''[[logos]]''). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity (the virtuous mean, between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt;) of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, ''[[eudaimonia]]'', generally translated as "happiness" or sometimes "well being". To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (''ēthikē'' ''[[arete (moral virtue)|aretē]]''), often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics]] Book I. See for example chapter 7 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1098a 1098a].&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (''[[phronesis]]'') and their intellect (''[[nous]]'') can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics]] Book VI.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===

{{main|Politics (Aristotle)}}

In addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''. Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, "for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part".&lt;ref&gt;Politics 1253a19–24&lt;/ref&gt; He also famously stated that "man is by nature a political animal" and also arguing that humanity's defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |others=Translated by Ernest Barker and revised with introduction and notes by R. F. Stalley |title=Politics |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-953873-7 |pages=320–21 |edition=1st |origyear=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ebenstein |first=Alan |author-link=Alan O. Ebenstein |author2=William Ebenstein |title=Introduction to Political Thinkers |publisher=Wadsworth Group |date=2002 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aristotle's constitutions.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Aristotle's classifications of political constitutions]]

The common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle's understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (''[[polis]]'') which functions as a political "community" or "partnership" (''koinōnia'')&lt;!-- (1252a1) --&gt;. The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability&lt;!-- (1280b29–31) --&gt;, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: "The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together&lt;!-- (1281a1–3) --&gt;." This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with [[social contract]] theory, according to which individuals leave the [[state of nature]] because of "fear of violent death" or its "inconveniences."{{refn|For a different reading of social and economic processes in the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and ''Politics'' see Polanyi, Karl (1957) "Aristotle Discovers the Economy" in ''Primitive, Archaic and Modern Economies: Essays of Karl Polanyi'' ed.

In ''[[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|Protrepticus]]'', the character 'Aristotle' states:&lt;ref name=HutchinsonJohnson&gt;{{cite web |author1=Hutchinson, D. S.|author2=Johnson, Monte Ransome  |url=http://www.protrepticus.info/protr2017x20.pdf |title=Exhortation to Philosophy |website=Protrepticus |date=2015 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For we all agree that the most excellent man should rule, i.e., the supreme by nature, and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law is a kind of intelligence, i.e. a discourse based on intelligence. And again, what standard do we have, what criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it's evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonJohnson/&gt;}}

===Economics===
{{main|Politics (Aristotle)}}

Aristotle made substantial contributions to [[economics|economic thought]], especially to thought in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=robbins2000&gt;{{cite book |author=Robbins, Lionel |editor1=Medema, Steven G. |editor2=Samuels, Warren J. |title=A History of Economic Thought: The LSE Lectures |date=2000 |publisher=Princeton University Press | pages=20–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', Aristotle addresses the city, [[property]], and [[trade]]. His response to criticisms of [[private property]], in [[Lionel Robbins]]'s view, anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists, as it related to the overall [[utility]] of social arrangements.&lt;ref name=robbins2000/&gt; Aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society, and that although private property is often blamed for social strife, such evils in fact come from [[human nature]]. In ''Politics'', Aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of [[money]].&lt;ref name=robbins2000/&gt; Money came into use because people became dependent on one another, importing what they needed and exporting the surplus. For the sake of convenience, people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable, such as iron or [[silver]].&lt;ref name=monroe1948&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |editor=Monroe, Arthur E. |title=Politics-Ethics, In Early Economic Thought: Selections from Economic Literature Prior to Adam Smith |date=1948 |publisher=Harvard University Press | pages=16–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's discussions on [[retail]] and [[interest]] was a major influence on economic thought in the Middle Ages. He had a low opinion of retail, believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household, retail trade seeks to make a [[profit (economics)|profit]]. It thus uses goods as a means to an end, rather than as an end unto itself. He believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural. Similarly, Aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural, as it makes a gain out of the money itself, and not from its use.&lt;ref name=monroe1948/&gt;

Aristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time. He wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth, the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement. Money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them "commensurable".&lt;ref name=monroe1948/&gt; He goes to on state that money is also useful for future exchange, making it a sort of security. That is, "if we do not want a thing now, we shall be able to get it when we do want it".&lt;ref name=monroe1948/&gt;

===Rhetoric and poetics===
[[File:Bénigne Gagneraux, The Blind Oedipus Commending his Children to the Gods.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Blind Oedipus Commending his Children to the Gods'' (1784) by [[Bénigne Gagneraux]]. In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle uses the tragedy ''[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus Tyrannus]]'' by [[Sophocles]] as an example of how the perfect tragedy should be structured, with a generally good protagonist who starts the play prosperous, but loses everything through some ''[[hamartia]]'' (fault).&lt;ref name="Kaufmann"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaufmann |first=Walter Arnold |title=Tragedy and Philosophy|date=1968 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-02005-1 |pages=56–60 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NTk9-180NbsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Aristotle+Oedipus+the+King#v=onepage&amp;q=Aristotle%20Oedipus%20the%20King |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Poetics (Aristotle)}}

Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience: ''[[ethos]]'' (an appeal to the speaker's character), ''[[pathos]]'' (an appeal to the audience's emotion), and ''[[logos]]'' (an appeal to logical reasoning).&lt;ref name="Garver"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garver |first1=Eugene |title=Aristotle's Rhetoric: An Art of Character |date=1994 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-28425-5 |pages=109–110 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=J2ldWwIQhHwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Aristotle+ethos+pathos+logos#v=onepage&amp;q=ethos%20pathos%20logos |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also categorises rhetoric into three genres: [[epideictic]] (ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame), [[Forensic rhetoric|forensic]] (judicial speeches over guilt or innocence), and [[Deliberative rhetoric|deliberative]] (speeches calling on an audience to make a decision on an issue).&lt;ref name="Rorty"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rorty |first1=Amélie Oksenberg |title=Structuring Rhetoric |work=Essays on Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' |date=1996 |editor-last=Rorty |editor-first=Amélie Oksenberg |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-20227-6 |pages=3–7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vd7fEb1wOmYC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=Aristotle+deliberative+forensic+and+epideictic#v=onepage&amp;q=Aristotle%20deliberative%20forensic%20and%20epideictic |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical [[Proof (truth)|proofs]]: ''[[enthymeme]]'' (proof by [[syllogism]]) and ''[[paradeigma]]'' (proof by example).&lt;ref name="Grimaldi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Grimaldi |first=William M.

Aristotle writes in his ''Poetics'' that [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]], painting, sculpture, music, and dance are all fundamentally acts of ''[[mimesis]]'' ("imitation"), each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.&lt;ref name="Halliwell2002"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Halliwell |first1=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Halliwell (academic) |chapter=Inside and Outside the Work of Art|title=The Aesthetics of Mimesis: Ancient Texts and Modern Problems |date=2002 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-09258-4 |pages=152–159 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8wctGFg12MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Aristotle+mimesis#v=onepage&amp;q=Aristotle%20mimesis |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a&lt;/ref&gt; He applies the term ''mimesis'' both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artist's intention&lt;ref name="Halliwell2002"/&gt; and contends that the audience's realisation of the ''mimesis'' is vital to understanding the work itself.&lt;ref name="Halliwell2002"/&gt; Aristotle states that ''mimesis'' is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals&lt;ref name="Halliwell2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV&lt;/ref&gt; and that all human artistry "follows the pattern of nature".&lt;ref name="Halliwell2002"/&gt; Because of this, Aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what [[Stephen Halliwell (academic)|Stephen Halliwell]] calls "highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes."&lt;ref name="Halliwell2002"/&gt; For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is believed that Aristotle's ''Poetics'' originally comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' VI&lt;/ref&gt; The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the [[catharsis]] of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes ''Poetics'' with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' XXVI&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and studied the fables of [[Aesop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Temple, Olivia; Temple, Robert (translators) |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZB-rVxPvtPEC&amp;pg=PR3 |title=The Complete Fables By Aesop |publisher=Penguin Classics |date=1998 |isbn=978-0-14-044649-4 |pages=Introduction, xi–xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on women===

Aristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element.

Aristotle's pupil and successor, [[Theophrastus]], wrote the ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|History of Plants]]'', a pioneering work in botany. Some of his technical terms remain in use, such as [[carpel]] from ''carpos'', fruit, and [[pericarp]], from ''pericarpion'', seed chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hooker |first=Sir William Jackson |authorlink=William Jackson Hooker |title=The British Flora: Comprising the Phaenogamous, Or Flowering Plants, and the Ferns |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-IYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA219 |year=1831 |publisher=Longman |page=219 |oclc=17317293}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Theophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than Aristotle was, instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp. 90–91; Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

===On later Greek philosophers===
{{further|Peripatetic school}}

The immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the [[Peripatetic school]]. Aristotle's notable students included [[Aristoxenus]], [[Dicaearchus]], [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], [[Eudemos of Rhodes]], [[Harpalus]], [[Hephaestion]], [[Mnason of Phocis]], [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], and Theophrastus. Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained "Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/alexander*/3.html''Life of Alexander''], Part 1, 7:7.

===On Hellenistic science===
{{details|Ancient Greek medicine}}

After Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.&lt;ref name="Annas 2001, p. 252"&gt;{{cite book |author=Annas, Julia |title=Classical Greek Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2001 |page=252 |isbn=978-0192853578}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not until the age of [[Alexandria]] under the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemies]] that advances in biology can be again found.

The first medical teacher at Alexandria, [[Herophilos|Herophilus of Chalcedon]], corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between [[vein]]s and [[artery|arteries]], noting that the latter [[pulse]] while the former do not.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Though a few ancient [[atomism|atomists]] such as [[Lucretius]] challenged the [[teleology|teleological]] viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, [[natural theology]]) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries.

{{see also|Commentaries on Aristotle|Byzantine Aristotelianism}}

Greek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus. The first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were Philoponus, Elias, and David in the sixth century, and [[Stephen of Alexandria]] in the early seventh century.{{sfn|Sorabji|1990|pages=20, 28, 35–36}} [[John Philoponus]] stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle's views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of Aristotelian thought.{{sfn|Sorabji|1990|pages=233–274}} Philoponus questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics, noting its flaws and introducing the [[theory of impetus]] to explain his observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lindberg, David |date=1992 |title=The Beginnings of Western Science |publisher=University of Chicago Press |page=162 |isbn=978-0226482057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by Eustratius and [[Michael of Ephesus]] reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by [[Anna Comnena]].{{sfn|Sorabji|1990|pages=20–21; 28–29, 393–406; 407–408}}

===On the medieval Islamic world===

[[File:Arabic aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Islamic portrayal of Aristotle, c. 1220]]

Aristotle was one of the most revered Western thinkers in early [[Islamic theology]]. Most of the still extant works of Aristotle,&lt;ref name="Kennedy-Day1998"/&gt; as well as a number of the original Greek commentaries, were translated into Arabic and studied by Muslim philosophers, scientists and scholars. [[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Alpharabius]], who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers. [[Alkindus]] considered Aristotle the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy&lt;ref&gt;''Rasa'il'' I, 103, 17, Abu Rida&lt;/ref&gt; and Averroes spoke of Aristotle as the "exemplar" for all future philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;''Comm. Magnum'' in Aristotle, ''De Anima'', III, 2, 43 Crawford&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the "First Teacher".&lt;ref name="Kennedy-Day1998"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kennedy-Day |first1=Kiki |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=1998 |url=https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/aristotelianism-in-islamic-philosophy/v-1 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |doi=10.4324/9780415249126-H002-1 |accessdate=29 March 2018|isbn=9780415250696 |chapter=Aristotelianism in Islamic philosophy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The title "teacher" was first given to Aristotle by Muslim scholars, and was later used by Western philosophers (as in the famous poem of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]) who were influenced by the tradition of [[Islamic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nasr |first=Seyyed Hossein |title=The Islamic Intellectual Tradition in Persia |date=1996 |publisher=Curzon Press |isbn=978-0-7007-0314-2 |pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the Greek theorists, the Muslims considered Aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher, the author of a closed system, and believed that Aristotle shared with [[Plato]] essential tenets of thought. Some went so far as to credit Aristotle himself with neo-Platonic metaphysical ideas.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''Aristutalis''&lt;!--full ref or better source needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

With the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early [[medieval]] Latin West, Aristotle was practically unknown there from c. AD 600 to c. 1100 except through the Latin translation of the ''Organon'' made by [[Boethius]]. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, such as those by [[Gerard of Cremona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=arabic-islamic-influence |title=Influence of Arabic and Islamic Philosophy on the Latin West |author=Hasse, Dag Nikolaus |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the original Greek, such as those by [[James of Venice]] and [[William of Moerbeke]]. After the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] Thomas Aquinas wrote his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', working from Moerbeke's translations and calling Aristotle "The Philosopher",&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', Part I, Question 3&lt;/ref&gt; the demand for Aristotle's writings grew, and the [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=aristotelianism-renaissance |title=Aristotelianism in the Renaissance |author=Kuhn, Heinrich |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. Scholars such as Boethius, [[Peter Abelard]], and [[John Buridan]] worked on Aristotelian logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |last=Lagerlund |first=Henrik |title=Medieval Theories of the Syllogism |url-id=medieval-syllogism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval English poet [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] describes his student as being happy by having

Twenty bookes, clad in blak or reed,
Of aristotle and his philosophie,&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer, Geoffrey]], ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', Prologue, lines 295–295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[The tale of Phyllis and Aristotle|cautionary medieval tale]] held that Aristotle advised his pupil Alexander to avoid the king's seductive mistress, Phyllis, but was himself captivated by her, and allowed her to ride him. Phyllis had secretly told Alexander what to expect, and he witnessed Phyllis proving that a woman's charms could overcome even the greatest philosopher's male intellect. Artists such as [[Hans Baldung]] produced a series of illustrations of the popular theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aristotle and Phyllis |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/20121 |publisher=Art Institute Chicago |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Louvre&gt;{{cite web |title=Phyllis and Aristotle {{!}} The Triumph of Seduction over Intellect |url=https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/phyllis-and-aristotle |publisher=Louvre |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On Early Modern scientists===
[[File:William Harvey ( 1578-1657) Venenbild.jpg|thumb|[[William Harvey]]'s ''[[Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus|De Motu Cordis]]'', 1628, showed that the [[circulation of the blood|blood circulated]], contrary to classical era thinking.]]

In the [[Early Modern]] period, scientists such as [[William Harvey]] in England and [[Galileo Galilei]] in Italy reacted against the theories of Aristotle and other classical era thinkers like [[Galen]], establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment. Harvey demonstrated the [[circulation of the blood]], establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the body's heat, as Aristotle thought.&lt;ref name="Aird 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Aird| first=W. C. | title=Discovery of the cardiovascular system: from Galen to William Harvey | journal=Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis | volume=9 | year=2011 | doi=10.1111/j.1538-7836.2011.04312.x | pmid=21781247 | pages=118–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace Aristotle's physics, proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=galileo |title=Galileo Galilei |author=Machamer, Peter |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On 19th-century thinkers===

The 19th-century German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle rigidly separated action from production, and argued for the deserved subservience of some people ("natural slaves"), and the natural superiority (virtue, ''arete'') of others. It was [[Martin Heidegger]], not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Knight2007&gt;{{cite book |author=Knight, Kelvin |title=Aristotelian Philosophy: Ethics &amp; Politics from Aristotle to MacIntyre |publisher=Polity Press |date=2007 |pages=''passim'' !pages! |isbn=978-0745619774}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name=Sikka1997&gt;{{cite book |author=Sikka, Sonya |title=Forms of Transcendence: Heidegger and Medieval Mystical Theology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UNYIDrA0zrYC&amp;pg=PA265 |year=1997 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-7914-3345-4 |page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English mathematician [[George Boole]] fully accepted Aristotle's logic, but decided "to go under, over, and beyond" it with his system of [[Boolean algebra|algebraic logic]] in his 1854 book ''[[The Laws of Thought]]''. This gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations, enables it to solve equations as well as check [[Validity (logic)|validity]], and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms, not just two.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Boole|Boole, George]] (2003) [1854].

===Modern rejection and rehabilitation===
[[File:Alexander and Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|"That most enduring of romantic images, Aristotle tutoring the future conqueror Alexander".&lt;ref name="Grafton2010"/&gt; Illustration by {{ill|Charles Laplante|fr}}, 1866]]

During the 20th century, Aristotle's work was widely criticised. The philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]]
argued that "almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine". Russell called Aristotle's ethics "repulsive", and labelled his logic "as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy". Russell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.&lt;ref name="philosophy1972"/&gt; In 1985, the biologist [[Peter Medawar]] could still state in "pure seventeenth century"{{sfn|Leroi|2015|page=353}} tones that Aristotle had assembled "a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay, imperfect observation, wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility".{{sfn|Leroi|2015|page=353}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Medawar, P. B.; Medawar, J. S. |year=1984 |title=Aristotle to Zoos: a philosophical dictionary of biology |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0192830432 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the start of the 21st century, however, Aristotle was taken more seriously: Kukkonen noted that "In the best 20th-century scholarship Aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the Greek philosophical tradition."&lt;ref name="Grafton2010"/&gt; [[Ayn Rand]] accredited Aristotle as "the greatest philosopher in history" and cited him as a major influence on her thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mayhew |first1=Robert |title=Aristotle For Objectivists|url=https://estore.aynrand.org/p/692/aristotle-for-objectivists-mp3-download |publisher=The Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans.&lt;ref name=Knight2007&gt;{{cite book |author=Knight, Kelvin |title=Aristotelian Philosophy: Ethics &amp; Politics from Aristotle to MacIntyre |publisher=Polity Press |date=2007 |pages=''passim'' |isbn=978-0745619774}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kukkonen observed, too, that "that most enduring of romantic images, Aristotle tutoring the future conqueror Alexander" remained current, as in the 2004 film ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'', while the "firm rules" of Aristotle's theory of drama have ensured a role for the ''Poetics'' in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="Grafton2010"/&gt;

Biologists continue to be interested in Aristotle's thinking. [[Armand Marie Leroi]] has reconstructed Aristotle's biology,{{sfn|Leroi|2015}} while [[Tinbergen's four questions|Niko Tinbergen's four questions]], based on Aristotle's four causes, are used to analyse [[animal behaviour]]; they examine [[function (biology)|function]], [[phylogeny]], [[mechanism (biology)|mechanism]], and [[ontogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=MacDougall-Shackleton |first=Scott A. |date=2011-07-27 |title=The levels of analysis revisited |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=366 |issue=1574 |pages=2076–2085 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0363 |pmc=3130367 |pmid=21690126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h&amp;h&gt;Hladký, V. &amp; Havlíček, J.

[[File:Aristotelis De Moribus ad Nicomachum.jpg|thumb|upright|First page of a 1566 edition of the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' in Greek and Latin]]

The works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum. These texts, as opposed to Aristotle's lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle's school. Reference to them is made according to the organisation of [[Immanuel Bekker]]'s Royal Prussian Academy edition (''Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica'', Berlin, 1831–1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Bekker|Bekker, Immanuel]] (editor).

Aristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls, the common writing medium of that era.{{refn|"When the Roman dictator Sulla invaded Athens in 86 BC, he brought back to Rome a fantastic prize – Aristotle's library. Books then were papyrus rolls, from 10 to 20 feet long, and since Aristotle's death in 322 BC, worms and damp had done their worst. The rolls needed repairing, and the texts clarifying and copying on to new papyrus (imported from Egypt – Moses' bulrushes).

A '''Bradel''' binding (also called a bonnet or bristol board binding, a ''German Case'' binding, or in French as ''Cartonnage à la Bradel'' or ''en gist'') is a style of [[book binding]] with a hollow back. It most resembles a case binding in that it has a hollow back and visible joint, but unlike a case binding, it is built up on the book. Characteristic of the binding is the material covering the outside boards is separate from the material covering the spine. Many bookbinders consider the Bradel binding to be stronger than a case binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Laura|title=Bookbinding and Conservation by Hand: A Working Guide|year=1995|publisher=Oak Knoll Press|location=New Castle, DE|isbn=1-884718-11-6|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The binding may be traced to 18th century [[Germany]]. The originator of the binding is uncertain, but the name comes from a French binder working in Germany, Alexis-Pierre Bradel (also known as ''Bradel l'ainé'' or ''Bradel-Derome'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Matt|title=Bookbinding and the Conservation of Books|date=1982|publisher=Library of Congress|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0844403660|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The binding originally appeared as a temporary binding, but the results were durable, and the binding had great success in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambras|first=Josep|title=The Complete Book of Bookbinding|year=2004|publisher=Lark Books|location=Asheville, NC|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is most likely to be encountered in [[photo album]]s and [[scrapbooking|scrapbooks]].

The binding has the advantage of allowing the book to open fully, where traditional [[leather]] bindings are too rigid. It is sometimes modified to provide a rounded spine. This lends the appearance of a book where the paper is not suited to spine rounding; this is also to provide a rounded spine to a book too thin for a spine rounding to hold.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The binding may also provide an impressive-looking leather spine to a book without incurring the full expense of binding a book in full or partial leather.

The '''''Canadian Journal of African Studies/Revue canadienne des études africaines''''' is a triannual [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] covering [[African studies]] that was established in 1967. It is published by the [[Canadian Association of African Studies]]. Articles are published in English or French and cover the areas of anthropology, political economy, history, geography, and development. In addition to "Research Articles", the journal includes a section called "Debate and Commentary" that presents divergent viewpoints on current issues. Another section called “Research Note" permits contributors to discuss the latest writing, opinion, and research sources on African issues. A [[book review]] and review essay section provides critiques of recent books and reports.

In 2009, the journal added an online format at the [[University of Alberta]]. In 2012, publication moved to [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]. Back issues are available online at [[JSTOR]].

'''Carolyn Louise Baylies''' (2 June 1947 – 11 November 2003),&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cliffe|first1=Lionel|title=Obituary: Carolyn Baylies|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/nov/11/guardianobituaries.highereducation|work=The Guardian|date=11 November 2003|quote=Carolyn Baylies, sociologist, born June 2, 1947; died November 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an academic and activist. She was particularly active in the fields of [[health]] and [[sociology]] of the [[third world]] and [[international development]], and especially on the [[gender]]ed aspects of development. Baylies was particularly notable for her work on the ways in which the [[AIDS epidemic]] threatened existing [[social structures]] and [[food security]], a connection which she was one of the first to make.

== Early life ==
Baylies was born in Texas&lt;ref name="campus.leeds.ac.uk"&gt;University of Leeds Obituary: Carolyn Baylies http://campus.leeds.ac.uk/newsincludes/newsitem1543.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in California.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;

==Education and career==
After completing her undergraduate degree in [[sociology]] at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] in 1969,&lt;ref name="campus.leeds.ac.uk"/&gt; she completed a [[doctorate]] on [[Zambia]]n [[social class|class]] relations at the [[University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Madison]], which was awarded in 1978. Following this she took a teaching post at the [[University of Zambia]],&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt; during which time she also undertook research on the [[trade union]] movement and labour policies.

In 1980 Baylies joined the School of Economic Studies at the [[University of Leeds]] as a [[research fellow]] studying the history of the [[Yorkshire Miners Association]], a subject on which she published a book in 1993 entitled 'History of the Yorkshire Miners, 1881-1918'.
Her academic pursuits were valued by the University of Leeds, in 1983 she became a lecturer, in 1993, a senior lecturer, and in 2003, Reader in the sociology of developing countries. Her work at the university also included her involvement in the founding of the [[Leeds Centre for Development Studies|Centre for Development Studies]] of which she served as a director for two terms (1990–93, 1997–99).&lt;ref name="campus.leeds.ac.uk"/&gt; Baylies also helped to shape the University of Leeds' interdisciplinary [[Master of Arts]] course in [[Development Studies]], expanding the capacity for [[postgraduate research]] in the field.

Baylies was also involved in the [[Review of African Political Economy]], which she helped to found. She served as a member of ROAPE's editorial working group for over 20 years.&lt;ref name="campus.leeds.ac.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Contributors to the Review of African Political Economy Author - Carolyn Baylies http://www.roape.org/authors/bayl_c.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Baylies was married to fellow University of Leeds academic, [[Morris Szeftel|Dr. Morris Szeftel]] with whom she coauthored the book 'The Dynamics of the One-Party State in Zambia', published in 1984. Baylies and Szeftel had two children.

Baylies died from cancer on 1 November 2003.&lt;ref name=guardian.co.uk /&gt;

'''Cladh Hallan''' ({{lang-gd|Cladh Hàlainn}}, {{IPA-gd|kʰl̪ˠɤɣ ˈhaːl̪ˠɪɲ}}) is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] site on the island of [[South Uist]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]]  in [[Scotland]]. It is significant as the only place in [[Great Britain]] where [[prehistoric]] [[mummy|mummies]] have been found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/archaeology/excavations_techniques/mummies_cladhhallan_01.shtml "Mummification in Bronze Age Britain"] [[BBC History]]. Retrieved 11 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Excavations were carried out there between 1988 and 2002, indicating the site was occupied from 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shef.ac.uk/archaeology/research/cladh-hallan "The Prehistoric Village at Cladh Hallan"]. [[University of Sheffield]]. Retrieved 21 Feb 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cladh-Hallan Man.svg|thumb|upright|left|Composition of the male mummy:&lt;br/&gt;blue: male c. 1600 BC&lt;br/&gt;yellow: male c. 1500-1400 BC&lt;br/&gt;red: male c. 1440-1360 BC]]
In 2001, a team of [[archaeologist]]s found four [[skeleton]]s at the site, one of them a male who had died c. 1600 BC, and another a female who had died c. 1300 BC. (about the same time as King [[Tutankhamun]] of [[Egypt]]). At first the researchers did not realise they were dealing with mummies, since the [[soft tissue]] had decomposed and the skeletons had been [[burial|buried]]. But tests revealed that both bodies had not been buried until about 1120 BC, and that the bodies had been preserved shortly after death in a peat [[bog]] for 6 to 18 months. The preserved bodies were then apparently retrieved from the bog and set up inside a dwelling, presumably having religious significance. Archaeologists do not know why the bodies were buried centuries later. The Cladh Hallan skeletons differ from most [[bog body|bog bodies]] in two respects: unlike most bog bodies, they appear to have been put in the bog for the express purpose of preservation (whereas most bog bodies were simply interred in the bog), and unlike most bog bodies, their soft tissue was no longer preserved at the time of discovery.

== Analysis ==
{{update section|date=January 2017}}
The skeletons and other finds are being analysed in laboratories in Scotland, [[England]] and [[Wales]]. Following the provisions of the Treasure Trove Act, all the finds from Cladh Hallan, including the skeletons, will be allocated to a [[Scottish museum]] after the lengthy process of analysis and reporting is completed. According to recent anthropological and [[DNA]]-analysis the skeletons of a female and a male were compiled from body parts of at least 6 different human individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kaufman | first = Rachel  | authorlink = | title = "Frankenstein" Bog Mummies Discovered in Scotland; Two ancient bodies made from six people, new study reveals | work = National Geographic | publisher = | date = 2012-07-06 | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/07/120706-bog-mummies-body-parts-frankenstein-ancient-science/ | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2012-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''constitutional dictatorship''' is a form of government in which dictatorial powers are exercised during an emergency. The dictator is not absolute and the dictator's authority remains limited by the constitution.

The [[Roman Republic]] made provision for a [[Roman dictator|dictator]] who could govern unchecked for a stipulated period of time. Unlike other magistrates, a dictator was not subject to review of his actions at the conclusion of his term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Dictator.html A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, John Murray, London, 1875.], Dictator&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Constitution]] has a similar dictator clause stating that the President "may adjourn [congress] to such Time as he shall think proper" if the two houses disagree on when to adjourn.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html Constitution of the United States], Article II, Section 3&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Abraham Lincoln]], President of the United States during the American Civil War, exercised extraordinary powers to preserve the Union. Lincoln's dictatorial actions included directly ordering the arrest and detention of dissenters and the suspension of the right to writs of habeas corpus. However, Lincoln remained subject to Congressional oversight, judicial review, and periodic elections.

The [[Weimer Republic]], which succeeded [[Imperial Germany]] after the [[First World War]], adopted a constitutional provision that expressly enabled the president to rule by decree, without consultation with the legislative branch. That provision was used by Chancellor [[Hitler]] to consolidate his powers upon his selection by President [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]].

US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] also exercised extraordinary powers in response to the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Second World War]]. Roosevelt's actions included violating the US Constitution's [[Contract Clause]], the closing of banks, and a moratorium on [[foreclosure]]s. Later, meeting a perceived threat by Japanese nationals and Japanese-Americans, Roosevelt ordered their [[internment of Japanese Americans|relocation to internment camps]].

In the 21st century, [[John Yoo]], attorney and legal theorist, has offered a theory of the unitary executive for massive authority of the US President, in his capacity as [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces. Yoo provided the intellectual foundation for many of the actions undertaken by the [[George W. Bush administration]] in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|attacks of September 11, 2001]].

{{Linguistics}}
In [[linguistics]], '''construction grammar''' groups a number of models of [[grammar]] that all subscribe to the idea that knowledge of a language is based on a collection of "form and function pairings". The "function" side covers what is commonly understood as ''meaning'', ''content'', or ''intent''; it usually extends over both conventional fields of [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]].

Language users learn these pairings as individual, whole facts about language. These language facts are indexed to specific interactive contexts and/or linguistic practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Kerstin|date=December 2015|title=Conversation, Construction Grammar, and cognition|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/language-and-cognition/article/conversation-construction-grammar-and-cognition/F60C5CDB2335B915DD69D2C6E7A1C903|journal=Language and Cognition|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=563–588|doi=10.1017/langcog.2015.23|issn=1866-9808}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be associated in the mind of the language user with a highly particularized [[sociolect]], [[dialect]], pattern of [[jargon]], [[genre]],&lt;ref&gt;Michaelis, Laura A. and Hanbing Feng. 2015. What is this, Sarcastic Syntax? Constructions and Frames 7: 148–180&lt;/ref&gt; or register.

The guiding insight of '''construction grammar''' (often abbreviated '''CxG''') is that rules of syntactic combination are directly associated with interpretive and use conditions. All construction-based grammars allow units bigger than the word as semantic building blocks of syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/pdf/BoasSag-intro.pdf|title=Introducing Sign Based Construction Grammar|last=Boas, Hans|first=Ivan Sag and Paul Kay|date=2012|website=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the bipartite clausal pattern sometimes referred to as the Correlative Conditional construction, as found in the proverbial expression ''The bigger they come, the harder they fall'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sag|first=Ivan|date=2010|title=English Filler-Gap Constructions|url=|journal=Language|volume=86|pages=486-545|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fillmore|first=Charles|date=1986|title=Varieties of Conditional Sentences|url=|journal=Eastern States Conference on Linguistics|volume=3|pages=163-182|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michaelis|first=Laura A.|date=1994-01-01|title=A Case of Constructional Polysemy in Latin|url=http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/sl.18.1.04mic|journal=Studies in Language|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=45–70|doi=10.1075/sl.18.1.04mic|issn=0378-4177}}&lt;/ref&gt;; another is the Copula Doubling construction exemplified by ''The thing is, is you never really know'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/38263988/BrenierMichaelis.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1521475150&amp;Signature=TWAXUdE0zZ2GItL76IwBVILCcA8%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DOptimization_via_Syntactic_Amalgam_Synta.pdf|title=Optimization via syntactic amalgam: Syntax-prosody mismatch and copula doubling|last=Brenier, Jason|first=Laura Michaelis|date=2005|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In contrast to traditional compositional approaches to syntax, in which all conceptual content comes from the lexicon, and rules of syntactic combination do no more than determine which word sequences function as units for syntactic purposes, constructional approaches assume a continuum of idiomaticity (or generality) of expressions, from tightly bound idioms to fully productive patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Kay, Paul and Laura A. Michaelis. 2012. Constructional Meaning and Compositionality. In C. Maienborn, K. von Heusinger and P. Portner (eds.), Semantics: An International Handbook of Natural Language Meaning. Vol. 3. Berlin: de Gruyter. 2271-2296&lt;/ref&gt; This fundamental commitment unites all of the varieties of CxG, whether or not formal descriptive methods are used and whether the research program targets language development, second-language learning, typology, diachrony, language productions and comprehension, language evolution, conversational practice or social identity. Owing to its focus on descriptive precision, patterns of usage, grammaticalization and the structure of linguistic categories, CxG is closely linked to the explanatory frameworks of [[cognitive-functional linguistics]].

== History ==
Historically, the notion of construction grammar developed out of the ideas of "global rules" and "transderivational rules"{{example needed}} in [[generative semantics]], together with the generative semantic idea of a grammar as a constraint satisfaction system.
[[George Lakoff]]'s "Syntactic Amalgams" paper in 1974 (Chicago Linguistics Society, 1974) posed a challenge for the idea of transformational derivation.

Construction grammar was spurred on by the development of Cognitive Semantics, beginning in 1975 and extending through the 1980s. Lakoff's 1977 paper, Linguistic Gestalts (Chicago Linguistic Society, 1977) was an early version of CxG, arguing that the meaning of the whole was not a compositional function of the meaning of the parts put together locally. Instead, he suggested, constructions themselves must have meanings.

Construction grammar was developed in the 1980s by linguists such as [[Charles J. Fillmore|Charles Fillmore]], [[Paul Kay]], and George Lakoff. Construction grammar was developed in order to handle cases that intrinsically went beyond the capacity of [[generative grammar]].

The earliest study was "There-Constructions," which appeared as Case Study 3 in George Lakoff's ''[[Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lakoff, George| title=Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal about the Mind| location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press| year=1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It argued that the meaning of the whole was not a function of the meanings of the parts, that odd grammatical properties of [[Deictic]] There-constructions followed from the pragmatic meaning of the construction, and that variations on the central construction could be seen as simple extensions using form-meaning pairs of the central construction.

Fillmore et al.'s (1988) paper on the English ''let alone'' construction was a second classic. These two papers propelled cognitive linguists into the study of CxG.

== Grammatical construction ==
In construction grammar, like in general [[semiotics]], the [[grammatical construction]] is a pairing of form and content. The formal aspect of a construction is typically described as a [[syntax|syntactic]] template, but the form covers more than just syntax, as it also involves [[phonology|phonological]] aspects, such as [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]. The content covers [[semantics|semantic]] as well as [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] meaning.

The semantic meaning of a grammatical construction is made up of conceptual structures postulated in [[cognitive semantics]]: [[Image schema|image-schema]]s, frames, conceptual metaphors, conceptual metonymies, prototypes of various kinds, mental spaces, and bindings across these (called "blends"). Pragmatics just becomes the cognitive semantics of communication—the modern version of the old [[John R. Ross|Ross]]-Lakoff performative hypothesis from the 1960s.

The form and content are [[symbolic relation|symbolically linked]] in the sense advocated by [[Ronald Langacker|Langacker]].

Thus a construction is treated like a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] in which all structural aspects are integrated parts and not distributed over different modules as they are in the [[componential model]]. Consequentially, not only constructions that are lexically fixed, like many idioms, but also more abstract ones like [[argument structure]] schemata, are pairings of form and conventionalized meaning. For instance, the [[ditransitive]] schema [S V IO DO] is said to express semantic content X CAUSES Y TO RECEIVE Z, just like ''kill'' means X CAUSES Y TO DIE.

In construction grammar, a grammatical construction, regardless of its formal or semantic complexity and make up, is a pairing of form and meaning. Thus words and word classes may be regarded as instances of constructions. Indeed, construction grammarians argue that all pairings of form and meaning are constructions, including phrase structures, [[idiom]]s, [[word]]s and even [[morpheme]]s.

== Syntax-lexicon continuum ==
Unlike the componential model, construction grammar denies any strict distinction between the two and proposes a ''syntax-lexicon continuum''. The argument goes that words and complex constructions are both pairs of form and meaning and differ only in internal symbolic complexity. Instead of being discrete modules and thus subject to very different processes they form the extremes of a continuum (from regular to idiosyncratic): syntax &gt; [[Subcategorization|subcategorization frame]] &gt; idiom &gt; [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] &gt;  [[syntactic category]] &gt; word/[[lexicon]] (these are the traditional terms; construction grammars use a different terminology).

== Grammar as an inventory of constructions ==
In construction grammar, the grammar of a language is made up of [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] networks of families of constructions, which are based on the same principles as those of the conceptual categories known from [[cognitive linguistics]], such as inheritance, prototypicality, extensions, and multiple parenting.

Four different models are proposed in relation to how information is stored in the taxonomies:

#'''Full-entry model'''
#:In the full-entry model information is stored redundantly at all relevant levels in the taxonomy, which means that it operates, if at all, with minimal generalization.{{example needed}}
#:
#'''Usage-based model'''
#:The [[usage-based model]] is based on [[Inductive reasoning|inductive learning]], meaning that linguistic knowledge is acquired in a bottom-up manner through use. It allows for redundancy and generalizations, because the language user generalizes over recurring experiences of use.{{example needed}}
#:
#'''Default inheritance model'''
#:According to the default inheritance model, each network has a default central form-meaning pairing from which all instances inherit their features. It thus operates with a fairly high level of generalization, but does also allow for some redundancy in that it recognizes extensions of different types.{{example needed}}
#:
#'''Complete inheritance model'''
#:In the complete inheritance model, information is stored only once at the most superordinate level of the network. Instances at all other levels inherit features from the superordinate item. The complete inheritance does not allow for redundancy in the networks.{{example needed}}

===Shift towards usage-based model===
All four models are advocated by different construction grammarians, but since the late 1990s there has been a shift towards a general preference for the usage-based model.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The shift towards the usage-based approach in construction grammar has inspired the development of several [[corpus linguistics|corpus]]-based methodologies of constructional analysis (for example, [[collostructional analysis]]).

== Synonymy and monotony ==
As construction grammar is based on schemas and taxonomies, it does not operate with dynamic rules of derivation. Rather, it is [[monotonic models of grammar|monotonic]].

Because construction grammar does not operate with surface derivations from underlying structures, it adheres to functionalist linguist [[Dwight Bolinger]]'s ''principle of no synonymy'', on which [[Adele Goldberg (linguist)|Adele Goldberg]] elaborates in her book.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | author=Goldberg, Adele| title=Constructions: A construction grammar approach to argument structure| location=Chicago/London | publisher=University of Chicago Press| year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that construction grammarians argue, for instance, that active and passive versions of the same proposition are not derived from an underlying structure, but are instances of two different constructions. As constructions are pairings of form and meaning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195396683.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195396683-e-1|title=Construction Grammar|last=Hoffmann|first=Thomas|last2=Trousdale|first2=Graeme|date=2013-04-18|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195396683.013.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;, active and passive versions of the same proposition are not synonymous, but display differences in content: in this case the pragmatic content.

== Some construction grammars ==
As mentioned above, Construction grammar is a "family" of theories rather than one unified theory. There are a number of formalized Construction grammar frameworks. Some of these are:

===Berkeley Construction Grammar===
Berkeley Construction Grammar (BCG: formerly also simply called Construction Grammar in upper case) focuses on the formal aspects of constructions and makes use of a unification-based framework for description of syntax, not unlike [[head-driven phrase structure grammar]]. Its proponents/developers include Charles Fillmore, Paul Kay, [[Laura Michaelis]], and to a certain extent [[Ivan Sag]]. Immanent within BCG works like Fillmore and Kay 1995&lt;ref&gt; Fillmore, Charles J. and Paul Kay. 1995. A Construction Grammar Coursebook. Unpublished ms, University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt; and Michaelis and Ruppenhofer 2001&lt;ref&gt; Michaelis, L. A., &amp; Ruppenhofer, J. 2001. Beyond alternations: A constructional account of the applicative pattern in German. Stanford: CSLI Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; is the notion that phrasal representations—embedding relations—should not be used to represent combinatoric properties of lexemes or lexeme classes. For example, BCG abandons the traditional practice of using non-branching domination (NP over N' over N) to describe undetermined nominals that function as NPs, instead introducing a determination construction that requires ('asks for') a non-maximal nominal sister and a lexical 'maximality' feature for which plural and mass nouns are unmarked. BCG also offers a unification-based representation of 'argument structure' patterns as abstract verbal lexeme entries ('linking constructions'). These linking constructions include transitive, oblique goal and passive constructions. These constructions describe classes of verbs that combine with phrasal constructions like the VP construction but contain no phrasal information in themselves.

===Sign Based Construction Grammar===

In the mid-2000s, several of the developers of BCG, including Charles Fillmore, Paul Kay, Ivan Sag and Laura Michaelis, collaborated in an effort to improve the formal rigor of BCG and clarify its representational conventions. The result was Sign Based Construction Grammar (SBCG). SBCG&lt;ref&gt;Boas, H.C. and Sag, I.A. eds., 2012. Sign-based construction grammar (pp. xvi+-391). CSLI Publications/Center for the Study of Language and Information.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michaelis, L.A., 2009. Sign-based construction grammar. The Oxford handbook of linguistic analysis, pp.155-176.&lt;/ref&gt; is based on a multiple-inheritance hierarchy of typed feature structures. The most important type of feature structure in SBCG is the sign, with subtypes word, lexeme and phrase. The inclusion of phrase within the canon of signs marks a major departure from traditional syntactic thinking. In SBCG, phrasal signs are licensed by correspondence to the mother of some licit construct of the grammar. A construct is a local tree with signs at its nodes. Combinatorial constructions define classes of constructs. Lexical class constructions describe combinatoric and other properties common to a group of lexemes. Combinatorial constructions include both inflectional and derivational constructions. SBCG is both formal and generative; while cognitive-functional grammarians have often opposed their standards and practices to those of formal, generative grammarians, there is in fact no incompatibility between a formal, generative approach and a rich, broad-coverage, functionally based grammar. It simply happens that many formal, generative theories are descriptively inadequate grammars. SBCG is generative in a way that prevailing syntax-centered theories are not: its mechanisms are intended to represent all of the patterns of a given language, including idiomatic ones; there is no 'core' grammar in SBCG. SBCG a licensing-based theory, as opposed to one that freely generates syntactic combinations and uses general principles to bar illicit ones: a word, lexeme or phrase is well formed if and only if it is described by a lexeme or construction. Recent SBCG works have expanded on the lexicalist model of idiomatically combining expressions sketched out in Sag 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Sag, Ivan A. (2012) Sign-Based Construction Grammar: An informal synopsis, in H. C. Boas and I. A. Sag, (eds), Sign-Based Construction Grammar. Stanford: CSLI Publications). 69-202&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goldbergian/Lakovian construction grammar===
The type of construction grammar associated with linguists like Goldberg and Lakoff looks mainly at the external relations of [[grammatical construction|constructions]] and the structure of constructional networks. In terms of form and function, this type of construction grammar puts psychological plausibility as its highest desideratum. It emphasizes experimental results and parallels with general cognitive psychology. It also draws on certain principles of cognitive linguistics. In the Goldbergian strand, constructions interact with each other in a network via four inheritance relations: [[polysemy]] link, subpart link, metaphorical extension, and finally instance link.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Cognitive grammar===
Sometimes, Ronald Langacker's [[cognitive grammar]] framework is described as a type of construction grammar. Cognitive grammar deals mainly with the semantic content of constructions, and its central argument is that conceptual semantics is primary to the degree that form mirrors, or is motivated by, content. Langacker argues that even abstract grammatical units like [[part-of-speech]] classes are semantically motivated and involve certain conceptualizations.

===Radical construction grammar===
[[William A. Croft]]'s [[radical construction grammar]] is designed for [[linguistic typology|typological]] purposes and takes into account cross-linguistic factors. It deals mainly with the internal structure of constructions. Radical construction grammar is totally non-[[reductionism|reductionist]], and Croft argues that constructions are not derived from their parts, but that the parts are derived from the constructions they appear in. Thus, in radical construction grammar, constructions are likened to [[wikt:gestalt|Gestalt]]s. Radical construction grammar rejects the idea that syntactic categories, roles, and relations are universal and argues that they are not only language-specific, but also construction specific. Thus, there are no universals that make reference to formal categories, since formal categories are language- and construction-specific. The only universals are to be found in the patterns concerning the mapping of meaning onto form. Radical construction grammar rejects the notion of syntactic relations altogether and replaces them with semantic relations. Like Goldbergian/Lakovian construction grammar and cognitive grammar, radical construction grammar is closely related to cognitive linguistics, and like cognitive grammar, radical construction grammar appears to be based on the idea that form is semantically motivated.

===Embodied construction grammar===
Embodied construction grammar (ECG), which is being developed by the [http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/NTL/ Neural Theory of Language (NTL)] group at ICSI, UC Berkeley, and the University of Hawai{{okina}}i, particularly including Benjamin Bergen and Nancy Chang, adopts the basic constructionist definition of a grammatical construction, but emphasizes the relation of constructional semantic content to [[Embodied cognition|embodiment]] and [[sensorimotor rhythm|sensorimotor]] experiences. A central claim is that the content of all linguistic signs involves [[mental simulation]]s and is ultimately dependent on basic [[image schema]]s of the kind advocated by [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]] and George Lakoff, and so ECG aligns itself with cognitive linguistics. Like construction grammar, embodied construction grammar makes use of a [[unification-based]] model of representation. A non-technical introduction to the NTL theory behind embodied construction grammar as well as the theory itself and a variety of applications can be found in Jerome Feldman's ''From Molecule to Metaphor: A Neural Theory of Language'' (MIT Press, 2006).

===Fluid construction grammar===
[[Fluid construction grammar]] (FCG) was designed by [[Luc Steels]] and his collaborators for doing experiments on [http://www.fcg-net.org the origins and evolution of language].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Steels, Luc| title=Design Patterns in Fluid Construction Grammar| location=Amsterdam | publisher=John Benjamins| year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Steels, Luc| title=Computational Issues in Fluid Construction Grammar| location=Heidelberg | publisher=Springer| year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FCG is a fully operational and computationally implemented formalism for construction grammars and proposes a uniform mechanism for parsing and production. Moreover, it has been demonstrated through robotic experiments that FCG grammars can be grounded in embodiment and sensorimotor experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Steels, Luc |editor2=Hild, Manfred | title=Language Grounding in Robots| location=New York | publisher=Springer| year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FCG integrates many notions from contemporary [[computational linguistics]] such as [[feature structure]]s and unification-based language processing. Constructions are considered bidirectional and hence usable both for parsing and production. Processing is flexible in the sense that it can even cope with partially ungrammatical or incomplete sentences. FCG is called 'fluid' because it acknowledges the premise that language users constantly change and update their grammars. The research on FCG is conducted at [http://csl.sony.fr Sony CSL Paris] and the AI Lab at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]].

===Others===
In addition there are several construction grammarians who operate within the general framework of construction grammar without affiliating themselves with any specific construction grammar program. There is a growing interest in the [[Synchrony and diachrony|diachronic]] aspect of grammatical constructions and thus in the importation of methods and ideas from [[grammaticalization]] studies. Another area of growing interest is the [[pragmatics]] of [[pragmatic constructions]]. This is probably one of the reasons why the usage-based model is gaining popularity among construction grammarians. Another area of increasing interest among construction grammarians is that of [[language acquisition]] which is mainly due to [[Michael Tomasello]]'s work. [[Mats Andrén]] coined the term [[multimodal constructions]] to account for constructions that incorporate both (conventionalized) gesture and speech.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12456">'''Contemplative psychology''' "is a psychology that forms an intrinsic part of the contemplative traditions of most world religions. The term 'contemplative psychology' therefore does not refer to academic psychological theory about contemplation, religion or religious behavior. It refers to the psychological insights and methods that are - often implicitly - present in the vision and practice of religions and that clarify and guide ones contemplative or religious development" (p.&amp;nbsp;82).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Han de Wit, {{Cite web|url = http://shambhalanetwork.org/sandbox3/index.php?file=2012/08/On_contemplative_psychology.pdf|title = On Contemplative Psychology|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Contemplative psychology addresses the question of how we could intelligently approach and understand human life-experience" (p.&amp;nbsp;83).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==
The term Contemplative Psychology was coined by [[Han F. De Wit]] in 1991 when he, a theoretical psychologist at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, published his pioneering book ''Contemplative Psychology.''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2510|title = Han F. d e W it , Contemplative Psychology. Translated from the Dutch by Marie Louise Baird. Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1991. xviii+ 248 pp.|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this project was to "establish a dialogue between contemplative psychology and academic psychology" (p.&amp;nbsp;233).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contemplative Psychology|last = De Wit|first = H.F.|publisher = Duquesne University Press|year = 1991|isbn = |location = Pittsburgh|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a first step Han did not offer a systematic contemplative psychology but rather he suggested a "framework in which a full-fledged contemplative psychology may be developed" (p.&amp;nbsp;3). Is this work he outlines the "contours and the view of contemplative psychology" (p.&amp;nbsp;4). As Han develops the concept, his first point is to illustrate "a position from which the 'excavation' and 'exposure' of the contemplative psychologies seems possible" (p.&amp;nbsp;115) and to "make explicit and clarify the nature and position of the psychological ''know-how'' that contemplative traditions contain" (p.&amp;nbsp;14)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This implied a comparative study of different religious and contemplative traditions in the belief that there was enough in common between these traditions to make "the search for a general contemplative psychological perspective and approach" meaningful (p.&amp;nbsp;4).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Contemplative psychology became visible in the Western sphere of psychology when researchers began studying the methods used to help individuals understand their own mind, emotions, and motivations. The goal of these practices is to improve the quality of one's own life (and, by extension, the quality of other people's lives). Research began at [[Naropa University]], and was developed extensively by Han himself.

Thus far, mindfulness has been the contemplative practice of most research.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Exploring how contemplative practices can inform counselling psychology and counsellor training. (2013). Counselling and Spirituality, 115-142.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mindfulness is a practice that allows one to exist in the present moment without being  judgmental of it.&lt;ref name="Kabat-Zinn, J. 2005"&gt;Kabat-Zinn, J. (2005). Full catastrophe living: Using the wisdom of the body and mind to face stress, pain, and illness (3rd ed.). New York, NY: Bantam Dell.&lt;/ref&gt; This meditative absorption, often referred to as [[samadhi]] in many eastern traditions, is the equivalent of [[contemplation]] in Western traditions. Gerald G. May expands on this notion in his book ''Will and Spirit'' by differentiating between willfulness and willingness. ''Willfulness'', he explains, is one's attempted mastery over the psyche, while ''willingness'' is a surrender of one's self to a way of being. Contemplative practices allow persons to cultivate meaningful experiences intrinsic to religious and spiritual traditions that are virtually absent in modern, mechanistic psychology alone.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kabat-Zinn, J. 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="May, G. 1983"&gt;May, G. (1983). Will and spirit: A contemplative psychology. San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Understanding contemplative traditions ===
For Han, the project of defining a contemplative psychology begins with the excavation and explication of the "psychology embedded in various contemplative traditions (although often in an implicit and not fully developed state); to compare these different psychologies and derive more general rules from them; and to refine and systematize these findings further through a confrontation with contemporary academic psychology" (p.&amp;nbsp;84).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus Han did not create the concept of contemplative psychology from scratch. It emerged as a common ''techne'' in various religious and secular traditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Han develops three concepts of contemplative tradition: monastic tradition, lay tradition and temporal (non-religious) tradition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Monastic tradition is "a context in which people devote their whole life to the practice of a religious discipline and to the spiritual exercises that are part of it" (p.&amp;nbsp;84).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; People of the monastic traditions typically live with a group of individuals that is fairly separate from the surrounding society. "Their daily life activities are permeated by a discipline that is supposed to develop and sustain religious or spiritual growth" (p.&amp;nbsp;84).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These individuals are typically trained to possess a practical knowledge of their particular tradition and there role is to educate people in the religious view of the world. "This know how is psychological and methodological in nature" (p.&amp;nbsp;84).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is a form of contemplative psychology.

Lay traditions are "religious disciplines that are practiced in the context of normal every day life" (p.&amp;nbsp;84).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are two particular views on lay tradition practice. One is that religious practice in everyday life brings one closer to a monastic tradition and the other is that daily life is the ultimate [[monastery]] and that daily practice is the monastic practice brought into everyday lived experiences. In either view there is psychological knowledge that could be considered contemplative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Temporal (non-religious) traditions are "contemplative traditions could be 'non religious', that is without a connection with a particular religion" (p.&amp;nbsp;84).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite an informal nature these traditions contain "a discipline based on a particular kind of psychological knowledge, that guides its practitioners towards the realization of the highest human values" (p.&amp;nbsp;84).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The assumption of contemplative psychology is that contemplative traditions have in common "some normative anthropology, some notion of 'materialistic man' or 'fallen man' and the idea that human beings have the possibility to uplift themselves and others from their' corrupted state' towards what is often called 'enlightenment'"(p.&amp;nbsp;84).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Contemplative psychology gathers its knowledge base from the comparative analysis of experiential knowledge across contemplative traditions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Wit, H.F. de.’Methodologie in contemplatief perspectief’. In: L.K.A. Eisenga (e.d.). Over de qrenzen van de psychologie. Amsterdam: Swetz &amp; Zeitlinger, 1985.|last = |first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences from the psychology of religion and psychology in general==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If we would interpret the preposition ‘of’ in the possessive sense of 'belonging to', then contemplative psychology would definitely be a psychology of religion, but the academic ‘psychology of religion’ would not. For the standard interpretation of the preposition ‘of' in ‘psychology of religion’ is rather in the direction of ‘about’ than in the direction of ‘belonging to’. And conventional psychology about religion is not and does not intend to be a psychology belonging to religion" (p.86).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus contemplative psychology is a psychology of first-person experience. The psychology of religion (and scientific psychology) is a psychology ''about'' its object of study, it is a third-person psychology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The major difference is epistemological. The first-person nature of contemplative psychology values the knowledge which comes from private, personal experience. "It has its own notion of objectivity (see e.g. the ‘acid test of truth’ in Roberts, 1985: 171)" (p.86).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The psychology of religion and scientific psychology in general "tend to shun away from research into experience that is only available in the first-person sense. For the private character of first-person experience seems to exclude ‘objectivity’ as defined in third person methodology" (p.&amp;nbsp;86).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Differing objectives ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The object of contemplative psychology is the totality of human existence or human experience. The central question is: what is the place of all aspects of human life within the contemplative perspective and its development? How could one deal with all these aspects in a way that furthers one’s contemplative development" (p.87)?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The object of scientific psychology of religion is religion itself, which is viewed as one among the many non-religious aspects of human life. The central question here is: how could we gain a third-person psychological understanding of religious phenomena and how are these causally related to other non-religious phenomena" (p.87)?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Differing aims ===
The aim of contemplative psychology as a field of study is a way of life. It pursues knowledge about living "in the first-person sense of being wise [and] being free from confusion and ignorance" (p.&amp;nbsp;87).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The aim of psychology of religion is scientific knowledge, that is true information ''about'' its object of study. "This knowledge is primarily representational and indirect and as such distinct from (at a distance of) what it represents"(p.&amp;nbsp;87).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Differing methodology ===
Because of the difference in epistemological bases there is also differentiation between the methods of acquiring the differing types of knowledge. The methods of contemplative psychologies are in fact practices and disciplines like ([[meditation]], [[contemplation]], [[prayer]]) that bring about what the contemplative tradition views the existentential path towards the above-mentioned aims."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Han de Wit characterizes these practices as ''awareness strategies''&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; that are aimed at the "discipline of becoming aware on the spot of one’s working basis" (p.&amp;nbsp;111).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The methods of psychology of religion consist of the empirical scientific method, which are characterized by Han de Wit as ''conceptual strategies,'' as they aim for the development of conceptual knowledge that represents human behavior."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Uses ==
An example of using contemplative psychology would be using Buddhist concepts such as brilliant sanity (or [[buddha-nature]]), [[ego (religion)|ego]], [[mindfulness]], and interconnectedness as framework for interpreting psychological experiences, as is done in the contemplative counseling program at Naropa university.&lt;ref&gt;Nimmanheminda, S., Unger, R., Abigail, L., &amp; Mathew, H. (n.d.). (2010). Group therapy training at Naropa University's contemplative counseling psychology program. Group, 34(4), 309-318.&lt;/ref&gt; The same could be applied to other faiths, as May used the Christian concept of [[Grace (Christianity)|Grace]] as a framework for explaining our psychological surrender to a cosmic order.&lt;ref name="May, G. 1983"/&gt;

'''Contemporary-Traditional Art''' refers to an art produced at the present period of time that reflects the current culture by utilizing classical techniques in drawing, painting, and sculpting. Practicing artists are mainly concerned with the preservation of time-honored skills in creating works of [[Figurative art|figurative]] and [[Representation (arts)|representational]] forms of fine art as a means to express human emotions and experiences. Subjects are based on the aesthetics of balancing external reality with the intuitive, internal conscience driven by emotion, philosophical thought, or the spirit. The term is used broadly to encompass all styles and practices of representational art, such as [[Classicism]], [[Impressionism]], [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], and Plein Air ([[En plein air]]) painting. Technical skills are founded in the teachings of the [[Renaissance]], [[Academic Art]], and [[American Impressionism]].

== Organizations ==
Organized groups of practicing artists and institutions dedicated to furthering classical techniques include the [[Art Renewal Center]], [[California Art Club]], [[Florence Academy of Art]], [[Laguna College of Art and Design]], Los Angeles Academy of Figurative Art, [[New York Academy of Art]], and Portrait Society of America.

''Dietsche Warande'' had been established in the Netherlands in 1855 by [[Joseph Albert Alberdingk Thijm]], whose brother [[Peter Paul Maria Alberdingk Thijm|Paul]] had moved it to Flanders in 1887. ''Het Belfort'' was founded in 1886 by [[Jan Bols (author)|Jan Bols]]. 

The goal for the foundation of these magazines was to provide a forum for (Dutch-language) Flemish authors, who until then rarely published in Dutch magazines; especially Catholic and West-Flemish authors did not feel at home in the Dutch literary milieu of the nineteenth century.

Christophe Van Gerrewey is one of the members of the editorial board.&lt;ref name="ec"/&gt;

'''David Everett Mark''' (November 15, 1923 &amp;ndash; September 17, 2005) was a Career Minister in the [[United States Foreign Service]].

Born in [[New York City]] to Leslie Mark (ne Lazarus Macht) and Lena Tyor Mark, Mark graduated from [[Columbia University]], and while serving in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] during [[World War II]], he completed his studies at [[Columbia Law School]]. He joined the [[United States Foreign Service|U.S. Foreign Service]] in 1946, serving first in South Korea, Germany, Finland, Romania and Moscow in the 1950s.

Mark met his wife, Elisabeth Ann Lewis, in Moscow in 1958 where she headed the [[Anglo-America]]n [[Primary education|school]]. They married in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1959, and moved to [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] where Mark joined the delegation to the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|Test Ban Treaty]] negotiations.

In the early 1960s, Mark served in various capacities in INR at the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] until his appointment as [[United States Ambassador to Burundi]] from 1974 to 1977.  From 1979 to 1981 he served again at the State Department as a Deputy [[Assistant Secretary of State]]. After retirement from government in 1981, he consulted on [[international relations|international affairs]] for ALCOA in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].

Mark spoke fluent [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], and [[French language|French]], and was conversant in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. With the break-up of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1989 and the dearth of Russian linguists, Mark was asked to help establish the [[Diplomatic missions of the United States|American Embassy]] in the former [[Georgia (country)|Soviet Republic of Georgia]]. He returned to [[Tbilisi]] in 1992 to participate in helping the Georgians write their [[Constitution]].

During the 1990s until his death, Mark was an active member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in New York City. He volunteered every week for nine years as a guide and [[Translation|translator]] for [[Greeter|Big Apple Greeters]] of New York. He worked full-time as a licensed New York City tour guide for [[Gray Line Worldwide|Gray Line]]/CoachUSA. When he was not volunteering and touring on the Gray Line bus tours, Mark taught a variety of courses as an [[Professor#Other positions|adjunct professor]] of global affairs at [[New York University]].

Ambassador Mark died in a car accident in 2005 at age 81.

'''''Ecology and Society''''' (formerly ''Conservation Ecology'') is a quarterly [[open access]] [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] [[scientific journal]] published by the [[Resilience Alliance]]. It covers an array of disciplines from the [[natural science]]s, social sciences, and the humanities concerned with the relationship between society and the life-supporting [[ecosystem]]s on which human well-being ultimately depends. The journal's editors are [[Carl Folke]] ([[Stockholm Resilience Centre]]) and Lance Gunderson ([[Emory University]]). [[C. S. Holling]] was the founding editor.

Issues are available online as "in progress" as soon as articles are published. Special features are published separately throughout the year.  Many of the articles in ''Ecology and Society'' are published as part of special features.  Much of the research from a social-ecological systems perspective is published in ''Ecology and Society'' .   Recent special features include "Understanding Human Resilience in the Context of Interconnected Health and Social Systems", "Advancing the Understanding of Behavior in Social-Ecological Systems: Results from Lab and Field Experiments", and "A Framework for Analyzing, Comparing, and Diagnosing Social-Ecological Systems."

According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal has a 2016 [[impact factor]] of 2.8, and it ranks 20 of 105 journals in the field of Environmental Studies and 50 of 153 in the field of Ecology.&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite book |year=2014 |chapter=Ecology and Society |title=2014 Journal Citation Reports |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Science |accessdate=2017-09-27 |work=Web of Science |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Encyclopedia of Performing Arts was created by two separate projects, one dating to 1945 and the other to 1954.&lt;ref name="examenapium"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.examenapium.it/STUDI/Dizionari/damico.htm|title=Enciclopedia dello spettacolo, 11 voll. fondata da Silvio D'Amico  Roma: Le Maschere, 1954-1968|work=examenapium.it|language=Italian|accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early version===
Starting in 1945 or 1946, D'Amico conceived of a project to develop an encyclopedia of the performing arts. Undertaken by an editorial team composed of a few people and led by D'Amico, it was produced in three or four years and contained four volumes. Considered superficial, it was not publishable. However, it developed a model for scientific study of the theater and other performing arts.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt;

===Later version===
Conceived as a set of 12 volumes, the second project took on an ethnographic approach.  It had the advantage of a stable editorial group and used foreign employees. D'Amico's editorial staff worked at the [[Palazzo Doria Pamphili]], [[Via del Plebiscito]] 112.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt; The attorney [[Carlo Minù]], D'Amico's brother-in-law, found funding for the second project and referred D'Amico to publishers.&lt;ref name="unile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siba3.unile.it/ctle/damico/conversazione.htm|title=Conversazione sull'Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo con Alessandro D'Amico e Luigi Squarzina|work=unile.it|language=Italian|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In drawing up lists of [[dramas]], [[operas]], [[ballets]] and [[films]], the editorial team wondered if it their work was worthwhile or helpful.  It was [[Francesco Savio]] who sometimes said, "Of course it is; if someone else wants one day to create an Encyclopedia of Performing Arts, they would find this materials to be useful." When the news spread that the encyclopedia was about to be published, a delegation arrived wanting guidance in the organizational work to start up an encyclopedia of [[Prague]] theater.&lt;ref name="unile" /&gt;

The structure of the work was better articulated. Responsibility for each section, such as film, music, or theater, was delegated to an initial small staff that rapidly grew to thirty editors that coordinated over five hundred employees.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt; Large blocks of work were assigned to collaborators, many of them in foreign countries.

D'Amico felt that the second project benefited from finding amateur collectors without whose assistance entire sectors of biographical entries would have been less detailed. Collected material came from abroad or was bought directly in the antique market. An example of a collector was [[Ulderico Rolandi]], a gynecologist who lived in the [[Via Veneto]], and who had made a hobby of collecting, filing and examining [[libretto]]s. He had accumulated what was thought to be the largest collection of opera librettos after the [[Library of Congress]]. Another example was [[David Turcotte]] who had developed a catalog of American cinema.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The project suffered a severe crisis in 1957, two years after the death of D'Amico, due to disagreements between the editorial office and the publisher. The publisher's expectation was to publish two volumes a year, but the editorial staff was only able to put out a single volume each year. Because of this crisis, there is an imbalance between the first volume and the last four whose detail is considered sometimes less accurate.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt;

===Editions===
Published between 1954 and 1962, the original nine volume ''Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo'' covers ballet, films, opera, plays, theater, [[vaudeville]], and other areas of entertainment. They include signed essays that discuss performers, directors, and writers. Other sections discuss genres and themes, as well as history, technical subjects, and bibliographies.&lt;ref name="Yale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.library.yale.edu/content.php?pid=8564&amp;sid=66405 |title=Selected Dictionaries and Encyclopedias for Theater |publisher=Yale University Library |accessdate=16 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621091137/http://guides.library.yale.edu/content.php?pid=8564&amp;sid=66405 |archivedate=21 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The encyclopedia is over 18,000 pages in length and profusely illustrated with thousands of illustrations of which 700 are in the text, 1800 are out of the text, and there are 320 color plates. The first print run of 10,000 copies was followed by a reprint of 5,000 additional copies. Originally published in Rome by Casa Editrice Le Maschere, reprints were published by UNEDI.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Published in Rome by Unione Editoriale in 1966, the ''Enciclopedia dello spettacolo. Aggiornamento 1955-1965'' ("Encyclopedia of Performing Arts, Supplementary 1955-1965) is an update of the main set.  The Aggiornamento addresses developments and biographies.&lt;ref name="Yale" /&gt;

Published in Rome by Unione Editoriale in 1968, the ''Enciclopedia dello spettacolo. Indice-repertorio'' (Encyclopedia of Performing Arts. Index-Directory) is a title index of the 145,000 entries cited in the main set and the supplements.  It addresses author, genre and year of composition.&lt;ref name="Yale" /&gt;

==Personnel and management==
D'Amico conceived of the project and brought it to fruition.  The theater section was under the direction of [[Luigi Squarzina]]; he also did the film section.  D'Amico's father worked on the drama theatre section, while his brother Mario worked on the music section. [[Gabriele Baldini]] and later [[Gian Luigi Rondi]] were responsible for the cinema section. Additional sections were led by others including:  [[classical antiquity]] by [[Bruno Gentili]], German theater by [[Paolo Chiarini]], Slavic theater by [[Angelo Maria Ripellino]], English theater by Brunacci, French theater by [[Gian Carlo Roscioni]], Iberian theater by [[Luciana Stegagno Picchio]], and Italian theater by [[Niccolò Gallo]], [[Giulio Cesare Castello]], and [[Caesar Garboli]]. The [[Chamber music]] section was under the direction of D'Amico's son, [[Fedele D'Amico]], a [[Musicology|musicologist]], with [[Nino Pirrotta]], [[Franco Serpa]] and [[Emilia Zanetti]] as editors.

Consultants included [[Sabatino Moscati]] for Hebrew and [[Yiddish theater]]; [[Dario Puccini]] for the [[Iberian language]] theater; [[Luigi Salvini]] for Slavic, [[Finno-Ugric]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian language theater]]; [[Giuliano Bertuccioli]] for [[Chinese theater|Chinese language theater]]. Almost all of the drawings were made by young, recent graduates. Some of the illustrations were edited by [[Helen Poveledo]]. Texts and drafts were reviewed by professors.&lt;ref name="unile" /&gt;

==Critical and popular assessments==
Most libraries found it to be an essential component of their reference section.

The proposed biographies of many lesser figures were not included as the editorial staff were unable to keep up with the publisher's deadline.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt;

Criticisms of the encyclopedia have included the fact that it was only available in the Italian language, that it was [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]], and that non-European theater and 20th century theater were underrepresented. While the encyclopedia was first published in the 1950s, it was based on pre-[[World War II]] documentation. By the 1970s, the ''Encyclopedia of Performing Arts'' was considered out of date.&lt;ref name="Rubin" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18746">'''EyesOn Design''' are a series of events including an annual [[car show]] and a [[fundraiser]] for the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology. It has become a national event focused on the emotion and character of [[automotive design]].

== History ==
The Eyes on Design Show was established on the late-1986 as both celebration of [[automotive design]] and a fundraiser for the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology, a [[nonprofit organization]] in [[Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan]], devoted to matters pertaining to the [[Ophthalmology|eye and vision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eyeson.org/index.php/eyeson/as-history |title=The History of the EyesOn Design Car Show in June at the Edsel &amp; Eleanor Ford House in Grosse Pointe |first=Philip C. |last=Hessburg |publisher=Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130128132027/http://www.eyeson.org/index.php/eyeson/as-history |archivedate=28 January 2013 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.3ds.com/company/news-media/press-releases-detail/release/dassault-systemes-continues-tradition-of-sponsoring-eyeson/single/2492/?cHash=52d09b3ccc0fc59eaa396693b0dd4e7b |title=Dassault Systèmes Continues Tradition of Sponsoring EyesOn Design Competition |date=8 January 2008 |publisher=Dassault Systèmes |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first shows were called "Eyes On The Classics". The first shows were held in the [[Grosse Pointe Academy]] parking lots. Initially focused on the domestic "[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]" ([[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Chrysler LLC|Chrysler]]), the show was expanded to include automakers from around the world. The name was also changed to "EyesOn Design". For its third show, the venue moved to the grounds of the [[Edsel and Eleanor Ford House]].

To ease access and accommodate the increasing public attendance, the design chiefs at DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and General Motors suggested that the event be hosted by one of their companies each year.&lt;ref name="beauregard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.cardesignnews.com/features/2002/020715eyesondesign/index.html |title=Eyes on Design 2002 - A weekend of classic design |first=Marc |last=Beauregard |date=15 July 2002| publisher=Car Design News |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 show was held at the [[Chrysler Headquarters and Technology Center]] in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The theme for this 15th anniversary weekend-long show was "Performance Vehicles".&lt;ref name="beauregard"/&gt;

In 2003, the [[General Motors Technical Center]] in Warren, Michigan hosted the event. According to [[General Motors]], the 2003 event was the largest, most complete collection of concept vehicles ever assembled representing the very best efforts of GM, Ford, Chrysler, and other automakers.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.gmeurope.info/social_media_newsroom/news/2003/news_030603b.html |title=Design Automotive Exhibit at the GM Technical Center |publisher=General Motors |date=6 March 2003 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120311212908/http://www.gmeurope.info/social_media_newsroom/news/2003/news_030603b.html |archivedate=11 March 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-day event was also the first time the GM Design Center was open to the general public.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"/&gt; Attendees also had the opportunity to purchase rides in notable GM [[concept car]]s.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"/&gt;

A Founding Chairman of the annual EyesOn Design event, Chuck Jordan, was commemorated during the January 2011 [[North American International Auto Show]] in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardesignnews.com/site/home/rss_display/item214620/|title=2011 EyesOn Design Awards |first=Eric |last=Gallina |date=21 January 2011| publisher=Car Design News |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EyesOn Design show celebrated its 25th anniversary during summer 2012, on the grounds of the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House with over 200 vehicles displayed by invitation only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.candgnews.com/news/eyeson-design-celebrates-25-years-visionary-vehicles |title=EyesOn Design celebrates 25 years of visionary vehicles |first=K.

== Design focus ==
The "Eyes on Design Show" has grown from an East Side show to an automobile exhibition of national and international significance.&lt;ref name="wright"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://apps.detnews.com/apps/joyrides/index.php?id=408 |last=Wright |first=Richard A. |title=From modest beginnings, Eyes on Design is now a major show| newspaper=The Detroit News |date=7 July 2003 |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120318005148/http://apps.detnews.com/apps/joyrides/index.php?id=408 |archivedate=18 March 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Ford Motor Company]], the Eyes on Design Show is the world's only car show to focus on the emotion and character of automotive design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=8089 |title= Honorary Chairman Announced for 2001 Eyes On Design |date=20 April 2001 |publisher= Ford Motor |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121007092232/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=8089 |archivedate=7 October 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bringing together some 250 concept cars in one place is the secret of the show's success that has been driven by the enthusiastic assistance of automotive design executives.&lt;ref name="wright"/&gt; In addition to vehicles from various automakers, the event also features concept cars by invitation from some of the world's most renowned vintage automobile collectors and restorers.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"/&gt;

The vehicles shown at the annual event are by invitation. Judging in numerous classes is "based not on the quality of the restoration or authenticity"; rather it is on the basis of their "the design character, emotional appeal and artistic excellence of the vehicle."&lt;ref name="beauregard"/&gt;

== Lifetime Design Achievement ==
The EyesOn Design celebrations include the prestigious "Lifetime Design Achievement" award. This recognition is given to an accomplished automotive designer selected by previous winners of this award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.dbusiness.com/DBusiness/January-February-2010/EyesOn-Design-Celebrates-23-Years-with-the-Launch-of-its-2010-Season/ |title=EyesOn Design Celebrates 23 Years with the Launch of its 2010 Season |date=23 December 2009 |journal=dbusiness |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of its LORAN units are Apollo II 616B Aviation LORAN panel mount (1986), II Morrow Apollo 604 Loran Navigator (1987) and Apollo 820 GPS Flybuddy (1991). In 1986, [[United Parcel Service]] (UPS) purchased the company to expand the use of electronic technology in the package delivery and tracking business.

II Morrow shifted focus from marine business to development of package process automation technology for UPS such as vehicle management systems, automated high speed package sorting systems, as well as delivery and tracking systems. In 1999, II Morrow was renamed to UPS Aviation Technologies, and re-focused towards modernizing UPS' Boeing 7xx series Heavy Iron Transport Category Aircraft fleet, as well they also re-entered the general aviation marketplace. It certified the first Gamma 3 WAAS GPS engine for FAA Certified Precision GPS approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edprest.ca/page7ga_avionics.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223063701/http://www.edprest.ca/page7ga_avionics.htm |archivedate=2016-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new certified WAAS engine yielded vertical and horizontal accuracy of one meter RMS in guidance into airports without existing ILS approaches. This GPS technology met the FAA's TSO-C146a primary navigation standards for en route, terminal and approach phases of flight—with WAAS augmentation as the sole means of navigation.  This primary GPS "sole source" navigation capability was integrated into the CNX-80.  The CNX-80 WAAS GPS/COM/NAV integrated navigator was the first product in the industry approved for primary GPS navigation. It also enabled LPV "glidescope" approaches without requiring ground nav aids. New LNAV (GPS) approaches provide the accuracy and safety of an ILS—without the ground-based localizer and glideslope equipment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2004/november/pilot/presidents-position-(11)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the CNX-80 was renamed the GNS-480, under Garmin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/aviation-international-news/2008-01-14/faa-certifies-aviations-first-ifr-waas-receiver&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999: ''Flight International'' magazine presented UPS Aviation Technologies with its Aerospace Industry Award for the development of ADS-B, a surveillance technology intended to reduce aviation delays while improving safety.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ups-aviation-technologies-wins-international-recognition-for-ads-b-72733327.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wristwear==
Garmin produces activity trackers and sports watches, aimed at activities such as running, watersports, golf, cycling and swimming with sensors such as heart rate and gps. Some recent models add Bluetooth music playback and puls-oximetry.

The vivofit and vivosmart ranges are activity trackers. The Garmin Vivofit 3 measures the wearer's duration and quality of sleep, quantifies body movement, records heart rate, counts steps and the number of stairs climbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/garmin-vivofit-3-the-100-fitness-tracker-you-can-174954932.html |title=Garmin Vivofit 3 |last=Pogue |first=David |date=May 6, 2016 |website=[[Yahoo Tech]] |access-date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garmin produces the Vivosmart HR. It comes with the touch screen and includes heart rate monitoring, media player controls, smart notifications and phone finder features.

The Forerunner series is aimed at running primarily, but the watches are more breadly focussed, especially in the higher end. The 735 XT has multi-sport tracking capabilities (automatically switching betweek sports, for example in a triathlon) and a variety of special profiles for jogging, swimming, cycling, skiing, paddle sports, a variety of weight loss activities, and hiking. It comes with built-in heart rate sensor and GPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gadgetswizard.com/garmin-forerunner-735xt |title=Forerunner 735XT |work=gadgetswizard |access-date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fenix range, such as the Fenix 5 announced in 2017, is a more rugged, multisport range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heartratemonitorguides.com/garmin-fenix-5-review-pros-cons-difference-fenix-3/ |title=Garmin Fenix 5 |work=Heartratemonitorguides.com |access-date=Jan 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vivomove is a traditionally-styled watch with activity tracking capabilities. It has a built-in accelerometer (calculates distance during indoor workouts, without the need for a foot pod), step counter, auto goal (learns the wearer's activity level and assigns a daily step goal), move bar, and sleep-monitoring capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/health-fitness/vivomove-/prod532348.html |title=Garmin Vivomove |work=GarminStore |access-date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other series include the Quatix aimed at water sports, the D2 aviator watches, the Approach golf watches.

In 2018, Garmin introduced functionality such as maps, Bluetooth music playback, NFC payment and pulse-oximetry for it's wristwear.&lt;ref&gt; DC Rainmaker.

== Maps ==
Most current Garmin devices can display its current location on a map, which is vector-based and stored in the built-in memory or loaded from additional flash media. The built-in (or 'basemap') displays all country borders and major cities. Garmin offers different maps for purchase, including detailed road maps, topographic maps and nautical maps.  Non-commercial maps are also available and can be displayed on most Garmin GPS devices.

The maps used by Garmin products are currently provided by [[Navteq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www8.garmin.com/pressroom/corporate/111607.html|accessdate=2010-10-09|title=Garmin Ltd.

The '''German Studies Association''' ('''GSA''') is an international organization of scholars in [[history]], [[literature]], [[economics]], [[cultural studies]], and [[political science]] who study [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]]. The organization began in 1976 as the Western Association for German Studies, and was renamed as the GSA in 1983 after transforming itself into first a North American organization, and then an international one. The association awards the annual ''Sybil Halpern Milton Memorial Book Prize''.

==History==
The founder and long-time executive director of the GSA was Professor Gerald R. Kleinfeld of [[Arizona State University]]. He also served as the first editor of the association's scholarly journal, the ''[[German Studies Review]]'', which was first published in 1978. The executive director's position is currently held by Professor [[David E. Barclay]] of [[Kalamazoo College]], while the ''German Studies Review'' is edited by Professor Sabine Hake of the [[University of Texas, Austin]]. The association is governed by a Board elected by the members in accordance with the GSA by-laws. The GSA holds an annual conference each autumn in a North American location.

==Presidents==

'''HLA-NET''' is a network targeted to the study of [[Human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) from a [[population genetics|populational]] point of view. The network was initiated by [[COST]] Action BM0803&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cost.eu/domains_actions/bmbs/Actions/BM0803 Action page] on COST official site&lt;/ref&gt; in January 2009. Currently [http://hla-net.eu HLA-NET] activities are being coordinated by a subcommittee of the scientific committee of the  [[European Federation for Immunogenetics]].

The guidelines also include rules for the validation of samples and suggests minimal requirements for data analysis. The [http://hla-net.eu HLA-NET portal] provides an interface to software implementing these guidelines.

===Particularities of HLA data===

==HLA-NET guidelines==

===Population description===
HLA-NET main recommendations for population characterization have been published.&lt;ref name=Guidelines-IJIG /&gt; Most notably, outdated racial/ethnical and meaningless terms have to be replaced by an acceptable terminology to describe populations (i.e. geographical and cultural criteria). 
An electronic population questionnaire for field studies is available on the [http://hla-net.eu/wiki_spa/doku.php?id=wg1:population_questionnaire HLA-NET portal].

===Obtaining and reporting data===
HLA-NET defined standards for producing high quality data for HLA genotyping and proposed [http://hla-net.eu/wiki_spa/doku.php?id=wg2:guidelines guidelines for reporting typing ambiguities]. A best suitable format for optimal allelic and haplotypic HLA frequency estimations, based on the list of allele pairs that account for the genotyping information, has been published.&lt;ref name=Guidelines-IJIG /&gt; Other formats that allow to express ambiguities without simplifying the data can also be used.

===Validation of data sets===
[[Sample (statistics)|Sample]]s are used to provide [[allele frequency]] estimates for populations. For HLA [[Locus (genetics)|''loci'']], the presence of ambiguities and that of putative recessive-like undetected alleles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nunes|first=JM|author2=Riccio, ME |author3=Tiercy, JM |author4= Sanchez-Mazas, A |title=Allele frequency estimation from ambiguous data: using resampling schema in validating frequency estimates and in selective neutrality testing.|journal=Human Biology|date=Jun 2011|volume=83|issue=3|pages=437–47|pmid=21740157|url=http://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:16925|doi=10.3378/027.083.0307}}&lt;/ref&gt; require the assumption of [[Hardy-Weinberg]]. HLA-NET explicitly requests that frequency estimates, for alleles or haplotypes, be validated by checking their conformity with Hardy-Weinberg expectations. If Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is rejected then the frequencies can not be taken as representative of the population. The causes for deviation should be looked for &lt;ref name=Guidelines-IJIG /&gt; and, if possible, addressed. In any case, non Hardy-Weinberg frequencies should never be used as valid population estimates.

===Data analysis===

Besides the guidelines above, the HLA-NET network made a contributions in the following areas

===Usability of registry data===
Registries have moderate to huge data sets, but the recruitment often is not performed in such a way that registry data can be considered as representative of the population. However, under certain conditions, it is possible to assess if a given registry might be used as a population sample or not. Undergoing work is being conducted to formalise the constraints and the procedures required to use registry data as a proxy to population samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anthropological aspects of BMD Registries|url=http://www.efiweb.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf_nl/issue_70.pdf#13|work=EFI Newsletter - Issue 70|accessdate=7 June 2013|author=Constantia Voniatis Papaioannou!|author2=Alicia Sanchez-Mazas|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyperrealism''' is a genre of painting and sculpture resembling a high-resolution [[photograph]].  Hyperrealism is considered an advancement of [[Photorealism]] by the methods used to create the resulting paintings or sculptures.  The term is primarily applied to an independent art movement and art style in the United States and Europe that has developed since the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Bredekamp, Horst, Hyperrealism - One Step Beyond. Tate Museum, Publishers, UK. 2006. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carole Feuerman]] is the forerunner in the hyperrealism movement along with [[Duane Hanson]] and [[John De Andrea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Fragments Born of Water, Earth and Fire—Beyond Hyperrealism | date = March 19, 2014 | url = http://www.sculptclub.com/2014/03/fragments-born-of-water-earth-and-fire-beyond-hyperrealism/ | access-date = 24 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Phillips | first = Renee | title = Carole A.

==History==
[[Belgium|Belgian]] art dealer [[Isy Brachot]] coined the French word ''Hyperréalisme'', meaning [[Hyperrealism]], as the title of a major exhibition and catalogue at his gallery in [[City of Brussels|Brussels]] in 1973. The exhibition was dominated by such American Photorealists as [[Ralph Goings]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Don Eddy]], [[Robert Bechtle]] and [[Richard McLean (United States)|Richard McLean]]; but it included such influential European artists as [[Domenico Gnoli (painter)|Domenico Gnoli]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Konrad Klapheck]], and {{ill|Roland Delcol|fr}}. Since then, ''Hyperealisme'' has been used by European artists and dealers to apply to painters influenced by the Photorealists. Among contemporary European hyperrealist painters we find [[Gottfried Helnwein]] (Austrian), [[Willem van Veldhuizen]] and [[Tjalf Sparnaay]] (Dutch), [[Roger Wittevrongel]] (Belgian), as well as the French Pierre Barraya, Jacques Bodin, Ronald Bowen, François Bricq, Gérard Schlosser, Jacques Monory, Bernard Rancillac, Gilles Aillaud and Gérard Fromanger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hyperréalisme, le retour|url=http://www.hyperrealism.net/book%201.htm|website=www.hyperrealism.net|accessdate=Sep 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Peintre de la nouvelle figuration : christian babou, bernard rancillac, peter klasen, erro, ivan...|date=2013|publisher=University-Press Org|location=[S.l.]|isbn=9781230703480|url=https://jet.com/product/Peintre-de-La-Nouvelle-Figuration-Christian-Babou-Bernard-Rancillac-Peter-Klasen-Erro-Ivan-Messac-Valerio-Adami-Cybele-Varela-Regis-Deparis-P/77957038ce3d4e7b912748f87e315622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 21st century Hyperrealism was founded on the aesthetic principles of [[Photorealism]].  American painter [[Denis Peterson]], whose pioneering works are universally viewed as an offshoot of [[Photorealism]], first used&lt;ref name="Thompson, Graham P. 77-79"&gt;Thompson, Graham, ''American Culture in the 1980s'', Edinburgh University Press, 2007, pp. 77–79.&lt;/ref&gt; "Hyperrealism" to apply to the new movement and its splinter group of artists.&lt;ref name="Thompson, Graham P. 77-79"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Criqui, Jean-Claude Lebensztejn interview, Artforum International, June 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bechtle: A Retrospective by Michael Auping, Janet Bishop, Charles Ray, and Jonathan Weinberg. University of California Press, Berkeley, CA (2005). {{ISBN|978-0-520-24543-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham Thompson wrote "One demonstration of the way photography became assimilated into the art world is the success of photorealist painting in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  It is also called super-realism or hyper-realism and painters like [[Richard Estes]], [[Denis Peterson]], [[Audrey Flack]], and [[Chuck Close]] often worked from photographic stills to create paintings that appeared to be photographs."&lt;ref name="Thompson, Graham P. 77-79"/&gt;

However, Hyperrealism is contrasted with the literal approach found in traditional photorealist paintings of the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, Deborah G., 1996, Error and the Growth of Experimental Knowledge, Chicago: University of Chicago Press. pp. 57–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperrealist painters and sculptors use photographic images as a reference source from which to create a more definitive and detailed rendering, one that often, unlike [[Photorealism]], is narrative and emotive in its depictions. Strict Photorealist painters tended to imitate photographic images, omitting or abstracting certain finite detail to maintain a consistent over-all pictorial design.&lt;ref&gt;Chase, Linda, Photorealism at the Millennium, ''The Not-So-Innocent Eye: Photorealism in Context.''  Harry N. Abrams, Inc.  New York, 2002. pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nochlin, Linda]], The Realist Criminal and the Abstract Law II, ''Art In America.'' 61 (November - December 1973). p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  They often omitted human emotion, political value, and narrative elements.  Since it evolved from Pop Art, the photorealistic style of painting was uniquely tight, precise, and sharply mechanical with an emphasis on mundane, everyday imagery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbmaa.org/edu/periods/wwII.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313001058/http://www.nbmaa.org/edu/periods/wwII.htm |date=March 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperrealism, although photographic in essence, often entails a softer, much more complex focus on the subject depicted, presenting it as a living, tangible object.  These objects and scenes in Hyperrealism paintings and sculptures are meticulously detailed to create the illusion of a reality not seen in the original photo.  That is not to say they're [[surrealism|surreal]], as the illusion is a convincing depiction of (simulated) reality.  Textures, surfaces, lighting effects, and shadows appear clearer and more distinct than the reference photo or even the actual subject itself.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel, Louis K. ''Photorealism''.  Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers, New York.  1980.  p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperrealism has its roots in the philosophy of [[Jean Baudrillard]], "the simulation of something which never really existed."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baudrillard, "Simulacra and Simulation", Ann Arbor Mich.: University of Michigan Press, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, Hyperrealists create a false reality, a convincing illusion based on a simulation of reality, [[Digital photography|the digital photograph]].  Hyperreal paintings and sculptures are an outgrowth of extremely high-resolution images produced by digital cameras and displayed on computers.  As [[Photorealism]] emulated [[analog photography]], Hyperrealism uses digital imagery and expands on it to create a new sense of reality.&lt;ref name="Thompson, Graham P. 77-79"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks, Chris and Zoran Jevtic. Baudrillard For Beginners. Cambridge: Icon Books, 1996. pp. 80–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperrealistic paintings and sculptures confront the viewer with the illusion of manipulated high-resolution images, though more meticulous.&lt;ref&gt;Bredekamp, Horst, ''Hyperrealism - One Step Beyond''.  Tate Museum, Publishers, UK.  2006. pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and methods==
[[File:Man in a Boat 11.jpg|thumb|''Man in a Boat '' (2002), by [[Ron Mueck]], is a hyperrealistic 1/3 scale sculpture.]]
The Hyperrealist style focuses much more of its emphasis on details and the subjects. Hyperreal paintings and sculptures are not strict interpretations of photographs, nor are they literal illustrations of a particular scene or subject. Instead, they use additional, often subtle, pictorial elements to create the illusion of a reality which in fact either does not exist or cannot be seen by the human eye.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, John and Honour, Hugh ''The Visual Arts: A History,'' 3rd Edition.  Harry N. Abrams, Inc. New York, 1991. pp. 680–710.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, they may incorporate emotional, social, cultural and political thematic elements as an extension of the painted visual illusion; a distinct departure from the older and considerably more literal school of [[Photorealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Meisel, Louis K. ''Photorealism''. Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers, New York. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperrealist painters and sculptors make allowances for some mechanical means of transferring images to the canvas or mold, including preliminary drawings or [[grisaille]] [[underpainting]]s and molds.  Photographic slide projections or multi media projectors are used to project images onto canvases and rudimentary techniques such as gridding may also be used to ensure accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel, Louis K. ''Photorealism''.  Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers, New York.  1980.  pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Sculptures utilize polyesters applied directly onto the human body or mold.  Hyperrealism requires a high level of technical prowess and virtuosity to simulate a false reality. As such, Hyperrealism incorporates and often capitalizes upon photographic limitations such as depth of field, perspective and range of focus.  Anomalies found in digital images, such as fractalization, are also exploited to emphasize their digital origins by some [[Hyperrealist]] painters, such as [[Chuck Close]], [[Denis Peterson]], [[Bert Monroy]] and [[Robert Bechtle]].&lt;ref&gt;Battock, Gregory.  Preface to ''Photorealism''. Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers, New York, 1980. pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
[[File:La hora del te.jpg|thumb|''La hora del té'' by Magda Torres Gurza (oil on canvas, 90x140 cm).]]
Subject matter ranges from portraits, figurative art, still life, landscapes, cityscapes and narrative scenes. The more recent hyperrealist style is much more literal than [[Photorealism]] as to exact pictorial detail with an emphasis on social, cultural or political themes.  This also is in stark contrast to the newer concurrent [[Photorealism]] with its continued avoidance of photographic anomalies.  Hyperrealist painters at once simulate and improve upon precise photographic images to produce optically convincing visual illusions of reality, often in a social or cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;Petra Halkes, "A Fable in Pixels and Paint - Gottfried Helnwein's American Prayer". Image &amp; Imagination, Le Mois de la Photo à Montréal, McGill-Queen's University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7735-2969-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alicia Miller, "The Darker Side of Playland: Childhood Imagery from the Logan Collection at SFMOMA", Artweek, US, Nov. 1, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some hyperrealists have exposed [[totalitarian]] regimes and third world military governments through their narrative depictions of the legacy of hatred and intolerance.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baudrillard, "The Precession of Simulacra", in Media and Cultural Studies : Keyworks, Durham &amp; Kellner, eds. {{ISBN|0-631-22096-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denis Peterson]] and [[Gottfried Helnwein]] depicted political and cultural deviations of societal decadence in their work. [[Denis Peterson|Peterson]]'s work&lt;ref name="Thompson, Graham P. 77-79"/&gt; focused on [[diaspora]]s, [[genocides]] and [[refugees]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ayers, Art Critic, "Art Without Edges: Images of Genocide in Lower Manhattan", ''Art Info'', June 2, 2006 {{cite web |url=http://www.artinfo.com/News/Article.aspx?a=16964&amp;c=175 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504201929/http://www.artinfo.com/News/Article.aspx?a=16964&amp;c=175 |archivedate=2007-05-04 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gottfried Helnwein|Helnwein]] developed unconventionally narrative work that centered on past, present and future deviations of the [[Holocaust]]. Provocative subjects include enigmatic imagery of genocides, their tragic aftermath and the ideological consequences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chrisashley.net/weblog/archives/week_2006_06_04.html#001454 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502232656/http://www.chrisashley.net/weblog/archives/week_2006_06_04.html#001454 |date=May 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helnwein.com/presse/local_press/artikel_2630.html |title=Julia Pascal, "Nazi Dreaming", '&amp;#39;New Statesman'&amp;#39;, UK, April 10, 2006 |publisher=Helnwein.com |date=2006-04-10 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thematically, these controversial hyperreal artists aggressively confronted the corrupted human condition through narrative paintings as a phenomenological medium.&lt;ref&gt;George Ritzer, The McDonaldization of Society (2004). {{ISBN|978-0-7619-8812-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These lifelike paintings are an historical commentary on the grotesque mistreatment of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rywalt |first=Chris |url=http://www.crywalt.com/blog/2006/06/denis-peterson.html |title=Christoper Rywalt, "Denis Peterson", NYC Art, June 7, 2006 |publisher=Crywalt.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Flynn Johnson, Curator in Charge, "The Child - Works by Gottfried Helnwein", California Palace of the Legion of Honor, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, {{ISBN|0-88401-112-7}}, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperreal paintings and sculptures further create a tangible solidity and physical presence through subtle lighting and shading effects.  Shapes, forms and areas closest to the forefront of the image visually appear beyond the frontal plane of the canvas; and in the case of sculptures, details have more clarity than in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Daniel |last=Boorstin |title=The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America |year=1992 |publisher= Random House |isbn= 978-0-679-74180-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperrealistic images are typically 10 to 20 times the size of the original photographic reference source, yet retain an extremely high resolution in color, precision and detail.  Many of the paintings are achieved with an [[airbrush]], using acrylics, oils or a combination of both. [[Ron Mueck]]'s lifelike sculptures are scaled much larger or smaller than life and finished in incredibly convincing detail through the meticulous use of polyester resins and multiple molds. [[Bert Monroy]]'s digital images appear to be actual paintings taken from photographs, yet they are fully created on computers.

'''Amīn al-Dawla Abu'l-Ḥasan Hibat Allāh ibn Ṣaʿīd ibn al-Tilmīdh''' ({{lang-ar|هبة الله بن صاعد ابن التلميذ}}; 1074 – 11 April 1165) was a [[Syriac people|Syriac]] Christian physician, [[pharmacist]], poet, musician and [[calligrapher]] of the medieval [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]].

Ibn al-Tilmidh worked at the [[ʻAḍudī hospital]] in [[Baghdad]] where he eventually became its chief physician as well as court physician to the caliph [[Al-Mustadi]], and in charge of licensing physicians in Baghdad.&lt;ref name="chipman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chipman|first=Leigh|title=The world of pharmacy and pharmacists in Mamlūk Cairo|year=2010|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=90-04-17606-3|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He mastered the [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] languages.

He compiled several medical works, the most influential being ''Al-Aqrābādhīn al-Kabir'', a pharmacopeia which became the standard pharmacological work in the hospitals of the Islamic civilization, superseding an earlier work by [[Sabur ibn Sahl]].&lt;ref name="chipman" /&gt;

The '''''Journal of Higher Criticism''''' was an [[academic journal]] covering issues "dealing with historical, literary, and history-of-religion issues from the perspective of [[higher criticism]]", published by the ''Institute for Higher Critical Studies''. The [[editor-in-chief]] was [[Robert M. Price]].&lt;ref name=home&gt;{{cite web |title=Journal of Higher Criticism |accessdate=July 6, 2009 |url=http://www.depts.drew.edu/jhc/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The periodical is held by the Library of Congress and other research libraries.

In the introductory article, the editor criticized modern biblical scholarship as "a toothless tiger or worse yet, covert apologetics wearing the Esau-mask of criticism" and advocated a return to the "golden era of bold hypotheses and daring reconstructions associated with the great names of Baur and Tübingen".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://depts.drew.edu/jhc/pricejhc.html |title=Introducing the Journal of Higher Criticism |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the journal's first decade, it was sponsored by The Theological School at [[Drew University]],{{Fact|date=January 2016}} where associate editor [[Darrell J. Doughty]] taught. The final issue (volume 10, no. 2) appeared in Fall, 2003, shortly before Doughty's retirement.&lt;ref name=home /&gt;

The journal was revived in March 2018. Vol. 13, No. 1, was published to Robert M. Price's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://robertmprice.mindvendor.com/JHC/jhcvol13no1_2018.pdf|title=Journal of Higher Criticism|last=|first=|date=March 18, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lego Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Brick''''' (2008) is a 3-D computer-animated [[Lego]] short film that directed by [[Peder Pedersen (director)|Peder Pedersen]]. It combines details from all four ''Indiana Jones'' features into one continuous adventure with a humorous twist, and includes several inside-jokes for fans of both the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' films]] and the [[Star Wars|''Star Wars'' series]].

All four chapters, which combine to form a so-called "mini-epic", aired on [[Cartoon Network]] from May 10, 2008 and could be seen at the Lego ''Indiana Jones'' page on the Cartoon Network website, as well as on the [[Lego Indiana Jones]] website.

Pedersen had previously spoofed the ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' films in his music video for "[[Doctor Jones]]" (1997), a hit song by the [[Denmark|Danish]]/[[Norway|Norwegian]] [[dance-pop]] group [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]].

''Lego Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Brick'' was followed by ''[[Lego Star Wars: The Quest for R2-D2]]'' in 2009, also directed by Pedersen.

==Plot==
===Chapter 1===
''Raiders of the Lost Brick'' opens up with Indiana Jones and Satipo in a jungle. The two face several traps along the way including a pit, but Indy and Satipo continue their journey. When Indiana Jones has to get across tiles that lead to the altar with the idol, he dances on them, leaving Satipo a bit confused. Once he crossed the tiles, Indy grabs the idol and runs as the temple collapses. Satipo crosses the pit first, and gestures for the idol in exchange for giving Indy the whip. Indy throws the idol, but it hits Satipo in the head and knocks him out. Indy then builds a bridge out of Lego pieces to get across the pit, and once he crosses it he retrieves the whip and idol. The boulder trap is triggered, but Indy was able to escape. Once outside of the temple, he finds René Belloq waiting for him with two Hovitos warriors(who look like the Ugah warriors in chapter 3). Suddenly, the boulder crashes through the doorway where it was stuck and flattens René Belloq and the Hovitos, as Indy jumps away into Jock's seaplane, where Indy is seen with a check list and crosses "Idol" off the list.

===Chapter 2===
Indiana Jones and [[Marion Ravenwood]] are seen in a tomb with the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. As they try to fend off snakes, two German soldiers hoist the Ark out of the tomb, Indy and Marion then build a Lego elevator to escape the tomb. Indy and Marion safely get out of the tomb, and Indy goes on a horse to chase the truck that has the Ark. Indiana spots his father, Henry Jones Sr., reading a book about golf on a motorcycle. Indy jumps into the motorcycle and drives it. German soldiers on motorcycles drive toward the two and Indy grabs a flag, and knocks down both soldiers, and then uses his whip to get himself on top of the truck. The driver stops abruptly, and Indy falls onto the hood of the truck, he then accidentally pulls a piece of the hood off and falls, and goes under the truck until he reappears clinging to his whip, which was still hanging there from when he got on the truck. The grill of the truck breaks off and goes under it. Indy gets onto the grill and surfs on it, then leaps into the truck, and knocks the two German soldiers, a window frame, and a [[Imperial stormtrooper|Stormtrooper]] out of the truck. Indy gets to the driver and pushes him out as well. Indy drives the truck, and his father then joins him to ride off into the distance.

===Chapter 3===
This chapter opens up with Indy riding an amphibious vehicle in a river in a jungle. [[Mutt Williams]] comes out of a pitched tent and is delighted to see Indy coming back, but when Indy's vehicle gets on land and accidentally runs over Mutt's motorcycle, Mutt gets angry briefly. Indy shows Mutt the checklist with "Idol" and "Ark" checked off. The only unchecked item on the list is "Skull", and the two journey into the jungle. Suddenly, a rumbling sound is heard in the distance, and cutting through the jungle is [[Irina Spalko]] on a jungle cutter. The two run from and escape the cutter by falling into a ditch. They find themselves on a mine car, which runs down a track, around a rollercoaster-style loop and out a door that literally says "END OF RIDE". They see the jungle cutter again, and they continue running from it. When they go under an archway towards the temple and the jungle cutter tries to follow, it crashes. Spalko is then thrown off the vehicle and the jungle cutter gets destroyed. It forms a new machine with a saw blade, and Indy and Mutt decide to cut some [[pepperoni]] with it. Later, Indy and Mutt arrive at the temple entrance, but two natives stop them. They point to Indy, then Mutt, and then to a sign that says a person had to be as tall as a part of their spear to enter. Mutt is too short to go in, much to Indy's laughter, but he is able to go in anyway. Inside the temple, Indiana and Mutt run from spears (which eventually hit a dart board) until they come across a mirror. Indy's reflection is [[Han Solo]] (hinting that both Indiana Jones and Han Solo were played by [[Harrison Ford]]), and Mutt's reflection is of [[Chewbacca]], (probably because he's seen as a companion to Indy, like Chewbacca is Han Solo's companion). Later, while Irina and Mutt are in a sword duel, Indy takes the Crystal Skull from one of the skeletons. The temple collapses behind the two, probably leaving Irina to be crushed after falling in a light-filled chasm to her death, and a close-up shows the skull as the movie ends.

===Chapter 4===
On Cartoon Network and on its website, Chapter 3 replays and then Chapter 4 starts. But on the Lego Indiana Jones website, Chapter 3 does not repeat itself, as all four chapters are presented together in the order they were released.

The chapter begins at a party at Indy's place. Mutt hangs the Crystal Skull on a string together with other lanterns and seems to be a good bug electrifier. The Idol is used as a [[candle]] holder and the Ark is used as a [[grill (cooking)|grill]] (producing a thunderstorm during its use). Indy uses a spatula to flip and serve a burger. And Henry Jones Sr. (using the [[Holy Grail]] as a cup) toasts glasses with Mutt's cup. It is then revealed that the film was being watched in a movie theater by Lego versions of [[Steven Spielberg]] (wearing an ''[[E.T. The Extra Terrestrial|E.T. II]]'' hat) and [[George Lucas]], who nod at each other as the movie ends and give each other a high-five with a whip crack.

{{IPA notice}}
In [[linguistics]], '''lenition''' is a kind of [[sound change]] that alters [[consonant]]s, making them more [[sonority hierarchy|sonorous]]. The word ''lenition'' itself means "softening" or "weakening" (from [[Latin]] ''lenis'' "weak"). Lenition can happen both [[synchronic analysis|synchronically]] (i.e. within a language at a particular point in time) and [[historical linguistics|diachronically]] (i.e. as a [[evolutionary linguistics|language changes over time]]). Lenition can involve such changes as making a consonant more sonorous, causing a consonant to lose its [[place of articulation]] (a phenomenon called ''[[debuccalization]]'', which turns a consonant into a [[glottal consonant]] like {{IPAblink|h}} or {{IPAblink|ʔ}}), or even causing a consonant to disappear entirely.

An example of synchronic lenition in [[American English]] is found in [[flapping]] in some dialects: the {{IPA|/t/}} of a word like ''wait'' {{IPA|[weɪt]}} becomes the more sonorous {{IPAblink|ɾ}} in the related form ''waiting'' {{IPA|[ˈweɪɾɪŋ]}}. Some dialects of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] show [[debuccalization]] of {{IPA|/s/}} to {{IPAblink|h}} at the end of a [[syllable]], so that a word like {{lang|es|estamos}} "we are" is pronounced {{IPA|[ehˈtamoh]}}. An example of diachronic lenition can be found in the [[Romance languages]], where the {{IPA|/t/}} of Latin {{lang|la|patrem}} ("father", [[accusative]]) becomes {{IPAblink|d̪|d}} in [[Italian language|Italian]] {{lang|it|padre}} and {{IPAblink|ð̞}} in Spanish {{lang|es|padre}}, while in Catalan {{lang|ca|pare}}, French {{lang|fr|père}} and Portuguese {{lang|pt|pai}} it has disappeared completely. Along with [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], lenition is one of the primary sources of [[phonological change]] of languages.

In some languages, lenition has been grammaticalized into a [[consonant mutation]], which means it is no longer triggered by its [[phonological]] environment but is now governed by its [[syntactic]] or [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] environment. For example, in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], the word {{lang|cy|cath}} "cat" begins with the sound {{IPA|/k/}}, but after the [[definite article]] {{lang|cy|y}}, the {{IPA|/k/}} changes to {{IPAblink|ɡ}}: "the cat" in Welsh is {{lang|cy|y gath}}. This was historically due to intervocalic lenition, but in the plural, lenition does not happen, so "the cats" is {{lang|cy|y cathod}}, not *{{lang|cy|y gathod}}. The change of {{IPA|/k/}} to {{IPA|[ɡ]}} in {{lang|cy|y gath}} is thus caused by the syntax of the phrase, not by the phonological position of the consonant {{IPA|/k/}}.

The opposite of lenition, [[fortition]], a sound change that makes a consonant "stronger", is less common.

==Types==
Lenition involves changes in [[manner of articulation]], sometimes accompanied by small changes in [[place of articulation]]. There are two main lenition pathways: opening and sonorization. In both cases, a stronger sound becomes a weaker one. Lenition can be seen as a movement on the [[sonority hierarchy]] from less sonorous to more sonorous, or on a strength hierarchy from stronger to weaker.

In examples below, a [[greater-than sign]] indicates that one sound changes to another. The notation {{IPA|[t]}} &gt; {{IPA|[ts]}} means that {{IPA|[t]}} changes to {{IPA|[ts]}}.

The [[Palatalization (sound change)|sound change of palatalization]] sometimes involves lenition.

Lenition includes the loss of a feature, such as [[glottalic consonant|deglottalization]], in which [[glottalization]] or [[ejective consonant|ejective articulation]] is lost: {{IPA|[kʼ]}} or {{IPA|[kˀ]}} &gt; {{IPA|[k]}}.

The tables below show common sound changes involved in lenition. In some cases, lenition may skip one of the sound changes. The change voiceless stop &gt; fricative is more common than the series of changes voiceless stop &gt; affricate &gt; fricative.

===Opening===
In the opening type of lenition, the articulation becomes more open with each step. Opening lenition involves several sound changes: '''shortening''' of double consonants, '''[[affrication]]''' of stops, '''[[Lenition#Spirantization|spirantization]]''' of stops or affricates, '''[[debuccalization]]''', and finally '''[[elision]]'''.
* {{IPA|[tt]}} or {{IPA|[tː]}} &gt; {{IPA|[t]}} (shortening)
* {{IPA|[t]}} &gt; {{IPA|[ts]}} (affrication)
* {{IPA|[t]}} or {{IPA|[ts]}} &gt; {{IPA|[s]}} (spirantization)
* {{IPA|[t]}} &gt; {{IPA|[ʔ]}}; {{IPA|[s]}} &gt; {{IPA|[h]}} (debuccalization)
* {{IPA|[t]}}, {{IPA|[ts]}}, {{IPA|[s]}}, {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, {{IPA|[h]}} &gt; ∅ (elision)

===Sonorization===
The sonorization type involves voicing. Sonorizing lenition involves several sound changes: voicing, approximation, and vocalization.{{clarify|reason=More sound changes are involved, and if there are specific names for the different changes, these should be listed.|date=February 2015}}
* {{IPA|[t]}} &gt; {{IPA|[d]}} (voicing)
* {{IPA|[d]}} &gt; {{IPA|[ð]}} (approximation)
* {{IPA|[d]}} &gt; {{IPA|[i]}} (vocalization)

Sonorizing lenition occurs especially often intervocalically (between vowels).  In this position, lenition can be seen as a type of [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of the consonant to the surrounding vowels, in which features of the consonant that are not present in the surrounding vowels (e.g. obstruction, voicelessness) are gradually eliminated.

Some of the sounds generated by lenition are often subsequently "normalized" into related but cross-linguistically more common sounds.  An example would be the changes {{IPA|[b]}} → {{IPA|[β]}} → {{IPA|[v]}} and {{IPA|[d]}} → {{IPA|[ð]}} → {{IPA|[z]}}.  Such normalizations correspond to diagonal movements down and to the right in the above table.  In other cases, sounds are lenited and normalized at the same time; examples would be direct changes {{IPA|[b]}} → {{IPA|[v]}} or {{IPA|[d]}} → {{IPA|[z]}}.

====Vocalization====
[[L-vocalization|''L''-vocalization]] is a subtype of the sonorization type of lenition. It has two possible results: a velar approximant or back vowel, or a palatal approximant or front vowel. In [[French language|French]], ''l''-vocalization of the sequence {{IPA|/al/}} resulted in the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/au/}}, which was [[monophthongized]], yielding the [[monophthong]] {{IPA|/o/}} in Modern French.

|}

===Mixed===
Sometimes a particular example of lenition mixes the opening and sonorization pathways. For example, {{IPA|[kʰ]}} may spirantize or open to {{IPA|[x]}}, then voice or sonorize to {{IPA|[ɣ]}}.

Lenition can be seen in [[Canadian English|Canadian]] and [[American English]], where {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}} soften to a tap {{IPA|[ɾ]}} ([[flapping]]) when not in initial position and followed by an unstressed vowel. For example, both ''rate'' and ''raid'' plus the suffix ''-er'' are pronounced {{IPA|[ˈɹeɪ̯ɾɚ]}}. In many [[British English]] dialects, a different lenition that affects only {{IPA|[t]}} takes place: {{IPA|[t]}} &gt; {{IPA|[ʔ]}} (see [[T-glottalization]]).  The Italian of Central and Southern Italy has a number of lenitions, the most widespread of which is the deaffrication of {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} to {{IPA|[ʃ]}} between vowels: post-pausal {{lang|it|cena}} {{IPA|[ˈt͡ʃeːna]}} 'dinner' but post-vocalic {{lang|it|la cena}} {{IPA|[laˈʃeːna]}} 'the dinner'; the name {{lang|it|Luciano}}, although structurally {{IPA|/luˈt͡ʃano/}}, is normally pronounced {{IPA|[luˈʃaːno]}}. In Tuscany, {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} likewise is realized {{IPA|[ʒ]}} between vowels, and in typical speech of Central Tuscany, the voiceless stops {{IPA|/p t k/}} in the same position are pronounced respectively {{IPA|[ɸ θ x/h]}}, as in {{IPA|/la kasa/}} → {{IPA|[laˈhaːsa]}} 'the house', {{IPA|/buko/}} → {{IPA|[ˈbuːho]}} 'hole'.

==Effects==
===Diachronic===
[[Diachronic linguistics|Diachronic]] lenition is found, for example, in the change from [[Latin]] into [[Spanish language|Spanish]], in which the [[wikt:intervocalic|intervocalic]] voiceless stops {{IPA|[p t k]}} first changed into their voiced counterparts {{IPA|[b d ɡ]}}, and later into the approximants or fricatives {{IPA|[β̞ ð̞ ɣ̞]}}: {{lang|la|vita}} &gt; {{lang|es|vida}}, {{lang|la|lupa}} &gt; {{lang|es|loba}}, {{lang|la|caeca}} &gt; {{lang|es|ciega}}, {{lang|la|apotheca}} &gt; {{lang|es|bodega}}. One stage in these changes goes beyond phonetic to have become a [[phonological change|phonological restructuring]], e.g. {{IPA|/lupa/}} &gt; {{IPA|/loba/}} (compare {{IPA|/lupa/}} in Italian, with no change in the phonological status of {{IPA|/p/}}). The subsequent further weakening of the series to phonetic {{IPA|[β̞ ð̞ ɣ̞]}}, as in {{IPA|[loβ̞a]}} is diachronic in the sense that the developments took place over time and displaced {{IPA|[b, d, g]}} as the normal pronunciations between vowels. It is also synchronic in an analysis of {{IPA|[β̞ ð̞ ɣ̞]}} as [[allophone|allophonic]] realizations of {{IPA|/b, d, g/}}: illustrating with {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/bino/}} 'wine' is pronounced {{IPA|[bino]}} after pause, but with {{IPA|[β̞]}} intervocalically, as in {{IPA|[de β̞ino]}} 'of wine'; likewise, {{IPA|/loba/}} → {{IPA|[loβ̞a]}}.   

A similar development occurred in the Celtic languages, where non-geminate intervocalic consonants were converted into their corresponding weaker counterparts through lenition (usually stops into fricatives but also laterals and trills into weaker laterals and taps), and voiceless stops became voiced. For example, Indo-European intervocalic *{{PIE|-t-}} in ''*{{PIE|teu̯teh₂}}'' "people" resulted in [[Proto-Celtic]] {{wikt-lang|cel-x-proto|*toutā}}, [[Primitive Irish]] ''*{{lang|pgl|tōθā}}'', [[Old Irish]] {{wikt-lang|sga|túath}} {{IPA|/tuaθ/}} and ultimately complete deletion in modern [[Scots Gaelic]] {{lang|gd|tuath}} {{IPA|/t̪ʰuə/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Stifter| first = David| title = Sengoídelc: Old Irish for Beginners| year = 2006| isbn = 978-0-8156-3072-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of historical lenition in the [[Germanic language]]s is evidenced by Latin-English cognates such as {{lang|la|pater}}, {{lang|la|tenuis}} vs. ''father'', ''thin''. The Latin words preserved the original stops, which became fricatives in old Germanic by [[Grimm's law]]. A few centuries later, the [[High German consonant shift]] led to a second series of lenitions in [[Old High German]], chiefly of post-vocalic stops, as evidenced in the English-German cognates ''ripe'', ''water'' vs. {{lang|de|reif}}, {{lang|de|Wasser}}.

Although actually a much more profound change encompassing syllable restructuring, simplification of [[geminate consonant]]s as in the passage from Latin to Spanish such as CUPPA &gt; {{IPA|/ˈkopa/}} 'cup' is often viewed as a type of lenition (compare geminate-preserving Italian {{IPA|/ˈkɔppa/}}).

===Synchronic===

====Allophonic====
Like other [[Western Romance languages]], many varieties of [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] offer an example of [[sandhi]] where the rule of intervocalic lenition extends across word boundaries. Since it is a fully active synchronic rule, lenition is not normally indicated in the normal orthography.&lt;ref&gt;Mensching, G. (1992) ''Einführung in die Sardische Sprache'' Romanistischer Verlag, Bonn&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|}
A [[Tuscan gorgia|series of synchronic lenitions]] involving opening, or loss of occlusion, rather than voicing is found for post-vocalic {{IPA|/p t k/}} in much of [[Tuscany]], in Central Italy. Stereotypical [[Florence|Florentine]], for example, has the {{IPA|/k/}} of {{IPA|/kasa/}} as {{IPA|[ˈkaːsa]}} {{lang|it|casa}} 'house' in a post-pause realization, {{IPA|[iŋˈkaːsa]}} {{lang|it|in casa}} 'in (the) house' post-consonant, but {{IPA|[laˈhaːsa]}} {{lang|it|la casa}} 'the house' intervocalically. Word-internally, the normal realization is also {{IPA|[h]}}: {{IPA|/ˈbuko/}} {{lang|it|buco}} 'hole' → {{IPA|[ˈbuːho]}}.

====Grammatical====
In the [[Celtic languages]], the phenomenon of intervocalic lenition historically extended across word boundaries. This explains the rise of [[Grammaticalisation|grammaticalised]] initial [[consonant mutation]]s in modern Celtic languages through the loss of endings. A [[Scottish Gaelic]] example would be the lack of lenition in {{lang|gd|am fear}} {{IPA|/əm fɛr/}} ("the man") and lenition in {{lang|gd|a’ bhean}} {{IPA|/ə vɛn/}} ("the woman"). The following examples show the development of a phrase consisting of a definite article plus a masculine noun (taking the ending {{lang|gd|-os}}) compared with a feminine noun taking the ending {{lang|gd|-a}}. The historic development of lenition in these two cases can be reconstructed as follows:

:[[Proto-Celtic]] {{lang|cel-x-proto|*(s)indo'''s w'''iros}} IPA: {{IPA|[wiɾos]}} → Old Irish {{lang|sga|ind fer}} {{IPA|[fʲeɾ]}} → Middle Irish {{lang|mga|in fer}} {{IPA|[fʲeɾ]}} → [[Classical Gaelic]] {{lang|ghc|an fear}} {{IPA|[fʲeɾ]}} → Modern Gaelic {{lang|gd|am fear}} {{IPA|[fɛɾ]}}

:Proto-Celtic {{lang|cel-x-proto|*(s)ind'''ā be'''nā}} IPA: {{IPA|[vʲenaː]}} → Old Irish {{lang|sga|ind ben}} {{IPA|[vʲen]}} → Middle Irish {{lang|mga|in ben}} {{IPA|[vʲen]}} → Classical Gaelic {{lang|ghc|an bhean}} {{IPA|[vʲen]}} → Modern Gaelic {{lang|gd|a' bhean}} {{IPA|[vɛn]}}

Synchronic lenition in Scottish Gaelic affects almost all consonants (except {{IPA|/l̪ˠ/}} which has lost its lenited counterpart in most areas).&lt;ref name="Oftedal"&gt;Oftedal, M. (1956) ''The Gaelic of Leurbost'' Norsk Tidskrift for Sporgvidenskap, Oslo&lt;/ref&gt; Changes such as {{IPA|/n̪ˠ/}} to {{IPA|/n/}} involve the loss of [[secondary articulation]]; in addition, {{IPA|/rˠ/}} → {{IPA|/ɾ/}} involves the reduction of a [[trill consonant|trill]] to a [[tap consonant|tap]]. The spirantization of Gaelic nasal {{IPA|/m/}} to {{IPA|/v/}} is unusual among forms of lenition, but is triggered by the same environment as more prototypical lenition. (It may also leave a residue of [[nasalization]] in adjacent vowels.&lt;ref&gt;Ternes, E. (1989) ''The Phonemic Analysis of Scottish Gaelic'' Helmut Buske Verkag, Hamburg&lt;/ref&gt; The orthography shows this by inserting an {{lang|gd|h}} (except after {{lang|gd|l n r}}):

=== Blocked lenition ===
Some languages which have lenition have in addition complex rules affecting situations where lenition might be expected to occur but does not, often those involving [[homorganic consonants]]. In Scottish Gaelic, for example, there are three homorganic groups:&lt;ref name="Blas"&gt;{{cite book| last = Bauer| first = Michael| title = Blas Na Gāidhlig: The Practical Guide to Scottish Gaelic Pronunciation| year = 2011| isbn = 978-1-907165-00-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* d n t l s (usually called the [[Dental consonant|dental]] group in spite of the non-dental nature of the palatals)
* c g (usually called the [[Velar consonant|velar]] group)
* b f m p (usually called the [[Labial consonant|labial]] group)
In a position where lenition is expected due to the grammatical environment, lenition tends to be blocked if there are two adjacent homorganic consonants across the word boundary. For example:&lt;ref name=Blas/&gt;
* {{lang|gd|aon}} 'one' (which causes lenition) → {{lang|gd|aon chas}} 'one leg' vs {{lang|gd|ao'''n t'''aigh}} 'one house' (not {{lang|gd|aon *thaigh}})
* {{lang|gd|air an}} 'on the' (which causes lenition) → {{lang|gd|air a' chas mhòr}} 'on the big leg' vs {{lang|gd|air a'''n t'''aigh '''d'''onn}} "on the brown house" (not {{lang|gd|air an *thaigh *dhonn}})
In modern Scottish Gaelic this rule is only [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] in the case of dentals but not the other two groups for the vast majority of speakers. It also does not affect all environments any more. For example, while {{lang|gd|aon}} still invokes the rules of blocked lenition, a noun followed by an adjective generally no longer does so. Hence:&lt;ref name=Blas/&gt;
* {{lang|gd|ad}} "hat" (a feminine noun causing lenition) → {{lang|gd|ad dhonn}} "a brown hat" (although some highly conservative speakers retain {{lang|gd|ad donn}})
* {{lang|gd|caileag}} "girl" (a feminine noun causing lenition) → {{lang|gd|caileag ghlic}} "a smart girl" (not {{lang|gd|caileag *glic}})
There is a significant number of frozen forms involving the other two groups (labials and velars) and environments as well, especially in surnames and place names:&lt;ref name=Blas/&gt;
* {{lang|gd|Ma'''cG'''umaraid}} 'Montgomery' ({{lang|gd|mac}} + {{lang|gd|Gumaraid}}) vs {{lang|gd|Ma'''cDh'''òmhnaill}} 'MacDonald ({{lang|gd|mac}} + {{lang|gd|Dòmhnall}})
* {{lang|gd|Cai'''mb'''eul}} 'Campbell' ({{lang|gd|cam}} 'crooked' + {{lang|gd|beul}} 'mouth') vs {{lang|gd|Ca'''msh'''ron}} 'Cameron' ({{lang|gd|cam}} + {{lang|gd|sròn}} 'nose')
* {{lang|gd|sgia'''n-d'''ubh}} '[[Sgian-dubh]]' ({{lang|gd|sgian}} 'knife' + {{lang|gd|dubh}} '1 black 2 hidden'; {{lang|gd|sgian}} as a feminine noun today would normally cause lenition on a following adjective) vs {{lang|gd|sgian dhubh}} "a black knife" (i.e., a common knife which just happens to be black)
Though rare, in some instances the rules of blocked lenition can be invoked by lost historical consonants, for example, in the case of the past-tense [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] {{lang|gd|bu}}, which in [[Common Celtic]] had a final -t. In terms of blocked lenition, it continues to behave as a dental-final particle invoking blocked lenition rules:&lt;ref name=Blas/&gt;
* {{lang|gd|bu '''d'''ona am biadh}} "bad was the food" versus {{lang|gd|bu '''mh'''òr am beud}} 'great was the pity

Blocked lenition phenomena are also known to occur in Irish and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (orthographic b d g retained as {{IPA|[b, d, ɡ]}} following nasals rather than their normal lenited forms {{IPA|[β, ð, ɣ]}}).

==Orthography==
{{see also|Welsh morphology|Irish initial mutations}}
In the modern Celtic languages, lenition of the "fricating" type is usually denoted by adding an ''h'' to the lenited letter. In Welsh, for example, {{lang|cy|c}}, {{lang|cy|p}}, and {{lang|cy|t}} change into {{lang|cy|ch}}, {{lang|cy|ph}}, {{lang|cy|th}} as a result of the so-called "aspirate mutation" ({{lang|cy|carreg}}, "stone" → {{lang|cy|ei charreg}} "her stone"). An exception is [[Manx language|Manx]] orthography, which tends to be more phonetic, although in some cases etymological principles are applied. In the [[Gaelic type|Gaelic script]], fricating lenition (usually called simply ''lenition'') is indicated by a [[dot above]] the affected consonant, while in the Roman script, the convention is to suffix the letter {{lang|gv|h}} to the consonant, to signify that it is lenited. Thus, {{lang|gv|a ṁáṫair}} is equivalent to {{lang|gv|a mháthair}}. In [[Middle Irish]] manuscripts, lenition of {{lang|mga|s}} and {{lang|mga|f}} was indicated by the dot above, while lenition of {{lang|mga|p}}, {{lang|mga|t}}, and {{lang|mga|c}} was indicated by the postposed {{lang|mga|h}}; lenition of other letters was not indicated consistently in the orthography.

Voicing lenition is represented by a simple letter switch in the [[Brythonic languages]], for instance {{lang|cy|carreg}}, "stone" → {{lang|cy|y garreg}}, "the stone" in Welsh. In [[Irish orthography]], it is shown by writing the "weak" consonant alongside the (silent) "strong" one: {{lang|ga|peann}}, "pen" → {{lang|ga|ár bpeann}} "our pen", {{lang|ga|ceann}}, "head" → {{lang|ga|ár gceann}} "our head" (sonorization is traditionally called "eclipsis" in Irish grammar). 

Although nasalization as a feature also occurs in most Scottish Gaelic dialects, it is not shown in the orthography on the whole as it is synchronic (i.e., the result of certain types of nasals affecting a following sound), rather than the diachronic Irish type sonorization (i.e., following historic nasals). For example {{lang|ga|taigh}} {{IPA|[t̪ʰɤj]}} "house" → {{lang|ga|an taigh}} {{IPA|[ən̪ˠˈd̪ʱɤj]}} "the house".&lt;ref name=Oftedal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Roibeard O. Maolalaigh|author2=Iain MacAonghuis | title = Scottish Gaelic in 3 Months| year = 1997| publisher = Hunter Pub Incorporated| isbn = 978-0-85285-234-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consonant gradation==
{{main|Consonant gradation}}
The phenomenon of consonant gradation in [[Sami languages|Samic]] and [[Finnic languages]] is also a form of lenition.

An example with [[geminate]] consonants comes from Finnish, where geminates become simple consonants while retaining voicing or voicelessness (e.g. {{lang|fi|katto}} → {{lang|fi|katon}}, {{lang|fi|dubbaan}} → {{lang|fi|dubata}}). It is also possible for entire consonant clusters to undergo lenition, as in [[Votic language|Votic]], where voiceless clusters become voiced, e.g. {{lang|vot|itke-}} "to cry" → {{lang|vot|idgön}}.

If a language has no obstruents other than voiceless stops, other sounds are encountered, as in Finnish, where the lenited grade is represented by [[chroneme]]s, [[approximant]]s, [[flap consonant|tap]]s or even [[trill consonant|trills]]. For example, Finnish used to have a complete set of spirantization reflexes for {{IPA|/p t k/}}, though these have been lost in favour of similar-sounding phonemes. In Pohjanmaa [[Finnish language|Finnish]], {{IPA|/ð/}} was changed into {{IPA|/r/}}, thus the dialect has a synchronic lenition of an alveolar stop into an alveolar trill {{IPA|/t/ → /r/}}. Furthermore, the same phoneme {{IPA|/t/}} undergoes [[assibilation]] {{IPA|/t/}} → {{IPA|/s/}} before the vowel {{IPA|/i/}}, e.g. root {{lang|fi|vete-}} "water" → {{lang|fi|vesi}} and {{lang|fi|vere-}}. Here, {{lang|fi|vete-}} is the stem, {{lang|fi|vesi}} is its nominative, and {{lang|fi|vere-}} is the same stem under consonant gradation.

==Fortition==
{{main|Fortition}}
Fortition is the opposite of lenition: a consonant mutation in which a consonant changes from one considered weak to one considered strong. Fortition is less frequent than lenition in the languages of the world, but word-initial and word-final fortition is fairly frequent.

Italian, for example, presents numerous regular examples of word-initial fortition both historically (Lat. {{lang|la|Januarius}} with initial {{IPA|/j/}} &gt; {{lang|it|gennaio}}, with {{IPA|[dʒ]}}) and synchronically (e.g., {{IPA|/ˈkaza/}} "house, home" → {{IPA|[ˈkaːza]}} but {{IPA|/a ˈkaza/}} "at home" → {{IPA|[aˈkːaːza]}}).

Catalan is among numerous Romance languages with diachronic [[Final-obstruent devoicing|word-final devoicing]] ({{lang|la|frigidus}} &gt; {{IPA|*/ˈfɾɛd/}} &gt; {{lang|ca|fred}} {{IPA|[ˈfɾɛt]}}. Fortition also occurs in Catalan for {{IPA|/b d ɡ/}} in consonant clusters with a lateral consonant (Lat. {{lang|la|populus}} &gt; {{lang|ca|poble}} {{IPA|[ˈpɔbːɫə]}} or {{IPA|[ˈpɔpːɫə]}}.

Word-medially, {{IPA|/lː/}} is subject to fortition in numerous Romance languages, ranging from {{IPA|[dː]}} in many speech types on Italian soil to {{IPA|[dʒ]}} in some varieties of Spanish.

The film critic [[Laura Mulvey]] coined the term ''male gaze'', which is contrasted with the concept of the [[female gaze]];&lt;ref name="interview-mulvey-2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jacobsson"&gt;{{Cite report |author= Jacobsson, Eva-Maria |date= 1999 |title= A Female Gaze? |url= http://cid.nada.kth.se/pdf/cid_51.pdf |format= pdf |publisher= [[Royal Institute of Technology|Royal Institute of Technology (Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan)]] |location= Stockholm, Sweden |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111004025557/http://cid.nada.kth.se/pdf/cid_51.pdf |archivedate= 2011-10-04 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as such, the male gaze is comparable to [[scopophilia]], which is sexual pleasure derived from observing the passive female as object.&lt;ref name=mulvey1975/&gt;{{rp|815}}

== Background ==
The concept of the '''male gaze''' was first developed by the feminist film critic [[Laura Mulvey]] in the essay "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema" (1975), in which she proposes that an asymmetry of [[Power (social and political)|power]] between the sexes is a controlling force in cinema; and that the male gaze is constructed for the pleasure of the male viewer, which is deeply rooted in the ideologies and discourses of [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Weeks|first=L.

The perspective of the male gaze occurs when the camera places the viewer in the perspective of a heterosexual man whose sight lingers on the curves of a woman's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Streeter | first1 = Thomas | last2 = Hintlian | first2 = Nicole | last3 = Chipetz | first3 = Samantha | last4 = Callender | first4 = Susanna | title = This is Not Sex: A Web Essay on the Male Gaze, Fashion Advertising, and the Pose | url = http://www.uvm.edu/~tstreete/powerpose/index.html | date = 2005 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20111106152945/http://www.uvm.edu/~tstreete/powerpose/index.html | archivedate = 2011-11-06 | df =  }} Web essay about the male gaze in advertising.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the male gaze displays the woman on two different levels: (i) as an erotic object for the characters in the film story, and (ii) as an erotic object for the male viewer of the film.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} By way of the male gaze, the man emerges as the dominant power within the film fantasy, in which the woman is a passive object for the active gaze of the male viewer. The passive-object and active-viewer pairing is basic to the patriarchal order, and is typical in the "illusionistic narrative film" of mainstream cinema, where the male gaze has precedence over the female gaze — the underlying asymmetry of social and political power, between the sexes.&lt;ref name=mulvey1975/&gt;{{rp|14}}&lt;ref name="interview-mulvey-2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sassatelli | first = Roberta | title = Interview with Laura Mulvey: Gender, Gaze and Technology in Film Culture | journal = [[Theory, Culture &amp; Society]] | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 123–143 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0263276411398278 | date = September 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0263276411398278 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}}

This inequality can be attributed to patriarchy which has been defined as a social ideology embedded in the belief systems of Western culture and in patriarchal societies. It is either masculine individuals or institutions created by these individuals that exert the power to determine what is considered "natural".&lt;ref name="Privileging the Male Gaze"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pritchard | first1 = Annette | last2 = Morgan | first2 = Nigel J. | title = Privileging the male gaze: gendered tourism landscapes | journal = Annals of Tourism Research | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 884–905 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/S0160-7383(99)00113-9 | date = October 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0160-7383(99)00113-9 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of time, these constructed beliefs begin to seem "natural" or "normal" because they are prevalent and carry out unchallenged, thus arguing that Western culture has adopted a dyadic, hierarchical ideology which sets masculinity in binary opposition to femininity thus creating levels of inferiority.&lt;ref name="Privileging the Male Gaze"/&gt;

Mulvey describes its two central forms that are based in [[Freud]]'s concept of scopophilia, as: "pleasure that is linked to sexual attraction (voyeurism in extremis) and scopophilic pleasure that is linked to narcissistic identification (the introjection of ideal egos)",&lt;ref name=mulvey1975/&gt; in order to demonstrate how women have historically been forced to view film through the "male gaze". It also suggests that the male gaze denies women their human identity, relegating them to the status of objects to be admired for physical appearance and male sexual desires and fantasies.

In "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema", Mulvey discusses several different types of spectatorship that may occur while viewing a film. They can involve unconsciously or, in some cases, consciously engaging in the typical, ascribed societal roles of men and women.

In relation to [[phallocentrism]], films may be viewed in "three different looks"; the first refers to the camera as it records the actual events of the film, the second describes the nearly voyeuristic act of the audience as one engages in watching the film itself, and the third refers to the characters that interact with one another throughout the film. The main idea that seems to bring these actions together is that "looking" is generally seen as an active male role, while the passive role of being looked at is immediately adopted as a female characteristic. It is under the construction of patriarchy that Mulvey argues that women in film are tied to desire and that female characters hold an "appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact". The female actor is never meant to represent a character that directly affects the outcome of a plot or keep the story line going, but is inserted into the film as a way of supporting the male role and "bearing the burden of sexual objectification" that he cannot.&lt;ref name=mulvey1975/&gt;

In other words, the woman is passive to the active gaze from the man and can be linked to scopophilia (or scoptophilia), which can be described as pleasure derived from looking. As an expression of [[sexuality]], scopophilia refers to [[sexual pleasure]] derived from looking at erotic objects: erotic photographs, [[pornography]], naked bodies, etc. 
In sum, according to Mulvey, the categories of pleasurable viewing are twofold: voyeurism, which derives pleasure from viewing a distant other, and projecting one's fantasies, usually sexual, onto that person, and narcissism, a form of recognition of one's self in the image of another we are viewing. Mulvey also believes that in order to enjoy a film as a woman, or any gender other than male, we must learn to identify with the male protagonist.&lt;ref name=mulvey1975/&gt; [[Wendy Arons]] adds that [[sexualization|hypersexualization]] diminishes the symbolic threat posed by violent female characters in [[action film]]s, "The focus on the body—as a body in ostentatious display of breasts, legs, and buttocks—does mitigate the threat that women pose to 'the very fabric of... society' by reassuring the (male) viewer of his [[Male privilege|privilege]] as the possessor of the objectifying gaze."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Arons | first = Wendy | contribution = "If her stunning beauty doesn't bring you to your knees, her deadly drop kick will": violent women in Hong Kong Kung Fu film | editor-last1 = McCaughey | editor-first1 = Martha | editor-last2 = King | editor-first2 = Neal | editor-link1 = Martha McCaughey | title = Reel knockouts: violent women in the movies | page = 41 | location = Austin, Texas | publisher = University of Texas Press | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mulvey's essay also states that the female gaze is the same as the male gaze. This means that women look at themselves through the eyes of men.&lt;ref name="interview-mulvey-2011"/&gt; The male gaze may be seen by a [[feminist]] either as a manifestation of unequal power between gazer and gazed, or as a conscious or subconscious attempt to develop that [[Gender inequality|inequality]]. From this perspective, a woman who welcomes an objectifying gaze may be simply [[conforming]] to norms established to benefit men, thereby reinforcing the power of the gaze to reduce a recipient to an object. Welcoming such objectification may be viewed as akin to [[exhibitionism]].&lt;ref name="interview-mulvey-2011" /&gt;

Mulvey argues that "the male figure cannot bear the burden of sexual objectification. Man is reluctant to gaze". Describing ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]'' (1966), by [[Jean Rhys]], [[Nalini Paul]] indicates that the Antoinette character gazes at Rochester, placing a [[garland]] upon him, making him appear heroic: "Rochester does not feel comfortable with having this role enforced upon him; thus, he rejects it by removing the garland, and crushing the flowers."&lt;ref name="interview-mulvey-2011" /&gt;

From the male perspective, a man possesses the gaze because he is a man, whereas a woman has the gaze only when she assumes the male gazer role—when she objectifies others by gazing at them like a man. [[Eva-Maria Jacobsson]] supports Paul's description of the "female gaze" as "a mere cross-identification with masculinity", yet evidence of women's objectification of men—the discrete existence of a ''female gaze''—can be found in the "boy toy" ads published in [[teen magazines]], for example, despite Mulvey's contention that ''the gaze'' is ''property'' of one gender. Whether or not this is an example of female gaze or rather an internalized male gaze is up for debate, along with the other ideas on this subject. In terms of power relationships, the gazer can direct a gaze upon members of the same gender for [[asexuality|asexual]] reasons, such as comparing the gazer's [[body image]] and clothing to those of the gazed-at individual.&lt;ref  name="interview-mulvey-2011" /&gt;{{rp|127}}

With respect to her essay, Mulvey stressed in a 2011 interview with [[Roberta Sassatelli]]: "First, that the 1975 article "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema" was written as a [[polemic]], and as [[Mandy Merck]] has described it, as a manifesto; so I had no interest in modifying the argument. Clearly I think, in retrospect from a more nuanced perspective, about the inescapability of the male gaze."&lt;ref name="interview-mulvey-2011" /&gt;{{rp|128}}

[[Bracha Ettinger]] criticizes this notion of the male gaze by her proposition of a ''[[Matrixial Gaze|matrixial gaze]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ettinger | first = Bracha | author-link = Bracha Ettinger | title = The matrixial gaze | publisher = Feminist Arts and Histories Network, Department of Fine Art, University of Leeds | location = Leeds, UK | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780952489900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The matrixial gaze is not operative where a "male gaze" is placed opposite to a "female gaze" and where both positive entities constitute each other from a lack (such an umbrella concept of the gaze would precisely be what scholars such as [[Slavoj Žižek]] claim is the [[Lacan]]ian definition of "The Gaze"). Ettinger's proposal doesn't concern a subject and its object, existing or lacking. Rather, it concerns "trans-subjectivity" and shareability on a partial level, and it is based on her claim concerning a feminine-matrixial difference that escapes the phallic opposition of masculine/feminine and is produced in a process of co-emergence. Ettinger works from the very late Lacan, yet, from the angle she brings, it is the structure of the Lacanian subject itself that is deconstructed to a certain extent, and another kind of feminine dimension appears, with its hybrid and floating matrixial gaze.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ettinger | first = Bracha | author-link = Bracha Ettinger | contribution = The with-in-visible screen | editor-last = de Zegher | editor-first = M.

===''Ways of Seeing'': the Renaissance nude===
In the book ''[[Ways of Seeing]]'' (1972), John Berger addressed the subject of female [[sexual objectification]] in the arts, noting that "according to usage and conventions, which are at last being questioned, but have by no means been overcome — men act and women appear. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Berger | first = John | author-link = John Berger | contribution = Section 3 | editor-last = Berger | editor-first = John | editor-link = John Berger | title = Ways of seeing | pages = 45, 47 | publisher = [[BBC]] Penguin Books | location = London | year = 1973 | isbn = 9780563122449 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[mores|usages and conventions]] of observation relate the [[objectification|objectifying]] male gaze to Lacan's theory of the [[social alienation]] that results from the psychological split, between seeing one's self and seeing the ideal of one's self. In [[Italian Renaissance painting]], especially in the genre of the nude subject, that perceptual split arises from being both the viewer and the viewed, and from seeing one's self through the [[gaze]] of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Sturken | first1 = Marita | last2 = Cartwright | first2 = Lisa | contribution = Spectatorship, Power, and Knowledge | editor-last1 = Sturken | editor-first1 = Marita | editor-last2 = Cartwright | editor-first2 = Lisa | title = Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture | page = 81 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780198742715 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women and the gaze===
[[Griselda Pollock]], in her article, "Modernity and the Spaces of Femininity" argues that the female gaze can often be visually negated.&lt;ref name="Pollock-pp50-90"&gt;{{citation | last = Pollock | first = Griselda | author-link = Griselda Pollock | contribution = Modernity and the spaces for femininity | editor-last = Pollock | editor-first = Griselda | editor-link = Griselda Pollock | title = Vision and difference: femininity, feminism, and histories of art | pages = 50–90 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1988 | isbn = 9780415007214 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}

The spectator view of the picture is from inside the shop but the couple are looking in different places than the view of the spectator. The woman is commenting on an image to her husband, while the husband is being distracted by a nude female painting. The nude female painting is hung within view of the spectator. The woman is looking at another image, but it is out of view of the spectator. The man's gaze has found something more interesting and he has chosen to ignore the woman's comment. According to Pollock, "She is contrasted iconographically to the naked woman.  She is denied the picturing of her desire; what she looks at is blank for the spectator.  She is denied being the object of desire because she is represented as a woman who actively looks, rather than returning and confirming the gaze of the masculine spectator".&lt;ref name="Pollock-pp50-90" /&gt;

Lorraine Gamman has suggested that a female gaze can be distinguished from that of a male through its displacing of [[Scopophilia|scopophilic]] power, not simply the inversion of the male gaze, which creates the possibility of a multiplicity of viewing angles. In fact, for Gamman, "the female gaze cohabits the space occupied by men, rather than being entirely divorced from it".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Gamman | first = Lorraine | contribution = Watching the detectives: the enigma of the female gaze | editor-last1 = Gamman | editor-first1 = Lorraine | editor-last2 = Marshment | editor-first2 = Margaret | title = The Female gaze: women as viewers of popular culture | page = 16 | publisher = Real Comet Press | location = Seattle | year = 1989 | isbn = 9780941104425 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for Gamman, the role of the female gaze is not to appropriate the traditional male form of "voyeurism;" its purpose is to disrupt the [[Phallocentric]] power of the male gaze by providing for other modes of looking.

[[Jay David Bolter]] and [[Richard Grusin]] suggest that Mulvey's "male gaze" coincides with "the desire for visual immediacy", the erasure of the medium for uninhibited interaction with the object portrayed, which feminist film theorists treat as "a male desire that takes an overt sexual meaning when the object of representation, and therefore desire, is a woman".&lt;ref name="Remediation"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Bolter | first1 = Jay David | last2 = Grusin | first2 = Richard | contribution = Networks of remediation | editor-last1 = Bolter | editor-first1 = Jay David | editor-last2 = Grusin | editor-first2 = Richard | title = Remediation understanding new media | pages = 64–87 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780262024525 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}} However, Bolter and Grusin consider their term "hypermediacy", the drawing of attention to the medium (or media) and the mediating processes present in a work, to be a manifestation of Gamman's female gaze because it "is multiple and deviant in its suggestion of multiplicity—a multiplicity of viewing positions and a multiplicity of relationships to the object in view, including sexual objects".&lt;ref name="Remediation" /&gt;{{rp|84}} According to Bolter and Grusin, then, hypermediacy, much like the female gaze, works to disrupt the myopic and monolithic male gaze by offering more angles of viewing.

At the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, [[Jill Soloway]], in her keynote address, tried to define the "female gaze" in film-making (available on YouTube).

The Indian photographer [[Farhat Basir Khan]] attributes the female gaze to anything that's been photographed by a woman which according to Khan is actually breaking the stereotypical view created by "male-constructed" photographs that have shown women in a certain light throughout the history of visual arts. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From her perspective|url=http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/From-her-perspective/article16988924.ece|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=30 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180602070404/http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/From-her-perspective/article16988924.ece|archivedate=2 June 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of female gaze was central to the exhibition curated by Khan titled 'Feminography' at the [[Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts]] in January 2017.

=== Oppositional gaze ===
[[bell hooks]], in her essay titled "The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectatorship",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminism and Visual Cultural Reader.|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=Amelia Jones|year=|isbn=|location=New York: Routledge, 2003|pages=94–105|chapter=The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectator|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that Black women are placed outside of the "pleasure in looking" as an imaginary subject to the male gaze.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In reading [[Laura Mulvey|Mulvey]]'s essay "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media and Cultural Studies: Keywords|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|publisher=Meenakshi Gigi Durham and Douglas Kellner|year=|isbn=|location=2001; Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2006|pages=342–352|chapter=Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; hooks states,"...from a standpoint that acknowledges race, one sees clearly why black women spectators not duped by mainstream cinema would develop an oppositional gaze".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In relation [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]'s [[mirror stage]], during which a child develops self recognition and thus, the [[Ego ideal|ideal ego]], hooks takes up the oppositional gaze as a form of looking back, in search of the Black female body within the idealization of cinematic white womanhood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The absence of racial relations in the context of feminist theory around the "totalizing category [of] women" engages in a process of denial which refutes the reality that many feminist film critics structure their discourse around white women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a working-class Black woman interviewed by hooks replied, "to see black women in the position white women have occupied in film forever...", is to see a 'transfer' without 'transformation'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The oppositional gaze, therefore, encompasses resistance as well as an understanding and awareness of the politics of race and racism via cinematic whiteness inclusive of the male gaze.&lt;!-- any commentary on ''La Dame Indignee''? --&gt;

'''Maoism (Third Worldism)''' (often stylized as '''Maoism–Third Worldism''' or simply '''MTW'''), not to be confused with [[Third Worldism]] generally, is a broad tendency which is mainly concerned with the infusion and [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]] of [[Marxism]]—particularly of the [[Marxism–Leninism–Maoism|Marxist–Leninist–Maoist]] persuasion—with concepts of non-Marxist [[Third Worldism]], namely [[dependency theory]] and [[world-systems theory]]. 

There is no general consensus on part of Maoist-Third Worldists as a whole. However, the majority of proponents typically argue for the centrality of [[anti-imperialism]] to the victory of global [[communist revolution]], as well as against the idea that the working class in the "First World" is majority-[[Exploitation of labour|exploited]] (sometimes arguing that it experiences no exploitation at all), and therefore, it is not a part of the international  [[proletariat]].

In academic discourse, Maoism (Third-Worldism) is sometimes synonymous with ''dependency theory'' or ''Dependencism''.

== Theory ==

Maoism (Third Worldism) is defined, theoretically, by a variety of political principles which emphasize the enormous economic, social and political divisions which exist currently between the "overdeveloped" First World and the "underdeveloped" Third World. This is expressed through the lens of [[Maoism|Maoist]] theory and practice, but brought into a new international understanding of imperialism and class in the context of the world which has been divided into two distinct camps: the exploited countries (the Third World) and their exploiters (the First World).

According to the [[Revolutionary Anti-Imperialist Movement]] (RAIM), on the question of the principal theoretical observations of Maoism (Third Worldism) they state: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Confronted by a complacent working class, served by an opportunist left, and alienated from the proletariat through the reception of surplus value drained from the Third World, we must understand the ideological and strategic implications of struggle from within the parasitic core. It benefits neither the left in the oppressor or the oppressed nations to pretend that the condition of the working class around the world is the same... To be a Third Worldist, in our view, is to be a principled internationalist."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.revaim.org/about/|title=What is RAIM?|last=|first=|date=|website=Revaim.org|publisher=Revolutionary Anti-Imperialist Movement|access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Global People's War ===
However the foundations of Maoism (Third Worldism) extend to encapsulate a great many strategic and theoretical developments in Marxist theory over the 20th century. Among them is the understanding of "Global People's War" being necessary as a military strategy for bringing an end to the historically unequal relationship built between the First and Third Worlds. This strategy includes the systematic "de-linking" of the exploited economies of Third World countries from the parasitic First World, and the unification of international forces to deprive the imperialist countries of resources and wealth extracted from Third World countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://anti-imperialism.org/2014/05/17/points-of-unity-and-difference-regarding-global-peoples-war/|title=Points of Unity and Difference Regarding Global People's War|last=|first=|date=|website=Anti-Imperialism.org|publisher=Revolutionary Anti-Imperialist Movement|access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though this strategy has been drawn from several historical sources, such as [[Che Guevara|Che Guevara's]] ''Message to the Tri-Continental'', it has most famously drawn on a quote from [[Lin Biao|Lin Biao's]] speech ''Long Live the Victory of People's War!'' in 1965:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Taking the entire globe, if North America and Western Europe can be called 'the cities of the world', then Asia, Africa and Latin America constitute 'the rural areas of the world'. Since World War II, the proletarian revolutionary movement has for various reasons been temporarily held back in the North American and West European capitalist countries, while the people’s revolutionary movement in Asia, Africa and Latin America has been growing vigorously. In a sense, the contemporary world revolution also presents a picture of the encirclement of cities by the rural areas. In the final analysis, the whole cause of world revolution hinges on the revolutionary struggles of the Asian, African and Latin American peoples who make up the overwhelming majority of the world’s population. The socialist countries should regard it as their internationalist duty to support the people’s revolutionary struggles in Asia, Africa and Latin America."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/lin-biao/1965/09/peoples_war/ch07.htm|title=Long Live the Victory of People's War|last=Lin|first=Biao|date=September 3, 1965|website=Marxists.org|publisher=Foreign Languages Press|access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Joint-Dictatorship of the Proletariat of Oppressed Nations ===
Fundamental, as well, to Maoism (Third Worldism) is an understanding of the "Joint-Dictatorship of the Proletariat of Oppressed Nations" (JDPON) and/or "Global [[New Democracy|New Democratic]] Revolution" (GNDR) which is proposed as a form of "[[alter-globalization]]" aimed at breaking the political and economic foundations of the economic parasitism between the First and Third Worlds. The JDPON is a point of relative contention between the various proponents of Maoism (Third Worldism) or at least the tendencies which have now been named as falling generally under the "Third Worldist" tendency within Marxism. The Revolutionary Anti-Imperialist Movement, in their cardinal principles, describes the JDPON as: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The necessary political strategy for world revolution to accompany the GPPW must result in the establishment of a Joint-Dictatorship of the Proletariat of Oppressed Nations (JDPON). Throughout the history of world imperialism there has been a massive accumulation of wealth in the core imperialist countries of the First World. We understand that to move forward in the hope of Communism without reconciling the vast division of wealth and labor between the First and Third Worlds can only produce social imperialism; Communism cannot be built over the hoards of stolen wealth in the core, to advance this contradiction must be resolved. To resolve this, and to sew together those movements who should coalesce in the global strategy of Global Protracted People’s War, we must have a Global New Democratic Revolution, in which a coalition toward the alter-globalization of the world is formed from the cooperation of the Proletarian and Progressive states of the oppressed countries, under the leadership of the Proletariat, to guide the revolutionary forces toward the defeat of imperialism. As well, to promote revolutionary consciousness and catalyze the development toward the JDPON: the global settling of accounts through which the means of production of the core countries are internationalized and their wealth is redistributed to those countries which have been historically robbed. It is through this process of JDPON that the contradiction between oppressor/oppressed nations is resolved and the oppressor countries are integrated into the world socialist project."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.revaim.org/members/cardinal-principles/|title=RAIM Cardinal Principles|last=|first=|date=|website=Revaim.org|publisher=Revolutionary Anti-Imperialist Movement|access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, the JDPON has also existed for quite a while longer than the Revolutionary Anti-Imperialist Movement, and was first formalized in its contemporary form by the [[Maoist Internationalist Movement]] in their article on the [[Dictatorship of the proletariat|Dictatorship of the Proletariat]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Because there is no exploited white working class in North Amerika, MIM favors the joint dictatorship of the proletariat of the oppressed nations (JDPON). This amounts to putting u.$. imperialism into receivership by something like a proletarian United Nations. The whole dictatorship of the proletariat idea or its current form required as JDPON is a strategy for advance from capitalism toward communism, in which dictatorship is only a stage existing until certain tasks eliminating classes are done."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prisoncensorship.info/archive/etext/faq/dictp.html|title="What is the dictatorship of the proletariat?"|last=|first=|date=|website=Prisoncensorship.info|publisher=Maoist Internationalist Movement|access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Organisations ==

The Maoist (Third Worldist) movement is currently mostly associated with organizations such as the Revolutionary Anti-Imperialist Movement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.revaim.org|title=Revolutionary Anti-Imperialist Movement|last=|first=|date=|website=Revaim.org|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Maoist Internationalist Ministry of Prisons,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prisoncensorship.info|title=The Maoist Internationalist Movement Ministry of Prisons|last=|first=|date=|website=prisoncensorship.info|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a branch-off from the Maoist Internationalist Movement, a now defunct organisation). Although MIM Prisons considers its ideology to be "MIM Thought", not Maoist (Third Worldist). The Communist Party of the Latin American and Caribbean Diaspora, also called "Anticonquista", considers itself a Third Worldist organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anticonquista.com/about-us|title=Anticonquista|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
The documents called "placiti" (''placito'' means judge's opinion) are a group of four [[parchments]] and were discovered by Erasmo Gattola in the benedectine monastery of [[Monte Cassino]], about 130&amp;nbsp;kilometres (81&amp;nbsp;mi) southeast of [[Rome]], in the 1700s. The documents are a resolution of a dispute on the property of several lands located in the Italian cities of [[Capua]], [[Sessa Aurunca]] and [[Teano]], between three monasteries owned by [[Monte Cassino]] and Rodelgrimo d'Aquino, a local landowner. With these documents, after the deposition of three witnesses, the judge clearly stated that the three monasteries were the legitimate owners of the lands.&lt;ref name="altervista"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://veranigrisoli.altervista.org/Testo%20placiti_cassinesi.htm|title=PLACITI CASSINESI|publisher=veranigrisoli.altervista.org|accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rahul Sankrityayan''' (9 April 1893 – 14 April 1963), is called the ''Father of Hindi Travelogue [[Travel literature]]''. He is the one who played a pivotal role to give travelogue a 'literature form', was one of the most widely travelled scholars of [[India]], spending forty-five years of his life on travels away from his home.&lt;ref name="Sharma2009"&gt;{{cite book| first = R.S.| last = Sharma| authorlink = | title = [[Rethinking India's Past]]| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2009| isbn = 978-0-19-569787-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He travelled to many places and wrote many travelogue approximately in the same ratio. He is also famously known for his authentic description about his travels experiences, for instance- in his travelogue "Meri Laddakh Yatra" he presents overall regional, historical and cultural specificity of that region judiciously. He became a Buddhist monk (''Bauddha [[Bhikkhu]]'') and eventually took up [[Marxist Socialism]].&lt;ref name="Sharma2009" /&gt; Sankrityayan was also an Indian nationalist, having been arrested and jailed for three years for creating anti-British writings and speeches.&lt;ref name="Sharma2009" /&gt; He is referred to as the 'Greatest Scholar' (''Mahapandit'') for his scholarship.&lt;ref name="Sharma2009" /&gt; He was both a [[polymath]] as well as a [[polyglot]].&lt;ref name="Sharma2009" /&gt; The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of the [[Padma Bhushan]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf | title=Padma Awards | publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India | date=2015 | accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood==
He was born as Kedarnath Pandey in a poor [[Bhumihar Brahmin]] family on 9 April 1893 in Pandaha village, [[Azamgarh]] district, in Eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="Machwe1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Prabhakar Machwe|title=Rahul Sankrityayan (Hindi Writer)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kPPlgMiM388C&amp;pg=PA12|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-7201-845-0|pages=12–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received formal schooling at a local primary school, though he later studied and mastered numerous languages independently, as well as the art of photography.

==Philosophy of his Life==
In his initial days he was a keen follower of [[Arya Samaj]] of Swami [[Dayananda Saraswati]]. Buddhism came to him and changed his life. He lost faith in God's existence but still retained faith in reincarnation. Later he moved towards Marxist Socialism and rejected the concepts of reincarnation and afterlife also. The two volumes of ''Darshan-Digdarshan'', the collected history of World's Philosophy give an indication of his philosophy when we find the second volume much dedicated to [[Dharmakirti]]'s [[Pramanavarttika|Pramana Vartika]]. This he discovered in Tibetan translation from Tibet.

==Travels==
Sankrityayan's travels took him to different parts of India including [[Ladakh]], [[Kinnaur]], and [[Kashmir]]. He also travelled to several other countries including [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Iran]], China, and the former [[Soviet Union]]. He spent several years in the "Parsa Gadh" village in the [[Saran district]] in [[Bihar]]. The village's entry gate is named "Rahul Gate". While travelling, he mostly used surface transport, and he went to certain countries clandestinely; he entered Tibet as a [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]]. He made several trips to Tibet and brought valuable paintings and [[Pāli|Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] [[manuscript]]s back to India. Most of these were a part of the libraries of [[Vikramshila]] and [[Nalanda]] Universities. These objects had been taken to Tibet by fleeing [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] during the twelfth and subsequent centuries when the invading Muslim armies had destroyed universities in India. Some accounts state that Rahul Sankrityayan employed twenty-two mules to bring these materials from Tibet to India. [[Patna Museum]], [[Patna]], has a special section of these materials in his honour, where a number of these and other items have been displayed.

==Books==
Sankrityayan was a [[polyglot]], well versed in several [[language]]s and [[dialect]]s, including [[Hindi]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Pāli|Pali]], [[Bhojpuri]], [[Urdu]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Kannada]], [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]], French and Russian.&lt;ref name="Sharma2009" /&gt; He was also an [[Indologist]], a [[Marxist]] theoretician, and a creative writer.&lt;ref name="Sharma2009" /&gt; He started writing during his twenties and his works, totalling well over 100, covered a variety of subjects, including sociology, history, philosophy, [[Buddhism]], [[Tibetology]], [[lexicography]], [[grammar]], textual editing, [[folklore]], science, drama, and politics.&lt;ref name="Sharma2009" /&gt; Many of these were unpublished.&lt;ref name="Sharma2009" /&gt; He translated [[Majjhima Nikaya]] from [[Prakrit]] into [[Hindi]].&lt;ref name="Sharma2009" /&gt;

[[File:Rahulji's Tombstone.jpg|thumb|Rahul's Tombstone at [[Darjeeling]].This tombstone is established at a place called "Murda Haati" which is a cremation ground downtown in the lower altitudes of Darjeeling around 25 minutes drive from the ChowRasta.The same place also has the tombstone of [[Sister Nivedita]].]]

One of his most famous books in Hindi is ''[[Volga Se Ganga]]'' (''A journey from the [[Volga river|Volga]] to the [[Ganges]]'') – a work of historical fiction concerning the migration of [[Aryan]]s from the [[steppe]]s of the [[Eurasia]] to regions around the [[Volga river]]; then their movements across the [[Hindukush]] and the [[Himalaya]]s and the sub-Himalayan regions; and their spread to the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]s of the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent of India]]. The book begins in 6000&amp;nbsp;BC and ends in 1942, the year when [[Mahatma Gandhi]], the Indian nationalist leader called for the [[Quit India|quit India movement]]. It was published in 1942. A translation into English of this work by Victor Kiernan was published in 1947 as ''From Volga to Ganga''.&lt;ref&gt;Rahul Sankrityayana ''[https://archive.org/details/VolgaToGanga-English From Volga to Ganga]'', Rahula Publication, Mussorie, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated by K.N. Muthiya-Tamilputhakalayam in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as ''Valgavil irundu gangai varai'' and is still considered a best-seller. The Kannada translation done by B.N Sharma as "Volga Ganga" . The Telugu translation (Volga nunchi Ganga ku) inspired many readers. ''Volga muthal Ganga vare'', the Malayalam translation, became immensely popular among the young intellectuals of Kerala and it continues to be one of the most influential books of its times. The [[Bengali language|Bengali]] version is ''Volga Theke Ganga'' [ভল্গা থেকে গঙ্গা], which is still acclaimed by the critics. 

His most important travelogue literature is- "Tibbat me Sava varsha(1933), "Meri Europe Yatra" (1935), "Athato Ghumakkad Jigyasa", "Volga se Ganga", "Asia ke Durgam Bhukhando Mein", "Yatra Ke Panne" and "Kinnar Desh Mein".

More than ten of his books have been translated and published in [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. ''Mahapandit'' was awarded the [[Padmabhushan]] in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Padma Awards Directory (1954–2013)|publisher=[[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]], Government of India|url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he received the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] in 1958 for his book ''Madhya Asia ka Itihaas''.

He maintained daily diaries in Sanskrit which were used fully while writing his autobiography. In spite of profound scholarship, he wrote in very simple Hindi that a common person could follow. He wrote books of varied interest. He was aware of limitations of Hindi literature and singularly made up the loss in no small measure.

The historian [[K.P. Jayaswal|Kashi Prasad Jayaswal]] compared Rahul Sankrityayan with Buddha. Rahul's personality was as impressive and memorable as are his achievements. He traveled widely and wrote in five languages – Hindi, Sanskrit, Bhojpuri, Pāli and Tibetan. His published works span a range of genres, which include autobiography, biography, travelogue, sociology, history, philosophy, Buddhism, Tibetology, lexicography, grammar, text editing, folklore, science, fiction, drama, essays, politics, and pamphleteering.

==Soviet Union==
Although he had little formal education, in view of his knowledge and command over the subject, [[Saint Petersburg State University|University of Leningrad]] appointed him Professor of [[Indology]] in 1937–38 and again in 1947–48.

==Contributions==
Many of Rahul's personal collections including the ones he gathered from his multiple trips to Tibet were distributed across to multiple Universities and Museums.
Patna Museum has an extensive collection of Buddhist scrolls which he assimilated through his journeys across Tibet.Many of these are rare gems of Indian scriptures translated into Tibetan.

==Personal life and family==

Rahul was married when very young and never came to know anything of his child-wife, Santoshi.Probably he saw her only once in his 40s as per his autobiography:Meri Jivan Yatra. 
During his stay in Soviet Russia a second time, accepting an invitation for teaching Buddhism at Leningrad University, he came in contact with a Mongolian scholar Lola (Ellena Narvertovna Kozerovskaya). She could speak French, English, and Russian and write Sanskrit. She helped him in working on Tibetan- Sanskrit dictionary. Their attachment ended in marriage and birth of son Igor. Mother and son were not allowed to accompany Rahul to India after completion of his assignment. It was Stalin's Russia.

Late in life, he married Dr. Kamala, an Indian Nepali lady and had a daughter (Jaya), two sons (Jeta) and (Jayant) .

==Death==
Rahul accepted a teaching job at a Sri Lankan University, where he fell seriously ill. Diabetes, high blood pressure and a mild stroke struck him. Most tragic happening was the loss of memory. He breathed his last in [[Darjeeling]] in 1963.

His last residence at Darjeeling was at 21 Kacheri Road: Rahul Nivas.

[[File:EscorialBiblioteca.jpg|thumb|270px|Interior of the library of el Escorial, where the manuscript of ''Relación breve de la conquista de la Nueva España'' is kept.]]
'''''Relación breve de la conquista de la Nueva España''''' ({{lang-en|Short Account of the Conquest of New Spain}}) is the account of friar [[Francisco de Aguilar (conquistador)|Francisco de Aguilar]], who in his youth took part in the [[conquest of Mexico|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] as a [[conquistador]] under the command of [[Hernán Cortés]].

According to the introduction by the author, the account was written after Aguilar had joined the [[Dominican Order]], at a time in which he would have been more than 80 years old, between 1559 and 1571. Following the death of Francisco de Aguilar, the manuscript came into the possession of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] and the [[Archbishop of Mexico|Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico]] [[Pedro Moya de Contreras]], who then gave it to [[Philip II of Spain]]. Since then, the ''Relación breve de la conquista de la Nueva España'' has been held along with other 16th century manuscripts in the library of the [[El Escorial|Royal Site of San Lorenzo de El Escorial]]. The manuscript survived a fire in the library that occurred on 7 June 1671.

== Publication History ==
In 1892, the Mexican historian [[Francisco del Paso y Troncoso]], managed to obtain a copy of “Relación breve de la conquista de la Nueva España”. This same copy was then used by fellow Mexican historian [[Luis González Obregón]], who included it in his ''Anales del Museo nacional de México, t.VIII (1ª.época ), entrega 1ª.,'', under the title ''Historia de la Nueva España'' ({{lang-en|History of New Spain}}), in June 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seg.guanajuato.gob.mx/Proyectos/innovacion/proyectos/PAGINALUISGO/PAGINAS/BIOGRAFIA.htm Semblanza y obras de González Obregón] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915092806/http://www.seg.guanajuato.gob.mx/Proyectos/innovacion/proyectos/PAGINALUISGO/PAGINAS/BIOGRAFIA.htm |date=2008-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text was modernized by [[Alfonso Teja Zabre]], and released under the title ''Historia de la Nueva España'', in November 1937. The editor refers to Francisco de Aguilar as Alonso de Aguilar; because according to Mexican historian [[José Luis Martínez Rodríguez|José Luis Martínez]], Aguilar changed his name when he joined the Dominican Order.&lt;ref&gt;Martínez, 2005; 149&lt;/ref&gt; This edition was republished in 1938 by the publisher Botas. En 1943, the publisher Vargas Rea again republished the work, this time under the title ''Relato breve de la conquista de la Nueva España'' .

In 1954 [[Federico Gómez de Orozco]] headed the publication of a new edition featuring an essay by Father Mariano Gutiérrez and a biography of the author written by [[Agustín Dávila Padilla]]. The edition was published under the title ''Relación breve de la conquista de la Nueva España, escrita por fray Francisco de Aguilar, de la orden de predicadores'' ({{lang-en|Short History of Conquest of New Spain, Written by Friar Francisco de Aguilar, of the Order of Preachers}}) by the publisher José Porrúa e hijos.

In 1963, the edition by Gómez de Orozco was translated into English and published by Orion Press under the title ''The Chronicle of Fray Francisco de Aguilar'', with a preface by Howard D. Cline.

In 1977, [[Jorge Gurría Lacroix]] included a facsimile of the original manuscript, the introductions of past editions, and a preliminary academic study, under the name ''Relación breve de la conquista de la Nueva España'', in the collection ''Serie de historiadores y cronistas de Indias'' no.7, [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]].

In 2002, Germán Vázquez Chamorro, released a compilation entitled ''Conquista de Tenochtitlan'' ({{lang-en|The Conquest of Tenochtitlan}}), which includes ''“Relación breve de la conquista de la Nueva España”''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9768">A '''sound bite''' is a short clip of speech or music extracted from a longer piece of audio, often used to promote or exemplify the full length piece. In the context of [[journalism]], a sound bite is characterized by a short phrase or sentence that captures the essence of what the speaker was trying to say, and is used to summarize information and entice the reader or viewer. The term was coined by the [[Media in the United States|U.S. media]] in the 1970s. Since then, [[politician]]s have increasingly employed sound bites to summarize their positions.

Due to its brevity, the sound bite often overshadows the broader [[Context (language use)|context]] in which it was spoken, and can be misleading or inaccurate. The insertion of sound bites into news broadcasts or documentaries is open to [[Media manipulation|manipulation]], leading to conflict over [[journalistic ethics]].

== History ==

In the 1960s and 1970s, pressure from [[Advertising|advertisers]] on the [[Television in the United States|American television industry]] to create entertaining news material made sound bites central to political coverage. Politicians began to use [[Public relations|PR]] techniques to craft self-images and slogans that would resonate with the television-viewing audience and ensure their victory in campaigns.&lt;ref name="KazinEdwards2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Kazin|author2=Rebecca Edwards|author3=Adam Rothman|title=The Concise Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7hScNkRpePoC&amp;pg=PA401|date=21 August 2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-15207-3|page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "sound bite" was coined in the late 1970s, several years before the presidency of [[Ronald Reagan]], who was famous for short, memorable phrases like, "[[Mikhail Gorbachev|Mr. Gorbachev]], [[tear down this wall]]!" in reference to the [[Berlin Wall]].&lt;ref name="SujanskyFerri-Reed2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joanne Sujansky|author2=Jan Ferri-Reed|title=Keeping The Millennials: Why Companies Are Losing Billions in Turnover to This Generation- and What to Do About It|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t5oZi_7kZ1AC&amp;pg=PT174|date=2 June 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-43851-0|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1988 United States presidential election]], candidate [[Michael Dukakis]] highlighted the prominent role of sound bites and [[spin doctors]] in political campaigns by running a commercial that mocked contender [[George H.W. Bush]]'s handlers' frustration over the [[gaffe]]s of his vice presidential running-mate [[Dan Quayle]].&lt;ref name="Dahlgren1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Dahlgren|title=Communication and Citizenship: Journalism and the Public Sphere|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KrR1YMHi8ZwC&amp;pg=PA122|date=12 November 1993|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-10067-0|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journalism ==

In journalism, sound bites are used to summarize the position of the speaker, as well as to increase the interest of the reader or viewer in the piece. In both [[print journalism|print]] and [[broadcast journalism]], sound bites are conventionally juxtaposed and interspersed with commentary from the journalist to create a [[news story]]. A balanced news report is expected to contain sound bites representing both sides of the debate.&lt;ref name="Butler2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy G. Butler|title=Television: Critical Methods and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7rWFRLVyvY0C&amp;pg=PA233|accessdate=4 August 2012|date=8 September 2006|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-8058-5415-2|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique, however, can lead to [[bias]]ed reporting when a sound bite is selected for [[sensationalism]], or is used to promote the point of view of one individual or group over another.&lt;ref name="Wilkins2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilkins|title=Handbook of Media Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0fJYkdSufLYC&amp;pg=PA111|date=21 July 2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-8058-6191-4|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==

In his book ''The Sound Bite Society'', Jeffrey Scheuer argues that the sound bite was the product of [[television]]'s increased power over all forms of communication, and that the resulting trend toward short, catchy snippets of information had a significant negative impact on American political discourse.&lt;ref name="Scheuer2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Scheuer|title=The Sound Bite Society: How Television Helps the Right and Hurts the Left|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5V7zPPKx_o0C|date=2 November 2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-93662-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Peggy Noonan]] feels that sound bites have acquired a negative connotation but are not inherently negative, and that what we now think of as great historical sound bites&amp;mdash;such as "[[The only thing we have to fear is fear itself]]", the most famous phrase in [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s first [[Inaugural Address]]&amp;mdash;were examples of eloquent speakers unselfconsciously and "simply trying in words to capture the essence of the thought they wished to communicate."&lt;ref name="Noonan1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peggy Noonan|title=On Speaking Well|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CvDSoc9CL0AC&amp;pg=PA93|date=1 March 1999|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-098740-4|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased use of sound bites in news media has been criticized, and has led to discussions on [[journalistic ethics|journalistic]] and [[media ethics]].&lt;ref name="Berry2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Berry|title=Journalism, Ethics and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZ8YvkBUCPYC&amp;pg=PA28|date=15 December 2008|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-4780-5|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Code of Ethics]] of the [[Society of Professional Journalists]], journalists should "make certain that headlines, news teases and promotional material, photos, video, audio, graphics, sound bites and quotations do not misrepresent. They should not oversimplify or highlight incidents out of context." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icij.org/Content.aspx?context=about&amp;topic=ethics&amp;id=705|title=The Center for Public Integrity-Journalistic Ethics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this criticism, sound bites are widely employed by businesses, trade groups, labor unions and politicians.  Senator Jim DeMint readily admitted this when he said, "There’s a reason why most politicians talk in sanitized sound bites: Once you get out of that, you’re opening yourself up to get attacked." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/84001.html?hp=t1|title=GOP plots to prevent more Akins|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9210">'''Speaking truth to power''' is a [[non-violent]] political tactic, employed by [[dissidents]] against the [[received wisdom]] or [[propaganda]] of governments they regard as oppressive, [[authoritarian]] or an [[ideocracy]]. The phrase may have originated with a pamphlet 'Speak truth to power: a Quaker Search for an Alternative to Violence', published in 1955. Speak Truth To Power is also the title of a global [[Human Rights]] initiative under the auspices of [[Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights]]. Practitioners who have campaigned for a more just and truthful world have included [[Vaclav Havel]]&lt;ref&gt;Havel, Václav; et al. (1985). Keane, John, ed. The Power of the Powerless: Citizens against the state in central-eastern Europe. Armonk, NY: M. E. Sharpe. {{ISBN|0-87332-761-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]], the [[Dalai Lama]] and [[Elie Wiesel]].&lt;ref&gt;Nan Richardson (ed), [[Kerry Kennedy]] and [[Eddie Adams (photographer)|Eddie Adams]], 'Speak Truth to Power', Umbrage, 2003, introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==

In [[classical Greece]] 'speaking truth to power' was known as [[parrhesia]]. The tactic is similar to [[Satyagraha]] (literally, 'truth-force') which was used by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in seeking independence from [[British India]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]], [[The Anatomy of Power]], Hamish Hamilton 1983, p 89&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Albert O. Hirschman]], writing in the 1970s, suggested that subordinates have three options; [[Exit, Voice, and Loyalty]].&lt;ref&gt;Gill Corkindale, 'The Price of (Not) speaking Truth to Power', [[Harvard Business Review]], 21/7/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Michel Foucault]] writing in 1983, only the courageous may pursue the truth-to-power course; they risk losing their friends, (as [[Winston Churchill]] did in the 1930s&lt;ref&gt;[[John Baldoni]], 'Churchill and Orwell; speaking truth to power' , [[Forbes Magazine]], 28/6/2017&lt;/ref&gt;) their liberty, even their lives ( [[Liu Xiaobo]]&lt;ref&gt;James A. Dorn, 'What Liu Xiaobo's grisly prison death tells us about free speech in China', [[Newsweek]], 18/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, Fearless Speech, 1983, p 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noam Chomsky]] is dismissive of 'speaking truth to power'. He asserts that 'power knows the truth already, and is busy concealing it'. It is the oppressed who need to hear the truth, not the oppressors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terry Eagleton]], 'The Truth Speakers', New Statesman, 3/4/2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

[[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]]&lt;ref&gt;Anon, 'Speaking Truth to Power', [[The Economist]], 7/8/2008&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andrei Sakharov]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Serge Schmemann]], 'The moral clarity of Andrei Sakharov', [[Hoover Institution]], 7/10/2015&lt;/ref&gt; are among those who suffered for speaking out against the USSR. In 1936, Japanese finance minister [[Takahashi Korekiyo]] was assassinated after suggesting that Japan could not afford its planned military buildup.&lt;ref&gt;S.C.M.Paine, The Japanese Empire,  [[Cambridge University Press]], 2017, p101&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] in Nazi Germany, and [[Martin Luther King]] in the US, were people who lost their lives for speaking truth to power.&lt;ref&gt;James Deotis Roberts, Bonhoeffer and King: Speaking Truth To Power, [[Westminster John Knox Press]], 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The former world heavyweight boxing champion [[Muhammad Ali]] was jailed in the 1960s for refusing to be drafted to the [[Vietnam war]], saying; 'No Vietcong ever called me nigger...I have no quarrel with the Vietnamese people.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Rabbi Michael Lerner]], 'Be Muhammad Ali today - speak truth to power', memorial speech, The Journalist, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vaclav Havel]] in his ''Power of the Powerless'' essay wrote: "The post-totalitarian system touches people at every step, but it does so with its ideological gloves on. This is why life in the system is so thoroughly permeated with hypocrisy and lies: government by bureaucracy is called popular government; the working class is enslaved in the name of the working class; the complete degradation of the individual is presented as his ultimate liberation; depriving people of information is called making it available; the use of power to manipulate is called the public control of power, and the arbitrary abuse of power is called observing the legal code; the repression of culture is called its development; the expansion of imperial influence is presented as support for the oppressed; the lack of free expression becomes the highest form of freedom; farcical elections become the highest form of democracy; banning independent thought becomes the most scientific of world views; military occupation becomes fraternal assistance. Because the regime is captive to its own lies, it must falsify everything. It falsifies the past. It falsifies the present, and it falsifies the future. It falsifies statistics".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/resource/the-power-of-the-powerless/&lt;/ref&gt;

Ex-[[GCHQ]] employee [[Katharine Gun]] was threatened with prosecution for exposing an alleged conspiracy to bug [[United Nations]] delegates prior to the [[Iraq invasion of 2003]]. Together with [[Daniel Ellsburg]], [[Coleen Rowley]] and [[Sibel Edmonds]], she set up the [[Truth-telling Coalition]] to encourage more of their former colleagues to ‘tell truth to power’.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Bright]], ‘What happened to the Woman who revealed dirty tricks on the UN Iraq War vote?’, [[The Guardian]], 2nd March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katharine Gun, ‘The Truth Must Out’, [[The Guardian]], 18 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==In education==
The reverend Nick Mercer, an assistant chaplain at [[Sherborne School]], believes that [[Human Rights]] and morality should be taught in all schools. Mercer, who gave evidence on mistreatment of detainees in Iraq, once served as a military lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Garner]], 'Iraq abuse whistleblower Nick Mercer; 'Schools must teach speaking truth to power'.', Independent, 25/12/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Vaclav Havel]], politics should not be ignored because it attracts bad people. It follows that politics requires people of exceptional purity, higher sensitivity, taste, tact and responsibility. ‘Those who say that politics is disreputable help make it so… Those who claim that politics is a dirty business are lying to us.’  &lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Garton Ash]], [[History of the Present]], Penguin, 2000, p 162-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Foucault]] spoke and wrote about [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/ power] and [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0952695102015001074 oppression] by examining how "technologies of power and knowledge have, since antiquity, intertwined and developed in concrete and historical frameworks"&lt;ref&gt;Power/knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972-1977&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Paulo Freire]] in his seminal work ''[[Pedagogy_of_the_Oppressed|Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'' explains how "oppression has been justified and how it is reproduced through a mutual process between the "oppressor" and the "oppressed" (oppressors–oppressed distinction). Freire admits that the powerless in society can be frightened of freedom. He writes, "Freedom is acquired by conquest, not by gift. It must be pursued constantly and responsibly. Freedom is not an ideal located outside of man; nor is it an idea which becomes myth. It is rather the indispensable condition for the quest for human completion". According to Freire, freedom will be the result of praxis—informed action—when a balance between theory and practice is achieved"&lt;ref&gt;Freire, Paulo. Pedagogy of the Oppressed. New York: Continuum, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==In popular culture==

The story of [[Sophie Scholl]] and the [[White Rose]] has been filmed four times, including Die Weisse Rose in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Maslin]], film review, New York Times, 6th May 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sophie Scholl: The Final Days]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Holden]], 'The quiet resolve of a German anti-Nazi martyr', [[The New York Times]], 17/2/2006&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Richard Attenborough]]'s [[Gandhi (film)]] was a worldwide success in spite of one Hollywood mogul opining that the central character was a 'little brown man in a sheet whom nobody wants to see.'&lt;ref&gt;Martin Chilton, Film review, [[daily Telegraph]], 11/4/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further reading==

''Speak Truth To Power: Human Rights Defenders Who Are Changing Our World'' is a 2003 book by [[Kerry Kennedy]] with photographs by [[Eddie Adams (photographer)|Eddie Adams]]. It features interviews with fifty activists from around the world, such as [[Jose Ramos-Horta]] from [[East Timor]], [[Diana Ortiz]] of [[Guatemala]] and [[Baltasar Garzon]] of Spain.  'In a world lamenting that there are no more heroes', these people have shown 'valour... courage... extraordinary feats of bravery'.

This book has been translated into six languages and was adapted for the stage by [[Ariel Dorfman]].&lt;ref&gt;Kerry Kennedy Wikipedia article&lt;/ref&gt; It is a 'call to action' and includes contact information for Human Rights organisations relevant to each of the fifty people profiled.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22454">{{Distinguish|pronunciation spelling}}
A '''spelling pronunciation''' is the [[pronunciation]] of a word according to its spelling, at odds with a standard or traditional pronunciation. Words spelled with silent letters (e.g. ''island'', ''knife''), or traditionally pronounced with [[vowel reduction|reduced vowels]] or [[syncope (phonetics)|omitted consonants]] (e.g. ''cupboard'', ''Worcester''), may be subject to a spelling pronunciation.

If a word's spelling was standardized prior to sound changes that produced its "traditional" pronunciation, a spelling pronunciation may reflect an even older pronunciation. This is often the case with compound words (e.g. ''waistcoat'', ''cupboard'', ''forehead''). It is also the case for many words with silent letters (e.g. ''often''&lt;ref name=often&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/often ''often''] in the American Heritage Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;), though not all—silent letters are sometimes added for etymological reasons, to reflect a word's spelling in its language of origin (e.g. ''victual'', rhyming with ''little''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/victuals?show=0&amp;t=1360598212 ''victuals''] in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=victual&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/victual ''victual'' in ''Oxford Dictionaries'']&lt;/ref&gt; but derived from [[Late Latin]] ''victualia''). Some silent letters were added on the basis of erroneous etymologies, as in the cases of the words ''island''&lt;ref name=island&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/island ''island''] in the American Heritage Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; and ''scythe''.

Spelling pronunciations are generally considered incorrect next to the traditionally accepted, and usually more widespread, pronunciation. If a spelling pronunciation persists and becomes more common, it may eventually join the existing form as equally acceptable (for example ''waistcoat''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/waistcoat?view=uk |title=Definition for waistcoat - Oxford Dictionaries Online (World English) |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''often''), or even become the dominant pronunciation (as with ''forehead'' and ''falcon''). If a rare word is more often encountered in writing than in speech, the spelling pronunciation may be assumed by most, while the traditional pronunciation is maintained only by older or educated individuals.&lt;!-- I think this is what the earlier sentence ("The traditional pronunciations of even rare words are often still in use, especially by educated people.") was getting at, but I'm not sure.--&gt;{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Prevalence and causes==
A large number of easily noticeable spelling pronunciations occurs only in languages such as French and English in which spelling tends to not indicate the current pronunciation. Because all languages have at least some words which are not spelled as pronounced, even those such as Finnish with most words being written  phonetically, spelling pronunciations can arise in any language in which most people obtain only enough education to learn how to read and write but not enough to understand when the spelling fails to indicate the modern pronunciation. In other words, when many people do not clearly understand the relationship between spelling and pronunciation, spelling pronunciations are common.

On the other hand, spelling pronunciations are also evidence of the reciprocal effects of spoken and written language on each other.&lt;ref name=stubbs&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dZg9AAAAIAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Michael Stubbs, Language and Literacy: the Sociolinguistics of Reading and Writing. London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul], p. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Many spellings represent older forms and corresponding older pronunciations. Some spellings, however, are not etymologically correct.

Though many people may believe (to various degrees of accuracy) that the written language is "more correct", that, in turn, can become a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], with the written language affecting and changing the spoken language and resulting in a pronunciation that is similar to an older pronunciation or even to a new pronunciation that is suggested by the spelling but had never occurred before.&lt;ref name=stubbs/&gt;

==Examples of English words with common spelling pronunciations==
*''a'', the indefinite article, is usually pronounced {{IPA|/ə/}}, which is a reasonable contraction of the word ''one'' from which {{IPA|/wʌn/}} it once originated. If it is pronounced with stress or a very careful articulation, however, it changes to {{IPA|/eɪ/}}, which is a spelling pronunciation.
*''often'', pronounced with {{IPA|/t/}}. That is actually a reversion to the 15th-century pronunciation,&lt;ref name=often/&gt; but the pronunciation without /t/ is still preferred by 73% of British speakers and 78% of American speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, J. C. (2008). ''Longman Pronunciation Dictionary'', 3rd edn, Harlow, UK: Longman, p. 560.&lt;/ref&gt; Older dictionaries do not list the pronunciation with /t/ although the 2nd edition of the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] does (and the first edition notes the pronunciation with the comment that it is prevalent in the south of [[England]] and "often used in singing"; see the ''[[Dictionary of American Regional English]]'' for contemporaneous citations that discuss the status of the competing pronunciations). The sporadic nature of such shifts is apparent upon examination of examples such as ''whistle'', ''listen'' and ''soften'' in which the ''t'' remains usually silent.
*''forehead'' once rhymed with ''horrid'' but is now pronounced with the second syllable as {{IPA|/hɛd/}} by 85% of American speakers and 65% of British speakers. That is actually a reversion to the original pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, John (2010). ''The Origins and Development of the English Language'', 6th edn, Boston, MA: Wadsworth, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''clothes'' was historically pronounced the same way as the verb ''close'' ("Whenas in silks my Julia goes/.../The liquefaction of her clothes"&amp;mdash;[[Robert Herrick (poet)|Herrick]]), but many speakers now insert a {{IPA|/ð/}}, a voiced ''th''. That is actually a reversion to the 15th-century pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Wells |url=http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2010/07/clothes.html |title=OED note on history of "clothes" |publisher=Phonetic-blog.blogspot.com |date=2010-07-16 |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''salmon'' is occasionally pronounced with {{IPA|/l/}}.
*''falcon'' is now nearly always pronounced with {{IPA|/l/}}, and only 3% of speakers have no {{IPA|/l/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, J. C. (2008). ''Longman Pronunciation Dictionary'', 3rd ed., Harlow, UK: Longman, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; The {{IPA|/l/}} was silent in the old pronunciation: compare French ''faucon'' and the older English spellings ''faucon'' and ''fawcon''. That may suggest either analogical change or the reborrowing of the original Latin.
*''alm'', ''balm'', ''psalm'' are now often pronounced with {{IPA|/l/}} in some parts of the [[United States]]. In most of the [[United Kingdom]], the traditional {{IPA|/ɑːm/}} pronunciation continues to prevail.
*''comptroller'' is often pronounced with {{IPA|/mp/}}; the accepted pronunciation is "controller" (the ''mp'' spelling is based on the mistaken idea that the word has something to do with ''comp''(''u'')''tare'' "count, compute", but it comes from ''contre-roll'' "file copy", both the verb and its agent noun meaning "compare originals and file copies").
*''ye'', the article as in ''Ye Old Coffee Shoppe'' is often pronounced not as ''the'', as it should be,  but as if spelled with a ''y'', instead of the printer's mark for [[Þ]], the letter thorn.&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, John (2010). ''The Origins and Development of the English Language'', 6th edn, Boston, MA: Wadsworth, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; (The archaic/obsolete second-person nominative plural pronoun ''ye'' in [[Middle English#Pronouns|Middle]] and [[Early Modern English#Pronouns|Early Modern]] English is correctly pronounced like the beginning of ''you''.)
*Taking the [[Insular G|insular flat-topped ''g'']] of northern scripts as a ''z''- in names like ''Mackenzie, Menzies, Dalziel'' (originally pronounced with the value of {{IPA|/j/}}).{{clarify|date=June 2017}}
*''tortilla'' and other words from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] with the [[Ll|double-L]] pronounced {{IPA|/l/}} instead of {{IPA|/j/}} (the latter being the closest approximation to the sound in Latin American Spanish); similarly, the [[Italian language|Italian]]-sourced ''maraschino'' (cherry) and ''bruschetta'' with the {{IPA|/ʃ/}} associated with that consonant cluster in German instead of the {{IPA|/sk/}} of Italian.
*''victuals'', pronounced {{IPA|/ˈvɪtəls/}} (rhyming with ''skittles''), whose -''c''- (for a consonant that had been lost long before the word was borrowed from French) was re-introduced on etymological grounds, and the word is sometimes pronounced with {{IPA|/kt/}}.
*The pronunciation of ''waistcoat'' as ''waist-coat'' is now more common than the previous pronunciation {{IPA|/ˈwɛskət/}}.
*''conduit'', historically pronounced {{IPA|/ˈkɒndɪt/}} or {{IPA|/ˈkʌndɪt/}}, is now nearly always pronounced {{IPA|/ˈkɒnd&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;uːɪt/}}, {{IPA|/ˈkɑndwɪt/}} or {{IPA|/ˈkɑnduɪt/}} in most of the United States. 
*''covert'', historically pronounced {{IPA|/ˈkʌvɚt/}} (reflecting its link with the verb ''cover'') is now pronounced usually {{IPA|/ˈkoʊvɚt/}}, by analogy to ''overt''.
*''medicine'', historically pronounced with two syllables but now quite often with three (some speakers use two when they mean medicaments and three when they mean medical knowledge; the pronunciation with three syllables is standard in the [[United States]]).
*''Bartholomew'', formerly pronounced {{IPA|/ˈbɑrtəlmi/}} or {{IPA|/bɑrˈtɑləmi/}}, is now {{IPA|/bɑrˈθɒləmju/}}.
*''Anthony'' (&lt; Lat. ''Antonius''), now (in the US) {{IPA|/ˈænθəni/}}.
*Numerous placenames with traditional pronunciations have been displaced by ones influenced by the spelling: ''[[St. Louis]]'', formerly {{IPA|/sæn ˈluːiː/}} now (locally) {{IPA|/seɪnt ˈluːɪs/}}, ''[[Papillion, Nebraska|Papillion]]'' ([[Nebraska]]), formerly {{IPA|/ˌpæpiˈjɒn/}} now {{IPA|/pəˈpiljən/}}, ''[[Beatrice, Nebraska|Beatrice]]'' (Nebraska) formerly and still somewhat currently {{IPA|/biˈætrɪs/}}, now {{IPA|/ˈbiətrɪs/}}. [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]], the capital of [[Vermont]], is now pronounced {{IPA|/mɒntˈpiːliər/}}, instead of the French-influenced {{IPA|/mɔ̃pelje/}}.
*Sir [[George Everest]]'s [[surname]] is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|v|r|ᵻ|s|t}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Claypole, Jonty (Director); Kunzru, Hari (Presenter) | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074phg | title = Mapping Everest | medium = TV Documentary | publisher = BBC Television | location = London |date = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mountain named after him – ''[[Mount Everest]]'' – is generally pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|v|ər|ᵻ|s|t}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Everest%2C%20Mount?r=14 Everest, Mount – Definitions from Dictionary.com] (Based on the Random House Unabridged Dictionary, © Random House, Inc. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interjections such as ''tsk tsk!'' or ''tut tut!'' (a pair of [[dental clicks]]), now commonly {{IPA|/ˈtɪsk ˈtɪsk/}} and {{IPA|/ˈtʌt ˈtʌt/}}.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}
*The words ''Arctic'', ''Antarctic'' and ''Antarctica'' were originally pronounced without the first /k/, but the spelling pronunciation has become very common. The first "c" was originally added to the spelling for etymological reasons and was then misunderstood as not being silent.&lt;ref&gt;See "The Fight for English" by David Crystal (p. 172, Oxford University Press) and the entry for "antarctic" in the [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Antarctic Online Etymology Dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''ski'', originally pronounced {{IPA|/ʃiː/}} (as it is a loanword from [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), but it is now usually {{IPA|/skiː/}}.
* ''zoology'', which is often pronounced "zoo-ology" (/zuˈɑlədʒi/). That is not quite "spelling pronunciation" because it is never pronounced "zoo-logy" (/ˈzulədʒi/). It is probably influenced by the word ''zoo'' (derived from ''zoological garden''), which rhymes with ''goo''. (It has been posited that dropping the [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] in ''zoölogy'' antiquated the pronunciation /zəʊˈɒlədʒi/.)&lt;ref&gt;https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/66126/what-is-the-standard-rule-for-using-or-not-using-hyphen-and-diaeresis-on-the-wor&lt;/ref&gt; A similar case might be the pronunciation outside the United States of ''hecatomb'' as rhyming with "deck a tomb" and pronounced /ˈhɛ.kə.tuːm/.
* ''hotel'', originally pronounced {{IPA|/oʊtɛl/}} because of the pronunciation of the French ''hôtel'', is now usually pronounced with an audible ''h''.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/hotel&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, ''maître d'hôtel'' is pronounced /ˌmeɪtrə dəʊˈtɛl/.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/maitre_d'hotel&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''herb'', a word with origins in [[Old French]], is pronounced with a silent ''h'' in the United States. The same was true of the United Kingdom until the 19th century, when it adopted a spelling pronunciation, with an audible ''h''.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/herb&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ralph'', originally pronounced /ˈreɪf/ or /ˈra:f/ in the United Kingdom (at least in England), is now often pronounced /ˈrælf/.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~wedgwood/framesetpronunciation.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*German loanwords such as ''spiel'' and ''stein'' are sometimes pronounced as beginning with /s/, as if they were native English words, instead of /ʃ/. In German, initial ''s'' is, immediately before ''p'' or ''t'', is pronounced as if it were ''sch'' /ʃ/.

==Opinions==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2015}}
Spelling pronunciations give rise to varied opinions. Often, those who retain the old pronunciation consider the spelling pronunciation to be a mark of ignorance or insecurity. Those who use a spelling pronunciation may not be aware that it is one and consider the historically-authentic version to be slovenly since it "slurs over" a letter. Conversely, the users of some innovative pronunciations such as "Febuary" (for ''February'') may regard the historically- and phonetically-authentic version to be a pedantic spelling pronunciation.

[[Henry Watson Fowler]] (1858–1933) reports that in his day, there was a conscious movement among schoolteachers and others encouraging people to abandon anomalous traditional pronunciations and to "speak as you spell". According to major scholars of early modern English (Dobson, Wyld et al.), in the 17th century, there was already beginning an "intellectual" trend in England to "pronounce as you spell". That presupposes a standard spelling system, which was only beginning to form at the time.
Similarly, quite a large number of "corrections" slowly spread from scholars to the general public in France, starting several centuries ago.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Rickard, ''A History of the French Language'': 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

A different variety of spelling pronunciations are [[phonetic adaptations]], pronunciations of the written form of foreign words within the frame of the phonemic system of the language that accepts them: an example of this process is ''garage'' ({{IPA|[ɡaʀaːʒ]}} in French) sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[ˈɡæɹɪd͡ʒ]}} in English. Such adaptations are quite natural and often preferred by speech-conscious and careful speakers.

==Children and foreigners==
Children who read a great deal often produce spelling pronunciations since if they do not consult a dictionary, they have only the spelling to indicate the pronunciation of words that are uncommon in the spoken language. Well-read [[second language]] learners may also produce spelling pronunciations.

In some instances, a population in a formerly non-English speaking area may retain such second language markers in the now native-English speaking population. For example, Scottish Standard English is replete with spelling pronunciations from when [[Scots language|Scots]] was subsumed by English in the 17th century.

However, since there are many words that one reads far more often than one hears, adult native-language speakers are also affected. In such circumstances, the "spelling pronunciation" may well be more comprehensible than any other. That, in turn, leads to the language evolution mentioned above. What is a spelling pronunciation in one generation often becomes the standard pronunciation in the next.

==In other languages==

In [[French language|French]], the modern pronunciation of the 16th-century French author [[Montaigne]] as {{IPA|[mɔ̃tɛɲ]}}, rather than the contemporary {{IPA|[mɔ̃taɲ]}}, is a spelling pronunciation.

When English ''club'' was first borrowed into French, the approved pronunciation was /klab/, as being a reasonable approximation of the English. The standard then became /klyb/ on the basis of the spelling, and later, in Europe, /klœb/, deemed closer to the English original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/club |title=Trésor de la langue française |publisher=Cnrtl.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard pronunciation in [[Quebec French]] remains [klʏb]. Similarly, ''shampooing'' "product for washing the hair" at the time of borrowing was {{IPA|/ʃɑ̃puiŋ/}} but it is now {{IPA|/ʃɑ̃pwɛ̃/}}

In [[Modern Hebrew]], the word חֵטְא ({{IPA|[χe̞t]}}, meaning 'sin') is sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[ˈχe̞tä]}}, as suggested by its spelling, especially by children. Other examples of spelling pronunciations are the [[Sephardic Hebrew]] כָּל ({{IPA|[ˈkol]}}, meaning all) being pronounced as {{IPA|[ˈkäl]}} and צָהֳרַיִם ({{IPA|[ˈtso.oɣäjim]}}, meaning noon) being pronounced as {{IPA|[ˈtsä.oɣäjim]}} because of how the [[Kamatz|kamatz katan]] vowel point (אָ), which indicates {{IPA|[o]}}, is visually identical to the kamatz, which indicates {{IPA|[ä]}}.

In [[Italian language|Italian]], a few early [[English language|English]] [[loanword]]s are pronounced according to [[Italian spelling]] rules such as ''water'' ('toilet bowl', from English ''[[Water closet|water (closet)]]''), pronounced [ˈvater], and ''[[wikt:tramway|tramway]]'', pronounced [tranˈvai]. The Italian word ''ovest'' ('west') comes from a spelling pronunciation of [[French language|French]] ''ouest'' (which, in turn, is a phonetic transcription of English ''west''); that particular instance of spelling pronunciation must have occurred before the 16th century, when the letters [[u]] and [[v]] were still indistinct.

A few foreign proper names are normally pronounced according to the pronunciation of the original language (or a close approximation of it), but they retain an older spelling pronunciation when they are used as parts of Italian [[street name]]s. For exame, the name of [[Edward Jenner]] retains its usual English pronunciation in most contexts, but ''Viale Edoardo Jenner'' (a main street in [[Milan]]) is pronounced [ˈvjale edoˈardo 'jɛnner]. The use of such old-fashioned spelling pronunciations was probably encouraged by the custom of translating [[given name]]s when streets were named after foreign people: ''Edoardo'' for ''Edward'', or ''Giorgio'' for ''George'' for ''Via [[George Washington|Giorgio Washington]]''.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the "ch" in some German words is pronounced {{IPAslink|tʃ}} or {{IPAslink|ʃ}},instead of {{IPAslink|x}}. [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] is correctly pronounced {{IPA|[bax]}}, and [[Kuchen]] is {{IPA|[ˈkuxen]}}, but [[Rorschach test|Rorschach]] is {{IPA|[ˈrorʃaʃ]}}, rather than {{IPA|[ˈrorʃax]}}, [[Mach number|Mach]] is {{IPA|[maʃ]}} or {{IPA|[matʃ]}}, and [[Cristina Kirchner|Kirchner]] is {{IPA|[ˈkirʃner]}} or {{IPA|[ˈkirtʃner]}}. Other spelling pronunciations are [[club (organization)|club]] pronounced {{IPA|[klub]}}, [[iceberg]] pronounced {{IPA|[iθeˈβer]}} in Spain (in [[Spanish language in the Americas|the Americas]], it is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈaisberɡ]}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltGUIBusDPD?lema=iceberg |title=DPD 1.Ş edición, 2.Ş tirada |language=es |publisher=Buscon.rae.es |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''folclor'' and ''folclore'' as translations of [[folklore]], pronounced {{IPA|[folˈklor]}} and {{IPA|[folˈkloɾe]}}. Also in Spanish, the acute accent in the French word ''élite'' is taken as a Spanish stress mark, and the word is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈelite]}}.

When [[Polish language|Polish]] borrows words from English with their spelling preserved, the pronunciation tends to follow the rules of Polish. Words such as "marketing" are pronounced as spelled, instead of the more faithful{{clarify|date=July 2016}} "markytyng".

In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], initial "v" is often pronounced like a "y" ({{IPA|[j]}}) in the central and southern varieties. However, in formal speech, speakers often revert to the spelling pronunciation, which is increasingly being used in casual speech as well.

__TOC__

==History==

When Queen Anne's Gate was built by the banker [[William Paterson (banker)|William Paterson]] in 1704–5,&lt;ref name="Gomme"/&gt; it originally formed two separate closes  divided by a wall with two openings, with Queen Square to the west and Park Street to the east. The statue is first mentioned in [[Edward Hatton (surveyor)|Edward Hatton]]'s ''A New View of London'' (1708) as being "erected in full proportion on a pedestal at the E.End of Q[ueen]. ''Square'', ''Westminster''".&lt;ref name="Ward-Jackson"/&gt; An engraved map of 1710 depicts the statue of Queen Anne in the middle of the wall, flanked by the gateways on either side.&lt;ref name="SurvLon"/&gt; At some point in the early 19th century the statue was moved to a new position in the square. The ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'' reported in 1814 that "the statue until of late occupied a conspicuous situation on the East end of the square, but now we find it huddled up in a corner".&lt;ref name="Ward-Jackson" /&gt;

By 1862, the statue had lost its nose and right arm. The [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Earl of Caernarvon]] and other local residents pressed the [[Office of Works]] to repair it, saying in a letter that the residents had long been dissatisfied with the statue's poor condition.&lt;ref name="Blackwood" /&gt; His request received a favourable response from the First Commissioner of Works, William Cowper. Although Cowper regarded the statue as being of "little merit as a work of art",&lt;ref name="Ward-Jackson" /&gt; he did not "think it desirable that a statue of an illustrious sovereign should be left in a public place without a nose or right arm."&lt;ref name="Blackwood" /&gt; The sculptor [[John Thomas (sculptor)|John Thomas]] was hired to repair it. He based the face on a [[squeeze (copying method)|"squeeze"]] (plaster cast) of [[Francis Bird]]'s statue of Queen Anne outside [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. The right arm was replaced with a marble substitute and a replacement bronze sceptre was also installed.&lt;ref name="Ward-Jackson"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ward-Jackson | first = Philip | year = 2011 | title = Public Sculpture of Historic Westminster: Volume 1 | series = Public Sculpture of Britain | location = Liverpool | publisher = Liverpool University Press | pages = 234–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Queen Square 1850.jpg|thumb|left|Queen Square (now Queen Anne's Gate), London, in 1850. The statue was located at the right-hand edge of the railings at the rear of the square.]]
The statue's poor condition was due in large part to the local children's mistaken belief that the statue represented the ill-reputed Queen Mary.

In 1938, the house's then owner, E. Thornton Smith, carried out repairs at his own expense. He resolved the question of ongoing maintenance through his position as Master of the [[Worshipful Company of Gardeners]] by presenting the statue to the Company and arranging that it would pay for any future repairs with the Office of Works carrying out the work. An 18-inch thick brick wall was built around the statue in 1940 to protect it from enemy bombing during the [[Second World War]]; it was only in April 1947 that the wall was removed.&lt;ref name="Ward-Jackson" /&gt;

[[Image:funeral mat.jpg|right|thumb|Different types of ta{{okina}}ovala worn at funerals]]
A '''ta{{okina}}ovala''' is a [[Tonga]]n dress, a mat wrapped around the waist, worn by men and women, at all formal occasions, much like the [[Necktie|tie]] for men in the European and North American culture. The ta'ovala is also commonly seen among the Fijian [[Lau Islands]], a region once heavily influenced by Tongan hegemony and cultural diffusion.

== Origins ==

According to a Tongan story, a group of Tongans once arrived by boat at the [[Tu'i Tonga|Tu{{okina}}i Tonga]]. They had had a rough ride and their clothing, if any remained, was not respectable. They cut the sail of their boat ([[Polynesia]]n sails are also mats) in pieces and wrapped them around. The king was so pleased by the sacrifice they had made to him of their expensive sail that he ordered this dress to be court dress from then on. The Tongan waist-mat probably shares a common origin or inspiration as the [[Samoan language|Samoan]] "valatau" or "vala" waistband often donned by orators and chiefly sons ("manaia") and daughters ("taupou") on festive occasions and rituals.

Queen [[Salote Tupou III]] ordered the ta{{okina}}ovala to be part of the civil servants' uniform. The use of the ta{{okina}}ovala for men is therefore extremely common in Tonga. For women it is somewhat less common, as they prefer a [[kiekie (clothing)|kiekie]].

The normal ta{{okina}}ovala, for everyday neat wear, is a short mat, coming halfway up the thighs. It is tied with a rope (''kafa'', often made of coconut [[coir]] or of human hair of a deceased ancestor) wrapped around the waist. The mat worn on festive occasions, like a marriage, is much larger and often very nicely decorated. Likewise the ta{{okina}}ovala for a [[Tongan funerals|funeral]] is also a huge mat, but much coarser, not decorated. If the wearer has an inferior rank towards the deceased, the mat is old and torn. The older and more torn it is, the better. All these special mats are kept as precious heirlooms.

Ta{{okina}}ovala are part of the [[koloa]], the handicraft goods made by the women. Every woman can do it. If girls do not learn it at home, it will be taught at school. More recently, however, some women specialise in the handicraft and sell their products on the market.

== Materials ==

Ta{{okina}}ovala can be made from different materials, natural and introduced:
* Strips of [[pandanus]] leaves, usually unpainted, although sometimes black strips are used, and rarely the whole ta{{okina}}ovala is black. The strips range from coarse (15&amp;nbsp;mm or so as for funerals) to fine (a couple of millimeters, as the ''ta{{okina}}ovala loukeha'', in which one is dressed to visit the king). Mats are always woven by hand. Especially the fine mats are therefore very laborious to make, take a long time to complete and are expensive. The oldest and most valuable Tongan fine mats are preserved and worn by the Tongan royal family on formal occasions.
* Strips of [[hibiscus]] bast fiber, called ''fau''. Same as the pandanus leaves, but not as coarse and as such they can be plaited in a variety of patterns, which is faster and cheaper than to weave them by hand. Most of the 'civil servants' ta{{okina}}ovala are made in this way.
* Plastic, particularly those obtained from old flour bags - preferred as a quick alternative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16088">[[Image:Museu da electricidade.jpg|thumb|660px|Tejo Power Station seen from the [[Tagus River|Tagus River (Rio Tejo)]].]]
The '''Tejo Power Station''' was a thermoelectric power plant owned by the ''Companhias Reunidas de Gás e Electricidade'' (CRGE – United Gas and Electric Companies), which supplied power to the city and entire [[Grande Lisboa Subregion|Lisbon region]]. 

It is located in the [[Santa Maria de Belém|Belém]] district of Portugal's capital and its activity spanned from 1909 to 1972, although as of 1951 it was used as a reserve power station. Over time, it underwent several adjustments and expansions, going through many different phases of construction and production.  

It now houses the [[Electricity Museum (Lisbon)|Museu da Electricidade (Electricity Museum)]]

==Introduction==
The original Tejo Power Station, whose buildings no longer exist, was built in 1909 and operated until 1921. In 1914, construction began on the low pressure boiler buildings and the machinery room, which were later expanded several times. Finally, in 1941 construction on the high pressure boiler building took place, the power station's largest structure, which was expanded in 1951 with the addition of another [[boiler]].

Despite operating for the last time in 1972, it was only officially shut down in 1975, thus proving its great importance to the city of [[Lisbon]] as [[Industrial archaeology|industrial archaeological]] heritage. For this reason, in 1986 it was classified as an Asset of Public Interest. Since 1990, the Tejo Power Station is open as the [[Electricity Museum (Lisbon)|Electricity Museum]].

== History ==
{{see also|Tejo Power Station (History)}}
The buildings built in 1909, and which no longer exist, comprised the original Tejo Power Station, which remained operational until 1921. It was designed and projected by engineer [[Lucien Neu]], and construction was undertaken by the company [[Vieillard &amp; Touzet]] (the latter, [[Fernand Touzet]], a disciple of [[Gustave Eiffel]]).

For years, the machinery was altered in order to increase the plant's output, and in 1912, when all the equipment was installed, the plant had fifteen small Belleville boilers and five [[electrical generator|generating]] sets with a 7,75MW output. From 1916 until being deactivated in 1921, it received steam from the new boilers installed in the current low pressure building, and was shut down, dismantled and used as storage space and workshops from that time until 1938, when it was demolished to make room for construction of the high pressure boiler building.

=== Low Pressure Phase ===
The low pressure naves began construction in 1914 and were completed in 1930, going through three very important construction phases. The first (from 1914 to 1921) included construction of two industrial naves for the boilers, the machinery room for the alternators and for the substation.
The second phase (from 1924 to 1928) included the first expansion of the boiler room with a new longitudinal nave, the purchase of a new generating set, construction of a coal distributor and the docks to the refrigeration circuit's channels.
Finally, it was in the third phase (from 1928 to 1930) that the final expansion was carried out on the boiler room–with a new industrial nave of greater proportions than the previous ones–the machinery room and the substation.

Thus, in the 1930s, the plant's boiler room included eleven low pressure [[boiler]]s: ten [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] and one Humboldt. The machinery room comprised five generating sets of varying outputs and brands: Escher &amp; Wiss, [[AEG]] (two sets), Stal-Asea and Escher Wiss/Thompson.

=== High Pressure Phase ===
With the increased output from the two new AEG [[Alternator|turbo-alternator]] sets installed in 1934, it was necessary to install new boilers that would operate with high pressure steam. Construction was carried out on property previously occupied by the original Tejo Power Station, which was demolished in 1938 to make way for construction of this new high pressure boiler building, the facility's most impressive structure. Inside, it housed three large [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] high pressure boilers, which began operating in 1941.

With the destruction of the original Tejo Power Station and the installation of the high pressure boiler building, the need arose for space for workshops and storage space. Thus the CRGE purchased the properties adjoining the eastern side of the complex, where the old '''Senna Sugar Estates, Ltd.''' sugar refinery–owned by the ''Companhia de Açúcar de Moçambique'' (Mozambique Sugar Company) –used to operate. It was also necessary to create an auxiliary room for water [[Sewage treatment|treatment]], which was installed inside the low pressure boiler building, thus dismantling the first two boilers.

In 1950 the high pressure boiler building was expanded to include another boiler, which began operating the following year and constituted the plant's final expansion.

=== Integration into the National Electric Grid ===
With the entry into force in 1944 of Law 2002 – the '''National Electrification Law''', which made producing [[hydroelectric power]] an absolute priority, the Tejo Power Station took on a secondary role in the electricity sector due to the construction of the first major hydroelectric station, the [[Castelo do Bode dam]], which began operating in 1951, gradually turning the Tejo Power Station into a reserve station.

Nonetheless, the Tejo Power Station operated without interruption between 1951 and 1968, except for in 1961. In 1972, as follow-up to an attempt against the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Salazar regime]], [[High-voltage lines|high voltage lines]] carrying [[electric power]] to [[Lisbon]] from the Castelo do Bode hydroelectric station were pulled down, and the Tejo Power Station was once again reactivated, producing [[electricity]] for the last time in its history. It was officially shut down in 1975.

=== The Tejo Power Station as an Electricity Museum ===
{{see also|Electricity Museum (Lisbon)}}
After closing and nationalising the electric companies, it was decided that this old [[Thermal power station|thermoelectric power station]] should be given new life and reopened for cultural purposes. The first team responsible for the Museum was formed in 1986, and in 1990 it opened its doors to the general public.

Between 2001 and 2005, the Museum underwent profound restructuring, from the entire architectural heritage to the [[Museography|museographic content]]. Finally, in 2006 the museum reopened its doors, but with a new type of [[museology]] which was much more educational and dynamic.

== Architectural Ensemble ==
{{see also|Tejo Power Station (architectural ensemble)}}
After continuous transformations and expansions over the years, the Tejo Power Station's architectural ensemble represents the masterful conservation of a large manufacturing structure from the first half of the 20th century.
The entire set of buildings is in perfect aesthetic harmony thanks to the use of an iron structure covered in [[brick]] on all the structures. Despite this, there are differences in style between the low pressure naves and the high pressure building.

== Operation ==
{{see also|Tejo Power Station (Operation)}}
The operating principle of a [[Thermal power station|thermoelectric power station]] is based on the burning of fuel to produce [[vapour]] which then turns an [[electric current]] generator. In theory, this is simple to carry out, but in practice it requires a complex combination of machines, circuits and logistics.

At the Tejo Power Station, the main fuel was [[coal]], which arrived by river and was unloaded into the square with the same name in order to then be deposited in the crusher and sent to the mixing [[silo]]s. From there, the coal was fed onto the conveyor belt running along the top of the building, and dropped onto the [[combustion]] belt inside the furnace. There it was burnt at a temperature of approximately 1200&amp;nbsp;°C.
The heat thereby generated would turn the water passing through the boiler's inner tubes into steam, which was then carried to the [[Alternator|turbo-alternators]]. The water used here travelled in a closed circuit and was chemically pure. For this, it went through a [[Water purification|purification]] and filtering process to avoid deteriorating the station's equipment.

Thus, the steam would travel in the tubes at high [[pressure]] (38&amp;nbsp;kg/cm²) to the [[Electrical generator|generating]] sets, where the [[turbine]] would transform the steam's [[thermal energy]] into [[mechanical energy]], and the [[alternator]] would transform the mechanical energy it received from the turbine into [[electric power]], producing a 10.500 V [[Three-phase electric power|triphasic electric current]] with a 50&amp;nbsp;Hz frequency, which after passing through the [[Electrical substation|plant's substation]], was distributed among consumers.

In turn, after running the turbines, the steam was sent to the [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensers]] where it was turned back into water in order to be reused in the boilers. The hot steam returned to its liquid state through contact with the cold walls of the condenser's inner tubes, which carried water from the [[Tagus]] river. For that reason, the river water never came into direct contact with the purified water used as work fluid. From the condenser, the water was pumped back to the boilers, thereby closing the cycle.

== The Plant’s Working Conditions ==
{{see also|Tejo Power Station (working conditions)}}
The plant's operation would have been impossible without the people who worked there for generations. It was necessary to have a strict [[Division of labour|division of tasks]] and a shift work system in order to guarantee the station operated without interruption.
The close to five hundred workers who laboured all day and night fulfilled more than forty-five different roles. Those jobs ranged from [[coal]] unloaders to the most specialised engineers and technicians, with workers in the boiler rooms and [[carpentry]] and [[ironwork]] workshops in between.

The hardest jobs were those involving coal burning, both in the boiler room and in the boiler dust (ash) room, with workers having to endure extremely high temperatures due to the coal burning inside the boilers, the dust originating from combustion and the deafening noise throughout the entire work shift. Even so, it was the boiler room that occupied the largest number of workers and had the greatest number of different tasks. It was here that the chief technical Engineer, technical engineers, head operators, sub-head operators, operators, stokers and workers (boiler dust extraction), all endured extremely harsh working conditions, especially the latter.

== Value of the Heritage  ==
[[Image:Geradores actual central tejo museu electricidade.JPG|thumb|300px|Musealised AEG alternator in the Machinery Room.]]
The Tejo Power Station has huge [[Cultural heritage|heritage value]], not only in [[Architecture|architectural]] or [[Archaeology|archaeological]] terms, but also from a [[History|historic]], [[Sociology|social]], [[Anthropology|anthropological]] and [[Economics|economic]] perspective.
The heritage left behind throughout the power station's activity is undeniable. It was the main power station in [[Lisbon]] and [[Portugal]] until the mid-20th century. Its reach covered the entire city and the [[Lisboa e Vale do Tejo|Tagus Valley]], lighting up streets and homes and providing factories with power. Without the Tejo Power Station, Lisbon's history would have been very different. It was the invisible factor in the city's growth and expansion in the 20th century, the cornerstone for regional [[industrialisation]] and the first electrified railway line in the country (Lisbon – Cascais).

At the same time, the Tejo Power Station was crucial to Lisbon's modernisation. Several generations worked and suffered by the boilers so that others could turn on the lights in their homes, walk through artificially lit streets at night, or travel comfortably in [[Trams in Lisbon|electric tram]]s that climbed Lisbon's precipitous slopes.
Aside from that, within the station's complex, there is also a set of assets that, by remaining intact, made this old [[Thermal power station|thermoelectric power plant]] survive the deindustrialisation of the [[Santa Maria de Belém|Belém]] district, thus making it unique in the country and perhaps all of Europe.
* '''Real estate assets'''. The Tejo Power Station manufacturing plant (classified as an Asset of Public Interest since 1986), with the low pressure and machinery room structures (1914-1930), high pressure and water room structures (1938-1951), and the plant's numerous workshops, whose set of buildings (which once belonged to the old sugar refinery and date back to the end of the 19th-beginning of the 20th century) are today the Museum's Documentation Centre and Storage.
* '''Movable property'''. The Museum currently houses four [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] high pressure [[boiler]]s dated 1941 and 1951 and two [[AEG]] turbo [[alternator]]s dated 1942 with the respective [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensers]]. [[Refrigeration|Furthermore]], there are coolers, [[Circuit breaker|circuit-breakers]] and measuring apparatuses in the machinery room, blowers, [[Filtration|filters]], [[pump]]s and [[distiller]]s in the water room, all dating back to the 1940s. Other items include coal bucket elevators, [[Minecart|trolleys]], [[silo]]s and [[carpentry]] and [[ironwork]] materials. In the storage and garden areas, there are also [[Electrical generator|generator]] sets from other power plants, speed regulators, [[valve]]s and several items associated with [[Lisbon]]’s public lighting, as well as [[Home appliance|household appliances]] of various periods, types and categories.

'''Treating''' is the act of serving food, drink, and other refreshments in order to influence people and to gain benefits not easily obtained in the free market.  It began as a political term, and came to be used elsewhere.

[[File:BingamElection.jpg|thumb|300px|right|George Bingam's "The County Election" (1852) shows the effects of the campaigns' "treating" the voters with alcoholic beverages: several of them are too drunk to stand without assistance.]]
In law and politics, treating is the act of serving food, drink, and other refreshments to influence people for political gain, often shortly before an election. In various countries, treating is considered a form of [[Political corruption|corruption]], and is illegal as such.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM310402.html NZ Legislation Online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=2046829 NZ Herald - Election 'treats' get just deserts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=2042483 NZ Herald - MP in gun for 'carrot' in mailout]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as long as the supplying of refreshments is not part of a ''quid pro quo'' for votes, etc., it is often not illegal.

In a social context, treating came about with the birth of leisure time in the late nineteenth century. Young working class women took pride in going out and enjoying the city’s “cheap amusements”.&lt;ref&gt;Kathy Peiss, Cheap Amusements: Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-century New York (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1986), p.6. &lt;/ref&gt;  Some notable cheap amusements included public dances, amusement parks, and [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon movie theatres]].&lt;ref&gt;Kathy Peiss, “Charity Girls and City Pleasures,” OAH Magazine of History 18, no. 4 (July 2004): 14.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although young working class women liked to go out, this often proved difficult, as their wages were very low. Young women dealt with this issue in numerous ways. Some refrained from going out or limited going out to special occasions, while others depended on their male counterparts to finance their pleasures. The latter solution is referred to as “treating”. Historian Kathy Peiss has popularized this term in many of her scholarly works such as ''Cheap Amusements: Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-Century New York'' (1986) and “Charity Girls and City Pleasures” (2004). 
The act of treating was an exchange between a man and a woman. A man would agree to pay for a woman’s outing in exchange for her company. Treating ranged from the more innocent to the more scandalous. Treating was seen as harmless when it was conducted between a “steady” couple and more risqué when it was performed on a casual basis.&lt;ref&gt;Kathy Peiss, Cheap Amusements: Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-century New York (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1986), p. 54. &lt;/ref&gt;  
The women who engaged with this more risqué form of treating often reciprocated by performing sexual favors. These favors could be dancing, hugging, and kissing to intercourse. The women who engaged with the more intense sexual acts were referred to as “charity girls”. These women did not see themselves as prostitutes but often walked a fine line between being treated and being paid for their sexual services.&lt;ref&gt;Kathy Peiss, Cheap Amusements: Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-century New York (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1986), p. 110. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vellum''' is prepared animal skin or "membrane" used as a material for writing on. The term is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''vitulinum'' meaning "made from calf", leading to [[Old French]] ''velin'' for "calfskin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=vellum|title=vellum|publisher=Online Etymological Dictionary|accessdate=2014-08-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904202532/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=vellum|archive-date=2014-09-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Parchment]] is another term for this material category.  If vellum is distinguished, it is by vellum being made from calf skin, as opposed to that from other animals,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/formats/paper-vellum.html | title=Differences between Parchment, Vellum and Paper | website=archives.gov | access-date=2016-06-16 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615030013/http://www.archives.gov/preservation/formats/paper-vellum.html | archive-date=2016-06-15 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise being of higher quality.&lt;ref name="esdaile"&gt;Stokes and Almagno 2001, 114&lt;/ref&gt;  Vellum is prepared as a surface for writing (or printing) to produce scrolls, single pages, [[Codex|codices]] or books. 

Modern scholars and custodians increasingly use only the safe, if confusing, term "membrane".&lt;ref name="esdaile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c&amp;g9"&gt;Clemens and Graham 2007, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on factors such as the method of preparation it may be very hard to determine the animal species involved (let alone its age) without using a laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Anthony |last=Cains |chapter=The surface examination of skin: a binder's note on the identification of animal species used in the making of parchment |title=The Book of Kells: proceedings of a conference at Trinity College Dublin, 6–9 September 1992 |editor-first=Felicity |editor-last=O'Mahony |publisher=Scolar Press |place=Aldershot |year=1994 |isbn=0-85967-967-5 |pages=172–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term avoids the need to distinguish between vellum and parchment.&lt;ref name="esdaile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c&amp;g9"/&gt;

Vellum is generally smooth and durable, although there are great variations depending on preparation and the quality of the skin. The manufacture involves the cleaning, bleaching, stretching on a frame (a "herse"), and scraping of the skin with a crescent-shaped knife (a "lunarium" or "lunellum"). To create tension, scraping is alternated with wetting and drying. A final finish may be achieved by abrading the surface with [[pumice]], and treating with a preparation of lime or chalk to make it accept writing or printing ink.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Modern "paper vellum" is a made of synthetic plant material, and is called such for its usage and quality similarities. Paper vellum is used for a variety of purposes including tracing, technical drawings, plans and [[blueprint]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Drafting, 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Japanese_vellum|title=Japanese vellum - CAMEO|website=cameo.mfa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903010241/http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Japanese_vellum|archive-date=2017-09-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.americanstationery.com/blog/how-modern-day-vellum-stationery-is-produced/|title=How Modern Day Vellum Stationery is Produced|date=2011-07-04|work=The Note Pad {{!}} Stationery &amp; Party Etiquette Blog by American Stationery|access-date=2017-09-03|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903010030/http://www.americanstationery.com/blog/how-modern-day-vellum-stationery-is-produced/|archive-date=2017-09-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
In Europe, from Roman times, the term "vellum" was used for the best quality of prepared skin, regardless of the animal from which the hide was obtained, [[calfskin|calf]], [[Sheepskin (material)|sheep]], and [[kidskin|goat]] all being commonly used (other animals, including pig, deer, donkey, horse, or camel have been used). Although the term derives from the French for "calf", animal vellum can include hide from virtually any other mammal. The best quality, "uterine vellum",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Houston|first1=Keith|title=The Book: A Cover-to-Cover Exploration of the Most Powerful Object of Our Time|date=2016|publisher=[[W.W. Norton &amp; Company]]|isbn=978-0-393-24479-3|url=https://blog.longreads.com/2016/12/01/hidebound-the-grisly-invention-of-parchment/|accessdate=2 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202124352/https://blog.longreads.com/2016/12/01/hidebound-the-grisly-invention-of-parchment/|archive-date=2016-12-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was said to be made from the skins of [[stillbirth|stillborn]] or unborn animals, although the term was also applied to fine quality skins made from young animals.&lt;ref name="esdaile"/&gt; There has long been, however, much blurring of the boundaries between these terms. In 1519, [[William Horman]] could write in his ''Vulgaria'': "That stouffe that we wrytte upon, and is made of beestis skynnes, is somtyme called parchement, somtyme velem, somtyme abortyve, somtyme membraan."&lt;ref&gt;William Horman, ''Vulgaria'' (1519), fol. 80v; cited in Ustick 1936, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1936, Lee Ustick explained that:
{{quote|To-day the distinction, among collectors of manuscripts, is that ''vellum'' is a highly refined form of skin, ''parchment'' a cruder form, usually thick, harsh, less highly polished than vellum, but with no distinction between skin of calf, or sheep, or of goat.&lt;ref&gt;Ustick 1936, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

French sources, closer to the original etymology, tend to define ''velin'' as from calf only, while the [[British Standards Institution]] defines parchment as made from the split skin of several species, and vellum from the unsplit skin.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Laura, A., ''Bookbinding &amp; conservation by hand: a working guide'', Oak Knoll Press, 1995, {{ISBN|1-884718-11-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-884718-11-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G7tUPQdT2hcC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=sheep+vellum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Op-7E6tE48&amp;sig=jX7CogBbfQLEvoXSj1Xz2R5xCRg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hfyOSvfFFc2hjAfb17n8DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=onepage&amp;q=sheep%20vellum&amp;f=false Google books] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118132433/https://books.google.com/books?id=G7tUPQdT2hcC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=sheep+vellum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Op-7E6tE48&amp;sig=jX7CogBbfQLEvoXSj1Xz2R5xCRg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hfyOSvfFFc2hjAfb17n8DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=onepage&amp;q=sheep%20vellum&amp;f=false |date=2017-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the usage of modern practitioners of the artistic crafts of writing, illuminating, lettering, and bookbinding, "vellum" is normally reserved for calfskin, while any other skin is called "parchment".&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Johnston|Johnston, E.]] (1906 et seq.) ''Writing, Illuminating, and Lettering''; Lamb, C.M. (ed.)(1956) ''The Calligrapher's Handbook''; and publications of [[Society of Scribes &amp; Illuminators]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==
[[File:Portolan by Jacobus Russus of Messina 1533.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A [[portolan chart]] (map) by [[Jacobo Russo]] (Giacomo Russo) of Messina (1533)]] 
Vellum is a translucent material produced from the skin, often split, of a young animal. The skin is washed with water and lime ([[Calcium hydroxide]]), but not together. It is then soaked in lime for several days to soften and remove the hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Once clear, the two sides of the skin are distinct: the side facing inside the animal and the hair side. The "inside body side" of the skin is usually the lighter and more refined of the two. The hair follicles may be visible on the outer side, together with any scarring made while the animal was alive. The membrane can also show the pattern of the animal's vein network called the "veining" of the sheet.&lt;ref name="Codex"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://codexsinaiticus.org/en/project/conservation_physDesc.aspx |title="Recording the physical features of Codex Sinaiticus". ''Codex Sinaiticus'', in partnership with the British Library |access-date=2012-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501201624/http://codexsinaiticus.org/en/project/conservation_physDesc.aspx |archive-date=2012-05-01 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any remaining hair is removed ("scudding") and the skin is dried by attaching it to a frame (a "herse").&lt;ref name="c&amp;g11"&gt;Clemens and Graham 2007, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The skin is attached at points around the circumference with cords; to prevent tearing, the maker wraps the area of the skin to which the cord is to be attached around a pebble (a "pippin").&lt;ref name="c&amp;g11"/&gt; The maker then uses a crescent shaped knife, (a "lunarium" or "lunellum"), to clean off any remaining hairs.

Once the skin is completely dry, it is thoroughly cleaned and processed into sheets. The number of sheets extracted from the piece of skin depends on the size of the skin and the given dimensions requested by the order. For example, the average calfskin can provide three and half medium sheets of writing material. This can be doubled when it is folded into two conjoint leaves, also known as a bifolium. Historians have found evidence of manuscripts where the scribe wrote down the medieval instructions now followed by modern membrane makers.&lt;ref name="daniel"&gt;Thompson, Daniel. "Medieval Parchment-Making". The Library 16, no. 4 (1935).&lt;/ref&gt; The membrane is then rubbed with a round, flat object ("pouncing") to ensure that the ink would adhere well.&lt;ref name="Codex"/&gt;

==Manuscripts==
[[File:Treatises On Natural Science, Philosophy, And Mathematics - Planets.jpg|thumb|right|225px|''A Volume Of Treatises On Natural Science, Philosophy, And Mathematics'' (1300) Ink on vellum.]]

===Preparing manuscripts===
Once the vellum is prepared, traditionally a [[paper quire|quire]] is formed of a group of several sheets. Raymond Clemens and Timothy Graham point out, in their ''Introduction to Manuscript Studies'', that "the quire was the scribe's basic writing unit throughout the Middle Ages".&lt;ref&gt;Clemens and Graham 2007, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Guidelines are then made on the membrane. They note "'pricking' is the process of making holes in a sheet of parchment (or membrane) in preparation of its ruling. The lines were then made by ruling between the prick marks...The process of entering ruled lines on the page to serve as a guide for entering text. Most manuscripts were ruled with horizontal lines that served as the baselines on which the text was entered and with vertical bounding lines that marked the boundaries of the columns".&lt;ref&gt;Clemens and Graham 2007, pp. 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
Most of the finer sort of medieval manuscripts, whether [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] or not, were written on vellum. Some [[Gandharan Buddhist texts]] were written on vellum, and all [[Sifrei Torah]] (Hebrew: ספר תורה Sefer Torah; plural: ספרי תורה, Sifrei Torah) are written on [[kosher]] [[klaf]] or vellum.

A quarter of the 180 copy edition of [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s first [[Gutenberg Bible|Bible]] printed in 1455 with [[movable type]] was also printed on vellum, presumably because his market expected this for a high-quality book. Paper was used for most book-printing, as it was cheaper and easier to process through a [[printing press]] and [[bookbinding|bind]].

In art, vellum was used for paintings, especially if they needed to be sent long distances, before [[canvas]] became widely used in about 1500, and continued to be used for drawings, and [[watercolour]]s. [[Old master print]]s were sometimes printed on vellum, especially for presentation copies, until at least the seventeenth century.

[[Limp vellum]] or limp-parchment bindings were used frequently in the 16th and 17th centuries, and were sometimes [[Gilding|gilt]] but were also often not [[embellishment|embellished]]. In later centuries vellum has been more commonly used like leather, that is, as the covering for stiff board bindings. Vellum can be stained virtually any color but seldom is, as a great part of its beauty and appeal rests in its faint grain and hair markings, as well as its warmth and simplicity.

Lasting in excess of 1,000 years&amp;mdash;[[Gregory the Great, Pastoral Care (Troyes, Bibliothèque Municipale, MS 504)]], for example dates from about 600 and is in excellent condition&amp;mdash;animal vellum can be far more durable than paper. For this reason, many important documents are written on animal vellum, such as diplomas. Referring to a diploma as a "sheepskin" alludes to the time when diplomas were written on vellum made from animal hides.

===Modern usage===
British [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] are still printed on vellum for archival purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Goat skin tradition wins the day | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 1999-11-02 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/502342.stm | access-date = 2016-02-11 | quote = Acts of Parliament dating back to 1497 recorded on vellum are currently held in the House of Lords Public Record Office | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409112147/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/502342.stm | archive-date = 2008-04-09 | dead-url = no | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as are those of the [[Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2FFAQ%2Fdocument1.htm | title = Frequently Asked Questions about the Houses of the Oireachtas - Tithe an Oireachtais | website = [[Oireachtas]] | access-date = 2016-02-11 | quote = Once a Bill has been passed by both Houses, the Taoiseach presents a vellum copy of the Bill, prepared in the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas to the President for signature and promulgation as law. | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/671a1xfLj?url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2FFAQ%2Fdocument1.htm | archive-date = 2012-04-18 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2016, the UK [[House of Lords]] announced that legislation would be printed on archive paper instead of the traditional vellum from April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hughes | first = Laura | title = Thousand year old tradition of printing Britain's laws on vellum has been scrapped to save just £80,000 | newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 2016-02-09 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/12149181/Thousand-year-old-tradition-of-printing-Britains-laws-on-vellum-has-been-scrapped-to-save-just-80000.html | access-date = 2016-02-11 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160212064333/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/12149181/Thousand-year-old-tradition-of-printing-Britains-laws-on-vellum-has-been-scrapped-to-save-just-80000.html | archive-date = 2016-02-12 | dead-url = no | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Minister for the Cabinet Office|Cabinet Office Minister]] [[Matthew Hancock]] intervened by agreeing to fund the continued use of vellum from the [[Cabinet Office]] budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hughes | first = Laura | title = Vellum should be saved in a bid to 'safeguard our great traditions', says minister | newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 2016-02-14 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/12149181/Thousand-year-old-tradition-of-printing-Britains-laws-on-vellum-has-been-scrapped-to-save-just-80000.html | access-date = 2016-02-15 | quote = Mr Hancock told The Daily Telegraph: 'Recording our laws on vellum is a millennium long tradition, and surprisingly cost effective.

Today, because of low demand and complicated manufacturing process, animal vellum is expensive and hard to find. The only UK company still producing traditional parchment and vellum is William Cowley (established 1870), which is based in [[Newport Pagnell]], [[Buckinghamshire]]. A modern imitation is made of [[cotton]]. Known as paper vellum, this material is considerably cheaper than animal vellum and can be found in most art and drafting supply stores. Some brands of [[writing paper]] and other sorts of paper use the term "vellum" to suggest quality.

Vellum is still used for Jewish scrolls, of the [[Torah]] in particular, for luxury book-binding, [[memorial book]]s, and for various documents in [[calligraphy]].  It is also used on instruments such as the [[banjo]] and the [[bodhran]], although synthetic skins are also available for these instruments.

==Paper vellum==
Modern imitation vellum is made from plasticized rag cotton or fibers from interior tree bark. Terms include: paper vellum, Japanese vellum, and vegetable vellum.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Paper vellum is usually translucent and its various [[Paper size|sizes]] are often used in applications where tracing is required, such as [[architectural plan]]s.  It is more dimensionally stable than a linen or paper sheet, which is frequently critical in the development of large scaled drawings such as [[blueprint]]s. Paper vellum had also become extremely important in hand or chemical reproduction technology for dissemination of plan copies. Like a high-quality traditional vellum, paper vellum could be produced thin enough to be virtually [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] to strong light, enabling a source drawing to be used directly in the reproduction of field-used drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Drafting, 60-61; Yee, Rendow, ''Architectural Drawing: A Visual Compendium of Types and Methods'', 4th edition, 2012, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|1118310446}}, 781118310441, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hphgl8Tu1HEC&amp;pg=PT1532 google]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
{{refimprove|date=August 2014}}
Vellum is ideally stored in a stable environment with constant temperature and 30%&amp;nbsp;(±&amp;nbsp;5%) [[relative humidity]]. If vellum is stored in an environment with less than 11% relative humidity, it becomes fragile, brittle, and susceptible to [[mechanical stress]]es; if it is stored in an environment with greater than 40% relative humidity, it becomes vulnerable to gelation and to [[mold]] or [[fungus]] growth.&lt;ref&gt;Eric F. Hansen and Steve N. Lee, "The Effects of Relative Humidity on Some Physical Properties of Modern Vellum: Implications for the Optimum Relative Humidity for the Display and Storage of Parchment", ''The Book and Paper Group Annual'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The optimal temperature for the preservation of vellum is {{convert|20|+/-|1.5|°C|°F|sigfig=2}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5560">The '''will of Naunakhte''' (also referred to as '''Naunakht''') is a [[papyrus]] found at the workmen's village of [[Deir el-Medina]] that dates to the [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th dynasty]] during the reign of [[Ramesses V]] (Černý 1945 pg. 29). Discovered by the French Institute in 1928, the will outlines the division of assets by an Egyptian mother among her children.

==The papyrus==
The will of Naunakhte papyrus was originally separated into two rolls.  Later on, it was discovered that the rolls were cut from the same papyrus; it was decided then to physically rejoin them (Černý 1954 pg. 29). The papyrus measures {{cvt|43|cm}} in height and {{cvt|192|cm}} in length (Černý 1945 pg. 30).

[[Handwriting]] changes provide evidence that the will was written by two different [[scribes]]. It is believed that two scribes wrote different sections (Černý 1945 pg. 31).

The papyrus is now located at the [[Ashmolean Museum]] at [[Oxford University]] and can be found under P.Ashmolean 1945.97 (Haring 2003 p.&amp;nbsp;265).

==Lady Naunakhte==
The Lady Naunakhte held the title of ''citoyenne'' (citizen).  This was indicative of all free women in the 20th dynasty who were not servants or [[slaves]] (Černý 1945 pg. 44).

She was married twice, first to the scribe Kenhikhopshef and then to the workman Khaemnun.  The eight children mentioned in the will belonged to Khaemnun (McDowell 1999 pg. 38).

==Contents of the will==
The will of Naunakhte lays out her wishes on the [[inheritance]] of her eight children.

The will first states the date of its declaration and the names of [[witnesses]] who were present when it was transcribed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Will of Nau-nakht|url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/texts/will_of_naunakhte.htm |website=www.reshafim.org.il|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The will then states which children would receive Naunakhte'a property and which children got nothing. She disinherited three children and bestowed her property on the remaining five. Her son, Kenhikhopshef, received a special reward of a bronze washing bowl. Naunakhte specifically stated that the disinherited children were still eligible to receive property from their father, Khaemnun.

==Significance of will==

The will of Naunakhte offers an insight into the judicial proceedings that affected everyday Egyptians, particularly those of the workmen and their families at [[Deir el-Medina]]. The will also demonstrates the growing use of written records for non-royal Egyptians.

The will also illuminates the place that women held within Egyptian society. Under the 20th dynasty of Egypt, women had the same legal property ownership rights as men. Though women tended to inherit little from their families, they controlled their inheritance, not their husbands (McDowell 1999 pg. 40). The will also gives insight into the practices of caring for elder parents and the social rules that governed their support.

==List of children==
* Maaynakhtef (male)
* Kenhikhopshef (male)
* Amennakht (male)
* Wosnakhte (female)
* Manenakhte (female)
* Neferhot[e]p (male)
* Henshene (female)
* Khanub (female)

According to the papyrus, of the children of Lady Naunakhte and her second husband, Khaemnun, the first five were considered the “good” children who continued to support and provide care to Naunakhte in her old age and therefore received a portion of her property. In contrast, Neferhot[e]p, Henshene, and Khanub failed to support Naunakhte sufficiently and therefore were disowned and left with nothing (Černý 1945 pg. 48).

==Secondary scholarship==
First studied and analyzed by [[Jaroslav Černý (Egyptologist)|Jaroslav Černý]], the will of Naunakhte is often cited in regards to women in Egypt, judicial literature, and life within the workmen's village of Deir el-Medina. For example, A.G. McDowell cites the will of Naunakhte as an example of the power that women held in regards to controlling their own property (McDowell 1999 pg. 40). Also [[Ben Haring]] utilizes the will of Naunakhte in order to describe the growing use of papyri to record both private and judicial matters (Haring 2003 pg. 265).

'''Wolfgang von Kempelen's speaking machine''' is a manually operated speech synthesizer that began development in 1769, by [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] author and inventor [[Wolfgang von Kempelen]]. It was in this same year that he completed his far more infamous contribution to history: [[The Turk]], a [[chess]]-playing [[automaton]], later revealed to be a very far-reaching and elaborate hoax due to the chess-playing human-being occupying its innards.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; But while the Turk's construction was completed in six months, Kempelen's speaking machine occupied the next twenty years of his life.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; After two conceptual "dead ends" over the first five years of research, Kempelen's third direction ultimately led him to the design he felt comfortable deeming "final": a functional representational model of the human [[vocal tract]].&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;

== First design ==

Kempelen's first experiment with [[speech synthesis]] involved only the most rudimentary elements of the vocal tract necessary to produce speech-like sounds. A kitchen bellows, used to stoke fires in wood-burning stoves, was invoked as a set of lungs to supply the airflow. A reed extracted from a common bagpipe was implemented as the [[glottis]], the source of the raw fundamental sound in the vocal tract. The bell of a clarinet made for a sufficient mouth, despite its rigid form. This basic model was able to produce simple vowel sounds only, though some additional articulation was possible by positioning one's hand at the bell opening to obstruct airflow. The physical hardware for constructing the [[Nasal stop|nasals]], [[plosives]] and [[fricatives]] that most [[consonants]] require was not present, however. Kempelen, like many other early pioneers of [[phonetics]], misunderstood the source of the perceived "higher frequencies" of certain sounds as a function of the glottis, rather than as the function of the [[formants]] of the entire vocal tract, so he abandoned his single-reed design for a multiple-reed approach.&lt;sup&gt;[2][3]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Second design ==

The second design involved a console, similar to that of a musical organ of the period, in which the operator manned a set of keys, one for each letter. The sounds were produced by a common bellows that fed air through various pipes with the appropriate shapes and obstructions needed to produce that letter. Through experimentation, he came to find that the reed's [[resonant]] length was not crucial to the creation of the high-frequency components of certain [[vowels]] and fricatives, so he tuned them all to be the same [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] for the sake of consistency between letters. While not all letters were represented at this point, Kempelen had developed the technology required to produce most vowels and several consonants, including the [[plosive]] "p”, and the [[Nasal stop|nasal]] "m”, and thus was in a position to begin forming syllables and short words. However, this immediately led to the primary flaw of his second design: the parallel nature of the multiple reeds allowed for more than one letter to be sounded at a time. And in the process of building syllables and words, the sonic “overlap” (now referred to as [[co-articulation]]) rendered sounds very uncharacteristic of human speech, undermining the intention of the design altogether. Kempelen comments:&lt;br /&gt;
	“In order to continue my experiments it was necessary, above all, that I should have a perfect knowledge of what I wanted to imitate. I had to make a formal study of speech and continually consult nature as I conducted my experiments. In this way my talking machine and my theory concerning speech made equal progress, the one serving as guide to the other.”&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	"It was possible, following the methods I'd been using, to invent separate letters, but never to combine them to form syllables, and that it was absolutely necessary to follow nature which has only one glottis and one mouth, through which every sound emerges and which gives a unity to them."&lt;sup&gt;[2][3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Thus, Kempelen began work on his third, and ultimately final design, which itself was in many ways a "close-as-possible" representation of the [[physiology]] of the vocal tract.

== Third design ==

The third approach followed a similar design to the first, which was conceptually more faithful to the natural design of the human vocal tract than the second. It consisted, like before, of a bellows, a reed and a simulated mouth (this time made of [[India rubber]], for better creation of vowel sounds via manipulation by hand), but also included a "throat" to which a "nasal cavity" was attached (complete with two "nostrils" for making the "n” and "m” sounds), as well as several levers and tubes dedicated to "s” and "sh" sounds, a rod that would interfere with the reeds vibration to make a rolling "r” sound, and a separate, smaller bellows that would allow air to pass the reed while the mouth was completely closed (a feature required for the "b” sound). At one point, a special valve intended to simulate the "f” fricative was included, but was later removed when it was revealed that the same sound could be achieved by simply closing all of the orifices of the machine and allowing air to leak from the cracks. Similarly, at one point in the design, there was an alternate "mouth" assembly consisting of a wooden box with a pair of hinged shutters that acted as lips. Inside the box resided a hinged, wooden, string-operated flap that acted as a tongue. The purpose of this assembly was to mimic the mouth and tongue in the construction of plosives such as "b” and "d”, but was later removed when Kempelen recognized that without a proper tongue, the machine would never be able to produce the "t”, "k”, "d” and "g” sounds. He found his way around this entire problem by replacing the "t” and "k” sounds with the "p” sound, and the "d” and "g” sounds with the "b” sound (which itself was simply a slight variation of the "p” sound). In the context of a familiar word, listeners often ignored the mispronunciation altogether (a phenomenon later explored by researchers in the field of [[cognitive science]]). Kempelen believed that people were more forgiving of the errors made by his machine due to the frequency of the reed and vocal tract resonant length he chose to use, which create a resonance much more like a young child, than that of an adult.&lt;sup&gt;[2][3]&lt;/sup&gt;
	This third design, unlike those before it, was completely capable of speaking complete phrases in French, Italian and English (German was possible, but required a greater skill-level by the operator, due to the more frequent use of consonants in the German language). Its greatest limitation was the bellows, which, although they were six times the capacity of human lungs, ran empty of air much faster than that of its human counterpart. Because the design was based on a single reed as the glottal sound-source, he had none of the problems of co-articulation that came inherently with the second design. But that single reed also meant that the Speaking Machine "spoke" in monotone&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;. Kempelen expended some time to try and introduce several [[prosodic]] pitch-variation mechanisms into the reed assembly, but to no avail. He decided to leave the design to be improved upon by the next batch of experimenters.
	All of these important additions for the third design came from the two decades of intensive research of the vocal tract in relation to spoken languages by Kempelen, for which the behavior of each crucial physiological element of speech production was scrutinized and replicated acoustically and/or mechanically.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;

== A significant contribution ==

Shortly after the completion and exhibition of his Speaking Machine, in 1804, von Kempelen died, though not before publishing an extremely comprehensive journal of the past twenty years of his research in phonetics. The 456-page book, titled ''Mechanismus der menschlichen Sprache nebst Beschreibung einer sprechenden Maschine'' (which translates to ''The Mechanism of Human Speech, with a Description of a Speaking Machine'', published in 1791)&lt;sup&gt;[2][4]&lt;/sup&gt;, contained every technical aspect of both Kempelen's construction of the Speaking Machine (including the preliminary designs) and his studies of the human vocal tract.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;

In 1837, [[Sir Charles Wheatstone]] resurrected the work of Wolfgang von Kempelen, creating an improved replica of his Speaking Machine.&lt;sup&gt;[3][4]&lt;/sup&gt; Using new technology developed over the previous 50 years, Wheatstone was able to further analyze and synthesize components of acoustic speech, giving rise to the second wave of scientific interest in phonetics. After viewing Wheatstone's improved replica of the Speaking Machine at an exposition, a young [[Alexander Graham Bell]] set out to construct his own speaking machine with the help and encouragement of his father.&lt;sup&gt;[4][5]&lt;/sup&gt; Bell's experiments and research ultimately led to his invention of the telephone in 1876&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;, which revolutionized global communication.

In 1968, Marcel van den Broecke (University of Amsterdam) built a replica as part of a MA thesis, about which he reported in "Sound Structures", Marcel van den Broecke, Vincent van Heuven and Wim Zonneveld (eds.), chapter 2, p 9-19: "Wolfgang von Kempelen's Speaking Machine as a Performer", Foris Publications, Dordrecht-Netherlands/Cinnaminson-USA, 1983.
Acoustic predictions using N-tube approximations of the vocal tract and applying them to the replica's characteristics showed what had already been established perceptually, namely that the machine could only produce two vowel-like sounds, viz. an /a/-like vowel and an /o/-like vowel. Of the consonants produced, the general purpose plosive is very convincing. A general purpose nasal can also easily be identified, but sibilants and the rattling /r/ are as unpleasant as eye witness von Windisch reported two centuries earlier.

'''Wörter und Sachen''' ([[German language|German]] for ''words and things'') was a [[philology|philological]] movement of the early 20th Century, based largely in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]].

Its proponents believed that the [[etymology]] of [[word]]s should be studied in close association with (in fact, in parallel with) the study of the [[Cultural artifact|artefact]]s and [[culture|cultural]] concepts which those words had denoted. This process would, it was argued, enable researchers to study linguistic data more effectively.

Many of the principles and theories of the ''Wörter und Sachen'' movement have since been incorporated into modern [[historical linguistics]]; for example, the practice of cross-referencing with [[archaeology|archaeological]] data.
